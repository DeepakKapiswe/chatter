Just for completeness, there is a Terminal Services client for Windows 
98 available for download from Microsoft's web site.  It is now called 
Remote Desktop Connection.  There is also a Mac client.

rdesktop works just as well.  tsclient provides a graphical interface 
similar to RDC for making connections.

/dev/hda1 is the first partition on /dev/hda hard drive.  The MBR is the 
first sector of the hard drive, /dev/hda.  It is possible to have a boot 
sector in the first sector of a partition for use with chaining.

In my experience, it is easiest to have GRUB installed in the MBR.  With 
Windows 2000 and XP, chain loading works great.  This is the config from 
my /etc/grub.conf.  Windows 2000 is installed in /dev/hda1; hd0,0 for GRUB.

If you're root, could you steal their X auth crap and pop up an X app in
their face over the tunnel they're using?

Though I don't qualify as 'guru' status I'll give it a stab.  I tried
messing around with the `xmessage' command a bit to see if I could get
it to print out the contents of /var/log/messages.  I run into the
problem of ownership though and can't `tail' it.

However, my hunch is that by playing around with `xmessage' you can find
what you are looking for.  But, like I said, this is just a hunch.  I
fiddled around with it to no avail but that doesn't mean it isn't
possible.

a. notify people at least a day in advance.  a week in advance is
   better.  regular weekly maintenance time is good.

b. ask everyone to run a message program like zephyr or AIM or
   whatever, send alerts that way.  or set up a 'system alert'
   mailing list, which allows people to subscribe their
   email->pager gateway, etc.

c. the hard part is emergencies that involve failure in the
   messaging mechanism.  writing a message to a person's tty is a
   very simple and robust mechanism.  if that doesn't work then
   the whole system is likely to be unusable, and it won't be a
   big deal to reboot without advance notice.  offhand, I can't
   think of any other message mechanism with that characteristic.

   if it's important, set up a list of phone numbers to call for
   alerts.

I second Mr Lee's suggestions. The other suggestions thusfar involve
either revealing too much information or depending on the system
having tty's available (such as xterm), which can't be depended
upon. If it's a tunnel, even snarfing xauth permissions is dubious,
though that would be second attempt besides the above (using some
GNOME/KDE tool for scripting dialog boxes). Since the user may not
even be present and have work open, there's just no way to guarantee
no data loss in the cases of "emergencies". Patience in rebooting is
more likely effective.

Well well well, the answer is easy. It does work. xterm, gnome-terminal, 
aterm, wterm all pick up shutdown and wall messages.... everyone but Konsole.

With this new evidence I have a new question then: What do these
terminal emulators do that rxvt doesn't?  It doesn't pick up wall or
shutdown messages.  Is it a compile time option for rxvt?

rxvt picks up wall and write messages on my machine, Fedora Core 1.  The 
one difference could be that rxvt is not writing to /var/run/utmp.  wall 
looks there to find the logged in terminals.  There is a flag (-ut), and 
  resource that controls this.  I guess it could be a compile-time 
option.  It could also be installed non-suid root and not have permissions.

it's about whether you're "logged in" or not,
which is about writing to /var/run/utmp (used to be /etc/utmp),
which is what 'wall' uses to decide where to write to,
and also what 'who' uses to report who's logged in.

any program that wants to be "logged in"
needs to be able to write to utmp,
which means it needs to be set-gid utmp or set-uid root,
or it needs to call a program that can write to utmp,
such as "login".

note, "wall" won't notify remote X users who aren't running an
xterm or similar tty program.

Try as I might I cannot get rxvt to work with /var/run/utmp.  I looked
at the compiled in options with rxvt --help and utmp support is there.
I ran rxvt +ut and rxvt -ut with to no avail.  I also set rxvt to
set-gid utmp with no success.  So what is wrong here?  I have the +ls
option set for rxvt which, I am under the impression, is supposed to use
login.  Any ideas what to try next?

Subject: [PLUG] Loadable Kernel Modules
Message-ID: <20040102045926.31649.qmail@web9603.mail.yahoo.com>

My fascination with this subject arose in a rather
unusual way.  I installed SuSE recently, but something
is wrong with the configuration of the boot loader. I
expect to solve this problem in due course, but in the
meantime I can boot only with the floppy disk created
during the installation. Moreover, my attempts to copy
this disk have been unsuccessful (because I can't
mount it). So if this disk were brought near a
magnetic field, I would again be at the mercy of Bill
Gates.

I downloaded boot.iso from SuSE's FTP site. CD's are
rugged, so I would not expect to have such problems
with them. Unfortunately, when I booted into Linux
from this disk, certain functions were missing, such
as the Ethernet connection and sound. I suspected that
such functions were present in kernel modules, and
tested this hypothesis by attempting to enable the
Ethernet card before rebooting. I selected
?RTL8139too? from the drop-down menu, though I did not
provide any parameters. (These apparently should be
io=d0000 irq=9.) In any case, the Ethernet card
functioned when the system came up, though of course
there was still no sound.

In any case, the subject of kernel modules is an
interesting one. The book most frequently cited on the
subject is the one by Rubini and Corbett. What seems
to be more difficult to find is a rather comprehensive
list of all device drivers in use with the parameters
for each, often none. It would be interesting to know
where such a list is maintained, if indeed one exists.

I've had problems in the past with iso's burned under full speed.  Sometimes 
throttle down to 8x to be reliable.  (The drive is a Plextor 16x, good 
rep...difficult job I guess)

What is the title of the book?  In any case, the most authortative source is 
the source itself.  Install the kernel rpm and peruse

The installer didn't fail as he's not using the install. He is booting
from the CD and then using the booted CD  kernel with the installed
system on the hard drive. As the modules aren't available after the hard
drive systems comes up, he can't insert modules into the kernel. 

Thank you
Russell

ok, I've been reading things wrongly a lot lately, dunno if I'm being dense 
or if precise writing is elusive.

Why aren't the modules available after the hard drive systems come up? 
Different kernel versions?

And I'll just shift my previous statement to express surprise that the 
installer failed in regard to hosing the boot loader.  Yeah, that's what I 
meant.

I did a search on the net to see what security vulnerabilities gFTP has
had in the past and I could only find two such cases, one major, one
minor, both in 2001.

Vulnerability #1: (Remote Format String Vulnerability)
(quote) "A format string bug exists in the facility used by the gftp
client program to log FTP and HTTP responses. As a result, it may be
possible for a malicious remote server to execute arbitrary code on a
user's system."  This was fixed back in version 2.0.8
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/2657/info/

Vulnerability #2: (On-Screen Plaintext Password Vulnerability)
(quote) "When a user logs on to an FTP server using gFTP the login
password is displayed in plaintext on the screen."  This was fixed in
2.0.7(?).
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/3446/info/

The exploit you're thinking about was probably due to the general
insecurities/problems with the SS1 protocol, which is what support they
removed in .15.

Cheers,

Daniel

You are probably correct on this matter.  I can read the partition
information, but the kernel won't let the system update the cached/older
partition information, because it could result in possible corruption. 
Running fdisk on a mounted hard disk results in the following:
...
WARNING: Re-reading the partition table failed with error 16: Device or
resource busy.
The kernel still uses the old table.
The new table will be used at the next reboot.
...

The scenarios I described before should still be mostly true as to when
you need to reboot the system when repartitioning.

Daniel

when you have source code, black box debugging is generally a
waste of time for something as simple as this.

a. google for something like "rxvt doesn't write to utmp".  if
   you don't find an answer quickly,

b. compile rxvt with -g if it isn't already, and run it under gdb
   and see if it's actually calling the function that writes to
   utmp.  sometimes 'strace' is useful if you don't want to
   recompile gdb.

   debugging set-id programs is a little messy, in general you
   have to be root to do it.

If you have some unusual configuration which requires some modules to be
loaded at boot so that some file systems may be read, you may need to
run mkinitrd.  This command loads the necessary modules for booting. 
Man mkinitrd for a synopsis of the command.  But short and sweet:
mkinitrd /boot/initrd-2.2.5-15.img 2.2.5-15

This will make the necessary modules available the next booting.

Subject: [PLUG] gentoo-sparc impressions
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0401020851460.8849@pecos.madboa.com>

I installed Gentoo on my Sun Blade 100 (500MHz UltraSPARC-IIe) a
couple weeks ago. This is about the fifth different OS/distro I've put
on this machine; it's had Solaris 8, Solaris 9, Debian, OpenBSD, and
now Gentoo.

Solaris is too proprietary for my taste. Debian was OK, but it just
didn't feel good on the sparc (though I'm satisfied with my Debian
installations on an Alpha and Celeron at home). OpenBSD is very
conservative -- it still runs gcc 2.x and older libs -- and some
crucial ports like ntp never worked well. Plus, the curve for
mastering the OpenBSD security-level stuff is fairly steep, and I
needed a production box sooner rather than later.

Gentoo is the first Free, well behaved, and up-to-date distro that's
really felt good on this machine, which serves as my network gateway,
mail server, and web-development server. In the latter capacity, it's
running MySQL. I think it will soon be my LDAP server as well, but
there are some sticky replication issues that need to be ironed out.

Here are some impressions:

*   The installation documention wasn't included in the CD ISO. How
    wierd is that? The installation instructions are split over a
    dozen or so HTML pages, so I had to pre-download them before
    proceeding.

*   I did the compile-the-whole-thing installation rather than go with
    the pre-compiled stage3 packages. It took about a day to get the
    basic system up and running; most of that time was spent compiling
    glibc and gcc.

*   I've encountered two package hiccups:

    1. A recent silo (sparc bootloader) upgrade left my system
       unbootable. I had to boot from CD and downgrade the package. I
       haven't had time yet to follow up on this.

    2. The sendmail and ssmtp packages don't work and play well. The
       vixie-cron ebuild requires a virtual-mta package, which is
       supposedly supplied by sendmail, but portage insists on
       building ssmtp, which stomps all over sendmail.

*   I've been able to lock the box up completely on two occasions by
    reloading some iptables rules. This is almost certainly not a
    Gentoo issue, but I mention it just for completeness.

*   I communicate with this box over a serial console and ethernet.
    There's no keyboard or monitor -- and I haven't (and probably
    won't) install X -- so I can't report on using its graphics
    subsystem. Ditto for USB and FireWire.

    The great thing is that everything, from boot to full system, work
    flawlessly over the serial console. The only concession I had to
    make was to remove the consolefont and keymaps init scripts from
    the default boot runlevel.

*   The kernel that ships with the boot ISO and the kernel I ended up
    building both had no trouble at all using the built-in GEM
    Ethernet controller and an add-in Intel EEPro card.

    Also, Gentoo ships with dhcpcd instead of ISC's dhclient. That's a
    great choice. I like dhcpcd soooo much better.

*   Most of the core ebuilds are kept fairly up to do for the sparc
    platform -- but many that aren't as central to the system aren't.
    The default SpamAssassin for sparc is 2.4x, which is way, way out
    of date (so I just grabbed the latest from CPAN :-). Inexplicably,
    the DocBook stuff is also quite old.

*   Other than SpamAssassin, I also had to build MIMEDefang and
    Dovecot by hand, but the builds went without a hitch.

*   The init scripts are wierd.

*   /etc/conf.d == /etc/sysconfig

*   rc-update == chkconfig

*   It was very helpful to me, a long-time rpm user, to install the
    'epm' package, which makes querying packages/files much more
    familiar.

*   I dropped this script into /etc/cron.daily to give me a nightly
    report concerning newly updated ebuilds.

    #!/bin/sh
    EMERGE="/usr/bin/emerge"
    GREP="/bin/grep"

    if test -f $EMERGE
    then
      $EMERGE --quiet --nospinner sync 2>&1 | $GREP '^>>>'
      sleep 10
      sync
      $EMERGE --pretend --nospinner --update --deep world
    fi

*   The Sun Blade 100 has a known problem with its system clock
    running too quickly. Sun released a Solaris patch to address the
    issue, but afaict there's no Linux patch for it. Still, ntp is
    able to keep the clock in fairly good shape.

Thanks, this driver does the trick.  I've found that the patch
for 2.4.20 works with 2.4.23.  I created a linux-2.4.20 link 
to my 2.4.23 source tree and applied the patch as if it were
for the correct version.  I could sure use a good reference
on writing kernel drivers, from the glance I took at the
source code I'm a ways from being able to decipher it.

It's interesting that probing /proc/pci my wireless card
comes as a 2602w.  The plx driver is what I had to use.

I like the switch to wlan0, it seperates normal interfaces
that are wired from the ones that aren't which have very different
security concerns with them.

What are my options to encrypt and secure an 802.11b link?
I suppose IPSec isn't transparent.  I'll have to update
my Windows test box updated to Linux :-)

Just read about nameif. You can do this for any network interface on

You might check into ssh/ssl libs as i don't think Gentoo includes some fixes to improve performance. ssh tends to take longer on gentoo-sparc64 to authenticate a ssh session for example.

This is the only way to install Gentoo IMO :)

grep mta /usr/portage/profiles/default-sparc64-1.4/virtuals is your anwser to this problem. s/ssmtp/sendmail should fix that.

Works fine. Some people have had issues with XFree86 and ATI video chips.

This is mostly due to Gentoo Sparc developers not updating keywords then ebuilds not "working" on sparc64. I've done ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~86" emerge -pv "ebuild" without too many problems :)So i suggest updating keywords in ebuilds yourself then report back to Gentoo Sparc developers when you find a newer version working on your blade.

As a side note, I'd be leery of automating any updates. Portage and the portage rsync tree are its greatest strength and biggest weakness.

Message-ID: <1073113896.18855.30.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I have run into a few curiosities with fetchmail and imap.
Does IMAP draw the mail out of the local postfix mail
queue before any local mail user agent such as pine, etc.
, can?  If not, can messages go missing from the imap
server if they are picked up by a local mail user agent
on the server?

With fetchmail, I'm trying the fetch-all and keep options. 
I attempted to delete messages after fetching them only to 
see them pop up again.  Where is the list of what emails a 
client has received kept in IMAP?  I'm trying to use imap 
2000.  Does imap compare the folder that is being 
downloaded into to what's on the server to synchronize 
the two, a local list of emails, or a remote one on the
server itself?

What is being downloaded with IMAP?  Is it just headers?
When the message is read is it downloaded?  Is it still
on the server after it is read?  Does the client download
to a temp file and then discard that after you're done
reading a message?  I'm used to an smtp and local mua
only environment.

This is a security risk.  What if the user creating "root" or
"postmastrer" or "michael."

There are a number of mechanisms to due this correctly.  Most involved a
database (postgres or mysql) or use dbm files.

Blocking is easy.  Block everything you do not specifically allow.

Very admin intensive.

If using the db options now, if using an alias file, you need to run
postmap on the file (which created the .db files.

Note:  alias files are for all domains.  Virtual files are per domain.

If you are going to do this, then jump to web-cyradm
(http://www.web-cyradm.org/).  This allows users (domain admins) to
control users for the the imap account (nothing to do with users on the
system), domain aliases, and other things.

I use the Postgres version.

One thing this does is it forces you to maintain a database to receive
mail.


The trick in postfix from from:  
/etc/postfix/main.cf:
        proxy_read_maps= proxy:unix:passwd.byname
        proxy:pgsql:/etc/postfix/pgsql-virtual.cf,
        proxy:pgsql:/etc/postfix/pgsql-canonical.cf,
        proxy:pgsql:/etc/postfix/pgsql-mydestination.cf

        #..... etc
        local_recipient_maps = proxy:unix:passwd.byname $alias_maps
        
        # .... etc
        virtual_maps=proxy:pgsql:/etc/postfix/pgsql-virtual.cf
        
        # alias domains ....
        virtual_alias_domains =
        proxy:pgsql:/etc/postfix/pgsql-mydestination.cf
        
        # Outgoing addresses should be rewritten from e.g test0002 at
        domain to user.name at
        # virtualhost.com. This is important if you like to use a
        webmail interface.
        sender_canonical_maps =
        proxy:pgsql:/etc/postfix/pgsql-canonical.cf
        #
        mailbox_transport = lmtp:unix:public/lmtp
        fallback_transport = lmtp:unix:public/lmtp

These changes are forcing postfix to use the lmtp protocol.  Cyrus is
likewise changed.  You can use this as a template for your changes.

I also added amavis-new and SpammAssassin.

For all of this to work you need to check the versions numbers.  RH9 was
not new enough for several of the packages.

Judging from this paragraph and the rest of the email (snipped) I think
you don't have a very good understanding of how email works on the
server side of things.  I would suggest reading up on it a bit, but I'll
give you a brief explanation of what you're asking about...

Mail is stored in spools on the server, be it an mbox file or maildir. 
When it comes in, it's put in to the user's spool, usually in
/var/spool/mail/$user if you're using mbox... if you're using maildir
the spool will generally be in your home directory.

Fetchmail takes the mail and puts it into a mail spool somewhere.

IMAP reads mail from the mail spool allowing a client system access to a
user's email almost as if the spool were local.

POP3 reads mail from the mail spool, generally sending it to a client
then deleting it from the spool.

AFAICT, imap2000 doesn't seem to really be the most popular nor the best
IMAP server to be running.  It seems difficult to find decent IMAP
servers these days.  I've pretty much settled on BincIMAP.  It's young,
but seems to be doing good for me... it's quick.  You'd have to convert
from mbox to maildir to use it, though.

I've been using dovecot for the past couple weeks. It can work with
Maildir or mbox, does SSL quite easily and can enforce some crypto
discipline, handles both pop and imap, supports SASL or passwd
authentication, etc.

I'll have to say, however, that I had good luck with uw-imap and have
nothing bad to say about it at all. The main reason I moved to dovecot
was for Maildir support.

I prefer things... servers, especially... to do one thing and do it
well.  I don't like the idea of one server handling pop3 and imap
together very much... but maybe that's just me...

FWIW, BincIMAP handles Maildir, not mbox (currently, although I think
they may add mbox support down the road), handles SSL/TLS just fine
(unless you build statically on a different system and move the binaries
over, it seems) and is very flexible in its authentication.  By default,
it uses 'checkpasswd' but it can be set to use almost anything else, I
guess.

That said, I'll have to look at dovecot if for no other reason than I've
never heard of it before.  :-)

I used uw-imap for quite some time... but didn't have much good to say
about it.  It didn't seem to fully understand separation of mail spools
and regular files in your home directory and as a result would often
scan the entire directory for email.  I didn't realize this was the
cuase of the uw slowdown until I was speaking with SquirrelMail devs one
day who started ranting a bit when they learned I was using uw-imap. 
:-)

That and procmail can't seem to write to an mbox file once it hits 49MB
in size any more.  So I needed to move over to Maildir.  Maildir is so
much more responsive than mbox with large spools after the initial cache
is built.

I do like Maildir much better than mbox, though we've got mbox spools
at work that are larger than 49MB. Our four largest spools are 168M,
147M, 121M and 105M -- and there are another dozen or so over 50M.

Interesting.  I hit 49MB several months ago on my LKML spool and
procmail all of a sudden couldn't lock it anymore.  It didn't make any
sense, and nothing I did convinced it to lock it, so I had to roll over
to an empty file.  Then a month or two later, it did the same thing. 
Then it did it again and I decided it was time for Maildir.  :-)

Maybe it was something else...

This is something I don't know how to do.  That is control who the
sender address cam be so that anyone who sends email outside my

Read what?  There are a lot of HOWTO's that aren't good enough.
There are a lot of books like the one Sendmail that wouldn't
be particularly helpful.  When using IMAP, where are the lists
of what is read and not read kept?  Does IMAP ever remove 
messages from the spool?  Who teaches a course on Postfix 
and other mail issues within the Portland area or online?
Where I'm at, there isn't exactly a public library to go
that has anything useful on technical topics.  I didn't
know of any such resource when I was at Portland State 
either, the unrealistic expectations of some instructors
such as Karla Fant compounding this problem.  It isn't
talked about enough in Computer Science programs at PSU.

Can a Maildir be elsewhere than the home directory so that mixing with
other files isn't a problem?  What files need to be changed to relocate
Maildirs or is the location of the Maildir assumed by many programs?
Is evolution Maildir compatible?

Alone each one may not be good enough, but together they start to paint
a picture you can use to get a better idea of how email is working on
your mail server.

Maildir provides a mechanism for indicating to whatever software happens
to be reading the specific spool what has and what has not been read. 
Since many things could be reading from the spool (mutt, pine, pop3,
imap, others?)... the mechanism for identifying what has and has not
been read must be very standardized.  If you read documents on how
Maildir works, you'll probably start to understand this a little bit. 
Hint:  It has to do with the naming of the files.

mbox surely has a similar function, although I never really got in to
the how's and why's of mbox so really can't speak to how exactly it
works.

Sure the imap server can remove messages from the spool.  Why wouldn't
it, when you hit delete on the message?  Just like mutt can remove
messages from the spool.  Have you ever actually used imap before?

> Who teaches a course on Postfix 
> and other mail issues within the Portland area or online?

Google might know.  I think taking a class on Postfix is probably a
little bit overboard unless you want to become a professional sysadmin.

You need to understand we don't care if you're using Postfix or some
hand-rolled MTA, though.  As soon as it puts the mail in the spool, it
is done with it, it does not care what, if anything, happens to the
mail.

Computer Science != SysAdmin

Computer Science is about creating programs to do things for you, not
about setting up mail servers.  Why the hell would you expect to be
taught about IMAP, Postfix, Maildir, or mbox in a CS program?

You could put a Maildir anywhere you want to.  However, getting an IMAP
server to read from a Maildir outside of your home directory can be
tricky.  Getting Postfix to deliver to a Maildir outside of your home
directory can be tricky.  Such things are not recommended.  What *I* did
was set the default to ~/.Maildir/INBOX so it isn't seen unless I want
to see it.

I'm sure evolution is Maildir compatible ... but are you running
evolution on the mail server, reading right off the spool?  From the
other email you sent, I'm assuming you want Evolution reading from an
IMAP server, right?  Evolution speaks IMAP... we don't care what IMAP
speaks as long as it speaks whatever your mail is stored as.  IMAP does
the translation from Maildir.

Please, if you haven't already... PLAY WITH THIS.  If you don't wish to
read a bunch of documents on the subject, just play with it yourself,
see what it can do, see what it can't do.

At the risk of offending everybody by stating your questions are
somewhat stupid... your questions are somewhat stupid.  They show you
have not tried to do your homework.  You are asking questions without
understanding what it is you are even asking.  Do you even understand
what IMAP is?  What an IMAP server does?  What Postfix does?  What a
mail spool is?  If you don't fully understand these items, read up on
each individual one, get a good grasp of each one, *then* ask questions
about them.

Please, GAFC.  STFW.  RTFM.

mbox clients (mail readers or things like pop/imap servers) add
a Status: and X-Status: header into each message:

Status: O    <-- new message
Status: RO   <-- message that's been read

X-Status: A  <-- message that's been answered
X-Status: D  <-- message that's marked as deleted
X-Status: AD <-- combo of above two

There are other permutation of those headers, but that's the gist of
it. The absence of the Status: or X-Status: headers means that a
message has not been read by an mbox-compliant mail client or pop/imap
server.

To be able to write mail software and operating system 
code.  Understanding and using software is about more 
than just reading code, otherwise none of us would ever 
be able to use the sizable systems we have today stuck
in the verification process.  If there is a great chasm
between the sysadmin and the programmer, this does
not bode well for future software projects.
  
Computer science is an umbrella, it's sad that many 
limit it to the reading and writing of code.  In 
reality, a good programmer has to come up with algorithms, 
etc. before writing a new program or even interpreting an 
old one.  The source code, especially when it is poorly 
documented, is never enough.  There are network 
administrators and network programmers, the latter 
has a far better chance of contributing source 
code changes to the open source community.  For lack
of a Network Programmers degree at Portland State,
CS is the closest second.  I think Linus has a 
specialty in Unix system architecture.

I have used IMAP, the explanation that it makes
a spool merely look local is oversimplified.  There is
marking with an mbox or Maildir spool to determine
what is read and not read ( ? on deleted ).  There is 
understanding when fetchmail is invoked with fetch-all 
why the same messages sometimes get retrieved ten 
to twelve times.  What is up with incremental 
message downloads in evolution if the remote 
spool has 200 messages?  Is this a problem with mbox, 
evolution crashing during message retrieval, or is 
it a problem with the remote source?  If a download 
crashes during an imap session, does this result in 
multiple copies of the last message sought?  If you 
fetchmail from imap to imap, do you need to set the 
address of the source server to allow deleting  
messages?

For now I'm just going to try and work with fetchmail.
I have decidedly backed off of having a local 
IMAP server.

When will there be a nationally recognized bachelor's 
degree for system administration?  I guess it would
be called bachelors of infrastructure technology,
or whatever IT stands for.  ITT has some degrees,
but they're anti Linux, horribly expensive, and
their degrees are not nationally recognized under
the same accreditation system that traditional
degrees are.  When I talked with them, it seemed
I'd be training to become a slave to some
single job description or small menu thereof
in an atmosphere of potentially zero technology
sector job offerings.  ITT looks to be a path to 
earning less than a person with a traditional 
degrees and ultimately working with anything 
(mostly Windows), but not Linux.

Message-ID: <200401031348.43119.carla@bratgrrl.com>

Anyone know of a nice script for adding users in bulk on a Linux system? 
Assume you already have a database of user information of some kind- a 
/passwd file from another system, a directory or database of some kind.
I think I would want the login names and other personal data, and then 
generate a new password. I've been googling without much success.

If there is such a thing, it will probably have to be modified, but it would 
be nice to have something to play with.

thanks!

A good sysadmin doesn't need a degree.  Good sysadmins learn from
experience, not so much textbooks.

IT stands for Information Technology, AFAIK.

It shouldn't be very difficult to write a script like that at all.

Use 'useradd' ....

In a for loop, something like:

useradd -p $PASSWORD $USERNAME
mkdir /home/$USERNAME
chown $USERNAME /home/$USERNAME

...should do the trick for you.  You can, of course, modify the useradd
line with more options if you want to do things differently than the
system default options.

Experience with whom I might ask?  If strong
theoretical knowledge and skill isn't required
to start earning money as a sysadmin, then who 
trains people to get them in to the field
of paid administrators?

I want a degree anyways from the standpoint of
having something that says educated. If degree 
falls short of that, I want one because 
they say got through an accredited academic 
program.  The trouble with computer science
is how uneducated you can come off 
even with the BS.  It's certainly reasonable 
to ask, "why go to the trouble."  A lit
or business degree would in all probability
be easier to get where medicine is a more
stable field.

Rather,

Why do you folks always do things the hard way?

Of course, that's
useradd -d /home/$USERNAME -m -k /etc/skel -p $PASSWORD $USERNAME

Though, I'm all for explicitly setting the uid, gid, shell, and comment as
well.

Using tar will pick up symlinks, directories, etc...

  tar -cC /etc/skel . | tar -xC /home/$USERNAME

though the -C switch is specific to GNU tar.

Actually, you don't need to upgrade to 2.4.23, as long as you have the
security updates in your sources.list -- debian backports security
updates into its stable kernel (2.4.18 at the moment) so as to provide
the minimum of hassle to production environments.

I quickly tried FreeAmp (now known as "zinf" I believe), SnackAmp, and a 
front end to mplayer, and none seem to do what I'd like (seek within a 
streamed track that is); it's possible that it could be a configuration 
issue but this isn't the most interesting thing to solve at the moment.

Thanks for your suggestions!

I had the same problem and for me it was a postfix limit that prevented

there's a limit set in whatever you use for mail service.

You can encrypt the password with grub-md5-crypt, too.  At least it is

This is a question that is asked on a regular basis. I am asking again,
because the answer is a moving target. 

I'm investigating co-location sites, mainly here in Portland. If anyone
has pertinent, recent information, I would greatly appreciate it. 

Also, I'd like any recommendations anyone would have.

Thanks!

I have had a good experience with Inflow[1].  They aren't based out of
Portland, but each co-lo is managed regionally as a separate profit&loss
center, so the management decisions are local (helps a bit with policies).
The fact that they are still around has to give them something as well. :)

I've also been keeping my eye on pdxcolo.net.  I like the idea of having
my own user-mode linux without having to deal with any hardware.  I think
this model also benefits user-mode linux as pdxcolo.net has an interest in
making user-mode linux work well.

Subject: [PLUG] slow resolving host behind DI-604 router
Message-ID: <20040104214545.36f6ad0f.rdought@pacifier.com>

I put my linux box running SuSE 8.1 behind a D-Link DI-604 router/firewall, which is connected to ADSL. Before putting the machine behind the router, all my network connection (i.e., web, email, etc.) were quite quite quick. After setting up the DI-604, I can successfully connect to outside addresses, but resolving host names is terribly slow. However, when I use nslookup I get a very fast response. If I run Win NT though vmware, the response is also very quick! The problem does not seem to be browser or software related--the slow down occurs with different browsers (mozilla, galeon, konqueror) as well as with my email retrieval (sylpheed).

Any help to resolving this problem would be greatly appreciated! I've included my host.conf, hosts, and resolv.conf for reference.

Thanks.

I've been using PDXColo.net for approx 4 months. They're definately 
doing their best to make their system quick and well organized. When I 
first signed up, I was logged into my new virtual "box" as root in 
roughly 20 minutes. There have been a few little kinks, but for the most 
part I haven't had any real issues and they're on IRC, so it's easy to 
get quick support there.

www.spiretech.com is inexpensive. You use your own
computer.

One potential problem with any colo facility is e-mail and
spam. If your "neighbors" in the IP address space are spammers,
your address can be black listed. With a colo facility that
allows customers to use their own computers, the spammer could
be a hacked Windows box.

Message-ID: <20040105190407.17789.qmail@web9605.mail.yahoo.com>

I have discussed this before, but this is probably the
easiest way to do it:

Put GRUB in the first sector of /boot, if not already
there.

Copy to a DOS-formatted floppy disk:
dd if=/dev/hdb2 of=/bootsect.lnx bs=512 count=1

Any 8.3 filename not already used will do, and your
device name is probably different, too.

Copy this small file to c:\ on Windows XP.

At the command line:

attrib -r -s -h c:\boot.ini

Add this at the end:

c:\bootsect.lnx="Linux"

Change the attributes back:

attrib +r +s +h c:\boot.ini and reboot.

NTLDR's welcome screen is pretty ugly, so if you want
a splash screen of Michelangelo painting the Sistine
Chapel, you may have to use a different method.

Or a hacked Linux box.  Some spammers are hijacking some older cgi

They are more oriented toward larger customers but if you are looking

Nice try, but newusers is pretty much useless. it does not create useful UIDs 
or GIDs, and having to create them manually rather defeats the idea of trying 
to automate the process. Back to swotting at scripts...

usermod moves a user's home directory, and handles all the grunt work of 
permissions etc:

# usermod -d /server1/home/username/ -m  username

And good ole awk is find n dandy for finding all the files that belong to a 
user, such as crontabs, mail spools, random stuff:

# find / -uid 1050
# find / -user username

Find orphaned files with -nouser and -nogroup.

I'd rather write a borky script that fall from a bike, but oh well. :)

Ok I am still mystified. is this line supposed to do something all by itself? 
'cause it doesn't. Where do the new users come from? 

Oh here's another cool find command that comes in handy when making mass 
changes because a user has moved or been deleted:

# find / -uid 1050 -exec chown  1200 {} \;

Or use the usernames instead of uid. However if the user has been deleted, the 
only way to find any remaining files are by the uid.

HI All,
I'm here to bitch, so if you don't want to hear it(readit) then kill
file the thread please.

I'm bloody damned tired of signing up for a class to find it's been
canceled. Then being offered a MS class instead. I'm damned tired of
trying to finish my degree while avoiding contamination of my thinking
by being forced into MS product line. I'm willing to pay $3000.00 to
have classes that will teach me enough unix/linux that I can operate a
small (10-300) machine system and associated servers as an admin.
I've tried desperately for the past three years to gain enough
experience to qualify as an entry level to Junior level System
Administrator of a Unix/Linux System. Now, once again, PCC has
canceled a class on me and my financial aid is in danger of being
stripped away.

Is there anywhere I can take classes in Unix/Linux (200 level or
better) so I can prepare myself for the job market? 
Yes, if I had wanted work as an MS slug brain I could have done this
years ago, but I want to be better than that. 

Ed Sawicki, I'm damned upset with you and with Mike Neal.
I've wanted classes from both of you for over a year and I can't get
one damned class without having to wait six months to take it.

I even chose PCC because it had Dennis Heckman to learn from and now
he's retired. I'm so sick of this my health is starting to fail.

Now, here we sit, the cutting edge community of Linux users and
masters, and damned if we can get enough interest to teach a damned
class once a week? How the Hell am I supposed to learn how to set up
servers and tie in the telecom closet? 

I'm tired of being forced into the MS family of suckass software.
I'd rather go back to Welding and die from the damned fumes than to be
a MS monkey.

There has to be a way to train people in the use and set up of
linux/unix so that people are interested enough to take a class.

So, is there anyone running a unix/Linux system that would be
interested in teaching me or allowing me to volunteer for your company
so that I might gain the needed knowledge to be a Junior level
Unix/Linux System Admin? I'd even be willing to PAY to work, if I
could just learn what is needed.


Okay, I'm better. I've vented my disgust and anger.
Now I can face tomorrow without killing a MS user.

Any comments, hints or suggestions?


Thanks in Advance,

Harry Howard

Hi, 

Since the last round of budget cuts, PCC has been forced to raise the
minimum class size to cover costs.  Unfortunately this means scheduled
classes are cancelled at the last minute.  This term I'm scheduled to teach
Linux Networking and two sections of Linux Installation and Configuration,
one on-line.  The only class to make it is the on-line section of Linux
Installation and Configuration.  After being cancelled the last times,
we've dropped the Linux Security class.

I don't know what the problem is, poor marketing, not offering what our

Maybe Linux is getting so easy nobody needs to have classes available???

Sorry, all I can do is sympathize and feel your pain.  Sorry to hear he 
retired, he's about the best teacher, trainer, instructor I've ever had 
the pleasure to meet.  It's been 10 years and I still poignantly remember 
the computer science courses I went through.

Harry,

  There used to be linux certification courses, such as thosed offered by
SAIR, Linux Professional Institute, Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE) and
others. I would think that this sort of training and certification would be
more useful than an A.S. degree from a community college.

  Amazon.com has a couple of LPI books for sale (including used). Linux
Certified, Inc. may have something of value to you
<http://www.linuxcertified.com/>. Take a look at the LPI Web site:
<http://www.lpi.org/en/lpic.html>.

  Real-world experience probably counts for much more than does classroom
learning. Lots of options out there for the well motivated, and that
includes you. :-)

HTH,

Rich

I think most Linux users/admins are self-taught and use books, the
Internet, and each other to further their knowledge.  My advice if someone
is looking to do Linix/Open-Source work is to take ANY computer-related
job to build work experience and gradually introduce Free/Open-Source
software to your employer.

99% of cancellations happen because not enough people sign
up for the class to make a profit, or at least break even. Keep
in mind the the trainers are trying to make a living too. And trust
me when I say there's not much margin in the training business.
The last thing trainers need is to be dishing out expenses to teach
a class and not get it back in tuition.

As for offering an MS class as a substitute, I have no explanation
for that and won't bother trying to defend it. I guess they just offer
what they've got.

The best thing you can do is pool your demand for training. If you
can find other like-minded individuals and you all sign up for the
same class, you'll reduce the chances of it getting cancelled. Most
classes will go ahead if they reach break-even enrollment.

Most CS classes at PSU are taught on Sun or Linux machines.  (There's a
Windows lab, which I've used once for one class.)  You might have to
take CS 161/162/163 before the 200-level classes, but Karla will kick
your ass in C++ and it's well worth it.

EasyStreet is the only co-lo facility I've seen that seems to really
cater to smaller installations.  Most co-lo places will offer fractions
of a rack, but you'll share a single full-size cabinet with other
customers, which is kinda sucky.  EasyStreet actually has fractional
cabinets, so you're isolated from other people, which is pretty nice.

I think there's a significant difference between taking Linux/UNIX
classes and taking CS.

IMLE, CS tends to teach you only enough about the operating system to
get by, never enough to really excel outside of a code-writing job.

 -m     The  user?s home directory will be created if it does not exist.
        The files contained in skeleton_dir will be copied to the  home

        not create the directory and to not copy any files.

so the -k seems redundant 
-p passwd
              The encrypted password, as returned by crypt(3).  The
default is to disable the account

So you need to loop $password and $username 

Off course you can leave off -m if according to -M

-M     The user home directory will not be created, even if the  system
              wide settings from /etc/login.defs is to create home dirs.

of course group adding was a redhat thing:

     -n     A group having the same name as the user being added to the
system will be created by default. This option will turn  off  thisRed

Are you under the impression that I have any control at all
over how PCC schedules its courses?

I haven't taught a class at PCC in well over a year - maybe
two. Even though my name may be attached to PCC classes, PCC
either cancels it or tells me that a full-time instructor must
teach it. I usually learn that I'm not going to teach a class
about two weeks before the class - after I've reserved the time
and made preparations. Then I have to struggle to fill the void
with some billable hours. Now I find out that you're upset with
me. Perfect.

If you want to learn Linux, my company regularly offers classes
that we never cancel as long as we have at least 2 or 3 people.
The only problem is that we can't give you college credit. PCC
should contract out its classes to us and be done with the
problem.

We'll have our 2004 schedule updated on our web site this week.

Not sure if this is a stock command/program.  I use Linuxconf and it has a

Most Linux/Uinx admins that I know got all their training on the job. Of
course, the economy was better then, so you might have to try something
a little different. 

I've been running small networks of Suns and Linux and Windows since
about 1992 (not so much Linux in 92, since it wasn't production quality
then), and I think the Cisco certifications are a great place to start.
If you understand networking and troubleshooting, you have a strong
foundation. Then maybe Linux+ or server+ certification (MS-heavy, but
lots of generic stuff too) and some low-wage work to get experience and
you'll have a nice resume.

I'm not saying that a degree is a bad idea, just that Linux admins don't
usually have one that directly relates to their work. A degree in any
hard science will be very useful, though. 

Good luck!

I second that, Dennis was a great teacher.  The best I've had ever,
period.  I remember students telling me, "oh no, you're take CS 140U
with Heckman!"  I was pretty scared until I was in class and learned
otherwise.  I'm still plugging away at the C++ knowledge I gained from
the few classes I was able to take with him.  Wherever you are Dennis,
thanks!  :-)

My complaints with PCC, why they will never see another dime of my
money and why I have started voting against anything they put on the
ballot:

1) Tuition exceeds Portland State.  I'm closer to PSU than some PSU
   dorms.  Why drive if I don't have to?

2) Inadequate teaching staff.  Taking calculus in an overcrowded class
   in which the entire class and the teacher getting increasingly
   frustrated with each other because the teacher barely speaks
   English with a thick east-Indian accent that nobody understands
   isn't something anybody should have to pay for.

3) Abrasive personalities working the offices.  Seriously, the people
   who we have to deal with over the administrivia of getting a
   locker, enrolling, and paying tuition to should at least be
   friendly.  The counselors that help you pick classes could be way,
   way less patronizing as well.  If anybody outside the teaching and
   custodial staff at PCC is friendly, they're carefully hidden away,
   leaving only the most abusive, obnoxious, rude assholes dealing (I
   almost said "working," but that would imply they do more than get
   in the way) with the public.

This isn't something funding can fix.  This is what a real hiring
policy and *serious* organizational restructuring needs to fix.  Too
many cooks spoil the stew, PCC is a great example.  And you know it's
truly bad when *I* start sounding like a Republican.

Nope, not even really mad at you or Mike, just upset, that try as I
might, I keep getting the door slammed on my fingers by the very
College that supposedly wants me to take classes.

Okay, so I'm not upset any longer. I just REALLY wanted to take
classes from You, Mike Neal and Dennis Heckman. I sign for a class and
it gets canceled. But if I wanted to follow a MS track to stupidity,
hey, no problems with hours or classes. Just burns me up.

Please let me know if I would be welcome to come out and take these
classes, I don't care about the college credit so much as I want to
learn what I need to know. If it was just for the degree or credit,
then MS is as good as DOS or anything else.
Heck, I could get a degree in philosophy if all I wanted was a degree.

And I really want you to know it means a lot to me to hear from Both
you and Mike. 
I realize it is not your fault that politics rules education and the
highest bidder gets the points.
I want my cake an eat it too, I suppose.
I will always be looking for classes from you and Mike. I would rather
have either of you teach me to format and partition and re-build a
kernel than sit and listen to lectures on how MS is going to be the
only show in town.

Okay,
Let me take the time to both apologize for public venting and to thank
everyone here for their suggestions and comments.

I'd be happy for everyone's continued suggestions.
I'm going to take anything  I can get this term to help me both finish
my degree( 18 cr) and increase my knowledge of linux/unix.

Thanks to all of you Pluggers, for your continued ability to shine
light in a darkened room.

Thanks,
Harry Howard

I started going this way as well when I first learned that PCC was
moving away from Unix/Linux teaching. So, Yeah, I'm going to take the
Cisco classes as well as the FiberOptic classes because they make
sense to me to learn as an Admin. Heck, I think the fiberoptic should
be part of the CIS degree as well as the Cisco, but they make WAY to
much money if the school offers them separately.

The Degree is for me. I've wanted to finish it since I started in
1973, but just never had the right opportunity or reason to do it
until 2001. Now, I just want to finish and to be educated and useful
afterwards.

Don't take it personally.  Your name appeared on the schedule and
they're frustrated.  God knows cancelled classes is one of the things

This is when you start examining packets. Without a window into
the packet flow, you're/we're only guessing and taking a lot longer
to solve the problem.

That task is going beyond my current knowledge, but I'll jump in and do some learning.  Where does one start looking into the packets?

Digging into layer 2 and 3 isn't quite as simple as reading a howto and 
mastering the moment. I suggest that you hire out the work from someone 
that doesn't mind you shoulder surfing (pay attention and take notes, 
the lesson will be a valuable one). If you feel like you need to get a 
jump on the issue and want to try your hand you can look to 
tcpdump/ethereal and your favorite TCP/IP reference material (any layer 
2 reference would be good too but not likely to be helpful given the 
circumstances of your current problem).

Well, as a holder of a Bachelor of Fine Arts who started working with 
computers less than a year after graduation and then spent the bulk 
of my career with the beasts, I'd suggest that's not a bad idea. :)

As long as you set up a home network, line a bookshelf with O'Reilly and 
binders for what you print off the net, and get one of the certifications
so you can squeeze by the HR roadblocks.

We've had this discussion before. Many disciplines have a three-way
distinction between design, creation and maintenance:

  Architect           - Contractor      - Handy man
  Automotive designer - Plant Engineers - Mechanic
  Computer Scientist  - Programmer      - Sysadmin

Admittedly, the line is often blurry, but I'll stand by the
distinctions nonetheless.

The maintenance folks typically receive limited formal training; it's
mostly on-the-job stuff. That's why it's not uncommon to find
sysadmins with non-CS backgrounds (like me :-).

LPI offered the 101 & 201 tests for free at the last OSCON here in
town. They do this to spread the word about this Cert.

FWIW, I passed the 101 test without studying (500 out of 800, with 500
being the passing score). At the time I was doing NIC testing at Intel,
but my Xwindow & Linux install skills were a bit rusty.

What is tellingly unconscionable about Stream is that they are currently
paying less for new hires than the average (as in ``May I have your order
today?") call center.

Then again, most call centers in town aren't competing directly with
off-shore contractors who pay their employees a dollar an hour. Yet.

Having installed a more current version of Linux, I

software that formerly did not present difficulties
(gcc-3.3.1-24). Is this possible? If so, how can I

I think you're being a bit vague...  :-)

I installed this thing, and it doesn't do the thing I wanted it to.  Any
suggestions?

What version of 'Linux' did you install?  As in, what distribution and
version, although they really shouldn't matter too much.  "Current
version of Linux" doesn't narrow it down very much.  :-)

Yes, new GCC versions *can* present compilation difficulties.  They do
things just a little bit different, which can lead to problems.  IMHO,
GCC 3.2.3 is the one to stick with for now; it's what both Slackware and
Gentoo utilize which speaks volumes to me.

How to resolve it?  Install a different GCC version, perhaps?

By providing more details. :-)

It'd be nice to know

a. old distro and old gcc/glibc versions
b. new distro and new gcc/glibc versions

Besides books and classes, I also find a few Linux magazines to be quite
a good tutorial.  Linux Journal comes to my mind.  It
usually introduces concepts at a very beginning and practical level.
It will provide links so you can go and investigate further if you so 
choose.

You missed the announcement of MetroOne losing their ATT contract?

Their competative advantage was having call centers in the regions they serviced
so that, for instance, an operator would know that a Beaverton phone number might
be needed for a "Portland" request, but a Burns number was definitely wrong.

For example, Murtagh's pca.c is used for
principal-component analysis, and is easy to find on
the Web. Mandrake 9.0 uses gcc-3.1.1, and compiled it
without any comments:

gcc pca.c -o pcac

Borland's free C++ compiler for Windows also handles
it well. 

So now I'm using SuSE 9.0, gcc-3.3.1-24. What happens?

I'll definately second this nomination.  Last place I worked used to 
rent a partial
rack cabinet at EasyStreet.  The facility is clean and comfortable.  The 
network
connectivity and support staff are excellent.  Admittedly, the final 
clincher was
EasyStreet's location.  The former company was located out at Cornelius 
Pass Rd
and Sunset Hwy, and I live only a couple of miles (max.) from 
EasyStreet.  For
planned work, it was quicker than going all the way downtown.  And, if there
had been any midnight calls (there wasn't), I wouldn't even have to get 
on a freeway.

If you use EasyStreet for any other services, and need a co-lo, you 
certainly
want to consider their place.

Message-ID: <1073416221.23351.47.camel@dell.linux.box>

I'm getting sick of wlan-ng bigtime.  The lack of wireless extensions
just plain SUCKS.  The configuration setup for wlan-ng itself is a bit
cryptic... since it's in beta right now, their documentation is a bit
out of date, apparently, so I'm not even sure the location of the
configuration file being used.

Aside from the slightly better hardware support compared to the
in-kernel Orinoco driver, I see no reason at all to use these drivers. 
Unfortunately, the in-kernel driver doesn't totally jive with my
particular Prism2 card.

So I'm looking at the HostAP drivers, as was suggested on a webpage. 
The documentation doesn't seem to say if I can use these drivers as
regular wifi card driver or if I'll be stuck acting like a second access
point... which would be a bit pointless.  :-)

Are any of you out there using the HostAP drivers as regular standalone
drivers for your wifi card?  Anybody stumbled on a page devoted to this?

Thanks for any pointers...  :-)

I suppose it might be necessary to list out the files
in question and find out why the "parse errors" are no
longer allowed. It looks as if this could really be
sticky.

Message-ID: <1073417157.16137.24.camel@kat.zotnet.com>

CRIME meeting 13 Jan @10AM @ Zoo

Title:  ?How (and why) to build a Security Operations Center.? 

*Still the New Location*
First, another BIG Thanks to Structured Communication (www.structured.com) for
sponsoring the CRIME Meetings for the next year.  This allows us to meet
at our new location, The Oregon Zoo. 

*Back to old Time*
Second Tues, Dec 2nd.

Speakers:  Toby Kohlenberg, Intel

Title: How (and why) to build a Security Operations Center.

Topic: Over the course of 2002 and 2003, Mr. Kohlenberg was responsible
for the development and training of a Security Operations Center. This
talk provides a summary of the lessons learned over the course of that
work. Mr. Kohlenberg is a Senior Information Security Technologist for
Intel Corporation. He has experience in penetration testing, incident
response, architecture design and review, IDS, and various other things
that paranoid geeks are likely to spend time dealing with. In the last
couple years he has been responsible for developing security
architectures for world-wide deployments of secure WLANs, Windows
2000/Active Directory, and IDS technologies. He currently holds the
CISSP, GCFW, GCIH and GCIA certifications.


C.R.I.M.E. now meets at the Zoo.  The actual conference is TBA.

Directions:
To get to the Zoo (http://www.oregonzoo.org/) goto
http://www.oregonzoo.org/VisitorInfo/directions.html The Zoo is
available via Light Rail, Car, and bus.

The Conference rooms are located before the ticket taking entrance, but
past the main gates, so you do not need to buy a ticket.

Subject: [PLUG] apt vs rpm cheat sheet?
Message-ID: <20040106192629.GC1469@dalsemi.com>

I'm learning (and loving) apt-rpm, but every once in a while
I get stuck trying to do something in apt that I know how to
do easily in rpm (yes I know I can still use rpm to do it but
the goal is to do it in both systems.)

Does anyone have an rpm/up2date to apt cheat sheet?  Something along
the lines of:

list all packages	rpm -qa		apt-cache pkgnames
package information	rpm -qi		apt-cache showpkg
install a package	rpm -ivh	apt-get install **
update package list
update packages

** performs dependency resolution

If not, if people email back with ideas I'd be happy to coallate,
format(probably as HTML) and re-release them.  We could even include
yum or other package managers.

I'm using HostAP on all my wireless devices.  The distinction between being in
host mode, acting like an AP, or not is a run time configuration.

A lot of PLUG people will be there (cross over).  Toby used to be more
active in PLUG, but has not been able to make it recently.

I am interested if OSDL will be there.

As well as Linux Magazine, SysAdmin Magazine, Linux Weekly News in the pay

Journal (online version) and one of my all time favorites
PLUG at lists.pdxlinux.org  :-)

There is no cheat-sheet because the tools do slightly different things:
rpm is a back-end to apt. rpm operates on installed packages, and package
files which you have downloaded (it can also take a URL, but that only
automates the download). apt operates on the list of package records which
it caches.

So, if you want to know what packages are installed, there is nothing
better than rpm -qa. If you want to know about an installed package,
apt can't do any more than rpm -qi can do (it spits out more information
by default, but you can get all of that with rpm options like --provides
and --requires). However, apt-cache showpkg will do an effective "rpm -qi"
on a package you don't have yet. So if you want to know what would package
X do if you actually installed it, this will tell you.

Similarly, apt-get install will install package and its dependencies from
the repositories it knows about, while rpm -i will install a package from
a file or URL.

So there is no "mapping", you use apt and rpm for different purposes.

Man, would that ever be useful! As someone who is reasonably conversant
with RPM (currently running Mandrake 9.2) and who needs to get up to
speed on Debian, I *need* stuff like that.

Even so, I don't think it invalidates the idea.  Maybe there
should be a comparison for apt and up2date or something else.

How does it work on a Debian system?  Is apt a front-end for
another tool?

dpkg, AFAIK.

FWIW, emerge is a front-end for ebuild, AFAICT.

If you send me emerge/ebuild information, I'll add it too.

Just use epm (emerge epm). It looks and feels like rpm for emerge,

So thinking this was a good cause I outputted rpm --help into a file and
added what I thought was the apt commands.  I've cut and pasted it here,
and I've attached to preserve formatting.

some things to remember, as Fedor pointed out, apt is more of a way of
getting files packages, not an installer, or maintainer of packages.  In
redhat it is a transport mechanism for rpm.  I believe in debian its
dpkg/dselect.  So lots of rpm specific issues do not apply to apt.  The
same is true the other way.


Usage: rpm [OPTION...]

Query options (with -q or --query):
  -c, --configfiles                list all configuration files
  -d, --docfiles                   list all documentation files
*seems none*

  --dump                           dump basic file information
apt-cache dump

      dump   dump shows a short listing of every package in the cache. It  is
              primarily for debugging.

  -l, --list                       list files in package

apt-cache showpkg
       showpkg
              showpkg displays information about the packages  listed  on  the
              command  line. Remaining arguments are package names. The avail-
              able versions and reverse dependencies of  each  package  listed
              are  listed,  as  well as forward dependencies for each version.
              Forward (normal) dependencies are those packages upon which  the
              package  in  question  depends;  reverse  dependencies are those
              packages that depend upon the package in question. Thus, forward
              dependencies must be satisfied for a package, but reverse depen-
              dencies need not be.  For instance, apt-cache  showpkg  libread-
              line2 would produce output similar to the following:


  --queryformat=QUERYFORMAT        use the following query format
  -s, --state                      display the states of the listed files
*seems none*

  -a, --all                        query/verify all packages
       pkgnames
              This  command prints the name of each package in the system. The
              optional argument is a prefix match to filter the name list. The
              output  is suitable for use in a shell tab complete function and
              the output is generated extremly quickly. This command  is  best
              used with the --generate option.

  -f, --file                       query/verify package(s) owning file

*seems none*

  -p, --package                    query/verify a package file

*sorta* apt-cache search
      search search  performs  a  full  text  search on all available package
              files for the regex pattern given. It searchs the package  names
              and  the  descriptions for an occurance of the string and prints
              out the package name and the short  description.  If  --full  is
              given then output identical to show is produced for each matched
              package and if --names-only is given then the  long  description
              is not searched, only the package name is.

  --specfile                       query a spec file
*seems none*

  --whatrequires                   query/verify the package(s) which require a

  --whatprovides                   query/verify the package(s) which provide a
                                   dependency

*sorta* apt-cache showpkg

       depends
              depends shows a listing of each dependency a package has and all
              the possible other packages that can fullfill that dependency.



Verify options (with -V or --verify):
  --nomd5                          don't verify MD5 digest of files
  --nofiles                        don't verify files in package
  --nodeps                         don't verify package dependencies
  --noscript                       don't execute verify script(s)

                                   installed package headers

*seems none*  There are cache rebuilds, but that is a different beast.


Install/Upgrade/Erase options:
  --aid                            add suggested packages to transaction
  --allfiles                       install all files, even configurations
                                   which might otherwise be skipped
*seems none*
  --allmatches                     remove all packages which match <package>
                                   (normally an error is generated if
                                   <package> specified multiple packages)
apt-get install
       install
...
       If no package matches the given expression and the expression  contains
       one of ?.?, ??? or ?*? then it is assumed to be a POSIX regex and it is
       applied to all package names in the  database.  Any  matches  are  then
       installed  (or  removed).  Note  that  matching is done by substring so
       ?lo.*? matches ?how-lo? and ?lowest?. If this is undesired prefix  with
       a ?^? character.

       --force-yes
              Force yes; This is a dangerous option that  will  cause  apt  to
              continue  without prompting if it is doing something potentially
              harmful. It should not be used except  in  very  special  situa-
              tions.  Using  force-yes  can  potentially  destroy your system!

      upgrade

              currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in
              /etc/apt/sources.list.  Packages  currently  installed  with new
              versions available are retrieved and upgraded; under no  circum-
              stances  are  currently  installed packages removed, or packages
              not already installed retrieved and installed. New  versions  of
              currently  installed  packages  that  cannot be upgraded without
              changing the install status of another package will be  left  at
              their current version. An update must be performed first so that
              apt-get knows that new versions of packages are available.

              configuration  file.   Note  that  quiet level 2 implies -y, you
              should never use -qq without a no-action modifier  such  as  -d,
              --print-uris  or  -s  as APT may decided to do something you did
              not expect.  Configuration Item: quiet.

              the output is generated extremly quickly. This command  is  best
              used with the --generate option.

  -f, --file                       query/verify package(s) owning file
  -g, --group                      query/verify package(s) in group
*seems none*

  -p, --package                    query/verify a package file

*sorta* apt-cache search
      search search  performs  a  full  text  search on all available package
              files for the regex pattern given. It searchs the package  names
              and  the  descriptions for an occurance of the string and prints
              out the package name and the short  description.  If  --full  is
              given then output identical to show is produced for each matched
              package and if --names-only is given then the  long  description
              is not searched, only the package name is.

  --specfile                       query a spec file
*seems none*

  --whatrequires                   query/verify the package(s) which require a

                                   dependency

*sorta* apt-cache showpkg

       depends
              depends shows a listing of each dependency a package has and all
              the possible other packages that can fullfill that dependency.



Verify options (with -V or --verify):
  --nomd5                          don't verify MD5 digest of files
  --nofiles                        don't verify files in package
  --nodeps                         don't verify package dependencies

Signature options:
  --addsign                        sign package(s) (identical to --resign)
  -K, --checksig                   verify package signature(s)
  --import                         import an armored public key
  --resign                         sign package(s) (identical to --addsign)
  --nodigest                       don't verify package digest(s)
  --nosignature                    don't verify package signature(s)
*seems none*

Database options:
  --initdb                         initialize database
  --rebuilddb                      rebuild database inverted lists from
                                   installed package headers

*seems none*  There are cache rebuilds, but that is a different beast.


Install/Upgrade/Erase options:
  --aid                            add suggested packages to transaction
  --allfiles                       install all files, even configurations
                                   which might otherwise be skipped
*seems none*
  --allmatches                     remove all packages which match <package>
                                   (normally an error is generated if
                                   <package> specified multiple packages)
apt-get install
       install
...
       If no package matches the given expression and the expression  contains
       one of ?.?, ??? or ?*? then it is assumed to be a POSIX regex and it is
       applied to all package names in the  database.  Any  matches  are  then
       installed  (or  removed).  Note  that  matching is done by substring so
       ?lo.*? matches ?how-lo? and ?lowest?. If this is undesired prefix  with
       a ?^? character.


  --badreloc                       relocate files in non-relocateable package
  -e, --erase=<package>+           erase (uninstall) package

apt-get remove
      there are ways of installing during a remove with adding a +

  --excludedocs                    do not install documentation
  --excludepath=<path>             skip files with leading component <path> 
*seems none*

       --force-yes
              Force yes; This is a dangerous option that  will  cause  apt  to
              continue  without prompting if it is doing something potentially
              harmful. It should not be used except  in  very  special  situa-
              tions.  Using  force-yes  can  potentially  destroy your system!
              Configuration Item: APT::Get::force-yes.

  -F, --freshen=<packagefile>+     upgrade package(s) if already installed

*sorta, this is for all packages* apt-get upgrade

      upgrade
              upgrade  is  used to install the newest versions of all packages
              currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in
              /etc/apt/sources.list.  Packages  currently  installed  with new
              versions available are retrieved and upgraded; under no  circum-
              stances  are  currently  installed packages removed, or packages
              not already installed retrieved and installed. New  versions  of
              currently  installed  packages  that  cannot be upgraded without
              changing the install status of another package will be  left  at
              their current version. An update must be performed first so that
              apt-get knows that new versions of packages are available.

  -h, --hash                       print hash marks as package installs (good
                                   with -v)

Common options for all rpm modes:
  -D, --define='MACRO EXPR'        define MACRO with value EXPR

  --quiet                          provide less detailed output

apt-get 
       -q
 
       --quiet
              Quiet; produces output suitable for logging,  omitting  progress
              indicators.  More q?s will produce more quiet up to a maximum of
              2. You can also use -q=# to set the quiet level, overriding  the
              configuration  file.   Note  that  quiet level 2 implies -y, you
              should never use -qq without a no-action modifier  such  as  -d,
              --print-uris  or  -s  as APT may decided to do something you did
              not expect.  Configuration Item: quiet.

  -v, --verbose                    provide more detailed output
*apt is pretty verbose by default*

  --version                        print the version of rpm being used

apt-get
       -v

       --version
              Show the program version.

Message-ID: <1073424028.23573.8.camel@kat.zotnet.com>

[The traditional date tweak, somehow Dec 2nd cut back in]

CRIME meeting 13 Jan @10AM @ Zoo

Title:  ?How (and why) to build a Security Operations Center.? 

*Still the New Location*
First, another BIG Thanks to Structured Communication (www.structured.com) for
sponsoring the CRIME Meetings for the next year.  This allows us to meet
at our new location, The Oregon Zoo. 

*Back to old Time*
Second Tues of the month.

Speakers:  Toby Kohlenberg, Intel

Title: How (and why) to build a Security Operations Center.

Topic: Over the course of 2002 and 2003, Mr. Kohlenberg was responsible
for the development and training of a Security Operations Center. This
talk provides a summary of the lessons learned over the course of that
work. Mr. Kohlenberg is a Senior Information Security Technologist for
Intel Corporation. He has experience in penetration testing, incident
response, architecture design and review, IDS, and various other things
that paranoid geeks are likely to spend time dealing with. In the last
couple years he has been responsible for developing security
architectures for world-wide deployments of secure WLANs, Windows
2000/Active Directory, and IDS technologies. He currently holds the
CISSP, GCFW, GCIH and GCIA certifications.


C.R.I.M.E. now meets at the Zoo.  The actual conference is TBA.

Directions:
To get to the Zoo (http://www.oregonzoo.org/) goto
http://www.oregonzoo.org/VisitorInfo/directions.html The Zoo is
available via Light Rail, Car, and bus.

The Conference rooms are located before the ticket taking entrance, but
past the main gates, so you do not need to buy a ticket.

Do you have glibc-devel-2.3.2-87 installed?

Thank you

Thanks a lot, Zot.  As I'm wading through various manpages I was
understanding more of what Fedor (and now you) are saying.  apt/up2date
mainly handle transport (getting it here) and installation issues
(dependency resolution, ordering, etc.)  dpkg and rpm are for handling
a package (install it, remove it, verify it, query it) and handling the
set of installed packages.

I think what I'm going to do from here is this:

Figure out the set of commands that I most used and document them.

Publish that.

Add more information from your manpage mangling and other feedback
and repeat.

Thanks again!
Colin

Ironic. I finally got around to subscribing to that list today and
planned on going to the meeting next week. 

One confusing thing, though. On one page it says the meetings are at the
zoo (http://crime.whiteknighthackers.com/meetings.php3), and on another
page it says they're at the Verizon building
(http://crime.whiteknighthackers.com/directions.php3). 

So it'll be at the zoo, then? Good stuff

(www.structured.com) for sponsoring the CRIME Meetings for the next
year.  This allows us to meet at our new location, The Oregon Zoo. 

*Back to old Time*
Second Tues, Dec 2nd.

Speakers:  Toby Kohlenberg, Intel

Title: How (and why) to build a Security Operations Center.

Topic: Over the course of 2002 and 2003, Mr. Kohlenberg was responsible
for the development and training of a Security Operations Center. This
talk provides a summary of the lessons learned over the course of that
work. Mr. Kohlenberg is a Senior Information Security Technologist for
Intel Corporation. He has experience in penetration testing, incident
response, architecture design and review, IDS, and various other things
that paranoid geeks are likely to spend time dealing with. In the last
couple years he has been responsible for developing security
architectures for world-wide deployments of secure WLANs, Windows
2000/Active Directory, and IDS technologies. He currently holds the
CISSP, GCFW, GCIH and GCIA certifications.


C.R.I.M.E. now meets at the Zoo.  The actual conference is TBA.

Directions:
To get to the Zoo (http://www.oregonzoo.org/) goto
http://www.oregonzoo.org/VisitorInfo/directions.html The Zoo is
available via Light Rail, Car, and bus.

The Conference rooms are located before the ticket taking entrance, but
past the main gates, so you do not need to buy a ticket.

Thanks for the catch.  I forgot about that page.

Updated!

The talk should be worthy for big and small companies making decisions
about SOC and NOC facilities.

Subject: [PLUG] Fedora or not?
Message-ID: <BAY9-F41Eq80zU0KjRG0001711d@hotmail.com>

Dear All:

I have a Fedora question.

Between work and home, I have 2 RH 9 boxes and one Fedora boxes.
RH 9 are running just fine and the Fedora box is meant to investigate
how Fedora fairs.
So far, the last 1.5 months that I have been using Fedora, I am less
than happy.  Many applications crashed, including simple things such as 
Mozilla.
xine runs a lot better on RH 9 (no crashing) than Fedora...
The Fedora box is a PIII 700 MHZ with 128 MB of RAM.

Perhaps it will just be a matter of time before Fedora is more stable.
Should I bank on that?  Or should I go search for another distribution like
Debian or Slackware?   Or is it perhaps that I configure something wrong
on my  Fedora installation?

Yes. This reply does not preserve the context of the
original message, indicating that I'm having trouble
compiling pca.c, a factor-analysis program on SuSE 9.0
using gcc-3.3.1-24. Since then, I've compiled it
without error using Visual C++ (remember my posting
yesterday about dual booting?), and then downloaded
and installed Intel's C++ compiler, obtaining a.out
with that also. I think I'll put icc into my path; but
I could still use some insight into the original
problem.

I've been running Fedora for about a month with no problems.  Maybe you
have hardware issues?

I was having occasional Mozilla crashes as well with version 1.4 that came
with Fedora, so I upgraded to Mozilla 1.5 using RPMs directly from
mozilla.org. That was only a few days ago, but so far so good.

I have a Wiki where I keep stuff like this... There isn't much here, but
the link to Adam's page has more detailed info.  (I basically put stuff
up the /I/ have a hard time remembering.)

For reference, this all works fine on my SuSE 9.0 machine:

% uname -r
2.4.21-99-smp4G
% cat /etc/SuSE-release
SuSE Linux 9.0 (i586)
VERSION = 9.0
% rpm -qa | grep gcc
gcc-c++-3.3.1-24
gcc-3.3.1-24
libgcc-3.3.1-24
% gcc -lm pca.c -o pca
pca.c:650:3: warning: no newline at end of file
% ./pca
Syntax help: PCA filename #rows #cols option

(filename -- give full path name,
 #rows
 #cols    -- integer values,
 option   -- R (recommended) for correlation analysis,
             V for variance/covariance analysis
             S for SSCP analysis.)

I realize this does not directly help you.

Good luck,

Marc

Unless you want to study Linux.  Dennis and I met before I started 
at PCC back in 98 and he gave me quite s bit of crticism for wanting 
to specialize in Linux then.  He apologized, but it was a very
traumatizing experience.  As far as the accusations of poorly done math,
I'm getting my math at Rock Creek with grades I only dreamed of three
years ago.  Maybe he was talk, maybe he teaches programming well.
I was interested in risking a course with someone I could clearly
anger so easily for doing nothing more than stating vague interest
in a Linux focused computer science career.>

Karla knows her stuff, but she is angry and it shows through
the number of students failing.  Making programming torture in my
opinion doesn't help anyone.  I'm speaking as someone who passed 
the 202 midterms with flying colors, but couldn't get through 
a single programming assignment.  Karla needs to give clearer
assignments and perhaps even some hints.  Maybe if she does this, 
she won't lose as many students.  I recommend going through the
161,2,3 series with her, but I don't recommend 202.

Nobody wants to be risk being just a tech.  Linux is portrayed as
something you can only work with as a tech though.  Another problem
I see is that even some of the brightest engineers are ending up
under employed.  IBM has cut a lot of research programs at the top.  
If Ed wants to offer ALC press as a realistic avenue to get the
best education in the area with which to start a career as a
professional Linux administrator with, great.  

The local CS programs at PCC and PSU need to be overhauled anyways
though. The politics of Microsoft, or even O'Reilly dependency for 
that matter, ought to be questioned.  The less flexible a degree
is for specializing in various career fields, the less it can 
offer in the way of job security.  A degree is like a business 
contract, if you complete certain requirements the degree is 
awarded.  There needs to be an educational path for computer 
scientists who want to focus on Linux/Unix.  If it has to happen 
in the private sector first, so be it.  I see an AS as a good 
starting point before attempting a risky venture to bill oneself 
as a Linux specialist, that way you're halfway done with a 
traditional bachelors degree just in case all your efforts go 
South.

I don't know what Ed's or Mike's capacity is, what anyone interested
in Linux seems to need yesterday is politics 101 and basic understanding
of where things really are.  The notion of pursuing a professional
career without the focusing influence of a strong University or college
is not an appealing one, at least not to me.  Especially if your
credentials turn out to be solely your word, your work, and nothing 
more, the though of no degree is terrifying.  How are you going to get
your start?  What about advancement?  If there is a way to go from
an AS to a professional society through a strong apprenticeship program,
this is a less terrifying notion.

Intel has a C++ compiler for Linux that works for this
purpose (as you can see below). However, I understand
that the kernel can only be compiled with GCC, if one
has a need to do this. For reasons of compatibility, I
am still hoping to determine the source of the
problem.

Could you humor me and do a `rpm --verify glibc-devel-2.3.2` ?

Since my example shows that the GCC compiler shipped with SuSE 9.0 is NOT the
culprit, I'd expect there is something non-default about your build
environment.

What does the following package verification command give for an output?

    rpm --verify gcc glibc-devel

I have found Fedora to be very stable overall.  Some applications that
people might use might be a bit buggy, but it could just be that
application or the version thereof.

I've been very happy using Mozilla Firebird over Mozilla itself.  Some
people have problems with Firebird, but I have set up java and flash
plugins with it and using it heavily I haven't had it crash on me in the
two months or so I've been using it.
http://dag.wieers.com/packages/mozilla-firebird/mozilla-firebird-0.7-1.rhfc1.dag.i386.rpm

The addition of Yum, and using various yum repositories has made adding
optional packages to Fedora a breeze (mplayer, wine, etc).  It's as
simple as going 'yum install <packagename>' and 'yum update'.  Here are
some places you can get yum to work with:
http://dag.wieers.com/apt/
http://www.fedora.us/
http://rpm.livna.org/
http://freshrpms.net/
http://newrpms.sunsite.dk/
http://atrpms.physik.fu-berlin.de/

Albeit, there are not as many different packages available at these
sites as Debian has in their apt repositories, but Fedora will get there
eventually.

Cheers,

Daniel

Avoid running anything like this outside of Linux unless you have a 
whole bunch of really crypt-ick named profiles. See man useradd in 
Solaris for more details. Of course, Karla did only ask about Linux but 
I think that it's worth mentioning the portability point since the 
subject is automating mass useradd's.

Apparently there are some things missing that are
supposed to be there. I wonder how it got that way?
Since rpm -q glibc-devel returns a value, this puzzles
me. I'm not quite sure what to do, except to try to
find these packages on the Web; perhaps the ones on
the CD are defective.

Subject: Israeli government suspends purchases of Microsoft software

The Israeli government has become the latest national government to seek
open-source alternatives to Microsoft's productivity software, citing
cost as a major motivating factor. "The move with Microsoft was a purely
economic decision," says a Finance Ministry spokeswoman. "The Israeli
government will not be purchasing new products from Microsoft, but will
implement its contract to secure existing systems. On a policy level,
the government is committed to expanding computer use. We want open
source technology to spread, so more people will be able to afford
computers." The Finance Ministry has been working with Sun Microsystems
and IBM to create a Hebrew language version of OpenOffice software, an
open-source alternative to Microsoft Office. Some federal agencies in
France, China and Germany, as well as the city government in Munich,
have switched over to Linux-based servers and individual workstations.
Other governments exploring open source alternatives include those in
Britain, Brazil, Japan, South Korea, China and Russia. Governments
account for about 10% of global information technology spending,
according to IDC.  [AP/*USA Today*, 31 Dec 2003; NewsScan Daily, 31 Dec

Thank you Michael and Russell, I appreciate the input.

I had a few minutes, after ripping all the ice off of our vehicles, and
decided to just download 'em and give them a shot.  Good to go.  I
started about twenty minutes ago... including compile time and
configuration (took me a few minutes before I realized wireless.opts
still had WEP on it from pre-wlan-ng while I had been forced to disable
it on the AP due to wlan-ng not wanting to work with WEP for me)... and
I'm back up and running in MUCH better shape than before.

Wireless Extensions!!  I love them.  They feel all warm and fuzzy.  :-)

I HATE wlan-ng and hope I never need to go back to it!

One thing needing improvement in Linux is hardware testing - it may well
be that the older PIII 700MHz hardware is starting to flake out.  Sadly,
most motherboards are not designed to last more than a couple of years
these days.  Or it may be that Fedora is indeed at fault, or there is
a configuration problem.  You can only tell by comparison testing the
different software with similar hardware.  Perhaps you still have the
old hard drive with RH9 on it so you can compare.

I have been running Fedora on my server since 2 days after the release,
(upgraded from RH9) and I am reasonably pleased with it.  I have seen
nothing screwy that was not screwy before. 

One thing that IS important is that much of Fedora is compiled with a
newer version of gcc.  This affects the versions of plugins that are
compatable for Mozilla, for example.  If you use the newer Mozilla
and the older Java J2RE, for example, it crashes.  I imagine  xine 
will have similar issues with plugins.

Fedora development will probably be a lot more agressive and bleeding
edge than Debian.   RedHat's strategy for Fedora is the same as for
their boxed distros, only more so:  as a testbed for apps that eventually
stabilize in the Enterprise products.  Think "late beta".  Fedora is
where RedHat pours their development effort;  after most of the bugs
go away they include the upgrades in Enterprise.  This does not mean
they are spreading bugs willy-nilly - they are interested in upgrading
Enterprise with stable code as fast as they can, and they would prefer
that stability develops as quickly as possible within Fedora.  After
all, bugs in Enterprise cost them a lot more money to deal with than
bugs in a distro they do not sell support for.  

As some have pointed out, they will focus more attention on the bugs
in Enterprise than on bugs in Fedora.  But that is because dealing
with a bug in a shipped product is a lot more expensive and time
consuming than dealing with a bug in development code, where they
are not expected to handhold zillions of customers through a code
update.  It is in their best interests to make sure that the code is
clean and widely tested before it makes it into Enterprise.  Thus,
they can get more leverage out of investing in Fedora development,
rather than mid-release Enterprise fixes and their attendant user
support costs.  As someone who wants more development and less
handholding (I have this group for the handholding :-) ) I agree
with their choice, even if it means that I suffer from more bugs.

If you want the latest stuff,  like a the latest version of Open Office
or the latest device drivers, then Fedora is your distro.  If you want
stable and free (as in beer), consider Debian stable.  If you want
stable and want to pay for support, consider SUSE.  I don't know about 
Slackware, though there are plenty here that are willing to educate me.

Personally, I like Fedora, don't like SUSE as much, and would consider
Debian if I had time to learn its peculiarities and had the time to
retune my system.  If some of my closed-source CAD tool vendors move
to a different distro (most support RH9 now) I will probably move to
that distro myself.  At the end of the day, I choose distros based on
what lets me get the job done.

Message-ID: <OMEBINHFEBMFOKIAIEADCEMHCLAA.bl.nordlund@verizon.net>

I have been trying to get an application to run.  Unfortunately, it is a
commercial application that you are just supposed to untar and run.  Since
they want money, of course I don't have the source.

The name of the application is weather-display (www.weather-display.com) and
their last couple of releases include Linux versions (it has been a Windows
package for some time now).  I have already tried about six different GPL
programs for logging my weather station data and uploading it to
wunderground, but they all have one problem or another so I wanted to try
this commercial one.


Their elaborate install directions are as follows:


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Install Instructions
--------------------

Very Simple. Just unpack this tar ball into you home dir.
It must be your home directory for now.
Thats it !!

Running Weather Display
-----------------------

Just cd ~/kylix
then ./GoWeatherD
thats it.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Well, of course that's not "it".  First off, GoWeatherD is not the name of
the script, and it's installed in ~/wdisplay not in ~/kylix (and I don't
know who kylix is anyway).

The main issue I am having is that when it runs, I get the following error
message:

./WeatherD: /lib/libc.so.6: version 'GLIBC_2.3" not found (required by
/home/brian/wdisplay/deploy/libstdc++-libc6.1-1.so.2

My initial reaction was to try and upgrade my glibc 2.2.x to 2.3.x but I
have now read numerous horror stories about trying this.  I am running
Mandrake 8.2 and am using this as a server for everything.  I am not about
to risk crashing it just to try this stupid little program.

I am assuming there is some degree of commonality between different versions
of glibc.  Is there any way to spoof the program to use the old glibc and
see if it works?  If not, are there any other fool-proof (yes I'm the fool)
ways to set this thing up to work so I can try the program out?

Thanks,
Brian.

Upgrading glibc is an invasive, extensive procedure.  Unless you want to
tinker (which it sounds like you don't), I would recommend either
punting or upgrading the whole distro.

FWIW: I was using Mandrake 9, and was having various problems with my CD

I installed Fedora last week, and so far I am pretty happy with it. My 
CD rom drive problems have been resolved. Only thing that has crashed is 
Kuickshow, and it only crashes on exit. No problems with Mozilla. I AM 
having a heck of a time to get Xine installed and running, but I am 
thinking that is me, I need to spend some more time with the Xine docs 
and less time with FreeCiv.

I read that the main issue is that they're POed at MS for not
providing decent Hebrew support in Mac Office (perhaps to force them
to switch to Windows?).  They kept complaining, and MS didn't do
anything.  This switch is just the typical consequence of blowing off
your customers for too long.  Probably the cost savings is just their
politicians trying to score points with their own taxpayers.  (I mean,
they could just go to Congress for more foreign aid to buy the MS
licenses if cost were the only issue.)

There could also be security concerns.  They're more worried about
security in general (not without reason) -- for instance, for decades
El Al was doing the kinds of things the NTSB is trying to set up now
in this country.  And they've never been hijacked.

I would never describe Karla as "angry", I would call her "excited"

teachers PSU has.

Subject: [PLUG] Flaky compiler? Summary
Message-ID: <20040107065859.57699.qmail@web9608.mail.yahoo.com>

My gcc compiler apparently will not work due to
missing header files. Interestingly enough, what seems
to be critical is a file, libbonobo-devel, that cannot
be installed from the SuSE CD's or by FTP. The
installation "fails" in either case.

I was able to install Intel's C++ compiler from
.rpm's. It is not, however, completely interchangeable
with the gcc compiler.

I may have to accept limitations in software
development as a permanent feature of this
installation, unless I can determine how to install a
functioning gcc compiler. (The rpm for SuSE's latest
version of gcc needs libbonobo, and I can't compile
gcc from source, unless the Intel compiler will do it.)

Yeah, sorry about the length. I may of have gotten a bit
carried away. . .

Does someone have a link to "plug achievements over its
history" or something similar (besides the FAQ)?
I'd just like some points to put down when asking to borrow
a projector for the meetings; something that lets people
know that we aren't just a bunch of geeks sitting around and
chatting about the latest release over email, but are
actually out there, involved in the community, actively
helping and educating people who have a genuine thirst for
knowledge.
A bit over the top? Perhaps. But I've been subscribed to
plug for the last 2 years or so and I've seen a ton of stuff
come into my inbox, but I think the general attitude is that
people don't recognize how many people they actually help,
and how valuable their input is not only to the person on
the other end of the email, but also to the community.
Sure, somebody might answer a question or two on the mailing
list once in a while, but I don't think we as a community
realize how valuable the list, meetings and install fests
are and how big of a role they, as a whole, play in the
computing community in Portland Or.
We have a ton of experts (or at least experienced people, I
wouldn't want to insult you folks by putting you in the same
group as someone like Dvorak) in many fields - and can
educate people not only on the latest Linux distro, but on
everything from basic computer hardware and microcontrollers
to teaching kids to program and even helping people with
stuff that most of us despise - like using outlook and
exchange. We are not only experienced, but also hold jobs
(well, hopefully) in the IT sector and many of us are
involved in making purchases for your company's IT
departments.
Plug is probably the most active / biggest user group in
Portland (it might be the mac folks) and we are also free.
We give advice to anyone who asks and welcome the entire
community to come to our meetings. I'm not necessarily
looking for some text on a page but testimonials from folks
that we've helped out in the past and pics of mass installs
/ clinics. Numbers are great - too. I have no idea how many
emails have actually been posted to the list or how many
active emails, but I'm sure we are well into the thousands.

When you look at it, other community groups get things /
grants etc for much less - I'm not saying that we are
entitled to anything, but we should strive to make a more
people recognize the value of what we do. What goes around
comes around, but sometimes it needs a bit of help ;)

Anyways. . . . (/steps off soapbox)

Thanks in advance.
Karol.

I second that. IMNSHO the number of students failing simply represents
people finally realizing they're in the wrong major.

Are they bonkers? The **only** valid reason I could see for such a
dependency is if they had some fancy wrapper for the compiler. Which
should be in its own package anyways.

Message-ID: <20040107074525.54803.qmail@web9607.mail.yahoo.com>

According to Intel, "As a demonstration of
compatibility with gcc, Intel C++ 7.0 compilers for
Linux have successfully built and run the Linux
kernels, version 2.4.18, on IA-32 and Itanium
processors using a limited number of temporary source
patches." (I have an Athlon processor, however.)

Intel has benchmarking software available for those
wishing to compare their C++ compiler with gcc. In my
case, of course, it's a knockout, with gcc not working
at all. With the Intel compiler, the loop count in the
source test code has to be increased because it's so fast.

Out of curiosity, how did you zero in on this package?

How did you perform the installs, and what were the errors?

Robert's post isn't correct. I'm not sure why he is having issues but if
he cares to post the errors he was seeing, I'm sure they will be able
to be straightened out.

Your Athlon processor is IA-32.  Besides, the 2.4 kernel series only
optimizes up to i686... there are no PII/III/IV/Athlon/AthlonXP
optimizations available without patching the kernel (I think it was like
ten lines of code, very easy, I was able to do it without a patch file).

Is ICC free?  If it works well, I may just recompile a decent portion of
my Gentoo system with it... I'm always looking for speed boosts.  :-)

Along these lines, does anyone know of any (unofficial, of course) 'rate 
the prof/course' sites for PSU?  I'm working on a Masters in ECE at PSU.  
It would be nice to know which courses you can take with other courses in 
a given term.  Some classes eat all of your time and end up being 
'fulltime' in themselves.  Others have a light enough workload such that 
you could take two or three of them in a quarter without difficulty.  The 
problem is trying to figure out which is which in a given quarter.  It 
would be nice if they rated classes by workload difficulty on the official 
website, but that's not likely, so I'm wondering if anyone has put 
together some sort of unofficial site for this.

It's made available for "free" on about the same basis
as Kylix, for example. The source code is not
available, and you can't sell any binaries made with
the non-commercial version. (They DO provide a limited
amount of technical support for the free version,
although it's not as good as for paid users.)

Neutral reviewers think the Intel compiler is about
20% faster on the Pentium IV, more for some tasks. And
it may make more compact code.  You have to weigh this
against the time involved in learning to use a new
product.

Some time today I'm going to repeat the steps involved
in trying to install GCC once I discovered that it was
non-functioning. Perhaps others have had similar
problems, at least with rpm-based distributions.

I've had considerable experience with the Intel compiler, but only its C++
part, not straight C. While it generates fast code, it does not always
generate correct code. I've also ran into some C++ code which makes it
croak and dump core.

Plus, all icc-produced binaries are linked against the Intel runtime
libraries, so you've either got to put their lib/ directory in your
/etc/ld.so.conf file or do something like

  -Wl,-R/opt/intel/compiler70/ia32/lib

with every build.

There's a lot to this approach. I find I can make my code *much* faster
if don't worry so much about having it do the right thing. This opens up
many possibilities for some very effective optimizations.

Like you really didn't want to multiply those two large matrices, you

If it's being sold as an AV solution for Linux as they sell AV software
for Windows... it's snake oil.

If it's being sold as an all-in-one mail scanning solution, you have to
ask why you'd want to pay $200 for something that is available for free
already.  (Free as in AMaViS/ClamAV or AMaViS/F-Prot if non-commercial)

IIRC, Trend Micro does sell a Linux product, but when last I talked to
their head of training, the company was re-focusing... only looking for
100+ license deals, not looking for small-time contracts.  He was in
Oregon about a year ago, FWIW.

I'm not running mine in any mode other than AP, couldn't you just put 
one on a subnet too small for more than two hosts?  I'm thinking
some_private_range/31 CIDR mask.

Getting the same ad-hoc mode on multiple hosts isn't something 
I've figured out yet.

I've played around some with WEP but haven't gotten it to work either.
I wonder about AES and is it TKIP?  There are two other security
options.  All in all external encryption is probably a better 
choice.

Are you using wireless extensions 16?  I had to grab the source and
copy a certain header, wireless.h, to /usr/include.  

There's iwconfig wlan0 mode ad-hoc, how do you get the client into 
the same ad-hoc mode though?  I've never gotten an ad-hoc connection
to work, even with the hostap driver.  One difference I have noticed
with the hostap driver is that my SMC2632/2602W comes up as an 802.11b
card running at 11 mb.  I couldn't do ap mode with the kernel driver,
so I never got a link up using it.

I'd think ap to ap is valed.  An ap point seems analogous to a hub
in wired ethernet.  Does using WEP require an AP?  How about TKIP?
AES?

You misunderstand... I was complaining about wlan-ng not having wireless
extensions support.  They only have a little bit of read-only type
support, nothing like what I was used to with in-kernel atmel drivers.

IIRC, I am using wireless extensions 16, although it may be 14.

I'm not using ad-hoc, I have an access point.  Why would you want to set
things up ad-host if you're using hostap drivers, in the first place?

The kernel drivers, AFAIK, don't support ap mode... that's a hostap
thing.

I think there is a way to connect multiple APs together, although I'm
not sure how that works.  I don't feel like figuring it out, either.  I
am pretty sure APs can be set up as repeaters, essentially... but I'm no
expert.

WEP does not require an access point.  It's just basically a form of
encryption.  I haven't read about TKIP or AES (I thought AES was an
encryption algorithm?), so cannot really comment on their needing an
access point or not.

Jerry Kissick is excellent over at Rock Creek.

3)  Abusive personalities...

Well if there are abusive personalities in an institution
where the institution is accredited and the reputation
of these people is well known, you're degree can look even
better.  An educated person is one thing, a person who
got the mark of education in a hostile environment is even
more interesting.  Politics is a broader issue where a breakdown
of trust between the public and public institutions of higher
learning funding requests is probably as much to blame for 
nasty staff as anything else.  Education needs stable funding 
and there needs to be a sober discussion of what the funding 
level needs to be at.  IT costs have been mushrooming and 
there is some question as to whether or not administrators are 
getting over paid.  Another question is how much overhead is
appropriate compared to how much today's public schools, colleges,
and Universities have?  

PCC is a unique institution because it has so many missions 
ranging from high school equivalency programs, to helping 
battered woman, to providing transfer programs accepted at 
4 year Universities, to various technical and vocational 
programs, and even naturalization of new citizens.

Another mission of PCC is to address PSU's overcrowding
problems.

I could have signed up for Linux Network Admin II but didn't, 
I would like to see it become a requirement for the CIS program 
at PCC.

Is Clam AV simply a foundation on which to add other virus scanners

There has been some comment that all Windows 98 user should replace

has evidently had trouble with XP.  The user structure is significantly
different I suspect in XP.  

When it comes to software platforms,  what objectively do Linux and
Mac OS lack, if anything, that make XP worth having?

I recently filled out an aid request on the fafsa.ed.gov site where
I was dismayed that they don't even list MacOS X recommendations,
only recommendations to use IE or Netscape under Windows.  I 
ignored them choosing to use mozilla under Linux and it worked.
If having a fafsa.ed.gov site is a convenience thing it behooves

It looks as if that's still in the future. The
offender is glibc-devel, which is reported to be
installed (rpm) but has some header files missing.

It wouldn't install from the CD, probably because it
was already installed. I downloaded a slightly newer
version from SuSE's mirror, but there were complaints
about "conflicts."

The same for libbonobo. I thought about eliminating
the installed version, but this would leave some
dependencies, and I was not confident enough about
what I was doing to use the "nodeps" option. 

This is really an issue about how to work with rpm's
in difficult situations, so advice about this matter
would be appreciated.

I was screwing around on the sans site and came across a ssh webcast
that mentioned these two nifty little utilities. Check out the examples
on the link below. 

http://www.stearns.org/fanout/README.html
Fanout and fanterm are two utilities that allow you to run commands on
multiple machines. The difference is that fanout only runs
non-interactive commands (like dd, cat, adduser, uname -a, etc.) and
pipelines built of these. The output is collected into a single display
that can be viewed by less or redirected to a file.

Fanterm, on the other hand, allows you to run interactive text mode
commands on multiple machines at the same time. Your keystrokes are sent
to a shell or application running on each of the target systems. The
output from each system is shown in a seperate xterm.

cheers,
Sasha

Dunno- have XP, 2000, NT, 98 and OSX all running SMB here and no problems
at all.

Games.  So far gaming is superior on win32.  And in my experience you may
be left waiting for decent driver support for the new 3d cards on Linux,
although that seems to have improved.
I just got a Powerbook and am very pleased thus far.  It has some annoying
UI quirks, but I believe the hardware support (for the few things that are
reported to be supported on OSX) will be excellent.  So far office works
fine, as does SMB and printing is based upon CUPS which is great.  For
example, I cannot get my XP machine to print to my HP 832C connected to an
NT4 server due to some stupid driver issue.  The MAC and Linux machines
work fine.

I just poked around for a brief moment on that site with Safari (the
default OSX browswer) and it was both speedy and everything seemed to work
well.  I think it is based upon the Konqueror (sp?) engine??  Could be
wrong on that.

Interesting ideas.

It's a very interesting one.

Hmm, I'd argue on the last line of the breakdown for computer folks.  
Scientists do research.  Materials scientists (such as chemists and some 
physicists and the few real materials scientics) do research on existing and 
new materials.  Eventually, their findings become part of the "playbook" for 
the designers/architects.  An aviation architect/designer works around the 
available materials.

Computer scientists seem to fall in a couple of categories:

1) they're really math people, i.e. crypto folks.

2) they're really working on engineering, i.e. the pattern design people, the 
XP people etc.

3) they're doing basic research, i.e. algorithms, new programming paradigms 
etc.  It is very rare that someone is actually doing something truly new 
these days.

I'd argue that the last line should read:

Software/systems Architect - Programmer - Sysadmin

Of course, since I have a degree in software design/architecture, I feel it is 
a meaningful distinction :-)  My professional experience tends to show that 
there is a difference as well, but that it is not well understood and not 
well acknowleged.  Programmers are just supposed to learn how to be 
designers/architects along the way.  That was true in some other disciplines 
too, but not for a long time in most cases.  This is not to downplay the 
value of a skilled person in the programming (or carpentry field) at all!    
The best architects/designers in most fields started on the creation end of 
things and ended up as architects.  Then, they understand the constraints of 
the discipline and can apply that to the design.

As a former carpenter (not for long), I was in awe of the guys (there were 
very few women in the field at the time) who really knew what they were 
doing.  The architect could give the barest sketch and they'd build a thing 
of beauty that would be on time, use the available materials and would be 
stable and safe.  And, there are certainly architects who will lay out 
buildings that are amazing to look at, but are nearly impossible to build or 
are just plain unsafe. Frank Lloyd Wright was known for doing bad roofs.  He 
even said so.  Many of his buildings need much more maintenance than they 
should due to leaks and bad detail design.

I find that the mindset is really what distinguishes people in the different 
aspects of the work.  Big picture people tend to gravitate more toward 
architecture.  This is, of course, a huge generalization :-)

Interesting approach of breaking stuff into design/creation/maintenance.  I 
like it!  I think it should be four-fold instead of three:  research/design/
creation/maintenance.  And, I think you are definitely right, a surprizing 
number of disciplines fit into those four slots very well.

Best,
Kyle

Uhhh... no.... take a look at it.

It's a full antivirus program (daemonized and non-daemonized scanning)
for Linux, primarily used to scan for nasties on things passing through
a server (file or mail, mainly?).

I would hope not; these things aren't meant to protect your linux

doesn't mean there are none though.

Yeah, that's probably more accurate. I was trying to devise a
vocabulary for someone who does the computing equivalent of
traditional architecture. I didn't realize that I could just use
'architect' and have it fit. :-)

*nod*

The three-way (or, in your thinking, four-way) is much more observable
in large, bureaucratic companies where there are Project Managers who
tend to deal with larger design issues and Programmers who are
primarily concerned with implementing their decisions.

There's still some truth in it. I think there are some other
dimensions as well:

* Designers are typically more likely to enjoy the rough and tumble of
  decision making in a social setting. Designers, at least in the
  corporate world, are far more likely to be meeting-bound than the
  creators or maintainers. There's good reason for that, of course:
  designers are the ones who typically have to negotiate with clients
  or upper management.

* Designers are more likely to have gotten an early start on their
  vocation, especially as regards formal training. That less true, I
  suppose, in a new field like CS than it is in traditional ones like
  architecture. There's always room for the guy who starts at the
  bottom, but they're the minority.

Maybe do an lsattr on /usr/include/asm/pgtable.h, is it immutable?
Does the rpm your installing pass a verification test?  Did you
su to root?  If so do an su - before trying to force reinstallation
of glibc-devel.

Your filesystem is probably hosed. Try removing the offending header file
(as root), the error message you get may suggest what's wrong. Do ls -l,
see what the permissions are.

Maybe so, but it's still more stable than Windows on

I've never seen anything like this before. Have you?
Should I remove all of them? I think I'll go ahead
with it, but it would be nice to get a little more
advice before proceeding, if it is forthcoming. By the
way, the dates on the first two are BEFORE the system
was installed; and the rest of the dates are today's
date, about two weeks after installation.

I had two files in /tmp that I could not delete once. If I tried it
would make the box reboot. I tried fscking the file system and then
deleteing them and it would reboot. I tried booting from a rescue cd and
removing them, reboot. I finally formated the partition again to get
ride of them. I have know idea as to why.

Thank you

You need to run e2fsck on the filesystem.

Network Security... yes... but not Linux security.  If it is a network

I would assume from the title (highlighted above) that it's Network
Security as from the perspective of using Linux tools. It could
possibly be a class only about networks of only Linux boxes, but I'd
think that would be a misnomer. It could be about securing Linux for
the network, but I'd think that'd be a pretty short class. ;-)

 how do you check for specific features supported in the kernel?
 let's say you're installing Quota-and it requires some kernel patches
 how do you check if they are already applied?

2.6 introduced an option to make the kernel config available in /proc...
it may or may not have been backported to 2.4.

Other than that, I don't think there's a standard way to check and see
how the kernel was compiled.  If it's a distribution's kernel, you
should be able to find the .config file under /boot or somewhere equally
obvious.  Otherwise... find out what exactly the patch does.  Odds are
pretty decent it does something in /proc you can check for.  If it
doesn't do anything you can detect, you may be SOL...

Try to apply them again and see if they bounce. It's patching
sources--there's no formal system for "registration" (although
Debian's make-kpkg does, if you use packaged patches). 

You could also look at your .config to see if the configuration
variables exist for the features you want, but this assumes you know
the variable names (which are not the same as the menu entries). Or
look at the source itself.

I think "re-patching" would be best. It'll stop and prompt you if it
thinks the patch is already there.

Always remember to have multiple copies of your kernel in its various
patch stages in case you had to fudge .rej files back into the
source or if you had patched to various successful stages and want to
fall back (and can't remember how you got there). This is all from
bitter experience, btw. ;-)

How is the 2.6 kernel as far as stability and developement coming?
What are the minimum requirements to go from 2.4.23 to a 2.6 kernel?

2.6.0, IMHO, is quite stable.  I'm waiting until 2.6.3 or 2.6.4 before I
upgrade my server, however, to let additional fixes filter through. 
I've been running 2.6 on my laptop since test5 was released ... the only
kernel-related crashes (non-nvidia-related crashes) since then were
under 2.4.x.

AFAIK, the requirements, hardware-wise, for 2.6.0 are lower than for
2.4.x with that 'embedded' option and the 'tiny' patches. 
Software-wise, you need module-init-tools instead of modutils and a /sys
directory for sysfs.

A lot of times the module or thingy will create an entry in /proc.

For instance, wondering if scsi got compiled in?  Look for /proc/scsi

Not that this always works....

>  let's say you're installing Quota-and it requires some kernel patches

Well I think the default redhat config uses quota

        grep -i quota /usr/src/linux-2.4/configs/kernel-2.4.20-i686.config 
        CONFIG_QUOTA=y

So yep....
        find /proc/ | grep quot
        /proc/sys/fs/quota
        /proc/sys/fs/quota/syncs
        /proc/sys/fs/quota/free_dquots
        /proc/sys/fs/quota/allocated_dquots
        /proc/sys/fs/quota/cache_hits
        /proc/sys/fs/quota/writes
        /proc/sys/fs/quota/reads
        /proc/sys/fs/quota/drops
        /proc/sys/fs/quota/lookups

I do not have a system I can look that I am sure quota is not on.

On a mandrake 2.2 kernel the above find did not work, but config shows
quota on.

You can't, at least not in any cool scriptable way. It's been a
consistent request: a way to poll a running kernel for its config
values. There was some rumbling about getting that sort of thing in
2.6, but afaik you're out of luck in kernels <= 2.4.x

     ("remote-host2" (system "/usr/bin/ssh remote-host2 bin/remote/run_xterm &"))))

where bin/remote/run_xterm is just a shell script adapted to the local
requirements for getting an xterm, usually just something like: 

  #!/bin/sh
  exec /usr/bin/X11/xterm [various options]

The *root-menu* form is just a lisp form that is interpretted by
sawfish's menu infrastructure to generate labels and execute
associated code based on user interaction.

However, when the ssh keys aren't all kosher, my window manager
freezes up.  Looking at the virtual terminal where I launched X, I see
it asking me to type a password or confirm I want to connect to a new
host, etc.  However, typing there doesn't help and basically I am
hosed.  I "have to"[1] kill X to recover.  I have learned about this
particular landmine and am usually careful to avoid it[2], but (having
just stepped on it again last night) I would really like to figure out
the _real_ solution.  Anyone know how to get ssh to behave itself, by
asking in a way I can provide the right answer, or otherwise save me
from nuking my X session every time I hit the mine?

[1] "have to" here means I haven't figured out a better way.  I'd
    prefer to think I am just inadequately clued and that this post
    will elicit the required clue.

[2] by first confirming that I can slogin to the host without any
    keyboard interaction.

    Due to the extremely BAD BAD BAD weather conditions in the
Portland area, we are cancelling the January PLUG Meeting.
I'm hoping to reschedule Chris Jantzen's <chris at Maybe.net>
presentation on User Mode Linux on Thursday Feb 5, 2004.

    This is the first time we have ever cancelled the monthly
general meeting.  However, we had to postpone the meeting for
New Year's day - and the current weather conditions are truly
exceptional.  Postponing the meeting again would put us too
close to the Advanced Topics Meeting, the Clinic, etc.

So why not 
 
("remote-host1" (system "/usr/bin/X11/xterm -e ssh remote-host1")

do you really need to use the xterm on the remote? 


To do it your way

"remote-host1" (system "/usr/bin/ssh -fX remote-host1
     bin/remote/run_xterm")

This should prompt for the password if needed

Can't you just go to vtty2 and kill the ssh to the other host. 

Thank you

What about just launching a local XTerm and have it log in to the remote
server?  It seems to me that would be *a lot* easier on bandwidth and
latency.  It seems to me that would give you the same abilities... with
fewer compatibility issues and lower overhead.

The issue with quota is there is a new version that requires a raft of kernel 
patches. http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Quota.html  

I'm pretty sure none of my systems have been patched, but it got me to 
wondering if there was a way to find out for certain, without actually 
applying the patches.

I dunno.  I'm trying to integrate postfix with MailScanner.  It says
it's virus scanning though I'll have to probe a bit to see if it's set
properly to use Clamav.  Apparetly it can use spamassassin directly.

+1

I auto-generate my xfce desktop menus with a bunch of host entries for
our network at work. The command portion ends up looking like

  xterm -T $host -n $host -e ssh $fqdnforhost

I like to user FQDNs rather than unqualified hostnames for ssh because
it's easier (for me, anyway) to wildcards in my ~/.ssh/config file,
e.g.,

  Host *.trusted.net
    ForwardAgent yes
    ForwardX11 yes
  Host *
    ForwardAgent no
    ForwardX11 no
    [...]

For xterm, I don't _really_ need to, but for emacs and other X
applications it is "nice", and so I do it this way to maintain the
abstraction.

The -f doesn't seem to help.  And it does prompt, but not anywhere I
can talk to it.  The prompts show up on the virtual tty, but my
keystrokes somehow never make it to ssh.

I can kill the ssh (though a regular kill doesn't work, the brutal -9
version works), but it doesn't unstick sawfish (or gwm, which was my
previous window manager and had the identical problem).  I wish it
did.

Any other ideas?

I think the X session is frozen because the tty process group is
stopped while ssh reads input.  you should be able to kill -CONT
anything stopped.

to prevent this from happening, use 'ssh -n', so ssh will exit
instead of asking anything.

there's also the SSH_ASKPASS environment variable, but I think
you still need to use 'ssh -n' to prevent ssh from asking you
about things like host key issues.

(I use 'xterm -e ssh' instead of 'ssh host xterm')

As a former academic, I strongly disagree.  What classrooms SHOULD be
giving is a foundation in the fundamentals of your profession.
"Real-world experience" is too tied up in details to give this
understanding.  Some people may be able to figure out the general
concepts from the specifics, but most people will not.  Most
programming and other books written for "professionals" are aimed at
people who either already understand the fundamentals, or don't care.

Most CS courses have been taught in Unix-family OSes because they are
well-structured, illustrate the principles well, and some are
open-source, which is ideal for study.  If they are teaching MS, most
likely they are not teaching anything applicable to other areas.  Most
likely, it's "OK, to set up this network, click on
Configure->Network->..." or something like that.

Aha!  Yes, so at least I can kill off the defective ssh and restart

No workie.  "ssh -n remote-host1 xterm &" still asks for a password on
the virtual tty I startx'd on, but it doesn't accept input.  Russell
Evans' suggestion of "ssh -t -f ..." didn't change that either.

Yeah, I saw that, but setting it to /usr/bin/ssh-askpass didn't change
the behavior.

See the "abstraction" justification elsewhere in this thread.

And a hearty _thank you_ for hauling my sorry ass out of the soup, so
I can at least defuse the landmine once I've stepped on it!

By now, this isn't a surprise: I can't remove it. I am
wondering what to do next.

I have an Internet connection and use Samba to print
to a networked printer. I have a Web server working. I
can play CD's and DVD's, and can burn CD's. I have a
scanner working. I have access to external FireWire
and USB 2.0 storage, and a Zip drive. I also have
Intel's C++ compiler working, although GCC does not.

The typical user of Windows would never even have
detected something like that. I don't know many who
have VC++ installed, though it costs less than $100.

I wonder if copying this data somewhere else, then,
would solve the problem (assuming that the hard drive
is defective)? Limitations on the ability to develop
software, as I am experiencing now, are a nuisance,
but starting from scratch is not an appealing
prospect, either.

No obvious change.  With those options, I looked at lsof for the ssh
process and found fd0 was /dev/null.  It did open /dev/tty as fd4.
Not sure: a) if ssh is listening to that for a password; or b) how to
talk to that tty if it is.

Runlevel 1 if you're talking about a dynamic library comes
to mind as a possibility.  If you're using Fedora, back off
to a distribution that's proven stable.

What, djgcc works great where Rawhide isn't too bad
either.  The Windows compiler environment isn't 
available on Linux and other systems.  Depending on 
Microsoft IDE's, or any closed limited platform IDE 
for that matter, is a good way to handicap yourself.

Doesn't this starting over occur every time Microsoft releases 
a new operating system, office suite, or compiler set?
Something in high demand like good Hebrew support is more 
likely to come into being in an open office suite than in 
Microsoft office.  An awful lot of Windows programs have 
been written on Unix platforms.  I don't need to spend 
$100 for visual studio when there are other very good 
compilers out there which are neither Microsoft Windows 
nor Microsoft debugging team dependent.  I want the freedom
to choose which programmer helps me fix a software package
should I need this.

ah, hmm.  ssh man page says it will read passphrase from tty if
it has one, and it implies that this takes precedence over

If you get no joy with that, how about

("remote-host1" (system "/usr/bin/X11/xterm -e ssh -fX remote-host1
xterm")

Does "system" have some special meaning? Is there another way to call a
program in your window manager?

Thank you
Russell

Subject: [PLUG] Tuning up mailscanner and postfix...
Message-ID: <1073547638.30014.21.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I'm trying to figure out how to get locally generated email to go
through the scanner no matter what the destination is.  Under evolution,
there is the sendmail send and the smtp send options.  What is the
difference?  How can I configure things so that choosing the sendmail
option won't bypass mailscanner?  How do I reconfigure the replacement
attachment for when there is a suspected virus?  I'm really using
Postfix, I'm not sure of the version though.

Is there a clamav or spamassassin patch to scan Microsoft Word 
documents and other binary attachments directly?

BTW: I don't know exactly what the standard locations are to install
     clamav in, so I installed under /usr/include/clamav.

     Figuring it's normal to install under /bin and /sbin by the   
     directory structure that was created, I made links to the 
     individual executables under /usr/local/clamav/{bin,sbin}.  
     For the libraries, I added the path to /etc/ld.so.conf.  
     How do I source the new library path?  SMTP emailing to 
     myself a  test virus out of the clam source, I seem to
     have clamav scans working.  I got the possible virus
     warning. 

     If mailscanner calls spamassassin, is there any reason
     to program .forward and .procmailrc to run spamassassin
     anymore?

Speaking as a training company, I agree. We prefer to offer Linux
training that's mostly distribution-neutral and covers the
concepts and fundamentals. That's why we've never offered "Red Hat
Linux" training.

I'm not sure where the term originated, but we (ALC) call the
knowledge gained in MS training courses "throwaway knowledge".
It's knowledge that becomes outdated when the vendor makes changes
to the product. The same would apply to a lesser degree to
specific Linux distributions. It's a poor investment since the
knowledge becomes obsolete over a relatively short period of time.
Learning Unix/Linux concepts is a better investment because the
knowledge has a long shelf life and changes that vendors make to
their products doesn't affect it greatly.

Russell,

Not sure if what I'm doing is similar to what you're trying to do but I 
include the following lines in my Connect script called from a Gnome menu.

KEY=`/usr/bin/ssh-add -l | grep -c ':'`

if [ $KEY -eq 0 ]; then
	ssh-add
fi

Then if I haven't done a ssh-add somewhere/sometime during the current X 
session I get prompted for my ssh passphrase.

In /etc/X11/xdm Xsession are these lines

# is ssh-agent available?
SSHAGENT=
[ -x /usr/bin/ssh-agent ] && SSHAGENT="/usr/bin/ssh-agent"

# now, we see if xdm/gdm/kdm has asked for a specific environment

Here, here!  Bravo!

Semester starts next week here and I just got a message that runs 
something like this.

	We just got NN new Pocket PCs ... add to the CS 100 (Intro to
	Computers and Computer Science) course content ... programmable
	using Visual BASIC ... neat ... cool. 

(Well the last two are my take on the message tone :-)

Somehow I let myself get roped back into teaching this class that is way
too application and vendor specific.  There is a BUSA 100 (Into to
Computers) class that should be teaching this junk.  CS 100 should teach 
Computer Science.
   This ties into the thread about too many colleges and universities 
teaching MS stuff (throwaway) and not enough Operating Systems concepts.  
Of couse they wouldn't get all those foxy software deals and $$ from the 
OSS community.

To pun-a-phrase those MS adds I'm seeing on PBS:

	Your potential, our profit.

                                "Prophesies"

   Thursday, January 8, 2004--It's an ancient and not especially
   honorable journalistic New Year's tradition to offer retrospective
   summaries of the year just past and prospective predictions for the
   year just beginning. It's a bit of a gimmick, frankly, but a fun one.

   So, as an ancient and not especially honorable journalist with a
   penchant for gimmickry, I find myself surprised to recall never having
   produced either a year-in-review or a list of predictions for the year
   to come. Today I'll correct half of that.

   If I'm not mistaken, most of us were here for 2003 and remember what
   happened. So we'll skip that part and go straight to Pure Prophesy.
   And if the Alzheimers doesn't set in before 2005, we'll revisit the
   list and see how we scored.

   Okay, so here we go. Ten predictions for 2004.

   Prediction #1: Somebody buys Red Hat. My bet is Oracle.

   This is based on no inside skinny whatsoever. Just the observation
   that every company has two markets: one for its goods and services and
   one for itself. As the stock market cautiously improves, expect the
   active market for the sale of "Linux companies" to remain active.

   Connect the dots and it's not hard to see where this will go. Novell
   bought Ximian in August and SuSE in November. EMC just bought VMware
   in December. Red Hat just bought Sistina. Given the mojo behind Linux,
   which is growing steadily in just about every respect you can name
   (enterprises, governments, education, embedded, servers, clients thick
   and thin), additional acquisitions are a safe bet.

   Today, of all the high-profile "Linux Companies" that were around
   during the boom years of the late '90s, Red Hat is about the only one
   left that still has a profile. Though I'm no fan of rampant
   acquisition (a huge percentage of them fail), it's hard to ignore the
   trends here.

   Prediction #2: Quickbooks will come out for Linux. Other mainstream
   apps will follow.

   As Linux continues to establish itself in business, expect familiar
   accounting apps -- to name just one common category -- to start moving
   over. For example, as Linux continues to penetrate entertainment and
   publishing, expect Adobe to try gaining ground on Linux that it lost
   to Apple on the OS X platform.

   Microsoft? Not until they wake up and smell the demand. My guess is
   that it'll happen eventually. But not this year.

   Prediction #3: Outsourcing to low-cost Linux-based services will grow.

   Outsourcing is already huge. Folks providing it will naturally rely on
   the cheapest and most reliable platforms they can mount. This
   imperative applies whether the customer is a giant retailer like
   Target, which just signed a 10-year deal for on-demand computing from
   the Linux giant named IBM, or a small company like the one this reader
   works for:

     Actually I tried something new at this company. Since I end up
     doing all the support on the systems, we have outsourced everything
     except the desktops. And I mean everything. Currently our mail
     server, web server, and FTP server are being hosted by ipowerweb
     running Linux somewhere in California for $8/month. This gives us
     500MB of space and 50 email addresses.

     We have two networks for our people. One network is for development
     and hooked up to the robot. It is not connected to anything else
     (so far, never been hacked). The other network is for the office
     machines and each machine has a firewall and virus protection. No
     servers yet. Early this year I'm buying a RAID NAS Linux server
     appliance to hold the backups. I spend no more than 5 minutes a
     month on maintenance.

     From my perspective, the only way to go for small business is
     outsourced or in-house appliances managed by a web interface.

   That last item leads me to...

   Prediction #4: Phrase of the Year: "Mixed Environments."

   The all-Microsoft shop is following the all-IBM shop into the growing
   roster of Things In The Past. But that doesn't mean there will be many
   no-Microsoft shops. The mature state toward which we are heading is
   one in which the best tools and materials get used for whatever the
   job happens to be. Given current cost- and support-savings imperatives
   alone, this bodes well for Linux.

   Prediction #5: New Net-ready embedded consumer electronics devices
   will get hot.

   Why should your digital camera only dump pictures onto your desktop or
   laptop machine? Why shouldn't it connect by Wi-Fi or Ethernet directly
   to a ready server on the Net? For that matter, why should any device
   that needs to move data not be ready to interact in open and
   productive ways over the Net with remote storage and all kinds of
   ready services on the back end? I'm not sure how this one will play
   out -- whether the trend will be driven by the Sonys and Apples of the
   world (which will want to restrict you as much as possible to their
   gear, services and partners), by the ISPs and hosting services looking
   for value-adds to sell or what. But I'm sure Linux will make
   implementation quick and easy in both the embedded device and service
   providing roles.

   By the way, I'll be at CES this weekend, and I'll let you know what I
   find out there.

   Prediction #6: The ROW boat pulls in front, with government help.

   In big-picture market data parlance, ROW stands for "Rest Of World."
   Here in the US we tend to look at everything outside our own borders
   as ROW. From inside the business sphere, we tend to look at government
   the same way. Well, right now it looks like those are the two
   categories that will contribute the most to Linux Leadership this
   year. One case in both points is a story reported yesterday by the
   Israeli National News:
   http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=55243: "Finance
   Ministry Weaning Israel Off of Microsoft".

   Don't be surprised to see Project Leopard:
   http://leopard.sourceforge.net/ helping that development along.

   Prediction #7: Syndication and notification will go mainstream and
   change everything.

   Syndication and notification are hot. The leading (or the most
   branded) metadata format for syndication and notification is RSS,
   which stands for Rich Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication. RSS
   quickly is becoming an infrastructural value-add for the Internet.
   Thanks to RSS (and its equivalents) when you publish on the Net, a
   notification goes out to the world, and your content is in a position
   to be syndicated to everybody who pays attention to the notification,
   usually through news aggregators. When they write about what you
   write, services like Technorati:
   http://technorati.com (which runs on Linux) let you know what they've
   said too. More linkage happens, Google takes notice and juice flows.

   RSS is the standard with the highest profile, thanks in large measure
   to its advocacy by Dave Winer, prime mover behind RSS 2.0:
   http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss. It's the first in a series of
   established and emerging metadata standards, which extend the reach of
   the category far beyond the on-line publishing world. All kinds of
   things can be syndicated, including updates to product and parts
   catalogs, weather information, traffic notifications--you name it.

   As always, anything that expands the Net as an infrastructure platform
   inevitably involves plenty of Linux as well.

   If you're new to RSS, Amphetadesk:
   http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/ is probably the leading news
   aggregation for Linux. Hebig.org:
   http://www.hebig.org/blogs/archives/main/000877.php has a huge
   directory of other RSS news readers and aggregators as well.

   Prediction #8: Web services will finally get huge.

   Loosely Coupled:
   http://looselycoupled.com/glossary/web%20services defines Web services
   as "Automated resources accessed via the Internet. Web services are
   software-powered resources or functional components whose capabilities
   can be accessed at an Internet URI. Standards-based Web services use
   XML to interact with each other, which allows them to link up on
   demand using loose coupling."

   Most of Loosely Coupled's sources are from 2002. That was the big year
   for talk about Web services. The following year was a big one for
   implementation, including all that stuff I just said about RSS, which
   fits the definition. Now we're reading business magazine cover stories
   about Amazon's expanding business in Web services. Thanks to Web
   services, Amazon becomes an e-commerce platform for countless
   businesses other than its own $4 billion/year retail operation.

   And Amazon, of course, runs everything it can on Linux.

   Prediction #9: The mundane reigns.

   The most widely deployed Linux implementations are the least visible.
   Also, perhaps, the fastest growing. One example is Samba, which looks
   to most enterprises like a Windows file and print server. There are
   countless millions of Samba servers in the world. Another is wireless
   access points. When I did my study of Wi-Fi in New York last year, the
   largest percentage of WAPs I found had a default linksys SSID.
   Linksys, now owned by Cisco, easily has the largest WAP market share.
   Lots of Linksys WAPs run Linux--maybe most or all of them, I'm not
   sure. In any case, it's an easy supposition to make.

   Prediction #10: SCO will lose.

   Far too much hot air and ink already has been wasted on this subject.
   Lawyers withstanding, it will end. Count on it.

   Of course, I'd welcome hearing your ideas too. A second guess at this
   kind of stuff can't be worse than the first one.

That worked with "ssh -n".  Pops up the little X ssh-askpass.  Double

finding this.  Thank you!

I recall a story that E. Dijkstra told:  He was looking at some code for
somebody that was not working and suggested restructuring the code.  The
person replied that that would be much to slow, he needed the code to
run fast.  To which Dijkstra reponded that it would be easy to make the
program run fast, it it did not need to produce the correct answers.

Subject: [PLUG] Help please, linux md raid broken
Message-ID: <Law12-F105vd6r5Kpra00023675@hotmail.com>

This morning my RH9 machine "sparky" was off and wouldn't come on.  Swapped 
power supplies and it now will power up and partway boot but hangs with the 
following error message:

raid0: done.

I don't think that the disks are ruined and hope that my data may be 
recoverable.  Running Disk Druid off the install disc 1 still shows the raid 
devices and partitions are still mostly recognized.  Only md2 (my / 
partition, of course) seems to have lost it's ext3 formatting:

RAID Devices

/dev/md0 swap 2048

/dev/hdg3 /dev/md2 software RAID 36892 2590 77545


So does it seem that md2 is simply no longer recognized as ext3 formatting?  
Is there some way to recover it with fsck?  I tried booting the disc 1 
installer and it is unable to mount the system under /mnt/sysimage.  
Can/should I try to run fsck from the rescue disc?  Or should/can I run 
fdisk/mke2fs and try to restore md2 as a ext3 partition?

All help is appreciated.

Thank you

  The icy conditions slowed the clock on his computer. Then, to make things
worse, it took that long for the bits to make it up the Willamette Valley
because I-5 is in such bad shape.

  This type of winter is typical of the Intermountain West (Idaho, Montana,
Wyoming). My only issue is that most drivers haven't a clue how to drive
safely on snow and ice.

  I'm on the opposite end of the employment spectrum from you: I work from
my home so I have no excuse to not be working these days. Of course, none of
my clients are at work, but I'm spending my time writing my book.

Can someone parse this sentence for me?

I know all the words and so I assume it's english, but it doesn't make any
sense.

There is a trust between the public and funding requests?

I'm lost.

This is way more work than the reader should have to do on a discussion
list.

I think Michael may be the next James Joyce.

Brief, perhaps useless, kibitzing: Before doing anything, figure out
what /proc/mdstat says regarding the volume. If it thinks one of the
drives is offline, you should try rebuilding the raid superblock (not
the ext3 superblock) -- use "mdadm -A --force" to try to force raid
reassembly. (Or whatever it is with raidtools.) If this doesn't work,
and the drive is still considered offline, then because you're using
raid0 (or "aid0" as I like to call it), there's not much more you can
do. You can muck about with e2fsck and ext2 recovery tools and cross
your fingers that the right data are sliced *just so*, but I wouldn't
hold my breath.

I never touch "aid0" myself.

I *think* it's: "Because there's a breakdown in trust between the
public and institutions of education, funding requests by these
institutions are being denied repeatedly -- leading to dissatisified
instructors."

And, btw, this mucking about will *seriously* mess up your
data. Beyond even further hope of repair.

It really is possible you could force reassembly of the superblocks.

I wiped a raid out once by not booting with a raid enabled kernel.
The md recovery thread seems to be enabled regardless, at least in
Redhat.  Maybe it was attempting to fsck one of the partitions in
the raid set directly, I don't think you're supposed to do this.
The best bet is to not treat raid as a backup option until a 
recovery method is known.  The biggest difficulty I ran into is
confused documentation on RAID, there are old tools that 
shouldn't be used with the new code.  Kickstart may
be your friend for raid recovery, especially if you build a
custom package set that contains your modifications and custom
compiled software.  I've never built a raid with spare disks, 
these most likely are backups that can be used for recovery 
if you can reformat all the non spare disks in your raid.
The latter may require a utility Linux system seperate
from the one built on your raid.

(But if /proc/mdstat says the array is just fine, then, yes, e2fsck
and such are the way to go. But still be very, very careful.)

In 2.6 there will actually be a /proc/config that will list all of the
compile options for the current running kernel.  Not certain how it
handles kernel options that are compiled in separately though.

I am going to be moving to the 2.6 kernel soon.  Just a couple of things
to upgrade before that.

Well, I've gotten forwarded packets for a masq host logging 
finally, now the question becomes how to get a report of 
total bytes transferred per protocol per host.  A change 
I'm after is having all the iptables logging go to it's

to add a new log facility and switch from warn to it?
How do you change the logging facility in iptables?

What would be valuable would be a course in where the various

Training should enable the trained to be able to navigate their way
around no matter what distribution they are on.

The advantage to U*i* is that those things normally do not change every

I'm running mandrake 9.0 and recently I needed to swap the mouse. I
swapped one ps2 mouse (logitech cordless optical) for another (MS wheel
mouse). I was hoping this wouldn't disable the mouse, but it did.

I reran mousedrake to reset the proper mouse type, but no luck. 
I did an rmmod/insmod on mousedev and input but still no luck. 

Any ideas on how to revive the mouse? I'd hate to have to reboot the
machine just to get it back. 

Thanks, 
Sasha

Depends on the mainboard, but for ps2 mice, rebooting is very, very
often required.

  Quite often a reboot is required. If you're into conspiracies, consider
that you are trying to use a Microsoft mouse and it may be designed to not
work on linux. It's a really good thing you don't have a SCO mouse! (There
are a number of SCO rats, but that's for a different thread.)

Am not sure I'm in the right place, but I booted off the RH9 disc 1, did 
linux rescue and issued cat /proc/mdstat:

Personalities : [raid0] [raid1] [raid5]
read_ahead 1024 sectors
unused devices: <none>

Is that what you were directing me towards?  If so, is it saying the drives 
are online?

Am getting pretty nervous.  I have no experience with the raidtools nor 
repairing a raid volume.  Can anyone recommend a professional I can hire to 
help restore my data?

Thanks again

Again, from the rescue disc:

e2fsck -nv /dev/md2

e2fsck 1.32 (09-Nov-2002)
e2fsck: Invalid argument while trying to open /dev/md2

The superblock could not be read or does not describe a correct
ext2 filesystem.  If the device is valid and it really contains an ext2
filesystem (and not swap or ufs or something else), then the superblock
is corrupt, and you might try running e2fsck with an alternate superblock:
   esfsck -b 8193 <device>

Am lost here.  What's the meaning of "alternate" superblock?  Is the 8193 
parameter a shot in the dark or should I try the command?

Thanks!

It says to me that it found none of your arrays at all. It couldn't
identify a single disk as part of any array. This is pretty bad. But
with appropriate care, the raid may be able to be reassembled.

There are companies for data recovery, but they tend to be
**extremely** expensive, and make no guarantees (and offer no
money-back). So you kind of have to judge how much you really need
that data.

I'd recommend, either getting one of us out with promise of lunch and
beverage (many here prefer beer, but I don't); or going to the Linux
Clinic (whenever that is).

i.e., /dev/md2 couldn't be auto-detected by the kernel, so it's an
invalid block device. As discussed in previous reply.

UFS-derived filesystems keep multiple copies of the filesystem
superblock (not the array superblock). If the filesystem itself is
hosed (which we don't know yet, due to previously discussed issues),
you can rebuild the filesystem from one of the backups. Technically
not the same, but metaphorically you can think of it as a "copy of the
FAT table".

Subject: [PLUG] fetchmail fetchall and keep options...
Message-ID: <1073604620.2710.58.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

If you use these together will you get multiple copies of the same
messages?  It seems with IMAP that the idea is to access a server
from one client machine.  Messages won't be pulled on another 
client machine if they are marked read, will they?  Is there any 
way with IMAP to use two different MUA's on two different machines 
and still have all of the messages in both places retrieved from 
the same server only once?
  
Whoever designed IMAP apparently didn't intend it for mirroring
purposes.  Otherwise, you'd have to program in how many clients 
you have and register some unique identifier for each one.  The
server would report on being accessed different Inbox contents 
for different clients.  The server would store any message until
all clients make a request for it to be deleted.

Does Outlook Express under Win2k by default only download unread
messages or does it download any header it doesn't have?  Is there a 
way to fetch read messages with fetchmail only once without deleting
them off the server?  How does one address the problem of an OE 
client deleting a message off the server keeping it from 
reaching a mirror?

Maybe running fetchmail with fetchall, but not keep, is what I want to
do.  Is blocking every other MUA and MTA from accessing the IMAP server
I want to probe directly the only way to have a local server copy
without preventing users from accessing their messages in Outlook
Express, etc?  I'd have to block access to the ISP's webmail page as
well and set up a local imap server for users to point their MUAs
at.  Maybe I should replace the webmail page locally too.

If you copy an email in an ip folder to a folder that isn't on the
imap server, what happens?  

When an MUA tries to figure out on an IMAP server what is read and
not read, does it look for a line in the headers it put there, or 
is any line from any MUA passable?  Is there any way with 
fetchmail to fetch only read messages?

If I understand IMAP correctly, you mark headers on the server
and in some cases download the actual message to have a local
copy of it ( when you copy to a local folder? ).

(This is not technically correct. It couldn't identify enough disks to
present an array. It may have identified one of the drives, but since
it's only raid0, it can't present a degraded array like it could with
raid1 or raid5.)

Our courses do that but in a general sense. For example, we
cover the different boot loaders and mention which
distributions use them. We cover grub and how to configure
it - not how it's configured by default for a particular
Linux distribution.

Similarly, we cover system startup by teaching both BSD-style
and System V-style and examining typical startup scripts.

Agreed. This is our goal.

Well, Red Hat Linux is/was a moving target. Each new version
had quite a few significant changes.

also switching a ps2 mouse with power on can burn out the port.  In most cases 
it is safer to switch ps2 mice powered down.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0401081611550.29971-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

Are there any good resources on using any of these (with a preference for
iptables) for network challenged?  I either have a complete block against
understanding them, was working under-fire, or the tutorials I've seen
assumed more knowledge than I had so I've never quite got the hand of 
iptables.
   I also am running on some 'interesting' hardware configurations (some 
of it just plain OLD JUNK) so never knew if I was fighting network 
problems damned hardware and sometimes it was the NIC that was the bad 
hardware.

So I'm looking for suggestions for online, dead tree, etc. information on 
using iptables or ipchains.


TIA,
Rod

What i'd suggest since you've booted a rescue disc, is start and mount the raid devices one at a time. Basically, what you would do is create your /etc/raidtab. make sure your rescue disk has raid1 included in the kernel or modprobe the module, which ever is the case. Then use raidstart /dev/mdX then mount your raid devices like so... mount /dev/md0 /mnt/rescue. 

As pointed out in this thread, check /proc/mdstat for clues. Mine looks like this:

jmorgan at saitama:~$ cat /proc/mdstat 
Personalities : [raid1] 
md1 : active raid1 hdb6[1] hda6[0]
      4008064 blocks [2/2] [UU]

      505920 blocks [2/2] [UU]
			            
md4 : active raid1 hdb9[1] hda9[0]
      10008384 blocks [2/2] [UU]
			        
md5 : active raid1 hdb10[1] hda10[0]
      61568960 blocks [2/2] [UU]
						            
md0 : active raid1 hdb5[1] hda5[0]
      1003904 blocks [2/2] [UU]
						        

This might help in identifing error messages while doing raidstart or mount.

Ive not used Evolution, but im guessing that sendmail option is your local MTA while smtp is a smarthost. You might have a look at this document as it explains the install process prety well: http://www.flakshack.com/anti-spam/

So 75 people drive an extra 75 miles they wouldn't have before, in bad

You are confused about how IMAP works.  IMAP provides access to shared 
mail folders on the server.  The client can keep download local copies 
but does not have to.  The IMAP server keep track of a read flag for 
messages.  IMAP clients usually will list all messages in the folder. 
With proper locking, IMAP folders can be shared between multiple 
simulatenous clients.

Some mail clients, like fetchmail, treat IMAP like POP, downloading 
messages and then removing them from the server.  Clients that fully 
support IMAP will just download the headers for messages they haven't 
seen before.  They can download the full messages when they are 
displayed.  Now, most will save copies locally for offline use.

Bleh, that blows. okay, thanks everyone. 

Since this is my pvr machine and most of the navigation I do is with a
remote, its not critical that I reboot. This also forced me to get xine

First, run e2fsck.  If the filesystem is corrupt, then anything else you 
do will just make it worse.

Second, delete the file (and all the extras) manually as root.  One 
thing to check is the permissions on the directory.  But that shouldn't 
affect root.

Third, instead of reinstalling the package, you can try removing it and 
installing it again.  glibc-devel has lots of things that require it, so 
you can either remove and install them.  Or you can use the --nodeps 
flag with "rpm -e" to temporarily turn off the dependency checking.

Well, it's not a hot-swappable interface.  It's not meant to be

Since the system uses reiserfs, I suppose that is the
appropriate check. Apparently, though, if it will only
check a filesystem mounted read-only (as indicated

I suppose you have to use a rescue disk, mount the
target filesystem read-only, and then perform the
check. Is this correct, or can a booted filesystem be
checked?

If the marking is not on the IMAP server, why would a different
client not pick up a message as an unread one?  I would think
the only concern is not deleting a message off the server if
you want to see it on another machine, but then how do you
avoid having fetchmail get the same messages multiple times?
If you don't use fetchall fetchmail must know what is read,
but how does it get that for an account that it has never
before accessed?  Does it assume that only messages for the 
current day are unread when it doesn't know otherwise?
Where is the local message list for fetchmail and evolution
when you are accessing an IMAP account?  There's got to be
a list somewhere if you can download less than every message
that's on the IMAP server.

It would be awfully nice to be able to clear anything a month 
old or older off an IMAP server with fetchmail.

On what?  I want to eventually disallow accessing machines other than
my local mail hub for mail, but before I do this, I need to make sure
I have the hub set up well and give users a chance to try it.

Does fetchmail have the IMAP server to SMTP messages to it?
In any mail user agent when you are going out directly to an IMAP
server, do you download the email messages when you click on their 
headers?  Does this downloading affect the state of the IMAP
server at all?  What can fetchmail or any IMAP client change on
the IMAP server?

Am I right in assuming that if I use say evolution to access imap
account rob at wherever, then use Eudora to access the same account
rob at whereever, that these two MUAs maintain their own information
about what is read and not read?  Will you get all messages with
both mail user agents if they are running side by side accessing
rob at whereever at the same time?  If not, why not?

  As root, go to single-user mode (telinit 1). Then you can umount the
problamatic filesystem and check it. When you're finished, telinit 3 (for
console mode) or 4/5 (depending on your distribution) for GUI mode puts you
back in multiuser mode. Don't forget to remount the filesystem before
running telinit the second time.

I found myself frustrated reading through the rest of your email, but
this is an easy answer.  Perhaps you didn't far well in Karla's classes
because you are not keyed to learn from certain teaching styles, such as
email in a mailing list or Karla's lecture style?

Anyway...

As was stated earlier, the IMAP server designates what has and has not
been read via either the Maildir or mbox method of doing this.  As such,
once a message is read, regardless of what mail client you're using or
where you're using it, that message will always appear read unless you
mark it unread.

IF you're running both mail programs at the same time, side by side,
your IMAP server may complain... it could cause problems... I think UW
IMAP complained about that, while I don't think bincimap does.  But,
ideally, yes... both will get the full spool contents, both will have
identical views of the mail spool.

I will illustrate with an example, maybe to help you understand a little
better.

Let us use this message.  I hit the send button on Evolution.  Evolution
talks to my mail server, saying "send this email for me, ok?"  My mail
server then looks at it and sees it needs to send it to my ISP's mail
server (they have port 25 outbound blocked for their customers).  My
mail server talks to my ISP's mail server and tells it where to send the
message.  My ISP's mail server delivers it to the pdxlinux.org mail
server, which does some magic for the list, and sends it off to your
mail server.

Your mail server receives the email from the PLUG mail server.  The PLUG
mail server tells it to deliver it to your user account.  Postfix
receives the message and puts it into your /var/spool/mail/$USER mbox
file where it sits for a while.

Then along comes your IMAP server.  You use Evolution to log on to your
mail server via IMAP.  Your IMAP server authenticates you.  Your mail
client says it wants to read what is in your INBOX.  Your IMAP server
reads the mbox file and sends your mail client an index (kinda like
XOVER, AFAIK) of the various emails in your INBOX (which is the
/var/spool/mail/$USER mbox file).

Now, you see you have new mail!  Yay!  We love new mail.

You click, in Evolution, on my email message here.  Hi Michael! 
:::waves:::

Evolution tells to IMAP server "send me message 12345"... the IMAP
server looks up the message in the mbox file (your mail spool), it reads
it, and it sends it to Evolution.  Evolution then displays the message.

After the message has been open for a few seconds, Evolution decides you
have had enough time to read (reed) it, so it marks it read (red).  It
tells the IMAP server, "Hey, Micheal has read message 12345, okay?" and
the IMAP server then marks the message read in the mbox file... with the
X-Status-Read header?  If it were a Maildir setup, it would adjust the
filename the message is stored in to indicate the message had, indeed,
been read.

You close Evolution, you're tired of email for tonight.

Tomorrow morning, you fire up KMail to read your email.  It talks to
your IMAP server and asks what's in your INBOX.

The IMAP server gets launched again from inetd.  It authenticates you. 
KMail asks it what is in INBOX.  It reads /var/spool/mail/$USER.  It
sees this message, number 12345, has already been read.  The IMAP server
then sends KMail an index of the INBOX... the basic headers and what has
or has not been read.  KMail sees the IMAP server said message 12345 has
been read, so it displays it as not new.  You skip over this email and
read the next one.

Pretty nifty, huh?  I do hope things maybe make a bit more sense to you
know... it's really not that complicated at all.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.52.0401081926280.11263@shaft.bitmine.net>

I've been talking about these things for years and I really need to just
do it.

Open for comment.  Let me know if I write anything boneheaded here.  Any
comments totally welcome.

First, I figure that since I use procmail for local delivery, it doesn't
matter if I'm the only one on the system that uses Maildir.  I just modify
my procmail rules to write maildir and I'm done with that.  Yes?

Second, I need to write a good .muttrc that does everything I like,
particularly handling roles.  There was some stuff in the PLUG archives
here recently and I've been slowly collecting information about doing that
properly, but any source of information would be helpful.  Honestly,
this'll be the first thing I do as I want to make sure I can use mutt and
THEN move to Maildir.

Lastly, I need to make sure I can do all the proper composing with vi.
Some people here had some really nice ways of handling mail with vi and
I'd love to open up the discussion of mail handling in vi again.  No
reason to discuss doing it on other editors, really.  If I wanted to use
emacs, I'd be moving to gnus (which I tried doing at one point but the
learning curve was too steep at the time).  Particularly, I'm interested
in standard quoting and paragraph justification with a fixed line length
(while handling nested quotes within that paragraph).

And after last, I'll do the basic GPG config stuff.

If there's something I'm missing, let me know.

Try to copy any important files: /etc, /root/, and /home.

Also, can't hurt trying to fix the filesystem.  My understanding is that 
reiserfsck does not fix minor like e2fsck.  It has some rebuild options 
which the man page recommends backing up the filesystem before using.

um, if it isn't already obvious from the description of

This concept goes back a long way.  There was a story about how the
better engineering schools taught EE devices at an abstract level.
You first learn "ideal" devices such as perfect inductors, a
"voltage-controlled voltage source," etc., and then learn ways to
analyze them.  Then you learn how to model real devices using
combinations of the abstract components.  The lesser schools would
just teach the specifics of one device.  Which would leave their
graduates out in the cold when there was a technology shift (e.g.,
vacuum tubes to transistors).

Why should a course called "Intro to Computers" teach a bunch of MS
stuff, thereby brainwashing students into the belief that MS is
everything.  They should just be honest and call it "Introduction to
Windows."

I saw the syllabus for such a course at U. of Delaware.  It was
something like: "How to use e-mail (they teach Outlook); how to create
documents (they teach Word), etc.  I wonder if they even bothered to
explain that e-mail was a generic capability that wasn't exclusive to
Outlook.

I've seen a couple of polls and discussions about top-quoting
versus bottom-quoting, recently. For years I've been trying to convince
people, especially relatives, to quote after the message, as is
"proper." I'm not convinced anymore, and your link, though it has a 
great domain name, is hardly authoritative. Its argument is primarily
subjective and historical. And it ignores a couple of things.

1) Top-quoting is incredibly readable--far more readable than bottom-quoting in fact,
in exactly the situation that I'm replying to (it's quoted at the bottom). The person
who wrote this, the person who put their response at the top, was the originator of the
thread. His response barely relied on the context of the situation--basically, he said
'okay, thanks everyone.' He could as easily have dumped everything from the email, except
he wanted to provide some context for anyone who wasn't reading it threaded. It was _far_
faster to read his email, threaded, because I didn't have to scroll down through all the
garbage to find out that his question was effectively answered, as far as he was concerned.
If I was interested in more, I could scroll down and read further.

2) Inline quoting, different from bottom-quoting, is the most appropriate 
solution for replies where the reply assumes context, and is certainly a 
good thing to point out to people who reply out of context at the top of the post. 
I've seen that fairly rarely (lately), though.

3) I have yet to hear a good argument for bottom quoting.

I also note that there aren't knee-jerk responses of "respond at the top!" from the other camp,
and since this is primarily a question of taste, it makes little sense to knee-jerk response. 
This is a multiple-person mailing list, and different people like it different, so until
someone creates an email format that allows me to specify "this is a contextual reply" and let 
the mailing reader decide, based on user preference, where to put the reply, I think it's kind 
of offensive to yell at everyone.

One of the polls I've read, and worthy of pointing out cause it's been about 50-50 since 
the beginning, and a lot of the posts make a lot of sense. Plus, K5 is hardly a place for 
aolers or anyone else un-tech-savvy.

Bleh, that blows. okay, thanks everyone. 

Since this is my pvr machine and most of the navigation I do is with a
remote, its not critical that I reboot. This also forced me to get xine

Yeah, but it doesn't work. Cause

No non-free packages installed on zadie!  rms would be proud.

But I've got flashplugin-nonfree, which in itself is free, but installs

Err... how about "Learn to wrap your lines!"?

And I assume throughout this that you mean "posting" instead of "quoting"
pretty much throughout.  For example, you refer to your own message as an
example of "top-quoting", but your quotation is at the bottom and your new
material at the top.

That's a matter of taste (and your mail reader's presentation) and totally
incorrect when ANY context is required (beyond the subject).

But do you put the new material before or after the inline quote?  After,
of course.  It's a response.

Don't know where you've been.  It's pretty much the norm everywhere I
read.

Well, there's this:

A: Because it messes up the order in which people normally read text.
Q: Why is top-posting such a bad thing?
A: Top-posting.
Q: What is the most annoying thing on usenet?

In other words, there is context to consider and context changes the
meaning of some words, phrases, sentences, or whole messages.  If you read
a person's post and then read the quoted material below (as one would,
reading top to bottom), you will find that the meaning of the new material
is modified or enhanced by this refresher.  Hence, you'll probably want to
go back and re-read the new material with this context in mind.  That
means you read the message twice instead of once through -- which you
would have done had the message come from someone who quoted judiciously
and responded after the quoted material.

If you're not responding to any part of the message directly, don't quote
it.  Your subject line should be telling enough.  In the case that it
isn't (threads gone far afield, or what have you), then quote a tiny bit.
A few words carefully chosen is usually all it takes.

Remember that writing is done for the reader and making it as easy for
them is the number one priority.  Your own convenience goes on the
sideline.  You're the one trying to communicate, after all.

I completely disagree that it's primarily a question of taste.  And the
"other camp" doesn't respond to the methods of bottom-posters because they
have nothing to complain about.  Bottom-posters aren't frustrating the
reading habits of people.  In fact, they're being courteous and
thoughtful.

One could also argue that since top-posters are too lazy to judiciously
quote or consider their reader, they're likely too lazy to give their
opinion on the subject.

It's not a matter of preference.  I am choosing to format this message
this way because that is how I want my reader to read it.  I choose the
structure of the message that conveys my meaning in the best way I know
how.  Restructuring the message could potentially change the meaning of my
words or at least take away from some nuance which I'm attempting to
convey.

I have been using seawall for years, and recently converted to using

It's very flexible, highly configurable and very cool...

I highly recommend it.

You are correct, I did mean top-posting. As for wrapping my lines, I
normally do--Evolution has a tendency to follow the pattern of the email
to which I am replying, and I still don't know why.

And you, sir, cut my email poorly. The rest of this paragraph stated
that it was more readable in cases where context mattered little. I'm
surprised, Jeme--didn't you just get into an argument with Michael
Robinson where he completely ignored your argument in favor of his own
creations? And aren't you doing that to me right now.

The email I was pointing out was exactly that. Context was totally
irrelevant to understanding the email.

When context is relevant, place your response after the contextual
stuff. But the last three emails where Paul Johnson referred to
http://learn.to/quote were _not_ like that (at least, the last three I
saw). They were emails where the response was at the top, but you didn't
need any context to understand the response. The one I quoted was one
such.

Very amusing. I'm going to cut the rest of this email, because it all
assumes an argument I did not make -- that where context is relevant,
you should write backwards. I am making an argument for the
context-insensitive reply, where you leave some context for those who
wish to explore further. I am also making an argument that the people
who are yelling at the people top-posting are being ill-behaved, as this
list is fairly well behaved, and fairly readable, especially considering
its high volume. Until you choose to engage me on those points, Jeme, my
respect for you, which was quite high before this, will be in jeopardy.

Oh, except for this tidbit:

Yes, human cognition isn't. But human preference is, and the internet is
the most democratic of places. Now I have no wish to discuss the merits
of democracy, at least not here, but when the polls of internet-savvy
users are split nearly 50-50 on how to quote, I don't think you can
easily say that it's not a matter of taste. At least, you couldn't if
you wanted to make sense.

But the most egregious offense of all is bitching about the way people
format their messages, of which you both are guilty.  Stop it and post
no more replies to this abominable thread.

Message-ID: <20040109210301.GB719@nellump.net>

The subject pretty much says it all. I've got two local machines (both
Linux) directly connected via a cross-over cable. On one side is an 800
MHz PPC, and the other a 120MHz Pentium. Networking seems to operate
just fine, for the most part. I can ssh in to the Pentium from the PPC,
and do all the usual shell-ish stuff. Transfering files via scp is
unbearably slow, though. After the first ~500k the connection begins to
"stall" (as reported by the scp status line), and never seems to make
any further progress. Small files seem to be OK, but I've tried a 15 MB
file and a ~300 MB file, both with no success. Any ideas? I've tried a
Google search, but couldn't figure out an appropriate query for the
question. :-/

Well, that begs the question, why quote AT ALL?  If it's for the very few
people who are going to want to read context AFTER they've read the new
material (the implication is that quoted text after new material doesn't
need to be read), then those people can look at the previous messages in
the thread.

I would say inline quoting is the norm for this list.

See, if the email only has one topic, then bottom-posting IS inline
quoting.  It's the same format, but with one element instead of many.

Um, no, the bit about the format of the message conveying meaning was also
cut.  You advocate, in this thread, putting format in the hands of the
reader.  That's a bit like taking an electronic book of poetry and hitting
Select All -> Justify.

If it's context-insensitive, why would anyone explore further?  Certainly
the thread is publicly available.

I find myself re-reading top-posts all the time.  The volume makes the
list so dense that simple top-posts cannot be differentiated by subthread.

I think I did.

First, people read from top to bottom.  That's not a matter of preference,
it's how things make sense to us (with the exception of some Inuit people,
if I recall... it's been a while since I've read Ethnomathematics).

Second, a poll can come out 50-50 for lots of reasons other than
preference (though this poll is a ways off even-Steven... and I don't
think either of us are prepared to tell the margin of error on this kind
of unscientific poll).  It could be that people are generally evenly
divided on their learning methods or recall abilities.  It could be that,
as I wrote before, top-posting is just laziness and half the people are
lazy and insensitive to the needs of their readers and half the people
take the time to make it easier for their readers.

You'll note that many more of the arguments for top-posting (in the
comments on that poll) are pretty selfish in nature than those for
bottom-posting:  "I don't need to read a bunch of quoted garbage." or
"I've already read the thread."  So these people top-post because they'd
rather read top-posts.  It's inconsiderate of them to assume that everyone
wants what they want.

The point is that top-posting assumes the context is not necessary, but
that's simply not true for all readers.  In fact, it's not true for about
half the readers (according to that poll).  And as you pointed out,
top-posters aren't out there trying to get bottom-posters to change their
behavior and that's because bottom-posting is less abusive to the reader.
Top-posters don't complain because they have nothing substantial about
which to complain.

In other words, it's easier for the people who think they want top-posting
to deal with bottom-posting than it is for people who want bottom-posting
to deal with top-posting.  The right thing to do is make things as easy on
the reader as possible.

A top-poster is stealing slack.  Their laziness is causing extra effort on
the part of others and therefore harming the others' ability to be lazy
themselves.

It's the P120.  It's just too slow to handle the encryption.  Shell stuff
and small files are taking longer, but it's such a minor difference that
you don't notice.  (Can you tell the difference between .01ms response and
.04ms?)

Slow machines don't act like fast machines when doing lots of
calculations.

If you want fast file transfers, use something that doesn't do so much
number crunching.

By just fine, do you mean throughput is acceptable with everything but scp?  
Can you try doing a regular non-encrypted FTP to address Jeme's suggestion 
that you may be CPU bound?  I don't buy that it would altogether stall if 
simply CPU exhausted.  scping should be slower, but I wouldn't expect it to 
stall.

Also try pinging back and forth.  See if you get any packet loss.  Since it 
seems to get increasingly slow, it could be TCP backing way off due to lost 
segments on the wire.

I think you can see the interface statistics with "ifconfig".  Look for any 
errors on each NIC.  If you have physical layer errors, try swapping cable 
or NICs themselves.

If the interfaces are clean and no packet loss is happening, maybe it is 
some sort of IRQ conflict on your PCs.

One other thing to check is your NIC speed/duplex settings.  Have seen where 
forcing one side to the wrong way will still work, but result in very slow 
throughput.  First off try auto on both sides.  Then try forcing 100/full on 
both sides- just don't mix one side auto with the other side fixed.

Actually, scp has a bad habit of letting its progress bar on the
client side get far, far ahead of actual performance. It's very
possible that said 15MB transfers would actually
finish. Eventually. Just need patience. :-)

Uhmmm...  I've personally seen similar problems a couple of times.  In one 
case, it was a bad (evil) NIC that would essentially lock up after a lot of 
data was poured down the pipe.  I cannot remember the manufacturer, but I 
only use e100pro's if possible now.  

I know several people who've seen this.  If the driver is a module, try 
rmmod-ing the driver and reinserting it.  If that causes data to flow for a 
little while, you might have this problem.  It is a known issue with some 
kinds of cards (chipsets actually).  I wish I could remember the chipset :-(

The other case I found was a NIC that would only do 50kB/s upload.  Downloads 
were just fine (100mbps).  The odd asymmetry was something I'd never seen 
before. I changed out that NIC too.  Copying ISO images didn't work so well 
at those speeds.

In both cases, it was a hardware problem.

Can you determine if the problem is in one direction or both?

What are the drivers and the cards?

Best,
Kyle

Does ifconfig show any dropped or error packets? I have had this type of 
trouble with cross-over cables. Do you have a hub or switch 
you could temporarily put in and eliminate the crossover cable.
Also this could be a bad NIC. If you have ethtool installed, what
does "ethtool eth0" report? You could  try switching out NIC's
to see if that eliminates the problem.

scp's built-in progress bar is highly misleading. I suspect it's not
accounting for local buffering. I notice this when I'm transfering over
a 56K modem link. The transfer starts out absurly fast for 56K, then
it "stalls" when in reality it's just grinding along at modem speed.

I suggest you use some other tool to get a better sense of actual 
throughput while scp is running. I like the xnetload and iftop utilities. 
Search for them at freshmeat.net.

Without email I wouldn't know a heck of a lot about Linux,
it just isn't politically correct to know about Linux.

The problem isn't her lecture style, I aced her midterm which was
basically did you get what I talked about in lecture...  The problem
is her assignments on top of the fact that the tutors decided to
be absent for the first four weeks of the term.  I aced 161 and
got a B in 163, but 202 was just impossible.  First assignment
was to program a Patricia tree, I still have no idea what that is.
She said not to google and didn't explain what they are, the 
example diagram was ambiguous.  Add to this that you're supposed 
to be dealing with function overloading C++ style and/or you have 
to write all the standard C libraries in two weeks time, you have 
a real headache.  She just didn't teach adequately.  Maybe the 
new 202, no C at the end, is better.  I for one need more help 
on how to debug, editor tricks, etc.  For a sophomore level 
course, it was overkill.

She does a good job with linked list programming.  Why do
I have to apologize for having trouble anyways?  I'm not
saying I've written the best stuff lately, but I'm not the
only one to get stuck in an advanced C++ course.  I
do apologize for being cynical.  I hope I'm not singled
out as the only one who vents, I'm certainly not the
only one.

Thank you for explaining IMAP more clearly.  If fetchmail 
doesn't tell the IMAP server to mark messages as read, it 
has to keep a local list to avoid fetching them multiple 
times.  Without the fetchall, even if the keep option is 
on, fetchmail appears to act just like evolution.  
If keep is omitted, does fetchmail treat an imap account 
like a pop3 account?

AFAIK, clamav doesn't scan for spyware and squid has no power over
cookies.

That's one option... or you can just copy all of the files into a
directory on the hard disk.

There's no reason to copy the disk image.

[By the way, to mount a CDROM disk image on a hard disk, use something
like this:
mount -o loop -t iso9660 ./disk_image /mnt/pount/here]

I thought you all might like to know that the American Electronic's

Here is the link to the Aea's statement by Jim Craven:

  http://www.leg.state.or.us/deckert/Deckert_Minnis_10_17_03.pdf

Jim Craven, one of HB 2892's main opponents was on hand to compliment
Minnis at the ceremony. You may remember Jim Craven as an opponent of
HB-2892 and SB-941.

Representative Minnis killed HB-2892 cart blanc.

Then the two of them had a dinner party. "Let them eat cake."

Yep. Do the dd as you suggest. Let's say you end up with
/usr/src/encyclopedia.iso and you want to mount it as
/mnt/encyclopedia:

  mkdir /mnt/encyclopedia
  mount /usr/src/encyclopedia.iso /mnt/encyclopedia \
        -t iso9660 -o ro,loop

Then add an entry for it into /etc/exports:

  /mnt/encyclopedia  192.168.1.0/24(ro,all_squash)

Then start nfsd or rerun exportfs. On a Red Hat system, it'd be

  /etc/init.d/nfs start # or restart, depending

Of course, all this shouldn't be done if the licensing for the
encyclopedia software prohibits this sort of shared access.

Interesting, there WASN'T A U.S. flag on their web page though and no
FAQ on how to determine If they are legit.  If the tool were free as 
in, here is the source code, verification becomes a matter of 
taking that code to a trusted reviewer.  It's hard to tell if 
it's even legal to use this in the U.S.  There's a suggestion
PC magazine approves, I suppose that would be the way to
get it.

How does spyware work in general?  I keep hearing about a registry
in Windows that must determine how Windows interacts with local
software and it's own software, why isn't this secured by Windows
designers?

It's one of a number of sites that suggests Microsoft isn't just
leaving privacy problems in their software, but perhaps trying
to profit from them as well.  What other reason is there for
file formats that contain past deleted information, username, 
etc. that a user probably doesn't want other people
to see without their knowledge?  Maybe this is why Office 
files are so big.  I'm surprised there isn't a cleaning
tool for Office files before sending them anywhere.  How
about other file types?  Is this a unique problem for
Office files?

I don't know what Alexa is nor do I know how it infects the
registry.  Ad aware 6, not 5, does manage to find it though.  
I wonder if Spybot can find it?

most of your questions are answered by the fetchmail man page.  I
don't think there are many people in the world who can answer
these questions without looking up the answers.  fetchmail is
complicated enough to be difficult to remember, and not
interesting enough to spend the effort to remember, since it
isn't knowledge that needs to be applied continually.  I bet most
people find out enough about fetchmail to configure it for their
needs just once, and then forget about it until something changes
or breaks.

for things like this, looking up the answers yourself is really
much faster than asking someone to look it up for you.

I'm on the side of limited government and the delegation of
responsibility to individuals who are accountable for those decisions.

Packing the law books with more laws will not help open source (or
proprietary software).... It will just make me (a small business
owner) spend more and more money on attorneys in order to figure out
what the hell I'm supposed to do with the software I create and use.

In the case of these bills, requiring certain special interest groups
get attention by the bureaucrats, will just force us to hire more (and
smarter) bureaucrats, thereby spending more of our money employing
people who could be doing something productive with their lives.

If the open source community wants to help the propogation of open 
source, then do 2 things:  1) write more CODE or work on code that
is being used and 2) work to REMOVE legislation that forces decision
makers to give unbalanced attention to special interest groups.

If open source is the highest quality and the playing field is level,
then it will win.  (In fact, I think it'll win even if the playing
field isn't level -- I'm about 90% free of proprietary software
myself.)

[grin]  Sorry for the diatribe.  But, YES, I think it's good that
the bill was killed, even if it was killed for other reasons.

The problem with that is when you get into multiple levels of quoting,
in which things are out of order and clear context.

And since we were talking about job skills recently, this is an
important one: being able to gather information efficiently and
precisely.

It could be searching online. Being able to form queries well for
Google takes real skill. It's the difference between finding it on the
first page or spending all afternoon trolling through useless
hits. And if you know you have the skill, you can quickly rule out
either Google or your query and look for other sites, such as the
developers site or the mailing list archives. As a librarian's son, I
can say this isn't a skill that just pops out of the air.

It could be a matter of reading the manual. This takes several forms,
from the aforementioned just reading the online website of the packge,
to the man pages shipped with the product (gasp!), to finding third
party websites with supplementary information.

It could be just experimenting on your own. Knowing how to be cautious
enough to experiment with a program without destroying your system is
a skill that takes time to learn. Questions you can ask yourself like
"What is the nature of this program?", "Are there options that disable
it from doing anything?", "Can I create a sandbox for this program?",
"Is this from a trusted, competent source?", "Can I easily back up my
data in a temporary directory?", and "Can I understand the source code
if I just don't understand what's going on?". Overall, though, just
playing around can teach you about a program's behavior.

Or it could be the topic brought up: talking to others. As mentioned,
this takes more time. In email, there's tremendous turn-around time
that you could've been spending finding a solution using one of the
above techniques. If it's in a more interactive form, like irc, it
takes time to build up relationships and find a place where competent
people hang out frequently enough. But in both of the previous cases,
you have the danger of being The Boy Who Cried Wolf. If you ask too
many trivial questions and piss people off, they'll start ignoring
your questions outright. (Perhaps forcing one to invent new account
names to try to get around peoples' email filters.)

These are skills, not just your own traits. And they are all equally
important. This is the Information Age, but that doesn't mean you have
to *have* information. It means you have to have the skills to
maneuver through, and manipulate information resources
efficiently--there's too much for you alone to know it all, all the
time. These skills are why people will hire you (if they're smart
enough to want their company to succeed).

I believe you can learn about Linux from taking Windows classes--that
whining about not being able to take Linux classes is just
counterproductive to your education.[1] Am I nuts? I don't think so:
knowing about Windows can help you appreciate how Linux is
different--it can highlight things you wouldn't otherwise notice and
help sharpen your ability to see important concepts. It isn't about
learning Linux or learning Windows--it's about developing the skills
to be able to see quickly what the core information is that you need
to get your job done. Using Linux or Windows, either formally or at
home, as a learning medium only provides a context within which to
develop basic skills, much as learning arithmetic first helps you
build up to, say, analytical calculus.

As has been belaboured already--job skills fade. Knowing core concepts
and having the information skills to apply them efficiently is how to
build a career. Avoiding classes because you "only want to learn
Linux" relegates you to being a "Linux janitor" for your career. And
when the budget cuts come and people are asked to "chip in and clean
up themselves", or the company can outsource it to a "sanitation"
company, your chances of staying around are slim.

Let the flames commence.


[1] I am also, by the way, a proponent of learning both functional and
procedural languages.[2] Being able to see solutions to problems from
radically different angles is more valuable than being able to just
bang away and solve something inefficiently.[3]

[2] Such as C vs LISP; or Perl vs Prolog; or whatever.

[3] Just as being able to see when it is appropriate to bang out a
duct tape and glue solution vs solving something correctly is also a
valuable skill--understanding the balance and how they interact (not
mutually exclusive) is hard.

I doubt that's ever the case. As a filesystem, they present the exact
same semantics to userspace. There're only compelling reasons not
to. Such as for /boot--it checks so fast and is typically so small, a
journal is a waste of time, performance- and disk-space-
wise. Filesystems where you depend on atime but have socket files
(such as /tmp) can make the system essentially 'ping' the hard drive
continuously. And other examples you can cook up.

/boot is better "mkfs'd" as ext2 so that one needn't rely on journaling
filesystem tools on the rescue media to at least boot the machine. 

This gets especially important with LVM, as many rescue CD's and floppys
do not include "lvmtools."

There are some subtleties that makes true even though the tools on the
rescue media is available. One is that not having to worry about the
integrity of the filesystem _and_ the journaling structure.

Carla mentioned not to use journaling filesystems for something--as in
it simply won't work--and it seems like she's right... Is it for raw
Oracle database partitions?

The bill would not have affected small businesses. It was about
requiring state government offices to prove that they had considered
software from sources other than the ones who took them out to lunch,
bought them concert tickets, contributed to their boss' political
campaigns, etc.

In theory, this is the way it should work. In practice, it is almost
impossible to get rid of old legislation except by passing new
legislation that explicitly overrides the old.

And I don't think there's a lot of 'forcing' going on, just a lot of
'gentle persuading'. Mostly backed up by money, which isn't a big part
of open source marketing.

I need a little more convincing that you personally are a representative
model of state government software selection practices before I accept
that the field doesn't need leveling.

Yeah, I installed the Google Toolbar. Makes all the difference. But the

The flags are links to different languages. Since the default language 
is english., it would be redundant to have a US flag.

TechTV often recommends this tool on both Call for Help and The Screen 
Savers. I have found their recommendations to usually be on target.

Unfortunately, the open to peer source review does not often exist in 
the Windows world and since this is a Windows tool, you get what you 
get.

As far as legal to use in the US, I really don't think that you 
understand what the tool does. I would think that pretty much any tool 
that audits your own system and removes stuff that you don't want 
installed would have to be legal. It your system and I don't think that 
our legal system is so fouled up that we can't decide what programs are 
installed or are not installed on our own computers. One day we might 
get there but fortunately we still have some freedoms.

SpyBot has a database of known cookies, registry entries , and 
executables that match the know signatures of common spyware. Sometimes 
these are benign and sometimes they are real issues.

As far as MS controlling what gets added to the registry.... do you 
really want to have them decide what programs you are allowed to 
install? Spyware is usually installed by the user. The are often hidden 
in thing such as weather applets or smileys to put in your email. 
Spyware is more a user education issue than anything else. In the 
Windows world , many users just click ok to anything.

Often these tools check for different things. using Ad aware in 
addition doesn't really hurt anything and could find something the 
other missed.

A cursory look tells me the flag has to do with which language is used.

Past deleted information in a file could be a way to get back to old 
copies of the file.  If a document's format is something someone would 
like to use for another document, they might just erase the info from 
the old one and input the new.  However, the old info might be recoverable.

Cleaners are probably a good idea for many of the formats.

If you're a small business who pays taxes it would have. Moreover, it
would have helped spur the State's local economy by lessing the State's
software licensing costs and increasing it's use of local consulting
firms.

Agreed. 

I would also submit that HB 282 and SB 941 were appropriate as 1) while
many open source products are superior to proprietary projects, they're
simply considered partly for the reasons you outlined above and partly
for fear of a loss of discount or software audit. On the "softer" side,
there's also a kind of religion in the server room for Microsoft
software. I used to think that it was limited to the Administrator level
and below, but I learned during the Legislative session that it goes
right up to the CIO level as well.

While I'm not a legislative expert, this seems to ring true.

I not sure what difference the level of "persuasion" makes. On thing is
for certain: Rep. Barnhart and other Representatives' offices have files
that are thick with letters of support for this bill by an overwheming
majority. However strong or light the "persuasion" was on the part of
the lobbyists, it was enough to override the will of the Oregon voter.

In the dynamics of a free market you're right.

The trouble is that we're facing a monopoly, not a free market. If you
think Microsoft is dominant now, think about what it would be like
without even a hint of the DOJ's anti-trust suit against the software
giant (weak remedies aside).

Even without a monopoly in the market, we're in fiscal budget problems
_now_. We're paying taxes monies to be shipped to Redmond Washington
that we don't have to _now_. If a better alternative is available at a
better value then buying expensive software anyway needs to stop _now_.

Please review just some of the documentation here:

  http://www.mwvlug.org/open_source_cd/index.htm

You may also find this interesting:

  http://www.oregonfollowthemoney.org/Press/jun1303.htm

I went through one of the BSA's licensing audits at a company I used to
work for. Technicians started disappearing after they levied a fine
against us, okay? I can also tell you that opposition to any "talk of
open source" definitely stiffened after the audit, alright?

Please note the "Single Vendor Issues" section. If you need more
documentation please feel free to contact me off-list; I would be happy
to provide you with all the written material you need to convince you
that the playing field is definitely not level and that these guys care
more about shareholder value than they do about client value.

that's too cautious.  destroying a system is one way to learn how
it works, and also learn how to avoid destroying systems
inadvertently.  this strategy tends to work better for simple
systems than complicated systems.  make sure you can easily
restore or reinstall.  make sure it's isolated enough from other
systems.

Details, details. :-) The point is, experimentation is an important
part. Even blindly.

BTW-this is a fun thing you can do with uml. Screw up a system in a
sublte way, and then send the image to someone else as a "homework

A while ago LILO didn't like most of the journaling filesystems much 
(particularly Reiser).  But, that was solved along with the cylinder 1024 
problem etc.  I assume that Grub had this solved about the same time or 
earlier.

Generally, the only reason I can see for a separate boot partition and use of 
ext2 (not specifically non-journalling, but _just_ ext2) is that the various 
rescue disks/systems _all_ could handle ext2, but were indifferent or had 
varying support for the major journaling filesystems.  Since these rescue 
systems often don't support the particularly journalling system you want to 
use (you being the general you), it is wise to have /boot on a separate 
partition since you might just be able to get to your kernel then.

The same argument goes for having /boot be outside of LVM as Cooper pointed 
out.

That's the only set of reasons I can think of.  The lack of support in rescue 
disks is still an issue if you use JFS or XFS often.  Reiser seems to be 
better supported, but ext3 might be the best supported (since you can mount 
it as ext2 in a pinch).

Best,
Kyle

I think I have just read an argument from an old-fashioned Republican.
The kind of person who screams that government should not spend a dime
more than it absolutely has to -- unless it concerns a contract that
person has submitted, in which case the government MUST pay top dollar.

I, for one, see nothing wrong with asking for justification for paying
money for software when alternatives can be downloaded & installed from
the Internet at little to no cost. Unfortunately, Minnis & the AeA
don't want to justify this procedure; they would rather have a special
spending account with no limits & no accountability when it comes to
software.

When I first started using journaling file systems on my laptop I found it
really hurt the battery life. Then I started mounting with the noatime option
and that seemed to take care of it.

I echo the other comments about /boot. It's so small and so infrequently
modified that there's not much to gain from journaling. Better to save
the overhead disk space on such a small partition and suffer the relatively
small fsck time after a crash.

If even the small post-crash fsck time on /boot in intollerable, one way to
avoid it is to mount /boot as read-only. Just remember to remount it as
read-write for those kernel updates.

Terry

P.S. Take care when doing a spell-check on a document with "fsck"
in it. Kmail's spell checker suggested a rather rude replacement.

I would imagine that there could be some utilities that depend on
filesystem-specific file attributes, yeah?

That wouldn't preclude using ext3 instead of ext2, however, because, as
far as I know, they share all the same file attributes.

But someone will have to repeat this if Carla's going to read it because
she thinks ignorance is bliss.

Well, yeah, specifically. In general, though, "journaling vs
non-journaling", I think my statement holds. :-)

Yes, because it is obviously only republicans that are awarded
overpriced contracts.  I'll bet it's a conspiracy.  I'll bet some dudes
in black showed up right after you hit the send button, right?

FWIW, I think the gov't shouldn't spend a dime more than it reasonably
needs to... it isn't the government's place to run our lives for us.  I
think they should work as hard to make every penny stretch as we worked
making the penny they took in the first place.  Software fees are just
one facet of this.  Schools are a big one; the amount of waste in
schools is quite something.  I would, honestly, be somewhat surprised if
this bill split down the party lines... it doesn't seem to be something
any one party would be more likely to love or hate than another would
be.

True enough. In Texas it was being pushed by republicans. In Oregon the 
Republican committee chair was for HB 2892 until he was leaned on be 
Karen Minnis.

I had the chance to talk to Rep. Kitts (R), who was elected as a staunch 
conservative, when I asked him if he'd support a bill that made the 
government consider software that was free, he only glared at me because 
he's a fiscal conservative who seemed to feel sold out by his party's 
leadership.

Much as I'm tempted to try to help paint the whole Republican party with 
this, it really seemed to rest on Karen Minnis' shoulders. Karen's up 
for re-election in the fall...and as close as troutdale.

Well looky what 'man chattr' says:

"       A file with the 't' attribute will not have a partial block fragment 
at  the  end  of  the
       file  merged with other files (for those filesystems which support 
tail-merging).  This is
       necessary for applications such as LILO which read  the  filesystem  
directly,  and  which
       don't  understand  tail-merged files.  Note: As of this writing, the 
ext2 or ext3 filesys-
       tems do not (yet, except in very experimental patches) support 
tail-merging."

ReiserFS uses tail-merging, I don't know about JFS or XFS.

Or someone who does not understand how the process actually works.

State government works on an "old boys network".  Projects and contracts
are not handed out due to merit, they are handed out to people who have
the proper connections.

Anyone who believes that the process gives equal attention to open
source projects or even obviously useful technologies has never worked
for the state.

The idea that Conservitives(tm) want to spend less money for government
is absurd in its face.  They want to spend less money on the poor and
disenfranchised, unless it is to punish them.  They will spend plenty of
money on their own pet projects, they just have different priorities.

The only difference in spending habits between the "Liberals" is when
you get the bill.  "Liberals" raise taxes. "Conservatives" raise taxes
for your children.

The LAST thing they want is accountability.  There is no money in that. 
If they had to choose projects on technical merits, they would not be
able to pad out their bills as much.

Extended file attribute support is iffy at best for anything but
Linux-specific file systems.

I think it's demonstration enough that it's something that could get
full-spectrum support.  I'm socialist, I think it should have passed.
So obvious, even Rush would have seen it.

Conservatives figure out ways to get that money back through
ill-gotten contracts, Liberals tend to put it towards something
everybody can use.

Is there a difference? Lurk long enough and you'll find that plug-talk 
is essentially unused. Creating plug-politics would probably be just as 
quiet as plug-talk since the majority want to discuss relevant technical 
issues instead of sifting through bias opinion and speculation about 
what the Government is doing. The fact that this is where most of the 
groups activity is explains why conversations about politics end up on 
this technical forum, it's simply the size of the audience. You see, it 
makes no sense to climb up onto a soap-box to rant in a place where 
nobody will be there to listen.

Just my observation, no offense intended.

Yes, there's something about using the option "notail" when using ReiserFS 
with LILO at least (and maybe GRUB, not sure).

Forgot about that part. It's become such a habit to use a tiny /boot in ext2 
and the rest in ext3 or Reiser, that I hadn't thought about it until you 
brought it up.  Good to have my assumptions questioned now and then.

Best,

of course, another interpretation is that the politics are not cleanly
separable from the rest, when it comes to open source (heck, even the name
is political since it explicitly draws a contrast with the
alternatives...)

I think there is a clear separation between the political posts that
were about the facts of the bill, (where to read it, who was
voting for and against), and these postings;"I think I have just
read an argument from an old-fashioned Republican.""Or someone who does
not understand how the process actually works.""Conservatives figure out
ways to get that money back through ill-gotten contracts, Liberals tend
to put it towards something everybody can use."

One type is useful for being informed no matter what side of the issue
you are on, the other is pretty much posting fertilizer that generates
more posting fertilizer.

Thank you

I fail to see how one can fabricate a parallel between politics and 
topics like reading tcpdump output but, then again, that might just be 
me. All things considered, I'm of the opinion that a discussion of 
passing laws to give open-source an edge, or advocating the demise of 
Legislators that block said laws, is probably best suited for the 
plug-government list (after all, I believe that's why plug-government 
was created).

OK, I finally got around to connecting my HP Deskjet 960 using the
IOgear USB print server.  I'll tell you how I did it, and I hope you'll
tell me how I *should* have done it!

Relevant info:
 * The product box and documentation mention the word "Linux" exactly
once each.
 * The unit has a sticker with the MAC address printed on it.
 * The CD contains a Windows utility (PSAdmin) which can search the
network for (their?) print servers and let you configure the devices.
 * The PSAdmin utility shows that on installation the IP address, subnet
mask, and gateway are all zero, and that DHCP is off!
 * Once these values were all set (I used a static IP instead of DHCP so
I can find it later), it was easy to use printerdrake to set up the
device as an LPR/LPD server using the IP address and the default
destination printer name "lp".
 * Once configured, the device also supports IPP using URI's like these:
"socket://192.168.1.xx/" or "lpd://192.168.1.xx/lp"
 * The device supports configuration using telnet or http, but (correct
me if I'm wrong) a valid IP address is needed to use these methods.

OK, so here's my question:
How could I have connected to this device from Linux to configure its IP
settings if all I know about it is its MAC address?

Thanks in advance...

It is perhaps this type of thinking that lead to the situation in this
country where there is essentially no open political discourse.

Hence, we have a woefully ill-informed electorate and all the "facts" in
the world aren't going to help someone who has the wrong idea about what
real effects are the result of actual policies or changes in those
policies.

It is absolutely vital to openly discuss ideology and practice while
analyzing the various merits of each instance.

The people that would censure political discourse are those who benefit
from the status quo.

I seem to recall that plug-government was created to discuss the design,
implementation, and pitch of specific software projects to public
agencies or discuss how specific public software projects could be
re-implemented with Free Software.

I don't recall any initial discussion about politicking.

Message-ID: <1073923845.2555.3.camel@localhost>

Anybody know anything about using ifilm.com with Linux? I'm running
under Gnome 2.4, with recent mozillas (epiphany and galeon preferred),
but little in the way of Konquerer. I've got mplayer and xine, and for a
little while had the mplayerplug-in installed (but it didn't work--it
gave me audio on some video sites, but no video). Also of note --
running Debian.

Mostly the problem seemed, for a while, to be that when you hit the link
to play it, it popped up a window which tried to detect your plugins,
but that (of course) got nowhere. Any way to get beyond that?

Subject: [PLUG] Linux-friendly brokerage firm?
Message-ID: <20040112163916.GA2831@sulu.pheon.com>

Actually, it is a question of browser-friendly.  I quit my last
brokerage firm for my IRA when I couldn't get their site to work with
any of the browsers I tried (Mozilla, Galeon, Opera).  I have been
using Bidwell & Co here locally for about a year now and it works OK,
though I have problems occasionally.

Now Bidwell has been sold to Ameritrade and asking them about browser
support got a not-so-good reply.

    Below are the minimum and recommended system requirements for the
    two most popular computer platforms, Internet Explorer and Netscape
    Navigator.  Other platforms, such as Linux/UNIX and WebTV, may be
    used, but the compatibility of some of our products may vary.  If you
    are having problems accessing parts of our site, it is recommended
    that you update your browser to a more recent version.

    MINIMUM SYSTEM AND BROWSER REQUIREMENTS
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    - Windows 95/98/NT/2000/ME/XP
    - 200mhz Pentium or better
    - 64MB RAM
    - 800x600 screen setting or better
    - Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or higher
    - Netscape Communicator 4.5 or higher
    - AOL 6.0 or higher

Any recommendations for a clued-in brokerage?  I have a preference for
it having a local office, but that is not an absolute requirement.

You can of course itemize ALL of this waste and will publish it, right?

Note: one or two examples or waste do not prove the kind of massive
waste you are claiming.  Schools are dreadfully underfunded.  One thing
that has been shown to consistently improve students performance is a
lower student:teacher ratio and yet due to continued funding cuts that
ratio continues to climb.  Is it any surprise students performance is
spotty.

FWIW, I tried to do the ifilm.com thing a while ago, might have even
posted here about it... and was stuck in exactly the same place.  IIRC,
I tried Moz, Firebird, Galeon, Epiphany, Konqueror, and Opera.  The site
really seems designed for IE under Win32.  :-\

Somewhat surprisingly for such a large company, but I've found Wells
Fargo's websites to be surprisingly compatible.  So long as you meet their
functionality requirement (i.e. 128 bit SSL) they seem to work with any
browser.  Even some of their legalese documents discussing web access
include the terms "Internet Explorer, Netscape, or equivalent".  They
could have left off that "or equivalent", but didn't.

I've used their site with a while slew of browsers and never had problems
with MSIE-optimizations hosing me up.  (Konqueror, MSIE, Netscape,
Mozilla, even IBM's crappy Web Explorer on OS/2 worked...)

I'd set a followup to plug-talk, but we have reply-to munging enabled
here, so I guess it will stay here.

I don't think it is terribly unreasonable to be able to claim a facet of
the government wastes money without providing a detailed itemized
listing of every place there is waste.  Do you?

I will, however, provide one example of a large chunk of waste in our
public school system today:  sports.  IMO, far too much of the budget is
spent supporting sporting (and other extracurricular) programs while
teachers are being laid off.

Another chunk of waste is technology.  The local highschool down here
spends terrible amounts of money on Windows.  They're running a Windows
server.  They replaced a $10,000 Novell setup with this Windows
server... and with the number of systems they have (about half were
obtained directly through grants, AFAIK) the licenses on that server
have to be pretty bad.

A government agency can be dreadfully underfunded and still have massive
amounts of waste.  One doesn't exclude the other.  I think if
administrators tightened their belts a little bit and started making
cuts to things that really aren't necessary to educate our youth, they
would find student performance increasing.  How much is the head of the
Portland School District paid annually?

If the device generates traffic--like dhcp discover--ethereal (or tcpdump) 
will show the MAC and associated IP.  But since you said that was all turned 
off by default, dunno.  Good question.

There was an excellant article awhile back in Linux Journal, Linux 
Magazine, or SysAdmin Magazine on doing this.  The author went so far as 
to make them usable via a SAMBA server including auto-mounting and 
unmounting.  With a 80 GByte HD (IDE no less) youc could get 100+ CDROMs 
online.  Way cheaper than a CD changer with much less hardware failusr to 
woory about.
   The best trick I got out of it was to create an iso image it only takes 
this command

	cat /dev/sda1 > mycdrom.iso

Where sda1 is your CCROMs physical device -- not it's mount point.

I set this up for awhile at home and was even able to install and run
Windows software from the image across the network.  Worked great for my 
GPS software.

Many thanks.  They seem to focus quite strongly (and correctly in my
mind) on the browser having sufficiently robust encryption. They have
a page to test your browser for security. 
  http://www.wellsfargo.com/help/wfonline/browsertest.jhtml

Amusingly, it says "Your browser is: IE 6.0 Congratulations! You can
bank online or apply for products using this browser. Your browser
meets Wells Fargo's strict security standards, which employ some of
the strongest encryption available over the Internet."  However, I was
using Firebird and having it give IE6 as my agent.  Not much of a
test.  Even more interesting, if I use Opera 6 on Linux, Wells Fargo
says I am running Netscape 4.78 even though Opera is saying my agent
is IE5.

None the less, they are the most clueful site I've seen in a while. My
problem is usually in making mutual fund trades.  I don't trade very
often and could easily do it by phone, but I like to stir the Linux
pot occasionally with these financial folks.

Message-ID: <1073956327.24691.18.camel@kat.zotnet.com>

I am helping set a lab to teach kids software.

We are likely going to use Redhat 9.

The class calls for using the trial version of Game Maker
(www.gamemaker.nl).  I have been unable to get it to work under
wine[x].  Can wine savvy folks give it a try and see if it works?

Game Maker is cool program to write OO based games (programs).  It is a
pretty effective tool apparently, and if we could get it to work, that
would be awesome.

Either 5.x or 4.x trial versions would be fine.

If I remember, I got the program to load, but apps would not run.  I
have not tried the last wave of wine releases.

Thanks!

Yes, as a matter of fact it does. On the P120, it shows quite a few
(several per second) packet errors on the receive ("RX") line. The same
number is reported as "overruns".

I do. It's just a matter of finding the time. Since this involves a
"toy" project, it may have to wait to until the weekend. :-(

Don't have ethtool installed, but it can be done. The NIC is a PCMCIA
combo-card (NIC and modem). The only other PCMCIA NIC I have is missing
its RJ-45 dongle. Anyone know if replacements for those can be had?

I didn't even think of that, as I'm so used to ssh/scp. Trying an
alternative is a matter of getting an alternative installed and
configured. This may have to wait until the weekend. :-(

eBay.  I've got a LinkSys with a broken dongle, and I've seen them for
sale there.

That's really weird. I tried a suitably large file in the other
direction (PPC to P120), and the transfer flew right by. Great
throughput.

> What are the drivers and the cards?

The P120 is using an old Megahertz 10BT/modem combo-card. It uses the
smc91c92_cs and serial_cs drivers. AFAIK, the modem is treated as an
entirely separate device. Both modules are loaded at the same time,
though. The PPC has a 10/100/1000 MB ethernet adapter, which
uses the "sungem" module.

That's the second suggestion that scp's progress bar may be bogus. How
might I determine for sure? I can 'ls -l' the same directory that scp is
copying the file into, and the file size reported is the same as what
scp says its transfered.

You can use rsync.  It doesn't have to use encryption.

You'll need to bring the interface down first, with 'ifconfig ethX
down'.

Could be a bad connection on the receive pair of your Ethernet cable.

Use 'ttcp' to test your throughput; you set one system up as the sender
and one as the receiver and it'll stream data across the network.

I wouldn't place too much confidence in that testpage. Try disabling ssl
completely in your browser and watch it continue to tell you your
browser is acceptable.

Moreover, From the "Browser Q&A" link:
"What type of encryption do I need?
To conduct Online Banking with Wells Fargo, the standard 40-bit or
56-bit encryption that comes with browsers such as Netscape Navigator
and Microsoft Internet Explorer is acceptable."

So much for strong encryption. Regardless of all this, however, the
protocol strength and version used would be just one criteria to which
I'd look for a secure design and implementation of a site.

Ah, thanks again Wil.  Another nifty gem for the tool kit.  In the FWIW 
department,  anytime I've seen this issue it is ethernet related.  Duplex 
mismatch and speed settings are the usual suspects, especially prevalent 
on networks with Sun hosts and Cisco network gear. Very rarely see this 
with x86 linux hosts though.

get with the program and stop stomping reply-to, letting people set it
as appropriate to move discussions to different lists or private
email.  If your MUA doesn't have reply-to-list yet, file a bug report,
switch to one that does, or better yet, submit a patch to implement it
in your favorite MUA.

I see this quite frequently with Linux on x86 and 3COM adapters, it's 
definitely worth investigating here. We have several hundred slower 
333Mhz HP pizza boxes with 3COM adapters that are slowly being converted 
to Linux and all of them are getting the modules.conf  'options 3C59x 
full_duplex=on'  entry.

Mr. Stock is a Beverly Hills based online broker that's Linux-friendly.
It's not full-service but good for options trading for small investors.

It would not work with Crossover Office 2.1.0, but that may be because
of what I am running.  (Fedora 1 with kernel 2.6.1.) Crossover bitches
about a security patch getting in the way.

I will try the latest WineX as well.

Yes, 'ls -l" will tell you how much has actually transferred so far, with
perhaps some very small delay because of buffering on the receiving end.

scp's progress bar is misleading only when it's pushing data. When it's
pulling data the progress bar is seems reasonably accurate.

I've stayed with the same IP from ATTBI/Comcast for about half a year.
Then, today, DHCP suddenly renegotiated new lease, and it's a totally
different network: used to be 12.203.20.0, now it's 67.171.188.0
Anyone else on Comcast saw similar change today?

Happen to my friend in Vancouver at the time Comcast took the place
of attbi. Don't know if there was a speed change or not. No
complaints, anyway.

You'll have to close all connections and bring the network down at least 
before the module is freed up.  After that you need to make sure that no 
servers are tying things up (Apache on the NIC IP or something).

Hmm, so it does seem to be dependent on direction?  Is that what I'm 
understanding?

When I was trying to figure out my NIC problem, I tried swapping cables etc. 
Nothing made a difference but the NIC itself.  Outbound, 50kB/s, inbound lots 
more.  See if it isn't a flaky cable.  If you can just reverse the cable and 
get the reversed results, you might have a flaky cable.  That's cheaper than 
a NIC :-)

Do you have any other machines you can test against the laptop and PPC 
machine?  It could be the PPC machine that has a problem with inbound 
traffic.

SMC makes one of the chipsets that apparently has the problem with high 
bandwidth according to someone I know.  Which chipset it is, I don't know, 
but it was fairly old (six or seven years I think).  Can you check the 
interrupts and make sure that the ether isn't sharing with anything else?  
Laptops often have some weird interrupt assignments.

Note that the asymmetry I saw was not latency, but bandwidth.  Latency was the 
same in both directions.  It was weird.  Maybe the card was going bad?

Best,
Kyle

You've been migrated from the old AT&T subnet to the new Comcast subnet.

I think it also involves a physical change of network, but I can't 
recall. I'll try to remember to find out...

Yep. I went from 12.x.x.x to 67.x.x.x as well. Thanks for your post.
I'd gotten out of the habit of checking my address and would have been
cut off from my home machine had I not seen your message.

By the way: Anyone else who's experienced this address change may also
experience an unsettling side effect. Some large ISPs (including AOL,
iirc) block mail the comes directly from *.client.comcast.net
addresses. They expect legit mail to come from Comcast's real mail
servers and judge messages relayed from *.client.comcast.net to be
spam or viruses.

So if you send outbound mail directly from your home network, you
might have to do some minor surgery to route mail correctly. If you
use sendmail, then

  cd /etc/mail
  echo 'aol.com     esmtp:[smtp.comcast.net]' >>mailertable
  makemap hash mailertable < mailertable

It means that the IP address that you used to use is owned by ATT. 
Comcast is slowly reIPping (is that a word?) it's network to start using
it's IPs so that ATT can have their's back.

I should have stated my question better. 24.x.x.x is Comcast, not
attbi? When I did a whois from the command line, it couldn't find a
match. A web-based whois came back with Comcast.

Actually, AOL properties have been doing this to 12.0.0.0/8 addresses
already, for some time now. At least IME.

Subject: [PLUG] Linux/NT/LAN Admin Positions Available
Message-ID: <20040114021935.GC13109@subtend.net>

This hasn't been officially posted in HR, and the position is in Seattle, WA.
 I just gave notice to leave.  I have been hired on as a Network Engineer for
PSU.  I would like to collect some resumes to pass on to management before I
leave as I'm sure they won't have a clue with regards to the skill set.

Linux admin:

* RH7.x/RH9 admin, installation, server builds (Dell hardware)
* NIS, NFS, am-utils
* Apache/MySQL, phpwiki, phpmyadmin
* Legato Networker (backups) both server & client (a pain) with SDLT's
* Lotus Domino runs on linux (very little admin on this as it is managed out
of Campbell, CA headquarters.. could get a way with no experience on this)
* CUPS
* Samba
* Request Tracker
* Cacti

Solaris admin:

* Primary NFS filer runs Solaris 6 (Auspex)
* Expand virtual filesystems using Auspex solaris tools
* Maintain NFS shares
* Legato Networker client (easy)

NT admin:

* Two win2k boxes, all clients migrated to win2k domain/AD (all Dell's)
* A couple old NT4 boxes with data still need to be migrated to above win2k
boxes
* OS installs, patches, updates, software installation (MS tools)
* Cygwin, ssh, cvs on windows
* Legato Networker client (easy)
 
PC admin:

* Typical PC repair stuff
* Dell hardware for primary desktops
* Generic's for engineers development & lab
* IBM/Dell laptops

Network admin:

* Summit 10/100/1000 switches
* Vlan's with 802.1q trunking
* Documentation of network
* Standard closet stuff: patch cables, troubleshooting etc.

Additional network admin (will probably move to being handled from
Campbell now that I am leaving):

* Cisco VPN concentrator 3000
* VPN 3000 clients (linux, win2k, Mac OS X)
* IMA-T1 (T1x3) ATM network connecting two sites
* QoS & ATM CoS on ATM connection for voice system & video conferencing
* Shoreline VoIP system
* RH9 + iptables for firewall & DMZ's
* Wireless AP's: orinoco
* Cisco 2600 with modems attached for dialup


Basically I am the only IT person for this office of about 30 people, all
engineers & engineering management (software dev).  No admin staff, no sales
force, no marketing.  This is an engineering office with headquarters in
Campbell, CA.  No manager on site. You will be it. :) Laid back environment
with somewhat poor IT management coming from Campbell, but you have the
freedom to implement what you want if it helps the engineers.  If you can't
self manage, you will get squashed.


company: Equator Technologies, Inc.
website: http://www.equator.com/
send resume to me: krisa at equator.com
subject: "SeattleAdmin"

Additionally, my manager in Campbell is leaving as well.  This job includes
all the above, only a larger building of about 100 and includes all types of
departments.  Additional job responsibilities include:

* Budgeting, forecasting
* Hire/fire/manage IT staff
* Technology selection (direction from engineering)
* Other pointy hair type manager stuff
* in Campbell, CA (15 minutes from downtown San Jose, CA)
* old HPUX machines (PA-RISC C160's)
* more Solaris: solaris 6-9
* 26 computer LSF cluster, mixed linux, HPUX and solaris
* HP procurve main network switch & routing
* OSPF
* Cisco PIX firewall
* Internet T1's on Cisco 2600
* manage one other person: NT admin, takes care of most PC stuff and non-unix
stuff

Change your subject to "CampbellAdmin" if interested in the Campbell job.

Is there an IMAP server for Linux that supports both subfolders and files
in the same folder?  I have a client that wants to migrate to a Linux mail
server and their users have mail directory trees with both subfolders and
files under a directory.  Last I heard, UW-IMAP didn't support this...  :(

Subfolder and files?  Files on an IMAP server?

Do you mean subfolders where the parent folder is able to hold both
subfolders and email messages?

That occasionally happens.  Deal with it.  Knowing that you're on a
DHCP network, why is this a problem?  Were you not prepared for the
obvious or something?

There's no mbox support in binc-imap, though.

Dovecot: http://dovecot.procontrol.fi/

I've been running it for a couple weeks. It's performed very well, but
in what is admittedly a light-use situation.

To get the message/folder mingling to happen, you've got to use the
Maildir storage format; traditional mbox won't cut it.

Cyrus IMAPd and Courier-IMAP should do this as well. Though Cyrus has
it's own mailstore format and Courier implies maildir.

Interesting tidbit from the ISTS list:

   Title: OSDL sets up $10m Linux legal fund
   Source:   vnunet.com
   Date Written:  January 12, 2004
   Date Collected: January 12, 2004
The Open Source Development Labs (OSDL), current home of Linus Torvalds
and the Linux kernel, is building a $10 million legal defense fund for
Linux users targeted by litigation from the SCO (Santa Cruz Operation)
Group. The fund, to be built from donations from individuals,
organizations, and companies, has so far collected $3 million in pledges
from such companies as International Business Machines (IBM), Intel,
MontaVista, and others. The fund will also cover Linus Torvalds's legal
fees. According to a statement from OSDL chief executive Stuart Cohen,
OSDL is becoming the "center of gravity" for Linux, and therefore is
responding to a call for leadership, and will work with others in the
Linux industry against SCO legal threats.

I wonder what their expectations are that they'll have to use this.

Maybe because qmail invented[1] Maildir, but qmail does mbox too[2],
e.g. .qmail:

  /home/russell/Mail/inbox.mbox

[1] [...] or was invented _with_ qmail.

[2] you probably don't want to do mbox delivery to an NFS mounted
    directory, though.  At least not according to the qmail docs.

  This was in yesterday's "Oregonian". According to the paper, they already
have collected $3 million from Intel, IBM and one other player.

Since the topic is not appropriate here I will just say that I disagree
that you have shown any significant waste.  I do think it unreasonable
to claim that falling short of perfection is major failing in any
organization.  So I was just holding you to the same standard you see to
be holding the schools to.

Neat, so the device is listening to port 20560, never seen that one, neither

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0401141006120.23294-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

The Mozilla Site seems to have only one reference to XForms and that is a 
request for XForms support -- dated quite awhile ago.  I did a search 
using google but got even more confused.

My understanding -- now -- is ther is a XForms for the X-Windows System 
and a XForms from the W3C.  I'm looking to process the W3C XForms either 
in Mozilla or by Mozilla launching a XForms application.

Any ideas or pointers?


Best,
Rod

Rod,

  Yes, the ol' xforms UI toolkit still stuggles for survival in the modern
world. It's one of the two UIs available for LyX (the other is Qt). Most
folks like the qt interface (me included).

  If you google for xforms you should find it.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0401141029360.13865@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  We've been running OO.o here since Microsoft had Corel kill WordPerfect
for linux. The application is installed in /opt/OpenOfficex.x.x on the
server, and that filesystem is exported via nfs. So is /home.

  Until today I've upgraded OO.o without problems. But, I installed version
1.1.0 last year and this morning my fiancee wanted to run the application on
a networked workstation, but failed at the attempt.

  I remembered that I needed to run /opt/OpenOffice1.0.0/program/setup for
her -- as a user -- and I tried to do this (as root) on the networked host.
Unlike each previous version, this time the attempt fails because X cannot
open the display on 0:0. But, X is running on that workstation as is
sylpheed and jpilot. Both the server and the other host are running RH 7.3.

  I'm really puzzled by this inability to set her up as a user on the remote
workstation. All thoughts and suggestions welcome.

TIA,

Rich

  Well, something else is going on. I could not open a terminal window when
logged in as her for the same X server reason. But, when I logged her out
and logged in as me, X fired up with no problems.

  I don't have a clue now as to why this workstation is mis-behaving for
her.

Yes, there are two totally different things called xforms. One
is a gui toolkit which is not what you are looking for
and the other is XForms the new W3C web forms recommendation.
I don't know of any Mozilla support for XForms, but
there is the X-smiles browser which may support what you want

Got one Tuesday as well.  What's funny is that for a while there, I'd
get a 12.224.x.x address if I connected to the modem via ethernet, and a
24.x.x.x address if I connected via USB.

Also, the connection would die after about a day if I was using USB.
Maybe some sort of DHCP renewal issue?  We'll have to see.

Oh, well, gotta migrate to something cheaper.

That's good. How about this. I haven't done this in a while but for
me, Windows would get one IP and Linux would get another. Go figure.
It's like they ask differently or something.

Subject: [PLUG] Perl Socket - disconnect after period of timeB
Message-ID: <20040114131146.Q14562@kraken.magnetinternet.com>

I have a device that normally has a serial connection directly to a
printer.  As new data on the device becomes available then the lines are
printed automatically.
I've connected a serial to ethernet adapter so I can connect to it
over the network.
When you telnet to it, it sends you whatever data it has collected so far.
There's no prompt or login.

I'm trying to write a Perl script that will connect to this device, grab
the data that's currently available, then disconnect.

Net::Telnet isn't working for me because it requires some sort of prompt.
This device just spits out lines of data when you connect.  There's no
prompt telling you to start and no signal that it's done.

I tried using the Socket module, which works fine to grab the data, but
I'm not sure how to close the connection.  I want to make sure I grab
every available line, but then disconnect after a set period of time
because the device doesn't give any signal that it's currently done
sending data.

while (<SOCKET>) {
  print DATAFILE;
}

...works to grab each line, but then it just sits there waiting forever
for the next line.  Does anyone know how to break out of that loop if say,
5 seconds has passed and no new lines have appeared?

Thanks,
~M

Which is easier for backups?

I assume that, with either one, you just want to stop the dbms and dump to
a file and back that up.  Am I wrong?

I guess this is where y'all tell me I should be using LVM?

The standard way to backup PostgreSQL is dump it with the pg_dump
command.  This produces a SQL script that will recreate the database
when run with the pg_sql interpreter.  The dump happens within a
transaction so it gives a consistent view of the data.  Also, the dump
does not block most other operations on the database.  I have seen
people complain that dumps are slow if the database is huge.

The on-disk database files can be copied to make a backup only if the
database server is stopped.  There isn't a mechanism to block clients
and flush the buffers to disk to put the database in a known state so
the server must be shut down.  It is possible to make a snapshot by
copying the database files and transaction logs.  LVM is supposed to
do this nicely.

Unless you have a really big database, dumps work fine.

Right.  I'm familiar with this.  I know MySQL works the same way.

Again, the same as MySQL, from my knowledge.

Count 1 for SQL-Ledger. I've used it for a couple of years. It is a nice 
package and it continues to evolve. I do wish Dieter were more open 
about the development process, but he works hard and seems to be making 
a living with it. Just last month he released a Point of Sale interface 
for it.

I'm hoping to sign a deal soon that would have us integrating SQL-Ledger 
into another open source package. I think that may be the real promise 
for SQL-Ledger, to serve as an accouning engine for other applications 
with nicer user interfaces. Building from accounting, we can offer some 
nice focused solutions.

Ken,

  I'll give that a try to install the latest mozilla. I tried running the
OO.o setup as a user and had not had xhost problems before.

Thanks,

Found it.  And it is nice be a bit of a pig performance-wise so far.  I'd 
lik eto see it work as a plugin for Mozilla or at the least have Mozilla 
call it when it gets a XForms document.

A couple of threads on the dev-moz/mozdev/moz-dev/devmoz/whatever list
lead me to think some of the Mozilla developers are angry that XForms was
being considered (and now accepted) when there was XUL and XML.

Heck all I want is a way to make nice looking but complex forms without
resorting to tables for the presentation.  I can get JavaScript to
(pre-)process the data entered but the XForms claim to ease this burden 
wouldn't be too bad.


Thanks for the reply,

You might try something like:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict
use IO::Socket::INET;

my $device = IO::Socket::INET->new('address.of.device:port')
                or die "This sucks $@\n";                               
##  Create the sock object or die
my @incoming = <$device>;                                         ## 
Should get all of the lines available
undef $device;                                                         
        ##  Kill the IO::Socket object

Count another for SQL-Ledger.  I used to use it regularly (before becoming
non-self employed) and will be trying to get it accepted by my current
employer.  Some of the better features IMO are it uses PosrgreSQL, perl,
and TeX (for some very nice looking invoices etc. in Postscript and pdf
format) and the fact you can build an invoice on a customers site (ifthey
have Internet access), print it, and hand it to them.

A few times I posted questions to the mailing list and because I paid
for support Dieter would often reply before I even saw the message make it
though the list software.  That's support!
   And the list is darn good also.  Several people with accounting 
experience to answer questions.

My take, from lurking on the PostgreSQL, is big starts around 40,000,000 
records.  Some have admitted to database this large and others just imply

I haven't done Postgres backups, but I've done lots and lots and lots with 
MySQL with between 5 and 40GB of data and 100M rows.  These are not large DBs 
by any stretch, but my applications were all 24/7 with zero allowed downtime.  
If you have allowed downtime, then taking the DB down is surely the easiest.  
If not, there're a few ways for MySQL and each has its problems:

1) dump it.  Seems like a nice solution.  It provides genuine SQL that you can 
gently massage for input into other DBs too (command line flags on mysqldump 
are key here).  However, it is not instantaneous and, depending on the table 
types you use, will lock the tables.  From what I've seen, the performance of 
mysqldump is roughly linear.  I.e. dumping 10GB of data should be about 2x 
the time to dump 5GB.  We never saw any knees in the performance curve.  It 
does dump fast, but we were dumping gigs of data.  For small stuff around 
100k rows, it is quite fast.  Have a lot of free disk space.  Note that 
network bandwidth can kill you here.  Mysqldump can easily overrun a 100mbps 
connection.  Dump local if you can.

2) Use LVM snapshots:

FLUSH TABLES
LOCK ALL TABLES FOR READ (or was it WRITE? can't remember)
FLUSH TABLES
<LVM snapshot>
UNLOCK TABLES
copy data files as needed from snapshot.

In my tests, this takes about 1-2 seconds or less regardless of the size of 
the DB.  The first FLUSH TABLES pushes most changes to disk.  That reduces 
the size of the second FLUSH TABLES which takes place when all the tables are 
locked.  I've done this on machines that have had 1-2GB of data flowing 
through them daily under high load and had no problems.

If you want to use this as a point to restart replication, you can rotate the 
logs (FLUSH LOGS) while the tables are locked.  Then, you have a coherent 
snapshot and a log file that starts with that snapshot.  Very clean.  It is 
trivial to start a MySQL slave with the results of this.

Of course, the caveat is that you need LVM and you need sufficient unallocated 
space in LVM to create the snapshot partition.  The LOCK and UNLOCK need to 
be in the same connection.  If you drop the connection MySQL will unlock the 
tables.  So, this does require a script of some sort.  Perl, Python, Ruby 
etc. are all fine.   You also need to remember to remove the snapshot when 
you are done.  You can guess why I remembered to say that :-)

I'm assuming that this works with all tables types.  I've done it with MyISAM 
and BDB tables, but not InnoDB tables.  YMMV.

We repeatedly evaluated Postgres and stuck with MySQL because we kept finding 
that Postgres docs said that until the DB was down, the data on disk wasn't 
coherent :-(  If this has changed, I'd love to know about it.  There appeared 
to be nothing like FLUSH TABLES that actually gave us a coherent disk image 
of the data.

3) make a slave replica.  Take it down, back it up, then bring it back up.  
That way nothing on the master is hit at all (including disk bandwidth) 
except for the slave resync.  This is the least intrusive method, but you do 
need two machines...  Of course, then the slave is always a hot backup. 
That's often nice to have.  We'd do it this way when we could, but sometimes 
the slave was the machine that died and we'd have to use one of the other 
methods to get the slave back up.

<opinion>

MySQL introduced subselects in version 4.1 which is now in beta I think.  
Version 5.0 was just released in an alpha form and it has stored procedures.  
The MySQL guys have a really good track record when it comes to versions 
being stable when they claim they are.  In six months or a year when 5.0 is 
stable, I really wouldn't see any functional reason to use Postgres for 
anything.

We stressed MySQL in all kinds of ways that we were not sure were going to 
work and it performed perfectly.  In five years of using MySQL, I've found 
precisely two bugs.  The first was that ELT() didn't work correctly when 
joining between a HEAP table and a disk table with some other condition that 
I forgot but it was relatively rare.  The second was that there was a single 
mutex covering all new connections.  When we had a hostname problem (we had 
an unknown host in the GRANTs and tried to log in as the user for that host), 
all of a sudden we couldn't connect to MySQL.  DNS was timing out because the 
host name was not known.  All new connections hung until that time out.  Both 
problems were fixed in 3.25.12 or so, I.e. about 4 years ago.  The optimizer 
isn't very smart, but careful checking with EXPLAIN can solve most problems 
quickly.  The optimizer is much better with the 4.x series which is now 
stable.

All the problems we ever saw with DB corruption were traced to kernel bugs 
(some of the systems were running 2.2.14 and that has a problem with high 
load), bad disks (use RAID!), bad SCSI controllers, bad glibc code or our own 
code.  We _never_ found a case of data corruption caused by MySQL.  I've seen 
it reported, but the circumstances usually looked similar to the cases we saw 
that we knew were for other reasons.  In the years I have used it, MySQL has 
proven to be one of the most solid pieces of GPLed software I've ever used.  
We had systems with upwards of 280 days of uptime on MySQL.  We only brought 
it down to do upgrades for security fixes.

I personally tell people who need full RDBMS functionality now to go with 
Postgres and avoid all Postgres-specific functionality like the plague so 
that there is some hope of porting it to another DB.  If you don't need all 
that functionality or can live with MySQL's betas (i.e. 4.1 with subselects), 
then I'd recommend MySQL.  We needed things that Postgres could definitely 
not do at the time (and it appears may still not be able to do) thus that was 
the deciding factor for us.  Some packages depend on Postgres and that will 
make the decision easier.  SQL-Ledger is one such package I think.

Dunno about that, I make backups fine by copying the files while mysql
is running. I have even tested this to confirm it works. 

Now, I wouldn't consider this the proper way, nor would I use it for a
high volume enterprise application, but it works just fine for my
purpose.

No.  Your (Bling Syndrome) modem is getting flaky on the bling.  Try
using the traditional Ethernet interface, you'll find it's a faster,
more reliable connection that's as easy to use as an ethernet adapter.

[1] Stored Procedures (in perl, python, php, c, etc etc etc...),Foreign 
Keys, Triggers, Constraints, etc...etc... are rather functional reasons.

Without these sort of features you are taking the data integrity out of 
the database and managing it in your application.

MySQL has it's ups and downs..as does PostgreSQL. I just don't see how 
you can only refer to sub selects as being enough to compete with the 
many features that PostgreSQL has that MySQL doesn't have. They both 
have their strengths and weaknesses, but if you're going to convert a 
company from a nice db like Oracle to something open source, the choice 
should be PostgreSQL. If you're converting a company from MS SQL who is 
used to stored procedures, triggers, etc... PostgreSQL is there for them.

If you're migrating from a flat file db... MySQL is a good stepping stone.

Both DHCP clients ask for the IP address they had last, and if it
doesn't bother to ask for a specific IP (like never got a lease
before, or configured specifically not to ask), then the DHCP server
will either give it the last IP it remembers that host having or some
other semi-random IP based on whether or not it's already being used
and other factors that is most briefly summerized as roughly whenever
it feels like changing it.

They're fairly similar with backing up and restoring. I don't think one 
really has one over another on this one.

In some postgresql environments, I've worked with replication, where 
we'd backup the slave server, then start back up the replication slave 
and it'd catch back up with the master.

otherwise, not sure how 'easier' it can get than dump then restore.

cheers,

Both are fairly straightforward, provided your databases aren't
monstrous and you can spare a few seconds of downtime.  Here's a backup

fair enough. I think the MySQL vs PostgreSQL argument is flawed. They 
have two different goals. One is speed (and is now adding more 
functionality... but might that come at a price to the speed? we'll 
see...) the other being tons of features, and as a result slower speeds.

PostgreSQL vs Firebird...vs...other open source RDBMS would be a more 
appropiate discussion, as arguing about mysql vs postgresql is like 
arguing over outook versus outlook express. :-p

That's why I store all my data in vnc.

To those of you using LVM snapshots, do you really trust the snapshot?
I'm on the lvm-users mailing list, and it seems that snapshot functionality
is a very low priority.  Snapshot questions often go unanswered, and 
to my knowledge, the most recent 2.4 kernel release still doesn't have
all the necessary patches.  Additionally, redhat kernels can't even
mount a snapshot.

One more whine.  In LWM2, the snapshot code isn't finished.

Actually, I'd like to hear from people who've used either; both sound
really good and have good histories, but they don't get a lot of
attention--so little, that I know of no one who has actually used them.

And the "slower speed" thing may be a false meme as well.  Apparently,
MySQL rolls over at lower loads than PostgreSQL, even with comparable
tasks.

My personal take is that if you want a lightweight interface to files
that has to be super fast, and you can sacrifice a type system and
remote access, SQLite is the way to go.  Full transactions, SQL92,
extensible functions and aggregates, with a "serverless server" embedded
design.  And if you're using Perl, DBD::SQLite even contains the entire
SQLite database source, so a simple install gets you the full thing.

SQLite is *faster* than either MySQL or PostgreSQL.  Very fast.
Mighty fast.

But then if you want to trade a bit of that speed to have a full ACID
compliant database (and MySQL [even with innodb] doesn't cut that -
see http://sql-info.de/mysql/gotchas.html), then you jump over to
PostgreSQL.  Baby Oracle, it is.

I've not looked in to firebird, so I'm not ruling that out.  But
PostgreSQL is rapidly maturing with some really smart people working
on making it ever better.

You aren't supposed to touch the disks while the system is up.
Instead, perform a dump from the client interface, which does it
within a transaction so the data is consistent.

I would.  I care about my data.  See the reasons that even

Why would dd hang:  dd if=/dev/cdrom /tmp/image.iso.

cat /dev/cdrom >image.iso
and
md5sum /dev/cdrom also hung.

The cd is a made from yarrow-i386-disc1.iso using
cdrecord -v speed=12 dev=0,0,0 -data /tmp/yarrow-i386-disc1.iso

It checks as OK during the Fedora install.

Try e2label.

  glenfiddich 182# e2label /dev/hda2
  /var

Setting the label would be something like

  e2label /dev/hda2 someotherlabel

I recommend MoinMoin <http://twistedmatrix.com/wiki/moin/>.

It was dirt simple to install and customize.

As long as we're providing a laundry list: :-)

http://www.twiki.org/

It provides (optionally) for user login and has revision
control. Which can certainly provide a peace of mind. It's written in
perl for cgi, so it can run pretty much anywhere.

I run 10-12 phpwiki's.  It is under a pretty rapid development of late. 
I have very few issues with it.

I am intrigued by some of the other wiki's collab tools like Plone as
well.

No way, man.  The gold leaf is just fine, no flaking at all, and the

bling that both tha Google and my CCNA self know nothing of?

Well, before, when the USB interface used a 24.x.x.x address and the
ethernet interface used a 12.x.x.x address, USB was quite a bit faster.
But they're both in 24.x.x.x now and run around 2.3 Mbps.  Apparently,
routing for the old IP range was deeply screwed or something.

As it is, I like using USB so my ethernet interface is freed up to
provide a private network.

Since we're all reccomending something different, I'll chime in with my
two cents. I've used and administered TWiki-based sites in a couple of
different situations. TWiki isn't the simplest package to grok
initially, but after you get the hang of it seems reasonable. TWiki has
fairly fine-grained access controls. You can set up user and group
accounts, and restrict page viewing and editing to particular
users/groups, if desired (IIRC, authentication is handled via basic HTTP
authentication).

TWiki also parses its own dumbed-down text mark-up. Some folks think
this is a really handy feature. I'm not so sure I agree, but it doesn't
have to be used. Plain old HTML works fine, too.

A working demo is available at the package's web site:
<http://www.twiki.org>

Thanks for all the recommendations. I think I'll go with one of the
quick solutions (PHPWiki looks promising) because

a. I don't have a lot of setup time available and,
b. The site only needs to be up for a few months before it'll be
   tossed into the bit bucket.

I'm partial to Perl solutions, but TWiki has issues with Perl 5.8 and
Apache 2.0, which rules it out in our environment.

Anyway, I really appreciate all your suggestions. It made my hunt
much, much simpler.

Several of the Oracle backup tools do not go through Oracle to dump data, but 
directly hit the raw partitions while Oracle is running.  They do talk to 
Oracle sufficiently to do some locking.  I'm not familiar enough with Sybase/
DB2 etc. to comment on those.  The argument sounds suspiciously like "that's 
not a feature that databases should have, so you don't need it."  I'm not 
supposed to read the disks?  Why not?  I can in Oracle.  I can in MySQL.

We had several conversations directly with the LVM folks at Sistina (now part 
of Red Hat) and did our own tests because we were worried about LVM's 
stability.  For the 2.4 kernels, LVM has worked flawlessly for years for what 
we were doing.  For 2.6, I'd probably use EVMS on top of device mapper.  But, 
it will be a while before I move any servers to 2.6.   It needs time to 
mature, though it seems better than 2.4 was initially!

In terms of stability and other problems we found that we had the following 
ordered list of problems:

1) human error (admins doing stupid human tricks)
2) human error (coders doing stupid human tricks)
3) human error (users doing things that triggered point 2)
4) kernel bugs (subtle and rare disk corruption is a really ugly thing)
5) glibc bugs (thread bugs and various leaks)
6) network hardware problems (failed switches, NICs and the like)
7) disk hardware problems
8) SCSI controller hardware problems
9) Colo problems (the idiots had multiple 4 hour power outages and our UPSes 
eventually failed, the colo is gone now)
10) MySQL problems (the ELT and mutex problems)

99% of our problems were caused by human error.  The data corruption thing had 
us stumped for a long time.  We had to keep failing over to the slave 
machines because the master would eventually corrupt the database and we 
couldn't figure out why the master would corrupt but not the slave.  Finally 
we tracked it down to a kernel bug that would eventually write bad data to a 
disk under very high loads.  Once we updated the kernel, the problem went 
away.

Note that some of these have been addressed in 4.1.x.  Since SAP is working 
with MySQL to make sure that SAP works on top of MySQL (by changing MySQL, 
not SAP!), I am sure that anything like this that remains will be gone by the 
time that 5.0 is stable.  After all, SAP works against "real" databases and 
does require foreign key constraints etc. all working correctly.

Your argument is interesting because I said that I thought that by 5.0 stable, 
MySQL would be ready, but you are arguing that since MySQL isn't ready now, 
it isn't going to be ready?  That's an interesting way to convince me :-)  
Arguing about the future is always a mess.  Perhaps all the core MySQL 
developers will suddenly decide to become Hari Krishnas :-)

SAP wants to be able to ship with a DB for free that they don't have to 
maintain.  They've said this and done a deal with MySQL AB to provide said 
DB.  They even gave MySQL AB the source for SAP DB in the bargain.  I have 
worked in Fortune 100 companies and SAP is a big deal.  It puts huge stresses 
on any DB.  If MySQL is ready for SAP by 5.0 (this is what MySQL AB has said 
on the mailing list in the past), then it is going to need all the features 
and behavior that SAP needs and those are legion.  This is why I think that 
by version 5.0 stable MySQL will be able to compete with Postgres on every 
feature point and then some.  Do you disagree with this and if so, why?  I 
don't pretend to have deep inner knowlege of the workings of the Postgres 
community.

Side note:

How come SAP isn't going with Postgres?  I don't mean this as a rhetorical 
question, I'm genuinely curious.  Red Had ships it as their flagship DB.  SAP 
should be a relatively easy port.  It works on DB2, Oracle etc. and those 
have all kinds of ugly incompatibilities.  Why did SAP go with MySQL when it 
was so clearly so far from adequate?  It seems like it would have been a much 
faster path to throw a few developers at Postgres and get SAP working on 
Postgres in a few months rather than the multi-year path that SAP chose.  
Ever since the MySQL/SAP announcement, I've been wondering what made SAP do 
this.

Does anyone know?  It seems very counter intuitive.

Fast backups and snapshots, a DB that could stay up for months at a time (this 
started before Postgres 7.0 was debugged) etc.  One of the people we had on 
staff had used Postgres for several years whereas the rest of us were just 
learning MySQL, so it wasn't a knowledge problem.  We were leaning strongly 
toward Postgres and kept finding things that did not work for us.  If we were 
to do the evaluation now, it would be a much closer contest.  I'd previously 
used Oracle and was dragged kicking and screaming to use MySQL.  

Another poster mentioned using Python/etc. as scripting languages in the DB. I 
cannot possibly see how this is a selling point to me until that is part of a  
standard DB definition.  Those scripts will work fine with Firebird and SAP 
DB (now MaxSQL), right?  If not, they are just proprietary extensions that I 
cannot use.  I don't use AUTO_INCREMENT fields and TIMESTAMP fields in MySQL 
either for the same reason.  As handy as they are, I don't use ENUM fields.  
I try to keep any proprietary functionality out of my apps where at all 
possible.  I want to be able to switch databases.

Another mention was made of MySQL falling over on large DBs or high volumes.  
That doesn't wash with my personal experiences at all.  Perhaps the apps I've 
done just happened to be a good fit for MySQL? I won't argue that very large 
database would stress MySQL to the breaking point, but I would argue that 
Postgres isn't appropriate for the sizes I think are large.  See below.

I won't claim to have done every kind of application on a database.   I did 
multiple web ecommerce systems, VoIP data collection backends (lots of data 
flowing during a call), live customer call reports, real-time resource 
allocation for calls, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly roll-up 
reports (both scheduled and live), ad-hoc web-based query systems, and 
real-time system quality monitoring using MySQL.  I also worked on multiple 
replication and hot-failover systems, again all using MySQL.  The apps were 
written primarily in Perl with a few large chunks in Java.  The apps ranged 
from standalone multithreaded servers to multi-process XML-RPC servers to CGI 
scripts.  Clearly there are all kinds of apps that I haven't worked on with 
MySQL!

We've had multi GB databases (up to about 45GB) without any particular 
problems or slow downs.  We did do tuning of MySQL as we grew the databases 
and found various bottlenecks, but it wasn't much change from the default 
configuration.  We added a few indexes as we added new kinds of queries.  We 
had systems that pumped data into MySQL (i.e. heavily weighted toward 
INSERTs, not SELECTs) with upwards of 300 simultaneous connections on single 
processor Pentium III 500 machines without problems.    We did this for 
years.  The raw speed of INSERTs was never particularly an issue with either 
database.  I do not believe that I've argued anywhere above that MySQL was 
particularly faster than Postgres. There are too many other factors in a full 
system to say categorically that one database is faster than another.

I worked in a large pharmaceutical distribution company that had a pricing 
table that was 250M rows and over 4.5TB of data.  That project used Oracle 
and I would not use MySQL or Postgres for it.  This was a while ago, but the 
maxed out Sun E10Ks were struggling on some of the queries.  Is that large 
data?

I hope I've made it clear why a statement like "MySQL doesn't do well with 
large data or high loads" is not going to be very convincing to me without 
some empirical data to back it up.  I'm not trying to start a "mine is bigger 
than yours" argument here, but I would like to inject my actual experience.  
If anyone has experience that does not agree with mine, I'd honestly like to 
know.  Under what circumstances was the slowdown seen?  What kinds of queries 
were being done?  What was the data size?  Was was the query size?  Was the 
database local or remote?  What kind of OS was used?  What kind of disk 
subsystem was used?  SMP or not?  What was the hardware in the server?

I want to expand my knowlege of DB systems and their quirks.  My experience 
does not agree with the statements that have been made about MySQL and so I'm 
stating my experience.  While I find that web reports can be interesting, 
very few reports detail exact configurations, applications, query mixes etc.  
Both MySQL and Postgres have far too many "ra ra ra" partisans and those 
people just annoy those who are trying to make a realistic decision based on 
realistic data.  My kill file had a fair number of entries just for people on 
the main MySQL mailing list.  You'd think that MySQL was going to save 
mankind according to some of those people :-)

I _have_ seen many apps that do cartesian joins, don't have indexes on fields 
being used in WHERE clauses etc., that run like snot on a glacier in winter.  
But, I think that is simply bad coding.  I don't care what the DB is behind 
the curtain if the code is like that.  I see all too many projects with those 
kinds of flaws.  Do some speed tests with your application and your usage 
patterns.  We did.

This discussion is rapidly turning into a "vi vs. emacs or Perl vs. Python" 
type of thread :-)  There's religion and there's religion.  For what I was 
doing, MySQL made sense and Postgres didn't.  Postgres isn't the best 
solution in all cases.  Neither is MySQL.  The beauty of open source is that 
you can chose.

That said, I think that politics and expediency make more technologies gain 
large marketshare than any technical reason and I feel that my opinion is 
well supported by history.  That's why if MySQL and Postgres were public 
companies, I'd be buying MySQL stock.  I'd also buy Linux stock over *BSD 
stock.  It is not that I think that MySQL and Linux are necessarily better 
technologies.  It is that I think that they are the technologies I'm going to 
be dealing with in the future.  Politics and expediency.

I've been burned too many times rooting for things that are technically better 
and seeing them lose to think that anything will win on technical merits 
alone anymore.  VHS vs. BetaMax anyone?  OS/2 vs. DOS/Windows?  Mac vs. 
Windows? x86 vs. 68k?  IDE vs. SCSI?  There are lots of examples of this :-)

Being burned a lot has made me lose my religion pretty much completely.  I 
gave my Amiga away a long time ago :-)

My opinions shift with the changing projects.  If this discussion had happened 
two weeks ago, I would have plugged Postgres.  Since the MySQL 5.0 
announcement surprized me (I thought it wouldn't be out in alpha until early 
2005), I've changed my mind.

Neither project is standing still and both continue to gain marketshare.  I 
have not seen projected figures for Postgres usage.  MySQL AB's marketing 
department doesn't hesitate to use 4M (don't know if that is sites or seats 
or installs) as the number.  How they've measured that is anyone's guess.  I 
have no idea if it is correct or not.

Does PLUG have a plug-flame list?  If so, this should probably move over 
there :-)

Best,
Kyle

P.S. Randal pointed out SQLLite (two "L"s?).  It is a very nice little project 
and one I hope to add to my tool box in the near future.  I can think of a 
bunch of cases where I wished I had had something like it.

Of the Wikis I've seen (which isn't many), one feature of MoinMoin's
markup that has all the others beat is the ease with which you and copy
and paste source code--enclose it in {{{ }}} and it's nicely formatted. 
Other Wikis I've looked at require you to put a space at the beginning
or other odd things, which if you're publishing more than a few lines
becomes tedius really quickly.

I would like to see all the open source databases compared based on what they 
are good for rather than seeing so much "X DB doesn't do what I want, so it 
must be bad".  The latter represents about 99% of what I see on mailing lists 
and web sites, unfortunately :-(

SAP/DB was commercial, but it was a sort of free give-away with SAP when you 
bought that.  I don't know if they ever actually sold it separately.  I think 
it was another DB before SAP got a hold of it, but I can't remember which 
one.  Since I never had $30M to spare, I declined to learn much about it.  
Now that it is MaxSQL, it is being pushed by MySQL AB.

I have seen SAP installations that used SAP/DB, but I didn't directly do any 
of the development and I wasn't on any of the teams that used it.  It must 
have worked since I didn't hear more than the usual bitching at lunch :-) I 
do know that it was used for Fortune 100- and even Fortune 10-class SAP 
installations, but it wasn't particularly recommended for that.

Firebird was Interbase and there must be someone on the list who has used 
that.  Anyone?

My only concerns with Firebird are twofold:

1) the name.  arguments about whether the Mozilla project should choose 
another name or not can go to /dev/null.  But, the fact is that when I 
mention it to people, they've only heard of the browser.

2) the community.  They are doing solid work on it, but I fear that there 
isn't enough difference between it and MaxSQL/Postgres to keep people 
involved.  Postgres has a large, healthy community and MaxSQL has MySQL AB 
behind it, so it has co-opted the large MySQL community to an extent.

It is communities that keep open source projects alive and healthy.

Best,
Kyle

(Since you asked ;-)

Firebird (firebirdsql.org) is the open source fork of InterBase 6.0, the
only version of InterBase to be open source (released August, 2000).
Borland Software (borland.com) still actively supports and enhances
InterBase, which is currently at version 7.1.  The original developers (some
of whom were working with Borland at one time) are the ones supporting
Firebird now.  They sell support and CDs from ibphoenix.com.  

Firebird is so new, and InterBase was so poorly marketed that it's not known
by many.  However, it has a long history (22 years) and is a very solid
database.  It's versioning architecture take recovery after a hard disk
crash from minutes or hours down to seconds and make backups or reports of a
live database possible because of the "snapshot" capability.

There is a small, but strongly committed community of people maintaining and
enhancing it.  Version 1.03 is very solid and used in production by many.
Version 1.5, which enhances the SQL language significantly (which was
already SQL-92 compliant) and increases the flexibility of the security
system for multi-domain web sites, is about to be released.  Currently, a
64-bit, SMP-friendly version is under development.  There's significant
third-party support from Europe and Asia where Microsoft's marketing arm
doesn't have such a stranglehold and where Borland was much more successful
with Delphi and InterBase.

The server runs on Windows, Linux, several flavors of Unix, and even
Macintosh.  There's support for ODBC, JDBC, .NET, PHP, Perl, and more.  It
has relational integrity, stored procedures, events, UDFs, BLOBs, and a very
flexible trigger facility.


Well, that's enough praise about it, I suppose.  If you want to know more
about my experience with it, catch me off-line.

  I suspect that in addition to the opinions of both of you, part of what
makes open source software good is pride of ownership. The individuals who
identify a need and create a solution take pride in its adoption and use. It
is very satisfying to the ego to know that your efforts are being used and
appreciated by others. Therefore, because most of us care greatly about our
reputations we strive to improve what we do because it's associated with us
-- even when others step up to help.

  Two prominent examples are jpilot (Judd Montgomery) and Xfce (Olivier
Fourdan). This takes nothing away from language developers and others, but
only illustrates two individuals whose single-handed efforts have made a
tremendous improvement in my computing efficiency.

The "mount" output will tell you.

"showmount". Though it's not always 100% accurate, depending on
implementation. It seems better these days.

Sounds like your best bet would be phpwiki.  Simple to install, easy to use.
For mid size or large purely wiki based data, I would go with moinmoin.  For
large portal, feature rich, dynamic content etc., I use TikiWiki.

A local non-profit I'm a part of uses TikiWiki (http://www.gobiodiesel.org). And
a fairly well known technical organization uses a very customized, hacked
version of MoinMoin (http://www.personaltelco.net/).

I use TikiWiki for my personal site.  It uses MySql, which for me is nice as I
can create multiple instances of the environment for many different sites and
manage it all in MySql.

Russ,

  I'm not sure I clearly understand your question. However, /etc/exports
will tell you what filesystems have been exported from the server, and 'who'
will tell you who's logged on.

  However, if someone's logged on another machine, but using the exported
/home directories, 'who' will not tell you what users are logged on where.
I'm certain that there is such a utility.

Yes.  In fact, I don't think they've been updated much since InterBase
5-something.  New documentation is often found in newsgroups or PDF articles
posted on one of the web sites.

I think you're misreading the docs.
   http://developer.postgresql.org/docs/postgres/backup-file.html
says a normal snapshot of the entire data directory will work.
Restoring from that is the same as if the system had crashed at
that point, which should be fine since that's what databases are
designed to handle.  (ie, all committed transactions will be
done, no uncommitted transactions will be done.)

This seems to me the same thing that goes on if you use the
mysql/innodb hot backup tool, right?

The caveats in the postgres manual seem to be about discouraging
cheating.  You can't just back up selected files, you have to
back up the entire data directory for database integrity.  Well,
I'm guessing you could identify a minimal subset of data that
needs to be backed up (besides an sql-dump), but it looks to me
like postgres wants the freedom to change the storage format
across versions, and to do that you need to discourage people
from working under the hood too much.

"1. The database server must be shut down in order to get a usable backup. 
Half-way measures such as disallowing all connections will not work as there 
is always some buffering going on. For this reason it is also not advisable 
to trust file systems that claim to support "consistent snapshots". 
Information about stopping the server can be found in Section 16.6. Needless 
to say that you also need to shut down the server before restoring the data."

The first sentence of the point above on the page you point to seems to 
contradict what you say.  It seems very clear that Postgres does buffering 
and what is on disk isn't coherent until it is shut down.  Is there another 
way to read this point?  This is exactly the doc I was thinking of when I 
wrote the paragraph you quoted above.  The authors conveniently emphasize the 
word "must" in the first sentence of point 1 just to make it even more clear.

The second point notes that when you do copy the data dir, you need to get 
everything.  However, that has nothing I can see to do with the database 
being up at the time.  Point 1 that I've quoted above covers that quite 
clearly I think.

Best,
Kyle

"showmount -a" will show what other machines have mounted from your machine.
Hmm, still working on showing if you can tell who has what open though.

Subject: OSCON Call for Participation

O'Reilly Open Source Convention
Call for Participation
July 26-30, 2004 in Portland, OR
http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/

OSCON is the only event where open source leaders and
practitioners of every persuasion gather to integrate projects,
launch revolutionary new ideas, push the boundaries of their
respective technologies--and change the way we live and do
business.

You're invited to take a role in the next OSCON by becoming
a speaker. (You'd be in good company--Robert Lefkowitz,
George, Freeman, and Esther Dyson, Milton Ngan, and Tim
O'Reilly are all confirmed speakers.) "Opening the Future:
Discover, Develop, Deliver" is the theme for 2004, guiding
tracks devoted to Linux, PHP, Python, Perl, MySQL and
PostgreSQL, Apache, XML, Applications, Ruby, and Security.
For more information on how to submit a proposal for a tutorial
or session, sign up for a Lightning Talk, or suggest a panel,
visit: http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2004/create/e_sess

Want to see some of last year's presentions? Go to:
http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/23/presentations.html

There's also another way to help shape OSCON: Take a
minute (literally) and fill out a short survey to help us make
it an even better experience for you. And if that's not enough
motivation, answering those few brief questions also enters
you in a raffle to win a free pass to OSCON. Deadline to
complete the survey is February 9.
http://conferences.oreillynet.com/survey/oscon04_planning

OSCON is the place where open source practitioners of every
stripe come together to learn useful skills, discover what's
new, "cross-fertilize" projects, and get fired up about the
fact that their collaborative efforts are finally paying off. We
hope you'll join us in Portland for the latest discoveries and
developments along with the business, technical, political,
and legal minds behind them.

I think it's bad editing in the doc.

the caveats seem to apply to simplistic backup methods like the
example above it:

    tar -cf backup.tar /usr/local/pgsql/data

which runs into obvious problems because the tar isn't an atomic
read.

a later paragraph says:

   An alternative file-system backup approach is to make a
   "consistent snapshot" of the data directory, if the file
   system supports that functionality.  Such a snapshot will save
   the database files in a state where the database server was
   not properly shut down; therefore, when you start the database
   server on this backed up directory, it will think the server
   had crashed and replay the WAL log.  This is not a problem,
   just be aware of it.

this paragraph seems to me independent of the caveats before it,
and it implies that the data on the disk is coherent even if the
database isn't shut down.

about the caveats, I'm not really sure what this sentence is
talking about:

    Half-way measures such as disallowing all connections will
    not work as there is always some buffering going on.

the word "buffering" is not attached to anything in particular.
it's not clear to me where this buffering is and why it would
cause problems.  If the buffering were in disk commits, then the
database wouldn't be ACID (which I suppose might be true, but at
the moment it seems unlikely to me, since the rest of the world
says that postgres is ACID.)

it seems more likely to me that the writer is talking about
something like: incoming transactions might be buffered
somewhere, and there's no simple way to say "don't allow new
connections, and also make sure all existing connections are
either finished or totally quiet", other than shutting down the
database.  any non-atomic backup method like "tar" will run into
problems if a transaction happens while the backup is running.

this sentence is also kind of odd:

    For this reason it is also not advisable to trust file
    systems that claim to support "consistent snapshots".

the strange thing is the phrasing "claim to support".

I suspect the issue in the writer's mind was whether snapshotting
is atomic or not, because it's possible for a snapshot to be
"consistent" but not happen atomically.  After all, tar satisfies
a weak form of consistency.  It's not clear to me that all
filesystems with snapshots do it atomically.  Off the top of my
head, I'm pretty sure NetApps have atomic snapshotting, but I
don't know anything about anyone else, I'd have to go looking.

an important point is that all the filesystem data, including the
contents of all the files, has to be captured by the snapshot
atomically, which is easy to do if the filesystem and kernel use
the right data structures, hard to do if they don't.  (I think
it's hard to imagine how atomic snapshots can be done efficiently
if you don't already know the generalized copy-on-write technique.)

what I get from reading the postgres manual is that this section
was originally written before snapshotting filesystems were
available, and then it was revised a few times to account for the
new technology.  that sentence reads to me like, "do you really
trust this magical 'snapshot' technology?" and the later
paragraph reads like, "I guess snapshots can be ok".  (this is
just speculation, I'm not going to go digging into history.)

does this explanation make sense?  I don't do much with
databases, so I don't really know much about them.

Yeah.  Cable "modems" are network bridges (cable to ethernet), not
peripheral devices.  Throwing a USB port into the mix has been a
last-minute afterthought for the drooling idiot masses.

No, not really.  Sounds like an RCA and some Motorola modems, which
would work faster in USB mode if they booted connected via USB.

Why doesn't PLUG start a computer books lending library for our
"members"? This shouldn't be too difficult to implement. I don't even
think it's an original idea.

Those of us that enjoy writing could select an O'Reilly book to review
on occasion. The reviewer's reward for his/her effort would be the use
of the book for a month (or six weeks, or whatever). Other members
interested in the book could sign onto a web-based waiting list. If
there are any members waiting for a particular book, a reasonable time
limit could be placed on a book's loan period. Said web app would also
be used to keep track of who's got what at the moment. There shouldn't
even be a need for any one person to store the books.

Yeah, I know... Just build and they will come. But before I bother to
build anything, I'm curious if there's any interest (especially from
potential reviewers).

BTW, who's in charge of the PLUG web site these days?

Subject: [PLUG] Mailbox Size Monitoring
Message-ID: <1074227171.3459.112.camel@sparticus>

All, 

I wish to warn my users when their mbox is nearly full. I found the
script below to be almost what I am looking for.

The trouble is that 1) I deliver the mail to the mbox file under the
user's home directory, not /var/mail/spool and 2) I don't have a
/etc/postfix/virtual file.

Would anyone quickly adapt the script below to work with my environment?

$25.00 bounty to the first person who does this successfully under the
terms of the GPL...

Subject: [PLUG] Mailbox Size Monitoring
Message-ID: <1074228591.3465.129.camel@sparticus>

All, 

I wish to warn my users when their mbox is nearly full. I found the
script below to be almost what I am looking for.

The trouble is that 1) I deliver the mail to the mbox file under the
user's home directory, not /var/mail/spool and 2) I don't have a
/etc/postfix/virtual file.

Would anyone quickly adapt the script below to work with my environment?

# Nova Prestech.Net http://www.prestech.net

# the original lines rather than overwriting them.  It'll do you
# nothing but good... ;)

# Some configurable parameters and their meaning:

# $upperlimit   => mailbox size limit (read from postfix config file)

# $astepaway  => really close to a full mailbox

# $root     => administrative email account.  Will receive notifications
#              from the program about mailboxes going astray

# $warndayslim =>   limit of days between one warning and another.
#                   For users with mailboxes above 50% and below
$astepaway

# $alertdayslim => limit of days between one alert and another.
#                  For users with mailboxes getting close to the limit.
#                  Should be higher than 50%

I'll have you know that my girlfriend thinks it's cute when I drool.

So Bling Syndrome is another way of saying that USB breaks 'cos it's there?
Hrmpf.  Here I thought it was a specific known failure mode.

Nifty.  It's branded Teradyn (TJ 715x), which is also the name that
comes up when usbnet initializes, but it may use the same chipset.

$2 at Fry's, sometimes.  I don't like using more hardware than necessary.
As you might've noticed, adding hardware can reduce reliability. ;)

# Program to monitor Postfix mailbox sizes
# NOTE: The program MUST run under CRON, otherwise it won't
# be all that helpful

# Nova Prestech.Net http://www.prestech.net
# Developed and coded by Ricardo Malafaia (ricardo at prestech.net)
# Original idea and blames by Eduardo Mendes (mendes at prestech.net) :)
# V 0.0.6 / 17/jul/2003 (gotta get the habit of using CVS...)

# Project's Homepage: http://www.prestech.net/projetos/postmmon

# Look out for the following parameters when configuring postmmon
# for your system.  Don't be afraid to change them, they are meant
# to.  However, just for precaution, get the habit of comenting
# the original lines rather than overwriting them.  It'll do you
# nothing but good... ;)

# Some configurable parameters and their meaning:

# $upperlimit   => mailbox size limit (read from postfix config file)

# $astepaway  => really close to a full mailbox

# $root     => administrative email account.  Will receive notifications
#              from the program about mailboxes going astray

# $warndayslim =>   limit of days between one warning and another.
#                   For users with mailboxes above 50% and below
$astepaway

# $alertdayslim => limit of days between one alert and another.
#                  For users with mailboxes getting close to the limit.
#                  Should be higher than 50%

# In order to test, once more i advise that you comment out
# the lines rather than overwriting them.

# Comment out the following line as well, during tests.

#use warning;

Sending email to a user to warn that their mailbox is nearly full is a
bit like the bank charging my account an overdraft fee when I run out
of money to cover my checks.

RS has a valid point Coop...  But the script looks like it sends the 
first warning at 50% and the next and final warning at 85% so it, IMHO, 
does have merit. It's more like the Bank sending you a notice that your 
account is getting low BEFORE they hit you with fee's - like that's 
going to happen. It also looks to be an interesting re-work but it would 
take a lot of time for me considering I know very little about postfix. 
If you have no other takers Cooper I'll be happy to take the time but 
I'll need to work with you on the format of things like 
/etc/postscript/accountability and such.

Sort of. It helps prevent emails from getting lost because the user has
bumped up against the mailbox limit. While I have a backup delivery
system, it's inconvenient.

If the user knows that they're almost to the point where they could
start loosing emails, they will do something about it.

It's not like they have a shell account on the mail server, so how else
would they really know? Sure, they could scan their Inbox but can anyone
here say, "based on my scan of my Inbox, I suspect I have about 34 MB of
email" just by looking?

What kernel are you running? Are you still using Debian? I'm thinking it
is very cool you can connect to the USB port. Did you need to patch or
was it supported in the stock kernel, or distribution kernel? Does it
work via hotplug or does it require a manual setup. It would be very
helpful if you could post a mini howto if it requires some work.

Thank you
Russell

Oh, forget postfix. The script need only look at the size of ~mbox for
each user on the system, that's all. In shell it would something like:

ls /home
while read user
do
  mailbox_size = "ls -l $user/mbox | awk '{ print $3 }'"
  if $mailbox_size > upper_limit
  then
    mail -s $user "Your email is almost full!"
  fi
done

Something along those lines.

Thanks!

That's very far from how I read this.  I asked about it on the Postgres 
list... hmm, two years ago?  Maybe less.  The answer I got was that Postgres 
did not have a consistent disk image until it was down.  You could recover 
from what was on disk (otherwise recovering from crashes would be a bit 
difficult, no?) but you'd lose data doing the recovery potentially.  That 
potential makes this method an emergency backup method at best.

If you can lose data, Murphy will work overtime to ensure that you do lose 
data :-(

Exactly.  Difficult to have an atomic read of any size on Linux unless you can 
stop changes to the filesystem (i.e. snapshots).  LVM does it at the block 
device level.

I do not read this as you do.  This conflicts with point 1 in the page.  I 
don't see how you could both do a snapshot without problems and not do a 
snapshot without problems.  One is correct.  Someone went to the effort of 
making the two point list and emphasizing "must".  Seems clear to me.

Note that I have asked on the Postgres list in the past and been told that 
snapshots of any kind while the DB is running are bad juju.  That conforms to 
what is written in point one quite well.  If anything is poorly edited on the 
page, it appears to be the stuff lower down.

I've asked more than once in this little flame-fest whether this behavior had 
changed and I've heard resounding silence.  I take that as a "no".

I think you're trying to read entirely too much into this.  Most of this page 
seems quite clear.  I cannot see why the document writers would go out of 
their way to make things confusing.  Postgres docs are pretty good in 
general.  It, and the support on the mailing lists, are some of Postgres' 
real strengths.

Buffering can mean several things, but given all the other stuff on the page, 
it seems fairly clear to me that they are talking about buffering of internal 
DB state of some sort that is written to disk when the DB is brought down 
cleanly.

LVM certainly had teething pains some time ago.  Other systems such as some 
NAS systems didn't have perfect snapshots and thus filesystem mutations could 
slip in while they were occuring.   Makes sense to me.

Note that a lot of people would assume that because the filesystem supported 
"consistent snapshots" that they could take a snapshot of the running DB and 
have it be consistent.  If some state is only up to date in memory buffers, 
then this is an incorrect assumption and the warning makes a lot of sense.

I think you are trying to read entirely too much into this.  Would you risk 
your data on those assumptions and guesses?  I wouldn't.  If Postgres does 
provide for consistent snapshots in some manner and you still make back ups 
by taking down the DB and copying the data, you haven't risked anything.  If 
it doesn't and you think it does, you're screwed the first time you need that 
backup.  

Best,
Kyle

maybe this was before postgres implemented write-ahead logging?
it looks like WAL was added in 7.1, released 2001-04-13.

"before WAL, PostgreSQL was never able to guarantee consistency
in the case of a crash."
    http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/wal.html

with WAL (and fsync on), I think it should always be possible to
recover all committed transactions from a snapshot (or crash).
if not, it's a bug.

this paragraph in the documentation was added in the postgres 7.4
release, without editing the rest of that page to be consistent
with that statement.  the CVS revision date is November 2003.  I
don't know why this would be special to 7.4.  it seems to me this
should be true for any release with WAL, except for bugs.

the release notes for 7.4 lists one WAL-related bug
    Make B-tree indexes fully WAL-safe (Tom)

    In prior releases, under certain rare cases, a server crash
    could cause B-tree indexes to become corrupt. This release
    removes those last few rare cases.

anyway, this is as far as I'm going to dig into this.  anyone who
cares will have to do more research themselves, heh.

(I don't have any reason to choose a database right now, and
there's not much value in finding more information until I do,
since technology is changing rapidly, and I suspect any
impressions I form now will be obsolete in a year.  this was
partly an exercise in information gathering, and also to get more
familiar with database issues.)

TD Waterhouse meets both of those requirements.  I've been with them for several

I have used TD Waterhouse since the mid-90s and very happy with them
up until recently when they decide to double/triple/4th times all of their
fees.  I decided to transfer out and I was charged $50 for transferring
out my account.

I would suggest that you compare their fees before opening accounts.
I uses Citibank now and they are pretty good with Linux.
They don't have any branches locally, however.

About 2 years ago, I came across a pretty interesting brokerage firm
in Conneticut that offers Java API (and a few other languages) to
trade with their system.  I was just trying to find it again but cannot 
locate that company now
(I forgot the name as well)...I will
try to dig it up and if I can find it, I will post it here.

Yeah, but it's a bit tricky. Put your address list (each address
followed by a comma) in an editor configured *not* to do line
wrapping. Then get all the addresses on one (long) line. Cut and paste
that into pine. Works for me, using vi and xterm.

Paul,

  Thanks very much. The key is using vi rather than joe to display the
one-line file in such a way that I can highlight it all with the pointy
device. Probably could use emacs, too. Joe puts it all on one line but I
cannot scroll the display while blocking.

I run ntpdate once a night (I should set up xntp or something) to keep my

That's very odd.  Have you updated your kernel recently?  Are running
some unusual drivers?  Is your system ahead or behind the time given

Subject: [PLUG] rebuilding kernel with NGROUPS_MAX changed
Message-ID: <20040116190232.GA23506@patch.com>

	Background
There is a problem if one if using SAMBA/Winbind and a user attempting to login to a system with their authentication from a NT Domain.  If the user belongs to more than NGROUPS_MAX (defined in limits.h) their authentication will fail.

See http://lists.samba.org/archive/samba-technical/2003-March/027605.html for a reference. 

In Linux this number is 32.  We have many users that belong is 50 or more groups. (Don't ask, I didn't design the model.)

In a followup message to the one linked above it is stated that some utilities in userland are compiled with NGROUPS_MAX.  So if one wants to fix the problem, a change to the kernel source and a recompile can lead to problems down the road.  However, this was in the context of Solaris.

	Question
Is this a problem in Linux land?  Or can we indeed change NGROUPS_MAX, recompile the kernel and be good to go?  What "shoot self in foot" potentials are we looking at?

Hmm, I had a kernel upgrade after the change.  This is SuSE 9.0 and they 
upgraded the kernel when the sbrk problem was figured out.

The system is behind.  Previously it used to be ahead (-30ms each night).

I don't have any odd drivers, haven't installed any etc.  I'm running the 
stock SuSE 9 kernel without anything special.

It is confusing.  I've never seen a sudden change like this.

Sounds like the new kernel is dropping some timer ticks.  Try booting
the old kernel to see if the problem goes away.  If it does, I would
suggest reporting the problem to SuSE.

  That is an incredibly stupid statement for anyone to make, except for the
flapping lips at Microsoft. For an editor at Computer Bits it is also not a
sign of sufficient knowledge to hold that position.

  You can let him know that I've run my business on linux-hosted software
since 1997. If that's not end user enough for him he should get a job
staring at X-ray machine monitors at the airport.

You didn't quote all the relevent parts:

  If you do think I should learn some Linux, let me know which flavor,
  particularly if there is a Linux for Curmudgeons version out there
  someplace.

Knowing Frank -- I was his editor for quite a few years -- he's up for
basic install and config stuff, but don't expect him to know the
difference between tcp and icmp. The good suggestion for him

1. would have a web interface, preferably one that could identify with
   reasonable certainty his internal and external network interfaces

2. would have a set of canned solutions that are easily understood by
   someone who's a well informed user but not a systems or network
   admin

3. could be run from a CD or floppy so it wouldn't invade his
   hard drive until he was really ready

Kyle didn't cite enough of the article to give you a true flavor of

We once had a book library. The trouble was that the majority of computer
books go out of date so quickly that it sort of got abandoned. I think
Dave still has the remnants.

PDXLUG (the other local LUG) has a library that has been in use for the 
past year. This has been fairly useful..and we have

I like smoothwall quite a bit ( http://smoothwall.org). I've been using 
it for a while now and its really easy to set up as well as having more 
advanced features than floppyfw (for example). Its managed via a web 
interface after the initial install and has an IDS, squid, a ipsec vpn, 
dyndns and a bunch of other stuff.

It doesn't fit number  3,  as it runs off a hard drive, but an old P75 
more than handles all of my home traffic easily. I imagine he could get 
the hardware he needed for less than $40.

some more info...

Yah, this is pretty much how the system we're using works. We have 
monthly email reminders that go out for borrowers and those lending. We 
swap books at meetings or however lender and borrower agree upon a swap.

If you want to check it out, email me with:

Username
Full Name
City, State
Email

to robbyrussell at pdxlug.org and I'll get you added (haven't set up the 
new user approval system as adding a new user by hand is working just 
fine at the moment)

There's nothing less scary than floppyfw.

You edit a text file.  Add your network information, tell it whether you
want DHCP or not, and go.

No web services to exploit, no nothin'.

Gibraltar is designed to be a full-featured firewall run from CD, the
configuration can be saved to floppy, usb storage device, or harddrive,
the drawback is that the web interface part can't be accessed until you
buy a key code for 990 euro's (which seems kind of steep to me,
considering that you also have to provide the hardware).  There is a  30
day trial license for testing it out though.  The rest of the
distribution is all GPL (Debian based, of course), so the system can be
downloaded and used for no cost, but the setup will have to be done
without the web interface.

Good Luck,

Derek Loree

OK, so a while back (maybe two years ago?) we had a conversation here
about using vi to edit mail (like with mutt or something).  Some folks
posted their own clever ways of handling quoting and line wrapping.

I can't seem to find that thread.  Can someone post either a link to the
thread or some search tips that might help (like, where to search, for
one)?

Also, if you have some input on the subject directly, I'll take that, too.

Sorry for the bait quote, I assumed most were familiar with his writing 
style or would read the editorial to get the gist.  Never met the man, but 
he does seem a bit whiny at times.  Usually it's about Windows annoyances, 
so if we could reach out to him with a measured response, perhaps he will 
come to see the one true way.

Garl & Doug both recommend smoothwall, which does look very nice.  Think 
I'll play with it myself.

Of course I can google for this stuff myself, but appreciate suggestions 
from those that have used the apps.

Don't know if he lives in Oregon, but a Knoppix CD might be in order.

Last I knew, he lived near Phoenix, AZ. I'd guess, however, that you
could get it to him c/o the Computer Bits address in Forest Grove.

I run floppyfw and I am confused by the setup.  It is hard to tweak (it
must be done on another machine) and mistakes can foobar the whole
system.

> No web services to exploit, no nothin'.

I like for it for this reason, but I consider it trickier than a web
interface.

If it just came at you with DHCP Outside, NAT inside and that's it, then
it works great (I think that's it default).

But if that is the case, a < $100 router can do it as well (like most
wireless APs).  And I could argue that's not a firewall, that's a NAT
device.

BTW I have never, ever, seen a firewall under windows that is easy to
understand.

Hi Dan,

Maybe you should add CD copies of RedHat/LTSP to the list of resources 
available.

There are a number of ugly things about the program you found such that
it will be easier to start fresh rather than modify it.

So I did a quick hack to do so.  See:
    http://www.armoredpenguin.com/mboxfull/
for a copy of the program.  Let me know if it suits your needs.

Note that this is green code, and has been only tested enough to see
that it works on my system.  I expect that you will have feedback.

One such item is putting in all of the GPL comments.

If this works out for you, the bounty can be sent to GrokLaw.

In the Janurary issue of Computer Bits, editor-at-large, Frank Vaughan wants 
to create a pc firewall and says,

  "But I don't want to learn Linux. It is not ready for end user geeks like 
me, just for programmer/engineering geeks, and I'm not one of them." [1]

I think he's geek enough to handle Linux (and is perhaps trolling a bit.) 
Anyone know of a super easy firewall distro to recommend?  I'm thinking boot 
from CD with nice friendly web gui.  Less scary than floppyfw.

I use Smoothwall too and have for several years.  It is quite easy to set up, 
but there are parts that are not trivial for someone to figure out (RED? 
GREEN? What's that?).  The docs are pretty good.

The web interface in Smoothwall is trivial to use for everything I've needed 
to do.  That doesn't mean that it is comprehensive, just that for my limited 
needs, it was just fine.

However, Smoothwall has the most... interesting... mailing list.  One of the 
main authors seems to take great pleasure in flaming newbies on the list.  I 
haven't seen flame fests go from mild taunts to all out nuclear attack in 
such a short time.  Smoothwall is made by a commercial company who would 
really rather that you bought their for-pay version.

IPCop is a fork of Smoothwall and seems to have a much nicer set of mailing 
lists and supportive folks.  Several of the people I got using Smoothwall 
have since started using IPCop.

Best,
Kyle

I wasn't planning on saying anything, since my contact info is
is on the web site. Last I knew, it was correct; I've had several
people contact me from there, & no one has let me know that
information is wrong.

I know there's a few things that need fixing on there, & sometimes
I should get to it sooner -- I'm always willing to accept help.

I just thought of something that would be really handy for me...  A VGA

screen.  Taken a step further, it'd be sweet to have my laptop essentially
function as a KVM switch for my headless boxes.
Has anyone heard of such a device?

Run some CAT5 and set up TightVNC on all the boxes concerned.  :-)

This is probably the cheapest of their KVM-over-IP solutions. You're
still talking quite a bit of bucks here, though. Why not just use VNC
or somesuch solution?

Well, yeah, I could just SSH in after the OS is loaded.  But what I want
to be able to do instead is watch the hardware boot messages, install new
OS's, enter the BIOS, etc., without having to worry about having a spare
monitor/keyboard with me.  So this device would basically take everything
from the remote box and pipe it over USB to my laptop.  Then I would be
able to run some software that would open a window and let me manipulate
the remote system.

BTW-Another, perhaps closer (but still expensive) solution to what you
want: http://www.realweasel.com/intro.html

Then just get a real serial terminal server (no, not the definition
given by Windows), and voila.

Yeah, but for an extra $350 you could have gotten a server motherboard
with serial console redirection in the first place (and you'd have
gotten a superior motherboard).

Certainly. That's what I have (I can even dial into my mainboard on a
modem and force a hard boot). Just enumerating some other options. :-)
Choices are good?

(And if you read their "asses saved" section, not all "serial bios'es"
are created equal.)

You've got the "then" part, but you still haven't managed the "if" part.

And anyway, as long as you stiffle discussion on your list, you
haven't "been over" anything.

Hmmmmmmm. Let's see:

Joshua D. Drake: "All do respect, but SO? Why the hell do I care what PLUG
wants/thinks/feels? The don't OWN the name Portland Linux Users Group."

Devon Holcombe: "Just to really irritate the pluggers you could call
yourself a different tree of plug..."

Cliff Wells: '/me works furiously on "no grils allowed" sign.'


Sounds like just more of the same mental masturbation for which your group
is becoming famous.

Gah.

Is anybody here on their -devel list (assuming there is one)?

I wonder how amenable they would be to a name change.  The "cop" metaphor
is not only misplaced but really offensive to me.

(It is, of course, entirely appropriate for the "spamcop" people, but
they're totalitarian pricks, too.)

This whole topic of group names is becoming boring. Yes, they are
similar -- enough that should one group decide to embrace a
controversial cause (say, official affiliation with NAMBLA --
the folks who proudly assert ``sex by eight, or it's too late"),
the other would be thought of advocating the same cause. However,
by this point neither appears to be willing to change their name.
I guess we're going to have to figure out how to get along,
just as Linux & BSD folks tolerate each other.

Let's let the topic drop.

One thing to check is that the hardware clock is being written to after 
ntpdate runs or when the system shuts down.  It is possible that your 
hardware clock has been drifting slowly and is now 14 sec off, ntpdate 
sets the software clock, but the result never gets written back.

I'm having trouble understanding what the issue is, so help me out. Is
it the name PDXLUG that is the issue?  Is PDXLUG not different enough
from PLUG? Is it the domains, pdxlinux.org and pdxlug.org are to close?
What "name" is it that that the people posting want changed? 

Thank you

The actual names, if you expand the acronyms, are:
PDXLUG - Portland Linux Users Group
PLUG - Portland Linux/UNIX Group, although we were "officially" the
Portland Linux Users Group until some time in the late 1990's, when
(IIRC) I requested we change the name to make it clear that discussion
about other UNIX systems was welcome.  Since "LUG" generally is used to
indicate Linux User Groups, most people assumed that PLUG stood for
Portland Linux Users Group, so we've also by default had that as an
alias.

We were and are known as the Portland Linux Users[1] Group, we are
just _also_ known as the Portland Linux/Unix Group.  According to what
those at the meeting where this was discussed[2] have told me, the
Linux/Unix name was _added_.  It was agreed that both names would
continue to be acceptable.  Some considerable time later, usage on the
website and materials began emphasizing the "Linux/Unix" name, but
that emphasis does not represent "abandonment" of the "Linux Users"
name, which is still being used by you (Jesse) and many others.

[1] "User" and "Users" are both in use.

[2]  circa September 1998

So the issue is the usage of "Portland Linux User Group" 

If one where to do a grep on the web site, would Portland Linux User
Group be found anywhere but in the mailing lists? So if we stopped using
it, then by what right, do we have to the title of "Portland Linux
User Group" or by what right do we stop someone else from using it?

Actions have consequences, and it appears we chose to do something that
some now regret. I can only think of a small child that shows no
interest in a toy, until another child wishes to play with it. 

Is there a SCO lawyer we can call?

Thank you
Russell

Very true statement and an excelent analogy, well put.

For those of us that were here last January when the split happened we 
know that it wasn't a pretty sight. The folks that split off did so with 
a bitter taste in their mouths, and for good reason (I can't blame 
anyone for wanting to distance themselves from that level of hostility). 
I'll admit that it could have been done with a little more tact than 
this, but it didn't, so grow up and get over it.

It's my opinion that this thread should take it's rightful place next to 
politics in plug-talk, I know that I'm [1] certainly tired of watching 
y'all kick this nasty rotting corpse.

1 - And I'm not alone.

I have hwclock --utc --systohc in the crontab with ntpdate.

However, it isn't as nice a script as Russell's!

Ooh.  Nice script.  I just chained ntpdate and hwclock in cron.  Nothing 
fancy.  So far, I'm not seeing failures reported (failures in cron should be 
reported to root via email).  When my network is down, I do see reported 
failures, so I know that the email reporting works...

I'll put in this script and see what it does.  I may need to simply hit 
another NTP server.

Best,
Kyle

More or less. Perhaps it would be better summed up as an issue of
intentionally causing confusion and "pissing in the pool".

Forking the group is one thing. There are no shortage of LUGs in
the Portland area, BizNix & BLUE for example, there is no harm in
having yet another. PLUG itself has off-shoots with their own
meetings/lists, Advanced Topics and PLUG for Education for example.

Adding "Portland Linux/UNIX Group" was intended to make PLUG
more inclusive, rather than exclusive, after all. The more the
merrier.

But forking the group in such a way that was intended to cause as
much harm as possible to the original group (using the same name,
having meetings on the same day/time, posting a steady stream of
insults) has rubbed a few people the wrong way.

I, for one, am a bit confused why some of the PDXLUG organizers
feel the need to be so bitter and work so hard at generating bad
blood.

>If one where to do a grep on the web site, would Portland Linux User
>Group be found anywhere but in the mailing lists? 

A Google search for Portland Linux User Group is enlightening.

There is much more to PLUG than the web site. You will note, for
example, that the PLUG Linux Clinic has always used "Portland Linux
User's Group (PLUG)".  The PLUG clinics have been in continuous
operation since 1995.

So going back and looking at the original script, I don't need the COUNT

I wondered what that was for.  It did look like you'd update from all the

Perhaps a dumb question, but why doesn't everyone run ntpd instead?  It
keeps your clock accruate all the time, not just when a cron job runs, and
uses something like only 1 udp packet per minute to do so.  A google for
"public ntp servers" turns up hundreds of stratum 2 devices you can get
time from.
Is the a compelling reason not to use ntpd?
Thanks

Better yet, use chrony.  It also figures out the skew so it can keep
the clock more accurate when it can't talk to the time servers.

Try using your ISP's DNS servers for NTP.  Many ISPs serve NTP on
their DNS servers these days.  Go for that, the time's not going to be
that far out.

I'm relatively certain ntpd does exactly the same thing, except they
call it 'drift' rather than 'skew'...

Both scripts will exit on the first successful netdate and hwclock. It
wouldn't cycle through all the servers, unless all the servers or all
but the last server fails. It just that I didn't need to count the
servers in the list.

I think I wrote the script when xntp had a security problem, I just
never got rid of it. The issue then was most ntpd servers shut down for
a while while they waited a fix for the issue. I had a long list of
servers and only needed one to work, but didn't want to have to
keep track of what was up or down. I also think I had issues a boot if I
couldn't find a server. I can't remember the exact issue, could have
been error between keyboard and chair. 

Chrony sounds like clockspeed so maybe it is trying to solve the same
issue clockspeed is. 

http://cr.yp.to/proto/utctai.html
What's the problem?
For many years, the UNIX localtime() time-display routine didn't support
leap seconds. In effect it treated TAI as UTC. Its displays slipped 1
second away from the correct local time as each leap second passed.
Nobody cared; clocks weren't set that accurately anyway.

Unfortunately, xntpd, a program that synchronizes clocks using the
Network Time Protocol, pandered to those broken localtime() libraries,
at the expense of reliability. Watch how the xntpd time scale increases
as a leap second occurs:

1997-06-30 23:59:59.7 UTC -> 867715199.7 xntpd
1997-06-30 23:59:59.8 UTC -> 867715199.8 xntpd
1997-06-30 23:59:59.9 UTC -> 867715199.9 xntpd
1997-06-30 23:59:60.0 UTC -> 867715200.0 xntpd
1997-06-30 23:59:60.1 UTC -> 867715200.1 xntpd
1997-06-30 23:59:60.2 UTC -> 867715200.2 xntpd
1997-06-30 23:59:60.3 UTC -> 867715200.3 xntpd
1997-06-30 23:59:60.4 UTC -> 867715200.4 xntpd
1997-06-30 23:59:60.5 UTC -> 867715200.5 xntpd
1997-06-30 23:59:60.6 UTC -> 867715200.6 xntpd
1997-06-30 23:59:60.7 UTC -> 867715200.7 xntpd
1997-06-30 23:59:60.8 UTC -> 867715200.8 xntpd
1997-06-30 23:59:60.9 UTC -> 867715200.9 xntpd
1997-07-01 00:00:00.0 UTC -> 867715200.0 xntpd
1997-07-01 00:00:00.1 UTC -> 867715200.1 xntpd
1997-07-01 00:00:00.2 UTC -> 867715200.2 xntpd

The xntpd time scale repeats itself! It cannot be reliably converted to
UTC.

By resetting the clock at each leap second, xntpd extracts a correct UTC
display (except, of course, during leap seconds) from the broken
localtime() libraries. Meanwhile, it produces incorrect results for
applications that add and subtract real times.

Given the rather hefty price tag on KVM-to-ethernet switches, I just had
the crazy idea of creating my own KVM-to-ethernet Linux-based device.  The
box would basically run a VNC server and have ports for connecting KVM
cables to a computer.  But...  I don't have the faintest clue how I would
take video/keyboard/mouse and flip-flop everything so it would work with
the VNC server.  Any suggestions on how this might be done?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.52.0401181826131.17290@shaft.bitmine.net>

Can someone point me to a primer that might tell me how to move an
application from MySQL to Postgres?

I am no DBA, but I don't think my application uses anything too fancy.

Looking at some sample applications that work with both RDBMSs, I see
there are quite a few differences in the schema dumps.  The same tables
with the same fields in both, but differences in the way the things are
created... sequences versus autoincrement and so on.

Anyway, I'm hoping to convert a fairly major application for the benefit
of all, so any help y'all could give me would help everyone.

Probably understates Free Geek's accomplishments and worth ;-)

Losing StRUT (the education twin of FreeGeek) has had a significant
negative impact on the state.

Earlier today I was mulling over that I have not done anything significant
for Free Geek since I gave a presentation with Oto and Greg (former 
director of StRUT) on reusing discarded hardware in schools.  I need to
redirect the weight I had put behind StRUT into Free Geek.

I'm impressed that the Meyer Memorial Trust understood this. Despite a 
good fight, we could not get this concept across to the state to keep
StRUT's doors open.

The Linux K-12 effort spends its time working on K12 technology issues. We're
the technology guys, not the PR guys. But we also tend to be permitted to
give interviews should one of us get a call about the responsible use of
tax payer funds, inter-agency cooperation, unique partnerships, leveraging
economies of scale, clever ways of expanding the quality/quantity of service
in the face of declining resources, etc, etc. (Hint. Hint.)

Meyer Memorial has a person on the inside who really gets Open Source
and has advocated for it's use in non-profits.  She was also helped by
some local consultants who provided a white paper explaining the
benefits.

There are conversion tools referenced on the postgresql.org website.

That could help and thank you.  I'm also looking for personal experience
"gotchas" and things I might want to fix in the conversion.

I'll read the online stuff, certainly.

Running it or properly using it?

Fedora with the new 2.6 kernel uses SELinux, but does not have all the
needed profiles quite yet.  (It will be a feature of Fedora 2.)

Actually it's a really poor analogy for several reasons:

1) We have never entirely "put down" the name.

2) The fact that we have a claim to the name is not the primary issue. The
primary issue is the confusion PDXLUG created when they chose names that
were so similar to ours.

3) If you're going to talk about children, then you're talking to the
wrong group. We have repeatedly tried adult discourse with PDXLUG only to
get adolescent responses like "you suck" and "don't get your panties in a
bunch".

They want to distance them selves from hostility???? I sure don't get that
from either their actions or their mailing list. I'll make you a bet - go
over to PDLUG's list and insult PLUG repeatedly. Then, under a different
name, make postings sympathetic to PLUG. $10 says the former behavior
causes no problems and the later gets you kicked off the list.

PLUG has another organization that is actively interfering in our group's
operation - that makes it a valid topic for the list. I am not alone in
that opinion.

I'm very curious as to why you felt like you needed to post with a fake
name. If you were here last January then you must know we don't gag our
members or kick people out of the organization. So, what's the deal with
tha?

Geoff,

Your analogy doesn't work. This isn't some emacs-versus-vi sort of
religious dispute. PDXLUG's choice of names has impacted our dealings with
outside organizations like Linux Journal and O'Reilly. It has also caused
confusion in the local community. Our concerns are not trivial.

We can let it drop for now, but it will keep coming back until they wake
up and "do the right thing".

After a night's research, I think I've come to believe that the
application SHOULDN'T just be moved to PostgreSQL.  Most of the things
done on the front-end of the application are more appropriately handled as
database functions.

Basically, moving to a higher-functioning database would give you none of
the benefits of having a higher-functioning database system and all the
negative impact of a bloated, front-heavy application.

With a bit of research, I'm pretty well sold on these ideas of views,
triggers, aggregates, and co. and will move to a more robust system.

As I see it, you can make the database itself so robust that the front-end
doesn't do much work at all except put a pretty face on the database.
Putting the logic in the front-end doesn't make sense because it limits
the number of ways you can access your data.

Forgive me if this is extremely obvious to everyone else, but it's
something that just didn't seem to come up in all the MySQL v. PostgreSQL
discussion.  (Right now, the ONLY thing I prefer about MySQL is the
license.)

So I'm a little bit stuck.  I like ARIAS because it seems to have
everything I want in terms of an external feature set (inventory, ledger,
payroll, etc.) but it's all in PHP when much of what is done could be in
the database itself (and, therefore, easier to update with another
front-end, should I choose that route).

SQL-Ledger seems to put the database in the appropriate relationship to
the application, but doesn't support payroll and doesn't have some of the
nicer interface features of ARIAS.  I'm sure you're all (well, those few
who are actually reading my ramblings) thinking that I should just add the
interface bits myself, but, to be perfectly honest, web interface
development is one of my least favorite things to do.

I don't mean to just blog at you guys... but if anybody really likes their
accounting/inventory system, I'd like to know about it.

PLUG has always been more of an Open Source group than a Linux group
with members using various BSDs and proprietary Unix OSs as well as
Linux. In September 1998, PLUG changed it's name to reflect this
reality. Thus, PLUG's official name was changed from the Portland Linux
Users Group to the Portland Linux/Unix Group.


It's hard to argue that we didn't drop the name when it says we did on
our web page. Even if some of us didn't drop the name, the organization
did. 

Thank you
Russell

I've watched this list change many times as different posters came and
went or maybe aged. You could look at PDXLUG use of Portland Linux User
Group as something purposely done to create confusion, or you look at it
in a positive light and assume they were paying homage to those that
made PLUG what it is today. 

When people split from a organization because they don't agree with the
new direction, they usually want to go back to a what is perceived has a
golden time. The time when PLUG was the Portland Linux User Group was a
golden time and I can't fault anyone for wishing it back.

Given statements made by those instrumental in the forming of the group
that uses the letters PDXLUG, I do not think it credible that this was
done as an homage, except perhaps if the claim was that PLUG had
corrupted their work.  In fact it looked to me like an effort to
establish themselves as the "One True Linux Users Group in Portland". 
Which they may well be, since PLUG does not exclude fellow travellers. 

None the less adopting PDXLUG as the Nickname of the group has caused
confusion and I believe that was intentional.

(wakes up...gets coffee)

What would the 'right thing' be in this sort of situation? This thread 
was based on I, (a member of two groups in town) posting a link to a 
resource that you are all free to use, regardless if you are members of 
PDXLUG and/or PLUG..and in no way made any attempt to debate the use of 
names.

Once again, we have a resource that you're all free to utilize...and if 
someone from PLUG wants the source code modifications, I would be happy 
to provide it as the system could be useful for your group as well as 
other groups.

it's always about politics,

Perhaps PLUG should "do the right thing" and change their name so as not 
to cause confusion with the Provo Linux User Group (http://www.plug.org) 
or any other number of P* Linux Users Groups that exist around the world 
(there are a *lot*).

Just out of curiosity, what would you suggest a Portland Linux user's 
group call itself?  If originality is the key, then I doubt there's a 
LUG in the world that deserves its name.  www.pdxlug.org makes it very 
clear that there is another LUG in Portland.   Unfortunately what it 
doesn't make clear is that PLUG apparently has more than its fair share 
of immature and unreasonable children who make loud noises when they 
don't get their way.  Please feel free to shout "we were here first!" 
and throw rocks as long as you like, but as an adult, I can assure that 
the world doesn't work that way.


Best regards,
Cliff

If you're going to move to a DB like PostgreSQL, than it is definitely 
worthwhile to do the homework and learn how to utilize the many features 
of the system. Put the business logic, rules, etc in the database rather 
than in your application. When you have a solid database design, it 
makes the application building process so much easier and lowers the 
risk of errors in your app affecting your data. If it's managed in the 
DB (as it typically should be in a business environment) it would be 
un-wise to do it elsewhere.

exactly. It's much easier to rebuild a front end when most of the logic 
is in the DB.

Except it doesn't say we *dropped* the name. In fact, PLUG's officers
(official cat herders?) never abandoned the old name.  I have used it in
almost every Clinic announcement - which are official PLUG documents - and
Dave Mandel has a DBA on it with the State of Oregon. Further we have a
ten year history of use which gives us a *legal* right to that name.

There seems to be a misunderstanding here that the changing of an
organization or company's name automatically puts the old name to be the
public domain. This is not the case. IBM bought Sequent and and re-branded
all their products - which does not mean you're free to start a computer
company called Sequent.

BTW, I want to thank you for your postings here. PDXLUG has banned several
of us from posting to their list and, in my case, from even mailing them
privately. Answering your questions gives us an opportunity to make our
case public.

So, PLUG is a business? Oh, my mistake. I thought it was a group of 
people who all shared an interest in Linux rather than someones personal 
business.  Are you all employees of PLUG?

No, that's not what it says.  The point is that typical backup tools
copy one file at a time and so do not generate a consistent snapshot
if the fileset is changing during the backup run.  This isn't so
critical for normal backup purposes, but it's absolutely fatal if you
want a consistent database ...

If you have a filesystem that can freeze an instantaneous snapshot of
the volume the PG database is on, it works to copy from the snapshot.
Some people do their backups that way, and it seems to work in practice
as well as in theory.  But without snapshot capability at the filesystem
level, you gotta shut down the database while you copy the files.

If you have your database spread across multiple logical volumes it
gets trickier --- you need to be able to obtain *simultaneous* frozen
snapshots of all the volumes.  I am not sure that the tools available
for LVM, for example, can really handle this.

Is this measured fact, or just your guess?  Commonly the pg_dump output
is much smaller than the disk footprint, since it doesn't have to include
index contents, unused space, WAL log, etc.  As a quick example, the
regression database occupies about 32MB on disk on my machine, and the
total size of $PGDATA including WAL log, template0 and template1 is
nearly 100MB.  But pg_dump output is only 4.3MB.

The first question here is what makes you think that PDXLUG uses that as 
a name?  Can you give *any* evidence?   Their website says "this 
Portland Linux User's Group" which is what they are.  That is a generic 
term that probably cannot be trademarked (but  IANAL, etc).  If a 
company makes a product called "the box of cereal" it doesn't mean that 
the Cheerios box can't claim that it's a box of cereal because it is.  
Does that seem clear?  You want legal right to something that doesn't 
exist.  What about the Portland Linux User's Group in Maine?   Why don't 
you fight it out with them for a while.  Better yet, try getting at 
least the semblance of a life and stop worrying about such silliness.   
Perhaps if PLUG didn't concentrate on this kind of thing so much then 
there wouldn't be a PDXLUG.

Right, except that Sequent wasn't called "a Portland Computer Company" 
nor were there several other companies with the same name.

By making your case public, you're more likely to cause some confusion 
over whether you've spent a great deal of time with your head up your 
ass.  If I were you I'd be far more concerned about that confusion than 
any arising over which Linux user's group is which.

The XFS filesystem supports taking snapshots on live filesystems.  IIRC, 
it uses the journal to cache data so even while the snapshot is being 
taken the filesystem isn't locked (up to some limit obviously).

Go to any city that has more than one LUG and you will see that each one
has come up with a unique name. As I remember, at one time, Seattle had
both a SEASLUG and a SLUG. A little differentiation is all we're asking
for. We have made suggestions in the past only to have them dismissed out
of hand.

We've had the name for ten years. Under the law, that makes it *our* name.
What exactly is immature or unreasonable about that?

Hiring? :-p

The problem is based around a very trivial problem of what is right and 
what is wrong. At the time when PDXLUG grouped, the named Portland Linux 
User Group was not being officially used by any other group in town. The 
only instance I could find besides people referring to PLUG as Portland 
Linux UserS Group rather than Portland Linux/Unix Group. Your own 
members are now confused and think they have joined the wrong group or 
that our group is not the group that they thought they were joining.

David and I have discussed this on several occasions off-list (as he is 
the proud owner of 'Portland Linux UserS Group' in the business world of 
Oregon), he seemed content with the agreement that we (PDXLUG) would do 
what we could try to refer to ourselves as PDXLUG (as 'a Portland Linux 
User Group' should anyone ask what it stood for).

If he, the owner has no issue and has made this statement in PUBLIC [1] 
in regards to the usage of the name, than YOU have no right to make 
LEGAL accusations on the behalf of others.

Question is, do YOU have the right to use that name in your emails?

We've been doing our best to use PDXLUG when we refer to ourselves and 
in NO WAY claim to be the sole LUG in town.

Own the legal right to the name PDXLUG, or the legal right to make the 
claim that we are a Portland Linux users group? In reality the biggest 
distinction that I see between the 2 groups that PLUG tolerates a lot 
more useless noise (like this thread) while PDXLUG tends to be a lot 
quieter and a little more focused.

Which then suggests a good name for them

or IntPlug for short.

Quite possiblly, but I get the impression that they're perfectly happy 
with the name PDXLUG and the description of a Portland Linux users 
group. I also get the impression that this isn't going to change 
regardless of the amount of useless chatter and sabre-rattling from this 
group.

This is good advice Cliff, take it.  

Your argument is silly, the PDXLUG folks split because they wanted
everybody to follow there vision of what the group should be
doing/talking about.  People here could not be bothered so they left. 
After the left the SNR of this group improved significantly (for a
while).

I guess there might be a problem here for a lot of people, don't you 
think?   I know there is at least one other company who's subtext is "An 
Oregon Company", not to mention the hundreds of other businesses that 
might mention the fact that they are "an Oregon business".  
Anyway, this is rather irrelevant as you seem to miss the point that 
PDXLUG does NOT claim to be *The* Portland Linux User's Group.   In 
fact, I know for a fact that Robby went out of his way to make sure that 
this was the case.   That seems to be a point of distinction here:  
despite the fact that your claims are mostly baseless, PDXLUG has tried 
to find a reasonable compromise (including a prominent link to PLUG at 
the top of their site).  PLUG (or at least certain noisy members of said 
group) seem to have done nothing except demand more.

The major point is that PDXLUG and PLUG DO NOT HAVE THE SAME NAME. 
PDXLUG is called PDXLUG, so unless you happen to be claiming that name 
as well, I don't see what your complaint is.

Please have the stupid name already.  PDXLUG is called PDXLUG.  What is 
it?  A Portland Linux user's group.  What is your major confusion?  Do 
you somehow not understand the difference between what something is 
called and what it's description is?

BTW, this discussion has already been had and you've added nothing of 
interest to it:

Sabre rattling?   That is juts silly, nobody here has suggested any
action.  People have simply pointed out, what they consider the
inapropriateness of certain actions.

No, they split because, as their website explains, they wanted a less 
formal, less topic-oriented users group.  One where people with a common 
interest (Linux) could meet and discuss whatever they want without 
getting told they were OT.  Perhaps at least some of this was due to 
personality conflicts or whatever.  Frankly, it doesn't matter.  They 
chose to form their own group and have every right to do so.  Still, to 
expect that people in PLUG can publicly slander their group without a 
response is "silly".

Bringing legal arguments into it is easily taken as "sabre-rattling" 
since it suggests possible legal action (otherwise why would those 
arguments matter?).   Feigning ignorance or innocence about the intent 
of those statements doesn't really disguise their meaning.

as that would be the case if the situation were on the other list, which 
it isn't out of respect of those on the list. However, you (Mr Haskell) 
opened up the discussion so you feel some sort of ownership to the argument.

So, to sum up all the lessons learned here.

1. PLUG never changes...

2. 'Portland Linux User Group' is a DBA (I was unaware of this...)

3. Owner of said DBA has been stated in public that he doesn't find 
anything wrong with our naming conventions.

4. People here and elsewhere like to get involved in conversations that 
they know little or nothing about and only add fuel to an old fire.

5. PDXLUG is NOT PLUG.

I saw it happen, and that is not what it looked like to me.  I can claim
to be the King of Asia, but that don't make it so.  Saying they wanted
to be able to talk with out being told they were off topic...well it's
true, anybody can say anything here, they can even say you are OT, which
BTW we are, way OT.

I feel that buy chosing a name PDXLUG that was easily confused with the
group they were splitting from PLUG is curious to say the least.  As I
said at the time, it reminded me of the Monty Python's Life of Brian ...
"splitters!"

<SIGH> oh well, it really is quite amussing.

Sorry, you must have not read the entire thread or have a surprisingly 
short attention span.   Perhaps during a commercial you can go back and 
review the previously presented materials.  My only complaint is about 
certain individuals who continue to complain and slander PDXLUG over 
something that is of questionable value.

The simple answer is that Dave Mandel gave me permission. He got
frustrated with your intrasigence and passed off to me (amoung others).

In answer to your other point - you appear to have read too much into his
posting on your list. He said that he would be OK with your group going by
PDXLUG as your primary name. He didn't say he was OK with you sneaking in
Portland Linux Users Group as a subtitle.

I appreciate that and consider it a good start. Now if you could just come
up with a better expanded name, we'd be home free.

Whatever happened at the time is irrelevant.  Their website says nothing 
negative about PLUG.  Were it not for these endless discussions, an 
outsider would never suspect that there is any sort of friction between 
the groups.  In fact, the prominent placement of the link for PLUG would 
seem to indicate otherwise.  I fail to understand why this hasn't been 
forgiven/forgotten long ago.  If people here find this sort of going-on 
to be of such great offense, then they must have led extremely sheltered 
lives.

Up to a point, yes.  After a while it just gets annoying.   This 
"conversation" has been going on forever.  I've tried to avoid getting 
involved but at this point my attitude towards these people has changed 
quite a bit.

True enough:
http://sos-venus.sos.state.or.us:8080/beri_prod/pkg_web_name_srch_inq.do_name_srch?p_regist_nbr=160120-98

It's not clear that DBA registration has any applicability here, as Dave
is not doing business as "PORTLAND LINUX USERS GROUP" and neither is
PDXLUG.  For sake of argument, though, let's say it matters.

Dave registered this name in July 2003.  That stands in contrast to his
registration of "PORTLAND LINUX/UNIX GROUP" in November 1999.  The
ownership of "PORTLAND LINUX USERS GROUP" was not a subject of state
concern prior to 7/03... when PDXLUG was formed.

The value of trade names is directly related to their specificity and
uniqueness.  Registering a name *after* its usage has become confused
confers little of value on the registration holder.  Furthermore, the
fact that PLUG has taken no action to enforce its "right" seriously
undermines any case PLUG may think it has.  It's way too late now.

Be aware as well that there are significant hazards to playing the game
of legal entitlement with names.  After all, the name "PLUG" is a
registered DBA in Oregon and I sort of doubt you've reached an equitable
licensing arrangement with the registrant.  :-)

FWIW,

Dylan

I have seen nothing I would consider slander, a difference of opinion
maybe.  the people who started PDXLUG clearly wanted to take over PLUG,
when they could not they started there own group and tried to usurp the
position of PLUG.  That is what I saw, I am not an espesially active
member of PLUG and I have no vested interest in PLUG, I just think it is
very sad that the PDXLUG folks had to disrupt the Linux community over
such trivial matters, it really does the community a great disservice. 
But that is water over the dam.

How did they/we disrupt the Linux community? The point of PDXLUG was to 
create (yet another) alternative in town as this list clearly does not 
work for all types of people. (there are 140 subscribed members to 
PDXLUG)...and there are many times that subscribed to PLUG.

The Linux community (the majority) I would assume could care less of 
this petty argument, as I for the most part. Besides, it's free 
advertising for our group. Thanks, we didn't have an outreach program 
yet. :-p

infact, Linux usage on the desktop and server has INCREASED since the 
birth of PDXLUG, not that that is related...but it could be.

cheers,

So one is an organic, open community (an appropriate reflection of the
open source community as a whole) and the other is a totalitarian regime.

I guess they can make the trains run on time and that makes the executions
worthwhile.

I get it now.

If this is true, why do the few keyholders kick people off the group's
mailing list when "offending" members don't stick to the approved topics?

The sad fact is that this exact conversation has done much more damage 
to PLUG than PDXLUG ever will.  Many skilled Linux users will be 
disinclined to help with some of the *useful* things PLUG does simply 
because they find the people who are involved to be abrasive and petty.  
You can count me in that group and I know of at least a few others who 
think that PLUG is a joke, not because of what they do, but because of 
*this* frivolous argument.   Most people simply don't care that there 
are two Linux user groups.  It seems likely that many people would be 
inclined to be involved with both, or would pick the one that best 
suited their goals and personalities.   Most people in the open source 
community consider choice to be a *good* thing.

You don't appreciate it or you would have let it go by now.  This is 
what I was referring to when I said that PDXLUG (and Robby in 
particular) has gone out of his way (and under no obligation, btw, other 
than pure politeness and wanting to avoid this retarded argument) to 
make reasonable changes to placate people.  Still, that isn't enough, 
you want more.   I have a better suggestion: since PLUG's mailing 
address is in *Corvallis*, why doesn't PLUG become become CLUG and solve 
the problem for themselves?

Regards,
Cliff

Please provide evidence of when this happened? I am not a keyholder, but

You are a lot more to the point than I.  The one thing that is clear to
me from my 15 (?) years of exposure to Usenet/Internet mailinglists is
that any artificial attempt to manage the SNR will be either 1)
ineffective or 2) destroy the creativity of the community.  The free
flow of ideas is either free or neat, never both.  Me I'll take free.

Dan wrote earlier today that he was banned from the list.

I heard a few other people tell me the same, but I don't know that I'm at
liberty to "out" them without permission.

Let's just take Dan's example.

But it's funny, because PLUG is rarely, if ever, discussed on PDXLUG 
(unless this argument happens to somehow spill over from this group).  
If the intent was to "take over" or "usurp" PLUG's apparently desirable 
position (/me muffles laughter) you would think that the discussions 
there would focus on that.

What the hell are you talking about?  There are no "approved" topics.  
AFAIK, the only people who have ever been kicked are people from PLUG 
who invade and won't shutup about the name "issue".

Well I can't speak for anybody else, but I read this as a simple
recitation of the standards of behaviour and practice in the world of
trademarks.  No where do I see an mention of hiring lawyers or taking
legal action, despite very questionable behaviour by the PDXLUG folks.

I don't think so.  Registration is "nice" but not necessary for common
law trademark cases.  PDXLUG's use of "Portland Linux User Group" has
been challenged from just about day one.  That PDXLUG has flatly
rejected gentle pleas to "Do the Right Thing" reflects on their good
faith (or lack thereof).

Have I atempted to stop anybody form naming their own group?  That is
just silly.  Simple criticism is an attempt to prevent somebody from
doing something?

You are just as free to defend the choice as I am to criticize it, that
is how a free exchange works.

No wonder the PDXLUG list is so tight.

We don't plan on discontinuing the usage of the description 'a Portland 
Linux User Group' any time soon....so, can we just agree to disagree?

I'll let you continue this debate with yourselves as you apparently like

You folks are really reading deep into that original statement. I don't 
think that my observations of the distinction between PLUG and PDXLUG is 
designed or enforced, I think it's a matter of the individual preference 
in the different groups.  I think if you were to start a flame like this 
on PDXLUG it would be squelched because the majority doesn't want to 
talk about it,  not that some evil dictator didn't want it there (so 
much for the totalitarian conspiracy theory).

..that would be yet another theory, but I'd like to think that Big 
Brother controlled PDXLUG...and perhaps PDXLUG was created by members of 
PLUG who wanted to keep PLUG members in order and off topic...and ignore 
what was really happening behind the scenes of PLUG.

...but that is just my theory.

Frankly, other than Robby's occasional lapses into reasonableness, I 
have yet to see much in the way of intelligent discussion on this 
topic.  But it is funny to hear someone who basically concurred with the 
assessment of  PDXLUG as Nazis complain about ad hominem attacks. 

Maybe you *do* have a sense of humor.

We do too.  Choice _and_ distinction.  There are lots of LUG's in the
area.  PLUG people don't have _any_ problem with them.  Ask yourself why.

If PDXLUG wanted "to avoid this retarded argument", it should have
chosen a distinct name to begin with, to, er, avoid this retarded
argument.

I'd be happy to show you the bounces privately, if you don't believe

Message-ID: <1074551555.18952.14.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I have a cd written on an XP system that I can't read under
X-Cdroast, but it does read under Linux.  I popped in 
another burned CD, read and copied it just fine.  Under 
98SE, my adpatec easy cd creator works fine with the 
offending cd.  I get an error under XCdroast with this 
disc that no cd is loaded.  I have an old mitsumi dvd 
drive that I'm trying to copy it from, at least I think 
it's a mitsumi unit.  Thinking scratched disc, I slipped 
in a copy made under Windows to no avail

Must be a formatting secret.  I would expect XCDroast to 
be able to read the disc raw though.  I can copy the disc
contents to a Linux partition and go that route, but I'm 
still curious what the different is with this disc that
it won't register in XCDroast.

This isn't slander.  It's an accurate description of the organization.

It is true that the organization has a few keyholders who make binding
decisions for the organization and must be swayed in order to make
anything happen under that organization's banner.  Their control is total.

If you don't LIKE those words and you think that's a BAD THING, that's a
different story.

It ain't slander if it's true.

Anybody that disagrees with the keyholders has been silenced.  Of course
there's no discussion.

Absolutely not.  Talking about such a thing openly would make the ploy
obvious and defeat the purpose entirely.

But I don't think anybody's claiming that wsa ever the intent.  The intent
is to disrupt, not usurp.

Anyway, from where I'm sitting, PDXLUG appears to be the vanity project of
a few people who think things are best run from the top down.  Anarchism
is anathema to people like that and so anything that makes it harder for
the community to function without authoritarian controls is good for them.
Bringing this down to a legal argument where the state must intervene is
supportive of the authoritarian philosophy and furthers their cause even
if the final decision of the state is rendered in favor of the open
community.

Actually, it was Moussilini.  He was a strong supporter of private
enterprise and competition as well.

The analogy holds, however.  The difference is only in scale.

If EITHER of these were the case, they would be proof contrary to Cliff's
analysis of why PDXLUG was created.

This thread is ridiculous already, take further replies to plug-talk.
As far as a community list where there's a moderator, I tried bringing
a problem to the attention of the list where I was being harassed and
ended up getting myself kicked off.  In my opinion, aggressive posture
using the list needed to be in the open so I put it there couched in
an on topic post as background for the post.  That didn't fly at all.

This is utter paranoia.  You clearly overestimate the importance of a 
user group.    I used Linux for over 10 years before I ever subscribed 
to PLUG's mailing list and then unsubscribed shortly afterwards because 
people there seemed so uptight ("discussions of postgresql vs access are 
OT" was the cry).  User groups are useful and nice, but to think that 
anyone would want to disrupt one for some sort of personal gain is just 
so methamphetamine-driven as to be a cause of concern for one's mental 
state.

Why do you feel the need to keep shifting the argument.  It _isn't_
about PDXLUG (at least not directly).  The argument is about "Portland
Linux User Group", to which a stealth prefix "a" has been selectively
added recently.

Since when does a LUG require administrative job duties? You seriously 
take this LUG stuff way too seriously.

PDXLUG was started with the goal of being less formal and more specific 
to linux stuff... and the domain name is privately owned and if the 
owner of said domain so chooses to banish people from utilizing their 
resources, than so be it. I don't agree with it completely, but I will 
not take their freedom away to do just that...nor will I take away your 
attempt to post something linux related on a linux forum. (if it is 
blocked in some way, perhaps one must look back at prior posting to 
figure out why that is the case) However, i am not the one to speak to 
about that...as I am not 'that' key holder.

Perhaps that is where PDXLUG and PLUG differ..(amongst other areas)

once again, I only tried to offer a resource to your group members and 
this is how you return the offer... so in the future, I will remember to 
keep our resources to my/ourselves...as it apparently is not wanted in 
your open group..at least by a few of you because of a naming dispute?

It was a thread that you yourself (IIRC) started and participated in
both before and after I tried to contribute some facts to the discussion.

This is how society works... if something isn't working for everyone, 
than people make attempts to help bridge the gap.

I thought the addition of 'a' was appropiate as part of our description, 
as to clearly let it be known that we are one of many...however I've 
already stated this and this seems redundant now...however redudant 
posts require redudant responses.

Because the argument is about the *name*.  The name is PDXLUG.  A 
Portland Linux user group is what it *is*.

As soon as I heard about threads being squashed and people being removed

Really?  It's not entirely up to Matt and Robby (and whatever other
minority they've delegated) whether or not a person gets kicked off their
mailing list?  It can be done without their permission?  Someone can be
kept on the list if those people don't want that person on the list?

About PLUG, the name, or the nature of the organizations.

Your contention is that the naming of the organization was somewhat
coincidental -- a by-product of the traditional LUG naming conventions.
But how does that explain the initial decision to hold the group meetings
on the same night as PLUG's?  And what about the quoted sniggering about
the confusion caused with O'Reilly and Linux Journal?

> You clearly overestimate the importance of a user group.

I don't understand what the importance of a user group has to do with my
statement.

At least they are allowed to cry about whatever they like without being
silenced by the authorities.

First, I didn't write anything about personal gain (the gain would be a
vindication of personal philosophy, which is an affirmation of one's world
view and important enough to some to start entire world wars).  Second, I
don't know what you could possibly mean by "methamphetamine-driven".
Third, this is just another ad hominem attack without any substantial
response to the argument at all.

An axiom can't be false, only inconsistent with other logical systems.

Which axiom is inconsistent with your worldview?

It's not completely democratic if it's secret.  That's an oxymoron.

Hm.  That's debatable as well, since I have not referred to anyone else 
as a Nazi:

Godwin's Law: "As a Usenet discussion grows longer, the probability of a 
comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one."

As I said, I haven't *compared* anyone as such, and further, as has 
since been clarified, my recall of history was a bit flawed and we've 
actually only hit the Mussolini stage ;-)

Do you know what Ad Hominem means?  If you do could you explain what
that has to do with Nazis or where I equated PDXLUG with Nazis?

If you can't handle criticism without getting personal then maybe you
need PDXLUG.

NB: dictatorial actions are not equivalent to Nazisim.

Seriously seriously?

But seriously, doesn't PDXLUG ban people from the mailing list?  Is that
not an administrative duty?

Well, that's exactly what I wrote earlier, but Cliff took umbrage.  PLUG
is an open community and PDXLUG is a totalitarian regime.

America is a representative republic, democracy doesn't work.
This became clear with Shay's rebellion and the powerlessness
of the nation's initial Confederate government to regulate 
Interstate commerce, etc.  The South's short lived 
Confederacy didn't work either.  That may have been more 
economic than anything else though.  Why is this still on
plug?

Be careful... 'case law' has demonstrated the intentional comparison
between something and the Nazi movement such as to invoke Godwin's Law
and declare a thread dead makes the law in regards to that post null and
void.

Insert disclaimer: IANAL, even in laws of usenet/mailing lists.  :-)

So, basically, what it boils down to is that PDXLUG == The Matt King
Tree Fort?  I think it would be helpful to potential new PDXLUG
members to see that up front.

Maybe I am woefully naive, but I've always seen PLUG as a group that
is intended to benefit the whole community, so I guess maybe that's
another difference between the two.

and I never claimed to have made any graphics in the past that didn't 
include 'a' but have been noted several times that I am doing what I can 
to use that as a description of PDXLUG..from at least a month ago when I 
first brought it up as I felt it was worth discussing and debating. The 
old stuff will be changed in time...and thanks for bringing those to my 
attention.

Well both of you have engaged in personal attacks, I take that to mean
that you have nothing more intelligent to say and are reduced to
personal attack.  This kind of limits further discussion.

Several months ago there was an article in phpArchitect Magazine
(http://www.phparch.com/) on migrating from MySQL to PostgreSQL.  I had to
buy a copy of hte magazine (approx. $3.00 US) but since it is an e-mag (in
PDF) I had a copy in just a few minutes.
   I'm going to work on migrating the php/MySQL users to php/PostgreSQL.  
This got a pretty good review on one of the PostgreSQL lists.  My 
understanding was it was good for non-php people moving to PostgreSQL 
also.

Well, having learnt vim in order to impress my girlfriend, I put this in
my ~/.pinerc: editor="vim +%d \"+set textwidth=70\" %s"
(Don't forget enable-alternate-editor, maybe even -implicitly.)

Later, a discussion in Linux-Elitists made me try Mutt again.  It was
uncomfortable to switch, but it defaulted to using vim, so no conf
changes were necessary.

Said discussion included a config to make Mutt work almost like Pine,
but I preferred to learn it as-is, especially in light of the *other*
discussion of how frustrating it was to use a UI that almost, but not
quite mimics another program's UI.

In vim, I use the 'gq' command to reformat text. It handles indent/quote
characters quite nicely.  Others include 'd]]' (delete from here to the
end of file), 'D' (delete to the end of line), 'J' (stick the next line
on the end of this one), '.' (repeat the last command), 'u' (undo) and
'~' (swap upper/lower case; perfect for those cAPS-lOCK accidents.)

One of my machines at work.  I have apache running as what will be my
office intranet.  Today I went to the main page and ended up at
http://dissociatedpress.net.  So I went to the machine and tried to go
to localhost in my browser.  I ended up at www.localhost.en.net or
something like that.  resolv.conf is the same as it always has been.
I ran chkrootkit and was told that "bindshell" had infected me bound
to port 600.  I can't figure out much about that.  ps -aux didn't tell
me much but when I disconnected the network cable, it just hung.
Anyway I rebooted and now everything is back to normal.
What the hell am I supposed to do now?

Please read more carefully.  It's tiring having to explain every email

Again, I misrembered the source of the quote.  Can we get over that

Hm, I'm not really a fan of Matt myself (although I only know him

It's funny, because each group sees themselves that way and sees the 
other group as a bunch of [insert various *libelous* term].  Of course, 
I'm certain that isn't entirely the case for either group.   Perhaps if 
PLUG weren't trying so desperately to distance themselves from PDXLUG 
there wouldn't be this rift.   The fact that Robby offered to loan books 
to people in PLUG and this thread is the response should say a lot about 
your group.

Look, I'm certain that you're a really great guy when your clubhouse 
world isn't being shaken by outsiders.  Nevertheless, I've found your 
obtuseness the real limiting factor in this discussion.   Had you 
impressed me at all with any sort of intelligent retort at any point in

Actually, in the past, yes.  Today, no.  Why?   Because this topic has 
finally gotten on my last nerve.    As far as I'm concerned, if people 
want to bring this up and whine about it, then they can get ready to 
argue.  If they can defend themselves, good for them.  If they can't 
then they should shutup or get ready for the flames.

You probably are already aware, but you can use 'd' plus any movement
command: 'dG' deletes to the end of the buffer, 'd$' deletes to the end of
the line, 'd/foo' deletes up to the next occurance of 'foo', etc.

I also get a lot of use out of ':%! whatever', which means filter the
entire buffer through 'whatever', with whatever being a shell command or
even pipeline.  I often do something like so:

:%!awk '/.... 0087/ {print $2}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n

I would guess that could all be accomplished within vim, but it works,
and I know how to do it.

The cdrtools actually have a program for dumping a CD that is preferable 
to dd:  readcd.  If you have cdrecord installed then you should have 
this as well.

The intrusion recovery pages from CERT may be of some use:

http://www.cert.org/nav/recovering.html

However, in a nutshell, you break out your installation media and
reinstall everything, taking care not to save any executables from the
system that is now compromised.

Sucks, eh?

Cliff, you don't scare me, frankly your posts have stopped being an
argument and have simply become abusive.  The have lost what little
rationality and simply personal attacks, completely lacking
intelligence.  Flame away.  I doubt I will have anything more to say on

I think it's entirely the case that PLUG is intended to benefit the whole
community and that PDXLUG has chosen a path that allows selection of
benefit which PLUG has rejected.  I don't see how you can deny those
facts.

I think it's important to distance one's self from organizations with
which one is ideologically at odds.

OUR group, Cliff.  You're here, too.  You can't distance yourself from
PLUG and be a member at the same time.

It's all the trolling that's wearing on you man!  Your nerves wouldn't be
so bare if PDXLUG would just step up and do the right thing.  Take a
couple breaths and talk with Robbie about a better name. It would
certainly require less effort than you've expended in the last hour.

Well, you're wrong.  I've personally seen an email from a very prominent 
member of PLUG who basically admitted that his concerns over the name 
were mostly centered around garnering business for his firm.   I don't 
see how that benefits anyone but the individual in question.   Maybe you 
should apply the same critical eye to your own organization before you 
start pointing out the flaws in others.

This is not ideology.  It's group of people who like an operating 
system.   The fact that there were some personality conflicts does not 
make it grounds for the accusations that have been flung about today.   
Also, the fact that the palm branch has been slapped from Robby's hand 
several times doesn't make PLUG look any better.

Well, that is certainly a breath of fresh air.  As I mentioned earlier, 
were it not for the constant complaining about something that I consider 
completely beneath the radar of things that are even remotely important, 
I would probably have no desire to distance myself from PLUG.   I have 
been a content and helpful contributor to several lists but never in my 
life have I seen so much time and energy (and I'm not just referring to 
today) spent on such frivolousness.  If I didn't personally know several 
PDXLUG members and *know* for a *fact* what their intentions are, then I 
might not be so defensive about the mudslinging that several members on 
this list seem so fond of.   Frankly, knowing Robby quite well (and 
having a fairly high opinion of him as a person) and having seen how he 
has tried to quell this argument and appease people I've become quite 
aggravated with the unreasonableness of many people here.  

Robby made an upfront offer to share resources from PDXLUG.  In response 
he got a tirade about a stupid fucking name.   In fact, not even the 
name, but how the LUG should be *described*.   There's something 
seriously wrong with that.  I'm sorry that people who aren't involved 
had to endure this thread, but frankly, if public proclamations are 
going to be made then the responses should be public as well.

Subject: [PLUG] Is Reporting Spam A Wast of Time?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0401191714440.14204-100000@gisnet.com>

For nearly five weeks now I've been receiving virus-spams from Road
Runner's IP 24.208.135.215 -- about 1-2 per day. I've politely reported
them -- headers and all -- to abuse at rr.com, and always received the
worthless auto-response from them. Apparently, mail to their abuse team
just gets ignored because I'm still getting a steady light drizzle of
klez.

What's the point of trying to stop spam and viruses by reporting them when 
the ISP responsible doesn't care? What does one do to get their attention? 
Does anyone have a procmail recipe to relay these spams to Glenn A. Britt 
(head of Road Runner) or someone at Time Warner (Road Runner owners) who 
cares? If you can't stop spam going through the proper channels, then that 
bodes badly for the future of this problem. Are spammers flooding the 
abuse sites to render them useless? Should I accuse rr.com of harboring 
domestic terrorism? What to do?

I can easily send these to dev/null, but that's so unsatisfying,
especially knowing that the spammer is free to run amok. It's frustrating!

There is also cdrdao, geared toward audio CD's, it sometimes reads when
others fail, and it sure is fun to play with.

I think it was rather unavoidable because PLUG didn't become PLUUG[1]
when the name changed to Portland Linux/Unix User's Group.  IMHO, it
should have.

One member's actions do not impact the whole of the organization... unlike
PDXLUG.

It's about open systems versus closed.  PDXLUG has chosen a route where
exclusion is practiced and authority in the hands of the few.  That's
ideological.

Which personality conflicts?  The ones that caused the PDXLUG people to
get in a huff because they couldn't kick people out of PLUG?  I don't
quite know what you mean.

I think you mean "olive branch".  And it was as much a peace offering as
Bush's "peace plan" in the Middle East; i.e., "Can't we all just do it my
way?"

It's the same breath I've been breathing for years.  Thanks for smelling.

The beauty of PLUG is that it embraces things that important to some even
if they're "completely beneath the radar of things that are even remotely
important" to others.

But your whole point today seems to be to put down any attempt by people
who disagree with you to redress their grievances.

Do share.  But you're 0-1 on your guesses up to this point.  It's not
about having a list where OT discussion is safe, that's been proven.

I think perhaps you're letting your prejudices get in the way.  Robby may
well be a nice guy, but he has done very little to appease anybody.  He's
rigidly stood his ground while others were in distress.

> Robby made an upfront offer to share resources from PDXLUG.

Um, no.  Robby pointed out that a resource existed.  It was already open
to anybody's participation.  He didn't make any offer.

I'm perfectly content to see the public responses.  It's shown at least
one person that PDXLUG is supports a dictatorship and is non-responsive to
public concerns.  (See plug-talk for details.)

Discourse is good.  Flinging insults is not.

OK, I was looking for that one.  It'd been mentioned before and I've
needed it MANY times and not recalled the key sequence.

However, didn't somebody have a more complex reply-quoting scheme that
involved piping the mail through some external utility?

I recall reading about something, but I don't recall when.

It's surely in Russell's mail archive, but that's not online and
searchable yet... and I don't think I'd have enough information to make a
time-efficient search.

First, PLUG didn't change, it just adopted an over-arching banner in
addition to the old moniker (see previous references to original
discussion).

Second, it's not Portland Linux/Unix User's Group, but Portland Linux/Unix
Group.

I, myself, once suggested Portland Unix-GNU-Linux Users' Group, but it
didn't fly.

I liked the inclusion of GNU (because CERTAINLY we welcome discussion of
cygwin utilities in addition to the idealistic affiliation) and I liked
the uniqueness of PUGLUG.

I think we welcome the discussion of pretty much any subject having to
do with computers, some more than others.

Very true, and it is very hard to restrain oneself when people
substitute ridicule for argument.  To not respond to insults, to give
the last word to somebody who can't tell the difference between a
comment on behaviour and a personal attack.  One can only hope that most
people are intelligent enough to tell the difference between restraint
and surrender.

Rose City Linux User's Group sounds good to me.  rclug.org appears to be

Unfortunately some might find that offensive, which points out that
YAPLUG might conflict with the Linux Users group on Yap Island :P

We need to create an open database for LUG's.  I propose we design a
global rollout of a hesiod namespace.  Names will be dished out first

Like you are right now?  Stick to the point.

I think the entire issue in this thread is PDXLUG tried to pass itself
off as PLUG, and then *denied* doing so.  I think that's the only
thing actually at issue in this thread.  So what's so hard about
making a public announcement going, "Whoops, our bad, we meant to say
we're "A Portland linux user group", not The Portland Linux User
Group.

What's so hard about that?

Would it be politically correct to hold meetings at the Expo Center

Watch Vancouver, BC LUG get assigned something nonsensical like CYVR
(the identifier for Vancouver International Airport, just like
Hillsboro's is KHIO, and Portland's is KPDX).

I'd say advances Debian has forced other distros to make in their
package management systems, KDE3, the maturity of koffice and OO.o and
live-on-CD distros like Knoppix have done way more for that than any
local LUG could ever do.

Rose City Linux User's Group *is* a good name. Many of the other
suggestions are good too. However, I think JAPLUG sounds too close to a
racial epithet.

For that matter PDXLUG by it's self is fine. All they need to do to avoid
more "whining" from us is drop "Portland Linux Users Group" from their web
page and promotional materials.

Godwin's Law states, "As a Usenet discussion grows longer, the
probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one."

This brings up several issues with your response:

1) Godwin's Law is not invocable because it states a constant:  It
   always applies, even if the topic is not about Nazis, Hitler, World
   War II, the 1930s and 1940s, the Holocaust, or anything else
   remotely related to those subjects.

2) It is possible you mis-learned Godwin's Law states that a
   conversation automatically stops when one of the topics above is
   mentioned.  This is not the case.

3) Even if Godwin's Law did state that the conversation stops,
   Googling for nazi|hitler godwin group:<insert any active group
   here> should give you plenty of examples that this is not the case.
   Leave off the group argument to get as many examples as there are
   dollars added to the national debt by Republican politics within my
   lifetime.  In fact, the opposite is true: Deliberately trying to
   trigger Godwin's Law usually causes the odds of the thread ending
   anytime soon to approach zero.

The Law itself, as it is written, no.  Just as the 14th Ammendment
doesn't directly state you must be marandized when you are arrested.

Case law, however, has shown a thread is dead after the comparison is
made...

WOW...   Been gone for a few hours and missed 54 messages on this topic. 
Looks like this is the only thing PLUG has to talk about. Damn, I feel 
bad for the newcomers of the list, they can't get a word in edgewise and 
have no idea what this issue is about.

But I'm not totally sure I've been compromised.  The fact that all is
well after a reboot is encouraging.  I think.

I think you are assuming a lot about people's intentions.   PDXLUG was 
called one thing, a few people complained, so someone did something 
about it.   The entire issue is that PLUG apparently is entirely as 
bitchy as I've been told and can't get over it.

Because, they've said it a hundred times, but no one wants to hear it.   
No one in PLUG asks politely for them to change the site, Robby came up 
with the solution himself after a slew of whining on this list.  The 
real question is why it's so hard for certain PLUG members to accept 
that offering and let the issue drop?

I have a better solution: PDXLUG can be known as "Portland's Only 
Non-Profit Linux User Group" and that should clear things up.

Are you running PortSentry? If so, it may be a false positive:

I think you understood his point, Godwin's law was tongue in cheek, not
some deep cosmic truth, like Newton's 1st law.

No, but the fact that he was instrumental in starting this entire 
argument and the fact that his reasons for starting the argument were 
entirely self-serving should be enough for you to reconsider your own 
reasons for doing his dirty work.   You might not have been aware of 
this at the time, but now that you are I would expect that you might 
have a second thought on whether PDXLUG is quite the villain you thought.
Quite frankly,  I just spoke to a friend of mine who has not been 
involved in *any* of this, but is familiar with some of the players and 
he informed me that the person I am referring to usually works this 
way:  he manipulates others into doing what he wants.   He likes to be 
the "power behind the power".   As ridiculous as that seems in regards 
to a computer club (that's that it is, don't fool yourself), he uses his 
status in the club to boost his business.  He truly does see PLUG as a 
business.    An advertising and promotional business.   And you are 
helping him.

I still haven't seen this.  If I discover this is indeed the case, then 
I will probably leave that group.  I certainly won't hang about 
defending people who lack integrity.   You might consider your own 
stance here.

Whatever.  Rehashing history doesn't make your case any stronger.  What 
is in the past is just that.  The people I've met in PDXLUG don't appear 
to be that way at all.   Maybe you are doing just what you accused me 
of: labeling an entire group based on the actions of one person.  But 
frankly, from the interactions I've had with most of the people in that 
group, I'd be inclined to call you a liar, whereas the interactions I've 
had with PLUG in the past tended to mesh with what I've since heard from 
others.  Go figure.

Okay, I've told you that Robby is a decent person, probably a lot more 
decent than you.  He is one of the few people I know who actually has 
beliefs and stands by them.   I seriously doubt you can make that same 
claim.   I'll bet I could make you drop your dearest beliefs quicker 
than you dropped your dress on prom night if I chose to do so.  So 
please refrain from insulting your betters.

Frankly, it's starting to smell like shit.   You offer a handshake with 
one hand and a slap (however feeble) with the other.  But, I should have 
known, after all, I was warned by some members of PDXLUG that PLUG 
members were mostly cowards.

No, as I've stated before, I find the whining and bad-mouthing of people 
I like in a public forum to be repulsive.  You obviously have a clever, 
if cowardly, way of trying to turn the bitch-fest I've witnessed on this 
list sound like some free-speech lovefest, but frankly it was gossip and 
of the worst kind as well.   You rename it to whatever you like, but it 
doesn't change what it is.  I appreciate freedom of speech as much as 
the next person, but that doesn't mean I have to respect the person 
utilizing that freedom. 

Try to answer honestly for once:  why is it that when someone (okay, me) 
engages in a discussion about the merits of PostgreSQL vs Access (this 
was several months ago)  a bunch of people scream "OT" and that's *them* 
exercising their freedom of speech, but when *I*, by myself, decide to 
protest their actions, I'm not exercising mine?   Why aren't you 
defending me?   Oh wait:  because it isn't in your best interest.   Duh.

Actually, if you knew anything at all, you would know that most PDXLUG 
conversation doesn't take place on the mailing list.   The mailing list 
is mostly for technical advice and announcements.   That is why going OT 
is discouraged there.   There is plenty of OT discussion elsewhere, if 
that's what you like.   But then, speaking from ignorance appears to be 
the one skill you've developed to it's fullest potential.

Distress?   _Distress_???? Are you serious?   One day,  I hope to laugh 
directly in your face for that remark.   You must really have no idea 
what that word means.

Whatever.     If PDXLUG were really the exclusive group you claim, then 
those resources certainly wouldn't be open to anybody's participation.  
Please be consistent.

If you try to use unsupported claims to support your argument, I'm going 
to call you on it.   It's easy to fling barbs at others and then retreat 
behind the "ad hominem attack!" shield, but frankly, the harshest words 
have come directly from users in this group, mostly towards people who 
aren't here defending themselves.   I find it pathetic when people start 
a fight they're afraid to finish.

If a ping on localhost is returning anything other than 127.0.0.1 (as 
the OP claimed) then he's been compromised.   I would never trust that 
machine again.

Follow the earlier advice and reinstall.   Actually, if you're running 
an older version of your distro, then you could probably get away with 
an upgrade to a newer version and see the problem go away since most 
likely the upgrade will replace every binary on your system.   Then you 
just have to check the stuff under /usr/local (and other places that 
aren't typically used by the distro) for lingering binaries/scripts and 
replace/remove them.

Who is this 'we'? There's nothing wrong with PDXLUG, but there sure is 
something wrong with the PLUG list. I've never see such a pack of nitpicky, 
useless, whiny posters who insist on beating irrelevant subjects to death. 
The noise ratio here is unbelievable. I subscribe to a lot of lists, and this 
one has the largest garbage-to-good stuff ratio, by far.

Don't worry, I won't let the door hit me on the way out.

Read this carefully: I don't care if it was meant as a troll. It is an
acceptable solution to us.

Frankly I'm a little surprised here.   Taken aback, even.   Who is 
"we"?   How do you speak for "we"?   How can you say that this is 
acceptable so quickly, without hearing from anyone else concerned?   I 
would like one question answered:  is PLUG not for profit (or not)?
I know that at least one prominent member uses it as a tool to promote 
his business, but is this the standard, accepted situation?   If so, 
then I would certainly agree that this would be a good solution.   If 
most members of PLUG believe it to be non-profit, the someone is going 
to end up with egg on their face should this change take place.

I'm really sorry you feel that way. Think for a minute what it would be
like if you put ten years of your life into Bratgrrl Computing, and
someone tried to steal the name from you. What would you do?

What about Russell and Dan's particular comments about being kicked off
the PDXLUG list and their mail questioning the situation going unanswered
or bounced?

Russell, for one, has offered to show the bounces.

Then you haven't met Matt King, poobah of the mailing list.  It's been
demonstrated that he is "that way".

I'm labelling the actions of the founder on the action of the founder.
You'll find that I'm writing about the founding of the group and the
intent when those founding actions were taken (creating the mailing list,
choosing the name, setting up initial meetings, etc.).

I've made no blanket comment about all members of the mailing list or
attendees of the meetings.

I suggested earlier that your prejudice in favor of Robby might be
tainting your view of the situation and I think the above comments
re-enforce that suggestion.

Well, this is all just personal invective and conjecture.

My first contact with Robby was, I believe, when he came to me to take
over some of the administrative duties for the Independent Media Center
here in Portland (that was you, wasn't it Robby?).  I've had very little
contact with him since and I am not going to attempt to judge which of us
is the "better".

But your comments that I, personally, do not stand by my beliefs are not
only false, but written in pure ignorance of my beliefs and conviction by
them.

It's the same breath.

You've done most of the bad-mouthing yourself.  The statement of
grievances could be called "whining", but that is their right and if you
feel their grievance is unwarranted, you should strike it down on merit
rather than insulting the person making the grievance.

What was gossip?  Your "it" is ambiguous.

Again, which "it"?

You don't HAVE to respect people, but I believe it's the decent and
honorable thing to do.

I don't recall the discussion, actually.  But it sounds like you were
really scorned and are quite bitter about it.  If it means anything, I'm
sorry you were treated in a way that made you feel so bad.

Exactly how did you protest the actions of those that screamed "OT"?

The nice thing about PLUG is that everyone and their mother can scream
"OT" and you can go right on discussing it.

> Oh wait:  because it isn't in your best interest.  Duh.

If you think you know the answer, don't ask.  If you don't know the
answer, wait until you get an answer before you dismiss the question.

So what does it mean to be a "member" of PDXLUG if subscription to the
mailing list is not a requirement?  Is anyone participating in ANY PDXLUG
condoned event a "member"?  The word "membership" has no meaning if there
isn't some discrete method for telling what is and is not a member.  What
defines the set?

With PLUG, we say that anybody who subscribes to the mailing list is a
member.  It's pretty cut and dry that way.  That, combined with the
unmoderated nature of the list, what makes the organization totally open.

I know what the word means.  Some folks felt that they and their work is
suffering from the confusion of the groups and are attempting to take that
grievance up wherever they can to get it resolved and remove the strain.

Why are you so negative about this?  We are adults here.  You can concede
the point without being dismissive.

There's nothing inconsistent here.

A totalitarian regime can run public services.  Look at the Catholic
Church.

By all means.  Which claim needs more support?

It's not a shield.  It's a reason to dismiss your comments.  You don't
really take up the substance of the argument, but, rather, say nasty
things about the people with whom you disagree.  Respond to the substance
with measured, intelligent rebuttal and real steps can be made toward
understanding.

And by the way, ALL of the words in this thread, not just the "harshest",
came directly from users in this group.  We're ALL users in this group.
Every single participant in this discussion is a user in this group.  You
write as though you are somehow not one of those people, but that's
absurd.

> I find it pathetic when people start a fight they're afraid to finish.

Forgive me for the assumption, but this appears to be some kind of defense
mechanism that allows you to feel victorious when, in fact, people just
got sick of going around in circles with your insults and dodges.  When a
point is made to which you have no response, you fling out an insult.
When a response is made to one of your arguments to which you have no
reasonable rebuttal, you dismiss it with "whatever" or the like.

Listen to the arguments and respond to the arguments (and not the people
making the arguments) and see if we don't all find a more pleasant
discussion that might actually improve the state of things.

It seems clear that something has happened. Whether or not the 'hack'
has permanently damaged the system and poses a risk to (your) other
computers, I can't say for sure. The question I would recommend you ask
yourself is, are you willing/able to take the chance? 

If the answer is yes, then maybe this is an opportunity to poke around,
learn computer forensics, and have fun. 

If the answer is no, the only way to fix this for sure is to wipe the
system and reinstall. Really. Honestly. Truly.

OK, that's it, I'm unsubscribing.  I've been on 
the plug list (the original one) off and on for some years now, but I'm 
finding both sides of this un-civil war annoying. 

Time to get a Mac and join the local OSX LUG.

Correct me if I am wrong.

I do believe the correct term is <Not for Profit>

Can you have a DBA with a trademark in the name? Linux belongs to Linus
and it seem like he would have to approve the DBA? Did he approve the

Actually, they haven't.   This is at least partially why I am getting 
annoyed with all the bandwagon jumpers.  I would like to hear a coherent 
reason *why* anyone should be upset about PDXLUG.   Please spare me the 
horror stories about how emotionally abusive everyone there is as this 
list is at *least* as bad.   Instead, give me one solid reason why this 
should matter to anyone, anyone at all (except David Mandel, who's 
intentions I'm already aware of).   If you do, I'll address that and 
perhaps we can come to some sensible conclusion and not call the entire 
day a waste.

I am going to disregard the rest of your email as your condescending 
tone is just too irritating to respond to in any rational way.   Please 
feel free to explain yourself in a short, concise fashion and I'll do 
the same.

Name the person or persons you are accusing. Otherwise this is an
unsubstantiated insult to the group. I also note that YOU have been
instrumental in this thread continuing.

This is a gross insult of everyone subscribed to this mailing list.
Withdraw your comment. If you wish to continue insults I imagine it might
be possible to write one insulting message to _you_, and you will find
yourself burried.

I do not claim everyone on the PLUG lists are saints, but you have been
noticed crossing the line first. I think the best approach would be to
terminate this thread immediatly.

Has anybody "put ten years of their life" into PLUG?  Whoever it is 
might consider getting a little distance, to many it is only a mailing list.

I think you are referring to something like the following, which I have
in my .vimrc (the latter being taken from Wil Cooley):

  map = {!}fmt -c -u
}
  map + {!}fmt -c -u -p"> "
}

(Note that the '
' is an actual carriage return, ascii 0x0d. I forget
the mechanism for entering it into vi.)

The former will pipe a paragraph through fmt(1), the latter will do
the same, but will only apply to (singlely) quoted text. I find fmt(1)
does a better job of justifying text than vim's internal mechanisms,
though it has some quirks of its own. Also, using fmt(1) like so should
be vi-clone agnostic.

With vim handling email, the other thing I did was modify
~/.vim/after/syntax/mail.vim to modify the quoted text color scheme
to match the scheme I use in mutt (thanks to Seth Arnold for the file
location).

One of the things I miss from yon olden dayes, when nearly everybody's
exposure to a *nix system was an account on a time-sharing system rather
than their own personal desktop machine, was being able to poke around
in other people's homedirs and look at the nifty things they would do
with their dot-files.

Perhaps it would be best if you showed some restraint and stopped
posting while angry?  Feel free to write it all out, just hit abort
instead of send.  Trust me, it gets it out of your system.

Yeah, I've written huge diatribes and got to the end of reviewing it
and sending it, and saying to myself: "Screw it. I don't care that
much." Feels oh so much better about 10 minutes later.

Yikes...now *that* is a community with a hard mold to break.  Though,
wouldn't it just be easier to just have procmail drop all articles
containing a header that has the message-id of the first message in
the thread?  Thread is gone, you never hear from it again, even when
it changes subject lines, then.

I suspect any newbies are just as likely to throw something out there
now as they ever were before.  After all, debian-user at lists.debian.org
is used to seeing this much traffic all the time (though not all in
one single thread).

I suspect this has something to do with the advent of threaded mail
readers such as mutt or kmail.  My condolences if your POS MUA hasn't
joined us in the third millennium yet.

Forgive my memory, for this thread is long and I might not have seen
it yet, I don't think you've insulted my intelligence yet.  Just about
everybody else's but considering I only jumped in around 1630(-0700),
I've stood mostly to the side.

Generally, the thread is dead long before that point.  Everybody's
just milling about in the lobby and really it's just the kicker event
that usually coincides with everybody getting in their car and going
home, if they hadn't done so already.

This thread is a pretty good example, really.  If people are smart,
this will be done by lunch tomorrow, at the very latest.

If it were simply about the name of a user group, I'd concur.  However,
many of the comments have been personal or general attacks on the
integrity of PDXLUG members, at least some of whom are personal friends
of mine.  I can certainly appreciate that there may have been (and
continue to be) personal frictions between certain individuals.  What I
don't appreciate is having people whom I like and respect publicly
attacked for no good reason.  PDXLUG, like PLUG, is composed of
/individuals/, many of whom might say or do things that do not reflect
the ideas or mores of the whole.  I certainly doubt all the members of
PDXLUG would condone my course of action.  I do not pretend to represent
PDXLUG, and it would be nice if the people who are claiming to represent
PLUG would acknowledge the same.

I have certainly fed into this today (intentionally, to be quite frank),
but the "discussion" and mudslinging started long before my first post. 
I am aware that it is a vocal minority who are attempting to speak on
behalf of the whole of PLUG and certainly acknowledge that there are
many decent and intelligent people on this list who have better things
to do with their time than follow this pointless flamewar.  My intention
here today was to highlight exactly how /annoying/ this entire argument
has been for quite some time and how it feels to have a personal attack
leveled at you on a public list.  I'll be quite honest though: if it
comes up again, I'll be right back.  There are apparently people who
cannot see how their constant harassment and bitching can be annoying to
others.  Maybe now that will be a little more clear.  If not, well, I
suppose I will be happy to fling insults and rebuttals as long as
necessary until perhaps they get bored enough to let it go or at least
keep it off of public forums.

Regards,
Cliff

True, and usually that is my preferred tactic when dealing with people I
consider able to appreciate it.  However it became clear early on that
most of the people with a bone to pick over this issue are uninterested
in any compromise or even having a genuine argument and really only want
to vent about people they've had a personal problem with.  That being
the case I didn't feel the need to actually win any such argument, just
give them a taste of their own medicine, so to speak.

I'd seriously be shocked if Gnome didn't have an equivalent, but it's

The new year brings us another Advanced Topics session and it brings it
to us this Wednesday!

Cooper Stevenson will talk about implementing Anti-Virus systems on
Linux at Jax 826 SW 2nd Ave, Portland OR. Jax is on the MAX Line, next
to Bally's Fitness. 

His implementation is a filter built out of Open Source tools that
include Postfix, SpamAssassin, Amavisd, and clamav. He reports that the
client he developed this for is very happy with this solution. (This
presentation was delayed from November due to the weather.) 

The meeting time will be 7:00pm, and will run until we either run out of
questions or answers or beer.

Happy hour prices are available on food for the first hour of the
meeting.  (But you have to buy a drink to get the happy hour prices.)

And, as I posted a while back, for your pre-meeting reading pleasure...

This page has one good way of doing the above using some database (the

domain, alias, and authentication tables (and the like).

You'll find that I haven't written that they SHOULD change their name.
I've merely corrected the misapprehensions you (and a couple of others)
have had about the history, apparent motivations of those people involved,
logical argument, and ideological differences between the organizations.

I think that's something you made up.  Dan wrote that the people on PDXLUG
were unwilling to discuss the issue like adults.  I (and others) wrote
that the list administrator runs a totalitarian regime.  But I don't think
anybody wrote anything about getting their feelings hurt.

The O'Reilly and Linux Journal mix-ups have been mentioned already.
That is, to my mind, example enough to prove that confusion does exist.

I was showing measured, respectful restraint.  I'm not going to have a
pissing contest with you and see who can seem more macho and bad-ass.

I thought maybe you couldn't see that you were being abusive and insulting
and ignoring the real arguments.  I thought I could help you to see that.
Help sometimes seems condescending to people who don't know how to take it
or don't see that they need it.

I think this requires some support.  You've been slinging personal insults
all day and I haven't read any insults from the people trying to address
the naming problem.

Which individuals?  I see you calling people stupid, ignorant, and

their integrity.

By all means, show us.  I just reviewed a goodly portion of the thread and

That's funny coming from the person who claims PDXLUG is run by
fascists.

Google is your friend.  There is plenty to support my claims and the
time frame extends well before todays little banter.

Robby Russell, personally, and the members of PDXLUG as a whole, myself
included.  If you don't know how, try rereading your own posts today.

Try harder.  Meanwhile, rather than rehash all of this over and over,
where most of the participants have long lost interest, why don't you
simply respond to the rather longish email I sent you offlist?  Or are
you unwilling/unable to engage in a real discussion all on your
lonesome?

Well, correcting people on other's motivations is rather shaky ground to
start with, especially for people whom you admit you don't know very
well.  Also, commenting on the ideology of an organization you aren't
part of and who has made no public announcment regarding any such
ideology is just as shaky.  But feel free to make unfounded assertions. 
They really forward your argument.

It was a bit of pointed sarcasm to try and motivate *someone* to stick
to the point and explain why PDXLUG should change their name rather than
argue about who did what and why they did it, which are probably things
that will never be agreed upon.

I missed the O'Reilly "mix up" thread but I am aware that PDXLUG was
more active in engaging O'Reilly regarding access to OSCON while
apparently whoever was responsible for PLUG dropped the ball.  That
isn't confusion, it's lack of organization on PLUG's part.

The simple fact is, I have tried to argue a single point all day: there
is no compelling reason why PDXLUG should change their name.  If you
won't address that then I'm not really interested in exchanging
pleasantries with you.

No, you were being condescending by assuming that I needed help.  I'm
still trying to help you understand what the topic of the argument is. 
We can certainly move to other topics later, but I'd at least like to
get this one thing resolved first.

Not quite, but keep trying.  Just in case you missed it the first couple
of times: please explain why PDXLUG should change their name.  For extra
points, do it without accusing PDXLUG of being fascists or bringing in
bizarre conspiracy theories about how they are trying to disrupt PLUG. 
Just lay out how damage is being done to PLUG (aside from driving people
away with these pointless arguments).

Going to bed now and hoping but not really expecting much better for
tomorrow.

I said that the organization was totalitarian, not that the people were
fascists.  Big difference.

I didn't write anything about a person's intelligence, personality, or
character.

If you're going to make those kinds of assertions, be prepared to back it
up.  You think I should have to wade through thousands of posts to find
the one or two you think were precipitous of the split.  Mostly, it was
Matt and Robby getting upset with me and Karl (though the two of us
weren't united on anything, it was a separate disagreement, I think).
Those would be the only "personal frictions", I would think.  And I
certainly don't feel them (though I've never been really upset by any of
this, just disappointed).

I don't see the purported attacks.  I know you think the claim of
totalitarianism was an attack, but, honestly, it was just an attempt to
describe the system in frank terms.  Sometimes people don't like that, but
the shoe definitely fits.

I certainly don't recall anything at all about Robby personally.

Right.  I really think it's in your head.  Message-IDs to the contrary
gladly accepted.

Nope, it's done.  I was doing that while you wrote this.  I went out
tonight with some friends and didn't respond to this stuff as it came in.

Now, to sleep.

The comments were based on the public actions; particularly, banning folks
from the list and bouncing off-list questions about the ban.  Since you
claim membership in PDXLUG and were not aware of these bans and bounces,
they were clearly not democratic.  Hence, the "totalitarian" shoe fits.

As I understand it, O'Reilly was contacted quite early by PLUG and was
awaiting follow-up when PDXLUG aggressively addressed O'Reilly and
O'Reilly assumed it was the same organization and so, understandably, made
no follow-up with the other contact.

Let's say you wanted to talk to someone about PLUG.  This person is
uninitiated into the deeper idiosynchracies of the community and is really
only superficially interested.  You don't want to overwhelm them with a
list of every group in town and, in fact, are pretty sure that PLUG is
exactly what they want in an organization.  If you tell them about PLUG,
they are going to assume one expansion of the acronym (an acronym with
more than one expansion, sort of like the double-recursive acronym of
HURD, but different -- most importantly, an INTENTIONALLY AMBIGUOUS
acronym), then you point them to the website at www.pdxlinux.org.  You
have to be clear about that because it's NOT pdxlug.org and just plain
"Portland Linux User Group" is not distinctive enough (since two groups go
by that name.  It then becomes necessary to explain the distinction to
prevent confusion.  From outside, this looks very confusing and makes it
appear as though there is some holy war that doesn't really exist.
There's actually no beef at all between the organizations, just a
ridiculous confusion that simply isn't getting addressed.  We all end up
looking way too divided and petty to be serious at all and the person
doesn't ever follow up.

I've sat by cringing while this actually happened.

There's no "No" about it.  You're agreeing with my last sentence.  You see
it as condescending because you do not believe you need help.

Does everything have to be a contradiction with you; even the agreements?

> Just in case you missed it the first couple of times: please explain why
> PDXLUG should change their name.

Done.  But note that I'm not saying they MUST do it or anything.  I'm just
telling you that the situation is confusing to outsiders and makes things
very difficult for casual communication with the unindoctrinated.  The
polite thing to do would be to use an unambiguously distinct moniker.

Again, done.

But since you bring it up, I will note that I'm still totally unclear as
to why you would bother creating a distinct organization when PLUG is
accepting of and open to all types of gatherings and mailing lists unless
you are seeking power or causing other kinds of trouble.

For the longest flame war[1] I've ever read, I actually learned several
things and would like to thank everyone for this increased knowledge. It
took 2 hours to scan through them all, but here are some insights for those
that don't want to take the time...

* "PLUG" is the officially-recorded NAME in Oregon for a computer user group
in the Portland area that focuses on various flavors of Linux and Unix and
related open source software.

* "Portland Linux/Unix Group" is the DESCRIPTION for PLUG, which was changed
from "Portland Linux Users Group" to better described what the group focuses
on.  It is understandable to me that changing the actual name (i.e. to
"PLUUG") would create unnecessary paperwork and possibly cost money.
Besides, the new description fits the original acronym while better
describing what the group is for and everyone knows who "PLUG" is.

* "PDXLUG" is the name of another, less formal, recently-formed computer
user group in the Portland, Oregon area that also focuses on Linux and
related software.  (I had no idea this group existed before this
"discussion" arose.)

* "A Portland Linux Users Group" is the DESCRIPTION for PDXLUG.

* Godwin's Law[2] can be handy, but must be applied carefully.  However, the
passionate people involved in the thread for which it is applied, can be so
overheated they ignore those trying to put out the fire.

* I really hope I never meet certain individuals when they're behind the
wheel of a large, motorized vehicle and get a bad case of road rage, because
they just never, ever stop!


And one thing that could've been applied here that I learned years ago when
my ex-wife was giving up all rights to our son so that she could get out of
thousands of dollars of back child-support:

* Sometimes, it really helps to write a seriously venting letter SEPARATE
from the one you actually send!

Nobody here attacked anybody associated with PDXLUG personally I have
made remarks about the actions of individuals, but even when you and
Robby attacked me personally I have not attacked you or anybody else.  I
have not seen anybody besides you and Robby make personal attacks on
this subject

A pretty good summary, though some of the points are still in
contention, but those issues will not likely be resolved here, if
anywhere. :)

Actually Konqueror does have samba support, i'm not sure if its a special plugin or not but i'm running gentoo and in the location bar you can use:

smb://servername/sharename/...

and if you do just "smb://servername" it'll grab the list of shares(if its accessible).

Is there a command in Linux that I can find out my

I ran dmesg but seems to only find the CPU clock speed.

Actually that does not appear to have complete speed information.

Brian,

Can you please provide an example of where I personally attacked you or 
anyone during this thread? I just re-read through each of my emails and 
the closest that I came to possibly 'attacking' anyone is when I said, 
"/me sends flowers to his friends and family. "  which is hardly an attack.

Please don't make accusations against me without any evidence..as I do 
not find that fair. Now stand up and do the right thing.

Cheers,

-Robby

Aggressively? As I am the primary contact for PDXLUG to O'Reilly, I can 
assure you that nothing remotely aggressive was done to get us a booth 
at OSCON last year. Yes, I originally used PDXLUG - Portland Linux User 
Group and they know that there are multiple groups in town..and from now 
on I will stress that we are merely PDXLUG...a Portland Linux user group.

IMHO, we did a good job at organizing a seperate mailing list (with 
public access) for those who wanted to be involved in OSCON, invited 
PLUG members... and didn't hide any of this. PLUG got involved at the 
last minute and that is at the fault of PLUG not PDXLUG.

Now, where did you hear such a ludicrous story from?

Cheers,

-Robby

This isn't about what Cliff said or did..could you please provide a 
'specific' example of where I (personally) questioned your intelligence?

Perhaps I missed something that I wrote when I read through my emails 
this morning.

I apologize that you feel that "/me sends flowers to his friends and 
family."  I was in no way trying to attack you and hope that you can 
accept my apology.

Sincerly,

they can keep the flowers :-p

You need not apologize, this has no effect on me.  I just find that when
people engaged in a discussion or argument start personal attacks it
often indicates that they have nothing intelligent to add to the
exchange.  Discussing the intelligence of the parties of an argument
regardless of the accuracy, is a personal attack, since the intelligence
of the arguer has no bearing on the intelligence or quality of the
argument.

Subject: [PLUG] secure methods for pushing content
Message-ID: <16397.31609.411007.78578@eris.dischordia.net>

What is the recommended way to push content from a local computer to a
server _without_ granting user-level access to the pusher?

I don't want a CMF, because all the ones I've seen present way too 
much overhead for the simple sites I'm dealing with.  There are 
no databases backing the sites, no separation between presentation
and content layers, no cgi's, etc.  (No lectures, please. [grin])

It would be really cool to simulate a push with a polling mechanism so
the website author could just hang the files somewhere and the server
goes out periodically and grabs the relevant parts, checks them for
undesirable features, then installs them.  But, I think that's just
a fantasy of mine.

Thanks for any advice.

I know the argument yesterday was painful to all involved but it was
designed to send a specific set of messages. Given that they had blocked
other channels of communication, it was necessary to do so in the PLUG
forum. Once again, here are the points:

1) Let PDXLUG know that this issue is not trivial to us.

2) Remind PDXLUG know that we have a legal right to the name.

3) Let PDXLUG know that the issue has not and will not go away until they
"do the right thing".

The messages have been sent. I want to thank everyone who participated. I
also want to apologize to the PLUG members who found it intolerable.

The description change was mostly a nod to the Free/Open/NetBSD people.
We wanted them to feel welcome. While users of proprietary Unix flavors
were and still are welcomed to participate in PLUG as well, those users 
were not the main focus of attention at the time of the change.

I faintly recall discussing the idea of changing PLUG to PLBG or some
such thing (for Portland Linux/BSD Group). But you can't pronounce
"PLBG" and there would have been that ugly paperwork.

Thanks for clearing up all of this. I am glad that we can agree to 
disagree.

I cannot speak for all of PDXLUG, but:

1.) I feel that this issue is trivial.

2.) I do not feel that using 'a Portland Linux user group' is in any way 
illegal and do not plan to change the methods in which I describe the 
group PDXLUG when people ask what it is. We call ourselves PDXLUG not 
'Portland Linux User Group' and this has been mentioned over and over 
and over...and yet you refuse to acknowledge this

3.) I felt that I had done the right thing when I helped start PDXLUG 
over a year ago and your posting has only reaffirmed this.

Thanks to all those who have joined PDXLUG over the past year (and the 
few that joined since this all started yesterday morning)... we offer a 
much more on topic discussion group....and do our best (even if it mean 
banning off-topic posters) to keep it that way.

Cheers,

Dan,

Before you throw the gauntlet down again (and take us right back to day 
1, as you've just done), why don't you consider a more diplomatic 
approach.   We both know that Robby at least has made some attempts to 
pacify you despite misgivings about the whole deal.   While I'm loathe 
to speak for PDXLUG, it seems obvious that most people are a bit 
reactionary and don't take well to having demands placed on them.   I'd 
suggest that these are the counter-points:

1)  We think the issue is trivial.  This aspect will probably never be 
agreed on, so we can simply agree to disagree.

2)  PLUG has no legal right to anything.  Linux is a registered 
trademark of another entity <wink> and there is nothing to claim damages 
about even were it not (there is no money or misrepresentation involved; 
you might think the info about PLUG on pdxlug.org is insufficient, but I 
doubt a judge would agree with you).   But please feel free to waste 
everyone's money on lawyers or your breath on idle threats.

3) The "issue" would have probably gone away long ago if people such as 
yourself would simply approach the other side in a reasonably adult 
fashion and present your request as such and not as a demand.  As far as 
I'm concerned, and I suspect most others involved with PDXLUG, neither 
you nor anyone else in PLUG has any right to demand anything from 
PDXLUG.   As such your demands are bound to have the opposite of the 
intended effect.  The side that you fail to see is that PDXLUG feels 
*you* should "do the right thing" and concentrate on more serious 
issues, like why people find PLUG so annoying (hint).

In short, feel free to open the flamewar all over again if you like.   
I'll be a frequent contributor.  Or you can "do the right thing" and try 
to resolve the issue with Robby and PDXLUG in a respectful and 
considerate fashion.   Please don't bore me with "we've tried that" 
because you haven't.   We can sit here all day and post links to emails 
to prove our points or we can resolve the issue.  But I can assure you 
that any resolution *will* be a compromise and so far you and your 
compatriots haven't seemed willing to accept that.

Regards,
Cliff

I just gotta ask:

If you think it's trivial, why NOT do what Dan asks?

If it's no big deal to you, then making other people happy by changing it
seems like a no-brainer.

If the making other people happy is a painless task, then do it, that's
what I say.

Please know that many of PDXLUG's members have heard this loud and
clear.  I, for one, have gone on record on both group's lists as
advocating greater clarity.  

Please also hear that PDXLUG does not exist to antagonize PLUG, though I
don't blame you for perceiving antagonism in the words and actions of
some members.  In contrast, many (perhaps most) of us keep tabs on both
groups and have no particular bone to pick.

This assertion is both counter-productive and factually suspect.

I agree that providing greater clarity is the *right* thing to do, but
let's be serious about what making broad legal claims does: it makes a
threat.  Making threats (even subtle ones) isn't likely to make anyone
feel like working toward an amicable resolution

Your DBA probably wouldn't prove to be very valuable if it were ever to
be tested in court.  You're free to "claim* whatever you want, but as a
practical matter, it will be quite difficult to convince a court that
you exclusively own the use of a highly generic phrase that was in use
by multiple entities for at least 7 months prior to your registration.

Even if you *had* a claim, the fact that you've taken no legal action
for a year pretty much kills it. When you fail to enforce IP rights, you
cease to have them in any meaningful way.

>From a moral and ethical viewpoint, I respect your opinion, but from a
legal perspective, you don't appear to have a leg to stand on. Please,
let's back away from the legal opinions and stick to the issue at hand:
you're pissed and PDXLUG needs to figure out how to respond to that.

Heard and understood... by me, anyway.

FWIW,

I don't find the usage of the name trivial, I find the problem that 
he/some have to be trivial. There lies the difference.

It'd make many people happy if he dropped it. Why not do the right thing 
and let go? In my opinion that is a no-brainer answer to this issue.

So you see his concern as trivial, but the issue is very important to you.

Got it.

The name means a whole lot to you and it's very important that you keep
using it exactly as it is.

Can you explain why?

It's not trivial to him or many others.  You're the one saying it's a
trivial issue, so I suggested you make the minor effort required to
resolve the trouble.

> Can we agree to disagree?

This is a meaningless proposition (I believe, originally intended as a
kind of absurdist gag in Norton Juster's The Phantom Tollbooth) that does
nothing but continue the status quo and marginalize or trivialize any
attempts to make change.

"Agreeing to disagree" benefits your situation and says to hell with
everyone else.

I don't know about "aggressive".  What I heard was from Dave Mandel,
who reported that everytime he called O'Reilly that O'Reilly had
become confused about which group they were talking about.  Dave has
also reported the incidents with the LUG listings being "hijacked".

PLUG did have a booth at OSCON.  In fact, while I was there we had a
DVD of the Life of Brian playing on Linux.

Do you even read what I write in my emails? Do any of you for that matter?

We are PDXLUG..not PLUG...not Portland Linux Users Group...

...if someone asks me what PDXLUG is? I will respond with, "a Portland 
Linux user group." I may even have an alternate answer should the person 
not be from around here... perhaps, "a Portland, Oregon based Linux user 
group..." but that will be on a case by case basis.

I have already been stated (several times now) that I would do what I 
could to make sure that we continue to refer to us as PDXLUG... not 
PLUG... not Portland Linux User Group.

Is this not what he asked?

The usage of the phrase 'a Portland Linux user group' is not something 
that I will promise to not use should someone prompt me with a question 
similar to the one mentioned above. I will not however make a claim that

Group', unless someone asks what we were beyond the name...meaning, a 
description of some sort.

I agree that we seem to disagree.  That in no way should be seen as

Yes and David and I have discussed those issues off-list in depth. I 
would post his emails to me and my responses, but as those were private 
emails I will respect that privacy..unless he gives me permission to 
discuss those email conversations in public.

Perhaps David would like comment on any of this? Being the owner of the 
DBA and all... I'd like to hear his concerns in public as I have already 
heard them off-list.

There is no money at stake here? (..or is there?)
10 years of investing time and sweat into a mailing list and promoting 
linux is noble... but seriously, if people want to point fingers at 
people who seek vanity...you don't have to look far.

I can assure you..that if your 10 years of hard work is compromised by 
the startup of a new group who you claim is purposely confusing people, 
than you have some insecurities that you need to tend to. PDXLUG is not 
the boogie man.

I consider that speculation on your part.  I have reason to think we
do.

The "including a trademark" in the name is a specious argument.
Unless and until Linus asks us and every other LUG to stop using it, I
think we are on safe ground there.

I don't think it is necessary to guess about motives.  I think it is

No, I think that he meant that PLUG has been around for 10 years.

PDXLUG has just turned 1 as of a week or so ago. Happy Birthday and 
congrats to both!

Have you looked at LinNeighborhood? It's not integrated, but it's easy

=)   Sheesh, I've been outed.

Still I have enough sense to know I can't register and successfully 
defend a name like "Portland Nike Shoe Store" which is what you're 
suggesting PLUG would be able to do with the Linux trademark.   Unless 
Linus says otherwise, user groups are free to use it.   Nevertheless, I 
doubt he's going to give up any rights on the name to further PLUG's cause.

Hmm.  How about email?  Include a key somewhere in the message to use
in filtering out the inevitable junk (or go the full-blown PGP/GPG
route), have procmail (or equivalent) check the key and plop the
content in the right spot.

Dan,

PDXLUG has acknowledged the concerns of some members of PLUG (..again) 
and we will discuss this and figure out how we will respond to your 
issue, for the sake of ending this petty dispute...in a way that 
benefits both groups. The changes that have already been brought up by 
me in the PDXLUG lists will be step one..and we will look into other 
ways of clearing up some of the issues.

However, the fact remains that you decided to open up the debate in 
response to a post where I mentioned the word 'PDXLUG' rather than 
'Portland Linux Users Group' will this be something that happens in the 
future as well?

These series of threads started when I pointed out a resource that 
existed when someone suggested the idea of a lending library. If this is 
how PLUG will respond to such responses to emails, perhaps it would be 
wise of I to not contribute to discussions as if this is how you will 
typically respond (Mr. Haskell) than how is PLUG helping the community 
with that sort of follow-up?

-Robby

Are you saying, then, that a company could not have a trademark like
"Red Hat Linux" or "Jim Fischer Volvo"?

Point taken.   However, how do you suppose a judge would respond if "The 
Beaverton Honda Dealers" sued "Jon Doe, a Beaverton Honda Dealer"?

Thanks, Geoff.  Did you catch that the <i> tag starting on line two of the
update doesn't terminate properly?

I meant to write about that at the time, but it slipped my mind.

It not terribly clear, especially since "Dealer" is capitalized, which
makes it seem like it's part of a title and perhaps suggests an
abbreviated form of "Jon Doe, a member of the Beaverton Honda Dealers". 
It would probably be open to the decision of the judge.  If Jon Doe had
wished to avoid all confusion, he could have chosen "Jon Doe, a Honda
dealer in Beaverton".

I'm basically agnostic about the PLUG/PDXLUG conflict, I don't
have any stake in it.  but that statement bothers me a lot more
than anything anyone else I saw.  it's dismissive in a specific
way that rejects any argument other than attacks on your
character.  do you know you're doing this?

"Can we agree to disagree?" is pretty bizarre too.  why do you
think that would be an acceptable answer to anybody but you?

I'm not sure if this has been thrown out as I only read 42% of the
messages on this topic, but from this website:

http://www.planetargon.com/index.php?Pyramid=Projects

... reads the following:


"Portland Linux User Group (PDXLUG)

Planet Argon has volunteered development time and resources to help start
up the new Portland Linux User Group. PDXLUG was established to continue
to educate and advocate the community on how Linux is a viable
alternative to various operating systems.

Planet Argon designed the initial web design for PDXLUG.

Portland Linux User Group"


Even with PDXLUG mentioned specifically, this could be misinterpreted.

There is usually a direct correlation between the way Dan is treated and
the way Dan responds. Application of that simple rule will tell you what
is going to happen in the future.

And this I think would end up being the crux: the case is *not* clear
cut.  Combine that with the fact that there is little, if anything, that
could be claimed as damages, I doubt a judge would even be willing to
hear the case.  Even if it were heard, the text from the front page of
pdxlug.org makes a *very* clear distinction and goes out of it's way to
send readers to pdxlinux.org if plug is what they're looking for which
would probably satisfy any court.  Now you've set the stage for a
judgement against the plaintiff (and if pdxlug counter-sued, plug might
end up footing pdxlug's legal fees to boot).

But then, as has been pointed out, IANAL, so I think perhaps PLUG should
have at it.

Regards,
Cliff

When I've seen that in the past, it's when some mail servers (or clients?)
use = as a line separator and =3D to indicate actual = in the body.

Don't remember when I saw that, though.

There's a problem with the MIME-conversion going from Mailman into NNTP
or within slrn; the '=3D' is actually an escaped equals; the '=0D' is
actually a literal newline character (CTRL-V Enter lets you insert it). 
Vim lets you use '<cr>' instead of having to insert a literal control
character.

Dan is treated like an idiot so he acts like one?  Even down to
referring to himself in the third person?  Is there a medical term for
this condition?

Okay, I'm sorry.  You're just such an easy target.  Try not to take

You might want to consider implementing my solution to the virus
problem, it's a bit more successful.  Many ISPs are a bit more
concerned about abuse that isn't victim-preventable.

http://spamcop.net/ is good for actual spam (viruses aren't spam, but
they're not wanted, either).

Yeah, probably the handiest way unless you're comfortable with using
smbclient by hand and don't use KDE.

Paul, if you keep being reasonable I'm going to feel guilty and be
forced to quit baiting them.

And right when I was having a good time, too  :P

Nautilus is capable of SMB browsing as well.  I don't have any SMB
shares lying around, so I can't test, but I've used it in the past.

Perhaps this thread will shed some light:

Dunno about "recommended", but if you control the server you are
pushing to, you could use "scponly"[1]. It allows you to scp to a
target account without the account needing shell access. So, e.g., you
set up an account called, say, "mover", set it up with the allowed RSA
id's, set its shell to scponly, and then from your client station, you
just do "scp *.html mover at server:public_html/" like normal. Getting
the framework securely locked down requires attention to detail, but
you get the gist.

To clarify, comparisons to Mussolini are considered in bad taste. 
Presented as the cheerio in a bowl of sarcasm it tastes even worse.  Not
that I really minded, but hey, you asked =)

You'll have to be more specific.

Nothing insulting or discourteous that I can see.

You're the one with the gripe, you gotta show me where it is.

I don't think that's what Paul meant.  And I don't think that comment was
either insulting or discourteous.  There is no denying the analogy of the
two situations.

There was no sarcasm.

And if you weren't insulted, it DEFINITELY wasn't an insult (though you've
brought it about like seven times, so I think maybe you did mind).

It works, though.  The needless attitude and sarcasm upthread is a bit
bitter, too.  Though I'm impressed that you can't remember something
that happened today.

Again, spare me the disengenuousness.  Either it was sarcasm or you
can't form a sentence properly. Judging from your other posts I
seriously doubt it was the latter.  But feel free to claim it if you
like.

No, I just find it hilarious that you keep putting on the innocent act
when it's so transparent.  I actually gained some respect for you since
you are obviously capable of carrying on an argument.  However, if
you're going to insult, please own up to it.  I'm certainly not afraid
to confess that I was intentionally being an asshole, so why don't you
stick out your chest and try accepting responsibility for a change?  *I*
certainly wouldn't think less of you for it.

Incidentally, on a less inflammatory note, I was composing a reply in
regard to our private discussion which I'll have to get to you tomorrow
as it's sitting on screen at work :P  Your patience is appreciated.

Regards,
Cliff

Well, I'm impressed that you can't come up with one example on your own.

I think you have a "general impression", but there's nothing at all to
back it up because it's based entirely on preconceived notions and not on
anything that actually happened.

I lurk on this list, although I have posted from time to time.

I see a degeneration of the list, I am not sure why people insist on
embarrassing themselves in a public forum.

Can you people not get on topic? Is this not a LUG list? Lose the egos
and let us get back to Linux topics. I don't care to read about your
opinions, and I am sure there are others that back me............. 

Let's hear about Linux related topics......

So I changed /etc/syslog.conf to this.

Question is ??

What am I doing wrong??
Shouldn't that stop cron logging in auth.log??

I am missing something here..

Red Hat, the company, is  Red Hat, Inc not Red Hat Linux. Jim Fisher
Volvo may indeed be Jim Fisher Volvo, but I will bet there is a specific
agreement about the use of Volvo in the name, and both parties signed on
the dotted line. 

The simple question is did Linus approve using Linux in the DBA?

Well, the fact of the matter is that certain parties are using their
status in the group as leverage in gaining business for their firm(s). 
I personally don't find much wrong with that aspect of it, and in fact
consider it fairly reasonable.   People often use membership in clubs as
a reference.  However, much of the concern over the name of PDXLUG
arises from a fear that confusion among potential *customers* might
arise, *not* potential LUG users as has been so vehemently claimed. 
Therefore these individuals have instrumented much of the current heated
battle in an attempt to quell PDXLUG or at least make it a non-entity in
the LUG realm.  This I *do* have a problem with.  Further, I find it
repulsive that these persons would manipulate others into doing their
dirty work under the guise of protecting the community when really all
they are doing is protecting their income.  But then again, it rings of
the finest of American corporate manipulation.  I just expected better
of people with standing (however limited) in the OSS community.

As a side note, I am not aware that any of the active participants in
this argument in the last couple of days are directly involved in this,
and despite what I might think of their intelligence, I have refrained
from making accusations of such.  They may or may not be involved, but I
haven't seen any evidence to support that notion, aside from their own
inexplicable concern over the name.  I am more inclined to believe that
they are simple puppets in the matter (emphasis on simple).  However, I
have seen *proof* of other's doings but am currently forced to withhold
that person's name out of respect for the source of the information.

Cliff

just being within the sight of such giants as those have posted these
last days. Could I possibly put into words, simple words of course, how
with trepidation I read these testaments to pure intellect? These
arguments, on both sides of the issue, are so beyond me and my simple
ways, as to leave me unable to find a true path and envy those on both
sides, that are so sure of righteousness. 

It is such waste that these superior beings are not solving the other
great issues of our time. I can see peace in Northern Ireland, peace in
the Middle East, peace in Africa,... if they were to only show the world
their enlightened ways. I need to spread the word, Gandhi was not
reincarnated once, but multiple times and posts to these unworthy lists.

Thank you

I am and I may, despite your own claimed disinterest.  The simple fact
is is that I am going to try to convince the person tomorrow to allow me
to post such info.  But truthfully, it would take about 5 minutes of
thought/research for anyone who's been following this discussion to put
it together.

Not at all.  The fact that you were at least interested in someone
holding a DBA on PLUG separates you from the rest.  My reply was to you
but my barbs were aimed elsewhere.  Please reread my post and you'll see
that I wasn't referring to you at all.  If I've insulted your
intelligence earlier in this thread then I'll go ahead and apologise
now.

I'll skip addressing the rest of your post as it doesn't seem relevant.

I think some of the people who do get commercial contacts through their
association with PLUG are concerned about continuing those contacts with
the confusion, but there are plenty of us that have no business interest
in PLUG that are just as concerned about the confusion and how this whole
mess is making all of us look.

Again, just because some people are concerned about business contacts
getting confused doesn't mean that's the only reason to try and avoid
confusion.


I'm also going to go ahead and point out here that a DBA has
non-commercial purposes.  A DBA is simply a registered legal entity that
is not a person.  A DBA allows, for example, items to be granted or loaned
to PLUG without being granted or loaned to a particular individual.

So, the existence of a DBA does not imply that a person is doing
_commercial_ business as PLUG, just public business.

We agreed on something?!  It must have been an accident.

Understandable.  In fact, I pointed that out very early on in this
discussion.  I strongly suspect that this thread (in its many
incarnations over the last several months) has done far more damage to
PLUG than some potential naming confusion ever will.

This may be true.  Given the existing situation it is very difficult to
tell.  I will say that you are the only one so far to give any sort of
legitimate argument (a purported concern over how PDXLUG is run and a
desire to distance yourself from that) on the topic, whether I
completely agree with you or not.  If you've noticed, most everyone else
who has expressed concern has simply skirted the issue as much as
possible.  Nevertheless, I suspect that much of your information
regarding PDXLUG has in fact come from individuals, either directly or
indirectly, who have commercial interests in seeing PDXLUG go away. 
You'll have to decide that for yourself since I'm not privy to that
information.

True, and on it's own it might be cause for complaint, but certainly not
the sort of accusations I've forwarded tonight.  But combined with a
stated admission from the person in question it takes on a different
light.  In fact, each on its own isn't really much to get worked up
about, but together they make for an interesting perspective.

Cliff

Strictly speaking the comparison between the administration of the group

personal attack.

I'm not too sure how long you've been lurking here but if you look at 
the archives for the last year you'll see that bloody flame wars like 
this dominate PLUG. I'm not going to start a bang-fest on PLUGs culture 
(the folks here like it this way and that's fine) but you do have to 
realize that the noise level here is very high. If your looking for 
technical lists I have a few that are very good at staying on topic, 
feel free to contact me off list.

A friend from college who is now a judge referred me to an attorney, in

I have copied him on this and I'll forward his name to you privately.

You'd think so, eh?

> I am missing something here..

The log lines in question *aren't* coming from cron, they're coming
from pam_unix.so and they're coming at authpriv.info, not cron.*.  The
following may work (untested):

authpriv.!info;auth,authpriv.*   /var/log/auth.log

Although this may lose information in other ways.

What you should do is use a program like logcheck to filter and send
you email of suspicious log entries. Then you can tweak the filters
with regex's to get rid of this stuff on a more fine-grained level.

but... earlier you admitted to deliberately adding fuel to the
flamewar and prolonging the thread.  does this mean you admit to
deliberately harming PLUG?

I think the thread is pretty harmless, so it doesn't particularly
bother me.  but you seem to be inconsistent here.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0401210626330.12791@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I read messages posted to this list that express concern, dislike even,
for the too low signal:noise ratio. It occurs to me why we see this and I
share my reason for seeing what we do.

  Too many exchanges that should be private (i.e., person-to-person) are
posted to the list instead. A benign example is Keith's request of last
evening for a contract attorney reference. Three responses to his request
went to the list rather than directly to him. Why? If others want to know
they can ask Keith by direct e-mail what names he's received.

  I equate this public exposure of private conversations to the clueless
masses who conduct what should be private telephone conversations all too
publicly on their cell phones. They walk retail store aisles chatting away
and do not care that others overhear their half of the conversation. More
importantly, they don't care that we just do not want to hear their
conversations and that it's intrusive on our privacy.

  Please think about this when a question is posted to the list and you
respond to it. Many times the answer would be of general interest and should
be captured in the list archives. Too often that is not the case.

Thanks,

Rich

  AAARRRGGHHH! I intended this to go directly to Keith as it was not
appropriate to send to the list.

  In light of my musings just posted I offer most sincere apologies to the
list readers for not being sufficiently careful that my response selection
was correct before hitting the [Enter] key.

Darn!

You do realize that you've just initiated the time-worn Reply-To:
debate. Again. :-)

BTW-Threaded mail makes this all soooo much better. I come in and
there's 43 (honestly!) new messages on PLUG vs PLUG over the past hour
(in this example)--they're all in one thread, so I just hit "M-d $ y"
in mutt and the entire batch of that thread is gone. No fuss, no muss.

In pine, it's "$h/d" :-) Verbosely:

  $ -- sort
  h -- by thread
  / -- collapse thread
  d -- mark as deleted

You can always have pine use threads as the default sorting mechanism
as well, though I prefer arrival time.

Not at all.  I'm quite aware that PLUG consists of a large and mostly
reasonably crowd of people who are here because they share a common
interest in an operating system.  I think I've clearly stated my
intention here, which is to get a small but vocal minority to shut up
about something that doesn't really affect PLUG as a whole, only their
own interests.  Early in my postings (and after this thread was at least
a day old all on its own [and simply a rehash of earlier threads on both
lists]) I pointed out the inconsistency of the claims of those who said
that they were concerned that PDXLUG was damaging PLUG in some
ill-defined fashion while they themselves were demonstrably damaging it
themselves (via the announcements of people abandoning the list).  I
don't really care one way or the other about PLUG, but I was under the
(apparently mistaken) impression that they did.

Fair enough.  Hopefully this clears it up for you.

When the administration of the group has been previously attributed to
one person it most certainly is.  That's like saying I'm not insulting
you, only the people responsible for your post.

Again, insults are cheap so feel free to use them (not you,
specifically, but in general).  All I ask is that people not pretend
they haven't already sunk to that level.  I find that cowardly and
deceitful which is a far worse trait than losing your temper or simply
running out of good words ;-)

But of course Jeme was guilty of one post that could be construed as a
personal attack, while you on the other hand have engaged in numerous
personal attacks. One post might be a momentary lapse, or a mistake in
expression, multiple  and repeated insults and personal attacks directed
at individuals, named and alluded to, are a little more difficult to
defend.

Then I suppose you disagree with the axiom "if a = b and b = c then a = 
c".   At this point what you agree with or disagree with becomes moot 
since your ability to reason becomes highly suspect.   Sheesh.  And 
people here wonder why I question their intelligence.   Two words for 
you: remedial algebra.   Let me make it clear:

Claim 1:  PDXLUG is run by Matt King (a = b)
Claim 2:  PDXLUG is run by fascists (b = c)
Therefore,  Matt King is a fascist. (a = c)

Well, herein lies the difference between myself and a few of the other 
people who've engaged in this argument: I am not defending my actions, 
at least not in the sense of denying that I've made several personal 
attacks on individuals whom I felt richly deserved them.  You, and a few 
others seem to feel you can gain the upper hand by making insiduous and 
insulting remarks and then denying them a few posts later or claiming 
that they weren't really insults.   As I told Jeme, this is insulting to 
both the people who have read the remarks and as well as the people who 
made the remarks, since you apparently assume that a) people here are 
too dense to see the meaning in these statements b) have severe 
short-term memory loss or c) the people making the remarks are simply 
too ignorant to understand what they've just said.  As I mentioned, if 
you want to claim the latter, please do so publicly and I'll forget 
about it.

Actually, they were perfectly consistent.  Perhaps you should read them

No you're not sorry. You're just a clueless troll, doing what clueless

We've recently switched from doing our dial-up ourselves to out-sourcing
it, and now have nation-wide access numbers, including ones in Bend:

You're right.  I'm not sorry.  I was being sarcastic and thought it was 
obvious.  It's rather sad to finally see you correct about something and 
still appear a bit dull at the same time.   Why don't you just give 
up?   All I want to hear is that you are done slandering PDXLUG in 
public and I'll cease and go back under my bridge.   Have you noticed 
that I only *respond* to posts, that I never start new threads?   Is 
that enough of a clue-by-four for you?   Really, this conversation is 
entirely in your hands.   I would be delighted to get some other work 
done and leave you in peace.

*Yawn*.  I've stated publicly that I do not represent PDXLUG.  There 
may, in fact, be things wrong with PDXLUG.   That is irrelevant and 
frankly none of your business as you aren't a member.  The fact that I 
happen to have a couple of friends in that group who have been publicly 
attacked on this list by you and your ilk is the source of my ire.

Anyway, I've offered terms on which we can part ways, but you apparently 
either don't understand them or simply let stubbornness get the better 
of you.   Feel free to continue this thread and I'll feel free to 
ridicule you.   Alternatively, mail me three labels from a medication 
that prove your mental incontinence is organic and I'll refrain from 
picking on you.

G'day,

Cliff

While I am completely with you on the trollness of Cliff, and the fact
that the founding and nameing of PDXLUG has confused things, and it is
my personal opinion that this was intentional to at least some extent. 
There are many people who participate in PDXLUG who are intelligent and
honest.  I think this fact should not be lost and we should not allow
our feeling for the actions of some make up forget that.

As to whether it was the intent of PDXLUG's founders to confuse the
issue, it is never possible to see into the soul of another, I think
statments made at the time support my view. I also think, that if their
intent was to form an alternative to PLUG, they would have chosen a name
that was not so easly confused with PLUG.  I believe that they hoped and
expected that the majority of peopl ewould flock to their organization
and that PLUG would disapear.  Since this has not happened it has become
necessary to revise history and to change the stated goals of the group.

As I say this is my opinion based on my interpretation of events and
there are certainly a number of interpretations of those events, these
are just mine.  

disclaimer: I have no personal stake in PLUG or PDXLUG I am a member of
PLUG, I have attened 2 or three meetings and a handfull of saturday
clinics. I do not recall meeting any of the players nor know their faces
other than Dave and have probably done more harm than good to any
prospects of financial gain form PLUG by my participation in this
donnybrook.  I just find trolls annoying.

BTW as far as I am concerned the names of the groups are PLUG and
PDXLUG, because that is what I call them.  The portland Maine Linux
users group is not PLUG, but the one in Perth is :P

Doh! There is something wrong with "worong".

Congratulations on grafting two metaphors together in such a 
Frankensteinian fashion.  But we'll  burn that bridge when we come to 
it  <wink>.

Anyway, despite your mangling of two fairly common idioms, I see the 
point you struggled to make and even agree, which is why I've assessed 
many of the people in this discussion as somewhat less than brilliant. 

Oh wait, those were just words.   I'm sorry... which part of this 
discussion wasn't words?  I must have missed the "actions" part.  
Perhaps the duck took it.

as it's a little late for that, don't you agree?

Absolutely. I know a dozen or so people who have participated in their
list and they are all bright individuals. My intention was to remind Cliff
that his behavior reflects on his group.

The issue of financial gain from PLUG has been overblown by those wishing
to to use it for political gain. Dave has been running PLUG for ~9 years
and you can bet it hasn't made him a rich man. He registered the DBAs to
protect the group's assets. We can talk about this at the next general
meeting if anyone has questions.

I've noticed the same thing.  I suspect it's because of updates made to
the distribution after pressing the in-box CDs.  Alas, I just nuked my
collection of RH 8 ISOs or I'd give you the MD5sums from each version.

It sounds like you may have a throughput issue.  24x is pretty damn fast,
and you might be pushing the limits of your hardware, drivers, OS, or
media at that speed.  "DAO" may be reducing your speed to where you're
able to cope better.

I'd suggest trying the same thing at 8x and see if it helps.  The cdrecord

ah, it's phrased oddly.  I interpreted the last sentence as "too
often, the answer isn't archived and should be" rather than the
opposite.

probably because I tend to feel not enough is public.  Rich
proposes that people can answer a question privately, and anyone
else who wants to know can send email to ask for the answers too.
this doesn't really work well in the general case.  there are
many reasons this can fail to get a timely answer, or any answer
at all.  it's simpler if questions and answers are both just
automatically archived and indexed.

one common workaround is "respond to me privately, and I'll
summarize".

As does your own, but we all knew that anyway.   I'm inclined to see 
your sudden switch to reasonableness as yet another ploy to make your 
arguments seem to carry more weight than they really do,  nevertheless, 
I'm game.  If you want to speak reasonably,  I'm certainly willing to 
give you the benefit of the doubt and try again.  As usual, the tone is 
up to you.  If you speak rationally, I'll reply in kind.  If you sink to 
bitching and insinuations, I'll resort to ridicule.

The issue of financial gain aside, I'd suggest that you extend the same 
benefit of doubt you are so willing to confer on Dave to Matt and 
Robby.  All you really have to draw a conclusion from regarding their 
motivations is what they've stated publicly.   Anything else is mere 
conjecture.

Well, although he pointedly avoided mentioning it directly, it seemed

Excellent idea!  I hadn't even considered the immense powers of

This one would be perfect.  The problem is that it's some non-computer
people (artists no less... the worst kind of user [grin]) who want to
do the updating.  So, I'm worried about their ability to correctly 
install and operate scp.

I'm going to give both of these a shot.

Thanks!

Message-ID: <1074722756.769.90.camel@kokopelli>

The problem with taking it off list, is that it leaves ones opponent
with the last public word on the matter, unchallenged.  This is
especially difficult when one feels they have been maligned in some way.
But of course, this a meta discussion and simply adds to the OT chatter,
as do pleas by the uninvolved. (Note, pleas by the uninvolved to the
combatantsto, "get a room" etc... should be in private email not sent to
the entire list further reducing the signal to noise).

Steve, I'm pretty sure it's the -dao option.  I burned one yarrow-i386-disc1.iso
with -dao and one without.  The one with -dao exhibited no problems.  I can't be
completely sure, but the bad one was burned at speed=12 and the good one was
 burned at speed=24.  Also keep in mind even the 'bad' one was accurate at the
file level.  It passed the disk check during the Fedora update and the mount
 and diff test.

I'm attempting to get CUPS working on a update of RH8 by Fedora Core 1.
Let's call the computers A and Z. A is running RH8 and Z is running
Fedora. CUPS is installed on A and works.  My first attempt on Z didn't
work.  In a debugging effort, I attempted to access SWAT on A using a

Does this suggest a solution?

Indeed.  CUPS by default (on RH/Fdr at least) will only accept
connections from localhost.  Edit the /etc/cups/cupsd.conf file and
permit access from your local IP network.  (And "swat" is the Samba web
tool; I don't know if CUPS has a name for their web-admin tool.)

Several drag and drop versions of scp exist for those other operating 
systems, you might take a look at those too.

You're the only one to call anybody a fascist, just so's you know.
Mousilini was fascist, certainly, but my comparison was to his
totalitarianism, not his fascism.  (While it is basically true that all
fascists are totalitarian, not all totalitarians are fascists.)  That's a
bit like saying that, since I compared him to Mousilini, I'm implying that
Matt is bald.

That aside, let's just substitute "totalitarian" for "fascist" in your
above syllogism and we have a fairly accurate statement.

The question remains, is that an insult?  I don't think so.  It's a
description of his (apparently) prefered organization style.  That's just
the english word for that style of management.  It's not an insult.

It's actually not at all irrelevant.  If there are "things wrong" with
PDXLUG, then stating them would not be slanderous (or libelous, if
written).

[And the question of "membership" in PDXLUG is still wide open.  What does
that mean?  Is it subscription to the mailing list?  If so, then the
totalitarianism of the regime is absolute because, as has been admitted,
Matt's word is the only one that matters on that issue.  There was an
earlier claim that the mailing list wasn't the end-all, be-all of PDXLUG,
so it's difficult to say whether Dan is a "member" because we haven't had
a clear explanation of what that means.  He certainly attempted membership
at one point.]

Subject: [PLUG] SCSI errors and growing my RAID5 array
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.52.0401211620130.17290@shaft.bitmine.net>

Two things:

First, trying to format a disk on my SCSI backplane... the disk is
identical to all the others on the plane.  I get the following error when
I attempt to write to the partition table:

Jan 21 16:21:27 loyale kernel: SCSI disk error : host 1 channel 0 id 1 lun
0 return code = 8000002
Jan 21 16:21:27 loyale kernel: Current sd08:10: sense key Aborted Command
Jan 21 16:21:27 loyale kernel: Additional sense indicates Scsi parity error
Jan 21 16:21:27 loyale kernel:  I/O error: dev 08:10, sector 0

Is it a bad disk?  I'm not much on heavy hardware stuff.  Galen?

Second, I realized that I left one of the partitions out of the creation
of my RAID5 array (and I'd like to add this disk to the array when/if it
works, too).  Is that possible without tearing down the array?  It's
reiserfs.

Thanks.

Email is stored in a fixed medium and is, for the purpose of this kind of

PDXLUG is not run by Matt. I overthrew him earlier.(..ok not exactly)

We are now (well, actually for the most part already were) an open 
group... and the two people who were moderated are no longer moderated. 
There are multiple moderators on each of our lists now. (Ken Brush and I 
moderate the main one)

We are also working on fixing the naming issue as to give you something 
else to complain about...like how you are going to keep people from 
joining our group as we plan to steal each of your members slowly by 
confusing them with on-topic posts and the lack of a DBA. David, you 
still never responded to my inquiry in the threads.

The truth is... PLUG consists of some immature old people..and PDXLUG is 
the new young blood in town. Even David Mandel has told me off-list that 
he feels that PDXLUG is perfect for newbies as our list stays on topics 
and doesn't throw the flame smack down on newbies when they ask if they 
should use redhat or mandrake. Newbies, youngsters and energetic 
old-farts are welcome.

You can subscribe here:
   http://pdxlug.org/mailman/listinfo/pdxlug

PDXLUG, the other linux user group in town.
http://www.pdxlug.org/
"pdxlug, the not-for-profit linux user group"

If you're curious as to whether we are the evil group that people like 
Jeme like to claim... then come and decide for yourself. Don't let 
people like Jeme tell you what is fact and fiction. Intelligent-sounding 
propaganda is still propaganda.

PDXLUG was created with the sole intention of having a local alternative 
to existing LUGs. We encourage more LUGs as each LUG has it's own way of 
helping promote Linux in the community and that is the ultimate goal for 
all LUGs, correct? (well and to complain about M$ ;-) )

Come get a free webmail account as well! yourname at pdxlug.org. With 
PDXLUG 2.0, the trains will run on time.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0401211654480.30663-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I still have some testing to do but for some reason I can't boot from my 
brand new Sony DRU-510a DVD/CD, RW, +-.  I think I did once a week or so 
ago but can't remember as I've been testing distributions when I have a 
spare 20-30 minutes at home.  (Damn!  Getting old makes this stuff tough. 
:-)

So the question is has anyone booted from the 510?  Have you had problems
doing it?  I put the old CDROM-RW back in (old as 3 months) this AM and it
booted just fine (just in case I had screwed up a setting on the MB).

This seemed to happen after I had a less-than-ideal Slackware install (my 
fault) when I let GRUB be install in the root/boot partition instead of 
the master boot record.


TIA,
Rod

Oops about swat.

I can print to this server from another computer.  I think it's using
lpr though.

I need very specific help.  The cupsd.conf file seems to contradict
itself.  It says broadcast is on, but it is also commented out.

This shouldn't be this hard!

I should add that printer config tool(start:system settings:printing)
does _not_ show the printer.

You'll have to be more specific.  If there is a bit commented out that
says it's "on", then it's probably not on.  But you knew that.

Can you share the seemingly contradictory bits?

Cups can be a little confusing.

Message-ID: <400EFCCB.2090104@adnap.no-ip.com>

I'm finally taking the plunge and abandoning windows on my desktop. I 
have decided on Evolution for my mail because it seems to have the 
greatest support for my Palm. Now I'm looking for how to import my mail 
from Mozilla on windows to evolution. I have discovered the manual route 
(open every mbox file and import it separately), but I am looking for a 
better way.

If anyone has another mail client to recommend, I'm open to suggestions. 
It would be really cool if it had a mail conduit for the Palm. (my Palm 
is a IIIxe running OS 3.5)

Thank you,
Evan

Might also try rsync tunnelled under ssh. Here's a link to a sample

WinSCP (http://winscp.sourceforge.net/) is an excellent graphical 
SCP/SFTP client for Windows.  Open source, integrates well with Explorer.

Ok.. I give up..

I don't care about the financial gain of people involved in PLUG, good
for them for making something out of it, I do care that PLUG is now a
business. Why can't we discuss this here?

I have a filter set up to move messages from the plug mailing list into
their own folder. Go to the folder, click on date to sort by date, then
click on subject to sort by subject.  Wah-Lah, you have them sorted by
both.  Then just start at one end of the subject and use the arrow keys
and delete key.  Or select a bunch by shift-arrow-key and then delete!

At the beginning of this garbage thread someone questioned why I choose 
to use an alias in public list groups like this one. I think now you all 
have that answer but for those that are still seeking clarity, ask 
yourself if you really want your email address associated with 
individuals that are willing stoop this low for attention.

Oh yeah Jeme, your drive is probably dead. Normally seek to track 0

While I stuck working this temporary contract in the waste lands of

system.  I'd like to hang the printer off the BSD system and send print
jobs over the network form my laptop.  I installed the LPRng package but
can't seem to get it to accept print jobs.  So any clues would be

I am worried about the stupid issues, if someone where speak
inappropriately, think about what can land you in HR at work, in this
public forum and it upsets someone, can we be sued? Someone gets hurt at
a Clinic, are we liable, someone fails down at a meeting, someone gets
drunk at the after the meeting thing at the Lucky Lab and is involved
in an accident ...

With no real structure to PLUG, I also want to understand my exposure to
these types of issues. 

Thank you

He's anything but a raving lunatic. Darl and his cronies know full well
that their carefully crafted deceptions will likely fall on fertile
ground, given that the majority of their audience is either A) almost
entirely ignorant of the technology world in general, and the 'nix family
tree in particular; or B), fully complicit in the intellectual monopoly
racket.

Darl plays lord to one of many extremely profitable fiefdoms, and is
rightly petrified at the prospect of the vassals being freed of their
dependence upon his largesse (if you can even call it that). His actions
are perfectly rational, even if he does remain a lying, greedy bastard.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0401212058290.16508-100000@sco302.DavidMandel.com>

A couple people have asked me about my lack of response to some recent
postings on the PLUG list, and I'm told that I haven't responded to
a couple people who have asked me questions.  I'm sorry, but:

    -  I have been working 16 hour days and haven't had time to
       do much of anything.  (However, I feel very lucky to be working.)

    -  I have been reading many of the postings.  I'm afraid I don't
       have time to read all of them.  I haven't responded in part
       because, I don't feel I can contribute much to the discussion
       without fanning the flames; and I don't want to do this.

    -  However, at some point I will write a couple notes to clarify
       important issues for the group.  These include:

           (1)  A promise to donate all revelant DBAs, domain names,
                bank accounts, etc to PLUG should PLUG ever
                incorporate and seek tax exempt non-profit status.
                (This has always been my intention, but I should
                probably formalize the promise and make it public.)

           (2)  An explanation of reasons PLUG protects it's name
                (or at least attempts to protect it's name).
                (And PLEASE don't post a response to this statement
                until you read the explanation.  If you must post
                a response, send it to me personally.  Please, don't
                clutter the plug list further.)

       Oh yes, once I write these notes I will probably post them on
       PLUG-talk or possibly on the pdxLinux.org web page.  I don't
       intend to post these notes to the main PLUG list.

Finally, I hope I haven't hurt anyone's feelings by not responding.
I know I've missed some important messages.  If you want to talk
to me, feel free to call me this weekend.  Call my cell phone
at 541-730-5285.  I will carry it with me and I have lots of weekend
minutes.

                                          Sincerely,

You're the only one to call anybody a fascist, just so's you
know.
Mousilini was fascist, certainly, but my comparison was to
his
totalitarianism, not his fascism.  (While it is basically
true that all
fascists are totalitarian, not all totalitarians are
fascists.)  That's a
bit like saying that, since I compared him to Mousilini, I'm
implying that
Matt is bald.

That aside, let's just substitute "totalitarian" for
"fascist" in your
above syllogism and we have a fairly accurate statement.

The question remains, is that an insult?  I don't think so.
It's a
description of his (apparently) prefered organization style.
That's just
the english word for that style of management.  It's not an
insult.

When dealing with "lpd" or "LPRng" I've believe I usually have to add 
the client to the /etc/hosts.equiv file on the print server to allow 
access to printing. I admit I'm a bit out of practice now with LPRng as 
I use CUPS on my Linux workstation to print to my remote BSD print 
server.

When I fist started reading the pdf, I thought this must be some kind of
parody or sham!  It is just so totally misrepresentative of the Open
Source movement.  People who develop software and give of their time and
intellect and donate it to the world for free are doing it out of
altruism for the betterment of society in much the same way that people
give blood in one country to help quake victims in another.  All we ask
is that nobody in the delivery chain sells the "blood" we have donated!

Another analogy (closer to the "intellectual property" arena) is
Representative Democracy.  Nobody owns the blueprint for it.  The US has
done a pretty good job of implementing it, and is trying to export it to
every country in the world not only so the rest of the world is better
off, but so that we too will be better off when they have it.  It would
be unAmerican to claim we invented it, and to sue other countries who
try to implement it.

Alas, too many of the older generation just don't have clue about it,
and too many competitor companies see it as a threat to their business.

they're different types of damage.  anyone can care about one
type but not another without being particularly inconsistent.
though I think most of the people who do care dropped out early
from the flame war.  the bulk of it was you and Jeme, and the
announced unsubscriptions happened after you two were going at it
for a while.

Jeme is pretty predictable in his allegiance to cyber-anarchy.
I'm not sure PLUG as a whole is committed to cyber-anarchy, but
if the people who control the infrastructure are, then the group
will tend to self-select for people who value it or are willing
to tolerate it.  to cyber-anarchists, unsubscriptions are not
damage, they're expected, and the people who leave are those who
aren't compatible with cyber-anarchy ideals, which is fine.

"unfair competition" is not ill-defined damage.  the law's been
around since the 60s.  in trademark infringement, intent is
irrelevant.  what matters is whether people may be confused or
not.

I'm not advocating legal action, by the way.  this is just to
point out that there's precedent for a particular method for
resolving this type of dispute, and if a law's been around for a
while, it's possible that people generally feel the principles
behind it are sensible.  domain registrars have similar
resolution methods.

the issue is not the name "PDXLUG", it's the use of the phrase
"Portland Linux User Group", which I would naturally abbreviate
as "PLUG", which seems like reasonable grounds for confusion, and
there may be concrete evidence of specific cases of confusion.

for your example about the "The Beaverton Honda Dealers", I think
Wil was focusing on the wrong thing, which was something like
whether the phrase seems too generic for a trademark to be valid.
it doesn't matter how the phrase seems.  what matters is how it's
being used.  if there were a long-established company called
that, with an ad campaign and brand recognition and such, I think
a judge would rule in favor of them, since that's the intent of
the unfair competition law.

one example that I thought of: the phrase "Girl Scouts" is pretty
generic, but it's commonly understood to refer to one particular
entity, and I suspect someone who tries to sell their own brand
of "Girl Scout Cookies" would lose a lawsuit.  I'd have to go
digging into case law to be sure, and I'm not going to go do
that.  I'm also unclear how the UCC affects any of this.  my
curiosity about intellectual property laws happened a few years
before UCC took effect, and I haven't paid much attention since
then.

I gather PDXLUG has been phasing out the use of the phrase
"Portland Linux User Group", but it looks like it's been
happening in a slow and inconsistent manner, perhaps because the
PDXLUG people don't feel it's an important issue.

it's not an important issue to me either, but I can see why
people would care, and I think it's generally a good idea to
listen to that, because volunteer work is often done by people
who feel passionate about what they do.  it's natural for people
to become emotionally attached to their pet projects.  telling
them they shouldn't care so much is usually counter-productive.

I didn't sort through the profit/nonprofit thing, but it doesn't
particularly bother me if people claim PLUG as a merit badge.
saying "I helped make that happen" is normal pride.  everyone has
their own trophies, and most people understand the caveats and
limitations of that.

the personality conflicts, I generally have no idea about,
because I don't know any of the people involved, and that stuff
usually isn't discussed openly.

Jeme is an easy case.  you have an issue with the way he applied
the description "totalitarian regime" to PDXLUG.  Jeme is just
nutty about that.  this is not usually a problem.  any large,
diverse group of people will have some that are predictably nutty
about something or other, and people learn to deal with it.

his worldview is logically consistent to him, but the statements
he make sound absurd to many other people, because he uses words
in abnormal ways, focusing on the semantic associations that are
meaningful to him and ignoring the ones meaningful to others.  he
ends up expending a lot of energy trying to explain his
unconventional worldview over and over again, which doesn't
really improve his credibility with anyone who doesn't already
understand his worldview.

and he's going to keep doing that, because cyber-anarchists do
not have any other method for resolving disagreements.  to him,
restricting free expression is an ultimate evil, and I'm guessing
he will fight for your right to flame endlessly.  your attempt to
annoy him enough to make him go away is never going to work.

I'm sure I'm leaving things out, but that's what I remember from
the flame war.  anything else you'd like a response to?

oh, in case it isn't clear, I don't speak for anyone but me.

Is there a way around this?  I think there is CUPS package. Since I use

I think this is a pretty darn good way of explaining this in retrospect.

I take the term "nutty" above to be meant as "peculiar" or "not like you
and me".  The respect and understanding shown in the rest of the message
clearly indicate that Felix did not intend it to be synonymous with
"crank" or "loon" or something.

I do spend a lot of energy trying to explain my views to people and, I
must say, it pays off.  Whenever anybody "gets it", after explanation or
right off, we get along swimmingly and often come to fantastic new
understanding of things together.  This doesn't mean they always agree
with my opinions, but understand my analysis and come to a common
understanding of terms.  Lots of people, though, just throw up their hands
either because they are so repulsed by what they think I'm saying that
they become mentally paralyzed or because they believe they do not have
time to listen to another person who doesn't share their narrow view.
It's a shame, but it's reality.

And you're darn right that we do not have any other method for resolving
disagreements.  The ONLY way to resolve disagreements is to talk them out
until you both understand the situation and can reach real agreement.
That might seem crazy to those out there who want to solve a problem by
picking up a gun or withholding food (essentially the same thing --
violence) or just dismissing and insulting those with whom they disagree
(essentially the same thing -- disrespect).  But it works with anyone who
takes the time and applies the intelligence and shows the respect
necessary.  Needless to say, this requires actually wanting to solve the
problem.

Y'all might be surprised to find that Cliff and I have, in fact, come to
mutual understanding off-list.  There remain a couple of tiny points of
interpretation where we differ, but that's just the spice of life... or
something.

The only real obstacle to anarchism (and I don't have any idea what a
"cyber-anarchist" is) is ego or pride.  When you can accept change (of
mind, of heart, of anything) without seeing that as an admission of
weakness, then real peace and understanding are possible.  For some
people, this requires a trust that they will not be ridiculed for showing
this supposed weakness.  Those people can be helped along by giving them
as much love and understanding back as you can possibly muster.

Tempers may flare, but respect should be always maintained and worn on
your sleeve.

Some people think that you have to show yourself as some kind of threat to
be taken seriously.  I believe it's exactly the opposite.

This has nothing to do with PLUG and I won't follow up anything on this
topic anymore on this list, but I just wanted to share and see if maybe
there aren't some kindred minds out there that might be ready to help move
in this direction.

On our old Suns, we have to have /etc/hosts.lpd, not hosts.equiv. But
there's also /etc/lpd.perms that needs to be tweaked.

Stupid freakin' bash question that I'm too tired to answer for myself at
the moment:

How do I call a variable that may have oogy characters in it so that it is
passed as a single argument to my calling program without going through
and specially escaping all the spaces and ticks and stuff?

`command $filename` substitutes first and then runs the command so your
spaces seem to separate arguments and so on.  That's very clear and
obvious... but `command "$filename" doesn't seem to do what I want,
either, though to my mind it should (and the when I just echo the command
instead of running it, I get what I'd like to see).

Gaaaah.

Can you install CUPS on the FreeBSD box?  Will that get around this
problem?

Are there entries in /var/log/lpd-errs?  Any indication that lpd is
recognizing the print request?

Double quotes, i.e. ", they prevent special character expansion, but not
variable expansion (yeah I know there is a contradiction there)


# foo="bing bar"
# `cat "$foo"`
cat: bing bar: No such file or directory
# `cat $foo`
cat: bing: No such file or directory
cat: bar: No such file or directory

Does backslashing the quotes help?

  $(command \"$filename\")

If $filename is really, really messed up with non-ascii chars, you
might try something like

  find './odd file name' -print0 | xargs -0 command

Oregon State University uses the following RBL's to handle the
University's mail numbering in the hundreds of thousands. The
administrators there report good results with zero "false positives" so
far (taken directly from their main.cf file):


maps_rbl_domains =     rbl-plus.mail-abuse.org,
                       opm.blitzed.org,
                       dnsbl.njabl.org,
                       dynablock.njabl.org,
                       dul.dnsbl.sorbs.net

I hope you find this helpful. Let me reiterate that I had so much fun
presenting presenting last night, you're definitely welcome!


Very Truly Yours,

I was trying to get computer Z to use computer A as a CUPS print
server.  My difficulty was my own fault since I have done this in
various ways before and simply forgot what I had done.  I have a
notebook running RH8 that prints to computer A just fine (using lpr,
though), a  Win98 that works through Samba, and I'm pretty sure that I
had something running CUPS that worked. I don't believe I ever had CUPS
broadcasting: 

        this means that when you use the CUPS admin tool
        (http://localhost:631/) you will see a list of all CUPS printers
        on the LAN, and thus there is nothing to do on the client
        
I found this website:

http://people.trustcommerce.com/~adam/hacks/cups-network.php

which solved my problem.  You need to make the following edits to

/etc/cups/cupsd.conf

BrowseAddress 10.0.1.255

or whatever your LAN broadcast address is.

Under Security Options, change to
<Location />
Order Deny,Allow
Allow From All

This assumes you are behind a firewall.

Restart cups and you're done:
/etc/init.d/cups restart

Your printer should now show up on any networked computer running cups.

Just curious if PLUG has a donation system or something that helps pay 
for promotional stuff, hosting, etc. I am not saying that it is wrong, 
just wasn't aware that such a financial backing existed in PLUG.

No concerns, just curiousity.

PLUG does not have a bank account. Mention of an account was wishful
thinking on Dave's part. He has always wanted to formalize the group's
existence so that it could have things like bank accounts, group-funded
promotional materials, etc.

I couldn't say. He tried to get the group to file as a not-for-profit
several years ago, but was voted down. PLUG's politics alwasy remind me of
the Will Rodgers quote:

"I belong to no organized party... I'm a Democrat."

Well, the "right" or "wrong" program is a rather subjective thing IMO,
at some level, if it gets the job done it can't be all wrong.  Remember
a good answer in time is infinitely better than the best answer too
late.

When all you have is a hammer everything is a nail, but a screw driven
with a hammer still holds two boards together. :P

David and I discussed this a few months ago. PLUG would have to
become a legal entity and that brings with it obligations and
expenses. PLUG has no membership dues now but that may have
to change if it incorporates. The concept of PLUG "membership"
may need to be nailed down so the organization can function
according to its Bylaws. 

Once you have Bylaws and corporate officers, you will eventually
run into political struggles that can suck the life out of the
group. The best example of this is the Portland PC User Group,
which had a complete meltdown some years back that stopped the
group from functioning for a time, involved claims of theft of
capital assets, and (if I recall correctly) drained the bank
account.

PANUG had a similar squabble, where the Board of Directors had
a total meltdown and could no longer operate according to its
Bylaws. Fortunately, the group had contracted with an outsource
company that ran the group until the membership could replace
the Board. However, the first action of the new Board was to
discuss the group purchasing insurance to protect Board members
from being sued by one another. 

One only has to have monitored the silly pissing match on the
PLUG list this week to easily envision similar or worse things
happening to PLUG. My suggestion is to remain free.

I wasn't asking about implementations of the "right" application.
I'm asking about when the type of application is wrong for the
task.

The biggest example of this that I see is using smtp to push large
attachments to others. Many headaches are saved when people learn how
to use http and/or ftp instead.

I just now booted my Knippix 3.3 CD.

/usr/sbin/smartd - version 2.1
/usr/sbin/smartctl - version 2.1

I love Knoppix.

This is a bad one.  However, I regularly see a worse one, that of
using Excel (or other spreadsheets) to process (reduce), analyze, and
visualize scientific data.

I admit to having written entire missile simulations in spreadsheets
before; so, I can't cast the first stone.  But nothing is more
frustrating than trying to teach a grad student to use SAS, R, or any
of the other serious tools... don't even consider trying to get them
to understand when to use things like CVS or or a numerics library
like LAPACK.  It seems like there's a gene for using judgement in
picking the right tool for a job... either you're born with it or
you're not.

Of course, this is all very subjective.  Artifacts are, in some ways,
autotelic.  They may have been created teleologically; but, as soon 
as an ignorant user can pick it up and start farting around with it
(like a 5 year old with a playstation), the final cause becomes an 
emergent property of the usage patterns.

Anyway, good luck getting actual stats.  The only thing I've seen
in this regard are the IDS and forensic tools that track "abnormal"
behavior.  There were also projects at IBM and UNM to dynamically
learn typical usage patterns for tools like lpr.  But, I doubt one
could ever quantify how often, say, Acrobat is used wrongly.

What do you mean by wrong?  Often when I see somebody using the "wrong" 
program it's because using the "right" program would cause more 
immediate headaches and delay their goal more than just getting it done 
with the "wrong" program.

I once saw a drawing distributed as a spreadsheet using the cell border characters for the line draw.  It included instructions on what size to verify the cells were at to ensure the printed drawing would be to scale.

How about people using their email folders as a document filing system?  Right up to mailing things to themselves to put items into the system.

People distributing text documents as Microsoft Word Documents.  Friends
of mine (rarely) receive MS Word Docs as email forward/jokes (not
viruses, clean).  Idiot professors at PSU regularly post MS Word
Documents on their websites, be it WebCT or other pages.

For that matter, people distributing text as PDF documents.  Completely
unformatted text, or text that doesn't need to be printed (only
viewed).  People utilize PDFs instead of html files on websites far too
often - I *hate* having to load a plugin for them!  Not that there
aren't good uses for PDFs, there are plenty... I regularly print to PDF
then put the PDF on a website when I need to print a report but don't
have physical access to my printer at the time.

I've also had friends and family (not myself these days) receive
pictures attached to emails in the form of MS Word Documents.  You open
the MS Word Document and what do you see?  A picture on a piece of
paper.  Nice.

Knoppix kinda seems like overkill for such a project, to me.  Just the
bandwidth downloading it, alone...  :-)

I know these utilities are available on lnx-bbc, I'm downloading the
latest image now to see if they're included in the default download.

Yeah, that's why I asked.  I found the PLD-Linux rescue CD which claims
to have them: http://rescuecd.pld-linux.org/.  Thanks to Kris for

I actually think this is currently the best way to move large chunks of 
data around for the average person, it's up to the IT departments to 
accommodate users' needs rather than the other way around.

These are generalizations, but ones I've never experienced a 
counterexample:  Joe Salesguy at ACME Widgets *will not* learn how to 
use an ftp program unless somebody ties his paycheck directly to the 
documents he sends via ftp.  Jerry Customer at Blammo Corp. (whom Joe 
Salesguy wants to send the documents to) *will not* have a private ftp 
location they can receive the documents at.  From Joe and Jerry's 
perspective email is perfect, just fire and forget.

That looks interesting, I'm downloading it to have a look now.  I'm a
real fan of lnx-bbc, though.  I had to modify it significantly to get it
to do exactly what I wanted (removed useless utilities - who needs sound
on a rescue CD?!?... and added things like OpenVPN)... but that was all
really easy to do.

I see that PLD-Linux rescue CD doesn't have X on it... probably a good
thing ... and *does* have OpenVPN.  Now, does it have man pages? 
lnx-bbc, fwiw, does not have any man pages on it, does have X, and even
Mozilla-Firebird in the latest CVS, I understand.  :-)

Weird... that's not the behavior I'm seeing.

mplayer is still splitting on the spaces and treating each word as an
argument.

Backslashing the quotes give me the right output when I echo the command
back, i.e.

command "file with spaces"

But it still seems to try to execute with three arguments.

I agree on both counts: it's easy, and it's up to IT to provide an
easy alternative.

I could have stated the problem a little better. It's one thing to
send an attachment to someone; that's quick and easy.

It's another thing to send the same attachment to many people; that's
when dropping it in ~/public_html (or H:\public_html in the unified
NFS/CIFS environment we provide here) make so much more sense, and
I'd be hard-pressed not to laugh out loud if someone claims it's a
difficult procedure.

It happens every hour of every day in the corporate world Ed.

IMHO, the spreadsheet-as-swiss-army-knife mistake is the most common. At a
former place of employment a CIO mailed everyone in the IT department a
copy of an inventory spreadsheet. We were told to fill in the blanks for
our systems and return the modified version to his Admin.  His poor Admin
had to merge the data out of all those spreadsheets into the original.
Ugh.

Same employer different problem - someone developed a "database" for a
mission critical group using... wait for it... Microsoft Access. They made
the stupid thing multi-user by loading it on a Novell server. Doh!

I'm having some problems using IMAP on our Groupwise server. I don't
think the problem is the server, as Windows and Mac clients (like Mac
Mail) have no problem with it. I've had two different problems, with
Mozilla 1.2.1 and Evolution.

Mozilla: Messages will be retrieved, but once in a while one message,
when hilighted, will show the header and body of an adjacent message.
This will not go away until I exit the program and come back later.
Also when I read a message, it changes to "read" status, but when I
check mail again, it gets reset to "unread" status.

Evolution: Evolution gets stuck after checking a few messages. I'll
hi-light a message, and it will just sit there "retrieving message
2535" and I will have to eventually kill all the evolution processes.
Any ideas what might be causing this, or how to fix it?

Also, what is a quick way to kill all processes that contain the word
"evolution" such as "evolution-mail," "evolution-calen," etc.?

Thanks,

-Scott

Well daily I see people using MS Windows instead of UNIX/Linux.  No damn, 
that's not what you meant.  Let's see ... MS Office instead of 
OpenOffice.org/Staroffice.  Damn again.  I give!

Sorry I couldn't resist.

Well mine went the other way with a spreadsheet.  This was a long time
ago.  DOS just out (CP/M machines still floating around and working) and
we had Data General minis with CEO (Comprehensive Electronic Office).  I
watched as a person created a nice spreadsheet to hold employee costs:  
hours per week, pay rate, etc.  Typed in each line of data then used a
hand calculator to figure out the products and sums for each line,
subtotals and totals for each group.

Not sure it'll help, but Randal described some of the subtleties here
a while back.  Too bad the email archive is still as un-useful as it
currently is.

Then, there is grep, which points me at a thread in late November 2002,
with the Subject: "File renaming scripts".  See:

  <http://lists.pdxlinux.org/pipermail/plug/2002-November/thread.html>

and search down towards the bottom.

For the record, I'm getting something like:

file not found: '"file'
file not found: 'with'
file not found: 'spaces"'

What gives?

According to the manpage (look under "Word Splitting") enclosing a
variable expansion in quotation marks makes it one parameter, while on
its own, it will split words. 

I made a script called "foo" that just did "echo $#" -- i.e., when
run, it would echo back the number of parameters it was passed. Made
the following run:

omoikane:~$ export VAR="one two three"
omoikane:~$ echo $VAR
one two three
omoikane:~$ ./foo $VAR
3
omoikane:~$ ./foo "$VAR"
1
omoikane:~$ echo $(./foo "$VAR")
1
omoikane:~$ echo $(./foo $VAR)
3
omoikane:~$ ./foo $(echo $VAR)
3
omoikane:~$ ./foo $(echo "$VAR")
3
omoikane:~$ ./foo "$(echo $VAR)"
1
omoikane:~$ ./foo "$(echo "$VAR")"
1
omoikane:~$

Is one of these what you were looking for?

Subject: [PLUG] local source Cisco 678 or reasonable equivalent
Message-ID: <200401221634.04112.mmartin@u.washington.edu>

Anyone know where I can find a Cisco 678 DSL modem/router locally for a 
reasonable price?  Ebay seems to be the best non-local option.  I'm also open 
to alternatives, especially since the 678 is beyond its end-of-life according 
to Cisco.  What I need is a router that will perform transparent bridging on 
a DMT line (apparently DMT issue 2 encoding).  I'm trying to make my system 
visible on a DSL line from SpiritOne and Qwest so I can serve my web site and 
mail and the Actiontec that I leased from Qwest won't do transparent 
bridging.

Thanks.

I just set up one of these yesterday (on SpiritOne and Qwest also) and
I saw some kind of port forwarding setting in the Actiontec setup.
That should do the trick for you.

Try something like this:

I have done similar things in the past to get mplayer to run on files with spaces in the name.

You're right, Russel.  Port forwarding is an option presented in their web 
interface but the hardware doesn't seem to support it.  The software also 
offers the option of transparent bridging, which doesn't work.  I tried both 
of these options.  Both SpiritOne and Qwest told me that it wouldn't work and 
my experiments seem to verify their statements.  But thanks for the tip.  It 
was certainly worth a try.

I've had the same setup in many places I've been, and you're right it's 
not difficult for you and I and perhaps the people you work with, but it 
is difficult for the vast majority of the computer using public.

Here's what I've witnessed multiple times: instead of Joe Salesguy just 
attaching a file to an email and letting email do what it does he now 
has to copy it to h:\public_html.

And figure out that that maps to "http://www.companyname.com/bobo/".

And tack the name of the file onto it and send the email containing the 
url of the file.

And the file's name is "4th quarter sales projections (eastern 
division).ppt".

And then all of the recipients' mail program's url parsers won't 
properly parse a bare url with spaces in it and everybody trys to grab 
the file at "http://www.companyname.com/bobo/4th"

And then all of the recipients email Joe back and say they couldn't get it.

And then Joe just attaches the file to an email and sends it off and 
calls up the IT department and (very rightly) bitches at them (for the 
wrong reasons).

The Big-5 accounting/consulting firms were (and likely still are) most
consistent offenders.  Ernst & Young once flew me to Dallas for a week
to salvage a tangle of spreadsheets built by the Government Consulting
Group to detail the effects of maintenance cost increases at Lockheed. 
Someone had created over a dozen spreadsheets requiring consolidation,
but loading then all under Windows95 crashed the OS.  I ran OS/2, so I
was able to consolidate them all, load OS/2 on a PC there, and escape.

IBM Global Services used MS-Access under WindowsNT for the Los Angeles
Public Schools E-Rate project (fiber to the desktop in the classrooms). 
They had a separate Access database for each school's equipment and yet
other databases to track subcontractor work, invoices and payments.  It
couldn't have been managed worse if they'd tried to screw up by design. 
(IBM also pirated a few dozen copies of MS-Access software to do this.)

I strongly suspect such instances are not anomalies in many companies.

gets a lot of them.  Worked on my own processes, at least... don't know
about others.

if you really want to kill them all, try one of these:
$ ps -ef | grep evolution | grep -v grep
# ps -ef | grep -e 'evolut[i]on'
to see if these are the ones you don't like.  (In the 2nd form, the
square brackets are a trick to "not see" the process that has is doing
the grep-ing. The brackets can be on any character in the word.)
then add awk to get just the process id's and then add kill to kill
those processes as follows:
$ kill -9 `ps -ef | grep -e 'evolut[i]on' | awk '{print $2}' `

Hope this helps, and that nobody is editing a term paper on evolution at
the time.

Just for grins, I decided to do a benchmark test on my big shiny new
120G WD. I came up with some weird numbers:

# hdparm -tT /dev/hdb

/dev/hdb:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   1568 MB in  2.00 seconds = 784.00 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:   22 MB in  3.25 seconds =   6.77 MB/sec

I was expecting the second number to be over 20MB/s, because my old 15G

Have you enabled any features with hdparm? This is frequently the
cause of poor performance (at least in my experience).

run hdparm on the drive w/out any flags, you should get something like
this:

-($) hdparm /dev/hde

/dev/hde:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 IO_support   =  3 (32-bit w/sync)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 23989/16/63, sectors = 156301488, start = 0


This is a good article on the subject:

http://linux.oreillynet.com/pub/a/linux/2000/06/29/hdparm.html

and here are the switches I use (on an 80gig DMA-100 baracuda):

/sbin/hdparm -m16 -c3 -d1 /dev/hde

Er, there is an easier way to do this... as root, issue the command:

(On some systems it may be under /usr/libexec[...] or maybe elsewhere.)

Ooh, that's pitiful!

Are you asking what does it all mean, or are you asking why your
buffered disk read throughput is so low?  I get 40 MB/sec from my WD and
57 MB/sec from my Maxtor.  

Were there other particularly active processes running on your system?
Are you using the ribbon cable that came with your hard drive?
Are you sure your motherboard supports UDMA100 or UDMA133?
Did you remember to remove the big red flag that says "Remove before
flight"?  (Just kidding...)

Might be helpful to post the output of # hdparm /dev/hdb

That leads me to a question...

I'm running Gentoo with 2.6.0 kernel, and doing this:

hdparm -d1 /dev/hda

gives me this:

/dev/hda:
 setting using_dma to 1 (on)
 HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Operation not permitted
 using_dma    =  0 (off)

and only in linux does it do this....in windows DMA mode works, so i don't 
understand why it won't let me enable it....maybe i should emerge the latest 
hdparm or something?

Most of us. One is tempted to suggest a content management system, but I
have never seen a content management system that satisfied the following
requirements:

1) had a _simple_ web front end, which was:
    a) secure
    b) fast
2) had a gui or cui front end, with searching capabilities
3) could easily import items from other sources (email, web pages)
   a) would like to be able to put a url in, and have it screenscrape,
either content or the entire page with images
   b) would like to forward an email to a gateway, or dump an mbox file
or Maildir dir at it in some way (http upload? upload through the
gui/cui?) and have it keep it intelligently.

Until that exists, do you have a better way of doing things than email?

Or does that exist? (please?)

hmm...maybe I should make that...

Jeff

I'd use that. Maybe I should go write that.

Doing some Googling comes up with the following suggestion.
Do you have a VIA chipset on your motherboard and if so, do
you have the following set in your kernel?
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_VIA82CXXX=y
CONFIG_IDEDMA_PCI_AUTO=y

HomeBase Anywhere (http://homebase.oeone.net/) may give you some ideas
of what is possible.  WebDAV is behind most of their transfer
technology.  As an Apache module, I have found it to be quite useful,
too.  (This is known as "Web Folders" in mikerowesoftees.)

Not exactly, but they are getting close!  I believe the pieces are
there, it is just a matter of getting them all to play together.

My favorite was a company president who used Lotus 123 for a word
processor. He used V4 (for DOS) and insisted that I set up his new win95
PC so that he wouldn't have to use "that damned mouse."  He set the cell
width to 80 and typed to his heart's content.

Printing on his dot matrix was a snap, but the ribbons were getting hard
to find for the mannesman-tally he preferred.

He later dropped over 10K on a new HP license for his Unix network
without letting me have a shot at his terminal server with Linux. Oh,
well.

All,

A government agency is considering the release of taxpayer funded source
code under the GPL.

They wish to see examples of agencies that have released source code in
the past so that they may consider the best alternatives for doing so.

Can anyone cite specific agencies or individuals who are willing to
share their experience releasing source code to OSS or web sites
dedicated to such?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0401230949540.31430@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I've run into a unique situation. A mail list manager used by the Oregon
State Library system for state agencies keeps sending me copies of a message
because their MLM does not receive an acknowledgement that the message has
been received(!). I've never before encountered this.

  I don't know that postfix can be tuned to send an acknowledgement. The
address list includes this string for each address:

	IPM Return requested Receipt notification requested

  I've not seen this before.

  Is there something I can do with postfix to sent back a code that would
satisfy their MTA?

TIA,

Rich

GNU Ada (GNAT, <http://www.gnat.com>).  If I remember the story
correctly, the gov't (DoD or DARPA or someone) funded a company to
build the Ada extention to GCC.

It seems to me that if Postfix honored a return receipt request, every
spammer in the world would know you had a valid address, immediately...

We've got a very old RHL system (6.1) and we're trying to determine who is 
logging in to get they mail via POP3.  I can't remember where to turn this

Anyone remember how?

  From the hundreds of rejected spam every day they apparently already know.

  Regardless, apparently that's what postfix/mailman on the originating side
wants. Also, apparently my postfix installation is the only one not telling
the originating site that the message was received.

I think it's from a system that uses x400. Can you post all the headers?
Do you know if the library uses Groupwise or Lotus software?

A little followup ...

According to: <http://eu.conecta.it/paper/Some_dates_open_source.html>

  1992: The US Air Force awards New York University (NYU) a contract
        to build an open source compiler for what is now called Ada
        95. The NYU team chooses GNU GCC for code generation and calls
        their compiler GNAT (GNU NYU Ada 95 Translator).

I think the acronyms, and application names are one part of the open
source culture that I very much enjoy.

One sub culture apsect that I think has occured is you can tell how
much a person knows about linux/FOSS by how they pronounce certain
applications.  Though not always true.

Seems like it took me some effort to find a pronunciation for
PostgreSQL.  Awful name.  Even worse daemon (who the hell decided on
"postmaster"?!).

David and I discussed this a few months ago. PLUG would have to
become a legal entity and that brings with it obligations and
expenses. PLUG has no membership dues now but that may have
to change if it incorporates. The concept of PLUG "membership"
may need to be nailed down so the organization can function
according to its Bylaws. 

Once you have Bylaws and corporate officers, you will eventually
run into political struggles that can suck the life out of the
group. The best example of this is the Portland PC User Group,
which had a complete meltdown some years back that stopped the
group from functioning for a time, involved claims of theft of
capital assets, and (if I recall correctly) drained the bank
account.

PANUG had a similar squabble, where the Board of Directors had
a total meltdown and could no longer operate according to its
Bylaws. Fortunately, the group had contracted with an outsource
company that ran the group until the membership could replace
the Board. However, the first action of the new Board was to
discuss the group purchasing insurance to protect Board members
from being sued by one another. 

One only has to have monitored the silly pissing match on the
PLUG list this week to easily envision similar or worse things
happening to PLUG. My suggestion is to remain free.

Ed

Keeping in mind that not all drives are created equal, some other factors
must be considered. Mainly things like, how much cache or memory buffer
exists? A drive with 2 MB of cache memory, verses newer drives with 8 MB
will obviously perform differently...so you must compare apples w/ apples. I
am assuming you may have considered these things in comparing the two (WD?)
drives.  Not to get off subject, but Maxtor has some nice features of late..
speaking of speed and such. Also concider, IDE v.s. SCSI etc, (but I know
you must be doing this)?

Just for grins, I decided to do a benchmark test on my big shiny new
120G WD. I came up with some weird numbers:

# hdparm -tT /dev/hdb

/dev/hdb:
Timing buffer-cache reads: 1568 MB in 2.00 seconds = 784.00 MB/sec
Timing buffered disk reads: 22 MB in 3.25 seconds = 6.77 MB/sec

I was expecting the second number to be over 20MB/s, because my old 15G
produces around 18 MB/s. What does this mean?

  I'll ask. Their main guru at the state library told me that different
departments use different software, but it all goes through the X.400
protocol. As I don't have this problem with mass mailings from the Dept. of
State Lands, I'll ask the DLCD folks to turn off the requests.

Many thanks, Chuck,

Interestingly, I was able to do a low-level format through the SCSI
controller, but still can't write a partition table to the disk.

Same error.

If it's a stuck actuator, wouldn't that prevent the low-level format?

It's probably in "D" state, i.e., blocked by the kernel processing a
huge number of disk requests. If you kill -9'd it, and there aren't
real issues, it'll stop ... eventually.

This has nothing to do with killing the process, but what filesystem was
it on?

rm -rf under reiserfs never takes any time at all.

  If you know the pid for the rm command, use "kill -9 <pid>".

The parity error indicates a wiring/interface proplem, or even
termination. (I think)

Sorry, I missed the first message.

Have you tried swapping positions on the backplane?  See if the problem
follows the disk.  A parity error sounds cabling and/or termination
issues.

The old one that's performing well (~18MB/s) is a Maxtor with a 2MB
buffer on a separate debian system. It has the following parameters set:

/dev/hda:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 I/O support  =  0 (default 16-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 1860/255/63, sectors = 29888820, start = 0
 busstate     =  1 (on)

On this machine, I have two nearly identical 120GB WD drives (with 8MB
buffers), both performing the same. These are performing poorly (~7MB/s)
and have these parameters set:

/dev/hdb:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 IO_support   =  0 (default 16-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  0 (off)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 14589/255/63, sectors = 234375000, start = 0

Judging from the article posted earlier, DMA ought to speed things up
considerably. I do have the VIA chipset and I was experiencing the
"Operation not permitted" error. I have just now recompiled my kernel
with both of those flags on. I'll see if the error goes away once I
reboot in the new kernel.

Thanks for everyone's information!

Not reiser, ext2.
It also is not in D state. This is ps output:

root      8532 81.9  0.1  1800  452 ?        R    12:58  31:52 rm -i -rf doug

Weird, cause I also did not use the -i flag.  -f should force it
anyways, I guess.
kill -9 8532 does not do anything.  There is no feedback whatsoever.

Nice! I didn't even have to touch anything. The drive now has the
following flags:

/dev/hdb:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 IO_support   =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 14589/255/63, sectors = 234375000, start = 0

Apparently, my startup scripts were trying to set those flags all along
but couldn't because of the kernel issue. Now that the kernel has
support for it, I get the following much better benchmarks:

# hdparm -tT /dev/hdb

/dev/hdb:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   1528 MB in  2.00 seconds = 762.86 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  166 MB in  3.02 seconds =  55.06 MB/sec

Thank you everyone!

Yes, you may want to double check your connections all the way along the
SCSI connecter and especially the end termination point. I had the same
problem before and that was the solution!

The "-i" comes from a RedHat default for root.  If you type "alais" it
will show you that "rm" has been aliased to "rm -i".  To avoid the alias
you can either use "-f" or use /bin/rm instead of just "rm".

Is that process still accumulating CPU time?  If not, it's probably stuck
on an I/O somewhere.  (Though "ps" should have reflected that...)

If the process is still attached to a console, you can sometimes kill a 
process that doesn't seem to accept ^C by suspending it (^Z) and then 
'kill %n' the job (where n is determined by the output of 'jobs').   For 
some reason suspending the process always seems to work even when 
killing it doesn't.

  On this day in 1851 the City of Portland was incorporated, making it the
second incorporated community, after Oregon City, in the Oregon Territory.

  A toss of a coin between Asa Lovejoy from Boston and Francis Pettygrove of
Portland, Maine later in the year determined the city's name. But, because
of the clusters of tree stumps between log cabins there, travelers passing
through continued to call the community "Stumptown".

  The stumps have been replaced with street repair and building erection.
And, no, Vera Katz was not the mayor then.

  Portland: "The City That Woks".

Message-ID: <BAY9-F54pr254Vhm9Km000770cd@hotmail.com>

Dear All:

I got a new GeForce MX 5200 card with TV-out.
I have installed in onto my box running RH 9.  When
playing movies with xine on my 32" TV, I can see the top and left border of 
the picture
frame.  I tried to adjust the aspect ratio but could not get the picture to 
align
so that the top and left border does not show up.
Is there anything I can do so that picture aligns with my TV screen?

Also, while Linux is booting up, all the text before
X-window starts flickers as if the vertical refresh rate is messed up.
As soon as X starts, everything is fine because I have modified
XF86Config to set the vertical refresh as 60 Mhz.
Is there a place I can set that for text-mode?  Or is it a different
problem altogether?

thanks

--Vincent

I hate to say it, but rebooting will most definitely stop the process,

Subject: [PLUG] kupdated - What is it?
Message-ID: <1074896767.2184.8.camel@timmy>

Every once in a while (often after or during some big disk access), my
machine grinds to a halt. When I'm lucky enough at the time to have a
top window open, I see that kupdated is using 99% of the processor. The
hard-drive LED is also beet-red during this period.

Some googling hasn't turned up anything conclusive. What is kupdated,
and why is it using up all the processing power?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0401231520120.32318@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  The weekend after this I want to move my main server/workstation to my new
box running Slackware-9.1 from the current one running Red Hat 7.3. This
move includes ensuring that postfix is running properly, that the dns server
is working as intended and that the tape drive and cd-rw make the physical
move (with the SCSI card) without problems.

  Because I'm quite new to Slackware I'd feel more comfortable with someone
more experienced than I with this distribution standing by for when the
inevitable glitches show up. Pizza and microbrew happily provided.

  Any takers?

You know it.  That's what I did.  Before I got Cliff's email. (darn

I had to use the reset button.

Message-ID: <000501c3e20c$f3309c40$0b01a8c0@lemonhead>

Vincent,

Regarding your pre X-Windows video mode issues, there are a couple of
things I know of that may help:

1.	Use VGA=ASK in your lilo or grub configuration.  During boot,
you should be prompted to enter a video mode and provided a list of
video modes that you can choose from.  When you find one that works, you
can make the setting permant in lilo or grub.

I'm using vga=791, which sets my text mode to 48k x 60hz, 1024x768x 64k
colors.

Check
http://gate.csl.mtu.edu/lxr/http/source/Documentation/fb/vesafb.txt for
better documentation and a list of possible video modes.

2.	You could install and configure SVGATextMode, a linux utility
that helps with this kind of thing.  I've never used it so I can't write
to it's effectiveness, by my research indicates it has a decent
reputation on other LUG lists.

Hope that helps.  I assume you already know this, but be careful not to
cook your TV or monitor.

Dear All:

<snip>

Also, while Linux is booting up, all the text before
X-window starts flickers as if the vertical refresh rate is messed up.
As soon as X starts, everything is fine because I have modified
XF86Config to set the vertical refresh as 60 Mhz. Is there a place I can
set that for text-mode?  Or is it a different problem altogether?

Have you tried xvidtune?

$ man xvidtune

(I assume you were adjusting your TV, which of course is the first thing
to try.)

It's a kernel process flushing dirty buffers to disk. If it's really
sucking up all your processing power so frequently, perhaps you don't
have enough RAM? Just a guess, though.

I've got what seems to be plenty of RAM (774044K). From what I've since
read, it seems the problem might have been caused by my pitifully slow
HD. Now that's it's sped up by a factor of 8, maybe the problem will
disappear.

By the way, what is a "dirty buffer"?

Thanks,
Evan

Changes have been made to memory buffer (making it "dirty"), and some
process has requested data or memory be swapped/read in on top of it,
so the kernel has to write out the old buffer first.

     I don't know if this is the appropriate list to post 
this but here it goes.
     A housemate is looking to sell a Sharp Zaurus SL-5600 
PDA.  In case you aren't aware, the Zaurus runs a version of 
Linux (with I believe QtEmbedded as the GUI).
     It was bought only a few months ago and I don't think 
it's been used much. I think he's mainly selling it for 
compatibility problems (he has an old iMac which doesn't 
work with anything but Palm OS).  He originally paid $500 
for it but the price is negotiable.
     If your interested, don't post to this list (or email 
me), call Arthur at (503)232-1645.

Are you using a VGA cable or the S-Video out on the back of the card?

Are you using the commercial nVIDIA driver?

Are you booting in frame buffer mode or using standard text?

I have the TV-out working correctly on my system.  It requires some odd
hacking to get it to work, but it is possible.

If you enable interrupt-unmasking (hdparm -u1) you'll have an even more
responsive system during HD flushes.

Just to clarify, that's not to say I'd like to have Katz for one second
longer than her current term allows... just that I'm not about to put a
libertarian in an executive/administrative position.

Subject: [PLUG] Strange Time issues
Message-ID: <1074914920.1423.8.camel@timmy>

I have been having some issues with the system clock getting set back
whenever I boot. I have isolated the problem to something that gets run
during the init process. When I boot with init=/bin/bash, the time
remains intact. The time is also not disrupted by a Windows boot or
being off for some time.

I think it always sets the clock back by half an hour, but after this
latest boot I'm not quite sure. My time zone is set correctly (I think):

/etc/localtime -> /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Vancouver

This is really puzzling. Even if the timezone is wrong, the date
shouldn't be getting adjusted, should it?

Thanks,
Evan

You think that won't improve the schools?

Subject: [PLUG] Proper setup of HOSTAP Driver in client mode
Message-ID: <20040124062231.GA27546@gate.kl-ic.com>

Greetings (especially to AthlonRob, Russ, and Mike Rassmussen, who
know more than I do about HostAP):

Thanks for the info a couple weeks ago on setting up HostAP.  I have
something working; I thought I should see if I've done it right or
if I need to do some reconfiguration.

First, like AthlonRob, I was running wlan-ng.  On top of Redhat 9.
Headache city.  Also like A-R, I was under the mistaken impression
that HostAP was only for running Access Points.  Silly me.

Keegan Quinn at ptp pointed out that HostAP would improve my life,
and would operate in client ("Managed") mode.  So I ripped out
important bits of wlan-ng, then installed HostAP, and built a few
ifcfg- files.  I will describe a bit of what I did, and please
correct me if I kludged too stinkily.

First, the wlan-ng tearout;  I moved the old wlan-ng driver from
/lib/modules/<mykernel>/pcmcia/prism2_cs.o to a directory .../pcmcia/old/ .
Then I moved the wlan* files in /etc/pcmcia to /etc/pcmcia/old/ .  

I ran the make script for hostap-driver, with the make script modified
to point to my kernel source.  Then I made and installed hostap-utils.  

After that, kluging began.  I wrote a configuration file
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-wlan0, with ESSID=ANY .
Then I built a /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-klsg, with
ESSID=KLSG (my home network) and KEY="##########" (my WEP key). 
I also built a few other ifcfg- files, for personaltelco, tmobile,
boingo, and wayport, should I find myself in places with multiple APs.

I suspect there is a better way to do this, but right now, when
I insert my card, the system hotplugs the drivers and tries to
connect to an open AP in the vicinity.  It will automagically
find the ESSIDs for www.personaltelco.net or tmobile, for example.
It won't have much luck with my WEPed home network, so in that case
I type "ifdown wlan0" followed by "ifup klsg" and it connects.  I
do something similar if it connects to the wrong open site where
there is a choice. 

However I suspect there is a cleaner way to do this.  Any suggestions?

Keith

Subject: [PLUG] www.opensound.com
Message-ID: <1074815366.3687.36.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

Why do you have to pay to use these drivers and license them on
a card per card basis?  I'm trying to get the builtin Soundmaker
Cadenza on my D845PEBT2 to work under Linux.  I'm extremely
frustrated because I specifically picked this motherboard to be
Linux compatible in the first place.  Does the organization 
running www.opensound.com ever release versions of OSS under 
the GPL?  Not only can I not find free drivers, Intel is 
distributing the wrong ones for people using the D845PEBT2 
under Linux.

One thing I don't get is why Intel doesn't distribute sound card
drivers for a single card instead of distributing huge packages
containing multiple drivers?  I go to all the trouble of searching
on my specific desktop board only to find that Intel won't give me 
the specific driver I need giving me the wrong ones instead on a
page their support search engine misleads me to.

If the sound card wasn't permanently integrated into the motherboard
and case, I'd have jerked it and replaced with a Linux compatible one 
a long time ago.  How can I avoid making the same mistake with another 
desktop board purchase in the future?  The fee to buy an OSS license 
is $20 for the personal version alone.  Even if the driver works, you 
not only don't get to see the source code, you aren't allowed to use 
it on multiple machines without licensing a copy for each one.  They
say you get upgrades for a year, but do they ever give the drivers 
to you under a GPL license when they move on to other hardware?

To install third party sound drivers to kernel source, do I need to 
say no to sound card support or do I just exclude stock kernel 
source drivers?  Is not distributing or information on how to write
one the means by which Intel discourages use of their Pentium 4 
systems for Linux workstations?  I wonder if anyone can hack this 
sound system and release a free driver?  I'd rather sell it and 
pick up an Athlon than work around this issue, I don't want a 
bunch of dead ports or a nightmere scenario when I try to dual
boot Windows and it detects the disabled sound card.

One thought here...

When dual booting, Linux expects the hardware clock to be in UTC while 
Windows keeps it set to local time. What you need to do is keep the 
haredware clock set to local time and make sure in your date/time setup  
you have in Linux is set so that it specifies that the hardware clock 
is on local not UTC time.

In case anyone's interested, I resolved my problem.  Russel was right.  Port 
forwarding works fine with the Actiontec R1524SU, as I suspect transparent 
bridging would.  The real issue was Konqueror's handling of Javascript.  I 
just had to use Galeon to update the configuration rather than Konqueror.  
Doh!

Thanks to everyone who provided assistance.

Before this thread gets out of hand, may I point out to one & all
that all offices in the city of Portland are non-partisan? In
other words, you can't vote the Libertarian, Democrat, Republican, or
Communist ticket for city offices like mayor. Prutzer's comment

From the hundreds of rejected spam every day they apparently already know.

Regardless, apparently that's what postfix/mailman on the originating side
wants. Also, apparently my postfix installation is the only one not telling
the originating site that the message was received.

Message-ID: <r02010000-1032-0B87D9344EB511D8BD60000A959F4BC6@[172.27.1.100]>

Here's something useful for your networking and security tool kit.

Knoppix-STD is a customized distribution of the Knoppix Live Linux CD
<http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html>.  "KNOPPIX is a bootable
CD with a collection of GNU/Linux software, automatic hardware
detection, and support for many graphics cards, sound cards, SCSI and
USB devices and other peripherals.  KNOPPIX can be used as a Linux demo,
educational CD, rescue system, or adapted and used as a platform for
commercial software product demos. It is not necessary to install
anything on a hard disk. Due to on-the-fly decompression, the CD can
have up to 2 GB of executable software installed on it."

Knoppix-STD focuses on security and network management tools.  It is
meant to be used by both the novice looking to learn more about
networking and security, and the professional looking for another swiss
army knife for their tool kit.

The Knoppix-STD 0.1 iso image is available at
<http://www.knoppix-std.org/>

Burn it and give it a spin.  You may like it.

Morphix (morphix.sourceforge.net) is another Knoppix based project.  The
goal here is easy customization of the CD image.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0401241743330.30479-100000@hosting.tearitalldown.com>

Does anyone know how to make Squid do it's normal web proxying, but not
save anything to the filesystem about the browsing history?

I've set:

cache_access_log none
cache_log none
cache_store_log none

And I've modified this line:

cache_dir ufs /var/spool/squid 10 1 1

But I haven't found a way to completely disable all local file storage.
Thanks,

The squid FAQ is great:

	http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/FAQ/FAQ.html

I'm not sure I'm reading your question correctly, but I believe
you are asking FAQ #4.20, Can I make Squid proxy only, without
caching anything?

	http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/FAQ/FAQ-4.html#ss4.20

and all of FAQ #6, Squid Log Files:

You can have multiple sound cards, just has you can have multiple
network or video cards. Usually you can disable the on-board sound
card in BIOS and the operating system will not be able to detect/see
it. Under Linux you can have multiple sound cards active and set
the default one by editing /etc/modules.conf.

kernel update daemon, IIRC.  I believe it deals with the filesystem.

I have a longrunning X server wedged with some xterms open on it.  I'd 
like to recover the command histories from the shells in the xterms. 
How?  I tried (with test shells) killing with various likely signals, 
and they didn't save the histories before dying.  I tried to kill -SEGV 
but couldn't find the core files if they were created.

Any clues?

Maybe Squid is overkill for you. A lighter-weight proxy may be
better. I've used tinyproxy before and it worked well. There are
probably others.

Linux expects the system clock to speak GMT.  Windows does not.  You
might want to google to find out how to let it know the clock is also
set to that timezone instead of GMT.

Not possible.  It has to know something about where people have been

Ahh.  I got my xserver back.  There were two running, on :0 and :1.
Something went haywire with the one on :1 (vague anecdotal association
is running acroread within mozilla).  The something prevented me from
switching virtual consoles.  From another machine, I was able to kill
the :1 xserver (my wife's, heh).  The server on :0 was still runnning
but I couldn't switch to it.  I had tried an Alt-SysRq-r with no
visible effect.  From the other machine, I eventually discovered that
the keyboard on the "frozen" machine was working (I started a process
that I could see from the remote machine).  I realized that I was
typing into a shell, even though I couldn't see anything but a
corrupted version of the xserver on :0.  So, I exited the shell and,
presto, I could change virtual consoles again.  Woohoo!

His goal is to NOT cache. So, it is possible.

Isn't this card supported by Alsa's intel8x0 driver? Looking at

I have the D845PEBT2 motherboard and the sound works fine
with the ALSA snd-intel8x0 driver. It also worked with
the OSS i810_audio. For the alsa driver the the only 
oddity is that the sound comes out of the "surround"
device which must be unmuted and it volume increased.

  * Marble Blast

Cost is $39


CodeWeaver download for Crossover Ofiice is $59
CodeWeaver download for Crossover Plugin is $29
CodeWeaver download for bundled Crossover Office/Plugin is $69

I thought the $30 savings on the CrossOver office/plugin was interesting
enough. The game is $19.95 and WineX, I think has no cost for the

You've got to like the name "WineRack". Who says Linux can't market?

I don't understand your question, but here are the answers to
questions you might be asking:

Are you referring to a file that acts like a lock of sorts, and
prevents the application from starting again?

These files don't have a standard location, or anything that defines
or requires their existence.  ~/.<programName>/ is a good place to
look, or search for <programName>.pid.  /var and /etc are also common
places for these files.

If you just want the pid of a program, "pidof" works well.

$ pidof bash
5795 5794 7372

although you can't see which pid corresponds to which instance of the
program (obviously not an issue if there is only one instance
running).

If you are interested in the parents of a program, the f option
(--forest) to ps is fun.

$ ps -ef f

<snip>

Hello Rogan, thanks for your reply

The question is very simple :)

Some applications have .pid files with the process id.
Look for example into /var/run directory
The other pid's are listed as directories in /proc.
There is a file cmdline in the each pid directory, which shows
with what command an application or a process was launched.

Now I want to determine pid of an application or a process without
using 'ps -ef|grep appl_name'  or scanning all /proc/proc_id/cmdline files.
pidof appl_name doesn't provide a definite answer all the time.

Is there any other way to find pid of application by the name of application 
or the name of its executable file?

Regards,

Alex

There probably are other methods, but I believe they are all
equivelent to the methods listed above.  

You must specify the instance of the program that you are interested
in.  The .pid files are usualy used when only one instance of a
program _can_ run at a time, or when it is unsafe to run multiple
copies of a program at once.  Licq does this because the typical user
dosen't want to have more than one instance running at a time.

If there are multiple instances of a program (say bash) running, how
would the system know which instance you wanted the pid of?  (pidof
provides the -s switch to return just one pid, but how it decides to
do this is unknown--I speculate that it returns the first one it
finds.)


What are you trying to accomplish overall (what are you doing with the
pid you find)? Perhaps we can help you find a solution.

yeah, launch the program that you care about in such a way that the
pid is recorded somewhere.

If you don't like typing the command that gives you what you want,
make a shell script out of it.

Am I not understanding what you are after?  What characteristic of
'pidof foo' doesn't work?  Examples?

Here you go:
pidof /opt/mozilla/mozilla 
doesn't give any pid but 
pidof /bin/sh /opt/mozilla/run-mozilla.sh /opt/mozilla/mozilla-bin
which is some what inconvenient.

I don't have any statistics.  In fact, I suspect one might
have a difficult time defining "wrong application" in an
objective way that would allow one to obtain meaningful
statistics.

On the other hand, anyone with any experience sees this problem
all the time.

I remember BLM/Oregon capturing meta data on their GIS inventory.
This involved capturing complex information about survey field notes,
physical maps, digital map files, and so on.  This resulted in
thousands and thousands of records - all captured as individual
MS Word documents.  Yes, MS Word!!  Just try to search these to
get a complete list of everything using State Plane Coordinates
or having a certain accuracy or containing data before a certain
date or ....  I don't know if BLM ever converted this stuff to
a data base or not, but the MS Word documents were filled with
trival inconsistancies which would have make the conversion
difficult and expensive.

On the other hand, BLM was one of the earliest organizations to
realize the difference between GIS (Geographic Information Systems)
and CAD or computer graphics.  To this day, one sees organizations
putting their maps into AutoCad or even paint packages without
ever considering the desirability of doing geometric calculations
and/or data base manipulation on the data.  You see this in city
engineering departments all the time.

Another app people seem to shy away from is statistics.  One sees
a lot of data analysis attempted in spread sheets that really
should to be done in a decent statistical package.

Subject: [PLUG] UML
Message-ID: <200401252318.53599.kyle@silverbeach.net>

Anyone here have some experience with user mode linux?

I'm trying to set up a UML instance (or three) to run Debian on top of my 
Gentoo machine.  

I've got a UML kernel built (2.4.23) and I think I've configured everything 
correctly.  However, when I have md support in the kernel, it just stops cold 
when it starts doing the speed tests for various kinds of md RAID5 checksum 
calculations (i.e. using MMX, SSE or 8087 registers).  When I take md support 
out, it seems to get fairly far.

I got a minimal Debian image off of the UML site on Source Forge.  This 
doesn't appear to come with a kernel.  In trying to use mine, I found that I 
had to make /dev/ubd/0 point to /dev/ubd0.  The devfs-like path wasn't 
already there and the kernel persists in trying to use it.  I thought that I 
had devfs turned off in the kernel...

The kernel boots, finds the root image (a big file, not COW) and seems to 
start moving right along.  Until it gets to the end of the boot process for 
run level 2.  Then nothing happens.  No login prompt:

... [snip] ...
Configuring network interfaces: done.
Cleaning: /tmp /var/lock /var/run.
Initializing random number generator... done.
Recovering nvi editor sessions... done.
INIT: Entering runlevel: 2
Starting system log daemon: syslogd.
Starting kernel log daemon: klogd.
Starting internet superserver: inetd.
Starting deferred execution scheduler: atd.
Starting periodic command scheduler: cron.

After this, nothing at all happens.  The last things that runs 
is /etc/init.d/rmnologin.  This is some sort of guard against allowing logins 
during boot that Debian appears to use.  

I tried running it in GDB, but interestingly, it never seems to get my command 
line args even with "set args".  I renamed my root file system image to 
root_fs to make sure the defaults work and it still gets to the exact point 
above.  If I send it a SIGTERM, GDB says that it got the signal while in 
waitpid().  Backtrace says that waitpid() and something at address 0x0000000 
are on the call stack :-(  So, I think I bounced through a null pointer 
somewhere.

Is it just a bad image?  Should I get another Debian image from somewhere?  

I'm totally new to UML, so I'm sure I'm asking dumb questions :-)

Best,
Kyle

Why not /proc/*/exe, then?

Yeah ;) and it's a good deal.  I've had CrossOver Office since 2.0 and
have the 2.0.1 upgrade install (at no additional charge for that, BTW).

The cxoffice 2.0 install shell-script let me put it in /usr/local, but
the 2.0.1 RPM insisted on /opt, so I've got pieces in both places.  It
works great, however, so I don't worry about that; Office2K runs fine.

You DO want to read the install doc though, and maybe fix menu icons...

Regards,
Robert

$ pidof mozilla-bin
1229 1225 1224 1216

You have to specify the binary apparently.  The -x switch may help
with this, but I'm not certian I understand what it does. (it dosen't
seem to help with the mozilla example).  I suppose this is
inconvenient, but this is reasonably consistent with the way programs
appear in the ps output also.  I don't know of a better way.

It would be nice if pidof took a reg. exp. as a parameter. (or even a
glob..).  A perl wrapper for ps that does the same thing shouldn't be
to difficult.

As Rob mentioned, sg will work. The 'newgrp' utility will create a
subshell in which you assume a different gid.

My favorite approach, when all the files in a given directory will be
owned by a given group, is just to set the sticky bit on the parent
directory and let the filesystem do the work:

  [heinlein]$ groups
  heinlein wheel uucp
  [tmp]$ cd /tmp
  [tmp]$ mkdir grouptest
  [tmp]$ ls -ld grouptest/
  drwxr-xr-x    2 heinlein heinlein     4096 Jan 26 04:58 grouptest
  [tmp]$ cd grouptest/
  [grouptest]$ touch testfile
  [grouptest]$ ls -l testfile
  -rw-r--r--    1 heinlein heinlein        0 Jan 26 04:58 testfile
  [grouptest]$ cd ..
  [tmp]$ chgrp wheel grouptest
  [tmp]$ chmod g+ws grouptest
  [tmp]$ ls -ld grouptest/
  drwxrwsr-x    2 heinlein wheel        4096 Jan 26 04:58 grouptest
  [tmp]$ cd grouptest
  [grouptest]$ touch test2
  [grouptest]$ ls -l
  total 0
  -rw-r--r--    1 heinlein wheel           0 Jan 26 05:00 test2
  -rw-r--r--    1 heinlein heinlein        0 Jan 26 04:58 testfile

  I'll add two mis-uses of applications and validate Dave's comments on GIS
and statistics. I've seen too many people try to use a spreadsheet rather
than a database and a flat-file database rather than a relational one.

  One instance of the latter that I clearly remember from more than a decade
ago involved a local medical research unit at a hospital not to be named.
They kept patient data in a DOS DBMS (R-base), but no one there knew 1) how
to design or normalize a database or 2) how to use the relational features
of R-base. There was, of course, no relational integrity and every time one
patient had a new procedure another column was added to the table, even if
there was only 1 record with a value for that attribute.

  I reorganized that database in Paradox and discovered a number of
duplicate records; some were identical, some were inconsistent. In any case,
the results of queries were different between the R-base table and the
Paradox tables. "Research" papers were written based on these queries.

  Unfortunately, I did not handle the situation as tactfully as I should
have done so I suspect that not much as done to correct the errors.

  In my environmental work I've seen not only the use of CAD or other
drawing packages used when a GIS was the proper application, but a more
egregious error: not understanding the differences between mapping and
spatial analyses. There is a huge difference between the two. With the
former (on a GIS, not on a CAD) one can ask "what's here?" or "where is
...?". With the latter one can ask "why do we see mass wasting (landslides)
here and not there?" or "what is the total runoff from this drainage basin
with precipitation total of X cm in Y time?".

  This is another area where too many users don't understand the knowledge
underlying the tool. Years ago, someone discovered that the standard
deviation function in Lotus-1-2-3 (on DOS) used the population formula, not
the sample formula. It does make a difference in the results. Apparently the
coders didn't understand statistics, either.

  I worked on a project in the mid-1990s where an engineering consultancy
(PE's, all of 'em) was looking at the settling rate of a filled site. They
set out stakes in a grid and surveyed the elevation of each stake top over
time. Then they did multiple T-tests to see if there were any differences in
the settling rate at different places along the fill surface. There were two
problems here.

  First, when comparing multiple data sets, and asking if the between-set
variance is greater than the within-set variance, the proper statistic is
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), not the T-test which is for two data sets.
Also, the consultants discarded data that showed a rise in elevation at a
stake because that "was not expected".

  Second, since the objective was to determine if the fill had fully settled
and compacted, or was still moving (which would determine the weight of
structures built on it), the appropriate analysis was that of a Time Series,
not just ANOVA. Unfortunately, the engineers used an increasing time period
between samples so time series analyses was not possible.

  My client gave them my report and had them re-do the entire study at no
extra charge. Of course, it delayed development for a couple of years while
the data were collected properly.

  The analogy I've used for years with reference to GIS and spatial analyses
also applies to statistical software. I tell people that you can teach
someone how to use a word processor, but that does not make her a writer.
Similarly, you can teach someone how to use a GIS (or statistical) software
application, but that does not make her a spatial analyst (or statistician).

  So, Ed, in addition to "wrong" applications being used there is the danger
of not understanding the underlying system that the application automates. I
don't know that one problem is more serious than is the other. Both are bad,
IMO.

I don't think so, not without the process being involved.  There is a
patch that lets you suspend the whole running system to disk.  you can
then reboot, poweroff, etc...  It does use the swap space so you can't
run just anything in the meantime.

http://www.checkpointing.org/ is a fairly old site, but has a set of
links to some projects.

afaict, CHPOX is the only recently updated checkpointing tool, but
looks very nice: http://www.cluster.kiev.ua/tasks/chpx_eng.html

The problem is that octal perms are absolute, not relative. Assuming
that the grouptest directory originally had drwxr-xr-x (0755) perms,
then it'd be

  chmod 2775 grouptest

But octal perms can't be used for something like "give the group owner
write permission on all files and directories below this point." I
mean, you probably know that, but ...

I finally went for DAV, using mod_dav for Apache.  (Thanks Kurt!)  I'm
pretty worried about what will happen.  They may fill the directory
with cruft, or someone might get the password and fill that space
with all sorts of junk or use it in ways I don't intend.

But, using IE's web folders seems the right speed for these guys.
Plus, they're all the way down in CA; so, I won't be able to trot
over to their house to show them what to do or set them up.  So,
we'll see.  Thanks for all the suggestions!

You shouldn't have any problems.  Wait... then again... Gentoo... did
you enable any grsecurity things?  It has been rumored (but I haven't
seen any tests) that grsecurity may well break uml.

Forgive my ignorance... md is *not* multidisk, right?  It is something
else?  Why don't you start with one of their precompiled kernels and
test beginning with that?

The UML devs decided they liked devfs for some reason, so it's default. 
The kernel looks for its root filesystem on /dev/ubd/0, all devfs
style.  To disable devfs, you need to install the device files, make
that ubd symlink and adjust the commandline used to boot the UML;

./linux-2.4.19-5 eth0=tuntap,tap0 mem=16M devfs=nomount

...assuming the kernel is built with devfs, as their provided kernels
are.  I think due to distros not providing a ubd device file to begin
with, they decided devfs would be easier to implement across
distributions.

Do you know you can mount that root_fs loopback?  Just do it, go in, and
fix the scripts.  Look at the logs.  Figure out from there, I think....

I haven't used the debian filesystems, only the slackware 8.1 one and a
friend made a 9.1 image he shared with me.

I think your best bet would be to start off with as many of their
defaults as possible; use their kernel to begin with, then start playing
with making your own kernel so you can rule out the image as being the
source of any problems.

Have fun, UMLs are real cool!  :-)

md is multidisk.

Back to on-topic: I suspect one could get rootstrap working with
... relatively ... little effort outside of Debian. If you use it
together with the canonical Debian uml binary (also look in the Debian
mirror archives), you shouldn't run into any issues (unless as has
been pointed out, you're running some funky host kernel).

Well, there's no point in using md with a uml, then, afaict.  Or were we
talking about enabling md in the host kernel?  There's no need to do
*anything* odd with the host kernel, only the uml kernel.

You can actually use uml to test kernel features, such as md. Or test
recovery from block device failure.

Actually, there is a very, very important host kernel patch that can
improve security within the uml and give you a factor of 2 performance
boost. You are right that it is not required, however.

Hmmm... I wasn't aware uml was quite that versatile.  What I and friends
use it for, essentially, is isolating servers.  :-)

The skas patch?  It's against 2.4.19, although "should" work with other
"nearby" kernels... since I'm moving any machine whose kernel needs to
be recompiled to 2.6.x, I kinda glossed over that one.  :-)

For what I use the UMLs for, I really don't notice any kind of
performance hits... but then, I'm not running a heavily loaded server of
any kind, really.

The other key point being security. Even in jail mode, it's possible
(though very difficult) to worm your way out of a tt UML. skas
eliminates this.

Overall, I would say it is worth the $5/month for the 16MB UML.  You get
your own IP address.  5GB/month over the Internet, which (in my
experience) hasn't been able to pull more than 30KB/sec down.

I'm running bind, postfix, openvpn, sshd, and apache on there.  I do
still have room to spare (about 6MB of RAM, believe it or not).  Getting
it set up, initially, was a bit of a pain.

After they set up the box, they email you your root password.  I can
tell you right now what it is, it doesn't seem to change.  You log in. 
If you reboot, you may hose their network setup, ending up with some
downtime; about five hours last time when I rebooted.

After I got the box, they had only given me about 200MB of space,
instead of a full gig.  When they resized it (on a live system, I'm
guessing), they hosed the filesystem and I had to start from scratch
again... no biggy, I had only put in about three hours on the thing.

Other issues... hmmm... their default image is Slackware, which is
great, but it is version 8.1, which is outdated a bit.  Several people
are running Debian on the system, I've seen.

They rebooted me twenty three hours ago for no apparent reason, I didn't
get any notice about it.  My init scripts work, though.  <g>

Before the reboot (I don't know about now, I haven't checked) there was
a significant security hole on the UML host.  It is significant enough
that you do *not* want to store anything on the box you wouldn't be okay
with fifty other people being able to see.

The real plus is it's only five bucks a month, and comes with a static
IP.  What I plan on using it for (they don't have reverse DNS working
yet) is a smart relay for postfix.  It's already working as backup DNS
just fine.  It's set up for backup MX, as well, but I haven't changed my
zone files to include it as an MX yet.

For five bucks a month, I can't complain too much... :-)

This is a really flip answer since I don't understand exactly what you're
trying to do, but depending on how your vim is built, use perl.

:perldo

No. The first is relative; it will do nothing but adjust the group and
sticky bits, regardless of the original perms. It's a bitwise
operation.

The second is absolute; it'll overwrite all existing perms withe the
specified mask. No bitwise ops are needed; just rewrite the perms.

OK...  here's a little more info on my problem...

Here's a line of text...

something.  something.  something else.  maybe something else too.  yep.

I don't know what the text is before each period, and I don't know how
many periods will appear, but after the first period that I encounter I
want to insert a tab after that period.  The following does not work:

:%s/\(^.*\.\)/\1\t/

The problem with this is that it would match everything up to the very
last period and would substitute the tab at the end.  Yes, I could use
Perl, but I encounter this problem all the time and I'd like to be able to
do it from within vim.
Thanks,
~M

Not with the presumed original perms of 0755.  Chmod o+ws would create 2777, if 
sticky meant anything for the other crowd.   The g+ws gives write permission to 
the group.

For the symbolic chmod:
  u - user who owns it
  g - group
  o - others

Bad nmeonics to my way of thinks since "o" maps to owner.

Not exactly. chmod o+s does mean something, but it's meaning varies
depending on whether it applies to a directory or a regular file.

In the case of a directory, it means something to the effect of
"prevent anyone from removing or renaming a file in a directory except
the owner." Check out the perms on /tmp:

  [heinlein at glenfiddich tmp]$ ls -ld /tmp
  drwxrwxrwt   14 root     root         4096 Jan 26 15:03 /tmp

See the 't' at the end of perm string? That's what it means.

In the case of a file, doing chmod o+s will save a program's image to
swap, sometimes reducing load time.

I don't know if you've ever read anyting written by Damian Conway,
but one of his central concepts in parsing is to identify what's
important and throw the rest away.

So, slightly restating your problem, you want to insert a
tab after the first period:

:%s/\./.\t/

Now back to the original problem.  How do you make * less greedy in
vim?  As far as I know, you can't.  But you can use a different idiom
to state what you're looking for:

:%s/([^\.]+\.)/\1\t/

You use an inverted character class.  Find anything but periods,
followed by a period.  Replace that with what you found followed
by a tab.  That's perl regex syntax, so you'll need to find out
how vim does it, but it should translate pretty easily if it's
different.

Ah ha!  Your wildcard is matching everything from the beginning as long as
it's not a period.  Thanks Paul!

Often difficult but always rewarding is Jeff Friedl's book, Mastering
Regular Expressions (O'Reilly).

It's one of those topics where my reaction was, "There can't really be
an entire book's worth of interesting material, can there?" Oddly, the
answer is "Yes, there can."

Traditionally, yes.  But not in the case of Linux based systems:

(man page)
STICKY FILES
       On  older  Unix  systems,  the sticky bit caused executable files to be
       hoarded in swap space.  This feature is not useful on  modern  VM  sys-
       tems, and the Linux kernel ignores the sticky bit on files.  Other ker-
       nels may use the sticky bit on files for system-defined  purposes.   On
       some systems, only the superuser can set the sticky bit on files.

I had a hard drive which would not boot at all. After many tries, I let
it sit for over a day in a fairly cold room. It booted and ran for about
an hour. Just long enough to transfer off a few important files and
then it quit permanently.

Ummm, this is going to sound too simple but:

s/\./.^I

Does what you want.  Find a '.' and replace it with a .TAB

Unless 'g' is given, 's' only works on the first one.

So to be clearer the line

something.  something.  something else.  maybe something else too.  yep

And I hit

        :s/\./.zot
Becomes:

something.zot  something.  something else.  maybe something else too.  yep.

Is this what you want?

The freezer trick has worked for me about 1/3 of the time.  So not a very
high percentage but high enough to have me keep trying it if all else has

I have the drive in an external firewire bay with quick remove tray.  I
grab the tray and stick it in the beer-fridge^H^H^H^H^H^H^H
forensics-and-therefore-a-write-off-cooling-system, and let it "cool"

Ice is bad, but not deadly with the tray.

Often I get 5-10 minutes on a drive.  I do not know why, but it
works....

rsync screwed me since it got bad data off the drive and copied it.

dd of the drive would fail too.

Sometime you cannot get certain areas.

Yes, that works.  I was just using an example to see if it was possible to
do minimal-matching with vim.

You need a lot more info.

How are you trying to listen to it?  What "system" do you expect to
respond.

Some answers:

Via a browser
via email

Both of those also interact with the desktop setting in KDE and GNOME.

You will typically need realplayer for pnms but mplayer can handle some
of them too.  Maybe xine as well.

I wrapped the drive in a towel and then put it in a plastic bag and placed
it in the freezer for four or five hours.  (The towel and bag were my
guess at how to eliminate condensation and ice forming on the metal
surfaces... seemed to work.)

While the drive was really, really cold, I hooked it up to a system and
started a dd.

One time doing this, the drive started clicking about 3/4 of the way
through and I could no longer read, so it went back in the freezer
overnight and I started the dd again in the morning.  Apparently it warmed
too fast.

I don't know anything about why this worked, but I've read some educated
guesses.  But I can say that I've used it with success.

Aye.

Via Browser.  It used to work before upgrade  (RH -> Fedora)
I seem to have Realplayer8 installed, but it no longer works.

I think what you're after in vim is \{-} so your pattern above would be:

Assuming you have Mozilla, if not it will be slightly different:

Edit - Preferences - Helper Applications - New Type 

MIME type: audio/x-pn-realaudio
Description: Real Media Files
File extension: rm, ram, ra
Open With: /usr/X11/bin/realplay "%u"
Uncheck: Always ask me before......

Ok. 
Restart Browser.

In the UML kernel I have it turned off, I think.  I'll have to check.  Good

Yes, for some reason it was in the default UML kernel.  It is very useful to 
have MD in UML so that tests of RAID configurations etc. can be done.  Other 
posters explained this at length.

I turned off devfs completely in the kernel and still had this problem.   I 
worked around it by creating a hard link from /dev/ubd/0 to /dev/ubd0.

Yep, that's how I fixed up /dev :-)

Logging does start, but I need to check how much it is logging.  I should set 
that to the most logging possible.  

It is acting very much like it is simply waiting for someone to log in, but 
tha the mgetty start up didn't work. I've checked /etc/inittab and it should 
be starting, and respawing, mgetty.

I can probably find a minimal Debian image somewhere.  There seem to be a lot 
of Debian derivatives out there :-)

I tried KNOPPIX, but the disk image seems to be unreadable for the kernel.  I 
think I need the zisofs patches.

They seem quite interesting.  I've also found QEMU, which was able to boot and 
get a ways into KNOPPIX before something went wrong with the X support.  It 
should be working, but didn't.  I will be interested to compare UML and QEMU.  
Since QEMU is basically a replacement for VMWare, it should be able to boot 
and run nearly anything eventually.  Right now Linux seems to work fine and 
it reasonably fast.  Once I figure out how to make X pretend to be a local 
server, I'll be fine (this isn't remote X, that's easy).

There's also FauMachine, Bochs and plex86 (the Source Forge project is more 
recent than the Savannah project).  Bochs will run nearly everything I've 
thrown at it, but tends to be about two orders of magnitude slower than 
QEMU :-(  

Best,
Kyle

I wouldn't know where to test that, even.  :-)

I suppose I could play with bzip2 and stuff?  bind, apache, sshd,
they're all responsive as I would expect on such a shared machine.

You can pass root=/dev/ubd0 to the kernel for that.

KNOPPIX, AFAIK, boots with an initrd that includes a cloop module for
the kernel you boot with.  It then mounts the big image file with that
cloop driver.... I don't think they use zisofs.

Yeah, how to test performance is a good question.  User-land code should run 
pretty well unless it does a lot of IO or somehow interacts a lot with the 
kernel.  Heavily threaded apps probably aren't too great.

Here's the command line the ends up with it asking for /dev/ubd/0:

linux root=/dev/ubd0 ubd0=root_fs

You'll note that I did NOT put "root=/dev/ubd/0", yet that is what it is 
looking for :-(

Ah, I think you're right.  I'm going to try with something a little easier 
than KNOPPIX for a while :-)

UML looks very cool, but most of the images on the web site are quite old and 
may not even work with newer kernels.

Thanks for the replies.  I tried it and it was regrettably
unsuccessful.  I plugged the drive in, and as the frost began to form,
powered the box up and it still sounds like an olympic ping-pong
match.  Thankfully I didn't lose much that could be considered
important.  The most valuable stuff was the digital photo archive, and
I had just recently burned that to CDR.

realplayer has trouble with the kernel installed by Fedora.
something to do with Posix threads.
As a workaround use this from the command line

env LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.19 realplay pnm://64.4.116.228/xyz.rm

or you could install  Realplayer9

Hello Linux folkz,
I need to test for existence files in /proc:
/proc/pid_num/cmdline
/proc/pid_num/exe
/proc/pid_num/stat

Subject: [PLUG] configuring Postfix relay to reject messages for specific recipients
Message-ID: <4016BB06.30002@easystreet.com>


Can anyone tell me how to configure a Postfix relay to reject messages for
specific recipients?  

-------

We have 2 Postfix systems (outside of the firewalls, on different ISP's) 
which
receive all e-mail for our company.  I.e.

     $ dig imoveinc.com mx
      ...
     ;; ANSWER SECTION:
     imoveinc.com.           14400   IN      MX      10 p5.imoveinc.com.
     imoveinc.com.           14400   IN      MX      20 p2.imoveinc.com.
      ...

As expected, these systems just talk to the external world and relay 
communiques
to the internal "imoveinc.com" mail server (Lotus Notes/Domino R5).  
Right now,
the Domino server is under a bit of a load.  And we would like to have 
our external
relays just ditch any messages for non-existant recipients like:

      john at imoveinc.com
      bill at imoveinc.com
      mike at imoveinc.com
       ....


Thanks,
- Don

Am confused- do you want to reject mail to only some local valid users? 
Or reject all unknown users?  If the latter, in your main.cf file:

# REJECTING UNKNOWN LOCAL USERS
#
# The local_recipient_maps parameter specifies optional lookup tables
# with all names (not addresses) of users that are local with respect
# to $mydestination and $inet_interfaces.  If this parameter is
# defined, then the SMTP server will reject mail for unknown local
# users.
#
# If you use the default Postfix local delivery agent for local
# delivery, uncomment the definition below.
#
# Beware: if the Postfix SMTP server runs chrooted, you may have to
# copy the passwd (not shadow) database into the jail. This is
# system dependent.
#
local_recipient_maps = $alias_maps unix:passwd.byname

That is the easy part.  But when doing so, you have to tell postfix what
local users are valid.  One way to do so is by putting a symlink to
/etc/passwd under /var/spool/postfix/etc (on RH9, anyway).  For reasons I
don't remember, I have actually done a hard link but I think a symlink
will work too.

I believe that is all you need to do- but beware, if something goes wrong
and postfix can't identify the list of local users, it will 5xx reject all
incoming mail so you may want to test this carefully before implementing.

The unary file tests work for me, both in perl and in bash. Perhaps the 
problem is you don't have permisions on the files you're testing. Most 
of the files in /proc/pid/ are readable only by the process owner, so 
even though you can see them if you ls /proc/pid/ testing for their 
existence gives a permision denied error, and returns false.

They are perfectly real files as far as the system is concerned.

Also, if you're just testing for existence perhaps the -e operator would 
be the best choice.

This is a clear indication of lunch time.

I uninstalled realplayer 8. I installed realplayer 9 and libXm.so from
openmotif21-2.1.30-8.i386.rpm and when I ran realplay9 I got floating
point exception.

I don't run Red Hat anything, but your instructions here imply to me that
you've got postfix running in a chroot jail.  If that's the case, then a
symlink will not do because you can't follow symlinks out of the chroot
environment.

Sorry if I'm mistaken about the chroot, but that's the only reason I can
imagine to point /etc/aliases to another filesystem location.

Ah, the very heart of the problem!  The solution is not to see this as
defeat.  To express one's opinion once, clearly, and then let the
retorts stand, however groundlessly debasing they may be:  that takes
character.  But if we cannot heed the cries of "Peace!" from all
directions, we'll never find strength to forgo the precious Last Word.

The default Linux kernel doesn't have processor affinity (yet--there
are patches, if you're interested). Your processes will be balanced
across both CPU's automatically.

I'd never realized that the purpose of a corporate server is to
"rip, mix and burn CDs". 

How silly of me to not realize that you must have "dependable DRM features home users demand".

And how backwards I am to live without the advanced features.  Here, let Jorge tell us:

     "As I am sitting here writing this column, my computer is busily
     defragging my hard drive, running my virus scanner, and I'm being
     shown a list of all the latest MS security patches that are being
     remotely installed on my machine today. Why doesn't Linux come with
     any defragmenting tools or virus scanners or Active Backdoor Update
     like you get with Windows? These are all must-have features for me."

And for peace of mind:
    
     With Windows XP Home, I have the peace of mind that comes with
     knowing my habits and activities are being monitored by Microsoft,
     and my computer's hardware configuration and list of installed
     software is being stored in a database in Redmond.

Great satire.  I think the author should seek employement with the
Weekly World News.

Are you still there? As I read the article, I myself
was using Windows XP. Despite what some on this list
have said, after all was said and done, I couldn't get
the Promise drive controller to work with Linux on the
system I have. (Unless there is some kind of
workaround, that would limit me to "live"
distributions not needing HD access.)

Anyhow, back to the article. One advantage to Windows
is that, because of the activation requirement, people
don't dare modify their hardware. So you don't get
annoying calls from friends who tried such
modifications and don't know what they're doing.

Windows is closed source. You don't have to worry
about copyright infringement by independent
developers, as in the SCO business. I can't imagine,
though, why the author of the article didn't realize
that this means you can't make a custom kernel, and I
hardly consider this an advantage.

There were a couple of things he forgot to mention
about Windows XP. It rarely crashes, though individual
applications often do. This includes Outlook and MSIE,
two of the ones you use most often. Installing an
incompatible driver is the kiss of death: the system
won't boot. And, because the registry is NTFS and
cannot be edited by any other OS, some users have
resorted to installing multiple copies of XP as a
precaution. 

I didn't see any speed benchmarks. Those I have seen
elsewhere seem to show XP and Linux comparable in this
respect.

If you're serious about Windows, avoid reading books
about it by the MS Press. Third-party books which are
candid about the problems associated with Windows are
much more valuable.

The article is clearly satire.

Right... that was brought up in the article.  Seems like an obvious
drawback.  It's what we call a "chilling effect"... this time, on
tinkering.

Because it was a joke.

I love that "DRM that users demand" bit.  When I read stuff like that, I
don't know whether to laugh or cry, but it actually comes up in industry
statements to the public and public agencies.

  "Rock solid", "productive"? Wonder if he's been forced to shut down by the
latest winduhs virus running around the 'Net. We received about 3 dozen of
'em so far today. I just keep deleting them. Silly things, I keep trying to
open them but they just won't cooperate and infect my systems.

The command will return the PID in the second level directory, if root. 
As stated before these directories are visible to owners.

Evan,

  I tried Promethius-UML but now I'm using the Eclipse Modeling Framework
(EMF) <http://www.eclipse.org/emf/>. Eclipse is a really great IDE that
supports almost everythig (and is even larger than emacs as a result!). I
can also strongly recommend the Clay database designer from Azzurri in Japan
<http://www.azzurri.jp/>, I believe it is.

 If you code in Java or C(++?) eclipse is a very good tool to use. It's
written in java and has a ton of plug-ins.

Yes, you can grab a pic of the screen from newer GIMPs, or to be
(simple and) old-fashioned, you can make a screen capture from the
CL using the import command:

$ import -window root my_screen.jpeg

and then crop down/print the resultant picture.

That is nice.  But I don't want the OS to automatically balance.  I
want to select which processor the process will use.  I do this on our
windows servers assigning the affinity in the task manager.  I'm sure
there is some way in Linux.  I know I need the SMP processor for linux
but don't know how to tell the OS to only have this process use a
particular process only.

Is there such a way?  A tool?  A config file?  Not possible?

Thanks,

Josh

  I forgot about the imagemagick tools. Thanks. The GIMP route is the better
way, I agree.

recipients
 
 
Can anyone tell me how to configure a Postfix relay to reject messages for
specific recipients?
 
-------
 
We have 2 Postfix systems (outside of the firewalls, on different ISP's)
which
receive all e-mail for our company.  I.e.
 
     $ dig imoveinc.com mx
      ...
     ;; ANSWER SECTION:
     imoveinc.com.           14400   IN      MX      10 p5.imoveinc.com.
     imoveinc.com.           14400   IN      MX      20 p2.imoveinc.com.
      ...
 
As expected, these systems just talk to the external world and relay
communiques
to the internal "imoveinc.com" mail server (Lotus Notes/Domino R5).
Right now,
the Domino server is under a bit of a load.  And we would like to have
our external
relays just ditch any messages for non-existant recipients like:
 
      john at imoveinc.com
      bill at imoveinc.com
      mike at imoveinc.com
       ....
 
 
Thanks,

Yeah, I know.

It is possible, though you'll need heavy patching in 2.4 and moderate
patching with a 2.6 kernel.

Aside: If you really do have >= 8 processors, skip the following
paragraph as you likely know it already. Others on the list may find
it interesting. And while I think I'm right, I'm not a CE, just a
CS/Math. :-)

It's not been a highly motivated feature, because in SMP systems that
are 4-way and below, you really won't see much of a performance
difference with user-controlled processor affinity. The only small
benefit you'll get is avoiding some cache flushes. Linux already does
a good job minimizing TLB flushes (and you'll get those even in UP
systems -- it's a fact of life for "multitasking"). And on small SMP
systems, the hardware will do cacheline snooping between the
processors, minimizing a CPU jump cost. (As I understand it.) In other
words, SMP hardware is *designed* for processor hopping.

Now, what you have in Windows is a throw down from larger enterprise
situations where all this really does matter, i.e., you shouldn't use
it in Windows for quads and below, either. Like Linux, increasingly,
Windows can run on really big systems. When your RAM isn't close
enough to a processor group such that they can snoop or when RAM
fetches are going to be longer, it does make sense to hint to the
scheduler that certain applications should be held together in the
same processor(s).

If you still really, really want to, I can do some further research
for you. It will be non-trivial until well into late-2.6 or 2.8
timeframe.

Again: As I Understand It.(tm) I've followed the kernel-traffic
summaries, and I understand that all of this is covered very well in
various flavors of the kernel, but that the mainline release is still
much more conservative with respect to NUMA features.

As far as how it works, iirc in one of the patches it was something
simple like:

If we assume the process pid in question is, say "543"; and assume you
want to bind it to processor "13", you would do

echo 13 > /proc/543/processor_affinity

(Oddly, I have a PPro system who's MPS tables list the two CPU's as
"0" and "13" and none else. And /proc/cpuinfo lists them like that. Go
figure.)

Dia is a nice diagram package in general (like Visio in ways) and has
a set of UML objects. I would assume the Eclipse modules that Rich
mentioned integrate better with code generation, though.

May I kibitz and ask:

a) Why are you doing book illustrations for what don't sound like
"user manual" things at screen resolution and DPI?  Your printer does
at least 300dpi, if not 600dpi. And you'll be publishing a book at at
least 1200dpi. I suspect a non-fullscreen 72dpi illustration will look
like garbage.

b) Why aren't you using LaTeX? It would avoid having to look up odd
keystrokes and tends to do a much better job of laying out formulas
anyways. I could give you several PDF files of homework I've done for
my math degree if you'd like to see samples.

You surely have valid reasons, so I know that open discussion would
benefit the list. :-)

Oh, and if it's arbitrary diagrams and figures in addition to math,
xfig is just awesome and integrates nicely with LaTeX.

Weird.  I have a Promis controller on my file server.  It works fine.

Actually you can get source.  I used to work at a company that had a

I have seen people use a spreadsheet as a page layout program.

If people are not able to do what they need they tend to pound whatever
they have into doing what they want instead of looking for the proper

I believe the screenshot was so that he can reference the chart produced
by xfd without opening the window.

Apparently paper and all the time spent figuring out how to take the
screen shot, clip, and print it is cheaper than running another virtual
desktop.

Possible but rarely worth it.  Linux has a good scheduler.

Good summary.  Though scheduling for non-uniform memory access also
may have some benefit on HyperThreading and multicore CPUs, which is
another reason folks are paying attention to it.

Huh.  I remember being surprised upon reading that CPU affinity had been
merged a while ago.  But Google confirmed it:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/cpu-affinity/
It was merged along with Ingo's O(1) scheduler.

Martin Bligh's IBM/Sequent NUMA-Q patches were merged a while ago.
And then there's the NCR Voyager. :)

When I pass mail through sa-learn, it seems to always go to the user's

I don't understand what "the registry is NTFS" means.
It sounds like you're saying that the XP Registry is
now part of the NTFS file system.

  Tgif has verious modes for exporting both graphics and text. I set the
output so when I "print" the figure the output is .eps with embedded LaTeX
for the text.

  The book is being written in LyX, the gui front end to LaTeX that saves a
huge learning curve. Of course, I have significant amounts of pure LaTeX
(which LyX disparagingly calls ERT for Evil Red Text because it displays in
red on the screen) in the text and many mathematical equations, both inline
and in display mode. The figures are embedded in figure floats and, when I
export to pdflatex are beautifly typeset (as is the rest of the text).

> You surely have valid reasons, so I know that open discussion would
> benefit the list. :-)

  Originally, I tried using xfig but had a terrible time getting curves
(such as simulated plot output of bell curves) to look good. In my search
for a solution I discovered at least 7 different 2D vector drawing packages
for linux. Among these are tgif, ipe, dia, sketch, grace, xfig and a couple
of more I cannot remember. Each has its adherents and long-time users.

  I asked about xfig on the lyx-users mail list and my experience with
getting nice looking curves easily was confirmed. So, that was eliminated. I
could not get sketch or dia installed; some dependencies related to gnome or
kde, IIRC. IPE looked good for a while but I ran into a hurdle and couldn't
find the answer in a couple of days. Tgif is quite a simple, but powerful
package. The key to getting up to speed is to know that the button hints
don'e appear on a pop-up window, but are displayed at the left end of the
status line on the bottom of the window. And, most properties can be
controlled by clicking on the appropriate icon; they cycle through the
available options.

  Tfig's author is really great about answering questions. The documentation
consists almost exclusively of a 65-page man page (yuck!) and the FAQs on
the Web site. It took a while for me to really understand how to get the
desired Greek letters and math symbols. But, when I did I wrote it up as a
3-step process and Bill put my explanation below his on the Web page.

  Drawing curves as I want them took some trial-and-error, but I'm almost
competent in quickly getting what I want. I use polyline mode to place the
nodes in approximately the proper locations. Then I change the line type to
interpolated spline to smooth the curve and adjust the shape.

  I need to get my book, "Quantifying Environmental Impact Assessments Using
Fuzzy Logic" to my publisher, Springer-Verlag, by mid-April so as long as it
works, I don't care which tool I use. Springer-Verlag has their own set of
LaTeX macros for their monographs (my book will probably be in their
"Environmental Management Series" of monographs) and they accept
camera-ready copy using LaTeX. I'm certainly learning a lot of LaTeX and LyX
from this project!

  An editor at another publisher told a friend of mine that it is highly
unusual for Springer-Verlag to ask to publish a book by a first-time book
author. They are the premier science publisher (others focus on text books)
so I'm quite honored. Sample chapters are available for any who are
interested; I've not yet had time to add them to my Web site.

HTH,

Chris,

  The math is done in LaTeX's math mode within the body of the text. The
figures are not just arbitrary diagrams with straight lines, but curves that
represent fuzzy term sets in linguistic variables and the output fuzzy sets.
My previous answer explains that xfig is much more time consuming than is
tgif at these curves.

  Because I have not memorized the keystrokes for various symbols and
letters. I have memorized the keystrokes for (LaTeX code) \mu ('m'), \in
([Esc], N) and the Frankur 'R' that represents the set of all real numbers
([Esc], B). For the others, I need to look them up and I can't remember the
full name of the font that's required on the xfd command line.

  For those who care, attached are pngs of the symbol and plain text fonts.

As I said later, SMT. (CS word for Intel's tradename "HT".) Multicore
(which is not SMT) and amd64 fall into NUMA by definition.

Ah. Well, there we go. My mistake.

As I said later, it runs, yes. From
http://kt.zork.net/kernel-traffic/kt20031201_243.html#10 I got the
impression that more advanced stuff is out there, but has been held
back. Pre-patched FC1 kernel has it, but not mainline just yet. More
likely to see it around 2.6.2 or so and get it tested out through
2.6.8 maybe? But probably earlier than I predicted, yes.

tgif has hotkeys for LaTeX macros? Kinda interesting.

I know it's late in your development cycle, so disrupting workflow is
out of the question, but I'd highly recommend auctex-mode and
x-symbol-mode in xemacs over using LyX. Especially x-symbol-mode. It
will take things like \alpha and collapse it into a visual font
automagickally. But, it has shortcut keys as above, and you can find
out what they are by typing in the LaTeX code and then just sitting
the point right next to it and it will show you the key binding in the
minibuffer. So, e.g. \alpha is C-= a #. On top of auctex's otherwise
very helpful LaTeX support. :-)

Thank you for sharing some insight into your workflow!

  When in text mode, select from the menu: Properties -> Font -> Symbol.
That remaps the keyboard to the symbol font table. What's amusing is to look
at the xfd display of that typeface: _every_ letter is the nearest Greek
equivalent. :-) It's literally Greek to me.

  LyX does this, too. And, I don't need to learn all the LaTeX macros. For
example, making a multi-line equation with a single, large bracket on the
left of the lines. Or, setting a table within a cell of another table.

  The math is sprinkled throughout the text. For example, the first 7
chapters of the book describe environmental impact analyses as they have
been done for the first 30+ years and where contention and legal challenge
arise. No math at all. In Part II, "The Modern Approach", there is a chapter
as an introduction to fuzzy sets, fuzzy logic and approximate reasoning.
Lots of math. In the chapter on "Scoping", I describe how to use Saaty's
method of taking social values (compared pair-wise across the entire set) in
a square matrix, calculate the principal eigen value, and use the associated
eigen vector to come up with what Yager developed: an ordered, weighted
average (OWA). Again, lots of math.

  LyX makes it fast and easy. At least, once I learn little tricks such as
how to move within a math box. Hey! It's intuitive! :-)

Steve,

Thanks for the pointer.  Other (non-mail system) projects are co-opting 
my time to
work on this, but I suspect the "local_recipient_maps"  parameter is 
what I need.

Without some experimentation, I'm not 100% sure it will work, as the 
actual mail
recipients don't have accounts on the relays.  But it sounds like just 
creating a
simple map of allowable usernames/addresses will work.  (Damn, another 
list to
maintain ... oh, well, it'll be less work than the SASL database 
required for the
road warriors SMTPAuth service on these boxes. :-) )

As Jeme mentioned, for the chroot'd daemon, you had to use the hard link 
since
the chroot environment won't follow a symlink out of it's "jail".

I shoulda posted this question months ago.  :-)

Well, the names aren't in a list.  And the internal Domino R5 mail 
server does
"fuzzy" name matching, and it can't be turned off.  Hence, when a bozo sends
mail to a common first name like "bob at imoveinc.com" or "mary at imoveinc.com"
the blasted thing doesn't just say "no such user" and bounce the message, it
does it's best to find someone with a first/last name which approximates 
"bob"
or "mary".  So, the problem now is to figure out how to have the Postfix 
relays
(which actually receive the incoming mail) pre-qualify the addressee(s).  I
think Steve Raymond gave me the answer (Postfix' local_recipient_maps 
parameter),
and I hope to try it out soon.

- Don

P.S.  By the way ... I'm not sure "IncrediMail" is going to make the 
"survival

hard to do
a clean reply on mailling lists such as this one.  Any chance you can 
configure
it to only send ASCII/text messages to "plug at lists.pdxlinux.org"?

Okay, now I have to know the answer to the following question.  I
understand somewhat that the purpose for chroot running a daemon it is
safer because the daemon can't see outside of its jail.  Question is then,
how do I determine if it is running chrooted or not?  (is that the right
way to phrase it?)

Does anyone know if Fedora Core 1 defaults to running Postfix chrooted?  I
think it does so, as one time I tried it out my Postfix config didn't work
and someone told me that was because it was running chrooted on FC1 but
_not_ RH9 (which am currently using).  So my second question, does FC1 by
default run Postfix chrooted while RH9 does not?  Or is there some other
difference in Postfix implementation between FC1 and RH9?

Thanks!!

Message-ID: <B52C1E7AE3795B499FF6DD3C957E762E26BCB4@odin.clark.edu>

Dear All,

 

I'm the UNIX / Linux program coordinator here at Clark College in
Vancouver.  The program is hoping to serve students who would like to
make their way into UNIX / Linux sys admin or technician jobs in our
area.  I would like to ask the help of this list in determining what
topics should be included in the program.  It would be great to have a
dialog about this on this list, but I would also hope to have face to
face meetings with those of you who can.

 

Here are topics our current (4 quarter) UNIX / Linux Certificate offers:

 

pc hardware fundamentals / repair

bash command line fundamentals

host system admin & security fundamentals

network admin & security fundamentals

bash shell programming

sed & awk

C

Perl

Java

UNIX system call programming interface (in C)

 

as well as general ed requirements

 

As you can see, there's only so much you can squeeze into 4 terms.  Do
we have our priorities straight?  What do you suggest?  Also we expect
that many certificate grads will already have an AS in Computer Network
Admin (CNET) or Software Solutions Development (SSD).  We are also
considering expanding the Certificate Program into an AS degree - a 6
quarter sequence.

 

These are all pretty much introductory courses, and may change depending
on what kind of feedback we get from you.  A graduate of this program
would hopefully be someone who would be eligible for consideration as an
assistant system administrator / technician.  So the question becomes:

 

What topics / skills are needed to qualify as an entry level sys admin
assistant / technician?  Otherwise, what sort of position would the
above courses qualify a graduate for?

 

If you have suggestions that are way different or way more detailed than
this, I really want to hear about it!

 

Any help you can provide on or off this list is greatly appreciated,

 

Mark

  This is not OS specific and quite probably not as good use of time as are
other topics.

  Whew! What a mis-mash. I'm not a computer professional, but I've held
faculty positions at universities and taught both undergraduate and graduate
training. I'd like to offer my ideas; I'm sure the professional SysAdmins
will chime in with practical advice.

> As you can see, there's only so much you can squeeze into 4 terms.  Do we
> have our priorities straight?  What do you suggest?

  First, start off with a course in operating systems (very general) and
linux/UNIX overviews. What an OS does, what components it has, filesystems,
permissions, disk organization and so on. Andy Tannenbaum's book is probably
too out of date, but there was a relatively recent one called "Linux A-Z"
that was excellent. (I just sent it to a colleague I'm trying to
defenestrate so I don't recall the author's name.) This is the basis for
your systems administration and security training.

  Then have a course in TCP/IP networking. Cover all of networking, from
physical topology and media to administration and security. Flavor as
desired.

  Third, introduce shells (bash and others). Include shell scripting and
lead into the use of other administrative scripting languages such as perl
and python. sed and awk would fit into this portion, too, as they are all
related.

  Fourth, discuss the differences among linux distributions, the *BSDs
(including OpenBSD for it's solid security), solaris and other unices that
still have legs. Your graduates will probably need to work in different
environments and understanding the differences between BSD-style init script
and Sys-V init scripts, where files are found on the filesystems and so on
will be more valuable to them than programming languages.

  The SysAdmins I know and admire don't do either systems or applications
programming. Drop the C, java and system calls (that would be covered in the
language courses in any case). As Paul pointed out so well a couple of weeks
ago, the SysAdmins are the maintenance engineers in the computer hierarchy.
Programmers have a different role.

up out of screen save, about 30 seconds is spent in "slow redraw mode".
It feels like everything is being rebuilt out of swap disk or something.
This may be because  nightly backups using rsync are really thrashing
the machines, so indeed every user process may be getting swapped out. 
It may be something else.  Anyone else see this?

This is a minor annoyance, but it irks me that a computer has a
harder time waking up than I do.  Should I be looking for some
kind of misconfiguration?  Can I run an "unswap the apps" script
after backups?  Should I pour hot coffee on the CPU?  Should I
just chill out and meditate for 30 seconds?

Type A and luvin' it;

Mark,

The topics/courses you list are all good and necessary, and I know
that focusing your students on acquiring technical skills needs to be
the heart of your curriculum. The topics I'm going to suggest are less
worthy of a course and more like meta-emphases applicable to many of
them:

* scaling

  Once you've got one system working well, how are you going to
  transfer your efforts to other systems? Configuration management,
  version control, and remote monitoring would be key topics here.

* documentation

  This is a subset of scaling, I suppose, but it deserves special
  mention. How do you document what you've done for a) management, b)
  users, and c) colleagues? The amount of wheel reinvention that goes
  on among sysadmins is staggering :-(

* communication

  - with management: How do you help company management make good IT
    decisions? How do you report on your work?

  - with users: How do you find out how well your systems are meeting
    users' expectations? How do you provide help-desk service? What
    medium of communication (verbal, hands-on, e-mail) is expected?

  - with community: How do you discover and adhere to standards (e.g.,
    RFCs, standard protocols, etc.)? How do you discover what help the
    technical community can offer? How do you provide help in return?

  I found it much better to log out at the end of the day. The next morning,
I log in, 'startx' and wait a short time while xfce loads and reloads all
the apps (10 desktops and a bunch of applications running). For some reason
I never figured out, the more recent versions of mozilla won't auto load.
Shrug. So I go to that desktop and click the panel icon.

  In the meantime, I go through the daily ritual when I first sit at my
desk: the dogs need their morning start-the-work-day-treat. It comes in two
parts: a rawhide, then a biscuit. If I don't play their game they sit there,
stare at me and complain that they thought they had me trained better than
this. So I don't mind the time it takes X to come up (perhaps a half
minute?).

You do understand. (That is, you can't get to it from
a non-NTFS installation, if it needs to be altered in
order for XP/NT/2000 to boot.) By the way, this might
not always be true. Linux can read from NTFS, but
write access is still experimental.

The same thing used to happen to me until I reduced the size of my swap, 
it was 2G because I had the vague idea that more was better.  I reduced 
my swap size to the 1/2 size of ram (I have 512M ram, so 256M) and the

IME, a good sysadmin has a working knowledge of C -- this is
particularly important in the "Open Source Age". When there isn't
documentation, or when you're trying to figure out why the system
software is behaving in a peculiar way, it helps tremendously to
actually be able to "RTFS" as they say. One need not be able to build
software from the grond up, but being able to read and interpret code
as well as hack it a bit is invaluable as a sysadmin.

Plus, if you have to learn C and Perl and understand the subtle
differences between them, you have all the tools to be able to hack
just about any source out there. Kind of like learning Latin and, say,
Spanish and then being able to grok just about any other Romantic
language.

Plus plus, C is stricter than Perl, in general, so it will provide a
good mindset for writing more robust Perl scripts.

As I understand it, twice is better, but at least equivalent amount of
swap. The current kernels reserve the right to map every address in
RAM to swap, whether or not it's actually swapped out at the time. If
you have less swap, both the probably of processes being dismissed by
the kernel increases and level of "during the day" swap activity
increases.

If I'm wrong, I welcome someone to update my "brainbase" :)

You had a lot of good points here, Rich.

I had a college unix systems administration class back in (ouch) 1992 or
so. It was a very hands-on, lab work-based course and it really got me
hooked in the field.

Now that I think about it, I took the required prerequisite for it,
which was something like "Intro to UNIX and C programming". That one
covered the real basics, thinks like ls and all of its switches, basic
regular expressions via grep & sed, a bit of awk, the basics of job
control.

If you're not really focused, this could stretch to a few semesters,
especially if you're going to talk about security and layer 1 and 2
stuff. I would probably stick to layer 3, with just enough
Ethernet-specific layer 2 work to explain arp, packet forwarding, etc.

Using bash is fine, and it is my favorite user shell, but for the
purposes of this class I'd probably stick to just the "sh" compatible
subset of features for shell scripting.

Is it the purple Evi Nemeth book that has the big section on how to
perform common tasks on different flavors? Regardless, the Nemeth book
might make a good, albeit very expensive text to use.

So, what you are saying is that you can't get to it from an OS that 
doesn't understand NTFS.

The registry is still just a flat file, sitting on the file system.

That's why Bill made the Windows CD with a recovery console. Although, 
I'm sure it doesn't fix everything, and we could probably come up with a 
case or two that the recovery console doesn't help.

There ARE other things you can do (copy the .dat file to another OS, 
etc). In fact, I once wrote a how-to on how to compress and reindex your 
Windows 95 registry when I worked for one of the large software 
companies. Just like most databases, removed registry entries are NOT 
gone... Just marked as deleted, and ignored by the system. Just one of 
the reasons Windows gets slower as time goes on.

Also one of the reasons I run Linux. :)

The Recovery Console is very limited in what it can do. For example,
there is not text editor.

Stafford,

  Don't know the answer to your question. However, I found Marcel Gagnon's
Linux SysAdmin book very valuable. He explains things I had read, but using
different words and approaces. It made a lot of things clear to me. Of
course, I'm doing this stuff only part time so I have a different
perspective.

Hmm.  If it is swap, you could try to just toggle it off and on.  E.g.:

  # /sbin/swapoff -a ; /sbin/swapon -a

A chrooted process cannot follow the symlink out of the jail.
And I recall a bug that lets a chrooted process get out of the jail
if a hardlink to an outside file is provided.

Best instead to either copy the passwd file via cron or as part of a
new user script.

There is some theory that is correct.  I saw it somewhere in the

Since I use cyrus and amavisd, all mail gets filtered by a system user

Nice article, too bad they forgot to mention the vast number of

That is how I accomplished things, as well.  I also set up some
scripting so when I forward email to 'spam' it is piped through a perl
script to extract the embedded RFC/822 (or was it 882?  I forget)
forward attachment, take that, pipe it through another perl script to
clean up the headers for sa-learn, then it gets piped through to
sa-learn.

I also used to check the quarantined spam for any ham, then manually
process all of them through sa-learn... but I've received about 4500
spams in the last week or so... making much too large a list to
effectively check by hand.  When I can't do an "ls spam*" in the
directory, you know it's too much spam.

Of those ~4500 spams, about four have gotten through to my inbox.  :-(

Are there UNIX/Linux sysadmin/technician jobs in our area?  If so,

I saw one in the paper over the weekend.  Seems that most of them also

This is indeed what has happened.  All the file access has caused the
kernel to expand its filesystem buffers and swap out "unused" applications
to make room for them.

My solution:

# swapoff -a

Supposedly the 2.6 kernel will handle this situation better.

Thank you for taking the time to use this list to help mold your
requirements. I think it would also be of benefit to take a look at the
requirements for LPI (Linux Professional Institute) certifications.  I
don't think a course track dedicated towards getting a student a cert
would be the best way to teach, but their outline may be of use.

On the other hand, LPI has spent much energy dipping into what coporations
are looking for in linux engineering.  If you goal was a trade based
education track, the LPI outline might server a greater purpose.

A ha!  This is what I do, too (on the system intended here, anyway).

So you just run sa-learn as the amavis user.

Cool.

find the in.ftpd executable on the ftp server and run the following:

ldd /path/to/in.ftpd

chances are you need to install the shared lib via rpm or source or
whatever that your ftp daemon is looking for...

openssl (*hint*)

Yeah, lots of stuff got left out.

I can see how it ended up being a very, very basic introduction, but it's
still disappointing.

I spoke with the author for a couple of hours on the greater social
implications of Free Software, the history, and how some of the ideals
translate into other parts of life.  All of it was ignored.

I don't recall, but did Stallman even get mentioned in the article?  No
GNU, no nothing.

The journalist seemed very interested in hearing about it at the time, but
threw it all out when it came time to start writing.

Where do you set that?

I think that's what I'd do for my users on my home systems (as opposed to
the amavis solution that I'm implementing for a client).

'tis a bummer... but something you must live with in binary
distributions; dependencies.  libssl - openssl.  Your ftp daemon is
linked against openssl, but the library isn't there.

Check your SSL install.

Also, have you thought about using scp instead of ftp?  It's *so* much
easier!  And secure. :-)

Also, have you considered using a package management system that
automatically handles dependency resolution so you don't have to deal with
stuff like this?

The way I read the article, it is intended as an examination of local
contributiors to the Linux movement. That's why they focused on people
like Paul, Cliff, and Oso rather than RMS.

BTW, the online version mentions RMS in the sidebar:

"Linux is governed by the General Public License, devised by American
programmer Richard Stallman. The GPL is sometimes called a "copyleft."

Is that all? At last count, I've gotten 269 copies of various sorts and

John, reading your emails is quite painfull on the eyes, is there anyway
you can not use hotmail?  All the carriage returns show up in mutt as
you can see above making reading an email not fun to say the least.

I personally was unaware that hotmail used carriage returns in their
emails until I read a few of yours.  Doesn't surprise me though.  Oh
well..

And I understand that and accept it.  But the author hadn't yet fully
decided on the tack he was going to take for the article when we spoke and
I feel like he took one of the least interesting approaches.

We actually had a little talk about how the WW seems to always be 10 years
behind the times.  This article is a good example of one that could have
been written ten years ago without too much difference (except the depth
of saturation, but that's sort of what makes it no longer "news").  So
while the direction the story took is totally understandable and in line
with the history of the WW, I kind of thought we might see something more
ground-breaking on this one.

Hope springs eternal, I guess.

By the way, I didn't think the article should focus on Stallman, just that
the concept of Free Software combined with the easy, ubiquitous networking
of the modern age are the reason something like Linux can take hold and
drives the development of all the other projects mentioned in the article.
The article continues the common misconception that Linux is an operating
system and not just a kernel and nothing is done to alter the other great
misconception that an operating system includes a windowing environment,
session management, spoolers, a web browser, and all the other cruft
Microsoft says it is.

I love the fact that there are great projects here in Portland and I
totally respect everybody involved in those projects, but personality
pieces don't really cut it as public education in my book and the article
just seemed to gloss over a few things that might actually help people
understand things better.

I'm really sleepy, so the words aren't flowing properly at the moment..
but hopefully I'm getting the idea across.

It isn't hotmail causing the problems, it is Incredimail, an OE addon.

                                ^^^^^^^^

I am wondering if this is the problem.

On the fedora site:

        ls *ftp*                    
        ftp-0.17-18.i386.rpm                   ncftp-3.1.6-2.i386.rpm
        ftpcopy-0.6.2-3.i386.rpm               tftp-0.33-2.i386.rpm
        gftp-2.0.14-5.i386.rpm                
        tftp-server-0.33-2.i386.rpm
        lftp-2.6.5-4.i386.rpm                  vsftpd-1.2.0-5.i386.rpm

I grabbed the only ftp server (vsftp), but there is no in.ftpd

        rpm -qlip vsftpd-1.2.0-5.i386.rpm | grep bin
        /usr/sbin/vsftpd

So, my guess is your system is running in.ftpd, or via inetd and its not
a fedora package.

Ignore Jeme's silly whine about dependencies.  RPM handles these quite
well (apt/yum/up2date handles the install better).

you can test on the system with

        rpm -qRif /usr/sbin/in.ftpd

Which will tell you which files are required and who owns the package.

>From an old system I see:
        rpm -qiRf --root=/mnt/g3 /usr/sbin/in.ftpd

        Summary     : An FTP daemon provided by Washington University.
        Description :
        The wu-ftpd package contains the wu-ftpd FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
        server daemon.  The FTP protocol is a method of transferring files
        between machines on a network and/or over the Internet.  Wu-ftpd's
        features include logging of transfers, logging of commands, on the fly
        compression and archiving, classification of users' type and location,
        per class limits, per directory upload permissions, restricted guest
        accounts, system wide and per directory messages, directory alias,
        cdpath, filename filter and virtual host support.
        
        Install the wu-ftpd package if you need to provide FTP service to remote
        users.
        fileutils  
        inetd  
        /bin/sh  
        ld-linux.so.2  
        libc.so.6  
        libcrypt.so.1  
        libdl.so.2  
        libnsl.so.1  
        libpam.so.0  
        libresolv.so.2  
        /usr/bin/perl  
        libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.0)  
        libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.1)  
        libcrypt.so.1(GLIBC_2.0)  
        libresolv.so.2(GLIBC_2.0)  

If you really upgraded RH8->Fedora1 I could imagine the --force options
foobaring the check for the removed dependencies.  Sovle which package
you have first, then worry about SSL.

And really, ditch ftp for ssh/scp/sftp/rsync.....

I emailed him.  He cut large chunks out to fit into the article.

I thought it was excellent for a WW style newspaper.

We actually I do a bit more.  I only care about me (I get the most mail)
so I only extra-learn from me (amavis is learning all the time).  As
root I grab mail from the cyrus files, chown it to amavis, razor the
uncaught spam (I have hand verified it), and then copy the caught spam
(I check the folder first, well sometimes), I copy it over, then I learn
it as spam.  Then I learn my HAM, which is very very litte.

My only problem is SA not catching mails titled like:

                          Subject: 
Re: CXUT, shop where bread

I had to up my level over 6 and this triggers 5.5:

X-Spam-Status:  No, hits=5.5 tagged_above=-999.0 required=6.3
tests=BAYES_99, HTML_MESSAGE

So my Bayes is dead on, but nothing else is triggering.  I have been
meaning to write a regex for SA to handle this.


spam_learn:
#!/bin/bash
echo "Removing Spam"
rm -f /tmp/spam/*
echo "Copying spam_notcaught"
cp -vpra /var/spool/imap/user/zot/spam_notcaught/[0-9]*\. /tmp/spam/
echo "chowning it...."
chown amavis.amavis /tmp/spam/*
echo "razoring it...."
su - amavis -c "razor-report -f /tmp/spam/*"
echo "Copying spam_notcaught"
cp -vpra /var/spool/imap/user/zot/spam/[0-9]*\. /tmp/spam/
chown amavis.amavis /tmp/spam/*
echo "Learn'n it."
su - amavis -c "sa-learn --showdots --spam --dir /tmp/spam/"

echo "Copying HAM"
rm -f /tmp/ham/*
cp -vpra /var/spool/imap/user/zot/spam_not/[0-9]*\. /tmp/ham/

Did you upgrade the server or the client?  You can diagnosis the 
dependency problem by finding: a) what package is the FTP server

rpm -qf /usr/sbin/in.ftpd

b) what version of libssl it requires

rpm -q --requires <ftpd server package> | grep ssl

c) what version of openssl is installed

rpm -q openssl

d) what version of libssl it provides.

rpm -q --provides openssl

e) if anything provides libssl.so.2

rpm -q --whatprovides libssl.so.2

My guess of what happened is that the server was running wu-ftpd or 
proftpd as FTP server.  Fedora Core 1 only has vsftpd.  The FC1 
installer force upgraded openssl.  The orhpaned ftpd was left without 
its ssl libraries.

The solution is to install the openssl06b package.  It provides the 
libssl.so.2 library for RH8 and older packages.  Another option is to 
use the included vsftpd server.  If you are using wu-ftpd, you should 
definitely consider it since vsftpd is more secure.  If you were using 
proftpd, you can find a FC1 package from freshrpms.net.

RPM keeps track of dependencies for Fedora.  The installer likely 
screwed up the dependencies for the old package when doing the upgrade. 
    I would call that an installer bug that results from turning off 
dependency checking when installing core packages.  If the installer was 
smart it would have installed the compatibility package.

Fedora includes yum which does dependency resolution.  yum doesn't have 
a way to check for broken dependencies.  But it does have a way to find 
dependencies: "yum provides libssl.so.2" will find the openssl096b 
provides the wayward library.

Fedora (and Red Hat) can also use apt for rpm.  APT will definitely 
diagnosis the problem with "apt-get check".  I don't think it will 
automatically fix the problem.

I  don't know how you did that "ls *ftp*".  I did the time consuming
"yum search ftp" and got same results.  So since I was using wu-ftpd,
which comes with RH8, I came to the same conclusion. I considered Rob's
idea of scp, and will eventually go there, but, for X's sake I just
wanted to move some files around my lan(as far as I know, I don't offer
any services to the outside world).

Nope, as I explained, I was running wu-ftpd, inherited from RH8.  Since 
I want to go with Fedora, I elected to dump wu-ftpd and install vsftpd.

I "yum install vsftpd"d and it worked, sort of. It only allowed
anonymous login's which is not what I wanted.

After swimming around in a deep sea of "I almost understand that", I got
it working the way I want.  Since I'm grateful for anyone that takes the
time to do these package thingies, I'm loath to criticise, but I think
the package install is not quite right for Fedora.  I had to read the
tar documentation, "Install", in order to get it working.  It's
installed so that you have to copy an example "conf" file into /etc, and
vsftpd.xinetd file into /etc/xinetd.d and edit it.  Also
/etc/vsftpd.conf has to have at least one line changed to run under
xinetd. If I were doing this as a package for Fedora, which I presume is
going to use xinetd, I would make these part of the initial install.  I
don't know how to handle the change to non-anoymous only.  I guess you
just have to know to read the "conf" file.

It's interesting that the offender "libssl.so.2" didn't show up.

I'm grepping through some log files for some numbers.  

What can I do to total the values and print that out....  I'm sure there
is a simple solution, it's just escaping me right now...

Subject: [PLUG] Network Config question
Message-ID: <BAY9-F27Vvjvxo6AmX30009a13d@hotmail.com>

Dear All:

I am trying to reconfigure my network at home.  I am not a network guru so
I wanted some input as to what kind of things I should use.
Here is what I want to configure:


Cable modem   ------- router which does DHCP server ----- machine1 eth0
                                                                        |    
          machine1 eth1 ------   machine2 eth0
                                                                        |
                                                                        
|--------- machine3 eth0


So I want all 3 machines to receive IP that are assigned from DHCP router,
including machine 1 eth1.  machine1 is a Linux box with 2 interfaces.
eth1 connects with another linux box, machine2.

Should I use IP Masquerate?  I actually read into it a bit
and do not think I should because it seems that machine1
will then need to maintain a subnet of its own for its eth1 and machine2 
eth0.

Any tips/pointers much appreciated.

Brute force:

[mark at caprice mark]$ sum=0; for n in `grep missing messages*|awk '{print 
$7}'`; do let 'sum = sum + n'; done; echo $sum

Must have the last command, i.e. echo $sum, on the same line as the "done" 
statement.

grep missing messages*|awk '{print $7}'

Sean,

  You're on the right track, but you need to have awk accumulate those
numbers in a variable. the grey book has a short program to do that, I'll
look in the morning. I'd put the program in a file, then pipe the grep
results to awk specifying the file with the '-f' option.

Eh, I'm not surprised.. are you?  The article is in WW after all: it's a

Then evaluate that with your favorite lisp.

$ clisp /tmp/numbers

6      
# or whatever that sum is...

Emacs's *scratch* buffer is great for this also, drop in the numbers,
wrap them in a big (+ ... ) and hit C-j on the last paren.

Heh, pigscanfly caused me so much frustration that I just got my own
server to run UMLs off of.  To help w/ the cost I rent them out to
friends and friends of friends here & there.  There're a few slots
left if anyone's interested.  The kernel's 2.4, the distro Debian
Woody or Sarge (tho I think I could manage a Fedora one too).
Accounts are $5/mo for 64MB RAM (half swap, half real), 1GB disk
space, 5 GB bandwidth.  Multiply that by 2 if you need more RAM/space
($10/mo for 128MB RAM, $20/mo for 256, etc, etc).  You'll get your own
IP too, but just one as we're running short.

It's probably in some preference setting somewhere. Mozilla mail allows

Very simple. Doesn't even need any additional commands even...  This
should suggest which documentation to look at...

> grep missing messages*|awk '{print $7}'

Hmm...






















Depending upon which `awk` man page you've got there is an example of
exactly what you're trying to do.

grep missing messages*|awk '{count+=$7} END {print count}'

Now the question is how I managed to be the first one to mention this.

Well, he asked if it worked "from" the command line.

It was a testing question... i.e. is realplayer workin.

trplayer is a gui-free version of realplayer built to help blind
people.  It is also useful for cron jobs and timeshifting real streams.

Is there a reason you are multi-homing that box?

I'd just make the "router" something like an IPCOP or Shorewall 
firewall/router, and hang a switch off that, plugging all three 
computers into the hub. My personal favorite is IPCOP[1], but there are 
MANY options out there.

That'll work, but the BEGIN clause is superfluous.  Variables default
to zero anyway, so it can reduce to:

  $ awk '/missing/ { total += $7 } END { print total }' messages*

If it was me, I'd be too lazy (when doing ad hoc stuff anyway) to type
out all five letters in "total", so I'd probably stick to something
shorter like "a", e.g.:

  $ awk '/missing/ { a += $7 } END { print a }' messages*

I've never actually tried out on of these little integrated

no, variables default to null.  if no lines match, then your
version prints a blank line instead of 0.  another way of getting
0 is to say
    END { print total + 0 }
but I think that's conceptually weirder than using BEGIN to set
the initial value to 0.  initialization is a simple idea, it
transfers to any language.

I don't think there is a general consensus so much as a mess of differing
opinions.  Here's a survey of some of the most popular and my take on
them:

1) Make swap 2x RAM

This is a very old rule of thumb, dating back from the PDP-11 days of
UNIX.  This kind of made sense once upon a time when RAM was hideously
expensive and the servers had a massively multiuser workload.  It was
important that things that remained unused were moved out of the way for
things that needed the RAM during the present.

I don't think this is a good rule for workstations (more on this later).

2) Make swap 1x RAM

On some UNIX systems if they don't have at least 1x swap, the system
doesn't use all the physical memory.  (HP-UX is like this by default)

I don't think Linux ever had this problem.

3) Make swap some small fixed size (i.e. 100MB)

This gives the system some small amount of room to swap out things that
are truly unused, but not so much that you're waiting large amounts of
time for things to be swapped back in.

If I have problems with option (4) below, this is where I go next.

4) Don't make any swap

If you have "plenty" of RAM this is the highest performance option.
However, if you ever see kscand hogging the CPU and system performance get
choppy, you'll know that you no longer have "plenty" of RAM and you may
want to get more (or turn on swap).  This choice eliminates the problem of
the kernel swapping out programs to make room for more disk buffers.
(This happens a lot on workstations, particularly if they run nightly
backups.  All the file activity coupled with litte or no application
activity fools the kernel into thinking all those apps you'll need the
next morning are "unused".)

Ahh, the old "peanuts and toilet paper" salary. That's OK. When the
company goes tits up the software they were developing will still be
available and all the hard work won't be for naught. That's the beauty

If you don't mind a running summary:

perl -lane 'print ($a += $F[6]) if /missing/;' messages*

If you'd rather run use two processes instead of one:

Please respond via the list. Thanks for understanding.

You can use your linux box as a hub, but I wouldn't want to do this. It 
increases the likelyhood of computer 2 or 3 losing their connection to 
the 'net. With hubs being as inexpensive as they are, it's easier to get 
a hub and plug each computer into that instead of daisy chaining computers.

Also with this kind of setup, you will have a much more difficult 
configuration. In addition, I'm not sure the second and third nic in 
computer 1 would be able to get an address via DHCP.

I would agree with this, in fact I think most of the "cable/dsl routers"
that are on the market have 4 ethernet ports.

So 
                    /--[computer 1]
--[modem]--[router]<---[computer 2]
                    \--[computer 3]

I would only multihome through another linux box if you were making it
the firewall and were interested in learning about security/routing/etc.

Then
                                              /--[computer 2]
--[modem]--[Linux Firewall/computer 1]--[hub]<---[computer 1]

Ah, yeah.  In 15 years of awk use, that distinction has never bitten
me, but then the majority of my usage is ad hoc command-line stuff
where I am intelligent enough (but only just) to disambiguate.  In a
script, where something else is depending on a number, the distinction
would be more important.

Thank you for the correction!

Russell, I use a linksys router similar to this one. It is great. It is easy to configure, small in size, and it works. The biggest difference between this and the linux based solution is the size of the box, once it is up and running.

My favorite lines:

At a 20-year celebration for the IBM PC, Bradley was on a panel with
Microsoft founder Bill Gates and other tech icons. The discussion turned
to the keys.

"I may have invented it, but Bill made it famous," Bradley said.

Gates didn't laugh. The key combination also is used when software, such
as Microsoft's Windows operating system, fails.


Thanks, Rich, I needed that.

The hotel my family stayed in down in Texas after I graduated BMT had
'net access.  It was just some CAT5 and DHCP magic.

It might be wireless, it might be a Ethernet jack that gets to the Internet 
through the hotel DSL line.  

Usually you can ssh to your office.

When I was in Sidney Montana recently (pop 1,200 and big for the area) the hotel
had a Win95 box in the lobby on DSL for customer Internet access.  For ssh to 
the world:

	http://www.google.com
	search "putty download" click on "I'm feeling lucky"
	click on link for putty.exe
	select option to run from server
	ssh away!

The same technique can work from airport Internet kiosks.

Same thing with a motel (Best Western?) in Klamath that I stayed at. 
Plugged in, ran my dhcp client and I was connected.

I guess I should of added that it was provided free of surcharge where I
was at, but a charge isn't unexpected.

Rob/Mark/Brandon/Mike,

  Many thanks for the same answer. This now brings up a pertinent question:
is there some documentation I can read so I can convert my Slackware-9.1
notebook from static IP address (which is what I use here) and DHCP? I don't
mind manually swapping config files, but I've never set up dhcp so I have no
experience on what needs to be changed and how best to organize it all.

  I need to think about this some more. I suppose that with such a
connection, unlike dialing with a modem, I don't go through my shell account
at my ISP but directly to my firewall and server. The firewall is configured
to allow access only to me and the server's /etc/hosts.allow shows only my
domain and that of my ISP.

  Well, I have almost 2 weeks before my first trip to Corvallis for a
meeting so there's time to get this all worked out.

Thanks,

Rich

When I was running a static-ip network without DHCP (now I'm running a
pleasant mixture with a DHCP server always there for ease of setup of
new computers) I just ran dhcpcd eth0 when I wanted to use DHCP.  Make
sure the DHCP client daemon is installed on your system.

Otherwise, you could edit /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1.conf, but for something
like this, I'd just run the command manually.

OK, running courier-imap and I'm a bit confused.

Folks running MS Outlook clients don't actually delete their mail when
they delete it.  Their client lists it as deleted and it is indicated with
strike-through text, but it's still on the server.

How does it purge?

Anyone?

"Plenty" is a very relative term,  I have 512 MB in my workstation, but
I don't consider it to be plenty.  My kids would much rather use my
system instead of their own (they each have their own dual boot systems,
but mine is faster), so I have at least 4 different X sessions open at
the same time, with all kinds of programs loaded up.

What I've seen happen when the system runs out of memory is that
processes will be killed by the kernel, no warning, just gone.

With that much RAM, what I've been doing is setting up 2 swap
partitions, each about half the physical RAM.  This gives you a little
flexibility when trying to find the best compromise with the swap size. 
I personally think that if you have to swap more than your physical RAM,
you really should increase the amount of physical RAM (just from a
performance point of view).

The systems I've seen that have "plenty" of RAM and a swap file usually
put about 1 MB in the swap, and leave it at that.  These systems will
also show more than that as free (unused) RAM, they will also have huge
reserves for buffers and caches.

The only scenario that a larger than RAM swap makes sense is if you are
short on RAM (indicated by processed being killed off) and performing is
more important than performance (in other words, is a slow but working
machine better than a fast but limited machine).

To recap, having a large swap file with lots of RAM won't really hurt
you, unless you are actually using it a lot.  The advantage is that
performance will degrade, but the processes will keep running,  instead
of the alternative, which is processes being killed off.

HTH,

The client has an "Empty Trash" or something similar that has to be run
to truly delete the files (same sort of thing with Evolution).  My
clients hate it, but since they refuse to change to a different mailer,
they are stuck with having to manually empty the garbage.  I have one
client that was using these emails that were "garbage" as his history
(talk about the wrong way to use a poorly written app).

Anyway, HTH.

What Rob said, but it's a good idea to down the interface first before
running dhcpcd.  Otherwise, sounds like we've got a similar setup.

Outlook can be configured to empty the trash when the program is closed.

The Portland Holiday Inn off of I-205 and Stark area has 4 wireless access 
points using a captive portal username/login scheme - you get the 
username/password on checkin, and once you authenticate thru the portal you 
can do just about anything you'd expect to.  I did not have a linux box when 
I was visiting, so I am unable to address the specific configuration 
questions you may have. 

If you plan on travelling, be aware of whether the hotel you are visiting 
has hardwired or wireless access, so you can be prepared with the 
appropriate NIC.

Ryan,

  I don't have a wireless pcmcia-NIC. I don't see a need for wireless. So,
I'll bring a small cat5 cable and my regular modem cable.

  If I can figure out how to get my Kyocera QCP-6035 working with a
supplemental serial port NIC I'd have the problems solved: just use the cell
phone as a wireless modem.

Thanks,

Rich

  Good point, Mark. The network interface comes up during boot if a cable is
attached; at least it tries. I could issue 'ifdown eth0' just to be sure,
and check that there is no active ethernet interface before trying to get a
dynamic IP address.

  When I'm done with the connection, do I 'killall dhcpcd' or 'ifdown eth0'
or something else?

Thanks,

Works for me, far more times than it should. :)

The only problem I've had is that the Delta Crown Rooms have a web
proxy so they don't run local DNS.  I had to ssh knowing the IP
address of my box, which I now know how to look up (whois.net), or
sometimes I just remember.

I've had one place that had a DNS intercept that returned their A
record even for non-existent hostnames.  This was a problem for me on
some ssh'ing I was doing, because my ssh client was doing a IPv6 DNS
lookup for my home box, and it believed the IPv4 address (theirs) that
came back.  Evil.

Other than that, usually no problem these days.  Your port 25 might be
blocked, but ssh tunnelling will get around that.

Randal,

  If you write the IP address on the inside of your eyelid, then you need
only close your eye to see it. No need to remember.

You really have to take it with a grain of salt and call the hotel.

In the last 6 months, most of the places that I have stayed have had
"High Speed Internet Access have been fine", but

one hotel had 10 proprietary wireless pcmcia cards, and if you weren't
one of the first 10 people you were screwed.

another hotel had HSI access it was webtv.....

A third one had it but the first time I stayed there it didn't work in
my room.  I stayed there again a few days later (the reservation had
been made previously and it was only one night) and it worked in a
different room.

It's a crap shoot, and the front desk isn't going to be any help.
But if you do get a port and you get a lease, I haven't had many
problems.  I would however install a firewall.  I've been using
firestarter and I like it's flexibility.

You can release your lease with dhcpcd -k

Real men <beating my chest in an ape-like fashion> have mindterm
on a box that allows 0/0 http & ssh access. Why go through all
the trouble of installing software when java is usually enabled?

Travel war stories/tips:

Linux Expo Toronto (2000), I was with a number of people who (then and
now) hold high positions in the free-software world were "escorted"
out of the onlinejobs.com (or some other "hot at the time" job search
company) office for trying to hack the kiosk in their lobby. I managed
to break out using mindterm just seconds before the security guy 
showed up...

Many of the charge-for-DSL/Wireless setups I've seen only block
port 80, a few do DNS as well. If you know the IP address of a
server you have SSH access to, such info may not be be releavant.

At LWCE NY, we had an interesting experience. The SSID was 
"surf here", but it was really flaky. We managed to see that
port 80 was redirected to a "signup here" page. We called the
support number listed to complain that we were getting a bad connection
and they told us to call the hotel front desk and have them reboot the
AP (bad sign!). The front desk told us that there was no such AP in the
hotel. Call the other number back, relay the news, and they dig in further.
Turns out that the AP is in a phone booth (or something like that) a
block away from where we were. We found that if we held our laptops at
a 45 degree angle, DHCP + SSH suited our needs ;-)

I thought I'd try Willamette Week for a while.  When I remembered to,
I used to read it on the train, but after two or three issues, you've
read all it seems to have to say and you can usually get the fresh
content in the time it takes to take the 8 from Burnside to the VA.

Because if something goes wrong and springs a bad but slow memory leak, the
swap might be what saves your ass (though if it's a sudden, severe
memory leak, Sysrq-s sysrq-u sysrq-b is likely your only hope).

Probably not if you're not getting out-of-memory errors.

Yeah, I frequently have multiple users logged in and doing stuff while
I'm playing GTA Vice City in WineX or something.  My machine
runs as sort of a general-purpose shell system for my friends, as well
as my personal machine.

Survival tactic, and not a bad one, really:  If something is eating
all the RAM, eventually it'll gun the offending process.

But even then, only if performance matters.  Linux 2.6 has some pretty
amazing scheduling:  I'm able to do everything my machine does and
my machine still plays Vice City in an emulated environment than it
does on any PS2 I've seen[1].

[1] I almost mistyped PS/2, but I imagine my statement is still true
even then...

My experience has shown that it doesn't kill just the offending process,
but everything.

I had gpilotd go filling up memory one day. Before I knew what was
happening, it had filled up all my physical memory and the system froze
solid swapping out. I waited for quite some time while it filled up the
swap, all the while trying to get to a console to see what was going on.
After about 10 minutes every process except init was killed: ssh was
down, X down, everything killed.

It wouldn't be so bad if it killed just the process using up all the
RAM, but losing every process on the system is not a happy situation.

Just thought I'd share.

Evan

Better than locking up the whole OS anyway, like M$ tends to do.

True, however, I've read that too much swap space can grind your machine
to a virtual stand still.

I've read about the changes made to the disk scheduler, the specs make
it look like it will add both Nitric Oxide and turbo charging to disk
I/O system.  So now with 10,000 rpm IDE drives, serial ATA RAID and
super fast I/O in the kernel, consumer grade machines might actually
start to act _really_ fast.  (I have seen very few consumer grade
machines that act like anything I would consider to be fast.)

Good Luck,

That has not been my experience.  For example, in the course of
modifying a Live CD image, on a system with just enough ram to run the
live CD , I ran the Debian program "dselect" before activating a swap
file.  Needless to say, updating, selecting and then installing consumed
all of the RAM, and it needed more.  Gracefully enough, it died, leaving
all other processed still running.  After activating a swap partition,
the program was able to start and run successfully.

I've seen this type of behavior on several occasions, so maybe it has
something to do with what process the kernel decides to kill.  (Like
killing the X-server, instead of the 10 mozilla widows that are open.) 
Granted, these were not run-a-way processes, just the processes that put
the system over the edge.

I wonder if it is killing processes that you seem to no longer be
interested in running, instead of the process that is using most of the
CPU time.

Thanks, every little bit helps us get closer to understanding the whole

Which hotel in Corvallis?  I was down there last April in a hotel with
in-room internet.  There was a little client box, but you could plug
your own laptop into the ethernet wall jack and DHCP your way to
happiness.  I had no trouble ssh-tunnelling an X11 emacs session from

I heard in the background yesterday our wireless (direct not the 
home/office WiFi) stuff is having problems with the neweer LinkSys 
routers locking out and requiring a reboot to get working again.  The 
radios are still working but the client can't get out through the LinkSys.  
(I'll ask for more details today.)
   These are the ones produced since CISCO took them over.  I've also
heard there is more bandwidth eaten by the router than other brands.  
Though the price is good I suggest you look at the other, but more
expensive, offerings.  Me I like my Asante but then I only have a wired
network at home so can't comment on haw the new Asante's handle wireless.

Well th eonly reason for the three fingered salute, is IBM had an
aversion to the big red button.  As far as I know IBM still has no true
hardware reset.  What this meant, was that if your software really
locked up, you had to cycle power.  CtlAltDel was really a software
kludge for a hardware problem caused by myopic engineering.   :P

FWIW... my Linksys WAP is turning out to be a piece of crap.  I bought
it in June while in Mississippi for $100.

It's an access point, wireless-wired bridge, four or five port 10/100
switch, and a router.  I use it as a WAP and wireless-wired bridge. 
Lately, it goes for about two weeks and starts dropping about 20% of the
wireless packets.  A few weeks after that, it just cuts out wireless
connectivity completely.  Unplugging it and plugging it back in, then
letting it sit for a few hours, on, fixes the problem.

I can't read the little model number right now... it's one of those with
four completely different (software-wise) revisions, so I'd have to look
at the bottom of it for the revision, too.  As far as I've been able to
tell, this one is *not* running Linux.

root at dell root # nmap -O wap

If I had to guess, I'd say it was the first one, as the model number
looks about that long.  ;-)

Steve Bonds and Russell Senior suggested: swapoff -a .  This works,
but upon reflection this seems a bit dangerous.  If indeed I have
exhausted physical memory for some reason, then apps will get killed 
approximately randomly, right?  Not something I want to build into a
backup script run every night.

I was wondering if it would be possible to do something resembling
what I do to wake things up anyway, that is, select the various gnome
desktop workspaces, which apparently signals the apps to redraw
themselves, which causes the kernel to swap them back in.  Say a
kill -SIG<some-nonlethal-signal-here> on all the keithl-owned
processes.  Or some arcane signal to gnome.  Probably too hard.

Well, I will probably be installing Fedora Core 2 with a 2.6 kernel in
late April, and that should fix most of this.  Patience, Grasshopper!

When setting up evolution or mozilla mail, there's an option to leave
the mail on the server or not when you pick it up.  I have one  system
set to delete it and one set to leave it.

Don't know if this applies to your situation or not.

Subject: [PLUG] Controlling grub from Windows?
Message-ID: <20040130174203.GA4759@edge>

Here is the short question. Is there a way
to edit grub.conf from Windows?

Here is the longer background.
I have a dual boot machine that is headless. 
with no keyboard or monitor.
When it is in Windows I access it with VNC,
when it is in linux I use ssh and X11 forwarding.
The boot loader is grub. The default boot OS in
grub is linux and when I want to boot to Windows
I insert a boot floppy which has a grub.conf
in which Windows is default.
I would like to do this without the floppy.
>From linux, I can edit grub.conf and tell it
to reboot to Windows. But once in Windows I can't
access grub.conf to tell it to boot back to linux.
[while writing that last sentence I thought of
one possibility. format the boot partition as fat32
that way I could edit grub.conf from both OSes
Will that work?]
Thanks for any suggestions,

Bill Barry

I noticed in driving by that The Hilton Gardens Inn has wireless access. 
Drive by detection of wired access is harder so you may have to

If it's a single message (virus?) that you want to immediately delete 
and destroy, try [shift][del].

That's what it is in Outlook. I'm not sure if it's the same in OE.

I use roles with different fcc's so that home stuff ends up in
{home}sent-mail and work stuff ends up in {work}sent-mail. I'm sure
you could just set up a new role.

I don't know about grub, but with lilo, you can use the -R switch to
specify the default for the next boot as a one time deal.  The idea
being that right before issuing the reboot command, you would issue a
lilo -R command that would tell it to boot to winblows (something like
"lilo -R default=Windblows") instead of linux.  Then when you reboot out
of winblows, the original lilo.conf will be there ready to boot you back
to linux.

GRUB may have something similiar, and that sure sounds easier than
having a special boot partition.  (What would you do with it anyway, you
have no head?)

Good Luck,

Derek Loree

Just put the swapoff/swapon at the end of your script.  That will swap
everything back in that was swapped out during the backup and reenable
swap again.  Nothing gets killed.  Plenty of swap during the backup if
needed (probably not).  If your quiescent machine needs swap you are
in trouble anyway.  I think it's probably pretty safe.

Russ,

  I thought outbound mail went straight from pine to the MTA and bypassed

Hmm.  Never tried the fat boot partition, but that might work.  

The other thought that I had was about the "savedefault" and "default
saved" menu.lst options.  That is poking information about what was
booted last into some place accessible at the next boot.  If you could
"save" the alternate instead, then you could "toggle" into the right
OS by rebooting the right number of times.  Might have to hack GRUB to
get that behavior, as I haven't found it documented anywhere.

4)  I noted a lack of anything called ftpd-server, which is now
important.

(in ncftp, you should use it over "ftp" for a command line client)

5) I noticed that there is no such thing as a in.ftpd in the only
standard fedora packages, so that led me to the conclusion that the
in.ftpd was loaded by you from another system, or was left on.

Pretty easy.

man rpm ->
       -i, --info
              Display   package  information,  including  name,  version,  and
              description.  This uses the --queryformat if one was  specified.

So it should be clear, in.ftpd was *from* the wu-ftpd package.

I applaud redhat or vsftpd for this.  vs stands for very secure.  Users
using ftp send their system passwords in the clear.  Not secure.

well if you do a rpm -ql on vsftpd you will see:

/etc/rc.d/init.d/vsftpd


So it uses the standard rc scripts not xinetd.  The RH guis should be
able to see this.

Or you can run chkconfig add vsftpd.  I hope it is not installed by
default.

>From the vsftpd.conf man file:

     userlist_enable
              If enabled, vsftpd will load a list of usernames, from the file-
              name given by userlist_file.  If a user tries to log in using  a
              name in this file, they will be denied before they are asked for
              a password. This may be useful in preventing cleartext passwords
              being transmitted. See also userlist_deny.

/etc/vsftpd.user_list:
# vsftpd userlist
# If userlist_deny=NO, only allow users in this file
# If userlist_deny=YES (default), never allow users in this file, and
# do not even prompt for a password.
# Note that the default vsftpd pam config also checks /etc/vsftpd.ftpusers
# for users that are denied.

So read up on these issues

Well it was from a RH6.2 image.  I guess wu-ftpd added ssl.

So not to harp on a subject, but if you run sshd, you then run sftp like
you run ftp.

Passwords work great.

No security issues with clear text.

No changes to the system.

After a short period, figure out keys.  It can be tricky getting
everything set, since typos cause hell.

Then learn about ssh-agent.  

Never look back.

While I can't help you with your RealPlayer problem,
I do have success in getting Xine to play realaudio format
on fedora.

I recall having to download the new RealPlayer codec.  If you
need it, let me know and I can dig it up.

Having booted multiple OS's on one computer with
grub, the short answer is maybe.

The longer answer is this. Grub looks for the
grub.conf file as it starts, which (IIRC) is usually
on one of the Linux partitions (whatever /boot is mapped to).
If you can see the partition that the grub.conf is on
from Windows, you can do it.

Since then & now I would prefer to have as little
to do with the internals of Windows as possible, I
have no idea if there is a way to mount either a ext2 or
ext3 partition from Windows -- & I tend to doubt it can
be done.

This may not be much help but I'm almost positive it's possible. I seem 
to remember doing it a few years ago when I was using Pine pretty much 
exclusively. I don't really remember how do it though, possibly in the 
address book somewhere.

If all else fails you can set it up to always bcc a copy of outgoing 
mail to yourself, and then set up procmail rules to filter it where you 
want it to go.

If you run a diskless setup (floppy boot), noise can be minimized. But you are correct.

That's what I was looking for, but I was hoping it would be a little
less powerful. I now feel a little bit more vulnerable knowing that my
ext2 filesystem is accessible from the darkside.

I feel that we have done everything that said owner of DBA has requested 
of us in the past, which has been to use the name PDXLUG and not 'The 
Portland Linux Users Group.'

If owner of the DBA name would like to discuss this, please have him 
and/or her contact me to discuss as I have re-read through off-list 
emails and have been unable to find any requests by said owner that have 
not been fulfilled.

I, however, no longer have time to discuss this with the members of your 
mailing list. They have made outrageous claims and baseless accusations 
on behalf of the owner of your group and obviously are not the legal 
beneficiaries of PLUG. As PDXLUG has no owner aside from a owner of a 
domain name, your owner can discuss this with any of our list members as 
we are for the most part all equally part of the groups organization 
(not that there is much organization to speak of).

The FCC can be set per address in your address book.  It's trivial.
Create an address book entry for the address and put the mbox in which
you'd like outbound messages saved as the FCC.

Whenever you compose a message to that person, the default FCC is set to
the proper outbound folder.

Roles can mess this up a bit, though, as they take precedence at compose
time.  It's a bit of a tricky situation, but if you delete the fcc line
with a ^K and then scroll up to To: and then back down, it'll set the FCC
to the one associated with that To: line.  Sounds weird, but it works
great and takes no time.  Just delete whatever FCC is set, make sure the
To: is set properly, then the FCC gets updated.

Of course, you're not going to read this because ignorance is more
important to you than tolerance.

There's still the power supply fan and any processor fans (my firewall's a
486 with no heatsink fan)...  but I really regret the power consumption.
I'd LOVE to get a little single board computer for my firewall, but I
don't have any money.

Is there a single board computer that you can put in a PCI slot?  This
might sound weird, but I'm imagining a SBC with all the I/O on a backplate
and drawing power from a PCI connection, but otherwise having no logical
connection to the host PC.  That'd be really neat.  I could use a couple
of those.

Subject: [PLUG] Disappearing Text (Fonts)
Message-ID: <1075518030.2690.15.camel@timmy>

For some time I have been using the font smoothing capabilities of gnome
to get display fonts that look reasonable. Recently I installed some new
font packages and have since turned off font smoothing.

Now, certain text on certain web pages disappears. Take a look at these
pictures (of http://lincolnhs.pps.k12.or.us) for an idea of what my
problem is:

http://adnap.no-ip.com/~evanh/font-problem-broken.png
http://adnap.no-ip.com/~evanh/font-problem-working.png

When the page loads, it looks like the first image. Only the first word
of every line is shown. Most other text on the page (such as links in
the sidebars) appears fine. I can get the missing text to appear by
scrolling down and then back up, having it redrawn (shown in the second
image).

The problem is not present at all if I use smoothed fonts.

Anyone have any idea what could be causing this?

Evan

PS. I am using Firebird 0.7 and Gnome 2.4 and Gentoo 1.4.

That's what I mean.  If Windows and Linux were biological organisms,
Windows would eat until it explodes, Linux would just barf back down

Yeah.  That's nice, disk I/O is really fast.  Now I just have to

If you're going to go that route why not use UML for your firewall and 
save the power of the PCI card?  Host system with no ports open, UML subsystems
doing the firewalling and whatever else you want to be public.

Are you sure this is Sonicwall specific. I am not using 
Sonicwall, but had to do two things
to keep my ssh connections from timing out.
in /etc/ssh/ssh_config set KeepAlive yes
and 
echo 300 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time

The company I work for has purchased 3 SME570 boxes that we use for our 
office firewalls and we've setup VPN tunnels between each office as 
well. They run an embedded version of Linux.

http://www.snapgear.com/producthome.html

I'm contemplating one for my home so I don't have to keep a PC-based 
firewall running all of the time. For my home I don't need a unit with 
the hardware encryption engine and so I'd probably go with the SME530.

At the personal telco meeting Wednesday, Jim Thompson of netgate.com
(mail order network goodies out of Spokane) was showing a little box
from Taiwan they were planning on peddling for about $100.  It is like
a linksys WAP/Firewall/Router, except geared more towards the Linux
hacker, with handy things like a serial port for debugging.  It is
so new, they don't have a name for it yet.  PTP raffled one, and it
ended up with Greg Buchan.  Or at least the promise of one, more
beta units are on the way.

There was some discussion that these would make great PTP nodes, but
PTP is based on NoCat which is written in Perl, which is a bit large
for most embedded systems.  However, where there is a will ...

Again, this product is in beta, so we don't even have a name yet,
much less implementation details.  But talking with Greg, and with
his background in security, he seems to be just about the best
possible fellow to get that box.  Expect good things.

One of the SmartMedia cards that went off to New Zealand a couple
months ago has turned up (logically) mangled somehow.  My ability to
gather information about the problem from across a rather large ocean
is unfortunately quite limited.  

When/if I get my hands on it, I'd like to see what I can recover from
it, which means dd'ing the media to an on-disk image and inspecting/
dissecting the files present on it.

What tools are available under linux to do this sort of thing?  Are
any particularly better than others?

Thanks!

It is specific to the Sonicwall because I only have the problem when the
Sonicwall is between me and the server.  The Sonicwall is tearing down the
connection when it doesn't see any traffic for several minutes (which is
actually a good thing from the firewall's point of view).

"KeepAlive yes" is the default for SSH, but setting the tcp_keepalive_time
lower is an interesting solution.  Currently I see that it's set to 2
hours (at least on Fedora 1).  Setting it lower will affect all TCP
connections, not just SSH, that use KeepAlive but that should be fine and
hardly noticable on my laptop.
Thanks,
~M

Apparently Sonicwall tears down the connection after 60 seconds if idle,
so I set tcp_keepalive_time to 50 and I no longer get disconnected.

I've been using a lot of Netgear VFS318s lately.

They're cheap and they do decently interoperable VPN.

Do they still make the CerfCube?

Not being i386, you're a little more secure than some other solutions,
right?

And on top of those other features, they're also discretely codenamed
'FVS318'.

Heh.

  Thanks, Sean. Since firestarted is designed for Gnome, but has
condescended to work with KDE, too, I suspect it would probably work with
Xfce. However, unless I mis-read something it's only a GUI front end to
netfilter/iptables. For a notebook running no services other than ssh and
mozilla that communicate with the outside world, I suspect that manual
diddling with the relevant iptables files will work quite well.

My guess is that you're running no services on your notebook
other than a dhcp daemon. I assume by ssh, you mean that you're
running a ssh client - you're not running sshd. A few iptables
statements in a script should take care of your needs. I see no
need for a GUI front end for something so simple.

As root, type:

    netstat -l -t -u

and see what comes back.


If you're not running any services, then you really don't have anything to
worry about since there's nothing for the outside world to connect to.
X is probably listening so you can disable that by changing

    :0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X

to...

    :0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X -nolisten tcp

In RH it's in /etc/X11/xdm/Xservers


Or you could use one of the many scripts for easily configuring iptables.
I've been happy with Arno's IPtables Firewall:

http://rocky.molphys.leidenuniv.nl/

You just set a few parameters in iptables-firewall.conf and start the
script and all the iptables magic is done for you.

Hi Cooper,

I'm just now getting to this email.  I know of a great attorney for 
software companies who is here in Corvallis.  Her name is Jeanne Smith 
(jsmith at smithlaworegon.com).  I discovered her on the recommendation of a 
successful entrepreneur who said his software company didn't turn around 
until he met Jeanne Smith.

I have a lot of need for legal work in my profession.  I do business and 
corporate development consulting for software and Internet companies 
throughout Oregon (e.g., one of my clients, Infinity Softworks, raised half 
a million dollars during the funding dry spell and has been selected to 
present to investors at Angel Oregon on February 5).

I have found Jeanne to be good not just with the legal documents, but in 
legal strategy thinking that is helpful in negotiating solid agreements.  I 
recommend her to my clients.

I hope this is helpful to you.  Good luck out there!

Hi.
I have a friend with a dead Powermac. She needs information from the hard drive (her dissertation, e.g.) I told her it would be a fairly simple process of removing the HD, connecting it via a scsi card to my Debian (stable) box, and then reading the data and writing it to a CD.

I'm on the right path, right? I bought a scsi card down at Freegeek, and a cable, and I think the mount command will look like 

#mount -t hfs /dev/sda0 /macdrive

Thanks for any insight you can provide :)

do a

to verify you can support hfs..

I can't.  I would need to recompile kernel before I do this.
Unless you can load hfs support with a module?

Don't forget the readonly switch (-r) in your mount command.  If you run
into trouble, after google I would check with penguinppc.org and the

I've never tried it myself, but it claims to be able to do forensics

Thanks!  I saw that too and it looks promising.

Interestingly, the biggest problem here is the "human factors" part...
getting my sister to just send me the card before she lets some random
"camera expert" touch it and possibly scramble things even worse.

  My sincere thanks to Jeme Brelin for making me see what I overlooked in
almost 7 years of pine use: the fcc: field in each addressbook entry. I've
added names, modified addresses as they changed and used each of the other
fields there, but never _saw_ what I was looking at for the file in which to
store sent messages.

  I also apologise for the list for making a mountain out of a minor bump in
the road.

I recently figured out how to keep our Sonicwall at work from timing out 
connections.  There is a default inactivity timeout but this didn't seem 
to affect the connections.  There is also a timeout on each of the 
filter rules.  If you increase the timeout on the incoming SSH rule, 
then they won't timeout.

Subject: [PLUG] Another hard linux lesson learned: oops!
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0401311715540.11667@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  In my naivety, I believed that /usr/local contained only locally-installed
applications went into /usr/local; that distribution upgrades would not
overwrite that file system so it was "safe". I am no longer naive.

  For reasons I can not explain, my Red Hat 7.3 system has libc.so.6 in
/usr/local/lib, while the Slackware 9.1 systems have libc.so.6 in /usr/lib
and /lib/. So, in the process of moving applications from the Red Hat system
to the Slackware system, I tarred, moved and untarred /usr/local from the
former to the latter. Now the latter will not boot (or run sftp, scp or
ssh).

  Why? During the boot process, the Slackware-9.1 box runs /sbin/agetty and
discovers that "/usr/local/lib/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.3' not found
(required by ...)". Sigh.

  This means, of course, that I cannot even boot into single user mode. What
I'm thinking I need to do run through the install floppies, keeping the
partition table intact, then reinstall the system. But, that would not
overwrite /usr/local, will it?

  Would I be better off by downloading a copy of Knoppix, burning it onto a
cdrom, and using that to gain access to the hard drives on the hobbled
system? I suspect that if I can remove the inproper libc files I have a
chance of booting properly.

Comments?

You'll need a driver for the Mac filesystem. There are two, depending
on which flavor of HFS (Apple's "Hierarchical File System") the dead
PowerMac was using: HFS and HFS+. HFS+ is an extension of HFS (who
knew?), and supports much larger disks, along with lots of *nix-ish file
attributes. Kernel modules are available for both, and are included in
standard PPC trees.

I'd bet that the PowerMac was using HFS+. Other than backward
compatibility with older machines, there's no real reason to be using
HFS. If you mount an HFS+ partition with the HFS driver, you'll see a
handful of files, one of which is a readme-like text file telling you
why you can't see anything more.

It's unlikely the first partition on the drive will be the one you
want to mount. Apple's brand of Open Firmware likes to use up several
parititions. Listing the partition table with 'mac-fdisk -l /dev/bluh'
is an easy way to help guess which partition is the likely suspect.
Naturally, if it's a typical one-partition Mac drive, it'll be the last
on the disk (and the largest).

Good luck... :-)

Does your install medium have a rescue mode?  You could make a rescue CD 
or floppy.  They are smaller than Knoppix.  I always have a LNX-BBC 
mini-CD available for rescue situations.

Also, you might want to try starting a shell directly instead of going 
through the single-mode init process.  Try setting the "init=/bin/bash" 
kernel parameter.

The installation media is its own environment.  Use the rescue mode and
follow the chroot instructions.  Then delete or move the libc.so.6
files.  Then reboot.  You will be whole again.

Ian,

  I keep forgetting about that string.

Ken,

  I don't recall if the Slackware-9.1 floppies/cdrom have a rescue mode, but
I'll sure find out tomorrow!

Thanks,

True, but my problem was with outgoing ssh connections.  I've resolved the
problem by adjusting tcp_keepalive_time on my Linux box, but it'd be nice
if I could have the Sonicwall not close ssh connections in the first
place.

I don't know off-hand how to permanentaly disable it, but you could always
just search for something else that doesn't exist:

In your .vimrc,

    set nohlsearch      ' (aka nohls)

That's the default behavior, so I suspect your .vimrc has

    set hlsearch        ' (aka hls)

As Matt pointed out, you can do a failed search to get rid of the
highlighting on an adhoc basis. You can also,

    :noh

hth,
Sandy

They are a rescue mode; they boot you into bash with a limited set of
utilities.  Use the 'live' CD and you've got a decent system to work
with, I think... I think the live CD is number two now?  Either two or
three, anyway.

You could just use CD1, mount the hard drive, go in and remove the
offending files...
