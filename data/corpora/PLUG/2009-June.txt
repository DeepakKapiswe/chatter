To which list I'll add that Windows 7 RC cannot join most Samba-hosted 
domains. There are reports that some patches will sometimes work, but 
at this point it seems Win 7 cannot reliably authenticate against a 
Samba server.

It can, however, mount drive shares, if that's all you need.

I have been working on getting PLUG speakers.
If things work out we will have speakers scheduled for several months.

However,

I have not yet found a speaker for June 4, 2009.
Does anyone want to speak?
Or, does anyone know of someone I should contact?

Think we could come up with enough to say?

Subject: [PLUG] rsync
Message-ID: <4A24B5D3.1050005@verizon.net>

I have been working to learn a bit about rsync, in preperation for 
upgrading to Jaunty.  After reading several tutorials, reading some of 
the man page, and generally messing around with some minor changes in 
syntax, I came up with the following.

#!bin/bash
  sudo rsync -av --progress --delete 
--log-file=/home/bruce/Desktop/$(date +%Y%m%d)_moose_rsync.log 
robin at xxx.xxx.xx.xxx:/home/robin /media/disk/MooseBackup

Question 1:	What could I do that would make this better?
Question 2:	Why would your change make this better?
Question 3:	Running Ubuntu & Kubuntu, I don't think I really need to 
copy all of the home/username directory...what changes could I make to 
streamline what I am doing?
Question 4:	What did I forget to ask?

Thank you!

Bruce

I usually include "-x", which instructs rsync to not cross file system
boundarys when reading from the source. This likely won't be an issue
for you if you're sticking to your homedir, but it's handy if you're
backing up your root partition and have other filesystems mounted
(/home, etc.). Also, if it's your homedir, you probably don't need to
use sudo. The fewer privileges, the better.

It's usually a good idea to make a dry run prior to the real copy, via
the "-n" flag. If you're creating a fresh copy of your source file
system, then you likely don't have to worry about trashing anything on
the destination, but you never know. A dry run also often leads me to
include a few "--exclude" arguments.

Thanks Paul,

I have been using the -n flag and have fixed some of my syntax errors 
with the use of the dry run.

The only error I see in the log file at this point is a permission 
denied at /home/robin/.config/menus so adding an --exclude would not be 
a problem.

After thinking about this a little more...besides wanting to "learn to 
do this correctly", I am interested in what is really important to 
save...email, browser, documents, pictures, etc...without having to 
create a huge list of folders to include or exclude.  At this point it 
is a 6 GB file that is saved, so not really a storage issue, yet.

Thinking on the fly this morning,

Bruce

Maybe.  I can provide about 5 minutes, if you can provide the other
90 minutes. :)

Randal and all,

I'm sure Randal will have lots to say once he begins and I can
contribute my 5 minutes worth, so that is
what we will do.

I will write the announcement later today.

But that's the problem, this is *before* the alcohol, and *delays* it. :)

I think the issue with backups is that there isn't necessarily a "learn
to do this correctly" that applies across the board.  It really depends
upon the purpose of the backup, on what you want it to accomplish, on
what you want to save and for how long, and on what you want to be able
to restore and under what circumstances.

I use [1] rdiff-backup, which uses (via rdiff) the rsync algorithm to
create and maintain a backup mirror of whatever file system(s) you tell
it to backup.  To quote Wikipedia, "rdiff-backup stores incremental
rdiff deltas with the backup, with which it is possible to recreate any
backup point."  That's a snippet of the technical stuff, but what I like
about it is that, most of the time, I just want to find an "oops, I
didn't mean to delete that" file.  It's easy with the backup created by
rdiff-backup, since it is just a mirror of your data, so the file is
right where it was before I deleted it.  Sometimes, I've wanted to
restore a previous version of a file that I've hopeless screwed up --
also easy enough with rdiff-backup, since all backups are time-stamped.
Only once have I done a complete restore of my whole backed-up file
system -- more complicated, but doable.  So it suits my needs really
well, but you may have different needs.

As for what to backup, since I run it from a cron every night, I have
built up a list of home sub-directories to exclude.  Basically,
everything I have no need to restore, like ~/.thumbnails,
~/local/share/Trash, and my browsers' caches.  I have only one file in
my user's home not owned by my user account: ~/.viminfo.  So I exclude
that, too, so I don't have to sudo to run the job or get the "permission
denied" error in my logs.  Since there are precious few files outside of
home I make changes to, I just copy them over to ~/Documents, so I have
a record of my changes.  (In my case, it's mostly to do with
configuration odds & ends for various programs, including apt.)  I don't
backup /etc, /usr, or /var.  If I made more extensive use of /usr/local,
I guess I would add that to my backups.  Basically, my goals are: 1)
data preservation of my own stuff, and 2) recreation of my settings and
system modifications should I ever need to reinstall, whether
"expectedly" or unexpectedly.

I take care of things like my address book, bookmarks, and my installed
software list by periodically exporting them to files in ~/Documents,
which then get included in my backups.  Gmail/IMAP preserves all the
email I want to keep and makes it readily accessible, but really
important email I also save to a file just in case Google blows up one
day.  (Works for me because I don't have all that much *really
important* email.)

But all this would be entirely inadequate for people running more
complex systems, set-ups, and software.  So it's not the correct way to
manage backups, it's just the way that works for me.  I think what you
have to decide is what do you want from your backup, then figure out
what sort of backup will be adequate to your needs.  That's about as
close as you can come to learning to do it correctly.

Message-ID: <1243970250.7342.10.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

Anyone know if there is a kit to play Super Nintendo Games 
on a Linux PC or a Mac?  On Ebay, Super Nintendos have 
gotten ridiculously expensive.  I was looking for one that 
never sold, new in the box.  Well, none of the ones I found 
were new in the box and worse than that, the sellers were 
asking for more than $100 for them.  I found one which 
hadn't been bid on that the seller insists works, but I 
don't expect to win it for what I offered.

I would need an IDE to Nintendo Cartridge or USB to Nintendo 
Cartridge adapter.  The old SNES cartridges are so wide that
I doubt a 5 1/4" slot is wide enough to install a compatible
cartidge port in.  USB is necessary to run SNES games on the
MAC, unless I find a way to copy the games to something else
like say a CD.

My brother has a working N64 and a game cube.  If there's an
adapter for the old games, that might work as well.

He is autistic, so the older SNES games are generally easier
for him to play than the 3D games that are popular now on 
the newer systems.  He is great at Super Mario World for
example, but he can't get very far in Mario 64.

snes9x works great.  You'll have to download roms for the games you
have (and you'll have to search to find them...), but I believe it is
legal to do so if you already own the cartridges.

You can also play many (all?) of the legacy games on a Wii, but you'll
have to buy them again (I *think* the snes games are about $5 / game).

I know you can get all the older Zelda games (all the way back to the
originals on NES) on a disc that plays in the game cube.  There are also
game discs with all the old arcade style games.


The Legend of Zelda - Collectors Edition - ASIN B000BRULV0

The arcade style game discs are Namco Museum  ASIN: B00006IKCD and Midway
Arcade treasures (Vol I-III)

Hope that helps some.

Subject: [PLUG] sendmail question - sending null ORCPT
Message-ID: <b399d1c10906021253y5670b6dbo54707d735c05a651@mail.gmail.com>

I have encountered an apparent oddity in my Sendmail configuration. Please,
hold off on the "switch to postfix/etc" suggestions - that is in the future
plans, but for today I am stuck with Sendmail and I need to fix this issue.

When communicating with a remote MTA, trying to submit new mail, my
installation of Sendmail on openSUSE 10.3 is giving a bogus RCPT command.
Like so:

RCPT To:<1 at 2.3> NOTIFY=FAILURE ORCPT=rfc822;

when it should look like so:

RCPT To:<1 at 2.3> NOTIFY=FAILURE ORCPT=rfc822;<1 at 2.3>

I'm not entirely certain whether the <>s are supposed to be present in the
ORCPT command, but in any case, there's nothing there.

Any idea where I can start to look for why it's blank?

SMTP transaction snippet (via packet captures):

local.58189-remote.00025: RCPT To:<1 at 2.3> NOTIFY=FAILURE ORCPT=rfc822;
DATA
remote.00025- local.58189: 501 5.5.4 Invalid arguments
remote.00025- local.58189: 503 5.5.2 Need rcpt command

There wouldn't happen to be a Cisco firewall (like a PIX) in the 
router chain, would there?

I suppose it's possible, but I'm inspecting packets locally on the machine
that is sending these out. So I don't see how a firewall could be
interfering...

Thank you Michael.

This is a better explanation of "backup" than I have found so far.  I 
will do some more thinking as to what I am interested in preserving.  We 
don't have any technical setups here.  Your ideas about exporting to 
files has me thinking.  Your reasons gave words to what I had been 
realizing were my goals in this endeavor.

On to the rdiff-backup.nongnu.org pages!

I'll chime in about my recent experience with rsync.

I had lot of hardlink-based data to ship (Zimbra).  I installed from source the
latest release of 3.0 as it incrementally handles harlinks in realtime vs.
building a huge table in memory about how things are linked.

I've been pushing the Ubuntu 8.04 backport of rsync3 ever since.

My standard usage is 'rsync -axHP' when I need hardlink aware copying.  When
working with VM filesystems outside the guest (either Xen LVs or KVM qcow2's),
remember to use '--numeric-ids' or the rsync will use the UIDs of your local
system when copying.

I will probably need to modify my standard to include '-A' as more ACL usage is
occurring these days.

In the end, this post is more of a "get on the 3.0.x bandwagon.. it rocks!". :)

Kris,

Thank you.
I was glad to read the last line as most of what you were saying was 
over my head.  Our needs are minimal in comparison...I will look into 
3.0, soon.

All,

I'm looking into expanding my file storage. To that end, Pricewatch has
memorylabs.com selling terabyte disks for 84.50. I was going to put 3 of
them in my Ubuntu 8.1 machine (file server). I'm wondering if I would need
to upgrade my power supply or anything else before I put them into the
machine.

thanks,

Upgrade from what? What else is in the machine?

Hard drives don't require that much power. You're most likely fine, 
unless you're already on your 5th splitter for plugging more stuff in. :)

Totally depends on what else is in the machine, including the capacity of
the existing PSU. If everything is typical of a "stock" whitebox desktop,
you'll probably be fine so long as your PSU is rated 350 watts or more and
isn't a total bargain-basement cheapie model. Typical modern drives draw
less than 10 watts when running so their needs are pretty small really.
However, they may pull a lot more than that (I've seen as much as 30 watts)
when they spin up. If start up draw is a problem, you may have an option to
stagger the drive start inyour BIOS which can get around that.

If you have other power-hungry components (most notably high-end video
cards) you will probably need more than that. Anything over 500 watts is
overkill though unless you know for sure you need it, and even then, you
usually don't. As a point of reference, I have an upper-mid-end /
lower-high-end gaming machine (Major components include: single Raptor HDD,
AMD X2 6000+ (125W TDP), Nvidia 9600GT video) that draws about 300 Watts
under load.

Also an interesting point of reference, most power supplies operate most
efficiently around 50% of their rated load. See
http://www.80plus.org/manu/psu/psu_join.aspx for more info, particularly
their test protocol document.

Yeah, my 6000+ draws a lot of power since it is the first-gen at that speed
level. I've considered swapping out the processor for a newer lower-power
one and a good 80+ PSU (probably 500 watt-ish) and see what a difference it
makes. I almost never use this machine anymore though, so I've decided not
to bother. I think I've used it all of 10 hours in the last 6 months. I just
don't have time for gaming lately, and everything else I do works fine on
laptops.

I currently have the following, so from what you guys have posted it appears
I'd be fine:

350W Antec Basiq PSU
MSI motherboard w/ onboard video
1.2 gb ram
2 300 gb Drives
1 36 GB dirve
1 DVD burner

Thanks.

I installed ZSNES and after figuring out the video settings it works 
pretty well. I think I got all the ROMS via torrents. I rarely actually 
play the games, I just wanted to see if I could get it to work.

Power supplies run near optimal at ~80% of specification.  Running them
well below spec wastes lots of power and heat in switching.  (For
example, using a 750W supply for a 150W Celeron system silly---and
wasteful.)  If there are any EE's on the list, perhaps they can give a
better explanation of what is going on...

I have a ~10(?) year old laptop that has recently stopped charging it's
battery.  (few days ago it stopped charging past ~30%, ran on battery for 5
minutes, laptop died, now shows 0% charge).  Does anyone know what the first
step would be to diagnose this issue?  Laptop itself powers up just fine on
wall power, and I have a spare battery I can try to verify it isn't a blown
fuse or something in this pack.  If I can find a 7 pin 2mm pitch header I
plan to hook up my li-ion charger/balancer to the pack to recharge, however
I fear the charging circuit on the motherboard may have gone out.  Assuming
this is the case, does anyone have the knowledge or experience to
diagnose/repair this?  I've done SMD rework before, but circuit
design/reverse engineering/testing is beyond me.  Any advice will be
appreciated.

i can almost guarantee it is just a bad battery.  even li-on suddenly stop 
charging like old ni-cd used to develop dendrites.  i don't know of a way 
to zap li-on, though.

For a 10 year old laptop, it will likely be much faster/easier (not to
mention cheaper) to find another of the same model on ebay, maybe with a
broken screen, and swap parts, than it would be to actually repair the
circuitry on the board.

I understand the reasoning behind not just getting a different model
altogether, but 10 years is really pushing the limits of laptop life
expectancy. I am on my 3rd Latitude D800 (with parts from the first 2 still
going) and am about to start looking for my 4th parts donor....

All that said, it is far more likely to be the battery itself as Joe Pruett
stated. This is just based on my experience.

Since you have a spare battery, this should be very easy to test.

The interesting thing is A: this is a new battery, bought last year, when I
acquired the laptop as a gift.  B: I have a PII (yes, that's a 2)-era laptop
made by HP that still works perfectly.  C: I've used my R/C li-ion/li-poly
charger and balancer on totally dead packs before and they come back to
almost full life again.  As soon as I find an appropriate header I plan to
do the same for these.  It's interesting because the battery packs for this
laptop seem to be controllerless.  (connector off pack has taps from each
cell pair).  Usually from what I've seen most commonly from other laptops in
the past is that the cell pairs get unbalanced, which causes charging to
shut off prematurely.  In this case it's just not charging at all.

You are correct, those are very interesting points. If your understanding of
the connector is correct, you should be able to recondition the cells
individually. Or, if you can use a tester to find the bad one, just
recondition that one.

If it's less than a year old, I would suspect a manufacturing defect in the
battery. Wouldn't be the first time...

If you have a laptop battery that holds a charge at the 10 year mark you 
are by far the exception. Almost any laptop I've ever seen at 4 to 5 
years, if the battery works at all it's usually around 10 to 15 minutes 
of run time.

And on another note, eBay is a Chinese flea market for laptop batteries, 
no matter how genuine the auction says it is. If you get an actual 
genuine battery from eBay you got very lucky. Check this out:

http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=260370980796

FAKE! I know, I got one. And what's that, 9 some odd pages of images and 
text convincing you otherwise. See how the battery says made in China in 
two spots yet the country code says KR? Or how about the Rev A00 not 
matching the white label? Capitalized mAH, should be mAh. And yet the 
battery I got, which said made in Japan, was one digit off on the serial 
number from the Chinese version in the picture, *one digit off in the 
middle*! The manufacturing quality sucked in comparison to my original too.

I bought the replacement pack from an OEM supplier, build quality was
identical if not better, capacity was almost 1 Ah better, (measureable, not
just that they tweaked the sticker), etc...

I wouldn't advise you to try to make do with an undersized power supply.

Last year I had to buy a couple of power supplies because what is now my
old socket A firewall box suffered a catastrophic cascading failure that
blew up its power supply (along with the motherboard, CPU, SCSI card and
one disk drive), and I used that as an excuse to build out a new machine
in addition to fixing the old one.

Trawling the net to figure out what I needed I found a couple of reviews
and some other information.  Search and ye shall find, but the upshot is
that modern solid-state switching power supplies are most efficient near
60-65% of rated capacity, with far lower efficiency when lightly loaded,
as well as closer to full capacity.

So, you don't want to go overboard and put a big 750W extreme gaming rig
power supply in a system built with a low-TDP CPU chip and onboard video
but neither do you want to skimp on the power supply if you are building
a system with a 95W-120W processor and a power sucking PCI-e video card,
several disk drives, a DVD drive and maybe a sound and/or TV tuner card.

A high-quality power supply that's strong enough to easily handle all of
the kit you might ever put in the box is perhaps the best investment for
long-term reliability you can make when building a new system, or fixing
up an old one.  Stable, ripple-free voltages that stay up to spec count.

There's a pretty good power supply calculator here - use the 'lite' one:

http://extreme.outervision.com/psucalculator.jsp 

I ended up with an Antec 500W Basiq PSU for the old firewall box, 'cause
there was a rebate.  And I bought a 650W Antec TPIII for the new system,
which has an Athlon64 X2 5600 with an ATI HD3870 video card, a SCSI card
with two small 10K RPM drives, plus a larger SATA drive and a DVD drive.

Hope that helps,
Robert

   Virtually all PDF documents are easily converted to plain text either
using pdftotext, pdftops->ps2ascii, or blocking text displayed in xpdf or
acroread and copying into a text fine. I have one of the rare exceptions
here and wonder what magic I've missed trying.

   The file was created by a Xerox copier (scanned paper document and saved
as a .pdf). The pdfinfo tells me the creator was a Xerox WorkCentre 7345,
and copying/printing is allowed. I tried printing to a .ps file, but that
won't translate to plain text, either.

   I would prefer to not re-key a list several pages long if there's a way to
translate this document to something I can use.

   Any and all suggestions solicited.

it's an image, not text.  you'll need to use ocr if you really want the

unless your copier is smarter than any copier i've ever met (and i do
use a 6-month-old $80,000 copier daily.  it's not as smart as it'd
need to be to do what you want), it scanned the document as an image.
none of the "to text" tricks work because there is no text--just a
picture of letters.

what you want is OCR software.  while i've not used any in the past 10
years, this seems to be a (the?) leading contender in the open source
world:

Joe,

   That makes sense. I could not figure out why it displayed in the pdf
viewers if it was a bit-mapped image.

I see PDFs with images (and of course, many that ARE images) all the time.
Have you not seen many of these?

   FWIW, looking at the .pdf file with a pager reveals that it is in that
format. Regardless, I built and installed gocr. Then I used pdftoppm
followed by 'convert' to convert the files to .pgm. Gocr does well enough on
the really poor copy it was fed that it will take less time to clean up the
ASCII text than to re-key everything.

Thanks,

Rich

wes,

   I see, and create, pdf files with embedded images, but haven't bumped into
too many gen-u-wine pdf files that _are_ images. It's rare enough that I
completely forget this option when I encounter such a beast.

Thanks,

Unless the copier has OCR built in as an option for scanning, which our 
Xerox does.

OK, so there's DEFINITELY something wrong with the laptop side of the
equation.  Tried the old battery, which the laptop still ran on originally,
(and it was stored charged), and upon installation, turn it on, plugged into
mains power.  Unplug mains power, laptop shuts off immediately.  Thing is,
it's a Sager 2200T.  Can one still get parts (IE: a motherboard) for these?

google seems to think you can still get parts.

Ok, back to my first possibility though: I'd assume replacing blown
components would be cheaper than buying a new motherboard. Cost is a
factor...

I want a copier that can scan a handwritten "E=mc^2" (or other
arbitrary archane formulae) and then creates a document that explains
to me what it means to arbitrary levels of detail.  Conform, world,

Bah -- using paper is *so* '90's ;)

My tablet had no issues interpreting my scrawled out "E=mc^2" (ok, I
did specify the carrot, and this was stroke identification, rather
than straight-up image recognition, so it was a bit easier)  and
wolframalpha did the rest:

 http://www17.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=E%3Dmc%5E2

I was really expecting mathworld-level of detail though, so I'm a bit
dissapointed.  Maybe that level of detail is still pending for
physical formulae, or perhaps it's waiting on a general theory of
relativity ;)

For the linux relation... I was using CellWriter, which is nice and
useful, but not as convenient as either the MS handwriting app, or
ShapeWriter -- http://shapewriter.com.  Does anyone know of better
pen-based input mechanisms for linux, or does anyone have interest in
working on such a beast?

   These used to be quite common. They were called 'scribes'.

I wouldn't assume that based on just unplugging the power right away. I
would let it try to charge for a few hours before pulling the plug.

Even a good battery will discharge sitting on the shelf.

So, here's my situation:

I have a small home network included a modded XBox for playing stuff 
through the home entertainment center and a networked MP3 player in 
the living room (since living space should be as far from TV space 
as possible).  Also, my home is in New Orleans where it is hot and humid 
(A/C is for chumps).

After my old PIII media PC conked out, I decided to go with a smarter, 
"greener" solution for acting as the house server (mostly just dishing 
out files to whatever wants them, running network backups, and playing 
experimental webserver from time to time -- unknown future applications, 
but flexibility is geek oxygen).  But what is it?

Ideas:
A Pogoplug with external USB drive enclosures.
   +  Small, very low power consumption
   -  separate power for each USB enclosure, lots of cables, unknown 
long-term effect of heat and humidity on the drives.

A MiniITX box with Atom processor.  The case sold at ENU has space for 
three hard disks with a 5.25->3.5 adapter rail.  Might be cool to mount a 
thumb drive inside for the OS.
   +  More power, bigger, more work.
   -  Fewer cables, more processor.


So, what are the informed opinions?   More suggestions!

I'll be at the meeting tonight and social hour after.   It'll be good to 
see your old, bearded faces.

J.

I'm thinking of experimenting with one of these as well, though I'm inclined
to get the "dev kit" from Marvell directly. It seems like it would be more
hackable, and is the same price. My playing with this would be using it as a
"remote sensor" sort of device.

I have built and deployed several Mini-ITX based servers. I love em. My
current home server is a Via mini-itx system in a very small enclosure,
connected to an external USB drive array for mass storage. Between the two
they draw less than 100W when running full-tilt, and about 30 when the array
is spun down. I also have a server in my father's auto shop in colorado that
has been running non-stop in an unfriendly environment for 4 or 5 years now.

Also check out logicsupply.com for mini-itx stuff, they have some really
nice small form factor gear that is hard to find elsewhere.

When I need a low power, fanless, embedded PC, I go with an Ebox:

http://www.wdlsystems.com/ebox/ebox.shtml

Stay far away from the 2300-SX.  I was bitten by its lack of built-in kernel
drivers for a majority of it's hardware.  I mainly use the dual-NIC 3850's or
4800's as firewalls, sometimes with wifi.

The standard 2300 works almost-fine as a thin client.  It barley has enough
power to render video for an Edubuntu lab.  I want to test the support of the
3300 and 4300.  More CPU power in the same package that VESA mounts on the back
of an LCD.  If Ubuntu checks out on those, I might switch to them for firewalls
as well.

I'm just a packet pusher.

I learned more about this issue. It would appear that sendmail simply passes
along the ORCPT request from the client to the remote MTA. So, sendmail is
not actually generating the invalid ORCPT, the client that submitted the
mail to sendmail is the one that is wrong.

Unfortunately, the client happens to be a java app with a large team of
developers and a rigid deployment cycle. I could probably rattle some cages
and override it if I have to, but if there is a way to make sendmail ignore
this param from the client, I would take that too.

Any ideas?

Subject: [PLUG] Summary: Mail Log Report Not in Inbox
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0906050616440.28450@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   This is to finish the story of missing e-mails, including the daily log report
summaries. As I wrote before, Joe Pruett identified the culprit as
SpamAssassin by examining the procmail strace output.

   Knowing where the problem originated I had to learn what and how, so I
subscribed to the SpamAssassin mail list and received the usual insightful
help. The problems seem to be completely resolved now, but I'll be
monitoring the situation for another couple of weeks to make sure there's no
relapse. There were two SpamAssassin issues that needed to be addressed.

   The first issue was the log report summaries (pflogsumm and logwatch) and
mail list messages (including those to the SA mail list) being tagged by SA
as spam. I assume this was a result of something I did inadvertently. For
the past several days I exported each false positive to a file, then ran
sa-learn on that file specifying the contents as ham. Today both the postfix
maillog and logwatch summary reports appeared in my inbox as they should.
There were no false positives in the spam-uncaught file today.

   The second issue that caused false positives (and missing messages when
the procmail recipe sent them to /dev/null rather than a holding cell) was
the SA rule EMPTY_BODY being invoked and adding +2.5 to the message score.
Why a non-empty-body message triggered this rule will probably forever be a
mystery. However, this issue is resolved. When I went to add a new rule to
local.cf I discovered that the existing version was generated for
SpamAssassin-1.3.x, and I'm running SpamAssassin-2.5.2. There was a
local.cf.new with many fewer rules in the same /etc/mail/spamsssassin/
directory, so I saved the old version and moved the .new to just local.cf.
Immediately, no more EMPTY_BODY scores on the false positives. Looking at
the local.cf version would never have occurred to me.

   This issue has consumed a lot of time and attention for several of us (and
many messages on this mail list), but it has also been very informative.
Others might benefit from my experiences, but I hope that none of us need to
address such issues again.

   Not long ago there was a thread on cracking attempts via ssh. Several
commenters reported that the perpetrators gave up after a few tries. My
experience is that every day a variable number of potential crackers bang on
the system via sshd, but most of them must use script automation because
most just keep trying. They're all rejected, but the number of attempts can
be impressive.

   Here's today's logwatch summary for yesterday's attempts:

  --------------------- SSHD Begin ------------------------

  Failed logins from:
     83.14.99.10 (sig.com.pl): 10 times
     88.191.77.63 (sd-14397.dedibox.fr): 66 times

  Illegal users from:
     83.14.99.10 (sig.com.pl): 1 time
     88.191.77.63 (sd-14397.dedibox.fr): 3742 times

  Locked account login attempts:
     postfix : 5 Time(s)

  ---------------------- SSHD End -------------------------

   The ratio of failed logins to illegal users varies, but both numbers can
be quite high.

   Thought I'd share with you because I don't understand why folks will try
to log in as postfix or another service.

The scripts probably just cycle through a list of common users to try hoping
someone hasn't secured their box. If they can get in as postfix then they
can try and work on becoming root.

Drew,

   I'm sure they use scripts, and I've seen some attempts at other services.
The high number of attempts surprises me. If they're taking a shotgun
approach I'd think they'd cut off attempts when a few consistently fail.

   Regardless, as long as my firewall and tcp_wrappers keep 'em out I'm
satisfied.

Just wanted to comment that the super-wimple way to avoid all this headache
is to run SSHD on a non-standard port. I never get scans like that on my
boxes which are on weird ports. To make connecting to the machines easy (and
to keep things like rsync and scp happy) and not have to remember a bunch of
command line switches, I put my "weird" port in my user's .ssh/config file
like this:

host *
 Port 12345

And then if there are machines I connect to regularly that need different
settings I add entries like:

host someserver
 User thatguy
 Port 22

You can even setup automatic proxying (with netcat) and stuff:

host server_needs_a_proxy.domain.com
 ProxyCommand ssh server_I_bounce_through.domain.com nc -w 1 %h 22


Anyway! a little OT, but I hope someone finds it useful.

   Thank you, Quentin. When I have time to look more closely I'll make
similar adjustments here.

   Not at all off-topic. SSH is definitely linux related.

This is why I use BlockHosts from aczoom.com... it adds a firewall rule
after a configurable number of failed attempts. See
http://www.merlot.com/badguys/ to see how attacks get cut off at a low
attack count.

Blockhosts is useful, for sure, but I find it gets "false positives" in some
cases, which is obnoxious. If you really wanted defense in depth, you could
move to a non-standard port and run blockhosts. Personally though, I'd
prefer to avoid the attack rather than rely on a countermeasure. But that's
mostly a philospohical thing.

I agree, both defenses would be better than just one.

However, I've never see a false positive with BlockHosts. I've only been
running it for a couple years, though. #:)

And I'll recommend this iptables recipe again. (CentOS 5.3 system - 
/etc/sysconfig/iptables -- therefore Redhat, Fedora, SciLinux, Whitebox 
  should be similar.  You'll have to figure it out for if you're using 
something else.)

At the most I see three of four attempts from an IP/host/system.
They seem to give up after getting dropped connections for 60 seconds. 
Once, I seem to remember, seeing more attempts but I assume they came 
back again.

Substitute your favorite IP for the 192.168.42.42 and add more similar 
lines for others that you don't want to get caught if their ssh client 
(or fingers) get too energetic and make three tries in less than a minute.

(Watch out for the odd line breaks if you copy/paste.)

FWIW, I disable root logins for SSH on my /etc/ssh/sshd_config with 

PermitRootLogin no

and limit ssh attempts in the firewall with the following rules

           tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere            tcp dpt:ssh
state NEW recent: SET name: SSH side: source 
DROP       tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere            tcp dpt:ssh
state NEW recent: UPDATE seconds: 60 hit_count: 3 TTL-Match name: SSH
side: source 

Limiting logon attempts to 3 every 60 seconds discourages most crackers.

If you use a different SSH port, the firewall rules would have to be
changed accordingly.

Thanks,
Mike

An interesting trick that I use to make it so that backup tools like Dirvish
remain useful is:

PermitRootLogin without-password

That (somewhat counter-intuitively) allows root to login w/ a private key,
but not a password. So, my automated backup scripts from my backup server
can still get in w/ root privs, but no password-based root auth is allowed.

You can also specify particular legal IPs on the allow users line if you
want to double-up:

AllowUsers root at 1.2.3.4

A couple finer points of SSHD config I didn't learn about nearly soon
enough.

I still don't know how to "wildcard" AllowUsers though. So I can say
something like "Allow in all valid users, but joe only from a certain IP,
and root only from a certain IP" without having to add every user to the
line. Should look into that again...

maybe the recent module is smart enough to not double count for the same 
packet, but you rules would be clearer with a log-drop rule you can jump 
to.  something like:

-N LOG-DROP
-A LOG-DROP -j LOG
-A LOG-DROP -j DROP

-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 4 --rttl --name SSH -j LOG-DROP

that way you invoke the recent module just once and then log and drop 
based on that.

Thanks.

I found this and it made sense to an almost-literate-with-route2 person. 
  When it worked and the logwatch entries dropped from 
tens/hundreds/thousands a day to less than ten I was thrilled.

I have been meaning to get rid of the logging since it goes the console 
of the server(s) which are in a colo 35 miles away.  This makes me brave 
enough to take that line out.  Didn't want to fiddle with what was 
working ... or don't fix what's not broken.

The other idea I had was to use TARPIT instead of DROP.  For most of the 
systems I deal with there are only a few IPs that need to access the 
system remotely so the idea of tarpitting the bogus connections gives me 
a warm-fuzzy feeling.  But I'm not sure if TARPIT is a standard module.

Again thanks.

you can keep logs from going to the console by using the --log-level info 
flag for the LOG rules.  they'll still go the syslog and be summarized by 
logwatch, but not clutter up the screen.

Message-ID: <98afdbcd0906051427k4d3c6055kd524178882adb537@mail.gmail.com>

A friend and I are looking for a class room type space to video a series of
Linux lessons. Somewhere we can use a projector w/ laptop for presentations
and a white board to write on. A space that could be used on weekends if the
business is open M-F. It can be on the east side or west side of Portland.

If anyone knows of some space for free on weekends or for a small fee,
please let us know.

Thank you,

Jason,

   Did they resolve the rent issue? I know the community raised about $3,000
in a couple of hours several weeks ago but I never saw whether that was
sufficient to save the place.

DLINK DNS323 has a Marvel processor like the Pogoplug has except it has room
to mount 2 SATA drives.

And like the Pogoplug it runs Linux and has GB Ethernet.

You can also pick one up locally.  Last I checked Fry's had them for about
$130...

Richard mentioned contacting a local public school to rent a classroom. I'll
give that a try.

Parochial or private schools may be available with less red tape.

Grub legacy is the default boot loader installed by many distributions and
is quite reliable.  Unless you really have some need for the features of
GRUB2 I would stick with Grub legacy.

I started doing this several years ago after getting sick of seeing
my logs get filled with failed login attempts. I've read comments by
some saying that all attackers have to do is a port scan, which is true.
But, it the years I've been doing this I've seen exactly one set of
failed login attempts on the alternate port I use.  And I use other
measures as well.

sounds like they're ambi-editored.  n or p would match to emacs ^n and ^p.

on a even more tangential subject, what i want are pine key bindings for

^n and ^p work in vim too. :-)

That would be goodness beyond goodness!

Like you, I still use Alpine. I resort to Thunderbird only for 
testing...

well, i unbound ^N and ^P's shortcuts in my browser and they didn't do
anything in gcal...figured they might even though it's nigh impossible
to unbind them in firefox (or maybe that's changed finally?), but even
in my no-frills WM (only control key used is control-T) and opera,
they didn't do a thing.  so i still call a bias =)

Google Reader:
j/k -- next item, previous item
m -- mark item (toggle read or unread)
gh -- go to GR homepage
ga -- show "All items" view
gs -- show starred items
gt [tag] -- go to specified tag

This is why I like Google Reader ... very vim like.

GMail also uses the j/k duo for moving to the next or previous
thread ... er, "conversation" ... and n/p for next/previous message.
And, of course, / moves to the search box, just like / starts a search
in vim.  As with vim and Google Reader, g is a frequently used modifier
in GMail -- ga for all mail, gs for starred, gc for contacts, etc.

I tried the vimperator Firefox extension for a while.  There were things
about it I really liked, but it makes working with most of Google's
services very difficult -- something about all the frames GMail,
GCalendar, GReader, etc., use.  In the end, web browsing is probably one
thing that a mouse is somewhat useful for.

While that's currently true, I expect that to change quite soon. At a
minimimum, Ubuntu is attempting to change to grub2 for new installations
during the 9.10 Karmic development cycle; in fact, grub2 by default will
land for the Alpha 2 images intended to be released later this week,
barring some unforeseen issue:

  https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2009-June/000573.html

I suspect other distributions will move to grub2 in the near future as
well. So if you want to ensure that grub2 works with your hardware and
setup, now's probably a good time to test it out.

Vimperator is great.  One way to get around key conflicts with Google
apps is to create separate instances of them using Prism, which is
another Firefox plug-in.  I have Gmail and GCalendar "prism apps" that
open as separate instances of Firefox (actually xulrunner) with
vimperator disabled.

On a somewhat related topic, I read that an unstable build of Chrome
is available for Linux
(http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel).  On other
operating systems, Chrome will let you convert a web site into a
standalone application, so maybe it will do so on Linux.  Of course,
there is no vimperator for Chrome... yet.  ;)

Thanks for the suggestion.  I tried it out, but it didn't work for me,
for reasons I couldn't quite be sure of.  I think the reason might be
that I don't have 32-bit libraries installed (and don't particularly
want them installed).  There's a message on the Mozilla Wiki Prism page
to that effect:

"NOTE: "bash: ./prism: No such file or directory" error on 64-bit Linux
(Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon) occurs if you do not have the "ia32-libs" package
installed. Installing the package with "sudo aptitude install ia32-libs"
resolves the issue."

I'm using 64-bit Debian (Squeeze) rather than Ubuntu, but I'm guessing
the problem is the same.

Nevertheless, you gave me an idea -- I can use Epiphany for Google
services, effectively using Epiphany in the manner that you are using
Prism apps.  I'd rather do that than install a mess of 32-bit libraries
I don't need for anything else, and I already have Epiphany installed.
I don't know why I didn't think of that before.

The key word there being "unstable" :-)  I read that it is as yet quite
a ways from being usable on Linux.

The vimification project continues.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0906101140560.9546@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   We have a number of virtual ... er, virtualization ... experts here and I
would like your advice.

   I'd been a paying customer of VMware since the pre-1.0 beta testing days,
but I stopped after paying for the VMware-workstation-5.5.3 upgrade. There
are only 2 Winduhs apps that I run extremely rarely: MapInfo (last upgraded
1998) and the Garmin GPS maps for my eTrex unit. Both run on Winduhs 98se.
I have a vm/ partition with that guest OS installed along with the two apps
and spatial data.

   Am I correct in assuming that all I need is the free VMware player, and
not the server?

   When I scan the release notes for the latest (2.5.2) player I see only the
newest Microsoft OS listed, not something as old as 98se. Will the player
use the existing partition with guest OS and applications?

   I'm open to suggestions on how to regain access, particularly to MapInfo
as I will probably need to create some maps in support of a project.

Thanks,

Rich

In case you can't get VMWare to run 98SE, Virtualbox will definitely do it.

On Linux I run vmware server without any charge. There's a version in
synaptic, though I usually go and download the .deb file from vmware
directly.

Hmm.  Do you get icons like "Gmail.desktop"?  I usually have to access
the properties of the desktop icons Prism creates, and replace
"firefox" with "xulrunner" in the path.

Maybe not worth the effort, if you're happy with Epiphany.

Probably so.  Half the software I download is barely usable on Linux.

Subject: [PLUG] OT ReactOS project hard to predict...
Message-ID: <1244677800.3218.16.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

Trying to ask what will be in the next release and when XYZ will 
be fixed on the ReactOS general forum board, I got flamed big 
time.  I guess 0.5 will be the first significant release, but 
who knows when that is going to come out.

Honestly, I'd rather have a clone of Windows 98SE that runs on top
of freedos than a clone of Windows XP.  I don't use any XP specific
programs, but there are some 98se specific ones that I like.

I have found that Warcraft II BNE version 2.01A installs under 
ReactOS, but it doesn't work.  The map editor doesn't work either.
If something works in WINE, it doesn't necessarily work in ReactOS.  
Sad really.

People talk about wanting 98SE to run Mapinfo and/or Garmin GPS
software.  Well, wouldn't those who use this software be happier
if they didn't have to use Windows at all?  How about a native 
Linux port of Mapinfo?  The company that puts out Garmin GPS's, 
has anyone talked to them about supporting Linux?

The ReactOS project started when, 1997?  So it is a 12 year old 
project and they are still in alpha stage.  I don't think any 
version of Windows was developed for 12 years, except maybe 
Vista ;-)  It seems that the ReactOS foundation can collect
money okay, but when it comes to getting dedicated developers
that are highly skilled I guess that's too difficult.  Obviously,
Linux has done a lot better than ReactOS.

How many people who work on Linux would say, "I don't put out high
quality code or documentation for it because I don't have enough
time and I don't get paid?"

Yes, I got the shortcut on the desktop, but it seemed to have the wrong
permissions.  At first, the graphic for the shortcut wasn't rendering
correctly.  I changed it to make it executable, and the proper graphic
showed up.  The shortcut already pointed to xulrunner, but it still
didn't launch anything.  Trying to run it from a terminal didn't produce
anything helpful.  It could be that the libraries were missing, could be
that the extension installed the necessary libraries but couldn't find
them (I guess I could've tried to run ldconfig), could be that the
Debian name-change of Firefox was messing things up, or could be
something else entirely, or any combination of the above.

Given the possibilities, and the lack of comprehensive docs, that was my

I think the situation is only going to get worse, for a while anyway, as
more and more nominally 'cross-platform' apps are developed mostly with
Windows in mind, by people who don't really understand the different
ways different Linux distros do things.  Standardization is lacking and,
often, actively resisted in Linux.

Jason,

  Did they resolve the rent issue? I know the community raised about $3,000
in a couple of hours several weeks ago but I never saw whether that was
sufficient to save the place.

the hp mini 110 mi comes with linux @ $279 w/6 cell battery for +$40,
straight from hp, started taking orders yesterday:
http://www.shopping.hp.com/webapp/shopping/series_can.do?storeName=computer_store&landing=notebooks&a1=Category&v1=Mini

while the asus eeepc 1000he does come with xp, i immediately installed
linux and it works exceptionally well (all of the hardware features,
hotkeys, cpu scaling, etc).  keyboard's not too shabby.  and can be
found for as low as $328 shipped via froogle.

luck++;

Thanks everyone, I hopped onto linux-netbook.com just before this email

Unless the need is really pressing, I'd recommend waiting until the
Ion-based models start entering the retail stream. The performance is
substantially better than what's out there now...

I just returned from a 3 week trip where I was using an Asus 901.  In 
general I was quite happy with it.  It came with some Linux 
distribution(Xandros?), but I immediately installed Ubuntu Netbook 
Remix(UNR).  I used Thunderbird, Firefox, and occasionally ssh via a 
terminal window.  The primary negatives about the 901 is that the 
keyboard definitely takes some getting used to, and the disk writes 
are slow.  This is not a build machine, at least not when using the 
internal SSDs.

At one point on the trip my only net access was via a USB GSM modem. 
It was plug and play with UNR, unlike another traveler's XP machine, 
where no amount of fiddling could make it work.

Currently UNR has an issue with WPA and the internal wireless of the 
901.  This wasn't a problem for me, but it's something to be aware of 
if you need WPA.  Hopefully it will get fixed in the near future.

I bought the white version from Amazon for $280.  Looks like both 
Amazon and Newegg are currently out of stock.

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834220371

Note that the Linux version comes with a larger SSD relative to the XP 
model.

Check out keyboard bindings for Google Search
http://www.google.com/experimental/

<http://www.google.com/experimental/>Also, keyboard bindings in gmail
(enabled in settings) and google reader (on by default) all come completely
natural to any vi user and should be used by everyone on the planet imho.

Keyboard shortcut bindings in Remember The Milk are also excellent..

Use them. They make life much better.

So I'd prefer some combination of the "Keyboard shortcuts" and 
"Accessible View" experiments. The latter is nice because it automates 
fetching the next/previous set of results, but I like the simple arrow 
(without annoying magnification) in the former.

I used to use the NextPlease extension to provide just such a shortcut.

But now, being even lazier, I use AutoPager.  Merely scrolling down
towards the bottom of the page grabs the next page-worth of content
and appends it to the page you're looking at.

I have an HP mini 1000 that came with xp, but switched to Ubuntu
Netbook Remix as soon as I got home.  Of all the 'netbooks' I've seen,
it has the nicest keyboard.  The only negative is that it took a bit
of fiddling to the get the speaker to working and the touchpad has a
slightly odd configuration (buttons are on the sides vs on the
bottom).

I wouldn't call it "good"; but Kino has worked for me:

Of course, it's just a gui for ffmpeg, which IS good!

   Thank you, Dwight and John. I'll install it this weekend and take it for a
test drive.

A parochial or private school is an excellent idea.
Many years ago the Catholic Archdiocese
gave PLUG space for our monthly clinics at
        Archdiocesan Pastoral Center
        2838 E. Burnside Street
       Portland, OR 97214
       503-234-5334  Fax 503-234-2545
That was before we went to Riverdale which was before going to FreeGeek.

We also had a number of Catholic priests who were interested in Linux
at one point.
In particular, a priest from St. Rose Parish (2727 NE 54th Ave.,
Portland, OR 97213;
503-281-5318) was interested in using Linux in their grade school.

I have never used it, but I believe LiVES (lives.sourceforge.net) is
pretty good.

I do the same thing.
I had a paid version of VMWare workstation at one time, but changed to
using vmware server without charge.
I run it on several machines and have generally been very happy with it.
The only exception to this statement is that I have it on one dual
core / dual processor machine and due
to a bug a virtual machine will run away uncontrollably once in a
while.  This does not happen on
any of my other machines and might not happen on this machine if I
updated the software as I should.

Message-ID: <f72d4c6a0906132221i23ce6bcds1a2e45de27e353fe@mail.gmail.com>

Any of you running Ubuntu 9.04 willing to try this?  After running the
command below, an error window appears ("There was an error creating
the child process for this terminal").   X seems unresponsive, and, as
determined by my son SSH-ing into it, if left in this state X ends up
using all the CPU.  Mouse pointer moves, but clicks have no effect,
and ^alt backspace does not work.   (This problem repeated when
entering various versions of the simple command shown here, with
similar if not identical results.)

gnome-terminal -e alsdjfla  (or any non-command)

JJJ, are you willing?  It will not hurt.  i would like to find out if
this is specific to my hardware, or a more general problem with 9.04.

-Denis

It caused the error as suggested, but did not bork X.  The terminal 
window has no prompt and is unresponsive, but could be easily closed.  
CPU loads are minimal.

This is an HP a1700n, AMD 64, Ubuntu 9.04 x86_64.

I also tried on my Latitude D610 with similar results.

Thanks.  It appears that it is a bug in the Nvidia driver version 180.
 Changing to version 173 fixes the behavior.  But 173 has other bugs.
(I do not know what specific version 180 I used.  If I reinstall 180 I
will make note of it.

Subject: [PLUG] OT UPS questions
Message-ID: <b399d1c10906142332u1fd4c9bx73225f0d6cfcc16b@mail.gmail.com>

Does anyone have a UPS that is compatible with Yuasa NP4-12 batteries?
Preferably, one with dead batteries. If so, would you like to either sell me
your UPS or buy my brand-new batteries?

Does anyone know of a way to find out what brands and models of UPS are
compatible with the above mentioned battery?

Or as a last resort, does anyone want to try to fix my UPS? I do not expect
for free, of course.

The story is, I got a UPS that I thought had dead batteries. I got new
batteries, and it still doesn't work. There's a short in it somewhere (I
found out the hard way).

thanks,

wes,

   I have an APC Back-UPS 500 that I no longer use. It probably would benefit
from a new battery, but it worked well when last plugged in. You're welcome
to it if you want it.

Subject: [PLUG] WYDIWYS presentation tool
Message-ID: <20090617144914.GA18151@gate.kl-ic.com>

My presentation to Open Source Bridge will be using a browser.
The content was assembled with a new tool I've hacked up that I
plan to call "WYDIWYS" which stands for:

 What You Draw    Is What You See
          Design              Show
                              Screen
                              Save

The problem is that Open Office and Power Point *SUCK*.  You
don't know until you connect the computer to the projector 
what is actually going to appear on the screen - if anything.
The last time I presented Server Sky with OOo, it actually
rendered broken text (half the letters chopped off) on some
of the big title slides - apparently a problem with render
buffers when the framebuffer for projection is activated.
OOo renders content slowly, sucks with most animations, and
can drop into edit mode in the middle of a show.   A "feature"
that is about a useful as being able to change the oil on your
car while you drive on the freeway.

The basic idea is that all slides are stored as fixed 
pixel-based drawings, PNG preferred, but they can be anything
that a browser (any browser) can render accurately.  Yes,
each slide now becomes 40KB, but I can easily share slides
between presentations (with hardlinks) so if I fix a slide
for one presentation (and don't clone it), I fix it for all.
I can build a whole series of presentations with make files.
For content creation, I can use anything that can make a
pixel drawing (including screen capture).   While the hard
link feature is OS dependent, I can zip together an output
directory and load it on any machine, and display it on any
browser.

Last night, WYDIWYS saved my butt.  I finally had my whole
OSBRIDGE presentation assembled (with about 20 program
generated Flash animations).  When I connected my laptop
to the projector, the Flash animations rendered perhaps
4x too slowly.  It appears that the compute load of the
extra frame buffer brings my ancient laptop and venerable
distro (RHEL5) to a crawl.  By changing one line in an HTML
template file, I rendered the flash animations in "postage
stamp" mode, that is 512x384 rather than native 1024x768. 
Irksome, not beautiful, but the change took 15 seconds to
make and 1 second to recompile the presentation.  The old
full scale presentation remains in another directory, with
all the graphics hardlinked to sources, so the scaled version
only adds couple of megabytes on my disk (all the animations
take 200MB).

Besides using the results at Open Source Bridge, I hope to
organize a Friday discussion called "WYDIWYS - Pimp Your Slide"
and get ideas for the release version.  Hopefully I can get
someone else to take over.  Making high quality presentations
for other businesses (that also display nicely on the web) has
got to be profitable.  After the OSBRIDGE discussion, I will
put the alpha Perl code on one of my websites.

Finally, a quick question:  As near as I can tell, WYDIWYS is
not a word in any language.  However, it has a couple of "W"s in
it, and that can be a problem for some folks that stutter.  I
like the WYDIWYS name, but I can use another if it is a problem. 

And if you are at Open Source Bridge, be sure to stop by Thursday
afternoon to see my Server Sky presentation.  Shorter, prettier,
and much easier to understand than previous versions.

Keith


P.S.  There are other tools that create text-only slides for 
presentation with browsers.  However, they rely on the browser
to choose fonts, do the rendering of the image, etc., so the
results are not WYDIWYS.  However, you can use any of those
tools, with screen capture, to prepare images for WYDIWYS. 
Perhaps some clever Firefox guru can figure out a way to
automatically produce a series of images from those tools,
even building a WYDIWYS source file list from them.  WYDIWYS
doesn't care where the slide images come from.

Keith,

   If you're not wedded to a BUI and can work with a .pdf file, look at the
Beamer class for LaTeX/LyX. It typesets the text (including math, of course)
and it's easy to include graphics created with vector or raster tools. You
can select the theme (colors, appearance of each component of the slides,
navigation aids) and what you write is what you see/show/save/etc.

   If you use acroread to display your opus magnus, pressing ctrl-l uses the
full screen and lets you use the subtle navigation buttons on the bottom of
each slide to move through them. I've no idea if a remote controller works
with it, but that can be answered on one of the mail lists.

I looked at PDF.  I want to include animations that will play on
any platform (Linux/BSD/Mac/Win), with a wireless remote.   I
want hierarchical navigation, and open content creation from any 
application (including a C program) that can generate images.
Just about any displayable image can be turned into a PNG, while
PDF only has limited inputs and outputs.  A BUI does everything
I want, plus or minus some bugs.  The PDF format is much more
limited, and there are few programs that create or display it.

There are a whole lot of other things that Just Work by using
pre-rendered images.   The browser already has 98% of the display
ability I need, WYDIWYS only adds a few missing pieces to do a
"next generation" presentation tool.  It took less time to write
the alpha version than I wasted fighting OOo Impress on my 
previous presentation.  The crazy thing is how much I can do
with it, given how little code I had to write.  More than half
of the code is related to hierarchical navigation that I can
operate with a three button RF/USB clicker,  

I hope to present WYDIWYS at the July Advanced Topics.

Keith

Why not call it PCMCIA?  For, "People can't memorize computer industry
acronyms."  Seriously, I thought the "what you X is what you Y" acronyms
went out of style :)

Interesting.  I've not experienced this as a presenter or audience member,
but I can see it as frustrating.

What are you actually constructing the rasters with?  What are they
rasterized from?

I'm a little confused.  I thought you said the presentation was stored as
PNGs, but here you mention using Flash.  Does your tool use flash to show
the PNGs?

You could be like the mozilla folks and combine something from nature, such
as an element, with a type of animal.  Perhaps, Flux Bunny, Avalanche Bear,
Hurricane Mosquito, or Moon Panda, as examples.

If it's so easy to show on the web, then where are the gratuitous examples
to entice us. (hint, hint :)

Message-ID: <20090618214809.jnptzax1woggwks0@web.robinson-west.com>

I have Redhat Alpha 6.2 booting up okay and cdrecord -scanbus should work, but
it doesn't.  Argh!  I have a DVD burner hooked up direct with low density
IDE cable ( the drive was connected to high density cable in it's usb  
enclosure
that I took it out of, but it reads CDs okay. ).  I tried to compile Xcdroast
on Redhat 6.2 and ran into you don't have gdk-pixbuf-config or something
similar.  I can't get the service packs for NT 4.0 Alpha which is only
updated to service pack 3.  F**ing Microsoft.  They developed Windows 2000
for the Alpha, but it never came out of beta.

I tried installing the 1.9 free release of Deepburner, but even with FX!32
I can't get the installer to go.

I have a DVD burnable iso image of CentOS 4.3 Alpha sitting on an extra
hard drive hooked up as a slave.  The Alpha ARC console partitioner is
confused by it because it's a 40 gig, but Redhat likes it okay.

Is there any way to use this burner under Windows NT 4.0 Alpha?  Oh yeah,
is there an IFS plugin that will read EXT2 as I really don't want to screw
around with FAT32 if I don't have to.

I'm sick and tired of trying to search Microsoft's web sites only to run into
sorry we don't support that anymore.

1- I think RH6.2 was out before there were DVD burners, at least available
for "the masses"...
so I don't think it would have DVD burning functionality.
2- How about copy (or re download) the ISO to an x86 machine and burn it
from there?  An ISO is an ISO, isn't it?

seconded!  i have a pile of stuff i've been meaning to foist off on
someone with more clue than freegeek (who said they might end up
recycling working, non-useless decent-spec SGI hardware when i queried
them), and i haven't quite resigned myself to craigslisting it yet
(and it's not worth ebaying due to weight vs shipping costs).

i would find it useful as well. As long it was a forsale/trade/wanted

I could use a dozen old COAX 10Mbs NIC's that don't even have to work
and this I bet would be the place to ask :-)

Pete,

I just gave two of those to Free Geek about a week ago. I think the list
would be a good idea as well...

Plug-talk gets very little traffic.  Prefixing the subject with For Sale or
FS will let readers filter as they see fit.

I have three of them - two are ISA with RJ45 and a 15-pin D connector
as well. The third is PCI with an RJ45 as well. As far as I know they
all work. Free. I could bring them to the Clinic Sunday mit. Or
whatever else is convenient.

Dont have to work, I am going to remove the pulse transformers
for a non computer related project.

Does someone on the list work/volunteer at Free Geek or does
someone know who I can call there ? Seems they don't put them
out in the store. Can't blame them for that :-)

I'm also against a new list, until we have an issue of someone bombing this 
list with an overload of "For Sale", etc. posts.

Besides given how few of the not so huge list of folks on here will think 
to also enroll in the PLUG-forsaletradeorwhatever list, that marketplace 
will be SMALL. Not worth joining, at that point.

   I'll cast my vote for the PLUG-TALK list as appropriate for hardware
sales. It's not specifically linux/UNIX yet appropriate for a wide range of
topics.

Subject: [PLUG] (free working SGI hardware) - come and get it!
Message-ID: <ae2db4620906191506s71f47e32w91713c546ad66cc4@mail.gmail.com>

ok, since the consensus will probably never be reached on using this
list for such purposes, and i have *free stuff* i'm just gonna drop
this bomb here.

does anyone have a genuine interest in IRIX and SGI hardware?

i have some machines (an indy w/indycam, an indigo 2 r10000 cpu, max
impact graphics, and an O2 (r5000 chip, but with the pricey
media-adaptor add-in and 2 o2cams and almost every spare part
conceivable except for the case)).  all of them are maxed out on
memory, have a hard drive with irix 6.5.x installed (for values of x >
10...don't recall exactly which one).  i have install media for a
somewhat recent (.18?) patchlevel too, in case you want to reinstall,
though i warn you it is not for the faint of heart (only the O2 has an
optical drive).  they all have network ports built-in.

funny enough, except for the indy, the other two are still pretty
acceptable in terms of CPU power and graphics responsiveness, for
someone who isn't into the latest games.  even the indy isn't as much
of a slouch as it might be, it just chokes when you try to do anything
fancy on the cpu at the same time (it had just enough juice to play
mp3's OR do fancy 3d graphics demos, but not both).

obviously, you will be building a lot of your own stuff (you can
download pre-compiled gcc and friends--the systems ship with
unlicensed compilers which work as is but are really annoying (they go
really slow and whine constantly about not being licensed.  compiling
gcc might take you a week.).  there probably isn't a recent flash
player for them.  i built everything under the sun as far as gnu tools
about 5 years ago---autoconf/automake support was pretty great.  xmms
and mozilla worked.  i built several working gcc's with the gcc you
could download.  hell, you can probably still download most stuff as
binary packages from here: http://freeware.sgi.com/.

irix has been on its way out for a long, long time.  there will never
be a truly new release.  these machines are pretty impossible to get
real paid support for, outside of rather expensive reseller houses.

all of these machines will run linux.  none of their framebuffers are
supported well enough to be used in any GUI, though.  the indy might
have better support in netbsd.  they all might, actually.  but it
won't be anything like as zippy as irix.

not enough catches yet?  here's the big one:  you could still sell
these on ebay for probably a few hundred bucks, so they're not
worthless.  but really i want someone who will have fun playing with
them or anyway go to the trouble of finding them *another* similar
home when they're done playing to have them.  i don't want to see them
in the recycle bin @ free geek, and i don't want them trapped in a
basement for years (mea cupla, they've already been that).  they also
don't come with a monitor, and you will need a 13w3 connection monitor
for the indigo2 and the indy.  the o2 just uses analog VGA.

they are well-engineered and weigh approximately as much as a
boat-anchor.  i will not be bicycling to your house carrying them =)

so if you can swallow all that, if anyone wants them and can pick them
up from inner NW, they're yours.  if you just want the O2 that's fine,
the other two should probably go as a group, since compiling on the
indy is pretty painfully slow but you can build indy-capable binaries
from either of the others, despite them having slightly different
CPU's (r4400 vs r5000/r10000, which are more alike).

So what, that doesn't mean that Freedos is a project that it's
developers have no intention of advancing.  With ReactOS, I get 
the impression that there is low morale or something and huge 
problems.  That doesn't seem to be the case, at least not yet, 
with Freedos.

I tried that, I couldn't get it to work after I got it to install to a
bottle.

They haven't completed a replacement for NT/2000/XP/etcetera.
First off, ReactOS has a moving target for what it is supposed
to be like.  Second off, it is probably easier to release bug 
fixes for an old operating system than it is to clone a new 
one from a few limited specifications.  Calling ReactOS anything
at this point and using it in an argument against working on a
GUI for Freedos that could partially replace the old dos based
versions of Windows is totally unfair.  You are lucky these days
if ReactOS works at all on your hardware and even under vmware 
it is unstable.  At least opengem, which is a start frankly,
works. It doesn't run Firefox, but it works.

I think my version of W3D, version 1.1, doesn't work with Freedos.
I went and downloaded a new copy from dosgamesarchive and lo and
behold it was version 1.4.  1.4 starts up and works just
fine under Freedos, although the sound seems to lag as I play.  
Part of the problem may be my tar archive of 1.1 where arachne 
doesn't seem to handle downloading tar archives properly.  
Ultimately, I ended up using firefox under 98 to download a 
new copy and I unzipped it with 7zip.

As far as Blake Stone, I haven't checked if that works since my
486 running Freedos died.

Well, those who run Freedos often do not or cannot run Linux.  
It is as bad to tell people who want to run dos that they need 
to run Linux as it is to tell them that they need to run 
Windows.  WINE is not an option under dos.  I have crossover 
Linux and it is not a panacea for every Windows program that 
I don't want to boot Windows for.  Many programs install 
with crossover linux, but they run so poorly that they aren't
usable.

> Love to have a Freedos compatible gui that runs Firefox.
> I would say Linux - it runs dosemu where freedos runs fast :-)
Only if you are on a computer that is fast enough to run 
Freedos fast under emulation.  For simplicity sake, there 
are a lot of reasons to avoid emulation altogether.  
DOSEMU is not the easiest project to work with.  Straight
dos is beautifully simple, if I want to run Linux I'll run
Linux.

I know about Dillo.  It has some of the same problems 
that Arachne has.  No, I need to run firefox because 
there is a filtering plug-in for it where even the 
2.x versions are usable.  My PIII running 98SE can run 
Firefox 2.x no problem, but 98SE is a proprietary 
unsupported bloated mess.  Now, my PIII is slow but it 
has more than 256 megs of ram so ram usage is not an 
issue so much as processor speed.

I have a PIII that I don't particularly want to run a 
modern Linux on as it isn't even 1.2 GHZ, the minimum 
to run Dirk Dashing secret Agent under Linux.  Why 
Disk Dashing needs a processor that fast is another 
issue for another day.

Well, there are plenty of PIII's out there that one 
doesn't want to run a modern Linux on which are more 
than capable of running Firefox 2.x under Windows 98SE.  
It seems it should be possible to build something that 
is lighter than 98SE that can support Firefox on top of 
Freedos.  That would save the trouble of messing with
DOSEMU and the trouble of rebooting to get into 98SE.

Could X Windows run on top of Freedos?
Could Freedos be an X client?  This would relieve
the Freedos box of having to be "powerful enough"
to run firefox.  The X server would have to be 
powerful enough, but the Freedos client box would 
only have to be capable of drawing what the server
serves up to it.

A lite version of Linux that runs from the Freedos
C:> prompt with X Windows and Firefox is another 
possible option.  I'm thinking something slightly
better than TWM, tab window manager, might do the
trick for a light window manager.

There are versions of Linux that run on top of dos,
but I don't know what the status of them is today.

I think a list of what people lose if they can't run
Windows on top of Freedos could be useful.  For some
things on the list, there might be substitutes.  For
other things, replacing Windows to some degree might
make sense ( maybe with an X Windows client ).

My understanding was that a couple of the games you mention would run
under wine but due to your choice of a RHEL clone the mesa drivers
weren't up to date because video on a server distro just isn't much of
a priority.

I suspect to get what you want, you're going to either pay people to
do it or do it yourself.

If Ubuntu is more up to date Mesa wise than CentOS latest release, it
might support some of the games I mentioned.  Thing is, a
sufficient Windows clone if one existed would also do the job and
certainly even if WINE will do the job that's an emulation approach
where one must have a fast enough computer.

I don't know, Linux can be booted from Freedos using loadlin, but then
I am waiting quite a while to get into X just to run Firefox.
I'm concerned about having enough processing power to run Firefox,
X, and Linux.

As far as the problem is you chose an RHEL clone...  Why doesn't someone
roll a MESA update for CentOS 5.3?

Is a Pentium III 450 fast enough for Ubuntu these days???

Subject: [PLUG] Can't install Linux on Alpha...
Message-ID: <1245475851.11038.6.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I can't find instructions on how to install CentOS 4.3 Alpha.

I get to MILO and try boot hdc:kernels/vmlinux.gz and I get an
error in the decompression stage for the kernel.  I'm at a total
loss, I burned the DVD image on another Linux system where I'm
noticing that there's no MILO directory and the release notes 
are completely empty.  Under the images directory there is 
boot.iso generic.img netboot.img and ramdisk.img if I'm 
remembering correctly.

I am dumbfounded that there are absolutely no instructions.

My Alpha is a PC164 pre USB pre DIMM system.  It has 64 megs,
4 16 meg parity 72 pin simms.  It has a 366 mhz processor, I
think.  It currently has a Redhat 6.2 installation, but I 
want to upgrade that if possible.

Has anyone on here ever gotten CentOS to install on an Alpha?

What specific error does it give you? I always thought it was called vmlinuz
not vmlinux

I get length error - halting

There are no instructions, so I have no idea why I can't get it to boot.
There are no MILO images, so do I assume that they are expecting SRM
console?  My Alpha is ARC based.  The release notes say, "if this
doesn't work for you, send me hate mail ;-)"

Are Alphas even made anymore?

I have no experience with Alpha, but that kind of error does sound like it
is trying to decompress and run the uncompressed kernel (vmlinux), you
should try to use vmlinuz (which is the compressed kernel).

Alphas were discontinued in 2007.  Originally produced by DEC, which was
then assimilated by Compaq, then the IP (as in intellectual property, not
internet protocol ;) ) for Alphas was sold to Intel, then production
continued by HP/Compaq a little longer.  HP/Compaq will continue to support
them commercially until 2012 supposedly.  Until looking it up I thought they
had stopped production earlier than that.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_processor

Here is the Linux Alpha HOWTO.
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Alpha-HOWTO.html

64bit mass production CPU, a bit ahead of its time, kind of a shame really.
However the knowledge from its development no doubt helped further the
development of the current crop of x86_64 type CPUs (even though Alpha was
RISC).

I have in storage somewhere a bunch of old CDs and DVDs from a few Linux
events I helped run back when I was in CA, as part of another LUG.  I have
some retail box copies of SuSE and RedHat for Alpha (v 5.x or 6.x maybe, as
in about 8 or more years old)...

I may have missed it in an earlier post, what are your plans for this Alpha
system?  General tinkering, server, ... ?

OK re-reading it he mentioned vmlinux.gz, sounds like it is compressed....
so as far as that part I'm not sure, as I said I haven't run an Alpha Linux
before.
Usually by convention, the uncompressed kernel is named just vmlinux, and
the compressed kernel is vmlinuz (or vmlinuz-[version] )

Well, I got the system in 1998.  The power supply blew a long time ago
and I finally had an extra one to replace it with.  Once I figured
out how to hot wire the power wire properly and I plugged the CPU 
back in, the computer came up.  I have Redhat 6.2 on it, but that 
is pretty old.  I understand that Redhat 7.2 was probably the last
version of Redhat released that supported the Alpha.  I guess Debian 
is the only Linux distribution which runs on Alpha that is still
maintained.  I have Redhat 5.x AXP sitting on the shelf in a box.
I'd like to get a hold of Redhat 7.2 Alpha, but where can I download 
it from?  It is hard in these days of Fedora and Ubuntu to get the old
Redhat distributions.

I have Windows NT 4.0 Alpha on a small probably 300 meg partition and
Linux takes up the rest of the drive.  I've shoved a 40 meg drive in
there which Linux fdisk has no problem with, but the ARC console
partitioner is another story.  Actually, I generally don't use that
opting to use fdisk under Linux even if I'm setting the computer up
for NT.  I have no idea what to use the NT side for other than figuring
out where MILO is.  I have an ISA sound blaster card that works in both
Linux and NT, but with no software for NT that is kind of pointless.
I have xarchon and lincity.  One thing I don't care for with Redhat
6.2 axp, other than poor support for burners, is that Netscape is really
old and buggy.

As far as what I'll use it for...  I've been hoping that I can get a
more modern Linux distribution on it that works with DVD burners.  Even
as a server, I want to be in iptables land and the 2.6 kernel would also
be nice.  It would be nice if I could install an OHCI USB 2 card and get
it to work, but I tried a long time ago and didn't succeed.

It used to be that Redhat Linux ran on Sparc, Alpha, and Intel
compatible x86 computers.  These days, Fedora appears to be a 
one architecture Linux distribution.

In some ways, the Alpha seems to be a worse story than the Tandy
Color Computer.  Radio Shack's marketing of the color computer 
wasn't any better than DEC's marketing for the Alpha.

Supposedly, floating point calculations on the Alpha are supposed to
be really fast.

So, what's wrong with Debian, again? You're only going to have pain
with something as old as Redhat 7.2.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0906200740580.4430@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I'm trying to remove the long list of 'Unmatched Entries' from the postfix
section in each day's logwatch report, but have not found the proper way to
do so.

   In /usr/share/logwatch/default.conf/services/postfix.conf there is no
key/value pair for Unmatched Entries. It must be called something else, but
I don't know what. Here's an example from today's log report of what I'm
trying to remove:

  **Unmatched Entries**

   There's a long list in the postfix.conf file. Which category do I need to
uncomment, and what value do I assign to prevent it being reported other
than as a summary, if at all?

TIA,

Rich

You know how you can put an RSA card into a server, which will give
you full remote control of the machine, even its BIOS and GRUB screen?
I'd like to do something like this for a couple ordinary desktop
machines that are being used as servers.  And I'd like to take it a
step further: have a finnix image handy that I can boot if needed.
has anyone here ever done something like this?

I have a card in a server nachine I colocate although it has no built
in image. It will however let me remotely boot a cd or usb image from
whatever machine I am using to access it. So I can remotely login
reboot the machine and it will access the cd drive on my laptop and
boot whatever I have in it.

The only downside is the control mechanism is an active x control and
therefore requires internet explorer. I haven't experimented on
whether it would work using the ies4linux package that is floating
around yet though.

Doesn't matter much.  It's for a server machine.  I'm looking for a
desktop solution.  It's nice to know that there is something out there
which is close to what I need.  Gives me hope.

Because he said "server" you assume it won't work in your machine? That 
doesn't have anything to do with it. Start by googling for "ILO cards". 
There are many, at many price points.

I had to go in and look. I rarely have to use it fortunately :).

It is a Megarac G3. IIRC it does require a 64 bit PCI slot so it may
not work in a standard desktop configuration but I'm sure there has to
be a consumer model with a similar feature set and lower price point.

For July, I can do a short talk on my slide presentation preparation
program WYDIWYS ( What You Draw Is What You See )
     http://server-sky.com/wydiwys/ 

While I would like to extend the discussion to making WYDIWYS
syntactically cleaner and more usable, it is actually pretty
simple code and I don't think I could fill the whole hour. 

If somebody else uses the S5 html slide program S5
    http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/ 
or Eric Wilhelm wants to talk about his slide presentation
program Text::Slidez 
   http://svn.scratchcomputing.com/Text-Slidez/

perhaps we can combine enough information to discuss how
next generation slide show preparation programs ought to work.

If that gives Alan more time to re-order his life ( I would
suggest alphabetical order) then he can resume responsibilities
with the August meeting.

Can we get John Melesky in to talk about his alternative slide maker too? I
suppose I could talk about LaTeX Beamer. :)

That URL doesn't work in Opera for some reason (I believe it's
404-ing, but the Opera error page doesn't clearly state the error
code). Actually, Opera can't seem to see your domain at all
(server-sky.com).  Tested in Opera 10 beta (the unite version) on two
different machines, on two different connections.

The page works fine in Firefox on the one machine where I thought to
try that, so it is not a networking issue.  Changing my user agent in
Opera to look like Firefox doesn't change anything either.

This is because the "domain" doesn't have an A record (or default IP) 
and Opera, probably, isn't trying www.server-sky.com after no success 
with or in place of server-sky.com like Firefox does.

It's an browser dumb-down feature many of us have grown accustomed to.  :-)

In Opera, at least in 10 Beta, go to Tools->Preferences->Advanced->Network
and select Server Name Completion.  You should see a window with pre-defined
prefixes and suffixes, and a couple of buttons.  Uncheck the one that says
'Look for local network machine'

Subject: [PLUG] Parallel port under Xen
Message-ID: <001401c9f45a$1e501ad0$5af05070$@com>

I'm looking for help with a Xen problem.  Here's the short summary, with
details below.

I'm running Xen under OpenSUSE at a client site.  The domU is running Win2K
to support an old but necessary application.  The application uses a
parallel port license dongle.  DomU owns the parallel port and thinks it has
access to it, but never sees the dongle as present.  As a diagnostic, I
replaced the dongle with an HP Laserjet 4 printer.  If I define a printer
there, Win2K *thinks* it can print successfully to the printer (job goes
into queue, then comes out after the spooler hands the data off to the
printer), but the printer shows no signs of activity.  If I shut down domU,
load the kernel parallel port modules, and define the port to CUPS under
dom0 it prints there.

I'm looking for advice on either how to solve this problem, or at least
where I should go next to diagnose it.  I've done the requisite googling,
and mailed to the Xen mailing list without a response (although I don't
think very many people follow the Xen mailing list, so that may not mean
much).  There could be a beer or similar beverage in it for the person that
helps me solve this one.

                                                     -Brian

Here are the details:

Blacklisted host modules: lp, parport, parport_pc
Host permissions: /dev/lp0 = 0666.

Diagnostics taken:
- To remove any issues regarding the dongle or it's associated software in
the guest, I replaced the dongle with an HP Laserjet 4 printer.  I defined a
printer to the Win 2K guest on the parallel port.  When I print to it, the
guest believes the document printed (item goes into print queue, then queue
becomes empty without any errors reported), but nothing appears on the
printer.  I then shut down the guest, ran modprobe on the three blacklisted
modules on the host system, defined the printer to CUPS on the host system,
and printed to it successfully.  This indicates to me that the hardware is
good, as is the host system's access to it.
- I've checked the host system Xen logs, xm dmesg, host dmesg, and host
messages log.

I am concerned that Linux and Win2K had slightly different IO address
ranges, but suspect this is a matter of "allocated" vs. "actually used".

those dongle usually need pretty low level access to the parallel 
controller to do their magic.  i don't know if xen can give that level of 
controller to a guest or not.  i've seen some discussion about giving some 
pci access to guests, so maybe something like this is doable.  newer usb 
dongles are probably easier for this setup, but i doubt your app (or 
win2k) would be able to use that.

a quick google seems to indicate that if you can get a pci based parallel 
port that win2k will talk to, you should be able to allow a xen guest to 
have control over that pci slot.

   The code appears on the console as ^[[A. My Google search failed to

pushing "up arrow" when no smart (curses-enabled, usually) app is
reading stdin seems to create that for me.

Chris,

   That's what it looked like to me. I have no idea what might be generating
those. But, I'll look at the script because it must be in there somewhere.

Thanks,

Rich

Message-ID: <20090623194641.32db043b.johnxj@comcast.net>

After an hour I finally got my computer back to working properly. It's
all because of a backup that went to sda1 instead of to an external
disk. I came home and discovered that the backup had failed due to
inadequate disk space. A few moments later I confirmed that the hard
disk was 100% full.

Here are the details:

Backup program is pybackpack, a GUI for rdiff-backup. 
Source: /, with typical exclusions
Destination: /media/disk2/Full_system_backup/

The computer is a Thinkpad and the external disk is a 500GB disk that
lives in a carrier that fits into the Ultrabay in place of the CD/DVD
drive. To make a backup I simply pull out the optical drive and insert
the 500GB drive. It automounts in a few moments because there is an
entry in fstab that tells the OS to mount it automatically
at /media/disk2. Nautilus is happy to let me drag and drop files to and
from it. 

The problem lies in telling rdiff-backup to place the backup on the
external drive, not on the mount point. I assumed that if Nautilus lets
me drag and drop files from the 500GB drive that it is mounted. And I
also assumed that if it is mounted, then any disk writes to the mount
point would go to the 500GB drive. Evidently I am missing a critical
bit of understanding about mount and mount points.

Before I try again, can someone explain what went wrong?

the simple issue is probably that the automount magic usually only works 
when someone is logged in and the disk is attached.  what filesystem type 
is on the external drive?

Well, I was certainly logged in when I removed the CD/DVD drive and
inserted the 500GB drive. I did not restart the computer - I just
hot-swapped the drives. Then I launched pybackpack and proceeded to run
the backup. Then I left the house for several hours.

The filesystem on the 500GB drive is ext3.

It must have been mounted or Nautilus would not have been able to
display its contents, right? If so, then the problem is in explaining
to rdiff-backup where to put the backup. Perhaps I need to get
rdiff-backup's attention. I do have some 2x4s out back.

ah, i was thinking an overnight unattended backup.  can you cd to 
/media/whatever from the command line?  the little bit i've played with 
ubuntu, it seems like it makes things look like they're in /media, but 
they're really in some .gvfs dir off your home directory.

Oh wow! You're onto something! I don't know what yet, but I do have
a .gvfs directory, and rdiff-backup refuses to back it up because it
says I do not have permission. I run rdiff-backup as root, so that
surprised me. It is the only thing that rdiff-backup refuses to back
up. And (not knowing what it is) I tried to delete it, but even from
the command line as root I could not delete it.

Furthermore, I spoke too hastily when I said I had managed to restore
my computer to normal operations after deleting the backup that went to
sda1. Nautilus has lost all my settings, including bookmarks.
Furthermore, I had set things so even Desktop would never be displayed
on the desktop (I like a clean screen). Now Nautilus is displaying
every folder splattered all over the desktop, not just the Dekstop
folder. Grrrr.

There was a discussion here recently about where Nautilus keeps
bookmarks, but I didn't save the discussion and I can't find it. It's
in a text file in a hidden folder in my home folder, but I can't
remember the name of the file or where it was located.

It's a hidden text file in your user's home directory:

~/.gtk-bookmarks

Mine looks like this:

mcubed at drifter:~$ cat .gtk-bookmarks 
file:///home/mcubed/Documents
file:///home/mcubed/Music
file:///home/mcubed/Pictures
file:///home/mcubed/Videos

As for your backup problem, I don't really understand the ins-and-outs
of the GNOME Virtual File System, nor how it treats permissions of
removable, temporary mounts under /media.  It sounds like you ran into a
permissions issue with rdiff-backup & gvfs.  I'm curious as to why you
run pybackpack as root ... one, I thought Ubuntu disables root access,
and two, if you are backing up your user's /home, then your user should
have read & write access to everything there, so why try to run the job
as root?

I don't use pybackpack, but I do use rdiff-backup.  I run it from cron
every night.  (Gnome Schedule is a handy GUI front-end for cron jobs --
you just type in the command and then pick the times you want it to run,
or tell it "daily," "weekly," etc., if you don't care about the specific
time.  It's somewhat less arcane than manually editing the crontab.)  I
backup my /home to a directory on my second hard drive that is owned by
my user.  The command, minus an option or two, is:

$ rdiff-backup /home/mcubed /backup/uhome

The directory /backup is owned by root, but /backup/uhome is owned by my
user, so I can write to it.  I run the job from my user account, and it
works flawlessly.  Maybe you are introducing some complications by
trying to run your job as root?

About once a week I manually run a second instance, to backup my
existing backup to an external drive (which I have to turn on and
plug-in, which is why I run the job manually):

$ rdiff-backup -b /backup/uhome /media/disk/back_uhome

The "-b" option tells rdiff-backup to force "backup mode" -- without the
-b option, rdiff-backup will refuse to backup what it correctly
identifies as a backup.  Again, I do this from my user account, which
has read & write access to the source directory (/backup/uhome) and the
target directory (/media/disk/back_uhome).

My exposure to LVM was brief and long ago but I might be able to give you
some clues if no experts chime in.

I didn't see where you added the space to the volume.  First, you need to
return the space of the deleted partition to LVM.  The syntax for all that
escapes me.  Not all file systems are extendable, your fstab (usually
/etc/fstab will give some clues as to what you are running).

A mounted drive is just another directory, and the mount point itself
without something mounted on it is also just a directory.  These are
purposely kept very similar to make the software that accesses them
simple.  But sometimes you can get bitten by the simplification.

The easiest way to differentiate a directory that will be used for a
mount point, and a mounted partition on that directory, is to make
the substructure different, and rely on that.  For example, if the
mount point directory is /media/foo, then I don't build any 
subdirectories in it.  Meanwhile, if the backup media mounts in
/media/foo, then it might have subdirectories ../backup/dirvish/root/
that the backup program is looking for to do its work.  When mounted,
/media/foo/backup/dirvish/root/ exists.  When not mounted, it is 
absent.  The backup program should throw and error message and quit
when it can't find the target directory.

The problem with this is if the backup program "helpfully" creates
all the target subdirectories when it does not find them.  It should
NEVER EVER do that.  If it does, that "feature" should be removed
from the source code if necessary, and the author gently flogged.
For any program based on rsync, there are switches that prevent this,
but that means delving into a vast heap of command line options.

BTW, another pathological case is if the mounted backup directory 
is treated as just another directory to be backed up.  This results
in exponential growth of the backup directory with copies of itself.
Another gentle flogging opportunity.

And as always, backup is easy (and obvious), restore is hard.  It
is important to have a spare drive to restore to, and practice 
restoring it, before you assume backups mean anything.  Yes, a
complete backup (and how would you know?) can eventually result
in a complete restore, but some restore systems assume more
resources and rocket scientist availability than others.  It is
best to learn about this before an unplanned restore blows your
schedule, your deadlines, and your sanity.

Would it be possible to make /mnt (or /media, or wherever you want
your mountpoints) be a mounted read-only filesystem itself? (say, a
2mb read-only ISO that you mount as a loopback device.)  This is all
conjecture, since I don't have time to try this out.... but I thought
the idea was interesting.

When unmounted, /mnt would be owned by root, with no write privileges
for ordinary users.  This would be uncommon, and probably signify a
bug with fstab.

When mounted, /mnt would contain a set of mountpoints, eg:

/mnt/cdrom
/mnt/backup
/mnt/floppy
...

Since /mnt is mounted read-only, you *can not* write to an un-mounted
mount point--even if you're root.  This *guarantees* that nothing will
write to an underlying mount point instead of the mounted media, even
if someone writes an app that goes through all kinds of chmod loops to
enable/disable read/write access, and it doesn't require that / be
mounted read-only.

Once the media is mounted, I think you'd be able to write to locations
inside, assuming it is mounted properly.

Even if the read-only part doesn't work for some reason, making /mnt
be a very, very small partition (just big enough for 6-12 mount
points), would prevent any reasonable backup from running
successfully.  Since it would be mounted on system start-up, it's
much, much less likely that it would be unmounted, and if it *was*
then the mount point for the backup drive would no longer exist,
causing another error.

It's even easier than that. Set the ownership and permissions on your
mount point such that it's writable only by root. Put an entry in
fstab so that the backup file system is user-mountable. When the
backup file system is mounted, the mount point will assume the
ownership and permissions of the mounted file system's root. Nothing
mounted, nothing written (not by a mere user, at least).

The problem is, as Keith suspected, that rdiff-backup (or its GUI,
pybackpack), helpfully creates folders if it doesn't see them. Worse,
if the folder already exists it assumes I wouldn't want to overwrite
it, and creates a copy of the folder someplace else. 

Furthermore, if I run rdiff-backup (via the GUI) as jjj it throws up
massive error messages about files it doesn't have permission to copy.
This is when I use it for a full system backup. If I just back up ~/ I
get only one error message - the .gvfs file. Apparently it takes god
powers to do anything with .gvfs, because even root can't touch it. I
haven't figure that one out yet.

I don't want to get into how I do my backups because that argument has
already been discussed at length here in the past. Suffice it to say
that some people disagree with me, and we probably always will
disagree. Linux is big enough for us all to be happy.

However, at this point I am considering tossing rdiff-backup in the
bin. Not only does it seem to create folders when and where it should
not, but somehow when it filled my disk it nuked my Nautilus bookmarks
file, and reset half of my Gnome settings. Moreover, the system is
unusable when it is running because it takes every ounce of CPU power.
I could live with the latter problem, but the bugs are just
unacceptable.

gvfs is a fuse (user land file server) based thing, so it is kind of like 
talking nfs to a local process.  that process can deny anyone it feels 
like, root has no special powers.

the settings being eaten is a side effect of the full disk, not rdiff 
itself.  most likely nautilus has some auto-save timer going off and 
doesn't check result codes well enough, so it thinks it has written a new 
copy of bookmarks, etc (but really failed from lack of disk), then renames 
it to be the real copy.  boom, no more settings.

Thanks for the explanations, which make sense. And I now have a really
safe copy of .gtk-bookmarks. And I figured out where the Nautilus
desktop settings are so if it reconfigures the desktop I can restore
things quickly and easily. And I wrote up the instructions and saved
them in my Cheat_Sheet.txt file. Fixing things takes only a few
minutes. Figuring out how can take hours.

I suspect part of the problem is the pybackpack GUI for rdiff-backup.
Before tossing out rdiff-backup completely I'm going to see if dumbass
me can learn how to use it from the command line.

It's really pretty simple -- the man page is somewhat overwhelming
because there are a load of options, but there probably are very few you
actually need to worry about, unless you're trying to do fancy,
elaborate things.  And unlike many *nix man pages, this one actually
provides some useful examples.  Also, the website provides some helpful
examples and usage cases.

The main option you will probably want is to construct a list of
directories you want to exclude from your backup (including the infamous
~/.gvfs).  There are a couple of different ways to do that.  What I do
is use the option --include-globbing-filelist.

This is my globbing-filelist, which I name "rdb_exclude.txt":

mcubed at drifter:~$ cat Documents/rdb_exclude.txt 
- /home/mcubed/.adobe
- /home/mcubed/.bogofilter
- /home/mcubed/.cache
- /home/mcubed/.compiz
- /home/mcubed/.dbus
- /home/mcubed/.gnupg
- /home/mcubed/.gpilotd
- /home/mcubed/.gvfs
- /home/mcubed/.local/share/Trash
- /home/mcubed/.macromedia
- /home/mcubed/.mozilla/firefox/zljdhijx.default/Cache
- /home/mcubed/.thumbnails
- /home/mcubed/.update-notifier
- /home/mcubed/Desktop
- /home/mcubed/.ICEauthority
- /home/mcubed/.gksu.lock
- /home/mcubed/.gpilotd.pid

The "-" (minus sign) means those directories will be excluded from my
backup.  So my complete command is:

$ rdiff-backup --include-globbing-filelist
 /home/mcubed/Documents/rdb_exclude.txt /home/mcubed /backup/back_uhome

(That all goes on one line.)

That copies everything in /home/mcubed to /backup/back_uhome --
everything except those directories or files I don't want to backup,
which I put into the file list.  (The file list itself, of course, does
get backed-up, because it resides in /home/mcubed/Documents and I do
backup that directory.

I'm not completely 100% sure you need to use absolute paths in all cases
-- I did for clarity's sake.  (When I'm in somewhat unfamiliar
territory, I find it easier to use absolute paths so I can always be
sure what I doing and not end up relying on expansion when I shouldn't
or thinking I'm indicating one thing when I'm actually indicating
something else.)  I think the man page says something about that.  In
any case, it will work if you do always use absolute paths, so perhaps
that's the safer bet.  It just means a little more typing.  :-)

If you're going to be backing up directories owned by root, you'll need
to use sudo to do those.  You shouldn't need to use sudo when you're
backing up /home/jjj (presuming, of course, that user jjj has write
access to your backup directory).

I found the man page overwhelming, and the wiki and FAQ equally so. The
problem is that they assume more knowledge of how commands and
filesystems work than I have. 

However, I have concocted the following which I think will back up
everything to the disk in the Ultrabay (assume all one line):

rdiff-backup
	--exclude /proc

/media/disk2/Full_system_backup/

The above is to be run after I verify that disk2 is really mounted. And
the folder /Full_system_backup exists.

Issues that I am unclear about:

1) What if /Full_system_backup already exists and contains a previous
backup?
2) How do I make an incremental backup?

It seems to me that the real power of rdiff-backup is to make
incremental backups which can be treated as full backups because they
contain links to files in previous backups when the files have not
changed. Thus, assuming my understanding is correct, I should make one
full system backup, and thereafter only incremental backups. Another
full system backup should never be necessary. Or have I misunderstood
that?

And, 3) How do I make sure that it will back up to the disk in the
Ultrabay and not to the mount point?

Yes, I think, but it would be easier if you just fired up gedit and
typed:

- /proc
- /media
- /mnt
- /tmp
- /home/jjj/.gvfs

Save that file as whatever.txt (or ~/Documents/whatever.txt -- wherever
you want to put it).  Then run:

rdiff-backup
--include-globbing-filelist /home/jjj/Documents/whatever.txt 
/ /media/disk2/Full_system_backup

(Again, all on one line.)

But, whatever you want.

rdiff-backup will make an incremental backup by default.  The first time
you run it, it creates the backup, which is an exact copy of everything
you want to backup.  The second time you run it, it makes an incremental
backup -- that is, it only copies the data that has changed since the
first time you ran it.  The third time you run it, it makes another
incremental backup -- only copies that data that has changed since the
second time you ran it.  And so on.

Eventually you will most likely want to delete some of the older
increments.  You do that by running:

rdiff-backup --remove-older-than 1W /media/disk2/Full_system_backup

(That will remove increments older than one week.  You can remove older
than one year, two months, three days, four hours, whatever.  Adjust the
"1W" as you wish.)

Nope, no misunderstanding.  That's how it works.

By making sure you specify the correct path.  If your Ultrabay is
mounted on /media/disk2 and you have
created /media/disk2/Full_system_backup ... then your command will be
fine.  If your Ultrabay is mounted somewhere else, then rdiff-backup
will fail with:

Fatal Error: Could not begin backup due to
[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/media/disk2/Full_system_backup'

I just tried it here, just to confirm, without my external hard drive
mounted, and I got that error.  I really don't understand what happened
before, with pybackpack, because I know rdiff-backup won't just move
your backup someplace else if it can't backup to the directory you
indicated.  Instead, it will fail ... which, IMO, is the correct
behavior.

Here's a kludge that will prevent root from making a directory, by
setting the "immutable bit" on a file.  There may be an easier way,
but this will cause an error/fail rather than letting root do its
resistance-is-futile power-tool thing.

Configure your rdiff-backup target directory to be
     /media/disk2/backup/

With the disk unmounted, as root, create the *file* (not
directory):
    /media/disk2/backup

You can do that with touch, or perhaps you use vi to write
a little something into it explaining what it is for.

Do a "chmod 444 /media/disk2/backup" to set it to read only,
and do a "chattr +i /media/disk2/backup" so it is immutable.
That means that not even root can change it unless you do a
"chattr -i /media/disk2/backup" first.

When you mount the backup volume on /media/disk2/, it ignores
the files that are in it, and rdiff-backup will create or use
the directory /media/disk2/backup/mybackup/ as its target.

If the drive does not get mounted, then that pesky file will
frustrate rdiff-backup's evil plan to make a subdirectory,
and it will emit an error message and die.  

Immutable bits are nice to know about.  Used properly, they
can prevent a lot of errors.  Without documenting their use,
however, they can result in a lot of confusion.


Alternative (2), of course, is to locate the programmer who
thought it was a good idea to automatically create a directory
on a mount point without checking.  Then gently flog them -
unless, of course, they enjoy floggings.  If rdiff-backup calls
chattr -i to remove immutable bits before creating directories,
you have my permission to strap them to a chair and play Slim
Whitman's "Indian Love Call" until their head explodes.

Reversing the problem, let's say I'm a vendor who (boo!) licenses software
on a per-cpu basis. How would I prevent a Xen user from taking a one CPU
license, and replicating it to 8 different DomU, single CPU, instances, all
running off of the same dongle, on an 8 core machine?
I'd probably bind the dongle to a specific CPU core in some ways, but it
would have to be something that Dom0 (as well as the other DomU instances)
was "blind" to, so the dongle wouldn't know that another CPU was talking to
it, or even knew existed. Oh, and that Xen instance would only be able to
run on a specific core.

Any other ideas?

But I already checked that.  With nothing mounted under /media:

mcubed at drifter:~$ rdiff-backup /home/mcubed /media/disk/test
Fatal Error: Unable to create directory /media/disk/test

rdiff-backup doesn't automatically create a directory on a mount point
when that mount point isn't writable, or doesn't exist.

OK, I created the globbing file. At 9:32 am I started it. There was
a /media/disk2/Full_system_backup folder already in existence, created
when I ran rdiff-backup the first time a month ago using pybackpack.
The lights on both disks are flickering, and Nautilus reports the date
on the destination folder has changed to today, and I see no new
folders. I think I have success. <crossing fingers>

However, I got an error on the .gvfs file:

jjj at Devil7:~$ sudo rdiff-backup
--include-globbing-filelist /home/jjj/rdiff_excludes.txt / /media/disk2/Full_system_backup
ListError home/jjj/.gtkrc-1.2-gnome2/.gvfs [Errno 13] Permission
denied: '/home/jjj/.gvfs'

I assume that means it was not backed up. I wanted to exclude it
anyway, so fine. But I don't like error messages.

I also got pages and pages of additional errors. They were all of three
types, examples here:

UpdateError

does not match source

And

And 

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/rdiff-backup", line 30, in <module>
    rdiff_backup.Main.error_check_Main(sys.argv[1:])

Can someone translate these to English for me?

I have written textbooks where the files never change, but need to be
saved for maybe ten years, for when I need to do a new edition. Every
six months or so I want to start a new Full_system_backup folder and
save the old one forever as a snapshot of everything as of the date it
was last incremented. So I guess the way to do that would be to do an
incremental, then a remove-older-than command for everything older than
a few hours, rename the old folder by (e.g.) appending the (then) date,
and create a new Full_system_backup folder for the next backup.

Is there a way to get a progress bar, or "percentage completed" that
increments, or maybe a "time remaining" number while it is running?
Also, at the end it would be nice to have statistics written to a file
in ~/, or at least displayed in the terminal.

Michael, did you try that as root?  John wants to do full system
backups running as root.  The error message says "Unable to create",
which may be due to user mcubed having insufficent permissions to
write to the root-owned directory /media.  Root faces no such limitation.

I don't have time to review the rdiff-backup code (I use the dirvish
wrapper around rsync), but naked rsync run as root will also make
subdirectories and scribble on mount points if permitted.

If you don't want the error message, put it in your file list:

- /home/jjj/.gtkrc-1.2-gnome2/.gvfs
- /home/jjj/.gvfs

(I have no ~/.gkkrc-1.2-gnome2 directory.  In fact, I have no ~/.gtk
anything directory.)

Don't /sys/devices and other data under /sys change with each boot, or
each time a device is mounted?  I thought one of the motivations for
using UUIDs in /etc/fstab instead of the more traditional /dev/hda1 (or
2 or 3, etc) was that /dev entries are now dynamically assigned.  Sysfs
is always going to be somewhat different between boots or mounts, as I
understand it anyway.  I guess that begs the question, what is the value
in backing up /sys?

Not I ... hopefully somebody else can.  I wonder if they resulted from
the fact that you were incrementing a backup that had previously been
created using pybackpack.  I don't know what kind of issues that can
introduce -- it's possible that pybackpack adds some elements that
aren't present when you're using rdiff-backup by itself.  I guess the
thing to do would be run the job again and see if you still get the same
errors.  If you don't, then it was just temporary dissonance caused by
the differences in the methods you used.  If you do, it might be safer
to delete the whole backup and do it again using rdiff-backup and only
rdiff-backup.  Generally speaking, mixing and matching different
programs to do the same job is probably not a good idea.  (I know
pybackpack is supposedly just a front-end for rdiff-backup, but
still ... it possibly introduces some subtle changes in the way
rdiff-backup works.)

I guess.  That means you'll be saving full system backups for 10 years
or more?  That seems like, well, forever, in computer time.  It's hard
to imagine what Ubuntu will be like in 10 years, or whether it will
still be around.  You'll be storing an awful lot of irrelevant, useless
data just for the sake of holding onto a few files that won't change
anyway.  You could burn those files to CD/DVD, checking them every six
months to make sure they're still readable; you could store them in a
GMail account (if they don't add up to more than 7GB) or possibly Google
Documents; you could store them remotely elsewhere with any number of
services that exist for that purpose (Dropbox, Amazon A3, soon Ubuntu
One, etc.).  You could do all of these things since the files will be
identical & unchanged, and be relatively sure that at least one of your
methods will not fail over the next decade.  But yes, if you do an
incremental backup, then remove all the older increments, you will be
left with only your most recent backup.

rdiff-backup does write a statistics file by default, though that can be
disabled with the --no-file-statistics option.  If you want to see the
statistics at the conclusion of the job, use the --print-statistics
option.  Otherwise (from the man page):

        STATISTICS
        Every session rdiff-backup saves various statistics into two
        files, the session statistics file at
        
        	rdiff-backup-data/session_statistics.<time>.data
        
        and the directory statistics file at
        
        	rdiff-backup-data/directory_statistics.<time>.data
        
        They are both text files and contain similar information: how
        many files changed, how many were deleted, the total size of
        increment files created, etc.  However, the session statistics
        file is intended to be very readable and only describes the
        session as a whole.  The  directory statistics file is more
        compact (and slightly less readable) but describes every
        directory backed up.  It also may be compressed to save space.
        
        Statistics-related options include --print-statistics and
        --null-separator.
        
These files will be in your backup directory.  There's also a log file
for the whole job.

I'm not sure if rdiff-backup can display a progress bar.  If you use the
--terminal-verbosity [0-9] option, it will display more or less
information in the terminal about what it is doing.  The default is
--terminal-verbosity 3, I believe.  You could try cranking it up to
--terminal-verbosity 9 and see if that gets you a progress bar.  I have
used --terminal-verbosity 5 when I've run rdiff-backup manually.  It
doesn't show a progress bar, but it does print out the names of all the
files it is backing up and I can get a good idea of how far along it is
from that.  It transverses the file system in standard order, the order
that would be displayed if you ran

	$ls /

I don't really think a proper progress bar is possible since it has no
way of knowing the size of the files are that it has yet to hit.  If are
backing up 10 1MB text files and 10 700MB video files, the latter will
take a lot longer to backup than the former, so it would be misleading
to say you're 50% done when one or the other group of files is
backed-up.

Ah, no I did not ... I did see this in the man page, however:

        --create-full-path
        
        Normally only the final directory of the destination path will
        be created if it does not exist. With this option, all missing
        directories on the destination path will be created. Use this
        option with care:  if  there is a typo in the remote path, the
        remote filesystem could fill up very quickly (by creating a
        duplicate backup tree). For this reason this option is primarily
        aimed at scripts which automate backups.

"Normally only the final directory of the destination path will be
created" implies that if your target is /media/disk2/backup,
and /media/disk2 is not mounted, then rdiff-backup will fail because it
won't create the full path.

I have added the first one, but I got the error message about the

I have also added /sys to the list file. We'll see.

According to the rdiff-backup wiki, the UpdateError messages seem to be
related to log files that are changing as the backup progresses.

That sounds logical. 

I'm going to try another backup when I go to bed tonight. I will create
a new folder for it so it will be a brand new backup created with
rdiff-backup only. We'll see how it goes.

The log file and statistics files were not in the backup folder. Maybe
that's another thing we can blame on pybackpack.

I'll try the --terminal-verbosity 9 option and see what happens. 

Ever since the backup this morning I'm getting kernel panics. I'm going
to send this and then poke around some more.

So at 15:33 I inserted the Ultrabay drive. At 16:11 I had a kernel
panic. At 16:21 I rebooted.

Hmmm. A flaky drive or drive connector?

That would explain a great many problems that have been having.

When I rebooted the Ultrabay drive was not inserted. I'm going to
continue to use the computer as usual and see if I get any more kernel
panics. If I do not, then the Ultrabay drive must be the culprit.
Troubleshooting may be difficult, but first I want to convict it.
Meantime, there is no point in continuing to fix rdiff-backup options
until I resolve the media issue.

Thanks for the suggestion, Joe.  It took a while to hunt up and install a
parallel port card.  Once that was done I first verified that it works when
accessed by dom0.  I then deallocated it from dom0 and added a PCI entry in
the domU definition.  DomU won't start, however, issuing the message "failed
to assign device: maybe the platform doesn't support VT-d, or VT-d isn't
enabled properly".  This is an dual core AMD Opteron Processor 1220, which I
believe has AMD's current virtualization technology.  (There are more
details including the processor flags in my original e-mail, or I can repost
them if that would be helpful.)  Any idea where I'm going wrong?

some more googling seems to indicate that this only works for intel vt 
because amd doesn't have a iommu for virtualization until very recent 
(2009) processors and it also sounds like xen only has the beginnings of 
support for that.

so if you have some intel vt hardware to test with, that might be the next 
step.

Um, how about that you are not calling up the crappy vendor and
bitching at them, forcing them to solve the problem they created
themselves?  ;-)

Message-ID: <20090627161642.ac32a04c.johnxj@comcast.net>

I'm sure this is trivial for most people here, but man bash is massive
and I can't figure it out.

In an effort to bend rdiff-backup to my will I have created the
following script:

#!/bin/bash
sudo rdiff-backup --include-globbing-filelist /home/jjj/rdiff_excludes.txt / /media/disk2/Full_system_backup > /home/jjj/rdiff-errors.txt 
sudo rdiff-backup --list-increment-sizes /media/disk2/Full_system_backup > /home/jjj/rdiff-stats.txt


The first line runs the backup. The second line obtains statistics
about the backup.

When running the backup several error messages are generated. I want
these saved to a file. I also want the statistics in the second line
written to a file.

The statistics are going to the specified file perfectly. However, the
error messages generated when the backup is run are just being
displayed in a terminal window and not going to the file. When the
script ends the terminal window disappears. taking the error messages
with it. (I can see them if I watch while it is running.) The command
does create the rdiff-errors.txt file, but it has -0- bytes.

The question is how to modify the "> /home/jjj/rdiff-errors.txt" part
of the first line so it sends the error messages to the file?

The "2" is what I needed. I added it and the script now sends the error
messages to the file.

Regarding your gorgeous enhancements, I'm sure it would make a more
elegant script, but mine works as is now. More important, I can read
mine and understand what it does.

And yes, it pops up window asking if I want to run it or run it in a
terminal, so I have to click on "terminal." And then it asks me for my
password. But the terminal window automatically disappears when it
finishes, so I get a visual signal that it is done. I'm going to leave
well enough alone.

Thanks for the education!

The short answer is that your script should be:

#!/bin/bash
sudo rdiff-backup --include-globbing-filelist /home/jjj/rdiff_excludes.txt / /media/disk2/Full_system_backup 2> /home/jjj/rdiff-errors.txt 
sudo rdiff-backup --list-increment-sizes /media/disk2/Full_system_backup > /home/jjj/rdiff-stats.txt

Notice the ">" on the first line is now "2>", which means "redirect
the standard error" (file descriptor #2).

I am trying to understand the uses and limitations of VirtualBox, in
anticipation of using it (or some other VM) to run Windows for a few
tasks that I still use.  My understanding from reading the docs. is
that VB does not support Ubuntu 9.04 as a host, nor Windows ME as a
guest.  I believe that the latter could be dealt with by getting a
newer version of Windows, but the former seems like a show stopper.
Am I understanding the documentation correctly?  Any experience here?

Just dive in and try it out. I'm running it on 9.04 with Win7 as a 
guest. So far everything works as expected. The web page mentions 98 
works, but there are no Additions available. I would assume this is the 
same for ME.

I can't understand why Ubuntu 9.0.4 cannot be a host. I have Virtualbox
running just fine on Ubuntu Jaunty x86_64. For guest OSs I have Windows
2000, Windows XP and Ubuntu Hardy 32-bit. Guest additions work fine
except for Hardy - could never get that working. But I installed Hardy
only to test something and should really delete it now.

Who said that Virtualbox wouldn't run on Jaunty?

i've been using it to run WinXP on Jaunty - the virtual disk image & vm 
configuraiton was originally created on Feisty (or Hardy, can't quite 
remember), and vBox continues to run it aok.

? Linux hosts (32-bit and 64-bit4 ):
     ? Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 (?sarge?), 4.0 (?etch?) and 5.0 (?lenny?)
     ? Fedora Core 4 to 10
     ? Gentoo Linux

       7.10 (?Gutsy Gibbon?), 8.04 (?Hardy Heron?), 8.10 (?Intrepid Ibex?)
     ? Mandriva 2007.1 and 2008.0
It should be possible to use VirtualBox on most systems based on Linux kernel
2.6 using either the VirtualBox installer or by doing a manual installation; see
chapter 2.3, Installing on Linux hosts, page 21.

I jumped to the conclusion that 9.04 missing from that list meant that
it was not supported.

As to Windows guests, the unavailability of Guest Additions for
Windows ME seems like a significant drawback.  Anybody have a 2000 or
XP sitting around not being used?  I would have to determine if my old
programs, MathCad and QuickCad, will work with such "modern" systems.

It is in the Ubuntu repos for Jaunty. So all you have to do is fire up
Synaptic and install it. The Virtualbox folks may not support it, but
it sure installs and runs fine. And if they don't support it, so what?
I've used it for years and have never asked them for help. You'd get
better responses on the Ubuntu forums, anyway.

You can use a license for later versions of Windows to install previous
versions. I have a full license for NT 4.0 and for 2000, and two
licenses for XP Pro. I'm using only 2000 and XP in Virtualbox, so I
have spare licenses that you can use if you wish. Windows 2000 doesn't
require activation - all you need is my license number. If you have the
CD for 2000 I can send you the license number by separate e-mail.

Thanks, John.  I do not have a 2000 CD, but if I can get one, I will
take you up on your offer.  I still need to find out if my old
programs will run on the newer Windows.

Attached is a document I downloaded from Microsoft. 

Note that both my XP licenses are OEM licenses. My Windows 2000 and NT
licenses are retail licenses. I installed 2000 in Vitualbox using the
retail license, and XP using one of the XP licenses. I still have the
other XP license that is downgradable to 2000, or it can be used to
install XP. I'm not sure I have the XP media, however, as it came with
my Thinkpad and I wiped out the XP partition when I installed Linux.

Thanks for that obscure document.  I am now well on my way toward a
degree in contract law.  I will be trying my old applications on my
son's XP.  If successful, I will hunt for an unused XP or 2000 CD.

It is a bash shortcut that I found when I was doing long makes that I
had to analyze.
This works on the command line also.  It does not work from things
like cron which don't use a
shell to process the file.

Subject: [PLUG] Flashplayer 10 vs 9
Message-ID: <20090629091335.GA16068@gate.kl-ic.com>

Summary:  Flashplayer 10 sucks.  Use Flashplayer 9.

I have been building webslide presentations with lots of flash
animations in them ( www.swftools.org - good stuff! ) and have
been plagued with slow flash animations on my main laptop ( RHEL5
clone, ancient xorg 1.1.1 ).  A supposedly 10 second flash
animation was taking 36 seconds.  On my "clinic" laptop running
Ubuntu 8.04 with a newer xorg 1.4.1, the animation was taking
11.4 seconds, nearly correct.  To fix the RHEL5 laptop, I was
about to load in a newer X server (with all the pain that implies).

While testing, I tried "glxgears", which renders 3 spinning gears
as fast as it can.  On both the Ubuntu and the RHEL laptops, it spun
reasonably fast, 750 frames a second.  Hmmm - maybe it isn't X ...

To make a long story short, the problem turned out to be that the
Ubuntu laptop was running Adobe Flash Plugin 9 and the RHEL laptop
was running the latest and allegedly greatest Flash Plugin 10.  
When I downgraded my RHEL laptop to version 9 (save those old
install packages, kiddies, they aren't available on line anymore!)
the animation sped up from 36 to 10.8 seconds, slightly faster than
the Ubuntu.

Well, there may be stuff out there that won't run with SWF 9.0 r124,
but it works fine with the obvious stuff.  I still have 10 around,
and I can symlink to it from a different version of firefox if needed.

All,
??? Can anyone recommend a good firewall distro or application for
Linux?? Or, for that matter, I guess it doesn't have to be Linux but
could be some type of hardware solution as well.? Currently I haven't
had much luck other than rolling my own, but the only one that I've
tried extensively is Endian Firewall Community Edition.? In order to
qualify as "good" I would expect the following features:

1. Support for multiple uplinks and ability to load-balance between
them (if it can't load-balance, at least be able to easily switch to
the other link)
2. VPN support (probably IPSEC or OpenVPN)
3. Ability to have a failover system
4. Advanced traffic shaping - throttle/prioritize traffic based on
protocol, src/dst port and ip, packet size, tcp flags,
type-of-service, etc.  ability to guarantee a minimum amount of
bandwidth for different types of traffic.
5. Ability to do DNAT for incoming services
6. Real-time monitoring of bandwidth utilization to easily pinpoint
what the large consumers are

In our current state I guess 3 isn't necessarily a deal breaker, but
as we continue to grow I can see it becoming more important.  Thanks!

-Tim

Might want to look into Untangle. It meets most/ all of your requirements
and is easy to manage.

Caveat: If you are running 64-bit, using 32-bit flash via the
nspluginwrapper thing can be worse than 10.

pfSense is worth taking a peek at. It would meet *most* of your 
requirements, with the possible exception of #6.

Here's a link to a fairly extensive feature list:

This is a pretty demanding list of requirements.
Most of the smaller firewall distributions don't have many of the
desired features.

I personally like the community edition of Smoothwall.  It works well
for small businesses and home usage, but doesn't have load balancing
or many of the other features you need.  I also like Astaro a lot; but
they don't really have a very good community edition and the
commercial edition that does everything you want is (or at least was)
very expensive.

Another option is untangle.  I haven't used it and don't know if it
has all the features you need; but it has a great reputation.

I have read something about a couple other distros that might work.
As I recall, one of these is called trustix.  I might check the
distribution page at Linux.org or maybe distrowatch.org.

I've used IPCop with great success, and I believe with add-ons (see  
website for list) it would meet most, if not all of your requirements.

Other than the failover requirment, I can think of two you could use. 
Smoothwall Express seems shakier than IPCop, but it has net-to-net OpenVPN, 
if you need that. Otherwise, I'd pick IPCop. The Zerina OpenVPN plug-in 
seems more stable, albeit it is not really set up for net-to-net.

Seconding pfSense. I have used it extensively in production
environments, as well as been marginally involved in the project, and
it works reliably and will or can meet all these requirements. One
important thing that was lacking until recent releases was NAT
traversal support for IPsec (NAT-T) -- effectively cutting out all
"mobile user" use, unless the user could get hold of a dedicated
public IP. Your requirement #6 (real-time bandwidth utilisation
monitoring) might be done through pftop or some available package. You
can always go to the command line to install iftop (my favourite for
this type of thing), as pfSense is based on FreeBSD.

Thanks, Bill.  I took the system down and verified that the BIOS had "Secure Virtual Machine" enabled.  This appears to be the only virtualization option in the BIOS.  I then booted up, but the "svm" flag doesn't appear in the /proc/cpuinfo "flags" area.  In essence, it seems that the BIOS says virtualization is enabled, but Linux says it isn't.

I tried updating the BIOS to the latest version, but that didn't change anything.  This is SuperMicro mainboard, H8SMi-2 rev 2.01, with a dual core Opteron 1220 processor.

Does anyone have any experience with Linux failing to detect virtualization capabilities?

Maybe it's a  kernel problem.
Here is a report of a XEN kernel not detecting the SVM flag.
http://www.novell.com/support/search.do?cmd=displayKC&docType=kc&externalId=7001447&sliceId=1&docTypeID=DT_TID_1_1
Or, less likely, it's a bios problem and you could try updating the bios.

Subject: [PLUG] dkimproxy or dkim-milter ?
Message-ID: <20090630190749.GB23189@gate.kl-ic.com>

I need to add outbound DKIM signing to my email, so yahoo will
accept inbound email from my server.  I am using postfix 2.3.3
and Scientific Linux 5 (an RHEL5 clone).  I send mail from half
a dozen domains, and my DNS is split between my hosting provider
(rimuhosting) and dyndns.com .

DKIM signing uses the private keys on my outbound mail server
to generate an SHA-256 cryptographic signature for the message
body and header.  This is added to the header in the outbound
mail.  The recipient verifies the mail using the public key in
the DNS record for the domain.  I will set up one key pair for
each domain.  

There are at least two tools out there for outbound verification:

--- dkimproxy,  tutorial example at:
http://anothersysadmin.wordpress.com/2008/01/16/domainkeysdkim-with-postfix/ 

--- dkim-milter, tutorial example at:
http://www.topdog.za.net/postfix_dkim_milter

Does anybody have a preference between these two?  I am leaning
towards the dkim-milter option, because there is an RPM package,
the postfix configuration looks simpler, it is transportable to
other mailing packages, and it does not depend so much on the
integrity of underlying Perl modules.  But there may be hidden
suckage that I don't know about, or other DKIM packages that 
come with free ice cream and ponies.

I prefer dkim-milter. The one caveat I can think of is that
dkim-milter supports only DKIM, not DomainKeys, and the last time I
checked Yahoo is still stubbornly recognizing DomainKeys signatures
only.

That may have been true a while back, but I am finding that these days my
DKIM-signed mail is being accepted by yahoo.  It must have been on their
TODO list to upgrade to DKIM right after the BIND9 upgrade (this is meant
to be a joke).  I think this is a recent development.

This snippet:

http://www.mail-archive.com/dkim-milter-discuss at lists.sourceforge.net/msg01382.html

.. suggests that dkim-milter can be set up to generate both DKIM
and DomainKeys.  That was in November, perhaps by now Yahoo is
less rectocephalically-inserted regards implementing DKIM.

Here's a weird one, but I'm not afraid to ask:

I'm building an application that queries a database for reports, and then
lets the user manipulate the data (filter, sort, diff with older copies of
the same report [AKA "revisions"]).  The revisions feature has made it
necessary to run the SELECT only once, and manipulate the data offline
(i.e. not re-query the same data).  This means I need to either save the
initial result set in a temp table, or re-implement WHERE and ORDER BY in
a lispy way that can act on a list of CLOS entity objects.

Now the question: does anyone know of an already existing library that
translates SELECT statements into lisp FIND and SORT calls?  Or do I need
to roll my own?  Or am I a fool for not going the temp table route?

dkim-milter will only verify DomainKeys signatures, it won't sign them.

Below is a postfix conversation with yahoo that I ran just now.  It is
very typical of what I always see.  First there is a 421 temporarily
deferred.  Then I get bumped to a different mailserver, which accepts the
email with a 250 ok dirdel.  (I did not turn on DKIM logging, so you can't
see that the email got signed, but it did.)

It didn't used to look like this, back in the Dark Days.  The email would
get deferred indefinitely.

Whether this means that DKIM is helping or not is a question I cannot answer.

Subject: [PLUG] Want old-but-good Linux laptop
Message-ID: <20090701010432.GA24708@gate.kl-ic.com>

I would like to buy a used-but-good midcapability laptop,
known-Linux-compatable .

One of you may be thinking about upgrading to a newer/faster/
smaller Linux laptop, while already having a perfectly usable
older machine that works well with Linux.  My wife makes
frequent trips back east to visit her family, and is getting 
tired of hauling her IBM Thinkpad T30 all the way there and
back.  Best to leave something there.

On my last trip east, I took her father's broken emachines
windows laptop (the BIOS was deranged and would no longer access
the disk properly) and put Linux on it.  That got it working
(though it took about 30 seconds to load the MBR).  Linux is
a great way to work around some bad BIOS problems, and squeeze
more performance out of old hardware.

Then my brother-in-law, a "Windows expert", broke it again
trying to restore Windows - without reading instructions,
notes (I spent most of a day determining Windows would not
run properly), or taking out the carefully optimized Linux
drive and putting in the smaller drive that Windows was on. 
But then, I already said he was a Windows expert, implying
a special way of "thinking".  Grrrr...

So, no more "family" machine;  she gets her own laptop back east,
and we lock it up when she isn't there.  She doesn't need much
when she is remote - documents in Open Office, web surfing,
printing, and a lot of xterm stuff.  VPN access for email and
backups.  I can set all that up, if the machine is capable.

I figure a 1GHz+ 512MB+ 1024x768+ decent-sized screen laptop
with a couple of PCMCIA slots will do it.  USB2 preferred,
USB1 acceptable.  Built in ethernet would be nice, though I can
use a PCMCIA slot for an ethernet card.  At least half an hour
of battery life.  A DVDreader CDwriter drive is a plus, but we
can get a USB one or just use thumb drives.  Built in Wifi a
slight minus, I prefer PCMCIA wireless, but I can pull the
internal card.  In other words, a 2002-2005 era high-quality
laptop.  A slight preference for IBM T series or something
with a trackpoint, but she can use a mouse.

What I don't want is driver hassles, poor quality, or other
headaches.  No lemons.  A known good machine running Linux
well, being replaced for upgrade reasons.  After I see the
laptop demonstrated, I will even let the original owner
keep the hard drive, we will add our own.

Contact me off the list with the make, model, and type number,
and what distro it is running now.  We can dicker from there.

Keith
