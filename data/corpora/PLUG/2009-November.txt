Subject: [PLUG] Getting a list of installed programs
Message-ID: <20091101125103.d0ab074d.johnxj@comcast.net>

I have made a full system backup, plus I have made a second backup of
~/ to another location. I am about to leave for Fry's where I will
purchase a new hard drive for my Thinkpad T61. My intention is to
install 64-bit Debian Squeeze on the new hard drive and put the old one
(with Jaunty) in a USB case. 

After installing Debian I will play with it for a week or so to see
whether I like it better than the Jaunty on the old hard disk. In the
process I will want to reinstall all my apps. I assume that Squeeze
(like Ubuntu) will come with some applications, but I have a ton more
that I installed. I'd like to get a list of them, preferably on paper,
before I take out the old hard disk.

Synaptic lists 2203 packages installed. Not only do I not see any way
to print out the list from Synaptic, I also note that the vast majority
are dependencies for "real" programs that I have installed, as well as
dependencies for Ubuntu itself. Synaptic does have a utility to create
a script to install all programs on another computer, but that is not
my desire. Part of the process is housecleaning - I want to install
most of the programs I currently have installed in Ubuntu, but not
necessarily all of them. Furthermore, some may be causing my continuing
problems with bluetooth and other issues.

I can go into Applications and write everything down on a piece of
paper, but there are a lot of command line programs that I have
installed as well. 

Does anyone have any suggestions?

I'm thinking:

sudo dpkg --list > packages.txt

Then print out the packages.txt ?

I think that will print out all packages installed on his system, not
just the ones he has specified.  I believe something like:

sudo apt-get install deborphan
deborphan -a -p 1

this will print out all packages installed on your system that aren't
dependencies of another package.  That's the closest way I can think
of to get what you are looking for, although it will include some
things that you didn't specify personally but were included as part of
the base install (ex. ubuntu-desktop, ubuntu-standard, grep, etc.)

That's a pretty nice command set.  on my systems it yeilds ~130 packages,
a very manageable number.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0911011453470.26558@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I want to tar (to a mounted flash drive) the complete contents (dot files,
directories, and regular files) of my wife's ~/ on her laptop. When I use
'du -sh' on her ~/, I see that it consumes 1.5G of disk space. Yet when I
tar the same directory the tarball size is only 137M. I'm obviously missing
most of what's there.

   The syntax I used is 'tar czvf /media/disk/psa-home.tgz *'. I don't see
the dot files in the tarball, and I cannot immediately identify what's
missing.

   What might I be doing incorrectly? Is there a better way to backup her
home directory (and the /etc directory) to ensure every file is copied to
the removable flash drive?

TIA,

Rich

* doesn't match files starting with dot.  the right way to tar a directory 
is to use . as the arg:

tar cvzf /media/disk/psa-home.tgz .

Also if you want just the dot files/dirs you can try this:

tar cvzf /media/disk/psa-home.tgz .??*

.??* will match all dot files that have more the two characters in the name, thus skipping . and .., if you have a dot file named something like .a, you will have to name that explicitly on the command line.

   Next: it's aborting with an error, but doesn't tell me just what the error

   Thank you, Michael. I learned that very early this year and saved the
syntax 'cause I knew I'd need it again. I do appreciate your reminder.

   Almost. It's 2>&1, and I suppose I can either pipe or redirect that to a
file. However, I'll see if it displays on the terminal first.

Indeed, that helps a lot. Looking at the output, it doesn't seem to get
everything, but I think it gets a lot.

I'm also going to write down manually everything in the Gnome
Applications menu, and everything in my panels.

It also occurred to me to use the Synaptic utility to make a script to
install the same applications on another computer. But rather than use
the script as a script I'll just make a printout of it. We'll see if it
turns out to be just a list of 2003 installed packages.

It's amazing how many programs I have installed on this thing.

Debian Squeeze is installing as I write this on my desktop computer.
Y'all cross your fingers, 'k?

Meantime, does anyone know where installed printers are located? I
mean, if I copy ~/ from the Ubuntu disk to the new Debian disk, will my
printers be there as they were in Ubuntu? This is a serious question. I
have eight laser printers which I use for various different print jobs.
Configuring them all anew would be time-consuming.

So0mething has gone wrong. During the installation I set myself up as
jjj (lowercase), and it took my password and the confirmation of the
password. But I can't log in as jjj at the login screen. All I get is
is "incorrect username or password."  However, I can log in as root;
that is, from the login screen I can select Actions > Configure the
Login Manager, and it takes the root password.

I could start all over again, but there must be some way for root to
reset jjj's password and/or username.

OK, I rebooted to recovery mode and am now sitting at a command
line, logged in as root. I'm googling on how to set up/fix users from
the command line.

John,

Use the passwd command:

#passwd jjj

It should prompt you for a new password for that user.

Verify the user account exists in /etc/passwd as well.

Thanks! Your answer arrived before google found the solution for me.

I did get as far as using su to change to jjj, which worked. So I knew
that the problem was with the password, not the username. The passwd
command is what I was missing. I fixed my password and am now
successfully logged in as jjj.

Now off to play with Debian. :)

Subject: [PLUG] How to configure repositories in Debian
Message-ID: <20091101234623.de52454d.johnxj@comcast.net>

I have a catch-22. I can't install anything on my new Debian
installation because I installed it from the DVDs. I can uncheck the
DVDs in Synaptic, but I can't figure out how to add repositories. At
the moment Synaptic lists 1343 packages, almost all of which are
installed. In Ubuntu there is a list of additional repositories and you
just check them to use them, but I can't find the list in Debian.

I can't ask anyone in Debian-land because apparently all support is by
e-mail. And I can't get e-mail working until I can get Sylpheed
installed because Evolution is incomprehensible.

Enough frustration for one day. Maybe in the morning things will make
more sense.

I don't know what the GUI way of doing things is, but if you don't
mind doing it the hard way, a good start would be to add the Oregon
State Debian repositories to your /etc/apt/sources.list file:

deb http://debian.oregonstate.edu/debian unstable main non-free contrib 
deb-src http://debian.oregonstate.edu/debian unstable main non-free contrib 

If you're not using the "unstable" branch, you'll want to adjust those
lines accordingly.

Got it! Now I have over 26,000 packages available. I'll figure out the details about repositories later.

And now I have Sylpheed installed and I'm sending this from my new Debian installation.

Thanks a bunch!

The /etc/cups/ppd directory does contain a .ppd file for each
printer which was 'installed' by the CUPS full screen program.

However, I was not able to simply copy the files in that
directory between releases. Although the .ppd files exist on
the new system, the printers do not appear on the list of
available CUPS printers. Ideas?

   That's what I did, Wes.

   It turns out that the errors (there were 2) were a small editor status
file owned by root and a gxine socket from several years ago. As soon as I
deleted both of those the 1.5G directory tarred and compressed into an 815M
file.

Thanks,

Thanks.  /etc/sysconfig/kernel does not exist on the machine that 
defaults to the old kernel.  I don't recall manually creating 
/etc/sysconfig/kernel on the other machine.  Does one of the GUI admin 
tools create this file?  Obviously I can just copy the file, but I'm 
curious how I got into this situation.

i have no idea what creates the file.  possibly the installer (anaconda). 
no rpm owns the file.

Some searching suggests that is the case.  It's possible that the 
machine with the missing file was a desktop install versus a server 
install on the other machine.  Anyway, I'll just copy it over.  Thanks

i'm assuming you have one disk with data and one spare.  the safe way is 
to create a broken mirror with the spare drive and "missing" as the 
other piece.  then copy all the data from the current drive to the mirror. 
then reboot off the mirror and add the original drive to the mirror so it 
can resync.  this involves lots of fdisk, mdadm, tar/rsync/cp, etc. so you 
really need to know what you're doing.

Your assumptions re: disk configuration are correct. I will try it!
The ability to create a broken mirror is key. Thanks.

if you hunt around the web, you can probably find a number of howtos (all 
subtly wrong in different ways :-).

Not just safe, the only way: you cannot change regular filesystem into
raid1 one, there is not enough room for the raid superblock (the same
partition formatted for raid will have slightly smaller capacity).

Also, if you want to boot from this raid, you will likely need to
rewrite the initrd image *before* you reboot: unless you already have
raid1 in use, the module won't be included in your initrd.

Subject: [PLUG] Can't mount old drive in Debian
Message-ID: <20091102095625.c8a6e7d1.johnxj@comcast.net>

I installed a new hard drive on which to install Debian. I had intended to place the old hard drive in a USB enclosure that I already had. Unfortunately, the old drive is SATA, and the USB enclosure is not a SATA enclosure. So, instead I opted to place the old drive in the ultrabay frame that I used for my 500 GB backup drive. 

All seemed to go well, but Squeeze is not finding the drive. I get the following:

jjj at Devil8:~$ dmesg |tail

I never use initrd images. I'll be sure the kernel has RAID support
compiled into it before performing the migration.

yep, i forgot about the initrd stuff.  also, you should do the grub magic 
to make sure it is setup happily on the new drive.

Everything else being equal..

I would look in BIOS first..

Is the hard drive recognized by the Motherboard??

Double check  both ends of the connectors..

Is the drive supposed to be hda?  I thought all SATA drives and even
IDE(PATA) drives in newer linux distros would be referred to as sda.

Do you get the same results if you boot up with a LiveCD, e.g.
Knoppix, Fedora, or Ubuntu?

That struck me as odd too. It's definitely a SATA drive, and the
ultrabay adapter is a SATA adapter.

I did not have to try a live CD. I rebooted and when Debian came back
up the drive was automatically mounted.

What I still don't understand is why it did not automount when I
plugged it in. Nor was I able to mount it manually, for failure to know
what its device name was.

Most folks learn the syntax AFTER doing 'rm -fr .*' trying to remove dot files.  They also end up removing the parent directory (..). I hope that wasn't your experience.

Ultrabay drives don't auto-mount in the same way as usb drives /
memory cards.  It's possible to hot-swap drives in an ultra bay, but
(at least with debian) it doesn't "just work".

You probably need to do a fair bit of work to get your system set up
so that you can hot-swap drives that way.  Here's a page about it:

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu to Debian: Day 1
Message-ID: <20091102230102.cc474a0c.johnxj@comcast.net>

Starting Sunday evening I intalled 64-bit Debian Squeeze on a new hard
disk. I saved the old hard disk that has Jaunty x86_64.

Lots of good news:

The GUI installer went into an endless loop repeating an
incompehensible error message. But the text-based installer worked
perfectly. That is, it was perfect except that somehow my user password
was messed up. I don't know how that happened, because you have to type
it twice during the setup. Somehow I managed to mistype it twice in row
the same way. But with Tim Bruce's help I got it fixed.

Then I couldn't install anything because I had no repositories except
for the security repositories. But Paul Mullen's suggestion to use deb
http://debian.oregonstate.edu/debian unstable main non-free contrib,
and the src equivalent, gave me 26,000+ packages. I still don't have a
clear understanding of Debian repos, but at least I have most of the
packages available now and I can deal with figuring out the rest later.
And the oregonstate repo is fast - up to 2.6 MB/s download rate.

The third problem was getting my old hard drive mounted so I could
transfer config files to the new ~/ folder. I still don't completely
understand why it did not automount, but it did mount after rebooting.
Eventually I won't need it any more, so it's not a critical matter.

I have been installing programs that I had on Jaunty, and copying over
the ~/. files. So far I have lost almost no settings. Iceweasel seems
to be happy to use everything that was in ~/.mozilla, including all my
bookmarks, plugins, extensions and themes. Even Sylpheed found all my
folders and e-mails, and also set up my user accounts exactly as they
were in Jaunty. I did lose the current contents of the Inbox, but there
was nothing critical in there.

A shining moment came when I installed Virtualbox. In Jaunty I had
Windows 2000 and Windows XP set up, each with dozens of programs
installed. I was not looking forward to setting them all up again.
Imagine my joy when I discovered that ~/.virtualbox on the old disk was
18.8 GB. I copied it all to ~/ on the new disk and then installed and
launched Virtualbox. Sure enough, there were my virtual machines. And
each boots perfectly with all apps exactly as they were before. Other
than waiting 35 minutes to copy the ~/.virtualbox folder, I didn't have
to do a thing. I fully expected to have to spend the better part of a
day getting those virtual machines set up.

I am also happy to report that my net connection (all ethernet at home)
is way faster that it was in Jaunty. Now, it's pretty unlikely that
Comcast has special faster speeds for people running Debian instead of
Jaunty, so I have to conclude that there must be a better driver for
the gigabit ethernet chip in my Thinkpad.

The setup utility found the wireless chip, but it is not working. The
setup utility asked me to specify which would be the main connection -
ethernet or wireless - and I selected ethernet. I haven't even started
to poke at the wireless to see what is wrong with it. It is an Intel
4965agn, so I am assuming I just need to push a couple buttons
someplace.

Another bit of good news is that the computer now shuts down
completely. In all the time I used Jaunty on this computer it would
shut down X, but leave the kernel running and a dead blinking cursor in
the upper left corner of the screen. (Dead because you couldn't type
anything.) I had to use the power button to finish shutting it down.

The bad news:

One of the important reasons for switching was to get my bluetooth
devices working better. The headphones wouldn't work at all in Jaunty,
although they did work in Hardy. The mouse would quit working every
other day on average and I'd have to delete it and re-pair it. And the
phone would connect, but it was a pain in the neck. 

Well, in Debian the devices are recognized all right, but none of them
are working at all. I have gone from bad to worse.

---------------

Tomorrow the saga cotinues. :)

Michael,

   No, it wasn't. I noticed that I was not including the dot files in the
tarball, and my Google searches didn't help. Galen looked in his UNIX
reference book and sent me the proper syntax. I don't have that book and the
ones I do have don't include this gem.

Thanks,

Rich

That book would be Unix Power Tools.  The suggested expression for 
matching all dot files under Bourne-like shells is '.?? .[!.]'   An 
alternative is '.?? .[^.]'  Note that some ancient shells may not 
support this syntax.

I would have gotten something moving on this but I have been arguing with
the flu for the last week. The AT meeting will best be served in November.

No meeting tonight but I will line up something more solid for November.
 With POSSE running later, I think we should avoid it by a day unless
that further complicates it for people.

I am told that the meeting used to come after POSSE. Any thoughts on the
advantages or disadvantages of this arrangement?

Thank you, this worked great. RAID built successfully. Copying the

Subject: [PLUG] Limiting Internet Access in Linux...
Message-ID: <1257398834.3363.9.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

Is there a way to allow squid and postfix and basically system programs,
but not firefox, to head to the Internet?  Apparently, there is
something in iptables that allows blocking by user name...  anyone 
have a recipe that will do the trick?

Firefox plugins are not an option because there is no way at all to
protect them due to the way firefox is designed, ugh!

A server may have X Windows and firefox and in that event be web surfing
capable, but what if you don't want to allow web surfing from the server
itself?

My server needs to allow it's web server to be accessed from the Net and
block people on it directly from surfing out at the same time.  It is a
mail server in that it can do smtp to a Net host, but it is not imap or
pop accessible from the Net and shouldn't be.  There is a squid instance
on this server that needs to be able to go out to the Net.

I'm thinking something like:

iptables -m user ... is what I need.

Why not just block outgoing port 80 and 443 requests? Problem solved.

No, that doesn't allow local area network access.  It would stop squid
from going out which would break the filtered proxy.

I'm experimenting with:

iptables -A OUTPUT_USER -m owner --uid-owner 500 -j DROP

where 500 is a user id.

You could always deny first then white list local network hosts and add an
allow statement for the proxy although you may need to do a tcpdump to see
if it uses the same port every single time for an outbound request. So you
filter based on the source and destinations for the proxy if the proxy port
is the same each time. I wasn't aware of denials based on user name, so if
you get that working I'd be interesting in seeing how you set it up and how
it works.

No saga for day 2 because I had to work elsewhere all day and ignored
the computer.

Today I received an e-mail response to my query on the CUPS e-list
about migrating my printer drivers from Ubuntu to Debian. I have eight
different drivers installed for four different laser printers.
Reinstalling alone would be a pain because I don't even remember which
PPD file I used for which driver, let alone all the tweaks I have made.
The instructions from the kind person on the CUPS list enabled me to
migrate all my printers intact from Ubuntu to Debian in about five
minutes.

I have also successfully installed now most of the critical software
that I need, and the configuration files from the Ubuntu disk got them
all appearing exactly as before. There are a few left, but the hard
ones are done. There is now a light at the end of the tunnel.

There is one major issue left: My bluetooth mouse. In Jaunty it would
quit periodically and I had to delete it and re-pair it every time in
order to get it working again. In Squeeze I can't get it to work at
all. Nor can I get my cell or headphones to work. I posted a plea for
help on a Debian forum two days ago and so far only half a dozen people
have even read it.

Wireless is another remaining issue that I have not looked into yet.
The wireless LED is not lit up. I need to get someplace with wireless
to tackle it though.

It works like a charm.  What I'm doing is making a 
special chain hooked as rule 1 to the OUTPUT chain.  
I have to do user based packet blocking as dropping 
the user specification I'd probably block legitimate 
access to the Net from squid, postfix, yum,...

As an example where 500 is a normal user...
iptables -A OUTPUT_USER -m owner --uid-owner 500 \
         -d 192.168.0.0/16 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT_USER -m owner --uid-owner 500 \
         -d 127.0.0.1 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT_USER -m owner --uid-owner 500 \
         -j DROP

NOTE that the first rule in the OUTPUT chain is to
jump to the OUTPUT_USER chain and it has to be or
this probably won't work.  Remember that I'm 
firewalling an X enabled server so that people
can't surf the Net from it.  The biggest problem
with allowing surfing of the Net from a server on
the Net is that I can't force the users to go 
through a filter.

Have you checked to see what bluetooth packages are installed?  I've
only ever used bluetooth once to talk to my cell phone (setting a
custom ringtone and background) and havent touched it since.  The
packages I used came from the bluez project.  At least under Debian
unstable, there's a "bluetooth" package as well as many "bluez..."
packages that you may need to install.  Notably, is "bluez-gnome"
installed (if you're using Gnome)?

With any hardware, start from the beginning.  Please provide the
output line for this device that comes out of lspci.

Subject: [PLUG] Lost my window manager
Message-ID: <20091105212115.3384ac6e.johnxj@comcast.net>

Debian testing amd64, fresh install, idiot newbie user four days old.

I had everything pretty much working and configured except for my
bluetooth mouse. Finally I succeeded in getting it working, although I
cannot tell you how. I had installed Blueman, but it couldn't get the
mouse paired either. But then suddenly I had two bluetooth icons in my
Gnome panel. Using System Monitor I killed two bluetooth devices - that
is, killing the first one changed nothing but killing the second one
deleted one of the bluetooth icons. Afterward I was able to get a GUI
dialog box that found the mouse. And this time I had a Next and a Back
button. I was finally able to get the mouse working when I selected
"connect" but "without pairing."

However, the mouse was not working properly. The pointer moved around,
but left clicking did not work. I could select things only by
right-clicking on them. 

After poking around for a while and not finding a solution I decided to
reboot. When X and Gnome came up I got a popup asking if I wanted to
grant permission to the bluetooth mouse. I said Yes, and the mouse then
worked properly; that is, a left click worked as a left click.

Unfortunately, the entire Gnome panel is gone. Clicking on where things
are supposed to be in the panel does nothing. Windows have no title bar
or icons in the corner to minimize or maximize them The keyboard works,
but I cannot launch a terminal because I have forgotten the secret
keyboard shortcut to launch a terminal. The only way I know how to do
it is Applications > Accessories > Terminal, but there is no panel so I
can't click on Appplications. I did get to a command line with
Ctrl-Alt-F1, but I was unable to do anything constructive for failure
to know what the window manager is called or how to restore it.

I also note that, although I logged in as myself, some of my display
preferences were not honored. For example, I had Gnome set not to
display any icons at all on the dekstop. I wanted a dekstop utterly
devoid of anything except the Gnome panel. However, now all the items
contained in the Desktop folder appear on the screen.

I am just about to give up and go back to Ubuntu. I had said at the
outset of my foray into Debian that I would give it a week, but it has
become apparent that I do not have the technical expertise to run
Debian.

The application is written against a version of readline that is
different than the one you have installed. It's looking for symbols
that don't exist in your libreadline.so.

You probably don't want to go messing with your system's readline. A
better approach would be to try a newer (or older?) version of the
application. Maybe file a bug report with the application developer.

Carlos,

   Hmm-m-m. When I grep for readline in the source code directories I find
nothing relevant.

   I've version 5.2 installed here, and I believe that's what the application
is looking for.

Carlos,

   For the time being I configured the application without readline support.
Once I figure out why that's a problem I can re-configure and re-build the
app.

Which is it? Is the application not looking for readline, or is it
looking for readline-5.2? I tend to believe that the application does
depend on readline, otherwise the configure script wouldn't be
checking for it.

What leads you to believe that the application wants readline-5.2, and
not some other version? Does it say so somewhere?

The current version of readline is 6.0.

It might be helpful to see the output of the configure script. Though
I've never tried it, I wonder what would happen if one were to run:

   ./configure 2>&1

Carlos,

   The readline libs are optional.

   That's what someone else has installed and it builds for him.

   Hmm-m. I don't know this is relevant. Apparently readlines is used only if
the python is also optionally included.

laptop used by my wife. Her use is primarily 'Net access (e-mail and Web)
with some AbiWord/OO.o use. It must run linux (of course!), preferably
xubuntu since she's used to that. Moderately large screen, light weight,
lots of RAM, built-in wireless, ... the more modern features.

Carlos,

   The configure script output is in config.log; that's from where I copied
those few lines.

   The application is the GRASS GIS software (version 6.4.ORC5) which has
always been a PITA to build because of its Army/FORTRAN origins where it was
written by folks who knew computational geometry but not how to efficiently
and neatly code. It's still a PITA to build.

I'm looking at the MSI Wind U210. Looks sweet! Don't have one in hand
yet. But the parts spec looks good. I'm not a huge fan of the ATI
video card, but it'll work. It has an ralink WIFI card, which I've
never tried myself, but I see posts that say it works.

The main cool thing is the AMD Neo processor. It ought to outperform
the Intel Atom found in most netbooks. And it's 64-bit. The other cool
thing is the 12 inch screen (1366x768).

Also waiting to see if the 2-proc version will come out in time for
spring semester. It's on the MSI website, but I can't find it on any
retail websites yet. I think it's the Wind U230.

That's good to know. GRASS builds on Gentoo via the portage
package. It could be instructive to see how they pull it off. I'll
look into it after work.

Carlos,

   It turns out that readline is needed only for one 3D modeling of vector
data, and I'll be building the terrain analysis and hydrologic models from
raster data so I don't need it.

Carlos,

   No one has written a SlackBuild script for GRASS, but there are such
scripts for all the accessories: proj, gdal, geos, etc.

Carlos,

   Looks ideal. I assume you've checked that various linux distributions
install; xubuntu will probably detect and self-configure for the hardware.

   We don't need more than the single CPU.

   What I need now is one more paying client and we'll get one.

Many thanks,

Ha ha funny. No, I only considered gentoo. But I did read a post on
the ralink card that was written by a debian user. It said that the
card didn't work initially, but an update to the latest debian (with a
2.6.30 kernel, the key ingredient) fixed it up proper-like. And the
ATI video card will work with fglrx, which is nice because older cards
don't. The CPU conforms to the GCC -march=k8 architecture like all of
AMD's 64-bit offerings.

The Dell Mini 10 comes with Ubuntu installed as an option for $300. This 
should tell you it runs Linux. ;) I've not used on personally but I've 
read positive reviews of them. The Latitude 2100 is the business Netbook 
for a little more. I can speak highly for Dell support when it comes to 
the Lat's.

   Well, then, this looks like less of a hassle (to convert from ubuntu to
xubuntu) and more certainty of being up and running than would the MSI. The
slightly smaller screen probably won't make any difference, either.

Thanks for the information!

I read your original post and didn't reply because of the requirement 
for a large screen. If that's not really a requirement, the Asus Eee 
PC 1000HE is worth your consideration. It runs Eeebuntu very well; 
power management and wireless function correctly; battery life is 
quite good.

seconded (i love mine), but if you are getting any netbook, you should
have the user actually use one for a few minutes before purchasing.
the cramped keyboards and less-than-usual-height-screens can be a
turnoff or unusable for some, but that should be pretty obvious even
when demo'ing the units at a store briefly...

Paul,

   I'll look at this, too. The netbooks I've seen as I've walked past them at
Office Depot look small. I've no idea of the screen size. It may be that the
Dell is too small for her, too.

   We'll check all these out.

Many thanks,

Rich

Chris,

   We will give all the netbooks a test drive. The screens on all of them may
be too small and the MSI might turn out to be the best choice for her.

Message-ID: <4AF49880.20301@gmail.com>

All,

Ok, so this just annoys the piss out of me every time. I have 4 or 5 
tabs open in gnome-terminal and every once in a while I'm too slow on 
the left mouse button and I accidentally detach a tab from the main 
screen. Now I have a separate gnome-terminal window. Does anyone know 
how to re-attach it back to the main window, or otherwise disable this 
$%^&ing feature?

thanks,

This is a hackish workaround, but hey, it does the trick:

   * Open a new tab in the new window (so that the terminal actually
has tabs to grab)
   * drag the desired tab back to the window it started in
   * close the window that now has nothing but the empty terminal you
created, just so you'd have a tab.

I'd be cautious about disabling the tab-disconnection feature, since I
*think* it's a GTK thing.  You may only be able to enable/disable it
for all gtk apps, which could be a bad thing. (or not, depending on
how you operate.)

It might be possible to make gnome terms *always* have a tab bar, but
I don't see that anywhere in the obvious preferences.  (If you could
do that, it might provide you with something to grab ahold of at all
times, so you could just pull the terminal back in place.)

If you *really* like tabs, you could check out fluxbox, which
implements tabbing at the window manager level :)

I found a workaround, which I've just tested.  In window 2, the detached 
session, open a new tab.  This enables the tab bar (I found no setting 
to force its display with only one tab).  Drag the detached session's 
tab to window 1.  Finally, close window 2.

Oddly, although I use tabs in the gnome-terminal all the time, I have
never accidentally detached one. In fact, I didn't even know they were
detachable.

A little experimenting revealed a workaround. In the window from which
you detached the tab be sure there are at least two tabs. What I mean
is that the terminal window does not display the tab bar unless there
are at least two tabs open. You need the tab bar open for this to work,
and I don't see any options for making the tab bar always visible even
when only one tab is open.

Next, go to the new window with the detached tab. Open another tab so
the tab bar becomes visible. Now you can drag tabs from the tab bar in
one window to the tab bar in the other window.

It would be nice if we could make the tab bar visible even when only
one tab is open.

Keyboard usage is the big deal. Our CEO has a Dell and doesn't use it 
as much as she'd hoped because of the keyboard. I wouldn't want to 
work 8-hours days -- or even 4-hour days -- consistently on the Eee 
PC, but it's great at meetings and in the La-Z-Boy at home. It's easy 
to attach a USB keyboard and mouse, and a VGA monitor, when you're 
going to be at a desk for a while.

One issue that hasn't arisen yet is video horsepower.

The standard-issue Intel graphics subsystem is fine for word 
processing, web browsing, and e-mail. Video for, say, Skype is decent. 
YouTube and Hulu videos work, but at 85% to 95% CPU utilization. 
Beyond that, however, and you'll see dropped frames and lots of 
stutter.

If video is really important, I'd wait for the ION-based netbooks to 
mature.

Also -- netbooks typically don't ship with optical-media readers. To 
install Linux, you'll probably want to use a USB stick (unless you've 
already got a USB CD-ROM). The Eee PC boots easily from USB media, and 
I assume that's also the case with the MSI machines.

Finally -- if the machine you purchase ships with Windows, I'd 
strongly suggest using something like Clonezilla to capture an image 
of the hard drive before installing Linux. On one machine, we were 
initially unable to get the onboard NIC to work under Linux. I 
reinstalled the stock Windows drive image and verified that the 
hardware was fine, which led us to a fix in Linux...

All,

Thanks. That keeps me from putting my foot through my screen at least. 
My other workaround was closing my session and reopening. Luck would 
always have it that that was the sessions that I had leapfrogged through 
six different machines, which just drove me nuts reconnecting each time.

I'm not sure whether my pointer finger is getting slower in my old age, 
or it just occurs when the resources hit on the machine (I have a couple 
of vmware images running in the background that suddenly eat memory or 
disk at random times).

Good point about the keyboard. Another nice thing about the MSI is the
nice, large keyboard. The larger format gives the keyboard more space
to breathe. It even has a 102-key layout. This is critical for those
who want to put German stickers on the sucker. The extra key is
immediately to the left of the space bar.

I use Finnix for boot-from-CD operations. I recently looked into
bootable USB options. Finnix has a script that creates a USB stick for
you. I used it to boot a variety of machines, including an Asus
Eee. Use a stick that is 1GB or less; the script creates a USB-ZIP
device. ZIP emulation is apparently still the standard.

Paul,

   Powerful point. I quickly sold my Toshiba Libretto because it was too
small for touch-typing, but a very handy small size.

   The keyboard size is as important to her as the screen size. Since she
works in the den external attachments are not going to be accepted.

   Hasn't been so far, but that could change.

   Good advice. I suppose that booting with a live cd would test this, too.

Much appreciated,

Rich

   ENU has the MSI Wind 10 in stock for $299. We'll go take a look at it
tomorrow. While the screen is smaller (10" vs. 12"), the price is much
smaller, too. If she'll be happy with it, we'll take one home.

   This netbook runs linux according to the fellow at ENU ... xubuntu or
anything else we want to put on it.

   This morning no log report summaries were in my inbox. /etc/cron.daily
scripts apparently ran because the logs rotated as they should. Manual
running of logwatch and pflogsumm also did not put the reports in my inbox.
I've made no changes other than to add a rule to procmail's recipes.rc to
place messages from a particular mail list into a mbox file.

   Earlier this year I had the same issue and I know that I fixed it. But, I
don't recall what I had done to cause the problem nor how I repaired it.
This thread is in the list archives somewhere, but I would prefer to not
look month-by-month to find it.

   What is the recommended procedure to search for this thread so I can see
if the information is relevant to today's lack of messages.

TIA,

   The two recipes I added yesterday were these:

:0:
* ^TO_ .grass-user at lists.osgeo.org
GIS

:0:
* ^Subject: .*[GRASS-user]
GIS

   ... and every incoming message since then ended up in ~/mail/GIS, where I
found them a few minutes ago.

   I think the reason they ended up here was a line in ~/.pinerc that was
directing all messages from Incoming-Mail to ~/mail/GRASS rather than
~/mail/GIS. Why I ever had two files for this I don't know. But, I changed
~/.pinerc to reflect the procmail recipes, and have (for today, anyway)
commented out those recipes just to verify they are the cause of the
problem.

   Amazing how I can dig a hole and fall in without being aware of the
potential trap.

   Thanks, Drew and Michael, for your responses.

Subject: [PLUG] To bash or not to bash?
Message-ID: <4AF597E9.3060104@gisnet.com>

Using bash, is there a way to produce a single-column file listing that 
includes the full path name for each file? I've got a directory of 
directories that I need to traverse and list all the Shapefiles (*.shp) 
it contains by subdirectory.  The full path name is needed because it's 
going to feed the next process, which is to reproject the data  The best 
I've been able to come up with is:

$ ls -1 BLM/* | egrep ':$|\.shp' | grep -v \.xml
(list everything under the BLM directory but include only those lines 
that end in a colon (the pathname) or contain a shapefile extension (.shp))

which produces the pieces I need:

BLM/Areas_of_Critical_Env_Concern:
BLM_ACECs_2009.shp
BLM/BLM_ACEC:
BLM_ACECs_2009.shp
BLM/BLM_ALL:
BLM_ALL_2005.shp
BLM_CANCA_2008.shp
BLM_CANCAp_2008.shp
...

but what I want is:

BLM/Areas_of_Critical_Env_Concern/BLM_ACECs_2009.shp
BLM/BLM_ACEC/BLM_ACECs_2009.shp
BLM/BLM_ALL/BLM_ALL_2005.shp
BLM/BLM_ALL/ BLM_CANCA_2008.shp
...

Is there something clever I can do to produce a file listing like the last one? I've looked trhough ]the man pages on ls, but either I just didn't understand what it said or I knew that the option wouldn't work. Or is this now a job for awk or something that can handle multiple records at a time?

Thank you!

find . -name \*\.shp -o -type d

[] is special in regular expressions.  you were saying to match anything 
that had the letters G, R, A, S, S-u, s, e, r into GIS.  the S-u was the 
killer becuase that matches everything between S and u, which include a-u.

YES! Thanks for the fast response too. This works just about the way I 
want it. Only one more step required and that's to filter out the lines 
that have JUST the directory in them. Easy to do though. Just append "| 
grep \.shp" and I've got Kibbles & Bits (well, the Bits at least) to 
feed a hungry process.

BTW, that find command looks particularly useful. But I bet it can be 
pretty dangerous if mis-handled. (like fire; a wonderful servant, but a 
terrifying master.)

if you don't want directories, just remove the -type d flag.

Subject: [PLUG] Lost window manager and Gnome panel (Debian testing)
Message-ID: <20091107093431.fb54712c.johnxj@comcast.net>

Debian testing amd64, fresh install, idiot newbie user.

I had everything pretty much working and configured except for my
bluetooth mouse. Finally I succeeded in getting it working, although I
cannot tell you how. I had installed Blueman, but it couldn't get the
mouse paired either. But then suddenly I had two bluetooth icons in my
Gnome panel. Using System Monitor I killed two bluetooth devices - that
is, killing the first one changed nothing but killing the second one
deleted one of the bluetooth icons. Afterward I was able to get a GUI
dialog box that found the mouse. And this time I had a Next and a Back
button. I was finally able to get the mouse working when I selected
"connect" but "without pairing."

However, the mouse was not working properly. The pointer moved around,
but left clicking did not work. I could select things only by
right-clicking on them. 

After poking around for a while and not finding a solution I decided to
reboot. After logging in I got a popup asking if I wanted to
grant permission to the bluetooth mouse. I responded Yes, and the mouse
then worked properly; that is, a left click worked as a left click. It
has been working fine ever since.

Unfortunately, the entire Gnome panel was gone. Also, windows had no
title bar or icons in the corner to minimize or maximize them The
keyboard worked, but I couldn't launch a terminal because I have
forgotten the secret keyboard shortcut to launch a terminal. The only
way I know how to do it is Applications > Accessories > Terminal, but
there was no panel so I couldn't click on Appplications. I did get to a
command line with Ctrl-Alt-F1, but I was unable to do anything
constructive for failure to know what the window manager is called or
how to restore it when not in X.

Eventually I found that by right-clicking anywhere on the desktop I got
a popup wiith various options, one of which was "create launcher." I
created a launcher for "gnome-terminal" and finally was able to get a
terminal up. Using the terminal I finally discovered that for some
reason metacity and gnome-panel were not started during the boot/login
process.

At this point I have a working desktop, but after every boot I must run 

nohup metacity &
nohup gnome-panel &

I know there are startup scripts, but I have never poked at them
before. I assume I can edit what I need with a text editor or nano. I
hope there is a Debian user here who can point me to the correct script
that needs editing. I am also hoping that looking at the startup script
will shed some light on how this bizarre mess happened.

In spite of the issues that I have had getting Debian testing working,
I am liking it so far. 

I also tried the live CD of Karmic. Just as with all previous versions
of Ubuntu on my Thinkpad, it does not shut down completely. And, while
I was able to get the bluetooth mouse working, it died randomly and had
to be restarted. Having worked with Debian for a few days, I am not very
impressed with Karmic.

But you said you wanted them..."but include only those lines
that end in a colon (the pathname)"

to get just the shp files is even easier:

find . -name \*\.shp

or in general terms

find <starting directory> -name <name regex>

I do want the directories-- as a prefix on the filename. I don't need 
them by themselves. Sorry if I wasn't clear. This operation is for a 
process that requires a complete filename up to the root, and it eats 
files. But you've given me what I need and so I'm getting things done 
(but doing it today 'cause I couldn't get anything done yesterday.)

This may not be relevant for your situation, but just in case...

It's not unusual to pipe the output of find to the xargs command.  One 
thing to watch out for when doing this is filenames that contain 
spaces.  A pipe like this will have problems if any of the filenames 
contain spaces:
   find . -name '*.txt' | xargs grep foo

To deal with spaces in filenames, the command needs to be changed to this:
   find . -name '*.txt' -print0 | xargs -0 grep foo

I've been a Debian user for a long time, and have never had to edit
any startup scripts to get Gnome (or KDE) up and running properly. Do
you have an ~/.Xsession or ~/.xinitrc file doing something odd? Did
you accidentally pick a different session from the GDM login screen?
Something must be broken, somewhere.

I'm not a Debian user but I might suggest creating a new user to test with
and see if their desktop is broken the same way. If it isn't then it's
probably something in the  dot files that might have been moved over from
your Ubuntu installation (just a guess) ..

Also I think this is a file system wildcarding (?) not a Perl(-ish) 
regex so the \. isn't needed.

    find . -name \*.shp should work just fine.

   The netbooks are too small for us. I've checked linux on laptops and don't
see the low end Toshibas listed. While I know from experience that linux
supported the Libretto, Portege, and Tecra, I cannot find whether the
Satellite L455-S5975 or L455D-S5976 are completely supported by linux.

   Anyone here know about these models? They have a 15.6" screen, Intel
Celeron 2.2GHz CPU, 2G DDR2 RAM, 260G hard drive, and Realtek wireless LAN
(802.11b/g). It's heavy (at 5.9 pounds), but ... I won't be lugging it
anywhere. Best Buy sells 'em for $330.

Perhaps a System76 (http://www.system76.com/) model would fit your needs. 
Guaranteed compatibility with the Ubuntu that is intalled on it.

This is my best guess too.  The output of:

ps auxww

run from a terminal *just* after you login (before running metacity &
gnome panel) could help narrow the problem down.

You can save the output to a file with >  eg:

PLUG strips attachments, so you'll have to paste the content into a

I'd use an Ubuntu live CD. Ubuntu is probably the most plug and play of
the distros these days, so it is the most likely to autodetect and
configure hardware.

Rather than poke through dmesg I am a big fan of real world hands-on
testing. If it works, cool. If not, on to the next machine.

Sound:	The Ubuntu live CD has that drumroll when it starts. If
you hear it, then sound is working.

Video:	Before going to the store look up the specs for the
machine to see what the native video resolution is. When you have
booted Ubuntu go into Preferences > Display to see if the resolution
matches. If not, move on to the next machine. Fixing video problems is
more pain than it is worth if you haven't yet bought the machine. As a
second consideration, lappies these days come with nVidia, ATI or Intel
video. ATI currently has a bad reputation with Linux. nVidia has very
good Linux support, but from everything I read they suck a lot of power
- not cool if you need to be on battery a lot. Intel gets good reviews
for power usage, but sometimes you can't get fancy stuff to work -
e.g., compiz.

Wireless:	If there is no ethernet cable connected, then Ubuntu
should show an icon with bars in the upper right of the Gnome panel.
(Sometimes the icon is a couple of monitor screens instead of the
bars.) Click on it to see if any wireless networks were detected.
Chances are excellent that there are a couple wireless networks
available in the store. You don't actually have to connect to them. If
Ubuntu sees wireless networks, then you know it found and configured
the wireless card. There could still be issues with WPA and other
stuff, but at least you know the wireless works at a basic level.

Ethernet:	It is unusual to find an ethernet device that Linux
does not support these days. Still, I would do lspci to see if the boot
process found the ethernet device, and then ifconfig to see if it shows
up. The output from those commands is short and can be read quickly in
the store when you have a nervous sales droid peering over your
shoulder. 

You might also bring a USB stick with you and write the output of dmesg
to it. That way you can take the dmesg output home to read it in detail.

Of course, before getting out my plastic I would also Google my tail
off on the specific model to see if there are any Linux gotchas.

   Thank you, Michael. We're going to look at the Toshiba Satellite at Best
Buy.

   Interesting factoid: Best buy sells the L455-S5975 which has an Intel
Celeron CPU while Mall-Wart sells the L455D-S5976 which has an AMD Semperon
CPU. Same amount of RAM and same capacity hard drives.

   Well, I can't afford to lose my tail, but I have looked for linux and

It has the drumroll when you get to the login screen, but sometimes
mine seems to skip that on the live CD, but the base ubuntu has a
whole long login sound associated with it. I'm having a hard time
figuring out how to describe it. But yeah, you should hear something.
My laptop isn't fully supported with the wireless card off of the live
cd, but if you wait a bit it popped up and asked if I wanted to
install restricted drivers - it was asking about ndiswrapper. My hard
drive failed on my laptop, and running off of the live cd it's
unreliable - I think it tries to use a small portion of the hard drive
as swap? I took out the drive and it doesn't really like that all that
much, either. My point in all of this is that for me the live cd
wouldn't work very well when trying to make wireless work. So my
laptop is really unusable until I get a new drive.

On that note, does anyone know where to get a drive for a decent
(cheap) price? I could even buy a small capacity one - the laptop just
needs room for a basic ubuntu install. I will likely end up getting
one in January if I don't find a really cheap one before that. I'm
thinking 10GB would be plenty. Anyway, I'm not in a rush at all, it
would just make my life a little easier to have the laptop usable.
Does Free Geek carry laptop drives? This is an old style parallel ATA
one. I know I can get brand new ones for $60-80 that are pretty big,
compared to what I'm used to. It had a 60GB drive that was never full.

   At Best Buy they have their demo software configured so the machine cannot
be booted from the cdrom (i.e., the boot order has the hard disk first).

   So, we bought the Toshiba L455-S5975 with the Intel Celeron CPU. The sales
guy was nice enough to let me have the 3 recovery cdroms at no charge since
they'd be used only if we cannot get everything to work with the linux
installation.

   Yeah, I'll get this tuned if I need to do so. The display looks OK on the
wide screen and if I need to modifly /etc/xorg.conf I'll do so.

   Not with xubuntu and not with our wireless access point at home. I'll put
her /home directory on the new box then see how it works. May need to copy
from the old /etc, too.

After fiddling today I have discovered more stuff that is broken:

Clicking on Places > Home Folder gives an error message "no application
is registered to handle this file." Ditto for Places > Desktop. But
Places > Computer opens a Nautilus window from which I can display ~/
and ~/Desktop and anything else in the filesystem. Strange.

Printing is messed up. I have a lot of printer drivers installed in
Jaunty because I do book publishing. I copied /etc/cups/printers.conf
and the entire contents of /etc/cups/ppd folder from my old Jaunty
drive to the new Debian installation. I have not tried everything, but
printing to at least one of the printers works perfectly. However, just
now I tried printing to another printer and I can't get any kind of
output. I can ping the printer, and Manage Print Jobs shows the print
job normally, but nothing is coming out of the printer. Unfortunately,
the Test Page button is grayed out for all the printers. 

At the moment I need to print 250 copies of a book that I just received
from a PSU professor. This is a sort of rush job because the books have
to get to Sierra Leone no later than the end of the month. Plus I want
to print it during the current rainy days when I can't do construction
work. So I am going to put my Jaunty drive back in for a few days until
I get the print job done. 

After I get the book printed I am going to start over with Debian
testing. That is, I think I am just going to wipe the current
installation on the new hard drive and start over. I have created
nothing critical. The time I spent was mostly devoted to figuring out
how to do stuff, not actually doing it. The reinstall should go much
faster. At this point there is just too much that is messed up. I
suspect Blueman as the culprit, because all the trouble started after I
installed it.

Subject: [PLUG] Anti Linux attitude in ReactOS community...
Message-ID: <1257648017.7036.12.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

Anyone know why there is such a strong anti Linux mentality in the
ReactOS community?  I simply asked that people not bad mouth Linux
on the forums and got flamed intensely.  I'll admit that my version
of wine doesn't 100% support Microsoft Office 2003, though I wonder 
if a newer release of wine will more than ever?

ReactOS is currently held up with the 0.3.11 release falling behind
the target release date because of apparently a major bug.

There are people on the forums claiming to be individuals who have
worked on the Linux kernel and claiming to be authorities on just
how "crappy" it is.  One person even went so far as to defend Windows
as a server system claiming he has gotten up times of nearly a year
or longer.

I've tried to suggest that bad mouthing Linux won't attract more 
people to ReactOS, but my pleas seem to be falling on deaf ears.

They are having so much trouble getting ReactOS together that I
wonder if the whole project isn't simply a mistake?  How hard is
it to write advanced application programs for Linux?  How hard
is it in reality for people who understand Windows to get used to
Gnome or KDE?  I'd say not very hard compared to the effort it is
taking for ReactOS to go nowhere fast.

In a sense, the ReactOS project failing to produce a decent OS will
be unfortunate.  A direct alternative to Microsoft Windows is 
needed, though I question whether that alternative needs to be
driver and application program compatible or not.

Another thing that constantly gets derided in the ReactOS 
community is GCC which makes me think that the developers 
don't know what they are doing.

I realize this a Linux forum and not a ReactOS one, but I figure someone
may want to comment on the anti Linux rhetoric that is coming from those
in the ReactOS community.

/me reaches for the sarcasm bucket...
Because, clearly, contributors to both open source projects should drop 
everything and instead argue with people on the internet.

I have written an operating system which is far superior to all others 
because it has zero bugs.  Now try to tell me that having zero features 
is some kind of drawback and we'll have us an argument.  Come on!

Wouldn't it be easier to put a transparent squid proxy upstream of the
connection, rather than mucking with ugly iptables rules per user,
etc.

I should think in terms of compatibility that the 2 most common issues would
be the video and wireless. Intel is pretty reasonably supported as I have
one that I'm using right now and have had success with Fedora 11, Slackware
11,12, 13 and Moblin. Nvidia stuff works pretty well with the nv driver and
of course the proprietary blob. I have had less success with the ATI stuff
which I've noticed ships with a lot of the AMD CPU's now since they merged
companies.

Wireless cards so far haven't been a problem for me either with mostly
Atheros based stuff and I am sure I've seen the realtek supported if not in
the kernel by some open source modules released by Realtek themselves.

I have a Sony Vaio that I got at Best Buy a couple years ago for sub $500
and it has worked very well with Linux so it might be another option.

No, squid unfortunately doesn't always work.  Try watching a movie on
Hulu through a squid proxy.  Another thing, I'm not sure how to
configure squid to deny Net access entirely.  I don't think the iptables
rules are all that ugly.  Blocking packets based on destination network
and user is the simplest way I can think of to stop Net access.

   Other than /etc/host* and /etc/cups/* are there other configuration files I
ought to transfer from the old laptop to the new one to ease the transition?

If this new machine is to replace nearly exactly the old PC, I'd archive 
everything in /etc that has a modification date newer than about April 
2009.  I'd save apt/*, fstab (for one-off and remote mount defines), 
backup settings, fonts, sudoers, group, hosts.*, and so on.

Any reason not to tar up and copy all of them?

On my system it's only 4 MB completely tar.gz'ed.

$ sudo tar -czf /tmp/etc.tar.gz /etc/
tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
$ dir --si /tmp/etc.tar.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4.1M 2009-11-08 14:26 /tmp/etc.tar.gz

That way if you need them, you've got them.

Regards,

Robert,

   That was my first inclination. After all, both the current and new
installations are xubuntu-9.04, so perhaps only video configurations will
differ.

   Well, I've been check-mated by xubuntu. I tarred the 11M /etc directory on
the old Toshiba Tecra onto a USB flash drive (1.3M file size). When I
connect the flash drive to the new Toshiba Satellite it shows the files
group as 'root'. If I mount it on my server, the file is owned by
rshepard.users, but on her new machine it's owned by pamela.root. Sigh.

   I cannot copy the file to the new machine. It won't copy to her home
directory (permission denied), and I cannot copy it to / since there is not
yet a root password. What a hassle!

   Even working in a virtual console using 'sudo' I cannot copy the file.

   Is there a way for me to create a password for root so I can su to that
account and move the file to / for untarring into /etc/?

Thanks,

Rich

   I wonder why, then, it's only 1.3M as a .tgz file here.

I would not recommend blindly copying all of /etc from one machine to
another, even between machines that are similar. Is there some
specific configuration you wish to preserve?

Now you know why I poo-poo Ubuntu. I hate the whole let's-hide-root
thing.

Try "sudo bash" to get a real root shell. If that works, do a "passwd"
to set root's password.

Heath,

   I was going to copy only the user, network, and printer configuration
files (host*, cups/), The suggestion was made to copy everything because
both machines have the same version of xubuntu installed and I want to
facilitate getting the new machine working. I want to copy all the /etc/
files I need so that the new machine knows users, network hosts, and
printers. Don't know that I need more than that; apt repositories, perhaps?

   I'm not used to working without a root account, and I don't know my way
around xubuntu or the Debian distributions as I do with Slackware. (I've
forgotten almost all I knew about Red Hat by now.)

users.

   Hoo-ha! That worked. I was unaware of the 'sudo bash' trick. How useful!

   OK. I now have my root password on the new box.

   Can I get a consensus from all you professional SysAdmins on what I ought
to transfer in /etc/ to get this new box working on our network?

Thanks to all for the sound advice,

   Yeah. Proceeding cautiously I copied the tarball to / and extraced only
/etc/hosts*, /etc/ssh/*, and /etc/resolv.conf. I certainly don't want to
change /etc/fstab to the old host's contents. I'm sure there are more things
to not change, too.

   Rebooted the box and it saw the wireless network. Now I need to set up a
route for it. I assume that the ubunutus use a GUI interface for that rather
than 'route -add net ...'. So, I go look for that.

   Getting closer! Probably won't be totally functional tonight, but some
time this week.

Again, thanks,

Rich

   Time for me to subscribe again to the xubuntu Web forum. I cannot find the
network configurator on the menu, and xfce doesn't want to shut down from
the menu because 'the session manager must be in an idle state.' That's a
new one on me!

TTFN,

I can't address issues other than printers. But in the process of migrating from Ubuntu Jaunty to Debian testing I asked on the CUPS e-list that I am subscribed to. I have copied and pasted the discussion below:

Helge,

A thousand thanks. That worked perfectly. It saved me hours of work.

I did have a couple issues:

1) I have no idea what "all the filters and backends" refers to. I
ignored the instruction and apparently suffered no evil in doing so.

2) I had to google to find out that you stop cups by changing
to /etc/init.d/cups/ and issuing the command ./cups stop, and start
again by the command ./cups start. I add that information here in case
someone else as dumb as me reads this thread in the future.

Thanks again!

Be careful.  Ubuntu is designed to work without a root password, just
like Mac OS X.  Creating a root password is OK, if you are aware of
all the side effects and back doors that it potentially opens.

Interesting.  I would have proceeded even more cautiously:

1) backup my existing /etc/ to /etc.orig/ and tar it up to /root/etc.orig.tar.gz
2) extract the transfered tar.gz file into /tmp
3) copy the files from /tmp/etc/ to /etc/ that I think I might need
4) test, reverting to the backup /etc/ files if needed

One of the nice things about gnu tar is that it strips the leading
slash (/) so that you can do things like step 2.

Those communities have pretty active lists I generally participate in

What is the general acceptance of talk of other unixes here?

I have a fairly big interest in Open Solaris Brent so I have no problems

Hello all:

I am trying to find a good flash drive (8 to 32 gig size) that is 
formattable to ext2 (from the usual ntfs)

By past experience I have also found that copying small files onto the 
vob seems very slow.

Has anyone had good experience with a vob that lives up to its reputed 
USB 2.0 speed and can be (re)formatted to the linux world?

You have many variables in determining what the actual transfer rate.
It is not just the OS and the flash drive, but for usb the connection is a
big variable too.
When I was doing functional testing, the test suite would show a large
number of retries for what appeared to be a good connection.
Re-inserting the usb connection could change the number of retries in either
direction.

PLUG decodes as Portland Linux Unix Group (although being an informal
group, some still consider Portland Linux Users Group to be equally
correct).  Back in the olden days, as Linux was ramping up, the
Portland Unix Users Group was (I understand, I wasn't there) kind of
folding up its tent, and it was made known that PUUG people were
welcome at PLUG.  At least that's the mythology I am familiar with.
Again, I don't know that first hand.

I haven't experienced a fob that I couldn't reformat as ext2 or even
LVM2 with logical partitions.
They normally come pre-formated as fat(12/16/32) depending on the
size.  Haven't seen
on that came formated as  NTFS.  The only ones that seem problematic
are the ones
that have the pre-loaded launcher software like the U3 packages.  Normally these
have this software in a hidden partition and require DOS or Windows
software package to
remove it from the device.  Once removed, even those devices work well.

As a side note; we have been using USB FOBs as root file systems for
about two years.
Only two failures in that time and reformating recovered both of them.

Subject: [PLUG] grub problems or is it the noobie administrator?
Message-ID: <4AF8B389.1030800@gmail.com>

Well, it looks like I shot myself in the foot good and need the 
assistance of a person intimately acquainted with grub.

I allowed Ubuntu to upgrade from 9.04 to 9.10 on my Toshiba laptop, but 
something went wrong with apt's autoremove configurator and some 
graphics library files got removed, so that Ubuntu would NOT boot into a 
GUI but stayed in run level 2.

I reformatted the hard drive and reinstalled Ubuntu 9.04 (with the idea 
in mind of updating the 9.04 with my backup disk) and everything went 
well. I then booted knoppix 6.01 in order to update all the folders on 
the harddisk (two partitions /(root) and /boot) and rebooted only to run 
in trouble during the boot sequence.  The UUID's didn't match and the 
load failed, Ubuntu opening a maintenance session.  (well, I had 
symbolically linked the wrong vmlinuz and initrd images in the root 
partition to the boot partition)

Realizing that I needed to run "update-grub" on both the /boot partition 
and the / (root) partition, I rebooted knoppix and mounted them as you 
would expect and ran "update-grub" and the command seemed to work.

However booting still fails, although grub does display all 3 initrd 
images, but says "file not found" after trying.  Is the MBR hosed?

I did follow the "fix" steps in Ubuntu, of

1. grub
2. find /boot/grub/stage1
3. root (hd0,0) (which step #2 finds)
4. setup (hd0,0)
5. reboot

but no such luck.

I mounted the CD run only session of Ubuntu 9.04 and tried to mount the 
partitions again, and run either the grub commands or the update-grub, 
but with no success.

What am I missing?   I could reformat the hard disk again and reinstall 
Ubuntu 9.04 but then I have a backup disk with 2 more changes in the 
linux kernel which will have to be updated.  I really would like to get 
Ubuntu 9.04 updated, then allow apt to update into version 9.10 again.

Any ideas?

This probably isn't too helpful, but why not just back up your data and 
do a clean install of 9.10 at this point?

i tried upgrading my 64-bit 9.04 installation, and got pretty well hosed 
when one key package (rarian-compat) couldn't update. Booted from a live 
cd and downloaded it manually, still couldn't get it to install, so i 
just repartitioned my drive, formatted to ext4, did a clean install, 
restored my data & additional apps. That took a little less time the the 
botched upgrade and attempts to fix it.

I am not intimately familiar with Grub, but I have danced with it on
occasion. I can offer a couple facts which may help.

First, you don't need to state the drive as a UUID. Grub is happy to
take regular nomenclature like "/dev/sda2" at least on the menu line.
But in case you want the UUID the following copy and paste from my
Cheatsheet file will get it for you (change "hda2" to whatever your
drive is):

Command to get UUID when fixing Grub menu.lst file:
sudo tune2fs -l /dev/hda2

Second, if you install Ubuntu 9.04 it will use regular Grub. If you
thereafter upgrade 9.04 to 9.10 Ubuntu will keep regular Grub. But if
you do a fresh install of 9.10 Ubuntu will use Grub2. I am not at all
familiar with Grub2, but I remember reading that drives now start with
1 instead of 0. Thus, what was hd0 in Grub has become hd1 in Grub2. But
I think the "/dev" nomenclature on the menu line remains the same.

It seems that nobody here uses Mandriva. The new version 2010 is quite nice.
It's equal to Ubuntu, which I use as well.

Give it a try... http://distrowatch.com/?newsid=05749

The KDE version is the best I've seen. And I'm a Gnome user overall.

I have used Mandriva since Mandrake 9.x, when it out performed (my 
opinion) Red Hat on a laptop, hands down.  I liked ...
    9, 10, 2007, 2008 (still running 2008 on two desktops - my last 
laptop fried itself - I think that it may have some faulty capacitors 
from the "capacitor-plague")
... not too impressed with ...
    2009
... am considering ...
    2010

They went commercial, but I think you can still get the basic distro as 
a free download (maybe someone else knows for sure?) - at any rate, 
their (commercial) download version isn't priced outrageously high and 
one can then load it on as many boxes as one likes.

They did, but there is still a free version.

I got bit badly by Mandriva. I signed up to get the latest version with
a credit card, only to discover that what I signed up for was a $50 a
month charge - which was not stated on the website. When I tried to
cancel I could find no options on the website for cancellation. I
e-mailed them (in France) and got no response. Finally, I told my bank
to dishonor the charges. Only then did they respond. And the response
was that if I did not pay they would turn me over to collections.

I'd run Windows before I'd run Mandriva.

Pretty splash, nifty startup sound?  No, not really - your mileage may 
vary, but it has been pretty much hassle free for me.  I have tried some 
others including an earlier version of Ubuntu, and I have never found 
one that was as hassle free - but then that really is personal opinion, 
as I said.  Another respondent mentioned a money issue with Mandriva - I 
have never heard of the "$50/month" thing mentioned, but I will say that 
Mandriva's selling site is sometimes a bit difficult to understand and I 
would stay away from subscription schemes (theirs or anyone else's for 
that matter).  But I have never had a problem when just paying the one 
time price (box or download).

Off the subject, but I got into a nasty with O'Reilly Books over an 
online subscription deal - as I said, I would stay away from 
subscription schemes.

PS:  I only replied in the first place because it was suggested that no 
one was using Mandriva - it seems cost may be a major factor in that (as 
in commercial), and I cannot say as I should hold that against anyone in 
opting for something else.  I just meant I use it and like it.  But as 
with any product (commercial or not), there are pluses and minuses, and 
my feel for it is just that, and only that.

You are very correct. It's important to know that there are people out there
that had good experiences. If you didn't speak up, we would have one less.
Until then, I knew literally no one that had used Mandriva with good
success.

It sounds like you're mixing grubs; grub on your knoppix disc is probably
"legacy grub" while ubuntu has moved to grub2.  Probably you'll want to
just do a clean install of ubuntu which will install grub2 and set it up.
If you want to revert back to the old grub there is a wiki page on the
ubuntu site that outlines the process.  Things get a lot weirder if, like
me, you're multi-booting using a different bootloader that needs to
chain-load grub from the linux partition's VBR.  gurb2 apparently isn't
intended for such use so I had to blow away the grub2 stuff and install
legacy grub to the partition's superblock.  Big fun...

Good luck!

Jeff:

You are exactly correct.  I was mixing grubs with no good effect.  It 
just was getting too grubby.

I installed Ubuntu 9.10 fresh and will put my folders into the /home 
area and will slowly rebuild from there.

A painful lesson again, but it has taught me a little more of what 
really has to be backed upon on my backup disks.

Message-ID: <1257833498.4919.7.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

Has anyone been able to watch a movie on Hulu through a squid proxy?

It seems to effectively filter an Internet connection that one has to
use a proxy outfitted with say Dansguardian.  Great, problem is some
sites seem to be incompatible with Squid.  There is Procon Latte, but
that is not an enforceable approach and in general this plugin is far
too inaccurate for my liking.

Has anyone done server side proxyless filtering?  The only proxyless
filtering approach I know of is to use iptables to block Net access
which is not what I'm needing.

I wonder if my Pentium III server is just simply too slow to serve a
movie from Hulu via Squid?

I've used Mandriva almost exclusively for years, after trying an early
Red Hat, with occasional trials of SuSE, Ubuntu, even Gentoo (briefly).
The Free version is complete, including even non-free graphics drivers.

It's gotten steadily, incrementally better over the years. I am running
2009.1 on this desktop but have 2010.0 on two small backup hard drives,
both the Gnome and KDE versions. I'm still testing but will choose one.

Mandriva has a more sophisticated installation procedure than Ubuntu, I
believe, and the system administration functions are more comprehensive
as well. It's always been user friendly, but this release is very solid.

The software package manager is as good or better than Ubuntu's Synaptic
in my opinion. There is a full set of good hardware configuration tools,
network tools, system administration tools, local disk partitioning and
sharing, firewall and security administration, monitoring and auditing,
and boot management. Mandriva keeps adding, refining these capabilities.

Mandriva One is free and works as well as Ubuntu, Mint, openSuse, and
Fedora!

Has the best wifi connection I've found.

   FWIW: I've been a subscriber to Slackware since I switched to it in 2003.
Whenever a new version is released I eventually get the boxed cd set for a
very reasonable price. I do it because I have no objections to supporting
Pat and the team who keep this distribution up and running.

   He's kept this distribution going since he first released it in 1991 and I
have no qualms about his making money from his effort. While Slackware may
not immediately recognize all installed hardware, I don't change hardware
that frequently that this is an issue for me. And, there's plenty of help to
get everything working. It's well back from the bleeding edge so it's more
stable than are hills between the Cascade Mountain crest and the Pacific
Ocean, yet there is a terriffic group who write and support SlackBuild
scripts for a huge range of tools and applications that are not part of the
standard distribution.

   We all have diffeent needs and preferences. One of the most powerful,
positive selling points about linux is the plethora of choices. Many
distributions and, usually, many options for applications (e.g., at least 18
different vector drawing programs last time I looked).

Are you using caching with Squid, if so that might be your problem.  Have you tried telling Squid not to cache that server address, I believe there is a nocache option.  Also proxying streaming video is counter productive, and your poor Pentium III is way underpowered for any Web 2.0 traffic.

Subject: [PLUG] Mandriva verses what I use...
Message-ID: <1257865424.3136.19.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I'm a heavy CentOS user.  The reality is, enterprise distributions 
of Linux like Slackware and CentOS tend be rock solid stable, but 
they aren't cutting edge.  I wonder for example if a newer version 
of Crossover Linux Standard will support the mathematical fonts I 
need in Microsoft Word 2003 better?  Can I run the newest version 
of Crossover Linux Standard on CentOS?  The answer is probably
no.  The cutting edge Linux distributions are impressively stable,
Fedora will work as a server system.  Thing is, cutting edge
distributions are unstable from the standpoint that the features
they support are not necessarily appropriate for prime time yet.
I don't know much about Mandriva but it sounds like it is closer
to Fedora than say CentOS or Slackware.  How often does Mandriva
come out?  Yearly?  Semi annually?  Monthly?  The ideas that Enterprise
distributions of Linux like Slackware and CentOS are the way to go are
problematic from the standpoint that these distros clearly don't work
as well for Desktop use as say Fedora, Ubuntu, Mint, and possibly also
Mandriva.  For a desktop system one needs to run the latest version of
wine and the latest drivers, neither of which are necessarily stable.

I think anything shorter than a 1 year time period for a release doesn't
make sense.  A 10 year time period is a long time release where the
feature set is going to get quite ancient by the time the next release
comes on line.  Linux needs to advance in certain areas and this can
make enterprise distributions of Linux seem like poor choices compared
to non enterprise distributions.  Thing is, there is a trade off that
must be recognized between being advanced and being stable/reliable.
If Linux supports what you need to do today, CentOS and Slackware might
be the best choices for you.  If, however, you need the cutting edge 
mathematical font support in Word 2003 under Crossover Linux, then 
maybe Mandriva and a frequent update regimen is the way to go.
Old 4.x versions of CentOS for example do not support the latest
Dansguardian releases.  I'm not sure when iptables started supporting
user based packet filtering.  Linux still needs to improve in some
areas and generally speaking it is.

A cutting edge Linux distribution can be a better choice on a server
than a non cutting edge distribution depending on what the server has
to do and how careful you are about avoiding the use of unstable
features.

Increasingly I need to think about switching from CentOS 5.x on my
desktop to something else where Ubuntu hasn't seemed to be the right
choice.

Slackware isn't considered enterprise nor a server distro. You can find
updated packages and things that Patrick doesn't normally release as he just
does security updates once a release is in the wild.

Thanks for the tip.  Speaking of processing power and memory, how much
of both does one need to cache a movie streamed from Hulu successfully?
Will dansguardian work with caching turned off?  Servers tend to be
older computers from the standpoint that it is common to run them for
a long time.  An old computer is practically speaking any computer that
is currently in use by someone.  That's a technological reality which
has it's pluses and minuses.  The latest quad core technology doesn't
seem that expensive, but what would it give me to upgrade say my
Internet gateway from a PIII to a quad core system and what would that
upgrade cost?

I guess the more common question is when will Squid not work and why?
The use a newer computer than a PIII seems to answer that question
partially.  A more in depth discussion of when will Squid not work
and why could be very helpful to me.

Just in the interest of science, I just ran a Hulu SNL clip and monitored my
PIII firewall with the program top.  The processor was always above 98%
idle; top often showed 100% idle.  If memory serves, a PIII firewall can
handle a T1 line.  My firewall is not running squid.   I haven't bothered
with squid as I think it would pay only when different systems access the
same content at nearly the same time; not likely for my network.  The SNL
clip played well, although the content wasn't that good, the latter probably
not the fault of the firewall.

Onward.

Subject: [PLUG] Can't figure out jigdo
Message-ID: <20091110095109.0b06ac9f.johnxj@comcast.net>

I am preparing for a reinstall of Debian testing, x86_64. Last time I
used six DVDs; this time I want to do a netinst. That is, I want to
download the 148 MB CD image and install the rest over the internet.

The problem is that downloading the netinst image for testing is
painfully slow. There is a torrent, but no one is seeding it.
Apparently the way one gets Debian images is by jigdo. Unfortunately, I
am finding the instructions for jigdo to be rather cryptic. 

I have the .jigdo and .template files. I put them in a folder ~/Debian.
I have installed jigdo-file. Here is as far as I can get:

jjj at Devil7:~$ cd Debian/
jjj at Devil7:~/Debian$ jigdo-lite

present in the new image, and you do not need to download them

(e.g. `/mnt/cdrom').
Alternatively, just press enter if you want to start downloading
the remaining files. <Here I just pressed Enter>

At this point I am stuck. Why would a Debian ISO be on Ubuntu mirrors?
I guess I need the full URL to the jigdo version of the netinst ISO,
but I don't know where that is.

Also, I assume the authors of jigdo are not residents of the US, since
they apparently are not aware of how non-PC the name sounds. But that
is a different matter.

I can't find a jigdo file for the net install image and I'm guessing it
might not exist since the image is so small comparatively speaking.

The URL is
http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/daily-builds/testing/arch-latest/ia64/jigdo-cd/debian-testing-ia64-netinst.jigdo

I tried it and it worked for me.  I found that the torrent fails at the 
tracker.  So I downloaded it directly, and am now seeding on a different 
(open) tracker.  The attached torrent points to my copy of the file.

I can bring a projector, but I'm far too busy to organize it.
The organizer needs to inform Roots that we are coming.

Is a computer I'm looking at to replace my PIII mail,
squid/dansguardian, network boot, X server.  It looks like I can 
add a few parts plus a hard drive and cdrom I have and put the 
system together for around $510.  I'm debating as to whether or not
to throw in the cheapest DVD writer.  I'm thinking the ATI card, 
the second cheapest, is the way to go, but I'm not sure.

Before I even seriously consider going this route, is this computer
going to be fast enough to run squid and cache a movie from Hulu?
I'm thinking of going with 4 gigabytes of ram, but I could consider
bumping that up to 8.  A sample show that it should handle is one 
of the Stargate Universe episodes.

Is there anything hotter than this at roughly the same price?  Another
consideration, for how long is this computer going to be fast enough 
to run squid before I seriously need to consider purchasing a
replacement?  Is 64 bit CentOS 5.x the way to go or should I consider
another version of Linux?

I filtered 35 clients on a 533MHz Celeron with 128MB of memory running 
OpenBSD. This machine also has Squid configured as a transparent proxy 
with caching disabled and runs DG on a 3Mbs DSL. A year ago I upgraded 
it to a 1GHz PIII and added another 128M of memory, but only because I 
had it laying around. Top and other resource monitoring done before and 
after didn't show the machine overloaded. My home network is behind an 
identical machine, but still uses the 533MHz Celeron. Hulu works fine too.

If you're set on buying new:

That thing rocks. Add hard drive and ram and your set. I went the SSD 
route and bought the 2.5" adapter.

Subject: [PLUG] Font collections for cross-platform compatibility?
Message-ID: <4AFA1EBC.9060507@zenlinux.com>

I imagine many of you who run Linux desktops are frustrated by the font 
situation, and find editing MS Office documents back and forth between 
OpenOffice under Linux and MS Office under Windows to be a pain at least 
in part due to the differences in font availability.

Searching for font collections on Google returns a dizzying number of 
results. I was wondering if anyone can suggest a font collection I can 
obtain for free or purchase for a fee that would provide my Linux 
desktop a highly compatible set of fonts with what is typically found on 
modern Windows or even OS X systems?

If buying the exact same fonts separately would be prohibitively 
expensive (which I'm guessing is likely), I'd be willing to settle for a 
collection of near-identical fonts that are named in an obvious enough 
way that I would which fonts to substitute for their Windows alternatives.

Thanks,

Scott

I'm no fonts expert, but I've dealt with this issue a number of times.
First off, do you have the "mscorefonts" package installed?  For a
while M$ was distributing many of their fonts under a free-as-in-beer
license.  From what I understand, this has ceased, but you can still
obtain a copy from various sources.

Under debian non-free, there's a package called
"ttf-mscorefonts-installer" which downloads those fonts at install
time.  Hopefully this will help you with several of your font issues.

A second thing you can do for more recent M$ fonts is copy the fonts
out of one of your Windows installs (if you have one) and set them up
under xfstt or something similar.  So long as you own the Windows
installation, then this almost certainly falls under fair use.

good luck,
tim

I'll try and dig up the source, if you're using a non Debian distro, there
exists a shell script that will grab all the fonts and install them for you
automagically which I have used with great success on Slackware.

Thanks for the replies. This is exactly what I need. In fact I 
remembered installing that package a few Ubuntu releases ago, but had 
forgotten about it.

Also consider that next week is the Supercomputing Conference (sc09.supercomputing.org), I don't know how many PLUG AT types might be going but it is a BIG conference.  Exhibits only registration is $100 and well worth it (http://scyourway.supercomputing.org/exhibits/by_name).

I don't know whether anyone will actually set this up, but I vote
for Thursday.  Supercomputers 09 is at the convention center that 
week, and the IEEE is sponsoring some free evening presentations
on Tuesday and Wednesday.  See:

http://www.ieee-or.org/index.php?option=com_events&task=view_week&Itemid=56&year=2009&month=11&day=18

or  http://snurl.com/t6pci   or   snurl/t6pci

I may be ferrying the speakers from the Convention Center to the
Tek conference center on Tuesday, so I will be unavailable.  The
Wednesday evening presentation at OTBC looks interesting, too.

What are the difficulties of getting an ide drive in a usb enclosure
to boot?  It will be running Windows ME (gag).  Do I have to look for
anything special when shopping for the enclosure?  (I have the drive.)

This is my present idea of how to use my HP S20 scanner.  It ran fine
when I dual-booted to Windows ME, but switching to VirtualBox (Ubuntu
host) and Win 2k stopped that.

Thanks,

Nothing special needed AFAIK, as long as the BIOS supports booting from
external sources which covers just about any hardware still in use.

Denis,

   The HP Photosmart S20 is not supported by SANE as of 2008-01-18.

   Candidly, you'd be much better off (and spend less time and money) by
replacing that with a scanner known to work with Xsane. Check
http://www.sane-project.org/ for supported scanners; there are dozens of
them.

A couple of years ago, some IDE to USB interface chips would not work
with Linux, only Windows.  Usually, these chipsets violated the USB
standard and counted on a Windows driver to work around that. 
Available chipsets have changed, kernels have improved, so I don't
know how things are now.  Test things first if you can.

After that, booting from USB must be enabled by the laptop or
motherboard BIOS, and the USB interface will need to follow
standards for the BIOS USB to work.  USB boot can be a little
tricky - often you have to go into the BIOS each time you want
to boot from USB.  That said, I have booted from both USB hard
drives and flash drives with newer motherboards.

If you want to use a large SATA drive, then the Vantec Nextar
"drive toaster" is an interesting way to go.  Some other brands
will not handle a >500GB drive.

Actually it will be Thursday.  (As was announced at the last PLUG meeting.)

I need to get an announcement out as soon as I have the speaker info

[disclaimer: Your mileage may vary and this may be irrelevant to the 
discussion, but ...]
Under Mandriva, there is an option to install the HP Device Manager 
which has the capability of scanning, camera card reading, and faxing, 
along with the usual printing (for appropriate HP devices, of course).  
Maybe this is available in other distros as well?
Hope this helps

I am aware that SANE does not support the S20.  AFAIK it is only

discard a good piece of equipment.

Thanks.  I will look into it, although the age of this scanner makes
me not too optimistic.

Interesting thought.  You know I have a Vantec Nexstar, used for my
backups.  I suppose I could get another SATA and use it for this
purpose.  No need for a huge drive.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0911111327340.26901@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I found an old patch file for mdbtools-0.5, but it calls source from a
no-longer-existing cvs repository. I guess that my two options are to change
that line to the local source directory or apply the patches manually.

   The latter will not take long, but I'm having difficulty interpreting the
.diff file contents. For example, the first patch is for mdbsql.h:

RCS file: /cvsroot/mdbtools/mdbtools/include/mdbsql.h,v
retrieving revision 1.4
diff -r1.4 mdbsql.h
16a17
> 	int max_rows;
42c43

< 
---
> int mdbsql_run_query(MdbSQL *sql, char *mybuf);
> void mdb_sql_set_maxrow(MdbSQL *sql,int aMaxrow);

   I read the first change as adding at line 16 (making it then line 17), int
max_rows. Then change line 42 (now 43) by removing char *g_input_ptr and
adding extern char *g_input_ptr. Finally, row 61 is removed and the
following two lines added. Is this correct?

TIA,

Joe,

   But, wouldn't patch look for the code in cvsroot rather than the top
directory of the local source tree?

no, patch is pretty smart about that.  it automatically strips path names, 
you have to tell it not to do that if you need it to look into 
subdirectories.

I know ME supports USB natively, but I'm wondering how USB will work 
with it being the system drive during install. People weren't exactly 
doing this back then, and WinME doesn't have native support for USB 2.0. 
XP doesn't install on a USB drive the same way it does IDE either, there 
are hoops with driver integration. Me thinks you're better off getting a 
new scanner. Otherwise I think you're in for a lesson in frustration, 
and you'll be out $30 for the USB chassis that didn't work out.

Just because the BIOS has the option, doesn't mean the OS knows what to 
do with it.

Do you happen to have OO installed?  Because the doc looks perfectly fine

i tried on a oo 3.1 copy on my centos box and everything looked ok except 
for the tall brackets in the embedded objects.  possibly a font thing, but 
since they were embedded objects, i couldn't figure out how to easily look 
deeper into them.

I am getting frustrated by this effort.  The SANE site lists 248
scanners with a "complete" rating.  Of those I count 97 as USB.  Of
those, I started searching for Epson, which had 20 meeting the
criterion.  NONE of those are film scanners on the Epson site.

I tried HP; got similar results. Fujitsu, Genius, Avision the same.
What am I missing?  Either the model numbers have changed or SANE is
out of date. (I did find a site that said "Since Microtek, Polaroid,
Minolta and now Nikon discontinued their film scanners, there is not a
lot of choice left in affordable, good quality 35mm scanners."

Can anybody recommend a film scanner using USB with a "complete" SANE rating?

I got an EPSON Perfection V700 Photo about a year ago.  I don't know
what SANE rates it as, but using SANE it works great for me.  I've
scanned prints and slides and other stuff as well.

Just upgraded my Crackberry Storm to the v5 software.  
Now when I plug it into my system it auto-shows up as a USB drive. 

This makes interoperating with the BB much easier as backups, etc are now file copies.

If you've done the upgrade and don't have the same experience, on your BB go into:

Options -> Memory 
   and Enable 
Mass Store Mode Support
Auto Enable Mass Storage Mode When Connected.

Sorry I've been quiet.

I just today had someone from LINBIT push back to December. They are
preparing to give a hands-on talk on DRDB.

I am waiting for a final confirmation on a high-performance compiler BOF
with PathScale for Tuesday the 17th at 7PM, near Jax.

Alan, if you have someone lined up for Thrusday, go for it. I can
confirm if this same venue is available if you like.

Otherwise, I hope to have confirmation tomorrow, unless Tuesday is not
convenient for people.

Also, Linux Fund still has some exhibit passes to give away! Mail your
name and company name to passes at linuxfund.org to request one. First
come, first serve!

Michael

Thanks Russell.  SANE gives it a "GOOD" rating.  I guess I had better
expand my search to include "GOOD".  $600 seems a bit high, but it
does sound like a great machine.

I think I paid something like $540 for it a year ago.  Something
closer to $500 than $600, anyway.  And that generated an *ouch*
response from me as well, but having endured the pain and then
forgotten about it (like, apparently, child-birth or something), I'm
happy _now_.

I typically open Gimp, then open the scanner from Gimp, the scans go
straight to Gimp, I can clean up the edges, adjust colors, etc, and
save from there.

In looking at the specs and the reviews, it seems like a good choice
if you get a good unit--a number of people complained about having to
return their first one (from NewEgg).  No other current Epson scanners
capable of slides are listed in SANE.  They seem to take some time to
catch up with the manufacturers.

Have you ever tried scanning a bunch of slides at once--does GIMP get
each slide separately, or do you need to split them up manually?

I actually scan them individually at really high resolution, that is i
drag the framing box around each slide image and scan them one at a
time.  The slide holder does 12 at a time, but not very densely.  I
think I tried scanning a strip of them at once, but then went back to
doing them individually.  It isn't a high-speed operation,
unfortunately, but the results are decent.  I haven't really done much
research on whether/how to make it go faster.

Hi:

Does anyone has any experience running Linux on the new Dell Zino line of
PCs?
I want to use it as a media center kind of box.  It seems low
cost and even has an HDMI out.

Would anyone be interested in working out a deal with me to
allow me to login to a big endian computer and build/run some
tests?   My offer will consist of giving you an investment in

Wow, those look pretty cool!
The hardware looks pretty standard, the HDMI out might be a bit of trouble
to get working but should be do-able.  Dell says they offer Ubuntu Linux
9.04 as an OS option, so you just might be in luck.

Where does it say that? I didn't see it anywhere, all I saw was under
the "customize" button. The only options I saw was various versions of
windows.

On the tech spec, it does say Ubuntu 9.04.

What would the HDMI port be tough to configure under Linux?
Is the ATI Mobility graphics card a good one?  I have mostly Nvidia ones at
home.

Hmmmm nice looking little machine.
Where have I seen something like this before?  hmmmm?

http://www.apple.com/macmini/

:P

As far as tech specs the Dell is AMD / ATI, and Apple is of course Intel /
Nvidia.

BTW, as for the Ubuntu support on the Dell, if you click on the Tech Specs
tab on the Dell page, it shows Ubuntu Linux right in there among that
"other" OS.

Also, don't many Dells come in retail stores now?  Maybe see if this one
shows up at your favorite neighborhood $BIGBOX store and bring a Live Linux
CD and take it for a spin.

Yes, Dell lists Ubuntu 9.04 on the Tech Specs page, but it's not an
option when you want to customize.

Or is it and I missed it?

Is the ARM a big endian processor?

There are embedded ARM boards for $150 that come with Linux distros. 
You'd have to check if the tools come with.  You'd have a pretty bare
bones machine, but you could ssh into it and do all the command line
stuff, at your desktop.

Out of curiosity I did the online chat with them. I was told that they
aren't shipping it with Ubuntu on it yet, but that they had all the
drivers available. I was told that there wasn't a set price for a
discount for not purchasing Windows, but that it should be around $30.

So it sounds like maybe they'll ship it with Linux at some point.
(Possibly a large maybe, depending on the interest level.) That seems
like an awfully good deal, especially with the Linux discount. When
I'm next needing to get a new desktop system I'm going to look real
hard at getting one of those!

Thanks for the heads up!

If the device has the Intel Pousbou chipset in it, then you have to deal
with some proprietary drivers. Ubuntu has support for it. Moblin does as
well. Not much else has it at this point.

You could also buy an older PPC Mac in that price range. Most of them

   Ah! I never had/used a Mac, but I recall seeing ads for Yellowdog running
on the Motorola CPUs. In a way it's too bad that Motorola lost the CPU war
to Intel; I recall reading in the 1980s about the superiority of the
former's chips.

My first concern would be the state of driver support for video 
features.  It seems to be taking forever for ATI and Intel to get this 
stuff nailed down.

I'm considering a motherboard with an Nvidia ION chipset for a MythTV 
front end client.
http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=nvidia_ion_linux&num=1

These boards use an Atom processor, but with all the heavy lifting 
offloaded to the Nvidia graphics processor, they have no problem 
handling HD video.  The one downfall that is frequently mentioned is 
flash.  Since there currently is no way to offload flash video to the 
graphics processor, the Atom has to do the rendering.  As you can 
imagine, this does not work very well for anything high-res.

Both Zotac and Asrock make suitable ION motherboards.  Here's one that 
looks promising for my purposes:
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813500027&cm_re=zotac_ion-_-13-500-027-_-Product

I can't believe I'm suggesting something that requires a proprietary 
driver, but unfortunately the Nvidia ION is currently the best fit for 
what I want to do.

Yeah, I've found a G4 for $40 that has OS 9.2.2 on it.  Maybe that
is what I should do.  My rent is flat rate at the office so using more
electricity seems like it is no big deal -- I won't be asked to pay
any more if I use more electricity.  But it seems to me that it
would be better to find someone who already has a system that
they have on line on a semi regular basis and ask them for some
help.  The office is already crowded so it would also be nice to not
have to add another machine.

Brian,
I seem to recall IBM renting out compute time on various platforms. I just
tried to Google it and some of the info comes from 2003 so I am not sure if
it's still being offered but might be an avenue to explore.

if you use the apache addhandler command for things like php, perl, python, etc 
it can create a huge hole if you allow uploads into your web space (images for 
example).  the unbelievable behavior is that addhandler (and other friends from 
mod_mime) look for the extension anywhere in the filename, not just the end. 
so foo.php.jpg will be run as php if addhandler is used for .php (which is the 
default for redhat 5 systems).

a workaround is to use:

<FilesMatch \.php$>
 	SetHandler php5-script
 	ForceType text/html
</FilesMatch>

instead.  wow, this is just scary...

Along the same line, we need to prototype something that's capable of 
playing streaming video from up to four IP cameras in a Firefox browser 
window, using the downloadable java players that each cam manufacturer 
provides to support playback of mjpeg or mpeg4 video streams. In the example 
of your proposed hardware, would these players typically be able to use the 
Nvidia chipset or would they have to use the Atom processor, or is there any 
way to know without trying it?

Thanks,

Tom S.

Subject: [PLUG] Network failure
Message-ID: <f72d4c6a0911141113r79107ba1xbc3e4a6629a316ec@mail.gmail.com>

Trying to understand what happened to my network on Sep 21, 2009, and
actions to take if it happens again.

Background: Running Ubuntu 9.04 with NetworkManager
(http://projects.gnome.org/NetworkManager/)
DSL modem.  No wireless.

On 9/21/09 all network communication failed.  I power cycled the modem
to no effect.  My son changed /etc/network/interfaces from:
auto lo

iface lo inet loopback


to:
auto lo

iface lo inet loopback



auto eth0

iface eth0 inet dhcp


After restarting the network was restored, but the NetworkManager
applet which displays the network status on the task bar shows the
network as not functional.

Since this occurrence I have had two more times that the network
failed.  In both cases after shutting down for an hour or so then
restarting the network came back up functional.  During one of these
most recent failures, I looked at a GUI which displays, among other
things, Netstat outputs.

 When it had failed:



  Destination Gateway        Netmask      Interface

  169.254.0.0 0.0.0.0           255.255.0.0 eth0

  0.0.0.0             0.0.0.0        0.0.0.0         eth0

  fe80::                  ::                64        eth0

  ...snip...

When it was functional:



  Destination Gateway  Netmask         Interface

  192.168.0.0 0.0.0.0          255.255.255.0   eth0

  169.254.0.0 0.0.0.0          255.255.0.0     eth0

  0.0.0.0           192.168.0.1   0.0.0.0         eth0

  fe80::                   ::                64            eth0

  ...snip...


The spontaneous fixes since the first occurrence leads me to consider
the possibility that Evan's edit of /etc/network/interfaces did not
fix the issue, but only served to break the NetworkManager applet.

I am interested in having a bag of diagnostic tricks at the ready when
it happens again.  High on my list of suspects is the DSL modem.  I am
also interested in restoring the NetworkManager applet to function.

Suggestions?

-Denis

Denis,
What kind of DSL modem is it, who's your ISP?

Message-ID: <4CBEA2E7-DFDD-4105-95A9-373A4549B97D@ridenbaugh.com>

I do a fair amount of political voter precinct analysis, and a way of  
easily mapping the results would be very helpful. So I was interested  
in a piece in the Boise Weekly (the Idaho alternative paper) wherein  
one of the reporters, Nathaniel Hoffman, tried to develop an approach  
for doing that, using mostly (though not entirely) open source  
options, including OpenOffice Calc and Qgis (I believe it's open  
source).

The process he used was pretty involved and time-consuming, though,  
and used a bunch of conversions - it's certainly not simple. He  
writes about it at http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/mapping-city- 
council-races/Content?oid=1297504

Question - might there be some better way to automate this? If there  
is, a lot of people in the political world would be extremely  
interested.

   Wander over to http://grass.osgeo.org/ and grab a copy of grass-6.4RC5;
actually, get the latest from the svn server or yesterday's weekly snapshot.

   You can get map data from the Oregon Geospatial Enterprise Office (OR GEO)
at http://www.oregon.gov/DAS/EISPD/GEO/sdlibrary.shtml. You can find
congressional districts, county boundaries, cities, census data, etc.

   You can even color the resulting maps red and blue!

RFC 3330 begs to differ.

http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3330.html

169.254.0.0/16 - This is the "link local" block.  It is allocated for
communication between hosts on a single link.  Hosts obtain these
addresses by auto-configuration, such as when a DHCP server may not
be found.

Actually it is but not for getting out to the Internet.  It is the
zero-conf networking address.
It is valid for local area networks but is (should be) dropped at the router.

Yup.

Is this realization triggered by the recent Wordpress issue?

The whole concept of placing executable text files in a web root and
then allowing one to mix them with non-executable content (HTML,
images, css, etc) is a pretty insane.  Yes, I know, everyone does it
on nearly every platform, but that doesn't make it good.  Anytime you
take static content and mix it with executable content, and then
intentionally blur the line between the two, it's a recipe for
disaster.  (Examples: MS office macro viruses, PDF+JavaScript,
HTML+JavaScript, Flash+JavaScript, ...)

Never trust your distro's defaults for Apache httpd.  They're almost
always not right for you, and many distros continue to enable entirely
too many "features" that no one ever uses.


If you're writing an app for file uploads here are some approaches to
keep it safe (in order of preference):

A. Don't allow file uploads.  Find a way around it.

B. Allow file uploads, but don't store files on disk.  Instead,
   capture the uploaded file name an contents and store them in
   database records.

C. Store the file on disk, but *do not* use the provided file name to
   store it.  Instead, store a record in the database which includes
   the name of the file provided by the user, a unique identifier for
   the file, and any other attributes you care to.  Ensure that you:

    1. Do not store the contents of the file under the web root at
       all.  Use a separate script to download the file based on the
       unique identifier.

    2. Use a file name based on the unique identifier that your code
       generated during the upload.

In cases B and C, watch out for SQL injection, cross-site scripting,
and HTTP header injection.  Oh, not to mention, are users uploading
files that contain viruses or trojans?  Are you becoming an accomplice
to attacks from one user to another?  (Option A becomes more appealing
now.)


On the topic of badly designed PHP apps that allow file uploads, if
any of you host osCommerce installations or apps derived from hit, you
definitely want to take a look at this thread:
  http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2009/Nov/169


Ok, I've rambled long enough.

No experience with USB modem, but with modems in general ... you say 
"problems connecting every now and again"?
    Do you get any error message(s)?
    Can you hear the process (dial tone, dialing, ring, connect chat)?
These things could provide a clue.  I have had modems physically fail, 
but rarely - if you don't fry it, or drown it, or take a hammer to it, 
there really isn't much in them to go wrong.
Other than a faulty telco line, the usual suspects are physical 
connections (as in: remove and reseat - and you might include: inspect 
for signs of wear, breakage, corrosion, or misalignment).
Also, if you need it, one can initialize a call from the command line 
and view the chat on screen (redirecting to a file is also possible, of 
course).
Hope this helps
Regards
Fred James

Hmm. There might be some system logs on the Actiontec to help determine if
it is indeed the modem failing, it sounds like it's either PPPoE/A or routed
with the 192.x.x.x addresses. If you need a modem to test with, I have an
Actiontec that is known to be good and you can swap it in and see what
happens. The 1524 is the little gray one right? Are you running a switch or
using the built in ethernet?

Indeed, there is a Clinic tomorrow.

I regret the failure to announce earlier. My excuse is that I have been
swamped with a construction project. But I will be there.

yes, the wordpress alert was what triggered me to look at things more 
closely.  allowing someone to upload a jpg/gif/etc into a web space is a 
pretty standard thing.  and i doubt that most programmers would think that 
foo.php.jpg would be run by the php system.  the methods you list are 
certainly other ways around the issue.  but that isn't going to fix all 
the apps that are out there already.  from what i can tell, using the 
filematch apache method will deal with all of them.  there is a similar 
issue with addhandler being used for .cgi files, but that requires extra 
file permissions as well as other apache setup, so that is far less likely 
to be a problem for foo.cgi.jpg files.

"The Little Grey One" sounds like an accurate description.  I do not
have a switch.  This unit is rented from Qwest, so it has some
"special" firmware.  (There were cautions not to upgrade the firmware,
as it would then no longer work with Qwest.)  Whether this is just
hype to get dummies like me to continue renting, I do not know.  The
upside is that if it is the modem, I can get a replacement easily.

Thanks for the offer of the substitute, but since the failures are
random and rare, and the modem may be configured specifically for
Qwest, it might be hard to sort things out.

I will see if there are any logs in the modem I can peruse.

Thanks for the ideas.

I think the don't upgrade is just a "we don't want you to brick it"
precaution. The one that I have will work with Qwest as I have Qwest as well
for the copper portion of the DSL.

I got a Coolscan III (SCSI) off eBay about ten years ago and loved it.
The dust removal stuff worked like magic. That was all using the
proprietary Nikon software on Windows though; looks like SANE doesn't
support that though:

Bummer, dude.

Hamrick's VueScan supports that on Linux, if you don't mind the non-free thing.

   Wander over to http://grass.osgeo.org/ and grab a copy of grass-6.4RC5;
actually, get the latest from the svn server or yesterday's weekly snapshot.

   You can get map data from the Oregon Geospatial Enterprise Office (OR GEO)
at http://www.oregon.gov/DAS/EISPD/GEO/sdlibrary.shtml. You can find
congressional districts, county boundaries, cities, census data, etc.

   You can even color the resulting maps red and blue!

   Thanks to the linguistic skills of J**3 in translating the pictograms to
English I quickly got the networking running on the new Toshiba Satellite,
upgraded the repositories, installed a couple of packages, and went home
happy.

   The laptop connects to the wireless access point here (now that I know
where the initiator hides), has upgraded a bunch of already-installed
packages, and I've added some that she needs (e.g., jpilot, acroread). Video
and sound work (once aumix is turned on). So, my wife will be happy with her
new box and I can once again not have to keep fixing things. At least for a
short time.

   Thanks to John, Wes, and Keith it all came together in an hour there.

Much grasses,

Rich

   I use this small wireless access point and it tends to quit functioning on
a too frequent basis. Suddenly there's no network connection from the one
portable that accesses the LAN and 'Net wirelessly and we need to unplug the
Linksys and plug it back in. This power cycling resets it and it begins
working again.

   Is this to be expected with this compact unit? Should I consider getting
something different for that one host's connection? It's more an annoyance
than a critical flaw, but it would be nice to have the AP not hang.

just in case you haven't done this, make sure that the firmware is

I had similar trouble with my WRT54G v1 running DD_WRT.  I was also having
other problems with my Verizon DSL, usually DNS would quit.  I often had to
power cycle the Westel 7500 DSL modem to the internet back again.  Finally I
got Verizon to come out, they hooked me up to a higher power line at the
office, changed by outside connection box, and reran the modem line.  The
Verizon tech said that slow deterioration is the symptom of a line being
driven beyond its capacity.  Now everything is solid, and my connection is
closer to what was advertised.  I haven't had to power cycle either one
since Verizon came out.

I had my WRT54G quit a few times as well. It would be on and look ok but not
respond to ping or anything. I moved it over to DD WRT and so far so good.
Hopefully the firmware upgrade does a router good.

Patrick,

   Years ago I had issues with Verizon and the Fujitsu DSL bridge. That was
resolved a long time ago. Now it's just the WRT54GC. I'll upgrade firmware
and see if that makes a difference.

   We all do better when we upgrade our firmware. Especially as we get older.

A friend of mine, Ira Erbs teaches at N. Clackamas school district.

He needs help persuading his principle not to cut his Linux class next

If anyone can send her a letter explaining why continuing the Linux class is

The more people write, the better chance to save the class.

My principal wants to kill off my linux classes next year. I am asking you
as a member of my advisory to email her to reconsider her decision
Cinda Morrison. Morrisonc at nclack.k12.or.us
Please get folks from plug to email her too. She needs to understand how
important these classes are

Older Linksys transformer-based wallwart AC adapters are crap. 
A full power interruption generates a reset and a clean restart. 
A brownout, perhaps caused by a furnace blower motor kicking
in, causes the voltage level to sag, which can cause the
Linksys processor to lose state and go zombie.  There is no
watchdog circuit to detect that.

This happens more often if the barrel connector from the wall
wart to the access point is mildly corroded.  If you clean it,
there is a small chance the failure rate will diminish (but
not go away).  Maybe not, the plating is not thick on those,
and scrubbing off the plating makes things worse.

Your best bet is to find a used laptop AC adapter that produces
the same DC voltage.  Or use a laptop "external battery".
See http://www.keithl.com/Linksyspower.html

Newer Linksys units with electronic "switcher" AC adapters?  There
should be fewer problems if the adapters have a large energy storage
capacitor, but I wouldn't bet on it.  A laptop adapter which provides
lots of power will have a large capacitor and can power the Linksys
for a second or so, long enough to survive a motor startup.

A double-conversion "online" battery backup is also good.  This
is the kind that uses wall power to charge the battery, and uses
battery voltage to synthesize uninterruptable power.  The "offline"
or "bypass" backups just pass along the voltage sag, and only kick
in after power stops for a sizable fraction of a second.  Online
UPS units are more expensive and less efficient, so the typical
retail UPS is offline, and won't help your Linksys.

BTW, it is possible to "brick" your Linksys if a brownout occurs
during programming, so there is a risk to updating the firmware
without a trustworthy power supply.

This is hard to understand... This is a copper line....

The insulation could fail...  The connections could fail...


When you run 20 Amps through a 15 Amp connection..  Now the copper
fails..Burns insulation and pops the circuit breaker.. Or melts/welds
the copper if you can pull enough amperage...


Just random thoughts..

Another possible failure mode is memory leaks.  I'm currently
debugging a problem I'm seeing on my build of OpenWrt, not sure where
the problem is (I'm investigating now) but I'm seeing a drop in
free+buffers+cache on the order of 2meg/day (user space doesn't seem
to be changing enough to account for that).  Your firmware will be
different, uses different hardware/drivers, etc, but it could have a
similar problem.  A powercycle would garbage collect any leaked memory.

I'm talking about the analog phone line into the house.  The slow
deterioration is of the quality of the DSL connection (perhaps measured in
effective data rate).   Nothing to do with power lines, circuit breakers or
any of that stuff; sorry for the confusion.

[We're back! Sorry for the downtime. Personal issues ate my brain.]

We have a new location, a new night, and an old time.

Michael Dexter <dexter at linuxfund.org> is helping me keep things organized
and helping with planing.  He will help getting speakers and the like.

PLUG Advanced Topics
November 19th 2009
7pm - 9pm

Location: Club 915
          915 SW 2nd
          Portland, OR

Club 915 is a block south and across the street from where Jax used to be.
Big stone building. Can't miss it.

Topic:  Backporting Linux kernel Drivers with Git
Speaker:  Alan Olsen <alan.r.olsen at intel.com>
          Intel Corp.

Description:
The talk will be a demonstration on how to use git to assist in
back-porting drivers from one kernel version to another.  It will include
merging patches, determining what patches are part of the driver you are
backporting, generating patches, etc. I will also have a quick intro to
some of the git concepts I will be using.

Note: This is a new venue.  It is closer to the Max Line than Roots. It
also has more space.  We will see how it works out.

Message-ID: <1258446489.3744.15.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

going to be down on November 20?  Shouldn't PSU have a high 
availability set up?  OHSU for patient records uses a hidden 
off site data center that is secured.  Why doesn't PSU do this?

I suppose I and anyone else who is a PSU student got an announcement
that most services are going to be down after 7 pm on the 20th.

I don't have a backup site for my DSL hosted one, but I'm not a
University serving 1000s of people.  I'm starting to question the
competence of PSU's IT staff where being in computer science that
is of great concern to me.  There was a major outage not long ago.
PSU seems to be doing construction all over campus, aren't the 
network services being worked on too?  

If you are a PSU staff person, please don't be offended.  Some of 
you are very dedicated good professors.  Others, I honestly wonder 
what you are doing there.  I'm not going to list any names because 
that would be stupid and rude.

If you are a PSU student, you are sinking literally thousands of
dollars into an education that is likely going to be the foundation
of your future career.  Some of the information in those computer
systems is personal information.  I expect PSU to have an off site
secured data center and I expect use of a high availability server
configuration.  Servers should be on multiple electrical circuits
preferably in multiple buildings, all of them secured appropriately
depending on the level of data that they contain.  This is what I
expect.  Am I OTL?  What is the reality at PSU?

I'm increasingly wondering if I should take myself elsewhere for 
multiple reasons, the issue of PSU's network reliability being 
one of them.

I don't go to PSU but I wonder if it's a switch or router maintenance rather
than something like servers going down. I don't know they're architecture or
design so I can't posit a good answer. Maybe you could actually ask them
what exactly they are going to be working on. If they are doing electrical
work, even if they had diverse data centers the core on campus, if affected
wouldn't let you access the data in these facilities anyways.

i have nothing to do with psu, but have been part of a university 
computing staff.  i think you are overestimating the resources available 
to a university computing group.  ohsu is an unfair comparison because 
they are a hospital and therefore have some compliance requirements 
(hipaa) that allow them to invest in more sophisticated systems.

when i was involved (more than 20 years ago), it was considered completely 
normal to have the computer system down for the entire week between xmas 
and new years.  nowadays i'm sure that isn't common anymore, but a partial 
day outage seems pretty mild in comparison.

Michael,

I think you're confusing two concepts, namely DR and HA. Secondary data 
centers exist for Disaster Recovery, or Business Continuity, purposes. 
They have redundancy of the enterprise network, data, and application 
services. HA is simply duplicated services within the same network 
environment (dual routers, nics, Oracle RAC, dual application servers, 
etc.). Having worked in corporate enterprise environments for the last 
10 years, I can tell you most environments don't have DR and not all 
environments are highly available. It definitely depends on the 
criticality of those systems to the core business and the costs to the 
business of building and maintaining that infrastructure. I'd be 
surprised if PSU didn't have HA for it's core critical systems such as 
database services, financial applications, etc. For less critical 
systems (ie, publicly accessible network, library computers, essentially 
most of the systems that you as a 'user' use), IT managers will choose 
to inconvenience you with an outage window. The cost to support an HA 
environment for all users is prohibitive. DR for those systems is simply 
out of the question.

In the case of the network having no DR site, it's standard in most 
environments, if not all environments, to have outage windows for 
maintenance. Even the most Highly Available applications take outage 
windows for migrations, patches, etc. that are deemed critical to the 
infrastructure. If this is an annual event at PSU (I've never seen their 
network), they probably plan major upgrades or patching during this period.

It's also possible that with all the work, they are upgrading/improving 
the network infrastructure and they need to take the outage to bring the 
new systems on line.

hah, to say the least.  that was my past (and hopefully) future life
(at a different university), and though the CS department whom i
worked for kept downtime to a minimum (aside from a flood and a rat
literally bridging a 100kV circuit and blowing up the box that brought
the building electricity), we still had scheduled outages.  things
like migrating home directories to a new fileserver requires some time
when 1000 users aren't logged in and modifying files.  similarly
infrastructure work (electricity, plumbing--how do you think the
machine room cooler works?  & what happens when it needs maintenance?)

agreed.  i mean, our e-commerce sites have less downtime, but they
also have way fewer moving parts than a 25k+ user network, and only 3
actual users.

Subject: [PLUG] WINE verses ReactOS...
Message-ID: <1258487652.3846.15.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

Which ultimately is the better approach to producing a free way 
to use that can't live without it Windows program?

ReactOS right now is at least 2 months behind optimal schedule for
0.3.11 with 0.5.0 who knows how far away.  Asking about ReactOS
0.3.11 on the forum boards, I'm not the only one who has, is
problematic.  The themes: the developers are few, they
don't have much time to work on ReactOS, and writing a Windows
compatible OS is hard seem to repeat over and over again.  I
wonder if it is indeed too hard to write a Windows NT 
compatible OS?  Is 5 years a reasonable length of time to
wait for a stable release of ReactOS?  Will ReactOS support
more Windows software and Windows drivers than Linux+WINE?

I've tried to argue that it would be easier to work on Linux
than ReactOS, but that gets shot down a lot on the forums.  
The latest complaint is that NetZero dial-up doesn't work 
well with Linux and there was a vague complaint about 
winmodems not working in Linux.  I used wvdial to connect a 
Linux network to dial-up once upon a time, worked flawlessly.

ReactOS is not Windows, but the people who argue in favor of it
act like it is.  I'm sure that a lot of Windows software won't
work in ReactOS 2-3 years from now.

On the subject of Windows alternatives, is anyone interested in
helping the opentaxsolver project support Oregon taxes?
http://opentaxsolver.sourceforge.net/
It would be nice if there was an alternative to H&R Block TaxCut
and Intuit's TurboTax that is Linux compatible.  I asked about
Oregon and they asked me to do the state.  I don't think I can
figure out Oregon taxes for the project.

   There's a version of Slackware for the S390. I wonder how many
installations are running that. Last I read about it someone was running
about 80 virtual linux machines on a S390. I'm sure the case is larger than
my house.

Not every month though.  

Actually getting in to Ignite Portland is sometimes a challenge.  Back
for Ignite Portland 5 (when I did my presentation), their 650 tickets
"sold out" (they are free, so "sold" is a little misnomerish) in about
15 minutes.  I guess now you just line up.  Not that it isn't fun.

Also, if you skip IP7 in-person (not that you should), it *is* video'd
and will be available on youtube or something like it, so you don't
have to miss out entirely.

Another IP7 talk is by past-president of PTP Michael Weinberg on the
Turkey Tracker project, which is kind of cool.  Sensor-geek, meets
intartube fun, meets Oregon Food Bank fundraiser:

Power & Money.

The Engineering Building and the Data Center there is fairly new. We
have found that there are problems with how the fire-suppression system
was integrated with the building's Power which can result in the
emergency power-off shutting off the Power at a point between the UPSes
and servers.

As for a multi-site high-availability setup, that's where the Money
comes in. There is also Time, but in this case, Money could buy Time.

There is a fourth: Need. Patient records and student/staff/faculty
records are very different--medical emergencies can happen at any time
and patient records are critical. Not being able to get to Banner or
your e-mail or the PSU web site during a planned and advertised outage
is an inconvenience, not an emergency.

No offense, but you're a shithead. Do you see how that doesn't work? You
can't be a dick and then say "please don't be offended".

You also don't seem to know the difference between "faculty" and "staff".

It is interesting that only 107 out of the 446 Linux machines
identify by distro - and that Scientific Linux, the distro 
customized from RHEL by Fermilabs for supercomputer clusters,
is not even listed.  

I suspect Scientific Linux runs on many, perhaps most of the
remaining 300+ supercomputers.  Perhaps they will include that
on the questionnaire next year.  I will be back at the show on
Thursday and ask.

BTW, SC09 is jawdropping awesome.  Thanks to Michael Dexter
and the Linux Fund folks for the exhibitor guest badges.  The
show fills the entire A-B-C-D-E exhibit area at the convention
center, as well as some of the hallway, and is using the entire
space.  It is not as big as the Design Automation Conference in
Anaheim, and I imagine Consumer Electronics Show and the like
are much bigger, but I have never seen so much big iron compute
hardware in one place.   I was on the floor for 6 hours today,
and saw half of it.  20 pounds of papers and tchotchkes so far.

My favorite so far is a little round cardboard fan from JAXA,
the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, with "Let's enjoy the
sky" on one side, and "How useful satellite is" on the other.
They are doing some good work on launch vibration modelling
that I hope to use for server sky.

The Oregonian incorrectly stated that they have 400gbps to the
convention center;  it looks more like 40 Gpbs, with about 400
oversubscribed 1 Gbps pipes to the various exhibits.   There 
was about 30 racks of fiber distribution equipment scattered
around the floor.  NTT was running an uncompressed HDTV video
link of the morning commute in Osaka, 50msec speed-of-light
delay.  The wireless still sucked, though;  couldn't get DHCP.
At the convention center, some things never change.

I'm not using foul crude language, yet I'm the one with the problem?

Faculty and staff, the former is a subset of the latter.  Sure I am
talking about IT people in particular.  The fire suppression system
shouldn't be improperly designed, not with the money the University 
is literally throwing at buildings.  I simply do not understand how 
a UPS can be behind the power source for a server instead of in front 
of it where it belongs.  That is very strange.  I can understand loss 
of power due to a rodent building a nest in the breaker box, but the
servers should at least be able to shut down properly.  Improper 
design suggests that there is a competence issue and the people who 
are affected are students paying frankly a lot of money to be 
students in the first place.

As far as the shithead comment, I didn't list any names and frankly
it is likely that most higher education institutions have problematic
professors and other problematic staff.  Computer science at PSU 
seems to be going through a period of change, not all of it good.  
I have run into more CS profs with nasty attitudes than profs from 
other disciplines.  Granted, my view being a CS major on other
disciplines is fairly limited.

Frankly, I didn't target all PSU staff or all PSU professors with
my original post and I purposely left the specfics out on who I
think has a problem.  How is that being a shithead?

I had terrible luck with CS311 this term.  I feel it is being very
poorly taught.  I'm hoping the other instructor who isn't teaching 
it this term doesn't believe in giving homework that the students 
can't solve and learn from.  I saw the instructor, I won't name him, 
get visibly angry with students on multiple occasions which is
unacceptable.  I don't care what the student is asking, suck it up 
and be professional.  Seriously.  It is disturbing to watch adults 
have to put up with another adult's anger issues.  I fell behind and
there was nothing I could do, so I got out of the class.  It is
frustrating in that I really want to move on.

Please keep name calling using crude foul language to yourself.

I think it's unfortunate that I need to ask, but what does this entire
thread have to do with linux or being a linux user?  As near as I can tell,
it is off-topic.  Please take topics like this elsewhere, such as PLUG-talk.

Thank you,

I've had to have this discussion with people who've never managed,
administered or troubleshot an enterprise network. This seems like this is
the case with you Michael. It is not a complete apples to apples comparison
but the ideas still work. Automobiles have been around for some 100 years,
there have been plenty of advancements and innovations, yet they still
require regular maintenance in order to run efficiently and not break down.
If you apply your logic to autos, they should never break down and never
require any upkeep whatsoever and they should never have any type of recalls
or something found after they are brought to market that was missed during
the engineering and prototyping phase. In reality, it just doesn't work like
that.

Maybe you have an axe to grind with some of the professors, so be it, but
that shouldn't become a blanket judgement about the intelligence of the IT
staff at PSU.

Subject: [PLUG] What permits apache to write files?
Message-ID: <20091118061044.GA25389@gate.kl-ic.com>

I probably have my apache server set up somewhat incorrectly for
one of my oldest websites.  I run a lot of wikis on many websites,
and the wikis permit apache cgi clients to rewrite apache owned
wiki content under some circumstances.

What is scary is that a couple of my static html files, allegedly 
unrelated to the wiki, were also rewritten by spammers, no doubt
via some of the older wikis (using Kwiki, rather than the newer
and more secure MoinMoin).  Those static files were incorrectly
owned by apache, but still ...

I just set all the static files to ownership root.  I will learn
more about tightening down the restrictions for Kwiki write access 
( and eventually migrate all the content to Moin ). 

But in the interim (without sharing my httpd.conf stuff with all
and sundry)  are there other ways (besides incorrectly configured
wikis) that apache can rewrite static content that incompetents
like myself should be aware of?

Are there any issues with setting static content to root ownership
( or perhaps to user "foo" ownership ), read only, as long as 
apache can still read it?

I never said that servers never break down.  Misdesign though 
which leads to an outage that leads to another service outage 
to fix the problem suggests a competence problem.  Automobiles 
don't break down as often as they did say 100 years ago.  The
reliability is much better.  A qualified electrician should be 
able to design the electrical system for a building so that 
servers can be set up properly.  Furthermore, when you are 
serving 1000s of people you need to think about or have 
secondary facilities.  With all the construction going on at 
PSU, there should be a secondary site for network services.  
As far as an ax to grind, if I were unprofessional and had an 
ax to grind I'd put their names in my posts.  Yes I have 
noticed that certain professors at PSU probably shouldn't 
be there.  Insofar as this affects the computer science program, 
it is indirectly a Linux issue.  Linux is an operating system 
that is maintained by people who understand computers.  If
PSU isn't turning out educated engineers, that is not good for 
Linux.  This problem with the design of the electrical system
should have been spotted and addressed a long time ago.

Concerning judgements, I have to make judgements because the
competence or lack thereof of the IT staff at PSU affects me.  
I am in a computer intensive major.  If I were an English 
major, maybe I would not care so much.

Why are all of PSU's network services including access to the 
Linux lab going to be affected?  Why is this outage going to
occur now instead of 4 months ago in the summer when most 
students were gone?  I have some real difficulty understanding
the planning.

Message-ID: <20091118065118.GA25445@gate.kl-ic.com>

Microsoft had the biggest booth at Supercomputers09, 50x90 feet.  The
huge exhibit floor (about 260,000 square feet ) was crowded, but not
around the M$ booth.   One reason was that they had some of their
boothbabes dressed like cops or Marine officers or some uniform like
that.  Maybe they were enforcers for the Business Software Alliance. 
I don't know, I saw the uniforms and gave the hellhole a wide berth.

Meanwhile, the crowds were 20 feet deep around the 30x40 Nvidia booth.
As you may know, the ultra-powerful GPU on most Nvidia graphics cards
can be reconfigured as a scientific array processor, and the CUDA
programming language is free-though-not-open, with lots of freeware
packages available, so there is a lot of interest in their hardware
and software.

Nvidia has a programming group in the area.  Perhaps I can talk one
of them into giving an Advanced Topics talk.  I will leave someone
else the pleasure of inviting M$ to give a Retarded Topics talk.

I'm not off topic and I am not particularly negative just because I
said that I don't understand the planning, which I don't.  How many 
CS majors is PSU turning out and of those how many would be able to 
do significant work on the Linux kernel or write Linux software, what
I want to do eventually?  

There is a lot of theoretical stuff that in my opinion is not being
taught well at PSU.  Not all of the professors are problematic, 
just some.  Specifically in the area of discrete math, the teaching
has a lot to be desired IMHO.

--- Now about the atheist comment, I'll take a shot at it ---


The real pessimist is the atheist for not believing that there 
is a benelovent God, creator of everything, who keeps it in 
existence.  The atheist has nothing to believe in, so I really
pity him/her.  Man's fallen nature doesn't generally lead him/her
to be happy.  The atheist cannot prove that God isn't the source
of human compassion and human love, but this is essentially what
an Atheist believes.

Without God, there aren't any human rights nor does Man have any
purpose whatsoever.  Man has no solid reason, being created by
God for example, to respect his body if he/she is an atheist.
I suppose if you don't respect your body there are consequences, 
but people still smoke various things, drink excessively, abuse 
stronger drugs, etcetera.  Man needs a strong reason to respect
himself and that reason is the existence of God.

Where does happiness come from Mr. Atheist?  You don't know because
you don't believe in a supreme being.  

Caffeine is a drug I'd prefer not to be addicted to, so I'll pass 
on drinking coffee thank you very much.

---- Now I'll go for a while on PSU ----

Unfortunately, poor teaching is a real barrier to success.  I also get
tired of the lack of values I see in people on campus which can become 
a distraction.  The willingness of some people to use pot for example 
as if it were just an herb when in fact it is a mind altering drug
really bugs me.  There's nothing like watching a man roll a marijuana
cigarette in class.

I question how solid the CS program is at PSU and I'd like to be 
around a different class of people where I thought I would be at 
the Junior/Senior level.  Instead, I see a lot of people abusing 
drugs including cigarettes and many of my colleagues are pessimistic.
PSU's smoking shelters actually encourage smoking, talk about 
increasing your carbon footprint and putting other pollutants 
in the air.

---- I'll talk a little about everything I've talked about now ----

It doesn't help that the plug-talk list, which seemingly could be 
an outlet, isn't because noone on it who comments shares my values.
Indeed, I may have harmed myself going after some of the issues I 
did on plug-talk and indeed it may come back to haunt me by causing
someone important to think I am confrontational.  

I'm thinking of Pascal right now who invented much of the science 
that people who are atheists say obviates the need for God.  Pascal
believed in God till the day he died despite his contribution to
science.  Some young man apparently tried to tell him during a 
train ride that scientific discoveries he had made obviated the 
need for God.

Pot abuse is becoming an epidemic and it is going to have to be
addressed at some point or there will be a lot of zoned out people.
I wish I wasn't around it.  I want to be around people who are 
clear and like minded who are also positive.  They are hard to find
though at PSU.

Portland State's computer science program needs to improve considerably.
The lack of help added to the difficulty level of the courses is a
systemic problem that needs addressing.  Sometimes, I think there is
a stronger focus on diversity and multiculturalism than there is on
people getting through their programs of study.  Why is Portland
State predominantly populated by foreigners?  Maybe it's just computer
science that is like this.  I'd like to see more Oregonians in my
classes and fewer Chinese, Japanese, etc.  No offense to foreigners, 
but I'm not from their neck of the woods.  How can I relate to them,
especially when they speak in a language I don't know?  Frankly, they
should be taken aside and politely told to speak English when they 
don't in my opinion.  If I were in their country, I'd have to speak 
the local language.  It is called basic respect for your host.  PSU
can be so alien, I often feel that I'm alone on campus.  Being alone
while pursuing a difficult major is not a good thing.

A more secure system.
You could set static content to be owned by keithl or any-uid-not-apache
with the same effect.  On my system I prefer to use michael.  Vanity...

without using selinux or chroot, you need to assume that anything that is 
world writable, apache group writable, or apache user writable can and 
will be written on by apache.  also, any directory that is writable means 
that any file inside it can be replaced as well.  apache won't go writing 
on things just for fun, but any cgi/php/etc that has as bug will

and given the lovely foo.php.jpg issue i posted about a few days ago, this

Subject: [PLUG] Linus Torvalds for Nobel Peace Prize
Message-ID: <20091118170806.GA28271@gate.kl-ic.com>

Since the Nobel Peace Prize is often given to politicians, some
disagree with the choices.  But it is often given to non-politicians
who create international efforts to change the world for the better.  

Look at the massive international efforts represented by SC09, and
realize that much of it started from the work of a 21yo Finnish
college student named after 1962 Nobel Peace Prize winner Linus
Pauling.  It would be fitting to honor that international effort
by giving a Peace Prize to Linus Torvalds, perhaps in 2011 on the
20th anniversary of the August 1991 Linux announcement, or in 2012
on the 50th anniversary of Pauling's award.

Linux is one of the largest cooperative international efforts ever
undertaken.  It inspired Ubuntu, One Laptop Per Child, and many
other global projects.  Linux conquered the supercomputer space,
the server space, the embedded computer space - by peaceful means! 
Linux helped sequence the human genome, helps protect the world
computer infrastructure from viral attack, and is now the pathway
for millions to learn computer programming and participate in new
international efforts.

The 2007 Nobel Peace Prize recipient (a politician some disagree
with, please disagree in a different thread, thanks) is giving
the keynote to SC09 as I write this.  Meaning that we are all
three handshakes away from the people that decide on future Peace
Prizes.  Perhaps it is time to launch some messages through our
connections and see what makes it to the committee meetings in Oslo.  

According to the list on Wikipedia, the five people to convince are
Thorbj?rn Jagland (chair), Kaci Kullmann Five (deputy chair), Sissel
R?nbeck, Inger-Marie Ytterhorn, and ?got Valle.  We can start by
sending them Norsk language Ubuntu disks.  

While I imagine Linus Torvalds would be embarrassed by the attention,
it would sure make his parents happy.  And it would mean one less 
Peace Prize for a politician.

I think you make an excellent case.  Tovalds or Mark Shuttleworth would 
make excellent choices for a Nobel laureate, IMO.  Their contributions 
to humanity will endure long after most of today's major crises and 
concerns have crumbled into dust.

Some features:
* rumbles to indicate how much time you have left for your presentation
* leds indicate how much time has passed/is left for your presentation

AFAIK, that's better than anything on the market for other OSes.

Oh, I'm sorry, if someone talks about God on the Linux list I'm not
allowed to respond here?  I did offset my comments so
people reading them could tell that it would be less Linux related
as they went down.  As far as I don't know what I'm talking about,
in what respect exactly?  Sure, get angry at the guy who tries to
respond but leave the guy who made the off topic comment in the
first place alone.

This is the Portland Linux Users group, not the Cincinnati or the
Louisiana or the Stockholm Linux users group for that matter.  Issues
that affect people who study computer science in Portland would seem
relevant now wouldn't they?

There is a fair amount of pessimism among my colleagues, specifically
I got to listen to a story of the professor from hell who didn't want
to teach anymore that wasn't available for questions.  I don't know
the professor myself, but I know of another one like I said that has
an anger problem.  Clearly, there are some faculty issues at PSU.  As
far as contacting the OMSBUDs office, are problems with 1 or 2 faculty
members really enough to go that far?  Who is going to listen to
complaints about the smoking shelters sending the wrong message to
people?  As far as mentioning that someone is rolling marijuana
cigarettes in class, I'm sure it's illegal, but again I'd have to
mention exactly who is doing it and there would have to be the will
to enforce the law.  I don't think there is.  The faculty problems
potentially lower the quality of CS courses at PSU and that in turn
affects the education of computer scientists which does not bode
well for this area.

I expected a higher class of people that leave drugs alone at the
Junior/Senior level at PSU.  Instead, I'm seeing just the opposite.
Where it was supposed to be easier at the higher level, I am
running into problematic faculty which is increasing the amount
of time it is going to take me to get through when I have to drop
them.  I'm starting to face problems with sequencing of classes.

If you want to pick on someone, why don't you pick on the so called
atheist for trying to start a back and forth religion fight on here
with his comments?  As far as not being qualified to comment about
PSU, who is if I'm not?  I am a student there, I go to classes 
there.

Just stop already. This is sad. Every single person here understands

Unix here. Not gripe about why /you/ don't understand why some 
university network isn't going to be available for day. You're being a 
troll. It's off topic. YOU are off topic. YOU started this thread.

Let me help you. Say you want to post here, and you're not sure if you 
should. If the post:

1) starts with: "I wonder", "What if/are", "I think", "Why is/are" or 
anything close to that, don't post it here.
2) mentions ReactOS, don't post it here.
3) complains that no one is emulating Windows to your satisfaction, 
don't post it here.
4) really has nothing more to do with *nix than any other item in the 
sphere of I.T., don't post it here. It's not the place.

No one cares about this stuff. Really. And threads like this have the 
likely hood of finding their way back to you. You're going to find 
yourself sitting in a chair in front of a PSU official asking you to 
back up your claims about PSU staff. And when you can't you may not have 
the choice any more to attend there. This is the kind of stuff that's 
really going to get you in trouble.

Their booth, although big, was less than 2% of the floor.  Perhaps 
they hope to increase their share of the top 500 machines from 1% to
1.2%.  Or perhaps they are trying to stay above 0.8%.  It's Microsoft.
It's not like they are wasting money they actually worked for ... :-/

When it turns out that their low-budget development of the country of
Luxembourg isn't really technically "Scandinavian", they will simply
redefine the term "Scandinavian".

In a drastic effort to try and get back on topic, anyone played with
Linux Mint? Is it basically just a shortcut to get more proprietary

I have Mint on a desktop (recently dual-booted with windows) and  
Ubuntu on a recently-purchased Free Geek notebook, so I have been  
comparing them. From a user standpoint, apart from the visual (color  
and theme designs, which are largely adjustable anyway), and the as- 
advertised incorporation of drivers in Mint, they do seem quite  
similar. There are some modest differences in feel and approach.  
Apart from that one convenience distinction of pre-installation, I  
find Ubuntu maybe a bit more comfortable, but that's just personal  
taste. Again, from a relatively non-techie standpoint, they do seem  
to a casual user to be highly similar.

   Some Microsoft jokes are as pointedly funny as many lawyer jokes. This

Roger that.  Worked well on an HP laptop I had a couple years ago.
Upgrade from release to release was not smooth at that time, though.
If that is of concern I recommend checking out their web site for
info.

Had 7 on my laptop up until ubuntu 9.10 came out.  It isn't half bad.  I just figured it didn't really offer anything more than ubuntu already does one way or another.  Its worth installing once and seeing if it suits your fancy.

   This year is the 25th Anniversary of the Geographic Resources Analysis
Support System (GRASS), the most powerful spatial analytical GIS software
available.

   GRASS started life as the Ft. Hood Environmental Management System,
written in C by the Army's Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL) at
the University of Illinois. Written to run on UNIX, it was in the public
domain, but sold by vendors who tuned it to run on various UNIX flavors.
About 10 years ago CERL stopped development and support and the copyright
was transferred to the GIS Research Lab at Baylor University.

   Development continued. led by a small group in Europe, and when the new
version was released it was under the GPL. Development has been on linux
since then, but it also runs on various *BSD and has been ported to winduhs
(with cygwin, I believe).

   A lot of software comes and goes. One of the most powerful DOS
applications, TimeLine, never made it to the linux world (a major loss for
us to be sure), but GRASS grows in its user base and is here to stay. It now
has a working wxPython GUI as well as the original Tcl/Tck GUI, and the
command line interface for defining directories is as ugly and inefficient
as it was 25 years ago. But, it works very well for a very broad range of
applications.

   I'd love to see the hydrological runoff model of the entire US running on
a supercomputer. When it was last done by the fine folks at Baylor (in 2004)
on a Sun workstation (I forget the model), it was the only application
process running and took a week to complete (GRASS-4.1, interger only).

   I thought that I had saved the instructions for this from several years
ago, but apparently I did not.

   I need to remove double quotes from a specific column for all 3200 lines
in a file. I know that I can do a regex search and replace for the beginning
of each line, but the quotes I need to remove are in the interior. It seems
to me that there is a way to block a vertical column and manipulate text
within that marked block, but I no longer remember how to do this.

   Pointers or clues are appreciated.

Put the cursor on the first column of the text you want to remove, set
the mark (c-space), move to the last row, and one colum *past* the
right-most column you want to remove, and then run kill-rectangle (c-x
r k).  There are a few other foo-rectangle commands, but I don't know
them well, other than yank-rectangle (c-x r y).

Note that these keystrokes are *three*distinct* presses, not a 4-key
chord.  (press ctrl-x, release, then r, then k)

After reading your email again, I realized that I probably didn't
actually answer your question.  I'm still not sure I know the best
way, but you can do manipulations on a specific rectangle by using
kill-rectangle as described above, then yanking that rectangle into
*scratch*, do your manipulations in *scratch*, then kill-rectangle the
modified rect again to get it into the kill-ring.

Finally, you can yank-rectangle right back into your original buffer
at the same location you first set the mark.  yank-rectangle should
shift all the old text back over to make room for the newly modified
rectangle of content.

There are also some promising foo-rectangle functions that may do this
more elegantly (eg: apply-on-rectangle) but I haven't taken the time
to puzzle out how to use them.  M-x apropos on 'rectangle' may help
you out.

Subject: [PLUG] Do I want a quad-core Core-2 system?
Message-ID: <20091119010446.GF19825@spiritone.com>

I'm shopping for my first new desktop in five years and hoping to have
it for as long.  My desk area is tiny (converted closet) so I'm
looking at smaller and quieter systems.  (But still mainstream: I've
been a bit disappointed with the stability of VIA-based systems so
want to stick with Intel or perhaps AMD.)

I'm looking closely at Dell's "Optiplex 760" system.  It's available
in two smallish form-factors, one "ultra small" that'll fit on a
bookshelf and a "small" that won't.  But only the latter is available
with a core-2 *quad* processor.  Anybody have experience or strong
feelings about how badly I'll wish I had four cores over the next few
years?

The system will run Debian natively and Windows 7 in qemu or Virtual
Box on top of that.  I expect it'll be most heavily loaded when I'm
running Eclipse.  Our current desktop shows its age when browsing
photo galleries, and can't really run Eclipse at all.

Thanks,

--Eric

interesting.  what problems have you had with VIA systems?  i've been
running a one ghz mini-itx mobo with a 1.2ghz via chip fanless for a
couple of years now and it's been rock solid (except the wifi card i'm
using in it occasionally gets in a fight with ndiswrapper that
requires a reboot to fix, sadly).

i used it as my desktop for about a year before i decided i really
needed more than that motherboard's max 1G of ram to do some things i
wanted so i got a new machine as a desktop and left that as the
server.  it runs beautifully and silently...girlfriend has no
objections to it running all night (once i desoldered the activity
light on the NIC).

Here's a link to a list of people who may submit nominations for the
Nobel peace prize

http://nobelpeaceprize.org/en_GB/nomination_committee/who-can-nominate/ 

Perhaps some of us know and can start by lobbying someone in one of the
following areas:

"University professors of history, political science, philosophy, law
and theology,"

Pity Larry Lessig didn't follow through on his run for Congress, he
would have gotten a hearing if he nominated Linus.

Thanks,
Mike

Mogerly, why did you post a threatening email to me on this Linux list?

You could have emailed me directly, but no, you didn't do that.  

As far as having to explain my comments and not being allowed to attend
PSU anymore, I haven't specifically mentioned any professor by name.  
I have yet to name anyone specifically.  The only way to know who 
I'm talking about is to be a student or otherwise have information 
about who is teaching which class.  If I were to be kicked out of PSU
because I complained about a faculty member, I wouldn't want to stay
there anyways.

As far as the ReactOS comment, Linux+WINE is the alternative currently
where the question of why are ReactOS users commonly anti Linux is
very germane to a Linux list.  The question of should they be working
on Linux software instead of ReactOS is also germane.  ReactOS is
supposedly better than Linux according to many in the ReactOS 
community, why, I'm not so sure.

Linux+WINE still has problems with certain fonts in Microsoft Word and
other Windows applications such as Warcraft II simply do not work,
probably because of DirectX dependencies.  I'm not certain of this,
but I suspect that one can't use TurboTax under Linux using WINE.
There is opentaxproject, but they need someone qualified to add the
capability to do Oregon taxes.

I have a right to respond to a prejudiced atheist and to your threats as
well Mogerly.

He does not deserve a nobel peace prize.

World peace comes from God where Linus if I am not mistaken
is an atheist.  He is incapable of experiencing world peace.
As far as Linux producing world peace, it's use is still 
very limited in the world.  Microsoft still provides the
operating system for over 80% of personal computers.

Sadly, the 11 or so percent that use Linux in the world are 
still a minority.

Indirectly, Linux may be contributing to important research
that will help secure world peace by relieving the world's
dependence on OIL for transportation use.  The person who
would deserve a nobel peace prize though would be the lead
physicist/chemist/etcetera using Linux to solve such 
important problems.

If anything, Linus may have created a boost for atheism which
threatens world peace.  Without God, Man has no solid reason
to respect himself or his neighbor.  Without God, there is no
happiness and no peace.  To an atheist, Man is just a machine
with no guiding ethic whatsoever.

That looks like a nice model line.  Even comes with DisplayPort.
I'd be surprised if you find yourself wanting the quad-core, but I bet you
a box of Soylent Green that you'll want the extra DIMM slots and the PCIe
slot in the "Small" system.

So, um... Everyone feeling froggy tonight?   I'm of the opinion that Linus deserves it much more than Glorious Leader of the People did.  But then again, that has nothing to do with Linux either.

Isn't there some tenant of the mailing list rules that would allow for 
withdrawing this user from
participating based on lack of topical discussion?

I don't even know where to start with this post, so I won't even justify 
it's contents.

Where else would I talk about Linus and the nobel peace price other 
than here?  I should point out that I wasn't the first person to bring
this topic up, I'm probably only the first person to say that he
doesn't deserve one.  And it's God Bill, not god.  Just because you
have no respect for your God doesn't mean that I lack respect.

But other people saying Linus deserves a nobel peace prize on the plug
list is okay?  If we are going to talk about peace, the source of peace
should be relevant to the discussion.

My god isn't named God, Michael.  Only someone who is blind to other 
religions would
assume so.

I am now done furthering this topic. 

I for one think that someone like Linus who creates
something that brings people together for a common cause and if somehow 
those people
by having been brought together create something else that furthers the 
cause of peace
is directly responsible through that lineage.

Go Linus! and if he wins, seriously, will he deserve it any less that 
Obama?  (Not a flame war,
I actually like him.  He has a very hard job to do)

Why is it that every bloody adult discussion these days invariably 
devolves in some kind of banal religious harangue?  It's unnecessary and 
uncivil.  And, ironically, it does not  foster peace in the community.

No!  I have as much right to discuss this here as anyone else and I
won't step aside for anyone.  The following is crap and I didn't post
it.

When it turns out that their low-budget development of the country of
Luxembourg isn't really technically "Scandinavian", they will simply
redefine the term "Scandinavian".

I think you make an excellent case.  Tovalds or Mark Shuttleworth would 
make excellent choices for a Nobel laureate, IMO.  Their contributions 
to humanity will endure long after most of today's major crises and 
concerns have crumbled into dust.

Sorry Terry, but you are wrong.  Giving Linus a nobel peace prize, an atheist,
would make a mockery of the award.  And oh, why is Terry allowed to be off topic

If I build a machine for someone in your position, I always recommend 
getting the current generation of processor, which here would mean an 
i7/socket 1366 platform. This means you will spend more though. Having 
said that, if you're computing needs are not specific, or demanding in a 
particular area, any modern Core2 Duo or Quad system will last 5 years. 
Just make sure that the system you buy supports the fastest FSB speeds 
for the processor you buy. This way, you can buy an inexpensive dual 
core today to save money, and a more powerful quad core in a couple 
years for a quick and easy upgrade. In a couple years, all the quad 
core's of today will be on eBay cheap.

FYI, Dell's can be finicky in the CPU upgrade dept. (due motherboard 
revisions and such), more than likely have a proprietary power supply, 
and have very specific memory requirements (narrow voltage and timing 
ranges). They're OK, but it's really easy to build one these days.

Neither Linus nor Obama deserve a nobel peace prize.

Obama lost the Iraq war when we were winning there and he is losing in
Afghanistan as well where he has no exit strategy whatsoever.  Worse,
Obama wants to give terrorists rights and bring them onto American soil
where if they escape they can cause great harm.

As far as Linux bringing people together, it isn't promoting the cause
of peace.  Linus does not deserve that honor.  Mother Teresa and people
like her who believe in God and serve their fellow Man deserve that
honor instead.

Obama's job is hard for him considering that he can't make a major
decision without delaying for months on end.  He won't put more troops
in Afghanistan and he won't pull us out.

I think it's worth recounting Keith's original letter of support. From
its very beginnings, the Nobel Peace Prize has often been only
tangentally related to peace - but has frequently been related to great
events in history. 

Linux is one of those ongoing events. Through projects such as OLPC, it
is bringing much of the developing world (especially the poorest parts)
into the modern age.

I suggest that we take Keith's original note - perhaps in some edited
form - to the [i]Norwegians[/i] who formulate the Nobel committee - and
to some appropriate American(s) who can nominate Linus. (In an earlier
note, I cited some of those from whom nominations are accepted,
including some "University professors of history, political science,
philosophy, law and theology."

I further suggest that we take this to other Linux groups in the United
States and elsewhere, in an effort to get their support - and in the
hope that they too will push for Linus' nomination.

As the main Linux user group associated with Linus' current residence, I
think it's appropriate for the effort to start here.

Thanks,
Mike

While I am generally onboard with the idea that a prominent figure of the
Open Source community might be recognized as a leader of world peace (or
simply as having had a large humanitarian impact), it is unclear to me that
Linus Torvalds is the correct recipient. Linux is a cool piece of software.
Cooler yet are the GPL under which (by some stroke of great luck) Linux was
licensed, and all of the GNU software utilities were originated. Given
Richard Stallman's activism for the underlying development model (this is
what has truly enabled such change) I might prefer to see him nominated.
All-be-he not as peaceful a persona as Linus.

I'm scoping out thinkpads, with a specific interest in video out
technologies, and I've seen DisplayPort come up a few times.  So far,
all I've gleaned is that it's a smaller connector that can support
some forms of DRM to prevent displaying on unauthorized devices.  That
doesn't sound particularly compelling, but I'm curious if it has other
benefits.

Does anyone know what *is* compelling about DispayPort over HDMI /
DVI, and if there will be any driver/support issues associated with
using DisplayPort under Linux?

Thanks!

Linux is not a major invention, it is simply a free version of an
existing one called Unix which had many flavors in the early 90s.
I don't think Linus would want a nobel peace prize because he
would not see himself as being the sole force that brought Linux
into existence, and he wasn't.  The nobel peace prize should not
go to an atheist period.  Nor should it go to chairman Mao, though 
he's dead now.  Mao had a major historical impact on China, but it's
doubtful that the average Chinese person today would nominate him
for the nobel peace prize.  Heck, let's nominate Saddham Hussein 
for the nobel peace prize.  Atheists do not bring peace to the world.
When has Linus cared for the poor?  When has he prayed for the sick?
What charity work does Linus do?  People who don't believe in God are
not likely to be charitable let alone prayerful let alone humble.
Atheists have no respect for God creating them in His image and little
to no respect for other people's incredible dignity.

There is a prediction that a major economic crisis is coming that will
affect the whole world which noone will escape.  When that happens,
people will pray.  Indeed, I wish it was happening now.  The world
needs to be shaken to it's foundations.  There will be no peace in
the world until the people of the world accept God into their souls.

A better cause is to pray for Linus' conversion from atheism to any

Instead of previous technologies that were designed around scan lines
of a CRT DisplayPort is a bidirectional packet based protocol that can
transfer arbitrary data, and thus things like digital audio in the
same cable.  It isn't married to the number of pins on the connector,
and thus allows for future bandwidth increases simply by adding more
pins.  Apple went with it because they were already running up against
bandwidth limitations with their high end displays.

The ability to do different kinds of DRM over it is just a side effect
of it being able to pass arbitrary data over the cable, and thus it
was just a matter of specifying a data protocol for it.  Another
advantage is that it uses less power to drive it than HDMI, or DVI.
It is the official standard by the people who brought us VESA.

And something to look for in the future is it specifies using fiber
optics for the cable as an option.

I am afraid I don't know.  My fingers do, but I don't.  And
unfortunately, every time they try to tell you, they whack column-wise
chunks out of this text as they try to demonstrate.  So I made them
stop.  I'm sorry it didn't work out.

Looks like Rogan is an emacs kind of person.  Maybe you are, too. I'm a vim
guy, myself. There it's
1. cursor to column of interest
2. ctrl-v (visual block mode)
3. motion commands to select lines
4. edit command of choice (d for delete, s fro replace, etc)

For my file of 23575 lines:
1. cursor to column 5.
2. ctrl-v
3. 23575j
4. d

et voila!

Of course, if you are not vim-savvy, there could be a learning curve.

So far, my experience is that -- on a Linux box -- DisplayPort offers 
no compelling features nor any repelling problems. (Well, there might 
be overscan problems when connecting to a television using HDMI, but 
that's a different problem...)

It'd be cool if the machine's hardware allowed audio i/o over 
DisplayPort/HDMI, but that's not a widespread feature yet.

   Well, it turns out that I cannot find a way to block a rectangle of text
rather than a stream of text in emacs. However, 'joe' has the capability of
turning text selection into a rectangular block. That must have been what I
used in the past.

Also, from the command line, assuming n is the column number of interest
(starting from 1)

cut -c 1-(n-1),(n+1)- oldfile > newfile

read
"cut dash c 1 dash n minus 1 comma n plus 1 dash oldfile-in to newfile out"

so if the column of interest is 17, the command is

cut -c 1-16,18- oldfile > newfile

The NPP has been shared in the past. I think if you're considering 
nominating Linus, I think you could make a strong case for nominating 
RMS as well.  Peace comes through cooperation, sharing, and community 
building across cultural boundaries. It is the combination of Linux and 
the Open Source (FSF, GPL) which has made the greatest contribution to 
world peace. So I find it difficult to consider nominating one without 
the other.

+1 to this advice. I will also say that we're finally reaching the point 
where solid state disk drives are dropping in price quickly and offering 
a substantial performance boost. I'd say make sure your system supports 
the fastest SATA standard available today, as soon you'll be able to 
make good use of that bandwidth for disk I/O (the real bottleneck of 
nearly every desktop/workstation).

Try C-h a "rectangle"

While I agree about the contribution of RMS relative to Linus, there
are practical considerations.  I think if RMS were awarded a share of
the Nobel Peace Prize, there is a significant chance that he might
refuse to accept it unless it is renamed the GNU/Nobel Peace Prize.

Personally, I think that'd be cool.

   Thank you. It also turns out that Rogan's series of key strokes works very
well. What threw me is that the block highlighting is for the entire row
while the commands act only on the intended columns.

I've (hopefully) planted the seed in a friend of mine who happens to be
a professor of political science.  And I'll try to do the same with a
few other friends.  I strongly believe that both of them should be
nominated.

Thanks for suggesting this, Keith.

Who Tim?  Get a life please.  Reasonably speaking, religion usually
promotes peace through service to your fellow man, so it is entirely
possible that God is the source of peace where his followers are 
to serve each other out of love for Him.  Most religions attribute
incredible dignity to Man and demand that we see God in each other.  
You don't know what you are talking about Tim.  Indeed, you probably
believe that all beliefs are corrupt.  You offer no atheistic 
foundation for peace.  I wouldn't expect you to, there is no 
such foundation.  To the atheist, Man is just a machine made in 
nothings image with no dignity whatsoever.  For an atheist, a Man
can do whatever he wants with his body.  He can abuse it, he can
harvests parts off of other people's bodies, he can kill other people,
he can do whatever he wants to do to the human body.  Because of this
lack of respect for the human body, atheists cannot promote peace let
alone offer a non sectarian foundation for it.

The Truth never makes things worse.  My beliefs are not unfounded, but
you obviously can't respect people who believe something.

The Nobel Peace Prize should go to someone who seeks to bring God's
peace into the world.  I didn't bring religion onto the list, those
who pushed to have Linus get a Nobel Peace Prize did.  If instead
the talk was about Linus getting a prize that is not the Nobel
Peace Prize, things would be different.  It is not fair from the
religious person's point of view to have to endure an anti religious
God is not the source of peace commentary and not be allowed to counter
it.  This is one of the reasons why the Nobel Peace Prize should never
have been discussed on the main Linux list.  That is not my fault by 
the way, it is Keith Lofstrom's fault for starting the discussion.

A big hint that you are not respecting other people's points of view is
when you call someone a lunatic for believing something.  Another big
hint is when you talk about Truth without having any basis in reality.
Believing in a God that calls Man to respect himself and other people
is a belief that promotes peace.  Doing what God calls you to do NEVER
promotes war and chaos.  Indeed, God only allows chaos when it will 
open people's eyes and promote peace in the long run.  Not allowing
chaos means that the righteous would never be tested, not even if they
need the test.

Linus probably doesn't want the Nobel Peace Prize and he probably
doesn't deserve it.  Noone can make the argument that Linux
coming into existence alone has advanced the cause of peace.
As far as bringing people together, how has Linux convinced

Keith, you owe an apology to those who know that peace comes from
God and that atheists cannot promote it because they lack the life
ethic that theists have.

You also owe everyone an apology for bringing a deeply religious issue,
the nature and source of peace, onto this Linux list.

I just found rect-mark.el:

   http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/rect-mark.el

which provides an alternate way to work with rectangular selections
that *does* display a representative highlight.

Holy crap people!  The whole Nobel Prize is a joke considering it is named after the man who invented high explosive.  The prize for peace is the least of the prizes to begin with.  Its money in the hand and a fancy award and life goes on.  Religion has nothing to do with it and please stop you are killing my blackberry with this piffle.

High explosives are not a direct threat to peace.  It is how they are
used that tends to be a problem.  As far as the this is not a religious
issue comment, where is your respect for the point of view that it is?
Can you offer a truly atheistic foundation for peace?  Without a life
ethic, can you promote peace?  Can you even explain how Linux is
specifically promoting peace in the world?  Is not promoting that one
Man be at peace with another promoting an ethic that respects human
life?  How can an atheist have such an ethic when Man's incredible
dignity stems from the fact that he is created in the image and
likeness of God and the atheist rejects God?

Can you explain how taking this thread any further on the Linux list 
is Linux related and appropriate?  I answer you here because you 
posted here and it only seems fair that a religious fight in the
public view be answered in the same public view.

Even if the origins of the nobel peace prize are a joke, it is seen
as an award that should go to people who actually promote peace.  The
concept of peace is a deeply religious one.  Anything that involves
human dignity is a religious issue.  Name one atheist living the
lifestyle that Mother Teresa of Calcutta did?  Linus isn't that
atheist.  Atheists do not serve the cause of peace because they
do not serve God through service to their fellow Man.  Indeed,
atheism is a barrier to peace.

+1 to this advice. I will also say that we're finally reaching the point 

where solid state disk drives are dropping in price quickly and offering 

a substantial performance boost. I'd say make sure your system supports 

the fastest SATA standard available today, as soon you'll be able to 

make good use of that bandwidth for disk I/O (the real bottleneck of 

nearly every desktop/workstation).

While I agree about the contribution of RMS relative to Linus, there

are practical considerations.  I think if RMS were awarded a share of

the Nobel Peace Prize, there is a significant chance that he might

refuse to accept it unless it is renamed the GNU/Nobel Peace Prize.



Personally, I think that'd be cool.

Keith, you owe an apology to those who know that peace comes from

God and that atheists cannot promote it because they lack the life

ethic that theists have.



You also owe everyone an apology for bringing a deeply religious issue,

the nature and source of peace, onto this Linux list.

Peace is a relationship between *ANY* people characterized by respect, 
justice, and goodwill.
The early English term is also used in the sense of "quiet 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiet>", reflecting a calm, serene, and 
meditative approach to the family or group relationships that avoids 
quarreling and seeks tranquility 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tranquility> ? an absence of disturbance 
or agitation.

One might, under the auspices of Mr. Connor's definition of peace, make the claim that there were an agent of unrest in this thread - indeed, one who, under said definition, acted as an obstacle to peace on the Portland Linux UNIX Group's mailing lists.

Ok, so let's say I wanted to build my own system (for the first time
in my life).  Where to go in Portland?  My impression is that what I
want isn't at all mainstream: a small, quiet system with hardware,
including graphics, that's fully supported by open-source software.
I think that means Intel graphics, and have the impression that's hard
to find on the motherboards sold to enthusiasts at typical computer
stores.

Thanks!

Not if one buys an intel board its not :). Last Intel board I bought (dx95gag I think) had onboard Intel.  Great board, it is.  5 years and still going strong with its Pentium 4 goodness.

Hi Michael,

Not knowing Linus personally other than chatting with him at a
conference for a few minutes earlier this year, I can't say whether
Linus as a person for his beliefs or non beliefs deserves to be
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  I believe Linus has done some great
technical work and I admire him for that.  I guess you can say it can
be considered "the best work for fraternity between nations".
Honestly, the fact that I can contribute to something that people all
over the world might benefit from is just amazing.

I fail to understand what beliefs have to do with anything Keith had
originally mentioned.  As far as I know Alfred Nobel wrote in his will
regarding the peace prize: "the person who shall have done the most or
the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or
reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of
peace congresses"

I respect that for you peace can only come from one source but I'm not
sure that's how the committee chooses who deserves the prize.  The
fact that some past laureates have had strong religious affiliations I
don't think makes it a requirement.


Cheers,
-Omar

Eric,

   I've bought many components from ENU on NE 122nd Ave. They know what is
supported by linux and will work with you to get you what you need. I've
found them better than other local shops, but that's based only on my
experiences.

I second the ENU suggestion.  On the other hand, Keith went through an
exercise to build a small, low power, quiet machine recently, although it
may have been targeted at something less than general purpose.  He had
several posts about it, probably available in the archives (???) or
digests.  Better yet, Keith, can you chime in here?

It never has been outstanding. At any rate, support for this device has been included in the 2.6.31 Linux kernel, which is installed by Ubuntu Karmic among other distros. However, there still does not seem to be support for microphone input. Is there a way to overcome this limitation, and use a microphone with the current 2.6.31 kernel? (If it's Ubuntu-specific, perhaps compiling a kernel obtained from kernel.org would be the answer.)

Subject: [PLUG] Dell Server Quad Cores?
Message-ID: <1258697869.10053.22.camel@UbuntuHH>

Folks, 

Not quite on the topic of home-brew quad cores, I've been looking at the
Dell PowerEdge T110 or maybe the T310 (hoping for a special for Cyber
Monday)

http://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/poweredge-t110?c=us&l=en&s=bsd&cs=04
http://www.dell.com/us/en/business/servers/server-poweredge-t310/pd.aspx?refid=server-poweredge-t310&s=bsd&cs=04

People here have knocked good sense into me before w/r/t hardware, and
I'm hoping y'all can do the same if needed with respect to these
options. 

But for now, I'm a little tired of running low on memory every time I
have more than a couple of VMware systems going. My current system (an
eBay home brew - is coming up on 5 years) is limited to 2GB. 

Yup, the RAM for such servers is more expensive, but perhaps c'est la
vie w/r/t servers? I may need to experiment with some VMware ESXi, and
appreciate the bare metal capabilities, so I have little confidence in
my ability to set up a home brew with such compatibility. 

I also appreciate the no-OS options for these systems, along with the
known compatibility with the standard Linux server OSes.

Your comments will be appreciated.

Thanks,
Mike

Mike,
I have a Power Edge 1425 SC and it's been rock solid for nearly 4 years.
Parts can be spendy through Dell but well worth the investment.

I am running a fairly old distro (an RHEL5 clone) with an older
kernel, and I wanted a DVI video motherboard to digitally drive
an LCD.  That turned out to be fairly difficult - I first bought
a nice little Intel motherboard, locally, but it turned out that
there was no way to get drivers that worked with the new Intel
chipset, my 1400x1050 display, and that older kernel.  Yikes!  

I ended up buying a Gigabyte motherboard from Newegg, with an 
nVidia chipset.  That did work.  I think I still have the Intel
motherboard, and for most distros and screen sizes it ought to
work fine.

To save power and reduce noise I did not go to a quad core.  I
am using a 2.93GHz E7500 Intel Core 2 Duo CPU.  I have a much
more powerful machine with an nVidia 8800GTS card that supports
CUDA programming, which I will use for some supercomputer style
number crunching Real Soon Now.  Mostly that is turned off.

I also got very finicky about the case.  I had bought a Antec
Sonata superquiet case for another system, and wanted more for
my office.  Antec stopped making them, I guess gamers don't 
care about case noise anyway.  I ended up getting some of the
last cases available transferred from Fry's in Sacramento.

I did all the power savings partly because it is The Right Thing,
but mostly because lower power means slower fans and more quiet.
And I really, really want a quiet office.  Which I have, the
new cases (one on my desktop machine, one on my compute server)
are quiet, and the motherboard is quiet.   Both machines have
extra large CPU fans, selected for low DB at the low setting.
Now the loudest thing in my office is the sound of paper moving
in my printer.  

I like the people at ENU, but they are mostly an ASUS shop and
gamer-oriented.  I have heard unsubstantiated rumors that the
newest ASUS mobos use chipsets that are not Linux friendly
(I would love to learn differently).   I tend to get stuff
from Newegg because of the wide selection and the customer
reviews - many Linux people share the details of their 
experiences.   

So - the bottom line is:  Don't buy too much compute power -
save power and money.  Use Big Slow Fans - look at the dB
ratings, some are much quieter than others.  Find a quiet case
with sound dampening panels in the side.  A high efficiency
quiet supply like the Antec Earthwatts series is nice, and
unless you are running a monster CPU, lots of hard drives,
or a gynormous video card, you can get by with 400 watts
of power supply (probably less).  Look desperately for a
sound dampened case - it makes a heck of a difference.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Finally, I suggest you prepare a bill of materials for your
new system and share it with this list.  After we argue about
what you should buy ( "200W Quad Core!"  "No, Atom!" ),
you can order the pieces and bring them to the next Linux
Clinic on December 20.  We can watch as you put it together
and help you avoid some of the goofier mistakes.   Perhaps
we can designate that day as the Christmas Clinic and all
have fun opening packages together.

Hopefully a few people made it over in time for your ignite talk... just
as Alan's voice was going out from screaming over the loud music that we
weren't warned would be at the PLUG-AT venue.

Thank you everyone for helping beta test this venue. The food was good
but the scheduling conflicts they didn't warn us about were
unacceptable. I later learned that they have a few parking spaces we can
use in the adjacent lot which may put a point back in their court.
Aiming for a Tuesday or Wednesday should give us a quieter experience
there at Club 915.

Dare we try this venue again if they can guarantee that it will be quiet
and we get to use their parking?

Michael

Subject: [PLUG] Cloning BattleTech I for Linux...
Message-ID: <1258705721.8933.15.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I'm working on a clone of Battletech I the Crescent Hawk's Inception put
out by Infocom in the 80's.  The clone is intended for Linux.  So far,
I'm starting very simple.  I've created a text file where I am creating
the dialogues for the training missions, etcetera.  I want to add a few
things of course, like the ability to use Pacifica's facilities after
the raid and I have some other ideas as well.  For instance, I'd like
to make it possible to get a Jenner or an Urbanmech by salvaging one
after destroying the Arena.  Essentially, it never made sense to me 
that you can't destroy the arena when you aren't renting a 'Mech.  It
also doesn't make sense if you have multiple 'Mechs that you wouldn't
be able to meet up with your team and fight the Urbanmechs outside the
Arena walls.

I want my version to be smarter so for instance you can listen to
the holodisk after it has been repaired in the ruins of the barracks.
I also want to implement shell counts for machine guns, missile
launchers, rifles, pistols, and bows so that picking up rare hand 
held laser weapons makes sense.  I believe in supporting four 'Mech
warriors as opposed to 3 and I believe in having the main character
train the doctor and the tech.

In the original game you have to find a doctor, a tech, a veteran 
'Mech warrior, and a regular 'Mech warrior.  The team when you find
everyone is made up of 5 people.  It should be possible to train
everyone in my opinion to use a 'Mech.

In the original game you have to get the doctor and the tech trained
and find the Star League Cache essentially, after you get some help
from Dr. Tellhim of course.  I want to change that a bit so that you
can use the 'Mechs found in the Star League Cache to say defend and
rebuild Pacifica.  Obviously, I want to copy the original game first
and then I can see about plot changes to make it more interesting.

I am interested in how to do the graphics for this.  I want to use
either X or I suppose I could use svgalib.

Ultimately, I'd like to release the source code for this so that it
is a free game that anyone can improve upon.  I am not trying to 
create a clone of Mechwarrior, there is a certain appeal to this 
old game.

One thought if I can clone this game successfully is to make the
allies and perhaps even the enemies real players.

As I recall the story: He was (wrongly) declared dead. Obituaries were
run. This did not make him happy, as he was still very much breathing.
He noted that his chemistry history, and the resulting obituary
announcements, focused on his contributions to war, not peace.

That being said, I'd spread the award among Linus, RMS, and Jimbo
Wales, for creating/enabling their globally used tools, and sites,
that transcend culture, people, politics, and nations.

Actually, handing it to the Obamessiah before he actually *did* anything 
truly capped it as a joke.

Linus Torvalds & Richard Stallman would be more qualified on achievement 
alone. The question still remaind about whether Linux enhances peace.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0911200630590.6580@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   It appears that the built-in wireless radio in the Toshiba Satellite model
L455-S5975 we just bought is exceptionally weak. While it works well while
on the desk in the office next to the AP (88-100%), it does not work 30 feet
away in the den (44% at best). It apparently also does not connect
consistenly when used at other locations offering wireless access to the
'Net. This really surprised me when I moved it between the office and the
den.

   While I could add an antenna to the Linksys AP here, that won't help when
it's taken elsewhere. I have the Orinoco Gold pcmcia card that worked well
(at least here so I assume elsewhere, too) with the ThinkPad and Tecra.
Would that be a practical solution? What about a USB wireless radio?
Apparently something is needed at the laptop to boost both transmission
strength and reception sensitivity.

   If an external adapter is the solution, what changes need to be made to
the system so the kernel uses the external device by default?

   Any and all suggestions from you wireless experts is appreciated.

that is very odd.  wireless in laptops have been pretty good for some time 
now.  i'd pop open the little door on the bottom and make sure that that 
the antenna connections are solidly attached to the wireless card (most 
like a mini pci-e card).

Hmmm, unless I'm missing something, I think of Jimbo Wales primarily
with Wikipedia. While that is an amazing achievement in and of itself,
it seems to be a different topic from Linux.

Alternatively, I could see a prize being awarded to Linus and the Open
Source community, as represented by the FSF. At least on the surface,
that type of split would be similar to '97 prize split between Jody
Williams and the Landmine campaign. I think it would better suit how
Stallman pushes GNU with Linux.

IMO, the real ongoing achievement of Linux is how it spreads knowledge
of technology in developing nations, bringing that power to the poorest
of the poor through national-focused distributions and projects such as
OLPC.

Thanks,
Mike

Joe,

   It certainly took me by surprise. I'll check the laptop later today. If
it's not a poor connection on the internal wireless card, what else might
account for this behavior?

Another problem with Club 915 is that it is an open space, with
lots of different activities.  Unless we rented the whole club,
there would be people playing pool, rehearsing fashion shows,
hanging out in the disco lights, or just doing what drunks do.

We had none of these problems, or anything approaching them, in 
the (very large) back room at Roots.  It is quiet, less expensive,
there is plenty of parking, and there are a few real chairs.  They
do not have chairs for it now, but if we rented more chairs we
could probably fit 100 people in there for a special event.
I don't know whether the three block proximity to Free Geek
matters much, but that might help with staging for hardware
laden demos.

The disadvantages of Roots are (1) the additional transit trip
from downtown on the 14 Hawthorne bus. (2) potential light problems
in the summer months - they are on the southwest corner of the
building.  (3) we need to bring our own power strips if we have
a large crowd with laptops.

Roots moved stuff so we can get at the controls of the vertical
blinds, so light control might be easier now.  The space works 
well for Personal Telco's monthly meetings, and the more geek
functions we hold in there, the more they will accommodate our
needs.

The big room space at Northwest Lucky Lab is also available, but
we are told that gets crowded in the summer months.

All three venues have adequate wifi.

So, I propose we try Roots again for December, perhaps on the
same third Thursday to accomodate schedules, and see how people
like that.  We can try Club 915 again in January, and then argue
preferences after we've given a fair trial to both.

When you say "spreads knowledge", I think access to knowledge and 
information. I implemented 'Skolelinux' in a tech college computer lab a 
few years ago. It was developed by a group of people who wanted to see 
free and open software in schools and give kids access to the source 
code. This is the real power; it's not about us here and now. It's about 
giving the new generation access to the tools and information to create 
a better world for themselves.

A couple others:
The Cacophony Society likes Old Town Pizza, both the one in Old Town and on
MLK.  The MLK one has a nice upstairs that can be reserved, and apparently,
they're quite tolerant of brainy shenanigans.

I like Hawthorne Fish House, which has a great back room.

Bridgeport Ale House has a big room that's used by Science Pub, but I don't
know if there's a charge.

Unfortunately, OTP in Old Town may be hard for drivers, while OTP on MLK
and Hawthorne Fish House my be hard for transit folks.  And I can't speak
for Wi-Fi at any of them.

(Odd idea: how about Powell's Books - they have book groups, and we might
make it into one of their newsletters...)

Note that the Thursday schedule at Roots has Live Music starting at 9.  That
shouldn't be a problem;  Wednesday's schedule has Open Mic starting at 9,
and that never seemed to be a problem, unless the Live Music venue is the
event space.  I'll contact Sarah (Roots event coordinator) about the
scheduling change if Keith's proposal is acceptable.

It's a good thing I wasn't holding my diet coke cup when I read this.

I could argue that *you* owe the rest of us an apology for believing that the
only path to world peace is through your personal religion.  I could even trot
out statistics to show that Christianity (and all religions) has, on the
whole, done more to *destroy* world peace than to create it or encourage it or
enhance it.

Can you just, please, for all of us, agree that this is off-topic
for plug-general?

When thinking about projects like securing the Nobel Peace Prize,
think in terms of optimizing for a successful outcome rather than
optimizing for proper distribution of credit. 

Right now, there is a controversy in the electronics community
about which individuals should have gotten the Nobel Physics
Prize for the CCD imager.  There was a cast of thousands,
including at least one PLUG member.  Where do you stop? 

If we include the deserving Mark Shuttleworth and Richard Stallman
and Jimmy Wales, shouldn't we include Ward Cunningham, for example?
How about Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson?  Kirk McCusick?  Tim
Behrners-Lee?  Bob Metcalfe?  Vint Cerf?  Lawrence Lessig?  Bill
Gates (gasp)???  The list is endless - and that is our most
powerful selling point.

Would you demand Richard Stallman if the result was the inclusion
of Bill Gates as well?  Remember, we can suggest (indirectly), 
but we CANNOT CHOOSE.  It is a committee of 5 Norwegian
politicians who make the choice.  Think about their decision
making process, and the pressures they must respond to.

The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded to communities, usually in the
form of their most visible and least controversial leader.  Study
the history of the prize recipients.  Yes, there are some flavors
of the month, and there are plenty of individuals who later proved
unworthy of the prize, but across the broad sweep of history, the
movements they represented mattered, and still affect us today.

For example, the award to the Current Occupant is not for the
particular accomplishments of that person, but to the American
election process.  Amid much contention, we still did something
that would be impossible in most of the rest of the racist world. 
If the result of that is more free and open elections in the
rest of the world, it takes away some of the sting for those of
us who preferred different candidates.  Many may not agree with
the particular result, and we may all regret our votes before
the 2012 election, but this is the kind of process that the
Prize committee rewards.  We need to match their expectations.

I suggest we focus our efforts on a single well known, long 
established, and relatively uncontroversial candidate, because
we can succeed best that way.  We make it clear that by honoring
Linus Torvalds, we are honoring the entire open world creative
community, and  all the other contributors who will be thrilled
to see L.T. get it (that is, everyone on the list above except
Bill Gates).  We are honoring the work of the 1962 Nobel Prize
committee, whose award to Linus Pauling had a direct effect on
the production of Linux and of its principal author.  And we 
draw support from every country in the world.

We open the door for other twentieth anniversary prizes, such
as the 2021 peace prize for Wikipedia to Jimmy Wales and Ward
Cunningham, the 2021 literature prize to Lawrence Lessig for
Creative Commons, and the 2024 peace prize for Ubuntu to Mark
Shuttleworth.  This is our first opportunity;  if we do it
right, it is by no means our last. 

That is how we sell the idea to Linus Torvalds - he will be
helping establish the Nobel Hackers Club, which will eventually
include computational physicists and chemists and physicians,
collaborative literature groups, perhaps someday an A.I. entity
or two.  It is time to leave the machine closet and take our
place in the sun ( the bright thing in the big blue room )!

Finally, framed in those terms and establishing those precedents,
does anyone here think Steve Ballmer will EVER get a Nobel Prize
for the monkey boy dance?

 It certainly took me by surprise. I'll check the laptop later today. If
it's not a poor connection on the internal wireless card, what else might
account for this behavior?

What is the chance that it is just a faulty unit?  Any way to check
out another of the same model?

That's a lot to chew on and I see where you're coming from. It is my understanding though that the award
is for work done in the past year. Yes, I'm not sure exactly how that applies to Obama or to the 
election process. Maybe because there were less antics this time? 

So, the challenge is to make the case for what Linus has done for us lately.

The "Nobel Hackers Club" is brilliant. I'm reading the 'Hacker Ethic' right now, and it would be great
to help the world understand hackers and their contributions.

As a side note, although that list of other people have made notable technical contributions, RMS has
single handledly done more for our freedom to access, modify, and share source code.

The Old Town version of Old Town Pizza is no longer a Personal Telco
node.  I am not sure what they are doing, if anything, for tubes
(i.e. internet) these days.  I'm not holding a grudge, mind you, but
they had a somewhat confused notion of what constituted security risk
to their private network due to their then-public wifi network.

FWIW.

Subject: [PLUG] Older version of Nautilus for Squeeze
Message-ID: <20091120191543.8bd0b4ed.johnxj@comcast.net>

A month ago I attempted to install Debian testing amd64 on a new hard
drive. Unfortunately I messed up the window manager and could not
repair the problem even after several days of poking around. I decided
to put my Jaunty hard drive back in and do a complete reinstall later.

Later is now. I put the new hard drive in the Thinkpad T61 this morning
and installed testing. This time I did it as a netinst. It took only
two hours. 

One problem I noticed previously was that Nautilus was messed up. You
could not create bookmarks, for example. And clicking on Preferences
crashed it completely. After reading the bug reports I gather that the
problem is dependencies that don't match yet. 

I find the current situation with Nautilus very annoying. I'd like to
install an older version that will work. The version that came with
testing is 2.26.3. I note that my desktop (Intrepid) has 2.24.1. I
tried to use Synaptic to force a version, but the checkbox is grayed
out. I am guessing that it is grayed out because the respositories I
have enabled have only the current version 2.26.3.

The repositories I currently have are:

deb http://debian.osuosl.org/debian squeeze main non-free contrib
debsrc http://debian.osuosl.org/debian squeeze main non-free contrib
deb http://debian-multimedia.org/ testing main non-free contrib
deb http://debian.scribus.net/debian/ testing main non-free contrib
plus the two security repos

I recall that the installer defaulted to the main server for the United
States, but the osuosl mirror was listed as an option. I'm glad I chose
it - damn fast.

I think I need to add another repo to get other versions of Nautilus,
but I'm too new to the Debian way of things to figure out which one.
Are there any Debian users here who can give me a clue? Or tell me that
I am as messed up as Nautilus?

Here's a link to a list of people who may submit nominations for the
Nobel peace prize

http://nobelpeaceprize.org/en_GB/nomination_committee/who-can-nominate/ 

Perhaps some of us know and can start by lobbying someone in one of the
following areas:

"University professors of history, political science, philosophy, law
and theology,"

Pity Larry Lessig didn't follow through on his run for Congress, he
would have gotten a hearing if he nominated Linus.

Thanks,
Mike

Joe,

   The "little door on the bottom" is screwed in very tightly, and it flexes
when I press on the screwdriver. Because the unit is brand new I stopped
before I stripped the head on the little screw or did other damage.

Then, either (a) the originator of this question and all participants in 
this discussion must be EQUALLY admonished and understand that the 
question should have been posited on Plug-Talk in the first place, or

(b) the rules need to be fixed so that when the occasional question pops 
up which inquires of the worth or value of a person, a concept which can 
never be established by science or rational argument alone, and can 
certainly never be established secular means alone, to wit, when it is 
understood that what is being elicited from the participants are their 
opinions of a man:

That statements of the form
"[Positive/Negative] assessment, appended by [a belief positing how any 
man may be found worthy of anything, or may be found lacking]

are known to be admissible, for ANY and ALL belief systems stated.

Discrimination against a person because when asked of the value of man, 
a person applies his religion to arrive at an assessment and states so 
publicly, when any and every other answer is either unsupported, or 
originates from equally arbitrary beliefs and assessments

IS DEPRECATED.

Tolerance of multiculturalism, and civility toward others whose belief 
systems differ from your own, demands nothing less.

Let us consider ALL of us equally warned.

... And go back to having fun using Linux and improving the experience 
for each other....

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu to Debian Second Attempt - Day 2
Message-ID: <20091122001443.93b6db89.johnxj@comcast.net>

About a month ago I installed Debian testing amd64 on a new hard disk,
keeping my old Jaunty hard disk untouched. Unfortunately, I messed up
the window manager and could not get it repaired after several days of
poking. I reinstalled the Jaunty hard disk to get some work done, but
now I am back reinstalling Debian testing.

This time it has taken only two days to get to the point where almost
everything is working as it was in Jaunty. And no messed up window
manager (yet).

Now, I know someone is going to ask why I would bother to move to
Debian if everything was working in Jaunty. I have two motivations:

1) It is time to move on. I have used Ubuntu exclusively since Breezy
and have little experience beyond Ubuntu. I feel great that I am now
using a real distro without the Ubuntu training wheels.

2) I spend a lot of time in Scribus, a major application in my life.
The Scribus developers mince few words in expressing their dislike of
Ubuntu. Apparently the Ubuntu people do things to Qt, which Scribus
depends on. This causes a great number of bug reports that they cannot
do anything about. Reading the Scribus e-list you finally conclude that
the three most respected distros by the Scribus developers are Fedora,
Debian, and OpenSuse. I loves me my Synaptic, so Debian is the #1
option.

I still have a few issues to resolve:

1) I installed VLC 1.0.2 Goldeneye from the repos, but the display is
scrunched up to the left 1/4 of the window. Someone else on the
debian-user list reported the same problem, but no one can do much at
the moment because the VideoLan wiki and forums are offline. They took
them offline deliberately because of the high volume after releasing
version 1.0. Luckily I don't need VLC often.

2) Can't figure out how to install Xara Extreme. I found the
instructions on the Xara website, but I didn't understand them and I'm
sure I never went through all that stuff when I installed it on Ubuntu.
Again, luckily, I rarely use it.

3) Thanks to a message from a power user on the CUPS e-list I migrated
all my printer drivers with a few mouse clicks. But I haven't tested
them yet.

4) I have no wireless at home, so I need to go someplace to test the
wireless. The installer found it and offered to set it up as the
primary network interface, but I told it to use eth0 instead. And now
ifconfig doesn't even report the existence of the wireless.

5) Most important - I still haven't figured out how to get my bluetooth
mouse working. I think the problem is in Debian because several of the
buttons in the GUI do nothing at all. Like click on Setup New Device
and nothing happens. I can find it from the command line with hcitool,
but the connect command fails to connect it, even though the command
executes without error.

In spite of the issues, I'm pretty happy with Debian testing.

Let me be the first to say I'm proud of you John. It takes guts to remove
the training wheels, you might get a few scraped knees along the way but
they will heal :-)

Did you download the auto package file or the tar.bz2 file? If you
downloaded the tar file, tar -jxvf will untar it and you can cd into the
directory and execute bin/xaraxl to run it. I'm sure you can create a
launcher for this task as well.

Maybe it's disabled somehow, does /sbin/lsmod show the module for your
wireless card loaded? Maybe it didn't load it since you told the config tool
you wanted eth0 to be primary. Loading should force it to show up in
ifconfig

For whatever reason I rarely use VLC, but when I do, I use the
packages from here:
  http://www.debian-multimedia.org/

If you want all of his multimedia packages, just add the appropriate
line to your /etc/apt/sources.list and add his keyring package to
authenticate the package signatures going forward.

While I can't guarantee you these packages won't be without problems,
I generally find these a lot better than those that come from Debian
(since they aren't nerfed due to rediculous DRM and patent
restrictions).  That and they're a lot easier to keep updated than
having to build everything yourself.

I assume you're typing 'ifconfig -a' ?

I already had the multimedia repo, and that is where I got VLC from.
This morning Update Manager told me there were 36 upgrades available,
and I noted that three of them related to VLC. I installed the
upgrades, but VLC is still broken. I think I'll just have to wait until
the VideoLan wiki and forums come back.

Of course not. :(  Amazingly, when I typed ifconfig -a I got a list
that included wlan0. So it's there after all. Probably all I have to do
is be somewhere where there is wireless. In fact, from past experience,
there are a couple of neighbors' wireless networks visible here. They
just don't appear when I am connected to my home ethernet. 

I never knew the -a switch for the ifconfig command. I swear that just
"ifconfig" used to show wlan0 back when I had Ubuntu.

Just now I downloaded the tar.bz2 file and untarred it to
~/Software/Xara/. From within the ~/Software/Xara/xaralx/bin folder ls
says the xaralx file is there, but the command "xaralx" says there is
no such command. Double clicking on it from Nautilus nothing happened
at first, but then I discovered that I did not have permission to
execute the file. After giving myself (and everyone else) permission to
execute it via the Nautilus Properties dialog box, double clicking on
it launches the splash screen, but that's as far as it gets. From the
command line I still get "no such command." Nautilus describes xaralx
as an executable file, but I'm not always convinced that Nautilus knows
what it's talking about. From the command line its attributes are
-rwxrwxrwx 1. I think that means that it is readable, writable, and
executable by me, by anyone in my group, and by root. But I'm far from
an expert on chmod.

I have two of them, and I can't get either one to work. When I turn
them on a popup appears under the bluetooth icon in the gnome panel
asking if I want to give it permission. But the only button on the
popup is "OK," and clicking on it just makes the popup disappear. The
mouse still does not work. From the command line "hcitool scan" finds
whatever mouse(s) are turned on, but "hcitool cc <address>" just
executes without error and without actually connecting the mouse.

I think bluetooth in testing is seriously broken. The same thing
happened when I installed testing the first time a month ago. At that
time I installed Blueman, an alternative bluetooth manager. After
installing it I was able to get the bluetooth mouse working, but after
doing so I lost my window manager. I was never able to get the window
manager working again. I'm not going near Blueman this time around. :(

If I click on the bluetooth icon in the Gnome panel and then on Setup
New Device a window is supposed to pop up with Forward/Back buttons to
step you through finding the device and pairing it. But when I click on
Setup New Device nothing happens. I suspect there is a missing package,
but it seems strange that no one else on the Debian user list seems to
have a problem with bluetooth.

By default, ifconfig returns just the interfaces that are "up".  So if
your wlan or additional ethernet cards are not in use, they won't show
up unless you specify '-a'.  The man page for ifconfig, as with most
command line utilities, is an excellent resource.

In my experienece, Bluetooth in Debian (the "unstable" branch, at
least) works just fine.  It's the GUI tools that are really lousy,
when they're available at all.

I gave up on trying to figure out why there appears to be no common
way for a dialog box to pop up and ask you for a PIN. Just write the
PIN the device wants to see to the appropriate file in
/var/lib/bluetooth. For each bluetooth radio connected to your PC
(there's probably only one), there will be a corresponding directory
in /var/lib/bluetooth, named with the address of the device, e.g.:

# ll /var/lib/bluetooth/
total 4.0K
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Dec 26  2008 01:02:03:0A:0B:0C/

Inside that directory, there may or may not be a file named
"pincodes". It's easy enough to create. On each line, there should be
the Bluetooth address of the remote device you wish to pair with,
followed by whitespace, and then the PIN code you want your PC to send
to it, e.g.:

# cat /var/lib/bluetooth/01\:02\:03\:0A\:0B\:0C/pincodes 
01:23:45:AB:CD:EF 0000

The next time you initiate a connection to the remove device, if it
demands a PIN from your PC, the PIN you specify in that file will get
sent. This accomplishes the same thing as having a dialog box pop up
asking you to type the PIN in yourself.

It's saying no command found because Sofware/Xara is not in your path. You
have to ./$command to get it to launch properly from the bin directory.

Oh! Duh!

OK, now I know what the problem is. Running ./xaralx tries to launch
it, but spews a page of "wrong elf class" errors, then aborts. I know
that error - xaralx is a 32-bit app and I have 64-bit Linux.

Still, I had it running on 64-bit Ubuntu, so there must be a way. I
can't remember how I did it.

You can either build the source to create a 64-bit binary, find a
64-bit compiled version someone else has built, or follow the
instructions here:

http://www.xaraxtreme.org/download.html

(near the bottom, under: "Tar Archive Installation Instructions on
Linux AMD64" )

Honestly, building it your self looks like the least risky.

Source code and build instructions are here:

Subject: [PLUG] Now I've done it
Message-ID: <20091122172418.7053be4b.johnxj@comcast.net>

So I decided to reboot my new Debian testing installation after two
days of tweaking stuff and installing applications. Sure enough,
testing did it to me again. No window manager, no gnome-panel, just a
blank screen.

I can boot into recovery mode, but startx just gives me the same blank
screen. I did read through dmesg, but I didn't see anything obvious. I
saved the output of dmesg to ~/dmesg_11_22_2009. From recovery mode I
can become root, and then startx gives me a full window with window
manager and gnome-panel - but the mouse and keyboard are dead and I get
a popup warning me "failed to initialize HAL." If I startx as jjj I get
a window without metacity or gnome panel, but the USB mouse and
keyboard work. Great choices, eh?

Last time this happened right after installing Blueman. But this time I
did not install Blueman, so it must be something else that has messed
up the desktop. It could be any of hundreds of things. What am I
supposed to do, reboot after every little change to make sure the
change did not mess up the desktop? Is testing really this flakey?

Last time I was able to right-click on the desktop and create a
launcher to start a terminal. But this time right-clicking on the
desktop does nothing. 

I am sending this from mydesktop computer. I thought I could get into
my mail program by booting to a Karmic live CD on the laptop. The live
CD mounted the testing drive all right. And it let me transfer the Mail
folder to the live CD. But it won't let me transfer the ~/.sylpheed-2.0
file that has my mail accounts in it, not even from the command line as
root. Strange that the live CD lets me read the mail folder but not the
configuration file. What kind of security is that? Of course, I could
also replace the new hard drive with the old Jaunty drive and boot to
Jaunty. 

So here I sit all bummed.

Since no experts have chimed in.  I don't know the answer to your question,
but I had a hell of a time getting microphone going in Ubuntu last summer
with the Intel motherboard integrated sound: here are some links that helped
me.

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HdaIntelSoundHowto
https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ekiga/+question/7586

As I recall, I had to get the microphone going in an old Soundblaster card,
and by then I had figured out enough to get the motherboard sound going.  If
memory serves one key was finding the right combination of switches on the
big "Volume Control".

HTH; Good luck -- Patrick Timlick

John,

How about renameing /etc/X11/xorg.conf and rebooting.
That way, if it is the settings in that file, you can get back to square
one.
Blank screen = square 0.
You can then try making copies of xorg.conf with sections taken out to try
and find the problem.

Subject: [PLUG] Now I've done it

So I decided to reboot my new Debian testing installation after two days of
tweaking stuff and installing applications. Sure enough, testing did it to
me again. No window manager, no gnome-panel, just a blank screen.

I can boot into recovery mode, but startx just gives me the same blank
screen. I did read through dmesg, but I didn't see anything obvious. I saved
the output of dmesg to ~/dmesg_11_22_2009. From recovery mode I can become
root, and then startx gives me a full window with window manager and
gnome-panel - but the mouse and keyboard are dead and I get a popup warning
me "failed to initialize HAL." If I startx as jjj I get a window without
metacity or gnome panel, but the USB mouse and keyboard work. Great choices,
eh?

Last time this happened right after installing Blueman. But this time I did
not install Blueman, so it must be something else that has messed up the
desktop. It could be any of hundreds of things. What am I supposed to do,
reboot after every little change to make sure the change did not mess up the
desktop? Is testing really this flakey?

Last time I was able to right-click on the desktop and create a launcher to
start a terminal. But this time right-clicking on the desktop does nothing. 

I am sending this from mydesktop computer. I thought I could get into my
mail program by booting to a Karmic live CD on the laptop. The live CD
mounted the testing drive all right. And it let me transfer the Mail folder
to the live CD. But it won't let me transfer the ~/.sylpheed-2.0 file that
has my mail accounts in it, not even from the command line as root. Strange
that the live CD lets me read the mail folder but not the configuration
file. What kind of security is that? Of course, I could also replace the new

Great idea.

However, the Debian testing developers must be far and away above
ordinary operating system developers. Apparently they don't need an
xorg.conf file at all.

This *really* sounds like something related to gnome-session is not working.

I'm assuming that (1) you were logging in via a graphical log-in
manager, rather than at a console and then running startx.

Since startx doesn't give you a window manager, but doesn't cause
(obvious) errors, you can probably start debugging things by just
creating an ~/.xinitrc file with different commands to run when X
starts (via startx).

First off, I'd put this in your ~/.xinitrc: (and nothing else -- if
you *have* a ~/.xinitrc already, please let us know what's in there.)

exec gnome-session

I suspect that that will get you back to about the same place root is
at now--in any case it will help figure out what's going on.

You can also specify different window managers / desktop managers in
the same way (replace 'gnome-session' with the respective command for
whatever WM you want to run, eg: start-kde)

You may want to install xfce4, just so you have another full-featured
WM to test with.  If you want to, specify:

exec xfce4-session

in your ~/.xinitrc after installing xcfe4 ('sudo apt-get install
xfce4' at a terminal should do it)

This *does not* sound like a problem with X -- X is running, so I
don't suggest tweaking your X config.

X Org no longer requires an xorg.conf by default. Perhaps investigating
/var/log/Xorg.log or similar might yield some clues. Also backtracking what
you last did before it stopped working. Did you copy files over from your
Ubuntu install before rebooting? If so, what did you copy over?

Thanks for the suggestions. I'm still not functional, but I did things
and stuff happened.

First, still booted into the Karmic live CD I created an ~/.xinitrc
file (none existed before) and put "exec gnome-session" in it. Then I
rebooted to the regular boot option in Grub. Result: No change; that
is, mouse and keyboard worked, but no window manager and no gnome-panel.

Next I booted to Recovery Mode and logged in as root. I installed
xfce4, then edited jjj's .xinitrc file by changing the line to "exec
xfce4-session." Then I switched user to jjj and did cd to my home
folder. And then I did startx. Result: When X came up I had panels and
a desktop, but no mouse or keyboard. There was a popup message "failed
to initialize HAL."

For my third exercise I shut down (had to use the power button) then
restarted to the regular session. After logging in as jjj I got the
same blank Gnome desktop without a panel or window manager.

Not sure what this means.

Major progress!

I booted to the regular session and, at the login prompt, selected XFCE
session. After logging in XFCE came up *with mouse and keyboard*. I am
functional again!

Now I have a terminal in X, so hopefully I can fix Gnome.

Although since the keyboard and mouse work some of the time, I don't
think your HAL policy is at fault.

The description of your latest steps (above) does not mention removing
the xorg.conf file. Have you tried that?

I agree that Xorg.0.log is a great place to look. It's too big to post
here, but you could either post it on one of those tinyurl sites, or
email it to me and I'll put it up on my web server. It's a great log
file because it reports everything that happens when X starts, not
just those things that are "errors".

No such file. I do have a /etc/hal/fdi/policy/preferences.fdi file, but
it looks like a template with nothing real in it.

I read through the log file, but it appeared to be just a bunch of
stuff related to setting up X for my nVidia chip. There was nothing in
it that appeared obviously wrong. 

I think Rogan is on the right track. But figuring out the details and
how to fix it is beyond my job description. :(

At least I am back in my testing installation and I can work on things
properly. :)

You can run as root X -configure from the command line while at level 3
(won't work while you're in X itself), in a shell you can type "telinit 3"
and if it auto drop you to a shell, ctrl+alt+backspace to get you there
without fear of X trying to restart until you're done generating a config.
It will generate an Xorg.conf file which you can then place in /etc/X11 ...
perhaps Gnome is trying to initialize your bluetooth devices in some way
that is causing it to barf. I wish had the gear to be able to work along
with you to see if I can cause the same reproduceable failure.

It's cool, we have established that gnome, not X or HAL, is your
problem. I'd be inclined to say that you should stick with xfce4 and
call it a done deal, but I don't want to box you in. Linux is all
about choices.

Sorry I can't help with gnome. I use xfce4 when I need a full-on
window manager, and stumpwm 99.99% of the time.

A quick hack - see if something shows up on an external monitor.  I
would give that a 10% chance of working, but if it does, you are
closer to finding a fix.

Laptop video drivers are "special", and one of the last things to
get fixed in a new release, so yes, they can be flakey.  They are
depending on people like you to test them and fix them before the
release.  Fortunately, there is always the option of booting off a
live CD and making copies of the various X files, folding them in
from backups, etc.  Tricky but possible.  That is why testers are
such stud muffins.

My first rule of computers is that anything I do not have two
copies of, I will someday have zero copies of.  Hence, before I do
anything as radical as updating distros, I (1) make a backup, and
(2) make a drive image to an identical drive ( second drive bays
on thinkpads.  Yay!). This has bitten me once - the thrashing
caused by copying my primary drive (using ddrescue) caused it to
fail.  But I was able to rebuild from backups.

Hard drives are so damned cheap these days that I always buy two.
Since laptops almost always come with an OEM special-part-number
drive with Windoze on it, I run it just long enough to see the 
splash screen, then replace the drive with a different new drive
for installing my Linux distro.  I then put the original drive
in an antistatic bag, and store it for future reverse engineering
(after Microsoft gets hit by an asteroid).  Once I have it set up
(and this can take hours) I make a drive copy.  I make another
copy after a week or two of finishing tweaks.

But you didn't do that, and now you got troubles.  I don't use
the newest versions of X, but I can often learn a lot by looking
at /var/log/X.org.0.log with a live CD.  Yes, it is vast heaps
of gobbletygook, but the error messages are sometimes obvious.

You have a SATA drive in your laptop, IIRC.  If even a live CD
won't work, another option is to get something like a Vantec
Nextar drive dock ("toaster"), and connect that to your desktop
(USB or eSATA) and look at the drive that way.  I use the drive
toaster to hold my (swappable) backup drive.  Again, the purpose
of this exercise is to see what X did or did not do.  

And when you get it working again, make backups!  Then you will
have a copy of a working X.org.0.log file, and you can look for
differences the next time you get stung.

No, not a problem. You missed a detail of my current saga. My Ubuntu
Jaunty hard drive was replaced with a brand new hard drive to install
Debian on. The old Jaunty hard drive is untouched. I can reinstall it
in the computer and in a few moments I am back in Jaunty-land. Yes, I
have possibly "lost" a couple days work installing Debian, assuming I
end up having to reinstall. But this saga is a learning experience for
me. The time spent was no more lost than the time spent taking a
linguistics course. I learn by the "clicky clicky, oh damn, clicky
clicky, whew!, clicky clicky, oh damn, clicky clicky, whew!" method
(tm).

A live CD would probably work. I used a Karmic live CD and it wouldn't
let me copy some files. But that's the only live CD I tried. I have
Knoppix, Slax, and several rescue CDs in my library. I just didn't need
to go further because Rogan's suggestions got me up and running with
XFCE. Now I can fiddle with things in a full X environment. I'm
currently googling on the problem to see if I can find out what went
wrong and why, and how to fix it.

I'm glad XFCE got you going again -- and that we've narrowed it down
to *something* gnome is doing -- the HAL issue is probably the best
lead so far.

I don't use gnome directly (I got tired of things like obscure HAL
errors, keyboard problems, etc.... ;), so I can't help a *lot* but you
can still try invoking little bits of gnome on your one, individually,
to try and narrow this down further.

I'd suggest searching for the HAL issue first, though.  Someone else
may have done the legwork for you.

If that fails, try running some smaller chunks of gnome from a
terminal (either in xfce, or from a terminal in X with no WM
running... whatever you want.

Here are a few gnome-ish "programs" you can fire off:

   * gnome-panel: handles the taskbars / button bars.  If running
xfce, these will probably show up  infront or behind the xfce
taskbar/button bars.
   * gnome-power-manager: This *might* be running already -- in fact,
while running xfce, you may want to check the running processes ('ps
-ef' at a terminal) and see what gnome-ish stuff is going.  Those
aspects of gnome are probably just fine.
   * gnome-settings-daemon: handles all the gnome settings (go figure
:).  I'd guess this is where you'll see the HAL issue crop up again,
and you may very well loose mouse / keyboard control when you start it
if that's the case.
   * metacity (I think....): The gnome window manager.  This will
probably not work while xfce is running, so you may need to log in via
a terminal, set your .xinitrc to either 'exec metacity' or 'exec
xterm' (or whatever term you want) and then run metacity from that
terminal when X starts with no window manager.  If you start up with
'exec metacity' you will probably get a greyish screen with nothing on
it--try clicking around.  (That may also not do anything--I haven't
used metacity in ages, so, starting a terminal from your xinitrc may
be the better option.  You can also launch a terminal in xinitrc,
*then* start metacity:

xterm & # start a terminal, and background it ( with the &)
exec metacity  # launch metacity.

Anyway, if you can't find info on the HAL error, the idea is to figure
out what part of gnome is failing.

There are bug reports for Evolution showing the same problem you describe.
Probably they have been fixed and all you need to do is upgrade to a newer
version of Evolution, or go back to an older version.

I have a file /usr/lib/evolution/2.26/killev which fixes this problem
when evolution gets into the demanding state.  My son the expert put
me on to it.  I am running 2.26.1 under ubuntu.

   To close this thread.

   Careful testing with Drew's help (and external Linksys wireless radio)
revealed that the radio is sufficiently powerful (100mW), but works only
within line-of-sight of the AP. The most logical explanation is that the
driver for the card is less than optimal.

   I ordered an Intel Pro 3945 A/B/G mini pci-e card to replace the original
one. The driver is in all kernels since 2.6.24. This model may be nearing
its EOL, but it will certainly do for my wife's needs with the Satellite.
Replacing the card is also a more efficient solution than buying (and
manipulating) an external, USB radio.

Message-ID: <1259043839.3997.4.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I am running Slackware 10.1 and a 2.6.10 kernel.

I'm trying to compile the source for 2.6.27, though I wonder if this
kernel will work on this version of Slackware???

I think I left out transparent proxy support on the existing kernel.
Is there a way to check?

For some reason, it looks like dansguardian is running and it looks
like squid is running on this machine, but every attempt I make to
redirect tcp 80 traffic fails.

I am having a heck of a time understanding all the options in 2.6.27 
and I have not found the NFS root option yet.

Is there a slick way to install a newer version of slackware to my nfs

dropping in a hard drive, taking it out, transferring the file system
to the server, etcetera...  It would be nice if the old version of
slackware could upgrade itself.

Yes Slackware will run it. grep for PROXY in the kernel source .config of
the existing kernel.

You'll need to do incrementally because 10.1 is too old. You might be able
to jump to 11.1(2) and then a couple jumps at a time. You can't go from 10.1
to 13 directly. You can read the UPGRADE.txt file with the distro to see
what versions are supported from upgrading to/from.

For about a week now I've noticed a massive drop in the amount of spam
myself and my users have been getting. I remember around this time last
year an ISP was de-peered which was responsible for a large portion of
spam email, but searching through Google News I'm not seeing any similar
reports this time.

Just out of curiosity, is anyone else noticing this?

I have been getting more spam, and more of it is getting past my
filters. I lowered my spamassassin threshold to 2.0 (from 3.0). It
seems like spammers are getting better at writing spam emails that
don't rack up the huge scores.

This graph http://www.spamcop.net/spamgraph.shtml?spamyear would 'seem
to suggest' that spam levels are up some from last year.  I notice
there's a bit of a up-tick around the time Windows 7 was released. Could
just be a coincidence.

Ah, I see. Most likely then I've been hit by one particular source of 
spam that has subsided. I know a friend of mine who uses Verizon as his 
ISP can no longer use third party SMTP servers via port 25 anymore. It's 
possibly related to something along those lines.

In any case, I'll take it! :)

Great!  Why don't we just turn the Internet into a push-only service.
Wouldn't it be great if it just fed us the information others wanted
us to see without us having any choice in the matter?


Sorry for the snide remarks, they're not really directed at you, just
at the general mentality that we have to give up something as
consumers in order to cut down on spam.  SMTP needs to be redesigned.
It is within our power to do this.  If we don't, Big Content will just
turn the Internet into what they understand best: a fancy TV.

Isn't Verizon doing just what you're advocating? Like most modern ISPs
they replaced the use of SMTP with authenticated submissions on port
587.

A quick correction - I mean they removed the use of the standard SMTP
port, port 25. Port 587 still uses the SMTP protocol.

You mean you must still route your mail through their servers?  Then
no, that's not what I'm advocating.  Restricting senders at the ISP
level is not a solution, it is the problem.  Please correct me if I
don't understand what you're referring to in relation to port 587.

The primary problem with SMTP is that it is designed to accept mail
from anonymous users (a requirement) *and* it places the chief
resource usage on the receiver.  Receiving servers need to store the
mail.

One approach to turning the tables on this game is to make senders
store mail until receivers choose to accept it:

  http://cr.yp.to/im2000.html

This of course would make many of the current methods used by spammers
more difficult (infected PCs) and would give RBLs a head start on
spam.

I'm not saying this is the solution, but it is a good start at a
conversation on fixing mail.

tim,

   This is the 'pull' model used by Usenet, Web-based fora, and the like.
Many of us don't like that model at all. We perfer the 'push' model that
puts messages in our inbox (or other files based on procmail rules) and we
don't have to go look for it.

   Filters at the MTA level and tools like SpamAssassin help extensively.
But, as long as there are M$ OSes vulnerable to exploitation, and effective
exploits, there will be spam. Like the wars on poverty, drugs, and terrorism
spam will be with us forever and we need patience and tools that limit the
annoyance and damage. Thinking of getting rid of spam is right up there with
envisioning whirled peas.

Just FYI to anyone who has upgraded to Ubuntu Karmic and had new 
problems with suspend to RAM - yesterday's updates from Ubuntu include 
some changes which are reportedly fixing this problem for a number of 
users.

A friend of mine with a Dell Inspiron 1501 had this problem and as of 
yesterday's update it is resolved. I personally run a Dell Latitude D620 
and have been lucky enough to have suspend working from day one.

Yes, but the MTA can do the pull for you.  It doesn't have to accept
the full body of messages immediately though, until it has the time to
deal with it, space to handle it, or has a chance to check a
sufficient number of RBLs, etc.  If the infected PC that sent out
10,000 spam messages is taken off line after the first hour, then your
mail server can ignore the messages later (when it can't retrieve
them) and never bother you with it at the POP/IMAP level.

I'm not saying a change will stop spam.  There will always be spam,
but currently we have to spend way more money on each message to stop
it than the senders do to send it.

I'm actually much happier living with spam (because I know how to deal
with it) than I am with Verizon and Comcast shutting down my port 25.
But since there is a spam problem generally that costs a lot of
companies a lot of money, they can use this as an excuse to censor our
outbound traffic, one port at a time.

Verizon isn't restricting users unreasonably. Verizon is requiring
authentication for to relay outgoing mail, which most people would
consider a fairly reasonable thing to do.

I do think IM2000 is interesting, but that replacing the current email
system with it or something else is actually a much bigger problem
than the technical design of such a system.

These sort of internet conversations often wind up with somebody
pasting the cynical form describing why so and so's proposal for
fighting spam or change to our email architecture will fail. It has an
uncanny truth to it.

Ever tried running your own mail server?  Been doing it from years at
home.  Works great if my ISP doesn't get in the way.  I find relaying
through an ISPs mail server invariably creates serious delays and
problems.  This is asside from the fact that now I can't encrypt my
mail to trusted mail servers via things like STARTTLS.

Will Verizon next decide to protect the rest of the Internet from me
by checking to see if my mail looks like spam?  Perhaps start
collecting email addresses I send to so they can sell them to
"legitimate" marketing lists?  Seems far fetched, but what's to stop
them?

>From Verizon's point of view, it may very well make sense, but maybe
the bigger problem is the lack of options for users.  You can't use
alternative ISPs with FIOS and Cable.  Slow Qwest DSL or colo is all
that's left.  It's becoming an increasingly restricted market place.

"It's hard, so we shouldn't try."  Is that a fair summary?  If one
could reduce the volume of spam by an order of magnitude, would that
not be worth it?

Oh but think of all of those poor spam filtering companies that would
be out of work...

Speaking of which - the TuxOnIce kernel package for Karmic makes
suspend-to-disk work nicely on my IBM Thinkpad X32 (which usually has
problems with S-T-D).

Karmic has "PPA" URLs for adding extra package archives, so you can just
add: ppa:tuxonice/ppa

Can't wait for them to get compressed suspend working,

Verizon is not blocking outgoing port 25 to protect you or to control
you, they're blocking outgoing port 25 because of the abuse it exposes
them to. It obviously has no direct benefit to the end user, but it
does remove a common source of spam. This should lead to a net
reduction in spam.

I've run lots of mail servers, web servers, and all sorts of other fun
servers. I don't run them on my consumer internet service. I also
don't think Verizon has an obligation to enable you to do that. This
is not Verizon attacking your freedom or privacy, this is  Verizon
protecting their profits. They will sell you a business grade service
that lets you run all this stuff, have a static IP, QoS, whatever else
you want.

I'm not saying we shouldn't fix the system, I'm just saying it's a lot
more work than you might realize. There is no crazy spam filter
conspiracy. It's a massive problem that people and companies have
spent a decade and millions of dollars to try and fix.

FWIW I never did state it explicitly, but yes, that's what happened in
my friend's case - he could continue to use third-party SMTP servers via
port 587, and in fact could continue to use them on any port other than 25.

Normally I would encourage people who disagree with policies like this
to stop doing business with these ISPs, but that is only really possible
in areas where there are competing broadband services that offer a real
choice. Back in New Hampshire (where I'm originally from), there was
always only one cable internet monopoly, and most residences were too
far from their phone switch to get DSL.

Right.  Cutting off my nose in spite of their face.  er...

I don't disagree with you that there isn't an inherent right to
provide whatever service you feel like.  However, the reality is,
there really is little choice in Internet service for a reasonable
cost.

Why not?  Why shouldn't you be able to?

Suppose I want to get consumer TV service from Verizon or Comcast as
well as Business Internet.  Have you looked at what that costs?  It's
absurd.  You have to lease two separate lines.

Yeah, sure, it's just two providers we're talking about, but that's
almost the only game in town.  It's not some feature that is a luxury
for me, it's something I've used for years and now it's being taken
away one ISP at a time.  Having every user being able to share
information is what makes the Internet the Internet, IMHO.

Give me real competition in the market for consumer Internet service,
and I'll shut up.

Actually, I'll shut up now, for everyone else's benefit, since I doubt
I'll convince you.

Oh, I realize it's a lot of work to fix SMTP and get it adopted.  But
if you look at the crazy amount of effort people are putting into:

  restricting users' ability to communicate
  running realtime blacklists
  gobs of machine learning (bayesian filters, et al)
  maintaining PKI for DKIM and the like
  pushing new DNS standards like SPF
  etc...

It sure seems like it would be a better long term solution to deploy a
protocol that puts much of this work on the sender.

The consumer/producer dichotomy is one that "producers" have foisted
on us.  We could/should all be producers.  That we find we can't be is
an indication that something is wrong.

I agree that this dichotomy can be abused for profit.

But - running flaky internet service without features ("consumer"
grade) is cheaper than running high quality service with all that it
generally implies (greater upstream bandwidth, static IPs, some notion
of service uptime requirements, etc).

Most internet subscribers are interested in the lower price, despite
the lower quality service it comes with.

Heath,

   I don't know whether my service (Aracnet/SpiritOne) is considered consumer
grade or business grade. I have a static IP address, run my own mail server
(and could run ftp or http servers if I was so inclined), have 24/7/365
uptime, and an outstanding group of tech supporters (who know linux) and a
super admin.

   I've been their customer for about a decade now and find they provide all
that I need or want. Well, ... higher download speeds would be nice on a few
occasions, but not enough to be worth the extra cost.

   Regardless of where they fall on this spectrum, they serve my business
well.

Rich

Most internet subscribers aren't even aware of the issue.  They've
been conditioned over decades to think of themselves strictly as
consumers.  It's up to people who better understand the issue to help
educate them.

The above is a script that I use to switch the default gw on
a backside router Dodo.

D ---- W

I have Dodo, D, connected to Web, W, and Xerxes, X.

G, goose, is connected to Dodo via 192.168.4.0/28 network. (not shown)

Web is in the 192.168.3.16/28 network.

Xerxes is in the 192.168.3.0/24 network.

Web, Goose, and Xerxes are also in the 192.168.1.0/24 network.

Traditionally, if web and xerxes were on the same subnet,
I might use a virtual IP address and route to it.  
I need to route from dodo based on the source the
packet stream came from.  When the gateway from the other
end is web, I can route to web from dodo and that will usually
be correct.  It won't be correct to route packets to web if I 
try to run horde on xerxes though.

The correct route can't be determined until I know which machine,
web or xerxes, is trying to go through dodo.  Yikes, how do I go
about figuring this out and untangling this ugly mess?  I literally
need to change the route to get to the 192.168.1.0/24 network from 
dodo on the fly.  I haven't even talked about tracking gateway 
outages on web and xerxes.  The above script has a sister script
that switches to the other router and I run these scripts via cron,
but that isn't a very robust approach.

I think I need to have 2 routing tables, the original one and a second
one, with the 2 routes to reach 192.168.1.0/24.  I then need to MARK
packet streams going through dodo based on which server by MAC address
the packets originate from.

Wow, I've been a Network Engineer for many years and that's some kind of 
routing monkey knot you have there.

 >> "I literally need to change the route to get to the 192.168.1.0/24 
network from dodo on the fly"

The only time a route should change on the fly is if you're running a 
dynamic routing protocol such as RIP, OSPF and there's a failure or 
other mechanism such as bandwith or delay that triggers a routing 
topology change.

I can't be of much assistance with the info you've provided. Can you 
provide a complete network topology? Show how each network is connected, 
which hosts are in which networks. and which interfaces on the hosts has 
a leg into which network?

Message-ID: <20091126003923.4100c23f.johnxj@comcast.net>

I really gave it a good try, but it doesn't work for me.

Why?

Testing is just too buggy for my taste. And Lenny is far too old. 

I never could fix the problems in Gnome that developed. At one point I
completely deleted all config files relating to Gnome, Nautilus and
gtk, letting them be recreated when I logged in again. And I still had
no window manager or gnome-panel. I also spent almost an entire day
trying dozens of other remedies suggested here and on the debian-users
and gnome e-lists. No joy. The same thing happened a month ago when I
tried testing the first time. To sleuth down where the problem lies
would take ages. I'd have to keep written logs of every configuration
change and appllcation install, and reboot after every dozen or so
until it breaks.

That is not all that is messed up. I have spent hours trying to get
Debian to enable my bluetooth mouse, but to no avail. I tried a live CD
of Lenny and couldn't get it working there either. But with a live CD
of Karmic it took 60 seconds to get it working.

Nautilus crashes if you click on Preferences. 

Update Manager is also messed up in Squeeze. It continually displays an
icon saying there is one update available. But when I launch Update
Manager it says the computer is completely up to date. Aptitude also
says it is up to date. And you can't get rid of the icon unless you
delete the notification area.

I may try Fedora for a few days, but I'm probably going to end up back
with Ubuntu. But if I do it will be because I like it, not because I
need its training wheels.

I've never run Debian Testing. But I did come across what I think is a 
great lil' distro called 'Sidux', "Debian Hot and Spicy". It's based on 
Debian Sid (unstable). Which if you know anything about Debian, just 
means it works but they haven't tested the hell out of it.

I've been running it for about a year now. I think they're on a 6 month 
release cycle. You can test it out w. a LiveCD. I do run into problems 
now and then, but I've learned a lot working through them. The Sidux 
community is extremely knowledgeable and very helpful.

Here's a thread on getting a Logitech bluetooth mouse working on a Dell 
820 laptop:
http://sidux.com/PNphpBB2-viewtopic-t-8393.html

The main reasons I don't run Ubuntu:
I find it sluggish compared to Debian.
The video driver seems to lose its marbles when I close the lid on my 
Thinkpad T60.
I can't get get access to and run all Debian software.
I support Debian's quirky fight to be Free and Open. Even if Iceweasal 
and Icedove are super cheesey names...

If Sidux ever charged money for their distro, I would be a loyal 
customer to the bitter end.

Thanks. I'm downloading the live DVD and I'll take it for a spin.

I have always used Gnome, so maybe this is a good time for me to become
more familiar with KDE.

If I find testing to be too buggy, wouldn't unstable be even worse?

I've been using Debian unstable on my desktop and laptop systems for
years, and I've never had any of the issues that you encountered. (I
rarely have any problems at all.) It's been far too long since I've
used testing to have anything useful to say about it now, but I do
recall it being difficult. Note that "stable" and "unstable" refer to
the state of the package tree, not the quality of the software (e.g.,
"unstable" changes a lot).

Not necessarily. Unstable is where they fix problems they found in testing.
It's unstable because they don't yet know what new problems were created by
fixing the previous ones.

OK, I'll try it out. Too bad there's no live CD for anything but Lenny. 

I spent this morning trying the live CD of Sidux. I'm sorry, I could
never love KDE. Xfce is not so bad, but I really want my Gnome. And it
can't connect to my bluetooth mouse either. And no Synaptic. What's up
with removing Synaptic? Debian without Synaptic is like beer without
alcohol.

I haven't ever actually installed Fedora, nor have I tried even a live
CD since Fedora 9. I just downloaded the live CD of Fedora 12 and I'm
going to see what it's like before I do any more installing.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0911261552220.18644@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   There's a cd/dvd drive in the Toshiba Satellite. Inserting a movie dvd is
easy: press the button on the drawer and it opens. After that it gets rather
screwy.

   On the Applications->Multimedia menu is something called Movie Player.
When that is invoked it opens a large window, then displays a message box
that it's missing all requisite plug-ins (!). Strange. Doesn't tell me
what's missing nor do I understand why they'd be missing in a clean
installation.

   Thinking I could get past this I used the synaptic package manager to get
and install mplayer. However, when I try to play the disk in the drive I see
messages that there's something about the disk, or too many buffers are
loaded, and the mplayer window shows a psycadelic display of colored bars in
several vertical strips from the bottom of the window up. So I kill that
process and try to remove the disk by opening the drive door.

   At this point a serious message box pops up with text that the drive is
not recogzined by HAL and must have been installed by aliens or something.
Never have seen any such reaction before. Need to resort to the straightened
paper clip to open the drive and remove the disk.

   Does anyone have any ideas why both the software and the hardware are
acting as they are?

TIA,

Rich

Does the DVD have some advanced copy protection that could be 
interfering? Does it play on another computer? I use VLC for anything 
video related. I know people that swear by mplayer and that's fine, but 
it seems to take some extra tinkering that VLC doesn't.

Some thories, which may be dead wrong:

You cannot eject the DVD because you are not in the plugdev group, a
prerequisite for doing stuff with HAL-controlled hardware. Use the id
command to check this. Can you do an eject /dev/cdrom as root?

You cannot play the DVD with your software because libdvdcss isn't
installed, or isn't activated. Most distros require you to do
something manually to get the library running. This is so that they
won't have any legal liabilities.

Seconded, VLC rocks. Or use ogle, which is a nice, direct way to play
a DVD.

On a recent Ubuntu system, what you need to do for the above is

I also use Debian unstable on my desktops.  Sometimes you update and
something major breaks, but usually it's something you can work around
until it's fixed and another update comes along.

Yeah, I just don't use Gnome or KDE.  The keyboard is usually a much
faster way to interface with a computer than a mouse is.  Therefore my
X sessions are built around lots and lots of terminals.  No point in
dealing with buggy GUIs that just take up resources and screen real
estate.

After you get settled in to a distro/release, whatever it is, take
some time to go out and really shop for a window manager.  I try to do
this once every couple of years.  I currently use fluxbox, but I
haven't gone shopping in a while.  If you can find a window manager
that you like which doesn't have a crapload of Gnome and KDE
dependencies, you might just find that your systems are much more
stable and easier to maintain.  

Both of those projects are a mess of dependencies.

Aptitude is quite good.  You have to learn a few key strokes, but it
has all of the Synaptic features AFAIK.  It's also a lot easier to use
via SSH...

Ubuntu (all flavors) does not install non-free or proprietary software
by default. To play DVDs (and several other media types, e.g., mp3s),
you need to install the libraries and codecs. 

The normal way one does this in Ubuntu-land is to enable the medibuntu
repository. No, "medibuntu" has nothing to do with physicians. It is
short for "media-ubuntu." Don't ask. They should have consulted a
linguist. 

When you attempt to play a DVD in Totem ("Movie Player") it should pop
up a warning that it lacks the correct libraries. And then it should
offer to install the required libraries. 

At this point is where things sometimes go wrong. The problem is that
there are lots of different libraries needed to play DVDs, and Ubuntu
isn't always very clever at getting them all installed.

An alternative is to use VLC, which has its own built-in codecs and
stuff. I like Totem for its simplicity. But I use VLC when viewing a
video with subtitles because Totem sucks at finding the subtitles file. 

At a recent Clinic we had a user with the same problem. We tried
googling on what is required and then installing the necessary
packages. After failing for half an hour I suggested a simpler, albeit
non-professional way to solve the user's problem. You see, I knew that
Totem would play anything on my own laptop. So I fired up Synaptic and
then searched on various keywords. We had the user do the same, then
add anything that I had that he did not. In short order we had his
Totem up and running.

If you would like to do this, holler back and I'll give you a list of
packages that I have installed together with the keywords I used to
find them.

Subject: [PLUG] Grub fails. Grrrr.
Message-ID: <20091126184038.96958096.johnxj@comcast.net>

I just spent the past hour and a half installing Debian Unstable. I
used the minimal CD image, then Expert Mode.

When I got completely to the end it wanted to install the boot loader.
The first option was Grub 2. Although I am unfamiliar with Grub 2, I
decided to let it go ahead. And then it announced that grub-update had
failed.

I went back and told it to use Grub 1.5, but that failed also.

The next choice was LILO. I know nothing of LILO, but I figured I could
change it to Grub later. I answered all the questions and it appeared
to install without error.

When I rebooted I got a screen that says:

Gnu Grub version 1.97
[Minimal bash-like line editing is supported ... <more> }
grub >

My guess is that Grub 2 did install, but incompletely. Grub 1.5 failed
because it detected Grub 2.0 already installed. I installed LILO to
sda1, not sda, think that doing so would make it easier to install Grub
later. But LILO doesn't start if there is something in the MBR. That is
just my WAG.

As for why Grub failed initially, the hard disk had Squeeze installed
originally. Perhaps the reformatting failed to erase the MBR containing
parts of Grub pointing to Squeeze.

So I guess I get to wipe it out and spend another hour and a half
reinstalling. And when I finish Grub will fail again, and I'll have to
go to Fry's and buy a new hard disk.

I recently had an install of GRUB2 fail the same way. But I just
ignored it and rebooted and it actually started working. It's been
working ever since, so I really have no idea why, but you might try
rebooting a couple of times and see if it figures itself out.

Just a thought...

I tried rebooting half a dozen times, but could never get past the
error screen. From the grub> prompt if you just hit enter you get a
list of possible commands. None are useful. I mean, once I had to edit
a menu item in Grub and it was a snap. Once I had a bad grub install
and I got a list of commands including things like grub-update. But now
the list of commands is useless.

I could reinstall Unstable, but likely I'd end up at the same point.
Bah.

I tried the live CD of Fedora 12 this morning. It crashed with a kernel
panic after loading - although sometimes I could get it to run for half
an hour. But the interface is slick and it connected my bluetooth mouse
without a hiccup. So rather than reinstall Debian Unstable I'm going to
install Fedora 12. Maybe after installation I can do an update to fix
the kernel panics. If not, then maybe it's time to go back to Ubuntu.

I believe the PC BIOS looks at the MBR of the first disk, not the first
partition on the first disk. So you needed to install LILO or GRUB to
/dev/sda, not /dev/sda1.

Someone will correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the only time you
should install a bootloader onto a partition is if you're already using
a bootloader on the MBR that you want to preserve and that presumably
will be told about the bootloader on your partition(s).

Yes, that's called a chainloader. Windows actually installs a
chainloader into the MBR, and the "real" windows bootloader in the
first partition. That's why you can dual boot windows and linux by
installing GRUB in the MBR, and configuring a chainloader entry in
grub.conf for booting Windows.

Yeah, I tried quite a few commands on there and had no luck, either. I
was pleasantly surprised that it just started working.

That's the extent of my experience with grub2, though. Sorry.

>From the grub> prompt, you can enter the exact same sort of commands
that are found in the grub.conf file. This allows you to boot the box
"manually" in the event that the MBR wasn't installed correctly.

On my laptop, I would type the following commands at the grub prompt
to boot:

root (hd0,0)
kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.31.6 root=/dev/hda3
boot

I don't use an initrd image, otherwise I would have to include another
command:

initrd /initrd-2.6.31.6

Once the box is booted and running, or even from the same grub prompt
you get when you turn on the computer, you can run the following
commands to install the bootloader into the MBR:

root (hd0,0)
setup (hd0)

That's it!

That's where I went wrong. Well, actually, if Grub install hadn't
failed I'd never have put LILO on sda1.

At the moment the issue is moot. I'm kind of down on Debian right now.
have wiped out Debian Unstable and installed Fedora 12. First thing I
did was software update, and no kernel panics or crashes so far. I've
installed a couple of things, including Sylpheed. But now I better
reboot to make sure I haven't lost the window manager and gnome-panel
again. :(

Subject: [PLUG] xsane closes with errors
Message-ID: <4B0F5B22.2000403@verizon.net>

I recently changed distro's from ubuntu to arch a few weeks ago. It's 
worked pretty well for me except for one small problem I've been having 
with xsane. Whenever I try to launch it says it's detecting my scanner, 
then it just quits. Launching from CLI gives

(xsane:3713): Gtk-WARNING **: GtkSpinButton: setting an adjustment with 
non-zero page size is deprecated

Following the instructions listed on the wiki 
http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_Scanner_Support I have been able 
to successfully scan using scanimage from the CLI so I know my scanner 
works, has the correct permissions (I can scan without root) and all 
around works so I think the problem is just with xsane or maybe GTK. The 
version of sane and xsane I have installed are direct from pacman. I 
have tried deleting my ~/.sane folder with no change. If I try to launch 
xsane with the scanner off I get the message reporting "no devices 
available". I have even tried launching xsane as root with no difference 
except a message telling me I shouldn't run it as root. Any ideas on 
whats causing this and how I should resolve it?

Out of curiosity, did you make sure to format the non-data storage
partitions? If you didn't format partitions such as /, you will almost
surely end up with leftover programs and configuration files from the
previously installed GNU/Linux distribution messing up your new install.

Yeah, I think you're either a KDE or a GNOME person. I'm more of KDE guy. And I really like 
where KDE is going w. Plasma. When I first saw 4 on Lenny, it was half-baked and I wanted 3.5 back. But 4.3 is 
really nice. 

Synaptic and/or Aptitude don't come pre-installed because they can break things. If you want it, just 
apt-get install it. I like Synaptic for perusing the repos, but I prefer aptitude as it has gotten me
out of many a tight spot w. its pkg dependency solutions.

I'm a bit surprised Bluetooth didn't work. Sorry it didn't work for you! I'd glady spend my
days/nights checking out Linux distros than running Winduhs...:-)

I accidentally deleted the reply thread from Tim regarding Linux 
desktops (KDE/GNOME) and window managers. He mentioned Fluxbox.

My reply to Tim's thread:

I've tried a few different window managers including Fluxbox, 
Enlightenment, FVWM, Blackbox. I would love to break my addiction to KDE 
because it is a heavy gui w. a lot of dependencies. However, each time I 
try it always feel like something is missing or I get lost navigating in 
it and then go running back. LXDE wasn't a bad lightweight desktop if I 
recall.

Many a casual Linux user holds the belief that one of the big things 
that holds back greater adoption of Linux among the masses is the lack 
of a good desktop experience. It's one area of Linux that doesn't get a 
lot of developer love and attention.

I think it's what makes many devs & other tech people I know flock to 
MACs. The quintessential desktop experience...

Yes, as I mentioned I can actually scan from the terminal just fine with 
my user account. I have also tried logging in as root and running xsane 
but there was no difference.

I would ask in the Arch forum. there is probably a gui program that needs to
be installed, that would normally come with Ubuntu, but with Arch you always
have to add the pieces separately.

There were only two partitions, / and swap. When I installed Unstable I
told the installer to use the whole hard disk. It created and formatted
a new / and a new swap.

The old Grub was in the MBR, and the installer should have overwritten
it with the new Grub. During the install I had a choice of Grub 2, Grub
1.5 or LILO. I started with 2.0, and when I got the error message that
Grub had failed I used the back button to try 1.5. That failed also, so
I went back again and used LILO. But when I installed LILO I told it to
install it to sda1 instead of sda, thinking that doing so would make it
easier to fix later. That was a big mistake because it left me with a
messed up Grub 2 in the MBR. And, unlike Grub 1.5 that I am familiar
with, repairing a broken Grub 2 is challenging. The available commands
are useless and there is little on the net in the way of help or
documentation. I'm sure that will change in the future, but for now,
Grub 2 is just not ready.

It's really annoying when an install takes an hour and a half over the
net, and then screws up at the very end, leaving the user with an
unbootable system. 

I was so bummed at Debian and all the problems I have had with it that
last night I installed Fedora 12. As expected, package management sucks
compared to what I have been used to in Ubuntu. But otherwise it is
very nice and I have not had a single major problem so far. And I note
that it installed Grub 0.97, not even 1.5 that has been out for a long
time.

As I educate myself to the RPM way of doing things, I am hoping that
the package management suckage will diminish. Fedora 12 does come with
a nice GUI Add/Remove Packages utility, but it's not nearly as fully
featured as Synaptic. I need to figure out repositories; that is, I
assume there is a sources.list file somewhere, but I need to figure out
where there are other repositories and how to add them. That will be
today's educational adventure.

Message-ID: <f72d4c6a0911271138k7f15e10fw7e1ea14f187619e1@mail.gmail.com>

I see in a 2005 note that ntpdate is going away soon.  My ubuntu comes
with ntpdate and ntpdate-debian, and no ntpd.  That is fine with me.
( I guess "soon" is a relative term.)  I boot my only machine at least
daily (power saving).  I have no network.

I would like to synch. my clock on boot.  ntpdate is good for that.
My trouble is that I do not know how to specify an ntp server.  The
lists I see look like no internet addresses I am used to seeing.  For
example, the file /etc/default/ntpdate has an entry
NTPSERVERS="ntp.ubuntu.com".  When I google, I get a lot of
information about servers, how to set one up, etc, but nothing about
what I actually need to enter for the field <server> to USE the
server.

Help.

As currently specified in /etc/default/ntpdate, ntpdate is slaving to 
Ubuntu's own pool of NTP servers at "ntp.ubuntu.com".

I've always used the NTP server pool from NTP.org. It's used by millions 
or tens of millions of systems around the world. It's the default "time 
server" for most of the major Linux distributions and many networked 
appliances. For ntpdate, you could just point to "pool.ntp.org" instead 
of Ubuntu's NTP servers

ntpdate is a bit of a blunt instrument as it can only adjust the time 
once a day, in one big correction. The ntp daemon ntpd is far more 
subtle. It calculates the drift of your system clock and continuously 
adjusts it, so there are no large corrections that could lead to
inconsistent logs for instance.

I've always used NTPD w. a drift file configured with a list of NTP 
servers from NTP.org like so:

driftfile /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift

server 0.pool.ntp.org
server 1.pool.ntp.org
server 2.pool.ntp.org
server 3.pool.ntp.org

The 0, 1 and 2.pool.ntp.org names point to a random set of servers that 
will change every hour.

Start ntpd, and after some time (this could take as long as half an 
hour!), ntpq -pn should output something like:

mc-goose:~$ ntpq -p
     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter

Seems to me that you don't need to do anything because your time server 
is defined.  I use pool.ntp.org.

The Fedora people do sometimes use older versions of programs.
Evidently they think the newer ones are not ready for prime time.
For example, Fedora 10 still uses Firefox 3.0, even though 3,5 has been
out for quite a while.  Their version of groff is still stuck at v1.18,
even though v1.20 has been out for almost a year.

I'm glad that your Fedora 12 installation went well.  I tried it the
other day, and it got horribly confused at the last moment.  It got all
the way through the installation process, but when I rebooted, it
showed me a login screen, instead of the final "Welcome to Fedora 12"
page.  It wouldn't let me log in, either; it couldn't recognize the
root password.  I wound up having to go back to Fedora 10.  Thank
goodness for backups!  I've never had this trouble before, so I suspect
that something was awry with my dvd.

I don't know of any master list of repositories, though to be honest
I've never gone looking for one.  The main repositories that I use,
aside from Fedora's, are RPMFusion and Adobe.  RPMFusion
(<http://rpmfusion.org>) has a lot of stuff that Fedora won't carry,
due to patent or licensing issues. Things like MP3 and DVD codecs and
such.  Adobe, of course, is where you get the Adobe Flash plug-in for
Firefox.

If I may suggest, download a copy of Yumex (as root, type: "yum install
yumex").  Yumex is a GUI for yum that is, imho, much nicer than the
default GUI that comes with Fedora.  It's very nice for perusing the
repositories.  Between Yumex and the updates setup that Fedora
installs, you should be able to keep up to date with a minimum of fuss.

I had already discovered RPMFusion, and enabled it in order to install
VLC. And I added Adobe when I followed the instructions for installing
Flash. And after adding Adobe I was able to install Adobe Reader easily
from the package manager. 

Thanks for the tip about Yumex. I installed it, but I don't see a way
to add a repository. Not that I have any URLs yet, but if I discover a
repository that I want to enable I need to figure out what passes for
an /etc/apt/sources.list file in RPM-land, or how to add a repo with a
GUI. Then again, maybe my current list is all there is.

Sorry to hear about your woes with Fedora 12. The same thing happened
to me on my first attempt at installing Debian testing a month ago.
Except in my case root worked, it was my user password that was messed
up. I don't know how that could have happened. The installer asks for
the username and password, and you have to reenter the password to
verify. All I can conclude is that I mistyped my user password twice
the same way. But since root was good I could log in to Recovery Mode
as root, and then use the passwd command to fix jjj's password.

You can use Apt w. rpm based distros as well as Synaptic.

You can also use Alien to convert deb pkgs to rpm if you ever get the itch.

How come it does not work:

 sudo ntpdate -b ntp.ubuntu.com
27 Nov 16:54:38 ntpdate[21522]: no server suitable for synchronization found

 sudo ntpdate -b pool.ntp.org
27 Nov 16:56:44 ntpdate[21523]: no server suitable for synchronization found


I assumed that those addresses were incomplete.  Are you saying that
they are OK, and something else is wrong?  Timeout?  Slow connection
(dsl)?

My understanding is that -b option should be used only when calling 
ntpdate from a startup file at boot time and not from the cli. Try 
running it from the cli w/o -b.

My understanding is -b forces immediate update of the clock, rather
than a rate adjustment.  It should work from the command line.  But:

sudo ntpdate  pool.ntp.org

Hmm, and you can ping both ntp.ubuntu.com and pool.ntp.org, resolve the 
ip addr and get a response?

If I remember correctly, the very first email in this thread said "no
network available". If that's true, you're sunk.

With regard to Carlos' comment about no network,  what I meant was
that I have no local network.  My network is the internet.

Huh, this doesn't make any sense... And you get a ping response? 
Firewall? I believe NTP is udp 123. If you get an ip addr. Try "telnet 
<ip add> 123".

That's very strange. I've never had a GRUB installation failure of any kind.
Well in any case, if you are still having trouble installing the version of
GRUB you want, you could try running something like this to manually blast
GRUB 2 off of your MBR:

dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/sda bs=<your Hard Disk's Block Size in KB> count=439

Be sure to immediately install a bootloader onto your system after running
such a command. I would also wait for someone else in the mailing list to
double check my suggested command, as getting the incantation of dd wrong
can not only blow out your entire MBR, but also result in data loss.

Increase the timeout maybe?

ntpdate -b -t 4 pool.ntp.org

the default is 1, is more suitable for LAN connections as by default NTPdate will attemp to take 4 

samples in that 1 sec.

Could this indicate that either my dsl router or my ISP

It's possible, but seems unlikely. I was able to verify w. netcat that 
port 123 is open on the particular NTP server you couldn't connect to:

root at mc-goose:~# nc -vvzu 75.144.70.35 123 123
splenda.rustytel.net [75.144.70.35] 123 (ntp) open
splenda.rustytel.net [75.144.70.35] 123 (ntp) open
 sent 0, rcvd 0

Is another process already bound to port 123 =>lsof -i :123. You might 
need to install lsof or net-tools pkg.

What happens when you run ntpdate w. -dv (debug verbose)?

Subject: [PLUG] Alacarte Gnome Menu Editor
Message-ID: <20091127192153.85028611.johnxj@comcast.net>

This is an obscure, odd problem, but maybe someone here can offer some
suggestions.

I am setting up my new installation of Fedora 12 x86_64 with Gnome
desktop. I am trying to create a menu item in the Applications menu to
launch TreeForm, a syntax tree editing program written in Java. The
command to launch it is:

java -Xmx256m -Xms64m -jar TreeForm.jar

The TreeForm.jar archive resides in /home/jjj/Software. If I use the
command line and change directory to /home/jjj/Software, then execute
the command, the program launches and all of the buttons on its menu
appear. If I launch it from someplace else and use the command:

java -Xmx256m -Xms64m -jar /home/jjj/Software/TreeForm/TreeForm.jar

It launches, but the buttons do not appear. 

The TreeForm folder contains a subfolder containing images of the
buttons. For some reason the application finds the subfolder when it is
launched from the command line inside the /home/jjj/Software/TreeForm
folder, but not if it is called from outside that folder. 

This is very strange, but it doesn't matter to me as long as I get the
buttons. 

I opened Alacarte to create a launch item. The launch entry launches
TreeForm, but without the buttons. The command I started with was:

java -Xmx256m -Xms64m -jar /home/jjj/Software/TreeForm.jar

In an attempt to fix the problem, I changed the command to:

cd /home/jjj/Software/TreeForm | java -Xmx256m -Xms64m -jar TreeForm.jar

However, this gives me an error message 'failed to execute child
process "cd" (No such file or directory).'

I'm trying to get the launch menu command to change to the directory
first, then launch the .jar archive. Apparently I haven't got the
syntax quite right. 

Clicking on the Help button in Alacarte gives me 'The requested URI
"ghelp:user-guide#menu-editor" is invalid.'

I bet there is someone here with enough command line experience to
suggest some ways of writing the command so that it accomplishes what I
want.

Hmm, I think there is firewall somewhere blocking udp 123.  There's also 
a -u option to use an unprivileged port for outgoing packets. 
Apparently, when you invoke debugging mode ntpdate always uses an 
unprivileged port.

cd /home/jjj/Software/TreeForm ; java -Xmx256m -Xms64m -jar TreeForm.jar

Though I prefer to wrap things like this up in a bash script and the
launch that:

#!/bin/bash
cd /home/jjj/Software/TreeForm 
java -Xmx256m -Xms64m -jar TreeForm.jar

(you might want to specify the full path to the java executable)

The semicolon didn't do the trick - same error message. Maybe you can't
concatenate commands in Alacarte.

But the script idea was perfect.

Thanks!

I can only guess that your router, firewall or provider is blocking port 
123, or the port is not properly configured on your PC.  If you have 
nmap installed, (sudo apt-get install nmap), it can tell you if the port 
is open.  Try these, each should show that the host is up:
  nmap -p 123 localhost
  nmap -p 123 your.router.IP.address
  nmap -PN -p 123 pool.ntp.org

Heh, I actually did post on the arch linux forums first. Since no one 
there was able to give me a suggestion that worked I figured I'd try to 
pick some more brains.


Do not be afraid to joust a giant just because some people believe in 
windmills.

That is it.  Thanks so much for the help.  Now I want to find out

The firewall is in your house, unless you're stealing internet from
your neighbor. The DSL router is the most likely location by far.

For DSL, time synchronization is important for error free communication. 
Many routers even provide NTP. It's possible that you could get NTP from 
the DSL router itself.

Also, you can run a traceroute on port 123 and see at which hop it times 
out.
traceroute 75.144.70.35 -p 123

OK, it happened twice after installing Debian testing, and now it has
happened with my brand new installation of Fedora 12. I have been
rebooting Fedora every few hours, and I just did so. Yep, the window
manager and gnome-panel are gone. And this time the desktop is gone as
well - no icons at all, just a totally blank screen with my wallpaper.

I cannot get a terminal in X. I do have the mouse and keyboard, but
without a panel or a desktop there is no way to launch an x-terminal.

I can go to a command line with Ctrl-Alt-F2. (For some reason Fedora
uses Ctrl-Alt-F2 to go to a command line and Ctrl-Alt-F1 to return to
X). But you can't launch an X program from that command line.

Last time this happened (second try at testing) Rogan suggested
installing Xfce4. I did so, and when the login window came up I was
able to select Xfce4 instead of Gnome. That got me a usable desktop. I
still ended up being unable to fix the problem in Gnome, and after
several days I gave up and tried Unstable, and now Fedora 12. 

However, this time (as root) the command "yum install xfce4" returns
"no package xfce4 available." I also tried "yum install kde" but got a
similar error message. If I do "yum search xfce4" I get a long list of
packages relating to xfce, but none that appear to install the desktop.
Ditto for kde. It escapes me why there would be tons of libraries,
utilities and configs for these desktops, but no package to install the
desktop.

>From past experience, once this happens, it is unrepairable. OK, it is
probably repairable, but 1) I have received multiple suggestions from
people here and on the Debian e-list, and nothing solved the problem.
Creating a new user worked for a while, then suddenly the new user lost
the window manager and panel. And 2) if I ever get to the bottom of it
I bet it will be a bug in Gnome 2.28.0. In other words, it probably
isn't repairable until there is a fix.

I know that Fedora 12 uses Gnome 2.28.0. I could swear that Debian
testing did as well, but I have to check on that to be sure. If I am
right, then there is no point in installing a distro that uses 2.28.0.
I have no idea what I am doing that causes this, but I do know that I
need all the applications that I have installed. 

I'm also running out of patience. :(

Message-ID: <eac729460911272202t3fe68219g81deddd286468e67@mail.gmail.com>

I just noticed that the OSU/Oregon football game is scheduled for 6:00
PM on Thursday Dec 3, 2009.
And the PLUG meeting is scheduled for 7:00 PM on Thursday Dec 3, 2009.
We are planning to have Lev Tsypin give a presentation on Drupal.

Is this a conflict that requires a schedule change?

Normally, we don't skip or reschedule a meeting for anything short of
a national holiday; but a
Civil War game to determine who is going to the Rose Bowl is almost a
national holiday.

Please advise me.
Should we reschedule this meeting or have it as normally scheduled?
I'm especially interested in the opinions of people who normally
attend the meetings.

Never mind - Google told me the answer. The command is "yum -y groupinstall xfce4."

So here I am in an Xfce desktop. Wonder what distro I should try next.

I have to say it is very unusual that you are running into this
repeatedly, especially using different distributions and desktops.

Are you running the same hardware each time? When you reboot your system
does the fsck disk checker get run? I suppose hard disk corruption could
break things this badly. Check the output of the command "dmesg" every
so often when you're logged in and using your system and look for errors
- especially ones related to your disk drives/filesystem.

http://distrowatch.com/ has a list of the Top 100 Linux distros. A 
couple I've checked out in the past that I liked were Mint, Mandriva, 
PCLinuxOS, and Mepis. All are Debian derived. Sabayon is a neat live DVD 
of Gentoo. But it didn't work to well on my Thinkpad...

Back when I was spending days trying to solve the problem in Debian
testing I did check dmesg periodically. I never saw any error messages
at all. I also checked /var/log/messages, the xorg logs and lots of
other things. At one point I had rebooted so many times that I hit the
"30 boots = forced fsck" limit. Fsck didn't find any errors.

Besides, if it was a disk error it would be a colossal coincidence that
another disk error caused exactly the same problem after the disk was
reformatted to install Fedora.

No, it has to be a bug in something that some package or configuration
I am doing is causing. It would take weeks of logging out, making one
change, logging back in, making one change, logging out, logging back
in, and so on. At this point my #1 suspect is Gnome 2.28.x. 

I need to go check the Gnome bug reports, but haven't gotten that far
yet. Meantime, I can run Fedora fine on Xfce4. I don't care much for
Xfce4, but it suffices until I can decide what to do next.

Push come to shove I can put the old hard disk with Jaunty back into
the Thinkpad. Then I can chalk this adventure up as one of those
"sadder but wiser" experiences that life dishes out from time to time.
But I am too pigheaded to give up.

Rich, eth1 has 2 ip addresses, one of which is the autoconfiguration ip 
address (169.254.0.0)** **. This address only gets assigned when an 
interface does not have a static ip address configured and is unable to 
obtain an ip addr via DHCP.

Can you run "cat /etc/network/interfaces" and post the output?

Rich, what's in the /etc/hosts file is a static mapping of ip addr to 
common name for the computer to use instead of DNS for name resolution. 
This is a hand edited file. The real current actual ip addr of any 
computer is not reflected in this file.

If you want to know the real current ip addrs of all the interfaces on 
the laptop run "ifconfig -a"

Well, I don't normally attend football games, so I don't think we
should force them to reschedule the game.  However, if we find that
their games result in an unseemly excess of rowdy football fans
interfering with PLUG Afters, we may have to hack into the school
computers and zero-budget the athletic program.

Apparently, they are talking about shutting down Milne Hall
(the first OSU dedicated computer building) for budget reasons,
so we may need to shift some funds anyway ...

I spent a good deal in Milne.  I was down on OSU campus a week or two
ago, and had a walk around.  They do have a shiny new Engineering
Building.

Message-ID: <f72d4c6a0911282046w4241314ev39bb3b9e01b90cd7@mail.gmail.com>

I have been trying to figure out how to run ntpdate -bu pool.ntp.org
at boot.  I can put it in the startup set, but since ntpdate requires
running as root, I would have to enter the pw at each boot.  I need to
avoid the need for the pw, which I believe means  having it run before
login.

I have changed /etc/default/ntpdate to include pool.ntp.org and added
the -bu options so that ntpdate-debian works (if run as root).  One
conversation on ubuntu forums said that that those changes to
/etc/default/ntpdate were all that was needed; that ntpdate-debian was
already run during boot.  That does not appear to be the case.  I have
been unable to understand the stuff about the various symbolic links
in /etc/re*.d   I think also there is an issue of the order of the
scripts running at boot:  ntpdate must run after the network is
established.

So the question in its most general form is how to run ntpdate -bu
pool.ntp.org without my intervention.  If my attempts at this are
close, what does it take to get ntpdate-debian to run during boot?
Some of the docs seem to indicate that should be a default condition
of ubuntu Jaunty.

Thanks for the help,
-Denis

I don't run it at boot, but I do run it on a schedule. on production boxes,
I go once an hour. everything else can go once a day or 12 hours or whenever
you want really.

I do this by adding the command to invoke ntpdate to root's crontab.

run the command "sudo crontab -e"

add the line:

0 * * * * ntpdate -bu pool.ntp.org #this will run it once an hour, on the
hour

or:

0 0 * * * ntpdate -bu pool.ntp.org #this will run it every day at midnight

Thanks.  I may resort to something like that, but there are a couple
of problems.  First is that my machine is almost never on at midnight.
 The second is that the time servers try to avoid being hit "on the
hour" by everybody.  I would have to find out how to set the time it
is run offset by some arbitrary number of minutes.

Since my machine is off as much as it is on, time updating at boot is
a good choice. That way there is no chance that some random program
will encounter a file with a future time.

You could set this up with anacron - which is installed by default on Ubuntu systems.

In addition to the normally scheduled jobs you could run anacron at boot with the -n and -s
options.

Thanks, Michael.  This looks interesting.  However, I find the man
page difficult, to put it gently.  How do I get anacron to run at
boot?  That seems to be the central question of this whole exercise:
How do I get anything to run at boot?  If I know how to run anacron at
boot, why do I need it?  Why can't I just run ntpdate-debian at the
appropriate time during boot?  Is anacron running by default?

I sense that this question is so fundamental and so basic that nobody
here believes that I am actually asking it.  Nobody could be that much
of a noob.

   One way is to add the command to /etc/rc.local. That runs at the end of
the boot sequence.

I have seen other references to /etc/rc.local.  For a while I thought
that this file did not exist on my system-wrong.  I was confused by
the folders rc#.d and rcS.d.  I was sent to the debian policy manual
for information.  But that is not written in English that I am
familiar with.

Putting the command in  /etc/rc.local  seems straight-forward.

Thanks.

   On Slackware it's in /etc/rc.d/rc.local. On my wife's xubuntu system it
did not exist until I create it. Just be sure that it's executable ('chmod
a+x') so it will be run.

Please note that according to http://www.pool.ntp.org/en/use.html

  As pool.ntp.org will assign you timeservers from all over the world, time
  quality will not be ideal. You get a bit better result if you use the
  continental zones (For example europe, north-america, oceania or
  asia.pool.ntp.org), and even better time if you use the country zone (like
  ch.pool.ntp.org in Switzerland) - for all these zones, you can again use the
  0, 1 or 2 prefixes, like 0.ch.pool.ntp.org. Note, however, that the country
  zone might not exist for your country, or might contain only one or two
  timeservers. If you know timeservers that are really close to you (measured
  by network distance, with traceroute or ping), time probably will be even
  better.

So, you probably shouldn't be lazy here.  Change it to the recommendation
of http://www.pool.ntp.org/zone/us - not pool.ntp.org.

I am here to report that I have been bitten for the fourth time by
Gnome 2.8.0.

I reformatted and installed OpenSuse 11.2, which uses Gnome 2.8.0. I
spent yesterday installing and configuring stuff, rebooting
occasionally. This morning I rebooted and when X came up there was no
metacity. But this time the Gnome panel did appear. I started metacity
from the terminal, so I am functional. OpenSuse installs IceWM as well
as the default metacity, so I can try that, or install Xfce4.

I spent some time yesterday searching on the OpenSuse forums for
answers to other issues and I stumbled across this thread:

http://forums.opensuse.org/applications/427153-desktop-wont-load.html

I also found quite a few people reporting similar problems on the
Ubuntu forums, all with Karmic. Karmic uses Gnome 2.8.0.

I'm going to search the Gnome bugtracker next, which I should have done
earlier. If I don't find a fix (which I think is unlikely), I'm
probably going to reformat and install OpenSuse 11.1. For sure I am not
touching any distro-version that uses Gnome 2.8.0.

A combination of wget and pdftk will do this

I think the following will  download all the pdf files you are interested in
without downloading all of .gov
wget -r -H -A.pdf
-Daccess.gpo.gov-I/nara/cfr/waisidx_08,/nara/cfr/waisidx_07,/cfr_2008/octqtr/pdf/
http://www.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/cfrassemble.cgi?title=200846

All the pdf files end up in a directory
edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/octqtr/pdf

cd to that directory and concatenate all the pdf files into out.pdf with

pdftk *pdf cat output out.pdf

I have not completely tested this as it involves a pretty big download, so
let me know if there is a problem.

Subject: [PLUG] Vfat USB drive mounts read-only
Message-ID: <20091129135027.8bd28a70.johnxj@comcast.net>

I never had this problem with Ubuntu or when I was trying Debian
testing. But when I installed Fedora 12, and now with OpenSuse 11.2,
when I plug in my USB drive Nautilus won't let me write to it because
it is read-only.

>From the command line:

linux-ddbc:/home/jjj # mount
<snippage>
/dev/sdb1 on /media/USB Drive type vfat
(rw,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=devkit,uid=1000,gid=100,shortname=lower,dmask=0077,utf8=1,flush)

The command line says it is mounted rw, but either the command line or
Nautilus is lying.

Trying the cp command as root from the command line also fails with the
error message that the device is mounted read-only.

This is highly annoying when trying to install different distros and
migrate Mail folders and stuff. Worse, OpenSuse 11.2 is having a hard
time mounting my CD/DVD drive.

   Sometimes I get that when the entry in /etc/fstab does not include the
'users' option.

   I don't know why the options are in parentheses or why there are so many.
On my system /etc/fstab has two mountable USB devices:

/dev/sda1        /mnt/thumb       vfat        noauto,users	0 0
/dev/sda         /mnt/meizu       vfat        noauto,users	0 0

and both work for me as a user.

   Suggest that you change /etc/fstab to have only the two options I use and
see if there's a difference.

Hi:

I got an Android phone and when I attached it to my Ubuntu laptop,
I can see that it recognizes it as SCSI drive.
I can see the device under /dev.

When I tried to mount it as NTFS, I got these errors:

sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sg2 /media/mydisk
Error reading bootsector: Illegal seek
Failed to sync device /dev/sg2: Invalid argument
Failed to mount '/dev/sg2': Illegal seek


I tried VFAT too but no help.

Anything I am doing wrong?

It is a vfat file system, not ntfs, but that does not seem to be the whole
problem. What is the output of
sudo  fdisk -l /dev/sg2

It just hangs when issue "sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdg2"

I sticked it onto a Window box and it recognizes it but give me no

(everything is blank out in Properties and size is 0 MB)

Maybe it needs to be formatted?

Formatting it is a bad idea and anyway, so far nothing is appearing that you
can format.
On the android in the notifications area where it says "USB connected" did
you choose that and click mount?

Try "sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdg" (the device without the partition
number).  Fdisk works with entire drives, not individual partitions.
It's easy to forget that; I've made the same mistake myself more than
once.

If you still are having problems VY, I'll plug in my MyTouch and see what I
can figure out. I haven't had that issue but you need to click the "mount
usb" option on the phone itself when plugging in as has been suggested.

ok, so that was my problem.  I did not know I had to click on that "mount"
button.

Thanks for your help.

Subject: [PLUG] Linksys WAP11 and SNMP...
Message-ID: <1259544418.4423.11.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

Looking at the bottom of my router, it is version 2.6.

I downloaded, compiled, and installed net-snmp-5.5 from
sourceforge.  I haven't a clue what the answers are when
I do snmpconfig.  I haven't a clue if I'll be able to run
snmptrapd and actually capture information from the
Linksys.

For some reason which I can't detect, I can't connect to
the web interface on the Linksys.  Lynx errs out with a
read error where firefox goes to a blank white screen
after trying for a long time to connect.  No packet 
errors are showing up on the router that this wireless 
AP is hooked up to.  I often get the authentication 
dialog, but not always.  I can't even connect via lynx
from the closest router.

I have no idea what version of SNMP the Linksys WAP11 
version 2.6 implements.  I have no idea if the SNMP 
software I installed on the router supports the same 
version of the protocol.

Ideally, I would figure out how to fix access to the
web interface and figure out how to configure the Linksys
via SNMP.  I'd be happy to get either method working at
this point.  Preferably, since the router is a headless
Slackware box that I ssh into, I want a command line tool
to configure the Linksys with.

While I'm at it, I'd love to figure out how to get WEP working
and I want to know why my wireless Slackware server in another
building frequently disassociates itself.

But I need something that is friendly to Scribus. Scribus uses Qt 4.5
and the Ubuntu people have messed around with the Qt libraries, causing
massive bugs for Scribus on Ubuntu. Mint is based on Ubuntu.

Thanks for the suggestion. Things have changed.

Due to the overwhelming bugs in Gnome 2.8.0 I have wiped out OpenSuse 11.2 and installed OpenSuse 11.1. Hopefully (knocking on wood, throwing salt over shoulder, crossing fingers) things will be much better.

Before I wiped out 11.2 I needed to copy a couple of folders to something, one being my Mail folder and the other being the live CD of 11.1 that I had downloaded. The latter could easily be reproduced, but I really needed the Mail folder. I have two other USB sticks, an ancient 512 MB and an almost as old 1 GB. Both mounted as RW. I got the mail folder on one, and the 11.1 ISO on the other, although I had to delete the PLUG flyers to make room. They're on my old hard disk and I have other backups, so not to worry.

Now that I am running with 11.1 I stuck in the offending USB drive. Nautilus popped up a window displaying the contents, but every single item had a padlock on it. From the command line "ls -la" shows that every single item on the drive is owned by jjj (that's me!) of the group root (not me!). 

Somehow, while using this drive and installing various different distros the ownership has gotten messed up. And it is still not mounted read/write. Even as root I cannot copy a file to it. Yet the mount command still says it is (rw). 

The thing is that I use this drive to transfer things to professors and other students at PSU. I can probably fix /etc/fstab, but what happens when I hand it to someone else with a Windows or Mac computer?

Maybe I should just copy everything off of it to a DVD and reformat it as vfat.

Sorry for the lack of linewrap. Sylpheed won't install on OpenSuse 11.1 and I had to install Claws Mail instead. I can't find the button for Linewrap.

I had a USB drive that suddenly went read only no matter what voodoo I did
and it turned out it was bad. I would make copies of your data off it and
see if formatting or failing that, dd'ing /dev/zero to it to see if it
solves the issue.

Subject: [PLUG] RTL8180L Card...
Message-ID: <1259575063.6340.15.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

Doing a cat /proc/pci my Zonet PCI wireless card comes up as a 
RealTek 8180L card.  Note the L, I think it means that this card 
is quite different from some other 8180 series cards.  I have a 
free driver from sourceforge that works on 2.6 kernels, but I'm 
noticing that it isn't perfect.  Randomly, the card just stops 
working.  If you are ssh'ed in over this card, you'll be going 
along fine and without warning everything stops.  I'm wondering 
if I should upgrade from 2.6.10 to a much later kernel because 
of the possibility that the driver won't compile at all for a 
newer kernel?

I tried to use a 2.6 kernel specific driver from RealTek, but that
driver is specific to the 2.6.9 Fedora Core 3 kernel and does
not work with 2.6.10.  Worse, I am not impressed with how this
driver was implemented as it doesn't plug in nicely with the way
things are standardly done in Slackware.

Most of the time when the card is working, I notice a 96/100 for
link quality.  When it is working, it works well.  That's the
trouble, it doesn't always work.

I am somewhat suspicious of my Linksys WAP11 AP, version 2.6 on
the bottom.  Power cycling it sometimes brings the link back up,
which seems odd.

I have rtl8180-0.21.tar.gz source code from sourceforge.  Is this
the latest version of this driver?  Is anyone maintaining this
driver to try and get it working with more of the 8180 cards
out there?  I have 3 open standard 16 bit pcmcia slots. I could
get a pcmcia wireless card to replace this one.  Question is,
what would work well in Linux and connect to my rp-sma pig 
tail?

2.6.10 is OLD .. yes upgrade .. it should certainly compile with the new
kernel source code.

Then use Mandriva 2010 One KDE. It's a very good for KDE. And more trouble
free than Fedora or OpenSuse.

Which android phone did you get?

What did the filesystem turn out to be i.e. what is the output of fdisk -l ?

How do you like it?  What are you able to do with it?

IIRC, Mandriva 2010 offers the choice between KDE and Gnome at installation.
(John stated earlier that Gnome was pretty much a requirement for him).

But not because it may not be a good distro. Four years ago when I was starting
with Linux I signed up online for their download-the-latest service. When I
later discovered that Mandriva was not for me I tried to cancel the
subscription. There was no place on the web site to cancel and they never
responded to numerous e-mails. I literally had to get my bank to issue me a new
card number to get the monthly charges to stop. And then they finally responded
with an e-mail that I owed them money and they would take me to collections if
I did not pay up. They're located in France, which makes them effectively
beyond the reach of US law for small issues.

Some of us consumers have long memories.

Today's exercise is to see if I can figure out package management in OpenSuse
11.1. I think I have all the standard repos enabled, but some very common
software is not appearing in the Manage Software GUI. Also I need to figure out
what is the equivalent of apt-get, dpkg and aptitude so I can use the command
line.Also, I keep reading tidbits that you can use Synaptic with OpenSuse, but
I don't know how that would work.

John,

Mandriva has improved a lot in the last couple years. I don't subscribe to
any of their programs. I only use Mandriva 2010 One, it's free and it's
fine. It's not perfect, but no distro is.  I normally use Gnome, but their
KDE version is very good. Plus, their forum is one of the most helpful I've
used.

Try it for yourself and see.

Arch Linux is also very good. Takes more time to set up but from my
experience it's cutting edge with more stability than Fedora.

I don't think you need to worry about the group ID.  The vfat filesystem
has no concept of "group," so Linux just wings it.  I'd be willing to
bet that all your files are marked as executable, too.  The fact that
you can't mount rw is much more worrying.  You might try

"sudo mount -o remount,rw /dev/sd<whatever> /your/mount/point/here"

If that doesn't work, I suspect that your thumb drive has gotten
corrupted or is going bad.  Try copying everything off and
reformatting. If that doesn't work, you're probably stuck with buying a
new one.  :-(  Fortunately, they're not very expensive these days.

That I can help you with, since I use Claws Mail.  :-)  From the main
Claws Mail window, open Configuration>Preferences... (NOT "Preferences
for current account").  Claws will pop up a new window with lots of
options.  In the left-hand pane, select Compose>Wrapping. There you'll
find all of your linewrapping options.  Also, in the main Edit menu,
you will find the "Wrap current paragraph" option (bound to <ctrl-l>).
I think you have to set the wrap column first, though.  I don't recall
what it defaults to, I'm afraid.

Hope this helps!

some thumbdrives have a read-only switch.  make sure you haven't hit that. 
same for sd cards.

I was worried that Drew's experience would become mine - a dead stick. But I
managed to write all of the contents to a DVD drive for safekeeping, even
though I'm pretty sure everything on it is backed up elsewhere anyway.

Then I went to reformat it. I couldn't figure out exactly how to do it with
mkfs, probably "mkfs vfat /dev/sdb1," but not being sure I decided to use
Gparted instead. After ages of poking through OpenSuse menus (why is everything
three levels deep so you have to click four times to launch an app?), I
couldn't find Gparted. Command line didn't help. OK, back to YaSt. Sure enough,
not installed. 

After installing Gparted I formatted it Fat32 and subsequently was able to read
and write to it. Problem solved, I hope. 

I think something bad happened because I was using it to copy my Mail folder
and new config files as I wiped out one distro and installed a new one. One of
the distros probably managed to goober it up, probably one of the ones using
Gnome 2.8.0, because in 2.8.0 Nautilus is as messed up as the rest of the
desktop.

I should correct myself - Sylpheed 2.7.1 does install on OpenSuse 11.1, but I
get a segmentation fault when I launch it.

Thanks for the tip about Claws Mail. Linwrapping fixed now.

I have one other question about Claws Mail. In Sylpheed I had the columns in
the top window with the mailbox set to From - Subject - Date. Claws Mail
decided that I wanted the columns Subject - From - Date. I noticed when I used
Sylpheed last (Fedora 12) that it did the same thing, but in Sylpheed I could
just drag the From column to where I wanted it. It won't drag in Claws Mail and
I can't find any configuration setting to change the order of the columns. Did
I miss it, or is the feature lacking in Claws Mail 3.7.3?

One more question. I just noticed that Claws Mail created a folder titled
"Gnome" in my Desktop folder. It contains 127 .png images (buttons, mostly, it
appears).

This seems very strange to me. Why is this folder not inside the ~/.claws-mail
configurations folder?

Well, progress.  I decided to use anacron so that I would not be
updating my clock at each boot.  Once per week should be fine.  And I
see that anacron is run by default, so all that is needed is to put an
entry in anacrontab:

# added 11/30/2009 dlh
# period(days) delay(min.)   identifier             job
     7                    0             NTPDATE-DEB
/usr/sbin/ntpdate-debian

After reboot, syslog contains:

Nov 30 11:57:14 R2D4 anacron[3551]: Will run job `NTPDATE-DEB' in 0 min.
Nov 30 11:57:14 R2D4 anacron[3551]: Jobs will be executed sequentially
Nov 30 11:57:14 R2D4 anacron[3551]: Job `NTPDATE-DEB' started
Nov 30 11:57:14 R2D4 /usr/sbin/cron[3596]: (CRON) INFO (pidfile fd = 3)
Nov 30 11:57:14 R2D4 /usr/sbin/cron[3597]: (CRON) STARTUP (fork ok)
Nov 30 11:57:14 R2D4 anacron[3551]: Job `NTPDATE-DEB' terminated (exit
status: 1) (mailing output)
Nov 30 11:57:15 R2D4 /usr/sbin/cron[3597]: (CRON) INFO (Running @reboot jobs)
Nov 30 11:57:15 R2D4 anacron[3551]: Normal exit (1 job run)

I take this to mean that there was a problem (exit status: 1).  Yet I
can find nothing in the mail logs.  man anacron says the mail will go
to the user (usually root).  Is there some mail log which I am not
privy to, due to ubuntu handling of root?  I can make an entry in
anacrontab to cause the mail to go wherever I want by assigning it to
the MAILTO variable, but I do  not know the format. Is it just a file
name?

Thanks,
-Denis

It's there, just buried in the global Preferences panel.  Go to
Configuration>Preferences... then select Display>Summaries.  Near the
bottom of the page, in the Message List section, there's a line that
says "Displayed Columns" with an "Edit" button.  Click on the button and
you'll be able to change the column ordering.

Now there I have no clue.  Claws has never done anything like that here.
There isn't even a Gnome directory in my ~/.claws-mail directory.  I'm
running Fedora 10, though, which might make a difference.  I have run
SuSE, but I don't recall it creating such a folder there, either.  :-(

I'm glad to hear that your thumb drive problem is cleared up.  It's
probably a good idea to buy a spare, just in case.  They do die, and
reformatting may have just masked an underlying problem.  Or it could
have been gremlins, and the thing will keep going for years.  :-)

It was definitely created by Claws Mail because there are things in it that
could only be Claws Mail related, like a text file named claws-themeinfo.

Well, I closed down Claws Mail, renamed the folder, and restarted Claws Mail.
Everything looks the same - all the buttons and icons are as before. <Shrug>

I'll leave it there for the time being, and eventually I'll delete it. Maybe
I'll ask on the Sylpheed e-list, just out of curiosity.

Since it is your machine:

sudo vi /etc/aliases
  add a line:  root:     YOUR_USERNAME
  the colon after root is important

sudo newaliases

After that email sent to root will be delivered to you.

More info.  I found  entries in daemon.log:
Nov 30 08:06:04 R2D4 ntpdate[3330]: step time server 69.63.177.217
offset 0.894285 sec
...
Nov 30 11:57:14 R2D4 ntpdate[3434]: can't find host
http://www.pool.ntp.org/zone/us
Nov 30 11:57:14 R2D4 ntpdate[3434]: no servers can be used, exiting

This seems to indicate that ntpdate was run before I made the changes
to anacrontab and rebooted.  Perhaps I did do it manually, but I do
not recall doing that, and I can not find the command in my history.
The only conclusion I can get from this is that ntpdate is already
being run somewhere.  I think I had better remove my changes to
anacrontab, reboot, and look at daemon.log again.

Also, it seem that http://www.pool.ntp.org/zone/us as suggested by
Randall is not working.  Did I miss-type?

no, you misunderstood.  you were supposed to go look at that web page 
which would tell you what to put into your ntp config.

Ah--thanks for the clue-stick.

But now that i look at that site, I see the following: "Make sure your
computer's clock is set to something sensible (within a few minutes of
the 'true' time) - you could use ntpdate pool.ntp.org".

That is what I was planning, which precipitated Randall's comment
(lazy, he said!).  So I do not feel so bad in interpreting the advice
on that site as I had.  Seeing as I will not be using ntpd (my machine
is typically not up long enough to make it a sensible way to correct
the clock--correct me if I am wrong), I plan to use ntpdate.

ntpdate uses data in /etc/default/ntpdate (ntpd not installed, hence
no /etc/ntp.conf file.  So now I have added to /etc/default/ntpdate
the line NTPSERVERS="0.us.pool.ntp.org 1.us.pool.ntp.org
2.us.pool.ntp.org 3.us.pool.ntp.org"

We will see if that keeps the binary men happy.

Now to go back to the question of whether ntpdate is being run by
default, buried somewhere in the bowels this system.

I think Ubuntu runs ntpdate at bootup by default.  IIRC, I read that in 
one of the Ubuntu forums.

FWIW,  I installed both Suse 11.2 and Karmic (32bit, NOT 64bit) on my
desktop, and both run fine with no problems (yet).  I have really old
hardware though (AMD Athlon, KT133, nVidia GeForce2 MX/MX 400, so this is
probably no basis for comparison to the problems John was having.

When you copy your data over can you omit your dot files? ALL of the dot
files just to test and see if something in there is mucking things up? I
really think it boils down to something that you're restoring into your home
directory or if you're adding things to /etc from other distros or version
of gnome from Ubuntu. Without knowing everything that is being restored it's
hard to say. Maybe if you're happy with OpenSUSE it's no longer an issue but
an idea to keep in mind if something breaks again in the future. FWIW
Zenwalk Linux is a friendlier version of Slackware.

And so it is.

To recap:  I wanted to keep my system clock reasonably correct.  I
understood that ubuntu runs ntpdate at boot by default.  It was not
happening.  Two reasons:

1) /etc/default/ntpdate has a line NTPDATE_USE_NTP_CONF=yes, which
causes ntpdate to go to /etc/ntp.conf for the server list.  ntpd is
not installed,( again, the default condition), so /etc/ntp.conf does
not exist.  Changing the statement to NTPDATE_USE_NTP_CONF=no causes
ntpdate to use the server list following in
NTPSERVERS="ntp.ubuntu.com".

2) My dsl modem was blocking port 124, so ntpdate could not reach any
servers.  Option -u on ntpdate forces use of an unprivileged port, so
servers can be reached.

I learned some stuff about ntp servers, my modem, anacron, and ubuntu.
 I never tested whether the default server ntp.ubuntu.com actually
worked, since I had expert advice on choice of servers.

Thanks to all who helped me navigate the maze.

-Denis

I never copied the entire ~/ at once. I had the old Jaunty hard drive in an
Ultrabay adapter for my Thinkpad so I could copy things as I wanted, but I
typically moved configs over one at a time.

It is now evening and I am concluding a very frustrating day with OpenSuse
11.1. On my page-long list of applications to install I worked on:

Adobe Reader 9.2.
Adobe Flash
Okular
OOo 3.1.1.4
Scribus 1.3.5.1
Sylpheed
Opera
K3b
VLC

I succeeded in installing VLC, K3b, Opera and Flash. And with Dale's help I got
Claws Mail working as a substitute for Sylpheed. However, after installing K3b I
tried to launch it and got an error message. I also tried from the command line
and it failed again (no such file or command). After rebooting it worked. And
that is not the only app that fails to work until you reboot - most of them do.
Sounds like Windows 3.0. 

I got Okular installed, but it crashes as soon as you try to open a PDF in it.

It took me two hours to get Scribus 1.3.5.1 installed, and it crashes on launch.

I still cannot figure out how to get Adobe Reader 9.2 or OOo 3.1.1.4 installed.

I tried to edit the Applications menu, but the menu editor won't let me drag
and drop, and the Add New, Delete, Up and Down arrows and the whole panel on the
right are missing.

That is the sum total that I accomplished in seven hours at the keyboard
today. Someone please tell my why this PoS deserves more of my time. Oh wait,
the Scribus developers love OpenSuse.

I think I'm going to pour myself a Canadian and quietly pull my blond hair out.

Message-ID: <4B14BA41.4000500@gmail.com>

Please excuse me for this selfish rant. Howerver, I'm frustrated w. the 
lack of Linux job opps in PDX and and the rest of the state too for that 
matter. Especially for entry to mid level people (3 - 5 yrs exp, 1 or 2 
distros, light scripting w, other know/exp such as networking, 
virtualization).

What I don't understand is why so many small to med bizs still run 
Microsoft. The job descrips are usually the same: MS Server 2003/2008, 
Exchange, Active Directory, Office. Is this just by default? Are they 
not interested in saving money? Don't they want performance, 
reliability, a custom solution that best fits their needs? Don't they 
care about supporting a talented, creative, local economy by seeking out 
FOSS solutions?

I wish I could go into every one of these bizs and show them what Linux 
is capable of and then hook them up with talented people who could 
customize OS/package builds and maybe even develop custom FOSS apps as 
needs dictate.

It could be such a better world for us all...

AMEN!

Pity though you are preaching to the choir....

I have seen a few places with Linux jobs, but definitely slim pickings.

Unless you have Senior level experience and have been a UNIX admin since
1970 with the requisite laundry list of experience with programs and big
iron and so on...

Subject: [PLUG] Transparent Proxying...
Message-ID: <1259650209.3465.4.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

seems to be done differently in the 2.6 kernel world.

The redirect method:

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -s $local -d ! $local --dport 80 -j
REDIRECT --to-port 8080

doesn't seem to be the accepted way to proxy anymore and it doesn't
seem to work either.

So what level of the 2.6 kernel does one have to have to do transparent
proxying?  Some indications are that I need the latest version where
there are other indications that maybe I need a patch.

Any help figuring out how this is done these days would be very much
appreciated.

Why exactly can't you do that?

Start with one. Let me know if I can help.

Exactly! Back in the day I got my MCSE(NT4) via self-study in 3 mths and 
then got a decent paying Sys Admin job shortly thereafter. Don't get me 
wrong, I'm glad it's not that easy.  I'm far more skilled now, 
passionate about all things Linux/FOSS and MS oriented jobs don't 
inspire me enough to apply for.
