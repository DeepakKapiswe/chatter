Folks, 

Been experimenting a bit with nc. As such, I've been seeing how it
connects from system to system. To that end, I started an Apache server
on my laptop (on Hardy Heron). After a bit, I ran the following command
to see if the nc from another system would show up.

netstat -atun 

Well, it didn't, but I soon got a bunch of entries similar to 

tcp  0  0 10.168.0.111:44535    xxx.yyy.zzz.aaa:80   ESTABLISHED

Where xxx.yyy.zzz.aaa are public addresses from places like FL and MA.
It's not like I have anything but the standard "It works" page on that
Apache server. 

And I have a pretty standard (though old) firewall on the router, with
port forwarding set up (for the most part) to some non-existent systems
on my local private IP net. My laptop is not one of them. 

So there's a weakness somewhere. I don't have MS running anywhere (at
the moment) Any suggestions on where I should look?

Thanks,
Mike

Just to follow-up, I tried some of the IP addresses from the remote
sites in my browser, and most of them go to fake Google home pages. I'm
guessing they're looking for other places for their phishes. The fake
Googles are pretty slick, even error pages from their IP addresses are
carefully done.

Thanks,
Mike

Message-ID: <4BDC51BD.5090300@pippiandcarlos.com>

I need to build a cluster for parallel processing (i.e. not high
availability). It will run MatLab and SPM. Is LinuxPMI a good solution? I am
naturally drawn to it because OpenMosix was cool, and I'm really leaning
toward open source. Thankfully, Linux has been mandated by the customer.

Any experience with Oracle GridEngine? It gets a mention in an email from
the customer. Either they know what they're doing, or they totally don't.
I've been meaning to build a cluster as a learning exercise for some time
now, but unfortunately I have never gotten around to it. So my hands-on
knowledge is lacking. I could use some backup for my argument that an open
source solution would be better than the Oracle product.

Um... I think that probably is Google.

Your netstat output is showing that a remote system is talking to you
from port 80 to one of your high numbered ports.  This almost
certainly means a client on your machine connected to port 80 on the
remote machine and used an automatically selected local port number.
It's probably just your web browser talking to Google.  To find out
what process is talking to those hosts for sure, try:

# lsof -i -n

HTH,

Subject: [PLUG] KDE apps on Gnome
Message-ID: <20100501103952.6824063c@mailhost.pdx.edu>

Fedora 11 x86_64, up to date, with Gnome desktop. 

Everything works, including the KDE apps that I have installed.
However, the window menu font in the KDE apps is too large - nearly
twice the size of the window menu font in other applications. By "window
font" I mean the font used for "File, Edit, View," and other
app-specific menus. The title bar is using the same font as other apps,
so the window manager (Metacity) appears to be doing its job. For some
reason the KDE apps are ignoring the Gnome settings for default
application menu font. 

I have looked everywhere for a control panel for KDE, but cannot find
it. Of course, why would there be a KDE control panel when I am using
Gnome? Maybe the installation of the KDE apps failed to add something
needed to control the KDE application menu display.

Any suggestions welcome.

Hmmm... learned something new. I went a step further (inspired by your
lsof idea) and tried the following command to identify the process

netstat -atump 

And they all link back to Firefox. So you're correct. Thank you!

But that leaves one remaining question - 

Why do these processes appear in the netstat output --only-- when Apache
is running?

Thanks,
Mike

On my centos box /usr/bin/kcontrol was provided by  kdebase.

Thanks. But it didn't work. I installed kdebase, but kcontrol was
apparently not included.

I searched in Yumex for "KDE, settings" which turned up some
possibilities, one of which was kdebase-workspace. But when I tried to
install it I got a message that it was "removing for dependencies"
several things, including ktorrent. Ktorrent is what I plan to replace
Vuze with, so that won't do. Ktorrent is also one of the KDE apps with
huge fonts. Then I looked more closely and realized it was also going
to remove kdebase-workspace. Apparently it was already installed.
(There is a bug in Yumex which makes it fail to display installed apps
in a different color.)

I tried several of the other possibilities yielded by the search, but
they were either already installed, or were tools to go the other
direction, that is, to make Gnome apps work correctly in KDE.

I also tried the KDE main page, where I found a link to KDE forums.
Unfortunately the forums have the world's most useless search engine.
Google also hasn't helped.

I seem to recall once having a KDE GUI control panel, but it was a long
time ago in my Ubuntu days. I don't know where it came from, because
I have always used the Gnome desktop.

It also occurred to me to try "locate kcontrol." This yielded a couple
pages of files and folders. However, all appear to be help files or
icons. None seem to be a configuration tool.

Finally figured it out. I kept getting "no such application or file"
when I typed "kcontrol" at the command line. I had installed
kdebase-workspace, but still nada.

It turns out that with KDE 4.x kcontrol has become systemsettings.
Typing "systemsettings" at the command line popped up the KDE
configuration GUI. Then all I had to do was change the default fonts,
the same as I can do for Gnome.

Tried systemsettings? 

On KUbuntu that's the swiss army knife system configuration  app.
Desktop is the module that customizes fonts I believe. Or maybe
Appearance

   All fixed. She filled her ~/ with audio cd files, so I made a new

   Yesterday I upgraded to 10.4 and seamonkey once again works.

You say same domain name are you looking for resolver DNS hosts for
use at home for browsing or DNS hosting for a domain name that you
own?

I would have to guess that is a coincidence. If you stop apache and browse
to google, the connections should show up in netstat. If they didn't, I

I'm using openDns and I must say that I'm fairly impressed with what I'm
getting considering that I'm using the basic free service.  Most of the
sites I know about that I consider inappropriate are inaccessible with
openDns.  I'd guess that the service is at least 90% effective at
categorizing web sites properly.

I think what is more interesting beyond the filtering power, something
you may or may not need, is that the service apparently protects against
phishing sites.

My only complaint is that I should be able to tell my ISP to get the
service for me and my ISP should make sure that I can only access the
openDNS name servers.

Thinks like Tor may make the utility of openDns questionable, but I
guess that depends on your environment and your needs.  Tor is limited.

here's an excerpt from a paper i wrote up on advantages of using
opendns:

OpenDNS provides a top-notch service, and their servers handle nearly 20
billion DNS requests daily, with excellent response times and impressive
reliability. OpenDNS really sweetens the pot with it?s big list of
available features, though. Even with free accounts, OpenDNS users who
create an account have:

      * ability to track web usage statistics (or turn them off entirely
        if you?re concerned with privacy)
      * protection against phishing and malware sites
      * the ability to set shortcuts (i.e. just type ?mail? and your
        shortcut will take you to your favorite mail site,
        mail.yahoo.com)
      * typo correction
      * effective web content filtering with a huge array of categories
        to allow you to choose what content is accessible on the
        network.
      * customizable search pages for unresolvable addresses, mine has a
        picture of my cat

you can see that opendns offers a lot more than just dns w/ their public
service. 

and michael, forgive me if i'm wrong, but isn't tor more oriented toward
obscuring activity than any of the above services? all i remember about
tor from the brief period i had used it was that it bogged down the
internet speed abysmally.

The whole point of Tor is to allow people to use the Net without being
traceable to their point of origin.  By default, openDns blocks
accessing sites about Tor and other web anonymizers as filtering and
anonymizing tend to be counter productive activities.  In order to
effectively filter via openDns, your source has to be identified.  For
users of Tor, the source isn't identifiable.  That is the point of Tor
if it actually works.

The number one customer for openDns I would say is the concerned parent
or business.  The number one customer for Tor, the "Adult" entertainment
industry.  This is not to say that Tor doesn't have legitimate uses such
as covering the identity of human rights workers and concealing the
identity of people in China trying to get past state censors who
arguably aren't always right.

I frankly question whether Tor should be allowed without any back
doors and without the volunteer anonymizing relays behind it taking 
at least some responsibility for the content going through their 
relays.  Granted, their is an argument for not having a back door.
Thing is, the bad guys will use Tor.  So what if bot nets are a
better way to get your message or SPAM out anonymously?

The major concern with Tor and other anonymizers is that people who are
nuisances on the Net and people who are addicted to certain things on
the net will probably be the first, not the last people to use it.
OpenDns is one of the few services I know about where the person
addicted to XYZ on the Net can have it filtered out without losing much.
Dansguardian and ProCon Latte are poor alternatives that block too 
much legitimate activity and they are fairly trivial to bypass.

I brought up Tor as a possible con to using openDns in some situations
as Tor effectively defeats openDns.  Tor will defeat any third party
filter like openDns.  Tor is something I want to research from the
ethics standpoint as the issues concerning Tor are not black and white,
there is a lot of controversy.  The use of geolocation by some
communities for example to implement standards for web content 
is easily defeated by Tor.

People argue that the purpose of Tor is to protect free speech, but I am
cynical about protecting anonymous free speech and offering people
anonymous web surfing.  What about the right not to listen to or read
something coming to you over the Net?  SPAM is a common abuse of that
right.

Ironically enough, some migh consider your off-topic ramblings regarding
free speech and who the #1 customer of TOR / OpenDNS is to be SPAM and
"violating their right not to listen or reas something coming to them
over the Net". Which even more ironically, is not actually a
consititunally protected right....

Message-ID: <4BDE32EB.3040003@comcast.net>

I downloaded Ubuntu 10.04 and installed it on my test machine. When it 
finished it asked me to restart. When I clicked that button I saw a 
screen full of disk error messages, at which point the machine hung.

I powered down, and powered back up.

I get the login screen, can enter my password, but then it blinks to 
black, back to the default background, and then presents the login 
screen again.

I can select Gnome Failsafe and can successfully log in. But, further 
attempts to log in normally still are stuck in the above mentioned loop.

Recommendations on what to do next are appreciated.

Sounds like a corrupt image.  Did you verify the cd media using the option
during boot-up?
Is this an upgrade or a clean install?

There was an option to do something of that sort after the burn, but I 
clicked the wrong button and it went away. I don't remember that as an 
option during the install.

Clean. A couple of weeks ago I installed Ubuntu 9 on it successfully. 
Before that it had XP.

I briefly tried to test the drive, but was reminded that the partition 
needs to be unmounted to do so. This morning I remembered that the CD 
can be run live, so I'll do that when after dinner, tonight.

When you boot from the CD, after you select your language, there is an
option to check the media for errors.  This is what you want to use.

If the media checks fine, then I would try the install again.  I have seen
weirder things happen.  Doing a fsck on your drive probably wouldn't be a
bad idea either.

Hope all goes well,
  Jason

                         DRBD and Pacemaker part II

                                     by

                               Adam Gandelman
                               www.linbit.com

DRBD stands for Distributed Replicated Block Device.  Mainline since
2.6.33, it is used to replicate data at the block level over the network
in a "network RAID1" fashion.   It is generally deployed as a cost
effective, shared-nothing alternative to a SAN and used as the building
block for high availability clusters. Pacemaker is currently the de
facto open-source cluster resource manager (CRM) for Linux HA
clustering.   With it, nodes and services can be monitored and managed
to ensure maximum uptime in the face of the most severe service and
hardware level failures.  Combining the two allows admins to %99.999
uptime at a fraction of the price of proprietary alternatives.

In LINBIT's second PLUG Advance Topics installment, Adam Gandelman will
give a more in-depth view of DRBD and Pacemaker and demonstrate how they
work closely together to keep applications running and consistent.
During the second half of the presentation, Adam will provide attendees
with a real-world example by configuring a highly-available LAMP cluster
from the ground up. Though geared toward web services, the concepts
presented can easily be expanded to provide the HA gaurantee to
virtually any Linux service.

Agenda: - Brief re-introduction to DRBD, Pacemaker and HA clustering
concepts. - Overview of various use cases and interesting deployments -
Configuration and implementation of a highly-available LAMP cluster
using DRBD for data redundancy and Pacemaker for resource management.

Adam Gandelman is an expert in open-source clustering and high
availability. Originally from New England, Adam lives in Portland, OR
where he has been working at LINBIT, developers of DRBD and maintainers
of Heartbeat. Aside from providing top-level Linux High-Availability and
Disaster Recovery consulting for customers in the Americas, he leads
LINBIT training courses in the US, doubles as a technical writer and
regularly contributes to related open-source projects.

                    A projector has been arranged!

Yes. It's OK, but I prefer Ktorrent. Actually I liked Vuze too, perhaps
even better than Ktorrent. I just can't handle the hourly crashes. I
want to leave it running overnight.

I used to use Ktorrent on Ubuntu, but it had a serious bug that caused
it to spawn multiple copies of some KDE application, until eventually
it used all my 4 GB of RAM. So when I moved from Ubuntu to Fedora I
decided to try something else. I had tried Azureus several times in the
past, but usually couldn't even get it installed. On Fedora it
installed easily and I liked its features. But Ktorrent is almost as
featureful, and it's rock solid.

Vuze is a Java application. Now, I know someone is going to clobber me
for saying this, but I have yet to find a Java application that doesn't
crash or have other major bugs. My theory is that Java itself may be
fine, but it attracts inexperienced programmers. The result is an
application that is a mess. My theory should be considered a WAG
though, because I know so little about programming I wouldn't even try
more than a simple bash script, let alone Java.

   Take a look at jgnuash, a personal finance application. Installs
everywhere (including where Gnucash won't) and runs like the Energizer
bunny. Never had it crash and there are no identified bugs reported on the
mail list.

   You're probably thinking of PHP and Visual Basic. If you want to see a
huge, complex, well-functioning java application take a look at Eclipse
<http://www.eclipse.org/>. Originally developed by IBM it's become a
broadly-used development platform.

Just did that. And also ran md5sum against the iso (I know, I should 
have done that before I burned the CD. The md5sum matched the published 
one. Both were successful.

I thought I'd be able to run fsck from the live CD, but it wants me to 
log in. I haven't seen anything anywhere to use as the user name and 
password. I tried guest with no password, ubuntu with no password, and 
the username I used when I installed 10.04 on that machine. None of them 
work.

Does someone know which doormat to lift up to find the key?

Many have commented that osu.osl and other servers are faster after the
initial few hours after a major release like Lucid. 

That is probably true. But I am still seeding. Interestingly, over the
past couple of days I have uploaded zero of the alternative and desktop
versions. However, the take for Edubuntu has been heavy, and almost as
heavy for Mythbuntu, especially the 32-bit versions. The 32-bit netbook
version is also popular. And overall the download rate for 32-bit is
about three times the rate for the 64-bit versions.

More interesting is watching who I am feeding. This morning I noticed
someone from India downloading Edubuntu 32-bit. They had 32%, and now
at 6 pm they are up to 48%. I see a great many from the less developed
parts of the world, usually downloading slowly. I have lived in such
countries. Dial-up is usually all that is available, and the phone
system hangs up a lot. A good thing about torrents is that if you lose
your connection it can be restarted without issue.

Osu.osl and cat.pdx.edu are great for us. But I'll continue seeding for
the benefit of those with less fortunate technology. It's a tiny thing,
but I think that doing a favor for people in other countries makes them
respect us more than throwing bombs at them. Besides, the cost to me is
zero.

The Spirit of Tek
May 03, 2010, 9:00 PM

In 1946 the field of electronics was exploding. Radiomen Howard Vollum
and Jack Murdock were home from the War and decided to start their own
business. The company was Tektronix. The product? An indispensable
piece of test equipment that engineers couldn't work without. In The
Spirit of Tek you'll meet some of the people who built a unique
company that changed the world.

Just type sudo bash in the terminal.  I don't think it will ask for a

Back in the late 1970's and early 1980's, I worked with a man who had 
also been a radioman in WWII and knew Howard Vollum. After the war, 
Morey Hanen had a TV repair shop in Hillsboro and said that Howard used 
to stop in and visit once in a while.

Morey said that Howard had no idea that Tektronix was going to become 
the company that it did. At one time, the height of Mr. Vollum's 
ambitions were summed up when he told Morey: "There are 52 TV stations 
in the United States, and I think I can sell one of my oscilloscopes to 
every one of them".

Another Vollum connection, my mother was Jean Vollum's gardener for
the last 10 or 15 years of Mrs Vollum's life.  I visited their house a
couple times.

Jean Vollum was one of the people that yanked their funding of OPB
during the axing of music programming on their radio station back in
the mid-1990s. 

Maybe that's why, following the link that promisingly says, "Watch
Online":

  http://www.opb.org/programs/oregonexperience/programs/player/29-The-Spirit-of-Tek

all you get is a 30-second tease.

Bastards!

   Providing missing information is not the same as clobbering. Your
assumption was unfounded and I provided correcting information. No flames,
no put-downs.

Rock (www.rocksclusters.org) is worth a look.  I worked at a place
that used it and found it a good clustering solution.

Russell:
You might try it again. There was a link on the page to see a preview, 
or you could watch the entire program. Maybe they didn't have the entire 
program available at the time that you checked or maybe you mistakenly 
clicked on the "Watch a Preview" choice.

Thank you. I have not heard of this one. Will read all about it.

second that suggestion--rocks rocks.  but it really shines when you
have a lot of nodes coming and going and a need to do large-scale
infrastructure management, have a built-in monitoring and batch
queuing software, etc.

if you're just doing a little 4-node cluster to run a bunch of jobs
for a single user, it's pretty overkill.  i'd just use your distro of
choice and make sure fast fileservice is available.  that's how we did
it back before clustering was a buzzword, in the 90's.

i had no clue what SPM was so i didn't answer before, but it doesn't
sound to me like you need any cluster specific software at all.
especially not something as complicated as mosix or SGE, er, OGE?

Message-ID: <4BE0CD02.5080406@gmail.com>

All,

Thank you for the thoughtful responses to my questions about a 
"misguided article" that I had read.  You folks always find a way to dig 
to the heart of an issue.

The one real concern I had was if the 'buntus were going the way of 
Microsoft.  As far as Canonical making money...more power to them.  I 
too am happy with Ubuntu.  It just works.  Like many pointed out, I have 
been using the 'buntus long enough to have figured out how to configure 
them to my satisfaction.  I am also running Fedora 12 and find it to be 
stable and fast for the things I am doing.

One of my goals is to continue learning more about Linux.  Like most of 
us, I have limited time and, for now, that means finding different 
distributions and learning them.  You all provided some ideas for the 
next selections.  I have dabbled a bit with Sidux and will probably 
return to it at some point.

I just finally found a few moments to go back and read all the replies 
in one shot.  I wanted to say thanks for the thoughtful replies!

Bruce

Subject: [PLUG] Xen Hypervisor
Message-ID: <4BE2123E.2020206@robertmarktech.com>

All,

I've been thinking of switching from vmware server to full 
virtualization on my laptop using Xen. I would have the Xen hypervisor 
running and then Dom0 running a linux flavor with my virtual machines 
converted to Xen guests. Is anyone Xen? Do you think this would be 
feasible? What linux flavor would you recommend as Dom0?

I need to run Windows Servers, an XP, and a two Unix guests. I think 
performance would be better using Xen over vmware server, as the 
overhead of the current OS (Ubuntu) goes away with the Xen setup.

thanks,

I decided to try a Kubuntu install along side of the Ubuntu install. The 
installation was more successful this time, but only in the sense that I 
didn't get a screen full of error messages.

Unfortunately, Kubuntu 10.04 suffers from the same problem as Ubuntu 
10.04 -- when installed on my machine, ymmv. I can get to the login 
screen, but when I try logging in I'm returned to the login screen. This 
time, when trying to log in via failsafe mode, the machine hangs.

If anyone has any ideas, I'd like to hear them.

Thanks.

I have had that problem before, but only when I was reusing a home
directory.  Check the permissions on your .ICEauthority file in your home
directory, if reusing the directory.  I have had success in deleting or
renaming this file in the past, but you may want to simply change
permissions if you find it belongs to root and not to you.

Good luck,
 Jason

Red Hat and related distributions (Fedora, CentOS) are switching to 
KVM. I don't know if the switch says anything about Xen's long-term 
non-Red Hat prospects -- but if you're commited to Xen, Red Hat is 
definitely not the way to go.

Debian stable (lenny) has good Xen support, and it's likely to be 
around for a while. I suspect the LTS versions of Ubuntu are in the 
same boat.

Actually, that's not the case for Ubuntu either, the preferred solution
there also being KVM. Running as a paravirt guest is supported,
if for no other reason than to work with Amazon's EC2 service. I
*think* the 8.04 LTS was the last release to have a dom0 kernel,
and even that I believe was in universe, not main.

The other thing to watch for when running a Xen dom0 on your laptop,
assuming it matters to you, is to make sure stuff like suspend/resume
still works; an ex co-worker of mine tried to do it a few years ago,
and found that it broke it for him, whereas suspend/resume would work
normally with the same kernel not running as dom0. I haven't followed
Xen development to see if they're more careful now about such issues.

Message-ID: <4BE2B84F.2050809@comcast.net>

Another gripe I have with my Lucid Lynx dual boot install attempts is 
that Grub uses the same words to describe both Ubuntu and Kubuntu! I 
guessed, and was correct, that the first two (normal and failsafe) on 
Grub's list were for the most recent install. They are followed by 
memtest (two versions, I think), and then what looks exactly like the 
first two lines. I'll discover if they really are for the first Ubuntu 
install when I try again this evening.

I assume there's a way to edit something to provide some additional 
information, but I'll have to look into that later.

Both were full installs. The first one, Ubuntu, was allowed to take over 
the whole drive. The second, Kubuntu, was told to install itself 
side-by-side with the other one.

I'll look into that tonight. I'll have to boot into Gnome failsafe and 
look around. I'll also have to dust off the command line reference card

FWIW, I think KVM is easier to implement, as it's just a few kernel
modules, as opposed to a completely separate kernel. Last time I tried
Xen, it didn't work with a lot of network cards. It was especially
incompatible with wireless cards. Anything that's tied to a certain
version of a kernel has to be done separately for Xen.

In the transition, Red Hat has made sure its tools (virt-install,
virt-manager, virsh) work just as well with KVM. And when I've tried it
with M$, I've felt no difference. If I remember right, Ubuntu has
adapted the same tools.

One of the issues with Xen is that its owner, Citrix, is especially cozy
with Microsoft. If I remember right, some of the enterprise-level Xen
admin tools now work only on MS systems (despite their continued use of
the Linux kernel source code for the actual VMs).

Thanks,
Mike

Which tree, "stable" or "unstable"? I've always preferred stable for
servers, since it's generally less of a hassle (timely security
updates, without the need for much maintenance otherwise).
backports.org usually suffices when I need a version of a package
that's less ancient than what Debian has in the stable tree.

http://backports.org/

The only source I usually add to my desktop (unstable) systems is
debian-multimedia.org (codecs, players, etc.).

Since Ubuntu now uses Grub 2.0, it's somewhat of a pain in the
whatchamacallit. You'll need to edit files in the /etc/grub.d/
directory. One method is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Grub2#User-defined%
20Entries

I personally switched to grub because it provided a shell that you
could use at boot time to crawl the filesystem looking for kernels,
initrds, etc. and construct a bootline that didn't exist in your
configuration.  This saved me from issues a number of times.
(Granted, this was also back when I generally used custom-built
kernels, so the potential for screwing up my lilo config was a lot
higher than it is with the distro-supplied kernels.)

Lilo may well support that sort of thing now, I have no idea.

Yup, last stable release as of Feb 2007. Nevertheless, LPI still tests
LILO in its Level 1 and 2 exams. Despite objections, some of the people
behind LPI claim that LILO is still in common use.

Last I checked, LILO doesn't support encrypted password protection,
making it a rather weak bootloader w/r/t security. But that's just me.
I'm half wondering if/when to move to TrustedGRUB.

Thanks,

I was a bit slow to move from lilo to grub, but I moved years ago.
grub is a much richer boot loader and at this point much better
supported.  However, lilo works and deserves more respect than it
gets.  Even in recent years, I have encountered a situation or two
where lilo seemed to be the better boot loader for the situation.
However, that is rare.  In most situations, grub is much better than
lilo at this point.

OpenSuSE has good Xen support built into it at both the kernel level
and the administrative level.  (That is, there is Xen support built
into openSuSE's admin tools - yast and yast2).
The current version of OpenSuSE (openSuSE 11.2) still uses Xen as it's
preferred virtualization, but I expect this will change to KVM as most
everyone seems to be changing.

I have used Xen - sometimes successfully and sometimes not so
successfully.  Xen works very well once implemented, but it can be a
bit difficult to implement.  At times I have had trouble building
virtual machines and getting all the networking straight and what not.
 And I have had trouble when I was running on old hardware that
required running in paravirtualized mode.

As a result, I use VMWare server a good deal more the Xen.  But, I
have had very good experience with both of these virtualization
packages.  And although I have had pain with each of these packages,
they both work well and I am not shy about using either of them on
production machines.

Of course,  KVM seems to be the future and I will probably be there someday.

Subject: [PLUG] VPN security questions for laptops
Message-ID: <AANLkTin33DWdag--3IWRhigKrK3CW45EvhIUY07CVSql@mail.gmail.com>

Folks and IP security gurus:

I need to find a good firewall with VPN capabilities for a start up LLC.  I
have had experience with the Cisco ASA 5505 security appliance (fancy name
for firewall), but found that its software limits your configuration
capabilities.

I looked at a NetDefender DFL-860 from Dlink this morning, but it's complex
and hard to configure.

In the past I had someone make up a small private box that ran some generic
linux OS and ClarkConnect's firewall and am familiar with them, but they've
changed to Clear OS and I know nothing about the new team or company.

Do you have any recommendations?  We are trying to set up something with
remote VPN client capabilities to contact a central VPN server, but not
break the bank nor get tied into a 2 year security software contract that
takes $oodles everytime you upgrade or attempt to stay current.

If there are any other ideas, please speak up.  We will have laptops in the
field but want to lock them down fairly securely.  (I hope to avoid putting
that other OS on them)

How about OpenVPN plus iptables?  We find OpenVPN to be quite flexible
and stable in our small business's network.

If you don't like iptables, you could PF under one of the BSDs or
even Debian GNU/kFreeBSD (which will be fully supported in the
imminent release).

I think the OP ought to answer the "what VPN will we use?" question 
before we can provide serious answers.

I like (and use) OpenVPN -- it's easy to deploy on Linux, Windows, and 
Mac (via Tunnelblick) -- but some shops use ipsec or other 
technologies.

When I set my VPN up, it cost less than $200. It involved OpenBSD,
OpenVPN, and an embedded system from Soekris Engineering
(http://www.soekris.com/net4501.htm). I've found that the box I used
can't really handle hundreds of connections, but it can handle at
least a few. The company  also offers boards with more memory and
faster processors (and thus more connections).

Hello Randall,
Take a look at Fortigate 60. (fortinet.com)

Super easy to setup Site-to- Site VPN
            easy to Setup IPSEC VPN
            And
It comes with SSL-VPN also, super easy to setup.
Along with many other features ...

You do not need contract for any of the above listed options to function.

You can find on Ebay for 200$ or less.

Look for Fortigate 60 (B)  that is the newer model with 2 WAN interfaces ,
DMZ, and 4 trusted interfaces, that you can eventually dedicate each one of
them to a specific network...

Hope that helps,
Isaac

I once setup a virtual server hosting service with Xen so I'm pretty
familiar with it.  It can be a real pain to get a lot of things
working right.  I would second the opinion that KVM is the way to go.
It's relatively painless by comparison.

What about performance? Isn't the Xen hypervisor simply a stripped down 
linux kernel with Xen? I would think that you would get better 
performance through the Xen hypervisor with direct hardware pass through 
than KVM and a full blown linux install. Is that not true?

In my experience, the real-world performance difference approaches 
zero for anything but a highly loaded server.

In fact, if I was pushing a VM hard enough and often enough for the 
differences to matter, I wouldn't be running a VM. :-)

I'll second this one as a viable option. I have a client using a Fortinet
product for firewall/VPN. I forget the exact model. I think it was
selected because it had both Windows and Mac support but I got it working
with Linux as well. I thought I saw where it supported under *nix's as
well but I can't say for sure.

I'll warn you that Fortinet makes it hard to find the Linux VPN client
software on their site. It's called forticlientsslvpn.

I have used Mantis as a user, not as a developer, and I was not in
charge of it. I found it easy to navigate, simple enough for ordinary
users of a program, and it has a good search ability.

For an example of it in use and a bug I reported:

http://bugs.scribus.net/view.php?id=8114

I have often tried to post bugs for other programs and found the bug
tracking system so incomprehensible that I gave up.

Portland City Hall + computers = endless fun

<http://cityofportland.ebidsystems.com/public/solicitationdetail.asp?solicitation=OMF059>Here's 
<http://cityofportland.ebidsystems.com/public/solicitationdetail.asp?solicitation=OMF059> 
an odd one out of the Portland fire bureau. They're going on a 
fishing expedition to see if they can find somebody to convert the 
bureau computer system from some homegrown products created using a 
now-obsolete Microsoft program to open source software. But they're 
not even offering a contract at this point -- they just want some 
free advice in the form of "information" to be submitted by potential 
future contract bidders.

   So, you tell them "yes, it can be done and it will cost less than the
Water Bureau paid for their new system." How's that for information?

You, of course, never go into Sears or Fry's, look at their stuff, talk 
to their sales people, use their restrooms, then go buy something from 
someone else entirely.

Of course they're fishing for info!  They probably have absolutely no 
clue about how hard the job is, or where they can find someone who knows 
Visual Basic (eugh!) well enough to convert it to Python or whatever is 
appropriate, or what the rough magnitude of the task is, or anything.

Whenever I'm in that situation the first thing I do is call up 
salespeople and consume their valuable time looking for rough order of 
magnitude estimates (which can be hard to get: "gimme a ballpark 
estimate" "I'm sorry sir, but we have to come out and look at your house 
and..." "tell me if it's going to be $1000, $3000, $10000, etc." "Oh! 
you can expect it to be between X and Y, then").

I wish them well.  I wonder how ugly the code is?

Subject: 	[pdx-groups] Please Distribute: Portland Software Census

From: 	Audrey Eschright


Hi everyone,

Some of you may already have seen this on Twitter, but a group of us
have been working on a PDX Software Community Census for the city's
economic development efforts. We have an announcement we'd like you to
share with your user groups and post on blogs. It's important that we
get the widest response we can, and we're trying to get people to take
it ASAP so we can share it before the PDC's next round of "software
cluster" meetings. Thanks!

Here's the text:

If you're involved with Portland's software community, you know that
there's an amazing variety and depth of work being created at companies
large and small, in hobby side-projects, and open source efforts. The
City of Portland has selected software as one of its economic
development clusters for the economic plan currently being written.
Agencies like the Portland Development Commission (PDC) are involved in
documenting our software community and developing a plan for working
with it, but they lack accurate data on the types of software
development local organizations are undertaking, and have limited
experience with the kinds of small companies, ad hoc organizations, and
independent work that forms much of our technology efforts.

We'd like to assist the PDC and City of Portland efforts by initiating a
software community census to:

     * Gather some basic demographics about Portland's tech community

     * Flesh out what work people are doing and for whom

     * Build a baseline so we can quantitatively track the community's
       breadth and depth


How can you participate?

     * Take the survey <http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/KTGSH9Q%20> at
       http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/KTGSH9Q before May 17

     * Spread the word to your colleages, coworkers and friends

     * We will be posting the results online, so check back with Silicon
       Florist and your community tech organizations for details.


What do we get out of this? This census will:

     * Ensure economic development efforts are targeted to what our
       industry actually needs

     * Provide data that can be used to assess the success of economic
       development efforts

     * Create an accurate picture of our amazing tech community (and give
       us bragging rights at OSCON).

     * Market Portland to companies like Involver
       <http://www.involver.com/start> who are coming to check out
       Portland <http://portland.beerandblog.com/>!


How our work fits into the City of Portland's plans:

     * Software is the of the 5 clusters identified in Portland Economic
       Development Plan. It is the cluster that is least well defined in
       the plan.

     * PDC took the first step with their survey. Now we are helping them
       flesh out their results and better target their efforts.

Carlos,

Have you looked at the /etc/rsyslog.conf file?  That's where the logging 
is configured in Debian.

Thanks! I found this in there:

#
# Emergencies are sent to everybody logged in.
#
*.emerg                *

and commented it out. I'll see if it did the trick tomorrow. I'm at home
right now, and it appears that ssh shells aren't being spammed.

If it didn't help, don't forget to restart your syslogger before
losing hope.  From a brief glance it appears that kill -HUP won't work
on rsyslog due to the way it drops privileges upon startup (so it
can't read protected files and reopen privileged sockets once it's
done that).

Does Hauppage produce any PCI tuner cards that work in 98SE?
I guess I need Windows 2000 to use the Hauppage WinTV-PVR 150.
The alternative is to use Linux where I have an LFS system that
is PIII optimized.  If I can get Windows 98SE drivers for this
Hauppage tuner card, that would be really nice.

Message-ID: <1273975211.20110.13.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

My dad has one of those fancy quad core 64 bit Windows 7 laptops.  I
have a Pentium III optimized LFS system which I can back up Windows and
Linux systems with as long as the computer is a Pentium III or IV.  Will
a Pentium III Linux kernel boot a quad core computer???

I am using dd to dump entire hard drives, this is space intensive though
and I end up backing up fragmentation.  Is there a better way that is as
powerful as hard drive imaging?  Using dd is brute forcing the problem,
but this is a safe way to back a system up.

If I need a 64 bit Linux kernel and a 64 bit optimized NFS mountable
Linux filesystem, how do I produce those on a 32 bit computer?  Is it
possible to produce an Apple G3 compatible Linux system on a PIII based
Linux server?  How about network booting a PC164 Alpha system?

In general, I'm curious how to trick the Linux kernel source into
compiling on one computer for a totally different kind of computer.

Message-ID: <20100515193620.0c2e68d5@mailhost.pdx.edu>

Apparently torrent trackers are soon to be history, and the new thing
will be magnet links. 

I just switched back to Ktorrent from Vuze due to the instability of
Vuze, only to discover that Ktorrent cannot handle magnet links. Vuze
can, but apparently it's one of only a few torrent clients that is
magnet link capable.

I am still able to download without magnet links, but sooner or later
I'm going to have to figure them out. Apparently I'm also going to have
to get Firefox to understand them also. 

Does anyone have a bittorrent client and browser that are working with
magnet links? If so, how did you do it?

What does lmgtfy mean?  

I want to be able to include my Dad's laptop in my network based backup
system which is made up of a network bootable Linux system and a large
backup area.  For obvious reasons, installing Linux on my Dad's laptop
even just to export that installation to a server is not a realistic
option.

Short of talking Dad into buying a second internal hard drive for his
computer and taking the Windows 7 drive out temporarily so I can install
64 bit Linux, how am I going to put together a 64 bit Linux system
without a 64 bit quad core computer?  I'm sure I'm not the only person
who cannot realistically buy a quad core computer just to facilitate
installing 64 bit Linux to it to then export that system over a network.
What if I had a really expensive mainframe computer with Windows on it
and I couldn't justify buying another one just in case?  Heterogeneous
Linux/Windows networks are common where the difficulty of getting all
the machines backed up is nothing new.

This problem isn't so far out where I would appreciate it if people
wouldn't resort to vague and probably colorful metaphors.

LMGTFY = Let Me Google That For You
(as in, go to www.google.com and enter search terms...)

And if you click on the link, it pulls up a Google search with the terms:
cross compiling linux kernels

which seems apropos for what you are asking.

Also, another angle, you are asking about backup strategy for a 64 bit Win7
machine to a 32 bit Linux machine.
That doesn't necessarily require cross compiling, it just requires a backup
solution that is cross platform.

Michael -

I wasn't trying to use colorful metaphors nor not trying to be
unhelpful. The very end of your query was about building 64 bit
kernels on a 32 bit machine which would require cross compiling, hence
the link to facilitate your search to help build upon the knowledge
you'll need.

Since you have a network with storage, perhaps setting up Samba and
using Windows built in backup facilities to store the image that is
created on the network? Maybe that would be a viable solution given my
understanding of your network. If you can provide additional details
about exactly how things are laid out specifically in relation to this
particular task then we might be able to offer better tips and
suggestions.

Drew-

Sorry, I didn't know what the acronym meant.  I tried googling, but the
information I'm getting appears to be very old.  I'm trying to build a
backup system via network that allows me to do bare metal recovery.
I.E., Windows 7 gets trashed and as soon as a new hard drive that
works is put in, it is time to restore the last known good copy.  

Notice I'm not saying reinstall, but restore.  In order to restore,
potentially to a new hard drive of equal or greater size, there is
a need to replace the boot sector and all the data.  The backup 
system isn't just being set up for Windows, my personal system 
runs Fedora.  I'd like to support backing up my brother's Sunflower 
G3 Mac as well running Mac OSX 10.3 I believe.

Right now, I'm trying to get my level 0 raid to persist across reboots.
I have a terabyte decimal of storage using two WD PATA 500G hard drives,
which is about 900 gigs binary.  Last time I rebooted, the hard drives 
in the raid volume came up as having no superblock.

I probably will have to google for this, but off hand, does anyone know
if a terabyte exceeds what ext3 can handle for a single filesystem?

I'm running CentOS 5.5 on the server.

This might be a better option that dd'ing the drive which seems rather
ugly (but I get why you're doing it)

http://www.openfiler.com/ or similar. Once I have the funds to build
up a backup box I'm going with something like this. I'm using a cheap
Netgear SAN right now.

Reading the docs for clonezilla, that seems like it might be the way
to go. Export your NFS partition(s), boot the live CD/USB and write
the backup image to it.

Clonezilla is interesting, but why use a usb flash key or CD when I have
a PXE server?  Appears that I have stabilized my raid 0 volume.  I am
experimenting with Linux's NTFS support and tar.  If I don't go the dd
route, how can I restore the boot sector?  One thought for XP is to do a
partial reinstall so that the boot sector gets created, PXE boot, and
then erasing whatever files exist on the XP partition restore from
backup.  Using tar over dd, the backup speed seems to be slower.
However, I can back up less overall as I don't have to store empty 
space.  I guess the real question is, how safe is Linux's NTFS support
at this point?  Can I safely write using a tar archive to an offline
NTFS partition (mounted in Linux, not in Windows)?

The ntfs-3g module for NTFS read and write support is pretty good
although I can't speak to the specific task you're trying to achieve.

I'm not sure why you're wanting to use a PXE setup, it seems as if
you're making this needlessly complicated but to each their own. If
that setup works for you, then that's great. Something like live
booting clonezilla just automates imaging the box to a remote
filesystem and accomplishes the same task as dd'ing without wasting
space copying empty blocks.

Maybe others can chime in here about their backup and disaster
recovery plans and layouts that might be something at least worth
exploring. The more ideas the better. I use Norton Ghost to backup my
Windows laptop and my parents laptop to an external drive and then
keep a duplicate copy of the image on the NAS which is configured for
RAID for extra redundancy [ although now that I've found this FOSS
alternative I'm going to move to that ] . I sync my Linux box using
SVN to a remote server I own that's co-located in a data center, I
don't care about binaries just my personal project code and custom
configuration files.

Yes (Chrome + uTorrent), but under Windows 7, which isn't a very
helpful answer.  Transmission (Linux / OS X) supports magnet links as
of v1.8.  If Firefox doesn't know how to handle magnet links, you
probably have to edit about:config to add that capability.  I'm sure
you can find instructions lots of places.  Not sure if would work
out-of-the-box with Chromium; with Chrome on Windows, it worked
without any fiddling.

(I haven't had time to try installing Linux on my laptop yet, so for
the moment I'm in Windows land.)

I have since discovered that there are three bittorrent clients for
Linux that can do magnet links: Vuze (need 4.3+ for 64-bit links),
Transmission and Deluge.

I have them all installed, and I have managed to add a plugin to
Firefox so it will download a link, but so far none of the three
bittorrent clients can see the link. 

I also found instructions for manually editing about:config in Firefox
to enable it to send the link directly to the bittorrent client, but
the instructions didn't work.

Just about every place I read about magnet links on Linux indicates
that it's easy to get working and everyone posting reports success. I
guess I can't do the easy things. Wait ... I can't do hard things
either. Bah.

I prefer PXE over a CD plus a backup box or worse an external hard drive
because:

1) Using network based booting and backup doesn't involve carrying hard
drives or other media around that can get lost or dropped.

2) Keeping the backup source/destination drive off of the machine being
backed up, it is less likely that one is going to accidentally:
overwrite it, partition it, or erase it.

3) I don't have to potentially buy a hard disk for every single computer
I want to back up.

4) I can back up multiple machines simultaneously, although this does
slow my server down a lot.

5) I don't want to be forced into having a DVD drive on every single
computer I want to back up and restore let alone a writer.  The Alpha
and the G3 Mac are probably not going to work with a single boot cd.
I'm actually worried about whether or not PXE is available for these
platforms.

I'm after both a simple and powerful solution.  Having a Linux command
line and useful tools at your fingertips is a powerful approach.  I can
do more than just perform backups and do restoration work, I have
network monitoring tools as well.  I'm hoping that dd isn't the only way
I can back up an NTFS volume and restore it.  The best I can do if I'm
forced to go the dd route is compress the resulting images with bzip2.

The idea behind network booting is to run off a stable system that is
not on the potentially messed up local hard drive.  There is no need to
find a boot disk/CD/DVD.  This isn't entirely true, I have some
computers that are going to need a PXE disk potentially.

I dimly remember reading some compiler manual, where there was a 
command-line argument or some language enhancement that would make the 
compiler emit a library with each function as a separate entity.  
Similar to making your own set of 10-line 'c' files, then compiling them 
all, then making a library.

I thought it was gcc -- but it was a long long time ago.

Am I all wet?  Do I have to do this the old fashioned way?

Well if I understand original post then you just plan on PXE booting
your fathers new machine using the CentOS box and performing the
backup correct? You don't need to worry about 32 bit vs 64 bit as you
should have no issue running a 32 bit OS on 64 bit hardware you simply
don't get the benefits afforded by the newer, better hardware. As far
booting the Mac as long as the installed NIC support PXE you shouldn't
have a problem doing it. I seriously doubt that the Alpha will be able
to do that though.

                                PRESENTATION

                         DRBD and Pacemaker part II

                                     by

                               Adam Gandelman
                               www.linbit.com

DRBD stands for Distributed Replicated Block Device.  Mainline since
2.6.33, it is used to replicate data at the block level over the network
in a "network RAID1" fashion.   It is generally deployed as a cost
effective, shared-nothing alternative to a SAN and used as the building
block for high availability clusters. Pacemaker is currently the de
facto open-source cluster resource manager (CRM) for Linux HA
clustering.   With it, nodes and services can be monitored and managed
to ensure maximum uptime in the face of the most severe service and
hardware level failures.  Combining the two allows admins to %99.999
uptime at a fraction of the price of proprietary alternatives.

In LINBIT's second PLUG Advance Topics installment, Adam Gandelman will
give a more in-depth view of DRBD and Pacemaker and demonstrate how they
work closely together to keep applications running and consistent.
During the second half of the presentation, Adam will provide attendees
with a real-world example by configuring a highly-available LAMP cluster
from the ground up. Though geared toward web services, the concepts
presented can easily be expanded to provide the HA gaurantee to
virtually any Linux service.

Agenda: - Brief re-introduction to DRBD, Pacemaker and HA clustering
concepts. - Overview of various use cases and interesting deployments -
Configuration and implementation of a highly-available LAMP cluster
using DRBD for data redundancy and Pacemaker for resource management.

Adam Gandelman is an expert in open-source clustering and high
availability. Originally from New England, Adam lives in Portland, OR
where he has been working at LINBIT, developers of DRBD and maintainers
of Heartbeat. Aside from providing top-level Linux High-Availability and
Disaster Recovery consulting for customers in the Americas, he leads
LINBIT training courses in the US, doubles as a technical writer and
regularly contributes to related open-source projects.

                    A projector has been arranged!

The humble indie bundle is a great deal (these games are just now
going OSS, they were commercial):

http://www.wolfire.com/humble

and the Linux game tome is a good place to keep up with the state of
Linux gaming:

http://happypenguin.org

If you haven't tried it, Battle for Wesnoth is a fun OSS strategy game
that meets my expectations for a 2d commercial game :)

Depending on what you are after, dosbox works great under Linux and
opens up a large number of commercial games to Linux.

I just read how Steam is coming to Linux and here is a good list of many 
games on Linux:

They rate many games that run on Linux.

Subject: [PLUG] DSL options in Portland
Message-ID: <20100517233707.3b8537bb@mailhost.pdx.edu>

Comcast just raised my rates. The increase is trivial, but far more
annoying is that the service is decreasing. Six months ago
speedtest.net reported a high of 3 MB/s. Now it is just over 2 MB/s.
The new rate is 55.59/month, which includes 11.49 for basic TV.

When I say "2 MB/s" I mean megabytes per second. That is, assuming the
server can feed me as fast as Comcast will let me download it, I can
download a full 700 MB Ubuntu live CD in about six minutes.

I do not have wired home telephone service; that is, I discontinued the
land telephone a couple years ago since I never use anything but my
cell. I'm not very popular, so no one ever calls me anyway. 

Googling around leads me to a confusing bunch of options for DSL. I'd
pay more for faster speeds. Are there any options that are faster than
the 2 MB/s that Comcast is now giving me?

Check availability in your area for Verizon FiOS, which is Fiber Optic
Service.
Faster than cable (depending on the plan you choose) and waaaay faster than
DSL.
http://www22.verizon.com/Residential/aboutFiOS/Overview.htm?CMP=DMC-CVS_ZZ_ZZ_E_TV_N_X001

Yes there are options for DSL without landline phone as well, check Verizon
and other DSL providers.

I am a current Verizon DSL customer, about to switch to FiOS with the move
(apartment to apartment, new place has had FiOS for a while, current place
only recently got the hook up a couple months ago).  We are not going to
have a landline phone, only cell.  Current setup is landline + DSL.

Just for clarity and ease of making comparisons. That 2MB/s download speed
that you're getting, based on
on 1 Mb/s = 125,000 B/s, means the actual service you're getting from
Comcast is
16 Mb/s. I've heard they're offering 22 Mb/s and 50 Mb/s service also.

 As for DSL service, it's either going to be through  Qwest or Verizon,
depending on whether you live East or West
of the Willamette no matter which ISP you buy the service through.

According to this page,
http://www.qwest.com/residential/internet/features.html, Qwest offers speeds
up to 20 Mb/s and internet w/o phone service. Qwest also was recently bought
by
Century-Tel, so their service offerings and prices are subject to change...

FWIW I'm paying 25 a month for 7Mbps DSL through Qwest.

Sadly, the humble bundle deal is now over. Of the games that were part of it, I highly recommend world of goo, lugaru and aquaria.

Fps-wise I like sauerbraten and nexuiz for some fast-paced shoot-em-ups.

I'd sign up for FiOS in a heartbeat if it was available for my address.
Unfortunately I cannot sell my house and move just to get FiOS. I do
wish their web site had a map instead of requiring you to enter your
address.

And, gosh darn Qwest, i'm still paying $28/mo for 1.5Mbps, while they 
refuse to commit to a timeline for 7Mbps service to my home and refuse 
to stop sending me the junk mail hawking their higher speeds.

Hi all,

I have a Windows installation that I'd like to convert to a VirtualBox 
VM so I can run it under Linux. This is possible under certain 
circumstances, as described here:

http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Migrate_Windows

I have tested the process by taking a dd image of the 80 GB drive and 
successfully got it to boot within VirtualBox. However, the Windows 
installation is only 12 GB or so and the 80 GB disk space hit is too 
much of a problem for me. I'd like to instead have a 20 GB VM.

So I revisited the original Windows hard drive and re-sized the first 
partition to 20 GB. Unfortunately, as the above web page mentions:

3. Either pull the drive from the windows machine or copy the data with 
a low level image tool (like dd) to a USB drive or other removable 
media. If making an image, DO NOT image just the partition, this will 
not work!

And just to be certain, I tried imaging just the partition and verified 
the documentation is in fact correct. :)

Since AFAIK once you start with a VM of a particular size, you cannot 
actually "shrink" it, I'd like to figure out if there is some way I can 
simulate this single 20 GB partition into being a hard drive with a 
valid partition table indicating the size of the drive is 20 GB. Is this 
possible, and how?

I'm eager to learn more about how disk partitions work in the process, 
so point me at some documentation if you have a high confidence that it 
will allow me to resolve this problem.

Thanks,

Scott

They also try to hide the fact that they don't offer any offerings with upstream

Not tested but google seems to say this should work.

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24864/virtualbox-from-an-existing-partition

Use vmware converter to convert the existing install into a vmware
instance, load said instance into Virtual Box (it's supported
apparently) ... profit???

It really depends on where you live. Are you in Qwestland or Verison 
territory?

Depending on where you live you may be able to get DSL/Fiber with faster 
speeds. I have been told it is possible to get just DSL without land line, 
but I think it depends on the carrier.

Speeds vary due to location and carrier. Look on their web site and it 
will tell you what speeds are available for your address.

scott,

one other option (not as free as said virtualbox), if you are interested
AND if your linux + windows partitions are on the SAME COMPUTER ::

you _could_ use VMware for linux. when creating your VM upon
adding/configuring the hard drive, tell it to "use a physical disk (for
advanced users)" - for DEVICE select your PhysicalDrive# to use an
entire drive, or in my case I just "use individual partitions" and
select the m$ windows partition (I'm running win7x64 thru a VM, which is
installed on my PhysicalDisk0, Patrition 0). VMware will ask you to
create a .vmdk file (for me, only ~500 bytes) within yr linux
environment, and your good to go.

boot up yr new VM, and you can use your current windows install without
issue, and any changes you make here and truly applied to yr current
install as you are literally writing to the physical drive m$ windows is
installed on.  for some very specific howto's, just search for "raw
vmware install" or "vmware physical disk" (without quotes).
 
best of luck!  

PS: wassup drew!  ;)

Thanks for the suggestion. I installed VMWare converter but then learned 
that it doesn't work with dd images. Norton Ghost, Backup Exec, etc 
images seem to work, but not raw dd images.

It can also reportedly connect to a running instance of the OS, but 
requires admin credentials. Unfortunately the reason why I'm trying to 
do this rather than doing a full install of WinXP myself is that I'm 
trying to convert the WinXP image from my work laptop into a VM I can 
run within Linux, and I don't have full admin privileges within Windows. :(

I'm working from memory but I think this works.
1) Create a linux VM  (I would just use a live ISO image)
2) set your Windows dd image as hda
3) make a new virtual expanding drive the same size as your dd image and set
it as hdb
4) boot the VM and use dd to copy hda to hdb ( dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/hdb
bs=512 )
5) wait....
6) once the copy is done, shut down the VM, remove the original dd image and
set the new expanding drive as hda
7) Set the VM to boot from hda (instead of the iso image )
8) boot the VM into windows

This should make the new drive only as big as it needs to be, instead of the
full 80 Gigs.  Even if it is still 80 Gigs, at least you can use one of the
previously mentioned options on the native VirtualBox drive image.

Good luck,
 Jason

or Covad

John,  DSL is a distance sentitive service.   I live a bit far from the local 
CO to get really high speed.  

My service is through http://www.sunset.net/ which took over the Stephouse DSL 
accounts when Stephouse bowed out of that market.

Fomerly with http://www.speakeasy.net/ who I left in order to get the local
biz of Stephouse.

Does your work know you're doing this? This would likely upset the 
sysadmin in charge of the laptop. I know I would be.

I'm using Qwest for two "naked" (or stand-alone, or bare) dsl accounts
-- one in SW and another in Seattle.  If I remember correctly, not
using a land line saves ~50% of the land-line cost, but they still
charge something on top of the base DSL price.  What it amounts to is
$35 flat for the first year, and that bounces up to about $48
(guessing) for the "price for life".  That covers service up to
7.5mbps, if your location supports it.

Every DSL provider I've used since ~2002 has offered DSL without a
phone line, but there is definitely some self-selection going on ;) (I
honestly don't recall if I had to search them out or not).

All-in-all, I'm content with Qwest.  It's fast enough for me, latency
is fine, it's not too expensive, and they aren't Comcast.

Yes, I have authorization to do this. I'm happy to share the details and 
why I'm trying to go through this convoluted process, but I don't think 
it's appropriate for the list.

All

Just for clarification..

DSL service  is sold by the bit not the Byte..

<The difference is 8>

Correct me if I am wrong..

YMMV

Anyone else having this problem...????

Subject: [PLUG] DSL options in Portland

Sorry for being late on this thread, I just discovered that my
subscription was suspended about a week ago for excessive bounces (/me
shakes an angry fist, perhaps prematurely, at SpiritOne/Aracnet's new
spam filter).

All of the phone copper in Portland (proper) pretty much is owned by
Qwest.  They are required to lease that copper to competitors in
various ways, so you have options for ISP (the people who take your
bits, and pass them to the rest of the intarweb and back again).
There is an exception: the newer faster DSL that they advertise is
from fiber-to-the-node fed DSLAMs (that is, they run fiber to your
neighborhood, the put the DSL gear in a small closet on the curb and
the rest of the way to your house is over the old twisted pair copper)
and they are not required to allow other ISPs access to that service.
If you get one of the distributed DSLAMs in your neighborhood, you
suddenly don't have a bunch of options you had before.

The bytes-per-second number that your application gives you typically
is going to be "payload" information.  That is, not the raw bitrate,
but the amount of information that you care about being delivered, not
including the packaging information that helps get it there.  Because
there is some overhead in packet headers, mentally I usually multiply
by 10 to get the equivalent bit-rate.  You are getting something like
20-30 megabits per second from Comcast.  If you were extremely lucky,
you might be able to get a bonded service (two DSL pairs) from Integra
for in the neighborhood of $100/month.  The speed would depend on you
being close enough to the DSLAM in a Qwest central office, but my
understanding is that the bonded service tops out at about 20Mbps.
Your CO is probably the one up near Denver and Lombard.  I wouldn't
count on it.

If all you care about is cost and speed, you aren't going to beat
Comcast in the near term.  

FWIW, I care about more than cost and speed.

I want a publicly-owned fiber last mile, where I get cost, speed *AND*
freedom.

marvin,

interesting... now that u mention it -- I too am seeing intermittent
timeouts in my denyhosts log when it is attempting to sync here and there.
actually, ALL sync attempts from one of my servers starting on May 17th
@ 15:24 (PST) up through today May 19th @ 09:44 (PST) failed with the
similar log entries you show. my last failure actually says "sync       
: ERROR    [Errno 111] Connection refused"
it appears now all is well, as of my last sync attempt = May 19th @
12:45 it was successful.
so you definitely weren't the only one. thanks to your post, I wouldn't
have even known the sync server was down (which is my suspicion).
denyhosts appears to be working for me now, I hope yours is workin' now too.

Then you should be able to get the admin password to run the VMware 
tool. Right? If not, have them log in for you to install and run the 
tool, or to add your user account to the local admin group.

I see the confusion.  I should have looked over the directions you followed
to begin with...
Basically all you are doing is booting a live version of linux, mounting
your OutputFile.vdi (as created by the instructions you followed) as the
primary harddrive and using dd to copy it to a new, expanding virtual drive
that is mounted as the secondary harddrive.  This should move the data from
a fixed size drive to an expandable drive.

Let me know if you need any more clarification.

OK:

The ratio (B/A) is 8.
The difference (B-A) is 7.

Thanks for the education. And I'd be surprised if my CO is not the one
near Lombard and Denver, because I know of no other telephone company
buildings anywhere else in the area.

I also checked Verizon, and they told me they don't serve my area.
Qwest offered me a maximum of 5 mb/s, not even their max speed.

>If all you care about is cost and speed, you aren't going to beat
>Comcast in the near term.  

As it turns out, I may have been premature in claiming that my Comcast
bandwidth was decreasing from 3 MB/s six months ago to around 2 MB/s
today. I use Speedtest.net for monitoring bandwidth, and I just
discovered that the problem may be with the Portland server that they
are using, rather than Comcast. Using the Portland server I get about
2.0 MB/s (formerly about 3.0 MB/s). Using the Corvallis server gets me
3.1 MB/s (although the ping response jumped from 32 ms to 124 ms).
Using the server in Seattle I get about 3.6 MB/s. So maybe Comcast is
screwing me only on the bill.

>FWIW, I care about more than cost and speed.

So do I, but considering that (apparently) I can't get close to what
Comcast offers by any alternative, I'll have to suck it up and continue
with Comcast.

>I want a publicly-owned fiber last mile, where I get cost, speed *AND*

I'm totally with you on that. I think everyone in PLUG-land agrees.

Verizon only deployed in places that they were the incumbent phone
company.  Around Portland, that is basically the suburbs only.  They
don't get bang-for-the-buck out of fiber where they have to compete.
So, I'd recommend giving up hope on Verizon where you are now. 

Also, as of a year ago, Verizon's wireline assets in 14 states
(including Oregon) are in the process of being sold to a company
called Frontier.  The sale is subject to approval by the various
states affected, and has been approved by the State of Oregon and
numerous of the other states that have jurisdiction, but the overall
sale is not finalized at this point as far as I know.

Qwest is in the process of being sold to another company too, called
CenturyTel.  That was just announced last month.

HI

Thanks for the comeback..

Mine  started

May 19 16:43:43 - denyfileutil: INFO     purging entries older than:
Wed Apr 21 16:43:43 2010
May 19 16:43:44 - denyfileutil: INFO     num entries purged: 0
May 19 17:13:44 - sync        : INFO     received 50 new hosts
May 19 17:13:44 - denyhosts   : INFO     received new hosts:


And I suspected all the time it was the sync server that was down..

Funny thing is..   Either no one used denyhost or everyone chose to
ignore my plea from help??

So I do appreciate your input.  And I am very happy with denyhost.  I
used to get ponded.  And now.. Nothing..


Peace

Thanks

Marvin

While I hope it's obvious that I have similar partisan sympathies, 
I'll just note that people deploy servers to provide application 
services, not operating systems. If someone's stuck with an 
application that demands Windows -- and lots of third-party apps do; 
it's not just Exchange and SQL Server -- then Windows becomes the 
server OS of choice.

IOW, I deploy servers to please customers, not to be aligned with 
Google, Yahoo!, or Amazon.

Paul,

   While I can think of exceptions to your statement about operating systems,
your points are well made. I wonder if there are data (carefully researched
or empirical and anecdotal) about running those Windows apps in a virtual
machine on a linux server.

A curious mind,

Rich

Running on bare metal or in a virtualization container, it's still a 
Windows deployment (and a licen$e).

I usually need an overabundance of evidence that Windows is the only 
reasonable deployment platform for any given application -- and I 
typically prefer the text-configuration methods common to *nix -- but 
within those boundaries (and initial configuration stumbles 
notwithstanding), I've had no more trouble with Windows servers than 
Linux or Solaris.

Of course, I don't ask a lot of my Windows servers, so it's not like 
the bar is set all that high...

Subject: [PLUG] Looking for a DFT image analysis program
Message-ID: <AANLkTik5oy_u3XjhgWvpY1wqDFLgiEFqQad1QBtBC63N@mail.gmail.com>

It's been frustrating to try to find a 2d image analysis program that
will input a jpg or png (or other type of image file) and run a DFT or
an inverse DFT on the data.

I struggled last night with trying to compile DGV and qc++ but Ubuntu
9.10 definitely has problems with the QT3 and QT4 libraries, in
particular the QT4 libraries do not appear to be set up with the
standard paths.  I do like qmake that autogenerates the Makefile.

Does anyone know of any other image analysis program that will take an
image file and allow one to run either a forward DFT or an inverse
DFT?

I am familiar with fftw (and have used it on very large ascii data
files) but I was hoping to avoid having to create a gui translator for
handling the image files.

I am trying to avoid having to "roll your own".

   I haven't used the FFT module in The R System for Statistical Computing
(R), but it may do what you want. Look at http://www.r-project.org.

Have you considered using Octave?

Subject: [PLUG] Linux accounting software
Message-ID: <AANLkTikE5xos9I9L8X9C6FD8y5F-yrTM-DDWe4Wy595r@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to replace my quickbooks (qb) with something that runs natively
on Linux.

There are many accounting packages for Linux, and some of them look pretty
good, but when I examine them closely, I judge them too risky to commit the
time and resources to convert to them.

I've taken a shot at changing quickbooks to gnucash, by setting up the
appropriate accounts and entering the Jan 1,2010 balances.  I'll have to
keep quickbooks around to look up things in the past.  (There are procedures
to convert the qb data but they seem to laborious and/or lossy to use.)

My question to the group is:  Does anyone have experience with (or knowledge
of) using gnucash or other linux accounting package to run a small service
business?  Small, meaning large enough to need accounts for receivables,
payroll, checking, savings, but too small to have or rent a bookkeeper.

Thanks.

Patrick,

   Yup.

   I've been using SQL-Ledger since 2004. At least, that's as far back as I
had data until I cleaned out the database beyond what my account wants me to
retain.

   There's a long history with SQL-Ledger, and I can relate that over a
microbrew or three some time if you're interested. What I strongly recommend
is that you install and use either the LedgerSMB fork, or -- my preference
-- Armaghan Saqib's enhanced SL <http://www.ledger123.com>.

   SL is a series of perl scripts (the middleware) sitting between a RDBMS
(most of us use postgres) and any Web browser (including links and lynx).
The original author shut down the mail list several months ago (and removed
all archives) except for paying customers. His code is quite buggy, but
mostly works. Armaghan has cleaned up a lot of the code (his business is SL
hosting, support, and customization) and he set up a new mail list that's
quite active and cross-fertilized by the LedgerSMB folks; the developers
share code so both versions are constantly being improved. Just a couple of
weeks ago I switched from vanilla SL to Ledger123 and that cured a
reconciliation issue I've had for years. I recommend it very highly.

   SL (Ledger123 and LedgerSMB) are full-featured accounting systems. It's
designed for manufacturing, distribution, retail, and everything in between.
I don't think it has payroll because that's so location-specific. (There are
L123 users world-wide, from Australia/New Zealand and India to Europe,
Canada, the US, and South America. Many of us users are service businesses.

   You can de-activate the features you don't use. Your inventory can be
goods or services, so I have inventory entries for all the various services
we sell. I also record project numbers so I can create time sheets (when I
have to bill time and expenses), generate sales orders and invoices, and do
all the other bookkeeping and accounting.

   Go to the ledger123 web site, look around, sign up for the mail list, and
see if this will fulfill your needs.

Message-ID: <AANLkTilZ4ZyJOl6irTQ3DjMGlJoh74HVKzr3mgEHWfQ5@mail.gmail.com>

I am running a amd64 machine with Debian testing. I need to build a python
db connector that uses libmysqlclient-dev. However, I need to install the
i386 version and not the amd64 version. From what I have read, (1) this
python mysql connector needs the i386 mysql client headers to compile, and
(2) the 64 bit version of mysql server runs just fine with the i386 client
and the python connector. How the heck do I tell aptitude to install the
i386 version of the libmysqlclient-dev?

Thanks!

AFIK this isn't possible as any "package manager" is going to download
packages per the results of a "uname" query. You could find and download the
.deb file for your version of Debian =>
http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=libmysqlclient-dev

and then use "dpkg -i" to install it.

HTH!

I don't know that this is always true. In 64-bit gentoo you can certainly
install 32-bit programs if you have the appropriate 32-bit libraries to link
with. Is there no /lib32 directory in Debian Squeeze?

Another option: build a 32-bit chroot.

I have a /lib32, so I assume I can somehow install an i386 package. I just
don't know how. I thought of  dpkg -i, with the right deb, but I wantted to
make sure it wouldn't screw up anything.

Well, dpkg didn't work....

orca:/tmp# dpkg -i libmpg123-0_1.10.0-2_i386.deb
dpkg: error processing libmpg123-0_1.10.0-2_i386.deb (--install):
 package architecture (i386) does not match system (amd64)
Errors were encountered while processing:

Now I am stumped. How do I install a i386 package on an amd64 machine?

This howto looks pretty good. I've built 32-bit chroots in gentoo, and this
howto has all the same basic ingredients.

One extreme solution is to install  a complete i386 distribution on the
machine. If you don't have more than 4GB of memory you don't really need a
64bit OS. Or you could install everything in a 32 bit virtual machine.

how about using the --force-architecture flag with dpkg? it's worked for 
me (sometimes, depending on the package and presence of 32-bit 
supporting libraries) on Ubuntu.

That seemed to work...

But my build still fails. Will have to dive deeper into it.

Message-ID: <4BF69E9C.9030904@wescottdesign.com>

I'm way bad -- it's been ages since I've backed up my machine, and my 
it's gotten big in there!  I'm backing up now just by copying to CD -- 
but those CD's have gotten awfully small now that customers are sending 
me multiple 100-MB files of data.

Ubuntu has a bunch of backup options; I'd like to choose one that does 
what I need without having so many cool options that I spend a year 
experimenting with all the wrong ways to do it before I hit on the one 
that actually works.

What is your preferred backup system?  I'd like something that supports 
a scheme that lets me do a monthly complete backup with daily 
incrementals.  I'd like to be able to tag certain directories as "don't 
back up".  Something that could backup to a remote disk would be nice, 
but not essential.  Automatic backup, at least for the incrementals, 
would be especially nice, as I'm absent minded. 

Also nice would be something that lets me plug a big USB disk into the 
cruddy old laptop that I'm using as a server (stupid, I know -- I'll 
replace it when it dies).  I'm thinking that one way or another I want 
to use a two- or three-disk backup system, so that if any one of them 
dies I'll be left with a fairly recent image of my computer.

Suggestions?

   The docs are a bit obtuse, but the help on the mail list is outstanding.
I switched from tape to an external, USB hard drive (300G currently) and use
dirvish running daily from root's crontab.

   I used to make weekly full backups and daily incremental backups; now each
night's backup (using rsync) are the changes from the night before. You can
restore the system to any prior state (or restore individual files) as long
as you have them on the drive. You can exclude filesystems (e.g., /tmp)
where files disappear so they don't have a revised version for dirvish to
find and copy. You can set expiration periods however you want; I keep daily
backups for 2 weeks and full backups for a month. Keith keeps everything
forever.

   While you'll spend time getting your head around how it works and setting
up banks (hosts), vaults (filesystems), the initial storage drive directory
setup, and initial images, it's worth the effort. Once that's done you'll
have complete images of your systems ... as long as you remember to turn on
the backup drive each evening. :-)

The first step in figuring out a backup strategy is to decide on the
media. I.e., will you be backing up to an external USB disk, a network
disk, optical media, over the internet to a web based service, or what?

The second step is to decide how often you want to back up and whether
you want it automated or not. 

The reason you do steps one and two first is because most software
packages were originally designed for one type of storage device and,
while the current version of the software may be able to use various
devices, you'll find a better fit if you choose software that is
optimized for the media you have chosen. Ditto for the frequency of the
backup, as some packages have a nice built-in GUI scheduler, while
others require Cron. I once tried to figure out Cron and it was
hopeless - incredibly powerful tool, but equally difficult to learn.

I am currently using an external hard drive that swaps in and out with
the optical drive in my laptop. Most of the time it sits in a fireproof
file cabinet in my home, and I insert it when I am ready to do a
backup. I don't schedule my backups because sometimes weeks will go by
when I have created nothing important. And when I am working on a
project that has not yet been backed up I use a 4 GB USB stick and just
copy the folder to it every so often as I complete a major part of the
project. 

For the hard disk backup I use rdiff-backup. I started with Pybackpack,
which is a GUI front end for rdiff-backup. Over time I figured out
enough about how rdiff-backup works to create a little bash script to
run my backup. I just put a launcher in my Gnome Applications menu to
run the script. To do an entire backup to the hard disk involves
retrieving the hard disk from the file cabinet and inserting it (it
auto-mounts), then click on the script launcher. I generally do this at
night and in the morning the backup is done.

DejaDup is quite good in all the areas u mentioned, I use it at home for doing daily incremental and monthly full backups to our NAS. 

SimpleBackup is also pretty good. (I'm pretty sure that's the name...)

Dirvish.org lists version 1.2.1 "Baby step incremental" and 1.3.1 
"Experimental only".  The web site doesn't seem to have been updated 
since 2008.

And I recall a talk that Kieth gave a _long_ time ago pointing out that 
Dirvish had trouble with USB drives.

My intent is to keep two USB drives, and swap which one is plugged into 
the server every night.  Since my office lives in a detached garage I 
want to take advantage of the fire protection and back up from a server 
in the house -- this way if one or the other buildings burns down I'll 
still have a copy of my data.  Alternating between the two backup disks 
will give me extra protection if one or the other takes a dump (I 
remember that Kieth does this, it sounded like a good idea at today's 
disk prices).

If possible I'd like to bring several other computers -- including the 
server -- into the fold.  Wife and elder son both have laptops, even if 
they are Windows machines, and there's a "family" computer that gets 
heavily used by younger son.  I'd like them to be able to back up to 
their own spaces.

So -- you still recommending Dirvish?

Dirvish is a layer on top of rsync.  I use rsync directly.  The cool
thing about rsync is that incrementals and full backups are the same.
Every time you take an rsync snapshot (using the --link-dest option),
you get a parallel tree of directories with common files hardlinked
across. 

You can blow away old snapshots in any order you like, and the
filesystem (just by virtue of how it normally works) keeps track of
decrementing link counts and removing only the files that were unique
to the blown-away tree.  The main disadvantage to this is that it's
a little hard to tell how much space you are really going to free by
blowing away a particular snapshot.

You should be aware that USB on a cruddy old laptop is going to be
(probably) a cruddy old USB speed also, and that backups over it are
going to be slow.  USB2 is going to be better, eSATA is going to be
pretty fast, if you can get it.

The rsync command looks something like this:

  rsync -v -a -H --numeric-ids --delete --exclude=/sys/* --exclude=/proc/* --exclude=/backups/* --link-dest=../<last-snapshot-name>/ / /backups/<new-snapshot-name>/

assuming you mount your backup media at /backups/.  I tend to name my
snapshots with timestamps, which makes identifying the
last-snapshot-name and creating a new-snapshot-name easily
scriptable, eg:  YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm.  Note, the trailing slash is
significant, see rsync manpage for details.

Keeping track of hardlinks can be a burden on rsync while it is making
the backup and can chew up RAM during the run.  

Also, you want to avoid ever writing to the files in the backup tree,
since some applications are going to modify the files in-place.  Since
they may be hardlinked across snapshots, modifying them in one tree
will also modify them in all the other trees.  Be sure to treat the
backups as readonly, except when deleting old snapshots or creating
new ones.  On an NFS or Samba server, you can export the backups as
readonly and safely make them available that way.

Also, where possible, avoid situations where a large file changes a
little bit frequently.  For example, large mboxes are bad.  Large,
traditionally renaming-rotating log files are bad (timestamped
logfiles are better).  Renaming large trees is bad.  Rsync is
comparing the-same-filename in the two trees to see if they are
different at all, if they are you get a new copy, chewing up space.

Once you have a near copy on the other side of a network, remote
backups with this method become not so painful also.  Since most of
the content is the same between snapshots, the amount that has to go
over the network is small.  As long as you have remote ssh, you can
maintain offsite backups without having to move media.

   Use the 1.2.1 version. It works and it's rock solid. Germane to versions,
if it works then the version doesn't matter. More than a dozen years ago I
bought a network license for BRU as my backup software (to tape; I've not
tried it to disk but I suppose it would work with any medium). Eventually I
stopped paying for upgrades as my situation was well handled with the all
the versions I used. When I moved from BRU and the Tandberg tapes to dirvish
and the external USB drive BRU was still at version 17.0 from 2007.

   That must be fixed as it's been working flawlessly here for months.

   So instead of sneakernet to swap drives you'll use rubber boot net. If
there are no directions on the web site's HOWTO a question to the list will
be answered by Keith or someone else who will guide you.

   Yup. Each machine would have it's own 'bank.' And each can have its own
backup scheme and backup lifetimes.

bogus!  here's how i got a 32bit compilation to work on ubuntu.  i
imagine the steps would be similar on debian?

to start with you need to somehow get your compiler flags to include
-m32 (gcc -m32 file.c => 32 bit a.out)

you will also need a whole slew of 32bit development stuff.  i already
had much of that installed (libc6-i386 for example) but during
compilation the compiler errored out with missing include files and i
had to track them down:


tribes:/home/c/cmccraw:{109} gcc -m32 test.c
In file included from /usr/include/features.h:378,
                 from /usr/include/stdio.h:28,
                 from test.c:1:
/usr/include/gnu/stubs.h:7:27: error: gnu/stubs-32.h: No such file or directory
tribes:/home/c/cmccraw:{110} apt-file search stubs-32.h
libc6-dev-i386: /usr/include/gnu/stubs-32.h
tribes:/home/c/cmccraw:{111} sudo aptitude install libc6-dev-i386

hopefully the files will have nice unique names like the one that i
was missing--if not you may have to paw through the packages which
*could* provide it and hope to find a 32bit version in the list from
apt-cache or otherwise independently download and install a 32bit
version like you did for libmysqlclient.  (incidentally, are you
certain that doing the install that way didn't break the 64bit
mysqlclient library?   that you can recover from without a lot of
pain, but breaking the system 64bit libc will be much much harder to
come back from..)

anyway, hope that works out for you!

I use rsnapshot, which is a layer on top of rsync in this manner as 
well. It's easy to set up with one configuration file, and has been 
working quite well for me for a couple of years now (backing up to an 
external USB drive).

I can also verify this. However, I'm still using USB 2.0 for my backups 
because I wanted to use the eSATA speeds for a drive I make use of 
during the day. My backups run for a few hours every night, so I keep 
them on the slower medium.

   For comparison, on my lightly used server/workstation the full set of
dirvish backups (13 partitions) takes about 15 minutes and runs after
midnight.

Another vote for Dirvish here.  I've used some of the backup-to-DVD
programs (like DAR), and some of the old reliables, like tar and dump,
but Dirvish works really well for me.  I don't need anything whiz-bang
fancy, since I'm just backing up my personal machines, and Dirvish does
the job well.  I have a 500GB WD MyBook that I use as the backup
drive.  It has backups for several different systems in it (three Linux
boxen, my music collection, and a Windows machine), yet the drive is
only about half full.  Yes, Dirvish will back up a Windows machine if
you need to, only the Dirvish server needs to be running Linux.
Dirvish requires that the backup drive be formatted with a Unix-type of
filesystem that supports hard links.

It is a bit of a pain to set up; as Rich said, the documentation is less
than completely clear.  Still, the information you need _is_ all there.
And, if you need help you can always ask on the Dirvish mailing list;
the folks there are quite friendly and helpful.  Once it's set up, you
don't need to mess with it any further, it Just Works.

Which reminds me, I've got to set up Dirvish on my
shiny-new-from-Free Geek  desktop box, so I can back it up!  :-)

The software that I'm using is v1.2.1; it works fine.  As for the
USB drives, my MyBook is a USB drive, and it works quite nicely that
way.  It was originally on a USB 1.1 interface, which was bog slow, but
on a 2.0 port it's respectably speedy.  It would be nice to have an
eSATA connection, but that's for the future.  Just to make things
simpler and bypass any HAL weirdness, I gave the backup partition a
UUID, and added a UUID-type entry in /etc/fstab. Now the drive mounts
automatically at boot up as /mnt/Backups -- no muss, no fuss.  (I had
trouble with USB drives in general.  Sometimes they wouldn't be
recognized, other times they'd simply fall off the system, leaving a
dangling mount.  Grrr.)

Yes.  Once you've wrapped your brain around the whole "Bank/Vault"

Just out of curosity, why i386?  Are you building it for another machine?

As for building it, you may need to get i386 versions of the various build
dependencies, which may be more painful than just setting up a i386 chroot
or VM.

Message-ID: <20100521235306.GD4553@deer-run.com>

SANS is going to be running a small conference in Portland at the end
of August (http://www.sans.org/portland-2010/).  They're running a
discount for local user groups, and even I prevailed upon the SANS
folks to consider us folks down here in Eugene and Corvallis "locals"
as far as the discount is concerned.

So if you sign up for the conference with the discount code "PTL250",
you get $250 off the normal conference fees.  You can "stack" this
discount with the normal $400 early reg discount as long as you sign
up by the early reg deadline of July 14.  That's better than 15% off
the full conference rate.

The conference includes the new Network Forensics class (For558) which
has been getting rave reviews.  For558 attendees get to take home a
free Lenovo IdeaPad S10 pre-loaded with VMware, Snort, and lots of
other cool tools.  The conference is also running SANS' popular Hacker
Techniques class (Sec504) which is being taught this time by the truly
awesome Mike Poor.  In addition, there's Dr. Eric Cole's new
Enterprise Defender class (Sec501), as well as the SANS CISSP prep
class (MGT-414), which last I heard was still cranking out something
like a 98% CISSP exam pass rate by SANS attendees.

Hope you get a chance to take advantage of this local training 
opportunity and the discount that goes with it...

Galen's suggestion to use Octave has supplied me with a good solution.

Octave is able to read in an gray scale jpg file, store it in a matrix, 
then perform either a fft() or inverse fft() on the matrix.
After getting hit with a warning message about trying to display a image 
matrix with complex numbers, I did successfully view a 
image(real(matrix)) and save it as a ppm file.

Gimp was then able to convert the ppm format to the standard jpg or png, 
so I am satisfied.

if you wanted an easier way to do that, check out convert(1), part of
the ImageMagick suite.  converts to and from almost every image and

Subject: [PLUG] NFS losing server problem...
Message-ID: <1274588715.9100.9.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I have my server running at 100 mb/s connected to a Netgear 8 port
10/100 switch where one of the ports is linked to a 10 MB hub and 
from there the client machine with a RealTek 8029 10 MB nic card is
connected.

Using a gpxe cdrom, I get a PXE boot going and everything seems fine
till it is time to mount the root filesystem.  I get errors that the
NFS server is not responding interspersed with OK messages.

Possibilities:

1) The speed change from 100 mbps to 10 mbps is the problem.

2) The nic is bad, though it works in Windows okay.

3) The sync mount option is causing a problem.

/nfsroot/lfs/lfsp3/tuna       \
tuna.robinson-west.com(rw,no_root_squash,sync)

I've been trying to following the NFS site for troubleshooting, 
but I'm not getting enough information on exactly what is 
causing the server to be inaccessible.

I have tried bypassing the hub, didn't make any difference.

I have used NFS very little since I started using Linux. Is there any chance
you could use SSHFS instead? I have found this to be a very portable option
that works any time SSH does. And if SSH doesn't work, it's usually pretty
easy to determine why.

That said, if you have a spare switch/hub type device, I would swap it in
for each different switch/hub in the chain temporarily to eliminate those as
possible problems. Based on your description, this means you would only need
to eliminate the netgear 8-port as the issue.

Have you looked into debugging options for NFS? Like a --verbose flag?

Maybe do some individual testing with SCP to see if there is a wider network
issue, or if it's something specific to NFS?

Apparently, you can't put a 10 mbps hub between a 10/100 Netgear switch
and a 10mbps network card.  Taking the hub out, I got network booting,
NFS root, to work.  I guess I'm going to have to buy another switch to
replace the hub.  I thought that the hub made no difference, but I guess
the switch isn't smart enough to transmit at 10 mbps to a hub where it
is smart enough to transmit at 10 mbps to a network card.  I figure that
this isn't a bad hub issue because I tried another one.

I could ping in both directions even with the hub, but that didn't mean
that the hub wasn't a problem obviously.

BTW:
There seems to be a bug with dhcp, the linux kernel, or pxelinux that is
really annoying.  The root path gets ignored consistently and the kernel
boot defaults to /tftpboot/<server_name>.  I got around this bug by
making links to the proper directory named after the machines, but this
is sort of an ugly kludge.  I thought that my backup dhcp servers were
to blame, but unless the order of the options is the problem, all three
servers have the root path option.  Anyone solve this problem?

You should forget the hub and replace it with a switch.  Hubs are "dumb" 
devices with no arbitration capability which can lead to packet 
collisions, retransmissions, slower less efficient networking.  Hubs 
merely take the incoming signal and blast it out on all the other ports. 
  They also (I think I remember) run in only half-duplex.  If your 
network cards are not smart enough to figure out the duplex issue, you 
will have additional problems.

Actually, you can, but in this case, taking the hub and its associated
cabling out of the loop fixed your problem for now.  I seem to remember
that you have a bunch of marginal cable that won't work at 100Mbps.

Great!  Run with it and don't look back.  Life's too short to fight with
marginal cabling or hardware.

Message-ID: <1274750857.3033.21.camel@localhost>

Has anyone gotten reasonable gaming performance connecting a 
Playstation II to their PC via a Hauppauge PVR 150 card and 
using MythTV?

The Hauppauge site says that connecting a gaming console to the 
PVR 150 is the one thing you aren't supposed to do.  Oops!  I 
finally got the card to work in Windows 2000, geez that was 
hard.  Thing is, there is a 1-2 second lag, so Dark Cloud is 
totally unplayable.

I don't have room for a television, and a television is going to 
be somewhat expensive, especially if I try to get a flat panel
television.

Is there an adapter that can convert the Playstation II's RCA jacks 
to a VGA plug?  I'm thinking of not going through a computer at all
possibly using such an adapter instead to get the Playstation II to
output on my LCD monitor.

I guess I bought the wrong TV tuner card.  At least it was cheap.

cable box. It works flawlessly in all of those applications. I got it
because they're dirt cheap. You can find them for around $5 on Ebay.
There's no lag for me when using it for games.

I use TV Time, and I like it with one complaint. I can't find any way
to automatically launch the program full screen. I would like to be
able to make a shortcut to it with a command line switch or some such
telling it to open full screen. Does anyone know how to do that?

Patrick,

   Yup.

   I've been using SQL-Ledger since 2004. At least, that's as far back as I
had data until I cleaned out the database beyond what my account wants me to
retain.

   There's a long history with SQL-Ledger, and I can relate that over a
microbrew or three some time if you're interested. What I strongly recommend
is that you install and use either the LedgerSMB fork, or -- my preference
-- Armaghan Saqib's enhanced SL <http://www.ledger123.com>.

   SL is a series of perl scripts (the middleware) sitting between a RDBMS
(most of us use postgres) and any Web browser (including links and lynx).
The original author shut down the mail list several months ago (and removed
all archives) except for paying customers. His code is quite buggy, but
mostly works. Armaghan has cleaned up a lot of the code (his business is SL
hosting, support, and customization) and he set up a new mail list that's
quite active and cross-fertilized by the LedgerSMB folks; the developers
share code so both versions are constantly being improved. Just a couple of
weeks ago I switched from vanilla SL to Ledger123 and that cured a
reconciliation issue I've had for years. I recommend it very highly.

   SL (Ledger123 and LedgerSMB) are full-featured accounting systems. It's
designed for manufacturing, distribution, retail, and everything in between.
I don't think it has payroll because that's so location-specific. (There are
L123 users world-wide, from Australia/New Zealand and India to Europe,
Canada, the US, and South America. Many of us users are service businesses.

   You can de-activate the features you don't use. Your inventory can be
goods or services, so I have inventory entries for all the various services
we sell. I also record project numbers so I can create time sheets (when I
have to bill time and expenses), generate sales orders and invoices, and do
all the other bookkeeping and accounting.

   Go to the ledger123 web site, look around, sign up for the mail list, and
see if this will fulfill your needs.

Rich

I ran a company on sql-ledger for 5 years before we finally broke down and
migrated to Quickbooks last Fall.  Mainly we were fighting accountants who
wouldn't learn the system, extended training for bookkeepers, weird bugs, and
lack of help for those who aren't accountants (me!).

For all its faults, Quickbooks allowed me to get sane reports out of the system,
and I could generally ask the help a question about how to best-practice (GAP) a
scenario and it would have a solution.  Sql-ledger always required odd
workarounds for some things.  The accounting firms also rejoiced our decision,
and we no longer had to pay twice the time for them to muck around sql-ledger.

As for payroll and invoicing AR, forget Quickbooks.  We used PayCycle (which
after two years of happy service, they sold out to Intuit), and for billing used
Harvest, a SaaS[1] (getharvest.com).

We fought hard for sql-ledger, as our business model depended heavily on FOSS; I
myself have been using Debian since you had to write your own X modelines!  In
the end we admitted defeat.  It was hurting our ability to manage the business,
and manage cash flow.

It was a bittersweet day when I had to build an XP VM that wasn't IE-testing
related.  Our first for back-end functions. :\

   My accountant runs Windows only because that's the only platform on which
her tax software runs. She uses Quackbooks, as do almost all of her clients,
and she hates it. It's inflexible and forces users to do things its way, not
their way.

   My accountant doesn't know SL, and doesn't care to. I send her the reports
she needs for quarterly and annual filings (as .pdf files) and she works
from those. There are many consultants who can train bookkeepers on SL;
that's their business. Bugs have been common in SL because Dieter's coding
is rather sloppy; the folks doing Ledger123 and LedgerSMB are fixing bugs as
soon as they are identified and located. They're also adding enhancements.

   The mail list has been a powerful community for help, both the original
one set up by Dieter and the current one run by Armaghan. I remember
answering questions about double-entry bookkeeping and similar issues, and
I'm not an accountant, either. The accounting questions (in which
journal/ledger do I post this transaction?) are best answered by the
accountants. The bookkeeping questions (how to I do this in SL?) are readily
answered by mail list subscribers. I recall a tee-shirt printing company in
Texas who got help from the list, and several companies who figured out how
to do POS and manufacturing assembly accounting with the help of the mail
list community.

   Your experience is quite different from that of most of us.

   If I had payroll I'd pay my accountant to do it; she's up on all the laws
and requirements. A/R and A/P are simple with SL. And, unlike commercial,
shrink-wrapped applications, you can tune it to suit your specific business
and the way you run it.

   That's not the fault of the application. Don't blame it.

Subject: [PLUG] DFRWS 2010 in Portland
Message-ID: <20100526011638.GY2031@sentinelchicken.org>


Hello all,

This is slightly off topic, but near and dear to my heart, so I just 
wanted to share.  Hope you don't mind.

DFRWS is a research-oriented digital forensics conference which brings
together academics, corporate incident responders, and law enforcement
to discuss the latest research in the field.  In my opinion it is one 
of the better digital forensics conferences in the US.

DFRWS 2010 will be held right here in Portland on August 2-4.  You can
find out more here:
  http://www.dfrws.org/

Some of the reasons I personally enjoy the conference and keep 
attending each year:

- An open source flavor.  I'm a fan of open source and many of the 
  attendees at the conference regularly release open source tools.
  (Examples: The SleuthKit, Volatility, PyFlag, scalpel, ...)

- It is small.  Some of the most well known computer forensics
  researchers attend each year, and with a headcount of just about 
  100, it is easy to rub elbows with some sharp folks.

- It is affordable.  Since the conference isn't training-oriented, 
  prices are quite reasonable when comparing it to other forensics
  conferences.  For this reason it's also a great conference for 
  students to get their feet wet in a niche computer discipline.  
  Please forward this along to any local students you know who might 
  be interested. 

If you register before the 1st of June, you'll save yourself $75.

Cheers,
tim

Hi there.
This is my first post to the mailing list, but I have a fairly simple
question.

Is there a community colocation datacenter in Portland OR? I am looking for
somewhere to put a server, and I would like to do it in a community-based
datacenter like sfccp.net or seaccp.org. Is there something like this in
Portland?

Thanks,

Ike

Note: You cannot update Fedora from the live CDs. You are supposed to

Hi Ike - Not that I know of. I asked the same thing last fall and also

I use to use seaccp.org in Seattle and liked them a lot; but Seattle
is a long ways from Corvallis when trouble happens.

I'm not aware of any equivalent in the Portland area.  One reason for
that is that we have osuosl.org.     At Linux Fund, we finally moved
to osuosl.   They are great, but their mission is much more restricted
that seacpp's, so many people and groups who can use seacpp can not
qualify to use osuosl.  Also, seacpp gives users more freedom than
osuosl generally does.

There are a number of small, friendly, high quality for-profit hosting
services in Portland.  The one that comes to my mind is forked.net.  I
used them for several years and really like them.

Seacpp has had financial difficulties at times even though it is
located in Seattle.  Given that Seattle is larger than Portland and
that Portland is already served by the likes of osuosl and forked.net;
I doubt that a Seacpp could succeed in Portland - BUT I could well be
wrong on this.

Perhaps if we could get a group of us together and then go about
contacting local DC providers and see what kind of pricing on a per
cabinet basis we could get? I am fortunate that an Infinity Internet
customer who has 2 cabinets loans me 1U of space, I believe he's
paying about 500 per cab per month which isn't too bad as it includes
1 20 amp circuit and a large amount of bandwidth. If we got enough
people who were interested, willing and were in it for a reasonable
period of time perhaps we could all rent a cab and share.

That would be a possibility. I wonder if we could hook up with Free Geek to
see if there was any interest from their group.

Not co-location service but virtual machine from a local group is
www.rdrop.com  I used agora for the longest time and helped Alan
out a couple of times getting him hardware at cost.
It is still going.  It's possible that he is open to co-location or
would have other ideas
about co-location.

In response David Mandel gave some background on the economics of colocation
in Portland. This lead to discussing VM host services. Which, in my mind, is
a better way to go.  It is more efficient for physical and power resources and
usually more flexible for the user.

I used rdrop.com (well, Agora) for dial up shell account services when I 
first moved to Portland in 1990.  Batie always provided great service. 

The rdrop.com site suggests high bandwidth users consider 
http://www.downloadtech.com/

I use a VM at my domain registrar, gandi.net, that costs $15/month per "share".
1 dedicate processor core, 256Mb RAM, 8G disk, 5Mb/s bandwidth.  This can 
statically or dynamically be scaled up to 24 shares 
http://www.gandi.net/hosting/vps#main-nav 

What is your VM host recommendation?

Hulu is a popular online video streaming service, with a very large
selection of shows; it even has a linux desktop application. 

Boxee is my favorite application for entertainment on the web.

Bandwidth is of course something to consider, if you're on a capped
bandwidth subscription.

That will work for Debra, as she has a 32-bit computer. I have a 64-bit
computer and 64-bit Linux. Hulu gives an error message "sorry we are
unable to stream this video." Hulu.com is the only place where the
problem exists. It is well documented with much sighing and wringing of
hands, but no solutions. That is, unless you want to load a 32-bit
chroot or do some other finagling.

I know it might not be as clean as you like, but with something like
that I use the Windows version of Firefox under Wine and it works just
fine. This is on a year old computer, though. I'm not sure if it needs
very much processor power to do that. If you need I can install it on
my slower computer and see how it works. (But it wouldn't take much
for you to install it yourself and see if your computer is enough.)

I guess I didn't make something clear: I don't give a rat's patootie
about television. That 64-bit flash works perfectly everywhere except
Hulu is just fine with me. My comment was only for the benefit of
64-bit Linux users for whom television has value.

Ubuntu (10.04, at least) installs the 32-bit Flash plugin, even on a
64-bit system. Hulu works just fine.

Is this card capable of supporting the Play Station II at full speed?

Are there stereo to RCA adapters, or do I have to do something else for
sound?  Does this card support stereo sound or am I going to be stuck
mixing the left and right channels?

There is a $20.99 with $7.99 shipping buy it now auction on EBay for
this very card in an unopened original box.

I'm leery of buying another Hauppauge TV tuner card only to find that
this one doesn't work either for what I'm intending to use it for.

I have the Hauppauge PVR 150 which sort of works, but the video is
delayed so much that the games are unplayable.

Many sites require the 'real' flash plugin, and there is a working 64 bit plugin from Adobe. You will have to google for it, I don't have the URL handy. I know it solved many flash issues I was having, even though it was in beta.

That did indeed take care of it. I removed the swfdec and added the
"flashplugin-installer" which in Ubuntu installs Adobe's version. It
was very small and said that it was just adding the installer and that
the installer would have to download the actual plugin from Adobe, but
I never saw it do that. So maybe I already had it and it was
conflicting with swf? At any rate it performed flawlessly on the few
sites that I just checked it on.

Thanks!

I don't want this card, it only supports mono sound reproduction.

I am trying to run a Play Station II through a tv capture card.
Will the PVR 150 I have which has a delay issue work better in my
3.06 Ghz P4 with 1.5 gigs of ram than it does in my P3 450 system
with 384 megs of ram?  If I can solve the problem by moving the
card to a faster machine and using MythTV, then maybe I should do 
that.

Can anyone say definitively that they have played Play Station II
through a capture card successfully and exactly which capture card
that is?  Will Play Station II designed for SDTV work on a flat 
panel LCD or plasma HDTV?

I believe you will find many many websites with many many people doing something very similar to this. 

There are sites out there with 10s of thousands of users with PS2, while I would bet there's less than 100 PS2s among the entire PLUG readership. 

In other words, this does not seem like the best forum for your question, assuming you really want a good answer. 

I may be wrong.

I can say that a capture card will definitely work on my Wii console,
which I know for a fact uses the same RCA connections that a
Playstation II does. So I think it's a close enough comparison.

Like I've told you a few times, I use a WinTV-GO card and it performs
flawlessly. I've also used other, more expensive cards, but I'm not
sure at the moment of their exact models. But it sounds like you want
to do this on the cheap, anyway.

You can get HULU to work.  I have gotten the same message when going to
HULU.com but if you go there and download their HULU Desktop application, it
will work perfectly.  Not sure why this is but I have done this on both Win
XP and Linux without further issues.

Good Luck,

Yes, but which WinTV GO card?  Another option I've discovered is 
a Linux\Windows compatible PS/2 emulator, but it is only beta 
quality software.  Still, maybe I should be looking for an adapter 
for the PS/2 game pads so I can plug them into standard USB on a 
PC directly.  There are many WinTV GO cards made by hauppauge, 
all of them slightly different.  I'm wondering if emulation is 
good enough to forgo trying to acquire the correct tv tuner 
card when I'm not after tv or video editing anyways?

Unless I'm not shopping in the right place, I'm looking at around $30
shipped to get a WinTV GO card and that doesn't take into account that
I need adapters for the stereo jacks to accomodate RCA.

Of all the options available there is a third slightly expensive option
of buying a special device that allows me to plug my play station II
into a VGA monitor directly.

I've stepped back from trying to purchase a different Hauppauge card 
as I'm not confident that I know enough and the price doesn't seem 
all that great.

According to dmesg:
[   20.433631] bttv0: Hauppauge eeprom indicates model#44801

so
http://cgi.ebay.com/Hauppauge-44801-WinTV-GO-WatchTV-Tuner-Capture-Card-/360221780965?cmd=ViewItem&pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item53dee42be5

With those three things you should be in business, and for something
close to $20.


Although I still find it really odd that you have that lag. I had an
issue with lag with a much newer card and got in touch with Hauppauge
and they told me that their native program wouldn't handle it, but
that D-Scaler would. (This was on a Windows machine.) And they were
absolutely correct. It still bugged me that they wouldn't resolve the
issue in their own software but direct me to a third party. (Though at
least it didn't cost me anything.) So at least for that one the lag
was all software, not in the hardware. And that was the only card out
of 4 or 5 that I've used that has ever had lag in *anything* that I've
used it for. (Although when you're just watching TV or other passive
input the lag doesn't matter and isn't noticeable, as long as it
exists for both audio and video. It's only when trying to interact
with the input video that a lag becomes an issue, of course.)

Good luck! (And if you want any other details from my board or setup
then let me know.)

Interesting, thank you ... a nudge toward ChromiumOS, it seems.  But not 
so fast as to upset too many people?  Or maybe just caution in general?  
I confess I don't know ... these are just impressions from reading the 
FT article and then doing a few googles on chromium.  But it could just 
as easily be simply an interim step to deal quickly with a security 
issue, or perhaps just the perception of a security issue?  
Unidentified/unofficial sources ... well, identified/official sources 
are questionable enough what with hidden agendas and all, aren't they?  
But let's set that all aside for now, please, and ask, if I may ...

Is anyone using Chromium?  Thoughts?  Well, one from me ... nothing is 
store on your computer ... so your computer becomes a thin client, 
right?  So they glossed over where stuff is stored in the videos, but 
the answer is, of course, on someone else's computer, right?  You comfy 
with that?  All kind of warm and fuzzy?  I'd be very interested in your 
thoughts/feelings (Disclaimer:  I am in no way associated with MS or G, 
of Apple for that matter, and I don't make a living from any of these, 
or even from Linux/Unix (anymore).)

Further disclaimer: They did mention that ChromiumOS was for people who 
mostly worked on the Web ... I do a lot of that, it is true, but not 
entirely, so maybe I don't fit the preferred ChromiumOS target 
audience?  Still, I am curious.
Regards
Fred James

Subject: [PLUG] Changes in Gnome Unicode character input method
Message-ID: <20100531234355.7b873cbc@mailhost.pdx.edu>

In a recent discussion on the Gnome e-list it has been brought to my
attention that in Fedora 13/Gnome the input method for Unicode
characters has changed from Ctrl-Shift-u + Unicode value to iBus
something-or-another. The gist of it, as far as I have been able to
determine, is that you will have to use a keyboard layout to type
special characters, although there is an option to continue to use
Ctrl-shift-u +Unicode value for gtk+ apps provided you launch the app
from a special command telling it to use the old way. If your app is
not a gtk+ app you're screwed.

I am hoping someone here can shed some light on this, as it is critical
to me. For several years I have happily typed characters with combining
diacritics for linguistics using Ctrl-shift-u, which delightfully works
system-wide in all applications. 

To get an idea of what I am talking about, look at the character chart
for the International Phonetic Alphabet:

http://weston.ruter.net/projects/ipa-chart/view/

Pay particular attention to the diacritics, e.g., voiceless, voiced,
more rounded, etc. Each of these diacritics can be combined with any of
the regular Latin alphabet plus the ~100 special glyphs in the IPA. For
example if I need to describe a [b] with a breathy voice (as in
Indo-European and many present day languages), I need to type a b
followed by Unicode 324, which inserts the breathy voice diacritic
under the b [b?]. There are probably a hundred thousand possible
combinations of characters and combining diacritics. Note that there
cannot be special all-in-one glyphs with the combining diacritics as
there are for Spanish, French, German, etc. because there are simply
too many possibilities. No font that I know of contains all the
combinations and, even if such a font existed, finding the single glyph
that combines the character and combining diacritic that you need would
be impossible.

Linux has always been better than Windows for linguistics work because
Ctrl-shift-u works in all apps. In Windows you can do a similar thing
(Unicode value + Alt-x), but it works only in Microsoft Office, not
system wide. If you need to work in QuarkXpress, OpenOffice.org or
WordPerfect, you have to scroll through an "insert character"
dialog box.

If I understand the forthcoming changes correctly, Linux with Gnome
desktop will soon become worse than Windows for linguistics work. There
may be options with KDE or other desktops, but I love Gnome. This is
not happy news.
