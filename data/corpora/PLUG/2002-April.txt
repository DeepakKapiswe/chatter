Subject: [PLUG] kernel 2.4.5 and es1371
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20020419194930.009fd230@mail.attbi.com>

I purchased a es1371 to work with my linux computer as it's in the kernel 
options list. It worked great under kernel 2.2.17, but with the kernel 
2.4.5, I'm having a problem... here's where "make bzlilo" dies...

drivers/sound/sounddrivers.o: In function `es1371_probe':
drivers/sound/sounddrivers.o(.text+0x673b): undefined reference to
`gameport_register_port'
drivers/sound/sounddrivers.o: In function `es1371_remove':
drivers/sound/sounddrivers.o(.text+0x6883): undefined reference to
`gameport_unregister_port'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1

So I've looked it up on google and it looks like there may be a flaw in the 
2.4.5 kernel with those particular cards.  However, I generally don't 
believe my first response, especially when the answer is "it's someone 
else's fault. "  I've tried compiling this into the kernel (the es1371 
card) as well as joystick support. Is there something else I'm missing, or 
should I try downloading a different kernel?

When I worked for a telco, there was a trainer (PNB/USWest retiree) who
gave everyone a week-long crash course in telephony.  Those are the
numbers he gave us.  Take that however you like... that's just where I got
my info.  Could be dead-on, could be full of shit, could just be old data.

I think private line and trunk services have different FCC requirements.

Yeah, just before I left the telco, they were implementing some soft
switch systems running on Sun hardware (and software, to some extent).

Big cost savings, but things get weird when dataheads and bellheads
collide.  I remember a huge argument where folks at a management
conference (and I mean fault management here) were horrified that a person
would use SNMP to manage telco equipment.  "But it's UDP!  Best effort
delivery!  Not good enough!"  "But it's six inches of cat5, directly wired
to the management station!"  Hoo, boy.

I can't believe anyone says "five nines" with a straight face.  They KNOW
they're lying... the person listening KNOWS they're lying... the boss
KNOWS they're lying.  It's a check mark on a form and they all pretend
they're actually going to meet it.

Ugh.  I don't know if I'm ready to deal with corporations again.

Hi Brent,

I've managed to get ftp and http sources added, after a bit of fumbling.
(BTW, the same sources you set up with rpmdrake are also used for the
urpmi tool, which does auto-dependency stuff and generally makes it
about as easy to load packages as APT does for Debian.)

I've found that specifying the path to the directory containing the RPMs
themselves does the trick. Here's a working example from my 8.1 system:

  URL: ftp://mirrors.secsup.org/pub/linux/mandrake/Mandrake-old/8.1/i586/Mandrake/RPMS/
  
  hdlist: ../base/hdlist.cz

I haven't spent much time on 8.2 yet, but it looks like that version of
rpmdrake no longer provides a default value for hdlist - I'm not sure
I'd ever have figured this thing out without that helpful head start in
earlier versions.

No, but it's no good if someone violates a legal commitment or a law
in releasing such code. For example, if you obtain Windows source under
license with the Evil Empire and release a copy under GPL, that doesn't
make Windows GPL, it just makes your name mud. Microsoft would have
the legal right to withdraw the code from GPL, sue your ass, and run a
multimillion-dollar advertising campaign claiming that OSS=piracy.

Unfortunatly the url/hdlist pair didn't work for me - but knowing that
rpmdrake was a companion to urpmi I found that in /etc/urpmi/urpmi.cfg I
could copy a (non-working) source with my trusty text editor that was
present in that file and "fool" rpmdrake into taking the (8.2-ized) url
you provided.  Everything was peachy until I wanted to install a few
RPMs that (I guess) show up in hdlist.cz yet aren't present in the RPMS
directory.  Other non-peachyness is that urls entered don't appear to
survive rpmdrake restarts.  Are these things which you've seen in the
8.1 version?

Nevermind. I posed my question before reading the article linked to. I
suppose I didn't realize that since a minor can't legally enter into a
contract, they could suddenly "change their mind" on their 18th
birthday. Bum deal.

While I completely understand Apple's take on the situation, couldn't they 
have simply asked for a legal co-signer?  Such as, as someone else suggested, 
a parent?  That way, the minor could NOT change their mind, as the agreement 
wasn't *just* with them and them alone.

That way, both Apple, and the young developer could continue the arrangement 
with as little fuss and with the benefits that led to the agreement in the 
first place.

Obviously, IANALama.

I'm seeing a lot of entries in my apache access_log that look like

After looking at over 50 sets of these, I've noticed a couple of things:

1) They always come in sets of 4.
2) The email field appears to be randonly generated ... at aol.com
3) The recipient is constant for a given block of IP addresses, in this
case formmailrogers at yahoo.com

To me it looks like someone is using some kind of automated scanning
tool to see if the site has a poorly configured Matt Wright formmail
script.  The tool user looks in their email account for URLs of
potential targets.

Is anyone else seeing URLs like this in their logs?  Has anyone heard
about a formmail exploit, or a scanning tool that looks for it?  Also,
if they're actually stupid enough to use a real email address that's
potentially traceable, should I send my logs to someone who might
arrest the little turds?

Hello Linux folkz,

The initial package was corrupt during installation or download.
Now I can't even uninstall it with ether --nodeps or -i --force flags
I'm getting: 
script failed, exit status 1
The only option is to install newly loaded and verified prm package

The parsing isn't hard:

grep formmail /var/log/httpd/access_log* | \
perl -pe 's/^.+recipient=(.+?)\?.+/$1/;' > booger.list

That's from memory but should be right.

Yes, there is an exploit that is widely used for spam.

I have updated my scripts per:

Also, I would suggest renaming formmail.pl to some other name.

Well, we use a form to email gateway, but I wouldn't use anything
from Matt Wright.  A group of Perl programmers got together and
put together some drop-in replacements for his scripts, except that
they work right and don't have holes :)

Fine members of the PLUGin' list,

I want to do a Debian install on a system at work for testing reasons.  My
only concern is the APT facility.  Our corporate firewall is pretty strict
in that I bet I would only be able to do an apt-get through https with proxy
username/password authentication.

Now the actual question:
Can apt-get work through an authenticated https proxy?

Thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] Audio Extraction broken on Via 686b?
Message-ID: <20020401194533.GB717@buckethead.localdomain>

I cannot get digital audio extraction (DAE) to work on my new Shuttle
FV25 motherboard. I am using a Sony CDU4011-10 ATAPI CD-ROM drive
connected to the FV25's onboard VIA 686B controller.

I use "cdparanoia -v 1-1". It says that /dev/hdc supports DAE, then
starts the extraction but makes no progress. Then I get "hdc: lost
interrupt" kernel messages every 10 seconds or so.

Mounting and reading ISO CD-ROMs works fine, as does playing CDs
through the audio connector.

The Sony performs DAE fine when connected to an Intel 440BX
motherboard. It fails when connected to either channel 0 or 1 of the
the FV25 motherboard.

I am using linux kernel 2.2.20 with the built-in ATAPI cdrom
support. I have tried all combinations of enabling/disabling DMA in
BIOS, in the "use DMA by default" kernel option, and
enabling/disabling DMA using hdparm with the same result.

What could be causing this problem? How do I fix it?

Did a little research here, and I found out how you do this:

define environment variable http_proxy as http://user:pass at server:port

and then use apt-get normally.  Information gleaned from the sources.list 
manpages on drizzle.  (thanks Karl!)

I've been noticing these attempts since I moved my web site to my own
server. I don't use formmail, so the poor lads were getting 404'd. I took
pity on them and decided to toss them a bone :)

Subject: [PLUG] Mail bounces - error 550 Host unknown
Message-ID: <200204012047.g31Kltw05894@microsharp.com>

Starting last week we have been seeing a lot of bounces like the one 
below from two sites. The problem seems to be DNS but all machines at 
both of the sites are browsing OK and mail gets to us with no pronblem. 
This is happening with several mail servers not just with AOL. The only 
thing common to both sites is their reverse lookups are broke - but 
would that cause a host lookup error?

Thanks in advance

What's likely happening is that the pre- or post-uninstall script
is failing to execute properly. Try this instead:

  rpm -evv --noscripts packagename

If that fails, the -vv verbosity should give you a good hint as to
what's amiss.

  If it looks like SPAM, tastes like SPAM and leaves grease on the fingers
like SPAM, it is spam. I received the same message last week.

  As I'm not an electrical engineer I thought they culled my name from the
PLUG list, so I was surprised to see the exact same message appear here.

Yes, no one makes much money from domain registration.
They run the service as a way to lead people to their other services.
Most of the cheaper registration services almost force you into their
services.

I like:

TZO - You described them very well already.

Easyspace.com - They are out of UK.  They are reasonable cheap - not
dirt cheap and have a nice web interface which allows you to use their
DNS or to point to your own DNS which is what I do.  I have several
domain thru them and I've been happy so far.

Dotster.com - Dale Zeutenhorst uses them and has had good experiences.
Like Easyspace.com, Dotster is cheap, and they have a nice web interface.
They are also local - Vancouver, Wa based.

I like it.  However, looking at the URL leads me to believe that they
look in their mailboxes for successful URLs for formmail abuse.  How
about modifying it to send them an email saying "bite me" :)

Mr. Sean Whitney
3309 NE 133rd Court
Vancouver, Washington  98682


Dear Mr. Whitney:

Thank you for contacting me regarding the Consumer Broadband and Digital
Television Promotion Act, S. 2048.  This act was formerly known as the
Security Systems Standards and Certification Act (SSSCA).  I appreciate
hearing your concerns.

As you are aware, Senator Hollings introduced S. 2048 on March 21, 2002.
The bill has been referred to the Senate Commerce, Science and
Transportation Committee.  This legislation would mandate the development
of technological protection measures to be implemented and enforced by
federal regulations.

I understand your concern that we must work to achieve the right balance
between protecting copyrights and remunerating the creators of those works
and reasonable consumer use of copyrighted works.  Indeed, the pace of
innovation requires a diligent consideration of both of these interests.
I believe that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA) passed in 1998
helps to accomplish this goal.  We need to continue to encourage
innovation in technology while protecting the intellectual property rights
of inventors, artists, authors and musicians.  The DMCA prohibits
circumvention of technological protection measures and the trafficking of
such technology.  Thus, the law facilitates legitimate distribution of
copyrighted work by allowing for the use of technological measures by the
copyright holder and providing legal protections for those measures.  You
should know, however, that I will not be supportive of legislation that
unduly limits technological innovation or consumers' rights.

At this relatively early point in the development of digital distribution
of copyrighted works, the U.S. Copyright Office has recommended that
Congress make no significant changes to copyright law right now.  As a
member of the Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over copyright
law, I will be actively considering these issues.  Please be assured that
should S. 2048 come before the Senate, I will keep your concerns in mind.

Again, thank you for contacting me, and please do not hesitate to do so in
the future if I can be of further assistance.
Sincerely,

Maria Cantwell
United States Senator

Michael,

Since the output columns are a fixed width, the simplest approach would be
to use `cut'.

Looks like you've found the problem, something between your Sony and the VIA chipset.

I'm not sure it can be fixed, short of getting a new chipset (with MB).  Here are some things to try though.  Have
you tried setting it as slave instead of master (leave it on the secondary channel)?  Or how about setting up the
ide-scsi emulation, and use it as a scsi device instead?  And, if desperate, you may be able to get it to work
with an off-board controller (Promise or Maxtor ide controller), it may be less expensive than a new MB (but
probably not less expensive than a new CD ROM).


Good Luck

Well, I'm not sure exactly what your list looks like, so for the sake of
argument, let's assume you have a file with one filename per line.  Feed
that as an argument to this little Perl script:

while(<>){
  print;
  next if ! $_;
  chomp;
  if ( ! -e ) {
    print "Cannot find $_\n";
  } else {
    print "Last modified: ",-M, "\tFile size: ",-s,"\n\n";
  }
}

You may want to play with that to get the exact format of the output you
would like.

There is a problem with Formmail prior to version 1.9 which allows the
attacker to send messages to arbitrary email addresses.  This makes you the
source of their SPAM.  v1.9 was released early last August to correct this
problem.  You can read a full description at:

Except that it's not, note that he said several files have spaces in
them and that's what awk is using as a field seperator:

  [kryten steve]$ touch "testing 1 2 3"
  [kryten steve]$ /bin/ls -l | gawk '{printf ("%-40s %s %2s %5s %10s\n",$9,$6,$7,$8,$5)}' | grep ^testing
  testing                                  Apr  1 16:27          0

  I filed a complaint (with substantiating evidence) with the Oregon
Department of Justice's Civil Enforcement Division about fax spam. After
three copies, the victim -- er, recipient -- has a valid complaint. As the
letter from the DoJ to the offender states:

  "Oregon Revised Statute 646.872 states that once a business has received
notice not to send further transmissions, it is a violation of the law to
send another such transmission for a period of one calendar year from the
date that the notice is given. ... Each subsequent transmission is
potentially subject to fines and penalties of up to $25,000 per incident
plus the cost of investigation and legal action if necessary. We believe
that this fax transmission may also violate the federal Telephone Consumer
Protection Act if you are sending to people with whom you have no
established business relationship."

  Because spam comes in to my network via the telephone lines I wonder if
this statute applies to spammers, too. I sure hope so! And I'll find out.

SSH works, as I have been using it for about 2 years; but I haven't
gotten sftp to work. I think that may be because they aren't using
linux. Last I checked, it was FreeBSD. I don't think they're using
OpenSSH.

And now that they're owned by US.NET, they are a windows/mac shop. My
ability to get support from them on linux is *zero*. Any support
question is answered with "What OS are you running?". When you reply
with "Linux", they say "Sorry, that's an unsupported OS; we can't
assist you with _any_ issues - even if it might be _our_ problem!".
So, by this time next year, they won't be my ISP.

Let us know!  I wonder if the scanning attempts to use formmail as a
spam relay counts, too.

BTW, what constitutes a "business", per se?  Is anyone who sends spam
considered a business?

I've had system lockups under ext3 with no loss of data, and very fast
reboots even with 'unclean' shutdowns in the fsck step.

What I haven't learned (altho it may be addressed in the above
reference, haven't read it yet) is how to create an ext3 fs, or
upgrade an existing ext2fs to ext3, other than during a RH7.2 install.
When I add a drive to an existing system, I can't seem to create
partitions on that drive in ext3, but I can create ext2 partitions
just fine. And until now, I haven't seen any such instructions.

Small, irritating issue.

Have one icon for executing "rxvt -plus -bunch -of options".  Nice and
docked and no application icon so I can run multiple copies.

>From a rxvt, I run another "rxvt -options -with -e ssh navi" and drag
the application icon into my doc.  The problem is when I change the icon
of the ssh version, the standard rxvt icon changes with it.  
I just want two different icons for each rxvt icon.

Hi Derek. Thanks for the tips.

I already tried putting the CD as a slave on the second channel. It
made no difference.

Ok, I just tried this, and it didn't work, but I get more diagnostic
info. From the kernel:

scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 127, scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0 UNKNOWN(0xbe) 00 00 00 00 07 00 00 0d f8 00 00 
hdc: lost interrupt

hdc: lost interrupt

...

Any ideas?

hdparm tells me DMA is turned off and switching it on doesn't help.

I am rather attached to this motherboard because of the Flex-ATX form
factor and the case that goes along with it (Shuttle SV25). I suppose
I will try an ide controller card if all else fails.

True.  It appears the best solution is to use cut to get the full
filename and them use perl (or python) to nicely format a report adding
in the details like modification time and file size.

I thought it was crystal clear. "I will not be supportive of legislation that 
unduly limits technological innovation or consumers' rights." That's 
doubletalk for she supports the dang thing. But then, what would you expect 
from a Real Networks alumnus, the grand champions of customer data abuse?

Something for the future ISP evaluation page...

Looks like I jumped the gun re: sftp.  I maintain my website using scp. 
Their shell server is currently OpenBSD 2.6.  The man page for ssh 
indicates openssh.  There is no sftp binary in my search path.

My experience with tech support is generally very good.  I usually need 
them after midnight on Sunday's (strange that).  Many of the techs are 
versed in Linux and have been as helpful as they can.  When I do get the 
occasional by-the-book tech who is fearful of Linux, I speak in soothing 
tones and tell them that I can give them any information they need and it 
usually works out.

However, since they were picked up by us.net, things have gone downhill. 
My main beef is notification.  Servers go down sometimes, fine.  A month 
ago or so, my webpage dissappered and I couldn't log in--presumably two 
dirrerent servers.  Okay, maybe someone nuked /etc/passwd.  But during the 
latest outage, the recorded message explained that this was due to 
scheduled maintence with *no* ETA.  How's that?  Anyway, once I was able to 
flame them, I explained the politeness of letting the customer know when 
service was going to be interrupted.

During its darkest days, even Teleport send out mail.  So I'm shopping for 
a new ISP myself.  Where's that list...

Cheers,
Kyle Accardi

An acquaintance of mine (Doug) is trying to setup VPN using broken

I suggested he use linux, and he wanted to know how you get around the
Certificate of Authority requirements, etc. etc. etc.

I don't know the answer, but I'm pretty sure someone here can provide
it. I haven't checked the archives, and it's probably in there, but
from lynx I'm not sure how to do that.

You don't need a certificate of authority when you implicitly trust
both endpoints because they are under your control.  What other
questions did he have?

Thanks.  I did this one because many Linux I/O subsystems
and VM/MM etc. have their own mailing list and web page(s),
but filesystems has only a mailing list -- no web page.
It's still a work in progress.

I do very little with Linux audio (only USB :).
I do have many Fonts links -- mostly because I did laser

fonts, and I tortured them about rough edges etc. until
they fixed lots of them (around 1987).

Since I'll be looking for a new ISP, this has come to mind.

Currently I'm using a Cisco 675 "modem" which is CAP only and as I 
understand being phased-out in favor of DMT encoding.

Does the ISP care?  Or is it only an issue between me and Qwest's DSLAM's.

If it is between me and Qwest, and I am being grand-fathered, will Qwest 
force me to DMT if I switch to another ISP?

It's between you and Qwest; the ISP only sees your connection as
a virtual circuit in ATM or Frame Relay.  I don't know if Qwest
will make you switch or not if you change ISPs; I suspect not,
but who knows.

Thanks, that's what I thought.  I just called Qwest and they said as long 
as I kept the circuit up (meaning I dont't cancel and restart my DSL 
service with them), that they would keep me CAP.  The tech was happy that I 
had such an easy question...

Do this for each dir off of root.  It will tell you where the 8Gb is.

I would hazard ftp might be the answer.  If anon ftp is allowing file
uploads, someone can upload 8 Gb, and not break security.

Once you fine the directory du a "du -s /xxxx/* | sort -n"

The * measures sub directories.  The sort shows the biggest last.

a word of warning, don't do /proc, /net, or /misc or /mnt as they tend
to be mount points not directories.

  I just read the applicable ORS for faxed spam, and it does (unfortunately)
explicitly reference the transmission of spam over telephone wires by
facsimile machies.

  However, on the bright side, it is much easier to modify a law than it is
to create a new one. (I know because last session produced a law that I
conceived and helped to nurse through the legislative process.)

  I encourage you to contact your state representative and senator (as I
will do) and ask them to make a small modification to ORS 636.872: remove
the explicit references to "facsimile machines" and replace them with
references to "digital or analog transmission". Should receive a warm
welcome. :-)

  If those of you who live in Washington will check the language of the
Washington anti-spam statute, please share with us the wording. I believe we
have an opening here to do something useful and productive.

I've seen some .sigs that reference that law or a similar one - they basically 
say that since you're connected via a telephone wire, and can then print out 
said message, that your computer, is, in fact, a very very expensive facsimile 
machine.

Granted, that's stretching the letter of the law, but it does raise some 
interesting points.

Technically, AT&T has to connect to the telcos to get hooked into
the backbone.  In other words, if I had a cell phone connected to
a fax machine, the transmission still comes over a phone line
during its course from point A to point B.

Which brings up an interesting point.  What prevents some scumball
from connecting to PDXwireless and broadcasting spam to all nodes,
even with the modifications that Rich is talking about?  Maybe we
should think the wording through a little more clearly.

  This interpretation looks like another implementation of the Attorneys
Full Employment Act of 2002 (Revised). I'd rather see if the specific
language could be broadened to include e-mail. Looking at the Washington
statute would be informative if someone wants to track it down and provide

If you do:

du --max-depth=1 /

Then it will only show the subdirectories off of root, with a total of what 
they contain.

You can then move into the larger subdirectory, and repeat the process. 
Eventually, you'll find the file.

It's part of the Consumer Protection Act.  From:

http://search.leg.wa.gov/pub/textsearch/ViewRoot.asp?Action=Html&Item=0&X=402095947&p=1

   Last year the Legislature passed a law regulating commercial electronic
   mail messages.  The law defines a commercial electronic mail message as
   one sent for the purpose of promoting real property, goods, or services
   for sale or lease.  It is a violation of the Consumer Protection Act to
   initiate a commercial electronic mail message from a computer located in
   Washington or to a Washington resident that:

      *  Uses a third party's Internet domain name without permission of the
         third party, or otherwise misrepresents any information in
         identifying the point of origin or transmission path of the message;
         or

      *  Puts false or misleading information in the subject line of the
         message.

   Only the person who actually clicks or pushes a "send" button on a
   computer screen or keyboard to transmit a message is liable under the
   Consumer Protection Act.  An interactive computer service provider that
   routes or re-transmits the message is not liable.

   When a sender violates the Consumer Protection Act, the recipient of the
   commercial electronic mail message may bring a civil action against the
   sender for the greater of $500 or actual damages.  An interactive computer
   service provider may also bring an action against the sender for the
   greater of $1,000 or actual damages.

Mattress Tester!", if he lived in WA, would be breaking the law? Cool!

Is there a setting somewhere that keeps logging me off my Mandrake 8.1
system? It *seems* like I'm getting kicked off for no activity after about
15 minutes, but I have no clear proof yet.

I'm running an xterm through an ssh tunnel to get to the host. Exceed on the
Win2k box, and OpenLook managing the windows from the slow Sparc of
high-wheeled toys. (Sorry about that.)

Hello Linux folkz,
Does somebody know any good alternatives to Vmware to run a few M$
applications as Word97, Excel97.
My manager still can't get rid of his nasty habit of using M$
applications.
Many thanks in advance for any advise or source of information.

Alex

P.S.
Information for thoughts:
Initially we ran VMware-2.0.3 on a half of our engineering
workstations in parallel with Linux (SuSE7.1 and SuSE7.3)
After six months of usage, suddenly, all these workstations started to
crash for no apparent reasons. It was looking as a hard drive falure.
In the same time workstations which ran Linux only, continued to run
without any problems. Hardware wise our 12 engineering workstations
are all identical.
Is it possible that running in parallel VMware on Linux could cause
such system crashes?

Subject: [PLUG] X 4.2.0 and font rendering problems
Message-ID: <20020402195030.27D4A10E055@pons.enet.sharplabs.com>

When responding, _please_ be kind to others on the list
and edit all extraneous stuff out.  Thanks.

I am having some strange font rendering problems that I can't figure
out.  There are actually three problems which I'm not even sure are
related.  Also I'm not sure if it's the driver, X, KDE, or Mandrake's
configuration.  I hope someone can point me North.

I'll be as brief as possible but I'm including

     -- /etc/X11/XF86Config-4
     -- /etc/X11/fs/config
     -- /var/log/XFree86.0.log

at the end so you can (maybe) diagnose my problem.

When responding, _please_ be kind to others and edit all extraneous
stuff out.  Thanks.

My system: 

MoBo:           Tyan Tiger S2466N w/ dual Athlon MP 1500+ (1.33GHz)CPUs 

Video Board:    GeForce4 Ti4600
Monitor:         -- Panasync S21 (CRT)
                 -- operating resolution (1600x1200)

Stock Mandrake: Stock 8.2
                 -- XFree 4.2.0
                 -- stock nv driver
                 -- stock KDE
                 -- font antialiasing is OFF by default in stock installation

Problems:

1) missing pixels w/in font strokes.  If I do a "refresh" of the
   desktop _some_ but not all of the missing pixels appear.  The
   "shape" of fonts look fine, i.e. they actually look antialiased.
    
2) If I open a KDE Konsole window (black background, white font-face)
   and cat a bunch of stuff to the screen, or scroll the text there
   will be a lot of white isolated pixels remaining on w/in the black
   background.

   It is as though a font was written at a particular
   location, then when some other letter is written at same location
   (or a space is written) some of the pixels don't get turned off.  A
   desktop refresh completely clears this up as well.

   I don't see this effect w/in an xterm (black background, white font) but
   the "missing pixels" problem of 1) is especially bad.

3) When I enable "antialiased fonts" w/in KDE (and restart KDE)
   all my fonts now look awful.  I don't think it's the classic "abiword"
   font problem.  How do I describe "awful"?  The fonts all look "square"
   both w/in KDE and w/in Konqueror.  However the fonts look noral w/in,
   say Mandrake control center (and emacs).

   Most importantly, turning on antialiasing did _not_ fix 1 and 2 above.


Mandrake Specific problem:

4) Hardrake is not identifiying my GeForce4 at all.  It says
   "NONE Generic VGA".  When installing Mandrake 8.2, the installer
   identified the board as a GeForce3.

I plan to switch to the nVidia binary drivers as soon as I learn how
to install them.  But I'm not sure they will solve these problems.

Ok, that's enough for now. 


Following is the above mentioned system info.  Search on 
</etc/X11/XF86Config-4>, </etc/X11/fs/config>, </var/log/XFree86.0.log>

to get to the head of the appropriate stuff.

                                  Thanks,

I am trying to use xine to view video files and it is dropping many frames.
I looked at the xine fac and it said to use a recent kernal optimized for
your hardware.  I am using a stock kernel installed by the Redhat installer.
If I compile my own kernel would that make it optimized for my hard ware?
Do I need to do something to make it optimized?

Tough one to figure out.

Personally I would start trimming fonts from the catalogue line to
start, i.e. get down to a minimum set of fonts and see what that does.

With so many fonts to choose from you have no idea what X is doing.
It could be trying to render 75dpi fonts as anti-aliases which would
not work well.

The anti-aliasing stuff in X is relatively new.

If the font experiments don't seem to help at all, I'm going to have
to vote for driver problem.

If there is someway to force the use of the regular SVGA server that
would be a good troubleshooting data point also.  There are _many_
problems which only seem to crop up when using the accelerated
servers.

This is not my speciality, but you might try a few things.

In XF86Config-4

 > # **********************************************************************

 > # **********************************************************************
 >

 >     Identifier "Generic VGA"

Try commenting out the first Device stanza (Generic VGA) so X only sees the 
NVIDIA.

In fs/config, reorder your fonts like so

catalogue = /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc:unscaled,
	/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi:unscaled,
	/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi:unscaled,
# 	/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/drakfont,

  	/usr/share/fonts/default/Type1,

  	/usr/share/fonts/ttf/decoratives,
  	/usr/share/fonts/ttf/gb2312,
  	/usr/share/fonts/ttf/japanese,
  	/usr/share/fonts/ttf/western

 >

And try using 100 first, as in
default-resolutions = 100,100,75,75


After you make the changes to /fs/config, restart X.  You may need to 
restart xfs, too.  (I think that's what I forgot to do.)

Indeed it would. If I recall, the stock RH kernels bow to the lowest common denominator (ie, compiled for 386), but I haven't used RH in a while, so I don't know if that's still the case.
Anyhoo, if you compile your own, yes, it'll be optimized for YOUR machine - hardware, modules (if you choose modules over compiled-in), etc...

That lost interrupt error does not look good, have you tried to flash the BIOS?  Maybe a more relevant question, is your BIOS up
to date?

The only other thing I can think of (and it may not be possible for your CD drive) is to flash the firmware of the drive itself.
This is usually only possible with older drives (burners mostly), and you more than likely will have to boot to DOS to run the
flash utility.  Look at the manufacturer's website for more information.

Those are the last of the ideas I have.

Good Luck

Red Hat releases kernels (and glibc, for that matter) built specifically
for i386, i586, i686, and athlon processors. Oh, in UP and SMP versions,
too.

Until the 2.4.9 and 2.2.19 releases, I found myself needing stuff not in
the stock Red Hat kernels (esp., NFS v3). Now, I only build working
kernels for funky architectures like my old Alpha at home or for servers
where I want to strip out extraneous stuff. Otherwise, the stock kernels
rock.

There are many levels of optimization.  From gcc switches to picking out the
right settings for the kernel.  The other applications can also be optimized for
your system, of course that takes a recompile of the application. Mplayer, for
example, won't even talk to you if you didn't compile the application from
source on the box that is running it.

The hard part about compiling your own kernel image is _knowing_ what your
hardware is.  You need to identify the North bridge on the MB, the south bridge
(collectively called the chipset, but both may not be from the same company),
the processor, the video card chipset, the sound card chipset, the NIC chipset
and any other devices attached to the system.  By selecting the correct
hardware, you are optimizing the kernel.  The stock kernel (for example) is
compiled with drivers for BX440 chipsets, FX chipsets, ALI chipsets, AMD
chipsets, SIS chipsets, and all the bug fixes for these, optimize by only
compiling with your chipset selected, leave all of the others out.  This is
especially true for the processor, stock kernels assume you have the lowest
powered processor that will still get the job done.

I'm not sure if this is what you wanted to hear, but I tried anyway.

Good Luck

No, your friend is only breaking the law if the message goes on to offer

Um, you SHOULD be able to do this instead:  `du -xms /*|sort -n`

That will do all of the subdirectories off of / without crossing
filesystem boundaries and just give you totals, in megabytes, for each
subtree.

But I just tried it and -x doesn't seem to do what I thought it should do.

For example /home is an NFS mount, but du -xms /* still attempted to
descend /home.

Does that seem right to anyone?

Does anyone out there know how to get to these meetings from downtown

Find someone to get a ride with.  You could bike, I suppose, but
bus service is lousy in that area.

Yeah, unfortunately I'd say get a ride (which I'll probably try to do
myself... hint, hint).

It's probably possible to take the 12 down to somewhere close by and bike
the rest of the way, but I wasn't paying enough attention last time I was
there to figure it out.

I've only ever seen the "find -mount" to restrict file system traversal.
But, I haven't been admining Linux too long, so maybe there's a few new
tricks I haven't seen. I usually use 'find /filesys -mount -ls | sort -n +6"
and I'm home free, or tail it to see the real biggies I'm interested in.

You could always go to www.tri-met.org and use their Trip Planner, it
works fairly well most of the time, I've gotten some weird trips planned
out for me, but usually they are straight forward.

Looking at www.tri-met.org, the 96 comes within 0.4 miles.  From
downtown it is sorta direct. Timing might be an issue.

Sequoia is the Frontage road from Bonita to Carman Drive  It parallels
72 right there (before 72nd bends at Qualcomm).  You can bicycle down
macadam to Lake Oswego, cross LO to Carman drive and come over.  Or you
could shoot down 99W and pick up 72nd at Costco (before 99w hits 217). 
I am sure there are better bike paths.

There are a quite a few folks from PLUG who will want to go, and they
may be able to car pool.  I know Alan Olsen is looking for a ride.

Yes.

I recently had to upgrade to the 2.4.18 kernel to get my firewire to
work right.  Which it does, very nicely.  When I did that, I noticed the
mplayer AND xine worked quite a bit better.

I can't give you and fancy technical reasons why, bec I have no idea why
but it did for me.  Hope you have the same luck.

I think by using /*, you just passed du a bunch of names, each on which
it should not descend.  How about 'du -xms /'?  That works here.  
In my case it's not too useful, as I have many separate partitions.  I'm 
afraid manually excluding unwanted partitions may be the only practical

Win4lin.

Been running it for two years.  Lightweight and relatively
inexpensive.  Rock solid for stuff like windows + office apps.

Keeps your Windows installation in a linux filesystem so backup and access
directly from linux is easy.

I thought that might be the case... that by explicitly passing /home I'm
telling it to descend the filesystem mounted there.  Out of laziness,
however, I failed to test the theory.

I would think, though, that /home is on / and /home/* is the other
filesystem... I mean to say that the "boundary" is after the /home.  After
all, when I umount /home I still have /home on /.

I know, I know.  Just because you can interpret another way doesn't make
the interpretation true.

Weird that -X takes a file and replaces --exclude-from rather than simply
replacing --exclude.

Does it require you to use a specific kernel ?  Last time I looked (a

Unfortunately for some of us that need bleeding edge drivers and other
goodies that's not an option.

That's why the crossover product looks very promising.

Win4lin has support for kernels up to 2.4.18 I believe (but
I am running it on a laptop with 2.2.18. (Mdk 7.2).

They have a "special relationship"  with Mandrake so that when
a new Mdk dist. is introduced, win4lin has the kernel patches for
it immediately.  The latest Mdk is 8.2 which has 2.4.18.

I'm fixing to install it on my 8.2 desktop as soon as I get
my X/fonts problems solved.
   
They also have _excellent_ support via the  mailing list.

Those interested should subscribe:

http://www.netraverse.com/support/maillists.php

It is relatively low traffic and (almost) noise-free ... unlike (ahem)
some other mailing lists I know of :-)

I have a Mandrake 8.1 installation that boots only
from a floppy. There is no boot selector now
installed--the computer boots straight into Windows if
it doesn't find a boot disk for another OS.

Since the Mandrake installation is at about 5700
cylinders, GRUB would probably be the better choice
for a boot loader. There is a boot partition at
/dev/hda2 and a root partition at /dev/hda3. I also
find a file, /boot/grub/menu.lst containing the
following:

title linux
kernel (hd0,1}/vmlinuz root=/dev/hda3 hdc=ide-scsi
devfs=mount
initrd (hd0,1)/initrd.img

The command /usr/sbin/grub brings up a prompt,
grub>

and there seem to be lots of things you can do. In my
case, the boot loader itself is not even installed!

BTW, those who have Abiword installed from an .rpm and
are complaining about the ugly fonts might take note
of my experience. If you get rid of the .rpm and
install it from a tarball, it will complain about not
being able to install its fonts. But if you dismiss
this screen by clicking on "OK," you can still use
Abiword.

For newer versions of grub there is a command called grub-install that
should write your boot sector (If I remember properly), otherwise there
are some howto's online, or in the info pages, that aren't to hard to
find.  If you really need me to look them up cause you can't find them I
would be happy to, but the grub-install should work fine.

I've got a bookmark at:
http://lists.pdxlinux.org/pipermail/plug/

But It won't load for me, even after warning me about a potentially faulty
certificate.

The last time I tried to use it it looked like it was a couple of days old.

Is there something a member can do to help?

It's a faulty redirect.  If you use
https://lists.pdxlinux.org/pipermail/plug/ instead you'll get it
(note the 'https' instead of 'http').

I checked yesterday and it was running IIS.  I'm guessing it
got /.'d.

Hm, works for me.  Did you accept the unsigned certificate?

It looks like my MSIE is more broken than it is normally. Opera opens the
page just fine.

Sorry for all the noise.

Updated the BIOS today but didn't help.

I'll look into that, but I think this is a controller problem and not
a drive problem.

I ended up putting a second IDE controller (Promise Fasttrack 100) in
the SV25's only PCI slot.

I added Andre Hedrick's IDE patch ( Debian package
"kernel-patch-2.2.20-ide" ) to my kernel to get support for the
Promise controller. The patch includes VIA 686 chipset support, but
selecting it didn't enable DAE.

Anyway, DAE works fine now with the CD-ROM connected to the Promise
controller.

Unfortunately, VMWare still requires kernel patches to run under Linux, so 
that would be my first guess as to where the problem stems.

As far as a full alternative to VMWare, try www.plex86.org. It aims to fully 
virtualize a PC just like VMWare.

Mike,

What version of IE are you using? mod_ssl sometimes has mysterious
problems communicating with IE < 5.01 over https. If
lists.pdxlinux.org exhibits this problem, we may want put a note about
it somewhere.

Hi,

At Dean's request, here is where my personal web pages live:
  http://www.xenotime.net

I meant to rearrange them quite a bit (and make a linux-only page),
but that's too time-consuming...  I have better things to do.

I know that there are lots of dead links here.  I have already used
linklint on it.  I've been adding to this stuff since 1995, but
haven't deleted much.  Please don't report dead links to me.

I'm not interested in contributions to this list.  In fact, I'd like
to reduce its size, not increase it.  This list reflects my personal
tastes and preferences for information.  It's not meant to be
something that everyone will want to use.

That looks worth reporting. Whois says the address is in Speakeasy DSL
space, so I'd send a copy of your logs to abuse at speakeasy.net and let
them know they have a naughty (or compromised) customer.

Looks like it's a Speakeasy member.  You should contact Speakeasy and see
what they'll do for you.  From the number of ports open on this user's
box, it could also be a default install that's been compromised by someone
else.

Galen,

  I do so on the first attempt. On my network, it's always an attempt to
enter via ssh. /var/log/messages tells me the attempte was refused. I track
down the owner of the offending IP address block and ask them to take the
appropriate actions so the attempt is not repeated. I send them a copy of
the line from the log.

  So far I've had either no reponse from the recipient of my message or very
polite notes thanking me for making them aware of the situation. In one case
it was an untended (and poorly administered) linux server sitting in a back
room to which no one should have been able to access.

Something worse than slashdotted, the page that loads from the site now
reads:

That's not worse, that's better.  They got their own FUD shoved back into 
their faces and decided they didn't like the taste.

Serves them right for hosting a MS-Centric site on FreeBSD.

BTW: Some enterprising soul created another site:  http://www.wehavethewayin.com

I went there expecting some crude joke and was pleasantly surprised by a
well organized site providing an entry point into the Unix world.  They
divided the territory into the 3 sections of GNU/Linux, BSD and commercial.
The GNU/Linux section starts with PHB respectable bullet points:

    * A Zona Research study found that more than half of large enterprises
plan to increase their use of GNU/Linux.
    * J.S. Wurzler Underwriting Managers' ``hacker insurance'' costs 5-15%
more if Windows is used instead of Unix or GNU/Linux for Internet operation.
    * The Gartner Group is recommending that businesses drop Microsoft IIS
due to IIS's poor security track record.

And then provides links to other studies and a link to linux.org
distributions list.

The commercial section lists Mac OSX first. The BSD section lists
high-profile adopters Yahoo and Saab and directly addresses the
wehavethewayout site - pointing out that it ran BSD.

Good site to get on the track.

Oh yes, I should probably mention that they are a Windows shop, so
this would be StarOffice on Windows, but that shouldn't really matter
much (as long as you like blue).

Subject: [PLUG] How to join Samba client to Windows domain?
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.33.0204031018370.24791-100000@lukem.com>

I'm trying to get a few Linux boxes running Samba 2.2.2 to join my Windows
domain.  Here's my smb.conf (fields changed to protect the guilty):

[global]
        workgroup = MYCOMPANY
        netbios name = MYSERVER
        interfaces = 192.168.1.2
        bind interfaces only = Yes
        security = DOMAIN
        password server = DC1 DC2
        encrypt passwords = Yes
        preferred master = False
        local master = No
        domain master = False

[ROOT]
        path = /


Next, I try to join the domain:

smbpasswd -j MYCOMPANY -r DC1 -U administrator
Password:
Error connecting to DC1
Unable to join domain MYCOMPANY.


I've tried this from several different Linux boxes and they all behave the
same way.  Any ideas why I can't connect?  Or maybe a suggestion on where
to hunt for the answer?
Thanks,
~M

Try adding the machine to the PDC prior to running smbpasswd. There's no 
mechanism for adding the machine to the domain from the client.

Tyler,

Check out examples and links at http://herring.org/techie.html#procmail and
see if that helps you along. Feel free to post questions as you go.

MSIE 5.50, but I suspect it's broken, it worked fine a week or so ago from
this computer.

I haven't tried it from any other MSIE client.

Today, it loads the page after I accept the certificate, but won't let me
click through to  the archives, except the comprehensive 3Mb version. It
won't let me download the comprehensive version, only view it.

I'll check a few more computers later today and report back.

You could also try Randal's `findbig' Perl script...


#!/usr/bin/perl
require 'getopts.pl';
require 'find.pl';
&Getopts('n:');
$n = defined $opt_n ? $opt_n : 20;
@ARGV = ($ENV{'HOME'}) unless @ARGV;
&find(@ARGV);
sub wanted {
	$size{$name} = -s _ if not -l and -f _;
}
@sorted = sort { $size{$b} <=> $size{$a} } keys %size;
for (@sorted[0..($n-1)]) {
	printf
	    "%40s, %5dK, last accessed %3d days ago\n",
	    $_ , (-s)/1024, -A _;
}

Subject: [PLUG] Linux to Linux Printing Question...
Message-ID: <3CAB5F3C.6050805@physics.orst.edu>

I'm fairly new to Linux so bear with me here...

I've got an HP LaserJet 1100 hooked up to my linux box.  I used the KDE 
printer configuration tool to set it up, and it works great.

However, I am trying to figure out how to allow my co-worker to print to 
my printer (from his linux box) over our LAN.

I have created the file /etc/hosts.lpd and put nothing but a "+" into 
it.  My co-worker doesn't get permission errors anymore (when he tries 
to print to my printer).  In fact, when he prints something to my 
printer he gets no errors, everything seems to be fine, but nothing 
comes out of the printer.

For reference, I am using Red Hat version 7.1

Thanks very much!

Jeff

When I checked it yesterday, the configuration was horribly fubared.

They were trying to use a virtual server, but the permissions were such that 
the server could not get any of the web contents.

I am expecting someone to hack that server and add a picture of a guy with a 
gun to his head and the logo "We have the way out!".

I find it funny that Microsoft is trying to sell people on the idea that 
Microsoft admins need less training than Unix admins.  To do it right, they 
need *MORE* training.  (As well as weird arcane knowledge about what registry 
entries to tweak.) Their sales pitch seems to be "It has a GUI and we have 
lots of money, so it must be better!".

You are more likely to see problems with your video card.

Make sure you are running something with good hardware acceleration and that 
the version of X supports the Xv extension.  (And make sure you have Xv 
support enabled in Xine.)

What kind of video card do you have and what version of XFree86?

It's the webserver configuration on that box, and is my fault.  When you
access that URL, you'll notice that it redirects you.  Blap out the
"/mailman/" part, and then you'll find the archives.

I will fix the configuration later.

They are not unsigned, just signed by my own CA.  The second dialog is

I'm trying to use minicom to talk to the serial interface management

It seems that minicom normally expects to talk to a modem that supports
the Hayes AT command set. What do I need to do to get it to talk to a

First of all, make sure you've got the right cable--Ciscos use a
special "roll-over" cable.  To make it forego the AT initialization,
edit the init strings and just remove it.  And make sure you set
the comm parameters that the Cisco expects.

I just go in to the minicom configuration and blank out the modem init 
string and other modem config strings. That usually clears things up.

Ed,

In addition to the other good advice pay special attention to flow control.
Many routers don't use it and if you have minicom configured for flow
control you won't even get started with the session.

Yup. It works. The first time I tried it, I was connected to a broken
Cisco 678. That's why I asked the question. When I plugged in to the
working 678, it came right up at the usual 115 Kb/s rate. Thanks.

I'd suggest that if you want an accurate answer and not a lot of idle
wild-assed speculation and hearsay, you probably need to consult a
competent attorney (how's that for a wild-assed guess?).

My first question is, "Why would you release something you've patented
under the GPL?"

I mean, if you want to GPL it, don't patent it.  You've already
established prior art and can (given sufficient financial backing) destroy
any subsequent patent claim on the technology.

And if you want patent control, don't GPL it.  The GPL grants a license to
simply redistribute as well as modify and redistribute, so new
implementations of your patented technology will be openly available to
the public.

I don't see what you or the public gains from combining those two
philosophically disparate legal mechanisms.

Finally had the time to sit down and fix this.

Edit line 1387 of /etc/gconf/schemas/galeon.schemas and set it to true.

Count on you to not only _not_ answer my question but, in addition,
(i) to completely ignore my simple request and (ii) to give me a lot
of un-asked-for "advice".  Sheesh.

FYI, I was having an "academic discussion" with a colleague about the
question and I thought that one of the legal eagles on PLUG might know
the answer.

I put my request at the end precisely to AVOID the sort of OFF TOPIC
discussion that I forsaw might occur if it weren't there.

Over and out.

OK, I'm not a lawyer, but I do have 3 mechanical gizmo patents in application 
MYSELF, (and I paid for many billable hour$$$ to get here - just got third 
postcard, and 2 ot of 3 filing receipts from the USPTO) So I hope that this  
experience 'counts.'

In one case, I disclosed a novelty in the claims specification but did not 
claim it as proprietary to me or my invention. By doing so I release this 
portion of the gizmo to public domain, in order to specifically damage a 
possible competitor of mine, whom I though might weasel around an NDA and 
attempt to run off with my invention.

If my innovation as described hits public disclosure at a date (my file date) 
prior to my competitior's patent work in the same area) then I have rendered 
his work useless and killed off for him that particular potential income 
stream. (After all, -everybody else- is doing it free, right?)

This is especially effective if I am a small entity or sole inventor, and my 
potential competitors are BIG CORPORATIONS ...

I do. It's obvious.

What a patent awards is the right to license a specific form of technology.
I can license the technology for umpteen million dollars, give it away for
free, or swap a license for a license for access to other patents. All of
these practices have been done.

Now say I am awarded a patent on the technology foo. I write a reference
application that uses it called foomatic under the GPL. In doing so, I am
granting a cost-free license to everyone who, in turn, uses it in GPL
software. Proprietary software is prohibited from using this technology
by reverse engineering, due to the fact I can sic a bunch of lawyers on
the infringing company in return for a cut of the award/settlement.
Unless they pay the amount I demand of them. It's tilting the playing
field against certain corporations.

A nice little poison pill, I might say. And it would have been useful had
someone done this & pre-empted various low-lifes who patented such
technologies as CSS, hyperlinking, & compression algorithms.

I only wish I were smart enough to think of something worth patenting. It
would be worth the effort to frustrate ``certain corporations".

floppyfw and freesco are two that are used on the list. There are others. It
sounds like floppyfw is the most popular.

I'd google for details.

  Perhaps I'm the last to figure this out, and the only one who cares, but I
just learned that I can submit spamcop reports via lynx on a console.

  Most evenings, when I "quit" work for the day, I exit X but remained
logged in for the occasional e-mail (incoming or outgoing). Sometimes spam
comes through, and I've always waited until the next morning when I again
log in to process it via mozilla.

  This evening, just for giggles, I opened a second console session and
invoked lynx with the URL returned by spamcop. I did have to enter my
username and password (as I do when using mozilla), but it worked!

  *I* think that's cool, even if I'm the only one who cares. :-)

I'm having trouble playing CD's because the software

doesn't appear anywhere on my system: /etc/fstab
refers to my CD-RW as /dev/scd0. Could I rename it in
/etc/fstab, or is there some other solution?

As root:

cd /dev
ln -s scd0 cdrom

That's it.

At a recent computer exposition (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the
computer industry with the auto industry and stated, "If General Motors had
kept up with the technology like the computer industry has, we would all be
driving $25.00 cars that got 1,000 miles to the gallon."

In response to Bill's comments, GM issued a press release stating: 

"If General Motors had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be
driving cars with the following characteristics:"

1. "For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day."

2. "Every time the lines in the road were repainted, you would have to buy a
new car."

3. "Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason. You would
have to pull over to the side of the road, close all of the windows, shut
off the car, restart it, and reopen the windows before you could continue.
For some reason, you would simply accept this."

4. "Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn would cause your
car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to
reinstall the engine."

5. "Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable,
five times as fast and twice as easy to drive -- but would run on only five
percent of the roads."

6. "The oil, water temperature, and alternator warning lights would all

be replaced by a single "General Protection Fault" warning light."

7. "The airbag system would ask "Are you sure?" before deploying."

8. "Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you outand
refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned
the key and grabbed hold of the radio antenna."

9. "Every time GM introduced a new car, car buyers would have to learn to
drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same
manner as the old car."

10. "You'd have to press the "Start" button to turn the engine off."

heres one of my own... 

11.  "you would be unable to change the oil, add wiper fluid or  buy gas
from anything other than a microsoft station.  The under the hood components
are inacessable to the owner!"

Close - but here are a few more:

12. GM would buy a gas station chain, and add a 'performance additive' 
which does nothing but chelate the additives found in other gasoline brands 
in order to clog your fuel filters as punishment for using 'the other guys.'

13. Also, these station would change the shape and size of their fill nozzles 
so you would have to 'upgrade' your car from time to time. The Automotive 
Millenium Adaptor Act would prevent cranky, open-source funnel users from 
subverting this paradigm.

14. If you owned a trailer, you would have to call GM for authorization to 
hook it to your car after the third time, or if you traded out to a new 
trailer. Same goes for a ski/bike rack.

Maybe somebody can help here but His Billness' comments are not original.  I 
remember reading this from a book in the early 80's.  I think the author was 
the founder of Atari or one of the other early computer companies.  The name 
Evans comes to mind.  He used the analogy but the auto was a Rolls Royce in 
his example.

Unmask the plagarist...

I have another Galeon question. My bookmarks folder won't show the bottom 
half of my bookmarks though Konqueror and Mozilla just add the rest in a new

FYI: The "scd" device names are considered deprecated in favor of naming
them with "sr".  If you build your kernel with "devfs", have it mount
that at boot, and IMPORTANT run the "devfsd", you'll find them by that
name, and devfs will create "/dev/cdroms/" with a link to each CD device
inside there.

According to hwbrowser the video card is a SIS 620.  It also says 6306
3D-AGP.  I'm not sure what that means, but I think that AGP stands for
Advanced Graphics Port with is usually a slot on the motherboard that is
similiar to a PCI slot, but is designed for high speed graphics.  This
"card" is actualy on the motherboard, not a seperate card.

According to rpm, I am using XFree86 4.1.0-3.

I don't know whay Xv extension means.  I will research that.

Subject: [PLUG] error compiling gnomemeeting
Message-ID: <3CAC9426.76573263@infotects.com>

Hi all,

I have downloaded the source code for a program called
gnomemeeting (looks and acts like M$ Netmeeting).  I've
followed all the directions, set up the libraries, compiled
all the stuff that it depends on (openH323 and pwlib) and
got configure to run without any errors.  The error happens
during the make process.

gnomemeeting.cpp: In method `void GnomeMeeting::Connect()':
gnomemeeting.cpp:223: no matching function for call to
`GMH323EndPoint::MakeCallLocked (PString &, PString &)'
make[2]: *** [gnomemeeting.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/root/GnomeMeeting-0.85.1/src'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/root/GnomeMeeting-0.85.1'
make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2

As you all may know, I'm not really a programmer and I can't
make heads or tails of this error.  Is there a missing
library, or a broken library, or a messed up compiler,
anyone seen any thing like this?

Google, btw, came up empty :-(

There is a gnomemeeting mail list, but you are required to
sign up before you can post anything to them, I really don't
need another mailing list to monitor.

Thanks

Derek Loree

I would not bother compiling it, and would instead just "apt-get install
gnomemeeting".

I did, but version 0.12 seemed just a little out of date (current version is
0.85 and there are no debian packages, yet).  The older version would
connect, but wouldn't do much after that, I was hoping the newer version
would be more functional.

hehe, does that mean your stumped?

If I remember correctly, the SiS video chipset does not do much in the way of 
accelration. (I will look.)

Might be better support in 4.2.0, but again, I will have to check.

Xvideo.  It is for hardware accelerated full-motion video. Usually used by TV 
cards, but also used by Xine and a few other things.

If you connect to your own port 25 (telnet localhost 25), then just exit
(ctrl-d) without doing anything else, you will probably see the same
message.

Of course that is not a solution for those of us not running Debian.  (And 
switching is not a trivial task.)

Maybe one of these days they will distribute an RPM of apt-get.

Maybe there needs to be some new slogans for apt-get.  How about:

"Apt-get -- It's better than learning how to do it right!"

"Why learn how to compile when you can use apt-get?"

"apt-get -- It's easier than thinking!"

It sounds like the version of openH323 you have installed and the one it wants 
are two different things.  I would check the docs and see what version it 
wants to compile with. i would also check Freshmeat.net for the current 
version.

2. Not trivial, per se, but certainly easy and straightforward.

3. Why not just download and compile the source?

4. These apply to all package management systems, including rpm... ok,
they apply to package management systems that work and are easy to use, so
maybe not RPM.

Actually, I believe that there IS one.  However, it doesn't deal with 
dependencies like Debian's version does.  I tried it on my RH6.1 install 
before switching to Debian.

apt-get -- when you want to get shit DONE instead of fscking around for hours 
with compile-time arguments.

apt-get -- it's easier than having to reinstall via CD an entire point release 
of your favorite distribution!


Now, I realize that some, if not most, Debian users tend to be quite zealous. 
  Especially when it comes to apt-get...  I know I am.  But can we stop the 
petty bickering about which method is the *correct* method of installing apps 
and simply help those who are asking the questions?

Yup, that's it. A hacker just dumped it.

It's hard to imagine for me, that so may people would want to hack into my

Your P200 will work just fine as another drone in a DDoS attack.  Plus,
it'll work great as a launching point for hacking bigger targets.

If you have bought a video card with the new nVIDIA GeForce4 chips
you probably will need to use these drivers---according to "my sources"

Did anyone ever try "debootstrap" and see if it runs on a non-Debian

It has come to my attention that some of you use the PLUG archives
a lot.  This is good.  Unfortunately, we are in the middle of
making some changes. So:

    -  http://PLUG.SkyLab.org
       Contains PLUG archives prior to 2:00 PM on 18 Mar 2002 (time is PST)
       I don't see a link to these on pdxLinux.org.
       I will see about getting one.
       In the long run, we need to move all the PLUG archives to the
       new system.

    -  The main PLUG page at http://www.pdxLinux.org has a link to
       https://lists.pdxlinux.org/mailman/listinfo
       All PLUG lists have been archived on the server since 15 Mar 2002.


YES!!  This is all a bit confusing.  I will see what can be done to
improve matters.

No, it explains both.  Look at the second bug report, the one merged to
the first one with "new version available".

I am surprised that no one has mentioned the fact that wu-ftpd (the
default ftp server in most Linux distros) has multiple vulnerabilities
and should not be used at all.  It has the distinction of being the only
ftp server in years that has had a vulnerability that did not require
write access to be exploited.  Very bad stuff.  Don't just patch it,
turn it off or replace and set strict permissions if you must have it
running.

But I downloaded both of those dependant packages from the gnomemeeting site, I have to
assume they are the correct versions, the programmer said so!

However, I just realized that I didn't dump the older version, and the libraries that came
with that older version.  After I dumped them, there were some holes left, I filled them
with the new headers and it is compiling now.  At least it got past the part that gave the
error last time.

Thanks

Ah, so you still had the -dev packages from the older version of those
libraries installed?  No wonder it did not work right.

If it's not changed drasticly, you could probably build .deb packages of
the new libraries by copying the debian/ directory from the old source
to the new, and making a few changes.  Add a new version to
debian/changelog -- use a point debian version, like -1.0 -- and maybe
edit debian/rules.  That way, when the Debian maintainer finally builds
it, you won't have to manually uninstall it from /usr/local.

Message-ID: <20020404224428.3F40910E055@pons.enet.sharplabs.com>

Couple of days ago I asked for help regarding some odd font rendering
problems I was having.

This is just to let y'all know that the new binary nVIDIA driver
has fixed the font rendering problems I was having, where pixels were
being dropped or left on at random (Problems #1 and  #2 below).

The anti-aliasing and identification problems (#3 and #4) remain.  I'm
coming to understand that #3 is a separate issue having to do with
font selection and many missing TTF fonts on my system.


The good news is that the new nVIDIA seems (so far) to be running
flawlessly with my GeForce4 Ti 4600 card. KDE starts up much faster
the screen is crisp. Very nice (so far).

Next stop TwinView (like Xinerama but built into the driver/hardware)
across a CRT and a DVI-I flatpanel.

Thanks to Kyle Accardi and Brian ? for  their suggestions regarding
the fonts antialiasing.  I'll be looking at that next.

Message-ID: <20020404224700.GA29775@subtend.net>

Couple of questions. RH7.2

1) I have totally munged my perl install.  I've been trying to get
Bugzilla to work and I ended up doing a bunch of CPAN installs with a
root umask of 077.  How can I reinstall perl?  rm -Rf /usr/lib/perl5 and
reinstall the rpm's?

2) I'm installing Bugzilla on a sandbox to test out as an IT trouble
ticketing system.  Management thought it would be better to use Bugzilla
as our engineers use Bugzilla to track issues and it would familiarize
IT staff with supporting Bugzilla if we ran it ourselves.

So is Bugzilla generic enough that it could be used robustly as a
trouble ticket system?  My first approach was to go with Request
Tracker.

When you install packages with CPAN, doesn't it put them in "/usr/local"
someplace, rather than in "/usr"?  It should if it doesn't.  What is
your Perl load-path?

If those are indeed installed where they belong, in /usr/local, then you
can just rm them.

You should be able to reinstall perl by just reinstalling the correct
packages, AFAIK.

Both "bugzilla" and "request-tracker" are Debian packages...  You might
save yourself a lot of headaches by going that route.  There is also
"mantis", which seems to work fairly well.

Another perk would be that you could use "dh-make-perl" to install CPAN
modules.  It will build .deb packages when you do:

# dh-make-perl --build --cpan Perl::Module

You can install those on as many machines as you need to, and if you use
"debarchiver", you can set up an HTTP server to pull them from, if
needed.

Especially if you want hardware acceleration. (nVidia does not provide the

It puts them whereever:

perl -e 'print join ":", @INC;'

indicates they should be, unless specifically directed to otherwise
during the install by overriding variables during the Makefile.PL
build stage:

perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/lib
perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~

ala perldoc ExtUtils::MakeMaker

There is perl under /usr/local as well as /usr.  Maybe I'll wipe them
all.

:) Disregard my headers, as my first line was 
"Couple of questions. RH7.2"

I'm an avid Debian user at home and on personal servers.  At work OTOH
I'm stuck with the archaic RPM system.

The SiS 620 is supposed to be supported in accelerated mode by that version.

What does /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 look like? You might be loading the wrong 
video driver or not loading the correct modules to get acceleration out of 
the driver.

That depends upon what you're tracking.  If you want a generic tracker for
"User had an ID10T error and can't log in", Bugzilla is not a great choice.
It's extremely geared towards software development.  At my work, we use
Bugzilla and most of the fields (such as, what OS is the problem occurring
on) have little bearing to our Web development.  Further, Bugzilla doesn't
seem to allow much customization of this, so users often have to ignore a
lot of miscellaneous information to get to what they need.

On the other hand, I hear the new version of Bugzilla will be out soon.  It
will be much more modularized and use templates that will make customization
much earlier.

Subject: Job Posting

Hi, David,

Here's the announcement:

Crossnodes <http://crossnodes.com> is internet.com's site for coverage of
networking news and information.  I recently took over Crossnodes after a
few years with LinuxToday, and I'd like to provide writing opportunities to
skilled Linux (or Unix) networkers who have experience in:

* migration to Linux/Unix from other NOS's
* integration of Linux/Unix into Netware and Windows networks
* Linux/Unix security
* general network management

The site is still very much in transition and I'm willing to try a lot of
formats out, but I have particular interest in product reviews/analysis
(either proprietary or open source/free software) and writing that relates
to solving particular problems or issues.

I'm also very interested in hearing from people who are proficient
technically but not as confident in their writing skills: I'm trying to
bring a sense to the site that IT professionals are communicating to each
other, with the editorial staff present to facilitate.  To that end, I
am willing to work closely with new or inexperienced writers provided
they're willing to accept some guidance and the occasional rewrite.

Some basic qualifications:

* Experience in multiple platforms and a willingness to make fair
comparisons to other platforms where appropriate
* Willingness to work with an editor
* Willingness to honor deadlines, which we'll always establish
to suit your needs

Pay:

We don't have a set rate for stories, but articles generally earn $250-$300.
That will be negotiated on a per-item basis: more in-depth or lengthy work
earns more.

Additional Information:

I'm also looking for writers with skill sets in other areas of networking.
If you're strong in Netware or even MS OS's, I'm happy to hear from you as
well.

This is a straightforward freelance arrangement, not a job, though editors
enjoy building relationships with consistent writers.  Anyone who's
interested can reach me at the address below or call my office
(503.236.4889) to set a time to discuss things further.  I'll have an
editorial guidelines sheet ready by early next week as well.


Kind regards,

--

The reason we have dual-boot systems is because no one
can live without Microsoft Office. However, according
to Codeweavers, there is now an application costing
$54 (or $64 with media) that will allow you to run
Office 97/2000 on Linux. It's probably a hoax of some
kind--they have a bridge they'd like to sell you,
too--but does anyone know more about it?

If so, it will be a disaster for Win4Lin, in all
likelihood. You still need to have Windows installed
to use the Netraverse product. (Perhaps you can get
away with using another copy of Windows installed
somewhere else, however.)

Uggg, it still didn't work, though it got much further along.  I'm guessing that more gnome-dev
stuff needs to be installed before this thing will go, but the latest error has to do with
videograbber and a function called PVideoInputDevice.  This is turning into a lot of work for
something that may or may not do what I want it to.

Thanks for the information.  As always, it has been a meaningful learning experience.

Did you run "apt-get build-dep gnomemeeting"?

What release are you pointed at?  Unstable or Testing?

I don't know whether to laugh or cry. I got a spam today from an outfit

  I still suggest that people never reply to spam, as we all know it 
simply validates their email address should an engine be set up to 
account for that at the from or reply-to address.

However, recently a friend informed me that he was getting a 
considerable ammount of spam until he followed the "remove" instructions 
enclosed in his spam emails and they stopped coming. I will ask him for 
more detail, though this raises the question: Are there any recent 
studies on the effectiveness of these remove links?
My guess is that supposing 9 out of 10 work, that 1 in 10 will get you 
more unremovable spam than you can shake a NIC card at.

  When I called the optamail.com folks on the phone they said that their
removal URL actually works. I told them why I didn't use it and they
responded by (ahem!) "removing" my name from all their distribution lists.
This worked for about a month. I'm now back to receiving spam from all the
spammers they support (optamail.com, and their upstream ISP --
appliedtheory.com -- are spam factories). I'm more than a little annoyed.

  What I learned, second hand, was that Applied Theory Communications, Inc.
in Syracuse, NY is in deep financial trouble. They won't drop spammers or
anyone else as long as they pay the bills. Optamail.com is run from an
answering machine in New York City. Cannot contact a human at that number or
via e-mail.

  Some of the other spam factories have either invalid phone numbers or none
listed on their records. Some have administrative contact addresses at
hotmail.com! (I wish all the free e-mail hosts would go away.)

  One of the current crop of spam factories works through cerf.net. I've
traced this to their parent organization, att.com. When I spoke with someone
at AT&T they told me the proper address for reporting cerf.net-distributed
spam is 'noc at attens.com' (for AT&T's Enhanced Network Services, which is
cerf.net). So far, both spam reports and other e-mail to the Network
Operations Center have gone unanswered.

  Wish I had more of an answer for you, but it's a waste of time and
resources for us all.

When configuring httpd, is it my true email address that I place in 
ServerAdmin? That seems insecure. I'm using Running Linux 3rd Ed as the 
model, but Mandrake 8.2 has a much more complex Apache.

Generally, it's the webmaster's email address. I don't know how this would
compromise security in any way. If you want to make life more difficult for
web bots that harvest email addresses, you can do as I have...

[root at kippered root]# grep ServerAdmin /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
ServerAdmin webmaster@&#104;errin&#103;.org

...modifying it, of course.

you can use the <Directory "/absolute/path/to/directory">
directives....and make an alias:
if you have mod_alias installed as follows:
Alias /IPcop/ "/absolute/path/to/ipcop/directory/"

to find out what apache modules you have loaded, simply run the httpd 
executable with a -l argument:
/www/bin/httpd -l

you may want to limit access to this directory by only allowing traffic from 
your local network....

I'm not very familiar with IPcop....it looks to me as though IPcop is a full 
linux install, though.....and should do everything you need more or less out 
of the box....


hope this helps....

As mentioned by others on this list, spamassassin works great.  In fact,
your email was delivered to my work account which has little spam
protection.  But at home where spamassassin is installed the body of the
spam you included triggered enough alarms that it was rejected.

If you (anyone) are running an older system or one not supported by the
spamassassin RPMs the tar ball is an easy install.

ooooh...

I see a number of issues with this config....
1)	Your cdrom should not be accessable via apache.....
2)	same as number 1
3)	The Alias I was referring to is an Apache directive (in httpd.conf)...not 
the shell alias...under the section <IfModule mod_alias.c>
4)	It looks like you are running RatHed (or redhat -- as you may call it) 
...and it looks like you have a tarball (.tgz or .tar.gz) on the CDROM .. I 
guess IPcop is a full linux install....from what I read at their site....this 
is a full operating system and is not a program....simply a slimmed down 
Linux distro with firewall utilities....it seems that if you want to use it, 
that you should install IPcop on that machine rather than the existing Linux 
install......

If you are looking for a firewall, redhat has various tools for doing this 
that would waste alot less of your time....ipfw of ipchains or something like 
that....I would also recommend installing software from source code, once you 
are comfortable with compiling, etc...

Some things to think about are as follows:
-)remove unnecessary programs and other things from your firewall box.
-)perhaps look into the possibility of using FreeBSD as a firewall....FreeBSD 
(IMHO) has easier kernel configuration and makes a better firewall....there 
is tons of info regarding this on the web.
-)You may be able to do your firewalling with routers/switches, etc depending 
upon your network connectivity....if you need/want a web interface, I can 
write you a small, secure webserver that can give you stats, and help you 
configure the firewall without the overhead of a FULL apache install....
-)firewall configuration should NOT be accesable from outside your network...
because if you can do it, so can someone else....the magic acronym is ACL....
Access Control List....

If you need help with any of this stuff, please feel free to email me 
off-list...bhoran at hexdev.com

sorry about the verbose rant...

-Brian

What ever happened to the idea of listing the spamming domain somewhere? I 
thought I remembered some members of PLUG discussing this in here.

I, for one, have no problem adding spamming domains to my own black list so 
they bounce.

Sandy,

  That gives me hope! I have my Toshiba Portege 3025CT talking to the
Kyocera QCP-6035 phone (using the *very* expensive Kyocera data cable), but
I cannot get a connection when I try dialing into my Aracnet shell account;
the connection is instantly dropped. I've no idea how to debug this problem,
but I want to work on it this weekend.

Thanks,

Rich

I think I am getting somewhere now.  I didn't have much time to look at this
last night as I was helping someone else with their computer.  I looked at
the ~/.xine/config file and if I read it correctly, it is using SXhm.  (I
don't know what the really means, but it's in the faq.)  I tried to use Xv
by typing:

xine -V Xv

It gave a message saying that it could not load the library for Xv and
terminated.  I looked in /usr/X11R6/lib/ and found both libXv.a and
libXv.so.

I was confused to find different copies of XF86Config.  I thought that the
one that was used was /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config.  There was also
/etc/X11/XF86Config-4 and /etc/X11/XF86Config.  These were all created when
I installed RH 7.2  It looks to me like there are several drivers listed.  I
don't know which is in use.  I really appreciate your help.  

Here is part of my /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config that may be relevant:

See if you like "mantis" once:

  http://bugs.netule.org/

That site is somewhat experimental at this stage.  We've not for sure
decided on using Mantis.  What do you think?  It's PHP with a mysql
database backend.  I hope it upgrades fine...  if he changes the
database schema, it could blow away a valuable BTS database, unless the
upgrade properly manages the schema migration.

  I still suggest that people never reply to spam, as we all know it 
simply validates their email address should an engine be set up to 
account for that at the from or reply-to address.

However, recently a friend informed me that he was getting a 
considerable ammount of spam until he followed the "remove" instructions

enclosed in his spam emails and they stopped coming. I will ask him for 
more detail, though this raises the question: Are there any recent 
studies on the effectiveness of these remove links?
My guess is that supposing 9 out of 10 work, that 1 in 10 will get you 
more unremovable spam than you can shake a NIC card at.

Ben,

  About what I would have expected. But, I'm trying something a little
different.

  Although I'm not a lawyer -- and won't play one on TV, either -- I decided
that ORS 646.872 probably applies to e-mail as well as paper facsimile
transmissions. After all, we're not getting the original message, but a
digitally transmitted copy sent over telphone lines. Regardless of whether
the recipient (me, in this case) sees the message on a piece of paper coming
out of the fax machine or an e-mail in pine, the delivered copy is a
facsimile of the original.

  So, I'm sending the details of the ORS (including the potential for fines
and penalties up to $25,000 per incident and costs of investigation) along
with the spamcop reports. I let them know, too, that one more UCE and I turn
loose my corporate attorney and the state's Attorney General's office. We'll
see what happens. :-)

Subject: [PLUG] Samba Issue
Message-ID: <20020405222215.GA30010@boora.com>

Strange issue.  I'm sharing a printer from Linux in a windows network.
It's used to print PDF files.  I have several samba printer shares on
this box.  Now several people (not all) are having trouble connecting to
the printer.  Generally, you can double-click on the printer share icon
in "My Network Places" (Win2000) and the drivers will load and the
printer will be added to your computer.  For these unfortunate few, they
get an "Unable to Connect" message at the top of the printer window.
The other printer on that box has no connection issues.

Here is a snippet from smb.conf showing both printers.  The one called
pdf is the bad one.

[pdf]
path = /tmp
guest ok = Yes
printable = Yes
print command = /usr/bin/printpdf %s
lpq command =
lprm command =
printer driver =HP DesignJet 750C/PS
printer driver file =/etc/samba/printerdrivers/printers.def
printer driver location	= /etc/samba/printerdriver

[ProjInfoPinter]
path =	/tmp
guest ok = Yes
printable =Yes
print command =	/usr/bin/printpdfprojinfo %s
lpq command = 
lprm command =
printer driver=	HPLaserJet 5/5M	PostScript
printer	driver file = /etc/samba/printerdrivers/printers.def

This is the log from samba.

Which cable modems are compliant with ATT specifications and are Linux
frendly?

Can ATT find out if you are running a DHCP server if you have a Linux box
connected directly to their cable modem?

I'm helping a friend set up a network and I'm using my network as an
example with the exception that I have DSL and a ISP that says
private networks are cool and ATT that uses cable modems and says private
networks are not.

He is willing to pay for connecting his kids computers to the modem when
he gets things configured, but wants to test things first.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0204051513250.27281-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  Today's mail brought an upgrade to BRU-17.0. This is the backup software
I've used for the past four years and I was quite happy when the employees
bought the name and products after the company tanked. (It's now The Tolis
Group.)

  Anyway, I know that from time to time questions have been raised here
about what backup software to use, especially in a mixed-OS, enterprise
environment. Because I didn't recognize the significance of the
"Workstation" chop on the CD, I called them to ask. It's the same
network-capable version I've been using all along. But, the reason I write
is that they have a couple of other products that folks here might want to
consider.

  On the high end is their new BRU-Pro 2.0. It now supports tape libraries
and mixed OS environments. Next week they'll have their W2K clients
available (in addition to the NT/9x/whatever clients). From a linux (or
other UNIX) server you can now back up everything.

  On the lower end are the SOHO offering and a home user offering.

  The reason I'm enthused about the company and its products is the superb
support they've always offered. One of their executives (I think he's now
the President) was a constant presence on the floppy-tape mail list years
ago and walked me through the configuration of my old Colorado Memory
Systems floppy tape drive with BRU-14 or -15. That kind of help wins my
loyalty. Over the years I've had problems with tape drives (as some of you
know only too well) that were resolved by going to a high-end drive; at
least, high end for my small operation: the Tandberg SLR-60. Since that was
installed summer before last I've had absolutely no backup problems. The BRU
crew went the extra mile helping me diagnose where the problem was (they
worked with Tandberg's tech support on the previous drive's problems) and
they helped me tune the command line for the new drive.

  So, using BRU costs more than tar, dump, cpio and uucp but it's been well
worth the money for me. I don't mind recommending them because of the value
they've given to me over the years.

  Try Xfce (http://www.xfce.org). Light, fast, functional. If I knew how to
find out how much memory xfce is using[1], I'd tell you in this message.

memory usage.

I think you could reasonably say a T-[13], a DSL, frame relay, ATM,
etc. being also used for voice communications probably also count
as a "telephone line" even if not being used for voice.

Nice start, Wil. Think of what a nice addition to the PLUG website

AT&T provided me with an RCA Model DCM235. I have it connected to a
Netgear RT314 router and have 2 Linux and 3 Windows machines connected
to it. The router is running as a DHCP server on the private side and a
DHCP client on the AT&T side. The same sort of thing is done by others
on this list with a Linux floppy firewall machine serving as the router.

Mine works fine. No complaints from AT&T.

You may be confusing AT&T's rule against running a server over their
network with having your own private network that shares access to the
Internet through their network. I don't think they care how many
machines connect through their modem as long as the bandwidth consumed
is reasonable. On the other hand, AT&T rewrites their rules from time to
time, so what they are saying now may be different from what they said
when I got started. Back then, when it was @home, they provided a web
page or two that gave instructions on how to set up a home network.

I recall that one of the options used to be having more than one IP
address, and that you paid extra for that. Again, as long as the
bandwidth consumed is reasonable, they probably don't care.

Having started this thread, I should add another data point.

I called a bunch of Verizon dealers (in Corvallis and on the SF
Peninsula) with a simple proposition: I walk in with a laptop and you
supply a phone and data cable.  If I'm able to dial into my ISP I buy
the phone, cable, and service contract from you.  If not, I leave.

Most either didn't even understand what I wanted or don't stock data
cables.  But Radio Shack (Corvallis) had someone able to tell me that
the Samsung T300 would work, and happy to just sell me the cable (for
$40).  This I plugged into a borrowed T300, and connected to a shell
account at my ISP long enough to send some email using pine and emacs.
I've not yet tried to get PPP going, but don't expect any trouble.

So: Samsung T300 ($130 from a local Verizon dealer with a $45/month
1-year plan) works with Linux.  (Debian Woody on a Dell Latitude CPx,
though I can't imagine that matters.)

Any cable modem that is docsis 1.0-1.1 should be good to go, Motorola, RCA, 
3Com, Com21.

As to doing NAT, this is kind of a confusing issue, however on their web page 
they have instructions and sell linksys devices that will facilitate NAT, so 
it must be ok.

With AT&T BI, at least at the moment, there isn't a problem running nat, etc.
The problem might come later, after Comcast's purchase of AT&T Broadband goes
through.

There were news stories in EE Times, etc. a couple of months ago about cable
companies complaining that people using routers, nat protocols, etc. to connect
multiple computers to one cable outlet were "stealing" service.  They wanted
everybody running more than one system to register them and pay an additional
fee.

AT&T was not part of that group.

I haven't used my laptop for a few weeks. I just plugged it in, turned
it on, booted RH 7.1, started up Mozilla, and tried to browse the
Internet. I can see my other Linux machine's web server, but can't get
out on the Internet. I get the message, 

  The connection was refused when attempting to contact www.google.com

I get a similar message for any web site I try to access on the Internet
side of my router. I'm typing this message on another machine that is
able to get through the router.

This hasn't happened before. I used to be able to browse with the
laptop. Any ideas where I should start looking for the problem?

Run /sbin/ifconfig eth0 at the command line and make sure you have an ip
address. 

Also try to ping an ip address outside your lan. Check your
/etc/resolv.conf and make sure your DNS servers are listed.

When I try to run ping from my laptop I get this message:

Both the laptop and the server have the same contents:

  search steffensfamily.com
  nameserver 192.168.0.1

steffensfamily.com is what someone else on this list recommended. There
is no such thing, as far as I know.

192.168.0.1 is my router. It works fine for the other machines in the
house.

Yeah, you don't need that line unless your local network is configured in
such a way that your machines believe they are in that domain and it's
used in the hosts files or local DNS.

Did you check to see that the system has a route to the outside world?

`route -n` should look something, if not exactly, like this:

Destination     Gateway         Genmask       Flags Metric Ref Use Iface
192.168.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0 U     0      0     0 eth0
0.0.0.0         192.168.0.1     0.0.0.0       UG    0      0     0 eth0

Sounds to me like you've got the first route for the localnet, but not the
second, for a gateway out.

Richard,

  What do you see when you run /sbin/ifconfig eth0? It should be something
like this:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ /sbin/ifconfig eth0
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:40:05:42:B6:04
          inet addr:192.168.55.1  Bcast:192.168.55.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:343487706 errors:0 dropped:150 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:233177892 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:19096982 txqueuelen:100
          Interrupt:10 Base address:0xe400

  If this doesn't come up then eth0 is not running. In that case, try
running `/etc/rc.d/init.d/network restart'.

  My notebook (a Toshiba Portege 3025CT) stopped loading the network upon
boot after a while. So, I put the command in /etc/rc.d/rc.local/ to make
sure I have a network connection when I boot the tyke. Looks from here as
though you don't have the network modules running on your laptop.

  It may be different with a cable connection than with my DSL line, but
here /etc/resolve.conf contains the primary and secondary DNS servers for my
ISP.

HTH,

Rich

This looks promising. Here's what I have:

Destination   Gateway   Genmask         Flags Metric Ref Use Iface
192.168.0.0   0.0.0.0   255.255.255.0   U     0      0     0 eth0
127.0.0.0     0.0.0.0   255.0.0.0       U     0      0     0 lo

Looks like a bit of configuration is wrong. What do I change to affect
the second line?

The second line is fine.  Type this to set your gateway:

route add default gw 192.168.0.1

eth0 is running; I can communicate with the other machines in the house.

Your second line is fine, that's just a route to the loopback device.

You need a NEW line that signifies a route to the outside world.

You can do this manually by adding a route as route.  The syntax is as
follows:
route add default gw 192.168.0.1

After adding that route, you'll have the following output from route -n:

Destination   Gateway     Genmask         Flags Metric Ref Use Iface
192.168.0.0   0.0.0.0     255.255.255.0   U     0      0     0 eth0
127.0.0.0     0.0.0.0     255.0.0.0       U     0      0     0 lo
0.0.0.0       192.168.0.1 0.0.0.0         UG    0      0     0 eth0

That helps. Now I get:

Destination   Gateway       Genmask         Flags Metric Ref Use Iface
192.168.0.0   0.0.0.0       255.255.255.0   U     0      0     0 eth0

0.0.0.0       192.168.0.1   0.0.0.0         UG    0      0     0 eth0

and I can browse the Internet. But, if I restart the network, the third
line is no longer there. However, this did suggest a place to look. I
logged out and logged back in as root and looked in the Gnome menus for
something with which to set configurations -- I didn't remember what it
was called. I found LinuxConf and sure enough, there was a place to put
the Gateway, and it was empty. I put 192.168.0.1 into that field.
Everything works as expected. Plus, now that I remember what it's
called, I can su and run /sbin/linuxconf without logging out and logging
back in as root.

Thanks to all for your assistance.

Does LinuxConf still maintain it's own database of what is in the file?  I 
think I had some problem with that a while back.  When I would hand edit a 
file, then later use LinuxConf, it would not know about the editing I did by 
hand and write the file from it's database without my hand edited changes. 
That is why I only hand edit now.  Does it still do that?

Subject: [PLUG] Samba newbie smbstatus problem
Message-ID: <gu6jhm.3pj@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

I finally bought the "Samba for Dummies" book today as the resources on the 
web assume I have a degree in networking (in which case I wouldn't need the 
them -c22).  So finally I am geting somewhere...well...

Samba appears to my newbie understanding to be up and running now, but if I 
type " smbstatus "  it says:

Failed to open byte range locking database
ERROR: Failed to initialise locking database
Can't initialise locking module - exiting

Now what to I do?

Also, is there any way to cut and paste text from the shell window to knode 
or a word processor so I don't have to type all my error messages?

Thanks
Robert

netcfg works great and it edits the actual files, no separate weirdness that
comes with linuxconf. I'll never use it again.

I'm not sure what distro you're running, but on my RedHat systems I can run:
/etc/rc.d/init.d/smb restart
When I run that, I can get more details about how it's doing.

What version of Windows are you running? There are encrypted passwords
issues with Win95.

I use Kmail for my error message posts whan I can, crtl-c and crtl-v work
for cutting and pasting from within terminal windows and Kmail.

There's a couple of GUIs for smaba, the one I like is called gnosamba.

It has been a while since I set up Samba, but I think you have to type smbd 
and nmbd at the command line to start Samba.  You may have to use /sbin/smbd 
and /sbin/nmbd if it is not in your path.  If you have not added it to your 
init scripts to start automatically, you will have to do it each time you 
boot the machine.

I don't know what that error is, I have never seen it.  You might try it on 
google.com to see if it gives you any answers

With many terminals you just highlight the text with your left mouse button, 
then go to an editor and click with the third button if you have one, or with 
both the left and right buttons simultaneously.  that should paste the text 
into an editor.

Oops, just as I sent that I remembered it is /usr/sbin/smbd and nmbd.  And I 
think you have to be the root user.

I took a look at the smbstatus command, and it appears to only tell you what 
ACTIVE connections you have.  If you are not connected via smbclient to some 
directory on the other end, it will not be doing any file locking, and will 
not report any active user.  This may explain your error if you are just 
checking smbstatus without any active client connected.

Kate, the advanced KDE text editor, does Vertical Select! Now is that cool or 
what! 

Someone will doubtless explain in a bored voice Oh, Vi and Emacs and other 
Unix editors have done that for like forever. 

Whatever- I think it's cool.  Doesn't take much to make me happy.

If you are running a RedHat distro, then the GATEWAY statement should be
placed in the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 file.  This will
create the gateway, default route at bootup, or whenever you up the eth0
device.

Another way is to redirect the output of the command you type in the
shell window to a file. For example,

  smbstatus > statusfile

will put the text that would have been sent to the shell window into the
file named statusfile.

When running the RedHad "up2date" I get the warning:

I assume that this has something to do with the fact the up2date

Does this mean that the new up2date has not been installed and I
should do that by hand?  Or does it mean something else?

Easy thing to do is diff up2date up2date.rpmnew and see the differences.
These are configuration files that rpm wants to install.  It is trying to be
nice and not stomp on your current configuration.

If I had two processors on my machine, do they have to be the same

boost will I get from adding the 350?  Is this even worth going out and
buying a bigger power source?

Jon,

I can't say for sure, but I suspect you don't want to try it based on my 2P
experience. I'm running a Pentium Pro 200 w/2 processors. The ones which
came with the box were a different stepping, and I was catching all kinds of
exceptions. I replaced them with a matched set ($50 new!) and have had no
more problems.

Rarely does SMP work with different-speed processors.  In fact, from 
what I understand, it doesn't work at all.  You might be able to get 
around the problem by underclocking your 400 (or overclocking your 350, 
though not reccomended) so they match.  But then, as Sandy pointed out, 
you might run into some stepping issues.

Best use of a 350 would be to find yourself an board that supports it 
and build another system. ;)

Mike,

  It means that the new version found an existing configuration script and
did not overwrite it. You can visually compare the two, or use diff to tell
you the differences.

  Red Hat -- and, perhaps, others -- is rather nice that way. It won't put
the default config file in place and overwrite whatever you had before. It
installs it with the .rpmnew extension and let's you know there may be
changes you want to make.

Take a look at http://www.2cpu.com
Its a pretty good resource for SMP systems.
I've been an SMP user for a few years now, and I've found if I have any
questions or problems, the people there in the forums most often provide
good answers.

With AT&T BI, at least at the moment, there isn't a problem running nat,
etc.
The problem might come later, after Comcast's purchase of AT&T Broadband
goes
through.

There were news stories in EE Times, etc. a couple of months ago about
cable
companies complaining that people using routers, nat protocols, etc. to
connect
multiple computers to one cable outlet were "stealing" service.  They
wanted
everybody running more than one system to register them and pay an
additional
fee.

AT&T was not part of that group.

NAT == network address translation or translators.  Various NAT's are
masquerading, port forwarding, and server pooling.

They have to be the same speed and should be the same "stepping"
(sort of like a CPU revision number).

I agree, although there is an AMP (asymmetric MP) patch out there
somewhere, if you are desprate to try it out.  :)

I have a dual-proc IBM intellistation 360 at work that has
2 P4's in it, same speed, but different steppings....
it works (so far).

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0204080914350.2839-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  The following e-mail was sent to my local state legislators. You can find
your representative and legislator from the Oregon state web site. I urge
you to send them the equivalent (or, the same e-mail for all I care) as we
try to have Oregon join Washington in having a state law against spamming.

Thanks,

Rich

---------- Forwarded message ----------

John/Karen,

  I just learned that ORS 646.872 applies only to paper facsimilies sent to
a fax machine that are unsolicited and continue despite requests to have
them stopped. I've taken advantage of this law on a couple of aggressive fax
spammers.

  The Direct Marketing Association maintains lists of those of us who opt
out of receiving unsolicited paper mail and telemarketing calls. About twice
a year I renew my desire to not receive unsolicited junk mail and
telemarketing calls.

  Banks, insurance companies, utilities and other entities also allow me the
opportunity to opt out of their sharing information about me with other
business units or entities. This cuts down on those unsolicited (and
unwanted) advertisements.

  Electronic mail (e-mail) spam is, so far, exempt from these laws. Many of
these firms send Unsolicited Commercial E-mail (UCE, or spam) despite
repeated attempts to have them stop.

  One of the most egregious violater of my privace and right to be left
alone is a domain called 'optamail.com'. This is a part of THE HUMOR NETWORK
LLC (owned by Eric Targan and with a registred address and phone number of
54 W. 39th Street, New York, NY 10018, Phone: 212-561-1956, Fax:
212-769-9060; Email: hostmaster at humornetwork.com). Calls to that telephone
number are answered by machine and never returned; e-mails to that address
do not generate a response. The ISP used by optamail.com is run by Applied
Theory Communications, Inc. (125 Elwood Davis Road, Syracuse, NY 13212-4311,
315-453-2912, (FAX) 315-453-3052). A telephone call there resulted in their
claim that optamail.com is not one of their customers.

  I urge you to modify Oregon's Statutes before the next scheduled
legislative session in 2003 to close this gap. Perhaps ORS 646.872 can be
modified to include electronic mail; perhaps a similar law can be passed by
declaring an emergency and acting now.

  If you need substantiating documentation of this abuse, as well as other
known spam factories, please let me know. I will arrange for abundant
evidence to be provided to support such legislation.

Thank you very much,

Rich

Or as a module available to be enabled as needed? It'd be best for me if
the stock kernel from Debian has everything I need.  I have several
other installations I can check for that.  
Perhaps that PMFirewall .deb file will check that detail for me.

Mine reports like so when I have no active
connections:

Samba version 2.2.3a
Service      uid      gid      pid     machine
----------------------------------------------

No locked files


So whatever error that is, it isn't about a lack a
clients :)

How about popup ads?

ALTHOUGH the following is on the Windows platform, it *IS* noteworthy 
because of the greater spam issue - and things like this for Linux may 
not be far behind.

GAIN/Gator has a new one which is included with some installs, the DivX5 
Pro bundle being one example.  DivX is a fine product, but I wish they 
would use another advertiser supported method than GAIN.  Gain installs 
as secretly as possible, and mannages to prefetch its ad-seeker when you 
load your broswer (usually IE on Win) and even bypasses the popup killer 
and ad blockers.  There are no entries in Add/Remove Programs like a 
standard Winapp.  with a little digging, I found the offender was 
GMT.EXE and killed every reference to it I could find.  It seems to do 
the trick.  Last night I did this on Savenow.exe - another one on my 
fiance's laptop, and now it won't boot - chokes at LILO (dual boot).  I 
can't really attribute this to killing Savenow.exe but it does make a 
guy wonder. (incidentally I can't boot to Linux either, as I removed it 
days ago to free up HD space for her - my laptop arrives tomorrow and it 
will dual boot).

Odd, when I do smbstatus on my Workstation running RH7.2 with samba 2.2.1a I 
get the same as you show above.  When I do it on my Server running RH6.2 with 
samba 2.0.6-9, I get "couldn't open status file /var/lock/samba/STATUS..LCK". 
 I checked /var/lock/samba and there is no such file there.  Then I tried to 
compare /var/lock/samba on the RH7.2 workstation, and there is no such 
directory at all, the files are in different locations there.  I don't know 
if this means different versions do things differently, or if there may be a 
problem with the setup on my server.  [are they both saying there are no 
locked files in a different way?]   Functionally they both work fine, and 
have for at least a year now.   I use them both to browse and copy files with 
a W98 box on the network.  Of course on a single user network, a lack of file 
locking may not cause problems.  I will compare the smb.conf files later to 
see if there are any diff's.  Thanks for pointing that out.

Greg, et al.:

  I did not post my message to start a comment thread, but to invite those
who wished to try to get legislation in Oregon to do something. My message
was appended to make it easier.

  Russell is correct that this is not strictly a linux thread so discussion
on this list may not be warranted. Of course, I welcome off-list comments
(or flames, as you wish) if anyone has thoughts to share with me.

It takes a very special motherboard, with independant chipsets.  Definetely not
cost effective.

Not possible, the multipliers are locked, and the bus speed has to be the same,
using a common chipset.

After years of battling X and PCMCIA on my laptop, I'm thinking about
upgrading to a newer one.  A Dell Inspiron 2600 looks like it matches
my needs almost exactly, but there are no entries for it on the

Do any of you have experience putting Linux (preferably Red Hat) on
that particular model, or know if the 2600 is close to any of the other

[snip]

I thought some of you might like to know that it is possible to
compile gnomemeeting from the source on the web site.  The
problem I had was with older versions of the two libraries that
come with the gnomemeeting source.  The first one I had
identified last week, openH323.  The other library comes from
the web site as pwlib, but there is no debian package called
pwlib.  However, by looking at the dependancies of the packaged
version of gnomemeeting I was able to determine (by trial and
error) that the package name was libpt.  Once I removed both of
those packages, gnomemeeting finished compiling, installed
without a hitch and now runs.  Unfortunately, it is still very
limited in what it can do, but at least it runs!

Thanks for the help

Subject: [PLUG] vinum size on disk
Message-ID: <3CB1A8A0.4198.6A49367@localhost>

Since February, I've been experimenting with FreeBSD's volume manager, called vinum.  
http://www.vinumvm.org/

When I create files on this volume, and share it to a Samba network, I've found that Windows 2000 reports a very large discrepency between the size of the file and the size on the disk.

For example:
Size:                          273 KB (280,542 bytes)
Size on disk:               8.00 MB (8,388,608 bytes)

I don't know where that "8.00 MB" comes from.  I can't find a similar number looking at the same file from the localhost.

I've created several different configurations.  And, I've observed the same issue under each type of organization. The figures above are what I see when reading a file on a 375GB RAID5 volume, constructed from four 115 GB  
IDE drives, on a Promise Ultra100 TX2 card,  mounted for sharing on a Samba network.  Currently Running FreeBSD 4.4-STABLE

Windows 2000 does not have similar problems when reading Samba shares to normal volumes.

What am I looking at?  Is this a problem with Windows 2000?  Have I set up my vinum volume incorrectly?

Below are my file system preferences.  Have I mis-set something?

tunefs: soft updates:  (-n)                                enabled
tunefs: maximum contiguous block count: (-a)               15
tunefs: rotational delay between contiguous blocks: (-d)   0 ms
tunefs: maximum blocks per file in a cylinder group: (-e)  2048
tunefs: average file size: (-f)                            16384
tunefs: average number of files in a directory: (-s)       64
tunefs: minimum percentage of free space: (-m)             8%
tunefs: optimization preference: (-o)                      time

Can I safely ignore this?

I actually have a 2600 running, currently SuSE, but it did start with 
RedHat on it.  Everything was autodeteced by both RedHat and SuSE except 
the on-board sound, which was easily taken care of by installing the ALSA 
project drivers.  They are very, very nice laptops.  I love my book, and 
it is rarely more than 25 feet from me at any time.  802.11 is good. :)

  Perhaps doing something about Oregon statutes to discourage spam is not so
far off topic for this list as was suggested this morning.

In Alaska, where it gets very cold, pi is only 3.00.  As you know,
everything shrinks in the cold.  They call it Eskimo pi.

Don,

  I had a procmail recipe that did this. Very effectively, too. It sent all
notices of the Advanced PLUG group straight to /dev/null because many of
their headers contained the string "ADV".

Sigh,

If we really must rehash anti-spam techniques, can we please not quote
the message. Don, because your client did not include a valid
in-repy-to header, spam-assassin tagged your message (as well as the
original) as spam, which procmail dumps in a (gzipped[1]) mailbox that I
skim very infrequently.

I highly recommend spam-assassin, it significantly reduces my spam load
and its false positive rate is pretty infrequent (though I had to do a
little fine-tuning to the scoring). It can also be tied in to Vipul's
razor, which I have no experience using.

Making the list open to posting from subscribers-only is another way to
cut down on spam to the list -- mailman will hold mail from
non-subscribers for list-owner approval.

[1] The relevent procmail action is "| gzip >> spam.gz". Yes, mutiply
    appended gzipped archives result in a valid gzip file, and
    furthermore, mutt (with the compressed folders patch) will
    read/write a gzipped mailbox just fine, if a little more slowly.

Hmm, one of the things I have to do with spambouncer is have procmail 
filter out the mailing lists "prior" to spambouncer processing the mail. 
Otherwise, spambouncer will tag most the mailing list mail, and send it to 
a box I don't read often.

If I understand what you are saying here, all of your mail (including 
mailing lists) goes through spam-assassin. Does it catch spam that looks 
like a valid mailing list?

spamassassin is highly accurate.  Actual spam is filtered, everything else
passes.  It's not perfect, but very, very close.  I quit grinding my teeth
after I started using it.

That is correct.

> Does it catch spam that looks like a valid mailing list?

Nope, it catches messages to mailing lists that look like spam. :-)
Most messages to mailing lists don't look like spam to spam-assassin,
because it doesn't test whether the message is To: me directly, it tests
for many other things, mostly having to do with message content.

I believe it should, though at WireX we run it on our central mail
server, so it gets applied to my incoming email before it goes through
fetchmail.

Very few of spam-assassin's rules are header based, and shouldn't be
affected by fetchmail, but I can't rule out the possibility completely.
However, spam-assassin does let you tweak it's scoring mechanism, so
that if fetchmail does do certain things that trigger it you can reduce
the score on those items. spam-assassin works by looking for a variety
of things and assigning a score to each thing it finds. If the sum of
the score goes over a (user-)configurable threshhold, spam-assassin
marks the message as spam.

Message-ID: <51C603B9AB4696408D7273AA133734AC1EA755@ljcms002.prod.vectorscm.com>

I have been trying to solve a problem I have with the sound driver on my
Redhat 7.2 PC.  A search led me to this link:

http://starwave.smartdesk.net/www/MrGreg/sound.html

I have kernel source and headers installed from rpm from the OS install.  I
have updated the source code for the module from the link as it said on the
note.txt file.  The kernel I am using is the one that was installed by the
OS install and there is no .config file.  If I understand the documents
correctly, I can get the same .config as the kernel I have installed by
typing make oldconfig.  Is that correct?  If I then skip the kernel install
and run make modules and make modules_install, run depmod -a, then reboot, I
should be using the updated sound driver, correct?  Is there any chance that
I will screw up other modules needed and have an unstable or unbootable
system?

Not.  There should be a .config file available in the RPM, SRPM,
or /boot directory....somewhere.

"make oldconfig" takes a .config file as input, applies its answers
to the current kernel config options, and asks for input only on
undefined config options.

Low risk IMO.

Thank you.  That is the mail thing I was looking for.

There is a directory called config under /usr/src/linux-2.4 with a bunch of
config files by architecture.  I have a pentiun II 433 MHz.  Is that
considered i686?  Is there a place to check?

Yes.  It grabs a bunch of spam that comes through my mailing lists all the 
time.

It does get some false positives, as well as some misses, so you may want to 
filter it off into a holding area that can be looked at later.

Sounds like somebody could give up the unemployed SIG, they're looking for a
Linux dude, but it's way over my head.

You could grep for 'ip_masq' in the System.map file - I think this will
tell you what symbols are present in the kernel.  If you find any for
ip_masq, that would imply that masquerading is compiled in.

If the masquerading bits are compiled as modules, they will be in
/lib/modules/{kernel version}/ipv4, or someplace similar.

Subject: [PLUG] Stupid Galeon tricks
Message-ID: <20020408193912.M50005@loadzone.org>

Over the weekend I installed the new 7.3 RedHat beta (Skipjack) and everything
works great except for Galeon (which is my favorite browser...). It opens fine
and browses fine but if I try and get to the Preferences from the Settings
menu it bombs out with this error message:

GnomeUI-ERROR **: file gnome-icon-item.c: line 375 (get_default_font):
assertion failed: (default_font != NULL)
aborting...
Aborted

I swear I didn't delete any fonts so I'm not sure why Galeon thinks that its
default font is a null value. I tried deleting the .galeon folder from my home
directory hoping it would recreate all the default settings but that didn't
help. Does anybody have any ideas?

Unless someone is sitting in the field or down by the stream with a laptop 
on 802.11, there's no way anybody could be getting a signal from my access 
point, so I'm not concerned.  My closest neighbour is over 1000 yards

Message-ID: <3CB29718.3040204@physics.orst.edu>

I'm fairly new to Linux so bear with me here...

I've got an HP LaserJet 1100 hooked up to my linux box.  I used the KDE 
printer configuration tool to set it up, and it works great.

However, I am trying to figure out how to allow my co-worker to print to 
my printer (from his linux box) over our LAN.

I have created the file /etc/hosts.lpd and put nothing but a "+" into 
it.  My co-worker doesn't get permission errors anymore (when he tries 
to print to my printer).  In fact, when he prints something to my 
printer he gets no errors, everything seems to be fine, but nothing 
comes out of the printer.

For reference, I am using Red Hat version 7.1

Thanks very much!

Jeff

Hey, that worked like a charm...but it begs the question, why didn't samba 
create that file when I installed it?  I don't recall anything about that in 
the README or INSTALL.TXT, but of course that was over a year ago, and I have 
forgotten most of what I read yesterday :)

Well, I did it.  mp3's now play in real time instead of incredible slow,
however, they are still to have too static to listen to.  Maybe when RH 7.3
ships.....

I'm trying to track down a strange hardware error on my L440GX+ (Lancewood
with a single processor). It randomly locks with no messages in the log
files or console messages. I have verified the SCSI chain and swapped
memory. I am booting the SMP kernel. There is no way (in the BIOS at least)
to disable the CPU onboard cache or the L2 Cache. It is running RH7.2 all
up2date.

Has anyone had a similar problem, or does anyone know of a good hardware
test suite I can run?

It seems like some one talked about this, but I can not find it in the
archives ( 2002-April or 2002-March).  When I had kde 2.2 some
screens would lock up for a minute or two, but you could open another
screen an keep on working.  Now with kde 3.0 this seems to be fix
and the computer locks-up:((  No response from mouse or key board.
There is no set time. I have the lockup happen at logon  up to a hour
after logon.

OK, so go to the other computer and do a "lpc status".  It should tell you
if you can reach the print server from the other box.

Also, what does your /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny say?  Odds are,
you're blocking out the other mkachine with TCP wrappers.

This isn't an answer to your question, unfortunately.  But I'm curious
how you got KDE 3.0 and how you installed it.  I've only been running
Linux for 4 months and have never done an upgrade like this.

Don't discount the possibility that this is a hardware problem, especially an 
overheating processor.  Dust bunnies can kill!

You shouldn't have any problems playing mp3s on a 433MHz machine.
Perhaps there is an incorrect setting in your sound card, a loose
connection, or perhaps you've just got lousy mp3s.

I managed to get KDE 3.0 installed on a RH 7.1 box, but it was a tedious
process.  It was basically a game of
try-to-install/upgrade-a-KDE-RPM-but-can't-because-the-old-version-must-be-there-for-various-apps-so-forcibly-remove-the-old-version-with-the-nodeps-option-and-then-hunt-on-rpmfind.net-for-whichever-RPM-contains-the-particular-library-that-the-new-RPM-needs-then-create-symlinks-for-all-the-libraries-that-are-required-by-the-old-apps-pointing-to-the-new-libraries-and-discover-that-several-of-the-RPMS-cannot-be-installed-because-I-can't-find-the-required-dependencies-so-delete-the-RPM-and-hope-it-wasn't-that-important-then-bow-before-the-Great-Golden-Penguin-and-hope-that-it-grants-success-to-startx.
Repeat as desired.
Soooooo...  If you're relatively new to Linux, I would recommend that you
wait for the next version of <insert favorite distro here> that already
has KDE 3 ready to go.  But if you enjoy the sort of detective work
required to get KDE installed on a RH box, then by all means, head to
kde.org and get going (You might want to do this on a spare box, just in
case things don't go in your favor).

Can you ctrl-alt-backspace to kill the X session?  Can you ctrl-alt-F1 and
get to a console?  Can you ssh into your box?  I just hate to hear about
Linux systems being manually rebooted when the GUI has problems...

Perhaps.  I was able to play mp3's before I upgraded to 7.2.  I read that a
change in the kernel broke the sound driver for my sound card and the
process I went through was supposed to fix it.  Another option would be to
upgrade the kernel.  Perhaps I will try that.  I will get some other mp3's
to try out first.  Perhaps the one I was testing with is bad.  It did sound
better than before.  At least it wasn't in super slow mode.

Yeah, so do I.  I found out the hard way a few weeks ago that the
printer config applet in KDE 2.2 tickled a kernel bug that caused
a lock-up; upgrading to 2.2.2 upgraded the kernel bug to cause a
hard reboot.

Does it lock up only when running X, or just whenever? If only when
running X, have you tried swapping video cards?

Sometimes a memory swap doesn't rule out all memory-related issues
(e.g., dust in the DIMM slot). You might try memtest86:

  http://www.teresaudio.com/memtest86/

Power and heat issues are much tougher to track down, esp. if the
problem arises from motherboard circuitry...

but it still says the public key is invalid... I don't wanna waste too much time on setting up a windows client... any ideas?

Thanks.

I'll second Memtest86 - I'm running 2k at home as my main workstation, and was 
getting random lockups and errors, BSOD's when playing games or if I had lots 
of windows open.  I pulled memtest86 off the 'net and almost immediately after 
starting the test I was getting memory errors on my 3rd 256M DIMM.  I pulled 
it out, cleaned it and the memory slot off, swapped it with another dimm and 
started up memtest again.  No errors - it was just dirty.

I still get random errors and BSOD's on occasion, but I'll attribute that to 
win2k.  ;)

Thanks Bill.  I found what I needed from ya.  :)  I guess I just expressed myself backwards.  The option I was looking for was 
the -i option in ssh-keygen.

Nope. it's a dev box so 99% of the time it has a couple of people ssh'd in.
But it will also hang at night when no one is on.

After I sent this email I found that and ran one iteration. It passed. I'll
run several iterations tonight. Nice program!

It's in a fairly cold room, round 60, it also has 4 int fans 1 CPU fan and 2
P/S fans. So I've pretty much ruled that out. It's an older server that I
retired for a nice 1U (it's a 4U)

I also am having printer problems.  When I had kde 2.2 on RH 7.2
it was working, until I installed a new network card that linux likes.
This allow me to get on the cable modem (which is great) but
my printer stooped working at that time.  The error at bootup is:
lpd get_host_name  bad host name 'azfamily'
but if I type in hostname in the shell it gives me 'azfamily'??
Other then that I have not been working on the problem.  Thinking
of installing cups to see if that helps?

I had the same thing happening on a dev box at work a while back, too.  The box had a 128MB and a 256MB stick in it, and it 
turned out the 128MB was faulty.  Have you tried swapping RAM sticks with another system for a few days just to see?  Can't 
make the situation any worse, and might make it better.  Worth a shot, at least.

Pat.

Hey, could I ask a question about 2k?  I have a friend that just installed
2K and was asking if they could run games also.  Do games work OK on it?

Hi,

At home I have Win2K/NTFS on /dev/hda (or C:, for family use)
and Linux on /dev/hdb.
Currently I boot Linux from floppy (s.l.o.w).

Is there a decent solution for booting Linux on /dev/hdb
without using a floppy?  (gosh I hope so)

According to some dual boot web pages and HOWTOs, LILO
can't boot from an NTFS partition, but I tried it anyway,
and got "LIL-"....dead.

Thanks,

I've used the "change the BIOS boot order" trick.

Not as slow as boot floppy but certainly less automatic....

Message-ID: <8A9A5F4E6576D511B98F00508B68C20A1A1ABD@orsmsx106.jf.intel.com>

Hi,

I was wondering if anyone has any experience working with Linux on laptops.


I have an HP Pavilion n5135 that I installed RH7.2, SUSE 7.3, Mandrake
8.1/8.2 and always come across the same issue - the system locks up while
working in X-Windows.  I am not doing anything out of the ordinary with the
installs, just default install, ... using OS embedded S3 video drivers.
When I start the X-Window session, it will normally work for about 10
minutes and then all of a sudden the system will lock-up, at this point you
cannot even switch to a console, you have to reboot to recover.  At first I
thought that maybe it was the meager 64MB RAM I had installed, but after
upgrading to 256MB I still have the issue.  I also tried looking for
instructions on the Linux for Laptops site
(http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/hp.html), but the link for the HP n5135 was
broken :(

I started experimenting with Linux about 3 months back, wiping out my OEM
installed WinME laptop and installing Linux was an attempt at to completely
imerse myself in the OS so as to speed the learing process, however not
being able to work with the GUI is plain frustrating.

Any suggestions or help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Rushdan.

Will grub work?  It is a replacement for lilo that is more advanced.  I
haven't looked into whether it will work with NTFS, though.

I work for a cable assembly company (SCSI, ATA, USB, etc.) 

One of my company's prospective customers (an OEM) is looking into building a 
portable computer-enhanced gadget (something a bit bigger than a PDA.) They'd 
be looking for a contract software person to write code for a driver so that 
their computer is 'talking to' the right port - which is where our cable will 
attach. They're asking us primarily about MS, but I got them talking about 
including 'other' systems as well.

If it happens, this would be a neat opportunity to ensure that Linux drivers 
are supplied in tandem with M/Squish...

Please contact me off-list of you would like more info...

Message-ID: <20020409155914.49c873d5.jason@vancleve.com>

Hi,

I wish to put one or more file paths in a text file and then use those contents as command arguments using command substitution (Bash).  Specifically, I put a globbed list of MP3s in a file /mp3s/lists/steve-turre and then tried to play them with Xine:

me at mine:/mp3s > xine -pq -H `cat /mp3s/lists/steve-turre`

This does work, provided no escape characters are found in my file.  But in this case, the contents are:

Turre,\ Steve/*.mp3

There is a space in this path, so I escaped it.  The result is a rather redundant and not very accurate error message from Xine, "There is no available input plugin available to handle 'Turre,\'.".  So evidently, because of the command substitution, the escape characters aren't being interpreted, and Xine is told to play "...Turre,\" and "Steve/*.mp3" as separate files.  I don't think Xine is at fault; if I try it directly:

me at mine:/mp3s > xine -pq -H Turre,\ Steve/*.mp3

it works.  This seems peculiar, though I don't know the Bash command parsing order very well.  Is there a solution that fits my design?  (I know there are other ways to skin this cat, but this one seems most convenient for me.  Ideally, I'd like to use the format above for these quasi-playlist files, simply because that's what tab completion yields.)

Thanks again,

--Jaso.

Is it only when working in X, or can you get it to lock without X (creating a
load might be dificult though, try compiling something, like a kernel)?

Does the syslog reveal any clues?

One possible source is the PCMCIA stuff, does it lock if you remove all of your
cards?

Another wild idea is, that the framebuffers for console is enabled, do you get a
cute little penguin in the upper left hand corner during boot?  This has been
known to cause problems on other systems, and XFree86 doesn't need framebuffers.

Good Luck

LILO can boot NTFS ... only older versions can't.  Set up your LILO as you normally would, then add:

other=/dev/hda
	label=Win2K

to your lilo.conf, run lilo and reboot.

I have this setup on my workstation - Win2KPro on hda, RedHat 7.2 on hdb.  I use LILO and it works great.

I'm using win2k with redhat 7.2 (Call me BorgBoy!) and
GRUB and everything works superdeeduper.

Install win2k and SP2 BEFORE you install linux, cause
Bill's minions like to hose the bootloader as a matter

And Win2K is in an NTFS partition, not FAT-32?

Are you using 2 hard drives like I described in my

I did run it and found it slower than the 6.0 beta with fewer fonts, but 
I haven't played with it that much.  I'm still not sure.

Mark,

  Thanks for the insight. I intend to use it only to read winWord docs sent
to me and to work with templates created in winWord. It (and StarOffice) are
far too slow and clunky for my production writing. I use emacs or joe for
that and then put the final touches on in LyX or WordPerfect (depending on
the purpose).

This is more wild-assed speculation, but FWIW. 

I got GRUB working on a dual boot W2k/Debian laptop.  My W2k is on a
FAT32 partition, but I have the impression that it wouldn't matter if
it was an NTFS because GRUB doesn't just chainloads the MS operating
systems anyway.  It doesn't seem to be trying to grok the filesystem
for anything but ext2 and friends where it can find a kernel to boot.

My w2k is on /dev/hda1 (hd0,0 in grubspeak) and debian is on /dev/hda3
(hd0,2).

To play with GRUB, load it on a floppy and run commands from the GRUB
command line to boot the various possibilities before you commit to
blotting out the MBR.

Damn, that kona koffee mochi is giving me the whirly-birds.  That
should read:

  ``because GRUB just chainloads ...''

Here's my /boot/grub/menu.lst:

   default saved
   timeout 10

   title   Windows 2000 Professional
   root    (hd0,0)
   chainloader +1
   savedefault

   title   Linux (current)
   root    (hd0,2)
   kernel  /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/hda3 vga=835
   savedefault

   title   Linux (old)
   kernel  /boot/vmlinuz.old root=/dev/hda3 vga=835
   savedefault

Notably, I _didn't_ get GRUB working on a Abit VP6 motherboard.
Something to do with the bios misreporting disk geometry.

Thanks for all the info (and to Doug R. and Patrick L.).
I'll try to get around to trying it one of these days.

For now, it was easier for me to munge bits of
linux/arch/i386/boot/bootsect.S to bootflop.S,
put 'bootflop' on /dev/fd0 (1 sector, the boot sector),
and have it read in the MBR from /dev/hdb and jump to it
to execute it.  Gives me a comfortable LILO menu, quickly.  :)

This is now working and isn't slow like booting from a
floppy is.  And it could be useful in a recovery situation
if someone is willing to write their boot sector on
their second hard drive also (IDE = /dev/hdb only for now,
but probably could be modified to support more than this).

Oh, and I don't have to struggle thru mkbootdisk over and
over again.

So does anyone else see this as possibly useful, or is it
just me?

Thanks,

that was setting  SAL_DO_NOT_USE_INVERT50=true in my .bashrc file. You
might try that. Also make sure that you are using the "savage" driver in
your /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 file. Your device Section should look
something like this.

Section "Device"
        # no known options
        Identifier   "S3 Savage (generic)"
        Driver       "savage"
        VendorName   "S3 Savage (generic)"
        BoardName    "S3 Savage (generic)"

        #BusID
EndSection

The only problem that I've had with X killing the system was with a Matrox
Mellinium that didn't recognize the right amount of video memory, usually right
after I started to put it on a high graphics load (running a couple of windows
and mozilla should do nicely) that took about 10 minutes after X started up.
If you're using X v4.x, have a look-see at /var/log/X* and go to the point
where the server says how much memory it found.  If it's not getting the right
stuff, then you have to explicitly state it in the /etc/XFree86.conf.

For the record, do you have an entry for azfamily in /etc/hosts?  Just because
$HOSTNAME is in the environment, it doesn't mean that the name can be resolved to
an IP address.

Please do not accept word documents if they are emailed to you!

It is possible to work around this inconvenience, but you would do the
free software community, Mac Users, WordPerfect Users and everyone
non-Microsft a big favor by rejecting them! For example, see what Stallman
writes at:

http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html

Personally I send out the message below. I used to worry about whether
this was impolite or not, but then I realized it was far more impolite
to let people continue sending word attachments without being aware of the
issues. Yes, I've sent this to my boss, and my boss's boss, professors,
even prospective employers. I've almost always gotten a positive response.
This is a serious issue: if you can, please pitch in and reject word
attachments.


--------
You sent the attachment in Microsoft Word format, a secret proprietary
format, so I cannot read it. If you send me the document in plain
text, HTML, or PDF, then I can read it.

Sending people documents in Word format has unintended effects,
placing pressure on them to use Microsoft software. This is a major
obstacle to the broader adoption of free software. Would you please
reconsider the use of Word format for communication with other people?

Converting the file to HTML is simple. Open the document, click on
"File", then "Save As", and in the "Save As Type" box choose "HTML
Document".  Then choose "Save". You may then attach the new HTML
document instead of a Word document.

Thanks!

Is PDF an open standard?  I tend to think of Adobe as evil when it comes
to free software.

PDF is published, if not open.

Adobe is only slightly more evil than any other proprietary software
vendor because of their support for "copy control" technologies.

They've been pretty hit and miss with their policies.

How is sending you a word document more indicative of information you
really want than any other kind of email message?

It's not a refusal to play nice with others, it's a recognition of the
fact that Microsoft refuses to play nice with others.

And, as members of the tecnical elite or the Free Software community, we
are probably better informed about the nature of the systems used by the
majority and, more importantly, more aware of the alternatives.  We have a
responsibility to share that knowledge and help people to see the damage
they are doing to themselves and others by perpetuating proprietary
document formats.

Good development time that could be spent developing BETTER infrastructure
is wasted trying to reverse-engineer secrets nobody really needs to learn.

We avoid the whole mess by just using open document formats.

> But then, how many windows-based tools for (La)TeX do you see?

Plenty in the publishing world, where TeX belongs.

There's a difference between something that is hard to implement because
it is necessarily complex and something that is hard to implement because
it was obfuscated at design-time.

Also note that TeX is a kind of markup language that is stored in
plaintext files, easily accessed by any computer system in the world.

> In a perfect world, we'd all be using CSS and XML for everything. ;)

No, in a perfect world, we would have an appropriate data format for each
task, but that format would be published and open.

Keeping the discussion on the topic of email, and attachments, rarely to people 
randomly attach documents of any format and send them to me unless I've 
specifically asked for 'em.  Ie, 'Can I see your resume?' or some equal task in 
function.

Maybe it's because I'm not a purist and I don't believe that there's one 
solution to everything.  But as reality stands right now, there's certain 
accepted standards for certain things.  In the world of business, realisticly, 
if the word processing application you're using can't or won't work with the MS 
Word format, you're cut off.   Sure, I would love to see everyone using a 
decent, open standard (RTF springs to mind) and when in a position to, I'll 
certainly take a moment out of my day to educate a user on why splarnking word 
documents about isn't the most productive process in the world.  

Shortly thereafter, they will look at me a little funny and say, 'So I click on 
the *paperclip* to send an attachment?' and a small part of me will weep for 
humanity as I nod.

Agreed.  Except when I really want to read a MS Word 2150 (scheduled for 
release next week) document that some random-but-important person sent me while 
in X.

On a side-side note, I was looking for something similar to xdvi for win32 
several months ago.  All I found was some app I couldn't remember the name of 
that worked for win311 and 95 OSR1.  It'd still be nice to have, if anyone's 
got a URL or seven. ;)

Really?  I thought you said it was CSS and XML.

But seriously, I don't see what you're saying there.  We're not talking
about "one solution to everything", we're talking about keeping our
documents in an open format so that they will be accessible by the
broadest spectrum of people... including those that come a century after
us.

That's absolutely not true.  In fact, we can make it exactly the opposite
by returning proprietary documents and requesting them in an open
format.  In that way, those who cannot communicate in a free way are cut
off from communication.  They can listen, but they cannot speak.  They are
forced into passivity.

You're always in a position to do that.

Yeah, ok... you're so much better than the unwashed masses.  They are all
sheep who cannot learn and it is you were handed the divine crook to
shepard these people as best you can.

Well, that's the really important issue.  Do you WANT to read the MS Word
2150 document or do you want to read the information expressed in the MS
Word 2150 document?  They are separable.  So send the crap back and get
only what you want.

It's like using stevia instead of sugar.  I want the sweet, but not the
tooth decay.  Or better yet, like sitting in the non-smoking section of a
restaurant.  I want the food, but not the cancer.

There are enough of us to make them stop.  Hell, we've done a pretty darn
good job of stopping HTML mail.  Sure, it gets through, but compared to
the number of clients designed to produce the stuff, we hardly see any
outside of spam.

Is it possible to change the default document format in Word?

Perhaps someone should write a macro virus that does that.

I am not sure anyone has really addressed your exact question, so here
is my shot.

I just installed Win98 on my machine, but want it to dual boot.  Here
are my two options as I see it.

1) Move the drive that is now /dev/hda to /dev/hbb and install linux on
a newly installed drive at hda with lilo offering access to either
system

This has worked for me in the past.

2) Change my bios to boot from the primary slawe and install linux there
with lilo pointing to both systems.

I am not positive this second way would work, but it might.

Hope that helps.

Why would you bother with all that?

Just install Windows on the primary master (if you must), then install
your GNU/Linux system on the primary slave.  Then, when it comes time to
run Lilo, you modify your lilo.conf to note the Windows drive on the
primary master and go.

You shouldn't have to move drives OR change the bios.

Well, it is getting to the point that I am about to leave the list.  I
give this one plea and make my decision on the reaction I get.

This list is getting to be more like SPAM every day.  Some peeves:

1) Why post if you don't have the answer or direct related experience

More and more, people are posting with responses that have little to do
with the specifics of the post.  Please people, read the original post
and if it is a technical question and you have knowledge exactly about
what the poster is requesting, then go for it.  If not, don't post just
to say, "well, I don't know" or "I don't know about that, but I did this
once."  Keep on topic.

2) After two or three people have responded, there is no reason to
respond, "me too".  

Too often I see threads that are 10-12 posts long with nothing more than
a vote of confidence.  

3) Get that god damn chip off your shoulder.

Yes, windows sucks.  We all agree.  Not can we talk about something
else.  This should be a list for people who need help, can offer help,
or want to talk about technical details.  Does there need to be all this
crap about how we should be rejecting windows.  Fine we all agree.  Move
on with your life.

My rant is done.  Let the flames begin.....

Was this related to my response to your post a moment ago?

I read your recommendations and they seemed very odd because I've
installed a GNU/Linux system on a primary slave with another OS on the
primary master many times without having to move drives or change the
BIOS.  I was always able to use LILO as a bootloader installed in the MBR
of the primary master in that situation.

Well, why don't you just list nanny and we'll send everything to you for
approval before we discuss things in this open forum.

Well, I disagree with your assessment of the purpose of this list.

And while I'll agree that threads about bad Windows experiences or poor
performance or whatever are tedious and decidedly off-topic, I think that
the recent discussion on proprietary document formats is far beyond a
"Windows sucks"-type of argument.  For many of us, the fight against
proprietary software isn't merely a fight against crappy applications and
operating systems, but a fundamental clash of ideologies that mean the
difference between a free world and tyranny.

I think discussions about how to evangelize and promote Free Software and
the ideas it carries are certainly germaine to this list.

How did you then recover your Win2K boot sector?

One option is install LILO in the boot record of the partition that holds
/boot rather than in the MBR of the primary disk, then use dd to write the
boot record of that partition to a file.  You can move that file to your
Win2K partition and point the Win2K Boot Loader at that file.

The drawback is that you'll have to repeat that process every time you
upgrade your kernel.

I use OpenOffice-641 frequently.  It is quite handy when I receive Msword
documents as attachments.  There are times when I must produce documents
with a more polished look than a text editor will provide.  OpenOffice has
been perfect.

And yes, it does take a bit of time to load, but the result is worth it.

I have use abiword, gnomepad, and kword.  OpenOffice seems more stable
than kword (crashed alot).

My preference is still pico, but OpenOffice is great when I need it.

Happy hunting.

xpdf has existed for a long time, as has "convert FOO.pdf BAR.tiff".
The format is open and documented, but you have to have most of a
Postscript(tm) Renderer to do any useful examination.

The problem is, it's not like we haven't heard it 
before. The open office question was valid.  I don't 
like getting Word docs, but I don't ram my choice down 
other people's throat.

By not answering the question, but by deflecting it 
with "You should be doing this" you can bury a real 
answer.

1) Actually, your response to my post made sense, but I think this
should be discussed in that thread.

2) Jeme said, "Well, why don't you just list nanny and we'll send
everything to you for approval before we discuss things in this open
forum."

Jeme, your snide comment really illustrated my first point, which was --
if you remember -- about answering concerns and questions directly. 
Your comment simply does not do that.  Thanking for such a timely
response.

3) Regarding my concern for getting away from "windows" bashing, you
responded with, "the fight against proprietary software isn't merely a
fight against crappy applications and operating systems, but a
fundamental clash of ideologies that mean the difference between a free
world and tyranny."  Wow, might big task for such a small list.  Fair
enough though, perhaps this wasn't not clear to me.  When I joined the
list over a year ago I found it to be an excellent source of help when I
had issues with my operating system or software related to my operating
system.  I did not realize that I had enlisted in a noble fight to the
death against world tyranny.  My mistake.  Perhaps, I should find
another list where linux is fun and world tyranny is something we found
against in WWII.

You tell me.

Please do not accept word documents if they are emailed to you!

It is possible to work around this inconvenience, but you would do the
free software community, Mac Users, WordPerfect Users and everyone
non-Microsft a big favor by rejecting them! For example, see what Stallman
writes at:

http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html

Personally I send out the message below. I used to worry about whether
this was impolite or not, but then I realized it was far more impolite
to let people continue sending word attachments without being aware of the
issues. Yes, I've sent this to my boss, and my boss's boss, professors,
even prospective employers. I've almost always gotten a positive response.
This is a serious issue: if you can, please pitch in and reject word
attachments.


--------
You sent the attachment in Microsoft Word format, a secret proprietary
format, so I cannot read it. If you send me the document in plain
text, HTML, or PDF, then I can read it.

Sending people documents in Word format has unintended effects,
placing pressure on them to use Microsoft software. This is a major
obstacle to the broader adoption of free software. Would you please
reconsider the use of Word format for communication with other people?

Converting the file to HTML is simple. Open the document, click on
"File", then "Save As", and in the "Save As Type" box choose "HTML
Document".  Then choose "Save". You may then attach the new HTML
document instead of a Word document.

Thanks!

I got kde 3.0 up and looks like it is working correctly.  I got tired of the

error messages and issued to following command:

rpm -Uivh kde* --force --nodeps

Then I started kde and everything worked.  I played on it for about
2 hours and it did not lockup once.  yaaa

As my dad says 'Some times the sledgehammer is the correct tool.'

Start at:

Pick the distribution you are on.
I have rh 7.2 and this is where I started down loading:
    ftp://download.us.kde.org/pub/kde/stable/3.0/Red%20Hat/i386

Note: You do not need to down load all the files!   There are readmes at
www.kde.org
that can help you.  If you wish I can give you a list of the files that I
down loaded.
Not sure if they are the correct ones.

Yes, I have.  I'm not sure it's worth upgrading from StarOffice 5.2
(although now that I've converted some important files to the new
*.sxc format, I'm committed to the new version).

I've had some trouble with the Postscript generated by StarCalc.
It's generated the same error message on both the Lexmark Optra
here (a PostScript(r)) printer), and my home system, which uses
RedHat 7.1 to convert PS -> PCL.

I also tried the drawing application a while (1-2 weeks) ago, and
found that it could create only squares, and not rectangles!  (I 
can't compare this experience with SOffice 5.2 ... never tried the
drawing app there).

Ummm, just curious, Rich, what do you do for a spreadsheet?

I have it installed at work on a win2k box.  It seems to work fine except
for one thing.  We have files that are password protected in Excel so that
only people who know the pass word can modify them.  Open Office will not
open these files.  I would guess that the programmers can't figure out how
to encript the pass word to compare with the pass word in the file.

  Thanks, Don. I want only processed words from it, and from documents sent
to me in winWord format (or when I have to send a client or regulator a
digital copy of what I've written). For spreading sheets I use XessSE (which
reads .xls just fine).

  Among the GIMP, XessSE, Gri and MagicPoint I have all the drawing and
presentation tools I need.

  What's strange about printing from SO-5.2 here is that it does not have a
printer definition for the HP LaserJet 5 and does not recognize the duplexer
under it. So I use a HP 4MX (PostScript) definition and let CUPS handle the
double-sided printing. Works well for me.

  I use XessSE from Applied Information Systems in North Carolina. I bought
a copy (upgrading from XessLite) in a local store for $69, then bought
another license from them (directly) to use on a second workstation here.

  They are a highly responsive vendor. I've found quite a few bugs and
inconsistencies that I've reported to their tech support. They're usually
fixed within a few days to a week and they tell me where to download the
patched exectuable via ftp. A small company (3-6 employees) and I like doing
business with them; have for about four years now.

  Check out <http://www.ais.com/welcome.html> to see what they offer. I've
done some sophisticated business graphics using their product and have found
it a very productive tool that does all I need and more.

I had a triple boot, win98 (fat32), win2k (NTFS) and debian
(ext2), where one disk was for M$ (hda) and one was for
linux (hdc).  I started with win98, then did win2k, this set
up a dual boot using the win2k bootloader.  After installing
debian, _lilo_ let me choose between the win bootloader and
linux.  I will have to admit that I couldn't convince lilo
to let me choose between the three, but I think that is
because win2k actually put its bootloader on the win98
partition (so when I reinstall 98, win2k won't load).

I have another system with SUSE and win2k (NTFS) on the same
disk, and lilo has _no_ problem with that arrangement.
Again, I started with the M$ stuff and installed  linux
after.

Seems like lilo should be able to handle the two different
disks.

Make a linux boot floppy, M$ will hose the MBR whenever it
feels like it (most likely during a security patch).

Good Luck

Subject: [PLUG] Waiting for fuller WORD compatibility... / 98lite info
Message-ID: <20020410164914.9AB4B34671@ados.com>

Re: MS Word compatibility...

Right now I'm using MS Word running in 98Lite within VMWare (on Mandrake 8.2)
I used to use StarOffice 5.2, but my boss and colleages use .doc forms based 
on Word templates which include company logos, header, footer, and checkboxes.

1) MS within VMWare runs Office stuff the same as PCs running WIn+Office. 
Were this not the case, my boss would have forced me to blow Linux away and 
join the Evil Empire. Other folks at work still want me to do that . . .

2) When I use S/O 5.2, things look almost the same as in Windoze/Word. But 
not exactly. When I print (CUPS) from S/O it's WYSIWYG, which means OK but 
still a bit 'off' compared to Win printing the original Word doc.

3) When I create or modify a .doc file in S/O 5.2 and e-mail it, the guys on 
the other end say things look very hosed up, what's wrong with you & that 
Linux crap, etc. I finally believed them when I saved a .doc in S/O 5.2, 
fired up Word inside VMWare, and opened it myself. Yep - template formatting 
all messed up, weird color palette in PowerPoint to boot.

4) Installed S/O 6.0 Beta on another Mandrake 8.2 machine. Looks neat, looks 
like it has lots of publishing features, etc. But it crashes instantly when I 
try to open an 'original' .doc file.

5) AbiWord was similarly incapable at opening Word docs last time I checked. 
KWord was hopeless. (Any news on KDE 3.0?)

So, all in all, VMWare running MS stuff is the only way I've found to get my 
job done in Linux. I am wondering about CrossoverOffice, and before I shell 
out the $80 or whatever, I'm going to try to find out whether it will handle 
all the fringy bells-n-whistles stuff that MS packs into their documents - 
like right colors, and these check boxes and frames & thingies . . .

GLL

PS: I -have- had a great time discovering 98Lite on www.98lite.net  (-.com is 
a trashy site.) This thing, plus the IEradicator freeware, uncouples IE from 
the rest of the OS (even though MS told the DoJ that couldn't be done.)
If you have to run Win somewhere in your network or at sometime on your job 
or at home, I've had good luck with it so far (and from a novice user that's 
saying a lot about straighforward installs, transparent ease of use, 
stability, ease of understanding dialog, errors, etc.) It also allows you to 
ERASE unused programs and features - for me that meant bye^2 to IE, Access, 
Outlook, Net-whatever-that-was, all in all about 80MB of junk. Then it runs 3 
- 4 times faster than Win98 - whee!

So far, all the excel files I've opened have worked, but none of them
were very complicated.  However like many people, if I am going to
author a m$ format doc, I have to use the real thing.

Liking and disliking is just editorial comment.

What makes the difference here is to achieve a level of compatibility where
the originating software is transparent.  Do you care what tool created the
web page?  Doesn't much matter.  Only that you can read it.  Microsoft's
franchise rests on compatibility - which is both a strength and a weakness.

Unlike the AMD vs. Intel battle, these are compatibility issues that we can
do something about.

Rejecting MS Word documents on principle feels like plain old fanaticism.
 RMS may be brilliant, but I think he's dead-ass wrong on this issue.

Some standards are defined by engineers, others are de facto standards defined
by widespread usage.  MS Word is one of the latter.

Word's format is not a secret, in fact it is quite well documented (http://www.myfileformats.com/search.php?name=DOC).
 Nor is it only supported by one program from one vendor... many products
support it.

Sure, it's rude for people to assume that .DOC is the lingua franca of e-mail
attachments... but is having an editor that can read this format really
any different or more inconvenient than supporting SMB networking or having
the ability to mount FAT32/NTFS volumes?

Linux may well take over the world, but it won't do so by refusing to play
nice with others.

A tangential question here.

How well does OpenOffice import & export WinWord documents? The reason I ask
is that in my last job where I had to use Word extenisvely, I was surprised
at just how brittle MSWord documents were: at a certain size, the file would
start losing its formatting -- which was also eaisly lost if one merged two
or more MSWord documents.

It would be a nice solution for those of us forced[*] to use MSWord, if we
could export MSWord files into a stable format -- such as TeX or LaTeX --
polish up the document, then import it into MSWord for the PHBs who insisted
on MSWord documents.


[*] I'm not interested in hearing any arguments on the merits of complying or
refusing to comply with obviously braindead instructions from the folks who
sign our paychecks. If a PHB wants the report in MSWord, fine he'll get
MSWord. But I'm betting that after a while when people wonder why I can
produce these MSWord reports quicker & more expertly using this ideologically
tainted work-around, it will serve to convert them from the darkness of
using MS solutions for everything to actually evaluating the best solution
for each individual problem.

Stevia is an annual herb, about 24 - 30" tall, not from which artificial 
sweeteners are made. Its leaves, when chewed, taste much sweeter than even 
cane sugar.

So it can be used as an earthy-crunch alternative sweetener to sugar or to 
artificial, non-nutritive sweeteners.

  As I put the finishing touches on a permit application in SO-5.2 I am
again reminded why I so dislike GUI word processors: the stupid software
(better yet, the coders) think that they're smarter than I am. I'm entering
site location in lat/lon, and SO insists on using an inverted, open
apostrophy for the minutes symbol (') instead of a simple, closing
apostrophe. It uses no context checking, but it insists on doing things its
way. 99% of the time, that's *not* what I want, need or intend. But, I
cannot change it.

  There are many components to productivity. I've yet to find any in Windows
products. But, that may be because I don't work in them all day, every day.

Hello Linux folkz,
The main ussue is not in Linux whether it can play nice with others or
not.
The issue is in .DOC .XLS .PPT .MDB .LDB and other M$ formats.
Almost every new issue of M$ Office doesn't play well with its own
files created with older versions of itself and other way around.
Especially, if these files were created with a lot macros and links.
This problem became a nightmare for our facility and department.
Almost all engineering data and analysis created ten and more years
back and saved in earlier versions of Excell, Power Point, Access and
some Word documents became inaccessible for M$ Office XP and 97.
Literally speaking our management started to pull hair on their asses.
Hey, they even proposed to set up a few good old DOS boxes to read
files created with Word/Excel 3.11. Brilliant idea! Which is
failed,because DOS can't cope anymore with modern BIOSes and P4
hardware.
In my opinion all these M$ Office formats should be abandoned not only
because they are created by our main foe M$ but because they are not
mantaining persistancy of itself from version to version.
We need document and data formats which have live span close to
infinity.
Alex

I did a quick search and found a Word to LaTeX converter at
http://wvware.sourceforge.net/
as a script called wvLatex. This might fit your needs. 
Has anyone used this. Does it do a decent job?

dd (had it backed up).

Yes, I've tried that also, but it failed too.
Some web pages that I've read say that this works with FAT partitions

Maybe I just need a newer LILO.  I'll check on that or on grub.

Yeah, not satisfactory for me.

I hate to string along an OT flamewar (or the beginnings of one)...but recent 
developments and this discussion got me thinking....

( I apologize in advance for the verbose posting.... )

As most of us may have noticed, when one applies for a job via electronic 
means, the resume recipient usually requires a M$ Word document....

It strikes me as a little odd when a *NIX person has to use a non-native 
environment to convey data that pertains to a ''possibly'' non-M$ related 
job....

To this end, I propose RML -- Resume Markup Language.

All I'm presuming is __simple__ XML, no extensive tag attributes, simply a 
small set of resume-centric tags that data can easily be parsed from....

The idea is that anyone using vi, or a word-processing utility can create 
this document, and it can easily be parsed by a simple script, expat, or even 
M$ IE.....

I feel this would also enable HR/Staffing departments in that the data is 
already in a parseable form and could easily be put into whatever systems 
they are using, rather than the cut-copy-paste systems many HR departments 
use presently....

If a true DTD is decided upon and agreed on as *standard* I think this could 
make life a lot easier for both the employer and job hunter.....

any comments?

for example:
(those of you who use HTML-rendering mail clients, may need to "view-source"

I work in an M$ shop, and I've never had trouble with formatting on Word 
conversions with StarOffice. We even use some pretty sophisticated macros 
for document templates (law practice), and still no conversion problems.

Neat idea, but why bother? My "main" copy of my resume is in HTML, and I 
convert from that for a number of formats available for download from my 
site. M$ Word? I don't care. I run the conversion via StarOffice. BFD.

And a Unix job that requires Word-formatted resume? I'd have to consider 
whether I'd want to work for them, anyway.

valid point, One main reason to do this would really be to help HR/Staffing 
departments with their data management....i.e. the document could easily be 
dumped into a database without the overhead of having to parse out formatiing 
information, or as I mentioned earlier, the cut-copy-paste stuff....

google for "resume dtd" reveals

        http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/resume-DTD.txt

in the third hit.  No point in reinventing the wheel if OASIS
is already promoting one.  Other DTDs of interest are at

        http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/hrmml.html

and

        http://xmlresume.sourceforge.net/

That last one looks particularly interesting.

My experience with this was that straight-forward documents converted
between Word and Star Office fairly seamlessly.  But if the document
had embedded tables, spreadsheets, or images, much re-formatting was
required.

Tracking revisions and working on collaborative projects are pretty
much problematic too.

Subject: [PLUG] Hostname
Message-ID: <20020410210952.90542.qmail@web9604.mail.yahoo.com>

What appeared to be a printing problem with Red Hat
("Skipjack") seems to involve hostname assignment.
Anyhow, my hostname is apparently "dhcppc2," although
I didn't order it. Thus,

root at dhcppc2 root>

I use a DSL router, which supplies IP addresses by
DHCP--perhaps that's why this name was assigned.If you
check "DHCP" during installation of Red Hat, all other
options are grayed out, unlike some other
distributions which still allow you to assign a
hostname of your choice.

Elsewhere, however, (/etc/hosts,
/etc/sysconfig/network) the system is still known as
localhost.localdomain.

How's Samba? I was getting around to that. It almost
makes it

Sharename        Type       Comment
---------        ----       --------
IPC$             IPC        IPC Service (Samba server)
ADMIN$           Disk       IPC Service (Samba server)
Canon            Printer    lp

Server           Comment
------           -------
DHCPPC2          Samba server

Workgroup        Master
---------        ------
MSHOME

On the Windows computer's Network Places, "dhcppc2" is
there. However, when I click on it, there's a warning
that it is not accessible. 

It's hard to imagine a name uglier than "dhcppc2," but
I am willing to go with it if it would solve the
problem (for example, by changing the hostname in
/etc/sysconfig/network). But I thought I'd ask for
advice before doing such dramatic things.

Subject: [PLUG] Red Hat 7.1 hijacked my printer...
Message-ID: <3CB4D647.C1AC6C13@pcez.com>

I was simply trying to print a 42-page document from a downloaded
PDF file, 7 pages at a time (my HP Deskjet 600C needs to be
spoon-fed larger jobs).   For some reason, I was unable to print
beyond page 13 of that document.  When I selected pages 14 - 21
in the Print Range from the print menu of Acrobat Reader, my
printer would spit out pages 1 through 7 again. I went to page 21
and tried to print just page 21, but pages 1 - 6 came out again.

I killed all print jobs  ($ lprm - ) and unplugged my printer for
a few minutes, hoping to reset everything.  But now all my
printer will do is run pages through itself, nonstop, printing
strange characters (harts, solid arrows, greek symbols,
house-like figures, numbers, circles with odd shapes inside,
etc.)  along the top edge of each sheet as they pass through
until the tray is empty.

Hoping to regain control of the situation, I turned the printer
off and unplugged it, for 30 minutes, and rebooted my RH box.
When I brought everything back online, the printer still will
only feed pages through in an uncontrollable fashion, printing
those bizzare characters.   $ lpq says there are no print jobs.
Is there some magical reset switch inside the printer somewhere,
or is it time to buy a real printer?

After several visits from my good and patient Linux-wizard friend, my 'final 
solution,' given the value of my time (as wasted in fixing and re-fixing and 
rebooting and trying again and restoring and re-checking) was to spend $67 on 
a new printer. Go to your list of supported printer drivers and use that as a 
shopping criterion. (Let the clerk know that Linux is part of your selection 
process.)

Then watch 'Office Space' for a feel-good suggestion on how to dispose of 
your disobedient printer. If you have a maul, an anvil, and/or a friend with 
Class III toys, things can get downright therapeutic.

No it's time to rant about printing under linux.

You have a spool file somewhere.  And everytime lpd runs it sees that
spool file and starts printing.  Since it's printing from the middle
of the job, you get garbage.  The fact that lpq says it's not there is
meaningless.  I have seen the same thing, i.e. jobs which continued to
print after lpq says they don't exist.  In the worst case I have to
kill lpd AND unload the printer module to get things back to normal.

The question is how to figure out where lpd is getting the file from.

You might try lsof.

I would set up the printer so that it runs out of paper after the
first sheet.  Then use lsof or similar to figure out what file is
being printed.  Get rid of that file and you should be OK.

I guess it is possible that it's your printer.  In that case get out
your manual, leave the printer disconnected from computer, and use the
"self-test" sequence to make sure the printer is doing something
reasonable.

I have this printer, too, and while I don't use it very often, it hasn't 
barfed the way yours did.  It's connected to a RH 7.0 box.

Try using xpdf instead of Acrobat.  I always forget to load the paraport_pc 
module, but I believe the printer does nothing in that case.

Check /var/spool/lpd/lp/status.lp for any clues.  (Substitute your printer 
name for `lp` if different.)


This is my /etc/printcap
##PRINTTOOL3## LOCAL cdj550 300x300 letter {} DeskJet550 3 1

         :sd=/var/spool/lpd/lp:\

I meant to suggest this.  In /etc/printcap for the stanza for your printer,
`sd`= spool dir.  Go there and rm old jobs (they have long alpha-numeric 
names.)

And, as always, check for updates from RH.  Probably under the printconf 
packages.  You may want to run `printconf` again.

I use OpenOffice when I need to handle co-worker documents.

At home, 641A-C wouldn't run on my Debian unstable workstation.  641D
seems to work, but I had to run 638C before 641D came out.  Don't run
641B, it was nasty even on my work RH7.2 box.

What puzzles me is I reported a bug, they said it was fixed in their
development version (this was before 641D came out) and closed the bug.
641D came out which they say will be 1.0 if they don't find any big
issues, and the bug is still present. Humpf.  Maybe 642.

We have NFS+am-utils and all the users homedirs are under /h/users/<x>.
Some of them are symlinks to their personal workstation.  When you open
a document in OpenOffice, even if you have your working directory as
your homedir, it dereferences everything in it's way.. meaning it tries
to dereference all those users symlinks to other machines.

So you sit and wait for amd to go out and automount everyones remote
homedir.  With some of them over T1's, it takes ~1-2 minutes just to get
an open dialog box.  Sort of a big issue.. wonder why they didn't fix it
in 641D. :(

If you go long enough (say 5 minutes), amd times out the unused mounts,
and you get to wait again if you open another document. :((

Hmm. Your search skills are better than mine. About 6 months ago
I looked at rtf2latex (which I found on Freshmeat), which converts
from RTF to LaTeX.

Now that we have half of the solution, I wonder if anyone has
bothered to hack out a LaTeX2Word converter. (Or would anyone
that knowledgeable be too afraid of annoying the Boycott MS crowd?)

I think LaTeX to pdf is a better solution if you must pass
around some print ready file. PDF should be more virus
free than word docs and there are good pdf viewers for
most platforms.  But please just use ghostscript to 
do the conversion to pdf and  don't send any money to 
Adobe. They are still on my boycott list.

Also, have you tried it with the printer cable disconnected, so that you're
only checking to see if the printer is as we say in the computer business,
fritzed?

There once was a luser named fred,
who one day used grep, awk, and sed.
He parsed a huge text stream,
used regexps to the extreme,
and now his file's tail is its head.

his leads soon grew thin
the result of his sin

Who noticed that Microsoft sucks.
So his OS is free.
And will continue to be

He wrote all his code in vim
And try as he might
Him did emacs users smite

At one time Hotmail was free
Could be accessed without any fee.
Then Bill Gates came along
No profits? That's gone
Now it deletes my e-mail with glee.

I thought it was fast
And I had such a blast
But looking back, it was as useless as bisque.

I'm sure some of you've noticed that most of my mail's 'From' come across 
as 'To: blah at blah.com'.  I thought, previously, this was because of a brain-
dead client I was far, far too lazy to fix. ;)

Turns out, at least, now that I've started to use multiple clients and get the 
same behaviour, that it's probably not that.   The next culprit would be either 
hobgoblins or postfix.  

I've glanced at the postfix config, but I'll admit to not knowing really, what 
it does -- sort of like sendmail.cf, I consider it magic.  Any pointers to 
fixing this?

Dave,

  I *think* I know to what you refer; if I'm wrong I'm sure you'll tell me.

  When I look at the list of messages in a mail box here (and I use pine as
my MUA), every message that I've posted to the list (PLUG or other) shows
the list address in the "From" column. It does not show my name. That's
perfectly normal.

  I anguished over this a few years ago until I learned that it was as
intended. I find that it makes it much easier for me to find my own postings
in a mail box index. :-)

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0204111032140.21643-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  It occurred to me that with only two users here there's no reason not to
use sendmail (already installed and working fine for outbound mail) rather
than postfix. From what I've read, as long as I have the latest version and
I have "hardened" it (following ideas in, for example, last month's Linux
Journal) it will work just fine for our little network.

  Given this, I tried to find which version I have installed, but haven't
figured out how to tell. Typing 'sendmail -v' does nothing. Locating
sendmail, I find /usr/sbin/sendmail with a date of Sept. 5, 2001. I suppose
that's rather outdated now, but I've no idea what version it is.

  Other than opening port 25 on my floppyfw and asking my ISP to create a
new, higher priority MX record pointing directly to my domain, what do I
need to do?

  Is there a particular mail list I should monitor for security notices
germane to sendmail?

  Well, that's my two alloted questions. Thanks for the help -- as always.

I like the idea!  Trouble is I haven't gotten anything to run under wine,
yet.  Of course, I've only tried the stuff my wife can't do without, as soon

So my Linux box just locked up.  I was running VMWare, AIM, Konq, KMail,
and quite a few Konsole sessions.  I couldn't kill X.  So, I grudgingly
rebooted, but I got a message about a kernel panic and not finding init.
Odd.  So I booted from a floppy and mounted my filesystem.  Here's what I
found:

/bin, /lib, and /opt are no longer directories.  /bin is now a copy of my
passwd file.  /lib is now a copy of my group file.  And /opt is another
copy of my passwd file.  /usr/local/lib is now a copy of something that
looks like a sound config file, with entries like "synth:64:64:R" and
"pcm:64:64:P".

SoooooooOOOOooOOOOoOOOoo...  what the heck happened?  Any guesses?
Thanks,

Do you have an Athlon system with a Via chipset and this
filesystem is on an IDE drive?

Same with me.  I've given up on wine several times.  I'd love to hear from
someone who has been successful.  I can get Notepad to work OK, but that's
about it.  Also, does anyone know if wineX can be installed on Redhat?  I
would like to see it, but not bad enough to switch distros to a distro that
I an not familiar with.

Not counting Solotaire (as a test people...) I've only 
been running a game utility called Creation Workshop 
under Wine for more than just a quick test.  I tried 
running a later Beta of CW, but it would crash. (Under 
windows it ran, but occasionly gave back wierd results)
I did try a couple games, but I may try again this 
weekend since I tried those with the wine that came with 
SuSe 7.3 and since then I downloaded and recompiled.

So far, my experience has been; If it works, it works 
great.

I've gotten it to work with various results several times.  I would be 
willing to give it a go sometime.

My words of advice:
Never, ever upgrade a working version of wine.
Set up your home directory to be a subdirectory under your user directory

It's all in wine.conf

  Thanks, Paul. I missed the obvious. My version is sendmail-8.11.6-1.6.x,
which is probably just behind yours.

Those were the days when man slipped the bonds of earth's gravity and
went to the moon. Also the era when COBOL was born. The fruit drinks
didn't last, and man stopped going to the moon, but people still use
COBOL. I'm not sure what that says about the state of humanity.

Typically, sendmail determines the hostname dynamically at start up. See
the $j variable in your sendmail.cf file.

Short of writing some custom configuration rules (a task with which I'm
unfamiliar anyway), the easiest solution that leaps to my mind is to
launch two instances of sendmail. Each instance would bind to port 25 on
its specified virtual interface; each would have its own sendmail.cf,
the only difference would be how $j was defined.

Message-ID: <NDBBIOONGDNGNMENKNGAGEIHEIAB.jason@vancleve.com>

Last year, I posted here about a kernel panic which seemed a result of the
VIA "686 bug".  Terry Griffin helped me into a newer kernel, and the problem
seemed to go away.  But yesterday, after some months trying to get IWill or
Fry's to take back my misdesigned motherboard (for all the time I spent
working with these morons, I could have bought a dozen m/b's, but I had a
morbid desire to know if they would ever capitulate), I finally got the
store manager at Fry's to credit me for it.  As a replacement, I ended up
buying an MSI K7T Turbo2.  Ridiculously enough, it has a very similar
chipset, but a woman at Pacific Solutions on Powell (who seemed
knowledgeable enough:  she had been haunted in her own way by this VIA
stupidity) assured me this board did not possess the same fault as my
previous board.  Besides that, it's the only decent board I could find.

While I was configuring the K7T for my dual boot system, I started Linux a
few times and then accidentally set the CAS latency incorrectly in the BIOS,
booted once, and suddenly started having the selfsame problem as before.
The panic message is "VFS: unable to mount root FS on 03:44, and above that
something about "group descriptors corrupted".

What kind of an idiot are you?, you may ask.  Well, this is not the same
chipset, at least not quite.  At any rate, I can now install Mandrake 8.1,
which is something I couldn't do with my old m/b.  This time I delved a
little deeper, because now I have things on my root partition that I'd
really hate to lose.  I started the rescue system from my install CD and ran
e2fsck on the partition, but that wouldn't start, saying it had found an
invalid superblock.  I also tried specifying subsequent blocks (in multiples
of 8192), but no dice.  It seems that partition is fscked once again, though
it has been working perfectly for months now (read:  no, I don't believe the
hard drive is gone bad).

So I'm at the same loss I was at before, to know whether it's my new,
"corrected" hardware that still sucks, or SuSE 7.1, or Linux itself (gasp!
Well, much as I despise M$, Windows has never trashed a partition on me for
no good reason.  I run 98SE on this same box, and although I had to reboot
it a couple dozen times after installing this board, nothing was damaged).
I'm running kernel 2.4.16, which was a constant all through this
installation.  Now, feel free to speculate on what's going wrong here, but
what I really want to know is whether there is any hope for my data.  A lot
of it is backed up (I'm learning), but all my emails were/are in there, not
to mention countless hours of configuration.  Is there aught I can do?

you could try putting the drive in another system, bring it up as a slave, 
then see if you can browse it to leach your files out of it.
if you don't have a spare system, i live in aloha, OR. i have some free

Hello Lunux folkz,
Recently I've assembled Web, DB and file Linux server on Tyan Tiger
SMP2460 MB with two AMD Athlon 1500 MP CPUs.
The BIOS has a nice feature to measure CPU core temperatures in C.
Initially I used Thermaltake 6cu+ aluminum heatsinks with the copper
inserts. I used Dough Corning white silicone heat sink paste.
Idling CPU temperatures measured through the BIOS were at 35 and 36 C
on CPU0 and CPU1. It's good but heat sink fans sounded like a jet on
take off.
I changed these heatsinks on Millennium Glaciator I (not II) pure
copper heatsinks with built in fans.
They came with Cooling Flow heatsink compound. 
The server became very quiet but the idling CPU temperatures raised to
40 C on the both CPUs.
I can't take measurements directly from from CPUs only through the
BIOS and onboard sensors.
Could somebody tell me please if this temperature at 40 C is normal on
idling AMD Athlon 1500 MP CPUs, or it's a little bit to much?
Shold I change heat sink paste, fans or just live it like it is?

Thank you in advance for any thoughts or suggestions.
Alex

You really need to see the temp while the CPU is crunching, but I'd
say you have nothing to worry about.

Still, you might want to let the box crunch on something for a while,
say 10-15 min and then take a look.  Shouldn't go up by more than
10deg or so.

I don't know what the datasheets for the parts say, you could look it
up, but my rule of thumb is <60 is fine.

Message-ID: <3CB6171B.D7C4B024@truedisk.com>

Quick developer's question:

  1) What is the maximum allowed hostname (per DNS)?


I believe the answer probably comes in 2 parts:

  a) maximum allowed domain length (individual name between the "dots")

  b) maximum allowed total domain name length


And, related to the above, I've already specified that

   -    [hyphen]
   0-9  [decimal digits]
   A-Z  [case insensitive]

is the allowed character set.  (Please let me know if I've
blown it.) 


TIA,
- Don

I've always liked the hobgoblins.  Caught one chewing on my IDE cable once.  I keep him in a jar on my desk, as a warning to 
other hobgoblins.  :)

  I'd appreciate ideas on what to do about this error. I was rebuilding the
rawhide-1.0 openldap source package ('rpm --rebuild

  Now, locate shows me:

  Do I make a soft link to /usr/lib/libgdbm.la from /usr/local/lib/? Will
that resolve this hairball?

It looks like somebody trying to overflow your rpc--Remote Procedure Call service.  It runs on port 111. Unless you have a need for NFS or similar services, I wouldn't have that exposed to the world to see.  Even then, I wouldn't let the world have access to that port.  You can block it out at the box with your favorite firewall software.

Even so, you should have a portmapper:all entry in /etc/hosts.deny to disallow use of the service, then put the people you want to have use it in /etc/hosts.allow.  It's not failproof by any means, but it will stop some attacks/mischief.

  OK. I made the soft links from /usr/local/lib to /usr/lib/ and
everything's built and installed just fine. Until I get to sendmail itself.
When I try to freshen the existing installation, I see:

[root at salmo rshepard]# rpm -Fvh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/sendmail-*
error: failed dependencies:
        /usr/sbin/alternatives   is needed by sendmail-8.11.6-15
        chkconfig >= 1.3 is needed by sendmail-8.11.6-15
        bash >= 2.0 is needed by sendmail-8.11.6-15

  I've no idea what /usr/sbin/alternatives is or where to find it. I suppose
that I can upgrade chkconfig easily enough, but ... can I install bash-2.0
in addition to my existing bash-1.14.7-23.6x? Or, will anything break if I
upgrade from 1.14 to 2.0? As bash is so fundamental to the system I need to
understand what I'm doing before doing it. If there are pointers to docs for
me to read, please pass me a pointer to them.

Thanks,

Rich

So now we know Russell's favorite programing language. And we can
expect Karl to shortly post an email stating why Scheme is a better
choice.

What I want to know is which text editor would run best if written
in COBOL: vi, emacs, ed or pico?

(You know, if I truly hated humanity, I'd write a version of edlin in
Intercal. And use the comments from a program like sendmail. Translated
into Old Irish.)

  ln -s to the rescue.

  Now it's a matter of what to do about chkconfig and bash. The latest
sendmail wants more current versions than I have installed, and chkconfig's
latest and greatest wants a newer version of initscripts. This is getting
too close to the kernel for me to be comfortable without really
understanding what I'm doing.

If you really need to update these, you probably want to pull them out
of Skipjack (Red Hat 7.3 beta) rather than Rawhide (Red Hat 8.0 alpha?).

  Ah, thanks Eric! Sendmail wants 'em but I didn't know if I could upgrade
initscripts, chkconfig and bash with impunity.

  And now -- at last! -- I understand what Rawhide is. I suppose, too, that
I could get the RH 7.2 src.rpms for them.

Found it. It was psaux rather than ttyS#

After some discussion, it maybe a case of not having the correct setup
software from the mfg, to get the NIC to behave in a predictable way.

fixed the .vimrc problem - had to change the muttrc from the way it
worked in rh52.

It was sugested that I'd have to reinstall gnupg to make the unsecured
memory error go away. I'd like another opinion!  :)

There's several apps you can use to rip the audio directly from the CD.  A 
favorite, is cdparanoia:

http://www.xiph.org/paranoia/

Also handy, though somewhat difficult to get your hands on is 'dagrab':

http://web.tiscali.it/marcellou/dagrab.html

I like dagrab, simply because it allows you to set the output filename as wella 
s run a command shortly after ripping.  Ie, rip->encode in one handy step.  

If you're not a command line junkie, there's GTK versions:

Thank you.  As promised, I latched on to cdparanoia.  But it wouldn't let 
me work as non-root.  Not sure why yet.  I've allowed my user account to 
perform many relevant operations re: CD access.

Q1: any problem combining wavs and mp3s on a cd to be played on a 
non-computerized cd player?

Q2: Any app that will burn audio cd given ax Xmms playlist (.m3u)?

Subject: [PLUG] how to get a copy of the red hat errata files?
Message-ID: <20020411234624.G14757@defiant.pacifier.com>

When I needed a better solution for offline reading of web based USB
solutions, someone suggested wget:

  wget --mirror http://www.linux-usb.org

And it worked GREAT! So, I thot I'd try:

  wget --mirror http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/rh72-errata.html

But that only gave me _that_ page, and then proceeded to start from
the top of the redhat domain; and soon I was getting some ad tree at
10key*.com

So, any ideas? I don't have a really good pipe, but I've already
discovered a number of things that the updates&errata fix; and since I
have 4 different installs of this code, I'd just as soon have _all_
the updates handy on a CD.

Thanx for some pointers!

Under rh52, when I brought up certain files that contained line draw
chars from the old IBM PC char set (ascii values above 127) I could
see them as expected. Under rh72, these same files produce foreign

Are you seeking to mirror the RH updates ftp site?

Check out ftp://ftp.orst.edu/.1/ftp/redhat.com/linux/updates/7.2/en/os/i386

When you can get in, they're usually fast.  They also mirror older/other 
distros.

Sometimes they lag (by days) the official ftp://updates.redhat.com site, 
but this is much slower.

If I recall correctly (it's been some time since I used cdparanoia), you need 
to open up the cdrom device completely for cdparanoia to work.  Ie, 'chmod 
777 /dev/cdrom'  I may be lying or blowing things out of my anterior end, but 
hey.  

> Q1: any problem combining wavs and mp3s on a cd to be played on a 
> non-computerized cd player?

Assuming the device you're sticking the disc in knows how to tell the 
difference between a .wav and an mp3, there should be no problem.  Realisticly, 
your device (like say, a car CD MP3 player) likes to have all mp3s or a plain 
redbook audio disc.  

Interesting tidbit, 'audio cd's are essentially one .wav file per track. 

> Q2: Any app that will burn audio cd given ax Xmms playlist (.m3u)?

None that I know of, and a quick websearch led to nothing fruitful. If you're 
feeling adventerous, you could probably set up an output plugin to decode the 
MP3s to .wav and burn them to a CD with little effort, though I've no idea how 
to go about it. ;)

Sorta. I dunno how big the space is. bugfixes, and security stuff, and
whatever else redhat includes in their 4 areas would be good:

   rh72-errata.html
   rh72-errata-updates.html
   rh72-errata-security.html
   rh72-errata-bugfixes.html

And, I know it grows nearly daily.

And that is a problem. I don't have a continuous link, so I'm not sure
how to cue it to keep trying until it gets thru, while I'm collecting
my email and other useful things on the days I get access to a pipe.

So, the trade off is faster downloads, albeit a few days late, or
slower downloads of the most current stuff. Well, any downloads would
be wonderful. But redhat don't let me in very often either.

I just built an athlon 1700 system, & got the same noisy fan, then
replaced it with the Volcano 7 which varies from 3200-4400 rpms
depending on cpu temp.  Much quieter now.  I think the Volcano 6 runs at
7200 rpm, which is why it was so noisy.

With the volcano 6, my idle speed was 36, now it's 37-38 with the
volcano 7.

Install lm-sensors.  KDE has an applet sitting in the taskbar, giving me
continous reads of the cpu temp & mb temp.
I got the cpu temp up to 42 when running xawtv (watching tv) & compiling
an application at the same time.

I'm no expert, but from what I've read, 40 is ok, I've got lm-sensors to
spring an alarm at 50.

I decided to fill the cd with mp3s.  Converting the .wavs saved tons of 
space, and while my ears may not be Golden (TM), they are good and mp3 made 
the cut.

I'll probably use xcdroast to order the tracks this time.

It's all contained in the updates dir.  I haven't sync'd in a few weeks, 
but it's ~400Mb

If you're dial-up, you may just need to set aside time to sync.  I'm sure 
there are ftp clients that can handle intermittent connections, just don't 
know what they are called.  Hopefully, people smarter than I will chime in.

Keeping weird hours helps.  I've never figured out the appeal for paying $ 
to use up2date when public ftp is free.

Try looking around for the sg.o module under /lib/modules/kernel-version/...
and using the /dev/sg0 device instead.  I had similar problems with an older 
scsi drive when trying to write to it..?  Beyond that, I'm going to go sleep 
now. :)

If it can, gnupg will try to "pin" memory so that it is prevented from
being swapped out (via the mlock(2) syscall). It then uses this memory
for the crucial bits of the encrypt/decrypt/sign/verify algorithms, so
that if somebody then rips the hard drive out of your machine, your gpg
passphrase or private key (for example) won't show up in the swapped out
pages. When memory is paged back in, the disk location is not scrubbed
clean of the data residing on it [1].

The mlock(2) syscall requires root privileges however, otherwise
any user could perform an easy denial of service attack by creating a
process that uses a large amount of memory and then pinning those pages
in, preventing them from being swapped out. What's changed is that your
gnupg binary is no longer setuid root (and you're wisely not reading
email as root), thus it gives you this message (because it's no longer
running with root privileges).

So you have a security trade-off to make. If you're worried about the
physical security of your machine, then setting gnupg setuid root may
be appropriate. However, adding yet another setuid root program means
that you may potentially be opening up another avenue of attack for
someone with a non-privileged shell on your machine to get root privs
(attackers will often attack a vulnerable non-root network daemon,
using it to give themselves a shell that lets them then start attacking
local setuid programs). If there is, for example, an exploitable buffer
overflow in gnupg, then by making gnupg setuid you've essentially given
anyone who has the ability to run gnupg root access to your machine.

Alas, I've had to look at the gnupg source code, and frankly, I don't
trust it very much. Therefore, I choose to not make it setuid root, put up
with the annoying warning message, and risk the compromise of my private
key information by someone who has physical access to my hard drive. But
that was an explicit choice I made based on what I see as potential
threats and risks, and may not be the appropriate choice for you.

[1] Even if the kernel did this, simple scrubbing techniques (e.g. setting to
    all zeros) aren't effective due to electromagnetic residues. There
    are devices that can read data that has been written over top of
    multiple times on disk.

 From the Redhat _skipjack_ release notes:

   Red Hat Linux now includes a port of the Debian alternatives
   system, as a way to support multiple packages providing a
   particular service. Every binary/file that would be in common
   between the multiple packages is replaced with a symlink to /etc;
   this then resolves to the version of that file for the alternative
   in question. For example:
   /usr/sbin/sendmail -> /etc/alternatives/mta ->
   /usr/bin/sendmail.sendmail
   These symlinks are added and managed by /usr/sbin/alternatives.
   See man 8 alternatives for more details
   Currently, Red Hat Linux offers Sendmail and Postfix as two Mail
   Transport Agent (MTA) alternatives. For print daemon alternatives,
   the choices are LPRng and CUPS.
   Note that the configurations for LPRng and CUPS are completely
   separate. If you switch from one printing system to another, you
   will have to reconfigure your printers.

um... see if there's anything unusual after the rpc line in your logfile... new user accounts, network errors, things that are on the log.

I would also check the command history for root to see if there's anything that you don't remember doing.  /root/.bash_history

And finally, see if you can find out how to do a system checksum audit on the packages you have installed.  It depends on what distro you're using, but most package managers let you verify the integrity of your binaries in /bin, /usr/bin, and /sbin.

I would recommend getting and using either tripwire or aide.  Basically what they do is run a few system integrity checks on your files and make a database of the stats, then whenever you feel like it (or have chron do it) you can run the checks to see what's changed.  The difference between the 2 packages, as I understand it... aide=GPL(free as in freedom) tripwire=proprietary(free as in love).

And I'm assuming you mean, if the attack worked....

What changed was the character set of the font you are using. The default
install now is a set of iso8859-X (X being 1 to 15) This is to support
internationalization.  It seems that the USASCII font set is no longer
included with RH.  I'd suggest grabbing your old CDs and looking for fonts
that aren't included any more and installing them.

Brought up how/where?  Console or X?  Less in an xterm/rxvt?  Emacs?  Dosemu?
You will need to configure the appropriate font wherever you are looking

Alex,

  Tell them that dosemu will do just fine. I use that for my PIM (Info
Select) that I stopped upgrading in 1989. It runs just fine in dosemu and is
the most productive and critical tool I've seen on a computer other than
jpilot.

  When the wind is from the North you can hear the moo-ing coming from
Redmond. Incompatibitiles is the sound of their cash cow: upgrades. Of
course, they're not assuming the personnel costs of translating everything
to keep them current.

  Er, ... just like 78 rpm records, 8-track tapes and betamax video formats?

You're not using the same font that you were before.  You either have
a different one selected, or the new software loaded a new font with 
the same name but different characteristics.  

So, is this in a word-processor where you asked for a specific font?
Does that font name still exist?  If so, what does it look like now?
(You can use xlsfonts and xfd to browse fonts, but you probably have
tons to look through.)

Or is this in a text-processor that is using the default font.
Which font is [YOUR WINDOW MANAGER HERE] using?  You can probably
change the fonts [YOUR TEXT PROCESSOR HERE] is using by invoking
it with the -fn option.  Or you can add a line to .Xdefaults, or
whatever [YOUR WINDOW MANAGER HERE] is reading to get its resources.

On that page, there's a link to the top of the website.  Give wget

What distribution and kernel version are you using?

If it is Mandrake 8.2, then I think I know what is happening. (There is a 
rather nasty bug involving devfs and one of the kernel patches they use. 
(Probably the grsecurity patch, judging by the ksymoops crash dumps.)

This looks like you need to rerun "ldconfig".  It should not be looking in 
/usr/local/lib for those files. (Redhat uses /usr/lib for everything 
"standard".)  Also take a look at the spec file for the RPM and see if it is 
pointing to /usr/local/lib.  Might be some developer's screw-up...

/usr/sbin/alternatives is from the chkconfig package.

I have not had anything break upgrading from Bash 1.x to 2.x, but anything 
truely messy I tend to write in Perl, not Bash.

Subject: [PLUG] Qt and font handling
Message-ID: <1018630558.914.8.camel@reepicheep>

Over the last couple of months I have greatly improved the font handling
(thanks FreeType) on my machines. I did it two different ways just to
get a feel for it: on one of my boxes I used xfs, and on the other I
used XFree configuration.

Fonts look great in all my GTK apps, however, I do have a couple of Qt
apps and play with PyQt, and not only do the fonts look like crap, I
can't even get Qt to work with my TrueType fonts.

I built Qt 3.0 from source and told it to use Xft when it built, and I
am downloading the newest source 3.0.3 and will go through the procedure
again just to see what's going on. I'm thinking about taking a look at
KDE 3.0, but won't go anywhere near it if I can't get some decent font
rendering.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

Michael,

I am running X v4.x, ... I took your suggestions and looked at all the
/var/log/X* logs and could not find anything out of the ordinary.  The logs
indicate that the card is finding the correct amount or Video RAM (4096kB),
... just to be sure, I tried launching X with and without the video memory
defined in the XF86Config-4 file and still have the same issue. 

Thanks,
Rushdan.

Yes, I do get the penguin on the top left of the screen during boot.  How do
I disable framebuffers?
I found a line in the /etc/X11/XF86Config file that said "load dbe", ... I
tried launching X after commenting this line out and the system locked up a
lot faster (2 min compared to the normal 10 min).

Or use 'latin1'.  To view files with high-bit chars in less, I set
'LESSCHARSET=latin1'.  Mutt and links use line drawing, and I didn't
have to do anything for them to work right.

We still need a speaker for this topic!

Someone who has made wine work well, and/or someone running the office

No presentation per se, just proof it works :)

I apologize.

I was not clear.  How do I know if the addition to /etc/hosts.deny
worked.

Unfortunately, it looks as if it occurred again.  However, nothing seems

Basically what they do is run a few system integrity checks on your files and make a database of the stats, then whenever you feel like it (or have chron do it) you can run the checks to see what's changed.  The difference between the 2 packages, as I understand it... aide=GPL(free as in freedom) tripwire=proprietary(free as in love).

Short of trying to access rpc yourself, not much.  I usually block out 
the port with ipchains/iptables because even if you're not running 
anything there, it gets probed alot.

If you're getting repeat probes this close together, then you might have 
a problem of some sort...or at least somebody knows you're running rpc.

I appreciate your help and insights, but I need to ask one more
question.

To be honest, I have been very slow to enact my firewall.  I run
ipchains so I can masquerade but don't block anything bec I have been
unable to get it to work right.  Do you have an example of an ipchains
script that might help.  I have found a few but none work they way they
claim to.

OK, this is what I do:

nmap my box to see what ports are open and have something answering.

Then I kill them with the following:
ipchains -I INPUT 1 -p TCP -s 0.0.0.0/0 -d 0.0.0.0/0 111 -j REJECT

That blocks all traffic on port 111 from the world to the world and 
drops the packet completely.

There's a howto for this on 
http://www.linuxdocs.org/HOWTOs/Firewall-HOWTO.html

You might want to take a look at the Shoreline Firewall
(http://www.shorewall.net).

It's a GPL'd firewall package built on top of iptables. Text file
configs, no fancy gui, and you can see the exact iptables commands it
outputs.

Oh, one more point. On an Internet exposed box, you really don't want to
leave portmapper open. It's been the target of many an exploit, and
unless you're using NFS or NIS, you don't need it at all. I generally
remove it as one of the first things I do on a box.

OK Pluggers!  I have a co-worker that installed Red-Hat 7.2 on a test box.  He did the easiest install possible (ie, automatic partitioning, etc.)  The problem is that the mouse is going crazy under X.  It is a normal 2-button ps2 mouse (made by dell).  The entries in /etc/sysconfig/mouse all look fine to me, but when you go into X and move the mouse, it jumps to the bottom left-hand corner of the screen and then it looks like the button is stuck because whenever you try to move it, it opens up the foot menu (in GNOME) and then jumps back down to the corner.  Anyone have any bright ideas?  the contents of /etc/sysconfig/mouse are below:

FULLNAME="Microsoft - IntelliMouse (PS/2)"
MOUSETYPE="imps2"
XEMU3="no"
XMOUSETYPE="IMPS/2"

Try changing mousetype to imps/2.
The easiest way would probably to look in the XF86Config file.  I'm not a
Redhat person so I don't know where it would be located exactly (could be
in the /etc/X11 directory).  I'd look there first to see under
the "InputDevice" Section if "protocol" is set to imps/2.  It's most likely
there that the problem lies.

The Intellimouse is a "scrollie" mouse, isn't it?  Try "ms" or "ms+" for 
a 2-button.

No wheel on the mouse?

Try "PS2" instead of "imps2".
Probably use "PS/2" instead of "IMPS/2".

Well, that is progress, of a sort.  Do you have a line for UseFBDev in
the video card section?

	Option		"UseFBDev"		"true"

Try setting this to false.

The console framebuffer (that is the cause of the cute penguin) is
enabled in the kernel, there may be another way to turn it off, but I
recompile the kernel without the console frame buffer to disable it. 
I've heard of various problems with the console framebuffer, so this may
be worth a try.

Good Luck

So, I think replying to your own posts is like laughing at your own
jokes, but...

I built Qt 3.0.3 today, and the font dialogues now display my TT fonts
and everything, so I'm guessing there must have been some font problem
in Qt 3.0. Things still aren't perfect, but they are vastly improved.

The solution to your problem depends greatly on how the geometries are
specified. If you have formulaes, i.e. f1(x, y, z) = 0, f2(x, y, z ) = 0,
etc, then what you have is a non-linear optimization problem: find minimum
of a certain function or the smallest of minimums of several functions.
There are, of course, various optimization techniques, for example using
bounding boxes on the shapes to quickly determine which ones are
definitely not the closest one.
Also, you can predict how accurate your result is, and what's the
complexity of computing it.

On the other hand, if your shapes are "sampled", i.e. you have a
collection of points, or a "black box" which for any given point will tell
you if it's inside a shape or outside, the problem is much harder. Unless
you have some information about how "regular" the shapes are, you cannot
even reliably estimate how close your solution is to the true closest
distance. In general, in such situation you should be looking at various
stohastic methods, like Monte Carlo. (note that a wire frame or some other
interpolated shape is in some way closer to the first type that the
second, because you actually describe it with a formula, although a very
complex one with many parameters, so you can estimate the quality of your
solution).

Mathematically, your problem is not specific to geometry, but is an
optimization problem, of one of several kinds. After you determine what
type of optimization problem you are dealing with, look for books on
optimization.

Some questions before I answer.

1. Do you have analytic expressions for the geometric surfaces and their
   positions in the 3D space?

2. Are all the surfaces convex?

3. If the answer to 1 is "no" but 2 is "yes", what is the nature of the
   non-analyticity?  Corners?


This probably brings back bad memories of college maths to some.  If
nobody else chimes in with germane comments perhaps we should take
this off-line, yes?

If you have GTK+ installed on your computer, or have no issues in doing
so, the program Firestarter, which is a gnome program builds a Firewall
using IPchanes or IPtables, and works very well.  It allows you to set
up Nat, and which ports you want open, along with port forwarding or
anything else you might want to set up.

Actually, after sending the note that any examples I found failed me, I
decided to look again.

I found one at
http://www.redhat.com/support/resources/tips/firewall/firewallss.txt
that works very well.

Thanks for all your hope, though, I will keep all that in mind, and in
the future I will not do security through obscurity :)

My manager approached me today and said she'd like me to setup a Linux box
for her to play around with.  She's interested in replacing many of our
employee's workstations with Linux.  She's fairly open-minded about using
Linux, but she wants to make absolutely sure it does everything our users
expect to be able to do.  Anywho, I'm experimenting with some of the more
"desktop friendly" distros and I'd like to test Lycoris.  I haven't had
any luck getting an ISO yet (particularly since it was mentioned on
Slashdot today), but if someone has it or gets it before me and can setup
an ftp site for me to download it from, I'd really appreciate it.

Here's the URL:

P.S.  Save the "Linux has no place on the desktop" nonsense for another

My problem seems like something that someone else would have solved
before.  I was hoping I could converge on a suitable approach fairly
quickly, but even without that, if someone could just point me at a
resource that surveyed what I needed to get up-to-speed, that would be
great.

For those interested, I am preparing to rewrite a program that
computes space potential and electric field using a monte-carlo
random-walk procedure.  From each point of interest, a large number of
random walks are launched which ultimately terminate on a conductor in
the model, which has a specified potential (i.e. voltage).
Statistically, the space potential of the point of interest is equal
to the product of the probability of landing on the conductor and its
voltage.  I am not an EE so I don't quite understand why that works,
just that, as revealed wisdom, it apparently does.  Each step of the
random walk has a length equal to the distance of the nearest surface,
which means that computing the distance is in the inner-most loop of
the algorithm and so doing it as efficiently as possible is a Good
Thing.

The version I am working from was written by an EE in Fortran "some
time ago", originally to run on big iron and later minimally ported to
MS Fortran on NT.  I am rewriting it to try to take advantage of
"advances" made in the interim, tighten up a few algorithmic things,
and also to give us more operational flexibility (better control over
input and output, etc).  Also probably design in some distributed
computation (since the random walks are pretty much independent
operations and there are lots of them).

Thanks!

2) It didn't fit very well into my debian NIS/NFS architecture.  I finally

Hello, interesting problem. I am by no means an expert, but I enjoy a
math puzzle sometimes.

Given what I understand about your problem, I like the idea of using
an octree.

Here's what I am going on:

1) You want to find the shortest distance from a given point to a set
of objects

2) The objects are simple 3d primitives and CSG thereof

3) You will be repeating 1) many times with different reference points
but the same objects.

Using an octree, you only need to compute whether the objects
intersect arbitrary axis-aligned cubes. This should be simple and
efficient for primitive shapes and CSG thereof.

I don't know what representation will be best. You might represent
objects by a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. The
intrinsic parameters depend on the primitive, like a cylinder might
have a radius and height, a box a length, height, and width, a sphere
a radius only. The extrinsic parameters then describe the position and
rotation of the object, together a euclidean transformation. The
rotation might best described as a 3x3 matrix, the columns of which
are the axes of the object. The translation can be a 3 element vector.

You could instead use implicit functions, described earlier in the
thread.

Ok, so basically the algorithm I am thinking of would use the octree
to search for the object-point that is closest to the reference
point. Octants which could feasibly contain the closest point would be
subdivided and labeled with intersecting objects. Octants are feasible
iff they intersect at least one object and are not entirely farther
than any other feasible octant.

Then the process recurses on the child octants until the size of all
remaing feasible octants is less than the tolerance. These octants
represent the closest object points.

When you run the algorithm again with a different reference point, you
can re-use the octree that was derived before, because the objects
have not moved. You start with the smallest octant containing the
reference point, and then search up and down the octree for feasible
octants. As before, the octree is refined until the answer is found.

Periodic octree pruning may be necessary to limit memory usage.

I believe this algorithm might be efficient and easy to implement for
the problem you describe. The error should decrease geometrically with
each iteration. Iterations involve a limited number of primitive-cube
intersection computations. The octree naturally caches the result of
previous computation.

Yes, I would think this is a well studied problem. I regret I don't
know enough to suggest a reference. Octrees are just what I would try
because I don't know any better. :)

If you use a 4x4 matrix you can represent both rotation and
translation together.

printed well with color about a month ago, with the same unaltered

it only printed color photographs in B&W.  The printer likes to replace
my printer driver manually selected in Gimp's "File-Print-Printer
Settings" screen with "Postscript Level 1" which just prints out text
garbage.  If I select any of the other epson printers listed (the C80 is
new and isn't there), it prints fine, but only in B&W.  Which printer is
closest to the Epson C80?  My print command in the line below the
printer model selection is "lp -s -dEpsonC80 -oraw".  Thanks for any
help you may be able to give.

Hi smart persons one and all,

I'm digging into VPN tools, right now looking at FreeS/WAN. Questions:

1. With Frees/WAN, once you set up your connection, all network traffic flows 
over it, so everything moving over your link is protected, correct?

2. How does the user initiate a connection? I've studied the docs until my 
eyes are crossing, and it's not sinking in. Two common scenarios:

-traveller using dialup
-telecommuter with DSL or ISDN

Is there a step the user needs to take to initiate the secure connection, or 
can it be set up automatically?

thanks much,
Carla

Carla,

The procedure is to setup a token and key with the other system before hand.

Then with DSL point your VPN to the IP of the server.  Depending on the
client, you put in your token/PIN/password and that is sent with your key to
the server.  The negotiation happens which included modifying your route
tables so that your network traffic uses the VPN.  The tables are modified
so that inbound traffic is not received directly through your NIC, but
travels to you through the VPN.

Not familiar with dialup, because I dial directly to the net I need.  If you
can't or use a local dialup that then uses the VPN, the connection is made
in the same way as the DSL.

Ken

If your shapes are very simple, i.e. they are known "named" shapes
(spheres, prisms, etc) which can be described by few parameters each, then
your problem is very easy. For such shapes, you can find the minimal
distance from a given point to the shape analytically, as an function of
the same parameters. Some of these expressions may be "conditional" (i.e.
you may have to check which region you're in and then use the right
formula). If your shapes are parts of cilinders, spheres, etc, there will
be more conditions (is the shortest distance to the real part of the shape
or to the cut-off part).
Now, since computing all these distances is very fast, because they are
all rather simple formulas, you can iterate over pretty large number of
shapes before you need to worry about performance. A trivial optimization
with bounding box (or bounding sphere) will quickly take care of all the
distant shapes.
This approach is limited to "known" shapes, i.e. there is a hardcoded set
of shapes you can handle, say, spheres, cylinders, prisms, and piramids.
But as long as that covers your shapes, nothing can beat analytical
formulas.

I have seen this on a few system of late:

It is like ncftp when connecting is using a different port pair, that

I just now tested it, but had no problems (running behind an 
iptables-based firewall)

  [heinlein at billings heinlein]$ cat /etc/redhat-release

I know that Red Hat round-robins its public ftp and rsync servers; I 
wonder if that's the issue. If you're using a local cacheing 
nameserver, have you tried restarting it?

OK, I'm further confused!

I installed ssh on my rh52 installation, and was able to ssh into my
other systems on my home net, and into my ISP shell account. Now that
I've got my rh72 install working, which has ssh as part of it's
install package, I can't seem to ssh into anywhere. What is different
in this version? The systems on my home net have always been rh72.

Subject: [PLUG] lockup logs
Message-ID: <20020415014139.B1550@defiant.pacifier.com>

Is there a way to discover what leads up to a lockup?

One of my home systems hangs every couple weeks. I dunno why. I thot
it was the xlock, but yesterday it hung anyway. It was in 'video idle'
mode, and I couldn't wake it up. This is the usual failure mode.
However, this time I ping'd the sleeping system, and it answered. But
it wouldn't let me ssh in (which I later found it is *normal?*), or
bring up the video.

I thot of disabling the apm, in hopes of keeping the video active
indefinitely, as perhaps a way to at least see the last state prior to
lockup. But apm isn't running on that system. So, I dunno what causes
the video to blank out after a few minutes.

TIA!

The physical security is less of a problem, I think. I generally know
where it is, and I pay close attention to it. The network security is
something else, as it often sets online thru a network somewhere for
extended periods. Sometimes I can trust the firewall it sits behind.
Most times I'm not sure.

So, attacks from outside during these periods, that would grant root
access via setuid bits, are something I'd just as soon avoid. What
would be nice, however, is to not have to tap a key after every email
sent. This is not a fast machine, and sometimes I discover that an
email I thot I sent 10 minutes ago is still waiting on me to
acknowledge the warning. I don't mind the warning being displayed, I
mind having to tap a key every time it appears. Is there some setting
I can make in an options file that will accomplish this?

Are you sure it's not a protocol problem? It's not clear to me exactly what
has transpired, but my hunch is that your install now uses protocol 2
instead of protocol 1. You may have to generate RSA keys. Again, I'm not
clear on what happened with your rh52 > rh72 migration, so I'm just trying
to suggest some things.

What were the keys, if any, you used with rh52? Were you just using password
authentication or did you copy the keys?

Specifically, console, for the rh52 condition. More explicitly, in
telnet. For the rh72 condition, all of the above causes grief. You
suggest the correct font - but I DUNNO what the correct font is. I
dunno what fonts changed between those two distro's.

This is probably the case.

The question is: which font is TELNET using. Where do I look to find
out? How do I select a different font. How do I select a different
font for standard console use?

This is NOT an X question.

No, I'm not sure about anything. The rh72 install is on a separate
disk, not an upgrade of the existing install. I can switch back to the
rh52 anytime (at least for the near future; I plan to overwrite it
soon with an LFS experiment). The ssh keys were regenerated on the
rh72 disk, and this morning when I was shutting it down to take it to
where I get my DSL 'fix', I noticed that scp had worked for awhile,
and then stopped.

Further thot is this:

Last month I had wanted to contact drizzle.pdxlinux.org without typing
all that in every time, so I got the IP address, and put drizzle into
my /etc/hosts file; so that I could type 'ssh drizzle'. There was some
sort of problem with that, and I was advised to put the definition of
drizzle into my .ssh/options file. So, I looked up the man page on
that, and tried to configure such a file. I could find lots of things
I could do with that options file, but nothing that would allow me to
alias drizzle to the full domain name. So, I abandoned that project,
but since then, have not been able to get ssh to work.

As to the keys, I created and used all the keys available: rsa dsa and
plain. I have the identity.pub and id_rsa.pub and id_dsa.pub files,
and the correct version exist on the target machines, but I keep
getting 'connection refused' messages. The last time that the scp
command worked, it asked me for my rsa key, then it asked for my dsa
key, and then it asked for my standard login, and then it copied the
files. I think it shouldn't be asking for all the keys every time,
(only one?), but at least it allowed file transfers.

Hmmm, I've never twiddled with the fonts in console mode myself, but
doing a man -k on console comes up with:

consolechars         (8)  - load EGA/VGA console screen font, screen-font map, and/or application-charset map

which looks like it might be what you want.

And forget what I said earlier about xlsfonts and xfd - the X fonts are in
a different bucket entirely, and xfd, well it won't run under not-X.
(Which means that I have no idea how you might preview the fonts.)

At the risk of being redundant, I'd check your memory with memtest86.  If
memtest doesn't find anything wrong, start taking out addin cards and leaving
the system running until it locks up.  If it's not the cards, your proc may be
bad.  If swapping/replacing the proc doesn't fix it, it might be the
motherboard.  Or a flaky power supply.

My rule of thumb is to start with the easiest debug first, then go to the
progressively harder/expensive methods to determine the problem.

Since memory is cheap and easy to diagnose, start there.  The only addin card
you *need* is video, so anything extra might be causing a problem.

Since it's a dual P200, are both the processors of the same stepping?  I've
heard mismatched steppings can cause problems.  Try taking one out, then
swapping them.

I'm a debug tech in my current (and past two) job, so most of these things are
no-brainers for me.  Give the above a shot and see what you come up with.
Sometimes it's just a dirty component or a simple intermittant short that
causes a panic.  If all else fails, tear it all apart (make sure you're
properly grounded), air-blast off the dust-bunnies, spray some
degreaser/cleaner on a rag, wipe down the connectors, make sure everything is
nice and clean and reassemble.

My next question is: Is the sshd running on the target? That sure is what it
sounds like, now. Especially if the other services have died, too.

If so, you might wanna zap your .ssh/options file and start again in vanilla
mode. Or you can just remove the drizzle section if you have anything else
you really really need in there. The options file is pretty handy when you
have one machine (like I do) that is very particular (only accepts protocol
1) compared to your defaults.

And when all else fails, you can try the debug options on ssh. They work
fairly well to see where it's dying.

And I think the font that you want may be called default8x16.  I suspect
your current font is some form of Latin1.  Sorry, I can't easily check
this with my current setup.

It might be worthwhile to review

Are you using a KVM switch?
I've had this happen to me using a Cybex SwitchView 4-port switch.  Don't 
know if it's the the switch's fault, but I have my suspicions.  I would 
switch to the machine and see only video black.  Happened to two machines.

Lately, it seems to have fortoggen its hot-key sequence too, but that's 
another story.

Debugging lockups
(item by Wade Hampton)
A good means of debugging lockups is to get the ikd patch from
Andrea Arcangeli: 
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/andrea/kernel-patches
There are several of debug options, but do NOT use the 
soft lockup option!  For newer SMP boxes,
turn kernel debugging then turn on the NMI oopser.  
To verify that the NMI oopser is working, after booting the 
new kernel, 
/cat /proc/interrupts and verify that you are getting
NMIs.  When the box locks up, you should get an OOPS.
You may also try the %eip option.  This allows the kernel
to print on the console the %eip address every time a kernel function
is called.  When the box locks up, write down the first column 
ordered by the second column then lookup the addresses in the 
System.map file.  This works only in console mode.
Also note that the use of a serial console can greatly facilitate
debugging kernel lockups, not just SMP kernel lockups!


snip snip


A bug in the 440FX chipset (from Emil Briggs)
If you had a system using the 440FX chipset then your problem with the
lockups was possibly due to a documented errata in the chipset.  Here is
a reference
References: 
Intel 440FX PCIset 82441FX (PMC) and 82442FX (DBX) Specification Update.  
pg. 13 
http://www.intel.com/design/pcisets/specupdt/297654.htm
The problem can be fixed with a BIOS workaround (Or a kernel patch) and
in fact David Wragg wrote a patch that's included with Richard Gooch's
MTTR patch. For more information and a fix look here:
http://nemo.physics.ncsu.edu/~briggs/vfix.html

Yes, but in these instances, I haven't been switched away to another
system, only let the system idle for several hours (over nite) then
tried to 'wake it up' by tapping the shift key.

But now that you mention it, I'll check to see if I get video direct
next time it occurs.

This was great. took about 2-3 hours to collect 488MB. Couldn't use
wget tho, had to use "ftp -iv ... mget *". Now, how do I discover
collecting 'only new files'. I suppose a script is in order, any body

IP spoofing is fairly trivial to do with a tool like nmap. The idea is 
that you send a ton of port pokes off to the target machine, but only 
a few of the packets actually contain the IP address of the probing 
machine. That way, it makes it more difficult for the target to 
ascertain the identity of the prober.

It seems to me a lot of this nonsense would go away if ISPs enforced 
some router discipline for their dial-up and DSL customers. The ISPs 
could merely refuse to forward packets that don't have a host address 
matching their dial-up/DSL subnet(s). If that were the default policy 
(with exceptions made when a customer can convince the ISP that 
outbound spoofing is legitimate), lots of 'false hosts' would 
disappear from /var/log/*.

Of course, I might not understand all the issues an ISP faces in this 
regard. I'd be interested to hear from someone who's had to deal with 
this.

Challenging the Man-in-the-Middle
By Brian Hatch

Recently, a machine on which I have an account had several accounts 
cracked. I hadn't actually logged into the machine in a few months, but 
one of the admins sent me an email asking me to help track down the 
problem.

When logging in, several users reported seeing themselves already 
logged in from strange locations or running funny processes. Most of 
these folks are generally security-conscious, use strong passwords, and 
don't fall for the standard social engineering tricks. Because the 
admin is good and paranoid, the machine is always kept up to date on 
patches and ssh is the only way to login, meaning the traffic is all 
encrypted. I suspected some vulnerability that wasn't yet public 
knowledge on the 'Net.

I went to log in and was greeted with this:

    home$ ssh server
    @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

    home$

The ssh host key had changed.  Any time you see this, you should 
suspect the worst.  However, since we've had a few ssh vulnerabilities 
recently, I figured that the admin had accidentally wiped out the 
original ssh keys in /etc/ssh and needed to make new ones.  Heck, I've 
done it myself.

So I commented out the old key (line 17 in my ~/.ssh/known_hosts file) 
and re-ssh'd in, accepting the new key.

Before I tracked down the intrusion, I figured that I'd see if I could 
get the original ssh host key from backups so I (and others) wouldn't 
get that annoying message each time we login.  I went into /etc/ssh, 
where the keys are kept, and saw the following:

    server$ ls -l /etc/ssh*
    -rw-r--r--    1 root     root    1412 Jun 12 12:10 ssh_config
    -rw-------    1 root     root     526 Jun 10 09:44 ssh_host_key
    -rw-r--r--    1 root     root     330 Jun 10 09:44 ssh_host_key.pub
    -rw-r--r--    1 root     root    1216 Jun 12 12:13 sshd_config

I was trying to see if I'd made a directory named /etc/ssh.bak or 
similar.  (I tend to leave backups of /etc/ssh around out of 
laziness).  I was not surprised to see no backup ssh directory, but I 
was surprised to see that the host key had not been changed recently -- 
Jun 10th was when the machine was installed in the first place.  
Checking 'ls -c' output (to see the inode change time) also showed the 
Jun 10th date.

I compared (visually) the public host key file on the server with line 
17 of my ~/.ssh/known_hosts on my home machine; they were the same, but 
if they really were the same, I shouldn't have gotten that warning.  I 
tried ssh'ing in again to see if I was going crazy, but no; in fact, 
the key being presented was different from server:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_key.

I stopped and restarted the sshd daemon in debug mode under ptrace and 
verified that it was reading the correct key files in /etc/ssh.  Still 
the wrong key was being presented.

At this point, I was pretty convinced I'd solved both the ssh problem 
and the cause of the cracked accounts.  To test my theory, I ran a copy 
of sshd as follows: 

    server$ sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -d -p 4321

This started an ssh server on port 4321.  I uncommented line 17 of my 
~/.ssh/known_hosts, putting the file back the way it had been for the 
last nine months.  I then connected to the server from home as follows:

    
    home$ ssh -p4321 server 'echo connected to `hostname`'
    connected to server
    home$

As you see, my ssh connection to port 4321 was established successfully 
and the lame 'echo' command ran.  But there was no complaint about the 
host key being different.  The key on line 17 of my ~/.ssh/known_hosts 
matched the key presented by the ssh server on port 
4321.  /usr/sbin/sshd was using the key from /etc/ssh as it should.

So, what was wrong?  I'll give you the answer in two weeks.  If you 
think you have it figured out, drop me a line.  I'll send the first 
person who gets it right a postcard and immortalize them in the follow-
up article. Extra points if you can describe how to trace down the 
culprit.

This is my script for calling wget.  You need to modify it because
different hosts have different paths, but I've used it on U of O's ftp
site before.

Also, a while ago Paul Heinlein shared his script that does the same
thing using rsync.  You should be able to find it in the archives.

Another one you could look at is Bastille - http://www.bastille-linux.org/
It's a "hardening script" that is useful for tuning RedHat and Mandrake
systems into firewalls (the Debian port is still in process). It asks a
whole bunch of questions and then configures your system based on the
answers.

Good idea, you should be able to disable it in the BIOS.  If that fixes
it, there may be some options available during a kernel configuration
that will fix it.  "Allow interrupts during APM call" or something like
that.  What kind of chipset does your video card have?  Maybe your
kernel has ACPI enabled, but your motherboard implementation is buggy.

Otherwise, start pulling hardware (or swapping it) until you find the
culprit.

I would start with a nice fresh kernel, compiled for your specific
hardware before looking at the hardware.

Good Luck

  I'm no security expert despite having read Cliff Stoll's book a couple of
times, but from the whole article this is what I think he meant.

  Despite being very security conscious and not giving out their passwords
to strangers, they were all taken in by the craftily-worded login notice.
Because it appeared so legitimate (such as the Microsoft virus that
advertised itself as a virus detector), they went ahead and changed their
ssh server access key. While we need to wait a couple of weeks for the end
of the story, my guess is that the password sent plain text copies of the
username and password to the man in the middle.

  We tend to be trusting animals, no matter how callous and cynical we may
be in normal circumstances. If someone calls you on the telephone and tells
you that your child has become ill in school and was taken to the hospital,
you'd probably dash off to the hospital without calling the school back to
verify the report. We all have hot buttons, and there are those who know
very well how to identify them and push them. We react just as we're
programmed to do.

But that *IS* the message that SSH uses when this happens. It is not a logon
message, it is the SSH *client* warning you. The logon happens AFTER this
text is displayed.

I'm guessing the man in the middle is port forwarding the traffic to a
different port on the target machine. You could check with a netstat command
or check the sshd logs.

When he mentions this it is before he has noticed the ssh problem, so he is
simply saying that some accounts have been hacked but that he does not
believe it was through social engineering(ie: "This is Joe from Sun calling
and <insert VP name> asked us to look at the system....").

As for the attack itself, man-in-the-middle attacks are primarily used to
sniff usernames and passwords or in a more advanced form (which it sounds
like we have here) to accept an ssh connection on the middle machine,
initiate a new connection to the intended host from the middle machine, and
then decrypt both the victims and the intended host's packets on the middle
machine while at the same time forwarding packets between the two outside
machines.  It is similiar to the ATM (as in automated teller machine) hack
of the early to mid 90's.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0204161551080.30958-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  Based on all the Good Things written about spamassassin here I grabbed the
RH package and tried installing and activating the tool. What I see on my
drives and in my logs doesn't match what is written in the README file. So,
I hope that someone here has climbed this particular learning curve and can
help me off the exercise wheel.

  I installed the package the usual way: rpm -ivh spamassassin.... Worked
just fine. But, when I look at the README file
(/usr/doc/spamassassin-2.11/README), I see that I'm supposed to have a
subdirectory SpamAssassin/ in my home directory. It ain't there.

  When I look at /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf I also end up at a dead
end:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ less /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf 
# Add your own customisations to this file.  See 'man Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf'
# for details of what can be tweaked.
# 
[rshepard at salmo ~]$ man Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf
No manual entry for Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf

  There is no spamassassin process I can see when I grep 'ps ax', yet
'~/procmail/log' contains references to spamassassin. So, I suppose that the
daemon is running -- some time.

  Where do I read how to tune and tweak spamassassin, and to control it?
Apparently it's a perl script (or set of scripts), but I'm quite confused
what I'm supposed to do at this point to add specific domains or otherwise
filter out more of the spam I receive.

TIA,

rpm -ql spamassassin | less

will tell you what files it installed and where.

try this instead:

perldoc Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf

That's the platform neutral perl documentation tool.  If that perl
module is installed, perldoc will find it and get you the
documentation.

There was an article about spamassassin on www.perl.com a while ago
that was written by the author.  It should be in the archives if you
run a search on the site.

I think it needs to be .spamassassin/user_prefs. This is made
automatically, according to the  man page.

This substitutes a sed-command for man's default-pager, which is probably
less. It removes the pesky "character-backspace" pairs, and prints to
stdout without the equaly pesky page-break formatting.  Substitute the
name of the manpage you want for "manpage". You'll get extra points for
good punctuation.

	man -P 'sed "s/.`echo -ne ".\010"`//g" ${1}' manpage

It's ugly, but it works on my box.

If you're interested in printing man pages, man(1) does PostScript
nicely:

How about unplugging the printer, then clearing the print queue?

This is what I'd try:

1. Power off the printer, or disconnect its cable

2. Run 'lprm -a all'

3. Run 'lpc kill'

Then see what happens.

Dirk,

  It's not gone bonkers, but printing what it is being fed: PostScript.

  Apparently gs has stopped converting the postscript into whatever language
the Canon recognizes.

  What is your printing system (lp, lpr, lpRNG, CUPS, etc.) and what
application are you using to feed the printer?

Thanks Matt and Paul.

Yes Rich,

printer with printtool ,  I  change nothing. I seem have both lpr and cups

It is Postscript , Properties being; 
lpr ${MOZ_PRINTER_NAME:+'-P'}${MOZ_PRINTER_NAME}
How do I change this?

Dirk,

  With CUPS, invoke the printer setup as '/usr/sbin/printers'. Also, when I
define a printer string for an application (e.g., mozilla) I do it as 'lpr
-P<printer_name> %s'.

  When I installed CUPS I removed lpr first. Now when I try to find
'printtool' on my system this is what I see:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ locate printtool
/usr/doc/rhl-rg-6.1en/figs/sysconfig/printtool-addlocal.gif
/usr/doc/rhl-rg-6.1en/figs/sysconfig/printtool-addremote.gif
/usr/doc/rhl-rg-6.1en/figs/sysconfig/printtool-filter.gif
/usr/doc/rhl-rg-6.1en/figs/sysconfig/printtool-ncp.gif
/usr/doc/rhl-rg-6.1en/figs/sysconfig/printtool-smb.gif
/usr/doc/rhl-rg-6.1en/figs/sysconfig/printtool-test-menu.gif
/usr/doc/rhl-rg-6.1en/figs/sysconfig/printtool-type.gif
/usr/lib/rhs/control-panel/printtool.warn

  So I suppose it's no longer available. Anyway, with the CUPS GUI printer
setup you define the printer, the device by which it's known and so on. The
CUPS documentation has all the details.

  FWIW, I paid Easy Software for their PrintPro drivers so I could get the
full benefit of the HP 2500C under linux. It does a much better job printing
from The GIMP in linux than from MapInfo in the virutal win98. For me, it is
well worth the money. But, there may be enhanced drivers freely available
for the Canon model you have. Check both the ESW and linux printing sites.

HTH,

Rich

Randy,
 
  I don't want to wander off-topic here, but there is a large difference
between "mapping" software and spatial-analytical software (a.k.a. "GIS").
AFAIK, the only linux GIS is GRASS (Geographic Resource Analysis Support
System).

  But, I'll take a look at gnomad-mapping, thank you.

If there is anything left in the spool, that won't fix it
permanently... when you turn on the daemon again, and it'll keep
trying to spit out the print job.  So figure out where your print
system stashes its print jobs and look there to be sure they are
really gone.  Someone earlier suggested looking in /etc/printcap to
see where "sd" points and look there.

I managed the engineering group at Verio Oregon for about 3 years
and I don't believe there is any reason that ISPs couldn't enforce
this (and many do.) Of course, someone could always present 
counter arguments.

yes, checked that (b4 asking 4 help). Found it wasn't running on the source,
which I fixed, and then checked the targets. But that didn't help.

Zapped the options file first thing this am, again before requesting
help. Had renamed it first (to _options), but that didn't work either.

Good idea, hadn't thot of that. The funny thing is, now that I'm back
on my home system, having rebooted twice (once to go to the
dsl-mail-service, and once to return) scp is working fine, as is ssh.

I don't get it! AAAaaaarrrrgggghhhh!!!!

Now if I could just get nfs working. Or anything else that lets me
view the contents of the CDRW on one system from another system.

The "ready-at-the-hip" response of one of my sysadmins several years ago
was, "Reboot". We all kidded him about it but unfortunately it worked 85% of
the time.

And if that fails, Samba can be your friend. It's not just for Windows,

This looks like it just gets all the files. How do I just get the
"new" files? Maybe that's in Paul's script.

I always turn ALL apm features off in the BIOS. I *hate* rebooting a
machine to tweak those settings. If I want things saving energy, I'll
find a software way, or turn off the monitor.

The vid card is a Matrox Millenium II, but I don't have the manual
handy, and am not yet ready to yank hardware to fix this.

What? The redhat72 kernel isn't good enough? How can that be?  ;)

compiling a fresh kernel is likely to happen soon anyway, but I've
never done that, and I'm a little nervous about making the thing
unusable. So, I'll be doing that on a less critical machine first,
until I get comfortable with it, and with the correct changes to the
grub file, etc.

Bruce,

  Mike Gleason wrote/writes/maintains ncFTP <http://www.ncftp.org>. Among
other features, it can pick up a disrupted download from the point of
interruption, you can put and get multiple files without worrying which are
binary and which are ASCII, you can specify the full path and file names on
the command line and it will get that one file for you without your direct
interaction, and it can be set to do puts and gets in the background and
from a cron job.

  The latest version has even more support for running behind a firewall and
it allows you to specify a particular username when a site requirs that (and
that formerly made me switch to vanilla ftp -- yuck!).

Paul's script uses a different internet protocol called Rsync.  Rsync
was built to mirror directories on different machines and it only
mirrors what it needs to.

The --mirror switch to wget (which uses FTP) is a shortcut to a whole
series of other switches, one of which says "Only download files that
are newer that what I already have".

We cannot cancel. We have to have a meeting every month, or the music
folks will get the space. Even if all we do is have a social
opportunity to solve oddball problems, that are not really Advanced
issues, but are clearly more difficult than a Newbie issue.

We have to show consistancy. We have to keep the meeting going. I'll
be there tonite; and there was some discussion about the current state
of the Web Committee, so maybe that'll be tonites topic.

Please, folks, lets all at least show up and buy some beer!

Message-ID: <20020417165513.H1586@defiant.pacifier.com>

I'm trying to access the CD on one system from another, and it
consistently fails. So today, while at Jeme's, I tried to mount a
volume that he has successfully exported and mounted on one of his
systems (doing it as root to sidestep user issues):

   [root at defiant jeme]# mount -t nfs 10.42.42.39:/export/home/ /mnt
   mount: RPC: Timed out

This is the same error I get on my systems at home, which implies to
me that I have got things correctly configured on the server side. Any
ideas on what's wrong on the client side?

  When I had RPC problems here it almost always was resolved by restarting
the network on the uncooperative machine.

OK. That's handy. Except that I'd need to keep a local copy on my
laptop in order to "only download newer files", and I was hoping to do
some sort of filename/date compare from a list.

If you are just looking at ftp, take a look at the mirror perl script. The 
problem I have with wget is it doesn't remove files that no longer exist on 
the site you are mirroring... Unless I've overlooked something.

I've always been a fan of wget for updates et al.  It does http and ftp and
can do recursive gets.... not that you could use it to snarf up pr0n or
anything, but that's a definate usage. ;^)  The syntax is like this "wget -r
ftp://mirror.you/want/to/copy/filename" for a recursive snarf.  There are
also options for a username and password if you need it.

There's also prozilla, which lets you grab a file in as many ftp sessions as
you can handle, similar to the windows utility flashget.  It's good for
those who have mondo bandwidth but are capped at the server side.  I use
this to download ISO images to burn.

Tried that, no help. Found out that if I shutdown the firewall on my
laptop, NFS works.

Now to figger out the best balance of services and protections.

I'm pretty sure that Jeme and I are both at version 2; but for sure
they are the same at the house. However, I'm not sure how to get nfs
to report.

Subject: [PLUG] Crossover Office
Message-ID: <20020418040326.12670.qmail@web9608.mail.yahoo.com>

Codeweavers has developed Crossover Office, an
application that allows one to run Microsoft's Office
suite on a Linux platform. (Currently I have it
installed on Calders, so I know that it doesn't have
to be Red Hat.)

For some, the former inability to run Microsoft Office
on Linux has been a major obstacle to the adoption of
Linux. The Codeweaver software appears to run Word at
native speeds, but I'll have to use it more to make a
thorough evaluation.   

Codeweavers also offers a set of plug-ins to run
streaming applications on Linux that were formerly not
available. I was able to view "Candy in Hell," on the
Shockwave site, though it appeared to play too fast.
(When she's in hell, she's "fast": maybe that's it.)

Hi again,
I have a 350 amd with 128 meg of memory using RedHat 7.2.
Have written earlier about kde 3.0 locking the system.  Thought I had it resolved
when I re-did the kde 3.0 install.  It's locking up again.  It locks up when I
boot-up
with the printer turned on.  Also noticed that there was a error on boot-up about
irq 5?  Goes by to fast to read.  Questions:
1.  How do I list the bootup messages?  Are they in a log file?
2.  Is there a way to list all of the irq # and what they are assigned to?
3.  The last thing changed was installing a new network card to get on the cable
     modem.  In windows it says that the irq for the nic is #5.  I thought irq #5 was

     reserved for the printer?  I am thinking that because the nic was the last to be

     installed that I will need to changed it's irq setting.  How?
    Nic   NEC 3000   pci   pnp
Thanks for your help

Irq 7 is generally reserved for lpt1. Irq 5 is "generally" for lpt2, and is 
"generally" free for extras. I like to put NICs on Irq10, if I have to place them 
manyally.

Check in /var/logs for the bootlog. I'm not next to a 7.2 system, but it IIRC 
it's obviously named. It has those quicly scrolling messages. You can also use 
the pause key to get the boot process to stop. How it resumes varies by BIOS, 
but, it's generally space, enter or another strike of the pause key.

Hi Cooper,

I'm contacting you to raise your awareness of a new job resource specifically targeted to open source professionals such as yourself and the members of your LUG. We've recently launched JobPenguin (http://www.JobPenguin.com), developed by open source professionals who believe in the industry and want to give it the support it needs and deserves. Our President is an experienced PHP programmer, and our CTO is the author of the book "Slackware Linux for Dummies".

We are currently marketing the site to over 250 companies who are specifically targeting open source skills such as Linux system administration, PHP, C++, Python, Perl, and Java. We are also marketing to the broader business market, targeting companies who may only have one division or location that needs open source professionals. We are trying to get the word out there just like the rest of the community that open source is the way to go.

We invite you and your members to visit JobPenguin and register. Post your r?sum?. Make it public or keep it private. Be anonymous if you wish. Set up a job retriever that will e-mail you with new job postings that match your criteria.

If you have any feedback on the site PLEASE send it to me. All opinions and ideas are appreciated.

Also, if you would like me to send a message to the LUG through a mailing list that you maintain please advise.

Thanks,
Jared

Message-ID: <DB4CCE75C758D211818F0008C7B140893374242E@beavertn-svr-78.nike.com>

Answers to your Questions:
1.  How do I list the bootup messages?  Are they in a log file?
	A. under /var/log/dmeg you should see your boot messages.

2.  Is there a way to list all of the irq # and what they are assigned to?
	A. `cat proc/interrupts` should give you a listing.

3.  The last thing changed was installing a new network card to get on the
cable
     modem.  In windows it says that the irq for the nic is #5.  I thought
irq #5 was
     reserved for the printer?  I am thinking that because the nic was the
last to be
     installed that I will need to changed it's irq setting.  How?
    Nic   NEC 3000   pci   pnp
	A. If you feel you need to change the IRQ setting for your parallel
port you need to change it in the BIOS.  If you need to change the network
card you may need to download a setup utility to reconfigure the settings of
the card.  But without knowing that card (NEC 3000? I couldn't find on the
net) in specific I can't tell you.

Hope this helps,

As root use the command dmesg and pass the output to less via a pipe, i.e. #

Ben meant "/var/log/dmesg" :-)

Linux systems typically have a binary interface to that file, 
/bin/dmesg. Try running "dmesg | less" to see the kernel's boot 
messages.

Also use "dmesg" to see boot messages.

Well here I go, responding to my own post.  With #1 below that was for a
debian system only.  In RedHat you can look under /var/log/boot.log or
/var/log/messages (or take Russell Evans suggestion that just popped in!)

I'm experiencing some strange behavior with the Intel i815 graphics

them.  You can minimize the window and then maximize it again and
sometimes the lines go away and sometimes they get worse.
Has anyone else experienced this odd behavior with this chip?  Any

I'm coming into this a little late, but I can't help wondering why you
don't want to use "up2date."  If you just want to download the files,
you can configure it that way and run it from the command line.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.33.0204181546120.14851-100000@lukem.com>

Hi,
I'm trying to configure a Linux box so it can send the proper code to an
application when the various Function keys are pressed.  Here's how it
should work...  I login to the server and run the app.  Pressing F5 should
send:    ^[[6~

I used loadkeys to set this up and if I press the F5 key while on the
console, it prints this string.  However, the app on the server behaves as
if I'm actually typing in each of those characters individually, and
that's not what I want.  The box I'm testing this on is Mandrake 8.2.

If anyone has any suggestions on how to make this work or where I might
find more information on how to configure this, I'd appreciate it.
Thanks,
~M

I figured it out.  I was sending the ^[ as two separate characters.  I
replaced my string with \033[6~ and it works.

I recently found out that a close friend's 13-year old daughter was
sexually molested by someone she met using one of the Instant Messenger
clients available on the 'net. This has encouraged me to try to 
manage closer monitoring of my own daughters' IM activities. It's
occurred to me that someone may have already implemented something to
do this.

Does anyone know if this is something Squid can accomplish, or if
there is something else available that can log specific traffic

I believe that there are vulnerabilities related to NFS that allow an 
intruder to gain access to a remote system. You might want to consider 
using secure NFS via SSH tunnel for added security.

Actually...  It works on the command line to do this:

# loadkeys
keycode 63 = F55
string F55 = "\033[6~"

But when I put these same lines in my us.kmap file, it just prints 6~.
Does anyone know how to get the escape sequence to work properly from
within the keymap file?
Thanks,
~M

Geez, you guys are slow today.  I'm solving all my own problems before you
even respond.  ;-)
I figured it out.  In my us.kmap file, I have to create the ^[ as one
character.  So in vi, I go:
Ctrl-v
Ctrl-[

Can't you just delete the .galeon folder from your home directory?

Galeon seems to store its info in the user's .galeon and .mozilla
directories. Trashing both of these ought to give you a clean slate.

    rm -fr .galeon .mozilla

Or better yet (if you want to be able to "undo" the clean slate):

    mv .galeon galeon-files
    mv .mozilla mozilla-files

Or something similar.

Yep, that Carla chick's pretty smart. My fave author.

FreeS/WAN is most impressive. I've been looking at a lot of different free 
VPN tools, it tops my list. Of course the biggest headache is connecting 
Windows and Mac clients. Them two just don't like to play with the other kids.

I saw an interesting free project somewheres using SSH and PGP to set up a 
VPN. Free is more attractive than usual, as pricing on commercial products 
tends towards sky-high. For example, SuSE has a VPN/firewall edition that 
lists around $1100.  For that kind of money it better rub my feet and wash 
the dishes.

You're looking for specific IPs taht come across and such (something more robust than netstat)? Wish I could help there, but gaim has the option to save all IM conversations, too - you'd at least know who with and what about your daughter was chatting on the 'net.

On a side- and somewhat late-note to the discussion, I once got a VPN working 
briefly using SSH and PPPd.  There was pinging and a talk session and generaly 
complaints about speed and we resolved to instead, just not.   

But it's not difficult!  I've been meaning to fiddle with frees/wan -- I'd be 
interested in any cavets or success stories. :)

My employer was in the middle of Chapter 7 and without funds, but needed 
connectivity between offices in Vancouver, Honolulu and San Luis Obispo after 
they sold off everything else to another company.

I worked with two people who did a basic debian install on two boxes in 
Honolulu and SLO.  I then sshed into the remote boxes and created a freeswan 
vpn between all the sites.  I set up all the specifics over the existing 
corporate wan.  After the company was sold off they fired up the Freeswan 
boxes.  The first night we had some problems.  Pings worked fine but 
windows-goo domain syncing was failing.  After some careful looking and some 
google searches I discovered that the ethernet MTU size had to be 1493 to  
accommodate the vpn infrastructure.  After that it justed worked.  They never 
called or reported any problems.

The other caveat to this is that all the machines where 133Mhz to 200Mhz, no 
big CPUs were required.

Getting it installed can be a bit of a headache.  Unless things
have changed since I looked at it, you've got to do lots of funny
kernel compile stuff.  I read the 'list in brief' posting every
week or two, and there seems to be some talk of (finally) making it
sufficiently modular to be compiled external to the kernel, which
would be very handy.  Otherwise, it's a bit of a mess to figure
out all the left hand and right hand stuff, but it's not too bad.

I assume you mean SSH and PPP.  Yeah, it's quite easy in fact;
if you have some clues you can get one up and going in about
15 minutes.  You don't really need SuSE's special distribution;
it's not too terribly difficult to roll-your-own, but not as easy
as I'd like.  OTOH, if you've like a very easy to set up and not
very expensive solution, the SnapGear products I sell are pretty
nice and Linux+FreeS/WAN based.

It's not so bad, no worse than any installation from source. There's also an

It also may be your cable is just a little loose. Or that you have a bad

Interesting.  I can see both sides of the discussion that followed that
story.

On a semi-related note, I found the following article on the same site -
it discusses the problem of how to advocate Linux use to "Average Joes"
without going way over their heads or sounding condescending:

 http://newsforge.com/newsforge/02/04/18/0146221.shtml?tid=23

I wonder if such an approach might work in PDX?

Hi all,
Looked at `cat /proc/interrupts` and found that my sound blaster 16 was on the the same Irq # as
the printer Irq #7.  Also checked the bios and found that I had reserved Irq 11 for a old video card
that was not PnP (card has been replaced with a new video card some time ago).  As far as I can
tell there is no Irq # conflicts and they are assigned correctly.  The network card 3com nc3000 (I
checked the board) moved its self from Irq #5 to Irq #10 on bootup.  After this was done the
computer did not lockup once.  Still can not get the printer working.
I found no error message in the dmesg log file.

Thanks for all your help
Abraham Z.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0204190838590.10163-100000@joan.burling.com>

Occasionally, I get an email from CNET about the new articles on their
website, & usually I delete them after a brief glance. But the latest
one I received piqued my curiousity:

``Windows XP Nightmares -- http://home.cnet.com/software/0-6688749-8-9696202-1.html"

So I had a quick read. The article mentions three big complaints, the first
being as follows:

``The nightmare
>From time to time, when I open an Excel spreadsheet, my XP machine reboots.
There's no warning. The system just hangs for a couple of seconds, then the PC
starts up as if I had just switched it on or hit the reset button. Do ghosts
live in this machine, or is Microsoft trying to lower the country's
productivity?"

And what is the cause? According to CNET, ``Whenever the OS encounters a
Stop Error--the kind that, in earlier editions of Windows, resulted in the
dreaded blue screen of death--the system automatically reboots." So in
other words, since you're going to need to reboot anyway, Windows does it
for you. And the article explains how do disable this in order to see
the error message.

Sigh. Since all MS appears capable of doing with this chronic problem is
to change it's name every few years (once upon a time Windows users griped
about GPFs), why can't they improve the error messages? Add some diagnostic
information so that budding techies have a chance in hell of figuring this
out?

I know, I know, it'd probably give away some MS intellectual property if
they offerd useful error messages.

That's a seek error. In Windows, you only hear disk knocking.

Might be resolved by nuking and paving (formatting and reinstalling), but 
it's likely that the drive is dying.

1) First, thanx to ALL of you on this list for encouraging mme to persevere 
with Linuz as a non-technical desktop user - who'd a thunk it, right?

2) One of my favorite Windows error boxes (now becoming a fading memory, 
thanx again to all yooze guys) was a BLANK GREY BOX with two buttons:
'OK' and 'Cancel.' Neat, eh?

3) I also heard that there is a registry hack by which you can customize your 
own BSOD - you can select the DOS text color and background color, and even 
select blinking texts. So not only can you have an RSOD, FSOD, GSOD (for red, 
fuschia, green, etc.) but you could also blink in pairs of TACKY colors, e.g: 
a "purple text over lime green alternating with beige text on pink"-SOD.

4) A friend of mine also got his W2K computer to play a .wav file upon BSOD.

Sadly I see this behavior on my wife's new XP box with IE 5.5. I was 
checking for the latest updates for XP and then boom...The next thing I 
know the system was rebooting. Once XP recovered a little error dialog 
appears saying that Windows had a serious problem and allows some sort 
of error report to be sent to Microsoft.

So now Microsoft can now claim no more BSOD with XP. My wife's system 
has a removable IDE hard drive setup and we also have Win2K running on 
the same hardware. I find Win2K to be far more stable than XP 
professional. I did manage a couple of BSOD with Win2K when I was first 
installing it but since I upgraded the ATI video drivers Win2K has been 
quite stable.

For our firewalling and printer/file sharing Linux and Samba have been 
great for us. We've never have had any problems with any of our Linux 
boxes crashing and we have run them 24/7 since we first setup our 
network.

  Do you have a virtual terminal open where the pwd is on an nfs-mounted
directory? That would cause the "device or resource busy" message.
Alternatively, if another host is accessing some file on the machine you're
trying to shut down it may be waiting for the other box to release the link.

Before rebooting, see if anything has open files on your /net 
partition:

  lsof /net | cut -d' ' -f1 | sort -u

My hunch is that there's a process with an open file, directory, or 
library somewhere on /net that hasn't been shutdown before your system 
tries to umount /net.

I'm not sure exactly what you mean by this, but I had, for a while, one
machine with one IP running both an email server and a web server.  I was
able to figure this out by looking at the configure files for apache and
postfix.  In Apache, you setup virtual domains.  It wasn't very hard.  I had
one directory that was the document root for one domain and another for the
other.  In postfix, I set it to receive mail for both domains.  I then went
to my domain name service provider (register.com) and set the IP's for both
domains to the same IP.  Is that what you are asking?

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.31.0204191053420.1250-100000@co.ENGR.ORST.EDU>

After upgrading using apt, my installed galeon package was removed and
now (according to apt) there are no versions of it available. Any ideas what
happened?

Specifically:

I ran 'apt-get dist-upgrade', and during the upgrade process the galeon
package was removed, for no reason from what I could see. Now I have no
galeon, and when I run 'apt-get install galeon', I get this output:

|Package galeon has no available version, but exists in the database.
|This typically means that the package was mentioned in a dependency and
|never uploaded, has been obsoleted or is not available with the contents
|of sources.list
|E: Package galeon has no installation candidate

'apt-cache search galeon' yields only the following package:
|wprint - Print any charset from web browsers and HtmlDoc

My 'sources.list' has not been changed at all and it seems unlikely the
package maintainers would "obsolete" galeon, so I'm baffled why it would
be removed. I also did a search at:

http://www.debian.org/distrib/packages

I found galeon wasn't listed among the 'testing' packages, only among the
unstable ones. I can't remember whether or not my old installation
was unstable or testing, however I do know it was achieved with the
same sources.list file.

So what I'd like to know is:

1) Why did 'apt-get dist-upgrade' remove my galeon package?

2) Why is this package no longer available using the same sources.list
file?

3) How do I reinstall and get back the bookmarks I collected during the
old installation?

Any ideas would be appreciated. Also, my sources.list (format
not preserved) is appended below.

Thanks!

Actually, it seems it had better be rather short - you don't have much time
before Win's ability to play a sound -DIES- along with the rest of the
collapsing universe.

He used a short phrase from a -very- -strange- Japanese cartoon character:
"Sonomama Shi-NE nyo!" from 'DiGi Carat.' which means something like "DIE
right where you stand, you #$%#@!!!" (a better translation would be welcome.)

If anyone wants, I might be able to contact him and get the .wav file, which
I will send off-list.

Almost on-topic, Linux folx can use the .wav to their delight/torment.

Galeon is one of the packages dropped from Woody/testing for the
upcoming release.  It was mentioned in a recent Debian Weekly News and,
the last I know, it was a candidate for being dropped due to build
problems on IA64.  

It's possible to use apt 'pinning' to get it back, but you'll be
downloading from Sid/unstable.  

Here's some info on pinning and how to use it to get selected apps from
unstable.  I used this to get Galeon a week or so ago.  Keep in mind
that this runs the risk of sucking in other dependencies from unstable
with the inherent risks that entails:

machines running Linux (Debian woody and potato).  This is our first

I have read the howto, but maybe I am not being clear.

I have my domain, manymoons.net, and the name server resolves my IP to
that name.  I have just registered a new domain, and I want the same
nameserver to resolve the new domain name to the same IP as
manymoons.net

The howto does not give a clue on how to do this as far as I can tell.

Add the stanza for the second domain to /etc/named.conf, and the zone file 
to /var/named/ (if that's where you store them).

As long as the domain record points to your DNS, it works.

  There are several linux applications to communicate with your camera. I
use photopc, but there's also gphoto (or something like that) and others.
Search freshmeat, then check each one. They'll tell you what chips or
makes/models work with them.

  For the past 5 or so years I've used an Olympus D-340L with smart cards.
Photopc (running from the command line) works just fine with it. Because I
use this only for project work it's enough camera for me.

  Anyway, start with the desktop software and work back from that.

There is actually a program some guy wrote that took care of the nastiness of getting in the registry..I had it when I used winderze- gave my self a purposely GARISH color scheme ;)
Here's some, but the program I used did other stuff too, besides the bsod.

Like Richard, I also have an Olympus that works great for me.  In fact,
everyone I know with an Olympus (and mine's the lowest end of the bunch,
the 360DL) is very happy with it.  That's just a recommendation.

Personally, I like SmartMedia.  It's small and lightweight and
inexpensive.  The only advantage of CompactFlash, to me, is the ability to
buy a microdrive... but most of us don't need that kind of storage on our
cameras.  Memory Stick is proprietary and I won't touch it on principle.

I'd recommend buying a big chunk of media and an external reader when you
get the camera.

As for software, you'll find gphoto supports a very large number of the
cameras out there right now.  I love it.  While it's not intuitively
obvious at first, gphoto, when run with appropriate command line switches,
never runs the gui.  I don't use the gui and wrote a little wrapper script
that allows me to pass parameters that date and number my files as they're
pulled from the camera.

Anyway, if you have specific questions, ask around before you commit.

That's is more or less what I did, but it is not working.

What I did was copy the zone file for manymoons.net replace all the
places which said manymoons.net with the new domain name.  I then added
a section to named.conf that points to the new zone file.  However, when
I do a lookup on the new domain name it does not work.

Here are my files:

named.conf:

options {
        directory "/var/named";
};
zone "." {
        type hint;
        file "root.hints";
};
zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" {
        type master;
        file "zone/127.0.0";
};
zone "manymoons.net" {
        type master;
        file "zone/manymoons.net";
};
zone "jonsleague.org" {
        type master;
        file "zone/jonsleague.org";
};
zone "214.170.63.in-addr.arpa" {
        type master;
        file "zone/63.170.214";
};

zone/jonsleague.org:

Am I suppose to add something to zone/63.170.214 ?  This does work fine
for manymoons.net which I have had for awhile, but not the new one which
is jonsleague.org.

Is it possible that the registration is not complete yet?  I did this
early yesterday.  Whois does not show that it is mine, yet, but I
thought it should only take 24hrs.

  Almost. :-)

  I connect from my Toshiba Portege 3025CT (using a pcmcia modem card) via
the Kyocera QCP-6035 to my shell account on Aracnet. But, ... and I've not
figured this out yet, the ppp connection instantly hangs up. Could be the AT
commands initializing the phone/modem or some setup in the phone itself.

  However, it *can* be done.

I've been doing it for two weeks using a Samsung T300 (Verizon) and a
serial data cable.  I put the phone in data mode and then it's exactly
the same as using a pcmcia landline modem (though about 1/4 the
speed).  The scripts I use (e.g. for pon) are identical but for the
serial device.

Check the ability of the camera to "see" distant objects (if that's a
concern for you). I bought a cheap digital camera (Largan) a couple of
years ago. It worked ok for close (within 50 feet), well lit objects but
washed out when trying to take a picture of Mt. Hood. Since then, I've
acquired a used Polaroid PDC640. While better than the Largan, and good
enough for most of my needs, it also washes out distant objects, even
when there is good contrast between deep blue sky and snowy white
mountain top. (This inability to handle distance also applies to the
cheap cameras like the IBM "PC Camera" and another one made by Sanyo.)

I never found the Largan supported by any Linux software, but the
Polaroid is on the list in gPhoto 0.4.3 along with about 110 other
cameras.

You could take a look at one of the Sony Mavicas. The older ones just use a
floppy disk but the newer ones burn the pictures to CDRW disk. That way you
wouldn't have to worry about memory sticks or incompatibility with your OS
of choice...

If you get one with a CF card, you can simply grab a CF Card-Reader for $30 
and put that on your Linux box.  From what I've heard from the list, they 
simply show up as a drive you can mount and copy from.

So that's another option if the camera you truly desire isn't directly 
supported under Linux.

  If you're running in X then any terminal window should tell you in the

That's the Alt-F1, Alt-F2 screens. If you don't use them to switch screens,
you probably don't have one open. The most likely thing is a process running

Does anyone have any recommendations for a web-based program that would
simply log various techsupport entries, daily memos, etc., each day, and
also allow people to search through the entries?  I'm sure this would be
fairly easy to code myself, but if there's something pre-existing, then
that would save me some time.

The same goes for SmartMedia by the way.  And MOST of the readers are
supported.

I maybe didn't make it clear in my original post on the subject
today.  You really should buy three things:

A camera that has the quality you want and the price you can pay that
supports an open, fast media format like SmartMedia or Compact Flash.  I
personally prefer SmartMedia for the size, weight, and price.

A big piece of media.  Most cameras will come with one card or stick or
whatever, but it's usually of modest size.  You can get a 128MB SmartMedia
card for under $40... sometimes under $30.

An external media reader.  A SmartMedia or Compact Flash reader that will
connect to your PC and is usable by your OS.  There are many units that
read both types of media.  Not every reader is supported in Linux though.

The best part about taking this route is that it leaves your camera
choices much more open... you don't have to worry about directly
connecting the camera to the PC because you have the external reader.

However, my goal is to have a camera that I directly connect to my PC so
that the PC can control the camera for doing stop-motion animation (using
libgphoto and some custom code).  So, there are good reasons to get a
camera that has a supported direct interface.

Oh, and if you don't already have such a thing, you should REALLY get some
good rechargeable batteries for your camera.  If you're out taking shots
all day, you'll likely have the camera on and that consumes power
quickly (and if you use the LCD, which I rarely do, you'll burn batteries
like a mofo).

I HIGHLY recommend the work of Maha Electronics:
<URL: http://www.mahaenergy.com/ >

You can get "the mother of all chargers" with a pile of excellent
batteries for less than fifty bucks:
<URL: http://www.mahaenergy.com/products/powerex/digicams/mhc204f.htm >

And if you get a camera with a specialized battery, you can get their
sweet universal charger:
<URL: http://www.mahaenergy.com/products/radios/amateur/chargers/mhc777plus.htm >

I don't work for the company or anything, I'm just a big fan of their
products.

If you haven't used good, modern rechargeables, you don't know what you're
missing.

There is absolutely no reason you should be using disposable alkalines at
this point.

Thanks, Russ.  I have come to the same conclusion.

I knew I was doing it right, but I thought the registration would be
quicker.

Again, thanks for the confirmation.  I forgot that I could test it that
way.

Yah!  Tell me about it!  

Just my little anecdote, I've got an Olympus 460Z, which comes with a
serial cable (not USB).  It took close to 1 hour to download about 100
SHQ (I think) images using the serial cable (about 30 meg).  Just that
download operation would just about toast a set of 4 alkaline AA's.
So: a) get rechargables; b) get some kind of media reader; and/or c)
get a camera that has a USB (or other high-speed) interface built-in
that works with your OS of choice.  I went with b) and am working on
a).

BTW, I'd love to be able to control a digital video camera externally
to do time-lapse.  Anybody know what works?

I have a Sony Cybershot DSC-S70 with a 64MB stick.  Takes great shots, 
but is not that great for action shots. There's about a second before 
the picture is actually taken. That might be something to look for.  For 
working with Linux, I just use the USB port and mount the camera like a 
HD. works great.

Your zones look OK, did you SIGHUP (restart) the named server and try a
nslookup or dig on the nameserver itself?

It takes about 2 days to propogate a change to the DNS entries, so if you can
get the right results using nslookup from the server that you did the changes
on, then it's a matter of time.

Thanks for the heads up, Sandy.  Now would someone kindly 'spain how
they do this?  Please disabuse me of my naivete.

 Do I have to first go to Yahoo's web page for them to "track me".  Or
do they, like Big Brother, simply "have ways" to watch my every web
move?  (I'm asking this in all seriousness; no sarcasm here!)

P.S.  I have no "accounts" with any of these creeps; I don't _ever_ turn
on cookies, and rarely do I enable Java/JavaScripts;
I never enter anything personal (like credit card #s or S.S.N.s; or
do banking, shopping, or, salacious leering on the "web".

I merely visit various technical and political sites that are of
interest to web.

Nonetheless I bink around quite a bit and would be very disenchanted
if something like Yahoo were "watching" me.

*arrghh* My mbox is getting bloated with spam of late. I've been using
junkfilter[0], but it's just not cutting the mustard any more - it hasn't
been updated in nearly a year. Methinks it's time to have a gander at
SpamAssassin. I've also heard good things about Razor[1]. Does anyone have
any experience with it that they'd care to share?

You don't have to choose between them; current versions of spamassassin
(I'm running version 2.20) use Razor as one of the tools to identify spam.

Has anybody read "ia-64 linux kernel" by Mosberger and
Eranian? I'm about half way through it, and this is probably
the best Linux internals book I've seen. I does, of course,
concentrate on the ia-64 implementation, but it clearly 
separates the implementation specific aspects from the generic
Kernel information.

I've been looking for a Linux book that's on par with the
BSD book by McKusick, et al.  I don't think this one quite has
the same "coverage" but (IMO) the quality is similar.

Well, that was entirely too easy.

1: Move the RC file to /etc/init.d/
2: Run /etc/init.d/spamd start
3: Add rule to /etc/procmailrc:

Hi,

I've heard good things about this book and I plan to
get/read it.
It tries to cover Linux porting problems in general and
then how they were solved on ia64, so that it appeals
to a broader audience.

And there is follow-up info for it at

OK, so webbugs use cookies, including pre-existing cookies carried by 
Yahoo users.  So if one instructs one's browser to discard all cookies at 
the end of a session (as Opera claims to be able to do automatically) this 
should provide for privacey, right?

The interesting thing is that if you use junkbuster and are a yahoo user, 
junkbuster won't protect you from yahoo's spying, 'cause you've already 
told it to let yahoo read yer cookies!  I guess you could restrict 
cookie-reading to login.yahoo.com and mail.yahoo.com or something.

Message-ID: <001101c1e836$a46d9e90$6701a8c0@endeavor>

I vidcapped the 43min (1 hour) History Channel episode of Modern Marvels
on Video Games - remixing now into a 460mb DivX and probably a 130mb
MPEG1 - if anyone is interested - sans commercials. I'm not going to
post for my web server to dish out because of my limited bandwidth, but
on a one to one basis I could send either version out - I prefer to send
the DivX - you can always make a lower quality MPEG1 from there. Anyone
interested can email me at addmin at maneuveringspeed.com - ommit the
second "d" from "addmin"

Near as I understand, because these are broadcast, it's legal to
distribute (without charge of course) - although it surely upsets the
advertisers. :)

Because so many of the Unix/Linux community pay attention to the
progression of hardware, and certainly video games are a popular
illustration of this, I felt that many would find this interesting.  It
discusses the progression from Space Wars of MIT 1960's fame to PONG, to
the games of the 1980's up to the latest online multiplayer game
utilizing the capabilities of some of the relatively high end GPU's
we've come to love.  A definite must-see for anyone who appreciates a
historical perspective on all of this.

ReplayTV has built in goodies to reportedly automatically cut the
commercials and allow for sharing over broadband connecitons, though
I've never looked into specifics of this, as I'm not in the market for
such a machine.

TiVO I have heard runs on a Linux system - and many have hacked it and
installed larger HD's and configured it to use their broadband
connections vs. its normal dialup.

Interesting discovery for those using Opera--if you tell it not to save 
new cookies on exit it will still let folks access old cookies they have 
planted.  The cookie file ($HOME/.opera/cookies4.dat) seemed to have some 
binary (non-ascii) data in it, so I was worried about editing it by 
hand.  As an experiment I moved it to another 
directory, restarted opera (I had already set the thing to not save 
cookies 
on exit) and logged into Yahoo.  It let log in, made itself a new 
cookes4.dat file, but apparently did not store anything in it.  So for a 
mild tradeoff in convenience you can at least make things a little harder 
for webbug tracking.  Of course, I am assuming that the free version of 
Opera isn't tracking my every move when it gets its %^&$ ads.

No they are not.  Broadcast shows are legal for viewing but do not
carry re-broadcast/re-distribute rights.  To redistribute something
you taped off the air you must get permission from the broadcaster.
This goes for radio as well.  It has nothing to do with the commercials,
other than commercials also don't give rebroadcast rights either.

I =highly= recommend these batteries. I bought this combo about a
year ago from Thomas Distributing along with an extra set of batteries.
They last forever! And I only have the 1600mAh version. The current one
is 1800mAh. This charger is great, it even comes with a car adapter.

Thomas Distributing has them for $37.95.

From what I've seen about it (I have an earlier Replay --- they want
way too much for the new one):

Automatically cutting the commercials is something you can have it do
while watching, but doubt it does it when sharing.

Sharing is bandwidth limited such that the example they give is that it
takes all night to do one 2hr movie.

I don't know about the broadband part (I know Tivo has been hacked to
support Ethernet, but don't think it's been hacked to get updates over
it), but both Replay and Tivo are relatively easy to upgrade HDs with,
though it helps if you're starting with a brand new machine.  Memory
Time here in town will do it for you, and ebay has all kinds of offers
to do it as well.  It doesn't require any "hacking" to upgrade the disk
from what I recall --- it's basically a matter of dd'ing the old disk
to the new one and putting the new disk back in, if your unit only has
one to start with.  A quick search on yahoo should find the sites with
detailed instructions.

I have the Philips DSR-6000, a Tivo unit with builtin satellite receiver.
It stores the bits directly off the satellite, resulting in much higher
picture quality (which is why the Replay is relegated now to the auxiliary
TV), and while it still phones home every night, the program guide comes
over the satellite, saving phone time.

Just a detail, but one worth bringing up:  I think saying these Web bugs can
"follow you around on the Internet" is rather inaccurate.  They operate on
the Web servers and do not attach to your browser, so if you browse to a
site that has no such bugs in its pages, the bugs cannot follow you there,
and Yahoo loses track.  The transparent image has to be included in every
page which is to be tracked.  So they can't know "everything you do".

It sounds like Yahoo is trying to get as many sites as possible to include
their own "beacons" on these sites' pages, so that if you were to browse
between several of them consecutively, Yahoo would have a log of your
activity among these participating sites (and they would know you navigated
directly from site A to site B, because of the "referring URL" header that
is normally sent with each request).  Anyway, as a Web developer, I can tell
you this can be done in other ways than by using a single-pixel image, and
it's nothing new.

OK, I'm being told the caps can't be shared without infringing copyright
laws - even though it's broadcast and not-for profit distribution - so I
must rescind the offer.  

It's a good watch though - I'm sure they'll show it again, though their
schedule search engine only turns out the hits for the ones broadcast
earlier.  Also, it's likely www.historychannel.com will be happy to sell
a video/DVD of the show.

Marvels" show


I vidcapped the 43min (1 hour) History Channel episode of Modern Marvels
on Video Games - remixing now into a 460mb DivX and probably a 130mb
MPEG1 - if anyone is interested - sans commercials. I'm not going to
post for my web server to dish out because of my limited bandwidth, but
on a one to one basis I could send either version out - I prefer to send
the DivX - you can always make a lower quality MPEG1 from there. Anyone
interested can email me at addmin at maneuveringspeed.com - ommit the
second "d" from "addmin"

Near as I understand, because these are broadcast, it's legal to
distribute (without charge of course) - although it surely upsets the
advertisers. :)

Because so many of the Unix/Linux community pay attention to the
progression of hardware, and certainly video games are a popular
illustration of this, I felt that many would find this interesting.  It
discusses the progression from Space Wars of MIT 1960's fame to PONG, to
the games of the 1980's up to the latest online multiplayer game
utilizing the capabilities of some of the relatively high end GPU's
we've come to love.  A definite must-see for anyone who appreciates a
historical perspective on all of this.

ReplayTV has built in goodies to reportedly automatically cut the
commercials and allow for sharing over broadband connecitons, though
I've never looked into specifics of this, as I'm not in the market for
such a machine.

TiVO I have heard runs on a Linux system - and many have hacked it and
installed larger HD's and configured it to use their broadband
connections vs. its normal dialup.

Klamath Falls Charter Channel 3 has its banner announcements, with the

It has a virus, and a large Norton notification has popped up - though
the name of the virus is difficult to read.  The taskbar is visible,

A Critical Update Notification also just worked its way in.

I have one of the olympus cameras that has a memory card.

Under windows, you stick the memory card into what appears to be a floppy
and then put that into the floppy drive. There was software running
under windows that was able to use the device that looked like a floppy.

Do any of you know if there is anything under linux that would be able
to use the floppy shaped memory card readers?

Thanks

In a similar vein, what are the best switches to use with nmap when

Actually you use -O (capital letter o) to see the OS fingerprint.  For a
general scan of my own network I use:

nmap -v -v -sT -sU -O -oN logfile 192.168.*.*

This does an uber-verbose(-v -v) TCP connect(-sT) UDP(-sU) OS
fingerprinted(-O) scan of 192.168.*.* and logs it to a normal text
logfile(-oN logfile).

Before there were inexpensive SmartMedia card readers, I looked into that
floppy adapter.  It was wholly proprietary, last I checked.

I don't think there's support in Linux for it.

Interestingly, I theorized an identical device about ten years ago.  OK,
maybe it's only interesting to me.

  If you're running the build as you, the user, you probably don't have
write permissions to /usr/local/man. Try building as root.

  Oh. It still lookls suspiciously like a permissions problem. Except ...
why's the Makefile trying to build a source (or install it during the build)
in a man directory?

  I thought that's where the docs are placed when you run 'make install'.

ln -s /usr/local/share/man /usr/local/man

/usr/local/man is deprecated in favor of /usr/local/share/man,
but the qpopper Makefiles haven't been updated to support it.

all /usr/bin/install really does is copy a file from point a to point b.

I dutifully dragged my poor old Penguin-packed Pentium II-266 from Hillsboro to Palatine Hill today, to attend the Linux Clinic
and see what we could do for its sick, maladjusted video card.  Unfortunately, the only person I found at Riverdale School was
a librarian, who, although very friendly and helpful, and even somewhat knowledgeable about what Linux was, was not able to
help diagnose my poor video woes.  After checking and rechecking that today was indeed the third Saturday of April, and that
the time was well within the range of 1 PM - 4 PM, I turned around and went home.

What happened to the Linux Clinic today?  I didn't see any related messages on the PLUG mailing list, nor did I see any announcement
on the relevant web page.

Got'm both installed & configured - and added the macro for mutt. Piece o'

There was a message sent to the list earlier.  Very sorry you missed.
I would find the message for you, but I don't know how to search the
archives.

Now that the web interface to the lists is mailman, how does one search
the archives?

After showing up there myself, I found a cancellation announcment in the 
PLUG-announce archives.

These announcments really should be sent to the main list as well. I used to 
be subscribed to PLUG-announce but I must have been lost in the transfer to 
the new list server.

  After taking on the Texas Department of Corrections (and the City of
Austin), they're now targeting the nine largest school districts in Oregon
and the 14 largest in Washington. According to Duin, the common factor of
these districts is their istallation of linux in at least some of their
schools and other offices.

  The almost-casual mention of Paul and Eric toward the bottom of the column
(and the adoption of K12LTSP -- the acronym is probably incorrect -- in
5,000 schools) does offer hope that that number will triple or quadruple
this year.

  It will be interesting to watch and see if Microsoft ends up making
hamburger from its cash cow.

I would add "-p 1-" to that. By default, nmap only scans ports 1-1024,
plus whatever ones are included in its services file. The "-p 1-" means
scan all ports from 1 to 65535.

A message went out, but from the number of emails it looks like it would have
helped if it was sent out a number of times.

Schedule conflicts cause us to miss about one a year. Yesterday Paul Nelson
and I were asked to give a presentation at a state-wide education conference. 

As you can guess from today's Oregonian editorial, there's a lot going on
right now that requires our attention ;-)

Many expressed interest in my earlier post about the History Channel's
Modern Marvels special on the history of video games.  This site has
emulators, a "museum", and other stuff of historical interest. Many
different host platforms (DOS, Linux/Unix, Win32, MacOS) are supported
by the different emulators - whether you used to play Atari, Commodore
64, gameboy, or Odessy, or the arcade consoles.

See also www.computerhistory.org  as a good source of general computer
history.  I had no idea that hard disk drives actually date back to 1956
-  my hunch would have been mid-1970's.

First thing first- Thanks for having the clinic, guys. It's been quite a resource 
for many people, including me.

Is it possible that the message didn't make it make it out to the general list? 
I'm current and did not see an announcement either. 

If it only went out to the announce list, here's a first for having all of the 
liste that the list had begged for so long for.

On a slightly related note, is there anything I can do to help get the site up 
and the archives searchable? One of the things a searchable is good for is to 
keep the repeat questions down...

Have you set up the admin pages on CF?

Subject: [PLUG] Postfix & Mailman
Message-ID: <1019456828.10665.118.camel@fuggles>

It's been a while since I've been on the list, but I remembered there
were many Postfix users here, so I'm joining again.

I'm setting up Mailman on a debian machine, with Postfix as it's MTA. 
I've got most of it set up, I created a list, and subscribed myself to
it via the web interface.  I cannot get Postfix to accept the mail to
the listname-request@ address.  

I've tried the following:

/etc/postfix/virtuals.proto:
# Beer
beer at euglug.org         beer
beer-admin at euglug.org   beer-admin
beer-request at euglug.org beer-request
beer-owner at euglug.org   beer-owner

/etc/aliases:
## beer mailing list
## created: 19-Apr-2002 root
beer:                    "|/var/lib/mailman/mail/wrapper post beer"
beer-admin:              "|/var/lib/mailman/mail/wrapper mailowner beer"
beer-request:            "|/var/lib/mailman/mail/wrapper mailcmd beer"
beer-owner:              beer-admin

I found a website that recommends this:

You need to setup another name for the same machine, say,
lists.domain.com, and use Postfix's transport maps to use "local" for
that. Once that's done you're good to go, since local will process your
aliases just fine.

Can anyone explain how to do this?

Also, with the above setup (virtuals/aliases), sending to
beer-request at euglug.org shows this in the mail.log:

Apr 21 23:26:36 tux postfix/smtp[13443]: EB072BD:
to=<beer-request at euglug.net>, relay=mail.euglug.net[207.189.131.4],
delay=12, status=sent (250 ok 1019456438 qp 11886)

I'm not sure why it changes the .org to a .net.  My postfix server shows
it going to the correct address:

Apr 21 23:20:30 saaz postfix/smtp[32911]: 721CE1A1BD:
to=<beer-request at euglug.org>, relay=mail.euglug.org[207.189.137.45],
delay=1, status=sent (250 Ok: queued as EB072BD)

Tips, advice, links, etc are much appreciated.

Thanks,
Rob

I was *using* computers with hard disks in the mid-1970's...  In fact, I
have the platter from one of them downstairs.  It's a 26" platter from a
600MB drive on a CDC 3300 mainframe that dates to the late 50's or early
60's.  There were two spindles of 36 platters in a cabinet about
8'w x 3'd x 6'h (might have been a little higher, my memories are vague).
The head reads 6 tracks at once (makes sense since it was a 24 bit machine
that used 6bit "bytes"); you can see the little rectangles for the read
heads about 1mm apart or so in a about 3/4" square metal block.

I also have a plane of core memory from it --- 4KB about 10" square and
a half inch thick.

It was decommissioned about the time I graduated from OSU and I was working
at the computer center at the time and lucked into a few pieces.

It ran a virtual memory operating system written at OSU; my memory is
vague, it seems like it had 128K memory, but I remember user mode programs
could address 32K because the instruction set used 15bit indexing.  It
would start bogging down with around 25-30 users and played a great game
of super star trek.

This thread reminded me that I don't have pictures of this equipment
online, so I remedied that:

Pick a resolution and it will link through the pictures in sequence

Alas, I have no pictures of the actual computer this stuff came out of.

Inspired by Steve Duin's column I sent the following message to 
Senators Smith and Wyden and Representative Blumenauer.



  In the Sunday Oregonian, April 21st, columnist Steve Duin writes about
  Microsoft's marketing department threatening several Oregon School
  districts with a software audit unless they adopt a costly Microsoft
  systemwide licensing plan.  Microsoft is giving the schools 60 days to
  prove up or pay up.

  The schools are being asked to prove their innocence of copyright
  infringement on a Microsoft stipulated timetable to Microsoft stipulated
  terms.  The timetable and terms are not practical.   There is nothing to
  indicate that the employees of our school system have done anything wrong.
  The only apparent motivation for Microsoft to make this request is to
  twist the arms of the people who make the decision about adopting the
  Microsoft School Agreement.

  What can be done to combat this corporate blackmail and extortion?

  Sincerely,

  Michael Rasmussen

Mine is setup a bit different

In main.cf I point to a local file for domains (like sendmail.cw)

main.cf:mydestination=$myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, $mydomain,
/etc/postfix/domains.

domains then list the domains I accept mail for, one domain per line.


I then have a user "lists" that alias adds to:
main.cf:alias_maps = hash:/home/lists/aliases, hash:/etc/postfix/aliases


So in this all mailing lists become valid at all domains.  If I wanted
to fix that I would use virtual:

main.cf:virtual_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/virtual.postfix


And add to that
listnam at list.domain	|blah

Apologies. I sent a message out to the announce list. It used to be (I
think) that messages sent to announce were posted to both lists. That's
definitely not true now. Sorry for your wasted trip.

We definitely will be there next month, if it's any help. :)

I managed to finally get it working.  It took longer than I originally
wanted to spend on this, but I learned a helluvalot in the process (which
is really a good thing, in the big picture).  ColdFusion 5 has a Merant
MySQL driver, but I couldn't get it to work, and I found a couple of
newsgroup postings about others complaining about the same thing.  So, I
had to setup MyODBC (http://www.mysql.org/downloads/api-myodbc-2.50.html)
and I had to setup iODBC (http://www.iodbc.org).  Next, I edited the
odbc.ini file in the coldfusion directory to point to the mysql driver,
and I was up and running after configuring the DNC in the CF
Administrator.

Better the real list should be subscribed to the announcement lists. 
That would make it a one email process.

files to .php, move your domains to a *nix box, and save ZILLIONS on
licensing costs!

http://asp2php.naken.cc/home.php

We got a call from Microsoft the other day about what it's going to cost
us for their new licensing model.  As a direct result of that call,
management wants me to convert as many of our systems over to Linux as
possible.  So needless to say, I'm one busy boy.  But this isn't work to
me.  This is play.  :-)

Matt,

  If I may be so bold, let me modify your suggestion to this: contact Paul
Nelson at Riverdale School or Eric Harrison at MESD and volunteer to help
them with the K12 Linux Project.

  They're up and running (and have been for at least a couple of years now)
and are very successful. If you want to make a difference, work with them.

Excellent point!  It'd be much better for us to work together with an
existing system that's proven itself to be very effective.

Hello Linux folkz,
It's a good article about predatory practice of M$, but isn't it true
that most of the OR school districts are using Mac's rather than PC's?

My daughter is in the first grade in Barnes school, and they have some
 computer introduction classes which are being taught using Mac's
only. 
Just recently this school got rid of almost all remaining PC's.
When I asked their network engineer about this matter, he replied that
the school district got a pretty good deal with Apple. That is why
they are building primarely Mac's networks within this school
district.
On my comment that most of the industry uses rather PC's than Mac's he
just shroughed his shoulders.

Ask American engineers how they created nuclear bombs, super sonic
jets, rockets and hover crafts.
First three inventions they stole from Germans, last one from Soviets.
As well as an idea about space flights.

Subject: [PLUG] Woody install question
Message-ID: <3CC454DB.3010405@spamcop.net>

I just went through a 27 disk floppy based install of woody on a laptop. 
Aside from "bad floppy" issues, all went pretty well.

I did this twice actually. (I made a mistake on the partitioning scheme 
first time through).

The second time though I forgot to set up PCMCIA and so I have no 
networking available to me. (After the first install, I had a working 
cardmgr and ethernet connections, so I know it can be made to work.)

Now that I have the base system installed, is there any way to get back 
to the curses based part of the install that lets me set up PCMCIA?

Or do I need to choose between (learning all about PCMCIA) or 
(reinstalling for a third time)?

Yes, and at my son's school they would rather use Macs than PCs.
They know how to troubleshoot/repair Macs better.

The question is not ``if" but ``when". This has always been part of MS's
business plan. (IIRC, one observer called this process, ``devouring
your young.")

For those of you who never watched MS operate in the DOS era, there
were literally dozens of companies that wrote applications & utilities
for DOS, & later Win 3.1. Very much like the floresence of software
available on Freshmeat or SourceForge: there were some very good
items out there, & a lot of crappy software (some of which made what
MS produced look good in comparison).

And slowly, MS drove out its competition thru acquisition, co-option
or leveraging the fact they also wrote the OS all of these programs
ran on. In short, MS devoured its young: took either its competitors'
talent or its ideas & abosrbed them into MS Windows.

It's been trying to do the same thing with the Internet -- which is
the bottom line with it's .NET offering.

Gates' & Co would be at their happiest if simply everyone with a computer
sent them a blank check periodically. That way they could continue to
meet their expected unsustainable growth rates -- which they can't do
with their stagnant chokehold on the SOHO PC market, their dubious
plurality of the server market, & negligible shares of the handheld &
gaming platforms.

The linked-to comment says:

 "This would be a perfect time for some large linux distribution
 company, or a consulting company to step in and donate time to help
 them migrate entirely to Linux. It would have to be a disruptive
 migration because of the audit in 60 days threat but they could
 do it."

And considering the size of the unemployed SIG and that volunteer
time would probably be tax-deductible (anyone know?), this would
be a use of the group's human resources.  At least, that's
fair observation from outside.

So now the question is for Paul, Eric, et al is what can be done and
what needs to be done?  Is a wholesale exorcism of Microsoft software
(not just the PCs, but the Macs too--remember, they're likely running
Office) feasible?  What can we do to organize our ranks to do this?
This could be a big score for free software and our local community,
but we'd have to be careful to not bungle it.

Volunteer time is NOT tax deductible. But mileage for driving to and from
said volunteering location is, with the correct documentation. Get one of
those permanent bound mileage books and track your mileage.

  I may well be wrong, but I believe this article has it wrong: the Portland
School District is *not* a MESD participant. It is the former, not the

Eric will correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe he told me it wasn't
but now it is.  I seem to recall him lamenting the difficulties of
taking over the PSD some meetings ago.

27?  Harsh.

Assuming you have a broadband connection, woody (and most other debian 
installs) has a netinst floppy set, some five or six disks, which installs 
cardmgr and such and then apt-get's the rest of the distro from some Remote 
Source.  Maybe not as fast as floppies(?) but far easier.  And upgradable! 

Check around the images/ directory for netinst, or similarly named.  I got, 
long, ago, a potatoe install working this way on a 3com pcmcia card.

My folks tried to get me into stamps when I was very young, but it just
never clicked with me.

However, if you get any comic books from Australia, please let me know!

That's 27 working disks. There we also about 21 that failed (using old

Hmmm... nothing there similarly named in either woody or potato.

But I really don't want to resort to another install.

Is there a way to get into the install process and just do the step(s) I 
left out?

I'm not sure it is exactly what you need but you can do the base config
again bu running

/usr/sbin/base-config

You could also find the appropriate .deb files on the floppies, and run dpkg 
to install them manually.

However I would hazard a guess that the base-config method would definitely be 
the easiest route.

It depends on the district. Beaverton has a large installed base of Macs.
Hillsboro, (probably  because of Intel's presence) uses WinTel systems.

So what exactly is involved in one of these audits?  Is a school
going to have to examine each of its systems, write down all
software running on it, and report all the info back to
myoursoft?

Has any organization considered challenging MS on this?  Perhaps
Sun can ante up the cash to support a challenge.  It all seems
so  unreasonable, even if it WAS in the origial contract.

Also, how feasible would it be for a school district to wean
itself of microsoft sfuff?

The software-audit technique is (so far) perfectly legal and has been 
used elsewhere to great effect:

  http://www.linuxworld.com/linuxworld/lw-2000-12/lw-12-vcontrol_2.html

My take is that it's ultimately a *good* thing that Microsoft enforces 
its licenses and calls out the dogs for this sort of audit. 
Organizations will begin to realize how expensive proprietary software 
can be when they can no longer

1. upgrade from Windows 9x to some version of NT (NT 4, 2000, XP) on
   the sly,

2. copy MS Office willy-nilly onto computer after computer,

3. install MS Office at home using the CDs at work.

Microsoft gained market share, in part, because it turned a blind eye 
to piracy and let everyone use its software, legitimate or not. Now 
it's time to pay the piper -- so we'll see how many people are still 
willing to dance...

  A manager for the Texas Dept. of Corrections asked why they had to provide
licenses for every copy of software when Microsoft should have records in
their database(s) from purchases and registrations. Why, he asked, doesn't
Microsoft have to prove that we are *not* in compliance? The answer,
apparently, is that the DMCA says that you're guilty until (and unless) you
can prove your innocence.

  What the school districts must do, according to Duin's column in
yesterday's paper, is provide receipts and the proof-of-purchase thingie on
the outer carton for every copy of every application that's installed on
every computer in the District. Even if they could do this, the cost would
be extremely high.

  Unfortunate. Highly unfortunate. Just think how much more money PSD is
going to request from us because of this. Heck, they may not be able to
afford to hire a superintendent at all!

  They may have picked up this business model from Aston-Tate. Remember
them? The folks that brought us dBASE-II on CP/M boxes before MS-DOS became
popular? Never copy protected. Pirated like crazy. Many consultants learned
how to write database applications on an illegal copy of dBASE.

  When their clients needed a database application, the consultant used what
he knew and purchased the appropriate number of licenses for the business.
Made them the database standard in the microcomputer world for quite a few
years.

You can opt to have M$ do the audit themselves but, you then not only 
have to pay for any non-complience they find, you also have to pay M$ 
for the time they spent on the audit, if you are out of compliance.  My 
 guess would be that they will test every machine in your building until 
they find enough to make you wish you had chose their school agreement. 
 As far as the software the one-sheet I saw basically wants any M$ OS 
and Office Products and gives you a Other category that is supposed to 
cover all other M$ products.

Until they did what killed my association with them.  The release of dBase IV
was way late and didn't have promised features. Features which a project I
was doing at the time depended on.  That bungle opened the door for many of
their competitors.

Well, I haven't read the up2date docs, but I "presume" that it will
keep my online systems current. The problem is that I only have 1
online system, and it's my laptop, which I carry to a friends house
twice a week to get access to the net; and the rest of the time it is
attached to my home network of 4 more systems, all running different
collections of tools, but all running rh7.2

So, it makes more sense to me to just get _all_ the updates, and then
update the home systems 'offline'.

However, if you have different data...... I can be taught!

I would pay to volunteer.  I have two kids in PSD and it makes me really
angry that the schools can't get the money together to get decent teaching
materials, but M$ expects them to pay hundreds of thousands more for a piece
of fricken software.  Stupid.  I looked at the K12LTSP site and found no
information regarding volunteering.  It looks like several people on here
are interested so let's get some K12LTSP representation on here to help us
out.

Going off some *really fuzzy* memories, but this at least used to be
legit. From what I remember long ago when I had to deal with proper
license accounting was that Microsoft allowed software to be installed
on a user's home and work computers, but only if you weren't using any
sort of automated license tracking software. If you were then your users
couldn't take software home.

I recently started a little side business (consulting) and need to

Can anyone recommend someone good?

That's the important part, "fricken software". Even though I love 
computing and profit from it, at the end of the day class size, teacher 
quality, materials are far more important to real-world skills than being 
knowledgable about Windows. Especially since so many kids have computers 
at home. Why not Linux? It seems like a no-brainer. If it comes down to 
teachers or books or MS Word, I'm sorry, but OpenOffice will have to do.

  My recollection was that this was permitted because you could not be using
both copies at the same time. You were either at work or at home.
Functionally, you were using the same copy but at different places at
different times.

One thing that I'm surprised hasn't been mentioned is trying to put pressure
directly on M$ to back off.  I don't know how much of an effect this will
have, but it's worth a shot.  Amongst other things, I would recommend being
polite (I was *very* diplomatic in expressing my opinion of their company; I
lied :)  I would also suggest disabling any email .sigs that might suggest
an anti-M$ bias.

Also, if you're concerned that your company might get into trouble, maybe
you don't want to send it from a work account.

Below is a copy of the email that I sent.  I wrote, amongst other things,
that school IT staffs are underpaid and under-staffed.  This may not be
accurate (but I think it was a good guess).  However, I'll stand by that as
I am assuming that no IT staffer at a school would object to more money or a
larger support group :)

--
To whom it may concern,

A recent article in the Oregonian
(http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/steve_duin/index.ssf?/xml/story.ss
f/html_standard.xsl?/base/all_wire_stories/101386428029222529.xml) has
certainly left me with a bad taste in my mouth regarding your company.
While I have certainly had reservations about your company in the past, I
have also recognized that you are doing what any company tries to do:  be
the best that you can be.  Now, however, my opinion has certainly changed.

By demanding that Portland public schools audit 25,000 computers in 60 days
and turn over the results to you, you have effectively taken a cash-strapped
school district and held them over a barrel.  Either they fail to comply
with the audit (there does not appear to be any reasonable way they can
succeed) or they agree to your Microsoft School Agreement, which will cost
them half a million dollars.

As you must know, cash-strapped schools are in a poor position to ensure
that students haven't installed unlicensed software on their machines.  The
teachers (some of my friends are teachers) spend so much time working on
lesson plans, teaching class, and grading papers that there is no reasonable
way to expect them to monitor all of the computers.

Of course, the IT staff at schools is underpaid and short-staffed, so they
also don't have the time or skills to police the students.  Further, imagine
the poor admin who's just been hired and is trying to get the school's
computers into shape.  He or she probably has no way to collect all of the
receipts or "proof of license" for every software product that the school
uses.  With our cash-strapped school systems being continuously hammered for
the apparently lower quality of education, it's sad to see your company
drive another nail into the coffin.

Please reconsider the timing of this, or give the schools a more realistic
time frame.  With only 60 days to respond, the schools will be forced to
audit over 400 computers a day.  There is simply no reasonable way they can
do that.

Thank you for your consideration of this matter.

Curtis Poe

I think that if you run up2date on your one machine it will save all the 
rpms it downloads in /var/spool/up2date, even after it installs them.  Of 
course to be sure you could copy all the rpms from var/spool/up2date to 
another directory before you let up2date do the install (come to think of 
it, there might be an up2date setting that controls whether the things 
get deleted).  The reason I'm 
not sure the rpms are saved after install is that all I have in its 
directory is a bunch of .hdr files (whatever they are), but I think I went 
and cleaned out the rpms myself to save space.  Anyway, make sure you copy 
the rpms somewhere else, then plug the laptop back into yer network and 
ftp or scp the things over to your other machines.

I am, of course, also willing to volunteer for this kind of project.

I think that if had a preliminary meeting... even before we talk to
officials, we can set up an organization and attack the problem
semi-professionally (i.e. project management, timelines, specifications
and so on).

I would REALLY like to be in on any initial meetings with the schools on
this topic.  I promise I clean up real good and know when not to swear or
pick my nose.

But, I guess we'll all just wait to hear back from Eric.

Oh... and I guess this is an alright time to make an initial plea for
interest in a new endeavor.  I'm thinking of holding a little meeting
(either just at my place or at a restaurant with a meeting room, if
interest is high) to talk about some business ideas.  I'd like to start
with just a general discussion, but essentially the organization would be
a development and implementation firm for business-specific applications.  
Send me an email if you're interested in the discussion.

I just signed up to this mailing list as a result of the slashdot 
article earlier today.

Someone should talk with the school officals before there's much talk 
about project plans and such. This way you can find out what the schools 
really need and want from volunteers.

It may also be a good idea to get a feel for the number of volunteers 
before going to the school officials so they know what type of support 
they have and can make a better decision as to what they want to do with 
that support.

It's also very possible that Microsoft will back down on their audit 
deadline after they feel the support that has been offered to the school 
districts effected. Perhaps some manager at Microsoft will clobber the 
guy who made this demand to get his quarterly sale quota. (just 
speculation here of course).

And then there is the unfortunate thing that happens when enthusiasm 
meets the harsh cold reality of life, and time, and there may not be as 
many volunteers as was at first thought.

But where do I sign up? :)

Does it download _all_ the rpms, or just the ones that this laptop
needs. This laptop only has a 3G drive, so I don't have the same tools
here that I have on the systems at home. My concern is that it won't
download the 'other' rpms that I'd need for those systems.

Hello Folks, 

I just want to say thanks to all the offers of help from PLUG members.
As soon as I saw Steve Duin's article had been /.'ed I told him to
expect some email. He was swamped! Yea!!! 

I think that Microsoft and their own licensing antics may be our best
advocate for the use of free software. It certainly is making schools
take a long hard look. 

K12Linux would have never started were it not for PLUG and a few members
who met with us and helped get the ball rolling. It just goes to show
that the power of the Internet is its ability to bring people together
to get stuff done. That's why the open source development model works so
well. 

People have asked what they can do to help. I know the schools are
already working to comply with the audit requirements. Schools need to
be legal and they need to model ethical behavior for students. They
should have licenses for 100% of the MS software they use. 

I think that now though we'll start to see another type of good ethical
behavior in schools. It will be an increased use of free software in an
effort to be fiscally responsible. K12LTSP started just last July. We've
been very successful. In less than one year we show distribution to over
5000 schools. 

So what is the next step? I see two things that need to happen: 

1) The user group support model that worked so well here in Portland
needs to be replicated all over the country. 

Our LUG has install clinics, an active mailing list and monthly
meetings. We've got to find a way to reach out to other LUGs and
encourage them to do the same. As good as this is though, it still
leaves us as a grass roots movement... see point 2...

2) We need to bring some big name vendors along with us to offer
turnkey, supported open source solutions to schools. Schools wanting to
install a Linux lab right now have to build their own machines. They
don't have anyone to call for help and there are no warranties. 

My emails to IBM go unanswered. Intel is supportive but frankly, I just
don't think they or anyone else wants to tangle with the 800 pound
gorilla that's in the way. How can we get vendors to work with us to
provide Linux based solutions for schools, businesses and public
agencies?  Answer that question if you want to help.  

One off the wall idea I had was a national software freedom day on July
4th. We could get LUGs all over the country to work with schools to
provide demonstrations and hand out CD's. When we did this at our school
last July 4th for the release of K12LTSP I heard a lot of "no one will
show up on the 4th! You're crazy!" but we DID have a lab full of people
and we had a great time. It's just an idea... Let's put our heads
together and see what happens.

One more thought... We just had a letter from www.linuxfund.org saying
that they are going to support K12LTSP. It would be great if we were all
carrying visa cards with penguins on them. This is an easy way to
contribute to open source projects and it costs us nothing.

I look forward to hearing your suggestions and again, thanks to all of
the PLUG users for your help over the years. You are a great bunch of
folks!

;-) Paul

The issue of installing only properly licensed software came up while
I was working at Computer Bits, so I spent some time reading the fine
print. At the time, WordPerfect (7, then 8) did allow a dual
installation, providing you only ran one copy at a time. MS Office 95 
did not allow it. I haven't read the WordPerfect or Office licenses 
since then, so my knowledge is definitely outdated.

Perhaps a massive investment in Myoursoft stock by the pension fund clouds
their thinking somewhere in the chain of command at the ESD?

Or is their any stock in M$ owned by the Teachers Retirement Pension Funds
in Oregon as they are in other states?  Last time I checked the CA Teachers
were 50%  M$ stock for their Pension.

I can see where they might think being up to their neck in M$ fees helps
their pension fund value somehow,  but at a cost that is way too high in the
long run.

Anyone know who decides which software the schools use?  Why not ask them
directly if possible,  why they spend any money at M$?  Are they accountable
to anyone?  To the Taxpayers?

M$ software is kind of like a boat,  which we know is nothing but a hole in
the water that you must constantly dump ( Taxpayers ) money into.

Portland Public Schools *is* a MESD participant. We support the eight school
districts in the county. The other one of the districts I support that is
being audited is Gresham-Barlow.

But you are right, it is PPS & Gresham-Barlow who are being audited, not MESD.
MESD, as a service provider to PPS & Gresham-Barlow, is helping them with
the audit in any way we can.

no action.

  Does anyone here have any insight into why they haven't taken action

something similar may be occurring at uunet.

No I believe what he is saying is the people who make IT decisions are a 
completely seperate group from those that make the retirement fund decisions. 
 Each motivated by their own needs, private agenda's, requirements, 
assessments and culture.

I very much doubt that the two influence each other in any way.

Well, your knowledge is more current than the information I posted
above. :-) At the point and time I was involved with licensing issues,
win95 was not yet officially released. It's also possible that I could
be confusing the Microsoft license with the license of the Lotus Office
Suite (I've also worked really hard to recycle the brain cells from that
experience :-) ).

Subject: [PLUG] How to read outputs from sensors?
Message-ID: <02042221462400.28659@gate>

Hello Linux folkz,
I've downloaded and installed both parts of sensors package.

i2c-2.6.3.tar.gz
lm_sensors-2.6.3.tar.gz

Now my question is how I can read my MB / CPU temps, voltages and speed of 
the fans?
The sensors documentation seems to be a little bit controversial.
Could somebody please give me an idea or point to the source of information.
Many thanks in advance.
Alex

Add me to the list of people willing to help. (I live a couple of blocks from 
Cleveand High School.)

Here are my thoughts on the issue (for what little it is worth): 

[This may get modified to an editorial for the oregonian or similar 
publication after polishing and editorial modifications, so bear with the 
obvious bits.]

The school district(s) need to look at a plan to eliminate all Microsoft 
software from their schools and offices.

All of it.

The reason for this is pretty plain.  Microsoft's current "complience" 
campaign is no more than extortion.  (I was going to say "petty extortion, 
but a half a million dollars is not "petty".)  Microsoft knows that the 
school cannot conduct an audit in the time given.  They know that the 
district is in too deep with their software to give it up and will have to 
give in to their demands or pay an even bigger "penalty".  This is not the 
actions of a legitimate business, this is the strong-arm tactics of a mob 
boss or a drug kingpin.

It is extortion, plain and simple.

The Vikings used to have similar scam.  They would go from town to town along 
the British coast or anywhere else where there were people who could not 
defend themselves and make a bargain with the town.  "Pay us X amount in gold 
or we sack your town."  Such payments were called "danegeld". 

There was also another saying... "Once you pay Danegeld, you never get rid of 
the Dane."

If the school districts pay off the Microsoft horde, what happens when 
Microsoft has another bad quarter?  Are they going to fall prey to another 
such "complience audit"?  Will there be another way that they will come in 
and suck up more revenue from the cash strapped schools?

You know damn well they will!

Next they will want extra licence fees for each printer.  Maybe they will up 
it to a per student fee, instead of a per machine.  There will always be 
something more to pay for.  They fees will go up and up because they know 
that the school won't run without their software.

Unless they get out of the game now, while they still can.

The excuses are pretty standard.  

"They don't want to have to learn new software"  Hmmm...  Educators who are 
unwilling to learn new things.  Maybe they should look up the definition of 
"irony" at this point.

"It is too much work to change everything over."  Well, yes.  it is also about 
as much work to conduct the audit and it will cost less in the long run. The 
software applications already exist. 

"Linux is too hard."  And Windows is not?  Actually there are versions that 
are pretty easy to maintain.  The K12TSP is one example.  Mandrake is another 
option.  Actually, Linux has been getting easier and easier to run and 
Microsoft has been getting harder and harder to keep running. There are 
community resources that will help with training.

The question is not just how much it will cost now, but how much you will keep 
paying over and over again years on down the road.

[This was probably preaching to the chior, but I am wanting to et a basic 
layout fornewspaper rant later.  Send me comments pro and con and I will see 
if I can get something useful hacked out of it.]

That sounds like a good opportunity for a consulting business. Charge a 
pittance compared to what Microsoft wants to charge for pure support on a 
free, open-source OS.

Doesn't this seem like a no-brainer for a Red Hat, IBM, or Sun? The more 
kids who graduate not believing (Windows = Computer) the better chance 
they all have of success.

This is almost too funny to be true, but apparently it is.  This guy is 
a) riled that PBS has a program on evolution,
b) upset that apple uses, well, an apple as its symbol (Eve and the fruit, 
remember?),
c) Upset that OSX is based on an open-source project (godless 
communism) named after Darwin,
d) further upset that Apple adopted the cute little demon from BSD (which 
he calls an 'obsolete operating system'),
e) and finally annoyed by all the daemons running in the background, and 
people typing in 'chmod 666 [filename].'

Oh and apparently the first mac was priced at $666 (I didn't follow the 
link to confirm this--feel free to look up the true fac's).

Little does he know that his site is running on a godless commie operating 
system called Linuxm, using a godless commie webserver called Apache 
(named, of course, after a bunch of heathen).

Make me proud to be a godless commie.

The issue is per-seat licenses versus per-user licenses.

Subject: [lug] MSA Audit; Corvallis School Assistance
Precedence: bulk

Apparently, Microsoft has demanded a complete licensing audit from
Oregon school districts. If the schools do not complete the audit
requirements within 60 days, they must adopt a license
under which they would be charged for every computer at the school
(including iMacs, Linux pcs, etc) instead of each computer running
Microsoft software. For example, the Portland School districts must
account for over 25,000 computers within the time period. (More info
below from Michael Rasmussen, see the editoral by Steve Duin.)

In response, school district coordinators such as Eric Harrison have
developed initiatives to replace generic commericial software
with free, open-source alternatives. Such measures can sometimes fail,
however, due to a lack of available technical knowhow and guidance at the
school.

It seems we (linux users) could assist public schools by letting them
know we can help in efforts to try Open Source desktop software;
through group lists like this, email, and in person. By assuring them of
help for linux and its wide use, we can dispel some of the fear and
uncertainty school leaders might face in pursuing these otherwise
attractive solutions.


I found the following names of people from school websites we could
contact. If anyone knows of other people (computing admins, directors)
that information would help. It seems we could do this personally or, with
sufficient agreement, prepare a response from us as a group
(mid-willamette valley LUG). How does this sound? --Tyler

 "In the Sunday Oregonian, April 21st, columnist Steve Duin writes about
  Microsoft's marketing department threatening several Oregon School
  districts with a software audit unless they adopt a costly Microsoft
  systemwide licensing plan.  Microsoft is giving the schools 60 days to
  prove up or pay up.

  The schools are being asked to prove their innocence of copyright
  infringement on a Microsoft stipulated timetable to Microsoft stipulated
  terms.  The timetable and terms are not practical.   There is nothing to
  indicate that the employees of our school system have done anything wrong.
  The only apparent motivation for Microsoft to make this request is to
  twist the arms of the people who make the decision about adopting the
  Microsoft School Agreement." - Michael Rasmussen

First of all. you need to load the right modules for your sensors.
Start by running sensors-detect, it may probe your hardware correctly if
you are lucky. If not, you may have to search the lm-sensors discussion
list (there is a link from lm-sensors web page) or search newsgroups with
Google.
After you get the right modules and get them to load on startup (usually
you have to load them manually, they won't autoload, so write a script to
start them as a service), "sensors" command should show you something.
Then it's a matter of tweaking the formulas in sensors.conf for your
motherboard (unless someone has already done it and it's included in the
sample config file on the mailing list). If you have to tweak it, you will
need reference temperature and fan readings, you can get them from BIOS.

SSL is Not a Magic Bullet
By Brian Hatch

Anyone who has filed out their personal or billing info online has 
likely entered it via a 'secure Web server'. You can tell the 
transmission is secure because the URL reads 'https://...' instead of 
http. SSL (http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/SSL.html), the secure 
sockets layer protocol, is the 'S' in HTTPS. [1]

The beauty of SSL is its integration into most Web browsers, where it 
invisibly encrypts Web transactions and prevents any attacker in the 
middle from seeing the data you send and receive. Attackers can see 
that you are making a connection to the remote system, but not the 
transmission's content itself. SSL even authenticates the server, so 
when you hit https://microsoft.com/jobs/stop_bugging_me.asp, you know 
that you are talking to the Evil Empire and no cracker could be 
positioned between you, intercepting or modifying the packets.

Unfortunately, many folks look at SSL as the magic answer to all 
security concerns. Every three months or so, I find myself giving a 
discussion about what SSL does and does not protect.

SSL guarantees:

    * The server you want to contact is the one you got. SSL verifies 
      that the server's certificate (similar to a public key) is signed 
      by a trusted entity from your browser's preinstalled list of 
      companies that it trusts. [1]
    * No attacker can read or modify the data being transmitted between 
      you and the Web server.

That's it, and nothing else. In fact, if you got a warning about a 
certificate problem and you blindly click, 'Ok, ok, sure, whatever, 
yeah', then you aren't even guaranteed the above two points.

Now let's see a partial list of things that SSL does not protect you 
from:

    * Host Insecurities -- People frequently think that having an SSL-
      enabled Web server, often just called a 'secure Web server,' 
      secures the machine itself. No, you still need to keep patches up 
      to date, harden your system, turn off unneeded services, and 
      check your logs.
    * Stupid Programming (CGI/mod_perl/etc) Mistakes -- The 
      transmission may be encrypted but an attacker can still connect 
      and try to break your buggy software. And since it's encrypted, 
      your IDS systems can't even warn you about it.
    * Is the Web page Run by the People You Think? -- The SSL 
      certificate is based on the host name, nothing else. I can get a 
      certificate for 'buildinglinuxvpns.net' since I own it. However, 
      I can whip up the content that looks just like your bank, 
      complete with forms for account numbers and passwords, and host 
      it there. I could even have it relay the info to your bank such 
      that it shows you everything exactly as it should be, but saving 
      a decrypted copy the whole while.
      You're not likely to fall for this trick with such a blatantly 
      unrelated URL, but what if an attacker 
      registered 'www.my_banks.com' when the real URL was supposed to 
      be 'www.my_bank.com'? An easy typo, and you may never notice the 
      difference.
    * Backend cleartext storage and transmissions. Many Web servers get 
      and store data using outside sources, such as databases or flat 
      files. You may be entering your credit card on a secure channel, 
      but they may still be taking it and emailing it in the clear to 
      their main office for processing.

You may feel that many of the things I listed above are obvious. For 
that matter, you may feel offended that I'd even mention some of them. 
However I find that people are often confused, and don't realize where 
the security of SSL begins and ends. This usually results in hours of 
bickering about security needs before we figure out exactly where the 
faulty assumptions came from.

NOTES
[1] TLS, the Transport Layer Security protocol, is the latest/greatest 
    version of SSL, but it's not as widely available in browsers so 
    most folks still just say SSL. However SSL/TLS is more accurate.

[2] Now how much you trust the folks who wrote your browser is a 
    different question all together.

Hello,

My question is how and where I can read actual readings from the sensors?
Is there any utility or I should read them from /proc/bus/?
This is my initial and the only question.
Thank you.

I wonder if everyone sees the one consequence of this.  DOS made M$ because
back then, to call a computer an "IBM Compatable", it had to have MS-DOS.
Legally, you had to buy a license or you couldn't use that term.  Given that
you had to pay for the license, you might as well use DOS rather than pay
for another license from another company, if you were a manufacturer.  The
new license for schools does the same thing.  If they have to pay for a
license for every computer, why buy a MAC or Linux machince?  You have payed
for the license already for Windows.  Maybe I am stating the obvious...

The current EULA for Microsoft _desktop application_ software states that
the user can install one copy on their main desktop machine and, if they use
a portable laptop machine, may install a copy there as well. This is NOT the
case for their OS which is specifically designated to a particular machine.

I interrupt this list to bring you the following announcement from the 
SAO.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
"Change the Game with Linux"
The Software Association of Oregon (SAO), ISSA and SIM would like to
invite you to attend a CIO/IT Leaders Forum on Linux and Open Source
to discuss, "If you build your house on Linux, is it built on rock or
sand?"  We invite all CIOs, CTOs, IT and IS Managers to Change the
Game with Linux.

And if you have already registered for this event, we look forward to
seeing you there!

date: April 30, 2001
place: Oregon Zoo
time: 5:30 - 8:00 pm
cost: $25 to all SAO, ISSA and SIM members, $40 for nonmembers. 
(includes dinner) 

PLEASE REGISTER FOR THIS EVENT AT www.sao.org

Come hear why Linux is ready for the Enterprise now and where it is
going next.

Dr. Daniel Frye, Director of the IBM Linux Technology Center, will
discuss the IBM Linux strategy, why Linux is ready for the Enterprise
now, and why IBM spent a billion dollars on Linux last year.   Tim
Witham, Director of the Open Source Development Laboratory, will
discuss where Linux, the fastest maturing operating system in history,
is going next. And Amar Kamadoli of Axian will discuss why it's hot,
and pros and cons of usage.


Speakers:


Dan Frye, IBM Linux Technology Center

Daniel D. Frye, Director, Linux Technology Center (LTC) is responsible
for overseeing IBM's Linux technical strategy and IBM's participation
in the open source Linux development community.


Amar Kamadoli, Consulting Engineer & Instructor, Axian

Amar is a software developer specializing in Linux/Samba
administration and configuration in a Windows/Linux environment, as
well as a certified instructor for the Red Hat Certified Engineer
Course and the Linux Use and Administration and Linux Programming
Essentials courses. 


Tim Witham, Director, Open Source Development Lab

Tim Witham has been a user of Linux since 1995 and has been advocating
Linux and open source issues inside of corporations for the last 5
years. In the last 2 years he has been the Linux program manager in

registration, you will be sent an invoice. 


THIS EVENT IS IN THE ZOO.  PLEASE ENTER THE ZOO CATERING OFFICES ON
THE RIGHT INSIDE THE GATE AND GO DOWNSTAIRS.


This event is open to IT Professionals only.


 The SAO Board of Directors feels strongly that there is strategic
value in getting the CIOs, IT Managers and MIS Specialists of Oregon's
companies together to build a stronger network in order to solve
common problems more effectively.  Your input is very important. 
While we are aware of other networking opportunities that you may be
involved in, we believe that the SAO is in the unique position to
provide an effective forum for idea sharing and mutual problem solving

So if you have two PCs in your house, and wanted to upgrade to XP, you have to
buy two copies for a total of, what, $225??

Man, I'm glad I made the switch to Linux....

Don't you realize that this is customer service?  This is something
that Microsoft generously offers to make life easier for the customer?

MS to Customer: Don't worry about spending all the time and resources
to track which computer has what installed.  Just pay us a flat fee
for every CPU and you'll save yourself the tedium of tracking 
what software licence goes with what computer.  You have better things
to do than track licencing, right?  So just pay us a fee for each 
computer and be rid of that dreadful headache.  Why, you'll probably
save money in the long run anyway.

What a coincidence - I've been trying different versions of wine
(Linux "windoze emulation"), hoping to find an "out of the box"
solution to the last major problem with my desktop server
project.  I came across Codeweaver's Crossover Office a couple of
days ago.  

I've been "leveraging" the development of my desktop server.  As
each generation has become stable, I've moved my personal desktop
onto the new server for "run testing".  I then use the hardware
I've just "vacated" for developing a CD capable of building a
replica of the mostly hand built system I'm using.  

I'd worked out all but one of the "obvious" major problems in
integrating all of the desktop server's various functions and
services, but was going around in circles trying to figure out
the cause of the last one.  My last problem (which I finally
solved this evening) was that every time I tried to print from my
windoze inspection products running in wine, the printer would
demand A4 size paper instead of letter size.  Unable to get the
printer to cooperate, my software would try to work with what was
available - formating its output to A4 dimensions.  On one level,
this "drop back and punt" approach might have worked if I
actually had A4 paper on hand, but it would still be an
unacceptable commercial limitation for my customers.  

I started out searching the online archives of various newsgroups
and tech support discussion groups, as well as checking the usual
freshmeat.net and on/off-line documentation resources.  I
couldn't find a single reference to anyone experiencing a similar
problem.  The  unintended consequences of "excessive
individualism" can be such a pain at times like these...

My desktop server project is built on a RH 7.2 Raid-1/Ext3 base,
but among other things I replace the 2.4.7-10 kernel with a
specially patched and configured 2.4.9-13 kernel that supports
ltsp and IP6/IPSec, replace lpd with cups for printing, and
replace the bundled RH version of wine with a modified later
version based on source code downloaded from wine.org.  Printing
from local Linux and dosemu apps, as well as running as a network
printer server for both windoze and Linux clients over samba,
tftp, and nfs, all worked fine.  

After endless experimenting, I'd confirmed (at least to my own
satisfaction) that every possible configuration setting in all of
the various involved systems/layers was set to "letter" size
paper, and no untried "conventional" solutions remained.  I
looked at Crossover office, and the $50-some cost is probably a
reasonable price for someone who needs to run microsoft office -
it's unlikely that ms office will ever run in open source wine. 
But I've had problems with Codeweaver's version of wine in the
past, and was unable to get their latest version to print at all
- either in a "plain vanilla" RH/lpd install, or in one of my
much modified desktop servers using cups.  I was concerned that
Crossover office wouldn't solve my apparently unique wine
printing problem.  

IFRC, Caldera uses cups.  Are you having any problems printing
from Crossover office - especially with paper size?  I'm still
interested in possibly offering Crossover office as an "add-on"
option on my desktop server project for those who have to
continue using ms office.  (I've already "fixed" all of my
windoze products to be compatible with open source wine until I
can port them to native linux apps.)  

FWIW, my wine printing problem resulted from the use of a windoze
API call by the PDC Prolog library to set/determine the paper
size, that is still "stubbed out" in wine.  After a great deal of
searching and study, I finally found the two ".c" files buried
deep in the wine source tree where the "stubbed" missing API code
was defaulting to A4 paper size.  After editing/kludging the
source code and recompiling wine yet again (compiling wine seems
to take about as long as recompiling the linux kernel), my
windoze/wine inspection products now print perfectly - at least
on the HP laser and inkjet printers I've got handy!

If you're up and running, there is no need to reinstall.  I think what
you are after can be accomplished by just changing your
/etc/apt/sources.list file.  Comment out the references to disks, and
add references to http: and/or ftp: sources, these work for me; if you
don't want to run the unstable version, change sid to woody everywhere
(I recommend this, updates can be a PITA when using sid).

deb ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/ sid main non-free contrib

deb-src ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/ sid main non-free contrib

deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US sid/non-US main contrib
non-free

deb-src http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US sid/non-US main contrib
non-free

deb ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/linux/devel/lang/java/blackdown.org/debian
woody non-free

After these have been added, run dselect, or aptitude, update the list
of packages, select any new packages that you want, and then initiate
the install.  I know that apt-get or dpkg can do the same (they use the
same sources.list), I just don't remember the commands.

I think it's time to revive the old PLUG-edu discussion list. It's been 
around a long time but not used much lately. I think Microsoft has just 
given us a very good use for it. Subscribe at:

   https://lists.pdxlinux.org/mailman/listinfo/plug-edu

The first time PLUG-edu got a lot of use one of the results was the
the K-12 Linux project which you can find here:

   http://www.riverdale.k12.or.us/linux/

This is probably one of the things that got MS sniffing around here in 
the first place. The question now is, who's going to learn the lesson
from out of this episode? Portland Schools for experimenting with Linux 
and attracting the attetion of MS, or MS for obnoxious behavior? 
Personally, I'd like to go for the latter. PLUG-edu anyone?

Block them at your firewall or mail server. You don't need to put up
with this. You'll only be blocking the people that use uunet.net as
their mail server. You won't be blocking people that run their own mail
servers. I just started blocking rr.com. Screw em.

Well, I can answer _part_ of your question.  You need pop (or imap) if you 
want to retrieve the mail received by you server from another machine.  
I.e., if your mail server is mail.josh.com and you're on comp.josh.com and 
want to get your mail, you need a pop server on mail.josh.com.  But, if 
you are on the machine running the mail server, you oughta be able to get 
it from your local spool file ( probably /var/spool/mail/josh if qmail is 
set up like sendmail) with your favorite mail user agent (pine, kmail, 
pronto, elm, etc).  I use imap2000 as my pop server (it does both pop3 and imap).

Procmail is used for filtering and moving messages around.  I don't 
think you need it, unless you're running pine or somesuch on your 
mailserver and want to filter messages or move them to a different 
directory.   

The other question is, if you send messages to your mail server do they 
bounce?  I mean, is the problem that you can't retrieve messages from 
the mail server, or that messages sent to that server just don't get 
there?  If you can't retrieve them, you need a pop/imap server, but if 
the messages  bounce, you got a more complex problem and you need some 
help from somebody who knows qmail (I use sendmail, a real man's 
mailserver).

In the past, I have gotten both acknowledgement and action from UUNet on 
such issues, and they are not having financial trouble that I know of. 
 Also, since they are a fairly major ISP, blocking them might cause 
problems for you.  You might try reporting your complaints through Spamcop 
who will contact UUNet on your behalf.  UUNet might be quicker to respond 
to Spamcop than to an individual.

Hi Josh,

Some ideas: read "Life With qmail" , by Dave Sill, 
http://www.lifewithqmail.org/lwq.html. Have you subcribed to the user mail 
list, or searched the archives? Lots of good information there, if you ignore 
the cranky ones.

How are you with DNS, is there an MX record pointing to your mail server?

You won't need a POP server for local mail handling, that's for remote user 
access. qmail will deliver directly to your local mailboxes.

Carla

When I try to send email to my server, it just gets bounced. Never
arrives at my server. I get messages like this:

This Message was undeliverable due to the following reason:

Your message was not delivered because the destination computer was
not found.  Carefully check that it was spelled correctly and try
sending it again if there were any mistakes.

It is also possible that a network problem caused this situation,
so if you are sure the address is correct you might want to try to
send it again.  If the problem continues, contact your friendly
system administrator.

  I got a few acknowledgements, but the spam from 'emailhello.com' keeps
coming. The IP address block is assigned to quixotik.com and is part of the
uunet.net IP address block.

  I've done the spamcop route first. Then I started sending abuse reports
there directly.

You might let postmaster at attbi.com know that server.barkingcorndog.homelinux.org

[ rest of the answer clipped for brevity. ]

I also sent you a message at the root at ... address.  It hasn't bounced yet, so perhaps
you have it already.

If that is so, you've been beating your head on the wall for an ATT problem. :)

As I typed a moment ago, that host is findable.

But the message I sent to the address you listed resulted in:


Apr 23 16:50:54 barley postfix/smtp[29397]: 81E718954: to=<root at barkingcorndog.homelinux.org>, relay=barkingcorndog.homelinux.org[12.224.138.112], delay=1, status=bounced (host barkingcorndog.homelinux.org[12.224.138.112] said: 553 sorry, that domain isn't in my list of allowed rcpthosts (#5.7.1))

So it looks like you need to tell qmail that it should allow mail to barkingcorndog.homelinux.org.

The command "sensors" will read the sensors and print the readings.
If you want to do it yourself from your won program, "sensors" just reads
/proc, look at the source for "sensors" to figure out what it reads.

We're consulting the legal staff at the FSF for a definitive
answer on this. More when we have a US legal opinion.

In the meantime, don't panic. We don't think we infringe
their patent claims (but this is why we're getting a legal
opinion - to make sure this is the case) and the license
is for CIFS *documentation*, not any code at present.

The opinion of someone who has seen this documentation
(not me) is that there is nothing in it that Samba doesn't
already implement. In fact it is a significant subset of
the SNIA CIFS documentation which the Samba Team has
helped prepare. This license seems to have been created (IMHO)
to create fear uncertainty and doubt amongst Samba users
and vendors using Samba - such as the comments that have
been appearing on this list :-). It's a classic marketing
tactic I believe.

Terry,

Perhaps, but this would seem a pretty relevant issue to PLUG at large.  It's
cool that so many people are coming out of the woodwork to fight in this
battle, but I suggest if their help is really needed, they must be kept in
the loop, even if they don't bother or are not able to join a separate list.
And they ought to be given useful instructions on what they can do (myself
especially), according to their skills.  I suggest to fight effectively,
this willing army will need a commander.

Subject: [PLUG] hosts file and dhcp
Message-ID: <15558.10406.576875.629741@soggy.deldotd.com>

pluggers,

I'm trying to allow another computer on my network to access a printer
and apparently I need to set-up a hosts.allow file.

The computer is using dhcp, so I'm wondering how you go about figuring
out what ip address corresponds to the hostname when it's possible
that the ip address will change.

Also, exactly how many copies of lpd should run on a given system ?
Every time I run lpd on one of my machines (the remote one) two copies
end up running.

On my server only one copy runs.  I'm suspecting that the remote
machine is running two copies because one handles the remote printer
and one handles the local printer.  Is that right ?

Thanks

Brian

Subject: [PLUG] Anti-microsoft & DDSD
Message-ID: <20020424034157.GC25291@subtend.net>

Regarding the recent licensing attacks against our Oregon schools, I
wrote a letter to David Douglas School District where I helped them
build their first district network waayy back in 1993-1996.  I offered
to help them in any way to replace MS products with free software.

I received a friendly and prompt reply back from the IT department head.
A new elementary school is opening soon and they plan to fully deploy
Linux, with some Mac in the mix. He also told me he took a team over to
see Riverdale SD's operation and was impressed.

Here is a snippit from the email I received:

"Perfect timing.  We will be opening a "new" elementary school in the fall
- Earl Boyles, formerly AIM HS, will be remodeled and expanded.  Our plan
is to start with 25 Linux stations in classrooms, along with some desktop
Macs and iBooks.  We are just starting out in the Linux arena, but are
excited about the possibilities.  I took a team from Earl Boyles along
with <removed> and <removed> from our IT Dept to visit Riverdale SD.
they have been using Linux for quite awhile and are very pleased with it.
I, too, am offended by the Microsoft tactics, and would like to use Earl
Boyles as the first stage of changing over to a free software system."

I'm glad to see DDSD is eager to help the fight against MS.  I will be meeting
with them soon to discuss how I can help them in this deployment, and 
possibly other opportunities.

I would encourage others to pick a school district in your area, or one
you graduated from and start volunteering!  The more linux skills these
kids get the better.

Hmm.. maybe I could volunteer some linux instruction courses...?  Back
when I was a Junior I remember teaching a DOS 6 course after school to
teachers.  Yes, I was an anti-social geek in HS, but wasn't everyone on 
this list?

  No. I spent my high school years heading the electronics committee for the
cyclotron project, playing soccer and dating. BTW, we were the first high
school in the country to have a working cyclotron. It went into operation
just before graduation in June, 1962.

Looks like when I enable lpd and one of the entry is the local
parallel port, suspend stops working.

The suspend will hang and the minute I kill the lpd process the laptop
will then suspend.

Anybody have any ideas ?

I'm pretty sure I'm running the parport device in polling mode,
because I've never been able to get interrupt driven mode to work.

I suppose that the interaction of lpd and the parallel port must fool
apm into thinking that the port is in use.

There's giving useful instructions (better, useful ideas) on what people can
do, and then there's coming up with those ideas in the first place. My 
thinking was to move the latter off the main list.

Keep in mind also that a lot of people that would otherwise be inclined
to participate in PLUG activities don't because of the high traffic (and
sometimes very low signal-to-noise ratio) on the main list. It's just more 
than some people can grok every day.

I think the army/commander analogy isn't going to fly. Open Source and
Linux is driven by distributed processing, human style. Linus doesn't
tell people what part of the kernel to work on. Whenever asked he just
says "Work on what interests you." Out of that one command to the masses
he gets a pretty nice kernel.

This MS offensive has sparked *my* interest. Before this episode my
attitude was that open source would inevitibly win out over closed source
Actually, I still think that's true, but this MS thing has really cheesed me 
off and I'm in the mood to speed things up a little. Problem is, I lack for
ideas beyond the usual set. (Write your congressman, phone the neighbors,
wake the kids, etc.) PLUG-edu seemed like the place to start some 
discussions about this. In the mean time I might just write my congressman.

So what interests YOU? There are lots of ways to help out in the Open-Source
world without being a programmer. Here are some (though not directly related
to the immediate problem with MS in PDX):

- Writing documentation
- Translating documentation
- Testing software
- Teaching others how to use the software
- Teaching others how to get connected to the open-source community

Do what interests you.

Does it do it with a not-so-bleeding-edge kernel?  Just curious if
somebody changed the /proc stuff and didn't fix up someplace else.

You can set up dhcpd to give a particular IP address to a particular MAC
(ethernet hardware) address.  That way your printer will always be at the
same place.  Then it's fairly trivial to add the /etc/hosts* entries.

I'd be interested in putting in a week or two setting up Linux boxes and
teaching people how to use them to help the schools up there.  I live in
the Bay Area, so I don't know how feasible it would be to fly me up
there, but I have a great deal of experience with Linux and networks
(and even getting them to interoperate with MS) as well as experience
teaching people about computers.  With enough volunteers, all of the
offending computers could easily be transitioned to Linux, and everyone
instructed in their use.

Thank you,

You might consider using the cups printing system http://www.cups.org/ .
It allows you to control access by username /password as well as
ip address. That way you don't have to know the ip address of the client
for authentication.

You may be right, Terry.  The military analogy came to mind just because I
see a number of people like me who want to fight this thing but don't really
know how.  If they had a weapon, they'd use it.  I may write my congressman,
but will it really help?  I mean, it isn't very direct, is it?  And this
issue calls for direct and immediate action.

I'm sensing the basic idea among this group is, let's try to save these
schools some money (well, save ourselves money, ultimately) by installing
Linux on some of their computers before Microsoft comes after them.  Now I
would bet most of the people who've offered to help have some computer
skills.  I do Web development and have for years.  And I run some services
on a Linux server here at home.  I am not, as you know, very knowledgeable
of Linux, but with a little assistance, I could learn to install and
configure Red Hat or Mandrake on a variety of hardware, and I would be
willing to support schools learning to use it.  If we could form an actual
network of Linux admin's, geeks, and enthusiasts, maybe some sort of
hierarchy of expertise, then perhaps we could approach some of the schools
under fire (sorry, I can't help it--the battle metaphor just works for me
here) with a promise to help them get on their feet with a non-M$ platform.
The time is right, yes?  We could give ourselves a name to make it official,
or we could work on behalf of K12Linux.  BTW, anyone know if those folks
have a plan for this sixty-day ultimatum?  What resources have they?  It
seems to me what would make Linux most attractive to these schools is
on-site assistance and a commitment of time, and that's what I see being
offered in this list right now.

(Personally, I've had a hard time getting Linux down very well, but I'd like
to eventually; so for me, the knowledge I would accumulate would be worth my
time.)

Of course, I suppose this is just what you say should be taken to plug-edu,
Terry.  I presume that list has been more or less dormant, though; so again,
I wonder how many of us would follow the discussion there (I've read the
five messages there currently).  It seems we have about sixty days to do
something about this.  I suspect if anything's going to happen, it's
likelier to happen here.  And while I appreciate your insight into open
source development, I doubt whether telling us willing participants to work
on what interests us will do much to alleviate the costs our local schools
are facing in the very near future.

So this is just me taking a pathetic little stab at it.  I'm sure I've
overlooked some obvious points, but above all, I'm willing to invest myself,
at least in the short term, to countering this M$ audit BS, but I need some
direction if I'm going to be effective.  Just so.  Education is one of the
few things that really matter to me, and I've been watching our schools
falter for too long.

So, has anybody had any luck in contacting folks at the ESD and finding 
out what help they need?  I can setup ix86 linux boxes and get them into a 
reasonably secure state (especially if I put Bastille on 'em), and I'm 
sure I could teach users how to deal with the things.    

No doubt there are plenty of people on the list ready to go out and 
nuke some windows partitions.  But is anybody asking for help?

Message-ID: <200204241527.g3OFRuP02982@tinman.seitzassoc.com>

Below is a news article from deja.
You definitely need a hosts.lpd file, but it looks
the name of the client machine needs to resolve via DNS.  That's a problem
if you are using DHCP.  Are you running bind?  If so, you could set it up
to do dynamic updates.  I've got it running that way at the office.  
Probably overkill for your setup.  I think the suggestion to tie the MAC
to a fixed IP is probably the easiest.

Here's an example from my /etc/dhcpd.conf.  

host toto {
   hardware ethernet 08:00:20:75:A0:7F;
   fixed-address toto.seitzassoc.com;
}

And the corresponding entry in /etc/hosts.

192.168.1.131           toto.seitzassoc.com toto

And /etc/hosts.lpd

toto.seitzassoc.com

Thanks, Bill.

I've done some followup myself. A comment in the Slackware hosts.lpd
says that it's format is the same as hosts.equiv. I've found (in
"TCP/IP Network Administration" by Craig Hunt) that the hosts.equiv
file contains entries in the form of 
 [+ | -] [hostname]  [+ | -] [username]

so
  system.domain
is valid, as is
  system
.
The optional plus or minus is used to add or subtract certain hosts
from the permissions list, and can stand alone. For instance,
  +
means that all hosts are allowed access


However, it looks like the lpd still uses DNS to resolve the client's
hostname (IP to hostname, hostname in hosts.lpd), so our DHCP clients
may be out of luck unless they are also DDNS clients. Since (because
of circumstances beyond my control) I'm testing using a DHCP client
(with no DDNS), I'm not getting through to the print server. lpd
doesn't seem to generate much in the way of diagnostics, so it's
difficult to tell whether it's the lack of DDNS that's causing the
problem, or a misconfiguration on the Linux box.

Anyway, I'll keep trying...

Subject: [PLUG] Coordination and Planning
Message-ID: <3CBB5E86000086DF@mta07.san.yahoo.com>

Normally, a "do what you want" approach seems to produce good results in
Open Source / Free Software projects.

But we aren't tweaking a kernel here.  Responding to Microsoft's threat
will require coordination, a plan, and most of all *leadership*.

That's because we're talking about existing organizations with existing
plans and resources already deployed.  Having a bunch of volunteers descend
on schools and upgrade computers willy-nilly probably won't be very helpful
unless it's part of a robust plan.  Managing 25K installations at dozens
of locations doesn't just happen.

I'm willing to give significant time and what skills I have.  So are many
people here... but I don't hear anyone from the schools asking for our help
just yet.

Absent that request, I would suggest that we turn our energy toward things
like drawing attention to the issue.  MS stands to gain a few million dollars
by shaking down schools?  I bet we could cost them at least that much in
bad publicity if we put our heads together.

In many ways, it's not really about Portland Public Schools at all.  They
are in a really tight spot here, but it's not as though they aren't already
well aware of how to deploy Linux.  The larger audience for our message
are schools, organizations and businesses who think that they can afford
Windoze b/c they are just too small or unprofitable for MS to bother with
license enforcement.  Some of these organizations might hear this story
and realize that they want to start working on a migration plan ASAP.

As I said, I would pitch in and help PPS at the drop of a hat... but only
if they want my help.  In the mean time, I wonder if we shouldn't be focusing
our energy and outrage at the larger issues this incident represents.

My $0.02...

Hi,

I'm new to this list so I hope I am not out of order with
such a long post.. But i feel wordy this morning:)

I do not think that the military analogy is appropiate here.
An abusive husband is probably more descriptive.
As tempting as it is to surcumb to the desire to battle the evil 
redmond, I don't think run will be very productive in the long run.

Microsoft can not do anything that the people will not allow.
And people put up with this controlling behaviour because they do not 
really think they have alternatives.  It is the confidence of the 
community that needs to be won. Linux is not a MS killer but a Knight 
in shining armour.

It can be  a scarry thing to make the switch to Linux. 
What do you do when Johnny demands a desktop like the one daddy 
has at home. Or some parent objects. Or something breaks and disrupts 
the classroom. It can seem easier to just maintain the status quo
and MS counts on this behaviour. 

The battle is psychological not technical. 

Too often in the heat of that battle we forget that computers are not
ends in themselves. They are tools do to other stuff with. Most people
do not want to get tangled up in the process of manageing the computer
and software. Thay just want to "do stuff".

The community needs a commons for this issue. OpenACS (www.openacs.org) 
can provide this, and can be set up in a couple of days. Once that is done 
send out email and perhaps even a public service announcement, inviting
parents and teachers to participate. Having a focal point can  reassure 
the public.  It can also provide a place for people to sign up for
install duty, moderation etc. 

By next Wednesday maybe ??

I think Jason is correct.  Many people have said that they would like to
help, but I think most of us lack direction.  Is someone going to contact
poeple at schools who are the decision makers for IT?  Does anyone know who
to call?  It mentioned more school districts than just Portland.  Does
anyone know which other districts we should contact?  Someone with good
sales skills should contact the decision makers and make a pitch to them.  I
think we need someone to set some standards to offer the schools like we can
install XXXX disto with these settings on each XXXX type of computer.
Turning a bunch of people loose in even one school and installing different
stuff on each machine would create a huge mess and probably do more damage
than good.  Some command structure would only help.

Last I heard, and this is of rumor quality, they're still thinking
of trying to pull off the audit. I'm not aware of any requests for
help.

I think we need to not get hung up on the idea of replacing all of the 
Windows boxes in 60 days and instead accept the idea that this time
around, Microsoft might win. The key is thinking longer term, trying
to address some of the technical, procedural, and other issues that
prevent Linux from being a viable option as the universal OS for the
schools. A lot of it could turn out to be R&D work, i.e. finding out
what Windows software packages are used in the schools, and then
researching similar packages for Linux. If there are holes, that 
would point the way to some software development opportunities for
the programmers among us.

So for example, let's say one or more of you had some expertise in 
some field, like accounting. A project that might interest you would be to 
research the available Linux accounting packages, then evaluate them to 
determine which ones are lame, which ones are pretty good, and which ones 
could use a little work. From there, figure out what you would recommend 
to the schools for Linux-based accounting.

Schools need lots of other software packages, for e-mail, tracking grades,
scheduling classes, educational software for students, and so on. Before
rushing in with a universal Linux solution, all these areas need to be 
explored to see what's available and to identify holes where some software 
development effort might be required.

So out of all that, find areas that interest you and match your skills,
then just go with it.

Here's another thought.  What if the school district just tells M$ that it
will take them 120 days (or whatever) to do the audit and that's how it's
going to be?  What could M$ really do about it?  Sue the school district?
Has anyone ever tried this?  It's really easy for M$ to send a letter saying
do this audit or pay up, but it might be harder for them to deal with
someone actually pushing back.

Well said. This, in my opinion, cries for a meeting. Many of us have never 
been to a PLUG meeting, many of us just joined this list, but I personally

I think what is necessary right now is a framework. A commons.

Leadership will emerge from that. And it very likely will

The eductional community needs to be part of the process, not

I see the linux community as the engineers that "make it go". 
But we are often too easily caught up in the mechanics to be 
very good leaders.

I see your point, but I have to disagree.  Linux is way beyond the point
of just attracting engineers and hackers.  Many of us are probably among
the more technically inclined in our various professions, but lots of Linux
users have interests and skills beyond system administration.

That might not be apparent from the typical threads on this list, since
those of us who are using Linux in non-technical professions probably do
more lurking than posting.  

But we're here and maybe it's time for us to find the way our skills can
best benefit the larger project we're all a part of.  I'm not likely to
offer anyone here the very best perl algorithm or sendmail advice, but I
can write a hell of a press release and plan a mean PR campaign.  Maybe
working with the LDP is the best and most appropriate way for me to contribute,
but somehow I doubt it.

Just thinkin' out loud...

Ok, here is a general outline of what I see happening here.

We appear to have two groups represented here.  One group feels that we
should take a passive approach, slowly building a case and finding our own
support where we can.  This group feels that the audit will likely happen
and there is nothing we can do about that and I am inclined to agree.  We
are dealing with an administration and nothing gets done quickly.  This is
why Microsoft gave them so little time to meet their demands.  They know
that there is insufficient time for an alternative to be planned and
implemented.

The other group wants to take an active approach, get in now and make the
changes and force the public to take notice and hopefully provide support.
They realize that something must begin now and that waiting will only work
against us.  I agree with this.  Once the school districts have MS in their
budget it will take alot more work to get it out.

What we need is a merging of these attitudes.  The more organized and
methodical of a front we can present to the public the more likely we are to
get support.  RedHat has already stated in response to the USDOJ vs.
Microsoft proposed settlement that would offer software and support to
schools if MS would provide hardware.  There is a good chance that we could
get them to make this same agreement with us.  That would give us the
corporate support needed to be taken seriously.

This is not just about MS vs. Linux it is about acountability for our tax
dollars as well.  A friend of mine is a teacher for a PSD school that cannot
afford new books so they are forced to share books that are literally
falling apart and missing pages.  They don't have any workbooks.  The
computers and software are grossly outdated, half the time the printers are
down, which is a big deal when you don't have workbooks.  The money that
should be spent buying them decent books and workbooks and upgrading to
reasonable hardware is being spent instead on MS.  This is wrong.  The
schools exist to provide an education not support a monopoly when there is a
more affordable, viable alternative.  This is offensive not only to the
parents with children in these schools, but to the public who is paying for
something they are not getting.

The easiest solution to this is to work with the K12Linux project since they
have the resources in place already.  However, if they are not interested in
a more active approach then now is the time to start something else.  Dylan
just mentioned that he could write a good press release and mount a PR
campaign.  We need this kind of support since the public is our best ally.
If they support us then the schools will have to do the right thing.  I will
be attempting to open preliminary talks with RedHat this afternoon, so the
sooner we get together and discuss this the better.  What is best for
everyone as far as times and meeting places?  Can I assume tomorrow is too
soon?  Let me know and we will work on a location.  This will be very
informal and just a means to get our ideas together and decide what
direction to go.  If we could get a representative from the K12Linux project
to come it would be very good.  Many of the statements in this email may be
incorrect or poorly founded, but that is why we need a meeting.  Let's get
this going.

I'm glad you said this. I really get discouraged when someone gets in the 
mindset of the Linux community needing direct most of its energy to 
exactly duplicating the functionality of Windows software. We're never 
going to catch up at that rate. People are never EVER going to be 
convinced of the value of Open Source if it's constantly a pure technology 
race with Microsoft. What's needed is on-the-ground support, training, and 
assistance to make what exists now accessible. Let those with the 
technical skills handle the programming and let others (even those of us 
with technical skills who'd like to help people directly) actually 
interact with people and show them the benefits of Open Source. 

Remember, Microsoft got to the point they are in part because of word of 
mouth, popularity. So PR, human interaction are probably as much if not 
more necessary than making sure Gnumeric is as easy to use as Excel.

Odd, indeed.

I took a look at the source code for iostat, & it reads /proc/stat in a
very straightforward manner. (If I can understand the source code with my
little C, then it has to be simple.) On my computer the relevant line from
/proc/stat reads:

cpu  9280639 557083619 5995027 545458765

Add the numbers, then find the percentage the last number (which represents
the hundreths of a second the processor has been idle since the last reboot)
is of the sum. Unless there's a bug in your copy of iostat, it ought to
agree with this quick calculation.

Now, in theory, you ought to be able to look at the /proc/*/cpu files &
estimate from them how much time each is using from the processor. However,
my copy of Documentation/proc.txt doesn't even mention this file, so I
can't say if one or more processes are being hid from top -- & perhaps
the system -- somehow. (Most of the files in /proc remain a black art to
me.)

Does ps -aux provide any more light?

Either you found an interesting bug, or the first hint of a new rootkit.
(BTW, what's the info on the processor?)

Actually I think you do agree, I just did not express myself well.
I think the linux community needs to  include users. And that 
was exactly my point. I was responding to the call for leadership 
which should be a call to the community as a whole. Geeks AND
users and grandmothers etc. I think getting them into the process is
the first step. Right now the linux community is heavily weighted
on the side of geeks and "engineers". At least the  vocal ones.

Those lurkers and the folks who do not know what a mount point is,
need to feel comfortable speaking up.  Thats why I think a frame
work is necessary. The third grade teacher in Gresham doesn't
want to wade through  16 messages of getting an smpt server working
to keep up with the latest on this issue. And She/he may likely 
feel intimidated by all the techno speak.

Exactly! I'm a relative Linux newbie. And I don't have any children, but I 
still believe schools should be run as streamlined as they can in places, 
so that there's more money for teachers and smaller classes. Thus this 
kind of waste would bother me even if I was the biggest MS supporter.

I live on the West Side, Beaverton, near light rail. So downtown, close

I would like to meet as soon as possible, personally. And as far as
specific skills go, I am a web programmer and database programmer, so I'd
be more than happy to do some JSP/MySQL, whatever would help in that

Last number is idle, not uptime.  And times are in jiffies, which

So Paul, x86 or sparc or wxyz?

Here is a list of things that need to be researched.  Please add to this
list.

1.  We need to know which schools are already MESD participants.  We know
that PSD is, but who else.

2.  What are the terms of MESD participation?  Do they require a long term
contract or is it renewable on a short term basis?  In other words how long
are schools will it be for schools who do sign before they can make a
switch.

3.  What skills other than technical can we bring to the table?  I have both
technical skills and non-technical management skills.

4.  Who is prepared to act as a political front?  We need the support of the
public to make this succeed.

5.  Does anyone have connections inside possible corporate backers that
might allow us some leverage?

This is only a short preliminary list and needs many additions to be

I think that before trying to meet and organize, someone really
needs to find out who's in charge at the PSD and find out what
could be done.  It may be that they're totally resistant to a Linux
migration or that they'll all for it; I suspect it's somewhere in
between, but meeting to talk about what would be done without any
idea of what would be done seems like a waste of time.

Given that Dylan Reinhardt is taking an active stance, I nominate
him to be the PSD liason.  I would have nominated Eric or Paul,
but they're probably up to their elbows already.

It would also be beneficial for our cause to have someone record
what's going on and act as a liason with the media or to actually do
freelance writing; I can already see a great sensationalist headline:
"Local Linux community saves 10 Portland teachers' positions from
Microsoft".  Given that Michael Rasmussen is an established writer
and has expressed interest, I nomintate him.

It may be that more than anything else they need warm bodies who
can sit at a machine and record license numbers; who's up for that?
Will they require any sort of qualifications or background checks
or whatever before allowing a body in to do work?  That sort of
thing could cause a substantial hold-up.

As a side note, I know FreeGeek has a long list of people waiting
to do volunteer work to get recycled machines; perhaps they would
consider allowing volunteers to earn part of their hours with this?
I not hip on the FG is doing, so maybe that's not reasonable.

Hi all,

I have a script that list all users that try to logon a linux pop3 email server
incorrectly.
It sorts (by logon and address) and emails the list to me.  I would like to take it
one
step further, and that is to only list each person once with the number of times
they had a failed login.

sample of the output:
user=usera           host=[##.##.##.1]     Apr 23 11:09:53
user=usera           host=[##.##.##.1]     Apr 23 11:10:04
user=usera           host=[##.##.##.1]     Apr 23 11:10:40
user=usera           host=[##.##.##.1]     Apr 23 11:10:50
user=userb           host=[##.##.##.2]     Apr 22 06:43:39
user=userb           host=[##.##.##.2]     Apr 22 12:02:57
user=userb           host=[##.##.##.2]     Apr 22 12:03:02
user=userc           host=[##.##.##.3]     Apr 24 10:38:29

would like:
user=usera           host=[##.##.##.1]   faild logins=4
user=userb           host=[##.##.##.2]   faild logins=3
user=userc           host=[##.##.##.3]   faild logins=1

The count needs to change when the user name and ip address change.
Is there a easy script command that can do this?

Thanks
Abraham Z.

Exactly! I'm a relative Linux newbie. And I don't have any children, but I
still believe schools should be run as streamlined as they can in places,
so that there's more money for teachers and smaller classes. Thus this
kind of waste would bother me even if I was the biggest MS supporter.

I live on the West Side, Beaverton, near light rail. So downtown, close
east side, anywhere west side is good.

I would like to meet as soon as possible, personally. And as far as
specific skills go, I am a web programmer and database programmer, so I'd
be more than happy to do some JSP/MySQL, whatever would help in that
regard.

I'm flattered.  Though my stance was mostly related to *not* depending on
working with PSD, I'm happy to help in any way. 

But I'd really rather get together with other people who are interested
and talk this through a bit first.

How many people might be available to meet downtown for lunch today?  Tomorrow?

I'm all for getting going ASAP, but would rather have a sense of how many
people are committed, and what they are committed to doing.

Subject: [PLUG] HELP - no outside access to only one server
Message-ID: <1019673114.2541.1084.camel@dereklinux>

Hi All,

I need HELP!  I had access (from home) to www.cdkeybonus.com last night
before going to bed, this morning I had none.  I did have access to
www.infotects.com which is on the same subnet and physically sitting
next to the server I cannot access.

I got to work and the server is still alive!  I can even access it from
www.infotects.com.

I didn't change anything last night,  and we did not have any power
failures.

Last night, I was trying to figure out why mail from work wasn't being
delivered to my home (though mail from home makes it to work just fine),
I'm not sure if this is a related problem or not (I doubt it).

I contacted our service provider, they were no help.

So, I'm taking a poll, how many of you can access www.cdkeybonus.com?

You should get an error from apache, "Permission denied", I don't allow
directory browsing on this server.

I also have the router drop pings, so the only trace route you will be
able to use is tcptraceroute to port 80.

The more information the better.

TIA!

Derek Loree

I second Wil's nominations.

I'll also suggest that someone put up an online volunteer database, for PLUG's internal use only. It would be 
great if we could get an accounting of who is willing and capable of doing what. I'll donate space on my DSL fed 
server, if someone has the wherewithal to put the thing together. If I did it, it would have to be done with 
frontpage. Maybe there's a yahoo site that will get there, too. I'll have a quick peek later.

I agree that we need a liason to PSD, but let's not forget that they are not
the only ones affected by this.  MS is doing this to 9 schools in Oregon and
14 in Washington.  They should all be the focus of this campaign.  Also, we
need a liason to the public, since the decision is really theirs, whether
the schools support it or not.  If we get the public's support the schools
will follow and vice versa.

The point of the meeting is to figure out what needs to be done to to
propose a solution.  We could do in a couple of hours face to face what it
would take days to get done through email.  That is why I think it is
important to get together for an informal meeting and get everyone's
opinion.

I can't reach it from home (AT&T cable internet) or work.  I time out both places.  When I do a traceroute from home I get as far as:

15  67.105.129.6 (67.105.129.6)  54.306 ms !A *  53.361 ms !A

Unfortunately I don't have any ideas as to why.  Did you change firewall rules?  Good luck.

Assuming that you want to use your current output for input:

#!/usr/bin/perl

while(<>) {
	($user, $host, @date) = split;
	$logins{$user."\t".$host}++;
}

foreach $u (keys %logins) {
	print "$u\tfailed logins=$logins{$u}\n";

If it's x86, it may not matter. I have a dual proc x86 system, & a larger
fragment from /proc/stat reads:

more /proc/stat

Actually, iostat uses sscanf to read the value from /proc/stat directly.
No calculations are made in iostat based on what it reads (other than to
arrive at the percentages.)

Then again, the idle value in /proc/stat may be calculated as you say by
the kernel. Is this what you meant, Randy?

Good idea... make it known to the public that people are trying to volunteer
and help.  But be careful not to push TOO hard from the public side.

In the case that some things are not readily changable (existing vertical
apps in particular) you wouldn't want the schools to be facing one demand
from one side (MS: Sumbit to our new license or "death by audit") and
another from the opposite side (Public: Drop everything on MS NOW.  No
compromises allowed.)  Yes, it's highly unlikely... but undesirable.  We
need to try to offer solutions, not blanket demands to be met.

I say this only to make sure wiggle room is retained for any existing apps
that would take longer than the allowed time to migrate.  And those that may
not have any replacement at all.  (Or at least not yet.)  The first 95%
usually isn't too hard... it's this stuff that makes up the last 5%.  And is
often mission-critical.  I don't know if they have anything like that, but
if they do it can be a real killer.

We need to know what they have beyond everyday office/web type stuff. What
apps really make everything tick.

No, like I said, I didn't change anything.  It gets weirder, if you
traceroute (I use tcptraceroute hostname 80) to www.infotects.com, it
never goes through 67.105.129.6!!

I really am at a loss, how can to addresses on the same subnet get
routed through different machines?

Could this be a man-in-the-middle type of attach?

Any ideas welcome, though this bit of info seems to point to my service
provider as the culprit, I have called them again and convinced them to
start a trouble ticket.

Thanks, I appreciate the help.

I had the need to script the sending of a few emails that contain 
attachments. My first thought was invoking the "mail" command for which I 
had piped text into before, but it doesn't handle MIME encoding. A quick 
freshmeat search brought me to 'matt'. matt handles multiple attachments 
and encodes them in base64.

The matt tarball consists of a few .c and .o files and a makefile. Running 
'make' will compile it in no time and a 'make install' will put the 
executable to /usr/local/bin.

Here are the simple options to using it:
usage : matt [options] file(s)
             -f <from>        Email from
             -t <to>          Email to
             -s <subject>     Email subject
             -m <mailhost>    Mail host to use
             -b               Read message body from stdin
             -i               Interactive Configuration

             -h               Help

My few tests have worked perfectly. matt is short, simple and sweet, just 
what was needed.

Great idea... I just threw one together.  It's quick and dirty, but should
do the trick for now.

Will be happy to turn over any data collected to anyone who has a better

This is exactly the type of input that needs to be brought up.  The fact is
that it would take way too long to phase MS out completely.  There are
25,000 machines in PSD.  Of these maybe 22,000 could be upgraded quickly and
easily.  The remaining 3000 would require greater involvement and therefore
could not be completed in time to duck the audit.  However, auditing 3000
machines is a much less daunting task than 25,000.  No matter what happens
there will inevitably be at least a few hundred machines that will remain MS
for whatever reason.  But again, a few hundred or even a few thousand
licenses are much less of a burden than 25,000.

Is MS demanding that they audit every machine MS run or not?  If so, part of
the conversion would be auditing the new software as it goes in, taking the
cost and effort away from the school districts.  That is a win-win.

As Eric Harrison wrote one or two days ago:

Portland Public Schools *is* a MESD participant. We support the eight school
districts in the county. The other one of the districts I support that is
being audited is Gresham-Barlow.

Besides MESD, there is also NW Regional, which offers the same support for
the 4 counties in the NW corner of Oregon (Washington Co being one of these).

That's OK.  Sometimes people throw out (incorrect) kernel

Hello Linux folkz,
Why can't we create Linux Support Alliance Inc. (LSA Inc.) from PLUG
members.
It can be formed as a loose corporation/cooperation of Linux users and
professionals for the purpose of promoting Linux in public schools,
government and other institutions.
Some of you have professional programming skills, others are network
gurus. Some people are good at educating and supporting users, other
are good administrators. 
Imagine, that some government or public institution wants to cut
licenses and administration costs in their PC/Server environment.
They can contact LSA Inc. and conversion to Linux can be done in
almost no time because of the number of participants and high
availability.
They'll need Linux based custom developed applications for business,
here the job for Linux programmers and developers.
They'll need 24x7 network administration, here the job for network
administrators.
They'll need customer support, here the job for customer support
specialists and educators.
They'll need new web and database servers, here the job for hardware
specialists who can assemble equipment for the fraction of vendor
price.

So, we can create semi-commercial semi-not for profit organization.

I don't want to idealize this idea, but every member of LSA Inc. will
be paid according to his/her coefficient of participance in ongoing
commercial projects. In the same time voluntary work can be easily
done for public school due to the number of participants and
centralized coordination.  

The coordination of LSA Inc. members can be done in a couple of ways.
For example, each member submits his/her schedule of availability and
list of skills at the beginning of the each month to the elected
coordinators.

The coordinators contact (over e-mail or the phone) available member
if a new project or voluntary work needs to be performed.
Upon project completion the participants are getting value points.

Each participant is encouraged to go around and find new Linux related
projects. If he/she can do it on his/her own time, it's fine, if not,
the project should be submitted to the coordinator.

The points for commercial projects are transferred into pay checks for
the participants minus organizational expenses. The points for
voluntary work can be transferred into special awards of recognition
or certificates.

Can we discuss this idea at the nearest PLUG meeting?
Thank you for your time.
Alex

That's a problem with the Linux community at large. We can only control 
what we can control. This tendancy to look down the nose, 
"RTF-Man-Pages"-style at average users is never going to change, I fear. 
The best we can do is try to change that perception at our own level.

Perhaps we can develop a group of volunteers that will take on the support
of school people new to Linux and treat the support as a tutorial.  In 
essence these people would be TFM for the school staff.

This is an idea.  I doubt there is room for both a completely volunteer
group and a group similiar to what Alex describes.  There are big advantages
for either model.

Advantages of the full volunteer group include:

True non-profit status which could easily attract corporate sponsorship.
More evangelical campaign style.
There is no monetary agenda, which increases our chances of public support.

Disadvantages of the above.

More evangelical campaign style.
Money would be a constant issue.
There would not be as much confidence from the schools without having a
guaranteed staff to 	help in case of emergencies or support.

Advantages of the method described below:

The possibility of money attracts better talent.
We could still get corporate partnerships, but getting sponsorships is
unlikely.  	Investments would also be possible.
With an actual income we could have a full time staff which would make
schools more 	comfortable in making a switch.
We could more quickly expand to other markets before MS made their audit
demands or whatever 	other plan they come up with.

Disadvantages of the method described below:

We could not get as much public support, since many would see us as having
an agenda.
There is alot of room for losing sight of our purpose.

Whatever we do we need to remember why we are doing it.  For me, it's about
getting a better education for the children.  That's it.  So what's the best
way to do that?  I don't know.  Please add to the above as necessary.

Hello Linux folkz,
Why can't we create Linux Support Alliance Inc. (LSA Inc.) from PLUG
members.
It can be formed as a loose corporation/cooperation of Linux users and
professionals for the purpose of promoting Linux in public schools,
government and other institutions.
Some of you have professional programming skills, others are network
gurus. Some people are good at educating and supporting users, other
are good administrators.
Imagine, that some government or public institution wants to cut
licenses and administration costs in their PC/Server environment.
They can contact LSA Inc. and conversion to Linux can be done in
almost no time because of the number of participants and high
availability.
They'll need Linux based custom developed applications for business,
here the job for Linux programmers and developers.
They'll need 24x7 network administration, here the job for network
administrators.
They'll need customer support, here the job for customer support
specialists and educators.
They'll need new web and database servers, here the job for hardware
specialists who can assemble equipment for the fraction of vendor
price.

So, we can create semi-commercial semi-not for profit organization.

I don't want to idealize this idea, but every member of LSA Inc. will
be paid according to his/her coefficient of participance in ongoing
commercial projects. In the same time voluntary work can be easily
done for public school due to the number of participants and
centralized coordination.

The coordination of LSA Inc. members can be done in a couple of ways.
For example, each member submits his/her schedule of availability and
list of skills at the beginning of the each month to the elected
coordinators.

The coordinators contact (over e-mail or the phone) available member
if a new project or voluntary work needs to be performed.
Upon project completion the participants are getting value points.

Each participant is encouraged to go around and find new Linux related
projects. If he/she can do it on his/her own time, it's fine, if not,
the project should be submitted to the coordinator.

The points for commercial projects are transferred into pay checks for
the participants minus organizational expenses. The points for
voluntary work can be transferred into special awards of recognition
or certificates.

Can we discuss this idea at the nearest PLUG meeting?
Thank you for your time.
Alex

I'm working on setting up a gateway function so school people can get in

What would y'all think of having a quick lunch meeting or two?  I'm envisioning
picking a time and date and meeting up in the Pioneer Place food court or

This discussion will probably be ongoing for a while... should we be creating

I thought I should update you.  It is now working.  What fixed it?  I'm
not sure.  As I was desperate to get it back in service, I did some
things, and it looks like our service provider some things at about the
same time.

AFAICT, what was happening was that the packets to the _one_ server were
being dropped by the WAN interface of my Cisco router.  Why?  I don't
know, I know I didn't change anything on the router, the access list is
exactly the same as it used to be, and a reload of the router did not
fix it.  So, I contacted our ISP, and they started a trouble ticket, but
only reluctantly, they think it is my fault (mainly because I disabled
telnet into the router, so they can't snoop on it).  This means, I have
one ip address that the WAN interface is dropping, and 31 addresses that
are making it through.  

Could it be a bad NIC?  But I can connect to the box from another box on
the same subnet, going through the same switch!  Ah, the switch, maybe
that's it, so I drag out a longish cat 5 cable, string it between the
hub at the router and the server.  That killed all outside access!  (But
no collisions were detected at the hub.)  Well, that looks like
progress, but it could be a bad cable, however I have an extra NIC, and
I have nothing to lose (but uptime) by changing it.

So I changed it.  It didn't work right off the bat, but about 15 min
later, I start to notice traffic to the server again, we're back on
line!

The traceroutes have definitely changed (different number of hops,
different hop addresses), so I know our ISP made some changes too.

Which one fixed it, I don't know, but I'm willing to entertain
theories.  I still don't understand how one ip address in a block of 32
can be "bad".

Again, thanks for the help!

Hi.  New guy here that's finally decided which direction to drive to get to
a LUG.  (North to Portland or South to Corvallis, from Salem.  I'm sort of
stuck in the middle, you see. :)



Anyway, most definitely agreed.  That's a lot of machines, and a ton of
work.  The willy-nilly approach would probably be more destructive than
anything else.

They're not asking for help yet, like you say.  But I wonder if they would
ask for help unless they see some sort of organization taking place.  (For
fear of the aforementioned "willy-nilly" switch.)  If nothing else (even if
they don't want/need help, it would interesting to see some sort of "big
project" plan put together.  For this and/or future cases.  Whenever a
"volunteer work force" may be called for.

Or perhaps it exists and I just haven't seen it yet. :)  (Smack me down, if
so.)


As far as this instance (the schools) they might be able to use some help
even if it isn't a big linux project.  If they are still considering doing
their own audit (as someone mentioned) maybe they could still use help with
that.

One last thing... do they have a volunteer coordinator of any kind?  If any
of the schools do, they should probably get their head together with their
IT people if any plan for a bunch of volunteers to come in gets started.
There may (or may not) be procedures in place for that already.


I'm pretty busy, but I want to throw my hat in the ring as wanting to help.
Is there a sign up sheet?  :)

People will think you have an agenda just because you use Linux.  Not
many will begrudge you having a job, especially if 

1) you don't tie the schools to an exclusionary contract or license.
2) you can show reduced public school spending.

Consider it this way, how many Linux jobs will 1/10th of the Oregon
Public School license with Microsoft create?  The company would have no
intellectual property to protect or products to sell (since they're
most likely selling services configuring networks and K12LTSP), the
Linux community in general will benefit (people on payroll will be
full-time testers/developers when not doing support) and schools would
save tons of money.  The worst the company could do is put itself out
of a business after converting the entire school distict, but then I'll
bet that there's a substantial market in the small business and
organizational sectors and "franchising".

By the way, it's not that I don't personally like a volunteer model,
but paid people are on the hook for getting things done.  This is the
kind of thing that businesses and organizations pay attention to.

There is of course the 'Goodwill' option.  Charge only enough for services
to cover payroll and overhead.  That way there can still be a full time
staff and paid on-call employees, but it could still be a non-profit.

Sorry, have to chip in with the python way to do it, tad longer script,
but Eh, I'm not as good as I would like to be, requires python2.0  Also
assumes you want to use stdin (I can change it for python1.5 if you want
*grins*

#!/usr/bin/env python2
import sys

mdict = {}
stdin = sys.stdin.readlines()

for line in stdin:
    llist = line.split(None)
    if llist[0] in mdict.keys():
        if llist[1] in mdict[llist[0]].keys():
            mdict[llist[0]][llist[1]] += 1
        else :
            mdict[llist[0]][llist[1]] = 1
    else :
        mdict[llist[0]] = {llist[1]: 1}
        
for a in mdict.keys():
    sys.stdout.write(a + "\n")
    for b in mdict[a].keys():
        sys.stdout.write("".ljust(5) + b.ljust(30) + str(mdict[a][b]) +

This also handles if usera logs on from two different IPs, and record
each under user a, and the attempts from each IP.

We've been having some mail problems here so (I suppose) there has

And you won't until Somebody (probably dressed in a coat and tie :-)
with some _professional_ IT and management experience goes and visits
whoever is in charge of the computing systems w/in the School System
and makes a viable Proposal.

And before such a Proposal is made, this Somebody must understand the
current capabilities of the intact system and the needs of the
teachers, administrators, and students.  It's like going to any large
M$-dependent corporation, sitting down with their IT management,
understanding their current system and their requirements, and then
laying out a (viable) plan to re-make that environment using all-linux
PCs (if that's the goal).

At back of such a plan the Somebody must have in his (or her) back
pocket a list of those w/in PLUG and elsewhere who can implement the
changes in a timely and professional manner.

That's what it will take (in my opinion) to effect the sort of
sea-change
that I'm seeing being bandied about here on PLUG.  And the fact that the
Somebody can say to the IT management,

   "I have here in my back pocket a list of 30 (or however many)
   Linux experts who are ready to give 2400 man-hours to this project,
   free of charge along with follow-on support as the need arises."

should go a long way toward increasing the probability that the IT
manager will take the Somebody seriously.

 :: only if they want my help.  In the mean time, I wonder if we

The world (and the Media) has enough "outrage" already.

Instead of being "outraged", let the Somebody who can make this happen
step
forward and kick M$ where it hurts.  I'm sure _that_ will get some
press:

Oregonian Storyline:

"`Somebody' and a group of 30 professional programmers have entered
into negotiations with Portland Public Schools to convert their entire
computing environment of 25,000 networked computers from Microsoft
Windows to the free operating system known as "Linux".  The
programmers are donating 2400 man-hours to see this project to
completion.  This is in response to the recent Microsoft demand for a
software audit .... blah blah blah"

I'm looking at the results we're getting. It might be more helpful to collect 
areas of expertise that people will give. These areas seem inmportant: 
Programming, Admin, Hardware, Installation, PR and, of course, Other. I put a 
rough idea at:
http://theplatinumrule.com/plug/index.html

Whatever data collection we use, I'll massage it into a usable format with lists 
of people by skill and availibility, if you would like that information that way.

Message-ID: <20020425040044.51788.qmail@web10505.mail.yahoo.com>

for over a year now, I have been struggling with
learning linux/unix.  I found that unix was easier to
learn, and had a nicer interface(I use solaris8 for
intel).  I met someone not too long ago who showed me
something nobody else ever did, including my unix
instructor at portland community
college...http://localhost:8888.  

so for anyone who does NOT just intrinsicly know these
things, THAT IS THE HELP FILE!!  I wish someone would
have told me this a year ago. 

thanks to all who helped me, or attempted to, now I
can help myself.  :)

Currently scheduled PLUG Speakers

    May 2002 - Geoff Burling <llywrch at agora.rdrop.com>
               X-Windows configuration

After that things get vague

    Don Baccus <dhogaza at pacifier.com> of OpenACS told me to contact
        him in April or May as he may be interested in talking on
        Open ACS in June or so.
        Don let me know your schedule.

    Adam Shand <ashand at pixelworks.com>
        Adam has volunteered to speak to speak on the Portland
        Personal Telco project.  We still need to schedule him.

    Omer Hickman <the_lord_of_chaos at techie.com>
        Omer has volunteered to speak using PHP and mySQL to build
        web pages.  We still need to schedule him.

    Michael Hall <mph at puddingbowl.org> formerly of LinuxToday
        I have talked to him about speaking, and I think we could
        schedule him sometime.  I just haven't done it yet.

    Dan Frye
        He has been mentioned as a potential speaker.
        I may see him next week.  If I do, I will mention this
        possibility to him.

    Cooper Stevenson <Cooper.Stevenson at wahchang.com>
        Cooper has volunteered to fill in anytime we need.
        He has a great talk on LVM that we should probably schedule
        at some point.

    Zot O'Connor <zot at whiteknighthackers.com>
        Zot has also volunteered to fill in anytime we need.


    Ok, have I missed anyone?  If so, let me know.  Speakers are always
welcome.  And next, could people let me know when they would like to
be scheduled.


                                          Sincerely,

A relatively simple answer (this happened recently) is that the system
was cracked by a rootkit, and that the root kit installed its own ssh,
which looked for keys in different places.

by calling /usr/sbin/ssh he may have overridden the root kit.

I saw this recently at a client's.

Having just installed it.

Run the sample command

spamassassin -t < sample-spam.txt > spam.out

it seemd to fail when the file (sample-spam.txt) was not local.

After running it as a user, the file was created.

Warning:

I use cyrus, and spamassasin adds the broken "From blah" header to the
beginning of emails.  Cyrus pukes on that line.

I had to put
:0fw
| spamassassin -F 0 -P

In procmailrc.

the '-F 0' turns off the adding of the from line.

Nicely put.

I think the two approaches are not entirely incompatible. In the near term,
especially if the schools don't ask for help, there may not be a lot we can
do in the way of direct support. But just to make sure....

Someone mentioned a press release. (Sorry, I've lost track of who's who
in all these e-mails.) I picture a press release in the very near future that 
pledges PLUG's support of the schools in this matter and states our 
willingness to help out. This press release would serve several purposes:

1. Provide contact information so that if some school districts *do* want to 
get some help then at least they'll know who to call. We should not be 
insulted if they don't call. Under the circumstances it seems best to let the 
schools figure out how to handle the next 60 days. Besides, this is a bad 
time of the school year to be overhauling the IT system. These sorts of
things are normally done over the summer. (Notice MS didn't wait until
summer to ask for the audit.)

2. Put a shot across the bow of the HMS MS (?).

3. Hopefully get it slashdotted and thereby encourage LUGs in other cites
to get involved with their local schools before this happens to them. I'd love
to see similar press releases coming out other LUGs. To me that would be the 
sweetest thing that could happen in the near term. 

It would be really cool if this was a joint press release from several
Northwest LUGs.

That might be all we can do in this 60-day period. Then we have to look at the
longer term where we transition from being just volunteers to being
advocates, pressing the point to decision makers that open source is their 
path out from under the obnoxious monopoly from the North. Along with this 
advocacy, we also have to solve the practical problem of finding a suitable 
Linux application for every Windows application that is used in the schools. 
This could take several years, and in fact it may be that there will always 
be some percentage of Windows boxes in the schools, which is probably okay
as long as the end result is that Windows becomes an option instead of a 
necessity. Then MS will have be polite.

Do you mean http://localhost:8888 is the Solaris documentation
server?  (It's been a couple years since I messed with Solaris,
but that seems about right.)  Linux distros don't have a uniformly
installed documentation server, but most of the documentation is
available in man pages (this should be the first thing they taught
you), as text in /usr/doc or /usr/share/doc (most newer distros
use the latter, to be FHS-compliant), info pages, or just plain
web sites, particularly http://www.tldp.org.  Once you've pretty
well mastered the user commands of one flavor of UNIX, picking up
another is considerably easier.

A more tricky version:

#!/usr/bin/env python2
import sys

mdict = {}

while 1:
    line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    if not line: break
    llist = line.split()
    mdict.setdefault(llist[0], {llist[1]: 0}).setdefault(llist[1], 0)
    mdict[llist[0]][llist[1]] += 1
    
for (user, hosts) in mdict.items():
    for (host, count) in hosts.items():
        sys.stdout.write('\t'.join((user, host, "failed logins=%d" % count)) + "\n")

Subject: [PLUG] Just a tiny bit of MS audit info from the schools
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0204242302090.4880-100000@k12linux.mesd.k12.or.us>

Today I had the opprotunity to talk to many of the folks directly in charge
of the school districts impacted by the MS audit.

First and foremost, everyone is being *swamped* with requests to help. We're
overjoyed with the response, schools very rarely receive such generous offers
to help. For all the beatings we've taken in the schools system recently, it
is very uplifting to have such strong community support.

But no one knows exactly how all of this is going to play out, so they're not
exactly sure what help they are going to need. There is a big regional
education conference tomorrow and Friday, a round table discussion to iron
all of this out is scheduled.

All of the schools I've talked to are scrambling to figure out a way to
utilize the good-will of the community. They all promised to get me contact
info & an outline for what help they could use ASAP. I'll post such info
here as I get it. Hopefully that will be within the next couple of days,
but most likely sometime next week.

Until then, thanks for the support!

Yes indeed.  that is the documentation server, nice
easy to read documentation.  starts with headings,
like administration, gettings started, basic use,
advanced use, opening and closing programs, etc. 
probelm is, everyone says read the man pages.
well, if I am completely unfamiliar with linux/unix,
and dont know that I want said program to do said
operation, then I dont know that I need to type man
said program.  see my point?  anyway, I do appreciate
all the help I have gotten from people, but it just
never made sense cuz I had no clue what program does
or meant what.  now I have something that will walk me
through what does what, how to add user accounts, set
restrictions, etc.  I am mostly shocked that my "Intro
to Unix" course instructor at portland community
college failed to mention the existence of such a
document.  I havent tried it on other distro's of
linux, but I have heard that it did work on other
distro's.  including the bsd installed on mac osX.  :)

any followup from others would be appreciated.
:)

You can do an "apropos topicname" where topicname is
anything that you want to search the man pages for.
Also, there are help search widgets out there for X that
search the man pages and the online documentation.

Say, for instance, that I'm looking up man pages to help
me use my modem... I might use "apropos modem" or
"apropos serial"...something like that.

Message-ID: <1019756308.846.4.camel@reepicheep>

Hi all,

I recently decided to take a look at KDE 3.0 (BTW: I'm very impressed
with it). One of the things I needed to do to build KDE was to install
CUPS, do I downloaded three rpms cups-lib, cups and cups-devel and
installed them. However, cups had a dependency for something called
alternatives. I have no idea what alternatives is, and search on rpmfind
turned up a couple of rpms for Conectiva, but nothing else.

Can anyone tell me what alternatives might be, and where I might find
it?

Thanks.

According to the computer, I'm supposed to give

someone using GRUB with non-default options show me
how kernel options are specified in the configuration file?

Just add your options on the 'kernel' line in /boot/grub/menu.lst.
You don't need to run anything to make the changes take effect like
you did with LILO.

This is the Answerbook. It's not always installed, by default, however. This
may have changes in Sol 8 but in previous versions, you needed to install it
yourself and the documentation that you wanted to store online.

It is definitely not a standard, excepting above on Solaris, to have an http
help system on port 8888.

uniq works great for this type of thing. In this case using sed to strip out

Subject: [PLUG] Question


Hi all,

I have a script that list all users that try to logon a linux pop3 email
server
incorrectly.
It sorts (by logon and address) and emails the list to me.  I would like to
take it
one
step further, and that is to only list each person once with the number of
times
they had a failed login.

sample of the output:
user=usera           host=[##.##.##.1]     Apr 23 11:09:53
user=usera           host=[##.##.##.1]     Apr 23 11:10:04
user=usera           host=[##.##.##.1]     Apr 23 11:10:40
user=usera           host=[##.##.##.1]     Apr 23 11:10:50
user=userb           host=[##.##.##.2]     Apr 22 06:43:39
user=userb           host=[##.##.##.2]     Apr 22 12:02:57
user=userb           host=[##.##.##.2]     Apr 22 12:03:02
user=userc           host=[##.##.##.3]     Apr 24 10:38:29

would like:
user=usera           host=[##.##.##.1]   faild logins=4
user=userb           host=[##.##.##.2]   faild logins=3
user=userc           host=[##.##.##.3]   faild logins=1

The count needs to change when the user name and ip address change.
Is there a easy script command that can do this?

Thanks
Abraham Z.

There is also

http://docs.sun.com/

which should have the same documents you find in an Answerbook 
installation on your localhost:8888.

During a Solaris 8 setup there is an option for the installation of the 
answerbook  packages. I don't remember if its on by default.

I am thinking about buying a refurbished Thinkpad 600 to use as a linux laptop.
I have checked around and everything on it seems to be supported, even
the mwave winmodem. The question is, why are there so many of these
refurbished systems around. Does anybody have one. Are they reliable.

Thanks for any comments,

	Yes, I have a Thinkpad 600.  I too, purchased it used.
	Actually, mine was probably not refurbished.  Anyway, I had no
	problem installing rh7.x.  Don't know why there are so many of
	them available.  I work in console mode most of the time but have
	lately used OpenOffice alot, so I have been in X.

	The problems that I have had have been related to my newness to

I too have been looking to acquire a thinkpad to run Linux on.  I used to have one
when I worked at IBM and I loved it.  A good friend who works for one of the big
consulting shops said they dumped all their Dell laptops in favor of Thinkpads
because the former was causing them grief.  Plus, I wonder if there is better
support for Linux on Thinkpads?? Anybody know about that?

I haven't been able to convince myself to pull the trigger on a used Thinkpad
though.  Laptops tend to have harder lives than PCs, and paying several hundred
bucks for a system that might develop "issues" sooner than I'd like doesn't seem
appealing when you can now get a brand new thinkpad wiht all the latest stuff
inside for close to a thousand bucks. Plus a better warranty.

I'd be curious as to how your experience goes...

Most refurbished computers from major manufacturers come from expired lease 
deals.  In other words, used, sent back to the manufacturer, cleaned, software 
reload, burnin, and resold.

At least, I'm pretty sure this is the case, in particular when dealing with 
the manufacturer of the item itself.

In general the Thinkpad linux support is good. I installed a dual

works except the winmodem. But it's hers and so now I am looking to get 
one for myself.

Check the warranty if you're getting it from IBM.  They're supposed
to have very good warranty support, but I don't know about refurbs.
What prices are you seeing and what are the specs?

The warranty is 3 months and the prices are around $550 for a 
PII 300 with a 5GB hard drive and a 128k ram. More than
enough power for the things I do. The warranty is short,
but that seems reasonable for a refurbished machine.

I have a 600 that's been handed down to me at work.  It's 4 years old
and runs Linux great.  No problems with Immunix 7 or Red Hat 7.1 or 7.2
or 7.3 (beta).

Not the fastest thing if you're doing a lot of programming, but for
reading email and doing web stuff on the couch it works fine :)

The package that provides alternatives is chkconfig in the skipjack

Perhaps try being less specific when naming the package. What happens if 
you do:

rpm -e vnc-server

You might try using a gui such as gnorpm or kpackage, just for kicks.

I'd see about getting more RAM. The last time I worked on a system with 128k
of ram was 1980 (a Microdata REALITY the size of two refrigerators - not
counting the Memorex 667 127Mb drives {w/removable packs - and they
resembled a washing machine}).

Subject: [PLUG] Just a tiny bit of MS audit info from the schools



Today I had the opprotunity to talk to many of the folks directly in charge
of the school districts impacted by the MS audit.

First and foremost, everyone is being *swamped* with requests to help. We're
overjoyed with the response, schools very rarely receive such generous
offers
to help. For all the beatings we've taken in the schools system recently, it
is very uplifting to have such strong community support.

But no one knows exactly how all of this is going to play out, so they're
not
exactly sure what help they are going to need. There is a big regional
education conference tomorrow and Friday, a round table discussion to iron
all of this out is scheduled.

All of the schools I've talked to are scrambling to figure out a way to
utilize the good-will of the community. They all promised to get me contact
info & an outline for what help they could use ASAP. I'll post such info
here as I get it. Hopefully that will be within the next couple of days,
but most likely sometime next week.

Until then, thanks for the support!

-Eric

These days a *real* washing machine probably has more than a 128k RAM.

whoops :) 
I've ordered it now. Maybe I can upgrade it to something like 640k later. 

Thanks to everyone for their comments. I will let you know how it works when I get it.

As I understand it the command in between the ` ` will be run and the output
of that job will be used in the rpm -e command. He already said that rpm -qa
| grep vnc successfully displays the packages as installed so I thought it
might it work to remove them. I could, of course, be completely wrong and
consequently be beaten senseless by the cluestick but that remains to be
seen.

I need a shell script to rename many files.  The files names look like:
"N Clackamas Conformance Vol 2 01-18-00_S607.tif" and 
"N Clackamas Conformance Vol 2 01-18-00_S608.tif".
I want to strip the prefix and just have S607.tif and S608.tif.
I think the prefixes are all the same.  
For sure they all have an underscore preceding the part that I want.  
The easy part is that they are all in the same directory.

That should do it.  You can type it in at the command line,
or put it in a file. (As always, it is prudent to have a backup
before applying wholesale changes to your files.)

This won't work because there are spaces in the filenames.

Check `ren`

note the file ren-1.0.tar.gz is not really gziped, just tarred.

This will do it for you:

#!/bin/sh
for f in *tif
do
	newf=`echo "$f" | sed -e 's/.*_//'`
	mv "$f" "$newf"
done


The quotes are the variables handle the spaces.

Add quotes around the two args to mv(1):

  #!/bin/sh
  for f in *
  do
      newf=`echo $f | sed -e 's/.*_//'`
      mv "$f" "$newf"
  done

If you have double-quotes (") in the file name, well, all bets are off.

How 'bout using parameter substitution...

#!/bin/bash
for f in *
do
    newf=${f##*_}
    mv $f $newf
done

You may want to add a test for the existence of the new file unless you're
certain the extensions are unique.

He also said, "I have a couple of packages that rpm a) lists as being installed

Subject: [PLUG] GUI samba tools for RH 7.2
Message-ID: <BGBXXWXUSNGD42722VUYXUQ1WSN2Y.3cc8a4bd@mike>

What is the current GUI samba tool? It looks like my beloved gnosamba is out of the 
distro, what's the latest and greatest??

On a fresh RH 7.2 install, I'm having some trouble with pam failing file transfers 
after they start. The transfer starts okay, but after a while windows starts with 
the cryptic, inaccurate messages, like "you may not be able to access this file, do 
you want to continue copying" followed by "file already exists" which is impossible 
and not true.

The appropriate samba log for the user says "PAM: smb_pam_auth failed - rejecting 
user XXXX"

I don't see any key.

BTW, the old Microcrap sends mail just fine, no need to upgrade if that's all you want.

Anyway, the reason that this is a problem is that when I try to do:

	lynx -source install.opennms.org | sh

to install openNMS (which uses some sort of apt-get rpm installer) it
bombs because of the listed multiple versions of vnc-doc.

It would be nice to let opennms install itself.  Looks like I'll need
to fall back to the manual method.  

More importantly, being able to use the apt-like tool would be a
GoodThing(tm).

You might just need to remove the multiple entries from the database
with '--justdb'.  Or you might need to rebuild the database with
'rpm --rebuilddb'.

Are you saying you tried the previous recommendation of omitting the 
version info and it still didn't work?

ie.
# rpm -e vnc-doc

really should work.

I get burned on this from time-to-time.  It'd be nice if rpm recognized the 
entire name in these operations.

Yes, I did try that.  It returns the interesting error 

	"vnc-doc" specifies multiple packages

Which, d'oh, is exactly what I'm trying to remove.

Unfortunately, -e doesn't take --force as a companion.

we were all friendly. I have as high a regard for FreeBSD and FreeBSD

FreeBSD users vary just like Linux users.

But supposedly there is some rivalry because FreeBSD was here first but was
held back because of the lawsuit from AT&T because originally FreeBSD was
billed as being UNIX, UNIX being a licensed trademark of AT&T.  Now it's a
"UNIX workalike" just like Linux is.

The real difference is that FreeBSD is "republican", where there are
official developers and if you want to make a change, you submit a change
request to the official parties that be.  Linux is "anarcy", with every joe
out there making their own changes.

In reality, what happens is that Linux gets faster development and some
things just might be in a different state of repair from time to time.
Hence, BSD guys say it's shoddy code, poor presentation.  FreeBSD is just
rock-solid all the time, but it's frustrating to get the programs you want
in any kind of reasonable manner.  It's like the difference between Debian
stable and unstable.

Some *BSD advocates are jealous of the press that Linux is getting, because
they were there first and they think *BSD is a better product.  Linux guys
are quick to point out that because of the BSD license, which allows you to
take the source and close it for commercial ventures, BSD is just a tool
for Microsoft to steal code from.  There are parts of the WinXX code that
still has the Copyright for the Regents of the University of California
that nobody removed before they released it.  And we won't even talk about
what Apple's added to BSD to get OSX.  True, they turned alot of Darwin,
the "guts" back to the community, but the GUI (aqua) is still way
proprietary.

Not really a war, however, more like a "friendly" brotherly feud is how I
would sum it up.

Anyone else here saw the report on channel 6 about MS's audit of the
local schools? It focussed on the Gresham school district, & the costs
that school district faces in complying. It also stated that MS is
willing to offer consultants at $100-- an hour to perform the audit.

Riverdale School District was mentioned at the end as having
migrated to the Lie-nux operating system. I got the impression that
Phil Donnohue believes that Riverdale only runs Linux & uses no
Microsoft products.

(Note: I missed seeing this report, but I did hear it from the next
room. Were any familiar names involved in this bit of publicity?)

Okay, I've never seen that.  The package you mentioned

	vnc-doc-3.3.3r2+tight1.2.2-1
sounds strange.  Was it installed on top of another vnc package? 

What is the "tight" part?

Don't know what distro you're using, but I just freshened vnc to 
vnc-3.3.3r2-18.4 (RH7.2) just fine.


Let us know if you're successful beating down rpm.

Cheers,
Kyle Accardi

As Wil pointed out, there are any number of web sites that are more

Where is that? Even my first 286 came with 1 meg of ram. I can't imagine a 
PII with less that 32 megs.

I just did a search for "Refurbished Thinkpad" on google, and came up with 
a few hits, all had at least 128 megs.

I assume that was a typo?

Oh yes, there's been a lot of animosity amoung the FreeBSD crowd
towards the Linux crowd, for quite some time.  (And the *BSD crowds
in general.)  Did you see that post here or was it somewhere else?
I recently noticed a number of cross-posts to a local FreeBSD user
group, but wasn't able to actually find the list.  (The message to
majordomo@ is sitting in my outgoing queue with 'User unknown'.)

That's too bad. The operating systems are far more alike than they are
different.


> Did you see that post here or was it somewhere else?

It's complicated and I don't know all the details. A message that
announced PANUG's LinuxLive event (http://panug.org/linuxlive.html) this
Saturday was sent to someone who placed it on on the FreeBSD list.
Someone else on that list went into an anti-Linux tirade and a copy of
that made it back to the person who sent the original announcement.

Hello all,

I have been virtually hosting for a few sites by using IP numbers.  What I
would like to know if I can continue to do that and add ones that do not
have their own IP?

So, for example....

hostname         IP
host1.com        123.123.123.123
host2.com        123.123.123.124

host3.com        no IP  but would resolve to 123.123.123.123

Then in Apache and proftp I could setup the hostname to resolve
correctly.

Question is what do I do with if they try to login with the IP?  Can I
stop that?  Is there a way to only allow connections with the name?  Can I
do use postfix to have if do the multiple names as well without the IP or
having them all go to the same IP?

Just wondering if adding another name is going to cause problems because I
currently have an IP for each hostname on the machine and the DNS record
has that as well.

Thanks for the help.

Josh

Looks like you didn't post your public key.

I've always used swat.  Its a web interface that seems
to do the trick for me.  Sometimes its installed with
the distro, and you'll have to enable it via xinetd. 
You could also use webmin, a program that lets you
configure all sorts of stuff from a web interface.

 I've been using XawTV lately for watching cable TV. Somehow, the audio is tuned into the alternative audio channel (SAP), so on some channels I get either no sound or spanish, etc. My spanish is much worse than rusty, so does anybody know how I set the default audio channel to not use SAP?
Thanks amigos!

Interesting.  May I inquire (respond privately if you want)

Hm, maybe that's why I can't get your keys.  I use wwwkeys.eu.pgp.net
and I got his key just fine.  pgp.net and certserver.pgp.com must
not be connected.

Sure, Josh. Just make the DNS point to the IP.

Thanks.

But what happens when the guy at host3.com looks up the IP and then tries
to ftp to it?  Will that be blocked?  Can I block that? I wouldn't want
that to work at all.

No, you can't.  TCP/IP doesn't work that way.

I thot if you posted to one, you got circulated to all.

So, I just also posted to wwwkeys, and discovered the correct syntax:

gpg --send-keys --keyserver wwwkeys.eu.pgp.net

In your httpd.conf file, you would follow the IP defined host with the
name-based hosts.

NameVirtualHost 123.345.543.321

<VirtualHost 123.345.543.321>
 UseCanonicalName off
 ServerAdmin hostmaster at user1domain.com
 ServerName user1domain.com
 DocumentRoot /home/user1/www
 CustomLog /home/user1/logs/access.log combined
 ErrorLog /home/user1/logs/error.log
</Directory>
</VirtualHost>


<VirtualHost 123.345.543.321>
 UseCanonicalName off
 ServerAdmin webmaster at user2domain.com
 ServerName user2domain.com
 DocumentRoot /home/user2/www
 CustomLog /home/user2/logs/access.log combined
 ErrorLog /home/user2/logs/error.log
</Directory>
</VirtualHost>

Add your other stuff like you always would.

If someone uses the IP (123.345.543.321), they would land at
user1domain.com.

I don't know if there's a limit to how many name-based domains that can
share a single IP, but certainly you can do a couple of hundred with no
problem.

Initially, I had trouble getting name-based to work.  The key, for reasons I
have no idea, was to add the line:
   UseCanonicalName off
Then everything worked.

One way to do the DNS would be to CNAME www.user2domain.com to
user1domain.com
and have an A record for user1domain.com defined with the IP address
123.345.543.321.

Hope this is what you were looking for.

Message-ID: <20020425145605.B517@linux-enterprise.net>

All;

I generally don't lash out like this, but this audit thing really upsets me; I don't think third grade school teachers are criminals.

I have written several school administrators in my area letting them know that they have my full support. I have also listened to my group and I can tell you that my guys are on the ready to give their support also.

Personally, I cannot tell you how many good memories I take from my schooling years and am very greatfull for all the teachers in my life who have taught me to "sit up straight and fly right."

--Even when they were not so nice about it.

I want to let you guys know that you have the full support of our group should we need to execute a full-scale roll-out in the future. 

I have been deploying systems for a long time and I know how to do it efficiently. I also know how to listen to intructions when others (in this case perhaps LTSP) know more than I.

If I have to use my vacation time to do this then that's exactly what I will do.

Well you all can relax a little bit.


We had a huge meeting with Microsoft today. They have made huge
"clarifications" which mitigate the impact on schools. The audit deadline
has officially been significantly extended and there are discussions to
pushing it out even further.

The immediate impacts have been softened, everyone has time to catch their
breath and think this through. 

Thanks again for the support. It has made a huge difference already.
Much good will come out of this little snafu.

Message-ID: <005501c1ece3$b7e62850$6401a8c0@endeavor>

In Klamath Falls, because OIT's main campus is here, we have a number of
CSET/HWET and other computer major students.  The focus at OIT is
definitely Microsoft - and I might add this is a good thing - since we
are an applied technology school and that's where the market is.  It is
not all pure Microsoft by any means, there is a lot of general computer
science, and if you telnet in, you're on a nix box of some sort (I'm not
sure)
 
Having said that, I would really like to see more cross-platform,
particularly Linux and Unix exposure.   If I can find a half a dozen
people down here that think this is a good idea who as a minimum can
install and somewhat use one distro or another, we'll try to start a
group.
 
Is there anyone who would be interested in helping out from up there,
just being on the mailing list and offering their two cents, that would
be awesome.  Please drop me a line.
 
 
Greg

Sounds like that means we've got just a little longer to convert

My dad went to OTI in the 50's. I get down there a couple of times a year, I have

Have fun and don't hurt anyone.

Is xman installed in the default system of most distributions? Is
/usr/share/doc/ stuffed with the documents that come with the packages, a
default also? I haven't used any other distributions but the one I use for a

Just wanted to report that I finally got around to plugging in the USB
flash/smartmedia reader into my linux box and it works like a charm.
I got this at the first of the year, a store brand out at ChumpUSA,
for $29.  I haven't tried hotplugging it yet, although at the rate my
Abit VP6 is freezing, it probably couldn't hurt anything.  

Has anyone else had a borked VP6?  Worked great for 10 months, but the
last few weeks have been so chock full of freezes you could start to
believe GWB had this whole global warming thing right after all.

Subject: [PLUG] ssh and ipfwadm question
Message-ID: <20020426001008.A9339@boxer>

For some time now I had the firewall quite open and I was 
able to ssh into my internal network. But now recently I 
have close it down quite a bit to keep my computers a bit more
 safe. 

The problem I'm facing is that I'm not able to ssh into my 
internal network anymore. So I'm wondering if anybody out there 
knows how to setup the rules to allow me to do this.

And to add the trouble I'm using the "ipfwadm" rules.
Kernel 2.0

				internal ssh(22)
			       |------
	external	-------|     |
eth0(22)|------   eth1 |       |------
--------|	|-------
	|------        |------


I want to ssh through my firewall and to my internal machine.


Anybody got some good rules to do this?


Thanks,


TT

Thank you.  This will solve the issue with the apache server.  I can put
them in order and if they use the ip number then I can have the default go
to a main page of a generic page.

Now I just need to see if proftp has this same ability. I think it does
but I really don't know.

I guess ssh will have the same limitation but that isn't so bad as they
have to have a user account.

Is there a way to limit who can ssh into a box?  That would work.


Thanks for all the answers everyone.  I see this will not be so difficult.
Minus the fact that I think I'll have to add a DNS server to my box also.
That is just to give me more control and flexibility.

I realize I'm jumping into this discussion a bit late, but here are a 
few scattershot suggestions...

a. Have you tried single-quoting the rpm name/number? I just wonder if 
   the shell or rpm is doing odd things with the + character.

   rpm -e 'vnc-server-3.3.3r2+tight1.2.2-1'

b. What does file-list query report?

   rpm -ql vnc-server-3.3.3r2+tight1.2.2-1

c. Do you see anything odd or instructive if you run rpm in 
   ultra-verbose mode?

   rpm -e -vv vnc-server-3.3.3r2+tight1.2.2-1

d. Have you tried the 'allmatches' option?

   rpm -e -vv --allmatches vnc-doc

I am new to the list. I am pondering Linux for my home computer. I am
enjoying reading and learning
from all of you.

I can't speak for any school district at large, but I suspect they would
embrace your help.  They do not know that you are a resource and that you
are so willing to participate. I also believe that many smaller districts do
not have an IT department.  It is probably something that was eliminated
with the many budget cuts recently.  This is one of the reasons the
Microsoft audit is so challenging for schools--we are badly understaffed.

Another thought is the Apple hardware. Early in the technology dance Apple
was the system of choice because they convinced educators they would offer
more educational software. Many districts embraced Apple and many solely use
Apple.  I have wondered if this might be a reason Microsoft is conducting
this audit--to scout out the quantity of Apples still in use? PCs are often
the exception, not the rule in most buildings.

Our school does not have glitzy computers or up to date software. We are
struggling to keep adequate supplies, purchase books, heat the building and
pay staff.   The district (Beaverton) has made 70+ million dollars in cuts
over the past 8 years while enjoying a 30% population growth. Our audits
with Microsoft is only one of our problems.

My teaching assignment is in a school heavily impacted by poverty. About 50%
of the families are living below the poverty line, 30% will move before the
end of the year and over half of them do not speak English as their first
language. (I think the number is 80%, but I can't remember) In most of the
families at this school the parents are struggling to stay alive in a new
country.  For them it means working more than one job and often sharing
living quarters with others. For us at the building level, we do not have a
great number of parents who can come to school as volunteers, fund raise for
new technology equipment, take field trips etc. I believe that schools such
as this would welcome any assistance!

I would be happy to be involved with what you are proposing. Please let me
know how I can help.

Bear in mind that you can specify multiple keyservers in ~/.gnupg/options.
Now I'm getting more verifications.

Huh?  What?  That's not mentioned in the online version of Maximum RPM, in 
the section about 'Additional options to -e'  

see: http://www.redhat.com/docs/books/max-rpm/max-rpm-html/s1-rpm-erase-additional-options.html

But now that you mention it, if I take the time to `man rpm`, instead of running all over the 
Internet to find my documentation there --allmatches is, right in the summary at the top.


So much for man pages being out of date.

I'm not certian if this will work for you but try putting
 audio = mono | stereo | lang1 | lang2
in your .xawtv to set the audio mode for the given channel.
just out of curiosity what tv card are you using?

Exactly.  No one should be fooled into thinking that MS is being nice here.
I guarantee you they have seen our responses, and a big reason for their
delays is to kill our urgency which removes some of our motivation.  We have

The key being to not back down from offering an alternative. I agree with 
others, that you don't want to over-eagerly force something on the school. 
There are legitimate reasons, though, to make the switch on MOST 
computers. Not all, but most. And I think we should most definitely press 
ahead as vigorously, but organized. Find out what the schools want, find 
out what we can offer and present it to them in an organized professional 
manner.

datarate looks decent at 320x240, eats up about a gig an hour, and
averages about 20% CPU, with lows of 8% and highs of 48% on a 1200
Athlon. I've been trying it out as a PVR, and it seems to work fairly
well. For some reason I can't schedule it to record using
/etc/crontab, but using at works. Using crontab it just creates a
zero length file and quits. Now I just need a nice web front end for
it that supports our local channel lineup. I've been trying some of
the front end projects out there, but nothing decent yet.

Subject: [PLUG] GIANT font problem
Message-ID: <3CC98225.7040804@spamcop.net>

Installed debian woody on my laptop and got mozilla running. Quite happy.

Then I did a few things. Most notably, I installed evolution and tried 
to get it working. That brought in a bunch of gnome related stuff.

Then, I started mozilla and something has gone very wrong. I have BIG fonts.

I mean really BIG fonts.

I mean, if I maximize the window to fill my 1024x768 screen, I can see 
the top 2/3 of the letters "Fil" from the "File" prompt on the menu, and 
that's all that fits on the screen.

Any ideas?

Seems to only affect mozilla -- both mail and browser.

All;

If Microsoft's theory of the "Software Ecosystem" is correct (the idea that a benevolent software maker gives back in the form of taxes and charity), then why were they threatening an audit to the school districts instead of helping them?

Can you?  It's not documented in the man page, but I've wondered
about it for a while.  Do you have multiple lines of 'keyserver'
or multiple servers listed on one line?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33L2.0204261000240.14014-100000@dragon.pdx.osdl.net>

Hi,

At home I have 3 computers connected to a LinkSys BEFSR41
cable/DSL router with 4-port switch.

like so:

                                +----- A
                                |
DSL "modem" ----- LinkSys box --+----- B
                                |
                                +----- C

A, B, and C can't communicate directly with each other (i.e.,
on a LAN).  (except via SMTP :)

Is this due to a LinkSys configuration that I can modify?
If not, what do I need to do to enable A, B, and C to be on
a LAN and still have DSL network access?

Thanks,
--

The basic operating algorithm at Microsoft is simple: Microsoft exists
to serve its shareholders, not those who purchase its products and
services.

Of course, that's true at some level for all publicly traded 
companies, but the officers of most companies seem to understand at 
some level that 'customer service' means providing products that make 
life easier for paying customers. IOW, there's a rough equilibrium 
between 'paying' and 'customers.'

Microsoft's execs, on the other hand, baldly equate 'innovation,'
'customer service,' and the like with maximizing profits. For them, 
the emphasis on 'paying customers' is completely on the 'paying.'

I have the 8 port version of the same switch....in the ''advanced'' settings 
you should be able to configure the boxes to see each other and use the DSL 
pipe...
what OS's are you running on the various boxes? (i can help with 
*NIX/Linux/Win)
Are your routes set correctly for the LAN/Internet on the computers? 
Are they dhcp'd?

I initially did also. I just did:

rpm -qf /usr/bin/alternatives

to get back the package that provides the file.

Double check the IP addresses, subnet mask, and default gateway settings on
the 3 computers behind the Linksys.

I have the same model, and the default settings for the LAN settings are

router - (LAN IP settings) 192.168.1.1, 255.255.255.0
client1  192.168.1.x, 255.255.255.0 Default Gateway 192.168.1.1

Okay, I know it sounds funny, but people in my sylpheed addressbook are
complaining that they're receiving spam from me.  At home I only use
sylpheed for email.

I've asked them to send me email headers instead of quoting the body,
so that I can verify that the email really came from me, but in the
meantime, has anyone heard of anything that could infect sylpheed?

I just added another keyserver line.  

DISCLAIMER:
I was aware that Wil's PGP sigs weren't being verified.  Then I saw
his response to Bruce's question. Hmmm, different keyservers.  Quickly
added the line and now I can verify both sets of signatures/keys. Didn't
check the docs, didn't read the HOWTOs, just glanced at the file, 
thought the format was the same as /etc/resolv.conf and gave it a whirl.

YMMV.

I have a couple family members with problems that I gave me an idea.  One PC
has Windows ME pre-installed and for the second time, vital system files
have been hosed and it can't boot up.  They have a CD that came with it that
will restore the hard drive to it's original condition.  This is almost
acceptable except that they will lose all the pictures from the digital
camera they have.  "Backup?  What's that?"  Anyway, I thought a good
solution would be to boot the computer from a bootable Linux CD, bring up
networking and ftp the files to my linux PC.  We both have DSL, so hopefully
they don't have more megs than the bandwidth will allow.  (Of cource, they
have no idea how many megs that would be.)  I downloaded lnx-bbc and burned
it onto a CD.  I can boot a PC with it, but I can't find any doc's on what
networking tools the CD has or how to bring networking up.  I would need
dhcp to get their DSL working.  I also though about using a Redhat install
CD and booting into rescue mode to see if this would work.

I could probable figure out how to bring up networking manually, but I need
to figure out what driver (kernel module, like tulip) they would need for
the network card.  I have read that there is a way to run the hardware
detection software that RH uses in it's installer to find out, but I don't
know how to do this.  If someone has a link to something, I would love to
see it.

Has anyone done anything like this?  It seem like it would be a useful tool
for fixing PC's.  Thanks in advance.

I'm sure something like this exists, but don't know where to look off the
top of my head.  (Tom's Root Boot and variants spring to mind.)

However, since you're talking about a windows machine, I do know where some
nice windows boot disk tools are...

Look at http://www.nu2.nu/bootdisk/modboot/ to check out "Bart's Modular
Boot Disk".

I have boot cd's and floppies built off of this that work great.  DHCP, SMB,
and everything are available.  I believe there's an FTP client in there too,
but I'm not sure.

The funny thing is, this would all be a moot point if Microsoft was forced 
to account for stock options properly. Their stock value would plummet and 
cash on hand couldn't be used to hammer competition.

That has saved me a couple times.  Does it detect NIC's?  Has anyone setup
networking after booting with Tom's boot root?  I was just reading that I
should be able to bring up hdcp by typing "pump" if the correct driver is
loaded.  Has anyone ever tried this?

I also though about demo linux.  Has any used that with networking?

Yes, Tom's does detect most standard Ethernet devices. From there you can either use the standard 'ifconfig' and friends or, if your network has a DHCP, Tom's automatically tries to configure the card for you at startup.

Not I personally. Sorry.

I believe that theory would be correct IF Microsoft paid taxes. 
They don't.

See earlier thread about MS accounting practices and stocks.

I've had really good success with the RH 7.2 Admin CD. It's a pretty 
powerful rescue disk. I think it will boot with the network active. Not 
sure if it has the drivers you need for the Fat32 partition though.

In Alaska, where it gets very cold, pi is only 3.00.  As you know,

Does the contract or agreement between Microsoft and its customers limit

Wow!  That Tom guy is amazing!  I wish I had half his knowledge about Linux.
The lnx-bbc CD I made is supposed to be based on Tom's rtbt, so maybe it
will do that also.  I'll give both a try and see what happens.  I'd really
like to know what programs actually do the work so I could see how to use
them.  I think it would be good to be able to run them and see what they
say.  Nice tool for the toolbox.

Mind-blowingly bad mistake.  

Create a data area that is writable and then make that area non-executable for 
scripts with /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.

I've got applets working beautifully in mozilla.  I downloaded the java SDK (The
JRE would work just as well) from blackdown.  Then I made a link to the SDK
mozilla plugin (/usr/lib/j2sdk1.3/jre/plugin/i386/mozilla/javaplugin_oji.so)
from the mozilla plugin directory (/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/javaplugin_oji.so).
The directories might be changed a little (I use debian, btw.)  If you have a
java plugin, you can find it with "locate java | grep plugin" or similar.

Another secret of mozilla is to type in the location bar "about:plugins".  That
will tell you the details of all the plugins you're using.  There's also a
mozilla easter egg if you type in "about:mozilla" (works on later netscapes
too.)

And finally, if you have plugins that work in netscape, you can link them into
the mozilla plugins directory if you want to handle certain files (I can now
handle realplayer files and flash in mozilla since I learned this trick.)

For reference, the following are debian sources for the blackdown SDK packages.
They go in /etc/apt/sources.list.
deb ftp://ftp.tux.org/pub/java/debian woody non-free
deb ftp://ftp.nluug.nl/pub/os/Linux/java/jdk/debian woody non-free

Hi Sean,

Any luck with this problem?  I have the same card and the same problem.  NBC
(8) is at least one channel where I get it.  I found that Andy's suggestion to
try changing the "audio" paramter in XawTV did not seem to help.

I've checked 5 or 6 RBL's and have been unable to verify the existence of

Any other SpamAssassin users seeing this?  Or is it a false positive.

No, no change. Channel 8 still has that annoying looping message, and
channel 4 has no audio. Channel 10 works normally most of time, then

Preston has the right approach in mind.  Sendai, there is NO ONE being fooled.
Trust me on this one.

There was an emergency, now there is not. The basic problem remains, but
the timelines are more managable.

>From my perspective, the worse-case scenerio would have been that the
schools were forced into converting everything over to Linux overnight.
It would have been a huge, disruptive disaster. But they were WILLING AND
PREPARED to do it if they must.

Now the schools have some time to work all of this out. They now need to
reflect on what their needs are, how much risk they are willing to tolerate,
how they should best allocate their precious resources.

Our job, as a community, is no longer to bail the schools out of an 
emergency situation. Sure, it would have made great press and would have
been a facinating endever, but it would not have been in ANYONE's long-term
best interest.

Our job, as a community, is now to help the schools strech their budgets,
mitigate risks, and make sound, rational decisions on the use of technology.
This is not the stuff of national headlines, it is the stuff of long-term,
healthy education.

It's time to stop thinking about this particular battle, shift your 
thoughts to winning the war.

But let's discuss it at another time. It's been a LONG WEEK and I for
one need some sleep ;-)

Message-ID: <003e01c1edb5$e3b2bd90$6401a8c0@endeavor>

Although I can't speak for the model 600...

I have a newly purchased IBM A30 Thinkpad (p3-1ghz/30gb/ATI Radeon
Mobility) and it runs Redhat 7.2 great.  There were some minor tweaks I
had to do such as compiling an audio driver, but it's fine.

My wife's Thinkpad 770x (P2-300mhz/8gb/Trident, I think) runs 7.2 great
as well.  No problems with any configuration other than audio is
unsupported, I did not spend much time searching for a workaround
driver.

Laptops can be refurbished for many reasons.  Even the most sturdy can
still get dropped from a significant height onto a hard floor, be on the
receiving end of java transfers -- and I mean liquid cofee here -- and a
whole host of other things that desktop systems aren't subject to.  We
are VERY pleased with the construction of ours, especially when compared
with the Dell's - which are fine until it comes to the construction.
The hinges and dual locking mechanisms are much better.  Regardless of
what OS they are put on, and whether it's used or not, those are nice
things to keep in mind.

On the downside, it's easier to stay up too damn late working on a
project while your wife sleeps next to you in the bedroom - courtesy of
a long RJ45 cable or wireless PCMCIA :)  "OK, hon, I'll send this and
put it away..."

I am thinking about buying a refurbished Thinkpad 600 to use as a linux

many of these refurbished systems around. Does anybody have one. Are

Has anyone successfully installed this on linux.  I've tried the RC1
version and the latest stable build, but neither run when I click on the
installed binary file.  I've also tried the gtk 1.2 and 2.0 versions. 
I'm running Redhat 7.2.

I had this problem earlier after I installed and ran Ximian's evolution.
The fonts became gigantic in Mozilla and the form layout on webpages
became screwed up in both galeon and mozilla, but not konqueror.

I'm not sure how this problem resolved itself; I recall switching to
konqueror for a few days and when I tried mozilla again (perhaps after
apt-upgrading) the fonts were back to normal. However, I just now tried
running evolution again and the font problem is back. Restarting X didnt'
seem to help.

I am also running Debian woody, w/enlightenment. Hope this info helps
some.

PS: Does anyone know how to configure tinting in the Eterm
configuration file? I'm trying to configure Eterm so that each
terminal is tinted with a random color when Eterm is invoked.
I know Eterm can be run with the --tint <color> option, and I know
how to use the %random() function, but does anyone know how tinting
is stipulated in the Eterm user.cfg file?

Thanks

Tyler

Along these lines, I just saw on the news stands that Money magazine had
an article about MS's accounting. You can read the article at

(While not at all concerned with his points, this article sets out a few

I am trying to set up my mailserver to server my new domain name.  I
have added the line

successfully to virtusertable and it works. However, when I try and add
something new to the file and then run make, it reports:

This is simply not true.  Why does it tell me this?  How do I add an
entry to this file and then get make to recognize that I have indeed
changed the file?

Ever thought about using Postfix instead?  It's better all around.

Anywho...  I believe that you need to run this command to rebuild the
virtusertable db:

makemap hash virtusertable < virtusertable

Copy of my response to someone affected by the latest Microsoft Outlook
worm. If you get the chance to read about it (info below) it is a rather
cleverly crafted worm. (has its own SMTP engine, randomly permuted subject
line; encrypted; makes recipient of first message the sender of the next
one, etc).

Its frustrating to know the virus is using my email address even though
I was never infected with it.

Corey -

I didn't actually send the worm to you; someone had both your name and my
name in his Microsoft address book. The worm takes these addresses and
randomly places them in the To and From fields of outgoing
Microsoft Outlook messages. Messages have probably been sent with your
name in the To: field as well.

Someone we both know uses Microsoft Outlook and clicked on the message,
no idea who it actually was. I don't use Microsoft stuff so its
unlikely the worm was sent from me directly.

Tyler

More Info:

http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.klez.h at mm.html
---------------------------------
When this worm is executed, it does the following:

It copies itself to \%System%\Wink<random characters>.exe.

NOTE: %System% is a variable. The worm locates the Windows System folder
(by default this is C:\Windows\System or C:\Winnt\System32) and copies
itself to that location.

It adds the value

Wink<random characters> %System%\Wink<random characters>.exe

to the registry key

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

or it creates the registry key

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Wink[random
characters]

and inserts a value in that subkey so that the worm is executed when you
start Windows.

The worm attempts to disable on-access virus scanners and some previously
distributed worms (such as W32.Nimda and CodeRed) by stopping any active
processes. The worm removes the startup registry keys used by antivirus
products and deletes checksum database files including:

    * Anti-Vir.dat
    * Chklist.dat
    * Chklist.ms
    * Chklist.cps
    * Chklist.tav
    * Ivb.ntz
    * Smartchk.ms
    * Smartchk.cps
    * Avgqt.dat
    * Aguard.dat

Local and Network Drive copying:
The worm copies itself to local, mapped, and network drives as:

    * A random file name that has a double extension. For example,
Filename.txt.exe.
* A .rar archive that has a double extension. For example,
Filename.txt.rar.


Email:
This worm searches the Windows address book, the ICQ database, and local
files for email addresses. The worm sends an email message to these
addresses with itself as an attachment. The worm contains its own SMTP
engine and attempts to guess at available SMTP servers.

The subject line, message bodies, and attachment file names are random.
The From address is randomly-chosen from email addresses that the worm
finds on the infected computer.

The worm will search files that have the following extensions for email
addresses:

    * mp8
    * .exe
    * .scr
    * .pif
    * .bat
    * .txt
    * .htm
    * .html
    * .wab
    * .asp
    * .doc
    * .rtf
    * .xls
    * .jpg
    * .cpp
    * .pas
    * .mpg
    * .mpeg
    * .bak
    * .mp3
* .pdf


In addition to the worm attachment, the worm also may attach a random file
from the computer. The file will have one of the following extensions:

    * mp8
    * .txt
    * .htm
    * .html
    * .wab
    * .asp
    * .doc
    * .rtf
    * .xls
    * .jpg
    * .cpp
    * .pas
    * .mpg
    * .mpeg
    * .bak
    * .mp3
* .pdf


As a result, the email message would have 2 attachments, the first being
the worm and the second being the randomly-selected file.

The email message that this worms sends is composed of "random" strings.
The subject can be one of the following:

    * Undeliverable mail--"[Random word]"
    * Returned mail--"[Random word]"
    * a [Random word] [Random word] game
    * a [Random word] [Random word] tool
    * a [Random word] [Random word] website
    * a [Random word] [Random word] patch
    * [Random word] removal tools
    * how are you
    * let's be friends
    * darling
    * so cool a flash,enjoy it
    * your password
    * honey
    * some questions
    * please try again
    * welcome to my hometown
    * the Garden of Eden
    * introduction on ADSL
    * meeting notice
    * questionnaire
    * congratulations
    * sos!
    * japanese girl VS playboy
    * look,my beautiful girl friend
    * eager to see you
    * spice girls' vocal concert
* japanese lass' sexy pictures


The random word will be one of the following:

    * new
    * funny
    * nice
    * humour
    * excite
    * good
    * powful
    * WinXP
    * IE 6.0
    * W32.Elkern
    * W32.Klez.E
    * Symantec
    * Mcafee
    * F-Secure
    * Sophos
    * Trendmicro
* Kaspersky


The body of the email message is random.

If the message is opened in an unpatched version of Microsoft Outlook or
Outlook Express, the attachment may be automatically executed. Information
about this vulnerability and a patch are available at

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-020.asp

Virus Insertion:
This worm inserts the virus W32.Elkern.4926 as a file with a random name
in the \%Program Files% folder and executes it.

NOTE: %Program Files% is a variable. The worm locates the \Program Files
folder (by default this is C:\Program Files and copies the virus to that
location.

Subject: [PLUG] Printing question for non-Linux users
Message-ID: <1019953811.12691.45.camel@Dustpuppy>

Just a real quick question for those running *BSD or any of the
commercial UNIX variants - What are the typical/default permissions on
the print queue?  Is it typically possible (at least in theory) to view
items in the queue?  I have a Linux box myself, so I can check that, but
I don't currently have access to any *NIX boxes, so I'm limited in that
regard.

The reason for my inquiry is that I'm involved in a course of study that
includes security.  One of the attacks that was described involved the
print queue, & I have my questions about how feasible this particular
attack would be.

I *really* don't want to know any details about anyone's setup, just
what the defaults usually are - or even just some well-reasoned
discussion on the subject.

Many thanks,

T.

I setup a k12ltsp server at work and I plan on using it for our employees
in our call center (they have very limited software needs so this will be
a good testing ground).  I've been testing things and I keep encountering
random problems with the mouse/keyboard within KDE.  Sometimes I can no
longer click on anything.  The only way to get out is to
Ctrl-Alt-Backspace to kill the X session.  This seems to happen most often
when clicking the Logout button on the taskbar, I can't click anything
else or use any keyboard keys (except Ctrl-Alt-Backspace) to complete the
logout process.

The hardware is fairly simple:  Serial mouse, P-133MHz, 64MB RAM, 1MB
Video card.

Here's what I get in .xsession-errors after logging in:

I use easystreet as well and am very happy with their "enthusiast" service.

http://www.easystreet.com/services/easydsl/enthusiast.html

With this you can set up your own server with a static IP address, NAT 
is OK with them and unless you ask for help they leave you alone. They 
charge a one time $50 fee to register a domain name with their DNS 
servers (to point hostnames towards your static IP addresses on their 
DNS servers) and you can run a mail server at home, with a fall back to 
their mail server in case your DSL line goes down, like for example if 
your son unplugs your phone cord.;)

I suspect it costs a bit more than some other ISP's but I'm not sure as 
I havn't shopped around after signing up with them.

Message-ID: <NMEPJGMCLGBMCOCPJFHKCEPODGAA.kens@cad2cam.com>

The permission on the cgi-bin directory should allow the apache user
permission to execute the script.  The apache user is either nobody or
apache depending on your distribution.  You can do this various ways, but
two of them is either change the owner of the script to the apache user or
change the group of the script to the group the apache user is in.  Make the
directory r-xr-x--- apache apache . . .  As to working with the scipts you
can su to the apache user and do your work, or change the owner, work,
change it back for testing.

As for writing to the disk you can manage that with permissions, too, if you
remember who is executing the program.  Use the http.conf file to configure
you directories.  You can use the .htaccess file, but if you are writing to
a directory some wise guy will overwrite the file.  That is, of course, if
you had not set the permissions to read-only before you opened your server.

Subject: [PLUG] Helpdesk software
Message-ID: <1019968596.13071.53.camel@Dustpuppy>

Hi all,

  Just wondering if anyone can point me in the direction of a good
helpdesk software package?  Free or cheap is best, although if the
features warrant it, I may be able to push a P.O. through.  I'm afraid I
don't yet know everything that I may need (although inventory & issue
tracking are at the top of the list).  

If I wind up getting this job, I'll be going into a company that doesn't
yet have anything like this, so I'm hoping to set that up as one of the
1st things I do. (As you can probably see, I'm trying to get a jump on
things so I can "hit the ground running" if they do decide to bring me
aboard. Perhaps I'm being premature, but I'd rather err in this
direction.)

I've tried using Google to search the PLUG archives, but I've not yet
found anything useful.

Many thanks,
 
TK

Thanks Russ, I was just looking at that (after removing

that someone here is using that successfully.

*Thanks* for the feedback!

It isn't clear which PCC campus you're near, but if you're in Verizon
territory, we (QCSN) can provide DSL: http://www.qcsn.com/dsl.html

We provide a static IP address and no real restrictions, other than
asking that you not run commercial sites off it.

I'm going to address this thread in a round-about fashion.

I want to publicly thank Terry for the work he's done over the last few
years. Terry helped found the K12Linux project many years ago (1998?).
Among his many contributions, he gave an intro to Linux class at our first
big event. Many of the IT managers of schools being audited were there.
They remember it. 

Media frenzy events like the one we just saw are great for raising awareness,
but in the big picture it doesn't really make a difference. It's being there
year after year, showing progress step by step, that is the driving force
behind world dominiation ;-)

Paul Nelson and I are working on trying to bridge the gap between the 
tech community and the needs of schools. I'm pretty much booked for the
week, so I don't know if we'll have anything put together for Thursday's
PLUG meeting. At the very minimum we can have a short question and answer
session at the begining of the meeting. It's the chinese curse: may you
live in interesting times!

My portscan detector has been reporting a ridiculous number of portscans 
today, over 3000 and all apparently originating on my subnet.  Also all 
broadcast portscans.  Coming from a variety of ips, which is what you'd 
expect if several dozen machines have been infected.  I know there's a new 
winblows bug out there (klez.h or some such), but I haven't found any 
mention of portscanning as a side effect.  Is there some other worm 
out there?

Subject: [PLUG] Helpdesk software

Hi all,

  Just wondering if anyone can point me in the direction of a good
helpdesk software package?  Free or cheap is best, although if the
features warrant it, I may be able to push a P.O. through.  I'm afraid I
don't yet know everything that I may need (although inventory & issue
tracking are at the top of the list).  

If I wind up getting this job, I'll be going into a company that doesn't
yet have anything like this, so I'm hoping to set that up as one of the
1st things I do. (As you can probably see, I'm trying to get a jump on
things so I can "hit the ground running" if they do decide to bring me
aboard. Perhaps I'm being premature, but I'd rather err in this
direction.)

I've tried using Google to search the PLUG archives, but I've not yet
found anything useful.

Many thanks,
 
TK

yes, the virus is network capable, and will attempt to
find open ports on which to send itself.  also, it
will infect any mapped drives as well.  for full
details go to www.symantec.com/avcenter.

www.aracnet.com (aka spiritone) is one possibility.

(Yes, newlines are *legal* in filenames.  Caveat Executor.)

Perl, of course, handles this stuff with ease, and no whitespace worries.

Which is what I use. They've had their share of problems in the past (mostly
during the transition after they were acquired by Spirit One), but have been
running smoothly for many months (no outages that I've noted). DSL pricing
is here:

    http://www.aracnet.com/adsl/adsl_regpricing.html

I've got 128k/1.5Mbs, which is perfectly ample for my low traffic web site
(http://herring.org/usage/). They have a one-time charge for enabing your
virtual domain (some ISPs charge monthly), and no restrictions for
reasonable use of NAT and servers on your DSL line.

I've got my virtuals set so that any email coming to my domain that

(I've got a "@domain.com  rob" at the bottom of my virtuals file)

I recently started getting spam on a certain name at domain.com address,
and I'd like this to bounce back.  Is there a way to tell postfix to
bounce that address, but let others thru?

Subject: [PLUG] Warning About SuSE 8
Message-ID: <gvar7f.kdp@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

As a Linux newbie (2 years of frustration now) I decided to try the new 
SuSE 8.0 distribution.  I last tried SuSE 7.2 and found it the best Linux I 
had ever used, but gave it up for Red Hat 7.2 because I could not get it to 
work right with my network, and standard Linux commands never worked right. 
The configuration menus were a real pain too.

So we arrive at today. SuSE 8.0 installed alright, easily in fact.  Weird 
though, it does not install a number of programs any newbie would normally 
use by default, so I choose them individually.  Among them Netscape 6.2, CD 
burning software, and Mozilla mail (even though Mozilla browser is there, 
by default they leave out the mail program!?).

I thought I had modem installation and internet access down to a science 
now, even in Linux, but the new SuSE has proven me wrong.  In Red Hat my 
modem is found under /dev/tty/S4.  The new SuSE only goes as far as /S3 and 
even if I manually enter /S4 it will not work.  No amount of experimenting 
with settings was able to produce a recognizable modem. I went through 
every  listed setting. So no internet access.

I gave up on that and decided to now try the CD burning program, but found 
it is as defective as any other Linux CD Burner program I have ever (not 
been able to) use(d). It also detected my scanner automatically, but 
whenever I click on anything to do with the scanner, nothing happens.  At 
least with Red Hat, it scans an image, lets me look at it, and then refuses 
to save it!

SuSE 8.0 does have some nice new screen backrounds, but the fonts and menus 
are typical Linux at its worst or near worst. I don't feel like wasting 
time fiddling with it since it is probably the best it can ever be and I 
will probably reinstall the whole mess again hoping it might, God willing, 
detect the modem next time.

Although I spent the week hating Microsoft and hoping all the school 
districts would ban new Windows purchases and get Linux instead, I now am 
spending the weekend greatfull that a company like Microsoft provides an 
operating system that actually works right out of the box.

As my tolerance for pain increases in the following weeks I'll be back here 
asking more questions as I enter week 6 of trying to get Red Hat Linux 
Samba to work, as well as CD burning, scanning, and font adjustment.

Hmm, it didn't appear to work for me. When I added 

  "keyserver certserver.pgp.com"

to my .gnupg/options file, gpg (appears to anyway) only pull from the
last one specified. For example, I tried to verify a recent message sent
to the CRIME list. The first time I read it, it said it couldn't find
the key on certserver.pgp.com. Then I commented that line out, and the
next time I read it, it was able to pull the key [1] from wwwkeys.us.pgp.net
(my default keyserver). Gnupg 1.0.6, FWIW.

[1] Well, a key, anyway. The message didn't verify correctly for me. :-)

Subject: [PLUG] Setting up XFree86 with SiS 6326
References: <1012286630.1328.9.camel@reepicheep> <20020129145022.E12018@rheingold.nakedape.priv> <3C5E2367.5060106@pacifier.com>
Message-ID: <3CCC6B84.7DAFE877@teleport.com>

I recently installed XFree86 4.0.1, and used the X configurator to generate XF86Config, but the
resulting configuration has lots of
problems.  I'm using a SiS 6326 card.

The only way I can run X in a usable state is by keeping to 8-bit mode; even then the cursor appears
only as a square filled with
random B/W pixels, and after a while of running X, rectangular chunks of windows start appearing in
weird places, and I finally have
to shut it down.

Below is the XF86Config file.  If anyone has any suggestions, I would love to hear them. (BTW, this
is the machine that I wanted to
bring to the Linux Clinic last Saturday, which was cancelled.)

Thanks

I'm sorry to hear about your poor ecperineces with Linux. It took me quite a 
while to get any good at installing it, too. There is a lot of things that good 
installations depend on, and I made/make them too. The sesktop is the hardest 
place to make it install well. I have had great experiences with it on a laptop 
even, so I know the later distros can go well.

If you've got specific problems, please be sure to post your issues right away, 
and that could reduce the frustration factor, it does for me. Once in a while I 
get trashed by someone who knows that the answer is in the man page, but not 
often.

Hang in there, it's worth it. Not only do you get a great OS, but it's free, M$ 
doesn"t profit from it AND you'll be able to help others switch over to an OS 
that doesn't require you to just shut it all down to see how fast the machine 
will reboot...

Do you really mean /dev/tty/S4? or /dev/ttyS4? I have a running SuSE 
7.2 system and the devices run /dev/ttyS0 through /dev/ttyS23. There is 
no /dev/tty/S4 unless this is some new Linux Standard's Base thing that 
newer versions of SuSE have adopted. I've got a copy of SuSE 8.0 on 
order but I haven't received it yet.

Good advice, everything still works.

Maybe something I don't understand about su.  When I went from root to apace 
with su, it still identified me as root, not that it matters much

You mean something like this:
 <Directory /usr/local/apache/htdocs/somedir>
                Options +ExecCGI
        </Directory>

Don't follow this.

I'll be composing tex files and converting them to pdf.  Should I do that in 
some directory owned by apache marked: rw-rw----?  It is true isn't it that 
dirctories outside the directory root tree will not be served up by apache.  

Suppose typical html files are in html, which is owned by apache and marked 
r-xr-x---, how can a script executing as apache write a pdf file there?

When I look at this newsgroup in KNode the older messages are no longer
available, even though I accessed them before.  I have all the settings set
to save messages for 5000 days, so I would expect them to be there.

In W2K OE 6 I still have all the messages.

You can get out of the tree by creating links to other places.

Bingo.  You will need to change the directory permission to drwxr-x---.

SuSE 8.0 default install with office assumes you will use KDE 3.0 and that
comes with Konqueror and Kmail.  The reason Mozilla is installed is so that you
can chose to use the geeko engine if you like and the mozilla plugins. Netscape
6.2 is really Mozilla with marketing.

As noted in other posts, you seem to be making some mistake in posting or
configuration. In Yast2 that is a hardware icon that will probe your hardware
and give you a very nice read out. You can use this to find your modem
settings.

As you don't say what CDBurner program you are using there isn't anyway to know
what your issue is. I assume you read the manual on setting up an IDE cdrom, if
you are using one. The SuSE manual is one of the best parts of the
distribution. At $40 a crack, I would get my money's worth and read it.

Click, click, click, and nothing happens. I assume you're venting frustration
here and not really looking for help. If you are looking for help, some more
information will be needed.

I think you will be wasting your time reinstalling in hopes of finding your
modem. Since you bought the distribution you should use the install support
that came with it. I have found the SuSE support helpful and timely in the two
cases were I needed it.

What this really means, is that Mircosoft had the money, or market share to
make the hardware vendor supply the hardware documentation or write a driver
that worked.

Linux has neither and so hardware support is not universal and sometimes even
the best installer fails on supported hardware. 

We all have bad installs. I spent Friday night trying to Win2K on a box and
that install was unsuccessful. The box would take Win98se and XP but not W2K. I
of course, bought W2k for it, not either of the others, so I was very unhappy.
What can you do? Relax and make lemonade is all. 


Thank you

I've had another problem: When I print from kdvi it doesn't print the top of

Is there a chance that Knode only download's the message headers and 
doesn't actually download the message content until you select a 
message to read? I used to see this same behavior with KNode all of the 
time with @Home as they seemed to expire messages after about 1 week on 
their news server.

References: <E171xug-0008Iz-00@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>
Message-ID: <3CCC9433.BD6A5D58@teleport.com>

(Last time I tried to send this, Netscape "base64'd" it, so I'm trying it again as
plain text.)

I recently installed XFree86 4.0.1, and used the X configurator to generate
XF86Config, but the resulting configuration has lots of problems.  I'm using a
SiS 6326 card.

The only way I can run X in a usable state is by keeping to 8-bit mode; even
then the cursor appears only as a square filled with random B/W pixels, and
after a while of running X, rectangular chunks of windows start appearing in
weird places, and I finally have to shut it down.

Below is the XF86Config file.  If anyone has any suggestions, I would love to
hear them. (BTW, this is the machine that I wanted to bring to the Linux Clinic
last Saturday, which was cancelled.)

The trouble with posting more details is I could spend all day writing down
error messages or steps I took to get nowhere.  After hours of frustration
with Linux I do what most people do and give up.  More people have tried
Linux then stick with it. The last thing I will do after a few late night
hours of frustration while trying to scan a picture is log onto a newsgroup.
I went to bed instead.  The next night I scanned in Windows 98 and thanked
God for Bill Gates. I also put Linux away for a month.

I did spend some more time with SuSE 8.0, nearly 6 hours now, and I now say
it is the absolute worst Linux I have ever used.  It absolutely refuses to
detect my modem, refuses to link up with my network printer, and is
generally useless.  In my opinion it is a degraded version of 7.2.  Since
the older version worked fine with my computer modem and the new version
can't even detect it, what else am I supposed to say?  I like Debian much
better.  It refused to install on my computer so I never wasted hours trying
to configure it.  SuSE should have had the grace to do the same.

As for SuSE help, one of the things that made me go to Red Hat 7.2 was that
after months of trying to get SuSE 7.2 to work with my network, I decided
that instead of just reading portions here and there of the supplied "SuSE
Linux 7.2 Network" book, I would read it from the beginning, cover to cover.
In the beginning I found the following description of the book:  "Although
installation support is extensive, any network setup is not included."  In
other words, it a damn book on theory, not actual practice. It lacks actual
setup procedures for networks.  I should have known better than spend any
more money on 8.0 or waste my time trying to set it up.

Most people just give up.  I stuck it out with Linux, and get frustrated as
hell trying to get it to work. If I was doing it all for fun I could
probably post every error message or click that did nothing.  But I was
relying on it, making it all the more frustrating when it doesn't work.

I am putting Linux away now.  I am not sure when I will want to boot into it
again. I am limiting myself to Windows for the rest of the day so I can have
a restful nights sleep. Linux will have to wait a few weeks or until I get
some fresh enthusiasm.

Messages I read before are gone now too, and I can't even get them from the
server.  Weird.  Essentially I have it set so they should never expire, yet
they are gone.  I still see the headers just fine, it's the messages that I
can't get.

We use RT, too. The web interface is a mite pokey on an older machine,

I remember writing the info file for majordomo back when Sean Utt was 
hosting the list. Past that, I don't remember writing a FAQ ... though 
anything's possible :-)

I'm in this XML/XSLT mode lately, so I'll pitch in my $0.02: have 
submissions in XML format. Make a simple plug-faq DTD (so pgsml mode 
in emacs can do auto-completion and validation :-) and have all 
entries in that format, e.g.,

<plug-faq>
  <qa>
    <question>What's the best *nix tex editor?</question>

    <answer>
      <para>This question could also be asked as, "Besides asking
      about which Linux distribution is best, what's the best way
      to get PLUG off-track?"</para>
      <para>Seriously, regardless of your ultimate preference, it's
      good to know your way around both <command>vi</command> and
      <command>emacs</command>, as both will be on just about any
      Linux or *BSD you're likely to encounter.</para>
      ...
    </answer>
  </qa>
</plug-faq>

My hunch is that a fairly small subset of the DocBook tagset would 
suffice for all of the formatting we'd in the <answer> section.

Formatting the various .xml files could be handled with a small XSL
stylesheet and a decent XSLT app like Sablotron or Xalan.

The nice thing about handling it this way is that the output fomrat is 
completely divorced from the source document. There could be one 
stylesheet for HTML output, one for text output (suitable for e-mail), 
and perhaps one for PDF (in case someone wanted to print it).

I don't know if this is the best way, or the most elegant way, but it 
was a knee jerk reaction to a bunch of mail being sent to a non-existant 
user named brubas on my postfix system and it works.

I put a header_checks entry in the main.cf file:

header_checks = /etc/postfix/header_checks

Then in the header_checks file I have things I would like to match and 
reject like this:

/^[Tt][Oo]: brubas@*/ REJECT

then run "postmap /etc/postfix/header_checks"

and anything that comes in with a header matching a regular expression 
in the header_checks file will effectively be rejected. (In this case 
anything to the non-existant user brubas)

The header_checks file is also useful for matching other things.

If there is a more elegant solution I would love to hear about it.

I tried that in rh52, using the latest gnupg, but it didn't work.
However, I don't seem to get any complaints from the system using the
same gnupg under rh72.

My options file:
keyserver certserver.pgp.com
keyserver wwwkeys.eu.pgp.net

Perhaps before I tried: keyserver certserver.pgp.com wwwkeys.eu.pgp.net

Robert,
At first I thought that you're just a man who needs some help with Linux and 
who is willing to study and learn the system.
I could help you with SuSE 'cause it's my favorite distro.
Now it appears that you're just a hopless hysterical whiner and troll.
Say thanks one more time to your god Bill Gate$  and get your dirty ass off 
this list.
Linux is not for a such shamefull dork like you.
I'm blocking you forewer from my mailbox
Hope other PLUG'ers will do the same.

Not having a clue, it doesn't look like to me, that you will catch brubas on cc
and bcc. It also doesn't look like to me, that you will catch it if another
email address is first.

Thank you

Suse has changed their system lay out alot.
Once installed, you need to go to the directory /etc/sysconfig/network
and look through it. See if you find the config file. Open in an editor
and see if the modem line is in there.

Hope this will get you started with Suse 8.0 if you desire to try again.

Patience with any distro is golden!

I don't have a problem getting help from the Linux experts or enthusiasts in
this newsgroup.  They do everything they can to help and have even
reconfigured their computers to reproduce the problems I have. Now that's a
devotion to teaching Linux.

Linux newbie's who are also anti-Microsoft seem to be the only ones to flame
me so far. I like Windows. That does not make me a troll. It just means they
are over sensitive in their hatred of Microsoft or their love of Linux,
either of which is not healthy.

I won't block you because you said I only "appear" to be a "whiner and
troll," which is not as bad as what was said before. You also seem a bit
emotional about Bill Gates costing you $.  I can understand that and
sympathize. I have had plenty of bad Microsoft days.

I apologize to the rest of the Linux group for being grumpy and wasting
bandwidth today. Six hours of Linux configuration problems took its toll.

Robert

I sat here and watched this exchange develop, and frankly, you come
off like a troll.

You post to a Linux mailing list, you complain that Linux doesn't
work, is hard to use, and doesn't recognize your hardware. You
proclaim that Windows is your salvation, and thank Bill for doing
something the Linux developers evidently can't  do.

You don't offer any specific details, and you don't ask for any
help. You don't seem interested in resolving any of the issues,
and apparently are only interested in flaming SuSE.

If your post wasn't a troll, then what was the point?

I think that SuSE 8.0 hates my modem so I've fired it for now.  To further
complicate the issue my modem settings in Red Hat 7.2 are /ttyS4 and in the
previous SuSE 7.2 were /ttyS2.  I tried every default setting listed today
and none worked.  It reminded me of the first few times I installed Linux
(on a previous computer) and couldn't get the modem to work because it was a
winmodem.

I might try installing it on my Dell, which liked Red Hat 7.2, but spit at
every other version I tried.  If all else fails I will just stick to Red
Hat.  The main advantage to these other Linux versions is they teach me
something new to do in Red Hat that I would not otherwise have known.

I checked out a SuSE newsgroup today and didn't see anyone else with a modem
problem. I'll wait a few days to see if anyone finds something wrong with
the default install.  It's just too strange that it does not detect the
modem at all.

To the Unhappy Person who obviously dislikes me:

Now I have 12 new subscription confirmation requests for misc garbage in my
mail box.  You even bothered to look up my address and personal information
for this.

But now it is time to take a step backward and relax.

I don't want subscriptions to the govindastore group hosted by Yahoo!
Groups, a FREE trial subscription to Six-Figure Income Magazine, Buzzine.com
"Here's a copy of your subscription data:" whatever that is, Focalex FREE
email subscriptions to Magmall Newsletter Special Offers Internet Shopper
Gambling Consumer Electronics Credit Cards Home Based Office
Freeware/Shareware Health Sports Travel Music Movies/Videos Computer
Hardware Webmasters
Special Offers Affiliates College Online Trading, or any of the others.

Subscribing me to Republican Party updates was cute, but the senior citizen
food order site order was a bit over the top and I hope it does not cost
them any money.

This is the worst attack anyone on the internet has ever launched at me,
even worse than the infamous Kadaitcha Man and his brand of personal
attacks. At least he kept it in the newsgroup.

Since you probably used Linux for this attack, congratulations, you are now
a Linux Terrorist!  I hope you are proud of yourself.

It has not been a good day for Linux.

Is there anyway you can send me (off-list perhaps) a copy of the output of 
'dmesg'? and also whether the modem is an internal or external modem?
and maybe even the output of 'lspci'? and a number 4 super-sized with a diet 
coke?

I'd like to help.

Subject: [PLUG] Something Neat
Message-ID: <3CCD6B0C.1000306@sun.com>

Here's something I hacked up over the weekend that I thought was rather useful.

On the desktop, my family for the most part uses M$ products.  Shameful, yes I 
know, but when you want to play games, it's what ya gotta use.  Anyway, for 
internet connectivity, we have a dial-up modem.  Said modem is on a Debian box 
running pppd.  It's also on a phone line that we get most of our incoming 
calls, and frequenly disconnects due to call waiting beeps or random line 
noise.  Frustrating, to say the least.  Yes, I've tried to get DSL and/or 
Cable, neither can install to me - I'm in one of those 'grey' zones between 
CO's, I guess.

So for a while I've been ssh'ed into my box, and I monitor the connection via 
tail -f'ing the ppp.log.  But, I found this to be irksome, so I cobbled 
together a script that grabs some pertinent data from that log and drops it 
into a small file that I have on my intranet webserver.  It greps the connect 
speed of the link when it's up (via the ip-up.d scripts in ppp), and the time 
of disconnect when it's down (via the ip-down.d scripts).  Then I #include 
that file in a SSI page on my server, and make that page an active desktop 
component on my systems.

It was all pretty simple, and it worked wonderfully.  I felt like sharing this 
morning.  :)

-Richard

This is likely an indication of some hardware misconfiguration: the modem is
not properly configured to be either com2 or com4, but a bit of both. This
may also explain why Linux refuses to work with it: while Windows is often
very forgiving of sloppy hardware, Linux insists that everything is done by
the book. I've seen Linux detect all kinds of hardware misconfiguration
which were unnoticed by Windows. Under Windows, the misconfigured piece of
hardware just works. Sometimes as you add more hardware you get into problems,
like IRQs which should be available really are not.

Well, you obviously DO have a clue. :)

You are right. If you want to catch cc and bcc you would need to add 
another entry in the header_checks or change the regular expression to 
catch "CC: " "BCC: " in addition to just "To: ". But there probably is a 
better way to do this. The problem with my solution is that if the mail 
was also addressed to a valid email address it may get rejected if it 
was also sent to brubas. If you regularly  get email dilivered to a few 
user accounts you don't want to hear about then this works, as it did 
for me and as I suspect it would for Rob who is recieving all email 
addressed to his virtual domain.

The only sender to the brubas account appears to be a spam bot and I 
have gotten hundreds of emails addressed only to "To: 
brubas@<virtualDomain>". The sending machines have been in various 
places accross the internet and I have never seen brubas get a cc: or 
bcc: so I havn't bothered with finding the solution you would use where 
you have more than a handful of users. As much as I like to hear things 
like "Hot babes want to talk with you now!" and "You are a winner!" I 
just assume reject all that email. :)

Is there a way to tell Linux to disconnect and then later reconnect my
eth0 connection.  I've looked through the manuals, but no luck.  Also,
even better, would there be a way to hotplug my eth0 ethernet cable
connection?

I have found some information on why my printer at home stopped working.
I have a cable modem with RH 7.2.  When I use dhcp to connect to the
cable modem my printer stops working.  If I changed network connection
to the current address the printer works ok?  I would like to use dhcp
network connection and my printer at the same time.  Any ideas on how
to get this to work?

Thanks

A cron job should be able to do this (ifconfig eth0 down/up).

You can just pull the cable out of the nic.  You may get a few complaints 
from your mail client (if it's set to auto check for new mail).  When you 
plug the cable back in, you may need to restart your dhcp client (if you 
use that).

PCMCIA nics are hot-pluggable.

  For a one-time deal read the 'at' man page. For a regular action read the
'crontab' man page.

  I'm doing a lot of reading before replacing sendmail with postfix and
initiating my mail server locally. Once the primary mail server is here, I
assume that I do not need to run either POP3 or IMAP. Correct? However, if
the server here is down, then I need to use POP3 or IMAP to retrieve mail
stored on the secondary mail server at our ISP. Correct?

  Trying to fit together all the pieces.

Thanks,

I just noticed the same results with a message posted to another

out, re-opened the message, and it worked with my original
wwwkeys.eu.pgp.net.

Depends on how the ISP has their system configured. Generally it's a
bad idea to have mail stored in more than one location. If they
don't have access to the same mail spool secondary mail servers are 
usually configured to accept mail to store and forward once the primary 
server comes back online.

Not necessarily.  If your ISP sets themselves up as only a secondary
(they configure themselves to accept or relay messages for your
domains but not deliver "locally" [i.e., to your inbox on their
mail servers]), then it will forward messages it had accepted for
your domain when yours comes back up.  (It does it automatically,
but not immediately, because it checks periodically.)

See below for a suggestion for the cursor problem.  That's all I
can take a guess at, not knowing more about your hardware or SiS in
general.  You might also look at /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc/README.SiS
(or run 'locate README.SiS' to find it if it isn't there).
Hm, here's an interesting bit from this file, which,
depending on your screen size, might explain why it'll only
work 8bpp:

      VideoRAM size

            The SiS chips can only directly address 4096K bytes
            of video RAM.  Some video cards using these chips
            are shipped with additional video RAM.  The videoRAM
            must be explicitly limited to 4096 for those cards.
            Attempting to use the additional RAM leads to a variety
            of scrambled screen artifacts.

Try adding here:
    Option "sw_cursor"

and see if that makes your cursor behave better.

john-

  I will ask our ISP to add an MX record so ours is the primary server and
they act as backup. I didn't make myself clear.

This is most unusual.  /dev/ttyS4 would be COM5 in DOS/Windows/BIOS,
which is unusual in PC configurations.

Wil,

  That's what I want. No need to put it in a mailbox there.

  So, running POP3 or IMAP is necessary only when a user's mail is stored on
a remote server and must be retrieved from there for delivery to his/her
local mailbox. Yes?

Thanks,

Rich

Yes.  Well, yes.  It's not quite that simple of an answer, but from
what I think you want to do, it is.

Robert, I'm sorry you took offense at the troll sign.  It just didn't seem
like you were interested in getting help and were more interested in
slamming Linux.  Linux definitely has a lot of room for improvement and
it's getting better each day.  I hope that you keep using Linux and
learning more about it.  There are a lot of knowledgeable people on this
list that would love to help you with Linux, but it also helps everyone
involved if you take a less aggressive stance.

I would love to help with your non-profit... probably even without fee if
I can use you as a reference after the fact.

This is where I usually give my rave about how fantastic Speakeasy is and
all that they have done for me.

They ENCOURAGE running services on the DSL line, happily configure reverse
DNS for your assigned IPs and have options for paying as little money as
possible to the local telco.

You should check the archives for this question to see the full
endorsement because the question comes up every couple of months.

Um, have you just tried putting a *70 (or whatever it is for your telco in
your area) in front of the dialed number to suspend call waiting during
the session?

Just a thought.

I think I have seen it listed as COM5 in the past, somewhere, perhaps in a
program.

But when I check under device manager (in windows xp) it says COM3 as well
as PCI Slot 4 (PCI Bus 0, device 11, function 0).

I/O Range EC00 - EC07

It is a US Robotics 56K Fax PCI.  The motherboard is a FIC AD-11.

I could not find anything about it in the Bios settings.

Thanks
Robert

This is most unusual.  /dev/ttyS4 would be COM5 in DOS/Windows/BIOS,
which is unusual in PC configurations.

I don't know what 'dmesg' and 'lspci' are or where to find them.

Since I can't do anything with the SuSE installation, I don't know how I
could copy it or send it anyway.  Maybe I could sent it from the working Red
Hat installation, but I'm not sure if that would be helpful.

Thanks
Robert

dmesg is a program installed on linux boxes which shows the boot messages, 
which devices are attached, if they're recognized, etc..if it is an internal 
modem in a PCI slot, running the program 'lspci' as root, preferrably...would 
show where the card is installed, etc. like 'ls' for your PCI slots..It 
doesn't matter which distro you use, as long as it's the same machine...

If you are root, both dmesg and lspci should be in your $PATH, dmesg is 
probably available to all users...

The modem is a US Robotics 56K Fax PCI.

The scanner is a HP ScanJet 5200C, but it was using Mandrake 8.2 that I had
file save problem, as well as many others.  In Red Hat the scanner was not
detected by default and I haven't got to even trying to configure it yet.
My latest Mandrake install was such a mess I never even bothered posting
about it. Before I tried Red Hat 7.2 and SuSE 7.2, Mandrake 8.0 was the best
Linux I had ever tried.  I don't know why 8.2 was so different.

I am using the same computer, but something in the two new distros has
changed, and it no longer works properly with my computer.  The motherboard
is a FIC AD-11, if that is any clue.  I did replace the motherboard with a
new one, same make and model, a few months ago due to an unrelated cold boot
problem. I hope there is not some defect there.

Thanks
Robert

Message-ID: <200204292010.g3TKATA25661@microsharp.com>

I have sendmail running and has been working for about a year. Starting 
last month I have had trouble sending to several ISP like aol, 
nwlink, ... The problem appears to be DNS related and is intermittant 
(1 in 10 messages goes through). The error message I get is: 

----- The following addresses had permanent fatal errors -----
<therinda at aol.com <mailto:therinda at aol.com>>

----- Transcript of session follows -----
550 5.1.2 <therinda at aol.com <mailto:therinda at aol.com>>... Host unknown 
(Name server: mailin-01.mx.aol.com.: no data known)

dig MX aol.com does show the mailin-01.mx.aol.com and if I ping it from 
the mail server it usually gives me unknown host. 

I have tried using different DNS hosts and ...

Any susguestion on what I did or what happened and what I need to do 
are appreciated.

obvious that your "System Administrator" does not know enough about Linux to 
configure or trouble shoot it.  Jumping from one distro to another, hoping 
one of them will magically configure everthing for you is not going to 
happen.  I suggest you settle on a distro to learn and then buy a "real book" 
on how to configure that distro.  As an alternative, the online documentation 
is great for learning Linux as well, and you can read it in Windows if you 
like ;-)  The "getting started" books that come with those distributions are 
not adequate for learning everything you need to know, and are not meant to 
be.  They assume you know the basics.  I am sure there are lots of us here 
that are willing to help you set up your system if you take the problems one 
at a time, and supply the necessary info.  But if you don't know how to open 
a terminal and look at a config. file, it is difficult to assist you.  I hate 
to say RTFM, but you have to know some basic bash commands and learn your way 
around the filesystem.  GUI's are nice, but when they don't work, you need to 
know what files to look at, to figure it out.

Send the dmesg output to a text file, copy it to a floppy, open the floppy in 
Windows, cut and paste it to the e-mail message.  There is no such thing as 
"can't do", just a lot of work to make it "can do".

Subject: [PLUG] Printing question for non-Linux users
References: <1019953811.12691.45.camel@Dustpuppy>
Message-ID: <3CCDB368.BD51B731@truedisk.com>

Three main points for print security:

1)  Print queus areas:
    In the past (prior to all these graphical printer config tools),
    my approach used to be:

    drwxrwx---   lp    lp      /var/spool/lp           # directory for all print queues
    drwxrwx---   lp    lp      /var/spool/lp/printer1  #  ... spool area for printer 1
    drwxrwx---   lp    lp      /var/spool/lp/printer2  #  ... spool area for printer 2
          ...    ..    ..      ...                     #  ... etc.   

    Usually this is stricter than the original operating system
    setup.

    I haven't paid too much attention lately (environment doesn't
    have 'hostile' print services users), so I can't speak to the
    configurations used by new systems like 'printconf' and 'CUPS'.

2)  Print Filters:
    Should the print queue call out for a pre- or post-processing
    filter, the filter must be protected from any mischief (i.e. it,
    nor any of it's parent directories, must be writable by any
    non-administrative account).

3)  Network:
    Make sure your system only accepts print requests from allowed
    hosts.  Ways to implement this include /etc/hosts.lpd, TCP wrappers
    (/etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny), and firewall rules.
    I find the denial-of-service problem is sufficiently bad even
    with allowed users. ;-)
    
Hope that helps.

This is very true.  At least, it was for me.
Back in 1993 when I started looking around for a PC based Open Source
Unix this lawsuit was very significant in pushing me to Linux over any
of the BSDs.  My clients were dubious enough about Open Source.  There
was no way on earth they would have considered anything with the letters
"BSD" in it.  Linux really benefited from this.

On the other hand, I don't really think of Linux as the kernel of
some operating system.  I use it as a "marketing buzz word" when I
want to say "Open Source", but realize the public knows something about
Linux and doesn't know much about Open Source.

The GNU license is quite restrictive as you must allow others to
redistribute any modified GNU code that you distribute in most any form.

On the other hand, altho the BSD license is quite free it does have a
couple features or restrictions.  In particular, it requires that the
original authors be given credit for the program and it frees (or at
least trys to free) them from any libility for things that happen as a
result of using the code.

Thus, I'm not sure one can remove copyright statements in BSD licensed
code - altho one should probably add copyright statements for any
modifications.  It isn't fair to credit the original authors with all
the errors in various modifications.

This is a fair statement.  Indeed, it can be entertaining to listen to
the expressions of "brotherly love" between the Free*BSD, the OpenBSD,
and the Net*BSD people.

    I'm forwarding this to the PLUG list and hoping someone gets back to
you.  The other thing you might try is attending the clinic at Riverdale
School on the third Saturday of the month.

                                                       Good luck,
                                                       Dave Mandel

P.S.  Get back to me if none of this helps.

I use EasyStreet (the "enthusiast" package).

  http://www.easystreet.com
  http://www.easystreet.com/services/easydsl/enthusiast.com

They will probably not win the "low bid", but the level of service
(since ~1998-99 for me), has been excellent.  They do an excellent
job of filtering spam from my e-mail.  I do an annual purchase and
get a discount (10%[?]).

I guess the part that I like, is that EasyStreet has a local/regional
mission.  Headquarters are here.  Customer service is here.  And
when I call, I find I'm often already on a firstname basis with the
(competent!) person handling my call.  AFAIK, they do have a low
turnover rate.

One caveat -- I've heard that *all* the local ISP's (EasyStreet,
Aracnet, coho.net, Integra, etc.) have been having problems with
DSL circuits to/from Verizon lately.  The service disruptions are
generally only a few minutes, but aggravating.  EasyStreet's record
of these can be seen at http://support.easystreet.com/System/

The cynical side of me notes these problems crept up at the same time
I starting receiving all the snail-mail promotional materials for
Verizons combined DSL/ISP service.  Methinks the big company is
doing their best to sabotague the local guys.  :-(

The CrossOver Office is a different product than the plugin product
you're referring to, but I wanted to give feedback on the purchased
plugin product anyway:

QuickTime/Windows Media Player Plugins: work very well, few to no flaws
Realplayer plugin: no obvious way to install it, install not automated
like the prior two plugin products.  I will continue to use the
community supported RealPlayer.
Word Doc. Viewer: works great
Powerpoint Viewer: can't view ?#!! with it, garbles the fonts
Overall, I'm glad I bought it because now I can listen to OPB's Windows
Media show "New Dimensions" with John Deloberto. :^o

This is a VERY odd use of the word "restrictive".

You say that the GPL is "restrictive" because it doesn't allow you to
restrict the freedom of the code.

War is peace.
Freedom is slavery.
Ignorance is strength.

Hello Linux folkz,
Is this a good idea to put Firewall, NFS, Database and Web services on
one Linux box or they should be separated?

The Web server part is a database driven interface through persistent
fcgi scripts.
The Database server should be able to operate in a long run with up to
60GB of critical data.
The Firewall should keep in stealth mode all unnessesary ports and
provide masquerading and routing for a small internal network.
The NFS server should export publicly shared data directory to the
internal network.

I proposed this configuration:
A separate Linux box provides firewall/masquerading/routing services.
The second Linux box serves as a NFS, Database and Web server to
generate less network traffic during database queries.

One co-worker proposed less costly alternative to put everything on
one box.

Another one expressed his opinion in separating all services between
four Linux boxes.

Since we are on a tight budget we can't create dedicated data center
for our tasks.

Could somebody enlighten me what are advantages and drawbacks of both
these methods. What is a cheapest variant in this situation.

Thank you in advance.

Alex

  Can someone point me to a document (or just explain to me) the differences
between ntsysv and chkconfig? When would one be used/preferred over the
other?

Thanks,

Well, chkconfig is a command-line editor, whereas ntsysv is a
curses-based editor.

Firewall functions should always (best practice) be on their own box.

The firewall should definitely be a separate box.

For the cost-conscious, the 2-box configuration is adequate.
For reliability and servicabliity, I tend to prefer to have as many
boxes doing as few things as possible.  For example, if you have mail
service and file service running on the same box, you can't take down
one service without taking down both.  (Say, to put more memory in.)

1) Past exposure to IRIX will bias one towards chkconfig. :-)

2) If you need non-interactive behavior (e.g. in scripts),
   chkconfig is a better bet.

3) If you don't already know the service name in advance, then
   ntsysv is better.

4) Terminal-handling problems (terminfo database) can make a
   curses-based package like ntsysv hard to use.  

5) "chkconfig --list" let's you see all services for all levels
   in a single screen. 

IMHO, it all seems to boil down to whether or not you are
familiar with the services and their names.  For me, chkconfig
wins because of #1, #2, and #5 (#4 hasn't been a consideration
lately).

Well, for the sake of reliability, you might want to split them up between 
machines.  Of course, it all depends on what kind of load you'll have, as well 
as what kind of hardware you'll have serving such demands.

What I, personally, would do is split the firewall/masq/router from the 
others, and make a dedicated NFS/DB/Web box.  This keeps your data one machine 
away from the DMZ.

Your mileage may vary, and of course I'm sure others on the list will have 
more varied responses.

Ah, that would be a problem. Unless your hardware supports morethan 4 COM
ports, you will not be able to use COM5. COM5 device may look close enough
to a COM3 device for device manager to misidentify it, and if the modem is
not designed to be "really" COM5 it may even work under some
circumstances, but if everything worked as strictly by the book the modem
would not even be recognized.
Now, it's possible that you have hardware which can handle more than 4
COM ports. Then wiht Linux you run into another problem: it's a special
compilation option for the kernel to support more than 4 ports, and it's
almost never enabled by default because nobody ever uses it (there are
multiport IO cards which provide 8 or more ports, they are supported,
there are modules which provide drivers, but >4 ports without such card is
extremely rare). I don't know if enabling >4 ports on Linux without a
special card creates a module or goes directly into the kernel. If it's a
module you can load it, otherwise you have to recompile the kernel if you
insist on using COM5.

NFS, Database, and Web services, on the same box with details. Firewall, DEFINATELY NOT!

The firewall should have two network cards, 1 to point to the outside world and 1 to point to the inside network. I believe there is a Security HOWTO that goes into more detail on this.

On larger systems you need to think about how the NFS system might compete with the database server for hard drive or "spindle" access. For example, it might be a good idea to configure your NFS shares on drives that are *not* accessed by the database.

I agree with this. Most security experts will wrinkle their noses at the thought of putting firewalling on the same box as the critical data. The good news is that there is a Linux distrobution specifically dedicated for firewalls. It is very tight and can be run on a 486!!! You don't need a Cisco if you're willing to take a crack and making your own firewall. I believe the distro also has a web configuration interface.

I would suggest setting up the following boxen:
a firewall/NAT server to create both a DMZ and a internal (192.168.x.x)
network
a web/database server in the DMZ to serve web stuff
a NFS server inside your internal network

Yeah, I know, it's 3 boxes, but unless most of the NFS exports are your
web pages, I would keep the NFS server on the internal net to keep my
life simpler wrt firewall rules and troubleshooting.  It also keeps the
NFS stuff from getting ran through a firewall, so it's just a miff more
responsive (maybe not noticeable at all... YMMV).

To more specifically answer your question, though, yes, you can do it all
on one box, but it's not a very good idea to provide a single point of
failure.

The important thing to keep in mind is that the boxen don't have to all
be top-line systems.  Depending on how much usage you're getting out of
the system, you can get away with lower pentium-grade systems.  The
firewall in particular doesn't need much processor or RAM, just fast PCI
network cards.  In fact, you can probably get away with something that
nobody wants to use as a desktop because it's too "slow" by today's
standards.  Alot of network servers start life as workstations and then
are taken over to be used as servers because they've exceeded their life
as a desktop system.

  Thanks, Don. I've used chkconfig a number of times in the past, but wasn't
aware of ntsysv until I read about it on the postfix HOWTO. When I read the
man page I couldn't see any differences between the two.

It comes from the queue manager for the Mailman mailing list system.

Without knowing more, I'm not sure how to tell you what to fix.  But
mailman is pretty finicky about file permissions and ownership and such.

I would first try going into ~mailman/bin and running ./checkperms as the
mailman user and seeing what happens then.  ./checkperms -f will actually
fix the permission problems it finds, but be sure you see what they are
first.

If you have no need to host mailing lists on that machine, you can just
remove the package.

  I would like to install a listserv to host a couple of small mail lists.
My experience on mail lists suggests that mailman is the way to go: need to
pre-subscribe; fairly secure. However, I don't run a http server (i.e.,
apache) and I really don't want to set up one.

  How about minordomo or any of the others? What options do I have?

Thanks,

Yeah, it does. :P Your method also doesn't determine the 'xx' part
of the start & kill scripts from the directives in the scripts
themselves, which can cause problems when there are dependencies
between services.

Matt, I'm sorry I resorted to name calling and will unblock you on my home
computer :)

It was a really bad day trying to get that distro to work and I was pretty
frustrated with computers in general. I usually just brush off comments like
that, but yesterday it got to me. Again, I'm sorry I lashed out.

Last night someone started a newsletter spam attack against me over this.
No newsgroup posting or opinion is worth launching a cyber attack over, at
least to me.  I even keep my posts in a single subject thread so as not to
bother others not interested in it. While I don't claim innocence in this
matter (I did make the post),  I didn't deserve to be attacked like that
either. While we both can say we're sorry, the bigger issue now is a cyber
attack occurred as a result of it. I hope it was just a one time thing and I
didn't push someone over the edge permanently. The last thing this newsgroup
needs is a cyber terrorist.

I used that method (especially on Solaris systems) before finding
chkconfig.  I find chkconfig to be *much* less error-prone, and
the ability to simply document the start/stop order at the top of
the SysV-like startup/shutdown script is pretty nice for my old
flaky gray-matter, too.

Subject: [PLUG] Sendmail Relay Problem
Message-ID: <1020131851.1508.35.camel@lana.manymoons.net>

I have a home network with my linux box as a gateway and a second
machine with windoze for the family.

I have recently configured my machine to work as a mail server using
sendmail, and have had no problems with that.  However, when I try to
mail from the second machine, it denies the relay.  From my
/var/log/maillog:


Apr 29 18:48:53 lana sendmail[2956]: g3U1mrx02956: ruleset=check_rcpt,
arg1=<jonjacobmoon at yahoo.com>, relay=sleepy [192.168.1.2], reject=550
5.7.1 <jonjacobmoon at yahoo.com>... Relaying denied


It only does this to external addresses but works fine for internal
(manymoons.net) addresses.  Any hints and what is going on here?

Thanks.

somewhere there should be a Mailman.py or Mailman.so, if it's Mailman.py
you could post the file, or just get a new copy of it, if it's
Mailman.so (which in my mind would make more sense), probably try to
compile a new version of it...That's just a guess...but from the Python
Diagnostics that's what it looks like...just a corrupted file...

Hope that Helps

Well, I *was* assuming the W at reZ crew didn't create the files.  :-P  :-)

That is an important caveat.  Carraige returns can be really
fun in a name, too!  For example:

    touch `perl -e 'print "try_and_\rDELETE_ME!";'`

I notice the Linux ls(1) and dir(1) are pretty robust. But "ls | cat"
makes life a bit more interesting.  (And, I must credit a WareZ group
for really hammering home the little lesson that a filename can contain
*anything* except '/' or '\0'.  May their slimy corpses roast in Hades.)

Now, can Perl do it in nice quick one-liner as elegant as Sandy's
variable expansion trick?  (Sandy's method is handling the "\r" case,
and the space " " case pretty well, it seems.)  I must confess to not
using Perl as much as I ought to -- but the ubiquity of "sh" is pretty
much unparalled, so I tend to use it.

It never fails.  I will search and search for an answer for hours and as
soon as I give up and send a cry for help...... there it is.

To be specific, I needed to add the ip for the other machine in the
/etc/mail/access file.

So, sorry for the trouble.  You may disregard :)

Actually, I found a cron job that calls it once a minute. I commented
out that line in the cron job, but it still runs. I dunno why.

Did that, but the script fails:

[root at defiant mailman]# bin/check_perms
Traceback (innermost last):
  File "bin/check_perms", line 50, in ?
    MAILMAN_GRPNAME = grp.getgrgid(MAILMAN_GID)[0]

executing with -f gives the same error.

True, but then I wouldn't learn how to use the package. I just want it
to stop sending me lotsa mail, and to stop using cycles, until I'm
ready to start learning how to use it.

The ones from notebookcomputer.com are cheaper $550 and have a little

longer warranty (90 days compared to 30 days). The IBM ones come with
Win98 but they claim it is the OS that was on the Laptop originally
and you are not paying for the OS license. The notebookcomputer.com
version can be purchased without an OS.

Subject: [PLUG] pppd fails
Message-ID: <20020429213206.H1484@defiant>

Well, I read this neat article in Linux Journal (Feb/Mar) on
configuring pppd. And now that I'm moving to a place that _doesn't_
have dsl, I need to make that work.

So, I downloaded WvDial (since they pointed out at the end of the
article how neat that was), and it won't compile. There's some sort of
missing reference to crypt that causes the makefile to exit.

So, I went thru the elements of the article. I got the modem
configured on the right port, and can make it dial out with minicom,
and with pppd chat_connect, but when I try to make it login with my
name, it fails.

I use ssh normally to log in, and I know the (telnet) password is correct
because fetchmail uses it to get the mail, but I can't get the
pap_secrets to successfully work. Here is the output of the debug
script (pppd /dev/modem 38400 modem lock connect /etc/ppp/chat-connect
user brucek defaultroute debug):

Bruce,

I don't know much about pppd -- long time since I used it -- but if you
are having problems with crypt libraries, there are two possible
solutions.
 1) add -lcrypt to your Makefile in the appropriate location (libraries,
or where it links the entire program)
 2) If that doesn't work, go get libcrypt.
http://sourceforge.net/projects/libcrypt/
 Install it. Use it wisely. Hopefully WvDial will compile. If it
doesn't, there's a reason you're running linux - go remove all calls to
crypt()/*politely, please!*/ and see if that works. *G*

--
A couple of stupid pppd ideas, just because they might help. If not,
just slap me with a dead chicken.
1) Try removing the quotation marks around your u/n and password.
2) Make sure your password is correct. I know you already have. Do it
again. I've stumbled over problems for days because I was *sure* I had
the right password. I was wrong.
3) Send the log to your ISP. The hackers working the support desk should
be reasonable if you use full sentences, which you seem pretty capable
of. They may even be impressed with the log -- it's better than coffee
cup holders, anyway.
4) Don't run it as root. Don't run anything as root, if you can avoid
it. Again, I'm no pppd expert, so it may be a requirement, in which
case, just ignore my arrogant ramblings.

Hmmm. What little I could dig up shows this as a Winmodem.  It could be 
that the driver for this got dropped from the latest distributions.  At 
least for an out of the box config.

shows your scanner as working under sane. May take some playing with.

I've been trying to get it going, but it's got issues:  I successfully
created the group "klug" and received mail to
"klug-admin at localhost.localdomain; on behalf of;
mailman-owner at localhost.localdomain"

with the links:

http://localhost.localdomain/mailman/admin/klug
http://localhost.localdomain/mailman/listinfo/klug

/var/www/html/mailmain   doesn't exist -  (running Apache, and a quick
check to www.maneuveringspeed.com shows it's running)

My /etc/hosts file has been modified to reflect
eagle.maneuveringpseed.com - and the correct domain shows up elsewhere,
such as in PINE and at the shell prompt, so it must be pulling
localhost.localdomain from someplace else.

SO.....I guess my main questions are:

1) How can I straighten it out as to which host I actually have?
2) Any tips to get it to create the pages to work in Apache?

Someting must be hosed, as check_perms doesn't work:

[root at eagle bin]# ./check_perms
Traceback (innermost last):
  File "./check_perms", line 50, in ?
    MAILMAN_GRPNAME = grp.getgrgid(MAILMAN_GID)[0]
TypeError: illegal argument type for built-in operation
[root at eagle bin]#

Any suggestions?

I'll second that, though I see it at www.list.org.  The one drawback is
that it's written in Python and the latest port is proving difficult to
build.  But it works well and has a nice web-based user interface that
actually works well.

I've been working my way through an introductory Ruby text lately, and
it seems like a pretty neat language (though my range of experience may
be limited). I'm curious how widespread it's usage is, though,
especially among the Portland locals. Anyone hear using it regularly? Is
it encounted much in the real world (workplace, that is)?

FWIW, I returned the VP6 to PC Heidens on Friday under their 1 year
warranty.  Today I learned that it was being returned to Abit, and I
could expect a repaired/replaced MB in a couple weeks or so.
Wonderful.  I've got another MB (single CPU) screwed in for the
interim.

Oh, that's an easy fix.  Don't move to an area that doesn't have DSL!  What
are you thinking?

Sorry, I couldn't resist.

On a serious note: It's really REALLY painful to go from DSL to dial-up.
I've done it and hated it.  I finally ended up breaking down and getting
cable.  As much as I hate the inability to host my own servers (#$%@ AT&T),
at least I can surf without falling asleep.  I won't even consider a house
in the future unless it has some sort of broadband access.  Consider
yourself forewarned.

Well, I read this neat article in Linux Journal (Feb/Mar) on
configuring pppd. And now that I'm moving to a place that _doesn't_
have dsl, I need to make that work.

So, I downloaded WvDial (since they pointed out at the end of the
article how neat that was), and it won't compile. There's some sort of
missing reference to crypt that causes the makefile to exit.

So, I went thru the elements of the article. I got the modem
configured on the right port, and can make it dial out with minicom,
and with pppd chat_connect, but when I try to make it login with my
name, it fails.

I use ssh normally to log in, and I know the (telnet) password is correct
because fetchmail uses it to get the mail, but I can't get the
pap_secrets to successfully work. Here is the output of the debug
script (pppd /dev/modem 38400 modem lock connect /etc/ppp/chat-connect

Solution to Challenging the Man in the Middle
By Brian Hatch

Two weeks ago, I challenged you to figure out how a machine was 
compromised. Let me quickly recap the situation:

On a machine maintained by a very security-conscious administrator, 
several users had reported that their accounts had been cracked. All 
the software was up to date, and only ssh access was allowed. 

When I tried to log in from home, my ssh client told me that the 
server's host key had changed. However, when I checked the actual ssh 
host key files, they were no different than before. Even when I 
restarted sshd -- and I could see that it was using the correct key 
file -- it was presenting the wrong key on the network. However, when I 
started a new sshd server on a different port, it worked correctly.

There was no reason that the same sshd binary should have been acting 
differently just because it was running on a different port, and there 
was nothing on the system to explain why it wasn't using the correct 
key on the default ssh port.

I suspected that someone was using an SSH man-in-the-middle package on 
the local network. Both sshmitm (part of Dug Song's dsniff[1] package) 
and ettercap[2] can fill this role. (As it turns out, the culprit was a 
modified version of sshmitm, so I'll just call it by name henceforward.)

The machine running sshmitm needs to be situated between the ssh client 
and ssh server. When the client machine connects to the server, the 
machine running sshmitm intercepts the packets. The sshmitm process 
pretends to be the actual server. It will follow the SSH protocol 
specification, providing the host key, agreeing on cryptographic 
algorithms and keys, and eventually asking the client for the password.

The sshmitm program establishes a connection to the actual server, as 
if it's a normal ssh client. It takes the data that it receives from 
the real client, which it has available in cleartext, and re-encrypts 
it to the real ssh server as appropriate.

Because, in the end, the client sends packets to the server and 
everything looks normal, there's no way to realize anything is fishy 
once the connection is established. However each and every byte in 
those packets is readable (and modifiable) by the sshmitm program.

The sshmitm program was written as a proof of concept, and as such does 
not have much functionality for an attacker. It merely snags the 
password supplied by the user. Ettercap can snag the whole session as 
well, making it more powerful. Both dsniff and ettercap include other 
crypto-breaking code for SSL sessions too, in case you're not worried 
enough.

The pivotal security step in establishing a secure SSH session is to 
verify the ssh host key of the server. When the client connects to a 
machine for the first time, it presents the ssh host key of the server, 
as seen here:

    The authenticity of host 'blah.example.com' can't be established. 
RSA1 key fingerprint is 
39:57:1c:9a:c1:8c:cb:4d:f7:25:c8:89:0f:31:fc:6f. Are you sure you want 
to continue connecting (yes/no)? 

The first time you connect, you have no way to know if that's the 
correct fingerprint or not[3]. Most folks blindly say "yes." At this 
point, you've entered the host key into your ~/.ssh/known_hosts so you 
can compare with later sessions.

The sshmitm (or ettercap) program does not have a copy of the actual 
ssh host key for the server it's impersonating; thus, it cannot present 
the correct key to the client. Instead it must generate its own fake 
host key.

Since a fake host key is in use, the user connecting will see the 
following (from the previous article) indicating that something is 
wrong:

    @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
    @    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
    @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

sshmitm and ettercap work on the principle that most folks will ignore 
this warning, which is a pretty safe assumption.

The attacker had been running sshmitm for a while, capturing folks' 
passwords, which is why several people had found their accounts being 
cracked.  The fact that there was no interference by sshmitm when I ran 
a new ssh process on port 4321 was because sshmitm was only listening 
for ssh connections on port 22, and was leaving port 4321 alone 
entirely.

Now the trouble was figuring out who the culprit was.

In order for sshmitm and ettercap to function, they must be sitting on 
a machine between the client and server.  If the machine in question 
were somewhere out on the Internet in general, then there would be more 
than just our machine at stake.  However, the easiest position where 
the rogue machine could do its work would be on the local LAN.  

But if it's on the same LAN, it's not in between the client and server, 
you say?  True, but that can be remedied easily enough. All the rogue 
machine needs to do is poison your ARP cache so that the cache thinks 
that the attacker is the router or the destination machine. Then all 
packets to that machine will go through the rogue machine, and it will 
be -- in the network's eyes -- between the client and the server, even 
though technically it's just sitting next to them.

In this case, the rogue machine was in a different lab but still on the 
same subnet.  Through simple ARP poisoning it convinced the router that 
it was my friend's server, and convinced the server that it was the 
router.  It then had an enjoyable time functioning as both a password 
sniffer and a router for unsupported protocols. 

Since I suspected this was the problem, it was pretty easy to figure 
out where the rogue machine was.  I simply pinged all the local 
machines ('nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24' will do this quickly) and then 
checked the ARP table ('arp -an') for duplicates.  I actually used the 
following very lame command to show me duplicate entries:

    $ arp -an| awk '{print $4}'| sort | uniq -c | grep -v ' 1 '
         5 F8:F0:11:15:34:51
        88 <incomplete>

Then I simply looked at the IP addresses used by that ethernet address 
in 'arp -an' output, ignoring those that were blatantly poisoned (such 
as the router) and looked up the remaining address in DNS to see which 
machine it was.  It was the desktop machine for one of the students in 
the lab.  I sent all the info I had to the school's IT security folks; 
later that day they visited the student, and not to offer him a free 
pizza.  Of course, our cleanup had only just begun.

One way to avoid having your password sniffed by tools such as ettercap 
and sshmitm is to use SSH identities for authentication. This form of 
authentication uses public/private-key crypto just as the verification 
of the host key does.  Since the password for your key is only stored 
in your brain, and the private key is never sent across the network, 
there's no way for a man-in-the-middle attacker to get a hold of your 
actual private key. In fact, for this reason, MITM software may disable 
identity authentication, hoping to get you to type your password 
instead.

The moral of this story is, of course, that you shouldn't blindly 
ignore warning dialogs, especially those that concern something 
important like the security of your encrypted connections.

Congratulations to Reiner Schroeppel, who guessed the problem mere 
minutes after I got my copy of the challenge in my mailbox.

        measure of security.  For more info on what you can do to

As a coincidence, I'm going through a bunch of A-Bit BE6-
II machines to head off some problems we've had with 
them. (Random power downs and freezes)
Turning off Power Management, ATA-100 support, and 
shifting JP1 & JP2 to position 1.  And PCI slots 3 & 5 
are off limits as well.  Don't know how accurate this 
info is or if it will help in your case.

I keep seeing all over people complaining about the use of this term,
however, it's use continues to increase.  I think it's a "new school/old

upset about this term.  X Window System is too many syllables and X is too
vague.  What is the objection to "X Windows"?

  There is defined usage and common usage. The increased use of the latter
frequently leads to communications breakdowns. An analogy to the 'X Windows'

Speaking of your clue-filter, I just thought of something.


A vast majority of resumes in some organizations are screened (or
pre-screened) by human resources types who don't have a clue.  They tend to
pick up on buzzwords, common program names, and if they've ever heard of X
at all, they've probably heard it as the common butchering we all recognize
as "X Windows".  ("Uh... hey, Bob!  You ever heard of X/X11?  Me neither.
Sounds like porn or something.  Forget this dude." "X Window System... that
means everything from 3.1 to XP, right?")

So to get past the clueless HR types, you almost have to dumb down the
resume to things they've heard of (not to mention braindump certifications,
etc) to keep them from tossing you in the "don't bother calling" file.

But once you get past them, you might be screened by someone who DOES have a
clue.  Who might read the "dumbed down for HR" bits and think you're a ditz.


That's an ugly two steps. 1) get it past someone with no clue  2) make it
through a clue filter.  Aack!  That could be tricky.


I guess that is a good argument for knowing a thing or two about the place
you are sending it to, and tailoring your resume for for the most likely
type of person to do the screening.  (And just cross your fingers in the
case of the two-step gauntlet... everyone else has to make it through
somehow too.)


Anyway... of course X Windows is incorrect.  And perhaps warrants pointing
out.  But do you really care THAT much?  Or do you just have THAT MANY
resumes to go through?  :)

A line from the front lines: in 10 years, I've heard it referred to as
almost exclusively, pun intended, as "X". From a Data General workstation
guy, a NMR spectroscopist on a Sun, to developers on Linux and Suns. Some
might use "X Windows" when talking to lay people but the vast majority just
say "X".

Sorry, Randal, but this sounds too much like something that
Richard "GNU/Linux" Stallman would complain about to interest me.
In the Grand Scheme of Things, "who cares"?

I would much rather see people clean up their filthy language, write
intelligible English instead of gibberish, quit using worn-out,
copy-cat, cliches like (the idiotic) "my bad" and "cool" (or "kewl"),
&c. than worry about an upper case "w" in a phrase whose meaning is
clear to all, and in which the "W" will go un-noticed by 99.9% of
readers.  (As much as I dislike and despise Microsoft, I didn't notice
the egregious faux pas.)  Worrying about this is just too `PC' for my
blood.

And I'm sorry for this little diatribe.  It was the first e-mail of the
morning and it caught me off guard.  I would normally not respond.

Dean

P.S.    I suppose many of us _do_ consider the word "windows"
        with a capital "w" to be profanity.
     

P.P.S.  On a (very slightly) related note, I will share
        the following link to a long MS vs. Lnix thread
        with you all.

        http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/672921/posts

        It's against my better judgment to do so, but so was
        writing this post;  I'm feeling rather saucy this morning.
        I will make no further comment on either the political
        persuasion of the site (which is sure to offend some)

Right.  Maybe my sensitivity is cranked up high because I mostly
write for a living.

But darn it.  Microsoft Windows has NOTHING to do with X.  So calling
it "X Windows" is just wrong.  X11 is *very* unambiguous, if you need
to adorn the X with something else.

I've given up on "emails", although that still just sounds wrong to
me.  (You don't get "mails"... so why should you get "emails"??!!)
Please let me fight my one last pedantic point in peace!

Oh wait, I still get pedantic about qualifiers, such as "only" or
"just" or "all".  For example, every Verizon ad ends with

        Not available in all areas

which if you interpret literally means it's not offered *anywhere*,
because it's simpler to parse it as "not available" "in all areas"
rather than "not" "available in all areas".

They should have used the much simpler:

        Limited availability

Or

        Not available in some areas

if they really wanted to make it clear.

OK, rant rant rant.  Maybe I need to be de-stressed today. :)

Subject: [PLUG] DNS weirdness
Message-ID: <3CCEDDB4.6070205@pacifier.com>

It all started when I tried to go to http://strongsignals.net

Mozilla on RH7.2 says "Host not Found"
ping times out
host times out
dig times out (I tell dig to use another ips's DNS server and it works)

Fire up winme on the laptop and IE brings up the page fine.
go back to Linux, this time
$ host www.strongsignals.net
returns an ip

so maybe they really want the www, now mozilla will take me there.  (IE 
still doesn't need the www.)

Then I give mozilla the url again w/o the www--host not found,
$host www.stronsignals.net
times out!  Perhaps funkiness with my gateway's caching dns, anyway

Now the question,
On RH7.1, host -w www.strongsignals.net
waits forever, like the command is supposed to, but RH7.2
reports
Trying "www.strongsignals.net."
timer.c:662: INSIST(result == 0 || result == 2) failed.
Aborted

Cannot find this string in the kernel source, or in any other timer.c on my 
system.  Is this part of a the C library?

And does any have a url that requires www in front so I can test this 
mozilla/system interaction?  (When I gave mozilla the bad url, it ruined 
things for the rest of the system.)

I've got an LTSP server set up for experimentation, and the server has a site-wide
install of OpenOffice.org on it.  As a user physically logged into the server machine
on an X console (startx -- :1) I can run the "setup" program that creates the per-user
installation.  But when I'm logged in via XDMCP, on the X Terminal, that does not work.
"setup" just hangs and eventually, after a long timeout, exits with code 1.

Any clues?

Turning off external power to the machine each time I reboot is a royal pain.

user apache should not have a true shell.  unless you want people (namely 
people you don't like) logging into your machine as apache.  if you need to 
make changes that would (theoretically) be made by apache, use chmod, chown, 
chgrp, etc.  On other *NIX systems, httpd runs normally as USER: nobody 
GROUP: nobody or www:www, etc.

If you are incredibly paranoid, you may want to consider chroot()-ing the 
apache server also...It's kind of a pain in the arse, but you never know....

Why would you want to 'su' to apache?
If you don't mind my asking...

Well, I did look them up before posting, and I didn't see
such a difference, so I beg to disagree.

But I'll tell you what, you can have the last post if you

Well, I did look them up before posting, and I didn't see
such a difference, so I beg to disagree.

But I'll tell you what, you can have the last post if you
want it, and I won't waste the PLUG bandwidth any more

Hello Linux folkz,
I need to setup Web based MySQL database service over Internet.
Remote clients should be able to connect to database port 3306 and
perform secure data exchange (queries, reads and writes).
Are there any methods to perform such data exchanges in a most secure
manner?
I was thinking about keeping port 3306 open for remote connections
'cause Mysql has a very good (per host, per user, per database, per
table, per row based) security mechanisms.
But in this case the use of firewall on a separate box is purposeless.
It it the same as having database server and firewall on the same box.
May be you can point me to other more secure solutions?
Is it possible to use ssl for database connections? I couldn't find a
decent answer on this question.
Thank you in advance for any advises or sources of information.
Alex

I have a funny feeling there are many that would argue against that
particular analogy... considering that "Linux" is a term trademarked by
Linus.  (And I don't believe anyone holds a copyright on GNU/Linux, either.)

But I won't. :)

(I do agree with your overall point.  But on the other hand, the case
complained about WAS a sort of "official title" of a course.  Which might
warrant official terminology, as opposed to colloquial usage.)

It sounds like you need something like a wrapper for the MySQL server...

Something that will block connections that are erroneous and will block after 
N failed attempts for X hours....Yet still allow MySQL clients to access the 
server...

what is the client set up? just using generic MySQL clients or could this be 
done via web pages, etc.?

>From past experience, the mysql server listening on an accessable port can be 
a problem....This is also dependant upon the sensitivity of the data you are 
storing there.  

Perhaps a program/script that listens on a socket and queries/updates the 
machine as a local user with the program/script handling authentication? as 
well as MySQL handling username/password authentication? 
This depends heavily on the client software situation....

The client setup is perl or expect scripts that connect to web DB,

Nothing is complicated.

There are several dial-up VPN clients that are designed to work with dynamic
IPs.  It depends on what VPN solution you use.

MySQL communicates over TCP, so it should be a problem at all to wrap
the connection with stunnel.  I just noticed last night that Postgres
7.1 has SSL support; maybe you should check to see if MySQL does.

Um... do you have an ATI Radeon card?  What does
catpci say?

And, since you're using the X Window System
version 4.x, have you tried "XFree86
--configure"?  It makes a new config file in
/root/ that you can use/change/adapt.  That's what
I use anymore.  At least it gives you something to
start with.

I don't know of any existing applications that would do this...I've written 
several, but mostly for other databases...I'm not very familiar with the 
conversation between MySQL servers and clients over Sockets.

If there is a VPN solution that can handle dynamic IP's that would probably 
be the easiest way to go and least time consuming.

If you are going to write it from scratch, the main thing to bear in mind is 
security. (I apologize if I'm beating a dead horse)...You will want to have 
some sort of ACL functionality in it, as well as logging, etc...And of course 
the ever present buffer-overflow checking.....

#define DORK_HACKER_MODE 1

if the queries/updates/inserts are pretty straight-forward, a solution that 
has worked for me for years is a sort of DB-HTTP server, wherein queries/etc 
can be sent in a fashion similar to an HTTP request (with authentication also)

i.e.

_SHA1: <SHA1 hash of username/password/IP address  or whatever to be verified 
by server>
INSERT /tablename,tabelname2/tablename.colname:value,tablename.colname:value

the _SHA1: above should be any kind of verifiable key ....

#undef DORK_HACKER_MODE

etc.

Hope this helps....If you want any help with anything....shoot me an email 
offlist...

  Whew! After working all afternoon, I learned (by trial-and-error) how to
configure relayhost in /etc/postfix/main.cf. Neither the FAQ nor the HOWTO
had any detailed information.

  Anyway, not knowing that I wasn't sending mail past the firewall, I have a
bunch stuck in /etc/postfix/deferred/. Does anyone know how I get postfix to
send those?

Message-ID: <20020430235307.C391F10E055@pons.enet.sharplabs.com>


Some time ago  we had a discussion of 10-bit LC Display panels.

Here is some news (and a great opportunity to toot the Labs' horn :-)
apropos to that subject.  A (very, very small) part of that work was
done using Linux.

                                  Dean S. Messing

    Sharp Introduces the First 10-Bit Gamma Corrected LCD Monitor;
    Patented LCD Panel With Supporting Gamma Correction Improves LCD Color
    Imagery 64X
    
    April 30, 2002 12:00am
    Source: Business Wire
    HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE) via NewsEdge Corporation --
    
    Sharp Systems of America, a division of Sharp Electronics Corporation,
    has announced a family of new LCD desktop monitors including the
    flagship LL-T1820, which incorporates the first LCD panel in a
    commercial product capable of displaying over 1 Billion colors.
    The LCD panel, developed by Sharp Laboratories of America in Camas,
                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Washington, sets a new standard in color imaging by displaying 10 bits
    of gray scale per subpixel for a total of 2(30) colors, which is sixty
    four times the colors displayable by a conventional LCD panel. (a)
    "The ability to reproduce a much finer color gradation sweeps away one
    of the few remaining areas in which a CRT has shown superiority over
    an LCD in professional applications such a pre-press and medical
    imaging," explained Greg Nakagawa, senior vice president and general
    manager of Sharp Systems of America. "This innovation raises the bar
    for LCD displays and demonstrates Sharp's leadership in LCD
    technology."
    
    LL-T1820
    The Sharp LL-T1820 is the ultimate 18-inch LCD monitor. It features
    the Sharp ASV technology LCD panel that provides a superior 25 ms
    response and super-wide display angles of 170 degrees both
    horizontally and vertically. A unique 10-bit per subpixel gamma
    correction table maintains a linear gray scale while delivering the
    maximum image data in very dark and very light areas of the image. The
    LL-T1820 employs Sharp's Ultra High Aperture (UHA) technology for
    reduced power consumption and improved brightness (220 nits), as well
    as AGLR, a multi-layer surface treatment that reduces glare and
    reflection to less than one-third that of a conventional LCD. With a
    slim bezel width of only 17 mm, the LL-T1820 is ideal for
    multi-monitor applications while its dual DVI inputs permit the most
    flexible configuration in new and existing installations. Furthermore,
    its ability to pivot to the portrait mode reduces or eliminates
    scrolling for page-oriented applications thus improving productivity.
    The LL-T1820 is available in black or white for an estimated street
    price of $1299.
    
    LL-T1803
    The Sharp LL-T1803 18-inch LCD monitor brings premium performance at a
    value-oriented price. With its 220 nit brightness, 400:1 contrast
    ratio, and analog or digital (DVI) inputs, the screen performance is
    exceptional. Furthermore, the Sharp LCD panel used in this monitor has
    an extremely fast response time of 25 ms making it perfect for
    displaying TV or DVD (TV tuner card required in the computer) and high
    speed games. The LL-T1803 also features a long-life (approximately
    50,000 hours) backlight, which is 2 1/2 to 3 times the life of a CRT
    monitor, making this monitor an excellent investment. Available in
    May, the LL-T1803 has an estimated street price of $949.
    LL-T1520
    Echoing the super-slim design of the LL-T1820, the LL-T1520 is the
    premier 15-inch LCD monitor available today. Featuring the Sharp
    ASV-technology LCD panel that provides a superior 25 ms response and
    super-wide display angles of 170 degrees both horizontally and
    vertically, this monitor produces exquisite graphics and sharp text.
    The AGLR coating maintains superior contrast by canceling glare and
    maintaining velvety blacks even in brightly-lit environments. A pair
    of speakers for multi-media applications is integrated with the bezel
    so unobtrusively, that one can barely tell they are there. The
    LL-T1520 is available in white or black for an estimated street price
    of $499. Availability is scheduled for May.
    
    LL-T15G1
    The price/performance leader in 15-inch LCD monitors is the new Sharp
    LL-T15G1. Its high brightness (260 nits) and high contrast ratio
    (350:<stock_info.asp?ticker=1>) result in a flicker-free image of
    extremely high quality. Auto synchronization and auto gain controls
    simplify optimization of this monitor for the best image from a PC or
    Apple computer. A cleverly designed base folds up to expose a
    VESA-compliant hole pattern for wall or arm mounting of the LL-T15G1.
    The need to remove the base is thereby completely eliminated. The
    LL-T15G1 also features a backlight with very low power consumption (29
    watts) and extremely long life (typically 50,000 hours), making this
    monitor less expensive to own and use than a CRT monitor of similar
    size. The LL-T15G1 is available in May and has an estimated street
    price of $429.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0204301439290.3883-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I had a spare half-hour this morning before a meeting so I foolishly went
on with replacing sendmail with postfix. Wasn't *that* simple, primarily
because I had to modify the spec file then rebuild the binary package before
installing it. Anyway, it now runs 'cause I'm again receiving and sending
mail.

  However, and this is very strange, something clobbered X. Before leaving
for my meeting I tried printing something (from WordPerfect via CUPS) and
nothing went to the printer. So, I tried to examine the print queue and I
couldn't. Then, I tried using the xfce lock icon to lock the screen and that
failed, too. Here's what I see when I try to manually run xlock:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ xlock
Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server
Xlib: Client is not authorized to connect to Server
xlock: unable to open display .

  I admit to a vast ignorance of The X Window System in all its glory. I've
no idea what the above is telling me to do, nor why it happened. All I did
was 'rpm -e sendmail --nodeps' so it killed fetchmail, too.

  Please tell me what the above message means and how to fix what I
inadvertently broke. After I get this fixed, I'll write to Aracnet about
adding another MX record in their DNS so mail comes directly down here. I'll
post another message asking what and where to put spam blocks:
/etc/postfix/main.cf, header_checks, or somewhere else.

Thanks -- as usual,

Rich

what are your permissions for your xserver?  Sounds like the user running 
xlock isn't allowed to open the display....can you open other X apps? (the 
most important being XBill)

Coincidentally, I had a very similar if not precisely this problem
last night when I plugged in the "interim" motherboard, an Intel
D815AAE2-mumble-mumble.  It has some kind of AGP video built into the
board, but to minimize disruption I wanted to keep using the PCI video
card I had before.

I ended up applying the following patch (which is specific to my
situation, but shown here as an example):

--- /etc/X11/XF86Config-4-vp6   2002-04-25 13:26:15.000000000 -0700

I got the new BusID from /proc/pci.  Worked like a charm.

Message-ID: <1020212571.32405.7.camel@bittersweet>

Just installed the latest Nautilus and "nautilus-galeon" from Debian
"unstable".  Wow, it sure has improved!  It has yet to crash, and I can
view man pages and info with it!  Very nice.  The galeon plugin puts the
Gecko-based "galeon" browser in as the HTML viewer.  It works very
well.  This is the first time I've been able to view HTML documents with
Nautilus and not have it crash.  I'm very impressed!

Brian,

  It was me running it. When I returned from my luncheon meeting I shut down
X, logged out, logged in and ran startx. All worked as before. Verr-r-r-ry
strange! A "computer moment", I guess.

  Many thanks, Dan. Turns out that when I finally got the proper definition
for 'relayhost' in /etc/postfix/main.cf, postfix sent all the deferred mail
by itself.

  Well, postfix certainly has effective spam filters. I cannot forward a
spam message to spamcop:

Reporting-MTA: dns; salmo.appl-ecosys.com
Arrival-Date: Tue, 30 Apr 2002 17:28:40 -0700 (PDT)

Final-Recipient: rfc822; submit.Ws33vS2kWdf5XrIW at spam.spamcop.net
Action: failed
Status: 5.0.0
Diagnostic-Code: X-Postfix; This site does not accept spam.

  Anyone know how to interpret this? What do I do to fix the problem? I
thought the header_checks and body_checks affected only incoming mail.

Thanks,

Rich

Attached is the file with the output from lspci -vv . I have a ATI Xpert 128 Pro which is based on Rage 128 chip. 
Last night I installed XFree86 4.2.0 and I got GUI but KDE or GNOME didn't work. It went only in xtrm (I think) or failsafe mode. When I ran Xconfigurator I could see the kde screen and I didn't get the I/O error anymore. Now, I installed XFree86 4.1.0 back and I have the same thing as before.

Does it still scan your CD-ROMs and such?  1.0.4 has the nasty
habit of scanning my CD-ROMs (or maybe just SCSI devices), which
causes my whole system to freeze for a few moments.

Any message coming into the mail system is "incoming" mail, so if
you've got *_checks it will prevent it going any direction.

It does the same thing with IDE CD-ROM drives also.

Wil,

  Of course! (slaps head).

  So, does this mean that I cannot send mail to spamcop any longer? It must
be something in the original message header or body that causes postfix to
cut it off at the pass. Well, at least I know that it works using the config
files I found on the postfix web site.

Thanks,

Rich

No, you should be able to just exclude the spamcop domain in
your header_check.  Be careful, however; the "OK" target (oh,
I could be forgetting the name; it could be "ACCEPT" or "ALLOW")
is actually a NOP; if you expect to make a postive match to allow
all of something through (like you wanted to allow 'naked' to come
from nakedape.cc, but not anywhere else), it won't work.

Wil,

  This works with ipchains, but not postfix.

# The header_checks parameter specifies an optional table with patterns
# that each logical message header is matched against, including
# headers that span multiple physical lines.  Patterns are matched
# in the specified order, and the search stops upon the first match.
# When a pattern matches, what happens next depends on the associated
# action that is specified in the right-hand side of the table:
#
# REJECT the entire message is rejected.
# REJECT text.... The text is sent to the originator.
# IGNORE the header line is silently discarded.
# WARN   the header is logged (not rejected) with a warning message.
#
# These patterns do not apply to MIME headers in the message body.

  I'm not sure if the WARN option dumps the message but warns me that it
tried getting through.

  I'll ask on the postfix mail list.

Thanks,

Rich

  Has anyone learned why mozilla's bookmarks are alphabetized in the

  The major categories are in alphabetical order, but the individual sites
are in no particular order. Very strange.

Does it still leave hidden xml files and .thumbnail directories all over the

creating cd-roms.

That's what I try to stick to... "X".

If I get a funny, confused look, I add "X Window System".

If they still look at me like a deer in headlights, I say "You know, the GUI
on Unix-type systems".

If it takes more than that ("uh... unix?") I usually give up. :P

It was suggested by someone in an earlier post.  I had changed ownership and 
permissions of html and cgi-bin to myself. for easier editing.  I asked if 
that was a horrible idea and was told that it was. So I changed back and was 
editing as root, not a good idea, but  nobody likes a longer write, run, fix 
cycle than necessary, so I tried su apache, which of course didn't work.

I tried adding a shell to apache, but emacs had trouble starting (vi didn't 
(:-\)) so I change it back.  I added myself to the apache group and that 
works fine.

Check the mailing list archives at www.postfix.org. There was just a lengthy 
discussion about per recipient header and body checks. I think the problem is 
that header and body checks are handled by the postfix cleanup program after 
the mail has been accepted by smtpd (which is where the other postfix 
antispam tools work). Somebody on the mailing list has come up with a patch 
that will allow you to bypass header and body checks by user but it sounds 
like it's a kludge.

I'd like to have dhcpcd automagically set the hostname and domainname for
my rh7.2 laptop to the value supplied by the dhcp server. I see in the
fine manual that dhcpcd can be asked to do this w/ the -D and -H switches.
Any idea where I can use those switches, as dhcpcd is probably be starting

Despite everything I mirthfully said before about this, I happened to
come across a reference of sorts, which itself points to several other
things.  I'll bring it to the meeting on Thursday.

  ANSI/ISO 5807-1985 "Information processing - Documentation symbols
    and conventions for data, program and system flowcharts, program
    network charts and system resources charts"

Looks like you can lay your hands on a PDF from ANSI for only $60
sight-unseen.  Ain't those standards organizations great? :-/

Using Mozilla 0.9.2.1 here.  Haven't seen the folders sorting themselves, 
they seem to stay where I set them.  AFA links in folders: seems to order 
old (top) to new (bottom)--upside down FILO stack.  Actually nice when 
you're looking for that site you bookmarked yesterday, but can't remember 
which folder you placed it in.

Before I begin the research on configuration and installation, I would
like to know if mailman works well with qmail, and if ezmlm and mailman
can work in parallel.

True, but it's still not second nature. I tend to program first, then go 
"Doh!", then think about permissions.  But I did finally read how groups 
work, and managed to get it working.  Though, to get the change to work, I 
had to logout and login.

My hunch is that your hostname changed, which would invalidate your X 
cookies. Did you swap ethernet interfaces or otherwise diddle with 
your hostname?

The secrets are unveiled in /sbin/ifup, but the short answer is you'll 
need to add a line to /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 (or 
eth1 or whatever your interface is called):

NEEDHOSTNAME=yes

That'll set the the "-H" switch.

As for the "-D" switch, it appears that Red Hat's ifup script doesn't 
appear to provide a way to set it. Hmm.

I also want to mention I've got some massive delay on my posts to this
list... this is from this morning.  Perhaps I need to bug somebody around
here about it, or find out more... :)
