Subject: [PLUG] SRM console problems...
Message-ID: <1280722050.2123.7.camel@localhost>

Is it true on the PC164 Alpha that anything connected to the second
channel of the onboard ide controller can't be used to install Linux?
Why is SRM console limited in this way and is there a fix?

I am also having problems with a vga extender cable.  I plug in a
monitor direct to the matrox millenium, no problem.  If I use an
extender cable though, I get a localhost:6001 error.  It isn't
the linksys kvm switch as I have tried taking that out of the loop
and I still had problems.  I don't know if the extender cable is
broken or if CentOS simply has problems on the Alpha working through
an extender cable.

Is there any way around having to boot ARC console from floppy when SRM
console is installed?  Apparently a file, pc164nt.rom, has to be loaded
from SRM.  Why can't that be placed on a FAT12/16 partition?  Is it
possible to have boot loaded into the NVRAM and switch between them?

? ? ? ? ? ? ? Power for computation on a Moore's Law schedule

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?Keith Lofstrom, http://server-sky.com

? ? The EPA estimates US data centers (not including desktops)
? ? consumed 1.5% of total US electrical consumption in 2006.
? ? They predict a doubling to 3% of base load by 2011. ?Our
? ? work as programmers and technologists continues this
? ? runaway exponential growth, and we will be stopped by
? ? environmental and resource limits soon.

? ? Server sky is a proposal to use newly emerging solid state
? ? technologies to build large arrays of 3 gram paper-thin
? ? solar-powered computation satellites in 6400km Earth orbits.

? ? A single server-sat replaces 15 watts of ground-based
? ? electrical generation, cooling, and power conversion, as
? ? well as the computation and communication hardware itself.
? ? Orbital server farms may start out as expensive as current
? ? approaches, but design improvement and cheaper launch will
? ? decrease costs exponentially over time, much as transistor
? ? cost has plummeted over the last four decades.

? ? This is open technology, responsive to public input, and
? ? the project needs volunteer software and engineering help
? ? to stay that way. ?Eventually, Server Sky will create
? ? thousands of open technology jobs in the Portland area,
? ? and permit unbounded computation growth in space, while
? ? reducing energy demand and environmental damage on Earth.

? ? Earth can return to what it is good at green and growing

Subject: [PLUG] Alpha questions...
Message-ID: <1280780685.2662.3.camel@localhost>

Anyone know if there is a Windows NT 4 driver for the FA312 on an Alpha
and where/how I can get it?

Is there a way to install both SRM console and ARC firmware to the NVRAM
and switch between them?

I'm also wondering if there is a port of GCC to Windows NT 4.0 Alpha?

How about service packs beyond service pack 3?

Is there a fix for SRM console to get it to recognize drives on the
second onboard CMD640 IDE controller?

Subject: [PLUG] Low power ethernet and display
Message-ID: <20100802222233.GC3949@gate.kl-ic.com>

We have ethernet running through the house now.  I plan to connect
some Arduino-driven sensors in the garage, feeding the Alix that
is out there, and access the data from other machines, over the
ethernet.  Thus, we will be able to see whether we left the garage
door open (and close it) over the net.

But there are a few places where I would like to access the data
where we won't have normally have computers, laptops, or iPhones.

It would be nice to have a low power, low bandwidth small display
connected to the ethernet that could display status.  A few LEDs
and buttons at minimum, a push-to-light small display with touch
panel might be nicer.  I would like "open programmable", though
perhaps not a complete OS.  Low power (milliwatts) when not user
activated, sub-second turnon, and small.

X10 is a little too simple and slow, and the branching of the
circuits and all the power-factor-corrected electronic ballast
fluorescents would probably eat the X10 signal.  I would prefer
ethernet, or at least low voltage signalling, so I can fiddle
with it and not get zapped.

Does anyone know of little displays or interface boxes that do
what I've described?

No display or enclosure on the $99 system, development boards
with displays are $795 way and more than I need.

Here is a similar item at $200 or so, still no case though:
http://www.luminarymicro.com/products/mdl-idm.html

In an unrelated email, Aaron Burt pointed out that Power Over
Ethernet avoids the need for a wall wart at the remote end, just
an injector near the switch.  That supports many other things,
including wireless access points and cameras.  I could get rid
of a lot of wall warts that way, including the one currently
driving the Alix.

Regards the kits, I'm not looking for a hardware project, I'm 
hoping to find a complete little box with a very simple display
and a few buttons, that I can buy off the shelf.  An instant-on
wakeup button would be nice, it does not need to be displaying
or talking to the ethernet when I'm not using it.

I suspect what I want is not out there, and I will end up stringing
long USB cables to more Arduinos in boxes.

I started working on designing a board around an NXP LPC3250 which is
low power with ethernet, usb, gpio, and an LCD controller, but haven't
gotten very far.  I think it's possible to get something designed
around that under $100.  I can't think of anything that is ready to go
out of the box.

I have a plug computer
http://www.plugcomputer.org/

They are only $100, use 5 watts (power supply eats 3 of those), have
gigabit ethernet, wifi, USB 2.0 high speed, and bluetooth.  Last night
Ward, and I hooked it up to one of his Teensy (arduino clone)
projects, and were able to control it over the network.  There is a
new version coming out soon that will have an HDMI port on it for
easily hooking up to an off the shelf screen.

Has anyone gotten Dungeons of Daggorath 0.4.0 or Micropolis (simcity) working
with this release?

I installed the standard C++ libraries, version 5, from a deb package.  
  Dungeons of Daggorath segmentation faults.

I took all the libraries installed by Dirk Dashing and moved them to /opt/lib
adding a line to /etc/ld.so.conf for them.

Oh, Micropolis when I try to run it complains about the X terminal or  
some such saying something about slowness.

Mostly seems to work.  I grabbed a nearly empty partition from Windows 7 and
so far I'm fairly certain that 7 won't try to take it back or  
otherwise malfunction.  One worry is that 7 will want to recover the  
lost space or worse,
7 will want to write to it.

Looks like the computer is ready to go pretty much, just need to  
figure out how to get the updates installed.

Log messages? "Some such" isn't very helpful =(

Post the segfault so we can figure out what sent the signal and the X
slowness messages. Otherwise it's just shooting in the dark.

Scar was developed to interface with RuneScape. I'm looking for

Thank you ken for your reply
Yes I have looked at it 
I already created a Perl script that is to read from a directory/report,
and send ftp that report to another server. My real concern is: I want
to be able to provide a beginning day, ending day , and a month. That
way I can ftp more than one report at the time. This script should will
pull reports for days and month specified.
I can send you the script I have now if you would like?
I appreciate any help
Thanks

If you're trying to automate Winders GUI stuff, I recommend AutoHotKey.
It's open-source (GPL) and quite useful. http://www.autohotkey.com/

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?The Portland Linux/Unix Group
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?will meet
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?7 PM Thursday Aug 5, 2010
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?at
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?Portland State University

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?Server Sky - Data Centers in Orbit
? ? ? ? ? ? ? Power for computation on a Moore's Law schedule

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?Keith Lofstrom, http://server-sky.com

? ? The EPA estimates US data centers (not including desktops)
? ? consumed 1.5% of total US electrical consumption in 2006.
? ? They predict a doubling to 3% of base load by 2011. ?Our
? ? work as programmers and technologists continues this
? ? runaway exponential growth, and we will be stopped by
? ? environmental and resource limits soon.

? ? Server sky is a proposal to use newly emerging solid state
? ? technologies to build large arrays of 3 gram paper-thin
? ? solar-powered computation satellites in 6400km Earth orbits.

? ? A single server-sat replaces 15 watts of ground-based
? ? electrical generation, cooling, and power conversion, as
? ? well as the computation and communication hardware itself.
? ? Orbital server farms may start out as expensive as current
? ? approaches, but design improvement and cheaper launch will
? ? decrease costs exponentially over time, much as transistor
? ? cost has plummeted over the last four decades.

? ? This is open technology, responsive to public input, and
? ? the project needs volunteer software and engineering help
? ? to stay that way. ?Eventually, Server Sky will create
? ? thousands of open technology jobs in the Portland area,
? ? and permit unbounded computation growth in space, while
? ? reducing energy demand and environmental damage on Earth.

? ? Earth can return to what it is good at green and growing
? ? things while we fill space with gray and computing things.

? ? *******************************************************************

? ? ? ? Agenda:

? ? ? ? ? ? 7:00 - 7:30 ?Business
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?We will discuss the status of our ongoing projects

I just grabbed Micropolis out of the repos and it worked fine. I
didn't find Dungeons of Daggorath with just a quick google search. (I
don't have any personal desire to play it - was just checking to
help.)

I'm confused here - why do you bring up Dirk Dashing?

Hello down there in sunny Sacramento!

The answer to your question is: Yes.

You might consider asking a better question.

Subject: [PLUG] Inactivating majordomo
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1008051535040.10670@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   From time to time over the past decade or so I've hosted some small mail
lists on majordomo. The last one has faded away and I'd like to inactivate
majordomo to stop the spam being sent to the lists.

   My Google search showed nothing useful, and the ORA "Managing Mailing
Lists" was equally silent on the subject. I suppose that all that's
necessary is to change the names and executable bits on key files in
/usr/local/majordomo. Are there other/better things I should do so that I
can re-activate it in the future should that be warranted?

Why not get an ethernet shield for the Arduino ethernet shield? This
is both a suggestion and a question...

Thanks!

It has been a long times since I dealt majordomo but I think you can 
just go into the aliases file (/etc/aliases, /etc/postfix/aliases) and 
remove the lines that pertain to the list(s) then regenerate the 
database: "newaliases".

And what's your Perl question?

Other than "I don't know Perl, and I want this script to work."

At that point, you have two choices:

1) learn Perl, and ask a Perl question
2) use up limited resources, for which you will need willing victims
   (and a bit more humility), or need to provide renumeration.

Which of these do you choose?

The problem is, Xandros when the power adapter is connected simply won't
shut down.  This problem started when the battery ran completely out of
power.  If I disconnect the power brick, I can shut down and the computer
won't automatically restart 3 seconds later.  I've tried installing Slackware
13, the problem didn't go away.  I'm tempted to try Ubuntu 10.04  
hearing that there might be a fix for this, but not knowing exactly  
why this is happening
the chances of fixing it are slim to none.

I've tried adding modprobe -r snd-intel-hda to the halt script, but that
doesn't fix the problem.

This must be a hardware problem, how could a software bug manifest  
itself magically two years after the computer was purchased and came  
off of
warranty?

Does anyone know if there is a tool that can automate those steps?
Maybe a GUI tool for helping to build an RPM?

Checkinstall is pretty good.  It makes an RPM or DEB by watching what
"make install" does.  You can also start by extracting a similar source RPM
and doctor the spec file to fit.

Good docs here: http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/

Good Lord no.  Building RPMs is grown-up stuff. :)

I'm not sure what autohotkey does.  But in KDE, you can create all
sorts of shortcuts, in
  Control Center -> Regional and Accessibility -> Keyboard Shortcuts
and
  Control Center -> Regional and Accessibility -> Input Action

I'm sure that gnome has something similar.

The battery is shot, so I'm replacing it.  Thing is, this problem only
shows up when the laptop is plugged in.  If I unplug the laptop, I can
shut it down even if the battery is installed.  Anyone know of a way to
get around this issue?  Having to unplug a laptop to shut it off is a
pain in the neck as most people want to plug their netbook in when they
aren't using it.

Why inactivate rather than deactivate?  Just curious.

Consider uninstalling. With current package managers reinstallation 
would be nearly effortless.

Subject: [PLUG] Naming RFC 1918 networks...
Message-ID: <1281148029.24338.81.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

There seem be three options roughly:

1)  Use .foo TLD which isn't used on the Internet ( dangerous ).

2)  Use globally registered domain name ( wasteful ).

3)  Use a subdomain of a globally registered domain name ( limiting ).

Option 1 is dangerous but desireable, because it involves less typing
than say option 3 and isn't wasteful the way option 2 is.

I have another idea of how this can be solved:

Image this:

http://local:www.ivorysoap.org

           or:

http://Internet:www.ivorysoap.org

           or:

http://www.ivorysoap.org

           or:

http://NetJapan:www.ivorysoap.org

           or:

http://NetUS:www.ivorysoap.org

           or ...

-----------------------------------------

Explanation:

The first one means this is a name of a private host on a private
network that may or may not access the Internet.

The second is an alternative to the third for people who
want to be explicit.

The third is anywhere on the Internet go to http://www.ivorysoap.org
and this is in use today.

The fourth, NetJapan, means on the Internet in Japan.

The fifth, NetUS, means on the Internet in the United States naturally.

I'm thinking that the geographic location indicator should be 8
characters max.  Nobody can register local, private, or reserved.

To ease the usage of this system, new versions of the popular web
browsers can query what the global identifiers are and let you select
the one you mean from a short list.

The advantage is, name repeats become possible and what can be used
inside a private network to name the machines opens up.

With 8 characters and 26*2 possible choices for each character, that
comes out to 52^8 ( a lot of possible strings ).  Some number of these
strings should be discarded as nonsense.  Discarding case, about 20

For how long will .local be understood to be private?  What guarantees
are there?  Why not .pri or .private or .lan or .res or .reserved
or .home?  The danger is that people do try to use what are supposed to
be reserved private TLDs whether they purchase the right to or not from
IANA.

Back to my idea, what if 10 different organizations want to have
http://www.foo.bar as their globally unique domain name?  No, foo.bar is
not a good generic name, but please ignore that.

Just because there are a lot of possibilities for strings that are 255
characters or so long, not all of them are desirable to name a web site.
In fact, there are a few names that potentially a lot of people want to
use.  I don't know of any official RFC that says that .local is a
private TLD.  I prefer a three letter TLD for a private network where
local just isn't three letters.

Separate issue here, I've noticed with Bind 9 at least that removing 
the root hints section doesn't prevent bind from forwarding answers 
from Internet based name servers.  Seems that Bind is hard coded to
know about remote Internet based name servers.

ok, if you want one that will be guaranteed private forever, you can use
.example.

however, for all practical and reasonable purposes, you can use .foo, .tld,
or pretty much anything you want. as long as your local resolver thinks it's
a local domain, it will not go looking for records with the same name
outside. you can just as well use an already-in-use .com domain and just
hijack it for yourself on your local network. this is not dangerous, just a
little confusing.

You don't 'purchase the right to use' any TLD. The TLDs are .com, .net, .info, etc.

The 'danger' you speak of could be said of ANY domain name. If someone is using a domain name they do not have the authority to use, they are breaking things for themselves, and will quickly learn this can't be done long term.

Obviously it would not work, which is why we have RFC's that state it can't be done, and the current holder of the domain name is the only authority. If someone just decided to put a DNS server on the net that serves up a zone for microsoft.com, it would mostly be ignored as not authoritative.

I think you are looking for issues where there are none.

I didn't find one either. I see where Apple may be working on one. 

What's to stop you from registering your own domain name? If it's a private web server, we don't care what you use. You could define the foo.bar domain and make www.foo.bar, Unless you are not using your own DNS server as your primary, and you or someone else has that name defined publicly, it won't affect anyone else at all. 

I still think you are looking for issues where there are none.

No, there's a fourth option.  Use "split horizon" DNS:
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-horizon_DNS

This is how I do it and it is reasonable, particularly considering you
shouldn't mix your internal name servers and your external ones (for
multiple security reasons).

So basically, you buy a domain, but don't "waste" it on just internal
use.  You provide one set of records internally on that domain, but
provide a different/sub-set of that externally with a different DNS
service (could be on same box, but with different configs).  There are
limitations to this approach in scenarios where you want split-tunnel
VPNs, but it seems most people don't want that right now.

If you would like some tips on how to do this with djbdns, ping me off
list.  I don't recommend using BIND for this.  Considering what I've
learned about the mentality of BIND developers from my discussions
with them in the past, I don't wish the pain of using it on anyone.

HTH,
tim

I use split horizon DNS, good point.

I like .pri as a TLD for a private network.  I can't tell though if pri
is a global TLD or not.  I suppose I could use my registered domain name
instead of ending private addresses with pri.

I actually use my global domain name on most of my wired private hosts.

As far as the this is a solution looking for a problem comment.  No.
There is a desire in the world today to use the same name for 
different web sites.  What I am proposing is that a scope field
be added to domain names as a separate text field.  You don't type
this in, another mechanism allows choosing the correct scope indicator
from a list.

The scopes would include local, Internet, USA, UK (England), 
DE (Germany), etcetera.

The point of scoping every Internet domain name is to permit the usage
of any name on a local network and the usage of popular names more than
once for different public web sites.

What I foresee is a drop down menu that starts out with a country code
for every single country plus local and Internet (everywhere).  The
default is of course Internet where a list of choices becomes
highlighted when there is a collision.  As far as claims that there is
no problem, that is a bunch of bull.  No matter how many bits there
are to represent computers on the Internet, there are only so many 
names that people are going to want to type in.  Why should someone 
in England be prevented from registering a robinson.org domain
because someone elsewhere in the world already has?  There are
numerous Robinson families in the world.  As I understand the current
system, if I register robinson.org, that means that nobody else in the
world can use robinson.org until I give the name up.  Don't tell me 
that the global name space can't be expanded by use of another label. 

A possible benefit of my proposal is that you can say which region you
want your searches to target potentially improving your hit ratio.  If
the geographic labels are accurate, you can use them to cut down on spam
perhaps as well.  Privacy advocates obviously are going to hate this,
but was the purpose and intent of the Internet to make the whole world
seem like one place where you can't tell where anything is coming from?
Consumers of the Internet want to influence what they consume.  A robust
naming system that can give answers based on regions seems expedient.
If the region you want to check out is your local network, wouldn't it
be nice to have any name you want to use at your fingertips?  The
current domain system doesn't allow me to create a local
http://www.ebay.com/ that won't block the global one.  That may seem
like a lame example, but the risk of pri becoming an Internet TLD is
real.

There are arguments that RFC1918 was a bad idea because companies merge
and their IP address space conflicts.  Well, Dynamic DNS should solve
that problem.  I assign RFC 1918 addresses statically via DHCP, which is
an oxymoron.  If I could assign from a pool of IP addresses and send the
MAC address and assigned IP address as well as requested host name to a
DNS server and dynamically generate a zone file, I'd never have a
collision problem.  There is limited unique address space even if you
get an IPv6 block, so solving the problem of collisions by having
everyone use global IP blocks is not practical.  One problem I
face for network root, how do I update the hosts file if I'm doing
dynamic dns?

I sent a message to developer thanking him for the software and asking

Not sure what you mean by 'global'. If you mean recognizable everywhere such as .com, .net or .us, I do not believe it to be a registered TLD. It's not listed by IANA as a valid TLD, which means you should never find it on the public internet. Basically, if it's not listed by IANA, it's not valid on the internet. Which means you could use .quimby as your internal TLD, and unless IANA adds it to the list, your good to go.

How would this work? There may be a desire, but I do not see how this would work except in the case of a split horizon DNS where internal hosts resolve one site and external hosts resolve a second site.

How? Magic?

So... based on geography? This is already done. For instance, many sites direct you automatically to the US version of their website when you appear to be coming from a US based IP address. Or to the Canadian version if you appear to be coming from Canada. This is done based on your IP address, which is not fool proof. 

Are you trying to reinvent .us, .uk, .jp, etc?

It sounds like you are trying to re-impliment something that is already available. I still don't see how using www.microsoft.com more than once can point to more than one entity.

So, another level that I have to navigate through to get where I'm going? 

We already do this, in a couple of ways, one of which I pointed out above.

Because that's the way it's set up right now? You can't have two hosts with the same name. (Canonical names aside.) 

You'd still need some host that arbitrates the scoping. SOMEONE would have to be in charge of the 'robinson.org' domain, and send the traffic on to the proper host. 

I see what you are saying, but I don't see how it could work without a major rewrite of DNS. You'd be talking about subnetting the world. You'd still have to have a way for the folks in the UK to get to the hosts in the US, or each entity in the US that also operates in the UK would have to have hosts there too, and then you run into the same issue. 

Besides. How granular do you want to take this? I'm sure there is more than one family in the Portland area with the last name Robinson (Let alone Johnson!). Why restrict the other families from robinson.org just because you happen to get it first?

At this time, the only way I see to implement what you are talking about is to share the domain. One person registers robinson.org, and then allows the other 'family robinsons' to have DNS entries.

Only through co-operation of the holder. There can only be one xerox.com on the internet.

my two cents:

it's worthless to suggest making things any more complicated than they
already are. <rant> i can't imagine having someone successfully type the
suggested options into an address bar when 7/10 people to whom i give a
common (yahoo.com) web address put it into their search bar, and have no
freaking clue what is meant by an 'address bar'. "really, you just
googled yahoo.com?! @)#(IS!!"</end rant> this type of subdivision would
make life for technical support a never ending nightmare.

another issue that instantly springs to mind is trademark. the domains
everyone wishes they could have gotten their hands on, and that a
suggestion like the prior would presumably reopen, typically belong to
global businesses (obvious and hilarious exception being nissan.com)
whose trademarks would protect their brand all over the world.

finally, delimiting tld usage based on function has failed horribly
already, with the masses clustering onto the popular tlds look how
popular *cough* .biz domains are...

i'm much more impressed by the clever naming coming out of the lesser
used tld's, such as happen.in (after checking just now, it appears
they've gone out of business; they were an event tracker for various
metro areas), goo.gl, and the awesome cr.yp.to

Many issues are solved in IPv6 by the introduction of "Unique Local"
address spaces.  (Yes, "Site Local" address spaces made the same
mistake as RFC 1918, which is why they're deprecated.)  Since any host
can have both a unique-local address and a global address, you don't
need NAT, but you can still have address portability when switching
ISPs for internal communications.

There is also a lot of interest in, and tools for, more carefully
managing address assignments and DNS records, though some of that
might still be in flux.

Subject: [PLUG] new Monitor woes or missing Xconfig information
Message-ID: <AANLkTinz0Gj6aPA52UahKcuiJoXrJH+K7OPvtFMb-7r0@mail.gmail.com>

Dear X11 gurus:

The urge to have the latest and greatest monitor hit me, so I procured
a Samsung Syncmaster 2494 monitor, 1920x1080 resolution, digital,
23.6" screen, only to get hit by a fatal bug in my OpenSuse 11.3
operating system.

First of all, I had to plug in a VGA monitor on the ECS GF6100-M754
v1.0 motherboard to tweak the bios to tell it to init the new Nvidia
GF8400gs card, not the onboard GF6100 when coming up initially during
Post.

Then I had to use the VGA plug in the monitor to see what was
happening with the OS on boot up since the digital port initially was
not working.

I finally was able to switch in to digital mode during initial boot,
about 1/3 the way into the bootup, but only in run level 3 (CLI
terminal mode)

When I attempt to go to run level 5, X11 complains and says that it
cannot find a device, hence no screen, then fails.

Well, checking the xconfig file does show the old onboard graphics
card device there, but obviously it is not being used, since the BIOS
loaded the new card.  So I need to install the correct device into
this config file (which says DO NOT MANUALLY EDIT)

The openSUSE 11.3 is supposed to use yast2 to configure, running the
sax2 command (/usr/sbin/sax2) but that's missing in both the location
and on the distribution rpm (I used fileroller to poke around inside
the rpm package, no file!)

So what command do I use to get the correct device for X11?  I did see
a gentoo site using xorg, will this work?  Obviously there's a problem
with no sax2.. but I will take that up with the openSUSE community
shortly.

Refer to http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/xorg-config.xml for an outline.
Will this work??

It is very frustrating to me to upgrade from openSuse 10.3 -->
openSuse 11.0 only to find the monitor not working correctly, then
upgraded to openSuse 11.3 then to find sax2 missing.  It is almost
like my efforts have been purposefully defeated :-)

For now, I do have a very nice 1920x1080 text display in digital
mode.. I admit it looks great!

If you can reference some url or manual, I would be grateful.. All I
am trying to do is to get the Samsung monitor to work under either
Gnome or KDE4 desktop.

Randall

btw. It does PAY to check the support for your video card, I did find
that Nvidia supports linux drivers for the GF8400GS card, which is why
I got that card.

"The first one means this is a name of a private host on a private
network that may or may not access the Internet."

If host is on a "private" network address space such as the 10., or 172.16.,
or 192.168. It is not accessible from the internet because these addresses
are not capable of being routed to from internet routers. You can provide
internet "access" to a privately addressed host via NAT, but they're are not
"unique" hosts on the internet. That uniqueness provided by unique ip
address. So I'm not sure what the point of knowing what the name of a
private host on a private network is if I can't get to it from the public
internet...

"The fourth, NetJapan, means on the Internet in Japan. "The fifth, NetUS,
means on the Internet in the United States naturally."

Country codes already exist.

The point of DNS is to provide a common, meaningful, easy to remember
"vanity" name to a unique 32-bit numerical address within a TLD name space
such as .com, .net, .org. This system was designed for commercial businesses
and organizations and not for every one of the 6 billion people on this
planet to have their own unique domain name.

There is a .name domain for this. Albeit there's not 6 billion unique names
in the world either...

I don't have television service, and have no intentions of getting

It's in good (read: like new.  < 10h use) condition and it is well
supported under Linux.  It does *not* do HD, but it works fine for

To all:

I found out that the sax2 command has been removed purposefully from

The current plan is to use Xorg -configure as the new way to correctly
identify the hardware to the kernel for X11

I did get the digital to work under run level 5, but now when exiting
that mode, I cannot recover to a visible screen, just a black one.

It seems your concern is: what do I name my private IP block? Anything you
want to. Just note that if you re-use an already used domain name you could
cause confusion for yourself or your users. If you already have a domain
name then use that for your public/private DNS needs. If not then make
something up: fizzle.bang.boop, bazzle.bang.boop, etc.

To your recommendation about re-use of public domain names, uh, no thank
you. That would be horribly confusing even for those of us that do know what
the address bar is (hah, googling yahoo.com) and what DNS is. That solution
is begging for squatting and other mischievous/nefarious activities.

I'm pretty sure I didn't have the PVR-250, but my older Hauppauge worked
fine after the comcast box when tuned to channel 3 and another worked from
the VCR composite video feed with sound card left and right for sound.  In
both cases TVTime installed from apt-get worked fine on Ubuntu 7.xx  to
10.04 beta 2.

No I don't think it will, but if you were to hook it up to your cable
box on the analog port and change channels through the box, it
probably would record std def fine.


A card like this could be really handy for converting old VHS and the
like to digital formats, but for modern television, it's going to
become less and less useful.

I suspect it depends on the kind of box you have from Comcast. The 
output on mine is either rf on channel 3/4 or split video and audio on 
RCA jacks. For some reason the customer service folks seem to think that 
the "service is digital" claim means that digital comes out of those 
connections. Since they are designed to connect to analog TVs that's not 
really possible. So, if you have those kind of connections on your box, 
no problem. If all you have is HDMI, then maybe not. I've never had one 
of their boxes that outputs HDMI, so I don't know for sure that they 
don't come with RCA jacks, too.

well I know I can put anything behind the box supplied by comcast, but I was
looking for more of a direct-to-cable solution. At least, I want to be able
to change the channel on the cable box from the device. google tells me that
a pvr250 works with an IR blaster, so that would work fine for me.

Rogan, if no one else has claimed it yet, I am interested in the PVR250.

I don't think there are any boxes you can get that can go direct to 
cable and work with Comcast. It relates to the encryption they use, 
somehow. Some months ago we bought a used ReplayTV 4080 DVR. It has the 
equivalent of an IR blaster. Using gaffers tape one obscures the IR 
window of the Comcast box while affixing the IR transmitter in front of 
it. Now, the Comcast remote is useless and all functionality comes from 
the ReplayTV remote. That means that we no longer use the Comcast 
channel guide. The model ReplayTV we bought comes with a lifetime 
subscription to a channel guide service. If you are building a Myth TV 
box you'll need something similar. IIRC there is a service for about 
$18/year.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1008100604230.10344@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Yesterday I subscribed to the xubuntu mail list and posted the following
message. It's the only one I've seen on the list; that is, there is no
activity there. If folks here cannot provide the appropriate answer, please
point me to an active source that might.

   I've installed xubuntu-10.04 on my wife's Toshiba Satellite. Most of the
time she uses the wireless networking capability for on-line activities. For
some reason no one's been able to explain (or fix), the wireless radio will
not work from the den at the rear of the house (the wireless access point is
in my office at the front of the house). So, I ran a cat5 cable to the den.

   However, even when booting the laptop with the ethernet cable connected,
we cannot get connection to be recognized. The system keeps trying to
connect to a wireless network (we see 6 others in the neighborhood), and I
cannot turn off that search and turn on the wired connection. I've tried
Fn-F8, the wireless switch via the keyboard, but it makes no difference.

   I'm not a ubuntu user other than for her laptop (I've been running
Slackware for years) so I would like to learn how we can switch between
wireless and wired network connections at will.

TIA,

Rich

The big question is whether or not NetworkManager is managing the 
network connections:

   ps -ef | grep Network

If it is, then there should be a little NetworkManager GUI applet that 
will control things. I've never used xubuntu, so I'm not sure where to 
tell you to look.

If NetworkManager is NOT running the show, then the file you'll find 
most helpful is /etc/network/interfaces. Its format is described in 
the interfaces(5) man page. Assuming that your wired interface is 
eth0, you'll probably want a couple lines in that file:

   allow-hotplug eth0
   iface eth0 inet dhcp

Paul,

   Thank you very much. I'll work on this when I again have access to the
machine. We use static IP addresses here on the wired LAN and I'll change
the second line to reflect that.

It'd look something like

iface eth0 inet static
   address 192.168.1.2
   network 192.168.1.0
   netmask 255.255.255.0

   Gotcha', thanks. I know where in Slackware I have this information and now
I know where the 'buntus hold it.

Much grasses,

Looks like your kernel is getting panics.  Don't know from the info but
you could look at /var/log/messages and get a longer output or from dmesg.

There is not enough information from what you are providing to help much more
than to look for more info.

Is your web server attached to the Internet?
Has it been updated for security fixes?

Uh... yeah, that would make me very nervous as well.  Why?  Because of
all of those "90" bytes.  Maybe it's something completely unrelated,
but when attackers craft buffer overflow exploits, it's common to use a
"NOP" sled to give them fudge factor on offsets.  NOP on x86 is 0x90.

As others have asked, is this connected to the Internet?  What
services are exposed?  You might want to get a full packet capture  of
your network traffic while this error pops up.  Contact me off list if
you like.

Server is and has been attached to internet for many years.  It is 
current with all the latest Debian patches.  I'm pretty sure (well, as 
sure as I can be, I guess) that the system has not been compromised by 
evil forces from outside.  I'm wondering if this might be a precursor to 
hardware failure?

Here is some interesting stuff from dmesg:

I have no clue what all that means but the part about the kernel NULL

Debian 4.0 is no longer getting security patches.  I would worry that
someone is logging and and trying to gain root.  If possible, take it off
the net and back it up using a boot-CD.

I've been dealing with old Debian and Ubuntu servers lately.  If you handle
payment-cards, it's no longer acceptable to leave them on your network.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikUZ_HRB7HRAAb3hhT_U9p5bATPm5OXd9dCPOSa@mail.gmail.com>

Well, this hasn't been a good afternoon for me.  While struggling with a new
install of openSUSE 11.3, I found out that it couldn't work with audio CD's,
so I decided to try a trial copy of Ubuntu 10.4.  This is on a 64 bit Athlon
3200+ system (ECS GF6100 M754 v1 mobo) and a GF8400RS PCIx video card to
support the new digital 1080p mode for the new large screen 16x9 monitors.

After installing Ubuntu, and having a dual boot grub so I can choose either
openSUSE or Ubuntu on boot, I cannot get the card to come up in digital mode
at all.  The only output is VGA.

Do I assume correctly that something is wrong with the "nouveau" module?
This is the new kernel module that is supposed to drive the new digital
displays.

I really would like to get the digital mode working.  Do I completely scrub
my 319 Gig hard drive and start over?  I've already used up several days
here trying to get the new system working.

So any suggestions?

Do a full power cycle, not just reset/reboot to see if something in
the hardware got wedged.

Doesn't solve the hardware/driver issue but it's all I got.

Subject: [PLUG] Slackware upgrade trouble...
Message-ID: <1281655495.3164.3.camel@localhost>

I'm trying to upgrade Slackware 10.1 to Slackware 13.

So far, I have determined that upgrading to Slackware 11's glibc is
necessary.  Maybe now xz will work?

I'm getting an error that external command xz cannot be found even
though I can see it under /bin and /usr/bin no problem.  How do I
get pkgtool which I have upgraded to the Slackware 13 version to 
see it?  I have also upgraded tar, had to downgrade it first.  I'm
trying to follow UPGRADE.txt and I'm stuck trying to install 
findutils.

You absolutely can't upgrade from 10.1 to 13 directly. You've got to
step from like 10.1 -> 11.1 to 12 -> 13

Pat moved the package format from tgz to xz as it's a far better
compression format, in fact I believe Fedora is using it some capacity
too.

Is it just glibc that needs to be upgraded 10.1 to 11.0 to 12.0 to 12.2
to 13?  I hate to have to download the whole Slackware 11, 12, and 12.2
distributions.

You're gonna have to do a full package upgrade. glibc, the utils and
pkgtool itself since there was the compression arch change.

Hello,

Though I haven't been on the Slak train in a while, I will say from
experience with other distros, doing upgrades can be bumpy, and doing one
from such distant versions can result in lots of hair-pulling.

Best results are usually from saving your personal data and installing
fresh.  This prevents any issues similar to what you describe.
A good way to do this is to have /home on a separate partition.  This way
you save everything you want to keep in your /home directory, and you just
reformat / (and any other partitions you have).  You can backup your
configurations in /etc and other places temporarily in /home (I usually do
that with tar.gz files).

Michael -

It will take me some time but I have the ISOs going all the way back
to 10.1 and I can setup a virtual machine and figure out the magic
needed to get you up to 13. In my experience though you really can't
jump more than one major revsion. So if you're at 10.1 go to 11.1 then
12.2 and then 13 .. should be doable.

Welcome to Linux, and an unstable ABI between versions  ;)

For example, Solaris has binary compatibility from Solaris 2.3 to 9.0,
no such luck with Linux.

I suggest you upgrade in steps as recommended by the release notes,
major upgrades are rarely supported in big jumps like you're
attempting.

Nothing ;-) Oracle releases an official version and there is the
OpenSolaris project although that seems doomed if I am to believe what
I've read.

Subject: [PLUG] Slackware 13 atapi zip problem...
Message-ID: <1281724371.2100.11.camel@localhost>

Changed the IDE cable to the DVD drive, still low density cable though.

Moved the zip atapi and cdrom drive to the motherboard taking them off
the promise card, which seems to help.  Probably the low density cable
has something to do with this.

Still, if a disk is loaded in the zip drive during boot, I get hdd
flooding the screen seemingly infinitely.  I manually created the hdd4
device node, so that probably isn't the issue.

Ironically, the zip drive is why I moved to Slackware 13.

Uge!

Maybe reorganizing so that the lone DVD drive is on channel 2 where the
cdrom and zip atapi slave are on channel 1 will help???  Is the absence
of a slave device on channel 1 causing a problem???

The motherboard is an ASUS P5A-B with Aladdin V chipset, a K6-2 500,
and 256 megs of PC 100 ram.

At least the Adaptec 1520 is working now and the Bernoulli Multidisk 150
drive is up.  Apparently, using IRQ 9 is a no no where using IRQ 10
works just fine.

I've been occasionally noticing strange errors saying that the reported
size of the zip disk and the actual size are different.

This is just a reminder posting for those that may be interested.  In 
the future, I will post a single announcement of our meetings for at 
least the first few months.

Announcing the first meeting of the Portland R User Group
http://www.meetup.com/portland-r-user-group/
Tuesday August 17th, 7:00pm
Lucky Labrador Brew Pub
915 SE Hawthorne Blvd

At our initial meeting, we'll see how many people in the area use R and
where your interests and backgrounds lie. Once we've made contact, our
meetings may grow to include presentations or tutorials. Come and tell
us what you'd like from your local R user group!

Even if you are unable to come to the meeting, if you are interested in
attending or learning more, please join the meetup group.

Brian Diggs and Homer Strong

Subject: [PLUG] GRUB is too nosy
Message-ID: <1282019371.1524.28.camel@paul-desktop>

OLD BOX:  Win2K and Red Hat dual-booted on a IDE drive
NEW BOX:  WinXP and Ubuntu (now 10.04) dual-boot, each OS on its' own
SATA drive.  Of course, GRUB handles the boot choices.  

I wanted to pull some files off the old IDE drive, so I connected it to
the legacy IDE port on the motherboard.  When I powered up this new
hardware configuration, I was surprised when the GRUB screen asked me to
choose between Win2K and Red Hat Linux.  GRUB preferred the IDE drive to
the two SATA drives.

How do I configure GRUB to prefer the SATA drives over the old IDE
drive?

Sounds like a boot order issue.  Check BIOS.

from what you wrote, i'd say you have separate grub configs on each hdd, and it 
sounds like you loaded grub from the IDE drive, likely because the BIOS is set 
for IDE as priority hdd. if you change your bios to boot from your SATA drive, 
you should be able to access the IDE hard drive as a data drive, and not 
booting from it.

Subject: [PLUG] Samba problem solved...
Message-ID: <1282022902.4974.5.camel@localhost>

For anyone who has upgraded to or past samba-3.2.0, Win9x and WinME
clients stopped working.  The reason they stopped working is that newer
versions of Samba turn lanman authentication and plaintext
authentication off by default.  Three lines added to smb.conf and
redoing the passwords fixes the problem, but I wish a better solution
was offered.  Win9x and WinMe are capable of accepting third party
networking software.  Why not implement NT style passwords on these
older versions of Windows that some people are stuck with for 
whatever reason?  To what degree is support of lanman style passwords
needed for Win9x and WinME clients?  Do individual Win9x apps expect
lanman style passwords, or is this abstracted properly?  A free
replacement Microsoft style networking stack for Win9x that does
NT style passwords and hashing would be great.

Related question, how do you keep grub when there is a SATA drive from
not booting via the IDE drive?  If I turn on my 2T external Sata drive
before booting off an internal IDE drive, the boot fails.  Turn the SATA
drive on later though, no problem.  In the bios I have said boot from
the IDE drive and grub comes up okay, but then it goes to the SATA drive
somehow (maybe how it orders the drives) and doesn't find the Linux
system.  There has to be way to map the IDE drive as coming before any
SATA drive in grub.

  Teach your distribution to identify the root file system by UUID, 
rather than by /dev filename.

I think theres more to worry about while running Win9x or WinME than
porting new versions of SMB to them, along with all the required
security modules...

Is that the problem with not-so-open SuSE?

We wanted to use SuSE for some control systems but were unable to make a 
replacement disk on a computer back at the office and get it to boot 
when it got to the field (on a computer other than the one the disk was 
created on).

It sounds more like a problem with the grub configuration. If you take a
disk out of one computer and put it into another computer then it can appear
to be a different device on the other machine (what was /dev/sda is now
/dev/sdc or ...). The more modern GRUBs get around this problem by using
UUIDs like
UUID=e0dcbbf3-a4fa-4e94-9ec0-c0466aa6fb9d
 to identify the disk instead of device descriptions like /dev/sda.   Does
the grub on your replacement disk use UUIDs?
Also, when you test the replacement disk at the office is it the only one in
the machine? It could be that you are actually booting off another disk in
the system.  When you boot the disk in the field does it get to the GRUB
menu?

How did you originally install it? Have you attempted a re-install
using CPAN to manage dependencies? I suspect the root issue is some
missing bit that doesn't exist on your system that SC is dependent
upon.

I installed perl-5.8.6 to /usr/local/bin from source and manually
reinstalled what the MailSpamcannibal source says are the perl

Maybe you can tell me. After a SuSE screen to choose what mode to boot,
Open SuSE 11.1
Open SuSE 11.1 (Failsafe) etc...

it starts booting, switches to a screen with a "progress bar". The 
progress bar is stuck on the left side and after a couple seconds, a 
console type black and white screen appears with the last lines reading:

Could not find /dev/disk/by-id/ata-WDC_WD800JB-00JJC0_WD-WMAM9CUM7063-part2.
Want me to fall back to /dev/sda2? (Y/n)

Obviously it found the disk, the only disk on the machines in both 
cases, and loaded some sort of boot menu. Why it could (would) not find 
(mount) the / partition seems to me to be the result of some sort of 
over complication. I have been using Linux since 1995 and OpenSuSE 11.1 
is the first distribution I have encountered that would only boot on the 
machine it was originally installed on.

Don't spend a lot of time on this, we went back to our original 
distribution and are happy. But I am curious, is this an example of UUID?

Yes.

Subject: [PLUG] Financial security on the net
Message-ID: <20100817204138.57a8081f@mailhost.pdx.edu>

Today I received a phone call from "Tiffany" at monster.com. Tiffany
wanted to confirm an order I placed for a job listing. The bill for the
order came to $425, to be billed to my debit card.

I had never heard of monster.com, and I have no job offerings, nor am I
seeking a job, and I certainly never placed the order. The conversation
proceeded with much confusion as I tried to figure out what Tiffany was
talking about. 

Eventually I asked her to give me the last four digits of the debit
card the order was to be billed to. Upon hearing the numbers I
instantly knew the account in question was a commercial account at US
Bank that I use for my publishing business. And because I buy a lot of
printer parts and supplies on eBay, this is the bank account that my
PayPal account is connected to. I have been using the same bank and
PayPal/eBay arrangements for nearly ten years and have never had a
problem.

I have also used this debit account to buy other things for my printing
business, including computer parts. I even used the account to pay
tuition at PSU. Many of these transactions have been on the net, and
many others have been in person using the actual card.

Once Tiffany and I came to the conclusion that the order was bogus
Tiffany quickly canceled it. And upon hanging up the phone I
immediately called US Bank. It turns out that there was a charge for $1
to zero.com for internet services, and a charge to Lowe's for $2004.99.
Both these charges had been immediately reversed by the merchants in
question. Neither US Bank nor I have lost a penny. Whew!

Of course, the US Bank employee I spoke to immediately canceled the
card and entered it to be reissued with a new number. He also informed
me that the bank would be sending me a Fraud Statement form that I must
fill out in order to "save my credit rating." I don't know what this
episode has to do with my personal credit rating, especially as I don't
actually have a credit rating. But I will certainly do everything in my
power to assist the bank and the authorities in bringing the malfeasor
to justice.

The interesting thing is not that someone acquired the card number, but
that apparently they also have my name, address, and phone number. From
the present evidence I don't know if they have other information - my
social, my date of birth, the three digits on the back of the card,
etc. But the fact that they have my address and telephone number
suggests that the miscreant is an employee of an internet merchant.
Local merchants never ask for that information because they merely rely
on my presenting the card and entering the correct PIN into their
terminal.

Buying stuff on the net not only usually saves me money, it also saves
me time. Just place the order and a few days later it shows up. I've
even ordered computer parts from Fry's in Wilsonville over the net,
just because it's a PITA to drive to Wilsonville. I'd hate to crawl
into a shell and refuse to buy on the net just because of a close call.
On the other hand, my question for the collective wisdom of the list
is, what steps can a person take when buying on the net to maximize
security? Like, is there a short list of signs that a site is safe that
I can use without having to earn a degree in web security systems? As
always when responding to my questions, assume you are talking to an
idiot.

That looks like your problem. The by-id disk name may not be the same from
system to system and so GRUB can't find the disk. If you wanted to fix this
you should switch to uuids. The uuids are in /dev/disk/by-uuid/.
If you go to that directory and do ls -altr  you will see which uuid is
associated with which partition.

The same problem that grub has, fstab also has.  You should use uuids in
fstab  to indicate which partitions to mount where. For example  here is my
/ partition in /etc/fstab

 UUID=e0dcbbf3-a4fa-4a94-9ee0-c0466aa6fb9d       /               jfs
errors=remount-ro 0       1

The older bioses were simpler. The boot disk was usually /dev/hda and this
was pretty consistent from bios to bios. The newer motherboards are more
complex and hence the more complexity in grub and fstab.

No, I shan't assume that ... the usual cautions about eBay and PayPal 
apply, of course ... they have proved over the years to be somewhat 
infested, as one might expect from any such open bazaar.

However, the real core of my advice is to (if you don't already) get 
into online banking, and (if you don't already) check it every day ... 
at least once a day.
My experience has been that if one spots an "issue" or a potential 
issue, the bank will normally be willing to supply the phone number of 
the merchant/vendor and often a phone call will end the matter there.

And a repeat of the standard:  buy only from known and trusted (fill in 
the blank) ... refer to the "eBay and PayPal" reference above ... please 
note that the infestation of a few is most unfortunately tainting the 
many unfairly, none the less caution is advised.

All that said, canceling the card, based the detail you have provided, 
is the right move.

Your mileage may vary.

Hope this helps
Regards
Fred James

John,

   Whenever the connection between you and the merchant/bank is secured
you'll see a small closed padlock icon on the status line of the browser
window. This usually means that the data is passed through the SSL (Secure
Socket Layer) to minimize or eliminate man-in-the-middle attacks. Some sites
show an open padlock. When I see that I call the company and order over the
telephone and tell them their server is not at all secure.

   If the data are stolen by someone at the company or bank, all bets are
off.

   Many other PLUGgers know much more than do I about this and will both
educate you and correct any inadvertent mis-statements above.

You can't.  Even if a merchant is trusted, the employees may not be
trustworthy or their database could get broken into and have all of
your info stolen.  I work on investigations of systems when this kind
of thing happens and I can tell you it is *very* frequent and only a
fraction of companies notify customers when it happens, even though it
is required by state law.


Yet, I constantly buy stuff online.  How do I feel safe?  Credit laws.
See:
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card_fraud#Cardholder_liability

Use a credit card (don't buy online with a debit card where it
requires you to enter a PIN) and keep an eye on your statement.  If
there's ever any charges that aren't yours, get them removed and have
them reissue you a card.

So if you don't end up paying for fraud, who does?  The merchant who
accepted the fraudulent charges does.  Ultimately, they should have
done a better job validating the card and your identity, so they eat
it.  This is one reason CVV2 numbers are used.  Merchants are required
*not* to store these numbers after the transaction has cleared.  If
all merchants do this and use CVV2 numbers, it makes it quite a bit
harder to reuse a card after a database has been stolen.

HTH,
tim

That would be the question ... one which I should decline to answer 
specifically, except to offer the usual advice ... always check the 
ratings and the comments behind the ratings.  In other words, what have 
been the experiences of other buyers with any one particular vendor?  
The same can be asked of any particular product, in some cases.  But 
this whole problem isn't new, or specific to the Internet ... such 
things are not at all unknown in the "brick and mortar" world.

One could add ... it looks too good to be true, it probably is ... but 
your particular question concerns identity theft, not a product and 
possibly not a merchant.  All the same it is just more reason to be 
cautious about who you deal with.  Capitalism is at core a very mean and 
competitive world view.  That isn't a criticism ... it is just better to 
see what is.

With that, I wish you good luck.
Regards
Fred James

I don't know how effective this is, but my Paypal account is connected
to a disposable checking account which I keep essentially empty.  I 
have other accounts that are not connected to Paypal and never 
should be.  I never do debit transactions online.  Stick with Paypal
accepting merchants, Paypal insurance should kick in.

Online banking is growing, what protection is there if the bad guys get
your login name and password?  Online banking allows you to keep close
tabs on your money, but this convenience probably constitutes a risk.
I don't do online banking via blackberry or iphone, so I suppose I'm
somewhat safer than people who do.  The problem is, the computer you
access the bank with may save your bank login and password.  Another
risk is that someone will install a keylogger instead of stealing
your iphone or blackberry.

Capitalism only works when people are altruistic.  Socialism and
communism fail when people are not self centered enough.  There is
indeed an ethical theory that elevates self interest over public
interest and there are some positives to it.  Most people know best
what their needs are and will pursue them with more interest and skill
than someone else will.  With people taking care of themselves, society
as a whole benefits.  Excessive greed destroys capitalistic societies,
though in a communist or socialist society a healthy amount of greed
helps.

This is getting away from what the discussion is about though.  The
discussion seems to be about identity theft and online shopping.  The
current system of social security numbers, debit cards that are pin
activated, and Paypal is still problematic.  National ID cards that are
not easily faked might help reduce fraud and illegal immigration too,
but that is another issue.  On the other hand, if National ID cards are
faked...

Excessive self interest will destroy a Democratic Republic before any
external force will.  Digital commerce is clearly not safe enough yet
with identity theft being a huge problem costing billions I believe.

Some experts advise exactly the opposite.
Last week, the PBS Newshour did a series of reports from DEF CON 18. 
Some of the "experts" interviewed outright stated that online banking 
was a huge financial security risk.

Your mileage may vary.

I don't know about yours, but with my online banking access, I am
hard-pressed to find any information in there that could actually be used to
take money from me. I cannot initiate any transfers out of accounts I own
without lengthy verification processes, all of which generate notifications
to me via email.

My full account numbers are deeply hidden requiring many clicks to uncover,
but just having the account number is not enough to cause me any real harm.

My name and address are there, but anyone I write a check to or buy online
from have those. Plus with a check, they have my account number too.

Pretty much the only useful information one could gain from having my online
banking login info is how much money I have. I suppose this could be used to
determine whether I am a valuable target for identity theft. Aside from
that, I doubt anyone would find my buying habits particularly interesting. I
would not panic if I found out anyone got ahold of my online banking login
or password.

Grub usually has something like:

(hd0,0)

in the grub.conf file.

I want to replace this with a reference that is always correct
regardless of whether or not I plug in another hard drive or change the
ordering of hard drives.

Is this possible?

tim,

thanks for that link, there's some good information in that article. I
deal with fraud claims a lot at work, and this will definitely be a
reference i provide to victims of fraud in the future.

One thing I do is I keep only a "small" amount in the account I do any
Debit Card
transactions with. Most of the time it only has $300-400 in it. It is
a hassle but
I look at it as a sacrificial line of defense.

another thing i've started seeing a lot of people doing, which seems
fairly intelligent, is to use pre-paid cards for online transactions. the
only downside to this is that lots of merchants require address validation
be performed to reduce their exposure to chargebacks. fortunately the
pre-paid cards have a number where you can call the vendor (visa/mstr,
whatev) and add an address in their system so the card can pass AVS.

That's a lot of opportunities for leakage.  PayPal and Flea-bay should be
safe, but other online vendors and in-person transactions (e.g. PSU) can be
pretty leaky.  (My brother had his card# stolen by a kid at a local battery
store.)  Hopefully, Monster can cooperate in identifying the miscreant.
(Why would someone use a fraudulent card# to buy a job ad?  Some sort of
advance-fee fraud?)

Excellent, and good job on limiting the damage!

There's usually enough info in the transaction to get the rest.

Just to reiterate the point...

I made a large (in my budget) purchase at Office Depot (brick and mortar version).  Almost one year later I get a call from the Fraud Dep't. of my credit union wondering if I am travelling again and currently in Florida.  I state the obvious of you called my home phone and I answered.  I am not currently in Florida.  Seems someone at Office Depot was testing my card to see if they could make a purchase using my hard earned funds.

If the prepaid only has enough for the purchase available, when the 
online company tests the card for $1 to make sure it is a valid card, 
then the transaction won't go through for lack of $1.  I found this out 
when I ordered a ham radio online.

This is true, and something to plan for. It's also why lots of merchants are switching to zero dollar auth checks, though this also comes w/ headaches, as not all card issuers support it, and may decline zero dollar auths even if funds are available.

when I ordered a ham radio online.

Thanks to all who responded, especially Tim. The wikipedia link was
very helpful and informative.

I would like to know all the details of each of the three attempted
transactions. I am guessing that they were online because the card is
still in my pocket. But at this point US Bank has not supplied me with
any of the details. Of course, they are probably just beginning the
investigation. Or maybe they don't even investigate unless they lose
money. If it's as common a problem as Tim says, then it's probably not
cost effective for them to spend efforts investigating when there's
nothing to be recovered. Having your moral outrage vindicated does
nothing for the corporate bottom line.

After reading all the replies and links I am pretty sure the problem
was not an evil merchant. It was almost undoubtedly a dishonest
employee of an online merchant. And I haven't used my PayPal/eBay
accounts for over six months, so those are unlikely sources of the
leak. In fact the entire account has been seldom used lately. The most
recent online transaction I can recall was Amazon from a few months
ago. 

It just occurred to me that Amazon does keep my card data. In
Firefox I have Amazon blocked from saving cookies on my computer
because it annoys the hell out of me to go to Amazon and have the web
site immediately say "hello John!" and "we have new items that we are
sure you can't wait to buy." So I use Firefox to browse Amazon
anonymously, but if I actually want to buy something I use Opera, where
I let Amazon give me its cookies. 

I do a lot of online shopping, but seldom actually buy. Once in a while
an online merchant's web site does not allow me to find out how much
shipping costs unless I add the item to my shopping cart and proceed to
checkout. I might go that far in order to find out the shipping
charges for the item, but I absolutely never proceed to give a card
number. 

I should add that my password with US Bank has not been compromised. No
one can log in to my account. In fact, not even me. I have never been
able to get US Bank to recognize my password. A long time ago I gave up
trying to see my account online. In any event, I am not the victim of a
keylogger or other exploit typical of Windows computers. I use only
Linux, except for Windows 2000 which is installed in Virtualbox OSE.
And my computer is behind a router with firewall at home. The present
situation is just a case of someone acquiring the card number, name,
address and phone number from an online merchant. It's possible that
the malfeasor did so by hacking the transmission of data between my
computer and the merchant, but it's more likely that it was an inside
job. There's a merchant out there with a dishonest employee.

This is an excellent point.
You often end of doing business with people who may or may not be
trust worthy.  This happens in person as well as over the internet.  I
mean, how do I know the anonymous clerk at some store in Portland is
honest and not going to try to misuse my credit card?  I don't.
Indeed, I had a problem with some false charges to one of my accounts
a couple years ago.  As near as I can tell, some clerk in Florida
copied my credit card when I used it to make a purchase at a store
while on vacation in Florida.  My bank (US Bank) caught the problem
right away and it wasn't much of a problem for me; but it would have
been if the bank had missed it.

And the chances and fraud like this happening is much greater with
on-line transactions.

Basically, our current payment systems (personal checks, debit cards,
credit cards) are not very secure and this invites fraud when we have
so many transactions between buyers and sellers who have no personal
relationship with one another.  Our systems need to change to fit this
new environment.  And as I understand, Europeans have been making some
changes in the way they transact with debit and credit cards.

Message-ID: <20100820211141.vwx4elnrgg4gks4c@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I'm running Slackware 13.0, fresh install.

My wireless card is an Alvarion PC DS11.b connected to the computer  
via a PLX adapter ( a pcmcia adapter ).  I notice at boot a search for  
agere something firmware.  I'm also noticing if I don't continuously  
broadcast ping that I lose connectivity.  The original wireless card  
is an SMC variety and it's junk as far as I can tell.

The signal strength seems to vary a lot along with the speed.  With  
dhclient I am getting a network is down cannot receive packet error.   
Sometimes after that though, I do have connectivity.

No idea. I've never run perl scripts in any directory other than
cgi-bin and is the script owned by the at least owned by the apache
user or group? That would cause perm denied methinks or if it's not
chmodded correctly.

I believe your assumption is wrong. In this context, the ~/public_html would resolve to the user apache is running as at the time apache parses this entry in the config file.

What are the permissions on the file?  Can the web server read and

Any thoughts on why the config file sc_web.conf can't be opened???

I suspected the inability to open this file is somehow connected to why

Crap.  I'm sorry to hear that!

Leave the drive overnight in the freezer.  You might get it to spin up long
enough to get critical files off.

Usually, that beeping is the motor trying to spin up the drive, because
the coils have shorted, the bearings have frozen or the head has stuck to
the platter.  Software won't help.

Message-ID: <20100827204006.1366bbb1@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I am trying to watch an old Korean movie. I do not speak Korean. The
movie is not available anywhere, and is probably out of copyright. I
found and downloaded a copy, but it is in two CD files of 700 MB each.
The person who created the files did not include a file for subtitles. 

Separately I found two versions of subtitles for the movie. In VLC
they work great with the first CD file, but when I try to continue with
the second CD file the subtitles start over from the beginning. VLC
extended controls offer an offset, but only up to 60 seconds.

I've poked around for the past half hour, but haven't hit on a
solution. Does anyone have any suggestions for how to get VLC to play
both CD files in sequence automatically using the same subtitles file?

Thanks for the suggestion. It plays the second CD file right after the
first one ends, but the subtitles start again at the beginning of the
first file.

I think I need to concatenate the .avi files into one .avi file.

Why not split the subtitles file so you have one for each CD?

That was my first thought, but I didn't do it because I know nothing of
how subtitles files work. They appear to be text files, but each line is
preceded by numbers in braces, e.g.:

{4597}{4656}Please proceed to Gate 3 now.

I am guessing that the numbers have to do with timing, but I can't make
sense of them. The above subtitle appears a few minutes into the first
CD.

There is also a "header" line that appears at the beginning of the file
and seems important. The first line says:

{1}{1}23.976

Again, I need to gather up some clues.

Another thought I had was to concatenate the two CD files, which are
in .avi format. Once again I am short of clues. But considering how
many people work with video I suppose there is a tool somewhere in my
Fedora 11 repos which will do the job. 

Then again, it might be easier to learn Korean.

Those are frame numbers you're seeing (begin showing at frame a, stop
showing at frame b), and that 23.976 is frame rate (frames/sec) of the
recording.

If you can how many frames are in the first half of the film, it should be
an easy matter and a bit of scripting to subtract the number of frames in
the first film and viola!  It looks like a rather fun learning project,
actually :)

I agree that the easiest solution is likely to combine the two video files.
The fact that the filename ends in ".avi" doesn't tell us anything about
what format the video is in. But, there is nothing wrong with trying and
seeing what happens.

cp cd1.avi movie.avi
cat cd2.avi >> movie.avi

now see if movie.avi plays in VLC, and if you can seek past the end of the
first movie. Then add in the subtitles and you're golden.

If this doesn't work, it's probably in a non-linear video format. You
"might" be able to correct this by converting it. You can use a tool such as
ffmpeg to convert the part files to raw MPEG, then combine them with the
above method.

I'm trying to get an IBM Power System running IBM i ( OS/400 - i5/OS ) 
configured.  I can get get the mount cmd to mount the connection but 
then I don't have authority to the even view the contents.

Anyone out there willing to a take guess as to the problem?

Sounds like you need to adjust the mount options, umasks of the source
folders/files, and starting of NFS services.

Here's a sample line from /etc/exports on the NFS server:

/var/public 192.168.1.0/24(no_subtree_check,rw,no_root_squash)

Then on the client machine I add a line like the following to /etc/fstab:

ns.pippiandcarlos.com:/var/public /home/ckonstanski/public    nfs
defaults,user,noauto   0 0

Make sure that the shared files and folders on the NFS server have at
minimum these "ordinary" permissions: 755 on folders and 644 on files.
Whether it is strictly necessary is something I have not tested personally;
but it's a good starting point for your own investigations. Setting
permissions "looser", i.e. 777 on folders and 666 on files, is not necessary.

Services: On the server I run nfs and portmap. On the client I run portmap,
rpc.idmapd, rpc.pipefs and rpc.statd.

Type "mount /home/ckonstanski/public" (substitute your own path) to mount
the NFS share according to the rules in /etc/fstab. Don't type something
like "mount -t nfs ns:/var/public /home/ckonstanski/public" because you'll
bypass fstab if you tell mount everything it needs to know on the command line.

Hello,

My wife and I are having a yard sale at NE 7th and Halsey.  I have a box of Linux magazines available for free.  We're in the courtyard of the Cornerstone apartment building.  Today only.

   Probably better to futz with it rather than putz it. Yes, they're both
Yiddish, but there's quite a difference between the two. :-) (The latter
refers to the claimed results of all the quicker-dicker-upper spam we

On this topic:  I've just ordered a T410s for a friend.  The T410 does 
still use a magnesium alloy frame, but the "s" model uses glass fiber and 
carbon to achieve better-than-standard durability at a lower weight. 
They're not Toughbooks, but they'll do for most people not climbing 
mountains with their computers in tow.

I don't think that's the case.   I think it's more true to say that 
business is less oriented toward 8.5x11 pages and vertically-oriented 
content.

A screen with an aspect ratio closer to that of a keyboard makes sense for 
a folding computer (where the screen falls against the keyboard... duh).

Right.  It makes them smaller and lighter.  I don't think anyone believes 
a 14.1 widescreen is larger in square inches than a 14.1 4:3 screen... at 
least not anybody who paid any attention to geometry in middle school. 
You're seeing deception where there is none.

And as you note, pixels are where the real estate is:

So you're making a 17" laptop with the sides lopped off.

Why, again?  Oh, right.  Because you can't stop thinking about paper and 
portraits instead of letting form and function interact in a sensible way 
and let our concept of presentation evolve with our media.

(This reminds me of your other comment around this time about wanting a 
multi-column terminal display for long text files.  Just write longer 
lines and use a wider terminal!)

So there it is.  If you want to upgrade your 14.1" laptop to get more 
screen and probably a more appropriately-sized keyboard (with less dead 
space, front-to-back), you get a 15.6 in wide.  You shave an inch off the 
height and gain a couple of inches on the side and the screen is more 
appropriately scaled to the chassis without compromising keyboard space. 
Heck, on the larger models, you can even slip in a ten-key pad and have a 
real keyboard.

By your measure, that's about a third of an inch.  Good, you can lie 
another pen next to your keyboard for all that paper you're printing off 
all the time (obviously you're printing off paper -- otherwise, why would 
you care about 8.5x11 screen layout?)

Who uses word processors?  If you're writing for publication, you're doing 
it in LaTeX anyway, right?  And if that's the case and you want to view 
your output 2-up, then you'll also need room for your editor window also. 
Give that a standard 80 columns and you've just filled your widescreen.

I'm mystified that they accepted keyboards.  Such is how we adapt to our 
changing technologies, dinosaur.

What is it with you and output pages?!?   Output, today, is web pages and 
slide presentations and those are the same aspect ratio as the screens on 
which they are created.

It's my understanding that pages are usually taller than they are wide 
because the lead used to separate the letter blocks would compress upon 
successive imprints (whereas the lines themselves were separated by more 
elastic stuff) and the letters would drift loose.  Fewer characters 
left-to-right meant less visible drift and less resetting of type.  (The 
length, however, had to do with paper-making and the reasonable reach of a 
person's arms in those days.)

Anyway, widescreen's super nice.  Indeed, it's so nice that I absolutely 
love working with my 15.6" Thinkpad docked on my desktop next to a 21" 
widescreen monitor of an identical pixel count/ratio (1680x1050).  The 21" 
screen rotates and can be used to view huge versions of pages typeset for 
portrait printing or from downloaded PDFs published at paper aspects. 
However, reading lots of written text on the screen (like, say, a 
Wikipedia page) is much easier for me with the screen set in landscape 
position (I can also better read the text on my often-numerous browser 
tabs).

J.

The cat solution did not work. It appeared to work, the hard disk
blinked for a long time, but the resulting file played only the first
CD.

Then I started looking around. First I tried Pitivi video editor, but it
was incapable of much of anything. Then I tried Avidemux, and success!

concatenate two files (File > Open, then File > Append), and it

This is not the first time I have encountered a movie split into more
than one file so it would fit on CDs. Now I know how to put them
together. Per aspera ad astra.

Another possible solution for you is to use either subtitleeditor or
subtitlecomposer which are both in the ubuntu repositories.  These let you
edit, split, combine the subtitles.  I have not used them myself, but are
likely to be a faster method than manipulating the large avi files.

? ? Berkeley DB originated at the University of California,
? ? Berkeley as part of the transition (1986 to 1994) from 4.3BSD
? ? to 4.4BSD and of the effort to remove AT&T-encumbered code.
? ? It has evolved a great deal since then and is now part
? ? of Oracle where it is distributed with source code under
? ? a dual use license.

? ? Berkeley DB (BDB) is a computer software library that provides
? ? a high-performance embedded database, with bindings in C, C++,
? ? PHP, Java, Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, Smalltalk, and other languages.
? ? BDB stores arbitrary key/data pairs as byte arrays, and supports
? ? multiple data items for a single key. BDB can support thousands
? ? of simultaneous threads of control or concurrent processes
? ? manipulating databases as large as 256 terabytes, on a wide
? ? variety of operating systems including most Unix-like and
? ? Windows systems, and real-time operating systems.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1008301524050.28220@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Has anyone here used the gocr tool on scanned pdf files successfully? If
so, please share your experiences with me.

   I converted the .pdf to .ps, but gocr didn't like that because it could
not find ghostscript (/usr/bin/gs); it was looking in the wrong place:

pstopnm: Error looking for Ghostscript program. stat("/usr/local/bin/java/gs")

   The pstopnm man page does not tell me how to point it to the proper
directory for gs. A soft link to that directory (which is itself a soft
link) also fails.

   Then I tried 'convert' and the gocr output was useless.

You should have better luck going from PDF directly to a format gocr likes.
I was just able to use "convert" to convert a multipage scanned PDF to a
PNM, a TIF and a series of PNG files.

A scanned PDF is kind of simplified, and much easier to deal with than a PS
file with an embedded raster image.

I created a pendrive using USB create and Ubuntu 10.4 as set forth on the Ubuntu website.  When loaded the program demands logon information.  I cannot find the user name and password and did not set one.  I also do not know how to get past the gui to get to a command line.  Thank you in advance for any help.

Not sure of the exact steps you took but I had a similar problem with one of
the betas.  Here is how I got around it...

When booting, hold down on the shift key to show the GRUB menu.
>From the menu, select the RECOVERY option, this will give you access to a
root prompt
At this point you can change the password for any user, so just change it to
one that you can remember
when done, simply reboot and you should be able to log in using the new
password.

Subject: [PLUG] Hard drive dilemna...
Message-ID: <1283319262.3501.24.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I'm a little tight right now and have noticed that my hard drive in 
one of my servers is dying.  The problem is, that hard drive is ATA 
100 and the motherboard doesn't support serial ATA.  I don't need a 
more powerful server, but the Serial ATA push does pose a problem.
  
I bit the bullet and bought 2 ATA 100 250 GB drives on EBay.  I 
figure I can keep one sealed for when the other drive wears out.  
How long do I have to stock up on ATA 100 drives and as needed 
80 wire cable?  Is there a cheap way to refurbish working drives 
that are starting to have trouble?  What thoughts can people offer 
on adding PCI cards that support SATA to older PIII systems?

What I'm looking at is sinking maybe $100/month into ATA 100 
hard drives to stock up for when the drives I am using now 
wear out.  I figure if I keep a drive in the sealed anti 
static bag that it shouldn't wear out.

Should I stock up on ATA 100 hard drives for when my current drives 
wear out, or is there a Serial ATA PCI card I should get that works 
well under Linux?  Do I have to get new power supplies if I purchase 
PCI SATA cards?

This problem goes beyond just my servers.  I have a mixed environment
of computers where many of them use PATA hard drives exclusively.

Subject: [PLUG] Video card dilemna...
Message-ID: <1283319621.3501.30.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I switched from a Radeon HD 3450 AGP 4x/8x card to an NVIDIA 4x/8x 6200
AGP card.  First problem at least for Fedora 12 is that I have to use a
proprietary driver instead of the nouveau driver.  Second issue, the
proprietary driver doesn't seem to support text consoles.  Another
problem that has come up when I try to run Dirk Dashing or Eschalon 
Book I full screen is that the game isn't fit to the screen.

On the up side, I can report that Eschalon Book I at least runs much
much faster with the NVIDIA card than it does with the Radeon HD card
and the random crashing issue seems to have gone away.  On the downside,
looking for a Linux compatible video card and then having to use an
imperfect proprietary driver isn't cool.

Slackware 13 seems to be able to support the NVIDIA card with an OSS
driver which is odd.

Had you posted yesterday, I would have given you a PCI SATA controller
card.  As it is, you can find one at FreeGeek if you get there soon. :)

I would recommend something along the lines of this
http://www.cooldrives.com/sata-drive-to-ide-converter-mini.html as being a
better solution for your situation.
These are cheap and should be invisible to your OS so you shouldn't have any
compatibility problems.  Of course, I have not tried them so I cannot speak
from experience.

Refurbishing HDDs is just asking for failure.  Motors and bearings wear out
with use.  You could extend the life of a few drives by swapping controller
boards if two identical drives fail in different ways, but it is not likely
to be worth your trouble.

The only factor I can think of that could possibly be a problem with just
stocking up on IDE drives, is with the platters beginning to sag over time.
I know this used to be an issue, but not sure if it is still a problem.  If
it is still relevant, I imagine it could be controlled by simply rotating
the drives 180 degrees, each year while in storage.  I would recommend
researching further...

I think your best bet is to use an IDE to SATA adapter, this way, you can
take advantage of the latest in technology and energy savings, while also
making sure the drives you use are new and under warranty.  Also, this way,
if you ever upgrade to a new server, you won't be searching around trying to
find a way to use IDE drives with a motherboard that only supports SATA (or
newer).

Just my 2 cents worth,
Jason

Locals ENU and Iguana Micro have New ATA drives.
Also Newegg and Mwave both still carry new ATA devices.

As long as you really have a sealed bag not just taped shut.  Also you need
to control your storage environment.  The shipping boxes for them
would be better
than the raw anti-static bag.  Storing them flat is not recommended.
Side or end.

If you can find any, use the SAS cards.  They are more expensive but would
allow you to handle both SATA and SAS drives.

As far as SATA plug in cards that work with linux.  Highpoint, Marvell
and Silicon Systems are the
controllers that I have used in the past.

This is were it starts to be cheaper to think about moving the
computer services onto one
machine running virtual images unless you really like tinkering with
old equipment.

Just the savings in power might save enough on cooling requirements to
make the switch.
