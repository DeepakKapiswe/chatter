   I cannot find the answer in my ORA book; probably because I don't know
where to look in the index.

   Now and then I untinkingly, and mistakenly, hit some key combination that
changes the buffer status bar at the lower left corner from --:-- to -1>:--
or -1:--. When the former appears, single and double quotes are underlined
and characters have accents. I can change from the second to third form by
pressing the Winduhs key with the quote key.

   What do the -1 and -1> signify? What might I have done to produce them,
and how do I change the display and behavior back to normal?

I am still looking for a speaker for Advanced Topics for November 17th.

There was some interest at Intel, but nothing ever came of it.

Anyone interested or know of a speaker?

-cs:ch-fr  buf      pos line   (major minor)------

cs states the coding system used for the file you are editing. A dash
indicates the default state of affairs: no code conversion, except for
end-of-line translation if the file contents call for that. `=' means
no conversion whatsoever. Nontrivial code conversions are represented
by various letters-for example, `1' refers to ISO Latin-1. See Coding
Systems, for more information.

I use german-postfix input method quite a lot, but I never paid
attention to the mode line.  But I can tell you that I must hit C-\
(toggle input method) to enter the mode.  That's awfully close to
C-ENTER or C-BACKSPACE.

   In 1979 I wrote my dissertation using TDP (Text and Document Processor) on
a HP-3000 minicomputer. This was (is?) a line-oriented editor with a short
line length that required users to end each line with the [Enter] key or the
excess was truncated. To add text, one positioned the cursor at the desired
place and pressed the 'a' key. To modify text, one used the 'm' key; to
insert, 'i' key and so on. It was an extreme PITA, but better than an
electric typewriter, especially when committee mandated changes had to be
made. Every time I have to use vi I'm reminded of this primative editing
tool.

   The output device was also different from what we're used to using today.
It was an IBM Diablo electronic printer; essentially an electric typewriter
fed by the TDP system. One had to stand there and roll in a new page by hand
-- just as with a regular typewriter -- before pressing the [Enter] key to
print that one page. Of course, it was fun watching it print in both
directions, but the amusement faded quickly with a multi-hundred page
document that needed multiple copies.

   So, you stick with vi and I'll stick with emacs.

Go easy on the kids, Rich.  The emacs learning curve isn't for
everybody.  Either you have the emacs gene, or you don't.  Anyone can
learn vi.

Shortly before leaving Prime Computer I started to learn emacs. I was
really starting to get into it, too. But then I went to Apollo and was
bitten by the GUI bug. While I can use vi on occasion, I often have to
get out the cheat sheet to be reminded what key to hit. As for emacs, I
did try to get into it a bit in the last 5 years, but find GUI editors
like Kate for plain text editing, and Word Perfect for fancy documents
to be more to my liking.

So, how do I get emacs to read a vim modeline?  I see that vim has a 
plugin for reading the emacs File "Local Variables" section, but I 
would rather things work the other way around because the vim modeline 
is (like most of vim) nice and terse.

  # vim:ts=2:sw=2:et:sta

vs

  # Local Variables:
  # indent-tabs-mode:nil
  # ...
  # End:

This is particularly necessary in open source projects given that emacs 
defaults to mix tabs and spaces (huh?).

Apparently the '-*-' line must be the first or second line, so for this 
stuff to live at the end of the file it has to be the extremely 
verbose "Local Variables" chunk?

Is that append or prepend? I ask because I've always entered hex

Man, using a computer in 1979 must've sucked, I wasn't even born then. I
didn't use a computer until 2003, and Linux until about 6 months ago. I have
to admit that I use vi for two reasons: when I first saw a team of
administrators at my work using it, it looked cool. I was using microsoft
word before, now I would rather chisel in stone than use that. the other
reason: I've read it's on more *nix machine by default, and that seems
pretty good if you're in trouble, or in a strange environment. I would
probably only get into Emacs just to see whether or not the learning curve
is shaped in a sprial, like I've seen online, I doubt it.

   It was better than the Unisys I used in 1962, and the IBM S/360s I used at
the U of Illinois 1972-1976. Many of us remember the joys of hours sitting
at the 029 key punch machine creating a deck of hundreds of 80-column
Hollarith cards. Then dropping them on the way to the throne room window,
and having hours of fun putting them back in order. The felt-tip pen was the
greatest programming tool: make diagonal lines on the top of the deck and
getting the cards back in order was _much_ simpler and faster.

   Then there was paper tape on the DEC VAXen ...

   Many SysAdmins like vi for config files and other small editing jobs.
Those who know it well use it for longer programs, too. Like most things in
the *nix world, there are different philosophies of how to accomplish a
given task. Ergo, dozens of scripting languages, compiled programming
languages, text editors, etc. Of course, there are also a lot of egos
involved, but that can be found everywhere. :-)

Compared to what's available today, sure. But at the time, Primos and
Apollo's OS were cutting edge. And as Rich pointed out, those tools were
superior to the ones they replaced. I much preferred primitive word
processing using Editor and Runoff (on Primos) to using my old Olympia
manual typewriter.

   Well, Dick, you can still use ed and troff today! Or, like someone I know,
you can write in raw TeX and avoid the complexities of LaTeX (darned
new-fangled contraptions!).

I am surprised that no one seems to have mentioned TECO, Emacs' predecessor
on the PDP8, PDP11 and PDP16.  Emacs started as a series of TECO macros.

Shortly before leaving Prime Computer I started to learn emacs. I was really
starting to get into it, too. But then I went to Apollo and was bitten by
the GUI bug. While I can use vi on occasion, I often have to get out the
cheat sheet to be reminded what key to hit. As for emacs, I did try to get
into it a bit in the last 5 years, but find GUI editors like Kate for plain
text editing, and Word Perfect for fancy documents to be more to my liking.

Bah, all these fancy text editing programs.
In the really old days, you manipulated the bits by hand, with magnets.
Made from pieces of iron you mined yourself.
And we liked it that way!

I run vim when I want to get things done. I use Emacs when I want explore a
new operating system *snicker* just kidding. Emacs is incredibly powerful
and I'm incredibly lazy so I never took the time to learn it. I hold anyone
who uses it in very high regard *seriously*

I was an Emacs disciple for a decade or so until I finally stumbled upon
a succinct vim tutorial diagram in the shape of a keyboard.

http://www.viemu.com/vi-vim-cheat-sheet.gif

It's amazing how one diagram can cut through pages of obscure docs.

So I am now a vim heretic. :(

I recall using a line editor on a time-sharing mainframe system at OSU
in the early 1980s, it was a Honeywell I think.  It was called XEDIT
or something.  I've googled quite a bit and not found references to
it.  Along with punch cards, it was used in an Intro to Engineering
class.  I recall talking to a chainsmoking red-headed programming
instructor (Cawfield was his name, or some similar spelling) a few
years later who reported the university saved $500k/year or something
just by unplugging that machine.

*cough*

Surely, you must be joking. No scriptable syntax highlighting, no  
command history, no filename completions, no mouse support, no visual  
mode, only one buffer to work in, no X version, no diffing, no ftp/ 
ssh sessions, everything based around editing lines, etc. etc. etc.?

Okay, maybe *vim*, I could *maybe* see people learning that, but  
actual vi?

;)

For those not following the joke, vim, which most current linux  
distros alias the 'vi' command to, isn't actually vi. It's a much  
changed version, because vi was *horrid*.

'vi' was originally a hack to 'ex', which was a hack to 'ed', and  
understanding this lineage (a single line editor, then showing  
multiple lines on a screen at the same time, then adding line  
navigation commands and multiple line "batch" editing features) is  
helpful when explaining to confused folks why incredibly simple  
ideas, like backspace, absolutely fail to work in vi, when the same  
feature works in the same way on pretty much every modern editor in  
the world. (example follows later)

Heck, the whole reason I switched to emacs when I did, was that in  
comparison, using vi (back in the early 90's) took me three to four  
times as many keystrokes to accomplish the exact same tasks as in  
emacs. Sure, I could *sound* really busy, what with all that clacking  
noise (keyboards *really* clacked loud back then, it was a post- 
typewriter thing), but vi was just a dead-end, and it wasn't until  
nvi and vim came along that the vi family was worth even getting  
*near* again...

So, here's my ultimate pet-peeve about vi, if I have a file with the  
following text:
lazy
dog
...with my cursor under the 'd' character, and I was in edit mode,  
and wanted it to read as
lazy dog
..in any decent editor/terminal (as I would define it, of course)  
combo I would hit
<delete><space>.
Two keystrokes.

The ancient and venerable vi would have none of that, it's a  
glorified single line editor, for a world without arrow keys! (Or,  
rather, arrow keys on HJKL, so your fingers are close to them, and  
the escape key directly to the left of the Q, so switching modes is  
easy...... Because designing a universal unix text editor around the  
horribly obsoleted ADM3A terminal keyboard is a *GREAT* idea.)

At least, however, vi had options (much like perl, vi provides near- 
infinite ways of shooting yourself in the foot). Here's some examples  
of them:
<ESC><k><$><shift-J>  (uhm, yeah... that's easy to remember)
<ESC><RETURN><-><$><shift-J>  (natch)
<ESC><shift-{><$><shift-J>  (are your eyeballs bleeding yet?)

Sadly, because I know my vi skills date back to the System5R4 days, I  
assume much has changed, so I wouldn't be surprised if a vi  
descendant (such as vim) now has a macro of some kind to perform  
"jump-to-prior-line-and-remove-any-end-of-line-characters-and append- 
line-from-below-to-current-line-and-delete-the-lower-line", or even  
if vi *always* had some arcane combo that did the same thing, but  
that's not my point.

My point is that vi cannot <delete><space>, because it is, at its  
heart, a *line* editor, and not a *file* editor.

or if you're on the 'y' of lazy, you could press <shift>+<j> to join. yeah,
it sounds like people are talking about vi, not vim. i've never used plain
old vi, which sounds like was pretty good at just pissing people off. in my
world, when i say 'vi' i mean 'vim', and my computer understands it that way
too (or at least it's aliased to). i think vim has most of the features you

Or, if you're lazy, you don't have to be at the end of the line for J to 
join it in vim.

And yes, vim's backspace-from-insert-mode will eat the previous newline.

Because in a line editor,  there is *no* newline to delete. The  
newline is above you, not on the line to be edited.

Yes, this makes jaws drop and heads explode.

> or if you're on the 'y' of lazy,

So, you have to navigate *to* the line to change, in order to delete  
that <newline> character at the end of the line......

This is why we argue about it. ;)

It's not an actual debate at this point, so much as cheerful goading,  
in hopes that the opposing team will learn from the "home team's"  
successes and failures, regardless of which team a person is arguing  
for.

   Yeah. And when I was a kid we had to make our own water by smashing
together two hydrogen atoms with an oxygen atom. My sister and I took turns
doing this after school.

   Have you noticed that nostalgia just isn't what it used to be?

   I've read the description that emacs is the operating system and linux the

What kind of computer / motherboard are you connecting it to? If the SATA
controller has a setting to switch it between "native"and "ATA" mode in the
BIOS, it might need to be flipped to get ATAPI devices like the DVD-RW to
show up. It's also possible that your distro is being "smart" and you can
access the drive through /dev/cdrom . Also a "dmesg | grep -i samsung" might
give you some useful information.

See what "lsscsi" or "cdrecord -scanbus" have to say.

Look in /sys/block for block device names, e.g.:

  $ ls -l /sys/block | less

That should narrow it down quite a bit.

The `cdrecord -scanbus` command might like a '-dev=ATAPI' option (are 
sata drives treated as scsi or ata?)

Also note:  on newer distros (particular Debian-based) cdrecord might be 
known as 'wodim'.

Quentin,

   Asus MPV?-VM, the one recommended by many folks here.

   I'll look in the manual and see if there's anything about a BIOS setting.

   The cdrom drive (in reality a cd-rw) readily mounts on /mnt/cdrom. It's
know as both /dev/cdrom and /dev/cdrom0.

My SATA DVD-RW is at /dev/sr0.

Dan,

   I don't have /dev/sr0. The only /dev/s* are /dev/sg0, /dev/st0a,
/dev/st0m, /dev/st0, /dev/st0l, and the sound/snd devices.

> Does 'lshal' tell you anything interesting?

   Yes. Apparently HAL isn't home on this Slackware-11.0 box:

[root at salmo ~]# lshal
error: dbus_bus_get: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.FileNotFound: Failed to
connect to socket /var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket: No such file or director

or, I don't have dbus properly set up.

   Perhaps I should upgrade to Slackware-12.0 before looking for /dev/sr0.

Thanks,

Rich

   Well, now I know the answer. In /opt/src/linux-2.6.19.2/.config I see:

# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_SATA is not set

   So, I'll see if the default kernel in Slackware-12.0 has support. If not,
I'll build a custom kernel after the upgrade.

It would be nice to know which option in "make menuconfig" that
corresponds to.

   I know, Drew. That's installed on my notebook. When I have several hours
available I'll upgrade the server/workstation, too. There's a lot of hand
tuning required in this upgrade ... particularly with Xfce-4.4.1.

I have always used a Logitech external wireless USB mouse with my
laptops. My old Compaq had three USB ports and the receiver could be
hotplugged back and forth into any of them at any time and the mouse
continued to work. My new Thinkpad T61 also has three USB ports, two on
the back right corner and one in the middle of the left side. The mouse
works fine if I boot with the receiver in either of the back right
corner ports, but if I ever pull it out that kills both those ports
forever until I reboot. However, the port on the middle of the left
side always works and can always be hotplugged with any device. 

The Thinkpad has Gutsy amd64: Linux Devil7 2.6.22-14-generic #1 SMP Sun
Oct 14 21:45:15 GMT 2007 x86_64 GNU/Linux. It also has the latest BIOS
from Lenovo. The old computer had Feisty (which won't boot) plus a new
installation of Gutsy amd64. Its ports continue to work as before, so
it's not Gutsy.

Today my new Mini-Dock arrove and I am happy to report that it adds
four more USB ports (all in the back, yay!). All four of the USB ports
on the mini-dock work just fine as far as plug and play is concerned.
However, the two in the lower right corner still die if I disconnect
anything connected to them. This means that when I am away from home I
am stuck with just the one USB port on the left side.

1) Have any Thinkpad users run into this?

2) I tried Google, but cannot find a way to reset the USB ports without
restarting the computer. Is there a command that I could use?

Any other suggestions or observations about the two ports in the back
right corner?

Have you tried reloading the various USB kernel modules?

I thought of that after I posted the above question. However, I don't
know which modules they are. When I run lsmod I find the following
modules that contain "usb":

hci_usb	21020  3 
usbhid	32576  0 
usbcore	161584  6 cdc_acm,hci_usb,usbhid,ehci_hcd,uhci_hcd

I suppose the command would be rmmod <>, then modprobe <>. But which
one?

Use "modprobe -r" to unload, and "modprobe" to load.  You'll need to
unload the modules in the reverse order that they were loaded,
otherwise you'll get dependency complaints from modprobe.

The two primary USB modules are "usbcore" and  the "Xhci_hcd" modules.
Start by unloading higher-level modules like "hci_usb" and "usbhid",
then trying the several HCD modules, and finally "usbcore". modprobe
will tell you which modules are holding things up if it can't proceed.

Bear in mind that while this might be an educational experiment, it's
probably not going to be too practical for everyday use. Also, if your
Thinkpad's internal keyboard is a USB device, you'll need to enjoy all
of this through an external (PS/2) keyboard (if the dock provides
one), or via an SSH session.

Umm, well, considering what you say, I've decided to forget about it.
At home I have four perfectly functioning ports in the mini-dock, so I
only have the problem when away. Even then, the ports in the back right
corner work as long as I never remove anything from them. And add the
fact that I have since discovered that this problem is a bug in the
current Gutsy kernel, which has been reported and solidly confirmed in
Ubuntu launchpad and the kernel bug tracker. (Lots of T61 users bitten
by it.) I'll probably have to wait for the next release of Ubuntu for a
fix, but from what you say it's probably more trouble than its worth.

Thanks for the info. This educational experience will have to wait. :)

If you get called for jury duty take a wireless equipped notebook.

After checking in grab a cube space by the doors - you'll have electricity there. 
At the front of the room below and to the right of the TV are slips of paper
describing the WiFi they have available for jurors.

Currently:

SSID Lownsdale Square, 40 bit hex WEP, the key gets changed so grab a paper.

    Did that last year. Also, when you return from lunch and the courtroom is
not yet open again, you can sit on one of the benches and connect to the
'Net wirelessly from there.

The utility which computes and checks MD5's is called md5sum and in
Debian it is in the package coreutils. You can find this out using
dpkg --search  /usr/bin/md5sum

If I recall correctly, md5 is what BSD uses, and md5sum is what GNU uses.

Message-ID: <20071109214253.0401bd10.johnxj@comcast.net>

[rant_mode:on]
What's a desktop user to do? There are many backup utilities for Linux, but almost all of them are designed to back up hundreds of Windows boxes to a central server. I have one laptop that I need to back up. What's a desktop single-computer user to do?

For example, my new laptop has a dual layer DVD. It is working fine. But I can't find any backup utility that recognizes it. I have tried backup2l, backup-manager, cdbackup, cedarbackup2, hubackup, keep, multicd, pybackpack, sbackup and simplebackup. I'm on 64-bit Gutsy, but I could figure out how to compile from source if necessary. I have spent hours looking for a backup utility that will back up 16 GB of ~/ to DVDs, but there is nothing. None of them will even use the DVD as a single-layer DVD. They all crash or hang at some point or another. This is just pathetic.

Back in the days of Feisty I used Kdar, but that is not available in the Gutsy repositories. And back then I used a computer that had a single layer DVD. I can install dar, but its man page is useless. Without a GUI for it I am lost.

My backup requirements are not the same as most Linux users. I create new data that I don't want to lose maybe once a week, sometimes less often. I might be working on a homework project in OOo and need to back it up. Otherwise, the only things I have to back up are a few e-mails, none of which are critical. So a daily or continuous rsync to a network drive is ridiculous overkill. What I'd like to do is create a total mirror of my hard drive once a month or so, and also once a month or so a total backup of my home folder. In between I'd like to be able to do click, click, click and make an incremental backup of ~/ to a DVD drive every once in a while after I have created new data that I don't want to lose. Does anyone have any suggestions? Are there other Linux desktop users out there that have the same needs?

I installed a second hard drive on my desktop, then my son (the expert) spent 15 
minutes setting up Dirvish to do incremental backups to that drive once per 
week.  (I could perform an incremental backup any time if I desired, but have 
not felt the need.)

Perhaps one or two USB hard drives be reliable enough for your needs.

Keith will likely chime in here.

___________________

I have similar needs.

Approximately once a month, or whenever I think about it, I insert my
backup hard drive in the cartridge and run a backup script that uses
rsync to backup the mutable directories to it.

That's on my old computer.  I just bought a replacement, and am
seriously considering _not_ moving the backup cartridge to it.  I was
thinking of buying an external usb drive to use for a backup instead.
But now I'm wondering if a flash drive might be good enough for my
needs.

   Regardless of the medium, you can easily set cron jobs to do incremental
backups and full backups. I write the incrementals to tape Tuesday through
Friday mornings at 1:00 am, and a full backup Saturday mornings at 0:15 am.
It's worked flawlessly for years. Come in handy a few times, too.

I think that maybe you missed a bit of text:

If you can come up with a cron job to physically attach the drive,
then I will be pretty damn impressed.

John doesn't know it yet, but he /really/ needs dirvish.  He will
need help setting it up, though.   I could set it up remotely on
his home desktop, if he had a VPN running that I could access it
through the net.  But I am NOT good at setting up VPNs.  In a 
pinch I can do some configuration through text windows and SSH,
but to really tweak on things, access config GUIs, and so forth
requires a VPN.

In fact, if we held a workshop, then a lot of people could help and
we could all learn together.  If we had VPN access to people's home
machines, then we could set up and tweak home machines from laptops
at Jax, and hold our workshops on those Advanced Topic nights when
Alan can't find a speaker.  Win win all around.

But we don't have the VPNs set up.  That is the sticking point.
Perhaps somebody who knows a lot about setting up VPNs ( I like
OpenVPN, but there are many others ) could lead us through VPN
setup next Monday at Jax, and people like John could bring their
laptops and we could set up an informal one on the Jax local 
network between those laptops.  Then attendees could reconfigure
their laptops and repoint the VPNs at their home servers and 
firewalls, and we would be able to use the VPNs for other topics
and workshops.


Does anyone know enough about OpenVPN to lead the workshop? 

I and probably many others know just enough to act as a bridge
between an expert and a newbie, so the "speaker" won't have to do
much speaking or slide prep.  We will have the projector available
for sharing problems and fixing individual problems as a group. 
This would NOT be the usual A.T. meeting rules;  this would be
entirely "stupid questions".

When we have VPNs for everyone, then we can hold workshops on many
other topics using that as a base.  Much long term relief for Alan,
I hope!

Keith

I suggested a VPN setup workshop night for A.T.  Here's another 
Jax-compatable workshop topic.

One of the perennial problems we face at Advanced Topics meetings is
configuring people's laptops for my 1024x768 projector.  With the
right drivers and X configuration, most laptops will drive it.  But
debugging X is a pain for me - I "just don't get it" when it comes
to all the zillions of options for the radeon driver in my T30
laptop, for example, and I don't understand SUSE and Ubuntu and ???
video setup GUIs.  There are many PLUGgers that know a lot more
about X than I do, and there are many other PLUGgers that would
like to make their laptops more projector friendly.

May I suggest a "laptop and projector" night?  Somebody can bring a
4 or 8-way KVM switch, so we can switch between a few different
laptops without constantly plugging and unplugging cables.  If we
get all the laptops properly configured in the time available, we
can use the remainder of the evening to project rude internet
videos (for scientific testing of video codecs, of course).  

If other people  bring projectors and screens also, we could make
sure our machines work with more than one projector.  Robustness!

This is not an "advanced topic", and there would certainly be a lot
of stupid questions, but many of us would learn something, especially
if there are a few people around that actually understand X.  Perhaps
some X programmers (K.P.?) might be amused to see what the unwashed
masses actually attempt to do with their beautiful windowing system.

Have you looked at Mondo?  Once you figure out the commandline options,
it'll back everything up to a bootable set of DVDs that can restore your
machine from bare-metal.  It'll also do incremental backups.  I don't
know if it makes good use of dual-layer media, but I've found it very
useful in general.

Admittedly, I haven't tried a full restore, just (I think) file-by-file,
but it's pretty nifty.

Which reminds me, I gotta back up my home server...

I might be working on a homework project in OOo and need to back it up. Otherwise, the only things I have to back up are a few e-mails, none of which are critical. So a daily or continuous rsync to a network drive is ridiculous overkill.

> [rant_mode:off]


Similar, I guess, but probably different enough that what I do might not
work for you.  I backup once a week to an external USB drive using
rdiff-backup.  My two internal hard drives are 160GB each; my external
USB drive is 320GB.  The math works nicely.  However, I don't really
back up the entire contents of my internal drives, just /home, some
other directories I keep user data on, and /usr/local.  Everything else
I could recreate easily if I need to.  I just back up the stuff I don't
want to have to recreate or re-obtain (in the case of downloads).

I keep it simple.  I don't use cron or any automatic scheduler.  I do it
usually on Sundays, sometimes on Saturdays depending upon the weekend.
The rest of the week my USB hard drive sits unplugged and turned off,
collecting dust.  Backups are the only thing I use it for.  I thought it
was a small price to pay for a little peace of mind.

I like rdiff-backup because its basic usage is very simple, even though
it's a command-line app.  Just:

$ rdiff-backup /home/mcubed /media/disk/backup_home/

(where the first item is what you want to back up, aka the "source"; the
second is where you want the backup to be written, aka the "target.")

It only writes data that has changed since the previous week's backup,
and it keeps the backups incrementally.  The only other maintenance
thing I have to do is remove old backup archives I know I won't need
anymore.  If I haven't gone back to something that I deleted more than
two months ago or to a version of something that had changed more than
two months ago, it's very likely I'll never need to, so I use 2 months
as my cut-off.  Obviously, everybody has different needs on this score.
You can keep whatever you want to keep as far back as you have the
storage space for.

The man page for rdiff-backup is rather long and complicated looking,
but that's because it can do much fancier things than I need it to do.
Like I said, basic usage is dead easy.

That doesn't address your DVD issue at all, but I don't write such
things so that's a problem I haven't had to face myself.

Good luck!

I think you missed the point.  He never indicated he could do what you 
concluded.  He merely mentioned using cron, which only automates running 
the script, which you said you did "manually".  I do the same thing.  I 
have tapes I put in each day labeled for the day of the week (meh, I had 
the drive and extra tapes).  The backup happens at night when I sleep.

I have a couple USB drives that I could use for backups. The problem is
that there is an obscure bug in the Linux USB protocol that causes
nasty things to happen when transferring very large amounts of data. I
can move individual files of any size, but when I use rsync, cp, tar,
or anything else that is going to move 16 GB of data over the USB port
it locks up the computer about two out of three times. Sometimes it
will lock up within a few minutes after starting the copy, sometimes it
gets almost all the way to the end. Occasionally it even completes the
copy. As I understand it the problem is in the way the USB protocol
works on Linux. Keith told me about it once, but I don't remember
exactly what caused the problem. I also don't know if it might have
been fixed.

Today I experimented with NSsbackup, a fork of Simple Backup that was
created in 2005 and added in the release of Dapper. It has the same
problems that Simple Backup has - it can't find any target folders for
where to put the backup  and there is a Save button to save the
configuration changes you made, but it doesn't work. You have to edit
the config file manually, but that does no good because it ignores half
the settings in its own config file. Plus you can have only one config
file, so you can't create a configuration for your monthly, another for
your weekly, another for an incremental, and so on. You have to edit the
configurations every time. And it can't even do an incremental. And you
can't tell it to limit the size of the archives to < 4 GB so they could
be manually burned to a DVD. (Groisofs can't handle a file greater than
4 GB.) Pretty hopeless.

I think I'd be just as well off to fire up K3B, drag files into its
Burn window until the window is full, and tell it to burn them.

I know zero about VPNs, but a quick search in Synaptic turned up 28
packages, including OpenVPN. 

This sounds like a good idea. I ought to learn about VPNs anyway. 

On the other hand, if I need to connect my laptop from there to my
desktop at home, that may be a challenge. I can't even connect to it
sitting right next to it.

Obligatory on topic content.  Apparently this originated in the the 
alt.hack newsgroup, where off topic posters would get flamed(see 
obhack).  I suppose ObPlug would have been more correct.

Message-ID: <47388FF4.5060302@comcast.net>

Some weeks ago I ran an upgrade of SuSE 10.1. Several things broke, and
at least one (different) thing was fixed. Bit by bit (no pun intended),
I have worked through fixing things. I suspect that there is a "right"
way to administer my system so that when it comes time to run an upgrade
I'll know in advance what things will break and know what I'll have to
do to fix them. By that I mean things I've installed the old fashioned
way, as opposed to things installed with YaST.

Is there some reading I could do to get a better understanding of how
sys admins keep track of these sorts of things? I'd like to be more
organized about the paper log book I keep, or at least sometimes keep
(which I recognize is part of the problem).

Dick,

   I've no idea how SuSE does things, but each Slackware upgrade includes an
CHANGES file; the latest is CHANGES-AND-HINTS because there's so much to
cover.

   Trying to track everything manually can be a PITA and quickly becomes out
of date. Is there a tool that lets you configure and build from a source
tarball, then make a SuSE package from it? That would be the best way of
keeping the system organized. I've done this with Red Hat and Slackware, so
all installed software (well, 97.31% anyway) are listed in /var/log/packages
and I know both what's installed and which version is the most recent.

   Another suggestion, if you can, is to upgrade a less-critical system
first, find out what's broken there and fix it before upgrading your most
critical system. I do my notebook upgrades first, and that teaches me what I
need to do on the desktop server/workstation.

HTH,

Rich

Always test on a dev machine before doing stuff on production!  Keep a local 
package repo mirror (like the way gentoo recommends that you use one machine 
in your network as a local portage tree) so that all boxes get the identical 
packages.  I update my server only when I feel that the gentoo portage tree 
is especially stable, and I have installed and tested the updates on at 
least 2 other boxes with the same architecture (my amd64 box doesn't count 
because my server is x86).  My dream setup is an openmosix cluster of 3 
identical machines.  At update time, I would take one node out of the 
cluster and update it, and test it well before updating the rest of the 
nodes.

Especially if you're installing into /usr/local and then upgrade the 
base system (your bin, lib, man gets masked, "fun" ensues.)

I use stow and recently reduced almost everything in /usr/local strictly 
to symlinks.  I also have this cron job to checkup on it.

  30 04 * * * find /usr/local/{lib,bin,sbin,include,man,share} -type f

How about checkinstall?  I've had some trouble with that though where 
the hacks to the shared I/O libraries (which checkinstall uses for its 
hooks) don't jive with what the install process is doing -- with the 
nvidia installer in particular.

Perhaps something which builds in a chroot on unionfs would be more 
robust?  Just grab the files from the write layer of the union, right?


I also like to keep track of what the package manager is doing with 
config files, thus I have /etc under svk ala:

 http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/archives/2005/02/23/put_etc_under_s.html

That's actually a bit tricky to setup though (and I don't recommend 
following Ask's instructions exactly.)  I've had better luck with 
creating an empty etc dir in the repository, checkout to /tmp, then 
hack ~/.svk/config, cd etc, `svk propset svn:ignore .` (then ":r! svk 
st" and pare that down.)

Maybe something with git or some other system would be easier to get 
started and manage.  I do like the ability to run 'svk st' and see what 
has been created or changed, and I run this as a cron job every 30 min:

  http://scratchcomputing.com/svn/VCfs/trunk/vc-checkup

And I occasionally dream about getting my dotfiles (~/.foo) under 
control.  Any suggestions there?

Perhaps CFEngine offers some of that functionality?  I haven't heard 
much about how useful it is for a single system.

   This has never before happened to me, and I'm thoroughly lost what to do.

   I tried building and installing a new version of a key library I use, but
it failed because gcc failed the tests in the configuration process.
Downloaded a new copy of gcc-3.4.6 (the Slackware-11.0 version) and
installed that. Still won't work. Tried building a newer version of another
library and that failed, too: error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status
1. /usr/bin/gcc is present.

   When trying to build the latest SQLite3 I see the attached config.log.
When trying to build/install the latest pysqlite2, there are a bunch of
errors that culminate in the gcc error shown above.

   This puts me in a bind and I need to get both the desktop and notebook
working today. Help, please.

The problems seem to start with:

In file included from /usr/include/bits/posix1_lim.h:153,
                 from /usr/include/limits.h:144,

What should be providing limits.h? First hit on Google for "linux limits.h"
is
http://lists.arm.linux.org.uk/pipermail/linux-arm-toolchain/2006-January/000353.html

Is that relevant?

Are you using a distro kernel?  Do you have a package analagous to
linux-headers in gentoo, which provides kernel headers for inclusion
in C code?

Quentin,

   I don't think so, There are copies of this header in several directories:

/opt/src/linux-2.6.19.2/include/linux/limits.h
/opt/src/linux-2.6.19.2/include/asm-arm26/limits.h
/opt/src/linux-2.6.19.2/include/asm-i386/mach-generic/irq_vectors_limits.h
/opt/src/linux-2.6.19.2/include/asm-i386/mach-default/irq_vectors_limits.h
/opt/src/linux-2.6.19.2/include/asm-i386/mach-summit/irq_vectors_limits.h
/opt/src/linux-2.6.19.2/include/asm-arm/limits.h
/usr/lib/gcc/i486-slackware-linux/3.4.6/install-tools/gsyslimits.h
/usr/lib/gcc/i486-slackware-linux/3.4.6/install-tools/include/limits.h
/usr/lib/gcc/i486-slackware-linux/3.4.6/include/syslimits.h
/usr/lib/gcc/i486-slackware-linux/3.4.6/include/limits.h
/usr/share/texmf/include/kpathsea/c-limits.h
/usr/share/gtk-doc/html/libgtop/libgtop-msg-limits.html
/usr/share/gtk-doc/html/libgtop/libgtop-sem-limits.html
/usr/share/gtk-doc/html/libgimpbase/libgimpbase-gimplimits.html
/usr/include/wine/msvcrt/limits.h
/usr/include/libgtop-2.0/glibtop/shm_limits.h
/usr/include/libgtop-2.0/glibtop/msg_limits.h
/usr/include/libgtop-2.0/glibtop/sem_limits.h
/usr/include/limits.h

   That's why the sudden failure makes no sense to me.

Thanks,

Rich

Carlos,

   On this box, no. I built the 2.6.19.2 kernel from source. I don't think it
was that long ago that I built some packages from source tarballs without
any compiler issue at all.

   The source tree has the headers in /usr/src/linux-2.6.19.2/include/.

Trying a new line of attack.  Gentoo has a script called 
"fix_libtool_files.sh" that needs to be run after changing gcc versions. 
Didn't you mention that you tried switching compilers?  Could the linker be 
affected?

Sorry with the gentoo-centric-ness.  I am what I am.

   No, I re-installed the distribution-specific compilers (gcc and gcc-g++);
same versions as before.

   The CPU is not an ARM; it's an AMD XP Athlon+ dual core and replaced a
system with an AMD Athlon+ single core. As I wrote initially, I've not seen
this happen in the decade I've run linux and it has really set me back on my
heels.

> Sorry with the gentoo-centric-ness. I am what I am.

   No problem. We all prefer different distributions.

   Searching with Google for 'cpp fails sanity check' shows quite a few folks
with this issue over the past couple of years, and with a variety of
distributions. A couple of users (one with Madriva the other with Slackware
-- I think -- solved the problem by making soft links in /usr/bin/ to the
file cc1 and/or cc1plus. That did not work for me.

   The kernel source is in /usr/src/linux-2.6.19.2 and /usr/src/linux is a
symlink to that directory.

   Does this help you more expert folks identify a potential solution?

   I think the solution is to copy all kernel headers into /usr/include. Do
you folks have a directory in there for linux/ or the kernel number? I've
nothing like that here and I'd like to fix this up, regardless of how it
broke.

On my Ubuntu box that I'm sitting at now, I have no sub-directories.
Interestingly, I do have a limits.h sitting in there. If you already have
one in there too, I'd guess based on the information in that log file you
posted that you should drop the files in a linux/ dir.

   On my notebook running Slackware-12.0, there's /usr/include/linux/. So, on
the desktop running Slackware-11.0, I made that directory and copied the
headers in there. Now I've added the subdirectory asm/ from the asm-i386/
directory. Eventually it should work again.

   The limits.h in /usr/include/ was from 2006 some time, and every line was
commented out. I copied over the one from the source tree and that error
went away.

Thanks,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] NFS for Dummies
Message-ID: <20071112203529.d0c29e3d.johnxj@comcast.net>

I'm trying to get my desktop and laptop to see each other. The laptop
is brand new and has a fresh install of Gutsy amd64. The desktop is
several months old and has a (then) fresh install of Feisty, amd64.
Both have gigabit ethernet, and both are connected through my home
ethernet wiring, which is also all gigabit capable (theoretically).
Ifconfig says the following:

Desktop:	inet addr:192.168.0.101  Bcast:192.168.0.255 Mask:255.255.255.0 
Laptop:	inet addr:192.168.0.102 Bcast:192.168.0.255 Mask:255.255.255.0

Both work fine as far as surfing the net and stuff. Each can ping the
other. But the Feisty and Gutsy GUIs cannot get either one able to
browse or mount the folders on the other. Of course, there is no
documentation for the GUIs. I did previously get it working with my old
computer, that is, the desktop could see the old laptop, although I
never could get the old laptop to be able to mount the desktop share.

I'm sure this would take about three minutes for someone who understood
how networks and permissions work. I've spent about four hours googling
and trying various instructions, but nothing has worked so far.

I recall that getting the desktop to see the old laptop required
adjusting permissions. However I cannot find the GUI where the
permissions were set. If I recall correctly, it was in System >
Administration > SELinux, but that is not there in Gutsy - Ubuntu
switched to AppArmor for Gutsy, and I can't find any documentation to
tell me how to use it. Meantime, I could swear that Feisty was using
SELinux, but that is no longer there either and, according to Synaptic,
it is not installed.

I could use some diagnostic commands that would at least tell me what
is wrong, missing or misconfigured.

It would also help if I knew how to specify an NFS network share from
the command line - that is, the syntax. The share on the desktop
is /media/md3 and the name of the desktop is Devil6. The mount point
for it on the laptop is /media/Devil6_md3. Would it be correct to write
the command:

sudo mount nfs:/Devil6/media/md3 /media/Devil6_md3

Because I tried that and it puked it up. I need to know how to specify
"look for an NFS share." I never know where to use a colon, where to
use slashes, or how many. And a diagnostic command to figure out what
the laptop thinks the desktop share is called would also be helpful.

John,

While I can't say I've got the best solution, I do have NFS working on 
my home system. I am NOT an expert at NFS, I just got it to work for me.

My computer (pc014.kb0odu.us) is a NFS server (running SuSE). In 
/etc/exports I have the following lines:

/etc *(ro,sync)
/mp3 *(rw,sync)
/home/vmware *(rw,sync)
/iso *(rw,sync)

While I have a script to mount / unmount the volumes, this is really 
what it sums up to on pc016.kb0odu.us (my Kubuntu Gutsy AMD64 laptop):

sudo mount -t nfs -O rsize,wsize=8192,timeo=14,intr pc014:/iso 
/iso/pc014 > /dev/null

Hopefully that works for you.

I should put some security around it using PAM, but I just haven't got 
to that yet. But, first I need to upgrade my server from SuSE to Ubuntu.

Tim

It did! I had to adapt it, but after a few error messages I actually
got the new laptop to mount the share on the Desktop! Yay! And thanks!

I'm worried about security only from the internet. I live alone, and if
someone breaks in and steals my computers, there's not much that
security passwords and stuff could do to help anyway. 

Next on my agenda is getting dirvish or whatever set up.

The CD-ROM is first. I just found out from a google search that this is
bug in fedora and it will not be fixed. Patent issues?

Sounds good.  I would be especially interested in the hardware 
requirements and difficulties with various options.  (Like what it takes 
to make conference calling work without weird delays.)

Send me a description for the talk off-line and I will send out an 
announcement.

Message-ID: <20071113163951.5D4PL.245433.root@fepweb15>

Please let me announce a neat opensource happening in our area.
http://wiki.eclipse.org/Portland_DemoCamp

It happens on Monday 12/10 7PM at McMenamins Kennedy School
http://www.mcmenamins.com/index.php?loc=57

It's free. 

During November and December, Eclipse DemoCamps are happening around the world. Eclipse DemoCamp is an opportunity to showcase all of the cool interesting technology being built by the Eclipse community. It is also an opportunity for you to meet Eclipse enthusiasts in your city. 

The format of the DemoCamp is pretty informal. The idea is for a group of Eclipse enthusiasts to meet up and demo what they are doing with Eclipse. The demos can be of research projects, Eclipse open source projects, applications based on Eclipse, commercial products using Eclipse, whatever you think might be of interest to the attendees. The only stipulation is that it is Eclipse related. 

So please look at the wiki, and if you'd like to attend, sign up. Even better, if you want to give a demo, sign up for that too.

One workaround I have seen is booting from an USB key and installing
from the DVD (or network).

The Fedora bug is https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=239585.
It sounds like it is a bug in the interaction between ISOLINUX and the
BIOS.  Here is the workaround mentioned:

It turns out that this isn't a kernel issue at all.  Rather, it is an
interaction between ISOLINUX (specifically, the ISOLINUX menu system) and the
BIOS.  If one holds down the Shift key to bring up the ISOLINUX prompt and
launches the kernel from there, this bug isn't triggered.

Thanks for the tip Ian I was finally able to get Fedora 8 DVD to boot

Subject: [PLUG] Unlinked web pages with obscure names - mildly secure?
Message-ID: <20071114155824.GA7142@gate.kl-ic.com>


Apache/Web question:

I have a few https web pages on my site with URLs like cj33wq.html .
These drive CGI scripts that do stuff for clients, send me messages,
etc.  They are not linked to (unless my clients do so - bad client!). 
Nothing falls apart if the bad guys find them and start frobbing on
them;  it is just mildly inconvenient.  While most are password
protected, some are not (like the page where they prove who they are
then tell me what they want for a password).

If I understand Apache and web service, there is no way that the bad
guys can find these pages without an exhaustive search (which would
be obvious from the logs) or by listening in on my client's traffic.

Am I mistaken?  Are there simple ways to ask Apache for an index of
all the public but unlinked pages on a website?

Keith

Apache itself has no way of knowing which pages are linked to.  With a
little shell-fu, you should be able to run some kind of grep command
to check the pages in your web content area.

If you haven't already, you should confirm that apache won't serve up
a directory listing if a browser is pointed to a directory rather than
a file in your web content area.  If apache lets you browse
directories, the Bad Guys could find your pages that way and mildly
inconvenience you.  Turning off directory listing also buys you a
little security through obscurity so it's generally a good thing.

The -Indexes option (with the hyphen in front) should prevent that
from happening.  You can add it like this:

<LocationMatch "^/+$">
Options -Indexes
</LocationMatch>

Hello,

I've setup OpenVPN at too places I've been employed, servers and
clients, so does that suffice? Has to hack a little part of the code
in the first instance, and used IPCop in the latest instance, a nice
GUI route (no pun intended). Had to tweak the routing tables in the
configs to let our developers hit our colo -- sssh -- it's a neat
trick to know.

Btw, if anyone knows about low-cost VPN hardware, I am looking for
some leads. Supposedly hardware VPN has much lower latency, a
consideration for things like VoIP.

Oh, also, are you sure you need VPN? Maybe using ssh to create a
tunnel would allow you to use VNC instead to get a GUI of his desktop.
I can help with all that, including getting the vncserver working.

I hope it is OK to ask a Mac question here.

I have a GPS that works fine w/ gpsd on Ubuntu.

poked around on google but am completely clueless, only found guides
to programmers for patching into USB devices. To test the gpsd
connection, I need to supply a device, ugh!

About the VPN discussion ...

I typically run ssh with port forwarding to get a GUI on machines in Corvallis and the OSU sysadmins assure me this is secure. The GUI is very responsive.

I can connect from a Linux or a Windows machine to Linux at OSU this way.

Directions how to do this (Linux to Linux) are on our wiki

Well, minus the passwords which you cannot have.

If a similar file exists, I've not heard of it.

I think I've heard of it. I'll have to try to remember where.

I don't have /var/log/packages, but I do have YaST2. I'll have to spend
some time studying what's in there, but a cursory examination didn't
show something like what you described.

I do have zmd-messages.log, plus one for every day between
zmd-messages.log.2006-10-20 and zmd-messages.log.2007-11-13. (I didn't
actually confirm this, but the list of files does look like in
increments daily.)

A little snooping with man about zmd pointed me to rug, which may be the
answer to the recommendation for installing from rpms. Here's the first
part of man rug:

rug is the command-line interface to the ZENworks Linux Management (ZLM)
agent. It works with the ZLM daemon to install, update, and remove
software according to the commands you give it. The software which it
installs can be from ZENworks 7 Linux Management, ZENworks 6.6.x Linux
Management servers, aptrpm repositories, as well as local files.

Alas, there currently is only one system running Linux in the house. I
shut down the second one some months ago because it appeared to be
generating something that caused my network attached fax/printer to go
through a warm-up cycle every few minutes. I haven't had spare time to
dig into it.

Recently (last week or so), something else has started telling the
printer to warm up, but it's only once every few hours or so.

Alas, there is only one machine in the house that is running Linux and
is close to modern speed and memory standards. The other available
machine is much slower, has less memory, and doesn't have an nVidia
display driver -- which is one of the problems.

It is my goal to do what you recommend. I'll need to build another
machine before I can do that. One of these days...

Thanks for the ideas.

Well, y'all recently moved from daylight savings time by setting your
watches back an hour. I decided to go on calendar savings time, so I
moved my calendar back a day. Everyone else got just an extra hour, but
I got a whole nextra day.

On my (really old) iMac running Ubuntu Feisty
(7.04), a flash drive shows up as /dev/sda1.  After connecting the device to
a USB
port, run the command 'dmesg' on the command line in a terminal.  If the
device
was recognized, the last several lines will report a lot of information
about it,
including what device was assigned.

Not to get too technical, in Ubuntu (Debian? in general?) the USB driver is
implemented 'on top of' the scsi (sd) driver, and so USB devices tend to
show up as
scsi devices (/dev/sda, for example).  USB Keyboard and Mouse are special
exceptions. Since the devices are assigned dynamically (under udev control?
somebody correct me if I'm wrong here), you cannot predict what the device
assignment will be ahead of time, unless you don't use more than one USB
device, or don't ever change the USB devices once attached.

I think we need to determine if the OP is running Linux on his Mac, or Mac
OS X on his Mac.
>From the question it sounds like Mac OS X.
If it is Linux it should show up on the /dev tree like any other Linux,
depending on the kernel it could be a few different things, such as
/dev/sd[x] or /dev/usb[x].
If Mac OS X, you have to remember to speak BSDish.  When I plug in a USB
flash drive on my work Powerbook, it shows up on /dev/disk1s1.
I don't know about a gps device though since I don't have one.

Oh.  Just to complicate things, the suggestion should not be a

Good point; I made a weak assumption.

The question is how to identify what device is assigned.  On my iBook it
looks like a flash drive is identified as having a file system and so shows
up as a disk.  I doubt that the gps
device would show up that way.  The GPSD site gpsd.berlios.de says that OS X
is OK, but the usb drivers must
be updated to the most current versions.

I don't see the command *dmesg *on my iBook (10.3.9), but the file
*/var/log/syslog
*has a one line report about the device *disk1s1 *showing up when I plug in
the flash drive.  Maybe
something similar will happen when the gps device is attached.

To see the bottom of */var/log/syslog *in OS X, after attaching
 the gps device to the USB port, open a terminal
(Go->Utilities->Terminal) and type *tail /var/log/syslog* .

No, a device that has any mechanical function can't possibly have the
lowest power draw. Good thought, though!

How about one of the cool kits on http://ladyada.net/ ?

I'll bet the AVR programmer uses very little power, except when it's
burning.

Do you have any external links on any of those pages?  Your client's
web browser will happily send the Referer: header to the web server of
any external links.  Additionally, you are relying on your client's
browser being implemented properly to NOT send Referer: if they type
an address in manually or click a bookmark.

Subject: [PLUG] New Distro Ultumix. I designed it myslef.
Message-ID: <844713.5981.qm@web509.biz.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Well in short I started out with PCLinuxOS-2007, added all the codecs and packages most people will ever need, added the legally free Windows interface, added my own boot up picture, added fasterfox for more speed, and several other things. 

I didn't update everything because I found that by doing that some older drivers were replaced and it would not work on older machines. So I left part of it alone. PCLinuxOS came with a program called FrostWire that is only good for downloading porn so I removed it and added Gnomesword and some other goodies. I forgot to add FileZilla before I made it. I also forgot to set OpenOffice.org to save in Microsoft format by default so that no one would cry because Microsoft Office can't open different formats. 

Eventually I found that the following command worked and made the first version.

mklivecd --tmp /home/owner/tmp --debug UltumixLight_v0.0.0.1.iso

It is a Live distrobution so you can try it before you install it. Unfortunitly since it has everything it is a 1.3GB .iso file so it must be put on a DVD. Yes thats right you have to have a DVD burner. But it works out of the box! YAY. 

Why did I do this? Well I don't like Ubuntu and neither do my customers for three reasons. I like PCLinuxOS but it requires that you update it and know how to select and install all of the codecs and it also does not have a completely Windows like interface. This means an extra hour of downloading updates and programs before I'm done with my customer's computer. Ultumix eliminates this problem. 

Enjoy.

Soon to follow: Christian Edition, video game Edition, Sports Lover's Edition, and hopefully 64 bit edition.

I would think a usb hub would fit the bill. Mine has an LED, but that's not

The use is strictly the presence or absense of the vendor id on the
usb bus.  so it doesn't have to do anything beyond that.  I have a
little usb-ethernet adapter, but it is larger than i'd like.  I have
been using a dlink dbt-120, which is small and works, but ... looking
for something smaller and if possible something that *can't* radiate
in 2.4 GHz rather than just *doesn't* (in the context of its current
use).

I would guess a usb "security" dongle.  I suspect that does not
meet your criteria, because to use one requires a special driver
which is usually closed source and taints the kernel, and they
usually come with software that costs big bux.  When the ICED
software I am helping with releases sources (Real Soon Now), there
will be a few thousand no-longer-needed dongles for that, scattered
around the world.

I came across a Seagate Scorpion STD2401LW tape drive supposedly compatible with Windows, Linux, and UNIX. However, there are dip switches to be set (5-8) to reflect the operating system, and none of the examples in the manual are for OS currently in use. If someone has used this drive or a similar one on Linux, I would appreciate advice about this.

Yeah, someone had suggested the security dongle to me before, which
sounds good from a power and size point of view.  I don't care about
no drivers, all I need it for is a unique vendor id.  But, it was hard
to find anything for sale online that looked anything but encumbered
in all sorts of software tangles.

Probably not what you're looking for, but I had success installing
OpenWRT on a Linksys router and using it to connect to my
(ex-)employer's network via VPNC.  I can't say much for the
performance either way, but at $40 for an old Linksys it was pretty
low cost.

Subject: [PLUG] /dev/sda4
Message-ID: <473D0CA4.4060406@verizon.net>

I recall W. Morita's troubles with superblocks recently and reread part 
of that thread from the archives.

My problem is with /dev/sda4 aka /home, his was with /.

The message I get when I try to boot into Ubuntu Gutsy on this laptop is:

Log of fsck -C -R -A -a

/dev/sda4: Attempt to read block from filesystem resulted in short read 
while reading block 1232

/dev/sda4:  Attempt to read block from filesystem resulted in short read 
while reading journal superblock

fsck.ext3:  Attempt to read block from filesystem resulted in short read 
while checking ext3 journal for /dev/sda4
fsck died with exit status 8.

A quick Google search shows that any exit status other than 0 is bad, 
but didn't tell me what 8 actually means.

So, without wasting too much of everyone's valuable time, this computer 
is an HP and is less than 1 year old.  It is still under warranty.  Is 
the hard drive dying for some reason, or, is a more likely 
scenario...Windows XP Media did something to my /home partition?
If it's option # 2, can it be repaired without losing the data.  I did 
learn to use rsync a while back, but my wife is moaning about a couple 
of things she did in the last week or so (I remember...weekly backups!).

Thanks!

Bruce

Yeah ... the link I found points to links for Ubuntu, Fedora and Gentoo. 
I'll most likely do Gentoo if I get one, since that's what all my other 
systems run. It definitely won't be Ubuntu, but might be Fedora. The big 
question is the RAM -- with that kind of processor horsepower, I really 
want some RAM in the thing or it's not worth doing -- a QC x86_64 would 
be a better deal.

What if it receives on 2.4GHz?  also, you didn't mention price:

What about something like a USB-SD Memory card reader. CompUSA (ok, not 
the best choice, but they're local and cheap) sells them for about $12.00.

Message-ID: <422ec1510711152356o53613bdei8659244753ccf7c8@mail.gmail.com>

Hey guys, I actually have an issue I need help with! (aside from leaving
smart-ass remarks.)

I have an HP tx1000 and I can't get the wired internet connection to work.
All other linux boxes in the house work, wired and wireless.

I first installed Feisty, and the way I got the wireless card to work was to
wget the dell driver, worked like a charm. Feisty was great, but the upgrade
was too tempting. I was able to follow a useful thread on how to configure
wireless in the ubuntu forums, only because my wired internet connection was
working, since I had to apt-get install a few things. Since I've upgraded to
Gutsy, the wired connection won't work. I've followed a lot of threads that
say it's because you have to disable ipv6, but I've tried that and it
doesn't work. The main goal is to get my wireless card to work, which there
are plenty of threads on, but they all pre-assume that your wired internet
connection works. I've also seen a lot of posts about this problem with
other machines, and there doesn't seem to be a straight forward answer for
it (yet). So maybe we can double post in the ubuntu forums?

Also, by default, my usb ports aren't recognizing anything, but internet is
more important.

Please let me know what output I need to provide from my machine to help
diagnose, or any insights you might have. Thanks!

A few things that would be useful  to know are

lspci  | grep -i eth
grep -i eth /var/log/messages
ifconfig
any relevant parts of /etc/network/interfaces

You mean something like

udev: renamed network interface eth0 to eth3


so that /etc/network/interfaces which is configured for eth0 now needs to be
configured for eth3?

If you only care about a vendor ID, then why care about software?

Besides, if it is not supported you could hand it to Greg K-H and get him 
to write drivers.

   Take a look at PSTricks. You can script your plotting needs, then run the
output through convert to get a .gif from a .ps.

*I* don't care about the software at all, but (afaict) they don't want
to sell the dongle without the software, software that I don't have
the slightest need or desire for, but which they want to charge lots
of money for.  That's what I meant by "tangles".  At least, that was
my impression.

Ya, this is on MacBook "Pro".

I see nothing in /var/log/system.log, strange, maybe the report level
is set to MUTE, joking.

These are all the devices I am seeing:

paul:~ paul$ ls -l /dev/disk*
brw-r-----   1 root  operator   14,   0 Nov  5 14:16 /dev/disk0
brw-r-----   1 root  operator   14,   1 Nov  5 14:16 /dev/disk0s1
brw-r-----   1 root  operator   14,   2 Nov  5 14:16 /dev/disk0s2

Must there be a custom driver for each USB device, or is there some
standard that might be allowing it to "just work"?

Interesting.  That's got tiny down cold.  The mouse I don't need.  And
the price is a bit of an obstacle.  Basically, I am trying to beat a
$30 D-link DBT-120 bluetooth dongle.  We've measured the RF from it,
and it basically is a non-emitter in the way we are using it, but if
it actually *could not* emit 2.4 GHz that would be an improvement.  So
far, the leader is that Brando USB-to-IrDA dongle.  Either $10
(including shipping) from Hong Kong, or ~$20 from a domestic supplier.

I wonder if just the guts of a generic USB device are available
somewhere.  I don't mind soldering, but am slightly clueless about
what to solder where.

gnuplot can do this.  Depending on how gnuplot is built, it will 
likely require X11 libraries, but I don't think it will insist on 
opening an X11 display.

Have you ever thought about asking the USB maintainer about the issue?

If you don't mind soldering, you could make your own.

I haven't been following this, but would a USB mouse work? I have
several of them. The "receiver" is a little stick the size of a flash
drive. The mouse is wireless and has an on-off switch. (Or you could
take out the batteries.) Thus, all you'd have running would be the
receiver.

Thanks for the replies - finally figured out how to get xgraph working.
All is well . . .

OS X has multiple ways to access device, including through the BSD
part of the kernel (/dev/*) or through the I/O registry.

http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeviceDrivers/Conceptual/AccessingHardware/AH_Other_APIs/chapter_2_section_2.html

If you have Xcode installed there should be a utility called I/O
Registry Explorer you could poke around in to see if something is
registered there.

http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeviceDrivers/Conceptual/IOKitFundamentals/TheRegistry/chapter_4_section_3.html

If you don't have Xcode installed, you can probably find out some
information from System Profiler.  Unfortunately I don't know much
else beyond that :-)

No.  But that's because he's mostly a driver guy and kernel hacker,
and I don't care about drivers for this.

This could be the problem. It has been reported as a bug, but I don't see
that it is resolved.
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcdbd/+bug/93360

As suggested  you could uninstall dhcdbd and set up eth0 as a static
network.

In /etc/network/interfaces replace
iface eth0 inet dhcp
with
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
        address 192.168.1.2
        network 192.168.1.0
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        gateway 192.168.1.1
        broadcast 192.168.1.255

using the right gateway etc for your network.

The other suggestion in the bug thread was to install dhclient, but that
would be difficult without a network connection unless it is on your
installation CD.

What kind of network are you trying to put this host on?  That
169.254.x.x IP address is in the local link address range, used by
Zeroconf devices.  Are your other hosts in this same IP range?

Shameless plug (for my day job) on PLUG:
<http://search.promopeddler.com/cat/USB>

If you're looking for a dongle replacement, for a larger *quantity*  
of items (or just need a "sample" for a possible larger future  
order), this way you can kill several birds with one stone by:
a) Outsourcing a portion of your research to a salesdroid (who will  
then re-outsource it to a manufacturer/supplier)
b) Using a local company (It's based out of Sherwood, but specializes  
in global product searches)
c) Working with a company used to marketing/branding "products", so  
every time somebody looks at the device, rather than seeing yet  
another useless dongle, it can actually be a device with a modicum of  
utility, or at least beauty.

Brute force web hacks exist, FWIW.

Somebody already mentioned Apache's index generation....

So, another frequent vector to consider: mod_speling is not always  
your friend. A reasonable apache setup designed to correct for  
CJ33WQ.htm will *happily* find cj33wq.html.

Oh, and it never hurts to deny unfriendlies/bots, unless, of course,  
your denial gives more exploit/other information away.

For a few breathtaking pauses on the issue.

I'm not really familiar with network terminology. I'm trying to learn. Here
is the ifconfig output from the machine I'm on now, a laptop with openSUSE
10.3.I've never really had an issue like this, that' probably the main
reason I'm not familiar. The HP tx1000 has Vista on it and it find the
internet fine. openSUSE on an old toshiba (output below) find both ethernet
and wireless. I'm not trying to do anything complicated, just want internet.
I think the same subnet is fine.

Subject: [PLUG] Gutsy upgrade killed /dev/md3
Message-ID: <20071117120456.8f90de8a.johnxj@comcast.net>

I think I can fix it, but I need to borrow someone's brains to do so.

Yesterday I decided to upgrade my desktop from Feisty to Gutsy (amd64). Feisty was the original installation, done when I built the computer back in April. The machine has two 320 GB hard drives set up as RAID1 devices:

/dev/md0	4GB		swap
/dev/md1	50GB	/
/dev/md2 20GB	formatted ext3, unused
/dev/md3	230GB	formatted ext3, contained backups and some distro ISOs

The last two were mounted at /media/md2 and /media/md3 in fstab. Everything worked. Others here may remember a long thread when I built the computer because of problems creating the arrays. The problems disappeared after I returned the POS Abit motherboard to Fry's and bought an Asus instead. In other words, all my hair pulling was due to a buggy SATA-2 controller on the Abit board. The system ran flawlessly after replacing the motherboard.

After doing a dist-upgrade (using Update Manager GUI), upon restarting the computer, I got dumped to a root shell. The error message was that /dev/md3 did not exist due to a bad superblock. I could continue to boot with ctrl-d, whereupon I discovered that it did not mount either md2 or md3. I could manually mount md2, but md3 does not exist. It is odd that fstab lists both and there is nothing wrong with md2, yet it failed to mount it as well as md3. The relevant lines in fstab are:

#the following two lines added by me 4/30/2007
/dev/md2		/media/md2	ext3	defaults,errors=remount-ro	0	1
/dev/md3		/media/md3	ext3	defaults,errors=remount-ro	0	1

I found a bug report that appears relevant here:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mdadm/+bug/155355

While the upgrade did not change /etc/fstab, it did make a new /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf file. The old one said:

ARRAY /dev/md0 level=raid1 num-devices=2 UUID=<long-ass number here>
ARRAY /dev/md1 level=raid1 num-devices=2 UUID=<long-ass number here>
ARRAY /dev/md2 level=raid1 num-devices=2 UUID=<long-ass number here>
#ARRAY /dev/md3 level=raid1 num-devices=2 UUID=

The new one created by the upgrade says:

ARRAY /dev/md0 level=raid1 num-devices=2 UUID=<long-ass number here>
ARRAY /dev/md1 level=raid1 num-devices=2 UUID=<long-ass number here>
ARRAY /dev/md2 level=raid1 num-devices=2 UUID=<long-ass number here>
ARRAY /dev/md3 level=raid1 num-devices=/dev/sda4, /dev/sdb4

Now that is just weird. First, how did it work in the past when the line for md3 was commented out? And second, what possessed the upgrade script (I assume it was a script) to uncomment the md3 line, and then use the device list for the number of devices?

I attempted to use tune2fs to find the UUID number for md3, thinking that I could pop it in where it belongs in the new mdadm.conf file. However, tune2fs says the device does not exist.

I think the problem is exactly what the root shell error message said - that there is a bad superblock for md3. However, so far I have failed to resurrect it. I have man-paged mdadm, but can't figure out how to find the location of the backup superblock. Or does one use mdadm for that? I also tried e2fsck, e.g., "sudo e2fsck -b 8192" (changing the "8192" to 16384 and 32768, per man e2fsck), but neither works.

It's not the end of the world if I have to wipe out md3 and start over. It contained only backups and some distro ISOs that I can recreate and re-download. Nevertheless, if I can restore the superblock and that fixes it, then I can save a major annoyance.

Any suggestions welcome!

Message-ID: <20071117232810.l0d1vnhb6s4w4oo0@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I am aware of and have set up webcam_server 0.50 on an Internet
connected Linux box with a static ip.  What if the IP address is
dynamic or the camera needs to be behind a NAT'ed gateway?  The
package webcam_server seems to be designed to thwart attempts to
stream to a remote web site in the name of security.

I want to be able to stream video from any computer with a
temporary Internet connection to another computer with a static
Internet connection.  One would expect skype for Linux to
facilitate this, but it doesn't.  Do I need to set up a full
blown VPN to do video conferencing between any two Linux boxes
over the Net?  Can an ssh tunnel create a virtual lan
over the Net?  The remote client isn't going to get a static
ip address any time soon.  The remote client can see my camera,
but I can't see her camera.

Agreed.  Gnuplot will make PNGs and GIFs and JPEGs and others.  I
am working on generating some web graphics that way myself.

You OpenSUSE laptop has a 192.168.x.x IP address, which is in the
range that most commodity home firewalls or routers should give out.
Since your Ubuntu machine doesn't have an IP address in the same
range, it's not getting one from the same place as your OpenSUSE
laptop (presumably it's getting it from whatever firewall or router
you plug your machines into to connect to the internet).

Can you confirm that your ethernet connection is set to DHCP?
Unfortunately, I don't know how to do that on Ubuntu.

Yeah, I wish I knew how to do that. If anybody does, please let me know.

First you could try a static ip to see if that fixes the problem. To
temporarily try a static ip use the following commands

sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.25
sudo route add default gw 192.168.1.1

then test the connection by pinging yahoo.com
ping -c 1 216.109.112.135

If this returns something like

PING 216.109.112.135 (216.109.112.135) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 216.109.112.135: icmp_seq=1 ttl=44 time=117 ms

Then it works and you can figure out how to make the changes permanent.

Subject: [PLUG] How fast is my network, really?
Message-ID: <20071118231134.2e55ab79.johnxj@comcast.net>

My laptop and my desktop are connected over ethernet, all components of
which are cat6, and each computer has gigabit lan built in. Since Aaron
helped me get my backup partition on the desktop fixed at the Clinic
today, this evening I decided it was time to back up the laptop to the
desktop. By my calculation it ran at about 105 MB per minute. However,
I cannot figure out how fast "gigabit" is in terms of real bytes. I
noted that the hard drives on the desktop (which is SATA-2) came on and
off, and the laptop (which is probably SATA-1, and definitely slower)
was only flickering, not on constantly. Thus, I conclude that the
network was the bottleneck, not the hard disks. Or maybe the bottleneck
is dar, which is the tool I used (via Home User Backup). Both computers
run Gutsy x86_64.

Is 105 MB/minute a decent rate? What is typical in the real world for
this kind of equipment?

1GB = 125 MB = 119 MiB.  Speaking as someone who's just finished a
12-month contract testing network hardware at Intel, 105 MB per second
would be really good.  I can't guess why you'd see 1/60th of that,
unless you're actually running at 100Mbps, or even WiFi at 54 Mbps.

105MB/m / 60 = 1.75MB/s

1.75MB/s * 8 = 14Mb/s

That's quite low for gig, even on commodity desktop hardware.  I backed up a
server the other night to my T61 over GigE, and was getting 110MB/s (6600MB/m).

Iperf works great for performance testing.

Message-ID: <e2aeccd60711190155u5c524ebeveac45eec18468e2d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
I was wondering if someone could point me in the direction of a kernel
repo that has older Fedora released kernels. The reason I need to
downgrade is that the stock kernel that ships with FC7 2.6.21 has some
sort of funky bug that causes my laptop to run like crap. I need
something =< 2.6.18 which where the bug doesn't seem to show up. If I
disable APIC and ACPI then I can use the stock kernel but then I can't
use wireless (you can see my conundrum here). The newest kernel 2.6.23
fixes the bug _however_ the ATI drivers won't work properly with it so
I can't use my eye candy AIGLX goodness... so frustrating.

So anyways sorry for the rant. Google has failed to find me a repo
with old kernels so any clue stick hitting would be appreciated.

Drew-

Nevermind! I was able to get everything working properly with 2.6.23
so laptop is happy with catchy eye candy now =)

Thanks to both you and Aaron for the info. Evidently something is
seriously hanging things up. It seems to me that it must be either the
connection (wiring or components) or the software (dar - Home User
Backup). It should not be the hard disks, because even SATA-1 is
supposed to be good for 150 MB/second. And both computers definitely
have gigabit ethernet, although one could certainly question whether
the drivers are up to snuff. One of them is my T61 laptop.

I have a crossover cable, so I decided to do the backup over again this
morning with a direct connection to see if it is the wiring.
Unfortunately, as I took the cable out of its plastic wrap (bought it,
never used it before), I noted that it was only Cat5, not even Cat5e.
So I decided to test the dar software first. I have a folder on the
laptop that contains 8.9 GB of MP3 files (according to Nautilus - du
says it is 9371860, which I guess is MB). I used Nautilus and dragged
and dropped the whole thing onto the desktop. It took 7:38 (7.63
minutes), which I guess comes out to (using the du figure) 1.228290957
GB/min, or 20.471515 MB/sec. That's still about five times slower than
it should be. However, it is a vast improvement over the performance of
dar, so evidently dar is doing a lot of computing. I note that dar put
everything into one huge .dar file. The Home User Backup GUI front end
for it is not very helpful - you can't tell if it is compressing or
what it is doing. Then again, I don't know exactly what Nautilus does
when it copies a file. And when I did the copy this morning with
Nautilus, neither hard drive light was on constantly.

I looked at the website for lperf. It looked like it would take me a
while to figure out how to use it. I need something to test the wiring,
hardware and drivers independently of the backup/copy software. Is that
what lperf will do?

Is there a reason you need avahi?  In the past I have read no end of
complaints about how avahi (and zeroconf before it) screws with users'
abilities to connect to the Internet.  Personally, I avoid it like the
plague, but obviously someone somewhere has uses for it or it wouldn't
exist.  Maybe you need it for something.

If not, the first thing I would do is shutdown and disable the
avahi-daemon.  That alone might fix things.

Second thing I would do is disable IPv6, but that's just because it has
caused me huge problems with Debian and Ubuntu.  In other distros I've
tried (and on OS X), IPv6 wasn't a problem, so I wouldn't necessarily
take it as a given that because your openSUSE installation has IPv6
enabled, that couldn't be part of the problem you're having with Ubuntu.

There is a trace of the DHCP conversation and address assignment in
/var/log/syslog (Ubuntu).  On my laptop it looks like this:

Just because the interface to the drive is 150 MB/s doesn't mean your 
drive can fill it.  For example, a recent model Seagate Momentus 
5400.4 drive has a SATA-3 interface, but it's sustained rate is 806 
Mb/s, or roughly 200 MB/s.  You may want to run the disk/filesystem 
performance tool 'bonnie' to get an idea of your disks' throughput.

The disk lights don't say anything about usage factor - they are 
designed to stay on long enough so that you can see that something
is happening.  The actual sector writes are a lot faster than any
blink you can see.

You are almost certainly seeing disk speed and program speed rather
than gigabit ethernet speed limits.  See:

http://wiki.dirvish.org/index.cgi?SataDrives

... for some information on SATA-1 speeds.  You should expect more
than 30MB/sec for SATA-1 desktop hardware, less for laptop drives
(which are power limited) .  A best-of-breed backup program built 
around rsync will keep the disks busy because it juggles multiple
files at once, and will do so even with slow networks because it
transfers only the changes over the network.  Most backup programs
are not that sophisticated, and some dodder along with a  read-
think-write-think-verify-think process that can be very slow.

With dirvish (rsync based) and a 100mb network, I back up 7 
machines and 120GB in less than 3 hours.  That includes 2 machines
that are 1000+ miles away.  The resulting backup images are 
complete, directly readable, and mountable/bootable.  They are
hardlinked to other images so I can typically get 300+ complete
images on a 500GB hard drive.

There are tools that test disk speed, and tools that test networks.
I imagine your gigabit network is capable of 100MB/sec or so.  My
general rule of thumb is bit speed divided by 10, which can be a
little pessimistic or a lot optimistic.  Wifi is usually slower
because of increased latency.

I can't be sure if you're talking about one computer or two here.  Is
the server you backed up at 110MB/s a different machine than the one you
are having trouble with?

What does mii-tool report?  Maybe something else in the connection is
negotiating the link down to a slower speed.

Try this:

   sudo mii-tool eth0

If there are any 10M or 100M devices on your switch, it is likely that
all connected devices will automatically slow down to match the slowest
device. There have been a few articles about this lately.

I had wondered why my colo network's back net has been so slow since I
plugged a 100T NIC into the switch, and now I know.

Due to circumstances beyond our control, Paul Leddy will not be speaking 
tonight and my alternate is busy.

Any suggestions other than heavy drinking?

Q & A session?

I could give a short presentaion on the video servers I built for Orycon, 
but I am not certain if that would take the whole hour+.

On the server: iperf -b -u
On the client: iperf -c SERVER_IP_ADDR -b 1000Mb

Most computers/kernel will need to be tuned to use Gig-E to full
capacity.  NAPI enable drivers
are a must.

Heh, beat me to it.  I was like "no!  iperf is easy to use!". :)

I have personal anecdotal experiences where an x-over cable for GigE
between two hosts didn't work well.  I didn't have the time to go dig up
a GigE switch and figure out why this was.  The server backup I did last
Friday was over a GigE switch.

I don't know anything about dar, and this might not be remotely true,
but if there is encryption going on, there might be CPU bottlenecks.
Run top (or equivalent) at both ends to see.

Sorry to miss the asterisk talk.

I dont know much about video servers and would be pleased to hear what Alan has to say.

I have a short talk (preparing it for a meeting in Dec) on using CruiseControl and Ant to do some remote building. It's not very advanced and not really complete yet, but I'd be willing to wing it. Just for fun. I've been laughed at so much it doesn't bother me anymore.

It turns out to be pretty easy to build with Fedora and the right 
repositories.

I will talk to you about this later when I find out if the speaker for 
December is actually in town or not.

I'm pretty sure you're right about dar. The problem is that I ran it
using Home Office Backup, which is a GUI front end for dar. The GUI
barely displays enough options to let you choose the folder(s) to back
up and the location to back them up to. There is no mention of
compression, encryption, etc. Therefore, I have no idea what it
actually did. I do know that it created a single massive .dar file on
the backup media, and that it took about 60 times as long as it should
have, considering the theoretical throughput of the devices. I also
know that dar does not do compression by default (from the man page).
On the other hand, Keith's "think-write-think-write" comment probably
describes what it was doing pretty accurately.

I also know that I copied 8.9 GB of MP3 files this morning just
dragging and dropping with Nautilus. I assume (probably naively) that
Nautilus here is a front end for the cp command. I timed the process
and got results that were only five times as long as it should have
taken, given the theoretical throughput.

These results imply that there is something going on with the wiring
and/or devices or their drivers. I did the wiring myself with cat6 wire
and plugs, and I'm far from a professional - like I used a little
plastic thingy to punch the wires down. It could be nothing more
complicated than a poor connection.

There's also the comment in this thread that if there is anything else
that is only 10/100 in the network it might drag the whole thing down.
Well, there are not only numerous 10/100 devices on the network, there
are even a couple of 10-only devices, although, at the time none of
them were turned on. And, while the two computers in question both have
gigabit ethernet, and are connected with cat6 cables, and the switch
and patch block in between are cat6, these older devices are connected
with old cat5e patch cables. All this needs to be investigated. I need
to use lperf or some of the other tools that have been mentioned.

Unfotunately, further research is going to have to wait a day or two,
as I must do a homework project now that is due Thursday. But in the
meantime, no one need worry about my losing my data due to failing to
back things up. I produce only a dozen pages of new stuff a week, and
every few hours I make a paper printout of it. If I have a highly
productive day I copy newly created files to a thumb drive. I'll be OK
for a while.

Further comments welcome. I'll revisit this thread in a couple days.

My money is on a combination of mismatched network speeds. If you have  
a dumb switch that does support mixed mode, or dumb drivers that dont  
scale back properly, you'll end up with massive send a receive errors  
causing so many retires that you see slow speeds as the end result.
Compression or encryption in my mind wouldn't cause this.
I routinely send compressed and encrypted backups over the network. I  
use Bzip level 9, with ccrypt, over FTP/TLS. The most backwards way,  
yes, but I'm paranoid  ;)
Factoring in all that, I still only see about 30% CPU usage, and  
maxing out a 100mbit link easily.

A program I recomend for real time bandwidth usage on a clean console  
window is Slurm.

http://www.wormulon.net/slurm

Very clean and useful program for quick and easy realtime bandwidth  
usage visualization. Combined with Top, vmstat, and gstat for you BSD  
folk, you can pinpoint any bottle neck.

I would like someone to answer this question.  I have another reason to 
downgrade the kernel.  The last two kernels do not recognize my ATA 
drive.  I am lucky in that my OS is loaded on the SCSI drive.

When I upgraded from Edgy to Feisty the new kernel added USB-suspend,
and it broke my USB scanner. The problem is fixed now in the kernel
that Gutsy installs, but at the time I tried to figure out how to
downgrade the kernel. I was told from several sources that I could
probably run Feisty (which I desperately needed for the upgrade to OOo)
on the same kernel as Edgy. Unfortunately, I was never able to follow
the instructions for how to install the older kernel. I no longer need
to know how to do this, but I am still interested in knowing how to use
an older kernel. It would be cool if someone could explain the process.

Well I don't feel so silly for asking now :). I know how to downgrade
on slackware and or lilo bootloader based distros but gutsy and core
use grub and my grub foo is not so good. One thing I noticed with
fedora is that it doiesnt appear they keep legacy repo packages for
folks like us who may need to downgrade a package or two. I'm not sure
why that is.

Anyways if I find out how to do this ill happily pass it along to the list

Message-ID: <727fc2ee0711201015r64d18e8dv545af550b308c123@mail.gmail.com>

HI

Setting up my wireless....

Have a couple of questions...

What I am doing is connecting two machines via wireless...

MY DSL comes in on my Cisco DSL box..

I want to connect my computer in the other room to this computer...

I bought two G routers...

Have connected one G router to my Cisco DSL box..

And the other G router to my remote < 10 feet away> computer...

< I could have ran a cable but, wanted the G experience>

My Question...

I couldn't web configure either box until I changed my IP on the
configuring box..

In other words..

ON the box connected to the Cisco DSL router... My browser would not
go there till I changed my IP to 192.168.2.2  < the web config
interface on    G box is 192.168.2.1

On the remote box I have to change ip to 192.168.0.2.. <web interface
on d-link g box is 192.168.0.1>

I had been using <still am > the 10.x.x.x on all my boxes.. with gate
way of 10.0.0.1......

Why did I have to change ips on box to browse G boxes..???????

I have both boxes set to channel 6...  No password..  They don't see
each other....

Or I can't ping form one box to the other.... So I assume they can't
see each other..

<I have changed the IP back to 10.x.x.x.

TIA

It sounds like you're trying to set up a wireless bridge.  Not all
consumer grade wireless routers will do this by default, so check the
manuals.  Even if your routers don't support wireless bridging
officially, they can probably be made to if you're willing to take the
plunge and install third party firmware like DD-WRT.  Only do this if
you know what you're getting into.

Consumer wireless routers are designed with the expectation that hosts
connecting to them will get their IP address from the router's DHCP
service.  They'll normally hand out IP addresses in the 192.168.x.x
range.  If some machine outside their address range tries to connect
to them, they probably assume it doesn't belong to their local network
and shouldn't be trusted.  I'm guessing this is why you couldn't bring
up the configuration interface until you changed your IP address.
Presumably, your Cisco DSL box also runs a DHCP service.  Unless you
have some reason not to, you should probably set your hosts to get
their IP addresses via DHCP so they can talk to whichever router
they're currently plugged into.

By computer do you mean the DSL modem, or is there another
windows/linux/mac/bsd/etc.. machine on that end too?

You really probably only need one router, just use a wireless card in
the remote machine(s).  As Nick mentioned, the routers generally
aren't set up to be used to create a wireless bridge, and while it may
be possible to make them work that way, it's going to take a *lot* of
effort compared to the ease of using wireless cards with one router.

The standard configuration is to plug one router into your dsl modem,
and put wireless cards in each of the machines that you want on the
network.  Alternatively, you could build a router / firewall with two
wired nics and put that between the dsl modem and the wireless router,
also using wireless cards in the other machines.

In a small or home network environment, it would be simpler to use the
DSL router as *the* router (including DHCP services) and to configure
both WiFI routers to be simple Access Points (AP).  Most WiFI routers
offer this configuration option.

In fact, it used to strike me as odd that an simple AP could cost the
same as a WiFI router -- but sometimes (e.g. Best Buy) they do.  I
suppose the electronics are identical in each case, the AP just has
some features turned off.  Old hardware design tricks never die ;-)

(Usually a "bridge" means a device that "bridges" two disparate
networks.  For example, 192.168.0.255 would need to be bridged with
10.255.255.255, etc.)

Look for the acronym WDS on the box or in the manual for the wireless
routers.  If the devices are capable of WDS, read up on how to
configure that.  Otherwise, you'll need to set up one of them in
client mode (which usually isn't possible with stock firmware, there
are exceptions).  You could check to see if your current router (or
consider buying a wireless router that) can be reflashed with OpenWrt
or equivalent, and then you have considerably more flexibility to
configuration of other modes.

Where "considerably more flexibility" means "You're root, it's Linux, have a
good time."

I was hoping for an answer using yum and pointing to some repository.  
What I came up with was installing the kernel from an rpm from 
www.rpmfind.net.  I had to use the "--force" option, because rpm would 
not install it because I had two later versions already installed.

The command I used: sudo rpm -ivh --force 
ftp://fr.rpmfind.net/linux/fedora/core/development/i386/os/Fedora/kernel-2.6.21-1.3142.fc7.i686.rpm

Rebooted and got my ATA drive back.

You are right, "best" is a bit vague.  If I read your terminology
correctly, I guess I'm looking for "shared".  I don't need a xen
instance to myself; just somewhere to upload my PHP app and gain access
to my database schema.  The absence of a bandwidth quota is also a must.
Can you still get all this in the $10/month price range, or thereabouts?
That seemed like a popular price point back in the day, when I was still
using web hosting services.

"Absence of a bandwidth quota" is a sign of a shoddy hosting
operation, because what they're really selling at the core is disk,
processing power, and bandwidth. No one can truly sell unlimited
bandwidth, so find a host that sells enough for your needs at a
reasonable price.

I use asmallorange.com - http://asmallorange.com/services/hosting/ -
and have had no problems. I've also heard good things about site5 -
http://www.site5.com/ - they appear to be offering 7.5TB bandwidth/mo
at $7.50.

This is a just another variation of the same problem that you recently
posted to the list about -- that you don't have the kernel-headers
package installed. For example, for slackware 12, the package is:

http://packages.slackware.it/package.php?q=12.0/kernel-headers-2.6.21.5_smp-i386-2

As I understand it, you want the kernel headers available that match
the kernel headers of the kernel that your glibc was compiled for,
not necessarily the headers of the current kernel you're running.

>    However, /usr/include/linux/errno.h exists, and so does

Irrelevant, /usr/include/bits/errno.h has included <asm/errno.h>, which
won't match that.

> /usr/include/linux/asm/errno.h.

Unless matplotlib is set up to look specifically in /usr/include/linux/
via -I (it's not in the reported build attempt above), it won't find
this version either.

_isnan.c is the source file included by matplotlib that compilation
failed on. That there's multiple files named that (including the one
from the package you're trying to build in /tmp/SBo/ and one from an
earlier version of matplotlib) isn't particularly relevant or surprising.

   I do know about kernel header versions matching glibc versions, but that
seems to have been lost to me in these attempts. This box is running
Slackware-11.0 with a 2.6.19.2 kernel, while the default kernel for the
distribution was 2.4.33.3. Since I had earlier run 2.4.34, and the 2.6
kernel since last March, I'm wondering why I've not before encountered this
problem.

   Thanks, Steve. Installing the 2.4.33.3 headers fixed that up.

I'd go to webhostingtalk.com and plug in the names of the hosts you're 
considering into their forum search engine.  Nearly every host has 
somebody with a horror story so take what you read with a grain of salt, 
one bad review isn't exactly a show stopper but hundreds should steer 
you away.

Also, it's been my universal experience that any plan which costs 
<=$10/month and offers storage measuring in the 10's of gigabytes and 
bandwidth in multi terabyte sizes *will* suck.

Right on.  I will take this good advice.  And I'm sure my cohort can
cough up more than $10/month.  I was basing that figure on the amount
I used to pay at 1planhost back in my winblows days.

Modern Linux software raid volumes store their signature information on each
volume, this is the "persistent superblock, IIRC. This allows mdadm to
assemble the array without a specific config. It looks at all the RAID-type
partitions and just puts together the ones with correlating superblock
information.

And second, what possessed the upgrade script (I assume it was a script) to

I would guess it is a bug of some sort. Either the upgrade script genuinely
didn't know how to handle it, or something got interrupted.

<snip attempted fixes so far>

My first suggestion would be to simply comment that line out and see if
mdadm successfully can do its thing.  I'll have to double check, but I don't
think any of the systems I'm running now use raid.conf at all. They are all
just persistent superblocked, and when mdadm starts it scans and creates
them.

You only need kernel headers for software that relies on kernel
headers (which is rare and discouraged).

I'm using eapps.com. I couldn't tell you all the details but I know they do
current version of postgres or mysql, php 5. I'm pretty happy with it. Uses
CentOS. I've been thinking about trying something else out though, just for
the experience. 10$ a month should get you the basic setup. One thing I like
about them is they help me with any issues I have, usually the same day.

PHP 5.2+ project:
http://www.gophp5.org/hosts

And as far as getting "PHP 5.1.x" hosting (currently being deployed  
with CentOS/RHEL), that's not too bad, as long as you don't, uhm, use  
array-related calls, but most PHP code does.

I'm partial to pair.com, myself, but they're still using mysql 5  
<insert flame war here> for their low-end hosting.

Reflecting other's posts, "unlimited bandwidth" generally means "we  
don't bill you for it, but there's a definite cap". Otherwise yahoo,  
google, akamai, etc. would all be hosting there, and getting a few  
million dollars worth of bandwidth per month for free.

I always get the router.  If you disable DHCP and don't use the WAN 
port, then you have an AP that can be used for something more complex 
down the road.  Some AP's however can be used as a wireless repeater and 
bridge, which many routers cannot.

If I were Iam, I would purchase a wireless card for the computer in the 
next room and use the router for an AP connected to a switch/modem.

<rant>
   The Linksys WAP54G AP can act as an expander to the WRT54G. However
   if you use WPA encryption, the passphrase must only have alpha-
   numeric characters.  Symbols (@#$%) will cause the AP not to bind
   to the router.  I think the Qwest Actiontec modems have the same
   limitation with the symbols in the passphrase.  What the @#$%?

A WAP54G reportedly draws about half the power (about 3W instead of 6
or 7W).  And the electronics are not identical, since the router
clearly has 4 LAN ports and the switch parts that go with it.  

I try not to buy anything that I can't put OpenWrt on, which narrows
it down quite a bit.  A meraki mini is the cheapest (and kind of
coolest) I know of at the moment, at around $50, but if you want a
standard wifi router, the cheapest OpenWrt'able device I know of
(since Buffalo is enjoined from US sales at the moment) is the Linksys
WRT54GL at around $60+change.  I am not aware of any brick&mortar
stores in town that stock those, but they are just a couple days away
from places like newegg.

   I bought a new WRT54GC on eBay for $35 (shipping included). Had I wanted
one with the external antenna, I would have bid on that auction or bought
just the antenna alone. Don't know if you can put OpenWrt on it, but it
serves my needs quite well since the WAP54G died.

Subject: [PLUG] Bluetooth rox
Message-ID: <20071122174330.5cd3afad.johnxj@comcast.net>

I recently added a couple of bluetooth devices to my new Thinkpad T61
running Gutsy x86_64, specifically, Sony DR-BT50 headphones and a
Logitech V270 optical mouse. Both required a couple of commands from a
terminal to enable them, but they work flawlessly. As for bluetooth on
the computer, Ubuntu just did it, no configuration required. I boot the
computer and there is the mouse, no wires, no USB receiver to lose,
just the mouse. I connect to a streaming radio station or play an MP3
or a CD in Rhythmbox and the sound comes out the laptop speakers or
headphone jack, unless I have turned on the headphones. If the
headphones are turned on, the sound automatically comes out of the
headphones. No fiddling required. I can walk all over the house without
wires. The DR-BT50 are the first serious audiophile quality bluetooth
headphones on the market and the sound is awesome. They also have an
inconspicuous built in microphone if you want to use them with a cell
phone. This setup is going to be really cool when I am at PSU. I'm
especially glad I got this stuff all set up now so I won't have to
listen to US radio during the coming season of retail orgy.

If your computer does not have bluetooth built in you can get a USB
bluetooth dongle thingy from Fry's for under $20. I gave $27 on eBay
for the mouse and $141 to Amazon for the headphones. If you just want
cheap voice quality headphones to use with a cell you can get them for
$20-30.

I just ordered a bluetooth receiver to connect to the stereo. I can use
it to stream internet radio stations, MP3s or CDs through the computer
to the aux input jacks on the stereo. I also ordered a bluetooth
transmitter for my iPod. Bluetooth is awesome.

Have you tried to use the microphone  with the computer? I'd be curious  to
know if it works. If it does, these might make a nice gaming headset...

Thanks for posting your experience!

Subject: [PLUG] Launch executable, nothing happens?
Message-ID: <20071123233257.cbe79c11.johnxj@comcast.net>

Lately I've had a couple issues that leave me totally puzzled. In a
desperate attempt to get music playing properly on my Gutsy x86_64
laptop I have been trying various players (Banshee, Amarok, Rhythmbox,
inter alia). I found a cool one mentioned in an Ubuntu forum -
Songbird. I installed it from the website into ~/Software/Songbird and
it appeared to be installed OK. There was an executable in there
"songbird" and I launched it by double clicking on it. So far, so good.
After fiddling with it for a while I closed it down. Later I tried to
relaunch it, but double clicking on the executable does not launch it.
I restarted the computer, but it still won't launch. Nautilus
identifies the file as an executable. From the command line "songbird"
just gives me a new prompt. No error message, nada. What is even
weirder is that, in spite of the fact that there definitely exists a
file /home/jjj/Software/Songbird/Songbird/songbird, a search on the
filesystem (Places > Search for Files) turns up no such file. Is
Nautilus on drugs?

OK, that is weird enough, but then I decided to try out Noatun, a KDE
music player. It is listed in Synaptic, so that is how I installed it.
The installation created a launch entry in Applications > Sound &
Video. Clicking on the launch item does nothing. Launching it from the
command line also does nothing. That is, I am just returned to a prompt
with no error messages. A search for files reveals no files named
"noatun," although there are various icon files with that name. What is
this? Is Synaptic on drugs?

There is more to this saga that someone here may be able to give me
insight into. I have cool bluetooth headphones and they are awesome,
but RealPlayer will not send sound to them. All other apps will send
sound to the headphones as long as they are turned on; if not, the app
sends the sound to the internal speakers or headphone jack. But
RealPlayer will only send sound to the internal speakers or the
headphone jack. I have googled all over, but bluetooth headphones are
pretty recent on the market and I get no hits on my search. Evidently I
am stuck and must replace RealPlayer with something else. Therefore, I
am looking for an alternative (preferably native Linux open source)
music player that can play MP3s and can play streaming radio. Rhythmbox
is bug city. Amarok spams you with default links you cannot delete, and
the rest that I have tried have various other problems. I'd be
interested in other suggestions.

i tried changing my file to what you recommended and the only thing that
happened that was different was my computer didn't take as long
"connecting", but i still couldn't ping, and had no internet. the next thing
i'm going to try to do is install dhclient.

me. thanks!

We may be  going down the wrong path here, but if you want to pursue
it a little more, after you make the above changes you should do
sudo ifdown eth0
sudo ifup eth0
and then send us the output of
ping -c 1 216.109.112.135
sudo ifconfig
sudo route -n

Do you know what your other players are using for their default output
plugin?  You should be able to find it from their configuration
settings.  I don't know what Gutsy uses by default, but my Gentoo
machine uses ALSA.  I'd be surprised if the RealPlayer audio output
issue weren't due to not using the same audio output plugin as the
others.

There's a post-XMMS Winamp-skinnable player called Audacious which
works for me.  It should be pretty stable.  The only problem I've ever
had with it is confusing it with Audacity because both project names
are based on the same pun.

You may not be able to do what you're trying to do.  I would just get a 
wireless card in the computer in the other room, or return that router 
and get a WET54G (or equiv) bridge to attach to that machine.  If the 
routers have advanced routing options which allow you to specify routes 
then you might be able to pull this off, but I just don't see why 
someone would want this complex for a home setup.

Thanks for the response.

I tried Audacious (and I have had Audacity installed for a long time, as I use it for phonetics stuff). Audacious cannot seem to play streaming radio so I deleted it. Besides it has an awful interface, plus its playlist does not work, at least not on Gutsy x86_64. Even without the playlist, I cannot get it to play streaming radio, even by entering it manually.

As for other players and their default output, I assume they are all using ALSA, because (as far as I can determine) ALSA is all that I have installed. As for RealPlayer, God only knows what it is using. Proprietary software is not famous for letting you know what it is doing. If ALSA is all that I have installed, that is what it must be using. But other apps have no problem with my bluetooth headphones, so the bluetooth thing must reside outside of ALSA. Google turns up little about this, as bluetooth headphones are pretty new to to market. If I could get RealPlayer to send the sound to the headphones I would just use RealPlayer and forget about the rest.

Since my original post I have continued to try alternatives. I have found that Gxine is pretty good, but cannot play a lot of streaming radio formats. VLC can play the ones that Gxine cannot play, but cannot play the ones that Gxine can play. (Go figure.) Totem seems to be able to play anything I throw at it, but I cannot figure out how to create a playlist. I keep searching for something that can play MP3s on my hard disk and also streaming radio in various formats, and keep all the options in playlists.

Seems as though you're headed in the right direction.  However, if the
routers are not dumbed down to mere Access Points, then they will
behave as routers -- and that's not going to work.  Once configured,
make sure the APs and your PCs are on the same net as your Cisco DSL
router.

Example:
192.168.2.1 Cisco DSL -- gateway to ISP
192.168.2.2 AP-1
192.168.2.3 AP-2
192.168.2.10 PC-1
192.168.2.100 PC-2
etc.

Guess I missed the make / model info about the routers -- would be helpful.

I always use mplayer for all realplayer content on my gentoo x86_64
box.  Realplayer is installed, but it is bunk.  I had to take care to
compile mplayer with the "rm" USE flag.  Not sure if Ubuntu's prebuilt
binary mplayer has realmedia support compiled into it or not.

I often have to use the following tactic to play stuff that is
embedded into web pages (streaming or not).  This is because of a lack
of web browser plugin support:

- right-click on the web page, then click "view source"
- find the URL to the actual streaming resource in the HTML
- in a shell, type "mplayer <URL>"

There might be another factor: codecs.  My 64 bit gentoo box has the
following packages installed.  Does Ubuntu have similar packages?

media-libs/amd64codecs
media-libs/win32codecs

I found a few more packages that look like they may help get a 64 bit
box to play in a 32 bit world.  Two of these jump out as obvious
players in the audio/visual arena:

app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-medialibs
app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-qtlibs
app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-sdl
app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-soundlibs
app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-xlibs

Thanks for the suggestions. In the three years that I have been using
Linux I have always avoided Mplayer. The reason is that it has a
bewildering array of options and I don't understand what any of them
do. I lack the motivation to learn what they do because I have no
interest in video. Also, I could never figure out how to get the movie
window to go away when I am just playing audio. Plus, in its current
incarnation (Gutsy x86_64) it doesn't seem to be able to play anything
- there is a bug that keeps it from finding the audio system. Either
that or I am missing a component. 

And regarding the above packages, those must be the files that you have
installed. I searched my entire filesystem on the filenames like
"medialibs," etc., and found none of them, nor do I have any of the
folders. I installed it from Synaptic, which is usually pretty good
above making sure all dependencies are met. Clearly, something is
missing that is keeping it from finding the audio system.

I think once I used Mplayer from the command line to convert a .wma to
something else that Audacity could play, but otherwise, Mplayer is too
much. All I want is audiophile quality music. Having said that, I'd try
Mplayer if I could get it to play both streaming radio and MP3s, but
there seems to be no way to create a playlist anyway nor, could I
figure out how to get it to play a streaming radio station, e.g.:

http://shoutcast.omroep.nl:8148/listen.pls
http://www.tvr.by/liveradio/radiocult.asx
http://www.catradio.com/CatalunyaMusica.ram
http://210.242.69.206/ramgen/broadcast/BCC/encoder/hiclasic.rm
http://www.rozhlas.cz/audio/download/cro3_lowmp3.m3u
http://129.237.213.240/ramgen/kanu/kanu.smil

I'd make the effort to fix whatever is causing it not to find the audio
system if it could do what I want. Is there a way to create a playlist
in Mplayer that contains radio station links like the above? Can I make
the video window go away so all I have is the little control panel?

Subject: [PLUG] using PuTTY for remote execution with VMWare Win2K
Message-ID: <20071126003724.GA11193@gate.kl-ic.com>


Not a question, but a mini-howto:

I am in the process of porting some CAD programs from windoze to linux.
I am also using the programs in Win2K (running under VMWare) until the
port is complete.  Part of the usage involves automating tasks, and I
want to call some Perl programs from a .BAT script in Win2K.  However,
I don't want to go to all the effort of setting up and maintaining
Perl in Win2K, since I have a perfectly adequate Perl setup under
linux, and all the windoze-side files are shared with Samba, so I can
work on them from the linux side.

PuTTY and SSH execution to the rescue.  PuTTY is a free SSH clone that
runs under windoze.  I can execute a command in on the linux VMWare
host by putting the command line in a windoze-side file, then telling
Putty to execute the file with:

w:\putty\putty.exe keithl at hostcmptr -m w:\path\to\commandfile

where w: is my windoze/samba share, hostcmptr is the host machine, and
command file contains a linux command, such as " ~/bin/do_something "
PuTTY will normally ask for my linux host password;  instead, I set up
a public/private key pair with the program puttygen, saved the private
key with a passphrase in the w:\putty directory, and saved the public
key in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 on the linux host.  I put a shortcut to
the program w:\putty\pageant.exe in the windoze startup folder, so that
pageant starts up with Win2K and asks for the private key passphrase,
once during startup.  Pageant then supplies the private key to PuTTY
whenever PuTTY is called.  Now I can automate the whole thing.

This will do until I get the programs ported;  in particular, I can
move the programs in the BAT script over to the linux side one at a
time until they are all ported, then abandon windoze entirely.  Oh,
happy day.

There may be another way to do remote execution with Samba, but I don't
know how.  Polling files on both sides would mean writing a program on
the windoze side to delay execution until the linux side was finished -
but I'm doing this to AVOID writing programs for windoze.  If you have
a tested technique that uses existing Samba tools, and no other
windoze-side executables, I would like to hear about it.

Nah, these are packages.  But they are gentoo packages, not ubuntu
ones.  Ubuntu may or may not have analogs.  I have never used ubuntu,

There is another thing to check: the kernel.  ALSA kernel support
inclues a config option for OSS emulation.  Thia may be important.
Look for any loaded (or otherwise) kernel modules with "oss" in the
name:

lsmod |grep oss (these are loaded)
or 
find /lib/modules/`uname -r` -type f -iname '*oss*.ko' (these may or
may not be loaded; check with lsmod)

The basics of mplayer are fairly straightforward. The manpage makes
things look a lot scarier than they are because, well... it's a
manpage. There's a lot of stuff in there about codecs, filters, etc.
that can be safely ignored.

mplayer is as much about audio as it is video. It has a nifty bag of
tricks that are worth learning if you ever find yourself needing to
transcode one format to another, rip audio out of a video track, etc.

"mplayer happyfunmusic.mp3" is about as simple as it gets.

mplayer has to be told that you're feeding it a playlist, as opposed
to a file:

  mplayer http://shoutcast.omroep.nl:8148/listen.pls

It handled all of your streams just fine, but couldn't actually play
two of them (radiocult.asx, CatalunyaMusic.ram) due to codec issues
(namely, lack of support for newer Windows-y stuff). The others came
through great.

I've never bothered with the mplayer GUI, but the command-line version
has no support for creating playlists. It's designed for playback (and
transcoding), not collection management.

> Can I make the video window go away so all I have is the little
> control panel?

If you're playing a video via command-line mplayer and only want the
audio, you can always

  mplayer -vo null happyfunvideo.avi

to have the video omitted, and playback audio only. If the file has no
video track, the command-line version won't open a video window.

It works in Windows XP, but I can't save games if I'm a non  
administrative user...

Anyone know a way around this that doesn't involve installing XP to a fat
file system?

I'm surprised Microsoft didn't design a way into XP to allow games that want
to save in the wrong place to do so.  This no saving to the program folders
business breaks a heck of a lot of software.

I wonder how the ReactOS system will handle this problem?  Warcraft II BNE is
technically an NT 4.0 compatible program.  NT 4.0 has NTFS, albeit an older
version of it than XP does.  I doubt you can save as a non administrative
user on an NT 4.0 system, though I could be wrong.

It's too bad that old dos games which won't run in ordinary dos are  
without a currrently supported system.  Wine doesn't run Warcraft II  
BNE and I highly
doubt that dosbox will.  Plain old dos isn't listed as a supported system.
Actually, the game will run in wine, but so slowly that there's no way you
can play it.  Too bad I can't legally recompile this program to run natively
on Linux.  I know there was an attempt to fascilitate that called freecraft,
but that project got crushed.  Why did Exult suceeded where freecraft failed?

Thanks again fror the suggestions. Here is what I got:

jjj at Devil7:~$ lsmod |grep oss 
snd_pcm_oss			50048	0 
snd_mixer_oss		20096	4 snd_pcm_oss

/lib/modules/2.6.22-14-generic/kernel/drivers/scsi/osst.ko

Sadly I have no ken of what that means, except that apparently a bunch of OSS stuff is installed. I note even more things in Synaptic. For example, I found (and installed) oss-compat and alsa-oss. They didn't make any difference, however.

Meantime, after much poking around I finally got Amarok to play sounds. (Another program with too many features.) It handles a lot of the streaming radio that other players cannot. However, it can't play everything, and several streams give me something that sounds like a card being thlupped by bicycle spokes. Plus its interface is annoying.

I understand now how my parents felt when, as a teenager, I tried to explain to them the marvels of surround sound. Their idea of playing music was to turn on a radio. A radio had an on/off/volume knob on one end, a tuning knob on the other, and a station dial in between. Now, like them back then, I am being dragged into higher tech than I want to know anything about. However, I do eventually want to be able to listen to streaming internet radio on my home sound system. I want to do this because the quality of local broadcast radio has dropped to vomitous levels. My plan is to broadcast to the sound system from the computer via bluetooth. I have a home sound system bluetooth receiver on order. So I guess I have to steel myself and learn about music playback in the new millennium.

I tried opening a radio station from Open URL, but it said it could not

Well, collection management is pretty critical. I don't need a fancy
collection management utility, just someplace where I can save the
radio station URLs and click on them to open them. Typing or even
copying and pasting, is tedious.

I did get Mplayer to play MP3s, but for internet radio I don't think it
is the tool I need.

You just need to find out where it's saving the games, and give write 
permissions for your limited user account (or Everyone group) to that 
folder.  This part must be done as an Administrator though.

As mentioned above, MS does provide a way.  That game is probably old or 
wasn't coded properly for multi-user environments.

Enter VMware, then dust off an old MS OS that does support your game.

I'm sure there would be a lot more to it than recompiling.

Keith,

   This was no groklaw.net, too. Apparently the OS is provided by Linspire,
one of those "linux" distributors who signed up for Microsoft's protection
scheme, so it's not considered true linux. You do not get the source code --
even if you ask -- and there are changes made that make it incompatible with
other linux distributions. You're locked in to them. There's more but I
don't recall all of it. And, I'll bet you thought that protection rackets
were declared illegal years ago.

   Instead of this rip-off, why not get the $188 two-for-one OLPC box? By one
and another will be sent to a kid in some third-world country.

That may have been the case earlier, but I suspect the article is 
referring to this machine, which comes with Ubuntu.

Heh.  If it doesn't buy ads in the paper, it doesn't have a name.

Hm?  I don't understand how a Linux distro could not be "true".  Can you
expand on that?

Really?  Not like Astaro, who merely makes it as difficult and expensive

I think that's true for all distros, to some extent.  Isn't it based on
Debian, like Ubuntu?

No racket ever goes out of style.  That said, I don't understand how
vendor lock-in equates to a protection racket.  (MS Office encryption,
especially coupled with TPM, on the other hand...)

Yup, Ubuntu, not Linspire.  Got a gPC from Wal-Mart.  Meets my
expectations.  Here's a hardware listing using lshw:

http://groups.google.com/group/cwelug/msg/643c6bf8d5fdae6c

Works great for its intended use: browsing the web over DSL and playing DVDs.

Naturally, I cloned the drive: gOS works fine on my other old
machines.  I also repartitioned the drive to make it dual boot: runs
standard Ubuntu 7.10 just fine.  It's not blazingly fast performance,
but it's decent.

Other tweaks:
 - apt-get works
 - installed apache2
 - installed openssh-server

What would be cool would be to install an RDP server on it so that
Windows users can connect to it with their Remote Desktop Connection
client.

Regards,

   That's impressive, Robert, and a great bargain for meeting your needs.

Subject: [PLUG] VLC Expert Needed
Message-ID: <20071126112121.e7fd1df7.johnxj@comcast.net>

In my continuing quest find something that will play radio streams as
well as MP3s, I have spent a couple hours with VLC. It may turn out to
be the best solution, that is, if I can keep it from crashing and if I
can figure some things out.

1) <general rant> It is acronym city. Go into Preferences and just
about every choice is an acronym. I don't know what any of them stand
for, and even if I did I still probably wouldn't know what it does.

2) It plays my MP3s just fine, although you have to click four times to
get it to display the list. It can't seem to remember the folder where
it found them the last time.

3) Evidently you can create a playlist, but you just about have to
create it manually in something like Gedit. Here is a sample of what I
created for streaming radio:

[playlist]
NumberOfEntries=17
File1=http://home.themaestro.net/3mbs.asx
Title1=Melbourne MB3
File2=http://www.quicknet.com.au/netshow/4mbs.asx
Title2=Brisbane MB4

I added 17 items by copying and pasting URLs from publicradiofan.com
and manually typing the titles. There are about a hundred stations I am
insterested in, but I started with just the 17 because I wanted to
choose various kinds of streams. As far as I know .asx is a Windows
Media Player format. Others that I added included .rm, ram, m3u, .smil
and .pls. That is the URLs ended in those extensions. I think .rm
and .ram are Real Media formats, and .m3u and .pls are some kind of
playlist format.

VLC happily opened my playlist file, and actually plays some of them.
However, when I try to play one of the .asx streams VLC's playlist
window shows that it is adding files (lower left corner). It does this
for hundreds, sometimes many thousands of files. If I wait until it
finishes (which may be a long time) I note a long list of files under
the heading for the stream. In one case they all ended in .MP3. It
appears that VLC might be going out to the station and downloading a
link to every piece of music that station ever played. Except that
can't be completely right because for some stations it appears to
download the same link several thousand times, while for others each
link is different. For the .asx streams it finally goes ahead and plays
the stream once it finishes downloading all the links (or whatever
these things are). That may be five minutes later. 

"OK," I thought. "I'll just delete these entries." Hah! You can select
them all, but when you click on Delete it will delete only one at a
time. That is, one click for each of tens of thousands of entries. I
should add that it occurs to me that giving the listener links to the
music must be illegal. And I did delete all the entries for one station
that had only a couple hundred listed. The station still played fine.
But when I shut down VLC and relaunched it, then opened the playlist
file again, it had to go through the search all over again before it
would start playing the station.

It won't play any of the streams ending in .pls, .rm or .m3u. No error
message; it just goes on to the next entry. And that's another thing I
need to fix. I don't want it to go immediately on to the next entry. I
want it to play an item I select and then stop. I searched through all
the acronyms in Preferences, but I couldn't find any way to stop this
behavior. I probably didn't know the acronym for it. And might there be
a plugin I need for the .rm, .ram and .m3u streams?

Or is VLC the wrong tool for playing internet radio? Should I just give
up on it?

.asx, .m3u, .pls, .smil, .ram are all playlists (or redirects, which
serve a similar purpose). They point your player to the real source of
the audio stream. Internet radio stations do this because they rarely
have only one server handling their stream. When VLC opens one of
those playlists, it adds each entry to its current playlist, as if you
had wanted to merge them all. You didn't, but that's life. VLC isn't
the only player with that behavior.

Thanks for the explanation. I guess VLC is not the right tool for me.

I also guess I'm going to have to go out and learn how each of these formats works.

I think you have a misunderstanding of how an access point is supposed
to work.  Unless there is a wire between the wireless access points,
they won't work together.  Unless they are doing WDS or something
similar, which these clearly are not.

First, *always* download and upgrade your routers to the very latest
firmware.  The Belkin's latest firmware is here:

The D-Link's latest firmware is here:
http://support.dlink.com/products/view.asp?productid=DI%2D524%5FrevC

For the Belkin, log in, and under the Under Wireless > Wireless bridge
section, configure as follows:
* Check the "Enable Wireless Bridging" checkbox
* Check the "Enable ONLY specific Access Points to connect" checkbox
* Enter the WAN MAC Address of the D-Link -- look on the D-Link box
itself (usually on the bottom) or, if logged in, under the Status tab
* Enter WAN MAC Addresses of up to three other wireless Access Points
* Do not check the "Disable ability for Wireless CLIENTS to connect" checkbox

For the D-Link, you may have trouble converting it into an access
point.  Best guess is to log in and ensure the following
configuration:
* Setup static WAN IP (Home tab; WAN button) and set the IP address to
anything you want -- it won't be used
* Setup LAN IP address (Home tab; LAN button) to 192.168.2.???
* Disable DHCP (Home tab; DHCP button) -- your Cisco DSL router should
be the only DHCP server

Have read somewhere that the D-Link will act as an Access Point under
these circumstances -- YMMV.

Would also recommend getting a second Belkin, if you can, especially
if things don't work out and for the following reasons: 1) It's
usually easier to setup WiFI when using the same brand. 2) The D-Link
you have supports only WEP -- which forces you to use the same on the
Belkin.  A more secure solution would be to use WPA.

DISCLAIMER: I don't know what I'm doing.  Don't follow my advice.
You're on your own.  Your mileage may vary.

Subject: [PLUG] Screenshot builder for Linux
Message-ID: <c834ec80711261621m775c5f97l41f5a9aa9e3ee640@mail.gmail.com>

I'm often in the situation where I need to put together some realistic
screenshots very quickly, just to have a graphic that can be easily
manipulated when working through UI itterations for an app.  Often
we'll go through 20-30 variations on a UI in a week, and the start-up
time for the first batch is usually a couple hours.  So for, the only
application we've found capable of doing this is Visio.

For those of you not familiar with this use of Visio -- it provides a
pretty complete set of MS windowing controls (buttons, text areas,
sliders, etc.) that can be moved around and adjusted more or less as
you would expect them to.  It's a bit like a vector graphics tool
merged with a visual interface builder like Glade, but without the
pedantic attitude needed when building *real* UIs.  Visio doesn't care
if widgets overlap or don't resize, or... it just lets you slap them
down where ever, and you can export the result as an image for use in
presentations / "paper" prototypes / etc.  It's extremely useful.  But
it only runs in windows.

Is anyone aware of an app that runs natively under linux and would
fill this need?  Glade would almost work, but it is really to rigid --
it's very handy to just throw an arbitrary image into a ui and build
from that (eg: take a screenshot of an existing app, like word, and
add on the components to give it additional functionality -- like a
new toolbar, for instance.).  This is also very useful when you're
working with HTML and your widgets can look like anything, or if
you're just not using a "normal" widget toolkit.

Searching for visio linux apps returns an armfull of vector drawing
apps (like kivio, xfig, inkscape and dia), and some of those would
probably work if there were sufficient stencil sets available,
unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case.

Does anyone have suggestions?

Thanks,
Rogan

I found the same limitation. I was told by a professor that Visio was
what he used for drawing x-bar syntax trees. I tried kivio and
discovered that I could not create a custom stencil set, nor could I
customize an existing stencil set. I ended up doing it laboriously in
OOo (which is what I still use). But OOo won't do what you need.

All I can suggest is that, as far as I know, Visio will run under Wine,
so at least you wouldn't have to switch computers or dual boot.

Aha!  The Belkin *does* do a bridge mode.  My brief googling of the
product descriptions didn't turn that up.  According to this:

  <http://www.belkin.com/support/article/?lid=en&pid=f5d7230-4&aid=5130&scid=0&fid=1258&fn=wireless%20bridge.pdf>

   What is a Wireless Bridge?

   A wireless bridge is actually a "mode" in which your Wireless
   Router can directly connect to a secondary Wireless Access
   Point. Note that you can only bridge your 54g Wireless Router
   (Model F5D7230-4) to a Belkin 54g Wireless Access Point (model
   F5D7130). Bridging with other brands of Access Points is not
   supported at this time. [...] 

I don't necessarily believe everything I read, but, thanks Jon for the
correction!  Page 3 of the PDF seems to show that the device supports
WDS with firmware Version 1.01.08 or higher.

No wifi.  Not even under XP (where at least I can see the wifi card, but

No bluetooth.  dmesg says it's configured, but I can't make the little

non-software related, but lspci also claims I have a 4-in-1 flash card

Message-ID: <d0ad9b7e0711270723m3339ff8fpeb219ec9a3590685@mail.gmail.com>

I've got a Japanese language course on 12 CDs I want to rip to mp3. On
Mac, all the mp3 info is perfect, but the CD drive is very slow and
unable to read the scratched disks, so hangs. On Linux, ripping flies,
but the mp3 info is very incomplete.

The core issue with these language courses is you want the tracks to
play in order on your mp3 device automatically, which I assume means
the track info has to be stored in the mp3 info, but not completely
sure, it might be based on the stored title.

So, anyone know of good Linux ripping software that does as good a job
at creating mp3 info as iTunes?

I think it is correct to say that an iPod goes entirely off the ID3
tag of the .mp3, completely disregarding the name.  What you need is
an ID3 editing program.  There are lots of those.  I've never used any
of them.  My helpfulness ends here.

Grip which is a gnome front end to lame  should be able to accomplish what
you want. You can configure how the files are named as well as ID3
attributes. If the CD's are listed in CDDB it'll auto fill most of it not
all the information for you automagically otherwise you'll be stuck naming
the files and ID3 information yourself though.

I did look at those, but thank you very much.

One claims that the wifi and bluetooth lights never light up under Linux. 
I read (perhaps incorrectly) that my bios revision would fix that, but 
maybe that's not the case.  So I probably just need to bust out a 
bluetooth device and give that a test.

The wifi, however, doesn't quite do what I want it to do.  I can build the 
madwifi module as stated and insert it into the kernel with no errors. 
dmesg tells me that the driver has loaded, but no wifi ethernet adapters 
show in ifconfig.  So what's missing?

As for sound, I may well have to patch the alsa as stated.  It's 
frustrating that all of this stuff is supported in CURRENT development 
versions of the kernel/ALSA and still not accessible running Debian 
unstable.  Grr.  Of course, I'm not patient enough to just shelve the 
thing until after Christmas when the release cycles come 'round.

So... still hunting for ideas.

Just a shot in the dark here, as I have no real hands
on experience with the t61 in question...

My t42 has a control button that seems to work no
matter which OS I am running, which turns the wireless
and bluetooth on and off.  For me its Function key +
F5.  Might it be something like that?

I have a T61.

I recently gave up on Gutsy with my Intel 3945.  Either the firmware coming from
Intel is crappy, or NetworkManager has taken a step backwards; I would get
30-120 minutes of use before I would have to reboot to get wifi working again.
I broke down and grabbed a spare Linksys PCCard running with a bcm43xx driver.

Sound was broken with my T61 and Feisty.  Since Gutsy sound works, but the
volume buttons seem to control the microphone level. :)  Here's wishing I could
upgrade a T43 to a kvm capable multi-core processor.

They, the ripping programs, are all driven by front ends.  Choose a front end (I
use K3B) that allows you to customize the mp3 filename and include the track
number in the name.

That will handle your sequencing issue.

As to pulling the id3 information, to fulfill your request of "being like iTunes"
you'll need to subscribe to GraceNoteDB and use it instead of freecddb.

As others suggested a tag editing program will do a lot to address your needs. 
I've never found one to be significantly better overall than another.  They just
trade off how well they work for your situation.

Indeed. I bought my T61 from a local dealer on a Saturday, and waited until our local Linux user group's monthly Linux Clinic on the followng Sunday to install Linux on it. I started with a fresh Gutsy x86_64 DVD that I had burned previously. The first thing I did was wipe out the NTFS and FAT32 partitions and install Gutsy. Everything was recognized and worked perfectly, except the wireless and the bluetooth. Those two lights never came on. The local Linux gurus (several of whom have T43s) scratched their heads. After about 20 minutes of installing this, reinstalling that, one of them noticed that the switch on the front of the machine was not on. We turned it on, the bluetooth light came on, and wireless worked. Duh!

Having said that, I later discovered a problem with the wireless. It works great when it works, but I get suddenly disconnected. It's as though the connection to the antenna was intermittent, or the local provider was pulling the switch. This will happen anywhere from immediately after booting to an hour after being online. At first I was afraid I was going to have to send the machine in for repair, but then I discovered others with the same problem. One place it has been discussed is here:

http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=3839319&highlight=T61+wireless#post3839319

And if you search on Ubuntu forums (Advanced search) for keywords "T61" and "wireless" you will get several additional threads. Evidently the problem is the Intel driver, which Intel knows about and is apparently trying to resolve.

Regarding bluetooth, that is working flawlessly. I am now using a Logitech V270 bluetooth mouse. I was completely new to bluetooth so I had to google for a bit to educate myself. Ultimately I discovered Blueman (sorry, didn't bookmark the link). It is not in the Ubuntu repositories, but you can download either a .deb or .rpm and install with whatever installer you prefer. It is the missing bluetooth utiity that Linux has been needing. I just turned on the mouse, hit the Scan button in Blueman, and it found the mouse. Then I clicked on Bond, Blueman popped up a window asking for the key, I entered 0000, and Blueman paired it right up. Ever since it "just works." I reboot the computer and there it is.

I also bought a pair of Sony DR-BT50 headphones. These are serious audiophile bluetooth headphones. Again, Blueman paired them up with the same ease as it did the mouse. All I have to do is turn them on before launching a multimedia app and the sound comes out of the headphones instead of the speakers or the headphone jack. That is, every app except RealPlayer. Of course, RealPlayer is the one app I really need, dammit. But that's a problem with Helix, not the bluetooth driver or ALSA. 

And regarding Alsamixer, I know little of its settings, but there are some configurations in Preferences or Settings or something where you can enable more stuff. And in my efforts to get RealPlayer working with bluetooth I have scoured Synaptic searching on "sound" and similar keywords. I note there are a lot of additional utilities. Perhaps you don't have all of the right ones installed.

I can't offer any suggestions at all about the card reader. I have no devices that use the card reader, so I have never looked at it. I don't know if mine is working or not.

A friend in our local LUG also recently bought a T61 and reported that he has the finger thingy working. I never bothered.

There is a problem (a bug report filed some time ago) with the USB ports on the right rear corner. They work fine when you first boot, but if you ever remove a device from either one of them, they both die. The one in the middle of the left side works perfectly, however. And I bought a docking station that has four USB ports in the back. They all work perfectly.

There was a problem at first with the volume controls. Flashing the BIOS to the latest (a couple weeks ago) fixed them. However, even after flashing the BIOS, I thought they were not working. That was because I did not understand how they worked. I assumed the mute button (on the left) was a toggle. But it does not unmute the sound if you are muted. It is only a mute button. Once you are muted you unmute by pressing the volume up button. It would be nice if it had occurred to Lenovo to include a little user guide with this thing.

Brightness (Fn+Home and Fn+Ed) do not work at all. I don't know of anyone who has gotten them working with Ubuntu. I have read that they do work in Linux if you shell out to a command line first (Ctrl-Alt-F1), but then you can't see what it is doing. And even that didn't work for me. Luckily, I don't really care. The screen is permanently on its brightest setting, and that is where I want it.

I haven't tried any of the other Fn or special buttons. I've pressed the thinkVantage key now and then, but it appears dead. But then, since there is no user guide, I don't know what it's supposed to do. Except I did discover that it gets me into the BIOS during the initial boot process. Once Ubuntu is up, it does nothing.

I'm not very good at Linux, so I probably can't offer much in the way of troubleshooting advice. But at least I can relate my experience so everyone knows that it is possible to get some of this stuff working.

And, as Carlos pointed out, there a tons of ID3 editing tools. My fave
is Easytag, only because I know where all the buttons are and what they
do. There are also command line utilities. 

For ripping, I use cdparanoia and lame from the command line.

Unfortunately Dia suffers from the same problem as kivio -- it would
probably work if there were a good set of UI widget stencils, but I've
been unable to find one.  (kivio's stencil set is actually a superset
of the Dia stencils, since kivio can read the dia format.)

Rogan,

   It's been quite a while since I looked at the 17 or so vector drawing
programs for linux, but I have a vague recollection of being able to develop
custom widget sets in Dia. Take a look at this to see if it helps you:

Ah.. that page seems to address getting new sheets into the dia
distribution, but it did turn me on to some new keywords, resulting in
this link:

http://www.togaware.com/linux/survivor/Walkthrough_Creating0.html

which gives a short tutorial for creating custom shapes, so there is
hope.  I'll take a more in-depth look at it as I have time.  It may be
possible to start up a small project to create some screenshot mockup
sheets afterall :)  (although getting the svg to scale properly for
more complex widgets is probably non-trivial... anyone else interested
in helping make shapes?)

http://www.thekompany.com/ has custom shapes for kivio, but none for UI
design.

You could always try using the Glade Interface designer.

   IIRC, Glade allows saving in .xml. And, I believe that Dia can read .xml
files -- or can be made to do so with a python script.

I've tried Glade.  It's to pedantic (with good reason -- it's meant to
build something far more complex than a screenshot), but if I didn't
have vmware running with Visio, then I would probably be using a
mixture of Glade, Inkscape and the Gimp.

Hm... I've trained myself to ignore the string "xml" most of the time,
since virtually anything can write data in xml and it's rare that the
xml schemas are compatible.  Often knowing that an application will
write to xml is no more useful than knowing that it will write to
disk.  This might provide a good shortcut for generating the Dia
shapes & sheets though.

I'd be interested in learning how to make shapes but the shapes I want
are definitely not the shapes anyone else wants. (Don't think about
that sentence too much.) I want shapes that llok like ^, where I can
have branching nodes underneath, and text under the nodes. However, I
also need to write text, as with a word processor including UTF-8
characters. I'm not sure if Kivio or Dia would be up to the text part.

   If you're diagraming sentences (or linguistics), take a look at graphviz.
It may be the perfect tool for that.

According to Real's Helix website, their player doesn't support ALSA
or ESD, but it does support OSS:

https://player.helixcommunity.org/2007/releases/rp10gold/RP10_0_9ReleaseNotes.html

This is most likely why Real's audio output is different from the
other players you've tried.  The alsa-oss package in Synaptic provides
ALSA with an OSS compatibility layer.  This should give applications
that only understand OSS the ability to play through your ALSA system.
 Now that you have that installed, there should be some way to get
Real player to work... though if you've tried this hard for this long
it may be more trouble than it's worth.

According to Totem's home page, it supports several playlist formats.
If it does everything else you need, it sounds to me like figuring out
how to get Totem to work with playlists is your best bet.

I used to do this quite a bit until I got the MPlayer browser plug-in
working.  Have you tried it?

# emerge -av mplayerplug-in

It's got scads of USE flags, including options for Real, WMP, and
Quicktime.  It works for me, but I haven't made the jump to 64 bit.
There's a (possibly outdated) Howto for it on the Gentoo wiki.

A radio had an on/off/volume knob on one end, a tuning knob on the other, and a station dial in between. Now, like them back then, I am being dragged into higher tech than I want to know anything about. However, I do eventually want to be able to listen to streaming internet radio on my home sound system. I want to do this because the quality of local broadcast radio has dropped to vomitous levels. My plan is to broadcast to the sound system from the computer via bluetooth. I have a home sound system bluetooth receiver on order. So I guess I have to steel myself and learn about music playback in the new millennium.

Great idea, but have you actually tried to use the keyboard on an XO?
They're really made for children's fingers.

Actually, thanks for bringing that up. I've been meaning to post about 
the XO (OLPC) machine here. I'm seriously considering getting one, but 
if, as you say, the keyboard is not suitable for an adult, I probably 
won't. Does anyone on the list have one?

I'm going to place an order on December 10th, if no one has one to play
with before then.

I went ahead and sent off for one. If I can't type on it, I'll find 
someone who can. ;) I had an HP-100LX Palmtop PC and the keyboard wasn't 
as much of an impediment to use as the tiny screen was.

Seriously, though, I did look at the ASUS Eee (of which Amazon has none 
in stock) and the Nokia N800. I went with the XO because it looks like 
it has the best screen of the bunch and the best power consumption 
footprint. There's also a year of T-mobile free thrown in on the XO, and 
the XO software looks a *lot* cooler than the ASUS.

So ... time to learn Python. ;)

A linguistics student friend of mine (uses Linux on her sub-notebook)
will be getting one for Xmas. Her husband's order was one of the first,
so it should be here by Xmas. I will be getting a close look at iit at
a linguistics meeting January 4.

Meantime, although we had an awesome discussion of the project by
students from OSU at one of our monthly meetings (one of the meetings
that stands out in my mind as one of the best we ever had), I would
welcome an update.

Subject: [PLUG] Cheap and reliable wireless card
Message-ID: <20071128212919.5d9038e2.johnxj@comcast.net>

There is a problem with my new Lenovo T61 and its Intel 4965AGN
wireless chip. It works beautifully when it works, but anywhere from a
few minutes to an hour or so after connecting to a wireless network, I
will suddenly lose my DHCP lease. (At least, I think that is what is
happening.) Thereafter there is no hope of going anywhere on the net.
Everything says I am still connected, but I can't go anywhere.
Rebooting is the only repair option that I have found. Sometimes even
rebooting does not get me back online. In one instance I had to disable
the radio in the BIOS, boot, restart, enable the radio in the BIOS, and
then reboot again in order to get it working.

According to posts in the Ubuntu forums Intel is furiously working on
updates to the driver to resolve the problem. In fact, I have also
found posts on the net from Vista users relating the same issue. In the
meantime, I don't want to futz with this any further. I thought of
trying ndiswrapper and the Windows driver, but I'd rather just buy a
cheap PCMCIA wireless card that works. However, I want to pay the least
amount possible because, as soon as Intel finally fixes the driver, it
will become surplus. (And to be donated to the Clinic or something.) I
know there are a number of people here who use PCMCIA wireless cards.
My OS is Gutsy x86_64. Can someone suggest a cheap card that works?

/me glances at his T9 cell phone
/me glances at an iPhone "keyboard"
/me glances at his stack of keyboards, rotated to put the keys in  
different places, to defeat RSI and CTS

<cheeky>
...Uhm, yeah.
The 20th century called, they want their "full sized touch-typing  
QWERTY" keyboards back. ;)
</cheeky>

Let's review:
1. Mechanical latin-variant keys muck each other up. Thus, make  
typing slower/less muckish by separating lever spaces.
2. Huge keyboards for assembling complicated glyphs are created for,  
uhm, languages with complicated glyphs. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ 
Image:Large_chinese_keyboard.jpg>
3. World tries to standardize, and fails spectacularly, creating more  
standards than existing spoken/written languages.
4. Computers happen, the keyboard is no longer stupid about  
predicting the next character/signal.
5. World tries to standardize, and fails spectacularly, creating more  
standards than existing spoken/written languages.
6. Devices become smaller, faster, smarter, start predicting glyphs,  
and intended words/phrases. They start with "chicklets", move to "tic- 
tacs", and now, after a hundred years or so, are shedding the silly  
idea that communication ever had anything to do with the actual  
glyphs used in the first place...

:) <---prime example. Colon glyph followed by a closing parenthesis  
glyph. I can make this glyph-set in one hand motion, with two right- 
hand fingers (making eyes), and a right-hand middle finger sweeping  
the "smile". With a qwerty keyboard, I require shift-; <to get ':'>,  
and a shift-0 <to get ')'>, two hand motions.

Depending on my entry system, I may, or may not, require more  
keystrokes, or more precise aiming at (for my generation) tiny keys,  
but having seen a sysadmin config a new Cisco BGP edge router from a  
cell-phone, I'm pretty sure that the question is not one of "adult  
keyboards", but, rather, individual adaptations and effectiveness in  
using new input systems.

I just downloaded the VMware image and brought it up. It turns out to be 
a 2.6.23 kernel, and most of the RPMs look like FC7 or later. The native 
flash "hard drive" is only 1 GB and the image I downloaded only had 
about 8 percent free, so if you're going to add core software, you'll 
probably need to uninstall some. I'm planning to get an offboard 4 GB 
RAM disk and mount it as /usr/znmeb or something, and load additional 
software on it that way.

Alt-O brings up something called the "Developer Console", which includes 
a "terminal tab" so you have a bash prompt. There's another way to get a 
command prompt, and Ctl-Alt-F1 works on the hardware. On VMware, it 
drops you to the *host* console, though. :(.

So ... it's hackable at the software level. The built in software 
includes something called Etoys, which is Squeak, although I'm not sure 
how much of Squeak is there. There are a couple of synthesizers and the 
high-end one looks pretty good. Once you add some offboard disk space, 
you should be able to run anything that will work in 256 MB of RAM on a 
433 MHz x86.

Actually, it doesn't seem dissimilar from prolog ;)

In other news.. I too have been seriously debating the XO, and I go
back and forth on a daily basis.  What I really would like to find is
essentially a Lonovo X-series tablet with a docking station that
includes an extra hd, PCIe video, and optical device.  Has anyone
heard of such a beast? (Tablet portion optional -- basically I have
need of an ultra-portable with fast video and multi-monitor
capabilities when I'm home.)

The XO looks like an awesome travel laptop though.

I know I'm probably preaching to the choir, but have you tried Free
Geek? This seems like something you could get dirt cheap from their
store, and have a place to return it later.w

The Orinoco Gold cards used to work wonderfully, if you can find one of them.

In case you wanted to keep the WiFi inside and still on the cheap:

Something to consider anyway.  These things are usually very accessible 
and easy to swap out.

I just did a show for labwithleo.com yesterday on this, so I've researched
it a bit.

The Squeak Etoys image is available for download at
<http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Etoys>.  It's a complete "base" image with a few
additional packages to deal with "Sugar", the OLPC O/S, and a nice startup
screen to send you to some preloaded Etoys packages.  It's quite usable with a
normal Squeak VM though... you can get one for Linux from www.squeakland.org.

I find this really cool... etoys is like "electronic Lego", using tile-based
programming to effectively write the underlying smalltalk classes and
methods. As part of my 5-minute demo on the TV show, I "drew" a car, animated
it to go in a circle, then "drew" a steering wheel and hooked it up to steer
the car.  If you have a child that is looking at programming, the OLPC Etoys
preload is very very very cool and fun.  Heck, even Leo Laporte said he was
going to start playing with it again.  And once you get beyond the great
stuff you can do with tiles, you can start "peering under the hood", and
use it as a stepping stone to learn real Smalltalk(tm).

The wikipedia article on PCIe has some information on External PCI 
Express.  The info in the article says that there currently are no 
products that support external PCIe with bandwidths above that of a x1 
slot.

Thanks to all for the offers and suggestions. It did not occur to me to
try Free Geek. Brain not functioning up to specs, I guess. I will go
there tomorrow, computer mit, and see what they have.

I'm underwhelmed by the full Squeak. I've tried to like it a couple of 
times, bought both commonly-available books on the subject, etc. I have 
a couple of problems with it.

1. The UI is totally orthogonal to all the habits I've acquired over the 
past few years. I'm used to "right-click menus", among other things.

2. Everything stays as you left it. If you move something, erase 
something, change something, there's not a convenient "undo".

3. It's layers and layers of some other peoples' idea of what a computer 
should be like. It may be intuitive for the people that designed it, but 
it isn't to me.

I downloaded a VMware image of a recent OLPC last night and did a little 
playing with Sugar (the main UI) and eToys. First of all, I *like* 
Sugar. It's very much like the HP-100LX, the advanced TI calcularots, 
most palmtop PC UIs and other "instant-on" PCs I've worked with. You 
basically open up an "activity" and it stays open. If you run out of 
RAM, you remove an activity to make room for it.

eToys, on the other hand, is just as annoying to me as Squeak, although 
there is a lot less clutter on the desktop when it first comes up than 
there is on a full Squeak.

But what I *really* like about the machine is the synthesizer. It looks 
like it has pretty much all of CSound built in.

According to the most recent spec, there are three USB ports and an SD 
slot. It looks like the preferred maintenance toolset is to boot update 
media off a USB device, which means that it can boot USB devices. :) It 
does not have a wired NIC as far as I can tell, just wireless. Since I 
don't have a wireless router, I'll probably get a USB NIC for using it 
at home. I know ... wireless routers are cheap. :)

I don't think the XO is really appropriate for "business travel" usage. 
If you have enough external storage, you can load anything that will run 
on Fedora Core 7 / x86 and use it, but that's really counter to the 
philosophy of the device. The ASUS Eee (if they are actually available) 
is more like a "real adult computer" and has a similar low-power 
footprint (and more RAM).

I decided to create a Google group for Portland area XO (OLPC laptop) 
"users." I define a user as anyone who has signed up for the Give One 
Get One program or is thinking about doing so, or is just interested in 
downloading the image and exploring the software on a virtual machine. 
If you're interested, the group is

http://groups.google.com/group/pdx-olpc-users/

Apologies if there's already a similar group -- please let me know and 
I'll be happy to merge with them.

I guess it depends on your business ;) Neither the Eee or the XO will
work for my daily use, and the XO has some very tangible benefits over
the Eee.  ~3x the batter life, more rugged exterior, better wifi
antennae, and some really cool recharging options.  (does anyone know
if the footpedal / pull cord / solar panel will be made available to
us?)

The question that I'm up against is whether I'll need a new "real
adult computer" in the near future or not.  If I do, then I probably
shouldn't be dropping $400 on something that's solely for travel.

The FAQ on the web site indicated that none of these options would be 
shipped with the "Get One" part of the package. In fact, it's not clear 
which of these are actually operational at the moment. The "Get One" 
ships with an AC power cord.

I don't travel enough to justify a new laptop. I took my ancient Compaq 
Presario 2110US with me to RubyConf, praying that it would survive. It 
did -- it does. The only thing wrong with it is a bent PCMCIA pin, and 
I've got USB adapters for everything that's not built in.

I'm pretty down on regular laptops at the moment. I'd have to be on the 
road at least 50 percent on paid business to justify anything bigger 
than a fancy cell phone/PDA. If your business can be run with only one 
computer, sure, get a laptop. But once you're into multiple machines, 
full-power "thick client" laptops just don't make any sense to me.

By the way, the XO screen is 1200x900 and has a 200 DPI monochrome mode. 
And the keyboard, while smaller than "normal", is bigger than the 
Toshiba Libretto 70, and I had no problem using that.

Subject: [PLUG] Browser redirection for site testing
Message-ID: <20071130032655.GC14494@gate.kl-ic.com>


I run a few websites on my server.  I like to test them before 
repointing DNS at them.  I am wondering if there is any combination
of stuff I can feed Firefox (or other browsers) to make them ignore
normal DNS and ask for a URL at a different IP address.

An example for clarification.  I own the domain "keithl.com", which
is currently pointed at the IP address 72.249.22.145, along with a
dozen other URLs .  Let's say I start up a new server on IP address
123.45.67.89, and copy the site information to that, and then turn
on Apache.  The new server can respond to requests for all the 
different virtuals, but DNS doesn't point to it yet.  I want to test
keithl.com, and all the other virtuals, before I switch the DNS over.

THE QUESTION:  Is there some way to ask Firefox for, say,
http://123.45.67.89:www.keithl.com/ , so that the browser goes
to the right IP address and Apache gets the right browser information,
as if DNS was actually pointing there? 

Yes, I can fake out the DNS on my own browser machine, but I would
like a technique that I can use on another machine that I do not
control, to make sure the new IP address is reachable before I change
the DNS server to point to it.

Ok...Take 2.

Can't you just add the IP address in your local hosts file and assign it
to the DOMAIN NAME of your choice?

Or am I missing something obvious or not understanding the problem?

How about,

In the VirtualHost stanza of your apache config add a server alias:

<VirtualHost  *:80>
        ServerName testbox.keithl.com
        ServerAlias test.www.keithl.com
    ... other directives
</VirtualHost>

Add test.www.keithl.com to DNS or /etc/hosts and you'll have a fully
functional, just like production, just with different names.

You just need a proxy.  For instance, you have squid on a machine that 
you control and one or more machines are configured to use that as a 
proxy.  Then just just jiggle the DNS or hosts file on the squid box.

But if you're just testing the apache config, use netcat.

  echo 'HEAD / HTTP/1.1
  host: www.keithl.com

  ' | netcat -q 1 123.45.67.89 80

You can also use 'GET' as the request if you recognize your footer.  But 
with HEAD, you should get the '200 OK' and a recognizable last-modified

Read my last paragraph again.  Imagine I want to ask a dozen people to
check the new server for accessability, address blockage, etc.  They
are on Windoze, Macs, Solaris, etc.  They are running Explorer, Opera,
Firefox, and Safari.  They don't have root access.  I would like to give
them some strange redirecting URL so they can see if they can connect
to the new site, WITHOUT changing over the DNS or changing the Apache
config AGAIN after the testing period is over.

Rewriting the Apache config, AND changing the DNS, is changing TWO
things (probably in 3 steps), with errors possible at each step.  I
want to test each step one at a time;  I already know how to do it by
screwing with browser machine /etc/hosts and with server httpd.conf,
and then rescrewing at production switchover.  Three opportunities
for mistakes, and inadequate public testing.

I suspect browsers don't have this kind of "testing" feature.  The
HTTP protocols certainly permit it.  If the browser is equipped to
do so, it can route an HTTP request to machine B with a HTTP header
containing a URL pointing at machine A, thus testing the production
httpd.conf on machine B before DNS switchover.  Testing is less valid
if you are changing multiple things at once, which is why a lot of
software is poorly tested.   

But if browsers DO have this kind of feature, it would mean that there
are at least some "computer scientists" who are actually Scientists, who
understand proper experimental methods, and design proper experimental
tools.  If these rare ducks exist, and they have managed to get such a
feature in some browsers, I would like to know how to access it.

I think Michael Rasmussen suggested the best solution.  If you control
the DNS, point test.keithl.com to 123.45.67.89, and set up the
appropriate VirtualHost config for it.  Then bring up
http://test.keithl.com in a browser.  When you want the new host to go
live, simply change "test" to "www" in the DNS and apache.

If you don't control the DNS or don't want to mess with it's settings,
you should be able to get away with something like this:

<VirtualHost 123.45.67.89>
    DocumentRoot   "/path/to/keithl"
    ...etc...
</VirtualHost>

Then bring up http://123.45.67.89  That ought to work but you'll have
to change more than just "test" to "www" when you go live.

One thing to watch out for is how fully qualified your links are.
Let's say your main page is index.html and it should link to
page2.html.  If the HTML for the link is <a
href="www.keithl.com/page2.html">, it will send viewers back to your
original web site.  If you want to check the links on the test host,
make sure they're in a short form like <a href="/page2.html">.  If
you're not concerned with testing anything other than the main page,
don't worry about it.

If you could use the Palmtop, then you would probably do okay with the
XO. My wife had an old 300LX that I tried to use over the summer when I
was desperate for something that would allow me to write away from my
desk in the basement, but I found it impossible to use. OTOH, I don't
have too many problems with the keyboard on my Treo, but I can't get
anywhere near 40wpm.

The guy in the FSF booth at LISA a couple weeks ago said people who were
hunt-and-peckers usually did fine with it and even some touch-typists
managed to adjust. I tried the model on display and thought I might be
able to adjust, but my forearms are in bad enough shape.

I am seriously considering the Eee, but I am waiting until BestBuy has
them in-stock, so I can actually try the keyboard.

A web proxy is probably the route I would take. It is not particularly
difficult to talk your testers through re-configuring their browsers;
directions for doing so are probably pretty easy to find.

Squid, for example, can be given non-default nameservers and use a hosts
file other than the standard. ('dns_nameservers' and 'hosts_file') The
hosts file is probably the easiest, but you could also test your DNS
changes with split-DNS (such as, for example, queries from the proxy
only getting the new addresses).

"Pound" is also a nice option for a web proxy; it's much simpler than
Squid (although I have never found Squid particularly difficult). If you
wanted ultimate control, of course, you could probably whip together
something with a few modules from CPAN.

I detoured  by Free Geek on the way to school today. The dude behind
the counter said they did not always have them, and this was a time
when they did not. Next stop: eBay.

I also had a Toshiba Libretto 70 for a couple of years. I still have it 
actually -- battery is dead but otherwise it still works. That screen 
was 640x480 and the keyboard smaller than the XO, and I did fine on it.

BTW, I managed to bootstrap Debian Woody onto the Libretto: 25 MB of DOS 
5.0 on the hard drive to get it to boot, followed by copies of relevant 
stuff from an offboard PCMCIA CD-ROM reader. I forget what version of 
KDE was on it, but it came up fine in 32 MB of RAM. A lighter WM 
probably would have been even better. I should crank that puppy up with 
a PCMCIA NIC and upgrade to Etch. :)

Yeah I just spent 2 hours before I saw that switch...

At least I wish they'd ship it in the on position! :) No further issues,

Some kind of do (But it's simply not for the lay user.)

HTTP 1.1 and NamedVirtualHosts can make it a tad annoying, *but* you  
can make one change, in one config, and do much of this on the server  
side, and then give out the "magic URL", provided that the new site  
is at a new DocumentRoot on a new machine (or on the same machine  
with a new named virtual host entry, but that's a DNS change, too)....

Somebody hinted as using mod_proxy, which sounds like the perfect  
tool, in some ways....
-----
  ProxyRequests Off

<Proxy *>
Order deny,allow
Allow from all
</Proxy>

ProxyPass /sekrit http://123.45.67.89/

#Depending on how you want to mess with HTTP headers...
#ProxyPassReverse /sekrit http://www.keithl.com/
-----

http://www.keithl.com/sekrit now looks at a different server entirely  
for the content of that folder.

Unfortunately, this will *not* allow you to fully test SSL tunnels,  
or iptable based configs, because those are at the DNS->IP level.  
Without being able to control *other people's machines at the DNS  
level (got root?)*, the above is merely another way of simply asking  
them to check the site at:

http://123.45.67.89/

...with an intermediary server handling the request.

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/966
...Will allow you to change the HTTP 1.1 requested host name, while  
still talking to the same machine IP (again, if you don't control  
their DNS, you don't control what IP they request data from). It's  
not a tool for the lay user.

The reason *why* such tools are likely rare is that you're basically  
talking about adding in a shim layer, that mucks around with a  
machine's DNS results, and essentially *lies* to the browser about  
the right IP for a given DNS lookup. Such tools certainly *do* exist  
in the windows world..... mostly in the form of viruses and adware  
that hijack users from one requested IP to another. In general, it  
makes more sense for programmers to use an existing system API for  
DNS rather than create a DNS client (or an over-ride) inside of their  
browser code.

Putting my "evil" cap on, this question is not entirely different  
from asking "Without asking the users to change anything, and without  
making a special DNS test name in that (or any other) domain, how can  
I craft a URL to channel users from Paypal.com into my server, so  
they'll give me their login credentials?"

For many creative variations on that Paypal theme, I suggest viewing  
your local SPAM archives. ;)

Subject: [PLUG] Shipping crate for 40U Rack
Message-ID: <1eab62c80711281133v19f91600q4ba737876d7cec0e@mail.gmail.com>

I'm in need of one of those shipping crate for an HP rack and
equipment. On of those plywood boxes and pallet on the bottom. Anyone
got one? I need to ship a rack with equipment across the country.

Thanks,
