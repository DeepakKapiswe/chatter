This is just a personal comment and really has nothing to do with the
thread of screenshots for whatever Cooper's purposes might be.

I think that KDE's (or any other window/session manager's) similarity to
Windows is a Bad Thing <TM>.

The similar look and feel leads a user to do things "The Windows
Way" rather than "The Unix Way" and, thus, negate much, if not all, of the
benefit of using a unix-like operating system.

I'll admit that getting people off of proprietary software and into Free
Software use is a Good Thing <TM>, but if a person is going to make a
change, perhaps they should be encouraged to get as much long-term benefit
out of the change as possible.

For those that insist that Windows is "easier" or that familiarity is
appealling to the average user, I have only anecdotal evidence to the
contrary.  My most recent personal convert is a young woman of 21 with
almost no college education and very little computer experience outside
basic word processing for school and operating retail POS terminals.  
She's taken to The Unix Way like a duck to water.  She uses Eterm more
often than any other application in X (in number of instances... xmms is
running all the time) and things grep is the coolest thing ever invented
(I've only just introduced her to sed, but I think the learning curve is
going to take a while to climb).  Again, this is only my most recent
conversion experience and it is not unique.

I find that when moving someone from Windows instead of promising that
things will be very much LIKE what they have used in the past, better
success is achieved (and a more well-rounded user/home administrator
developed) by focussing on how DIFFERENT things are on this side of the
fence.

Just my thoughts.
J.

I prefer ENU. They have two locations: in SE Portland (122nd/Sandy) and
one in Hillsboro. The employees are usually friendly, teenager-geeks,
pretty knowledgeable about the latest hardware stuff, and prices are as
low as I've found:  http://www.enuinc.com

Scott,

  Too much champagne last night, eh? North of Sandy on 122nd is NE, not SE.
And ENU is in the first strip mall on the right after the fire training site
and immediately north of Sandy Blvd. (which passes overhead of 122nd).

  It is a good store and the closest outlet to me.

I lean toward Pacific Solutions, but ENU is good.  I also like the store 
that's on NE 122nd near ENU, but on the left just before Airport Way. 
(I can never remember the name of it though.  No champagne to blame for 
that. )

Jeme,

Sometimes you are hard to take, but this time I must agree with you. 
There are some good things in Windows Applications that we should
imitate or at least make a similar functionality.  But the reason to
move to any software should be that it is a better solution overall.  I
find open source software to be more reliable, less crashy (if this is a
word), and when and if the owner of the software makes it unavailable
any more for any reason (remember Bill's threat to take Windows off the
market?), the software is still usable and maintainable.

Are you thinking of Computer and Software Factory Outlet? I've gotten a
few things from them in the past. But lately, I haven't found any
bargains in there. The best bargain I came up with from them was a low
price for a copy of Corel CAD a few years ago at their store in Hazel
Dell (I think that was where it was). Corel had already sold their
interest in it to another CAD company so I was able to talk them down
from $250 to closer to $100 (don't remember just how close).

I asked them about getting a laptop hard drive once. They gave me a
price over the phone, but when I called again about ordering it, I got
something of a run around. I ended up getting one from ENU just up the
street.

That's the one.

I haven't bought much from them lately, but I did get some good price 
quotes from them.  I also had a good discussion on parts with someone 
who worked there.

It's name is CSFO. I like the store, too. They carry parts and stuff for older 
systems, and know about them, too.

  The battery on my APC "BackUPS Pro 650" just died. Does anyone know where
I can buy a replacement, or am I better off buying a new unit? This is a new
experience for me. The less expensive models have worked longer and
trouble-free.

Try "Battery eXchange", or whatever they are called.  You'll probably
want the part number off the dead ones.  They are in the phone book.
Call ahead to ensure they've got them in stock.

Used to be replacing batteries was much cheaper than replacing the whole unit. 
The office supply I used back in the olden days in Bellevue WA took the old 
batteries in for recycling, a good deal all around. Here I don't know, I 
imagine you can find the same kind of service easily enough, maybe Staples or 
Office Depot to start. They both carry APC units.

The APC website has links to a couple of cheaper places to buy
replacements. I just bought a replacement for my SmartUPS 1400
for like $165. I think it was MicroWarehouse or something like
that...

Rich,

I've used www.gotbatteries.com with success. Don't know if they are the
cheapest, but the price for the batteries that I get is 40% less than from
APC.

One unlikely place I've found batteries via their battery finder on 
their website is Radio Shack. Does this look like the sort of battery 
you need for your BackUPS 650?

http://www.radioshack.com/product.asp?catalog%5Fname=CTLG&category%5Fname=CTLG%5F004%5F000%5F000%5F000&product%5Fid=960%2D0462

I have several 650s that I'll eventually need to replace the batteries 
in within the next year or so. If I only need one of these batteries 
per unit the batteries are cheaper than a brand new unit.

Hey Michael,

How long did it take your 1400 to blow a battery? I've had a 1400 for about 3 
years now without fail and was wondering if it might be time to look into 
stocking one.

Computer Bits is locally owned and based in Forest Grove, OR.

In 1998, former owner Paul Harwood attempted to publish a Phoenix
edition. It folded after we published about 10 issues. Personally, I
think it could have succeeded had Paul made different choices
concerning the sales staff down there. C'est la vie.

Prior to that, back in 1995/6, he published an edition just for the
mid-Willamette Valley (roughly Salem down to Eugene), but there was no
real base of advertiser support, so it folded after just a few months.

Reliable Power can get you batteries and they usually have an exchange
policy that could save you some money.  If push comes to shove, my shop
is an authorized APC reseller but we would have to order one for you.

Chech with APC - a customer of ours did recently and got a great deal
from them on upgrading to new units, (cost less than the batteries would
have, even after shipping).

Assuming the dimensions are 5.95 x 3.86 x 3.74 with .250" Faston connectors,
here are some possible replacements:

Panasonic LC-RA1212P1  $33 + shipping from www.digikey.com
Powersonic PS12120 $40 + shipping from www.mouser.com

  The dimensions are 8.4"x6.9"x4.9" and I haven't yet looked so I don't know
what the connectors look like.

We just replaced 2 of the APCC "RBC4" units (BackUPS-Pro 650S), and
got replacements locally.

I think they were less than $30/ea.

Disposal is an issue though ... the Metro recycling line says I should try
my local "Battery Exchange" on Canyon Road (Beaverton).

Subject: [PLUG] Software Upgrade
Message-ID: <20030102190352.33647.qmail@web9606.mail.yahoo.com>

I have been using Caldera OpenLinux 3.1 for about a
year and a half. At the time I installed it, I did not
realize that apparently there would be no more
releases, and now it is gradually becoming obsolete.

I was hoping to use KWord to typeset foreign
characters. After reading that KWord likes Truetype
fonts, I installed a Truetype server on my system, and
KWord recognizes such fonts. With earlier versions of
Qt, however, it will not print such text correctly. It
is possible to save KWord files as plain text and use
a utility such as Enscript to print them, but this is
"below the user's expectations." Modern versions of Qt
do not have this limitation.

Installation of Qt 3.x from source is apparently not
much of a problem, but I may want to try to install
KDE 3.x as well. KDE 3.x requires automake > 1.5 and
autoconf > 2.5.

The original installation of my system was from
.rpm's, but .rpm's for current versions of automake
and autoconf involve so many dependencies that I hoped
to install these packages from source. Compilation of
autoconf was apparently successful, but when I then
attempted to install automake, I was warned that my
autoconf version was 2.13. Why?

Midnight Commander finds autoconf in the following
places:

/usr/bin               5000        Dec 13 2001
/etc                     80        May 13 2002
/usr/local/bin         7681        Jan  1 2003
/usr/share              464        May 13 2002
home/download/Autoconf-2.57/bin  7681 Jan 1 2003 

>From this I suspect that the 2.13 binary was in
/usr/bin, and a successful compile placed 2.57 in
/usr/local/bin. Perhaps what I should do is to copy
the binary in /usr/local/bin to /usr/bin, overwriting
the binary now there. Any suggestions?

I suggest taking the unit apart and measuring for yourself.  Based on
what I'm seeing on the web, I think they gave you bogus dimensions.

Galen,

  That's close enough. After spelunking under the desk with a weak
flashlight, I approximated 6 x 4 x 4 inches.

  Interesting that the APC guy gave me the wrong dimensions.

  Northwest Battery has one for just a tad more than APC wants; I'm awaiting
a call back from another place. Besides, I have a client who wants a draft
letter _now_ so I better do that first.

Many thanks,

Rich

galen,

  Well, I'll be able to take the dead battery to them. I had just finished a
letter for a client and sent it to the printer when ... instant shutdown of
system and monitor. Yup, the UPS croaked. I'm now running off a power strip
and surge protector.

  So, a valuable lesson learned: when the UPS starts chirping, go buy a new
battery right away! It doesn't just bypass that and operate on the mains.
And, when the battery is dead it's DEAD.

Sigh,

Rich

  Update: the battery model number is 12120 and Radar has them in Boise, not
here. They're $10 less at Radar than at Northwest, but there's the time
factor, too. And this is my server so I'm off to SE Belmont.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0301021456070.2037-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  My battery problem reminded me of another issue I haven't yet resolved:
sufficent serial ports for everything.

  One of the reasons I bought the BackUPS-Pro was its ability to shut down
the network if the power goes out and no one's here. But, it needs a
dedicated serial port for that and I don't have one on the server. On this
box, /dev/ttyS0 goes to a switch on the desktop that is the conduit for the
PDA, the digital camera and the GPS field computer (the latter two are
swapped on the empty port while the PDA is always plugged into the other
port). /dev/ttyS1 is the pointy device. Those are the only two serial ports
on the box.

  What do most folks do in a situation like this?

  Since the software is _supposed_ to shut down the entire network, I wonder
if I'd be better off putting this UPS on the other workstation and
installing the software on that. But, we have a pda and trackball on that
box, too. However, it would be easier to add a board with a third port
(/dev/ttyS2) on that box.

  Is that the way to go?

Thanks,

Rich

There are supposed to be UPS models that use USB, but I have not tried 
them.  

I forget if mine does USB.  I have not set if for auto shutdown.  
I got it more for riding out the spikes and short brownouts I get on a far 
too regular basis.

We have a few Red Hat servers at work, and I'd like to automate their
updates, but I have one link in the chain that I'm stuck at.

I'd like to have one server automatically download any new RPMs from
somewhere, probably an ftp server, dump them into a directory along
with all my other RPMs, then do an "rpm -f *.rpm" to freshen any
packages on the system. I'll probably share the directory using NFS so
the other Red Hat servers can update too.

The problem I'm stuck at: what would be the best way to automatically
download only new packages and/or packages I don't already have in my
RPM directory?

Thanks in advance,

-Scott

  That wouldn't help here, Alan. No USB ports on the boxes. They are, after

Most users don't really want to 'use' a computer anyway - they want to 'use' 
e-mail, a word processor, a spreadsheet program, a solid modeller, an image 
editor, etc.

Keeping this in mind as a designer is sometimes counter-intuitive. I am a 
mechanical engineer, and for me, I have to remember that very few people who 
buy a cordless drill actually want to own one. What they actually want is a 
hole somewhere.

Similarly, what would happen if, when deciding to switch telephone companies, 
you had to remember to stop using your phone 'the AT&T Way' and learn all 
about 'the Sprint Way,' (insert any phone company you wish, I just picked two 
for examples.)

Now this would be lovely if the Open Source Communication device was an 
opportunity for folks to get rid of a certain evil telephony provider that 
had a habit of tapping peoples conversations 'because you agreed to let us do 
so in your service agreement with us...'

Couple of ideas:

1) use up2date from Red Hat.  I think it's $60/machine/year.

2) Use a copy of Paul Heinlein's rsync script (see PLUG archives) to
download the RPMs from a mirror and then look at freshmeat to find a
copy of Current (http://www.biology.duke.edu/computer/unix/current/),
which allows you to set up your own up2date server for your private
network.

Good luck,
Colin

I think it's a great idea to keep your system up to date...but what if an
RPM breaks something critical in your system and you didn't know it until
it's already installed?  One bad thing about automated updates without
user intervention.
As for your question why don't you do an rsync, and do the -F option that
only upgrades RPMs earlier than the version you're trying to install...

rsync, wget, or sitecopy can do that under different
circumstances.  there are others, but those are the three

I don't entirely agree there.  Look at people who use their computers to
do things that are done just as easily or more easily without a
computer.  Those people just want to use a computer.

I do agree that some people just want to use a spreadsheet program.  They
clearly don't want to store their data in a flexible and useful data
format with widely available tools for manipulation and maintenance...
they just wanna use a spreadsheet program.  Eighty percent of the Excel
documents that ever crossed my pc had no spreadsheet functionality
whatsoever.

I'm just bitching, though.

This above part is quite true, but I don't believe it has the consequences
you believe it does.  I think of this as the primary motivator to
distinguish between products of value and products of service.  People
want food and jewelry and stuff like that.  (Most) People don't want
televisions, power drills, and stuff like that (they want television,
holes, and so on).  I think that's an interesting concept and something
that designers, manufacturers and consumers should all consider, but I
don't think it has much to do with the way people use computers and really
is more of a plug-talk kind of discussion.

I'm not writing about doing things "The Windows Way" versus "The XFree
Way".  If I were, your analogy would be fairly sound and I would
understand your argument.  This isn't about the cosmetic or even
procedural differences between getting things done in one system versus
another.  This is about understanding the nature of the data and what is
required of the data for different applications.

The Unix Way involves data stored in the most generic form possible and
many small, specialized utilities to take that data, manipulate it to
reflect the desired information to be presented, and create a presentable
document.  There is a separation between data entry, storage, and
presentation that is totally ignored when doing things "The Windows Way".  
(Take Microsoft Word, for example.  The data is entered in a way that is
meant to closely reflect the one and only way in which it is conveniently
presented and the format of the stored data is just another reflection of
that one presentation method.  There are more advanced features, but that
is the basic mode of operation.)

I think doing things (and teaching people to do things) in The Unix Way
makes more apparent the infinite possibilities of the information with
which one interacts.  The reason for using a computer (versus a typewriter
or a sketchbook) ceases to simply be a matter of convenience and
time-saving and becomes a matter of new possibilities that do not exist in
the paper/stone/glass/whatever world.

Well, "Open Source" doesn't really protect you from service agreements and
the like.  I think you meant to write "Free as in Freedom".  You've got to
consider successive generational iterations.

  I've written to the application vendor and the xfce mail list on this
problem and have seen nothing from either place. Perhaps someone here has
had a similar experience and can suggest a solution.

  My monitor is set at 1024x768 pixels resolution, and that's how every
application has displayed under X. This morning, I opened my spreadsheet
application (XessSE) and it came up very large, as though it's displaying at
800x600 pixels. It does not use a virtual terminal so there's on geometry
switch to set the size of the aterm. There's nothing in ~/.xesspref.rc that
relates to display resolution. Every other application open in Xfce is
displaying at the proper resolution.

  This is quite a bother because I just cannot see the number of cells that
I should. I'm out of ideas of where to look for the cause of this problem.
If anyone has a suggestion, please pass it on to me.

Thanks,

Rich

Surprised that no one has mentioned this yet:

apt-rpm
http://apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org/

and cron "apt-get update". I'd do the "apt-get upgrade"s by hand, to 
avoid an automatic upgrade borking something important.

Dunno if apt-proxy could be made to work w/ apt-rpm in order to prevent 
multiple downloads. I'd just mirror the apt repository on your ftp 
server and put it the sources.list for the servers to be upgraded. You 
get your "download once, install many" setup that way too.

I use the perl script mirror. It keeps the directory up to date, 
downloading new, and removing obsolete (as in, they don't exist on the 
mirror any longer) files.

For the updates, I DON'T recommend doing an rpm freshen with a directory 
of files. I've had rpm get confused and not know what to do.

What I do here is use the fine autorpm script from Kirk Bauer. It can 
use your repository to update the installed RPMs, and follows 
dependancies if any come up.

I use logwatch extensively as well.

Is the issue related only to the cells or do the menus also appear to be
effected? If cells only, then is there a zoom or view menu that specifies how
many cell to have visible? Most speed sheets I have worked with have this
option, but I've never used Xess. If the menus are also effected, may be your
default font selection is the issue? 

Thank you
Russell

comm refers to your serial communications port...

Of which you have two 

comm 1&3 are the same
comm 2&4 are the same

do a cat on /proc/ioports  and you should get something like
this :::  

0000-001f : dma1
0020-003f : pic1

  c000-c007 : ide0
  c008-c00f : ide1
:


Notice address 03f8 - 03ff   an eight bit port..

Here's a handy little chart to help you figure out base I/O ports from 
the standard DOS COM designations:

DOS name Linux name IRQ IO Address
COM1:  ttyS0  4  0x3F8
COM2:  ttyS1  3  0x2F8
COM3:  ttyS2  4  0x3E8
COM4:  ttyS3  3  0x2E8

COM3: (ttyS2) on IRQ 5 is nonstandard, so I wouldn't jumper it that way, 
as is COM4: (ttyS3) on IRQ 2.

Russell,

  It's the whole thing: menus, buttons, cells, row and column headings. The
splash screen comes up properly. The cell default font is 12 pt, just as it
was last Tuesday when I last entered data into a sheet.

  This is one of the strangest things I've seen computers do.

Thanks,

Rich

Correction:  

Usually comm1 & comm3  use irq4
 
and

comm 2 & comm4 use irq3

And yes   comm1 and comm3 have different addresses.

There are only 2 UART's on the motherboard  -- or one
if you have a cheap motherboard...


So if you really need two comm ports.
The usual configuration is one even and one odd..

You can usually -- manually -- change the address in BIOS.

I was thinking the default font in XFCE. Some XFCE themes change the fonts as
well as the colors. 

http://www.xfce.org/help/html/setup-xfce.html
This dialog gives access to all XFce options :
The font used in XFce applications (as for the palette, this font is shared by
all XFce applications).


http://www.xfce.org/help/html/adv-wm-defaults.html
 WindowFont DEFAULTFONT
 MenuFont DEFAULTFONT
 IconFont DEFAULTFONT


Note:
DEFAULTFONT is defined as
-adobe-helvetica-medium-r-normal-*-12-*-*-*-p-*-iso8859-1

  Thanks, Russell. The problem here is that only a single application is
affected and that only since Tuesday. I've not changed my xfce configuration
is a _long_ time. Everything else is just as it was yesterday.

Very perplexing,

been using APC's PowerChute software for Linux on my SmartUPS 700 for 
nearly two years and it works quite well. The only negative was that 
the install procedure was very RedHat oriented and so some of my files 
on my system which runs SuSE Linux were mangled a bit. I had to fix a 
few things by hand.

PowerChute works quite nicely and cleanly shuts down my system when the 
power goes out for too long of a duration. I also have several other 
Linux system connected to dumb APC BackUPS 650 units for which I made 
my own signaling cables for a few dollars in parts from a second hand 
electronics store. 

I have my own hacked monitoring daemon which started life as the 
"backupsd" code which I took from the Linux UPS-HOWTO document. There 
were certain problems/shortcomings with the original daemon code and so 
I have my own "extended" version which corrects the problems I 
encountered with the original daemon. This setup has served me very 
well for nearly 4 years now.

   Thanks very much, Tony. I'm not sure I have a free slot in this box, but
perhaps I do. And a I/O board can't be more than a few bucks.

  I have also to find my cable. :-)  It's been quite a while. I'm sure it's
here -- somewhere.

  I looked at this code a while ago, before APC made their software
available. As I wrote just above, it's been a _long_ time since I looked
into this. Now I have another project on the to-do list. ;-)

I hope you can find your cable as APC charges what I think are "highway 
robbery" prices for their cables. I'm happy that APC seems to include 
the cable with their UPS's now so there hopefully isn't any extra cost 
involved anymore. My older BackUPS 600 and 650 units didn't include any 
signaling cables. 

IIRC the cable for the "smart" type UPS is more complicated compared to 
what's involved with the basic signaling cable which simply allows the 
UPS to signal when the power goes out and when the power is restored to 
the unit. The "smart" cable is used for communication between the UPS 
and host system with a variety of graphical and textual information 
being displayed in the PowerChute client.

The PowerChute "_upsd" server is a networked daemon and so it opens a 
port and listens on it so be careful if you plan to use PowerChute on a 
firewall system or any other system that is exposed to an open network. 
I don't know if there are any remote exploits or anything with it but 
you never can be too careful these days.

Subject: [PLUG] Screen Resolution problem with CYCAS
Message-ID: <3E152058.6FD03E8B@attbi.com>

Cycas is a CAD program from Germany (http://www.cycas.de) which is
available as a free download for non-commercial use. Since I'm very
non-commercial at the moment, and I need to do some drawings for a
building, I decided to give it a try. They have an RPM that loaded just
fine in RH 8, but when I run it, I can't see the right hand side of
their window, or the bottom edge. On the right, I get the minimize
button and half of the restore button, but no close button. I'm not sure
how much of the bottom I'm missing, but I know from reading their
documentation that there are a number of controls down there that I
can't get along without.

Does this sound like a program design problem, where the window size was
fixed, or is there something I don't know about the control of window
size in Gnome? I can't grab the top and pull it down, and if I do happen
to click on the restore button, the window maximizes and I can't get at
the buttons or the title bar at all! 

I've sent them an e-mail, and hope to hear from them tomorrow. In the
meantime, if anyone has any suggestions, I'd appreciate them.

Just a thought, but sometimes when I fun things at lower resolutions, I can't see 
the window edges. It's really annoying when I put X on a machine with an old 
video card. 1024x768 seems to be the absolute lowest that works.

It should be easier to resize the window by grabing the bottom edge/corners. 
    Try holding  <alt> while you click and drag anywhere in the window. 
Drag it up so you can see the bottom of the window.

Make it the size you want, then click the upper left box in the title bar 
and select History | Remember dimensions.

But if you don't use IRQ 2 or 5, you will be sharing interrupts on an ISA
bus.  In general, this is a bad thing.  Be prepared for character loss if
the two serial ports that are sharing are active simultaneously.

Thanks for the idea, but it doesn't work on this program. The window
doesn't move when I hold the <alt> key and click and drag. I tried it on
a terminal window and see what you mean about what it is supposed to do.
I'm not sure it would have helped in this situation, though. When I drag
the terminal window, it will move down below the bottom of the screen,
but it won't go up past the top. So, if I needed to get to the bottom of
a too large terminal window, I wouldn't be able to with this technique.

Absolutely. I was assuming the need for no more than two serial devices.

What we do at FREE GEEK with most modems is to disable all serial 
devices in BIOS (temporarily), and then boot from Tomsrtbt (or any 
version of linux with serial support). Then:

$ dmesg | grep ttyS

...shows the serial port the modem is configured to use. Then we use 
something like the above chart to determine which serial port does not 
conflict with the modem and therefore can be re-enabled in BIOS.

For most people this is extremely counterintuitive. (Why am I disabling 
something I want to use? Answer: You're not using it. It's actually in 
the way of the modem.)

  I can grab a top window corner and shrink the vertical and horizontal size
until it all fits on the screen. That's what I'm doing with my wayward
spreadsheet program until I get that size problem fixed.

Don't know but you're obviously not using the right magic.

Marvin,

Cramfs is basically a compressed RAM disk (zlib compressed IIRC).  My iPaq
used it before JFFS2 was stable enough. If you're using a Debian kernel
image I seem to recall they're using cramfs now to compress the initrd,
though I could be incorrect.

Well, once again I was referencing faulty memory (I need to fsck my brain
again sometime).

According to Handhelds.Org:

    Working With Cramfs
    Accessing cramfs is similar to ext2 ramdisk, except that cramfs
    is a readonly filesystem. It's new to 2.4.x so most 2.2.x-based
    development machines do not support it. Since cramfs is readonly,
    you cannot 'mkfs -t cramfs' and then populate. The mkcramfs utility
    creates an image of a cramfs filesystem from a directory tree.

    On a Linux 2.4.x Desktop Computer 
    bash# mkdir mntpoint 
    bash# mkdir temp 
    bash# mount -t cramfs init-2-40.cramfs mntpoint -o loop 
    bash# cp -a mntpoint temp 
    (do what you need to do) 
    bash# cd .. 
    bash# mkcramfs temp init-2-41.cramfs

So Marvin, I'm hoping you're using a 2.4 Kernel w/ cramfs support built in
(if using a cramfs initrd) or a module (if you're trying to access it
somewhere after mounting / or /lib/modules amd modprobing)...

Probably no connection, buttttttt I've had the same thing happen using
Mozilla.  All of a sudden the font would show up at about 16. Hasn't
happened recently.  If anything else weird happens you might try
memtest86.  I did and found a bad stick. A whole bunch of erratic
weirdness cleared up.

I've had this happen in Mozilla as well, but only after the cat
walked across the keyboard while I had the zoom widget in focus.
In that case, the cause of the problem was fairly obvious.

Bill,

  With mozilla I enlarge and shrink the text as required using ctrl-+ and
ctrl--. That's the easy part. :-)

  The tech support fellow at Applied Information Systems called back this
afternoon. After running a few tests, I sent him a screen shot of the
spreadsheet app, xclipboard and a couple of open xterms (plus GIMP and the
Xfce panel) and the output of appres and xclipboard. Those are a couple of
new tools for me.

  So, I'm waiting until next week when he's had a chance to look at the
stuff I sent. When I get this resolved I'll post the information here.

Thanks,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] page fault in nonpaged area
Message-ID: <1041656974.1018.25.camel@Balrog.jimwebb.net>

Hey guys,

I hesitate to ask this question since it concerns a box I built for
somebody December 2001.  They wanted windoze XP installed as their os. 
Not linux like I use, but they paid for the box and chose the os.  Don't
flame me please.  They've been having problems where the pc is
continuously rebooting and will bootup almost to the desktop and
reboot.  

I tried to reinstall windoze for them again because it appeared that the
bootup file was corrupted as well as many other files.  

My questions are this, which apply to most pc's, no matter what the os
is and I've learned a lot from you concerning pc's and linux over the
past year.  
1. I saw a message that stated 'page fault in nonpaged area'.  Would
this be bad memory?
2. Should the fan on geforce video cards run all the time?  I've checked
several of my boxes here at home and they aren't running all the time.
3. What temperature should an athlon xp 1600+ CPU operate at?

TIA,

Jim Webb

Look at ipchains-save and ipchains-restore.  You may have to edit the
listing and place /usr/sbin/ipchains (or whereever you have ipchains
installed) in front of it.  The rules are stated slightly different when
defined from when they are listed.

Computer Bits is PUBLISHED in F.G.. It's distributed all over the metro 
area. I picked up a copy yesterday at Wacky Willy's on Cornelius Pass Rd 
in Hillsboro. I've also seen it at most computer stores, and many other 
places. Look for the "Free Information" racks. I believe you can find 
these at Freddy's and most grocery stores.

I've had great luck with just typing the monitor manufacturer and model
number into http://www.google.com/... though the information you've
given apparently is not enough.  Do you have more data from the label on
the back of the machine?

For instance, typing: "MicroScan 5v ADI" got me what I needed for a
monitor I bought at the Free Geek thrift shop.

Subject: [PLUG] Compiling KDE from source
Message-ID: <20030105054427.12943.qmail@web9607.mail.yahoo.com>

I am presently undertaking the compilation of KDE from
source code, partly because I think the experience
gained might be valuable. I am attempting to install
3.0.5 on a system that now has an older version. I
have already compiled Qt with the appropriate options,
and have downloaded the KDE source files for 3.0.5.

There is only one regular user on my computer
("normal?") Under these circumstances, the path can be
set in the user account by adding lines to .bashrc in
this manner:

QTDIR=/usr/local/qt
KDEDIR=/usr/local/kde
KDEHOME=/home/example/.kde
PATH=$PATH:$QTDIR/bin:$KDEDIR/bin
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib:$KDEDIR/lib
export QTDIR KDEDIR PATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH 

The instructions on KDE's site imply that this file is
to be made active BEFORE compilation of the new KDE
source files. Although it is not explicit about
another point, it seems that one would have to be in
console mode to do these operations, since the present
version of KDE would no longer be in the path. 

Is that right? Should I boot at runlevel 3 to compile
the KDE source files?

If it is anything like MS Office (circa 97), I learned painfully that
the ordinary way to write macros is to record them doing something
close, then munge them with the macro editor.  I can't seem to do
anything useful with openoffice.  When I click on a main menu item,
the drop down blinks at me and vanishes.  No clue why.

Not unless I can get openoffice working! :-)

Hi Robert,

I have compiled KDE several times in the last few months, and each time I
followed the KDE website directions (including the variables) and the process
has worked fine for me without switching to runlevel 3 or going to console.  

In case you find it handy, here is how I test the build without leaving my
current login:

1.  Edit "/etc/kde/kdm/kdmrc" and add a new entry to the "SessionTypes" line;
    e.g. use "kde3.1rc5"

2.  Create a file in the "/usr/share/apps/switchdesk" directory named 
    "Xclients.kde3.1rc5"

3.  Put something like the following in that file:  

#!/bin/bash
export KDEDIR=/usr/local/KDE/3.1.0-rc5
export QTDIR=/usr/local/QT/qt-3.1.0
GCCDIR=/usr/local/gcc/gcc-3.2
FAMDIR=/usr/local/fam/fam-2.6.9
export PATH=$KDEDIR/bin:$QTDIR/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$FAMDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$GCCDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
exec startkde

4.  Make that file executable

5.  Start a VNC server/client session, and run that file 
    (/usr/share/apps/switchdesk/Xclients.kde3.1rc5) and you
    should see a new KDE session with the VNC window

If it all works properly, you should also have the new "kde3.1rc5" entry in the
pulldown menu on the KDM login screen (if you're using it.)

Good luck,

Marc

Nice job, but oof!  You might want to turn those images into actual
thumbnails that link to the full size image rather than just the scaled
down via the <img> tag like you have now - downloading a megabyte of
data for 7 little pictures is a little extreme, even on a cable modem

Brent,

You're absolutely right; I'll me doing this tomorrow. 

If someone would make thumbnails of these images that would save me some

Google is your friend. Try a search on LG Electronics. You'll find LG is
a Korean company. The third entry on the search results turned up
www.lge.co.kr which lead to a page with options for language, including
English. A little digging around on their site turned up a support page
that lead to: 

http://us.lgservice.com/bin/HPI/HpiHomeMain.cgi

Hover over Product Support and you'll find Owner's Manuals, which will
take you to a place that you can enter 57W in a search box. Your manual
is available for download or reading on line.

Dirk,

  If you're running bash in its default, emacs, mode then ctrl-r will do an
incremental (reverse) search for the command.

Since Bash uses the "readline" library, that is where you may learn how

Subject: [PLUG] bash questiom
Message-ID: <20030105225327.32540.qmail@web9605.mail.yahoo.com>

I compiled the three essential packages of KDE (arts,
libs, base). I was told that it could be launched
after these three were installed, and, since
compilation is a very time-consuming process, I
attempted to do this at that point to determine
whether I was wasting my time.

"startx" drew a blank, unfortunately. Something like
[1] 3415

I set a path to this installation for a single user in
.bashrc. One thing to check is whether "echo $PATH"
will return any reference to the olde installation,
and unfortunately it does.The path is set in .bashrc
as follows:

PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$KDEDIR/bin:$PATH

So apparently it just cheerfully tacked the new
directories onto what was already there. I really am
embarrassed to ask this question: where does $PATH
come from? If it is set system-wide, I'd rather change
it some other way. Perhaps I could leave out $PATH and
instead just use a list of the directories that were
supposed to be in the path. In any case, I'd like to
change it just for the user; if I hadn't done it that
way, I might not be online now! (I haven't tried
logging into Yahoo with Lynx, but it wouldn't be much
fun.)

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.33.0301051713280.19856-100000@lukem.com>

Interesting...  Microsoft is supposedly using TCP/IP in a way that makes
IE respond faster to IIS and slower to non-IIS webservers:

http://grotto11.com/blog/?+1039831658

Could someone with IE and IIS please verify this?  A dump of TCP/IP
traffic with different versions of IE and IIS would be ideal.

Of course covered on Slashdot:

http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/01/05/2025254

This post sums things up:

 The parent +5 post is flat out wrong. This is not about persistant
 connections, which is a high-level HTTP feature that keeps a connection
 open so that the browser can send more requests. This is about a
 low-level TCP hack that IE uses to get a small speed boost on IIS
 servers, while breaking TCP standards compliance.

 If I read the article correctly, instead of creating a new TCP connection
 and then sending a request, IE sends the request immediately without
 bothering to finish the TCP handshake. Microsoft IIS web servers deal
 with it automatically, and it is faster because it saves a round-trip
 wait for the ACK and the following requset.

 The down side is that non-IIS servers have no clue what this incoming
 packet is. It must be invalid because it is not a SYN. So it gets thrown
 away, and the server might or might not reset the connection. If a
 non-IIS server resets the connection, IE goes with a standard TCP
 handshake and has wasted only the round trip time for the request packet
 and the RST. But if the server swallows the invalid packet and does not
 send a RST, then Internet Explorer will just sit around for a few seconds
 until it times out and falls back to a standard TCP conection.

 The summary is that IE is breaking the TCP protocol for a small speed
 boost when connecting to IIS servers. It results in a small speed penalty
 when connecting to most non-IIS servers. When connecting to non-IIS
 servers that do not reset the connetion, it results in a very noticable
 delay.

 It could also be a potential security risk, because if this is true, then
 it makes it very easy to IP-spoof a HTTP request against IIS (since the
 request is a self-contained packet instead of a long connection
 sequence).

Sounds like the startx process (process id 3415) went into the background (as
job #1); were there any errors after this?  If not, it seems startx did start.
Does pressing Alt-F7 do anything?

Having the "old" programs in your path is not really a problem, as long as 
the one you want is the first in the path.  For example:

    % which konqueror
    konqueror is /usr/local/KDE/3.1.0-rc5/bin/konqueror
    konqueror is /usr/bin/konqueror

The "/usr/bin/konqueror" is from some old RPM that I still have installed, but 
I have not used that version of KDE for months.

> I really am embarrassed to ask this question: where does $PATH come from?

Looks like it comes from /etc/profile, with /etc/bashrc and /etc/profile.d/*.sh
contributing to shell startup.

Good luck,

Marc

Yes!  Please post the URL to a .pcap file!

You could use ethereal, or:

 tcpdump -s 65534 -w outfile.pcap

... then get the pertinent packets with ethereal, and save them for us.

We should be putting netfilter rules in place that catch those and send
the TCP RST right away, right?

(ObArchive: the version number part will likely change in the future)

http://www.pdxlinux.org/doc/kernel-doc-2.4.18/Documentation/filesystems/cramfs.txt.gz


Debian kernel's have been patched (the patch is supposed to have been
submitted upstream, and may make it into the mainstream kernel at some
point) to support a cramfs initrd.  You are booting without an initrd,
and it prints that message on booting.  (Perhaps the patch should be
updated to have it suppress that confusing error message?)

The Debian "kernel-package"'s make-kpkg generated .deb's have a
postinstall script that calls on the "initrd-tools" to generate a
potentially customized initrd image on installation of the
"kernel-image".  RTFM:

https://www.pdxlinux.org/cgi-bin/dpkg?search=++Search++&query=kernel-package
https://www.pdxlinux.org/cgi-bin/dpkg?search=++Search++&query=initrd-tools

(I hope that we don't get "cracked" by somebody who digs around in there
and finds software versions with remote exploits...  I suppose that it
COULD happen, but that it probably won't, and that exposing this tool is
beneficial enough to the group to be worth that small risk.)

You could program "sawfish" to size that window for you when it

I'm using "apcupsd" on two machines with two UPS's.  One has a serial
connection, the other a USB connection.  It works very well.  "apcupsd"
can operate in a networked mode, as a slave, when you have more than one
machine plugged into the UPS.  The master signals the slave over the
network.  You could just as easily use a PLIP or firewire connection as
an ethernet, I suppose.

The problem I have with the USB version is that the HID device sometimes
moves out from under it.  It's trying for hid0, and that works, but
after it restarts, the silly device has moved to hid1.  It's some sort
of devfs bug.  I've seen the same thing happen with v4l devices too, so
it's not the HID code, afaict.

At least with the versions of apcupsd that I am presently running, the
serial version can shut off the power of the UPS, but the USB version
cannot.  There might be a newer one available; I've not checked in ages.

Karl, just when did you become webmaster? Last time I looked, I had that
responsibility. Common courtesy & nettequette dictates that you should
at least ASK if you wanted to take over the duties.

I was out of town for two weeks -- as you well knew -- & when I happened to
look at the website during my absense to see if I missed any mail from the
PLUG list, I found you took everything I had put up & replaced it with your
own work.

In other words, the FAQ for PLUG, the list of presentations for the last
four years, Linux contacts for other groups, companies, & contractors --
not mention email links to anyone connected with PLUG -- all vanished.
About the only thing on the web site now is an outdated meeting announcement,
& Dave's history of PLUG. Oh, there are some colorful links about Debian.

I'm not claiming that what I have done was award-winning work, but I felt
I was at least keeping the site up to date, fixing links, keeping it
visible until either I could give it my undivided attention, or someone
who wanted to work full time on it volunteered to take it to the next stage.
As a result, people were starting to use the site more, & it had the
potential to be a useable resource; but your slap-dash work now put what's
there back a year. BTW, not only did I solicit feedback & talked to people
about what the site needed, I made an effort to keep all of the existing
content where anyone could see it.

If you want people to help you, learn to work with people.

I have tried to write this response about five times and each time the response
becomes a personal attack on Karl. In an effort not to degenerate into a crap
fest, I will simply say, I enjoyed the pre-Karl web site and do not like the
current representation of PLUG on the web.

Thank you

? No response here?  Have you COMPARED the two sites SOURCE and thought
about readability and maintainability?  Content aside, this is a very
important consideration.  The oldsite is in CVS also now.  Take a look
everyone.

I see that you do.  Great.  And thanks for the adrenaline.  I am

I became webmaster when I took the initiative and reimplemented the
website backend.  We now have validated HTML, and readable source.  All
that remains is to port the content.  The difficult part is finished!

XEmacs on drizzle is configured globally with the "mmm-mode" support
required for maintaining the site.  If you do not have DSL or would like
to edit locally, you can check it out of CVS.  Install "mmm-mode", copy
the relevant setups from /etc/xemacs21/site-start.d/* (grep mmm there),
and also grab "mmm-ext.el" (locate it).  Tested in XEmacs only, YMMV,
ask me for help if you need any.  It should be fairly straightforward to
get working -- 10 minutes.

Yes, excellent.  That is the list I was asking for when I began this
thread.  Now I have a Todo list.  Keep the suggestions coming, folks!
(thweeeeeppp! <-- great feedback!  Love it.)

Right, that's me.  And no, it was not award winning work.  The markup
sucks -- it looks like totally unprofessional garbage, pasted from an
ancient "I edit in pico as I learn HTML for dummies" (I only know one
layout trick - gif bordered table) PLUG site.

If they used the site, it was due to the content, not the
implementation.  Your content will be ported shortly.

> If you want people to help you, learn to work with people.

Yeah, right.  CVS for dummies anyone?  Anyone know how to use PSGML mode
in XEmacs?  "mmm-mode"?  HTML::Mason in Apache mod_perl?  That's the
implementation technology I have chosen for this.  Please view the
source once via the CVS link and have a quick look-see.

If the list is interested in moving the plug website to a server without
so much political games and irritating policies, I would be willing to
host it on my server.  It's on a nice DS3 connection in a co-location
facility.  I run Slackware Linux 8.0 (not that it matters, I'm not going
to shove Slack in your face every chance I get).  What matters is that it
works and is fast and stable.  That's all that should matter in a server
right?

The current server is owned by David Mandel, so that won't solve things.

Actually, I control this machine - but Micro Sharp Inc donates the
use of the hardware and bandwidth to PLUG.

I asked Karl to act as PLUG's SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR.
As such, he installed Debian and lots of good web development tools
on this machine including things like php, perl, python, zope,
squirrelmail, mailman, etc.
I might note that Karl has done a good job as PLUG's SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR.

I also asked Geoff to act as PLUG's WEB MASTER.
As such, Geoff has shown initative and has done is good job maintaining
the PLUG web site.
Geoff has done a good job as PLUG's WEB MASTER.

Unfortunately, we have had a few misunderstanding lately, and we need to
get this straighten out.

Hence forth - unless and until we change things -

Karl Hegbloom is PLUG's SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR.
     Changes to user accounts, system tools, and so on should be handled
     by Karl.

Geoff Burling is PLUG's WEB MASTER.
     Changes to our public web sight should be approved and/or made by
     Geoff.

On the other hand, we have facilities to give anyone a play ground to
     use to build pilot web sites.  Please make major changes in a
     pilot area so Geoff and others and test the new system before
     installing them on PLUG's main site.

And in order to improve communications maybe we should start holding
regular web meetings again.  I am busy this week, but maybe next week
would work - say next Tuesday evening at my house??

Has anyone had any experience with this outfit? I have a client who is
considering it. I've looked at their web site, and read their white
paper. Sounds reasonable, but then they probably wouldn't have put it on
their site if it didn't. What would be more useful would be hearing from
anyone who has used the service, or knows someone who has.

In this particular program, I cannot grab a corner. I can do that
successfully with other programs, but not with CYCAS.

I'm beginning to think that there is something set wrong on my system.

I'm supported in my suspicion that there is something set wrong on my
system by the lack of anything happening when I click on any of the
entries in the Sawfish window manager pop-up menu. I click on the red
hat > Extras > Preferences > Sawfish window manager > and find a list
that includes:

Focus behavior
Key Bindings
Matched Windows
Minimizing and Maximizing
Miscellaneous
Moving and Resizing Windows
Window Appearance
Window Placement
Window Sounds
Workspaces

Nothing happens when I click on any of these.

Can someone suggest where to start looking for what is going on, here?

I remember at some time in the past having a window that was larger than
the screen, and by moving the mouse up to the top edge I would move
higher up in the window. By moving the mouse to the bottom edge, I would
move lower in the window. Same thing with left and right. In other
words, the screen provided 800 x 600 access to a part of a 1024 x 768
window. What I don't remember is where I experienced this. Is this
something available with X in Linux? If so, what's it called, and where
do I set it up?

Thanks for the continued help. I got the immediate CAD problem solved by
using Corel CAD on my Windows machine, setting the lines to a heavier
weight, exporting as a .gif, importing to Word Perfect, and printing.
That's a lot of fooling around. I'd rather get printed output from the
native CAD program. (Something's broken about printing from Corel CAD,
and since it was sold several years ago --the development of it, support
is not available.) So, I still want to try to get CYCAS working on my
Thinkpad.

How can one acutaly implement this with self-signed keys with
OpenSSL/Apache (read as: I've read the theory, show me the commands)? :)

Can it be top level domains.. as in can my key contain subtend.net +
devilsfate.com + etc... or just secondary?  (subtend.net +
lists.subtend.net)

Sorry for digging up an older topic, but I kept this email around so I
could get to it when I was ready (and after I could read and interperate

  Well, the fine folks at Applied Information Systems came through again.
Turns out that something I installed here -- probably a Red Hat application
package or bugzilla update -- screwed up the sequence of fonts in
/etc/X11/fs/config.

  The scaled fonts were listed first, and the entire sequence was far
different from what I had set up a long time ago. So a bit of moving around,
followed by restarting the font server, and the display on this one app is
back where it should be.

Whew!

I not going to argue the merits of Emacs vs. vi vs pico vs. notepad.

But once a site requires, fucking requires an a particular editor it has
no freedom, no choice, and no business being on a Linux site.

Unless the site can be use with *ALL* editors that can write a text file
(so notepad is out), or be edited via a browser (and all browsers).

Perhaps I read that post wrong.  if so, Karl, post a sample page to the
list, and show how to edit it in the email.

If not, revert the site immediately, or install frontpage and use it
instead.  At least with a Microsoft Product we are used to being forced
into using software to create hard to read files.

We do not have a speaker for this month, or any month for that matter. 
I have suggested a macro writer for openoffice.

Some other possibilities:

GNOME2 what does it offer?
KDE3    ""
X 4.3   ""
CD recording/copying/ripping
spamassassin and its friends.
amavis.
DVD recording


So if you have any experience and can stand up for 45 minutes or so,
please volunteer to lead a talk.  The last one was great, most of the
talking came from the crowd, not the speaker.

I liked your [Zot's] ideas for two round-tables/debates (on different
nights, of course):
Software licenses: practicality, philosophy, and morality
Distribution of choice:  Why I do things the way I do.

I'll volunteer to take the FSF/GNU hardline on the former and the LFS
(Linux From Scratch) position on the latter (I'd also do Debian in a
pinch, but I'm not heavy into Debian development or anything, but I have a
fair idea of what's real and what's bullshit and maintain several Debian
systems).

I think both of those could make for a fun night.

Well, that's the whole point, Zot.  It doesn't REQUIRE XEmacs, Karl just
can't imagine doing anything any other way.

He actually wrote in another post that knowing how to use XEmacs (rather,
not knowing how) can be a sole determining factor as to whether or not a
person is a competent developer.  He's got some pretty messed up ideas, I
think.  It seems that he those things to which he claims personal pride
are the only things to which a person should aspire (physical health,
rural upbringing, and XEmacs, near as I can tell -- ignore the fact that
the first two are mostly luck of the draw and the last an arbitrary
personal choice with that's even, from a Free Software perspective, a bit
morally shaky).

I'm just going to give the fellow a vote of no-confidence.  I don't trust
him to work with PLUG to meet the needs of PLUG.  He's more interested in
carrying out the will of Karl.

It CAN.  I assure you.  I think the technology Karl has implemented is
really sound and probably the sort of thing we should be moving toward
(that we is not just PLUG, but folks who want to delivery information via
http).

I'm just really unhappy with the way Karl chose to move forward with this.

I agree that nobody was working on it and Karl was actually petitioning
for input (though always on HIS terms -- it was clear that your input
would always be second to his) and getting dissed publicly or just
ignored.  That kind of treatment takes a toll on a person.  He seems to
have lost any ability (assuming he had it, of course) to work with people
on any terms but his own.

I think we should mourn the loss of a hard-working, intelligent colleague
and move on.

So now it's the Karl Revolution, eh?  Jeme has been circumspect about this
so far, but I won't be: you are a childish megalomaniac, and I think
it's clear that it would be in the best interests of PLUG to remove you
from any situation where you can exercise control over others.

Actual USERS of the site - those who browse to it for information - find a
bunch of broken links and "Something needs to be written here".  Actual
USERS of the site don't give a damn about HTML::Mason.  The point of the
site, I thought, was to provide to users information about PLUG, not to
demonstrate the web skills of Karl.  (Gee, when I browse to the site in
Lynx, at the *very first line on the page*, is a link to Karl's resume!
How convenient!)

In effect, you vandalized the website.  You can't even see that, can you?

Good catch. I didn't catch that earlier in all the back and forth. Even if
it doesn't actually require it, to try to dictate what people use is
absurd. Either way it's bad. I mean, is the site content THAT important
that it has to be perfectly formatted, even if it means that you can't use
what editor you want, it's in a language few people use and there's no
content up anymore? At what point would it have just been better to just
use HTML and pico?

So it DOES require emacs? Why? I've been in web development since the web
was born and I've never coded a site to use a particular editor. If we
need variables, why not just use PHP and an include file? Or statically
generate the pages Content Management System, style? There are so many
open-source ways to handle this better without bringing in variables from
an editor. That's ridiculous.

By setting the GUI font to 8 points, the entire window becomes visible,
and I can grab the title bar and move the window on and off screen to
the right and left -- it's still too wide to fit within 800 pixels. This
makes it possible to work with, and I'll be giving it a try later on.

Thanks to all for the suggestions of what to try.

This is a feature of Xfree86.  During the setup, available resolutions
are selected (should depend on the monitor and video card selected),
with one as the default.  The keys <ctrl>+<alt>+<keypad+> will decrease
the viewable resolution (and will decrease each time they are pressed,
unless you are at the lowest resolution, then it will cycle to the
highest), but the virtual resolution won't change (everything on your
desktop will still be there, just bigger).  Moving the mouse to the
edges of the viewable space will pan the display.  To increase viewable
resolution (makes things smaller), press <ctrl>+<alt>+<keypad->.  My
suggestion is to use your highest (legible) resolution as the default,
and adjust from there.  Don't select any resolutions that don't work on
your hardware, I have monitors that will display 1600x1200, but I don't
use this resolution because nothing is legible.  This is configured in
the XF86Config(-4) file, but your distribution probably has a tool for
changing the x-server configuration.

Dick,

  A question and a suggestion. Does the application generate its own window
or does it open in a virtual terminal? In the latter case you can specify
the opening window size.

  Regarding fonts. As root, run /usr/sbin/chkfontpath to see what size fonts
are found and in which order. As I closed the thread on my spreadsheet app
on steroids I mentioned that it was the font path sequence that had become
hosed on my system. Once I put that pack in order (with the 75dpi fonts --
scaled -- first) the whole thing became visible again.

  You can run the appres tool to learn what fonts and screen resources are
used by your CAD program.

HTH,

Rich

emacs users can ignore it too.  file-local variables are a

Karl works for Micro Sharp, I'm not sure how well that would work. I have no

We could also host it under another domain name.  I own a few that could
be a drop-in replacement for it.

If hosting it on my server is not something the group agrees on I would be
happy to help in any way I can to secure confidence back into OUR web
site.

We don't have to take away Karl's power, we just have to make sure other
people have equal power to counterbalance bad decisions (and enforcement
of control).

Karl has shown (quite unfortunately, but quite literally and explicitly)
that he cannot be trusted to enact the will of PLUG (or maybe just that he
cannot distinguish between his will FOR PLUG and the will OF PLUG).

I don't think we need to REPLACE him so much as we need to dilute his
power by giving more people control over the systems.

You can't be effective as a rogue if others can easily undo your work.

Heh... we COULD use this unfortunate incident to use puglug.org. :)

After all, the Portland Unix-GNU-Linux User's Group is more accurate
anyway.

I think we all share your sentiment and intent here.  I, for one,
appreciate the support.

So, David Mandel, you have physical access to the machine in question, can
you just make sure that other people are given root privileges?  You can
enforce this (being the will of everyone, I think) by simply unPLUGging
the machine if one admin locks anyone else out.

I have worked in a place with "co-admins", one of whom was bad and out of 
control.

What you are proposing sounds nice, but does not work out in practice.  
Everyone spends more time trying to overcome the single problem that 
actually getting anything done.  

It turns into an even bigger turf war and ignores the primary problem.

Subject: [PLUG] UPS repair locally?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0301071346570.5230-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  Unfortunately, replacing the battery on my UPS didn't solve the problem.
It was the bad battery light that was on, but after putting in a new battery
the unit -- some time later -- shut itself off and refused to allow me to
turn it on.

  Yesterday morning, it was back on (by itself). Some time later the same
day it went comatose again. I suppose that I could ship it back to Rhode
Island to APC, but the cost of repair and shipping could match or exceed the
cost of a new unit. However, having just bought a new battery, I would like
to know if there is a local facility that could check and repair the unit
for me.

Thanks,

Rich

If we restrict Karl's abilities in the future, we're justifying the
restriction of people's abilities.  I won't stand by that.

What Karl is doing is wrong (taking control away from others) and we're
just as wrong if we do it to him.

  Thank you, Brian. They do repair UPSs, but their engineer is out now and
they don't have a backup for him. :-) Anyway, someone will call tomorrow and
I'll get this resolved before a local driver runs into a power pole heading
down the hill on 238th.

Why don't we just create a web design committee?  Anyone who has changes
or enhancements to the site sends their code to the committee.  The
committee reviews the code, votes on whether to implement it or not and
goes forward.  Why won't this work?  A 5-6 person committee should be
sufficient.  Rotate the actual web admin job between the people on the
committee.  This way, the committee decides what goes on the site after
taking input from the list; lessening the possibility that one person
can take control.  If a person gets out of line, that person gets
removed from the committee by a vote.  If this is a bad idea, please
explain to me why.  It may not be perfect, but at least it is better
than arguing about it throughout the list.

another one, I tink a lot of people would like:

Fixing ugly fonts under X.

Perhaps we can have 3-4 people present their "good" fonts on their
laptops.

Kind of a clinic of sorts.  We could cover distro's.

So anyone who has a laptop with good looking fonts?  Or can fix a X
server without an Internet connection?

  That looks like a great plot for a TV show! The last committee member left

Anyone have any contacts with OPB or Local Cable Access.  Heck, let's go

Maybe a good flame Mike will divert attention from the recent drama on the list.

Is there a virus or something that knocks out the cd-rom drive in win9x? I've gone

drive is fine, because it works great when I reboot into RH 8.0. I'd dump the win,

I've seen three good cd-rom drives unavail in "my computer" on win98 and win95 in

And others will be forever undoing his destructive behavior. 

Short story - I'll be brief.  I've been a member for 2 weeks and I thought 
that I was joining a Linux/Unix group. This looks like I mistakenly ended up 
in concentration camp ruled by Steven "I Know What's Best" Balmer. By reading 
the web site I get the feeling that this is a Debian only group and has more 
to do with picking a fight than the promotion of an open source forum for 
learning and teaching. By reading this list thread I wonder if I need to 
apply for my Debian/emacs bigot certification just to remain a member. Is 
this how the group wants to be seen by the community and new members - 
because that's the signal we're sending?

I don't wish anyone ill but putting the site back to normal only treats a 
symptom, I suggest the better approach would be to cure the disease.

Oh, that's some hippy dippy crap if I ever heard it. Even open source
software projects have people that decide what is allowed into the main
source tree. I know of no effective software IT operation where everyone

That has got to be the most asinine thing I have ever heard.

You remove people from positions of authority when they abuse that
authority or show that they cannot handle it.

Karl has shown that he cannot be trusted with that sort of authority.

If you leave people like that in control, you get the sort of problems
as we are seeing here.

To say that we should not "restrict his freedom" is nonsense.  He has
access to the machine to perform a task, not to "express his freedom".
He can do that on his own machine and on his own time.

I think you have been sniffing too much GNU.

  Excellent, Felix. Thanks!

  FWIW, if you don't mind paying real money for quality stuff, Bitstream
probably still sells their 500 font cdrom for a very reasonable price. It
includes all the fonts in both Type1 and TrueType encoding so you can have
the same fonts available regardless of the encoding needed by a particular
application.

  I bought the cdrom about 8-9 years ago so I won't venture a guess as to
the current price.

  Now, if there was a simplified way of getting Type1 fonts into LaTeX ...
sigh. fontinst is not what I categorize as "simple". I'm still only about
70% through it.

There are those of us who use other distro's are quite happy doing so,

Not because ours is better or their's worse, but because "it just 
works(tm)".

I too think that what Karl did was out of line, and he deserves to have 
the privledge removed.

I have physical access to the corporate servers at work. They run 
Windows. If I came in one weekend, and replaced them with Linux, I'd 
expect to get fired on Monday. Even if I replaced them with something 
"better", "more stable" and with "less TCO", I'd be out of line and in 
the unemployment line/sig.

Karl has abused a trust.

One of the reasons I am glad to have the Corel type-1 collection.

The biggest problem is that some applications freak out when they see
more than a couple hundred fonts.  (OpenOffice 1.0 for example.)

There are a couple of nice improvements.  Still some of the more
annoying 8.0-isms to work out. I wish they would provide more than a
couple of themes.

Having the spell checker work in Evolution 1.2.1 is also a plus.  (It
does not work well with Redhat 8.0.)  They also need to add "Redhat" to
the spell checker. ]:>

Steven,

It's unfortunate that you saw this ugliness so quickly. I've been
participating in this listserver now for a couple of months, so I'm
fairly new here too. There definately is a lot of crap in here; a lot
of opinions like "my way is the only way and any different is
evil/stupid/inferior."

But if you manage to look past the crap, it can be a very useful
resource. In the short time I've been here, I've had two or three
problems solved quickly by several friendly people who offered
suggestions. I have also posted a few messages trying to help other
people when I had experience on a particular topic. Though the
obnoxious are vocal, they are few. The majority of the people here can
be quite helpful. Be patient, and stick around.

-Scott

Well, I just think that it's dumb to set up a committee and consolidate
the power there when we've seen very clearly what happens when power is
consolidated into the hands of the few.

It might "work", but it's a fairly soviet solution (I use that term oddly,
I know, but it just kind of fits... I mean that it has the sheen of
cooperation and community, but is actually just another way of handing
over control to a privileged few and ensuring their continued reign with
endless bureaucracy and the application of copious force).

Also consider that PLUG is a wholly open club to which one attains
membership by merely claiming membership.  Any "committee" would be about
the same.  If it were any other way, you'd have to say that some few
people have the power to say that some other few people can't participate
at whatever level they choose.  It's the path to Hell.

Please don't mistake my righteous indignation for righteous indignation.

His behavior is only destructive in that it is the unilateral exercise of
unchecked power.

When a number of peers are set with equal power, they keep each other in
line and there is little temptation toward abuse.

We don't have a unified signal.  We're just a bunch of people.  The best
we can hope for is a sort of agregate slant to our collective view.

Some say the disease is Karl.  That's bullshit.  Karl is just an
individual member of the infectious parasitic species.  The disease is the
consolidation of power in the hands of the few.

We cure that only by removing unequal power relationships.

I've been on this list since 1995 or so. The signal-to-noise ratio fluctuates
wildly. It is sad when the noise becomes deafening, but it will fade.

There are an amazing number of talented, fascinating people on this list.
You just have to wait for the few vocal, obnoxious ones to calm down a bit :-(

You heard it?  Do you always move your lips when you read?

[The attempt at a clever retort above came after considerable deliberation
(for a comment like that).  I thought about throwing out something like,
"Is 'love thy neighbor' and The Golden Rule hippy dippy crap, too?", but I
decided that maybe actual argument wasn't warranted since the comment
itself was just dismissive insult and not argument at all.  So you got
what's there.  I hope to try harder in the future.]

Even open source software projects can be oppressive tyrannies.  Why
should software projects be different than any other kind of human
organization?  Some are corrupt and destructive and others are spiritless
and dull and still others are respectful and cooperative.

> I know of no effective software IT operation where everyone has the

Can you name ONE "software IT operation where everyone has the same level
of access"?

I think that perhaps you don't know of an effective one because you don't
know of any at all.  In that case, "effective" is a red herring.

I can safely say the following:

I know of no failed software IT operation where everyone had the same
level of access.

See why the adjective is meaningless and misleading?

PLUG is not a software IT operation.  PLUG is a club of friends who learn
from one another about information technology, specifically as it relates
to Unix, the GNU system, and Linux (with a healthy dose of the related
hardware and network engineering disciplines).  We have no set task or
agenda.  We're just trying to make our lives better by being involved with
one another and learning from each other.  Perhaps some of us like to use
what we learn at PLUG to draw in more members or convert our friends and
family and employers and landlords to our "enlightened" ways, but others
don't care about evangelism and just want a set of people with whom to
commiserate, share, and ask questions.  They're all welcome.

The purpose of HAVING a web site is two-fold; a) to have a place to
quickly disseminate information to people not on the mailing lists about
the group's activities and affiliations and b) to experiment for ourselves
and show each other how we might implement various features with existing
tools in our Unix/GNU/Linux arsenal.

We don't have stockholders for whom we must increase value.  We don't have
quarterly reviews for which we must show incremental improvement.  We're
just a bunch of people feeding off one another and hoping that makes our
lives better in some way.  We all have different reasons for being
involved and can only assume one thing in common:  We all have some
interest in communicating with people who have an interest in
communicating with other people within the scope of Unix, the GNU system,
and Linux.

It's pretty stupid, if you think about it.  But life is really just a
bunch of stupid associations in which we involve ourselves to feel alright
about the time we spend between meals and naps.

> Oh boy.

Yeah, phew.  That's a radical nutjob's idea, huh?  Imagine!  Thinking that
a person is wrong for doing unto others as they would not have done unto
themselves!

We all know that sensible people do things like use weapons of mass
destruction against nations for the crime of possibly posessing and maybe
even intending to use weapons of mass destruction!

Ooh, it's all so circular.

Break the cycle.  Forgive.  You can't fight crime by committing crime.

Well, see my response to Preston.

I suppose you believe you're stopping violence by hitting someone who hit
you?

To paraphrase a pretty great fellow, if we continually practice the
philosophy of "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth", we will end up
in a land of people who are blind and toothless.

Do unto others as you would have them do unto you, Alan.  You don't like
what Karl has done to you, don't go doing it back to him.  Learn from the
pain and make it so that nobody feels it because of you.

The problem isn't the person in the position of authority, the problem is
the position itself!

There's absolutely no reason why something like PLUG should have seats of
authority.

Don't remove the person, remove the authority.

> Karl has shown that he cannot be trusted with that sort of authority.

No subset of the whole group can be trusted with that sort of authority.  
It's the sort of authority that only the group as a whole can maintain.

If you leave control in the hands of the few, you get the sort of problems
as we are seeing here.

This is his own time.  And insofaras Micro Sharp has donated the use of
the machine to PLUG and Karl is (as anyone who claims to be so is) a
member of PLUG, then it is his machine.

The problem is that he is not letting the rest of PLUG exercise the same
freedom that he has.

Message-ID: <1042010928.1426.34.camel@sparticus.coopnkass.com>

All,

I have posted the "In The News" segment for January to our web site. You
may find it here:

  http://www.mwvlug.org/jan_2003_news/img0.html

Although we didn't get the chance to do the news segment this time I'll
be sure to squeeze it in next month.

Also, special thanks again to Tim Witham for coming to speak to us about
the Open Source Development Lab in Portland. I really enjoyed not only
his speaking about the OSDL but also gaining insight from his
experience. And if the hour+ extra we spent at the meeting was any
indication, I think we all definitely appreciated his being here!

Thank you!


Best,


Cooper Stevenson

So it's enough to you that your stuff "just works" and you don't care if
it's better or worse than anything else?

I've got to ask, were you a C student by choice?

I think the above statement is wrong for at least five reasons, but I'm
not going to get into that right now.  (Feel free to ask, though.)

That's because you work in a totalitarian regime.  Your bosses have
absolute authority and your will is only considered as much as it improves
their personal positions.

I don't think any rational comparison can be made between PLUG and a
private commercial enterprise.

That is the BEST statement of what has happened that I've read so far!

Karl was trusted to do some things on behalf of PLUG and he has abused our
trust and done things that are contrary to the will of some of us.

Bravo.

I should point out that pdxlinux.org is running on one
DNS server. If it fails, everything is down. Whatever
you decide, it should include plans for another DNS
server for the domain.

My server was acting as a secondary for pdxlinux.org for
a while but was removed when I declined to upgrade to
BIND 9. I run Tinydns, which I think is more secure and
inter-operates with BIND.

I think it's more important to have a secondary name server
than to turn off your secondaries because you don't like
the software they're running. But that's just the way I think.

Sorry for asking this question here, but I can't google it, been trying for
over an
hour. Can't find it in the SARC site, either.

Maybe a good flame Mike will divert attention from the recent drama on the
list.

Is there a virus or something that knocks out the cd-rom drive in win9x?
I've gone
through all of my regular tools. Damn thing just got my laptop, too. I know
the
drive is fine, because it works great when I reboot into RH 8.0. I'd dump
the win,
but I must run access for a customer.

I've seen three good cd-rom drives unavail in "my computer" on win98 and
win95 in
the last two weeks. All in different locations, all had current virus
protection and
whatnot.

Sign me-- Totally Stumped.

I don't think that's important. My reason for mentioning it

My memory of Bitstream fonts is that they went out of their way to
make installation difficult. You had to go through an installation
process that involved typing in your details and a magic number of
some sort to allow the installation to continue. Is it still like
this?

Are you writing that from personal experience?  ...because mine differs by
180 degrees.

It works HORRIBLY with two people and really doesn't start to show pay-off
until you get up to ten or twelve, in my experience.

With a few people, it's almost impossible to distinguish rogue behavior
from a change in the group's overall goals.  The more people, the more the
goals of the group are narrowly defined (being the intersection of the
goals of many people).

With small numbers, disagreement becomes divisive and arguments degrade
quickly into personal opinions and unfounded bias.  With many, more call
is made for a person to explain their actions and petty bias doesn't fly.

Also, as one wise software developer wrote, all bugs are transparent to
the thousand eyes.

Consider that more people with the power to make change means more people
with the responsibility to change things for the better.

I am always amazed at the lengths people will go to preserve the
known-faulty hierarchical regimes.

I know i should not voice my opinion because i am not from Portland 
area, but AFAIK this is the only way Debianistas can get Debian to look 
mainstream.  That is by hijacking websites wherever they can and 
increasing the numbers at netcraft.  [Flame suit on]

just to add some levity.

You're absolutely right.  I apologize for the knee-jerk reaction.

> My reason for mentioning it is to get some fault tolerance going.

And that is, of course, really important.

I just want to make sure that if the decision was made for ideological
reasons, the person who made it was not acting on behalf of PLUG.

If there were technical reasons related to the particular limitations of
the systems donated to us by our benefactors, then I'm sorry for any
thought I gave to the contrary.

The thread about the PLUG web site has grown on this list, and I have
not been following it at all.  I've been defending myself in the
"plug-web" list (see http://lists.pdxlinux.org/lurker/) and trying to
get the web team back on-topic again.  I cannot defend myself on two
fronts, though I shall have to try as my professional reputation may be
at stake here.  I'm being libelled left and right.

The people who suggested moving the server to another domain or box are
in my opinion arrogant and rude individuals who should not be taken very
seriously by the more businesslike and professional amoung us.

Jeme is probably mentally ill.  He sees nazi's everywhere or something.


Everyone please look at the site, and, if you want to help out:

 * test in several browsers, report to the "plug-web" list your
findings, after checking (lurker) for already reported...

 * Try the trouble ticket system if you have a feature request or
problem report.  Please don't post "test bugs" anymore... Let's get to
the real business of doing this web site right.

 * Review the markup via CVS as well.  Please compare the code in the
"oldsite" module to that in the "website" module.  What do you
experience web developers see there?  Please tell the list, as we are in
need of informed opinion here.  There's been enough ranting and raving
for one week.

 * Does anyone have any articles you would like published?  Submit them
to plug-web for approval and they will be!

 * Any feature requests?  Post a trouble ticket please!

 * Got "not invented here"?  Learn to overcome it.

Jeme can argue with himself for the rest of the thread for all I care. 
This is silly.

Steven Adam's trip about "debian xemacs facism" is just as ridiculous. 
Every time I mention Debian, the Red Hat and Mandrake users attempt to
shoot me down for it, it seems.

I am being libelled by people who are portraying me in a false light in
order to attempt to gain political advantage.

And how did this thread get split across two lists?  Announce announce
announce, let's appeal to the masses for anyone willing to join our anti
Karl anti Debian hate group?

Let's get the discussion back to just THE WEB SITE.  Not on "not
invented here", not on delusions that a power struggle exists (there are
nazis around every corner!)

No, not really... it's more often said that "he thinks his way is the

Yes!  And let's get back on topic, folks.

What about that fancy new web site, uh?  What do you REALLY think?

What would you like to see there?

Written any good articles lately?  Want a publisher?

"take control"?  Like the people who editted the old site who removed my
name from the consultants list, who made almost zero mention of Debian,
who plugged MD and RH bunches, who wrote that horrid kludge you'll find
in the oldsite module of http://cvs.pdxlinux.org/ ?

There is no "defense" here.  There is only an assertion that you have the
right (and the "write") and nobody gets anything published without
submitting it to you for approval.

I hope Alan forgives speaking to a question directed at him.

The problem is that you have assumed dictatorial control over the server,
CVS repository, and production website and are trying to force all
discussion of the topic into the narrow focus of what you've already done
and how we can all help achieve your goals on your terms.

"childish"?  "megalomaniac"?  Who are you trying to be?  "the best
interests of PLUG"... are not served by fools who wish to cast out all
authority, dude.  Is divide and concor your motto?  Are you anti
organization?

That is not true, and has not been for more than 24 hours.  When it says
that "something needs to be written here", it means "on the website",
not "in the list".  Get it?  Want it fixed?  Fix it.  Show us the code,

If you found a link to my resume at the top of a page, you have browsed
to http://people.pdxlinux.org/~karlheg somehow.  Did your browser just
take you there on it's own?  Or did you click there?  What browser if it
did, please?  There's a "link" element at the top leading to the

make a "credits" page soon.)

This isn't a business, Karl.  This is a club where people get together and
share and generally interact socially.

And, by the way, it's "arrogant and rude" to suggest a democratic forum
where openness prevails and steps are made to avoid the consolidation of
power in too few hands.

Right.  That's why we have the gulag.  This is where we throw people who
question the authority of Karl.

Is it really true that mental illness is the most probable explanation for
my behavior?  Even if I'm totally wrong and way off-base, isn't it much
more likely that I'm just, say, MISTAKEN or CONFUSED than "mentally ill"?

Really, I think your method says more about yourself than me.

> Everyone please look at the site, and, if you want to help out:

Note that "helping out" means submitting your ideas to Karl for approval.

You can do an anonymous CVS checkout of Karl's code and "review" it and
submit patches to Karl for consideration.  He maintains complete,
autocratic control of the CVS checkin process and the export of data to
the live website.  He will brook no question of that divine right.  In
fact, if you question it, he'll suggest you leave PLUG and form your own
group.

ok, I'm not going to claim any great experience, but the
behavior you describe has a simple explanation that doesn't
fit your ideology.  successful groups of a dozen or so
people are successful because the people in the group have
the right temperament to form a successful group.  people
who can't function in the group won't stay in the group.
disruptive people who do stay in a group will alienate
people who want to work as a group, and the group will never
get very large, or fail entirely.  so the data set is
systematically biased.

I don't think you can toss an arbitrary set of people
together, follow the rules that seem to work for one
particular successful group, and expect a happy ending.  I
don't think there are any social/political structures that
are suitable for all occasions.

my experience with groups of random people with no structure
is that nothing gets done.  they rarely reach any consensus,
and nobody takes initiative or responsibility for anything.
when someone does, he becomes a de facto leader, and if he's
politic enough, people happily follow his lead.

> I am always amazed at the lengths people will go to preserve the

anytime someone makes a gross generalization like this, I'm
automatically skeptical.  (anyone should be skeptical of my
gross generalizations too; they're usually motivated by
rhetorical effect.)

  I was not clear. I have installed only 6 fonts from the cdrom; those are
the only ones I use for business documents. Following the procedures in
'fontinst' to permit LaTeX to recognize those fonts is highly complex and
requires manual intervention each step along the way.

  Those who believe they need "a couple hundred fonts" need to read about
communications and typography. :-)

  Nope. Not at all. (Errata: it was about 4 years ago I bought the cdrom,
not earlier.)

  Installing the fonts is as complex as selecting the one(s) you want from
the sample sheet and using the font ID number(s) for the family to copy from
the cdrom to the hard drive.

  The complexity is working through the instructions in 'fontinst' so that
LaTeX will recognize -- and use -- fonts other than Computer Modern.

  how long will it take someone to port linux to it?

  According to the current issue of The Economist, a team of university
scientists have created a working quantum computer out of a single chloride
ion. Using lasers, the ion can have the orbital (i.e., energy) levels of its
electrons shifted and the states can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously.
They've got it working with up to 10 ions now, but expect to have hundreds
signed up for a massively parallel system comparatively soon.

  I assume that Microsoft began work on a new version of WindowsQE (that's
Quantum Electons); can a port of linux be far behind?

Thanks to everyone who responded to my request for information - I think
I've got some good ideas now on how to go about this (sorry, Rob, I

Pacific Solutions carries a number of the Zalman cooling fans, btw.  But I

Yes, there are some here who think they're morally superior (*cough* Jeme
*cough*) because of the distro they choose, but that's not the majority. I
happily use SuSE 8.1, even though it's the most commercial of the bunch. I
like to think I'm funding Open Source development at the very least.
That's how I "live with myself". :-)

Anyway, not everyone is a distro bigot. Don't let it get you down (not you
Russ, the other guy).

Committees can be structured to be more or less self selecting. For 
instance, the FREE GEEK policy making body has a rule that anyone who 
attends two consecutive meetings becomes part of the official decision 
making process on their third meeting. Miss three meetings in a row, and 
you're back at square one. (Gotta go to two consecutive meetings again 
before being part of official decisions.) Anyone can show up and weigh 
in on the discussion -- you just can't "vote" (participate in the 
consensus, whatever) unless you've done the prerequisite time.

PLUG could probably adapt this kind of approach if we see the need to 
become a bit more formal about how things are done, and still want to 
keep the flavor of "you're a member if you say you're a member".

"Opressive tyrannies"? Are you serious? Nevermind, don't answer that. I

So how do the successful open source projects work? Is there no hierarchy
to responsibility? I seriously doubt it? I'm pretty certain there's always
a gatekeeper or a committee, or organization to at least try to ensure the
quality of the project. Which is, as it should be, and is living proof
that your "everyone has the same power to express themselves" is hippy
dippy crap.

The web site, however, is a mini IT operation. It's code that has to be
maintained and updated on a server that has to be maintained. I would say
that qualifies as an IT undertaking.

Aside from the politics of the issue, I think the graphics/stylesheet
could use some help. I'm no graphical expert. My best site
(http://www.lmdcresidentialgrantprogram.com, not my own but one I did as
an employee of my company) has much more smooth graphics. Something this
site could use for starters.

Why? I'm not really trying to take sides on this issue. I don't really
know the particulars of what you've done to the site or how it was
organized before. As a web developer, I too would have an inclination to
clean up the code and make it more maintainable. I wouldn't make it editor
specific, but other than that I see no problem with cleaning up the code.

Excellent!  Constructive advice!  Thank you, Preston, for setting the
example and beginning this thread.

I will look over that site and see what you did there.

Does anyone know anything about the quirks of Navigator 4.7x's CSS
handling?  What standards level did they acheive with it, I wonder?

I think that SuSE puts out a fine distro.  So does Red Hat and
Mandrake.  They are all wonderful.  I just happen to prefer using
Debian.  I don't get anything if you use Debian.  I do get something if
you contribute to it, however.

One must always be aware of the difference between a person's actual
character and the character they are portrayed or perceived as by people
with incomplete information or skewed points of view.

Yet I agree with your position wrt the need for controlled access to the
CVS repository, etc.

It is not really editor specific; it's ascii text marked up with
xhtml-1.0 transitional.  It's just that it's a lot easier to work from
XEmacs with all of it's magic modes configured.  The editor support
makes the work go a lot faster.

I don't think I've overstepped any bounds.  None had been defined in
some minds, and the ones that were are not overstepped in others.  Some
folks are even applauding the new site.

Agreed, re Jeme's "trip".

Please keep in mind, mostly what I'm speaking of (just my initial look) is making sure fonts and graphics are anti-aliased.

What in the hell is going on here? Are there crazy pills in the PLUG water? 
Karl hijacks the PLUG web site. Totally pisses on years of work by the 
official Web volunteers. Throws away bales of content. And there are still 
people making excuses for him? And Karl is still seeking feedback on style?  
And complaining about not being appreciated? Shit Karl, did you even read 
those links you posted on consensus? Elvis in a cupcake! I vote for taking 
the site away from the current host,  they do not exercise good security or 
responsibility. David and Karl, is this how you treat your paying customers? 
A responsible host would have restored the original site as soon as the 
breach was discovered, and privileges removed from the person who did it.

This kind of crap is why I do not get more involved in PLUG. There are many 
fine people in the group, unfortunately the crazies rule.

Can you believe this soap opera that's going on with this?

I know this is supposed to be an open group that allows anyone that wants
to participate to be able to join, but we have to draw the line when
certain people do more flaming, arguing, slandering and bitching than
contributing in a constructive manner.

There is no where (that I have seen) that says the group can't ban people
from participating for behaving in a destructive manner.  I believe there
are people that are being a lot more destructive than helpful.

There are options that I see that would resolve this.

1.  Move the server out of control of the current admin
Either by restricting (or removing) access to the server, or by just
deeming another server to be the PLUG server altogether.

2.  Create a separate User Group
People who are not happy with this list and/or group can start their own
user group.  They can organize their own separate meetings, web site,
mailing list, etc.

3.  Do not participate in the list/group
People who are not happy with this list and/or group can participate in
another User Group that already exists

This is just silly.

Who wants to help start a Cascadia LUG?
Oregon LUG (oregonlug.com/.org is available)
a new branch of Portland LUG... portlandlug.org is available..
just a though.
...but I think it's unfair that the user group would have to resort to
moving everything just because of a few people with differences. Karl
should have went back to the other site until this was approved by more
people.... but he thinks otherwise.

Well, given that... I'd be willing to become a member of an alternate
portland linux user group and volunteer with anything that would be needed
to help out.

It's a new year. A new fresh start. There should be
alternatives...otherwise things like Linux wouldn't exist. We have several
local linux groups, another one wouldn't hurt.

By the way I run Debian, RedHat, Conectiva, Gentoo, SuSE, Slackware, and

I am a vi bigot though ;)  None of my servers has Emacs.

Subject: [PLUG] Horizontal lines in OO Writer document
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0301081024180.8504-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I am trying to create a copy of a regulatory form in OO-Writer because the
original is a pdf file that does not permit filling in on-screen. I got most
of it out with pstotext before gs found something it didn't like and exited
with an error code.

  So, I have the text in (well, most of it so far) and I'm putting pretty
little boxes around the different parts so whoever reviews this doesn't
freak out because it looks different from the "official" form. However, I'm
having one heck of a time adding horizontal (and vertical) rules within the
paragraph boxes. The OO help doesn't.

  When I select Insert -> Horizontal line from the main menu, I am given a
choice of all sorts of pretty lines, but the only "plain" one -- at the top
of the list -- is a narrow box. I want only a thin line, but apparently I
have no option for a single line with a width of my choice.

  Is there a way of adding such lines to a Writer document? Or, do I have to
do the whole thing as a table?

TIA,

Rich

Have to agree here. Some people just feel that everyone MUST share their
opinion. Cake or Death!

I use FreeBSD, MacOSX, Solaris, RedHat and Windows when forced. I
wouldn't really use any linux at all if I didn't require it for
commercial support of some applications (which is the only reason for
using RedHat), and I use MacOSX more actively than any of the others.
I'm not going to give myself a coronary because someone else loves it or
doesn't. Everyone should use what they want to. If people want to use
OS/2, let em. I won't, but who cares? 

Besides, if it's some form of unix implementation with very few
exceptions, the same software can be run on all of the platforms I
mentioned above. And any linux distribution. It's about how you like to
use and administrate your machine, not what name badge it wears.

  I figured out (by trial-and-error) that a line of underscore characters
prints as a nice, thin horizontal rule.
 
  But, is there a way to place short, vertical lines on a page? That I
cannot find in the menus or help index. I can create a frame into which I
can type vertical text. I can align two or three items vertically, but
that's it.

  Anyone know more?

Me, and, I'll admit it. My 'home-office/job' system runs well enough to keep 
my boss from stepping in and forcing me to convert to MS-XCrud.

I've had a few recent successes (such as installing Flash into Mozilla myself 
so I could watch a 'swf' file an e-mail buddy sent me)  but for bigger 
things, I am mostly clueless and rather terrified to experiment too much.

Still haven't gotten avi's to play after all these months - I have lesiure 
time but that's for PLAYING the music/game, etc. Futzing with 'what's not 
happening now, what to I have to twiddle next, or download at 2.6Kb/sec' is 
NOT lesiure ...

I usually plonk out the Debian stuff, how to administer a workplace server, I 
don't program in perl etc. I first learned programming in BASIC in the early 
70's, and (without knowing it) I -LOVED- the feeling of riding shotgun with 
the execution. You didn't need to know what a compiler was - Just give the 
computer a list of orders (numbered to keep them straight) hit RUN, and it 
will do as many of them as it can FIRST, and only complain when it finally 
hits a nasty. If you couldn't figure out why that line number bombed, most 
times you could GOTO around it for now, run out the rest of the code anyways, 
and not be forced to fix everything perfect first before getting a even a 
glimpse of what your instructions do... What days!

But I liked the feeling that a computer will TRY to execute everything it can 
first, and complain later, if at all. Then came Pascal, followed by a desire 
to try out a splitting maul. Things went downhill from there, when computers 
said "LOGIN:" instead of "READY>"

But every once in a LONG while, someone asks a question that even I figured 
out, and I can contribute (a bit.)

Not that I'm aware of, unless you count the OS as a virus.  More than
likely, you aren't praying enough when the P'n'P detects devices.  I've
seen this many times, and the solution is never the same.  Sometimes you
have to boot into "Safe Mode", remove all CD type devices from the
device manager, then reboot.  Other times you have to change the
settings of the CD drive, like change it from slave to master, or put it
on a different controller.  Sometimes it helps to turn of the BIOS
detection of the drive (windows will find it anyway, most of the time). 
Sometimes it helps to turn on the BIOS detection of the drive.  The idea
is to change something, anything, and see what's there after it reboots.

Good Luck

Subject: [PLUG] linux-wlan-ng and differently configured networks
Message-ID: <200301081157.18166.tjg@craigelachie.org>

Hi all,

Got an interesting one. I just got a new Thinkpad R31 running Gentoo 1.4rc1.

The R31 has build in 802.11b using the Prism 2.5 chipset. On install the 
wireless worked right off using the Orinoco drivers, but there were some 
serious issues, so I build the linux-wlan-ng stuff. It's configuration is far 
nicer than the last linux-wlan-ng stuff I used, so i'm wondering if it is 
possible to do something I've never tried before...

My wireless net at home is different from my wireless net at the office. We 
run WEP at work, the SSID is different etc. It's simple to manually change 
wlan.conf to look at the wireless options for the office or home, but it's 
kind of annoying too. 

What I'd like to do is have the wlan0 device look at the SSID of the network 
that it finds and configure itself automagically for that network. Is this 
possible?

Thanks.

Set your ESSID string to  Any  .. when you bring your device up it will
associate with ESSID of the AP that is producing the strongest signal in
the area. 

However, this won't be able to automagically set your WEP string..
you'll have to do that when associated to your work AP. This can be done
from the command line with   iwconfig , part of the wireless-tools
package.  iwconfig eth0 enc XXXX-XXXX see the man page for more
information..

One of the biggest differences between Open Source and the rest is that we 
have a community that nurtures itself and lugs like Plug are an example of 
this.

By the way, the first lab in the Linux Installation and Configuration class 
I teach at PCC is to subscribe to PLUG.  Students are always impressed with 
the content, especially the high signal to noise ratio.

Lets all work to keep PLUG a great member of the community.

Right. The SSID string is only of real use in areas where there are 
overlapping wireless networks. In most cases, the 'any' string is what 
you want.

On a related note, I'm right now installing Red Hat 8.0 on a Compaq
Evo using the built-in wavelan card. It's very cool: boot cd, type
"linux askmethod" at the boot prompt, tell it the nfs server and path, 
et voila!

If I'd worked a bit harder, I could have retrieved the installation
image from a PXE server. :-)

And since I maintain a fully patched installation tree (via anaconda
and Eric Harrison's online HOWTO), complete with some locally built
RPMS, there's no post-installation or patching needed.

No cables. No fuss. No unnecessary reboots.

           A CALL FOR A MORATORIUM ON PERSONAL ATTACKS

People,

    We seem to have a number of very serious problems in the PLUG
group at the moment, which I'm going to try to address in
next few days.  This will involve a number of postings, some
personal email, some phone calls, and very likely result in
an meeting or two.

    In the mean time, let's have a moratorium on flames and
personal attacks on the mailing lists - especially on
plug at pdxLinux.org.  We used to have a well described reputation
for having an excellent mailing list - with very few off topic
postings and very very few personal attacks.  However, we have
changed in the last year or so; and personal attacks have
become common place.  LET'S CHANGE THIS BACK - at least for
a week or two.

    Also, don't respond to personal attacks.  It isn't worth
the effort and only fuels the flames.  If you feel you must
respond, either do it privately or write a response that only
addresses PLUG and/or Linux issues and doesn't respond to the
personal nature of the attack.


                                          Sincerely,
                                          David Mandel

Thanks for this input.

The new wlan stuff has SSID specific config files, so I have the following 
three files...

wlancfg-DEFAULT
wlancfg-RENTRAK
wlancfg-WLAN

It seems to me that the connection "knows" the SSID of the network that it's 
finding, so it should be able to "know" which config file to use. I'm 
probably completely wrong about this, but it sure would be a nice thing to 
figure out if I'm not.

Are you using Partition magic? 

Are you manually assigning drive letters, or letting Winderz do it? When drive 
letters get goofed up, drives disappear.

Well, you can create a frame, then make borders where you want lines. I don't 
know of any word processor that does it any other way. Doesn't mean there 
isn't another way....

The pipe key makes a nice vertical line one line tall.

And that's all I know for the nonce.

Am I missing something, or is what you are looking for a drawing tool?
In Word Perfect, you'd click Insert > Shape > ... and choose from a list
of lines, Draw Line, Horizontal Line, Vertical Line, etc. Since there's
something similar in MS Word, I expected to find it in OO Writer. When I
start OO Writer up, I have a tool bar down the left side of the window.
The top icon says "Insert" when I hover over it. The next line says,
"Insert Fields." The third one says "Insert Objects," and the fourth one
says "Show Draw Functions." Under that one I found the expected
selection of line, rectangle, ellipse, etc.

To test it, I typed a few lines on the page with some white space around
them, and put one of them over on the right side. Then, I drew a
horizontal line between the two on the left, and a vertical line between
them and the one on the right.

Is that the kind of line you're looking for?

I don't know if Rich likes it, but I think it's swell. And the lines can be 
dragged and positioned anywhere. Thanks Dick!

  WordPerfect (from versions 4.0-8) allowed the user to place horizontal and
vertical lines (of user-selected thickness) wherever they were wanted. The
length, starting position and ending position were all set from a dialog
box. This is what I was using for 18 years and I became used to being able
to do such things.

  I suppose that the next time I do something like this I'll use another
WordPerfect trick: make the whole document a table and resize or merge cells
as required to achieve the desired look.

  FWIW, I sent a copy of the file to the state agency so they could put it
on their Web site, along with the useless pdf version. I also pointed them
to the OpenOffice.org Web site and suggested that they consider saving money
by adopting OO. Then they could use the template I provided them. :-)

there's nothing about "draw functions" on the Insert menu.

  And, as I wrote in response to Carla's message, I used WordPerfect for 18

This sounds like just the ticket, then. MS Word has similar drawing tools, I 
used to use them a lot back when I *shudder* worked for others. If one wished 
one's missive to be deemed important, it had to be tarted up with colorful 
boxes, drop-shadows, and silly clipart. The upside was it was OK to spend 2 
hours finely-crafting a two-paragraph memo.

Position your cursor over the 'show draw functions' button, then click and 
hold on the tiny arrow in the top-right corner of the icon. A menu showing 
the line tools pops up. You have to hold the mouse button down for a couple 
of seconds. Easy as pie. :)

Glad to help. It's like someone else mentioned earlier today: I lurk
around and learn lots of stuff on this list, and every once in awhile (2
months or longer!) something comes up that I can answer.

I used Word Perfect 5.1 from the late 80's through 1995 or so (my wife
still uses it on a 286 for transcription work!), then switched to WP 7
when I got a machine with Win95. WP 8 came with my most recent machine
along with Win98 (about 2 years ago). There are still a few features I
don't want to do without on that version. Too bad they didn't keep up
with their Linux port.

Alas, the highest resolution the hardware supports is 800 x 600, so that
feature doesn't help me. Good thing their change of font size works.
I've been playing with the tutorial this afternoon, and actually drew
and printed a simple floor plan!

Thanks for the reminder of where I saw the virtual screen size thing.

Not sure. I start it from a terminal with ./cycas-real. It opens a
window for itself.

I'll have to take a look at this CYCAS.  I'm a big fan of xfig and have 
drawn my entire house to scale (+/- 2").  It has a bit of a learning curve, 
but the help system is the best I've ever seen for any app, and I'm 
constantly finding new things it can do.

One of the things that is really nice is the ability to toggle layers 
(visible or not), currently xfig only uses a numbering system, but the 
author has told me that soon the layers will be able to be labeled--does 
CYCAS have such a thing?

For example, I have one layer devoted to notes to myself so I can print, say 
the First Floor Electric: 5, 20, 25, 50.  I bit of a pain, but the city's 
plans reviewers all commented on how nice it looked.

Message-ID: <3E1CD8FB.61F3252C@attbi.com>

I'm fiddling with Cycas, a CAD system from Germany. I successfully
completed the basic tutorial exercises and decided to see what a print
out looked like. Then, I remembered that I hadn't set up a printer on
this system yet, and was a bit trepidatious about how successful that
would be. Turns out to be simple.

I plugged my HP 656c into the Thinkpad's USB port, clicked on the red
hat > System Settings > Printing. This brought up a password entry box
for root access. Then it started up the Red Hat Printer Config utility.
Clicking on "new" brings up a series of fill-in-the-blank boxes, that
had no problem finding everything it needed to support the HP 656c with
LPD. It was so quick and boring, that I wondered if it had done anything
at all. It actually took me a couple of minutes longer to figure out how
to set the print scale in Cycas, but once I had done that, and hit
print, the printer came to life and from it, a respectable drawing
emerged.

The last time I tried to set up the HP 656c was with a slightly older
distribution that didn't include hpijs. I eventually managed to get it
working with CUPS, but it took a lot longer.

I haven't played with it yet, but CYCAS does support layers. From a
first glance, it looks as if there are only 10 layers, which is nowhere
near enough for serious work. I don't know if that's a limitation of the
free version, or just where they are at this stage of development. The
layers can be named, though.

Oops! I just took a closer look. There's a dialog box with 10 entries,
the first one named Layer 0 by default and all the rest named ***
Unregistered ***. There are also 10 tabs, numbered 0 through 9, and each
one of those has 10 entries too, so that's 100 layers. Not unreasonable,
although Corel CAD, and even Generic CAD (DOS program from the 80's) had
255 layers.

While it is possible to tell CYCAS to use feet or inches, the default is
metric, and dimensions entered by hand have to be done in centimeters.
That's a bit of a nuisance. I haven't tried showing dimensions, yet, so
I don't know how well they convert.

  WP/8 for linux was one reason I put off changing from RH 6.2 for so long.
:-)

  I was thinking of Carla's comment about OO's drawing tool being the same
as in winWord as I was cooking dinner. I left the "working for others" world
at the end of June, 1993. Every place I had worked used mainframes, minis or
PCs running DOS. In April, 1994 I added a new GIS to my toolbox and had to
go out and buy/install win3.1. I think it was 1996 or 7 that I had to
upgrade to win95 for the latest version of that application.

  So, other than very early versions of Microsoft C and FORTRAN compilers,
I've never used any Microsoft application other than their operating
systems. My knowledge of winWord is based on the frustrated rants of folks I
know who unloaded on me when they had to leave WordPerfect for that. I've
not used Excel, PowerPoint, Access, Outlook or IE, either. No wonder I'm
clueless on how apps like OO and AbiWord work!

  I went from DOS to linux, and the only windoze apps I've used are the GIS
(which I stopped upgrading in 1997) and the GPS mission
planning/differential correction software that I still pay through the nose
to keep fairly current. What a deprived adulthood I've had!

  Since I lack the experience in "The Micosoft Way to True Enlightenment and
Office Productivity" I ask your patience with the non-intuitive questions I
ask here.

Thanks all,

Rich

I understand that the next RHL release will use CUPS by default.  Hope
this doesn't rain on your (or anyone's) parade.  I have found cups to be
useful, however and not problematic.

Great.  And let it be known that I am explicitly NOT standing behind
David sticking my tounge out at those young chest thumping attackers. 
I'm standing beside him and a little forward, with my arms crossed and
eyebrows raised, codefending the honor and reputation of both myself and
this group.

The google search that turned up that document undoubtedly turned up
quite a lot more than that.  What else was there, folks?

I hereby second David's motion to call a moratorium on personal
attacks.

Neither these lists nor the #orlug channel are there for that sort of
off topic, childish, unprofessional, and crass discussion...  Most of us
believe these attacks are motivated out of jealously.  Grow up.

So who showed up over the last year or two and changed all that?  Shall
we research that in the archives?

Yes, please.  I am very interested in hearing more constructive remarks
concerning the new website.

I should write up a good article concerning the "not invented here
syndrome" and publish it.  Perhaps I'll use "Embracing Insanity" as one
of my references?  There also was a good article on jealously motivated
personal attacks, "hazing" and unsportsmanlike conduct, etc.
somewhere...  If not, it should be written up somewhere, shouldn't it?

Hope to see the list traffic mature and get back on topic now.  G'night
folks.  Take care.

  When I moved the network from RH 5.2 to 6.1 I had all sorts of problems
printing from the client host. The problems were recalcitrant and
intermittent; also very difficult to fix. That's when I replaced lpr with
CUPS. The problems went away and haven't been back.

  FWIW, I paid for the Easy Software PrintPro drivers to get the maximum
from my HP DeskJet 2500C. I've not been disappointed. My only disappointment
with ESW is their policy of charging through the roof for support. I think
I've had two occasions in the past 2-3 years when I couldn't solve the
printing problem myself -- at first. When they wanted $250 to answer e-mail
questions, I turned here and also figured it out myself. Took quite a while,
but it was accomplished.

Poor lad, perhaps we can rectify this sad lack in your life experience. :)

Something cool I just noticed is Open Office has anchor point options for both 
frames, and for lines and objects created with the drawing tools. The main 
ones being page-relative, or paragraph-relative. With old MS Word, there were 
no anchors, and lines and text frames were independent of the text, so there 
was lots of tedious hand-editing when any changes were made to the text. 
Delete a sentence, lines had to realigned manually. I do like these modren 
times.

Actually, CUPS wasn't the problem. It worked as advertised and was
reasonably easy for me to follow. The part that gave me trouble was
getting hpijs installed, and RH has done that for me this time.

I've got a print-server machine running lprng.  My laptop is setup with

recently loaded Mandrake 9 on my wife's box and setup CUPS on that machine
to also sent printjobs to the print-server, but it doesn't work.  I've got
CUPS configured identially as it is on the laptop which can print, but
nothing.  It seems like the jobs aren't making it to the printserver.

Any ideas on how to debug this?

You could try ethereal on the link.  Maybe attach strace to the lpd
(or equivalent) process on the server side.  Also, at least with
old-fashioned lpd, you can stop the print server (partially) and then
look at the print job in the queue before it gets sent to the printer.
Old-fashioned lpd puts two files in the spool directory, the job
content and a control file.  Examining the control file can sometimes
yield some useful information about what might be going wrong.
Another thing to check is hosts.lpd (or equivalent) to see if your
client host has permission to submit print jobs.

So the rabble rousers have managed to convince you that I am some sort
of rouge administrator?  That was what they attempted, and apparently
several of you believe it to be the case.  It is simply not true.  If
you question my ability as a systems administrator, I invite you to ask
for a login account on that machine, so you can look around and see how
it is configured and maintained.  I believe you will find everything in
good working order and ship-shape.  I've been working on Linux systems
since 1994.  I know my way around.  This ain't my first rodeo, Cowboys.

I'm NOT going to resign my duties as the PLUG server's administrator. 
This email is to provide rationale for my actions, so everyone please
read it, and don't hit reply until you've read it all (some of you need
to read it twice first).  I've not done anything wrong.  I simply did my
job.  The old site was not moving forward.  When I went in to see what I
could do to add some content, I saw an amateurish mess of PHP and what
looked like hand-typed non-validating markup with poor formatting and
lots of syntactical errors in the markup.  It was a total blotch. 
Anybody with a web browser who knows anything at all about writing web
sites could "view source" from their "Edit" menu and see it.  That
reflects on us all, as a group, does it not?

The site URL's had oddball query strings attached to them in order to
access sub pages, rather than "directory" style URL's.  The URL's where
hard to remember and looked like the usual amateur PHP nonsense.  IMO,
query strings are designed for passing parameters to pages or scripts
that return variable content, such as search engines, not for access to
sub content.  It was driven by an experimental (exploratory code) engine
written in PHP, and every sub page was accessed via "index.php?mumble".

The layout was done using nested tables with gif's in some cells to make
a border around the content.  It looked like a porn site rip off, IMO. 
Potentially one of the main problems with that design, I am given to
understand, is that it presents barriers to accessibility to the
visually handicapped.  A table free design is much easier for an aural
browser to parse and navigate.  That was a large force behind the
impetus to move HTML away from the table in a table layouting, I gather.

The site was not, as far as I can tell, well designed for easy drop-in
of new content, such as news items or meeting agenda announcements.  The
consultants listing was a static page edittable only by the "Content
Editor".  My own listing was conspicuously absent from that list!  (As
was any mention of Debian GNU/Linux, a major distro with LOTS of
contributions in use by all distros).  I certainly fixed THAT "feature"
in short order!  And I will do so without removing anyone else's
listing.  I will implement a system where each consultant may edit their
own listing's meta data at will.  They may also have an @pdxlinux.org
email address now, as well as a people.pdxlinux.org/~loginid web site. 
That did not exist before I became the system administrator (aka
"root").

Note that the person who believe I had put my resume at the top of the
site was mistaken.  My resume is at the top of
http://people.pdxlinux.org/~karlheg, not at the top of
http://www.pdxlinux.org/ as he had so graciously insinuated. ;)

The DNS is presently still somewhat broken; there have been several
sunday morning breakdowns that I had no way to fix myself.  I had to
wait until Monday morning for someone else to fix it.  In the meantime,
the lists broke.  Here's my solution proposal:

https://bugs.pdxlinux.org/mantis/view_bug_advanced_page.php?f_id=0000018
 We can discuss that bug on it's thread in "plug-web".

We had someone acting as backup DNS for the domain, but that person had
difficulty getting his end of the setup configured.  I emailed the
configuration snippet that was required at his end, but somehow it never
worked right.  I am very certain that it was a correct configuration, as
sent, because I compared it carefully with one that I know was working. 
It's really not all that complicated, once you've read the DNS book (The
O'Reilly "Cricket" book) and experimented with it a little bit.  The
stealth master link between drizzle.pdxlinux.org and ns.netule.net works
just fine, for instance.  I don't have access to all of the nameserver's
involved, and cannot even begin to troubleshoot.

It would be nice to set up an LDAP server with PLUG contact information
available.  Doing so would be a good learning experience for those
involved.

It had been decided at the PLUG web group meeting that I would work on a
new website backend.  I went to work on that right away.  I did not work
full time on it, but did manage to make some progress between other
projects.  I also had to do quite a lot of reading and thinking over of
how it would be used by a "Content Editor" -- what procedures they would
need to follow, in order to edit and create content.  I immediatly
dropped the idea of a database driven design in favor of one that uses
plain files in a filesystem.  They are so much more accessible!

John Hampton posted a layout design mockup, and I had thought that
everyone agreed that it was likeable enough to use, so I went ahead and
used it for the Mason "autohandler" template.  The overall look of the
entire site can be changed simply by changing the autohandler template
and the CSS stylesheets.  Redesign mockups may be posted to a URL and
that URL submitted to the plug-web list for review, and maybe we'll pick
another layout.  I want a table-free design that works well in all
browsers, even ones for the blind.  His initial design used nested
tables, and I've removed them in favor of stacked "div"'s.

Last week I decided to give PLUG a holiday gift, of the new website, and
then moved new.pdxlinux.org to www.pdxlinux.org in the httpd.conf, and
brought the new stuff online.  I was convinced that I had done the right
thing, and that people would either not even notice or be pleasantly
surprised when they noticed the changed sheets.  I was hoping that by
doing so before it was content-complete I would get plenty of response,
something that had not happened before when I would post to the list
about it.  Earlier, when it was still at the staging location, I had
gotten almost zero feedback, and now I've got a little (and a lot of OT
flak).

If you look right now, you'll find that much of the old site content is
in place.  It took a total of 2 hours work to port that much of it.  I
will work on it more as time permits.  I am a full time college student
and plan to make straight A's.  My coursework must take precedence, but
I will still have time for finishing the code parts of the PLUG site.  I
will implement that consultant's listing, and I will finish up my search
engine work.  (It's a masterpeice!  Look at my code!  I was very pleased
with myself for having "reinvented" ;-) that design pattern.)

Openoffice is more of a Desktop Publishing System.  People with
experience with Frame Maker, or Page Maker often have an easier time
with the difference of oo and MS Word.  To some extent everything in OO
is a frame.

You've totally missed the point.  Consistently, you've missed this point.

Nobody is questioning your technical expertise nor your prowess as a
programmer, system administrator, or web developer.

This is not a technical issue and it cannot be solved by a script, module,
or application server.

Your "rationale" is only a technical one.  You explain your technical
reasons for making technical decisions.  You do not explain why you felt
you had (and still feel you have) the authority to wipe the PLUG website
and update it in your own timeframe, retain exclusive control of the cvs
repository, grant access privileges at your personal discretion, and have
the final word on all choices regarding the server, the site, and the
project.

It might run just great (though, I'm not convinced it does).  Mousilini
made the trains run on time.  If all you want is EFFECTIVENESS, then
dictatorial rule is a top choice.  If you want freedom, high morale,
respect, dignity, and community, dictatorial rule is just about the worst
method you could choose.  I think PLUG is more committed to the latter
than the former.  The outrage of the majority of the respondents on the
topic bolsters this belief in me.

> I've not done anything wrong.  I simply did my job.

You seized the job and removed the authority of the group and replaced it
with your own.

A link to your personal site is in the top line of the website's index
page when viewed in lynx which interprets the <link href=""> construction
exactly the same as a <a href=""> construction.  So it's a link to your
homepage, not a link to your resume directly.  But otherwise, everything
in the original person's statement is true.

I think this means that you are a single point of failure.  That's just
one of the MANY reasons why people think it's a really bad idea to have
you as the sole root user.

[more technical data removed]

Actually, it was decided that there would be a backend group and you
volunteered as a member.  You came to none of the backend meetings and
when you began work on the project, you made it publicly known that if
someone were to work with you, they would have to do things your way using
your tools and your design.

You clearly didn't want to work with anyone else and nobody wanted to work
with you.

So you purposely broke the site so that people would notice your work and
hopefully praise you for it?

And we are the whim of your time constraints since you retain solitary
control over cvs commits and export to the production site.

I do recall you implying that you might give someone else permission if
you believed they agreed with you completely on how things should be done.

You want the dissidents to shut up and go away.

That's not how you build a community.

Phil,

  Are /etc/printcap the same on both portables? I assume that both clients
define the printer as remote and use the IPP syntax for identifying the
server, so other than different printer names in /etc/printcap, I've no
ideas rght now.

I have a hard drive that I want to probably get some info off of, but I 
cannot even read the files.

a fdisk shows:

/dev/hdb1 	* 1 	3 	24066 	fd Linux Raid Autodetect
/dev/hdb2   	  4    2213    17751825	f  Win95 Ext'd (LBA)

......
/dev/hdb7					Swap
/dev/hdb8				   Linux Raid Autodetect

I want to look at hdb8.

I dont want to fubar the hd so I tried dd and cp over to a partition on 
/dev/hda

The files seem to get there ok, but...

When i try browseing them with midnight commander I get:

"File 'netsaint' exists but can not be stat-ed: Input/output error."


It says this for every directory and finally shows the directories that 
it will but not any that said were not stat-ed.  Some directories show 
up in other words.

If I try to cd on the command line to these directories i get:

bash: cd: vscoggins: Input/output error

And can't get there.

Even mounting the drive directly has the same effects.

I am wondering if fsck would fix it, but since it is raided I worry.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks

I've only had time for a brief look at OO, so what I want may be in
there and I just haven't found out what they call it.

I Word Perfect 8, there is a feature where one may divide a landscape
mode 8-1/2 x 11 page in two to get 5-1/2 x 8-1/2 pages on the same
sheet. One may then, when two sided  printing, "Print as booklet" and WP
will send the pages in the right order for folding into a booklet. In
other words, if you have an eight page document, you print odd pages
first and get page 1 and 8 on one sheet, page 3 and 6 on the next. Turn
them over and get pages 2 and 7 on the back of 1 and 8, and 4 and 5 on
the back of 3 and 6. When you stack them, and fold them down the center,
you get the booklet with the pages in order, 1 through 8.

Do you know if OO has a similar feature, and if so, what it's called?

My favorite part on the website is how its says, "I" everywhere.
and in the meta tags... all Karl.
for instance this page, http://www.pdxlinux.org/resources/consultants.html

It says, " I am taking a break to think over how to implement this
feature..."

When did the PLUG site become Karls personal project? If you use words
like "I" everywhere, it represents the PLUG site as a personal site.

If you're going to type in temporary content, use words like "WE" or "The
Web Team will be considering various methods to implement these
features..."

Not "I"

  But Rich needs a Rosetta stone to translate the pictures into words so he
can understand them. And I so much prefer a clean, uncluttered screen that I
block out all the marginalia on the window frames.

  I realize that I'm being curmudgeonly, but I will argue that if you have
menus on an application then _all_ functions should be accessible from the
menus. I'd prefer to turn off all icons and work only with the text. But,
that's because I'm an old fart, I guess. :-)

No, it's because you like good UI design.  OOo's UI design is poor, to say
the least without using profanity :)

  Dick Steffens asked if OO could do the same brochure calculations and
layout as WordPerfect. The anwer is "yes"; from the Print menu. From the
help menu ("brochures"):

"Brochure

"Mark this option to print your document in brochure format. This occurs as
follows:

"If you print a document in portrait on a landscape page, two opposing sides
in a brochure will be printed next to each other. If you have a printer with
double-sided printing capability, then you can create an entire brochure
from your document without have to collate the pages later. If you have a
printer that only has single-sided printing capability, then you can achieve
this effect by first printing out all the fronts with theRight pages option
marked, then re-inserting the entire paper stack in your printer and
printing all the backs with the Left pages option marked. All you have to do
here is pay attention to the direction in which your printer prints."

  PLUG at work as it's supposed to operate.

Colin,

  Yeah, ain't I a pain? :-)

  I think the crappiness of OO comes from their decision to look and work
just like MS Orifice. I tried having a discussion with them about the
advantages of being different -- and better -- but it was equivalent to
tying to push water uphill. And about as satisfying.

  One of the questions I asked was, "Why would anyone dump their Microsoft
applications for which they already paid when they bought their computer for
a different vendor's effort that looks, feels and does exactly the same?"
Thunderous silence.

  This is why I want to have my half-dozen Type1 fonts recognized by LaTeX
and I'll start writing document classes for letters, invoices and other
business documents.

In-Reply-To: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0301082232360.32502-100000@shell1.aracnet.com>
References: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0301082232360.32502-100000@shell1.aracnet.com>
Message-ID: <200301091204.31002.aschlemm@attbi.com>

Does the remote server do any sort of smart print filtering? I tried 
using CUPS and it worked beautifully for my locally connected injet 
printer. When I need a laser printer I have to use a remote printer 
that is connected to an OpenBSD server that runs "apsfilter" that does 
some sort of smart filtering based upon the print data received. For 
some reason the remote printer prints out huge top margins on the pages 
when I use CUPS to send postscript output to the remote printer. For 
this reason I had to remove CUPS and use LPRng instead.

I think I would have been OK with CUPS if I could have figured out how 
to get it pass the print data to the remote system without it 
performing any local filtering first but this doesn't seem to be the 
way CUPS works. With LPRng I just have a forwarding queue that does no 
local filtering and the OpenBSD print server works fine with this setup 
as it handles the raw Postscript output from all of my Linux programs 
with no problems.

Subject: [PLUG] Mandrake 9's msec 3 - stop the permission madness!
Message-ID: <20030109202353.959DC4643@joseph.doink.com>

I'd like to run msec at level 3 (default is 2) so that I will get
security checks reported to me by email, among other things.  The
problem with level 3 is that it keeps a watchful eye on
permissions in the filesystem and changes some of them from what
I explicitly set, e.g. I can set /home/local to be readable by
all and sometime later it will only be readable by root.

I've read some doc's for msec and it says that I can alter the
default behavior via the /etc/security/msec/level.local file, in
which I have this content:

set_security_conf CHECK_PERMS no

But, that apparently isn't enough to fix my problem.  I don't
know how to "restart" msec; it's not a service in
/etc/rc.d/init.d that I can tell.  So, I rebooted with the new
config and it didn't work.  My permissions still change out of my
control.

I've gone back to msec level 2 for now, but I'd really like to go
back to level 3.  How can I do this?

Thanks muchly....

Message-ID: <1042147556.4499.81.camel@red>

Giving the technical nature of this message and relevance
to Linux, I'm hoping you don't consider this spam.

My company is offering a one-day DNS training class. It's
unique in that it covers BIND and Tinydns equally. In the
past we focused on BIND and included only an introduction
to Tinydns. We now see Tinydns being deployed by large
organizations who see it as a way to increase security
and performance while eliminating the need to upgrade their
DNS software every few months to avoid attack. Therefore,
our course treats Tinydns as one of the mainstream DNS
servers.

The course covers Windows DNS as well but it gets less
coverage.

The course is next week on Wednesday, January 15 at 9:00 am
in Tigard. Details are here:

http://www.alcpress.com/training/schedule/dnsboot

PLUG members will get the same discount as PANUG and
BizNix members.

Depending on your distribution it may vary but those based on SysV
(Redhat, SuSE, Mandrake, ...) getty is controlled from lines in
/etc/inittab.
   Find the _*offending*_ line(s) with getty in them and comment them out.  
Danger Will Robison.  getty my be controlling your virtual terminals and 
if you disable them all you could prevent yourself from logging on.

After commenting those you are brave enough to ... restart (?) init by 
typing
	telinit Q

A better idea would be to determine why you're getting those messages and 
then fixing the problem if possible.


Good luck,

   Boucher Bill Reintroduced

   The Boucher Bill:
   http://www.infoworld.com/articles/hn/xml/03/01/08/030108hncopying.xml?
   s=IDGNS to reform the DMCA has been reintroduced in the new session of
   Congress. The bill would re-legalize fair use copying, even if the
   user has to get around a copy-restriction system to do it. Time to
   fire off a letter to get your member of Congress to join as a
   co-sponsor.

   Remember, you can't reform all of politics at once. You can't testify
   before the Senate (and you probably can't get a meeting with your
   Senator). So you can't beat Jack Valenti on his own terms. But you can
   get letters in your Representative's face, you can meet with your
   Representative in person, and you can persuade that one person to
   sponsor that one reform.

   That's the important lesson of the "free Dmitry" movement: pick a
   small injustice that you understand and fix it. Learn. Then tackle the
   next one.

   It's called "fair use" for a reason. People, like the Elcomsoft jury,
   think it's fair. Advocating for fairness--how hard can that be? Go to
   those constituent meetings, people.

Well this is interesting as it is humorous.
My wife's system came down with a virus and I did a full wipe and 
re-install. We are still using Win98 on the desktops since we are both avid 
game players. I absolutely refuse to use Outlook in any form (I use 
Eudora), and I have not used "Infection Explosion" (IE) since version 4.0 ( 
I use Opera).
Anyway, I re-installed the Office 97 sr2 on my wife's computer and then 
went to the Microsoft Update site  for any security patches.
This was my response from MS (LOL):

Further to that... To use Office XP, you have to have Win2K, SP3 or 
WinXP. Office XP supposedly won't install on anything earlier.

I'm still searching for the "Golden BB" application. No one makes a 
personal finance package THAT CONNECTS TO MY BANK AND DOWNLOADS MY 
TRANSACTIONS.

Until then, I'm stuck in Windows. I refuse to dual boot, as that's a 
waste of time and resources. If I'm going to set up two systems, I'll 
have them sit side by side, not on top of each other.

Actually I'm not that surprised because most companies I know don't even
support software 5 years old.  Most I deal with have a revision rule even.
 Meaning that if you have a product of ours that is older then 2 or 4
revisions (or whatever the number) we no longer support it.  I'm surprise
they even give you an option for support on a 5+ yr old product.  That is
nice in itself.  Ok, it is hard and a bit confusing and not very friendly
but the option is there.

I can volunteer secondary DNS.  I have a server on the end of a 10Mb
pipe running tinydns (Infow datacenter).

I mirror my tinydns config with a friend of mine, so in essence, you
would also have a terciary DNS server if you wanted to utilize it.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0301100638040.1969-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  Normally my daily, incremental tape backup runs at 1:00am. The Tandberg
drive is on a Tekram fast-wide SCSI adapter. This morning, the drive was lit
up at 6 am: power light, busy light, dirty tape light. They would go off,
then come back on. The monitor was filled with SCSI bus error messages.

  I could not kill the process. As I needed to shut down the system to
re-attach everything to the UPS, I ran shutdown, but the SCSI bus wouldn't
listen to the kernel. As the process had reached 'power down', I just held
in the power button on the box until it quit.

  Yesterday's /var/log/message showed a SCSI bus parity error;

  ... over and over.

  Obviously, I have a problem here. But, I've no idea what to do about this.
I would greatly appreciate your help in 1) understanding what this all means
so that 2) I can either replace a failed part or fix the problem.

All,

I have the screenshot section done (always looking for more, of course).
I like having local blood instead of just pulling images down from the
Internet because it shows how strong Linux really is locally. Besides, I
think yours are higher quality anyway.

Also, I haven't had the chance to make changes to the training modules
on MWVLUG's web sight yet but I am working on it. I got a lot of
feedback ranging from "the backgrounds are too dark" to "wouldn't it be
great if you color coded _each_ part of the command to help new users
read the parts and work out what the commands do?" These are just two
among many others. 

I expect to have this finished by sometime mid next week.

I have been really busy these past couple of weeks and am very
encouraged by what I have heard by the greater community about Linux use
for their business and personal needs.

I'll keep you posted.

Finally, on a semi-related note, Meryll Lynch spilled the beans on their
use of Linux this morning. It's seems now that cutting costs is a
"really hip thing to do these days" and these guys are returning value
to their shareholders in spades! They've been kind of hinting at this
but they absolutely went all out here:

Cooper,

  Take a look at the February Linux Journal. There's a really interesting
article on ILS (Integrated Library Software) that started in New Zealand and
has defined the Earth's rotation to move east to the US. Similar to the
K12-linux effort, this one focuses on school libraries, small regional
libraries and others that cannot afford the $20,000+ for proprietary
software or have better use for the money.

  It might be something libraries outside Multnomah County might consider.

  The same Linux Journal issue also has a fascinating article on replacing
Microsoft Exchange. They did it on the IBM z/series big iron, but it can now
be done on any server. If companies have used a lack of linux equivalent to
Exchange as a reason to not switch, they have now lost that excuse.

  What is interesting -- but not surprising -- is that the linux version
scales much higher than does the Microsoft offering.

  Both articles are certainly worth reading, especially for you folks in the
It's Technical! (IT) industry.

Seems to be a SCSI kind of day.  I've been having backup problems for 
several weeks and seeing lots of SCSI time outs and resets in my logs.  
Then this morning when I rebooted (lame idea) to get the applix deamon 
running again my NIC reported errors and now I can't access the computer 
over the network.  Back to SCSI - my tape backup went from less than three 
hours to over six.
   I walked away during the reboot when the probing for modules took
really long and the boot messages didn't have anything too unusual about
the SCSI cards.  I had to get to work so I left it hanging until this
evening or tomorrow to sort out.  Funny thing is I was in the process of
upgrading the system any way.  Had all the new parts and was working out
the process to follow.  New SCSI controller, HD, more RAM.  How to get the 
must-have data off the old drives before they go in to a new system.

I've seen similar to this and I'm pretty sure it's tied to your syslog
stuff below.  Where I've seen it is with an old Equinox multiport board.  
The only thing I could figure out is there is a small memory leak -
incremental.  After the two systems that have these old Equinox boards in
them run for about 250 days they lock up - or at least the NIC stops
responding.  The three finger dance is all that works and several times
that didn't and I resorted to the 'The Big Red One'.  Well actually a
normal sized beige one.

Maybe my ramblings will help or give some good ideas for others that
really understand this kernel stuff.

For what it's worth "use real mode to power down" didn't work with my 
system (AT supply, Tyan Tiger MB, Mandrake 9).  At this point I think 
the supply just won't do that.

Usually what I do in this case is open the Style List (F11), select the
paragraph style,  right click to pull up the context menu and then
select Modify.

Set up the paragraph style to be the way I want, and then I'm on
my way.  That document usually becomes a template, although for me
that means I copy it, strip out the content and then add in what I
need.  From the File->Save As menu I see that Template is an option,
but I've never read about how to use them properly.

One very nice feature about Frame Maker that I miss is the ability
to import styles from document to document.

One other thought I had was that maybe we should set up an OpenOffice.org
mailing list for PLUG.  It would be a nice way to get application
specific support, since people may not think about joining the PLUG
list for OOo help :)

Colin,

  I already have a number of "styles" saved as templates. I'll see if I can
modify the styles in place. Good idea. The whole paradigm is new for me so
ideas of looking at the style of a template did not just occur to me.
 
> One very nice feature about Frame Maker that I miss is the ability to

  I believe that one _can_ do this in OO by fully designing the template.
I've not futzed with it enough to learn all the cute things one can have it
do for me.

  This is a _really_ good idea, but let's take it one step beyond OO.

  A large amount of traffic on this mail list relates to system/network
setup and administration. That's quite reasonable because 1) that's where
most of us need help from time to time and B) that's what most denizens of
the list do for a living (when working, of course). But, there's more to
linux than the kernel and the GNU utiliities: the end-user applications.

  We do ask and answer questions on all sorts of apps, and I don't think
that we need a separate mail list for them. But, I think it would be a great
idea to feature this help on the Web site. We might list the applications in
which one or more of us has expertise and, perhaps, encourage questions on
them.

  Of the many mail lists to which I subscribe out of interest and need, the
OpenOffice users list is joined only when I have a question for them. Then I
unsubscribe. I do this because it has a huge amount of traffic and far too
much -- for _me_ -- is Microsoft related. So I pop on and off that list.
But, the end user application support here has been outstanding and I'd
support making it a more prominent feature of what we do.

To my knowledge it's not possible to get systems that use AT power 
supplies to power down unless the motherboard has some way to cut off 
the power coming from the power supply. The power switch on AT power 
supplies is connected directly to the power supply which is different 
than what ATX power supplies which use an electronic on/off in which 
the mobo can turn off the system via power management features.

You can see this with an ATX as if the power goes out it's possible to 
specify what the system should do when power is restored in the CMOS 
settings. I have my ATX systems set to stay off when the power comes 
back on. You can't do this with an AT power supply because as long as 
the power switch is in the closed position the system will power up 
when power is restored.

I have one system that still uses an AT power supply and I have to do 
special things when the power goes out to get the UPS that is connected 
to it to power down the system. If I don't do this my UPS's battery 
will be severely drained since the system will continue to run even 
though the operating system has already been halted. Draining the UPS 
battery below a certain point isn't a good thing to do since it can 
reduce the life of the battery.

An ATX power supply will continue to feed power to the mobo even when 
the system is turned off. I know most of my mobos have a red LED that 
is illuminated to indicate power is still being supplied to the mobo 
even when the system isn't powered on and running. This is why ATX 
power supplies also have an external switch on them so you can you can 
turn off the power completely to the mobo if you have to.

Offer to train your coworkers on Linux.  Have weekly or bi-weekly classes.
Start with the GUI (substitute your "GUI" of choice), web browsing, email,
office suites, etc.  Then for those that want to learn more, gradually
teach them more about system administration and configuring services, such
as Apache, Samba, Postfix (or whatever MTA you prefer), etc.

You'll increase your knowledge by preparing for the classes as well as
from the questions you'll receive along the way.  You'll also break down
barriers to deploying Linux in your organization because people will be
more familiar with it.

Everybody wins.

	I may have this wrong, but I think the power supply has to an ATX or
later supply.  IIRC, older AT supplies don't support it.

Actually, that was the gist of the TCO findings. Linux (and unix in 
general) are less expensive to maintain because they require less 
maintenance, and in turn, one admin can take care of many more machines.

The irony is getting thick. PLUG's secondary server WAS running
Tinydns before it was removed as a secondary because it was not
running BIND9. This list is great for its entertainment value if

Oh, ok.  Hmm.. I don't see why that would be a problem.  I have a
corporate setup where the external DNS server was tinydns and axfrdns
with ACL's to allow Sprint secondaries to pull zone files.  Worked like
a charm.

Even the Windows admins could modify the data file after I gave them a
quick training session.

No, I'm sure it was a configuration problem. It's just funny how
people embrace "designer software" and are closed to solutions
that work at least as well or better. In the case of BIND 9,
people probably think "Gee, I have to generate encryption keys to
get it to work. This must mean that this baby is really secure",
when the reality is that it provides little, if any improvement
and simpler techniques can provide the same or better functionality.

Yes, of course it works well. Many of us are doing the same thing.
I think the issue was tinydns and axfrdns not supporting the
TSIG and/or DNSSEC.

So what's this mean in the real world? My cranky DNS guru, who uses djbdns, 
likes to rant about what a horrid hack TSIG is, and he doesn't think much of 
DNSSEC either. Are they necessary for DNS to work, or are they lame BIND 
hacks, as the aforementioned cranky guru says?

Right.  It's a bunch of jealous turkeys chasing off the person who
advocates a distro they don't market, who's better looking and
healthier, and who has better answers to people's questions.  They are
jealous of a better engineer and a better technician.

It's "politics" -- Nerdy jealous sicko politics.  Perhaps this is their
proof that "politics is usefull after all".  I hope they have a good
laugh and pitcher of beer each over it.  And eat one of those fire
cheese shit bomb sandwiches too.

"Wipe the old plug website" sounds like "wipe their ass for them",
doesn't it?  Those lazy clods had themselves "programmed" into a corner
and couldn't see the way out of it.

I think that technical rationale for technical decisions over technical
issues is appropriate for this list and the web site, and that the petty
jealousy and hate politics is not.  I am NOT a nerd and won't hang with
them.

It's hard to fly like and eagle when you're surrounded by turkeys.

I was not acting as a "dictator" at all.  The site content is ported
straight from the old...  Oh, but I removed some of the flippant and
irreverant babble from the description of the LATT meeting, which has
always failed to live up to my expectations, perhaps due to the attitude
projected by the "Zot" rules of conduct.  Have a beer, you pencil necked

Your trip, not mine.  I did my job.  Root is by nature a position of
responsibility and authority.  I did nothing wrong, and I will never
sway from that point of view.

> [irrelevant technical data deleted]

Technical data is, according to ... ah, of course, it IS Jeme!
irrelevant on the PLUG list!  Of course.  Jeme, I suggest you join
another group.  This is where engineers (used to) like to hang out. 
Debates are won or lost based on scientific and logical validity, not
based on psychotic trips about people seizing control and hate-political
rabble rouse mongering.

You and about two others have whined and complained loud enough to give
the impression of there being a large contingent of people who wish to
have me deposed as PLUG server admin and de-facto webmaster (vs Content
Editor).  Perhaps that is a true statement... I like to think that the
more intelligent amoung the PLUG netizenry are not stupid enough to fall
for your stuffed uniforms on the wall gambit.

Unfortunately, David Mandel is not one of them.  He likes your tounges
in his butt and the beer beer beer.  David is not a healthy man, nor a
productive worker.  He is aging more quickly than a man who maintains
his physical body would.  He drinks too much coffee and not enough
water.  He gets too little excercise.  He's shown me time and again that
he is not really very technically savvy when it comes to Linux and
details of internal systems operation.

Then your browser is broken... ah, no, it is not.  That link is supposed
to link to the author's URL, and it does.  I believe that more than one
author link is supported by browsers, and if not, that an Authors page
should be created.

You folks will of course remove my name from that list, just like you
removed my name from the consultants listing, right?  Politics in

And that just means that you are still having fun with your "hate hour".
Oh, and I'm not the sole root user, Jeme.  David Mandel has root also.

Ed Z. or whoever it was has an attitude about me also.  He believed for
some reason that I was not willing to accomodate him when he wanted to
use an alternate means of performing the zone transfer.  He never
outlined a detailed technical plan for how it would work.  He came off
like he thought it was obvious how it should be set up, and that I was a
stupid arrogant kid who could not see the obvious thing.

He should have written a decent paragraph or two explaining HOW he
wanted to set things up.  He never did that, as I recall.

Would they be able to demonstrate a better way of doing things, and then
train me to work their way, Jeme?  If you all can show me a better
working environment than XEmacs and CVS, then SHOW IT TO ME.  Prove it.

I think you are an arrogant bunch of sript kiddie losers.

It was not broken; it was fixed.  The new site is BETTER than the old
one, from the ground up.  Show me the code, Jeme.  Take a good long
look.  You are doing this to me because you are JEALOUS.  Plain and
simple.  JEALOUS.  David and Goof right along with you.

By the end of the week someone else would have writes, provided they
took the initiative to submit a patch or two that I could use as guage
of their ability to handle the responsibility skillfully enough not to
botch.php the site.

The final clause of that sentence once again asserts your belief that I
am unwilling to listen to any other way of doing things.  If you have a
better way to implement the site, then outline it in detail on the
discussion list.  You are like a stupid redneck that gets drunk on swill
beer out of a silvered can and complains about the government, but
obviously cannot provide a better solution than the one that government
officials have come up with.  If you have a better way of doing things,
then present it, in detail.  Quit complaining, and SHOW US YOUR
SOLUTION.

You're still on that trip, eh?  Right; and the tear gas canister
implementation is almost complete.  Every time you visit the site it
will click your eardrums like a dog and shout down your neck while it
sprays you in the face with pepper spray...  (spray a little on your
fingernails to keep yourself from biting them, Jeme.)

They pepper sprayed babies!  (they brought babies to a riot!)

> That's not how you build a community.

You are the one who began bickering and arguing... No, Geoff was.  Then
you and that rude kid started in... well anyway, I believe that, aside
from a few emotionally compelled responses that are like the chess moves
my enemy wants me to make, I have remained rational and have attempted
to bring the topic back to the web site, not on alleged power grabs.

The whole power grab trip you are one is delusional and patheticly
stupid.  You're sick.  I'm not here to prevent others from having input
as to the content or even the implementation of the PLUG website.  I am
here to facilitate it's orderly creation and maintainence.

Facilitate.  Not argue with an idiot, but facilitate the creation and
improvement of the PLUG web presence.  The old site was IMO
unmaintainable and poorly executed.  I fixed it.

Subject: [PLUG] Help!!!  PC won't boot to flash bios
Message-ID: <1042256329.1015.8.camel@Balrog.jimwebb.net>

Help!!!!!!!  I just built a box with an ASUS A7V333MB, AthlonXP 2400+
CPU, 512 MB pc 2700 RAM, Maxtor 40 GB HDD, AGP GeForce 4 video (Jaton). 
After I originally built it several days ago, I noticed that the bios
wasn't listing my cpu speed correctly.  Tech support suggested as well
as Asus that I flash the bios to the latest and greatest.  I just
flashed the bios with aflash and updated the bios from 11 version to 15
version.  After I shut off the power I invoked the default settings, hit
F10 for my award bios and restarted the pc.  I changed the settings for
the bios to the ones that I wanted and saved again.  It wouldn't boot up
after that.  Something about system error and insert a system disc and
hit enter.  I realized that I was in some trouble here and tried to
flash the bios to the original one, but I could not boot up to the
floppy even I placed that at the head of the list for bootup devices.

Help somebody!!!

TIA,

Jim.

My experience is that "cranky gurus" don't like fancy new things like
that simply because they don't understand the problem or the solution
very well and are too lazy to read up on it.

That is correct, of course.  There was no "soft off" before ATX, unless
you count sending the shut off signal to a UPS over it's serial
connection.

The "apcupsd" setup came with shutdown scripts for manageing that.  That

If the new admin has any questions or concerns re the present
configuration on the "drizzle.pdxlinux.org" server, per may write to
"karlheg at hegbloom.net", and I'll assist.

I won't leave you out in the cold.  There are no booby traps and nothing
has been deconfigured.  I'm not a jealous kook with a revenge fetish.

There are a few packages on "hold" (please use the "aptitude" package
manaement interace to maintain this) (and I don't want to hear it, Jeme,
so just put a fingernail in it.) that should remain so... they are local
builds or needed to support the present kernel.

Actually, the kernel should be rebuilt, to support newest EVMS tools... 
I goofed and they mismatch right now, but it still works fine provided
you don't try to add a new volume or anything.  To do that, you'll need
to boot on a rebuilt kernel with support for the latest EVMS to match
the EVMS toolset.  It's not a difficult process, let me know if you
require assitance.  I'll walk you through it in a shared "screen"
session (no root access required; just group "src", IIRC.)

The kernel for that box needs to be patched or it won't boot there! 
Please take a good look at what patches are applied to it to support the
volume manager and filesystems in use.  The patche packages are all
installed, and kept current.  Let me know via direct mail if you require
assistance or advice.

Jim,

If you are certain that the BIOS is not accessing the devices correctly
because of a problem with the BIOS's logic (i.e. there are no cable
issues, etc.) then there still is a way out.

CAUTION: What I am about to show you is an _extremely_ sensitive
operation and could render a motherboard useless. PROCEED WITH EXTREME
CAUTION AND MAKE SURE TO WEAR STATIC PROTECTION

1) Boot a working machine that is not particularly vital to your
operations with the BIOS flash disk (having the original BIOS version
code; there's no sense re-burning to the new version until at the very
least things are squared away).

2) While the machine is running, pull the BIOS chip from the motherboard
with a pair of chip-puller tongs. Again I cannot stress enough how
careful you must be doing this; if you bend the motherboard or ground
out one of the contacts you will destroy it.

3) Put the BIOS chip from the new machine in the motherboard, noting
it's orientation. There will be a small half-circle notch on one of the
edges that will match a notch drawn on the motherboard. BE VERY CAREFUL
NOT TO STRESS THE MOTHERBOARD OR BEND THE PINS

4) Select "flash" from the still-running flash application you ran from
the floppy

5) After the application has flashed, exit the application and
completely shut down the machine

6) Put the newly-flashed chip in the new computer and boot

This should boot your computer to the original flash BIOS code. 

Good Luck.

Karl,

I'm sorry but this is bs.  This information can be given by you to the
new sysadmin and doesn't need to be sent to the rest of us.  

I've appreciated the times when you've helped me, but enough is enough. 
TIA,

Jim

Cooper,

Thanks for the help.  Since I sent out my urgent appeal to the list,
I've pulled the cmos battery and applied the default bios settings and
then saved the changes.  I then attempted multiple times to stop the pc
from booting up past the memory screen and was able to access an asus
utility called ezflash.  I then was able to to reflash the bios to the
original version.

What an adrenalin rush.

Do you think that I should reflash the bios piecemeal or stepwise from
version 11 to 15 and stop whenever it works and I can get my pc to both
recognize the cpu correctly, which it did after I flashed the bios to
version 15, and then be able to bootup?

TIA,

Jim

Alright!

Yeah, been there! Another good one is 'rm -rf' on a production server.
That'll do it too. Solution: 'cp -R' from your NFS backup and after
having made sure everything is okay, wash your flush-red face with cool
water. 

And never do it again (hint: find / -type d -name directory_to_delete
-ok {} \; ).

I would. Given this experience might I suggest running out to their web
sight and seeing if the new versions will buy you anything. A lot of
times you'll find $version_one_up_from_the_one_you_have contains a fix
for the CPU reporting issue. Sometimes, though, the fixes listed for
each version have little bearing on your situation. It's not likely you
would need an update that fixes an issue with an Adaptec MegaRAID
controller, for example.

If one were paranoid on this, one does not need the potential for DRM
additions added to the new BIOS versions as a "feature." I seriously
doubt it in this case but reports I am hearing indicate that AMI has
basically said, "we'll give you DRM weather you like it or not" for
their latest BIOS releases.

I didn't care for the way "apcupsd" worked in some ways and so I'm using 
the "backupsd" monitoring daemon from the Linux UPS-HOWTO. It also has 
the ability to do a "killpower" to the UPS although the one in the 
documentation didn't work properly without some changes so I maintain 
my own version of the daemon locally now. 

I also had a a couple of BSD systems that I tried to use "apcupsd" on 
and was also displeased with it and so I ported my "backupsd" to BSD 
with some changes to take into account the differences between Linux's 
System V style init setup and the BSD-style of init. I was amazed how 
much of the coded ported right over to BSD though.

What about updating the boot block area
What about clear ESCD/DMI?

Modern motherboards based on Award BIOS have a boot-block BIOS. This is
small area of the BIOS that doesn't get overwritten when you flash a
BIOS. The boot-block BIOS enables recovery of a corrupted BIOS, and only
has support for the floppy drive.

Hi Carla,

Is the cranky DNS guru me or someone else you know?
I do get cranky at times - and when I do I write a
book. :-) Here's one:

No, TSIG and DNSSEC are not necessary for DNS to work.
Tens of thousands of DNS servers in the world are
running without them. But are they BIND hacks? Well,
that's a great question. The answer is a difficult
one because the DNS world is quite political and
controversial.

TSIG, DNSSEC. NOTIFY, IXFR, and other DNS-related
features are IETF efforts. Many of the people on the
IETF committees have relationships with the people
and companies that have an interest in BIND doing well. 
Some think that the committees make decisions that
ensure the popularity of BIND at the expense of better
software.

Critics of BIND, including the creator of djbdns, Dan
Bernstein - the king of cranky DNS gurus - are critical
of BIND's design. There are numerous reasons why djbdns
enthusiasts think that there's the BIND way and the
right way.

Lets take zone transfers as an example, since I recall
this being the root of the issue with PLUG's decision
to abandon it's non-BIND 9 secondary. A secondary DNS
server needs to stay synchronized with its master so it
gives out the same information (records) as the master.
It does this by asking the primary (master) for a new
copy of the zone file. The master sends the zone file
and the two are synchronized.

Zone files are plain text files, so it doesn't take
much sophistication to move them between computers.
There's no shortage of file transfer protocols. Yet,
BIND uses a file transfer protocol that is unique to
it - and unique to DNS since it was specified in an
IETF RFC. The protocol uses a silly serial number
mechanism to ensure that file transfers only occur
when the master's zone file has changed. Whoever
designed this should be bitch-slapped. Even
experienced DNS administrators update their zone files
but forget to advance the serial number and wonder why
the secondaries are giving out outdated/wrong information.

Normally, secondaries ask the masters if zone files
have changed at fixed intervals, say once an hour.
If the administrator changes a zone file, it could take
up to 59 minutes and 59 seconds for the secondary to
synchronize to the master's zone. During that time, the
secondary will be giving out old/wrong information. So,
the BIND folks created yet another mechanism specific
to BIND and DNS called NOTIFY. When the administrator
reloads a zone on the master, a message is sent to the
secondary telling it "Something has happened here. Try
to guess what it was." The secondary then contacts the
master and discovers it must do a zone transfer.

If zone files are large, such as on the root or gtld
servers, you don't want to move entire files when only
a tiny percentage of the zone file has changed. So the
BIND folks developed yet another BIND-specific protocol
called IXFR, which only moves the changes.

Since BIND has been successfully attacked for years,
the BIND folks need some way to reduce the perception
that BIND (and DNS) is insecure. So, they create yet more
BIND-specific mechanisms to try to improve security. TSIG
and DNSSEC are two of them.

The djbdns folks think it's silly to use these BIND-specific
mechanisms when we already have excellent general purpose
protocols and software to do these things. If you want to
move zone files between computers and they might be large,
you can use rsync, which only moves changes. If you're
concerned that these file transfers should be secure, run
rsync on top of SSL. If you want to be sure you're sending
a zone file to a legitimate secondary and you're not being
spoofed, configure your firewall and, optionally, use
certificates.

BIND zone transfers are backward. They're secondary pull
instead of master push. NOTIFY is a band aid to fix this
ass-backward behavior. With djbdns, administrators are
told to simply push the updated zone file to the secondary
using whatever protocols/software does the job:

rsync
rsync over SSL
scp
cp over a VPN
whatever...

Using these simpler protocols, BIND's silly serial numbers
go away. For a good laugh, read the details of BIND serial
number arithmetic and how you can convince a BIND secondary
to start using a new serial number.

Eliminate BIND and you don't have to worry about drilling a
TCP/53 hole in your firewall to allow zone transfers. Things
get simpler without the BIND nonsense. There are other issues,
such as cache poisoning, that are greatly reduced with common
sense design and implementation.

We don't need no steenking TSIG.

Thanks much, this is great. In my own DNS wanderings it's always been 
frustrating how BIND-centered it is. The Internet does not care how you serve 
up web pages, or move email, or transfer files. But when it comes to DNS- 
matching names to numbers, which seems simple enough- it's as though the 
program is the protocol.

I have no interest in fighting with you, but you're wrong
about what you wrote. I never suggested an alternate means
of performing zone transfers. On or about April 2, 2002, I
volunteered my DNS server to be a secondary for PLUG. You
sent me a message instructing me how to configure my BIND 9
server. I spoke to you on the phone and told you I was
using BIND 8 and moving to Tinydns that week. You said that
you didn't like the cryptic Tinydns syntax and that you'd
configure your BIND 9 to allow normal zone transfers to
occur - so I could run BIND 8 or Tinydns.

Between April 8 and April 23, 2002 I monitored our DNS
servers and noticed that zone transfers were not occurring.
I sent you five email messages telling you the name and IP
address of my server. You responded once and we had this
exchange:

Karl> It should work now.

Ed: It's not. My server was lame for the zone so I
Ed: reconfigured it to be a master. It seems OK now.
Ed: Screw zone transfers. Just let me know if you
Ed: make changes to the zone and I'll manually add them.

This was a workable solution given that PLUG's environment
is pretty static. Sometime later, I noticed that you had
removed my server's NS record from PLUG's domain. From that
point on, PLUG was running with only one NS record.

The keys to having a "good" chance if your board will support an
AthlonXP are the following:

1) BIOS.  Update to BIOS 1009 (Official) or 1010.01A (Beta)
2) Board revision.  (Use http://babelfish.altavista.com to translate)
http://www.asuscom.de/support/techmain/FAQ/amd_mb/faq085b_CPU_Upgrade_II.htm
3) Clock generator chip next to your memory slots.  ICS 94215AF is a
must.
4) Good quality memory.  If you have problems booting, try changing your
VIO to 3.3v from the default of 3.45v.

Good luck!

Sorry, all. I was following up with Jim's BIOS issue with a second
possible solution to the problem. I selected the incorrect message to
reply to.

No, I'm sorry, it's a public statement.  I don't know who will be the
next PLUG admin, and I am not going to expend any effort on finding out
who it is after I sign off.  That person can contact me if they need to,
and the few idiosyncracies of the machine's configuration they need to
know are in that email.  The rest they can get by just looking around
the system.

Further, I want it known that I am not the sort of snot who would
sabotage the system after being run off and forced to quit by those
silly chest thumpers like this.

Drink up, boys.  That's what PLUG is.  It's a beer party.  A beer party
at a loud echoing saloon.  Enjoy your sit around pot bellied little
worlds.  Your egos have won another battle against the windmills of
"restricted freedom".  You are free to have beer.  Knock yourselves out,

done is being magnified by your own snivling.  get
over it.  move on and be the better person!  Jesus, my
7 year old doesnt behave this way.  keeping your

Can we have our PLUG(Portland LINUX USERS group) list

Karl,

A few days ago, Dave Mandel asked for everyone to please drop the
subject, and to stop personal attacks. Everyone else immediately
stopped, except you. You came back and said "Ya, let's stop it
already!" Then proceeded to write message after message continueing the
BS, and now insulting all the participants on this list. I don't
appreciate being called a loser by someone that I have never met.

Since I joined this list, I have developed an opinion of you. Not from
what others say about you, I ignore that. But from watching the
childish, arrogant nonsense that you post, hearing your own twisted
justification for what happened to our web page, and your open-ended
insults to all of us, I think this group will be much better off
without you.

Sorry to the group for posting this, but it's very difficult to keep
quiet when someone like Karl calls my and those I respect "losers."

-Scott

Just for the record, I've never had so much as a sip of alcoholic

However, I do both enjoy the social hours at the Lab and bite my

Okay folks, I've asked this before & I'm asking this again, let's
drop all further talk about the website for a week. That means,
no more flames, no more responses, no more anything concerning
www.pdxlinux.org.

Things are happening with the website, although it's not yet
visible to anyone. It's slow going because Dave had to take a
few steps first, & many of the folks involved do have day jobs,
responsibilities, et cetera, which allow us only a limited amount
of time to devote to this. (Not to make any promises, but I
suspect that within a month or 4 weeks, the website will look
far different than it did not only around the New Year, but
in late December. Stay tuned for further details.)

As for certain individuals who keep dragging the subject back
onto the PLUG list, let me say this: if you don't like what someone
says, learn to filter your email. Procmail is a good choice for
those of you who run a real OS, but I think one can filter email
even with the cheap software that comes pre-loaded on many
computers. Further posts only encourage further posts, no matter
what is said, no matter how much signal or noise is in the message,
& is proving to be as useful as poking a wild animal with a pointy
stick.

Prove to me that, as usual, I'm contributing to an off-topic thread
that is dead & over, by not following up to this email.

Thanks for your co-operation.

Geoff

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0301111314560.19968-100000@shaft.bitmine.net>

Hey all,

I hate printers.

I've got a system here with CUPS, foomatic, and both parport and parportPC
modules installed and seemingly properly configured.

However, nothing seems to happen when you print anything and I can't find
a log of what should have happened.

In fact, `cat /etc/motd > /dev/lp0` doesn't give me anything,
either.  And, in my experience, that works regardless of your
configuration.

I can print the printer's internal test page, so it's not like the printer
is totally bust.

My current guess is that it's a physical connection problem, but wouldn't
CUPS tell me something if that were the case?

Any suggestions helpful.

OK, this is probably off-topic, but I think we need a new topic for
discussion...

Anyone else catch this article in the Portland Tribune:
http://www.portlandtribune.com/archview.cgi?id=15744

It's an interview with a local venture capitalist.  They ask him questions
about where he thinks the Oregon economy is headed and for the most part
he's got some really good observations about how things are different this
time around since Tektronics is a shadow of what it was in the 80's and no
other company in the area now can do what they did back then...

He then gets to the central problem right now - outsourcing of engineering
jobs - and he cites this as a major impediment to economic growth here.
As an example he mentions that Mentor Graphics is investing $40million in
an R&D center in India.  When he asked Mentor why they were doing this, he
got this reply: "they can't hire anyone graduating from engineering
schools here because they're just not prepared, they're just not ready to
go into that sophisticated end of the business." Anybody else find this
statement not only disingenuous, but somewhat insulting?

Of course we know that the real reason is that they can pay Indian
engineers what amounts to minimum wage here.  Given the number of
engineers that are currently out of work (and a lot of us are going back
to school to improve our skills) they could easily staff up an R&D center
here.

Has anyone tried installing Enlightenment with Red Hat 8? I ran it with
7.2 and 7.3, but haven't tried it yet with 8. One thing, I'm afraid I
might screw up the nice fonts or something else. Also, I heard a friend
of mine had problems and couldn't get it to work with 8.0. I'm curious
as to others success.

Message-ID: <187D3A7CAB42A54DB61F1D05F01257220E272C@orsmsx402.jf.intel.com>

My 2 cents worth ... I think there are some very good companies/engineers in
India. Some of these companies operate at SEI CMM Level 5. They take the
right steps to provide software products that meet the stringent quality and
timely delivery requirements of its customers, by institutionalizing
efficient processes (SEI CMM) and best practices (Good Management
Practices). Cost is definitely a magnetizing factor but I don't think it can
sustain without delivering high quality services/products in time. If
offshore companies can't offer commitment to achieve improved productivity,
improved quality, provide value to customer, and accurately predict product
schedule and completion, it will not survive.

Subject: [PLUG] Now they're sending the good jobs to India


OK, this is probably off-topic, but I think we need a new topic for
discussion...

Anyone else catch this article in the Portland Tribune:
http://www.portlandtribune.com/archview.cgi?id=15744

It's an interview with a local venture capitalist.  They ask him questions
about where he thinks the Oregon economy is headed and for the most part
he's got some really good observations about how things are different this
time around since Tektronics is a shadow of what it was in the 80's and no
other company in the area now can do what they did back then...

He then gets to the central problem right now - outsourcing of engineering
jobs - and he cites this as a major impediment to economic growth here.
As an example he mentions that Mentor Graphics is investing $40million in
an R&D center in India.  When he asked Mentor why they were doing this, he
got this reply: "they can't hire anyone graduating from engineering
schools here because they're just not prepared, they're just not ready to
go into that sophisticated end of the business." Anybody else find this
statement not only disingenuous, but somewhat insulting?

Of course we know that the real reason is that they can pay Indian
engineers what amounts to minimum wage here.  Given the number of
engineers that are currently out of work (and a lot of us are going back
to school to improve our skills) they could easily staff up an R&D center
here.

Well, it sounds to me like things probably aren't properly configured. 
When you hit the CUPS web interface, can you print a test page to the
printer?  After you tell it to do that, if nothing happens with the
printer, have a gander at the 'recently printed' section and see if you
could tell it to reprint, look at the status of he job, etc.

Ten go in to your cups config file and increase the logging level. 
You'll get a shitload of debug info sent out to your logs.  Dig through
that and the answer may be there.  Also, I assume, you have hit the info
at linuxprinting.org?  There are mailing lists there - when I had
problems with my Lexmark, the folks there were very helpful - the lead
developer and lead doc writer actuallly figured out my problem.

Not with today's new-fangled printers.  More often than not, that won't
do diddly squat.

Most likely, yes... but that depends on how you have things set up, your
printer, and what your log files are saying.

What kind of printer is it, anyway?  I assume you're using Debian... did
you apt-get cups or build it from source?  Does debian come with some
printer config tool or did you use the web interface or the cli
interface or what to set up your printer?  I would suggest using the web
interface, it worked well for me.

Good luck, let us know how it goes.

I must say that I wrote my first message (with very little data) out of
frustration and laziness.  I'd worked on this machine last night when I
was really sleepy and then got around to it this afternoon assuming it was
a hardware problem.

Well, it was nothing of the sort.

After turning the logging up, I saw log entries that led me to believe
there was a ghostscript error.  But after trying the gs-alladin package
and getting the same result, I went back to GNU ghostscript and looked
into other possibilities.  I ran the foomatic-gswrapper line as given in
the logs from the command-line (modified to read the testprint.ps directly
instead of from stdin) and got no errors.  I then tried piping that out
put to pnm2ppa as is shown in the logfile, but when I typed pnm2<tab>, I
got a beep for my trouble.  Heh.

Turns out, I didn't even have the pnm2ppa package installed.  Pfft.  
Also, the package doesn't really seem to configure itself, so I had to
create a symlink from /etc/ppa/pnm2ppa.conf.hp820 to /etc/pnm2ppa.conf.  
No big deal.

All works seemingly flawlessly now.

What follows is what I was writing when I decided to take Rob's excellent
(and simple) advice to crank up the logging and watch the output.

Yeah, yeah yeah.

I figure it's not the cable because of this:

jbrelin at cyclops:~$ dmesg|grep parport
parport0: PC-style at 0x378 (0x778) [PCSPP,TRISTATE,EPP]
parport0: irq 7 detected
parport0: Printer, HEWLETT-PACKARD DESKJET 820C
lp0: using parport0 (polling).

I guess if the parport driver can tell me what kind of printer it is, then
the cable is doing its job.

No.

That's very good advice.  But the logs appear to only be for the little
webserver.  I'm not getting any print logs whatsoever.

Is there a foomatic log somewhere?

It ain't listed with this: `locate foo|grep log`.

> Also, I assume, you have hit the info at linuxprinting.org?

Aye.

Yeah, I figured out it's likely not physical.

This machine is for somebody else, so it's Debian and everything is from
the Debian archive (except Open Office, which is from a separate archive,
but still installed via apt).

I've used several methods.  Currently, I'm using a spool I built via the
command line with lpadmin and a PPD file generated by the
linuxprinting.org PPD-O-Matic CGI (after selecting my printer and the
suggested pnm2ppa driver).

I've set up printers with CUPS before and it was usually cake.

I basically log every SYN packet that's denied. It generates a lot of 
info, but it's the only way I've been able to distinguish a host that 
port scanning me from one that's looking for a certain vulnerability 
on a certain port.

Not if you're a champion of open source (or Free Software, whichever you
prefer). Blizzard has a history of releasing their attack lawyers to
surppress any behavior they're uncomfortable with. Last I heard, they
had managed to silence the bnetd project with a few good whacks
of the DMCA club.

Message-ID: <1042402890.21068.6.camel@zontar.clueserver.org>

I am in the process of researching this, but maybe someone here knows
off the top of their head...

I am using the Redhat 8.0.92 beta.  It uses glibc 2.3.1 and gcc 3.2.1.  

I have been getting lockups, but I built a stock kernel version
2.4.21-pre3 with the options from the Athlon smp kernel used by Redhat.

It boots fine, but pthreads will *not* function at all.

Does anyone have an idea why?  I was not aware of any dependancies of
pthreads on the kernel version and/or kernel patches needed to support
pthreads.  The pthreads library is the one that comes from the glibc
package.

May not seem like a big deal, but there are a number of things that
depend on pthreads.  (Like anything using Gnome 2.)

Ideas?

I doubt you have to use Qwest's ISP, the nice thing about DSL is, unlike 
cable, being able to choose your ISP. Just find your local ISPs and see what 
kind of service and deals they offer.

I seem to recall reading that Qwest doesn't offer the option of separate
ISPs anymore if you sign up THROUGH them.  It's all MSN.

However, if you go through another ISP to get your DSL, you may or may not
need to use Qwest as your carrier.

I, of course, highly recommend Speakeasy, but I can't say whether or not
they can give you a line out in Seaside.

Make some phone calls and do some web searching.  Be informed before
you've agreed to anything serious.

The two I recommend are Aracnet.com and Hevanet.com.  Both have DSL
service and both have been pretty good to deal with, in my opinion.

You will want to get that arranged ASAP.  MSN is *evil*, even if you do

I am starting to get a handle on the problem.

It seems that the new version of Redhat uses a couple of kernel patches
used by glibc. They do not apply cleanly to the stock kernel. (They use
the o1 scheduler patch and a threading patch.) The thread library they
are using is different as well. They are using the nptl library.

I am starting to suspect that this is the cause of my system hang
problems.

Ah, the joys of betas...

  DSL is a service between your house and your ISP. You are free to select
whomever you want to connect you to the 'Net.
 
> Does anyone have any suggestins for other ISP that can service seaside?

  There used to be a dslreports Web site. They can tell you who's where.

  Local to the Portland/Vancouver area are Aracnet, EasyStreet, DSL-only and
perhaps a couple of others that haven't been sold or folded. Other folks

I don't think Seaside counts as Portland/Vancouver.

I have an Olympus D-100 digital camera which, although
apparently not included in gphoto, can be mounted as a
storage device some other way. This camera is popular
and has many favorable reviews. 

 "(Even works on linux with a little kernel tweak: in
drivers/usb/storage/transport.h, search from "x53" and
change it to "x55". Make sure you have the usb storage
module installed, and then 'mount /dev/sda1 /mnt'.)"

Comments: where is the file drivers/usb/...etc.? Do I
have the USB storage module installed? How can I find
out? If the device likes to call itself /dev/sda1, I
suppose that mounting it should be no problem. 

>From the typical consumer's point of view, access to
digital cameras may be an important factor in the
acceptance of Linux. If digital photography is
important to a person, it might be the only reason why
they need a native Windows partition, unless their
digital camera can be accessed under Linux. It may not
be realistic to expect 100% of digital cameras to be
supported under Linux, but there should be enough of a
choice that optical qualities can be the most
important factor when deciding which digital camera to get.

Ok, My 2 bits....

I have qwest business dsl.  It is fantastic service,
without an outage one or even a temporary slowdown
since connection.  thats the good.  

the bad is here:
First, It took almost two months to get service in my
new location when it was SUPPOSED to be turned up when
I moved in.  

Second, I was quoted 5 different prices in the same
day for the same service, 3 of which came from the
SAME REPRESENTATIVE!

Third, when the line was live, on my BUSINESS account,
they shipped me a USB only dsl modem!  hardly works
with my firewall or routing equipment. another two
weeks later, I had a nice but not much documented
actiontek wireless capable dsl modem/router.  

Lastly, all in all, I would say that I have spent at
the very least 30 hours(highly conservative, 10 hours
in one day alone) on the phone with qwest to get both
the billing and the physical connectivity situations
squared away.  

So, to summarize, the actual connection is fantastic,
and very stable. but the customer service is in no
uncertain terms shit.  absolutely.  I cannot stand
their customer service. their customer service is so
horrible that they ended up reversing two months worth
of charges and giving an additional free month just to
make up for the hassles I had to go through to get
things the way they should have been when I originally
ordered it.  Would I do it again?  hell no.  I would
go with any other isp possible, just so that I didnt
have to deal with the folks at qwest.  Please do your
research before you sign a contract with qwest.  you
will be happier if you do.  

and as far as msn, I do believe that msn is now their
only choice of isp for residential accounts, but other
isp's in the area can contract dsl over qwest's lines.
 gotta love deregulation.

I don't own a digital camera nor do I consider myself a Linux guru but I
might be able to give you a start on how to fix your problem.

Did you try /dev/usb?  There might be a storage storage directory in
there.  It's the only place I could think of.  It could be different if
you're running devfs, some directories can be changed around but they
are still under /dev/usb. (I'm running devfs and this happens with my
Sony Clie)

>  Do I have the USB storage module installed?

Assuming you have your kernel source:

# cd /usr/src/linux
# make menu config

Go to USB Support and enable USB Mass Storage Support.  You might need
to select a special option depending on what media you want mounted.  If
you change things, save the configuration file, rebuild the kernel and
move the bzImage to the proper place on your system and reboot.

If your computer detects your camera, it will output a messege in your
syslog.  Try-

$ dmesg

to see everything or

$ dmesg |grep usb

to see whats on USB.

> I suppose that mounting it should be no problem.

Just like anything else. :)

I hope this helps you out.

P.S.  This is my first post to this group.  Please tell me if I'm wrong
in my advice. :)

USB storage also requires SCSI to be enabled.  This is important to know
if you build your own kernels and use something somewhat old.  (It was
patched in the later kernels.)

You can also get a pcmcia converter for whatever storage media you may
have.  They work just like a drive and requires no tweaks to the
kernel.  (Only works if you have pcmcia however...)

  My name's not Jim, but some ISPs actually have local numbers outside the
metropolitan area. Since I don't track this information I figured that He

You need to load usbstorage module if it does not load by itself
when you plug in the camera, try "modprobe usbstorage".
If it works, look at /proc/scsi/scsi file, your camera will appear
as one of SCSI devices (so it'll show up as /dev/sda if you don't have any
other SCSI devices). If the module does not load, or cannot be found, your
kernel does not have the USB support compiled in and configured properly.

Also, if the camera uses compactflash, you can just get a USB reader for
flash and not mess with getting camera supported (I never got my Vivitar
camera working with USB, it starts giving SCSI resets which never stop,
but the flash from it can be read in the card reader just fine).

There are three different pthread libraries for Linux. There's the original
LinuxThreads that you find in all current distributions (as part of glibc),
then two newer versions, NGPT from IBM, and NPTL from Ulrich Drepper
and Ingol Molnar of Red Hat. Both require kernel features that were added
in the 2.5 kernel, although the changes required for NGPT were very modest
while for NPTL they were quite drastic.

My guess is that the Red Hat beta release uses NPTL for POSIX threads,
and to make it work they back-ported (a lot of) stuff from 2.5 in to their
2.4 kernel. So... if you run a stock 2.4 kernel, NPTL pthreads wouldn't
work.

All this is happening because the original LinuxThreads library had two
serious problems. It wasn't POSIX compliant and performance really sucked for
very large numbers of threads. Both NGPT and NPTL fix both of these problems.
Preliminary testing shows that NPTL out-performs NGPT, at least in certain
scenarios.

Your options are: (1) Get the source code to the older LinuxThreads library,
build it and install that as your pthreads library, (2) run a 2.5 kernel, or
(3) go back to Red Hat's kernel.

I work for an ISP in Spokane and we resell Qwest DSL with us as the ISP.  
Last week when I picked up the phone - I'm not normally customer service -
several potential and new customers were not happy with the response time
dealing with Qwest and MSN.  One had been waiting for months and another
several weeks.  Typically when we're the ISP it takes (officially 5 - 7
business days) but in actuality usually 3 - 5 business days to get them
installed.  Most of that time is is waiting for the router/hub/modem to
arrive at their location.

> service seaside?

Interesting idea.  Can an ISP in one city provide service to someone in
another city?  Well outside their normal service area anyway.  I'll ask,
but you'd be further ahead to take others' advise and find a local ISP.  
There is something to be said for being able to get your fingers around 
someone's neck when you're having difficult day, aka. local support.

Hello all,

Just wanted to let you know there yet another LUG in Portland.  Portland
Linux Users Group (NOT to be confused with Portland Linux/Unix Group) has
been established as an alternative branch of PLUG.   We want the group to
focus on Linux and open-source; pretty much PLUG without the Unix part.  I
am hosting the web site and mailing list on my server.  Robby Russell
designed the web site for PDXLUG.

This is your chance to make a new user group the way you want it to be. 
We are not holding meetings until we get an established user base.  But
you can join the mailing list
(http://www.pdxlug.org/mailman/listinfo/pdxlug) and participate online. 
Help decide which way the web site should go.  Help decide where and when
meetings will be held.  Of course the list is also for good old fashioned
support questions. ;-)

We are not a group of 'PLUG Haters', we would like to peacefully co-exist
with PLUG.  But recent events have made it clear there has to be an
alternative group, or at least an alternative mailing list.

Anyway, comments and questions welcome.  But it won't do any good to
flame, as I won't reply.

Mailing List: http://www.pdxlug.org/mailman/listinfo/pdxlug

Subject: [PLUG] Disk Hardware Problem
Message-ID: <3E230614.6B5CEB67@attbi.com>

Yesterday, my mother-in-law's machine developed a hard disk problem.
When power is applied, the motherboard boots, but says (something to the
effect of hard disk error). I booted with a floppy, but it couldn't find
the hard disk. So, I brought the machine home to have tools available
should they become necessary.

I opened the case, tightened a loose screw for the card that has the
serial port connector, connected the mouse, keyboard, monitor, and
applied power. I hit <DEL> to check out the BIOS settings and found them
correct for the installed drive, so I exited BIOS and waited for the
error message (so I could give you a direct quote). Of course, the
machine booted just fine!

My questions is, should I be concerned that something is about to fail?
What should I be looking for, if it is? Has this happened to anyone
else?

Thanks in advance for any guidance.

That's almost wierd - my grandfather's machine just had the same
problem.  Don't suppose they lived in Redmond, OR?  lol

But of course.  This is always the case.  Somebody needs to type it up
and make it into a law.  *Whenever* you want to show somebody else
exactly what your computer is doing wrong, it works as it should!

It could well have been a loose cable.

It could also be the hard disk going out, the cable being broken, the
IDE controller dying, etc, etc, etc, etc....

Check and make sure he IDE and power cables are snug (IDE at both ends,
power at just the drive end).  You said the serial port plugged in to a
card - ouch... old system?  If so, does the drive plug in to a card, as
well?  Make sure that card is in securely.

Have fun.  :-)

<snip>

I have an Olympus C3030 and it has worked great ever since the early 2.4
kernels. As I remember it wasn't on the supported list for gphoto when I
got it, so I just picked the closest match (the C2000, as I remember). The
list of supported cameras was compiled from user reports, it's not
definitive. Also, there appear to be very few digital camera chipsets out
there - so, if it works with one Olympus it is highly likely to work with
others.

It seems to me that if you are able to use it as a storage device, you
should be able to use it from gphoto or gtkam. What distribution and
kernel are you running?

Lastly, if/when you get it working you should report it the gphoto and/or
gtkam people. That way they can add it to the supported list.

It's probably out there in one of the set's of corollaries to Murphy's
law.

Now that you mention it, that is the first thing I checked. I wiggled
the connectors at both ends of the IDE cable, and pressed them home.
They seemed to be snug. Same with the power connector.

> It could also be the hard disk going out, the cable being broken, the

Hmm. Broken, or weakened and about to finish breaking, cable. I'll have
to keep that in mind for the future.

What I tightened is the bracket that holds the serial port connector.
The serial, parallel, and IDE controllers are all on the mother board.
It's a few years old (Pentium 166), but it's not _that_ old.

Thanks for the advice. I'm hoping this was a fluke. I'm reasonably sure
that it wasn't, and that I'll have to address this again someday. I'll
take a closer look at the cable. I think I've got some others in a
drawer, so I can replace it, if necessary.

  I bought my Olympus D-340L a number of years ago (1996? 1997?) and bought
that brand because the chipset is supported by photopc. That's the software
I've been using ever since. The camera has a serial connection (slow, but so
what?) and it's worked without any problems.

  Perhaps all Olympus cameras work with photopc.

It's possible that one of the cards was loose in the slot, or a cable
might be loose. This could explain why it failed to work at
mom-in-law's house but worked after you brought it to your house. The
jostling around maybe have wiggled it back into contact.

I would recommend opening it up, and re-seating all the cards, giving
them a firm push into their slots. Also make sure all cables are pushed
firmly into place. I used to have a computer who's video card never
seated quite right. I finally had to remove it, slightly bend the piece
that gets screwed to the case, then fasten it back in, which fixed the
problem.

  Has anyone used OO to print digital photographs on glossy paper? I want
good quality prints for inclusion in a report. I've not figured out how to
define a page size of 8.5x11" in the GIMP and put photos and text on that.
I'm interested in your experiences if you've done this.

  Also, has anyone (in addition to me) produced mail merge envelopes from
within OO-1.0.1? I've found that the letters come out nicely (but it would
be great to be able to merge them all to an OO file for editing before
printing, but that's not in the cards -- they go straight to the printer),
but the envelopes suffer print positioning creep.

  The first envelope prints just fine. Each successive envelope prints
slightly higher and to the left. I wasted a bunch of envelopes the first
time I tried this. And, it's a very slow PITA to produce the envelopes
manually, If there's a solution to this, please let me know!

I had a strange problem with a SCSI drive (CD burner).  It was giving me
the fits.  One time it would burn the next not.  Sometimes it showed as
device 3, next as 5 and sometimes not at all.  I took the system _apart_
and while looking at the drive the device ID selector jumper fell off.  
Damn thing was loose.  Installed a new jumper, that was tight, and
everything worked great and still is.  I have that jumper taped to my
monitor to remind me to check _ALL_ connections when things seem strange.
   Then a few weeks ago I went out on a job and the only thing I did after
looking for software/configuration problems was to re-seat the cable for
an IDE Travan 8 tape drive.  Well I did do a little cleaning - kicked out
the bigger dust-bunnys and gave the heads and drive roller a light
cleaning - but it didn't work until I unplugged and re-seated the IDE
cables on the main board.

All you have to do is create a file under /etc/X11/gdm/Sessions with the
name of whatever you want to label to be in your gdm sessions. This file
should contain the full path to the startup program and be executable.

For example, I have the file  /etc/X11/gdm/Sessions/Fluxbox that
contains the line "/usr/local/bin/fluxbox" to launch my fluxbox session.

This is RedHat, so your path might be different with Debian, but I
believe the concept is the same.

BTW, Fluxbox is really a nice system if you haven't tried it and like
fast and visually unobtrusive window managers. It's based on blackbox
and has a few enhancements like tabs. It is written entirely in C++ and
has no library dependencies. It also supports KDE and Gnome apps as
well.

I don't use gdm, but when KDE tries to take over my "Xsession", I just
create a file in my home directory called .xsession and put the single
line:

blackbox

in the newly created file (don't forget to press "enter" at the end of
the line).  This will load blackbox instead of KDE.  You might try
changing login managers if gdm still insists on loading gnome.  I think
xdm is a friendly login manager that doesn't care what window manager is
loaded.

I seem to have answered my question already.. 

go to /etc/gdm/Sessions

vi Blackbox

add the line 
/usr/bin/blackbox
save the file

chmod 755 Blackbox  (chmod u+x Blackbox)

restart gdm with ctl+alt+backspace or your prefered method.. 

the session will be added as a choice in the Session chooser.

This can be done with icewm as well in the same way.

(These directories reflect the Debian Woody machine path names may
change for other systems but it should function the same way)

Many times; costumers would pack up their computer, bring it in to the
store, and it would work just fine.  I used to joke about needing to
take your computer out for a walk more often.  It is a bit frustrating,
knowing in the back of your mind that something is probably wrong, but
until it becomes a more consistent problem, it is impossible to
diagnose.

Loose cables, oxidized connections (re-seating will clean the oxide),
heat build up (does granny stuff her box into a closed cubby?), weak
power supply, bad house power (old wiring, poor grounding, inductive
motors on the same circuit), static, extra stand-off under the
motherboard (flex the case just right and you have a nice short to
ground), the list of possibilities goes on and on.

There really is a question at the bottom regarding images and generating
thumbnails.

Wow, this thread meshes nicely with what I did last night!

I have an old Olympus D-360L (I believe the model that replaced
Rich's) that I've been using for years.

It also has the serial connection and it's freakin' dog slow.  Plus,
there's a bug in gphoto that can cause it to retrieve 4k of an image and
then stop as though it's complete.  To work around that bug and to make
sure my pictures come out with the naming convention that I like, I wrote
a perl script to wrap gphoto (couldn't find a gphoto module) and do some
kludgy error checking and name my files nicely.

Anyway, I got a Radio Shack ("You've got questions, we've got blank
stares.") flyer in my mail and flipped through it.  They are selling the
Dazzle Smart Media Card Reader for 19.95 with a $10 mail-in rebate.  I
figured that was a reasonable enough price point for the potential time
savings of just mounting the card and moving the files.

Well, hell!  It works BEAUTIFULLY. Better than expected, actually.  While
the camera takes about two seconds to save a single picture to the card,
the reader can read and write to the card just about instantly.  I've got
UHCI and USB-storage compiled into my 2.4.20 kernel and there it is on
/dev/sda (with the data in /dev/sda1).  [side question:  What happens when
you've got SCSI hard disks as well?  I only have SCSI CD drives which
are /dev/scd.]

So I added a line to /etc/fstab as follows:
/dev/sda1       /smc            auto    defaults,user,noauto            00

And I made the device read and writable by all.

Now I just mount /smc and move the files from the weird path in which the
camera places them (/smc/dcim/100olymp where the images are named oddly,
but sequentially) to my usual storage location and the card is
clean.  Unmount and pull out the thing.

It's really sweet.

Anyway, I liked the gphoto interface because I could pull the images as
well as thumbnails from the camera.  It appears that the thumbnails were
actually being generated by the camera because they're not on the card.

So I'm writing a different script to grab my pictures off of the smart
card and name them appropriately, but I don't know how to generate the
thumbnails that the camera would use.  I can resize the images, but that's
not exactly what it used to do (near as I can tell).

Dig this:

jbrelin at person:~/pics$ file 20000622-001.jpg 20000622-thumbnail-001.jpg 
20000622-001.jpg:           JPEG image data, EXIF standard 0.73, 10752 x
2048
20000622-thumbnail-001.jpg: JPEG image data 46.38, thumbnail 65x61, 13874
x 13893

What's that all about?  How do I generate thumbnails that aren't simply
scaled down standard JPEGs?

I've done some high quality photo's on glossy.  I used GIMP to do the 
editing of the photos, but used Star Office for the layout and printing. 
( A HP-5550 inkjet)

Very nice results.  (Of course, since then I broke my CUPs setup and 
need to do a bit of tweaking again...)

Mark,

  I didn't expect any problems, but OO is _very_ stange when it comes to
allowing the printers to select the paper tray. With _every_ other
application if there's paper in the manual feed tray of the LJ 5 that is
taken first. OO will tell the printer to ignore that and take paper only
from tray 2. It's annoying. So, I wondered if there'd be a problem with the
color DeskJet.

  Well, guess I'll find out.

Thanks,

Rich

Yeah.  A year ago I posted something here about the same problem.  I
was draining 4 AA camera batteries *just* downloading.  The USB Smart
Media reader (a CompUSA store brand, $29 a year ago) was an immense
improvement.  The _one_ drawback that I've noticed is that with this
kind of data transfer there isn't an easy opportunity to resynchronize
the camera clock.

Hmm.  Well, you've said what you don't want to do, but you haven't
been real clear on the affirmative side: what _do_ you want?

For thumbnails, I've just been using:

  convert -geometry '10%' <ifname> <ofname>

On my Debian/unstable box, "convert" comes from the imagemagick
package.  Salt to taste.

I've got a photo album system for a web server that generates
thumbnails and intermediate preview size images and associated HTML
glue from a single 41-line (including blanks) Makefile.  

Each time I copy off images from the SmartMedia, I create a dated
subdirectory and hardlink the Makefile into that directory.  I retain
the original Olympus-goofy filenames.  I cd to that directory and
type: "make", and after it gets done I've got a nice index.html file
that serves as an entry point in that folder.  Click on the thumbnail
and the intermediate sized image in the bigger frame to the right,
click on the intermediate sized image and get the full-sized image.

I have seen some browsers get confused by the frames and actually
display two columns of thumbnails down the left side at first.  It
hasn't bothered Mozilla, so I haven't cared too much what exactly is
going on.  I think the extra column goes away when you click on a
thumbnail.

Here is the Makefile I've been using:


SHELL=/bin/sh

.PHONY : clean-html clean-images clean-makefile all

all : clean-html index.html thumbnails.html $(patsubst %,album/%,$(wildcard *.JPG)) $(patsubst %.JPG,%.html,$(wildcard *.JPG)) $(patsubst %,thumbnails/%,$(wildcard *.JPG))

album :
	mkdir album

thumbnails :
	mkdir thumbnails

clean-html :
	rm -f *.html

clean-images :
	rm -rf album thumbnails

clean-makefile : 
	rm -f Makefile


%.html : %.JPG
	@echo "Making $@"
	@echo "<html><head><title>$^</title></head><body><a href=\"$^\" TARGET=\"right\"><img src=\"album/$^\"></a></body></html>" > $@

album/%.JPG : %.JPG
	convert -geometry '50%' $^ $@

thumbnails/%.JPG : %.JPG
	convert -geometry '10%' $^ $@

index.html :
	echo "<html><head><title>Photo Album</title></head><frameset COLS=\"160,*\"><frame SRC=\"thumbnails.html\" NAME=\"left\"><frame SRC=\"\" NAME=\"right\"></frameset><noframes></noframes></html>" > index.html


thumbnails.html : thumbnails album
	@echo "<html><head><title>Photo Album</title></head><body><center>" > thumbnails.html
	@echo $(foreach VAR,$(patsubst %.JPG,%,$(wildcard *.JPG)),"<a href=\"$(VAR).html\" TARGET=\"right\"><img src=\"thumbnails/$(VAR).JPG\" alt=\"$(VAR).JPG\"vspace=\"3\"></a><br>" >> thumbnails.html)

You get sdb, sdc, etc. The order is determined by the order of SCSI adapters
first. I.e. the first SCSI module you load will be scsi0, say, it's your real
SCSI card, and there are disks there, sda and sdb, then you load usbstorage
and get scsi1 and sdc. I don't know what determines the order inside USB
subsystem (order of plugging in if you plug them in one at a time, but if
you have 2 devices connected when you load usbstorage then I don't know).

They are generated by the camera. I don't know how your camera works, but
the ones I know generate thumbnails "inside" the main file (like Photoshop
embeds its "preview" image into a large image file).

That's what the thumbnails usually are, lower-resolution lower-quality JPEGs.
The standard Linux way of generating them is to use ImageMagic, it has
command-line tools for converting and rescaling images. I don't know how to
generate an image with embedded preview though (but then I've never seen
anything except Photoshop to make use of these previews, other image
viewers either ignore them or get confused by them).

Most cameras store EXIF tags with each picture. EXIF tags contain metadata
about the picture (camera model, shutters speed, etc) AND a thumbnail.
What you need is an EXIF aware tool. Do a search on Freshmeat for EXIF and
you'll get a list of several (I haven't tried most, so I'm not recommending
one).

Speaking of bachelorette parties, I am wondering whether there might
be interest in having a local author come give a talk on Pornography,
given the number of times the subject comes up in humorous remarks in
PLUG.  There is a fellow named David Loftus, who I know through his
occasional contributions to local newsgroups that has just released a
book titled: _WATCHING SEX -- How Men Really Respond to Pornography_.
I went to a publication party he threw over the weekend and got a
copy.  The Oregonian had a notice last week in Jonathon Nicholas's
column.

I have not approached him on the subject of a talk and it seems very
unlikely for this month, but I would be happy to ask him if there is
interest.  Maybe combine it with the one Eric Harrison has mentioned a
few times (but that I've forgotten the precise details on).

The Intro and first chapter are available online.  See: 

   <http://www.david-loftus.com/Writings/writings.html> 

A little far afield for PLUG, but when you stop and think about it,
who would notice?

Dirk,

  In OO you need to run the spadmin program from the command line to set the
default and alternate printers.

That was sort of the point of giving the output from file(1).

jbrelin at person:~/pics$ !file
file 20000622-001.jpg 20000622-thumbnail-001.jpg 
20000622-001.jpg:           JPEG image data, EXIF standard 0.73, 10752 x
2048
20000622-thumbnail-001.jpg: JPEG image data 46.38, thumbnail 65x61, 13874
x 13893


Note that the second file (with "thumbnail" in the name) claims that it is
a thumbnail image, not an EXIF standard image.

I'll play around with it.

Thanks everyone for the help.

Now that I'm thinking about it, I remember a board with a hairline
crack. Worked fine, once it warmed up, but until then, the crack made
for intermittent contact.

Well that's the darndest thing. It reads like a joke. "Remember, Napster is 
Communism, so fight for the American
   way of life."

I pasted the alleged code of the alleged exploit below, maybe someone who 
knows what it means can tell us.

   jinglebellz.c - local/remote exploit for mpg123
   (c) 2003 GOBBLES Security seXForces

   To use:
	$ gcc -o jinglebellz jinglebellz.c
	$ ./jinglebellz X own.mp3
	  (where X is the target number)
	$ mpg123 own.mp3

   If you need help finding specific targets for this

	$ ./jinglebellz 2 debug.mp3
	$ gdb
	 (gdb) file mpg123
	 (gdb) r debug.mp3
	 (gdb) set $p=0xc0000000-4

	  >set $p=$p-1
	  >end
	 (gdb) x/$p
	 0xbfff923c:     0x41424348

   Add the new target to the source, recompile, and 
   try it out!  You might want to supply your own
   shellcode if you're going to use this to own your
   friends <g>.

   Fun things to do:
   1) Create an evil.mp3 and append it to the end of a
      "real" mp3, so that your victim gets to listen to
      their favorite tunez before handing over access.

      ex: $ ./jinglebellz X evil.mp3 
	  $ cat evil.mp3 >>"NiN - The Day the Whole World Went Away.mp3"
   
   2) Laugh at Theo for not providing md5sums for the contents of
      ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/songs/, and continue laughing
      at him for getting his boxes comprimised when "verifying" the
      integrity of those mp3's.  GOOD WORK THEO!@# *clap clap clap clap*

   Special thanks to stran9er for the shellcode. 

   Remember, Napster is Communism, so fight for the American

I don't know yet.

I know of one hoax that has come from that address.

It is possible for some of the claims, but not all of them.  

It is possible for there to be a buffer overflow in the mpg123 library.  I 
have not had time to examine the code yet.  I have seen neither 
confirmation or denial from reliable sources.

Could this be used to compromise P2P servers?  Only if the admin of the 
machine listened to the trojaned MP3 on server machine.

Since the code was posted today without any real vendor notice, it will 
take a day or two to figure out if this is real or not.

The current answer is "Maybe".

I figured out most of that by reading the spec file for glibc and then
reading the beta tester's mailing list.

The problems are deeper than that though.

It appears that there are some nasty occasional VM problems in the
version I am using.  (Most likely causing the system hangs i am seeing.)
I need to upgrade a bunch of packages to the current Rawhide versions. 
That will take a while, even with DSL.  

Thanks for the info.

my first guess is, the author found an exploit in mpg123,
wrote a demo, and framed it with plausible-sounding fiction
for amusement value.

We still a speaker.  We can do around table on a tech issue (not
political due to time) like fonts/drivers, but I need volunteers to
commit to help.

Perhaps a "Tricks of OpenOffice?"

Wow, this matches Rich's question.

Basically OO has booklet, or brochure printing built-in.

http://www.oremus.org/labarum/mainabout.htm

So one little thing, is that in print-preview there is a preview
options, and a print  preview button.  This seems to allow different
printing.

Message-ID: <DA8FAB6GE3XMIPNA7UOCKLG1TKG75.3e244225@mike>

I've just installed logwatch on a server that has run fine for over a year, but 
mysteriously locked up. It had no video, no response to any port I use on it, nada. 
(Just like some other OS, but this isn't what my post is about)

I'm geting TONS of repeated modprobe errors. I've tracked down most of the sources 
and I know how to attqck the first one listd here. Somehow I installed the ISDN 
packages on the RH7.1 box, I'm removing them now.

There are other tricks to remove the errors for the sound card and sound system, 
but I don't remember them.

Can somebody help out? How do I google for these, I can't seem to find the fix.

modprobe: Can't locate module char-major-44
modprobe: Can't locate module block-major-16
modprobe: Can't locate module block-major-17

add these lines to /etc/modules.conf

alias char-major-44 off
alias block-major-16 off
alias block-major-17 off
alias block-major-18 off
alias sound-service-0-6 off
alias sound-slot-0 off
alias char-major-10-6 off

run depmod -a 

These will go away.. and you will not seem them on next reboot.

Very cool, Aaron.

I hate to reboot, though. Do I have to to make the errors 
stop in the logs?

Usually changes in /stc/modules.conf take effect immediately (after depmod was
run), at least changes to module options do, so changes to aliases might too.

Now, most of these is probably safe to alias to off, but you might want to
check that you don't want to actually use the devices in question:

char-major-44 - ISDN virtual modems
If you dont have IDSD, alias it to off and get rid of /dev/cui0-cui63

block-major-16 - GoldStar CD-ROM
block-major-17 - Optics Storage CD-ROM
block-major-18 - Sanyo CD-ROM
Probably safe to turn them off, I wonder why someone even asked for them.
You might also delete the corresponsing devices (/dev/gscd, /dev/optcd,
/dev/sjcd)

char-major-10-6 - SunMouse (/dev/sunmouse)

sound-service-0-6
sound-slot-0
This is more interesting, this is OSS sound. If you have any sound configures,
sound-slot-0 should be aliased to your sound card driver. Otherwise, set it to
off.

This is a headless server, no sound card amd a Toshiba, CD-
ROM. I set it up during Redhat's golden age of "everything 
should be on by default" and that's prob how they got turned 
on. I'm always frustratd by the screensaver, sound and 
fortunes dependencies when all I want is X. 

Maybe there aren't many of us out here that like X for 
configuring a server. I never leave it running, it's such a 
pig, I just use it for configuring. (browsing and reading e-
mail while logged in as root, too :P)

      Food and Beer

        ITS A BAR/RESTAURANT

So What's with the topic?
        
        The questions surrounding Open Office/Star Office have recently
        transformed from "can it open word documents" to "How do I print
        brochure style paging?" (Which is something OO does natively,
        and word does not).

So this is a chance to 

        a) Install OpenOffice
        b) Ask questions about OpenOffice
        c) Answer questions about OpenOffice
        d) Drink beer and eat food.

Since there is no "speaker" we are asking everyone to bring

        a) Laptops with OpenOffice installed
        b) CD ROMs with the OpenOffice installer on there (preferably
        for multiple OSes) to share with people.
        c) Questions
        d) Sample documents (this is a biggie)
        e) Answers (Accuracy not important)

Generating a list of questions on PLUG's mailing list would be a good
idea!

  I will try to be there. My question, which has not been answered on the
users mail list for more than a day is this: how do I get the silly thing to
print in color on my HP DeskJet 2500C? (No, I'm not bringing the printer, it
would take up the entire bar.)

  Running /usr/local/OpenOffice-1.0.1/programs/spadmin, I added two
printers; the application doesn't have definitions for either printer I have
here! My printers are an HP LaserJet 5 and a DeskJet 2500C. OO doesn't know
of either of these.

  Anyway, I pick a close second, configure it to print in color, and the
digital photos come out in gray scale. Not good.

I would highly recommend looking at 'NUT', the Network UPS Tools at  
http://www.exploits.org/nut/.  Unlike almost all of the other packages I 
looked it, it attempted a generic driver interface and best of all, is 
client-server and the monitoring system can actually shutdown other 
systems.

Subject: [PLUG] Programming Classes Coming up at FREE GEEK
Message-ID: <3E247EDA.6070207@anarchysoftware.com>

These programming classes are geared towards FREE GEEK volunteers, and 
some of them are also geared towards people who are relatively new to 
programming (or new to PHP).

Anyone who hasn't volunteered at FREE GEEK is still welcome, however, 
providing one of two things:

1 - you start volunteering some at FREE GEEK (hey! it's fun)

...and/or...

2 - you make a reasonable donation to FREE GEEK (hey! it's tax deductible)

If we run short of space for any of these, we'll give first preference 
for current FREE GEEK volunteers, but we'll also make every effort to 
squeeze everyone in who wants a spot.

If you are more experienced with programming issues and would like to 
help out by contributing your expertise to the more advanced seminars 
(listed last below), please let me know.

Thanks!


-------- Original Message --------

FREE GEEK is offering several programming classes in the near future.
Collectively, these classes will help FREE GEEK re-implement its
database application in a programming language called PHP, while
teaching participants how to create web based database applications.

If you have question about any of the following classes, or to sign up,
please contact richard at freegeek.org.


* For people new to programming, there will be a one night seminar
entitled "Introduction to Programming Concepts" from 7 to 9 pm on
Tuesday, January 21 at FREE GEEK. We will cover the basic concepts of
flow control (branching, loops, etc.), using modules, calling
procedures, using objects, and the like. This class is language
independant and will likely draw from PHP and Perl for examples. This
class is recommended for people who want to learn programming, but have
had no training.


* We will be offering a six or seven week long programming class
starting Tuesday, January 28, from 7 to 9 pm at FREE GEEK, running every
Tuesday night through February and into early March. The class will be
called "Intro to Developing Web Applications using PHP and SQL". The
core of the class revolves around going through part of the code used in
FREE GEEK's database. The class will be taught by a small group of
volunteer teachers with experience in SQL, HTML, and PHP.  Homework
assignments will be reviewed by the teachers and potentially included in
FREE GEEK's database application, which is being converted to PHP. This
class is open to anyone regradless of skill level, but if you are new to
programming, please attend "Introduction to Programming Concepts" above.


* For people who have some PHP experience and want more, the outline for
"Intro to Developing Web Applications using PHP and SQL" will be made
available. You will be able to follow along without needing to attend
class. We can give you a small project to work on and review your code.


* Watch for some advanced topics seminars coming up as well. We intend
to hold seminars on application packagings, writing install scripts,
writing init scripts, refactoring your code, and CVS. Details are not
yet finalized.




Reminder: FREE GEEK is closed Saturday, January 18 (in honor of the
Martin Luther King holiday).

Hi

First, check that the unixODBC is installed on your machine. If not you 
have to configure it. The postgresql driver is useless if the ODBC is 
not installed on your machine. I'm a RH7.3 user, so I use rpm packages. 
I suppose you can get unixODBC deb packages from Debian, or build the 
application yourself.
http://www.unixodbc.org:/

Then, once the application is installed, you must run ODBCConfig (mind 
the case!) in order to install the specific driver. Run ODBCConfig as 
root (because you need the write privilege to /etc/odbc.ini), and in the 
dialog window select "drivers", then "Add". You're shown a new dialog box:
- give a name to the driver (ex: PostgreSQL);
- give a short description of the driver;
- select the driver itself: in my configuration it's 
/usr/lib/libodbcpsql.so (and it's a link to a numbered so)
- select the setup, /usr/lib/libodbcpsqlS.so (also a link) which is use 
by ODBCConfig to help you configure databases installation.
Then click the tick, and the driver should install correctly.

Now you need to configure the DSN. If you want your database to be a 
system DB (ie everybody can access it), select the "System DSN" tab. 
Else exit the application, and restart it as a user and select the "USER 
DSN" tab.

Select "Add", and a dialog box opens. Select the PostgreSQL driver from 
the list, and click OK... From then on, it's specific to your 
configuration, but you should be able to manage it ;-)

As for OpenOffice, open the database interface, and open the database 
manager dialog box. Create a new database with the sdbc:odbc: driver. 
When you click on the button [...] you're normally proposed the 
accessible ODBC DB. Select the one you've just configured, then fulfil 
all the details.

And that's it.

Everyone,

I had a choice this Saturday - run the Clinic or attend the anti-war

I'm trying to configure an FTP server on a RedHat 7.2 box running kwu-ftpd
0.2.0 (whatever comes with the RedHat distro).  Security isn't my main goal
(it will be down the line), but my main goal is to just have it work period.

I've got it set up so that I can ping it, and I even get a login screen from
and FTP client on another machine.  The problem is that I can't seem to
successfully set up a user account within the ftp program that can log in.
I have anonymous set up with fairly decent access.

Anyone have any hints for a newbie trying to setup an FTP server?  Also,
what is the difference between kwu-ftpd and wu-ftpd?  Wu has a higher
version number than kwu, but I can't get that one to work either.

Thanks in advance for any help!

What does that mean?  To include "open source" but exclude "unix"
might mean (or not mean?) that OpenBSD (clearly open source) and OS X
(mostly open source) would be off-topic.  Is that your intent?

If discussing *BSD and Darwin is off limits, I won't be participating.

While "Linux" is a great brand, it's really just a stepping stone to
get public awareness of open source Unix-like systems.  The BSD and
Darwin tree is definitely Unix, and has many common overlapping issues
with Linux development.

I really get confused at the rare "Linux uber alles" fanaticism I see
occasionally.  You miss the bigger picture, which for me is providing
a viable alternative to M$ products for operating systems, server
software, and desktop software.  Yes, Linus did a Good Thing.  RedHat
did a Great Thing getting the business community to accept Linux.  But
it doesn't stop there.

While Linux is a main focus, other open-source such as *BSD, OSX, IMO,
wouldn't be off-topic...meaning closed source unix would be off-topic.

Fuck you.

Just had to toss in some anti-war plug, huh?

Ever wonder what those who are actually putting their lives on the line
in this war - to protect your right to be a fucked up ass hole - think
about anti-war protestors?

Drop by the Swan Island Marine/Navy base and ask them while they are
gearing up to ship off to the middle east.

What is there to debate?
There is a new Linux User Group in town. Come on over and hang out.. don't
question the ethics or reasoning behind it... at least not here. Is this
off topic for this list already? We don't have any underlying rules... so
why are we debating this?

This seems a tad off topic.

..but I'll agree.. I'll be down there with Dan....because I have a
different opinion on the matter. Are you going to tell me to "f** off"
too? Because I don't think the people strapping on their boots should be
fighting a war that is based on the interests of oil?

Hi man!

I'm not (purely) of the OO Team (I think it's somewhere a big medal
for me cause this is my first sending item).

After two weeks I have just seen my Postgres tables in the Data Source
. I have read a lot but a problem with the driver send me an error
message (Finaly I have just got it)

The process I have done (I'm not explain in detail all but I tell you
some links):

-Install PostgreSQL with ODBC support. It makes ODBC with Postgres
connection (for example
http://www.ninthwonder.com/info/postgres/programmer/odbc.htm)
-Install odbcunix (www.odbcunix.org You can read more information in
section Manuals). It makes "everybody" connect with ODBC "sources"
-Configure ODBC (odbc.ini and odbcinst.ini in your configuration
files. Mine's are in /etc). Here you tell where are Data (DSNs) and
what driver connect your database.
-And voil? (My error here was that I use the library driver from
Postgres, I use what comes with unixodbc and it worked)

General Link (http://www.codebydesign.com/Common/doc/NotesPostgreSQL.html)

I'm going to try now how to manipulate data (I suppose this will be
trivial with OO).

Best Regads (and congratulations for this suite)

PD: My config files (for example)

/etc/odbcinst.ini

Regardless of "just having it work" or not, wu-ftp is horrible.  I
cannot stress this enough; just say no.  There are rpms out there for
vsftpd (recommended) and ProFTPD.  Both of these are better packages,
and it's next to impossible to be less secure than wu-ftp. It's one of
the single most exploitable programs out there with a long, long history
of regular and serious problems.  I can't fathom why distributions still
persist in shipping it.

Take at look at /etc/pam.d/ftp that file defines the
security/authentication modules that the ftp service will use.
The format of that file can be a little obscure but I'm guessing that's
where the problem is.

  For the color printer, it sure is. All other apps deal with it and don't
seem to become as confused as does OO.

Message-ID: <E18Yav2-0008Nk-00@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

kwuftpd is a GUI configuration tool in kdeadmin for configuring the server
wuftpd. A lot of command line tools have GUI front ends for configuration, or
for making running a series of commands easier. GUI CD burning is a good
example of this. Most  GUI CD burner programs are front ends to cdrecord,
mkisofs, ... command line tools. You can see how these programs call the
command line tools by using the command ps ax in an xterm. This will show you
the command and the options to the command that are required to implement the
choices you make in the GUI front end. 


Because you stated you are new linux user, it seems appropriate to verify what
ftp server is running before you get to much help. Using kwuftp doesn't mean
that wuftpd is the server running on your box. We know a server is running,
because you stated you could reach the box. Sometimes the ftp banner will state
the name of running ftp server when you connect, so you might already know
you're running wuftpd if you remember it being stated when you tried to log in
before. The better way to tell is to open a xterm and use the command ps ax |
grep ftp  The | pipes the output of ps to grep. Grep matches that input against
ftp and outputs the results. You might have no matches ( grep might match it
self but not another ) or you might get one or more. You would get no matches
if the ftp daemon was being run in a super-server, inetd or xinetd are the
usual super-servers. You would get one match or two matches if the ftp daemon
was running in stand-alone mode.  Grep will  sometimes catch itself running,
matches "grep ftp" and add it to it output. There is a simple way around this
that you will pick up if you haven't already. Too many details, yes/

If you match a standalone server great please confirm you are using wuftpd. As
you changed your configs with kwuftp you might have everything setup, but not
applied. I couldn't find a man page or other documentation for kwuftp, so I
don't know if after saving your changes, if it will restart the ftp daemon.
Most daemons, there are some that don't, have to be told to reread their
configuration file/s in order for the changes to be put into effect. This
requires you to know a couple of things, the pid number of the daemon, or the
how to find and call the init file for daemonamon. both of these are easy but
I'm going to skip details, because I need to help you first determine what to
do if the ftp daemon isn't running in standalone mode.

So if you didn't a match or only matched the grep command, then you need to
determine if a super-server is running, ( probably true at this point ). Use
the same ps ax command	in an xterm and pass the output to grep, but change the
pattern grep matches. I think the pattern "inet" will work to match either
xinetd or inetd, but I don't have either running to confirm this, so you might
have to play around and confirm one or the other. Once you find the name of the
super-server you will need to check the super-server's configuration file to
see what ftp daemon is being used. Both inetd and xinetd will have their
configuration files in /etc 

Depending on which one, in an xterm use the command less /etc/xinetd.conf or
less /etc/inetd.conf to view the super-server's configuration file. Find the
entry for ftp and confirm it is wuftpd. If not, copy the entry and post you
findings. You will need to post you finding also, if you find you are running a
standalone mode server, so that you can get more help with interrupting the
server or / and after that, implementing changes to the config files.

Thank you

Try similar sounding hp printers in the stack.

OO will generate postscript (maybe PCL) for lpd/cups.  The test page
should be in color.

I have found you must match the driver in OO with the driver in lpd.  If
lpd expects postscript, use a PS driver in OO.  If it expects PCL, then
use a PCL driver.

The different driver between printers are pretty similar in a product
line.

I'm using a hp920C via CUPS using the STP Ghostscript driver, and color
printing in OO works here. I am using the Generic Printer Driver in OO, using
the lpr -P printer_name  for the command to print, and set device properties
to use color and 24 bit.

Thank you

Thanks for doing your homework before posting. It's really rare to find
someone who weighs the facts of the current situation and contemplates the
background of his opponent so carefully.

Perhaps Shahms is right, this thread needs to die. If you guys want to

Just remember that you have *no* right to disagree with your leaders.

Anyone who expresses an unauthorised opinion is a threat to democracy

You are free -- to do as you are told.

Message-ID: <20030115002247.GB28872@dalsemi.com>

At my church, they have a mish-mash computer lab and I've recently
been given permission to try to improve it, so of course I'm
going to try Linux :)

My first thought was K12LTSP.  There's a box with two NICs that can
work as the server, but the clients will be whatever's in the room.
Every single K12LTSP setup that I've read about have all been with
identical machines, whereas here I'm trying to re-use existing
hardware.

Is it doable, but difficult, or is it just better done with identical
boxes?

Thanks,
Colin

Message-ID: <20030115001500.C095244F5@joseph.doink.com>

nmh (with exmh) and postfix was working just fine on my Mandrake
9.0 system with the default msec setting, level 2 security.

Then I increased my msec security setting to level 3, because
I like to get reports of what ports have opened/closed, for
instance.  A few hours later I could no longer use nmh to send
email.  The error message I get is:

    post: problem initializing server; [RPLY] 127 .0.0.1, 128.181.208.41, 192.168.0.1 context mail_dict "pid" recursive
    send: message not delivered to anyone

I quickly decided to revert to msec's level 2 security.  But, it
seems that the reversion was not complete and the problem did not
go away.  I recognized the "problem initializing server" portion
of the message from my history.  It turns out to look related to
section 6 of this FAQ http://www.faqs.org/faqs/mail/mh-faq/part1
which is saying that nmh's post program can't correctly connect
to an SMTP daemon.  Oddly enough /bin/mail and the Sylpheed
mail client do connect just fine to my SMTP daemon provided by
postfix.

What can I do to repair/troubleshoot this problem further?

Thanks....

There are three things that are important when running K12LTSP:
Video Card, Network Card and booting.  The best way to accomplish the
third one is via PXE and netbooting, but failing that bootdisks on
floppy, CD-ROM, hard-drive, etc. all work. beyond that, the terminal
server really doesn't care.  I do most of my daily work logged into a
K12LTSP server from a different display of my workstation.  Works
wonderfully.

Subject: [PLUG] Modem Ports under Mandrake 9.0
Message-ID: <20030115003540.4333F44F5@joseph.doink.com>

My modem is attached to /dev/ttyS0 which is a symbolic link to
/dev/tts/0.  This port is used for dial in, dial out of both UUCP
traffic (an email and file transport system) and fax.  The port
needs to be owned by user/group uucp/uucp for this to all work.
This is the way Mandrake 8.0 worked (except that Mandrake 8.0
didn't do DevFs).

Now that I'm using Mandrake 9.0 the modem port /dev/tts/0
ownership gets set to <user>/tty where <user> is the first person
to login after the machine boots.

Is this a bug on Mandrake's part or is this a configuration
problem on my part?  If this is a configuration problem, then
where do I go to fix it?

Thanks.....

P.S.:	From my UUCP references, you may assume that I'm wildly
	comfortable with command line configuration.  I have also
	learned to point-and-click when needed.  ;-)

Has anyone else noticed that the software sources manager GUI
thingy will mangle the database and crash?

A CD will disappear or go into an unselectable state.  Or, I'll
get a message saying that I need to update my sources before I
can install anything.

FWIW, I installed all my CDs by hand with urpmi.addmedia and that
let me get everything back to where I could select and install
software, but with one MAJOR exception.  Unless a CD is already
mounted, urpmi will die saying that it can't find the data.
Urpmi no longer prompts me to provide CDs.  I would have thought
that declaring the CDs as "removable://..." would have been what
it needed.  No such luck.

Any idea how to troubleshoot this or make it work again?

Thanks....

Rich, I ran into a similar problem with a HP 870cxi and HP1200.  Just
didn't print quite right.  Two thoughts come to mind.  One is in the PPD
file for which ever printer you're currently using.   Make sure the
option to print color is set. (I'm away from my system so I can't look for
the exact settings.)  The other was a process of finding a PPD file for
the 1200 (or close to it) and placing it in the OOo PPD directory and
running spadmin.
   This is if a very weak memory serves me right.  I'll check this
evening.  Btw, PPDs for printers can quite often be found on the
manufacturers site (HP) or a high-powered graphics application site 
(Adobe?).

Russell,

  I had always left OO with the Generic Printer and specified the specific
one I want to use with each document. It wasn't working on this doc and
that's when I tried futzing with spadmin.

  Just now I took off the two added printers and tried again while
specifying the 'color' printer as defined by CUPS. Again, gray scale. Sigh.

Thanks,

Rich

Actually, I would think that if it turns out that there isn't going to be
a war because a lot of folks spoke up about the issue that they'd be

I'm sorry for the level of vulgarity there, guys...

If I could, I would un-post my first post and re-post it without the use
of the f-word.

I was a bit... peeved.

As many of you [should] know, the Marine reservists stationed up at Swan
Island (the 6th Engineer Support Battalion) got marching orders Saturday
morning and are shipping off sometime between tonight and Friday.  They
are very much rearing to go - but I don't think we really want to touch
on that too much for fear of making this thread too much longer. 
Anyway, one of the Marines shipping off is my best friend since the 6th
grade.  He is quite willing to go.  Still, he is putting his life in
danger, and as such, I was a bit PO'd to see the post I originaly
responded to.

I'd like to apologize to the list... the language in my post was out of
line...

The most important thing is to have decent PCI video cards and nics.

LTSP tries its best to autodetect and configure the hardware in each
terminal.  If you have PCI video & nics, odds are very good that it
will work out-of-the-box.

A big help if you don't have PXE enabled machine is the EtherBoot utility at 
www.etherboot.org. It will allow you to make boot floppies that will let you 
download a kernel from a TFTP server.

I've successfully used LTSP on many different machines using EtherBoot.

Subject: [PLUG] USB digital camera
Message-ID: <20030115034400.68071.qmail@web9605.mail.yahoo.com>

I was pleased to note the number of responses to my
previous post on this subject, and am saving them for
future reference. There is a Web site devoted to
Olympus cameras similar to mine, at

http://software.jodda.de/

The author naturally disclaims responsibility for the
consequences of using his "quick-fix" approach,
intended for those whose only USB device will be this
camera. It involves patching the module usb-storage.o
with a C program available from his site.

gcc usbp.c -o usbp

Now find out where the module is with  

insmod usb-storage.(In my case this is
usb-storage.o.gz. Is the module actually used in that
form, zipped?)

Copy the usbp executable into the directory with the
module and execute it. Rename the modules so that the
patched one has the original name. You're done.

If it's that simple, why haven't I done it already? I
was wondering whether anyone actually thinks this kind
of procedure could have undesirable effects on an
installed system.

You apologize for "the level of vulgarity", but no apology for abusing

Did you complain in December when I announced that the Clinic was canceled
due to it's proximity to Christmas? Was Christmas any more germane to the
Plug list than the rally? No, you got angry because I posted something
*you* disagreed with. And then, instead of dealing with my announcement in
a constructive way, you let loose with a torrent of insults and
expletives.

I was very careful in my original posting to keep the hole thing low key.  
No polemics, no sloganeering, and no appeal to emotion. It astounds me
that the very mention of an anti-war march provoked such an extreme
reaction from you. Three little sentences sent you into a frothing frenzy.
That was quite impressive.

The fact that your friend is a good soldier and a patriot does not and
never will make this war right. Good men should not be sent off to die on
the false pretext of a war on terrorism. Afganistan was one thing, but
Bush has *never* made the case that Iraq has anything to do with terrorism
- but yet that's supposedly why they're going.

Your anger at me make no sense. If I had my way no one would be shipping
off to risk their lives attacking Iraq.  If you really want to show
respect for your friend you should come down and march with us.

The Brownshirts played an interesting role in pre-war Germany, they were
sent out to shout down the opposition. Your posting was more than a little
reminiscent of their tactics. Was that intentional?

 From the ISN listserv, an article in The Register:

http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/28842.html

By Andrew Orlowski in San Francisco
Posted: 14/01/2003
The RIAA is preparing to infect MP3 files in order to audit and
eventually disable file swapping, according to a startling claim by
hacker group Gobbles. In a posting to the Bugtraq mailing list,
Gobbles himself claims to have offered his code to the RIAA, creating
a monitoring "hydra".
"Several months ago, GOBBLES Security was recruited by the RIAA
(riaa.org) to invent, create, and finally deploy the future of
antipiracy tools. We focused on creating virii/worm hybrids to infect
and spread over p2p nets," writes Gobbles.
"Until we became RIAA contracters [sic], the best they could do was to
passively monitor traffic. Our contributions to the RIAA have given
them the power to actively control the majority of hosts using these
networks."
Gobbles claims that when a peer to peer host is infected, it catalogs
media and sends the information "back to the RIAA headquarters
(through specifically crafter requests over the p2p networks) where it
is added to their records", and also propagates the exploit to other
nodes.
"Our software worked better than even we hoped, and current reports
indicate that nearly 95% of all p2p-participating hosts are now
infected with the software that we developed for the RIAA."
The "hydra" is uncorroborated.
Gobbles attached two pieces of code, one of which jinglebellz.c
details a frame header exploit for the Linux player mpg123. The code
chastises OpenBSD lead Theo de Raadt for failing to checksum the
public MP3s (written to celebrate each OpenBSD release). The group has
singled out OpenBSD in its previous exploits
In their presentation to last year's DefCon, the group described
itself as "the largest active nonprofit security group in existence
(that favors full disclosure)," consisting of 17+ members.
"They're real, and they're damn good. They have made what appeared to
be extremely exaggerated claims in the past, and when mocked, they
have demonstrated that they are serious," one security expert familiar
with their work, who declined to be named, told The Register.
"He's a funny guy," De Raadt told us. "This is a buffer overflow
exploit," he confirmed. De Raadt said he was more concerned by social
engineering than by external exploits. "We had Fluffy Bunny, now we
have Gobbles. They come in waves. "
An exploit of this nature is of dubious legality, right now, but
language in Howard Berman's "P2P Piracy Prevention" bill last year
legitimizing such exploits was backed by RIAA chief Hilary Rosen:-
The Berman bill, ensured a copyright owner would not be liable for
"disabling, interfering with, blocking, diverting, or otherwise
impairing the unauthorized distribution, display, performance, or
reproduction of his or her copyrighted work on a publicly accessible
peer-to-peer file trading network, if such impairment does not,
without authorization, alter, delete, or otherwise impair the
integrity of any computer file or data residing on the computer of a
file trader." Berman is expected to re-introduce the bill in this
Congressional session.

At my work, we are currently running Backup Exec on two NT 4.0 machines
and on a Novell server, backing up Linux, Windows NT 4.0 and Novell
servers. We will be consolidating all the backup responsibilities to a
single box, but not sure what OS to use.

I'd really like to run Linux if possible, but I would need something
like Backup Exec, with a nice GUI-based menu, easy to use, stable, and
that can backup Linux/WinNT/Novell computers. Any open-source
suggestions?

Thanks,

-Scott

The latest P4's have Hyperthreading too.  Apparently, they all have it
built in, but was not turned on until recently (2.53A), could be because
Intel didn't have a chipset that would run it.  The latest version of
the 845 chipset now supports it (both the PE and GE flavors).  I think
the new SiS chipset supports it too, but I still don't trust SiS
chipsets, they have left me scratching my head too many times.

Can hardly wait for the 2.6 kernel! ZOOM ZOOM!!

Oddly enough, I didn't actually write this.  This time, whoever it was, was 
clever enough to do a pretty convincing job of it--I questioned it for a 
moment myself.  I had to check my sent folder to make sure I wasn't just 
posting drunk again (I don't recall being drunk last night, but sometimes 
Pernod will do strange things to a man).  He managed to get the headers 
right too--posted the NNTP, as I've been doing, spelled my name correctly, 
and set the Organization: header correctly.  Of course, he missed the 
signature, and more importantly, the PGP signature.

I have my guesses of whom to blame--someone who's clever enough to copy my 
idiosyncrasies so closely and often up until 2:00AM (when the wife and 4 
children are in bed) and would just think it's damn funny.

So how about a handful of assorted, old Pentium based Toshiba
laptops with PCMCIA NIC's?  The original OS is Win95, and will
need to stay Win95 until I can test some of the software that
we're reliant on, so I'm planning on using boot floppies for
a while.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0301151112180.32077-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  Those of you who hang out in the Xfce mail list will know Joe quite well:

---------- Forwarded message ----------
   Interview with a Grandmother:
   http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6562 -- Joe Klemmer set up
   an OEone HomeBase Linux system for his mother, who was migrating from
   a Win98 system. In this interview, she talks about the new
   opportunities and uses the system offers--and why it is all so easy.

  Tech Tip

   When you boot Linux, the kernel turns off Num Lock by default. This
   isn't a problem if, for you, the numeric keypad is the no-man's-land
   between the cursor keys and the mouse. But if you're an accountant, or
   setting up a system for an accountant, you probably don't want to turn
   it on every single time.

   Here's the easy way, if you're using KDE. Go to K --> Preferences -->
   Peripherals --> Keyboard and select the Advanced tab. Select the radio
   button of your choice under NumLock on KDE startup and click OK.

   If you only run KDE and want Num Lock on when you start a KDE session,
   you're done. Otherwise, read on.

   To set Num Lock on in a virtual console, use:

   setleds +num

   If you choose to put this in a .bashrc file to set Num Lock when you
   log in, make it:

   setleds +num &> /dev/null

   to suppress the error message you'll get if you try it in an xterm or
   over an SSH connection.

   Finally, here's the way to hit this problem with a big hammer--make
   the numeric keypad always work as a numeric keypad in X, no matter
   what Num Lock says. This will make them never work as cursor keys, but
   you're fine with that because you have cursor keys, right? Create a
   file called .Xmodmap in your home directory, and insert these lines:

keycode 79=7
keycode 80=8
keycode 81=9

keycode 83=4
keycode 84=5
keycode 85=6

keycode 86=plus
keycode 87=1
keycode 88=2
keycode 89=3

keycode 90=0
keycode 91=period

keycode 77=Escape

   (from a Usenet post by Yvan Loranger:
   http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&selm=3BFD087F.20003
   00%40iquebec.com&rnum=3+)

   The last line takes the now-useless Num Lock key and makes it an extra
   Escape key. If your favorite accounting software uses one of the F
   keys frequently, you might prefer that.

   The number to the left of the equals sign is an X "keycode", the key
   on the keyboard you pressed, and the number or name to the right is an
   X "keysym", the character or function X thinks it is. You don't have
   to look these up in some X manual. To find out the keycode and keysym
   for any key, run xev in an xterm, move the mouse to the small white
   xev window and watch the keycodes and keysyms scroll by in the xterm.

With PCMCIA NICs you have a catch-22. You need software loaded to intialize
the PCMCIA cards so that you can get to the network to download the software.

In other words, a purely-diskless PCMCIA box is a no-go ;-)


There is a PCMCIA package at ltsp.org that you can use to make a boot
floppy for PCMCIA boxes.  I have not tried this myself.

Hello there,

(first post here)

I am running into a problem with the well-known
limitation of the Linux kernel's 256 entry limit on
the Linux mount tables. Searching USENET, the web, and
Linux sites, I have been able to find about 4 years of
people thinking this should be fixed in the "next
version." But no workaround or kernel hacks. 

I searched the archives of this list and didn't see
any mention of this.I know it's a long shot, but has
anybody gotten around this? We're using an automounter
+ Samba, and this limitation sometimes hoses our
servers. 

thank you for the informations,
sasha

Has anyone had any luck setting up a PPTP VPN with Microsoft 98 and/or
2000 Professional clients and a Linux server running PoPTop?

I'm having a lot of trouble getting this to work.
For a while, I was able to successfully authenticate the connection
before getting a Error 742 (The remote server does not support proper
encryption) on the Windows box.  However, since installing updates
to the Windows box nothing works.  I'm beginning to think I should
just install an IPSEC package on the Windows boxes, but that's not
what my client requested.

                                          Sincerely,
                                          David Mandel

If you can talk them in to IPSEC they'd probably be better off in the long 
run. I understand PPTP has some security issues, and IPSEC is the way of 
the future, being built in to IPv6 and all.

I think IPSEC comes with W2K, but certainly not 98. That could be the 
reason for them requesting PPTP. In that case you might be stuck.

You think Age of Empires is good... try AoE2  :-)

Of course, then you need to get the Age of Conquerors expansion for it.

I don't think there is an AoE clone for Linux.  I'm currently stuck
using Windoze on the laptop simply for AoE2, CounterStrike, and
Battlefield 1942.  Add Master of Orion III to that list when it is
released in February.

Game options in Linux are really weak, unfortunately.  The one RTS game
I tried simply didn't work (it was a clone of Warcraft, IIRC) very well
- it was slow and there was nothing to do in it.

Transgaming's WineX allowed some folks to play AoE and AoE2, with no-CD
hacks.  Many had to install the games in Windows then copy them over to
Linux because the installer didn't like WineX.  AoE2 is rated a 0 out of
5 for workability (although just recnetly folks got it working) while
AoE has a 3 of 5.

Unfortunately, Loki has gone out of business - I think they got more
games ported than anybody else.  What we really need is for game makers
to realize us Linux folks like to play games!  ID software is about the
only maker that regularly releases Linux versions of their games and
they aren't really big RTS or strategy makers......

I actually don't give a hang for Linux (or *BSD or Darwin) because of the
maintainers' lackluster (with the probable exception of Alan Cox) support
for the GPL and Free Software.

The so-called "Open Source" is all well and good as a stepping stone (as
you put it, Randal), but it ignores, in my opinion, the fundamental aspect
of freedom and duty to posterity that is inherent in Free Software.

When there's a viable alternative to Linux that can let me run a GNU OS,
I'll take it in a heartbeat.

As for this whole community existing solely for "providing a viable
alternative to M$ products", I think that view is reactionary and
limiting.

The Free Software movement provides a viable alternative to profit-driven
human interaction with results equally or more productive and contributing
as much or more to technological progress with none of the human
exploitation or degredation.

This was extraordinarily depressing. The one thing I found comforting was that 
Breyer dissented and he's supposedly "conservative."

It's depressing but expected. The court have consistently stated that its
decisions are based on the existing laws, not on what the justices think
is the "good of the country", the latter is in the care of the Congress.
In this case, the majority opinion, as I see it, can be summarised like
this: "Congress has broad powers to set copyright laws, and Court cannot
change that no matter how misguided an exercise of these powers by the
Congress might be in this case".

Yep.. that's pretty much what I found.. Looks like Oracle support might

right place. 

Thanks Robby

Anyone use these with Oracle yet?

Arkeia isn't to bad.  It has a GUI front end and also has a remote
client for remote administration.  It isn't Open Source, but the single
server version is free.  It has a Microsoft client as well.  It isn't as
streamlined as Backup Exec, but works well enough.

Subject: [PLUG] Backup server questions

At my work, we are currently running Backup Exec on two NT 4.0 machines
and on a Novell server, backing up Linux, Windows NT 4.0 and Novell
servers. We will be consolidating all the backup responsibilities to a
single box, but not sure what OS to use.

I'd really like to run Linux if possible, but I would need something
like Backup Exec, with a nice GUI-based menu, easy to use, stable, and
that can backup Linux/WinNT/Novell computers. Any open-source
suggestions?

Thanks,

I didn't find their opinion to read like this at all.  The summarizing
paraphse I made was more like, "Extension of existing copyrights is the
way Congress has done things in the past and we won't assume that Congress
will ever do it again."

I don't have time to get into it right this second (bank closes soon), but
if you read the footnote on page 18 of the decision, you can find some
incredibly illogical arguments against Breyer's common law perpetuity
argument.

  This makes 3 places where the user must specify color or gray scale! Three
places!! That's really poor program design. Of course, they followed the
Redmond model, but I would _never_ have found this by myself. Who the heck
would think of looking on a configuration option page when there's printing

tuxgames.com has almost every game that has been ported to Linux, many
(most?) with demos you can download. Kohan is pretty good in the
strategy / rts type thing ( I have not played AoE[2]).

Counterstrike / HL runs quite well under wine, find info at:

http://lhl.linuxgames.com/

framerates will be somewhat lower than on windows. (it was playable on
my dual celeron 366, with a G400, about 15-20fps).

www.happypenguin.org is a good place to keep up with the state of
linux gaming. Linux Game Publishing is also doing a good job at
porting games, they haven't made a big splash because they are a bit
more conservative than Loki. (probably a good idea, considering :( ).

It works, and so far as I can tell, there are no

one. The Olympus D-100 and D-220 digital cameras are
very popular, and readily available at reasonable
prices.

For some reason, mine likes to call itself "sdb1":

mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/removable

Transgaming has a version of Kohan (both Immortal Sovereigns and Ahriman's
Gift) modified for WineX. You buy them instead of regular Windows versions
but you don't have to become subscriber of Transgaming to do it.
I have them both, they work as well as under Windows, perhaps even better.

Just to make sure that no one gets the wrong impression...

I was going to do a presentation on filtering out porn web sites, not
on porn itself ;-)

Now if we DID want to do such a talk, I could throw my 2 cents in on
"_TRICKS OF THE TRADE -- How Pornography Website Operators Really
  Respond to Web Filters_"  <grin>


The original idea was that "filtering" might make a controversial subject
for us to discuss. That has not proven to be true.

It is now a bit of an inside-joke. One of the side-effects of the Childrens
Internet Protection Act is that I'm now making a list of ~300,000 known
porn sites publicly available...

Yeah, heh, it's kind of a touchy subject.  When I first saw the title
of the book, I thought to myself (and I am by no means a habitual
consumer of the stuff): "I don't need no steenking book to tell me
_that_!", but actually, when I went to read the intro I found it to be
a well-written, insightful and serious look at the subject, based on
interviews with ~150 subjects, which explodes a number of myths.

Probably a bit far afield for a PLUG talk though.

Really? Kohan & the addon , iirc, were some on the last titles ported
by Loki.. (it is in the loki_demos package).

Such impressions are important when one is posting from a "k12.or.us"

It *could* be made into a PLUG-specific talk. I have not looked at the
author's bio to see how tech-savvy he is, but there is an extremely
strong relationship between psychology and technology in this case.

People like me write programs that crawl the internet looking for
patterns and relationships that are strong indicators of pornography.
I am by no means an expert on pornography, but I do have a bit of a
knack for finding patterns and relationships. A properly trained robot
can find hundreds or thousands of porn sites per day without any work on
the behalf of its creator.

Many of the porn websites actively try to avoid filtering (the less
sleazy sites use META tags, PICT ratings, and the like to make it trivial
to filter them out). They have to understand the psychology of their
clientele and of the techniques used by the filters to be able to strike
the fine balance between hidding from the filters but not losing their
customers in the process.

If you ignore the "touchy" parts of the subject matter, it can be boiled
down to an interesting psychology/technology arms race that would be 
quite appropriate for an advance topics presentation.

Oh, and a quick suggestion for any of you researching such subject matter
on-the-job like I do... "evaluate" questionable websites with lynx ;-)

Thanks for the URL :) I have been starting to look in to this because soon
my car will have a wireless rig in it, and it would be fun to 'plug-in'
while downtown - on some one else bandwidth :)

I have seen all the replies, and have a general reply to this sort of
problem. When you start out with trying to fix a computer that won't load
drives, just take out and push the IDE cables all the way back in. In my
experience, this solves about 3 in 4 cases of problems. IDE cables can come
loose for many reasons, such as fan vibration or movement (If they are very
loose). Then of course there are more complicated problems, but the IDE
cables yield the most results for the least amount of testing work ;)

Hmmm, perhaps that is a way for us to fund our schools?  All major credit

Eric,

  I believe that the technical term for this is "job security". :-)

Kohan was ported, but the expansion was not. Also, Linux version of Kohan
is not supported, which means no more patches, while the Winex version
is up to date.

Here's the code:

http://ftp.teledanmark.no/pub/www/proxy/squidGuard/contrib/squidGuardRobot/


The tricky part is training it ;-)

You have to feed it the "right" URLs, filter the results, and feed it back
back into the robot.  Once you have a large enough database built up, it
will largely care and feed for itself.... 

As an extra sanity check, I also do a text match on the results seperating
the list out into "obviously bad" and "probably bad". The "obviously bad"
is immediately fed back into the robot, the "probably bad" is fed through
Dans Guardian. The ones Dans Guardian marks as "obviously bad" are then
fed back into the robot. Rinse, lather, repeat.

Message-ID: <200301161220.08740.tjg@craigelachie.org>

I generally use keymap to swap ctrl and caps-lock in my terminals and the X 
setting to swap them in X. This works really well. However, on my new 
notebook for some-reason I keep hitting the control key and turning on 
caps-lock.

Since caps-lock was a stupid idea in the first place, I'm quite happy to 
completely lose that functionality. I'm sure there's a way to just turn 
caps-lock completely off. I just don't know what it is.

Thanks.

Thanks to both of you. I had swapcaps, not nocaps. nocaps does the trick.

Subject: [PLUG] Second X server auth question
Message-ID: <3E271B6B.8080702@angryloner.org>

I have run into a problem with trying to run a 2nd X server on my
system. I am trying to run a windows program using wine. The win app
works best in 8bpp color and I would prefer not to restart my main X
server constantly to accomadate it. I can launch a  second X server using

xinit /usr/bin/esddsp /usr/bin/wine  ${WINAPP} -- :1 -xf86config
XF86Config-win -ac

and it works fine. but if I attempt to invoke it without the disabling
auth checking (-ac), the X sessions starts but the app won't connect.
The only error i receive is:

..
AUDIT: Thu Jan 16 12:33:53 2003: 26746 X: client 1 rejected from local host
Xlib: connection to ":1.0" refused by server
Xlib: No protocol specified

I have attempted to use xhost to add permission for the client to
connect, both from a term in my original X session and as part of the
xinit command, but to no avail. If I understand the docs correctly, I
should be able to use xhost from within the 2nd X server to grant
permission to the client to connect, but I'd prefer not to launch a
shell if it is avoidable. Any ideas for how I can allow the client to
make the connection without turning off auth checking altogether?

Yes, I have gotten it to work.  Apparently, you have to be careful about
the type of encryption the server supports.  '98 and 2k get confused by
different things, and the server may have to be setup differently
depending on which OS is trying to connect..  I think what happens is
that one OS will cycle through the possible protocols and choke on
something that the other OS needs to see.  So, you get one working and
break the other :(

I could never get IPSEC to work, it did seem like the most reasonable

  So? You can't install keymap and xmodkeys on your laptop, too?

  I know a bunch of people who think the same. Every letter in their e-mails
is in lower case. That's cute if you're pre-pubescent, but not when you're
in your 30's or 50's.

  Regardless, have you tried redefining that keycode as 0?

IPSEC sort of comes with 2k, you still have to install a separate
client, though (as in you need to install a client for a FreeS/WAN
server, if that is what you are running).  '98 won't work, something
about the IP stack being too antiquated.

Uh, I think he said: caps-lock, not shift.

In the unlikely event that anyone is interested in what I do, I
redefine the caps-lock key to be another tab key.  Autocompletion is
my very good and personal friend.  Effectively, I don't have a
caps-lock at all.  If I want caps, I just hold down one of those funny
shift keys for the duration.  And who really wants a shiftless
keyboard, anyway?  Aren't pinkies just _amazingly_ useful?!  ;-)

Derek, is that "seperate client" a download from Microsoft or a third 
party product like SSH Sentinal?

I had to look that one up, it is actually both, one part is from M$, the
other is from the ipsec programmers.  For instructions on setting up
FreeS/WAN goto:

http://vpn.ebootis.de

However, I never did get this to work, though I did like the
specifications, and I wish that I could have gotten it to work.

Good Luck,

Subject: [PLUG] Bits of random requests for help.
Message-ID: <E18ZJVz-0000gZ-00@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

I thought I'd ask the general PLUG populace for some assistance on these minor
bits. . . They're not particularily inter-related, just things I need to figure
out how to solve. Answer what you like :)

1) What do you recommend as a (PHP|PERL) method of charging credit cards. At the
web developer I used to work at, we had a credit card server (CCVS) that would
verify and charge credit cards; how would I do that, without having a spare
machine? I recall seeing modules on freshmeat for credit card services, and if I
recall aright, there's some hosting companies with shopping carts and ways to
charge credit cards.  What do you recommend?

2) If I have a website, what is the best way to keep a local copy of the
website; the web server is MS Windows 2000 and IIS; using rcopy / rsync isn't
what I need. But I do need a way to transverse the site and recollect any -new
or changed- web pages (I'm not the only developer for this site).

3) Similar to 2, in fact, I have a website with (example) 2000 pages, but only
500 links. What's the best way to make a list of those links local to the site
and a list of the files, and compare the two, to compile a list of files to
remove?  I see in the back of the perl cookbook there's a recipe for a
web-spider, and there's a method for comparing two arrays and listing which
elements are in one array and not the other. I could write a web-spider script
with that example, and then a directory listing script, et cetera ... but I
don't trust my web-spider scripting to keep it from doing endless loops. I'm
sure I'm not the first php/perl geek to have been issued an ASP website and have
a need to clean it up.


With 3. Many of the ASP pages use include files: a line such as
&lt;!-- #include file="../../inc/header.asp"--&gt; is very common. It's
theoretically possible I could write a script that would run under Activestate
Perl and would read the index.asp page, then any -links- and -includes-, then
follow those files and read them. But the question remains: how do I give such a
script brakes? And what's the best way to correlate that information?

Subject: [PLUG] Web Page Announcement
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0301162218260.1598-100000@joan.burling.com>

As promised, with Karl's departure there have been some changes with the
web site. I've spent a couple of hours tonight replacing the content
Karl put up with what was there on 20 December 2002. (Well, for the most
part: now that I've called it quits for the night, I can think of a couple
of things I left undone I meant to do. And I left some things that Karl
did that I personally thought were improvements.)

By the end of the weekend I'll be adding the last couple of things: some
links, & the history log that was on the bottom of the opening page.
If you think I have forgotten anything, please send me an email.

And I got rid of that stupid animated gif. Sorry, but as long as I have
any say in the matter, blink tabs & animated gifs will not be on this
web site.

What is currently there is not the final form. After talking this matter
over with Dave and a few others, I decided the best thing would be to
restore the content as it appeared before all of this happened. As soon
as I figure out how the PHP was set up, I'll be changing that. So if
you think the altered layout is better than what was before, please speak
up now. (Offline in private email to me, please.) Personally, I have
no opinion either way.

Zot O'Connor has proposed that we move to a Wiki setup. (I'll let him make
his pitch for this.) If there is enough interest for this, we'll start
migrating the webpage to this format. Again, I don't have any strong
opinion either way.

There will be a few more changes that most people will not see. But
before I -- or anyone -- insists on this, we will need a meeting of
interested parties. One thing I would like to see is a change notice
system for making important changes to this site, as well as other
steps to keep a rogue individual from repeating what we've all endured.

Thank you for your patience in this matter, & I'm looking forward to
making this website better than it was -- which is what everyone I believe
wants.

Geoff

Subject: [PLUG] email->changelog sort of application
Message-ID: <20030117172558.GA12616@rauhaus.org>

Greetings folks,

I'd like to set up a changelog system for our network devices, one
that's quick and simple.

Something like when one of our engineers makes a change to one of our
routers, then that engineer would send an email:

---
To: changelog at integratelecom.com
Subject: seattle-7206-2

Upgraded to IOS 12.1.17 -- Stafford
---

The changelog system would then strip off the mail headers, and append
the body to the changelog file for seattle-7206-2 (based on the
Subject:).

I'd also want to send a "Subject: send seattle-7206-2", and have it reply
by email with that changelog as the body.

I'll want to have the changelogs to also be viewable by http, but that
should be pretty trivial.

I'm planning on throwing this together with procmail, formmail, and a
bit of perl, but does anyone know of a package that would do this
without a lot of work?

Thanks,
--Stafford

Installing rancid was one of the first this I did at this job. Great
little package for automatically tracking configuration changes.

However, I'm looking to track engineer notes & observations on a
per-device basis, with an interface that is painless enough so that I can
get people to actually use it.

It seems like the qwest people only talk about "CAP" and "DMT"
technology.  The persistence of your connection would be determined by
the service your ISP is providing.

Static is always good :), but not a guarantee that your connection will
always be there, again, this is a function of the service that your ISP
is offering (or not offering).

Are you looking at all for CLI auditing (ie record every router command
typed) or just some sort of soft comments ("darn this cisco interface")?

If it is the former, then cisco aaa will log every router command input
somewhere (in addition to authentication and per-command authorization). 
We once had a web-based tool which would let you look at every CLI command
by device, user, etc.  Am not sure, but think that the open source tacacs
package will support this functionality.

If you are looking for instead some sort of note tracking, then ida know :(

No, we're already logging all commands via aaa to our tacacs server. All
I'm looking for is something for note taking, with an email interface
similar to majordomo/smartlist/whatever mailing list management

If no one comes up with a software solution, you could always plug an
audio cable between the line out of one machine and line in of another.
I wouldn't think that the signal degredation would matter a lot in a
situation like this.

I'm just finishing up a qwest dsl config for a customer.  I would 
recommend getting static ip's not so for much for the "always on" aspect, 
but for the good things a static ip can provide such as nameserver usage.

AFAIK, dsl is always on.  PPPoA/PPPoE just allows an ISP to structure the 
network topology to meet their needs.

Here's mine, me babbling on IRC and listening to honky tonk music with a 
groovy bacon background and KDE with the High Performance Liquid theme 
engine, which makes the KDE parts of it OS X-like and fast with alpha 
transparencies.

Hi.I moved from atlanta where we had like 10 white box
computer stores, where they sold good, quality
components and good prices.  Having moved out to
oregon, Im looking for the same thing when I build my
next box.  I've been to Frye's but I gotta tell ya, I
always end up with a bad taste because there seems to
be no way to see what they have before I show up and I
see reems of stuff being repackaged because it has
been returned.

Is there such a white box computer store in/near
portland?

thanks all!

If by "white box" you mean OEM parts rather than consumer packaged parts,
then the answer is yes.  If you mean something else, then I don't know.

You're going to get a ton of responses on this type of request (which
seems to come up every four to six weeks on this list).

I'll tell you that you'll get several posts in support of these two shops:

No, this is not true.  PPPoA is point to point
protocol over ATM connection.  which basically means
that you have an atm style dsl line now.  quite an
efficient type of dsl, if you can deal with qworst.  

PPPoE is over ethernet. 

hope that helps.

1. I saw the faw and realized that the question of what a good OEM store

2. I have looked but I cant find a way to search the mailing list? is 
there a search engine for plug?

Back-UPS CS 350 and CS 500 units. APC will replace the units.

Fry's takes some time to get used to, and their prices are not always
good, but their online branch, outpost.com, usually has the same selection
and prices as the store (you still don't know if something is in stock in
the store), and they share the part numbers, so you can easilly get the
part numbers for the items you want, call up Fry's and see if they have
this part.

jhead is a very small utility which can do a couple of operations on EXIF

You'll need to wait for release 2.0 of Mozilla I believe.
This is why I use Galeon. Works much better with external email clients.

FYI

Werner Puschitz has a web site outlining in good detail the installations of
Oracle 9i on Red Hat Linux 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 8.0 and on Red Hat 2.1 Advanced
Server. I have gone through most of these and have found them to be some of
the best instructions I've seen since Tim Bissetts deprecated 8i HOWTOS at:
http://jordan.fortwayne.com/oracle/ a couple years back.

Here's a link to Werner's site...
http://www.puschitz.com/InstallingOracle9i.html

Here is a summary of what he has posted:
Oracle 9iR2 (9.2.0) Database on Red Hat 2.1 Advanced Server (kernel
2.4.9-e.3, glibc 2.2.4-26)
Oracle 9iR2 (9.2.0) Database on Red Hat 8.0 (kernel 2.4.18-18.8.0, glibc
2.2.93-5)
Oracle 9iR2 (9.2.0) Database on Red Hat 7.3 (kernel 2.4.18-3, glibc

Hi Robby,

When you find things like this, post them to plug-jobs at pdxlinux.org and 
pasa-jobs at pasa.portland.or.us too.  I don't doubt that there are a number 
of people who read the jobs lists more closely than the main list.  (I 
always try to forward them when I find them, but my reading of the list is 
spotty.)

They are excellent documents, and we have Oracle running on several boxes 
thanks to them. The problem is that Oracle will ONLY support Oracle on RHAS 
and nothing else, we have run into a couple of problems that have forced us 
to move Oracle to RHAS boxes just to get support from Oracle for a couple of 
problems we've had.

Message-ID: <200301201739.54786.griffint@pobox.com>

Hello,

I'm playing with LDAP for authentication. I got everything working but found
an unfortunate feature. If the LDAP server goes down or there's a network
outage, it becomes impossible to log in to the client box even with accounts
that are defined in the local /etc/passwd file and not on the LDAP server,
including the root account.

Because of this I actually managed to lock myself out of my test box. It was
an LDAP server using itself for authentication. I shut down the server
software to change some settings. I logged out for some reason and then
couldn't get back in. I had to reboot to single user mode in order to recover.
This could be a nasty hazard for a remotely administered box.

Anyone know a way around this? I'd like root login not to depend on being
able to make a connection to the LDAP server.

Terry

Turns out the situation is worse than I thought.  The laptops are
mish-mash, and not all of them have floppy drives.  Tomorrow I'll be
able to make a complete inventory of all of them and see what exactly
I'm dealing with.  If they're really varied, then I may see if I can
repartition the disks and use a boot loader to select booting from a
partition just large enough to hold the floppy boot image or from the
native operating system.

I'll probably end up being at next month's clinic :)

I looked for this, and didn't find a specific PCMCIA package.  Are you
referring to etherboot on a floppy, or something else?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0301201818030.24776-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

First an apology for all the bounced messages the last few days.  I had a
server go down hard three days before it was going to be replace but
before all the hardware was tested.  Bummer!

Question.  Reference Mozilla and IIS 5.  I work where we use a Windows
based program via. a web interface.  The problem is I use Mozilla from
home and I'm getting an error message when I try to log in the
application.
   Prior to the _latest_ version I could access the page, pick and option
for the menu, get prompted for a username and password and then go to
work.  With the latest version I access the page, pick an option from
menu, and get a 'You are not authorized to view this page' and a referral
to Microsoft Support.

I'm trying to protect the #$%^&* programmers by not giving the company or
application name.  Even though this is not the first problem we've had
with the new version we're kind of stuck for now.  I work from home when
possible on the late night projects and this puts a real kink in that,
along with an hour and a half driving time to/from the office.  Rdesktop
and VNC help quite a bit but this is just plain a pain!

Anyway ... Does this error message and software combination ring a bell
with anyone.


TIA,
Rod

Never mind. I found the solution.

When you run 'authconfig' on Red Hat there's two places where you get to
select LDAP, once for "User Information" and once for "Authentication."
If you select LDAP for both you get the undesired behavior I described.
If you select LDAP only for "User Information" then you get what I would
consider desirable behavior. That is, when the LDAP server is down
LDAP users can't log in but local users (including root) can.

You might want to look at the changes made to the /etc/nsswitch.conf file when
each option is selected in the authconfig tool. This might come in handy when
you are using a system that doesn't have authconfig.

Recompile it with some optimizations!  :-)

I get a 75% or so speed increase just in launch times recompiling
Mozilla.  Get yourself a healthy set of CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS and compile
away.  Be aware, though, that if you want to use Java with it, you'll
need to compile it with GCC < 3.2 *or* recompile Java - which is a bear,
lemme tell ya (been working on that now, via Gentoo's emerge, for a day
or two).

But if you do recompile it with GCC <3.2, you won't get near the speed
improvement as if you compile it with GCC 3.2.

Oh, another option:  Use Galeon.  It's based around Mozilla, but much
more lightweight and quite a bit speedier (except actual rendering is
about on par as it *does* use Gecko for that).

Seems as though the purposely pause rendering enough that it appears
that the whole page loads at once. 

This change will cause things to render as they are downloaded.

Subject: [PLUG] House Audio Linux-style?
Message-ID: <3E2CEFD3.5030105@pacifier.com>

Anyone networked their house with cat5, then used the network to distribute 
audio?

Wanted:
	
Distribute analog?/digital audio from both a central audio source (like a 
dvd movie) and a local source (person in the kitchen wants to listen to the 
radio instead of the movie)

Local amplification.  The kitchen speakers need lots of eq which is only 
feasible using line-level.

Source selection.  The main stereo is in the living room, the mp3 server is 
in the basement (visual browsing of mp3s would be very nice).

As few always-on devices as possible.

==

What is currently working:

A wireless notebook can browse the basement fileserver and select mp3s for 
the kitchen, but cannot change sources (like to FM radio), nor can it affect 
the living room receiver (unless I attach the notebook's headphone jack to 
an aux input).

Currently the kitchen speakers cannot be linked to the living room receiver 
because of aforementioned eq issues, so they are powered from a seperate amp 
in the basement.  This is temporary until I can find or build a small 
reciever to live in the kitchen.

I've run cat5 to every room in the house (except the bathroom).


Since I don't think that a dedicated notebook for the kitchen will be 
happening anytime soon, nor a small lcd touchscreen, I thought a Handspring 
Visor could occasionally be synced to the mp3 database and used to select 
tunage, given an IR detector in the wall.  Problem is, I don't know what 
such an IR recvr-->Ethernet device would be named, so as to google.

I've been trying to hash this out for a while and am having trouble defining 
my topography.  Not sure even what's possible.  Hoping someone here has done 
something similiar and can help bang my head in the right direction.


This is a nice thing,
http://www.gspr.com/integra/nas23.html

I've got a ThinkNIC to which I've added a 40G HD, but it makes noise, 
generates heat and would require a monitor. But maybe a very small 5" lcd 
one...  Since the official website is currently useless, see here if 
interested http://www.hack-a-nic.com/intro.html

Cheers,
Kyle Accardi

Yes, on both counts.   Works great out of the box.  I have it connected to my 
home stereo system via RCA plugs and my home network via CAT5.  I understand 
the latest version of the server software supports multiple players however I 
don't have any direct knowledge of this.

The remote works as promised.  The mp3 tree that you designate is presented
as a menu that can be searched/sorted by album, genre, artist or just the 
tree itself.

One of the things I like best is the internet streaming feature.  We listen 
to somafm.com (groovesalad) a lot.

Prelink:

<from the freshmeat page>
prelink is a program which modifies ELF shared libraries and ELF
dynamically linked binaries, so that the time which dynamic linker needs
for their relocation at startup significantly decreases and also due to
fewer relocations the run-time memory consumption decreases too
(especially number of unshareable pages). Such prelinking information is
only used if all its dependent libraries have not changed since
prelinking, otherwise programs are relocated normally.

Subject: [PLUG] Matrox G450 MMS / XFree86 / Multihead / Linux
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0301211008420.32022-100000@glenfiddich.cse.ogi.edu>

Sorry for this message's odd Subject header, but I wanted lots of nice 
keywords: this is a little success story posted mostly for the benefit 
of Google trolls. :-)

One of our new faculty out at OGI spec-ed himself a nice new desktop 
machine shortly after he arrived last fall:

* P4
* gobs of RAM
* three LCD displays capable of 1600x1200
* dual boot Linux and Windows XP

Finances end up limiting his monitors to 1280x1024. Otherwise, the 
machine we got was pretty close:

* Dell OptiPlex: P4, 1GB RAM
* Matrox G450 MMS PCI card (capable of driving 4 displays)
* 3 Planar CT1904N 19" LCD displays.

According to our Windows admins, the Matrox developers did a great job 
with the XP drivers, which automagically discovered all the monitors 
and set them to their best resolution.

The XFree86 configuration -- my job -- was more complicated, but 
ultimately just as successful. Three screens of GNOME is pretty!

I've included the entire XF86Config file below, but here's the short 
recipe:

1. Make sure the middle of the three displays is attached to the 
   first Matrox PCI device. In our case, the Matrox showed up as four 
   PCI devices: 2:0:0, 2:4:0, 2:8:0, 2:12:0. So we made sure that 
   2:0:0 was attached to the middle monitory.

2. Install Matrox' enhanced XFree86 driver set:

   ftp://ftp.matrox.com/pub/mga/archive/linux/2002/mgadrivers-2.0-src.tgz

   New drivers as supposedly due Real Soon Now that will eliminate 
   many of the configuration hacks I needed, but these year-old 
   drivers are the best you can get right now.

3. Tell XF86Config about the monitors. Since all three are identical, 
   I only needed one Monitor section:

   Section "Monitor"
     Identifier   "Planar FCT1904N"
     VendorName   "Planar"
     ModelName    "FCT1904N"
     HorizSync    30 - 64
     VertRefresh  56 - 60
     Option      "dpms"
   EndSection

4. Tell XF86Config about the Matrox devices. I needed four Sections, 
   one per onboard device:

   Section "Device"
     Identifier  "Matrox G450 MMS 1" # increment as necessary
     Driver      "mga"
     VendorName  "Matrox"
     BoardName   "G45 MMS"
     BusID       "PCI:2:0:0"  # increment as necessary
     VideoRam    16384
     Option      "MGASDRAM"
   EndSection

   Usually, the VideoRam directive is redundant, but in our case we 
   needed it because otherwise X would think that only the first 
   physical device had enough memory to run at 1280x1024.

5. Define a Screen for each Matrox/Planar combo. This ended up being a 
   bit wacky since the monitors and Matrox devices aren't in sync 
   number-wise so that the middle screen is the first device. Other 
   than than, it was pretty straightforward:

   Section "Screen"
     Identifier "Screen1"           # increment as necessary
     Device     "Matrox G450 MMS 2" # assign as necessary
     Monitor    "Planar FCT1904N"
     DefaultDepth     16
     SubSection "Display"
       Depth     16
       Modes    "1280x1024" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
     EndSubSection
   EndSection

6. Define a three-screen layout:

   Section "ServerLayout"
     Identifier     "Three-screen layout"
     Screen         "Screen1" Leftof "Screen2"
     Screen         "Screen2" Leftof "Screen3"
     Screen         "Screen3"
     InputDevice    "Mouse0" "CorePointer"
     InputDevice    "Keyboard0" "CoreKeyboard"
   EndSection

Voila: a 3840x1024 desktop!

The only enduring problem is that I can't get the machine to go from X
mode to console mode. The displays hang, though everything else remain
operational. Thankfully, it's not much of a problem, we the machine
boots by default into runlevel 5, and X has no trouble allowing
logout/login sequences. Wierd, though.

Oh, and if you're running only two monitors, the Matrox PowerDesk
software looks like it could do a good job of configuring XFree86, but 
it's incapable of dealing with more than two monitors:

Sean,

I assume the above is controlled by the web interface
the gizmo has, right?  The LED on the unit itself is
small, so I would not think it could easily browse a
list of a few hundred MP3's.  Also, how are play lists
controlled?  What format are they stored in?  

Thanks.

Try a WIKI.  The various wiki implementations have plug-ins.  One of
these should have a mail-update feature.

The user need to log into a web site, but it is as easy as it gets for
actually editing.

[I haven't received my post yet, but I assume at least two of you did. 
Normally, I'd check the archive, but pdxlinux is mia...]

This looks very cool.  Don't really want another remote control to mess with 
and from the docs on the site, it sounds like they're using something 
generic given the strangely-named buttons.

How many buttons are really used?  Perhaps a small keyboard could be 
integrated.  Gotta look into the i2c accessories.

Is browsing the mp3 directory that easy with the 2-line flouro display?

Gotta check out the server code, too.  Perhaps the client's firmaware could 
provide eq.  There's always a million things these things _could_ do, just 
depends on how much the mfgr cripples the hardware to cut corners.

They use a generic sony remote, which is programmed as (if I remember right) 
cdplayer.

Most of the buttons are used.

I can stand 3-6 feet away and see it.  If I'm on the couch I can set it to 1 
large line display (not as usable).  The display hasn't really been much of a 
problem.  I usually select about 30 hours of music, press play and don't look 
at it until tomorrow.

The code is all open the, server code is perl...  I have no idea about the 
firmware, however there is a developer's mailing list.

Message-ID: <200301220110.10812.aschlemm@attbi.com>

I'm no network admin or guru but I've setup a few dual-homed systems 
that have two NICS and the systems are used as gateway/firewalls doing 
IP Masquerading/NAT for private networks. I'll add my $0.02 here as 
best as I can.

I'm a bit confused here but if I'm reading this right you have "Computer 
A" setup to use "Computer B" (webserver) as the gateway to the 10.1.x.x 
subnet? I don't think you need this extra entry as you have an entry 
for your 10.1.0.0 network with a netmask of 255.255.0.0 in your route 
table already. Packets matching 10.1.x.x would be routed to "Computer 
A's" eth1 NIC which is connected to your private network's switch or 
hub?

Another problem you have here is that unless your using NAT/IP 
Masquerading you'll never be able to ping any outside systems from your 
private network since you're using non-routable IP addresses on your 
systems there. These are IP address in the following ranges as defined 
by RFC 1918: 10.x.x.x/8, 192.168.x.x/16, and 172.16.x.x/12. Packets 
coming from/going to private networks are usually dropped into the bit 
bucket by most routers and firewalls since they aren't supposed appear 
in public. 

If you want to be able to access outside systems from your 10.x.x.x/8 
subnet you'll need to setup IP Masquerading/NAT on "Computer A" or do 
this with your Cisco DSL router if it supports this feature. I'm sorry 
I don't have DSL service so I don't know what the Cisco router can and 
can't do. It looks like you have setup your internal systems to use 
"Computer A"'s private IP address as their default gateway and that 
should be fine, You also say you've setup IP Forwarding on "Computer A" 
which is what you want so you're OK there.

To access your webserver that is on your private subnet, you would want 
to setup port forwarding on "Computer A" so that it redirects network 
packets going to port 80 on its DSL IP address to port 80 on your 
internal webserver, "Computer B." Since "Computer B" has a private IP 
address it can't be accessed directly by anyone outside of your private 
network so you'll need to do port forwarding here. I'm assuming that 
since you're setting up a DMZ that you want to allow systems outside 
your private network to access the webserver. You may be able to do 
port forwarding with the Cisco router but since I have no first-hand 
experience with it I don't know.

If you plan to have "Computer A" be your network's gateway/firewall 
you'll want to make sure the system is properly secured so it can't be 
easily compromised. This would include turning off all unnecessary 
services since many services can be used to gain access to a system if 
proper care isn't exercised.

Try changing the route to you internal - I am using Mandrake and it uses
its internal NIC as the second gateway like:

> 10.1.0.0         10.1.0.1        0.0.0.0              eth1

here is my route from my firewall

Destination   Gateway       Genmask         Flags Metric Ref  Use Iface
10.201.0.0    0.0.0.0       255.255.255.0   U     0      0      0 eth0
12.212.56.0   0.0.0.0       255.255.248.0   U     0      0      0 eth1

Eth0 is my internal NIC and is at 10.201.0.1

The PLUG server has been relocated to 198.107.38.238, and all
the DNS changes should be effective everywhere by now.  Actually,
the changes should have been effective by mid day yesterday.

Let me know if you hear of any problems.

So that does that mean I can put you down for April's Advanced Topic

David,

Thanks for keeping us up to date.  I've been trying to get onto the
site, and have experienced some of the turmoil you mentioned.  

I want to thank you for the nice demonstration of Linux on a CD that you
gave at the last PLUG meeting.  I looked for a link on the PLUG site,
but didn't find it (perhaps due to the turmoil mentioned above, perhaps
due to turmoil you mentioned in your personal life at the meeting).
However, I did find the Knoppix site, which I think is the one you
demonstrated.  I'm going to have my Microsoft Partner in crime burn us a
couple, so we can play around with it, and see if I can wean him off MS.


Thanks for the interesting, informative meetings.

Our host changed ISPs, which meant we had to change ip numbers on
our server (from 206.190.130.141 to 198.107.38.238).
Since everything has been in a turmoil lately, the DNS changes
didn't get made as they should have.  However, once these changes
take affect everything should work again.

                                          Sincerely,

I am running Mandrake 8.1

Now that they are filing for bankruptcy, what's the simplest way to migrate
to something 'still viable?'

What are my choices? I prefer stability, a mature product, (remember the
Dodge ad that went "We've changed everything. Again." To me that translates
to "We didn't get a damn thing right the first time."  I'd love to see a
distro that proclaims: "Our latest upgrade is only 14K, because we've got
everything just about PERFECT.")

So that would seem to be RedHat or possibly SuSe.

Any suggestions?

Mandrake is "not dead yet".  (Just resting?)

The chapter 11-like proceedings are supposedly to get out of a bunch of 
bad contracts they got involved with during the dot-com days.  (Though 
there may be more to this than is being let on here. I will have to ask 
some of the ex-Mandrake people.)

I would see how 9.1 looks before jumping ship.  If it does not show up by 
July, then you might want to look into it a bit more seriously.

Redhat 8.1 is starting to look very nice.  It uses the latest version of 
XFree86 and a bunch of bleeding edge stuff.  Some of it is very cool.  
(The beta has problems with dual processor machines though. Fixed in the 
Rawhide version.)

SuSE's installer does some things that make me wary of it.  Need to install 
it when i have a disk that can be totally reformatted.

More troubles converting .sxw files from open office. I created a
document at home using oo1.0.  Emailed it myself here and now I need to
save it in a format that my client can read (.doc or .pdf).  When I try
to open the resulting .doc file in Word, it launches a file conversion
dialogue and asks me what encoding I want to use. Nothing works right.
A pdf opens fine with my acrobat reader(version 4.05-5) on Linux but my
version 5 on windows just hangs and never even tries to open it.  
Are there any insights from the OO vets out there?  Can someone else try
and convert this for me, off list of course?  That might be a clue of
sorts.

Keep in mind that most "companies" that go into bankruptcy come out in a 
stronger position that they go in. Mandrake is expected to emerge from 
bankruptcy, and continue as a viable entity.

Step 1 would be to download a newer version of OO and see if it fixes
your problems.  1.0.2 just came out, and 1.0.1 is still available.

Well, once again I seem to have reached a workable solution seconds
after sending my email.  The document was set up in two columns.
Changing it to one column allowed it to be saved correctly, although the
bullets on my lists turned into little "10"s in black circles.  So
...one column it is.  Have others experienced this as well?

Colin,

  1.0.2 is a minor bug fix release. However, 1.1 is getting closer and among
other things it will include a fix for the scrolling problem I pointed out
to the developers. A rather interesting glitch, that one.

  When I loaded a winWord template and saved it as an OO template there was
no indication of trouble. Until I clicked on the down arrow at the bottom of
the scroll bar. Rather than scrolling down one line the document would --
very slowly -- scroll to the end of the document, then back up again before
stopping one line down from where I began. Using the thumb on the scroll bar
worked just fine. But, sometimes I'd forget and use the arrow key. Then I'd
go make a meal while waiting for the document to return to my control.

  I've discovered that if I select the wrong font for bullets or dingbats
they just won't print. Look OK on the monitor but turn into question marks
on the printed page. Makes me stay with my Bitstream Amerigo as a body text
font.

I knew there was a reason I don't use templates :)  In related news,
I've had a chance to try Lyx and have to say it doesn't seem too bad.
I'm only modifying documentation rather than creating it from scratch,
but it seems to work very well for what I need to do (updating the
documentation for the GNU Pic utilities).

Message-ID: <20030122233603.GA5551@blain.org>

For some reason, when I start up X windows w/ a gnome-session, Nautilus
goes crazy and opens up several instances of itself. When I say several,
I mean over 20 of them, and that's if I let it go. 

I have deleted my .gnome* .sawfish/ .nautilus/ directories to try to fix
the problem, but to no avail. I have even opened up the Sessions manager
and removed all instances of nautilus, but it still won't stop.

Could someone point me in the right direction for stopping the insanity?

I don't think he could install Debian.  He has a 56k modem line, if that. 
Most Debian distributions insist on downloading anything and everything.

Not to mention that Debian is not the most user friendly version of Linux.

Hi,
I don't want to start another distro war.
However, why don't you give a shot with SuSE Linux.
It's matching to the most if not all your requirements 
you've noted below.

  The impression I received from the bug-fix report is Real Soon Now: this
quarter. They suggested I hang on because the fixed version would soon be
available. The bug's still in 1.0.1 and 1.0.2.

  I use templates for letters, invoices and fax cover sheets. The template
that revealed the bug is a 14-page monster created by a regulatory agency
and it's filled with boxes, check boxes and other extreme formatting. I was
chastised the last time I sent them a permit application with the same
information but not on their "official" form. Sigh.

Are you saying that Debian doesn't come on CD's? Also, what do you mean
by "downloading anything and everything". Are you saying it won't
download off the CD? Please clue me in, because I don't understand what
your trying to say here.

Not everything, just the packages that are installed, which _can_ be
rather limited.  Also, you _can_ use CD-ROMs (if you can find them),
it's just a matter of setting your /etc/apt/sources.list
appropriately.  But sure, broadband is a pleasant thing to have.

"Debian is the answer" is a usual comment that come up when people ask 
about distributions.  Many of the Debian people (as well as others) are 
quite zealous on one side of the argument or the other.  

Personally I have some problems with Debian.  It does some things right 
and many things wrong.  It works if you run a pure Debian system, but does 
not react well if you do not.  (I had to deal with such an upgrade over 
the weekend.  2.2 to 3.0 does not upgrade as cleanly as the pro-debian 
crowd would like to believe.

Go to Debian.org and try to get current ISOs.  Damn near impossible.  (I 
tried.  I found them, but it took hours of searching.  And they were not 
"official".)  The current Debian discs I have found assume that you 
install enough to bootstrap and then download everything else via apt-get.  
That works if you have bandwidth.  

Guy does not have bandwidth.  (He lives in Warren, OR.  It is half way 
between here and the coast.)

As for the functionality of Debian...  My experiences do not match up to 
the ads.  Debian is not as trouble free as claimed, in my experience.  
(Especially during an upgrade.  Whoever decided to move /var/spool/mail to 
/var/mail and not move the spool and/or symlink things together needs to 
be *hurt*. By me.)

This conversation usually devolves into a religious war because some 
people believe that apt-get solves everything.  It doesn't.  Then again, I 
am at the point where I hate all distributions equally. Some more equally 
than others...

Gentoo is quite cool, but not for beginners.  (I built it on my laptop.  
That was a learning experience!)  The dependancy build system is quite 
nice.  Not to be installed on a 486 though...  (Not unless you have a few 
weeks for the install.)

Dave,

The link from list of presentation shows the html source document.  My

My first install took a while and it was on my ThinkPad 570E. It went pretty 
well, but some of the details took a while.

I just put it on my ThinkPad R31, and have had much more difficulty, not so 
much with Gentoo, as with Linux on this machine. It's been *very* 
educational.

Small footprint, fast programmes, you know exactly what's on your box when 
your done.

There are quite a few strong mature distributions.
Among these are:

      RedHat
      SuSE
      Mandrake
      Debian

All of these are very good distros, altho each has
certain advantages in particular situations.

If you like Mandrake, I would not jump ship until
I knew the ship was sinking.  Mandrake is a troubled
company, but certainly not a dead company at this
point.  Moreover, a lot of people love Mandrake Linux,
and Mandrake is Open Source.  Thus, if worse comes to
worse the Mandrake user community may take it over.
If Mandrake were close source, I would probably
recommend jumping ship NOW, but being OpenSource
makes the situation much more tolerable.

                                          Sincerely,
                                          David Mandel

The instructions for Gentoo assume that you have a cd-rom and a network 
card available at the same time.  It took some hacking to get around that.  
(Bootstrapping a network by hand is something I have not has to do since 
the Linux 1.0 days.)

It took about 2 weeks to get what I wanted installed on my little Vaio 
celeron 333.  It would have been better if I would have had the 40 gig 
drive in it at the time. (The current disk is faster.  The compiles took 
longer than they should due to a slow drive.)

One of these days I will build another Gentoo machine. For people who want 
to learn how things work under the hood, it is a good distro to go with.

A 'strong mature distribution' list with no Slackware?  :-)

Toss Slackware to the end of that list.

At this point I would add gentoo there as well.  (Though it depends on the 
userbase involved...)

Bizarre.  Have you tried closing all of them, then logging out?  Be sure to 
check "Save Current Setup".

I am very happy with Red Hat. I've been running it as my primary
workstation at home and at work now for a year. Red Hat 8.0 was a huge
step toward making the desktop a more pleasant environment, with really
nice fonts and more organized menus (still not perfect, but a big
improvement).

Most of my Linux experience has been with Red Hat, but I have no major
complaints. It's worked well as a server too, as I run two servers at
home and several at work.

There is really only one Debian distribution and it is easy to downloas
ISO images and burn them to install off CD.

Quite bizarre. I can't close all of them. It just keeps spawning new
windows left and right, with an occasional "Nautilus has crashed" dialog
box. I tried to let it run for as long as I could take it before I would
hit a console and killall nautilus. I then saved my session, logged
out/in and nautilus won't start. If I try to start it up again it goes
into a frenzy. Maybe I will just let it run it's course and see if it
will stop before it locks my whole system. Wish me luck. :)

so next time, silently ignore the advice, every distribution has warts. 
You find debian unsuitable, fine, I find RedHat, SuSE, Mandrake all
unsuitable.  There is no right answer, so get over it!

While I'm liking Gentoo... I don't think it meets the 'mature' end of
things.  The user base still seems fairly small and really, it is a
somewhat young distro.

I cut my list very very short, because I thought the original
poster wanted a short list.  However, there are a lot of fine
distributions out there.  Unfortunately, most distribution
makers have trouble getting continuous funding which leads
to problems maintaining and enhancing their distributions.

Sometimes I think the best way to build a speciality distribution
is to build it as a subset of one of the major distributions.

umm, if you prefer stability, why are you changing anything

  These threads on distributions are always interesting (except when they
degenerate into the "mine is bigger than yours" ego matches). I almost
always learn something useful. This most recent thread (initiated by the
possibility that Mandrake might roll over and float belly up in the ocean of
European bankruptcy laws) generated a couple of generic distribution
questions.

  My understanding is that underneath the hood all distributions will run
all end-user application software. Differences appear in installation tools
and techniques, degree of compliance with the linux standard base file system
hierarchy and file placement, administration tools and other comparatively
minor features. Each distribution targets a segment of the potential market
ranging from the click-and-drool crowd converting from an Etch-A-Sketch(R)
to the most deeply technical geek who won't use any distribution
comprehensible to mere mortals.

  I have some questions about distributions that I hope can be answered
without generating 'Net rage or wide diversions from the specific points.

  If I understand the concept of packages (and I don't care whose they are),
they make installation, upgrade and removal of an application easier and
quicker by tracking the libraries upon which the application depends and
notifying the user if those libraries are not present. If my understanding
is correct, how do users of non-package distributions (e.g., Slackware) cope
with dependencies when a new application (or an upgraded one) is installed
from source?

  I get notices from Red Hat when they have a package upgrade available that
welds shut a security hole in the existing package. This is a rather handy
tool for a non-SysAdmin like me who can't spend a lot of time each day
reading bug-tracking mail lists and other such sources to learn of
vulnerabilities removed. What do folks do to keep their systems secure when
the distribution they run is Slackware, gentoo, linux-from-scratch or
something else?

  In a non-critical way, I'm curious if a lot of the Red Hat x.0 (and
sometimes, x.1) bugginess is an unintended consequence of complexity from
wrapping tools in covers that make them easier for us
less-technically-sophisticated users?

  I would like to understand a bit better what's behind a lot of the tools
I've taken for granted for the past 4.5 years. I hope y'all can help
increase my knowledge and understanding without condemning any given vendor
or the folks who use the results of their efforts.

Thanks,

The following is the page I have trouble with in telling my Ipcop
install where to go to pick up my ipcop.tgz file. Where do I put the
.tgz file so the install box can get it?
Dirk

 This step is only needed if you are installing from bootable floppy and
FTP/Web Server. In the root directory  /  of the iso image there is a
file named  ipcop.tgz. This file contains a compressed image of the
IPCop hard drive. Copy this file to a machine that is running a web
server or FTP server. Put it where the server can find it during
install. During the install, IPCop will log in to your FTP or web server
as anonymous. Most servers do not allow anonymous users to access files
out of the server's hierarchy. Even though a directory appears at the
top level of the server, such as  /pub  they really are somewhere else,
such as  /anonftp/pub.

If you are creating your private network for the first time, change the
IP address of the server machine to be on the private, GREEN, network,
using a static address. You only need to do this for the duration of the
install.

If your server machine is connected to the Internet, remove the
connection and physically connect your IPCop PC and other machines
together. See Appendix A, for a discussion of your choices. If you are
using 192.168.1.1 for the IPCop PC, 192.168.1.2 is a good address for
the server. Set the server up with a static IP address, temporarily. You
will need to reboot any Windows PC if you change its IP address.

Verify that the IPCop installation file is available via the FTP command
or entering its URL from a browser, even if you have to do it from the
server machine. You can cancel the download or close your browser once
you are sure the URL works.

Generally speaking, when you compile things from source they are built
to correspond to the libraries on your system.  You take a tarball,
compile it against glibc 2.2.5, then it works with glibc 2.2.5 and not
2.3.1.

So, compiling things from source gets rid of many of those
specific-version dependencies.  When you do a ./configure, a
well-written program will search out and make sure you meet the
requirements, and if not, it'll give you a report of what you need,
which you can then grab the source for and compile.

It takes more time than using precompiled packages, but I think it is
just as easy most of the time.

When there's a known exploit of a Slackware package, Pat patches it as
quick as possible and then emails the slackware-security list.  Gentoo
has a similar system which is a bit more robust.  LFS folks are on their
own, I think.

That is surely part of t... but a great part of it, too, is that they
often use unstable development packages of important things in their
system.  8.0, I understand, used a prerelease version of glibc that
causes problems with some things.

7.0, IIRC, shipped with a prerelease version of gcc that didn't compile
things very well, especially c++ code.

Gentoo's announce mailing list is largely announcements re: security
fixes. Even if you don't read those, as soon as the ebuild is updated
and unmasked, you'd see it in your "emerge rsync && emerge world -up
--deep" sequence. That is roughly equivalent to debian's "apt-get
update && apt-get upgrade -s". The recent CVS vunerabilities were
patched faily quickly by this route.

Regardless of what distribution you use, it's worth _at least_
scanning the headlines at lwn.net if just to know what vulnerabilites
are out there. Most of the high-profile ones show up there. Some
places take longer than others to release patched versions. Do you
really want to wait for your distribution to tell you about the remote
root exploit in foo-1.23?

According to this article, 
http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-alpha/2002-10/msg00050.html, the 
maintainer of the glibc package told them it would be a good thing.

Yeah, gcc 2.95 was a bad thing. Unfortunately, it's nearly as painful going 
from 2.96 to 3.2, as RH 7.3 to 8.x and Mandrake 8.x(?) to 9.x did.

The thing is, it's all beta. Nothing is complete, and most of the time, 
someone will think their way is better. It's all a matter of opinion, and 
perspective.

I'm not sure if RH x.0 is really that much more buggy. I went through pretty
much all versions of RH since 3.2 I think, and I can't say that x.0 were
worse than the rest. They were more different, so they were harder to migrate
to, broke more upgrades, and were less compatible with previous releases
than the upgrades with changes in minor numbers. This is not a bug,
this is exactly why RH rolls major number for these releases. According to
the rules of RH version numbering, they roll the major number when backward
compatibility is broken. So if you upgrade to the new major, expect
that all old stuff will break, and if something does not it's a free bonus.
In practice most old stuff still works (I found that I could install old
compatibility libraries from RH7 which provide compatibility with RH 6 onto
RH 8.0 and compine a binary which actually runs on 6, 7, and 8, I was sure the
old libraries would not work, but they do).

> 7.0, IIRC, shipped with a prerelease version of gcc that didn't compile
And it did really awful job on bad C++ code which should have never compiled
in the first place but previous versions of GCC allowed it. Don't believe
everything you read on the net, alot of the people who bitched about the
compiler just got lazy and didn't want to fix their broken C++.

Subject: [PLUG] GRUB configuration
Message-ID: <20030123071334.85797.qmail@web9602.mail.yahoo.com>

I have a small Windows partition that is rarely
visited and boot Linux from a floppy. I am interested
in using GRUB as a boot loader, but consider it
essential to have the syntax correct. At present the
only Linux installation I am interested in booting is
on hdb6, that is on a second hard drive. The /boot
directory there shares hdb6 with the root filesystem;
it is not on a separate partition.

At some point, then, I expect to issue a command

/sbin/grub-install /dev/hda

This will be followed by a prompt:

grub>install (hd1,5)/boot/grub/stage1 d (hd0) \
(hd1,5)/boot/grub/stage2 p (hd1,5)/boot/grub/menu.lst

Did I get hooted off the "stage" yet? Anyhow, what is
in menu.lst? The minimum requirements would seem to be
these:

title Linux
kernel (hd1,5)/boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/hdb6

title Windoze
root(hd0,0)
makeactive
chainloader +1

One kernel parameter I have seen from previous
distributions on this computer is hdc=ide-scsi. I'm
not quite sure what it means, but would it be a good
idea to include it?

One more point: perhaps I'll want to add other
bootable Linux partitions in the future. Would I
simply add them to menu.lst, and of course not add a
boot loader to the MBR when installing them?

I would appreciate any advice from those experienced
in configuring GRUB. I won't proceed until I am
confident of what I'm doing.

You could connect the local analog sources to an audio input of each sound card.
(This is the usual way of playing audio CDs on a computer.) If you want to
distribute that local source to the other rooms, you could use a program like
liveice or darkice.

http://star.arm.ac.uk/~spm/software/liveice.html
http://darkice.sf.net/

For streaming video from a DVD, try VideoLAN. ( http://www.videolan.org/ ) It
claims to be able to do that, although I've never tried it.

Many (most?) sound chipsets include an amplifier, albeit not a very good one.

I don't see why you'd need to leave any devices always on, except that you
might want to leave them on to avoid having to turn them on and wait whenever
you want to use them (especially the server).

In what way do you want to affect the living room receiver? You could set it up so that the receiver gets its audio signal from a computer in the living room, and then control that computer from any of the other computers.

You could get a PDA and a CompactFlash-based Ethernet adapter for it. (Of
course, with a PDA you'd have the same problem as with the notebook -- its
amplifier, if it had one, wouldn't be good enough.)

It looks ok for a "turnkey" solution, but I think that a normal computer with a sound chipset can do most things that it can do. (Are there any sound cards that support digital audio in/out?)

To avoid the noise and heat of the HDD, you could netboot it ( see
http://www.ltsp.org/documentation/ltsp-3.0-4-en.html ) or you could use a
different kind of storage device, such as those that PDAs have.

Maybe the http server can log http requests? If so, you can look at the log to
see where the installer expects the file(s) to be.

I guess I don't understand this question.

My desktop machine is built entirely from source by hand (without
automated installation programs or scripts like Gentoo or whatever
has).  It has never had any kind of package management system on it.

A package, to me, is a source tarball from the maintainer's public
archive.  I download it, uncompress it and untar it, then run the
configure script with the --help option to see what it can do.

If there are dependencies that aren't met, the output of the configure
script should tell me.  Either a feature will be disabled because a
library isn't found or the configure will come to a dead stop because a
necessary requirement is not present.  The configure script will usually
let you know what the minimum compatible version should be as well.

As another poster noted, the interdependencies aren't quite as strict with
software built from source because the binaries are constructed using
whatever libraries you've got on hand.  When you upgrade lopster or
something, you're getting a precompiled binary that was built against a
very specific set of libraries and so you need to have dependent binaries
that exactly match those of the packager.  When I upgrade lopster, it just
links against what I've got so long as the functions are present.

Well, Slackware and Gentoo have distribution maintainers who keep on top
of those things.  Gentoo has a ports tree that is kept up-to-date with
relevant patches and so on.

For my desktop system (and, I assume, systems built using the LFS book),
I'm pretty much on my own.  I keep on top of important updates as much as
I can.  However, it's just my desktop system and it's not running any
services that are accessible through my firewall.

In my opinion, this is the one very positive feature of package management
systems.  I have had to maintain non-package-managed machines that were
running live services with active internet connections and it is no
feast.  All of my public servers (except one, which runs just a handful of
services that are fairly rigorously maintained) are Debian for this
reason.

My desktop machine ISN'T Debian because I am often playing with software
outside the maintainers' stable trees and don't want to have to build
*-dev packages for every weird library to keep my dpkg databse current and
functional.  Someday, I'll figure out how to easily do that and just
maintain my own apt source for bleeding edge packages.  Right now, it's
more effort than it's worth.

I think Fedor nailed this with x.0 vs X.Y(Y>0) distinctions.

I've never run Red Hat for many reasons.

If you want to learn, the very best thing you can do is throw some old
hardware together and build a system from scratch.  You'll "get it" after
you've got a full working system with all the software you normally use
built, installed, and configured.

I'm serious.  It's a great learning experience.

Oh, and commercial software sucks.

Rob,

  If it wasn't at the end of a long day I would have realized this, too. Of
course, the packages are pre-compiled binaries and they need library
versions against which they were compiled. Thank you for reminding me.

  So true! I've had more than my share of aborted configuration runs when
something wasn't found.

  IMO a lot depends on one's environment. You are in a public school
environment and I'm in a tiny office environment. Chances are more than good
that I don't run foo-1.23. I don't run my own Web or ftp servers because I
don't want to be distracted by keeping the secure. And, I don't need to
worry about internal threats -- unless I'm tired, not paying attention and
do something really stupid. Which I have done several times.

Red Hat 8.0 would be a good newbie distro. I have some Mandrake 9 and Red
Hat 8.0 burned discs, btw, if that would help the OP. Warren may be too

Also depends on whether you want to wait weeks to have a usable system.
Not sure a couple weeks of lost productivity is worth the nanoseconds of
time you save because your apps run a hair faster.

That's one of the nice things about SuSE. They provide patch RPMs for
software the requires patches or security fixes. So updates are rather
minimal badwidth-wise.

I have also enjoyed Everybody's Linux. I had it on my home workstation for about a year. It falls into the "easy" category. Their aim to convert Windoze users to Linux.  (Not a bad goal, if you ask me!) I found it to be nice and solid. They don't have the latest versions of everything -- sometimes a good thing. ;-)

I haven't used AIX 5 (I've used 4.2/4.3), but you might check that it's
not trying to use an NFS version that is unsupported.  I've run into
this with later versions of Solaris; it expects NFSv4 (or NFS over TCP)
and the Linux NFS server either doesn't support it or doesn't support it
well.

/var/mail is the standard location for mail files in most SysV OS's,
such as Solaris, HPUX, and AIX. The /var/spool/mail location was a
reflection of the BSD flavors. The Linux File Heirarchy Standard has
mail files in /var/mail, not /var/spool/mail.

Now, the person in RedHat land who decided to move init scripts from
/etc/init.d to /etc/rc.d/init.d must have really been hitting the crack
pipe.

The dependency tracking is not really a benefit of the packages at all,
at least not when you compare with building from tarballs. It's something
packages must provide in order to be usable at all, but the reason you
want to use them is totally different.
For the most part, it's file management.
What does the file /usr/lib/libfoo.1.3.4 symlinked to /usr/lib/libfoo do?
It's a file from a tarball you compiled some two years ago, do you still
remember which one? If your new tarball for SuperFoo creates libfoo2.4.1
during compilation, and wants to link that as libfoo, what should you do?
If you want to replace MiniFoo with SuperFoo, how do you uninstall all
files from MiniFoo if the package author did not provide "make uninstall"?
If WizBang1 used to install into /usr/bin and /usr/lib but WizBang2 now
installs in /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib, how do you make sure all of
WizBang1 files are deleted when you upgrade?

The package system allows you to easily handle situations like this. The price
for it is the dependency management, which the packages must do. Again,
you can make this problem somewhat easier if you get source packages and
rebuild them. Then, if source dependencies are correct, it won't even build
without the right stuff installed, but more often then not source dependencies
are incomplete, then "configure" will tell you what you're missing.

While I wouldn't add gentoo to the mature list, a couple weeks is really 
only for the first time you build a gentoo system.  That is a bit 
dependent on the speed of your system of course.  It's also a good 
system for just trying out stuff.

I don't count the speed of gentoo as it's main advantage.  I count their 
documentation at www.gentoo.org and via their forums the main advantage.

Well.. Gentoo wasn't built around the idea of folks running K6-2 350's.

If you're running an old CPU on an old system, Gentoo could certainly
take a week to compile.  On this slow (cost me $708) 1.7GHz P4 laptop, I
had a usable system (with X and fluxbox) in roughly ten hours, total.  I
was only actually attending the system for about two of those hours, and
that was only because I was screwing around trying to get funny things
working.  I would guess most folks only spend about an hour on it.

On the typical system (this 1.7GHz P4 doesn't compile very much quicker
than my super-Duron 650) you should be able to have a productive system
in a weekend.... certainly you won't lose a couple weeks of
productivity!  And my apps run more than a hair faster... Mozilla loads
up about twice as fast, optimized, as un-optimized.  Gentoo loads up
quicker than Slackware, and Slackware loads up a ton faster than RedHat
or Mandrake, etc. (can't speak for Debian - when I was running that, it
was inside vmware)

I've installed grub in the following manner:

$ grub
grub> root (hd1,5)  
grub> setup (hd0)
grup> quit

That alone should give you enough to get a system booted, although it
won't be loads of fun. Everything else is taken from your menu.lst at
boot time.

Something like this works for me:

title=Debian
root (hd1,6)
kernel /vmLinuz root=/dev/hdb7

title=Gentoo
root (hd4,5)
kernel /boot/bzImage root=/dev/hde6

title=Windows
rood (hd0,0) 
chainloader +1


That should get you up and running, keep in mind your devices will
probably be different. The important part is the first part,
installing grub on the correct device, if that is done correctly you
can boot anything, the menu.lst isn't critical, just convienent.

the hdc=ide-scsi param is only needed if you have a drive (hdc) that
needs scsi emulation. This is usually the case for cdr[w] drives. If
you have an ide cdr, you probably need a param like this.


Hope that helps,

As I understand it, Noorda has little to do with the Caldera
companies these days. If he does still have some control,
his motivation would be to put the squeeze on vendors that
he perceives as having predatory practices - not Linux users.
Historically, his main foe is Microsoft. It may be that this
move is designed to head off Microsoft's domination of the
Unix/Linux market.

I know this is unlikely, but wouldn't it be something if
SCO/Caldera/Noorda is actually doing us a favor?

Hi gang,

Anyone looking for something new and fun, I have a shiny new User Mode Linux 
tutorial on IBM DeveloperWorks. UML lets you make zillions of Linux virtual 
machines on a single PC. Great for testing unstable kernels and apps, 
practicing networking thingies, and all kinds of stuff. Anything that can be 
done on networking computers can be done inside UML. The UML authors have 
done a bang-up job, it's a wonderful project.
 Have fun!

Excellent! Really good job, Carla. Sheesh, back when I was editing

  Well, Carla. Aren't you already doing this on your z/series IBM mainframe?
Last I read about the linux port to that at least 40,000 linux machines
could be running, and they took about 25% of the system's resources. Now
_that's_ multitasking!

For me, that's the greatest benefit.  Package management is fast and easy
because of automatic dependency checking and installation.

Not my reason, sir.

I can see how you might feel that way.  That's not such a big deal to me
when I'm acting as full-time administrator.

Google will tell you.

Test it.  Write a little shell script that checks ldd and prints binaries
compiled against it.  Try the upgrade.  Modify the symlinks or update the
few packages that don't work.  Lots of options.

Yes, it's slightly more work.  Personally, I don't mind it for some
systems.  The dependency tracking is the thing I miss most.

./configure --prefix=/opt/foo <whatever>

Then `find /opt/foo` and some little scripts to delete the files it
creates.

Or, as some do, install each package in /opt/package and you can just rm
the tree.  (Or move it first and see if anything breaks -- remember, I'm
not advocating this for systems where stability is paramount.)

That's what --prefix is for.

I don't htink those situations are all that difficult to handle without
package management.  At least, I don't mind handling them.

The dependency management and assurance of reliability is the primary
reason to use the stable Debian tree.  One source.  Fairly rigorously
tested packages.  No dependencies that aren't readily available.  Free as
in beer and freedom.

Right.

As I said, if I end up with several desktops that I want configured
similarly with the kind of flexibility and updatability I can't get from
Debian, I'll start appropriately building deb packages and set up an
alternative sources.list on my local network.

But for now, with a couple of machines, it's easier to just manage them by
hand.

Again, reliability isn't the goal here.

And this might be the point at which we all pay for Linus' ethical
failure.

He insists on avoiding the political implications of the work and doesn't
have clean copyright authority over what exists to date.

If SCO finds anything, Linux is in serious danger and the GPL as a whole
could be compromised.

There is absolutely nothing stopping other organizations and individuals
from doing the same thing or, as Apple pointed out a couple of years ago,
adults who contributed source as minors from "changing their mind" and
demanding royalties from the every Linux distributor.

It is, however, important to note that no "license" (as SCO understands
the term) can be applied to works distributed already because those who
acquired the software never agreed to a usage restriction.  I think Boies
will understand that (but, as was seen in the Gore case, his apparent
ethics shift with his clients).

Thinking more about the HURD every day.

This is scary.

In other words, if you want ISOs, you pay for them.

"We'll give you a hard to do (comparatively) ftp installation, but we're 
not going to make it easy for you to try our product in any meaningful way. 
I mean, there is our downloadable iso of a working system, but it's read

I understand the need for revenue, but I wonder how many people they've 
lost because they couldn't download the latest and greatest to try. I know 
I'll never do that. On the other hand, I have downloaded both Redhat and 
Mandrake ISOs, and then when I found I liked the product, I've bought the 
next version I saw.

This is just plain FUD.

Gentoo has automation scripts and utilities and a patched, complete single
source tree.  So it's probably MUCH faster to install than building a
system from scratch by hand and that doesn't even take three days on
something better than a Celeron 300.

I can build a working system from source (with X) in a day.

As an experiment, I built a server from scratch on a P60 and THAT only
took two days.  (The glibc compile alone was about 8 hours.)  I'm still
using that system for DNS and a mailman installation.

Depends on how much you want.  If you want KDE and/or Gnome, it will take 
you a long time.  Took about two weeks to get everything I wanted built.  

It was also on a laptop with next to no drive cache only 128 megs of 
memory.

It all depends on what you want.  "Usable" depends on what you want to do.  
If you want to use X and have a bunch of apps it is going to take 
substantially longer that just building a basic mail server.

I like Gentoo.  It just takes a long time to install on slow hardware.  
(At least for what I want to do.)

Well, is it patents or is it copyrights we're dealing with in this case?
I suspect it's the latter and if that's the case the Congress and Supreme
Court seem to agree that copyrights can be extended indefinately - they
ignore the clause in the Constitution about copyrights being granted for
'limited times', or they redefining what 'limited' means.

I'm sure there are some lost sales because SuSE doesn't release ISO 
images but I would guess too that there would be a lot of people that 
would just free load off of the ISO images and never pay for a copy of 
the product after they've had a reasonable amount of time to test it. 

I know alot of people complain about there being no ISO images for 
OpenBSD as well. I can't say it's that big of deal not having ISO 
images for OpenBSD as they have an FTP install process that works very 
well if you have a decent speed net connection. By going the FTP 
install route alot of people get the latest version of OpenBSD for 
free. I know it bothers Theo de Raadt to see more people downloading 
OpenBSD via FTP than what are buying CDs to help support their work.

Since I actively use both OpenBSD and SuSE Linux I purchase CD sets of 
both OS's as each new version is released to try to do my little part 
to support the development work of both operating systems. The nice 
thing though is that if people don't want to pay there are free 
versions of Linux available to them.

A friend of mine who knows next to nothing about Linux downloaded and
installed Xandros. Without really knowing how, he was able to get it up
and running, share files with his Windows XP computer, and run a few
other things. I don't think it is free, I think it's $50 or $99 or
something, but it comes with Crossover Office. Also, he was able to
install and run Agent, a Windows news reader, under Wine, and didn't
have to configure anything. Anyway, I was impressed that he was able to
do all that from almost no Linux experience, and get a fully useful
machine in one day. I haven't seen it in person yet, but he says the
desktop is nicer than his WinXP desktop. It sounded like a great
distribution for intruducing Windows folks to the Linux world.

While I appreciate your sentiment, your understanding or articulation of
the issue isn't quite accurate.

Congress and the courts are interpretting "limited times" to mean any
duration that has, at a given instant, a specific endpoint.

Strictly speaking, that is within the bounds of the law.

But they can move that endpoint any time they want as far out into the
future as they want so long as the span can still be described as finite.

It's like saying a race is of "limited distance" because you set the
endpoint to be at some specific place.  If you move that endpoint to
another specific location while the runners are running, you've still got
a "limited distance" race.  And if you keep doing that every time a runner
gets within a block of the finish line, you're still not breaking the
rules even though the runners never finish.

Just to echo, I do this.  I've got a whole constellation of packages
built from source tarballs in a /packages hierarchy.  I run Debian
underneath this to let it take care of maintaining packages that I
don't.  Autoconf makes it easy.

  tar -C /src -xzvf foo-x.y.z.tar.gz 
  cd /src/foo-x.y.z 
  ./configure --prefix=/packages/foo 
  make

When I install a new version, I move the old version aside, as in:

  cd /packages 
  mv foo foo-old 
  cd /src/foo-x.y.z 
  make install

or, using symlinks, something like

  make install
  cd /packages
  mv foo foo-x.y.z
  ln -s foo-x.y.z foo

Package uninstall is 'rm -rf'.  Putting the /packages/foo/bin in the
$PATH ahead of /usr/bin means that if I remove my source compiled
package, path lookup falls through to the Debian package.

It's pretty trivial to set your sources.list to point to a cdrom instead
of the network.

You can get complete snapshots of the Debian archive from Cheapbytes.
<URL: http://www.cheapbytes.com/ >

The 3.0 Binary x86 set is 8 discs and runs about $18.  I think that's
pretty reasonable for someone who doesn't have a broadband connection.  

Then you add just ONE network deb source to your sources.list:  
security.debian.org.  Then you only use the dial-up to get things that you
REALLY need to keep current.

I guess I don't understand what that means.

Debian has MORE applications available for productivity, so that can't be
it.

Just about the same automatic and graphical configuration tools are
available, so that's not it, either.

Is it that the installation requires a person to understand a little bit
about how disk partitions correspond to devices which correspond to mount
points?  That's a fairly small niggle.  I mean, it's the only part of the
installation I had to explain to my friend who had never even installed
Windows before and now has a perfectly functional Debian system on her
desktop.

OK, so if "user friendly" means "encouraging ignorance by hiding every
possible functional element from the human being who is expected to use
and maintain the system", then yes.  Debian is terribly lacking in "user
friendliness".

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0301231625390.29639-100000@shaft.bitmine.net>

So, as of yesterday, my system started locking up again.  Hard lock-up in
X when either playing a video or using a graphical web browser.  Now,
since it's intermittent and I spend probably 80% of my PC time doing one
of those two things, I can't say there's a cause and the two applications
I use for those tasks don't really share much.

Anyway, this is EXACTLY the behavior I had before my last motherboard
burst into sparks and smoke.

So, I suspect that finally yet another capacitor has gone bad on this old
A-Bit board.  I think perhaps Russell made it happen because I finally
paid him for the thing.

Unless someone has a magical hint, I have to replace my motherboard again.

I'm looking for reliable and relatively inexpensive.  It must take two
1333MHz FSB Socket 370 Pentium III processors and at least two 512MB
PC1333 DIMMs and use an ATX power supply.

I'm going to make some calls myself, but if anyone has specific
recommendations or knows of someone who has some to pawn, let me know.

Foo and double foo.

I don't think we have any disagreement...  It's one of those 'letter of
the law' vs. 'spirit of the law' issues.  I seriously doubt that the
founding fathers had in mind that the 'limited time' should be constantly
extended as is being done now.

BTW: There was a very good segment on the copyright extension issue last
week on the PBS show "Now with Bill Moyers".

Heck, I can have a working system in a couple of hours. However, building KDE 
on my 1.06Ghz Thinkpad took an entire weekend.

Gentoo is definitely not for the instant gratification crowd. Though the 
gratification of building a Gentoo box is far greater than any I can get 
through the instant gratification of some other distro.

I'm surprised no one is mentioning Knoppix. It's meant to be a
CD-ROM-based distro, but it does have a handy little script on it that
make copying the contents of the CD over to a HDD a snap. I installed
Knoppix on a "new" Celeron 700 system a few weeks back, and it was by
far the easiest install I've ever done (even easier than that "other"
OS). Everything was auto-detected by the boot scripts. No problemo. Of
course, it *is* based on Debian, and that seems to give some PLUG
members absolute fits. <que foreboding music here>

Just out of curiosity, is there any good reason not to download the
source and compile it locally, and then make your own packages. That
way you can have the best of both worlds. How difficult is it to create
a new Debian package? This would solve the problem of having relatively
ancient software at hand if you're not willing to upgrade to the
"unstable" tree.

Damn.  Sorry about that.  I've got another one if you are interested.
Given the respective vintages, I suspect that if the one I sold you
went bad, eventually the one I have left will too, but it might be
useful until you can find a reliable replacement.  You can have it for
the price of a short bike ride (though I'll have to locate it and
extract it from my pile).

I don't know what the warranty status of these things is.  You'd think
that some sort of monetary settlement from A-bit would be in order,
considering that the damn things aren't being manufactured anymore.

For what it's worth, I ended up getting a SuperMicro
something-or-other, another dual P3 motherboard.  It was physically
bigger and had a different RAID chipset (Promise instead of HT (??)),
but at least it worked with the CPU's I had already invested in.  I
liked the VP6's feature set, but obviously the reliability sucked when
it started flaking out.

SuSE is an excellent distribution.
In fact, I run SuSE on my personal workstation - at home - at work -
everywhere.  For this use, I greatly prefer it to every other distro
I have used.

However, I don't use SuSE as a base for building my own distros
in part because I don't fully understand their licenses.

SuSE includes yast and yast2 which are nice admin tools, but they
are not Open Source.  SuSE owns these and seems to use them to
restrict redistribution of their complete distribution.

Thus, SuSE has decided not to put ISOs of their distro on the web
and I don't think anyone else could legally put SuSE ISOs on the web
without removing a few programs (like yast).

Actually, this kind of goes back to the question of "how do you
make money on OpenSource Software".  Programmers all have to face
this problem.  And so do distribution makers.  SuSE's solution
has been to hold back little utilities like yast.

                                          Sincerely,

I will GLADLY come pick this up.  Let me know when it's extracted.

Has A-Bit done nothing about it except honor the warranty on those that

No kidding.

If anybody here is very handy with the soldering of the type mentioned in
the links Steve posted, I'd be happy to entertain estimates on replacing
the capacitors on my failing board with brand new ones.

Anybody do this sort of thing?  I'd rather just work with some hobbyist
who's fairly confident than go to a shop where I'm paying for the
guarantee (i.e., paying "insurance" for a possible failed outcome).

What Linux are you running? Are you changing the video card too? If you have 
Xconfigurator, that is a fairly easy, painless way to run through the configs 
to make sure the new settings are good. Note that the X is uppercase. Best to 
log out of X before running it.

If you don't have Xconfigurator, c'mon back and we'll think of something else.

I read somewhere that Abit was repairing these even out of warranty. 
Downside was that it wasn't advance replacement; you had to send them your
bad board and wait for the fixed one back.  Took maybe 5 days?  ugh...

While we're talking about dual proc boards- can anyone recommend a dual P4
board?  They seem terribly expensive, and from what I've seen there are
few choices.  ENU sells an Asus dual Athlon board, and while I've never
had but Intel, am intrigued.  Two Athlon XP 2400s would offer 4Ghz,
woo-hoo! 1GB of RAM and an external RAID controller would be a speedy box.

Me too!  Let's have an Abit soldering party!  Lemme know, I'll buy beer &

It appears so. I purchased 20 Abit BH-6IIs in November of 2000. Their 
warranty says one year from manufacture or two years from purchase, 
whichever is longer. Although, I might have that backwards.

Either way, I have had 17 of the 20 motherboards go bad. The first 14 
failed prior to November 2002, and Abit traded them out. I've had three 
fail since then, with identical symptoms (capacitors that look like they 
ate too much..) and Abit says, "So sorry, those boards are out of warranty."

The boards I'm dealing with are slot 1 boards. I found that the Tyan 
Trinity 400 is a good replacement, since I can't seem to find too many slot 
one MBs anymore. It's a board with both a slot 1 and a socket 370.

In your XF86Config file[1], the only changes you'll need to make are
to the 'HorizSync' and 'VertRefresh' settings. You ought to be able to
get those range settings right out of the manual or, lacking that,
from the manufacturer's web site.

Less needful, but perhaps more pleasing, are changes to the resolution 
setting. My hunch is that you'll be moving from either 800x600 or 
1024x768 on the 15" monitor to 1280x1024 on the 19". The directive
you'll want to edit is 'Modes,' which is nested in a Screen section, 
e.g.,

  Section "Screen"
    # stuff
    Subsection "Display"
      # stuff
      Modes  "1024x768" "800x600"
    EndSubsection
  EndSection

Make your preferred resolution the first Modes setting. That should do 
it.

--Paul Heinlein <heinlein at attbi.com>

[1] Try 'locate XF86Config' to find its location on your system. On 
    Red Hat boxes, it's in the /etc/X11 directory.

    Oh, and the actual name of your XF86Config file might be 
    XF86Config-4. If you tell us what distro (name, version) you're 
    using, someone is bound to know exactly which file you'll need to 
    edit.

I replaced the caps on my ABit KA7 motherboard after they died.  I'd be
willing to replace yours.  It would be better if I could see the board 
first in order to attempt to spot failing caps.

BTW, my guess for the cost of the caps is $10 to $15.

This has been my experience as well,  but then I haven't had the time to 
get my Gentoo partion in shape and move the data over...

However, my experience with 8.1 hasn't been so good.  For reasons unclear 
to me Mozilla insists on printing everything in A4 size.  Given that I 
don't have any A4 paper around, this makes it a little frustrating.  Other 
things print fine in Letter size.

I would second this. I'd never make my own distro off of SuSE.

It happens that there's a lot of history here.   The following was 
explained to me by one of the former SuSE Germany employees I once met.

SuSE was one of the very first companies founded to try to make money with 
Linux, somehow.  I think it was founded in 1992.  Shortly after founding, 
another German company got SuSE's floppy images (no CDROMs then) and made 
their own distro.  From what I'm told the first version was SuSE's 
floppies with the names changed.  The next few revs weren't much better.  
Apparently, it got so bad that SuSE was in danger of going out of business 
(marketing has never been their strong point).

So, I think SuSE's had a once-burned-twice-shy attitude toward this for a 
long time.  They had the CDs out there primarily to counter-act any spin 
from Red Hat, but gave it up.  Note that Red Hat's high end server 
packages are also not available for download as ISOs and contain non-free 
software.

Yast source is available (on the web site too I believe), but it is not GPL 
nor does it meet Debian's free software guidelines.

> Thus, SuSE has decided not to put ISOs of their distro on the web
> and I don't think anyone else could legally put SuSE ISOs on the web
> without removing a few programs (like yast).

I think you can, but you cannot charge for them I believe.  I'd have to 
read the license again.  The Yast stuff walks near to open source, but it 
definitely is not open source (or free in the speech sense).

> Actually, this kind of goes back to the question of "how do you
> make money on OpenSource Software".  Programmers all have to face
> this problem.  And so do distribution makers.  SuSE's solution
> has been to hold back little utilities like yast.

Given that Mandrake is a very popular disto and they are in bankruptcy 
while SuSE is probably only marginally more popular and they have a much, 
much larger company (which isn't entirely solvent either), SuSE might have 
the right idea.  SuSE claims to have more developers than Red Hat.  I'm 
not sure of the truth of that, but I suspect they are at least close in 
size.

All the arguments about making money on Linux seem to assume that you have 
to make money selling the thing.  A lot of companies make money on Linux 
by using it to sell their other products.  HP just announced that they 
sold $2B worth of goods and services due to Linux last year.  Not bad.  
Somehow this just doesn't catch the eye of the press or most people.   I 
think that is where the real money is in Linux and why the uptake is 
large, but quiet.

Linux "revenue" comes from two major sources right now:

1) savings over buying other OSes and use of cheaper hardware.

2) used to sell other products. "We'll sell you this nice high-end computer 
system and throw in the OS for free!"

Neither of those look as spectacular as Microsoft until you start adding up 
how much money this must represent.    But, a lot is in savings, which 
means the whole pie is shrinking.

When a market gets commoditized, it can shrink, sometimes dramatically.

Best,
Kyle

  I've used WD drives for more than a decade with no problems. The only
catch is that some of their drives were (are?) not good so I never bought
those. I've had a Maxtor that was just fine, too.

  But, with Seagate 21M drives through my current WD 30G drive, I've had 2
drives fail (plus two in laptops) since 1986. That's not bad. I'm also of
the school that leaves machines on all the time, too.

  Anyway, using the better Western Digitals should give you the same milage
I've gained from 'em.

The nice thing about the HPT controller was that you could use it as a

with the integrated Promise RAID so I went and bought a Promise IDE
controller (non-RAID) and was happy again.

Regarding the paper size problems and SuSE...Make sure in your printer 
setup in YaST2 that you've got the proper paper size specified for your 
printer configuration. I know I somehow got A4 in their somehow for my 
locally connected inkjet printer and had to go back and correct the 
paper size. I've never had any weirdness since I corrected the paper 
size problem and I'm printing from a variety of KDE programs, Netscape 
7.x and OpenOffice 1.x without any problems now.

About my only problem has been dealing with a remote BSD system for a 
laser printer. For some reason I have extra large top margin on every 
page I try to print remotely through CUPS. For this reason I had to 
fall back and use LPRng intead. CUPS worked very nice for my locally 
connected inkjet printer but I need access to both printers and CUPS 
and LPRng are mutually exclusive. YasT2 even goes so far as to remove 
one or the other depending what printer daemon/spooler you choose to 
use.

If only CUPS supported a non-filtered forwarding queue to a remote 
printer like LPRng supports. I know the remote printer handles the 
Postscript output of all the programs I use but for some reason CUPS 
insists on performing local filtering first before sending the remote 
printer the data.

The motherboard that Jeme has was the third replacement I got from to
A-bit.  Each round trip took about 2 weeks, plus an hour roundtrip
drive out to Hillsboro.  I bought a replacement rather than wait.  One
of the advantages of selling it to Jeme is that I wasn't going to tear
apart my working machine *again* to see if the return was working, so
his testing was useful as a confirmation that it actually worked.

participating in Linuxfest Northwest 2003, but I haven't gotten
it done.  However, I did talk to Bill once and offered help,
and I certainly want to go to the event and I hope other
PLUG members will go as well.

                                               Dave Mandel

P.S.  I will try to get some more information on the event
and let people know.  We should probably try to arrange
some car pools, etc.

I've been using a pair of IBM DNES-309170W SCSI drives for a few years
& never had a problem with them. However, I've heard of people having
lots of problems with other makes of IBM hard drives.

My suggestion: figure out exactly which brand & make of hard drive you
want to try, then ask for feedback on it, preferrably from a larger
sample than the few hundred on this one mailing list.

I'm running RH 8 and migrating from a Viewsonic 15" monitor to a Dell P990 19" 
monitor.  I see in the manual that they list under specifications a heading 
called deflection frequency of Horizontal of 3 - 96 kHz and a vertical
of 48 - 120 Hz.  In another section they list several different values
for horizontal and vertical e.g. 1280 x 1024 the horizontal range from
64 - 91 kHz and the vertical range from 60 - 85 Hz.

TIA,
Jim

I've got a dymanic ip, and I want to host multiple domain's behind it.
I've heard that there is a way to configure nat so that domain_A goes
to system_A and domain_B goes to system_B, where there are separate
apache servers runing on each of said systems, or where there are
separate domains running on a particular system.

What I don't know is which HOWTO to peruse to find the method of doing
that. Ideas would be very cool!

The P990 will serve you well. I had one at my last job, and it was 
great. Here are the settings that worked for me:

   HorizSync   30.0-107.0
   VertRefresh 48.0-120.0

I ran it in 32-bit/1280x1024 mode, though you'll want to see what 
modes are supported by your video card.

The promise RAID controller that I played with last weekend was not a
true RAID controller; it requires special drivers to work properly,
which makes it a software RAID.  However, I got linux to boot it up and
run as a non-RAID controller (even though the BIOS on the controller is
convinced it is mirroring the drives), then implemented linux style
software RAID.  At that point, I realized that I didn't need the Promise
controller that badly (the RAID access was very slow), and switched the
whole RAID setup to the normal IDE, and it works very well.

If you need more IDE channels, don't waste money on the "RAID
controllers", just get a regular controller, linux can't really tell the
difference.

Good Luck,

I have the required skills (six months as a temp on the end of the
assembly line for printer circuit boards at Tektronix), but I don't have
a nice temperature controlled, grounded tip soldering iron.

If you can come up with an iron (I may be able to, but I'm not
positive), I will be willing to barter my time.

Subject: [PLUG] debian 3.0 adding xterm to fluxbox menu using debian menus
Message-ID: <1043389761.478.20.camel@laptop>

I am running debian "woody" and have recently install fluxbox as my
windowmanager (previously:blackbox), and I was trying to get a shortcut
to xterm on my right-click menu in the main section "Debian".  

I read the man pages for menus under debian and have tried creating a
.menu file in my home directory that contains the fluxbox menu, like
this:

?package(fluxbox):needs=fluxbox section="Debian" title="Xterm"
command="xterm -rv"

eof

After saving it, I've run update-menus -v and it appears to be
processing my ~/.menu directory, just like the man page said it would,
but I get no Xterm after quitting and restarting the X server.

I have also tried creating a ~/.menu-methods with the file fluxbox in
there that looks like this:

#!/bin/sh

cat > /home/bprew/out

eof

just like the man page said to do when you are trying to debug what
update-menus passes to menu-methods.  Running update-menus -v after that
shows it to be processing ~./menu-methods, but the file /home/bprew/out
does not exist.

So, this would lead me to conclude that nothing is getting passed to
menu-methods, but I cannot imagine this is the case as it has created
menus in the past when I have installed new debian packages and
continues to do it after my little tests when I install a new one.

So, this ultimately leads me to believe that I am mis-interpreting the
man pages and doing something wrong.  If anyone has any suggestions or
directions to point me in, I would appreciate it.  And yes Karl, I have
searched google, but I willing to admit that I may have not used the
best search words.

Thanks

Why don't you just edit the menu file by hand? Its a lot less
complicated. With my fluxbox 0.1.14 install is under ~.fluxbox/menu.
With your favorite editor, add the following line under the submenu that
you wish:

	[exec] (xterm) {xterm -rv}

[exec] = executable command
(*)= Title
{*}= Command

for more info see:

If it is installed, it should have a menu entry under "Debian/Xshell". 
Look in /usr/lib/menu, all default menu entries are there and I've had
great success with adding new entries there (don't forget to run
"update-menus" after you add the new listings).

Here is what I did after installing OpenOffice:

?package(local.openoffice):needs=X11 section=Apps/Tools title="OpenOffice" command="~/OpenOffice.org641/soffice"

There is actually no Debian "section".  I think the window manager may
consider everything in /usr/lib/menu to be "Debian menus". I haven't run
fluxbox, so I don't know what it does with menus, though.

I find it somewhat ironic that they advertise on this
page a utility called ServerMask, right next to the
splash of their findings.  This utility, if widely
used, would make this type of report extremly
difficult to validate.

When you look into the article, you can user their
method to validate the servers of a whole list of
companies.  Guess what comes up in the resultant web
page?  An advertisment for their ServerMask utility. 
Gee.  How convenient!

And why do they they think there is a market for this
type of utility?  

Impartial?  Hmmmm.

Hi All,

I have shell script that runs as a cron job, all it does is remove a
file, then copy a new file to that location.  This works, except that I
have no way of knowing if it fails (without rooting through the log
files).  I can also create a script that will email a message to me. 
What I would like to do is have the cron job send me an email if the
copy command fails.  What I tried was to modify my ping-the-servers
script, which has lines in it like this (this is just one line):

ping -c 3 www.infotects.com >> ${LOGFILE} || echo "The web server is
down, fix it now!" | mail -s "Web server is down" derek at infotects.com

This sends me an email only if the ping command fails (that is what the
double pipe does, it is a command level OR).  But in my copy script, I
have (again just one line):

cp -Rp /home/test/* /home/test2 || echo "copy failed, better fix it" |
mail -s "Copy Failed" derek at infotects.com

Which sends me an email even when the copy is successful!

I sure could use some ideas about how to make this work.

Thanks,

Derek Loree

Is this not the default behavior of cron?  It sends any stderr output to
the job owner via system mail.

You might want to just wrap the whole thing up so the error falls through
and maybe includes an echo to stderr in the event of failure to make sure
cron has SOMETHING to mail.

See, there's where I'm confused.  I'm using vixie cron and dcron and they
both just send mail all on their own if the job exits with an error.

This works just fine for me.  Perhaps you're not using the same shell?!?

You've got mine.

I think learning how the config file is written is awesome and you
should continue. However, I also wanted to point out that in rh8 there
is now a configuration tool in Hat->System Settings->Display with
various things to set, it will also probe your monitor and or give you a
list of monitors to choose from. At this point you still have to restart
X for the setting to take effect but I would imagine changing screen
resolutions and things like that on the fly will (It's now in the more
new versions of Xfree86) will happen in the next few releases...

My sister is still living in the darkside of computing, and just got
herself a brand new 'latest and greatest' system all set up. Now, my
email that is sent with gpg signatures (which she used to get just
fine) shows up with only a subject line and an attachment. She deletes
all messages with attachments - the virus thing.

Any ideas how I can direct her to fix this problem, short of me
sending my email in the clear?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0301250901110.13662-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  In the past two days I've seen messages that should have been rejected by
my postfix filters. In each case the undesired message (whose name in the
body of this message would prevent me posting), contains something like
this:

	rem<!vdydogntmc>oval

in the midst of a typical postfix filter word. In pine the word appears
whole until I turn on headers and see the html source.

  Does anyone know why this works and whether or not there's a generic regex
(other than putting '.*' between every two characters) to remove it's evil
intent?

Thanks,

Rich

Outlook Express, which she is probably using does not support
handling PGP/mime signatures properly (which mutt, your mua, creates
by default when you sign your mail).  For all its other flaws,
Outlook proper does have better mime support and so it will display
such signed mails properly, that may have been the mailer she was
using before. She can either use a mail client that supports PGP/mime
(most Windoze clients don't -- standards, what's that? =( )... or
if she doesn't want to switch, you could clear-sign your emails to
her. What I have in my .muttrc for sending signed mail to OE users
is:

macro compose S "Fgpg -a --clearsign -u <MY KEY ID>"

So from mutt, in the compose window I just hit 'S' to clear-sign
the mail, making it readable in OE... but which is kind of a pain
to do :/... since you'll have to turn off autosigning, if you have
it enabled, for these 'special cases'.

Kind regards,

Just an observation..Did you upload your public key to a key server? It
doesn't really do people that don't have your key any good if it can't
be authenticated. Here is what I get in evolution:

This message is digitally signed but can not be proven to be authentic.

gpg: armor header: Version: GnuPG v1.0.6 (GNU/Linux)
gpg: armor header: Comment: For info see http://www.gnupg.org
gpg: Signature made Sat 25 Jan 2003 07:43:47 AM PST using DSA key ID

Just a quick Linux spotting report:

Saw a machine in the arcade at the Beaverton Chuck E. Cheese that booted Red
Hat after they unplugged it.  It is a machine that takes your picture, then
"pretends" to draw a sketch of you.  You sit in front of a camera and watch
yourself on the monitor, then it displays an animation of a pencil drawing
your picture, then a grayscale printout pops out the front of the machine.
I just thought it was pretty unique.

There was a paper on this and another new technique at the recent MIT
spam conference.  If I understand correctly, what's happening below is
that the spammer's program is automatically inserting random html
between words to try to confuse body filters.

That paper said there is also another spammer tool around that uses html
tables to try to ensure that at no point two letters of the same word 
adjacent to each other in the raw message body.

Assuming you can't just arbitrarily reject messages with html comments,
a message body preprocessor that eliminates html comments before any
filtering happens should be feasible.  Or have the body filtering system
really understand html.

Protecting against the table method sounds harder.  Maybe you'd need an
ascii message body html renderer?

  If the folks that dream up these methods put the same amount of effort
into legitimate work we'd all be better off.

  I keep trying to do this but I cannot seem to create a postfix filter that
works. I try things like "/^<html>/i" and the filter ignores it. I'd like to
reject all html mail.

Well, the Key ID it found matches the one listed in my text signature
at the bottom of my message section. That should mean something. We
were supposed to have a keysigning party before I left the area, but
that never happened, so I dunno how to handle the rest of that
authentication stuff.

I'm assuming that not only is she living on the darkside, she's also
using it's built-in mail client.  See if you can convince her to switch
a more sensible client, like Netscape.  Your problems will go away, and
she'll have to less paranoid about attachments.

Message-ID: <1043561655.1514.2.camel@localhost.localdomain>

I just upgraded my machine to RedHat 8.0 and am having trouble getting
my gaim-applet to install.  I keep getting this error:
libpanel_applet.so.0 is needed by gaim-applet-0.59.8-1

What is this and why am I getting this error (obviously
libpanel_applet.so.0 is not installed, but why not)?

Any help will be greatly appreciated.  I don't relish the thought of
having to keep gaim open in only one terminal.

A quick search on rpmfind.net for libpanel_applet.so.0, shows that it
is contained in the gnome-core rpm. Do you have that rpm installed?

Well, a quick Google search indicates that it is part of gnome-core 1.4. RH8 
uses Gnome 2. Try to find a version of gaim-applet built for Gnome 2. If 
there isn't one, do a search on your system to see if any version of 
libpanel_applet.so is installed. If there is a newer version, make a 
libpanel_applet.so.0 soft link to it, and see if that fixes things.

If not, it may be possible to copy libpanel_applet.so.0 to your system, if you 
can find it separately. I don't think you want to install gnome-core 1.4. I 
don't know for certain, but I suspect it will mess up your Gnome 2 
installation.

I think that is probably because RH8 uses GTK/GNOME 2.x... and
gaim-applet is a 1.x thing.

I believe it is built in to .60 cvs... download a nightly tarball and
compile that.  It's still a work-in-progress, but has been quite stable
for me.  Be careful with Jabber, though.

Based on the other responses, I'd recommend seeing if you can get a
gaim-applit source RPM, (the one that's .src.rpm) and rebuild it with
rpm -ba x.src.rpm) and install the x.i386.rpm that it builds.  It might
work, because it will link with the new libpanel in GNOME2.  (It might
fail because the API changes sufficiently between the GNOME 1.4 and 2.)

It is a broadband connection. No LAN. There was only the initial startup when RedHat tried to download the updates to the system, [ there have been numerous updates to my home system since I installed RH 8 after it first came out], and my daughter's new install was trying to do that before we saw the first Gnome desktop. So it picked up and installed the MAC? address before I knew that it was doing it.

Let me add this;
When I tried to run up2date as root after this install,
my answer was this;

gpg : /root/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg : trustdb created

gpg : keyring : /root/.gnupg/secring.gpg : created

Is this trustdb a data base and the secring some kind of security key [ code ] ??

Looks like your hostname is screwed up.  Once you get logged in, type:
hostname.  If it comes back with the a0-00-9e-xxxxxxx, then retype
hostname <name of system>.  Check your host file in /etc.  Is your
hostname and IP address there?  If you are with attbi, then they are
giving you that hostname when you connect with their DHCP settings. 
Others can give you advice using attbi.com settings.

The paper size was easy to find in SuSE 8.0, but in 8.1 when I set it, it 
doesn't seem to change anything.  That's what's odd.  I've had to set 
applications manually.

I've set it in Yast, but it hasn't changed Mozilla.  Still looking...

Part of our partners are still running Winblows, the other part runs

What is the best method, software to communicate seamlessly between

Why don't you try gnomemeeting? Its fully compatible with MS Netmeeting
and sounds like it meets your specs. Linux Journal had a good write up
on it last month.

This is a good idea, do you have a short example?  I've seen a "trap"

I need this to be more flexible, easily change the person (or people)
that gets the error message, which may not be the person that gets all
the other system errors.

I used /bin/sh as the shell.  Maybe I had a typo or something.  I won't

Message-ID: <20030127211928.305D05701@joseph.doink.com>

  I want to install TiMidity++ on my Mandrake 9.0 system.  But,
  it "conflicts" with kdemultimedia.  I rebuilt TiMidity++ to
  avoid any file conflicts and then tried to install it with the
  --force and --nodeps rpm options.  This still isn't enough to
  override the kdemultimedia conflicts, presumably from a conflicts
  declaration in that package's specfile.

  Thoughts?  Thanks....

Can you tell us the exact error message you get?

If it's really not helpful, that's when I resort to sort through rpm 
spew:

  rpm -Uvv package.rpm > /tmp/rpmspew.txt 2>&1

Let me know if you need help interpreting that stuff.

I did:

rpm --nodeps --force -vv -U TiMidity++-2.11.3-1mdk_1kc.i586.rpm | & tee _LOG.i


> Let me know if you need help interpreting that stuff.


My understanding is that --nodeps should have avoided looking for 
dependencies, but it looks like rpm is treating conflicting packages 
differently, and I don't see any "conflict" specific rpm flags that 
wouldn't be activated with --nodeps and --force.

Any more ideas?

Thanks....

try rearranging the line

$ rpm -Uvv --nodeps TiMidity++-2.11.3-1mdk_1kc.i586.rpm


Never had a force or nodeps fail this way.  May be the way rpm parses its 
command line...

Oh bloody (the letter that comes after K)!  This works:

rpm -vv -U --force --nodeps TiMidity++-2.11.3-1mdk.i586.rpm timidity-instruments-1.0-15mdk.noarch.rpm

The command line _IS_ order dependent.  I guess that might make sense 
if one could turn force/deps on and off between package names listed 
on the command line.

Thanks for the idea!

If her IP address is set statically, then she simply
might not be connected. If she's set with DHCP and
acquiring an IP address but still can't ping, then
she's connected, but might be filtering TCP packets. I
believe DHCP uses UDP packets, so under those
circumstances, she could be acquiring an address but
not be able to ping. Check her firewall settings.

Another question to ask is: Can she ping by IP?  In other words, can she
ping the ip address of yahoo.com?  If she can but not by URL, it could
be a DNS issue.  Might seem simplistic but I haven't seen any mention of
this.

Message-ID: <1043727121.980.7.camel@localhost.localdomain>

I am having issues after upgrading to RedHat 8.0.  In hind sight, I
should have done a clean install but I was lazy and didn't want to have
to reinstall all my software.  After troubleshooting a lot of my issues,
I'm finding one that's particularly stubborn.  I cannot get the hardware
browser to work.  When I invoke hwbrowser from the command line, I get
the following series of errors.  When clicking hardware browser from the
menu, the browser appears for a short time (only the shell, no hardware)
before closing.  Any idea on how to fix the problem?  Perhaps
reinstalling the hardware browser, but I somehow don't think that that
is the answer.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0301272032130.4965-100000@shell1.aracnet.com>


I'm using Mandrake 9.0 with the version of KDE that comes with it
(I think it's 3.0.3) and cups.
Cups is set up to send print jobs to a different machine on the network
that acts as the printserver.  When I try to print from, for example,
konqueror, it takes a couple of minutes for the kprinter dialog box to
come up.

I can print from the commandline just fine and I can print test pages from
the web interface to the cups admin tool ( here: http://localhost:631/ ),
and I can print from KDE apps, but it just takes a couple of minutes
before the kprinter gui comes up.

Any ideas?  Is kprinter somehow trying to search the whole network trying
to find remote printers (even though I've only got one setup)?

Damn top-quoters!  :P  (Scrollin', scrollin', scrollin'. . . .)

By the way, I cannot allow Linux From Scratch to go unmentioned in this
thread, comprehensive as it's become.  First of several desktop systems
I've built that really worked for me.

  To satisfy my curiosity, please tell me why any linux OS upgrade
(regardless of distribution) should break installed -- end user -- software?

  In my naivety I believe that if I install all my software in /usr/local or
/opt then config files should be left untouched by the OS upgrade and only
incompatible library versions would cause problems if the old versions are
removed.

  I, too, had major problems with config files being overwritten without my
knowledge or permission when I upgraded from RH 6.2 to 7.3. Am I wrong in
thinking that this shouldn't happen? What am I missing here?

Thanks,

Rich

You're not wrong. I think this is inevitable when you use a
product that always tries to be on the bleeding edge. Distributions
that are more stable, like Debian, have far fewer of these problems
but you pay for it by not always having the latest toys.

Debian. It isn't perfect, but at least it asks if you want to hose your
config files.

Couldn't help it :)

  Aha! Well, for a non-professional, end user like me the bleeding edge is
not where I want to be. I want to be fairly current, but I need to use the
computer for billable work without interruptions (other than coffee and its
inevitable results).

  Time to rethink my inertia.

  Actually, so did Red Hat. From 4.0 (or 4.1, I forget which was the first I
installed) through 6.2 I was told either that the old config file was being
saved as *.sav or that the new one was placed on the hard drive as *.rpmnew.
Never before did the installer behave as it did then.

  As the old cliche goes: once bitten, twice shy. The RH 8.0 disk I picked
up at the clinic when the road tour was here sits on the desk while the
notebook hasn't yet been upgraded.

It helps tremendously if you don't quote the whole previous message. What 
you have quoted includes the signature from the previous post. But then, 
I've seen messages here on plug with 5 copies of the list signature.

I think the issue is that you are doing a major upgrade that also
includes upgrading the application itself as well in a lot of cases. The
config files have often changed substantially and its not possible to
use the old file. Also, the versions of libraries and things that the
application is dependent on get upgraded as well causing a potential
break in the application. Even if you compiled it yourself, these things
are likely to happen since the act of compiling from source utilizes the
existing libraries on you system.

Just my $0.02.

As you pointed out, incompatible library versions is the first thing I 
think about.

>/opt then config files should be left untouched by the OS upgrade and only

In theory, yes. But it all depends on where the program is storing said 
config files. Yes, it should be /opt/etc or /usr/local/etc, but sometimes 
they still store this stuff in /etc. This is also why a full backup is 
always recommended prior to any changes to your system. Given the vast 
complexity of any system, and the fact that it's impossible for a 
programmer to account for ALL contingencies, a backup becomes a necessity. 
On the surface, it appears that all they need to do is ignore /opt and 
/usr/local, but there may be cases where that's not possible.

Well, if the package manager isn't used to install the "user" software, 
then it's not going to know about the package during the upgrade. Very 
rarely do I install things without the package manager. Even a tarball of 
source can be compiled into an RPM for installation. It's a little more 
work, but it saves in the long run when you upgrade.

Just my thoughts... YMMV and TIMTOWTDI

Actually, according to the FHS, it should be in /etc/opt or just /etc.

I don't think I'd call a Red Hat .2 or .3 release "bleeding edge".  In
the year+ since the .0 was released, they get pretty stable.  I don't
think I'd call Debian's releases "stable" either--I'd call them
obsolete.  I mean, if you want that level of "stability", you could go
farther and install from this Slackware 3.0 CD I have from the Nov 1995
InfoMagic CD-ROM.  Ships with a good, solid 1.2.13 kernel.

One of the first things you should always do when upgrading is to look
at the {/root,/tmp}/upgrade.log and find out what config files were
renamed.

I knew it was a risky thing suggesting that distributions

The vocal aren't always the many. I happen to use it, but 
there are many viable alternatives. Mac users are always 
expecting me to trash their computers, but for me, it's a 
"wahtever" issue. Whatever gets your work done, that's the 
right thing for you to use. If it's barely working for you, 
why not look around and see what else is out there? Just 
because it's all someone knows doesn't make it the best.

I'm preacing to the choir now, so I'll stop.

I've spent quite a bit of time looking but I can't find a decent anwser or 
pointer.  Possibly I've got the wrong terms.
   I just installed RHL 8.0 from a downloaded set of ISOs.  No upgrade
since I had a new SCSI hard drive and contoller and a mostly stock
Workstation configuration.  Back in my RHL 7.x days I had my desktop
pretty much like I wanted it and I did save all the .desktop files for use
later.  The problem is I can't figure out how to get a drop-down (pop-up)
menu on the panel likeI had before.  There is nothing I can find at the
Gnome site or the on-machine help that explains how.
   On the old system I had a directory in ~/.gnome/apps/ called Connect 
and it had subdirectories which had .desktop files.  Thinking I'd be 
clever I copied the Connect directory in to .gnome/apps/ (and 
.gnome2/apps/ to be sure) but no joy.  Any ideas or pointers to how to do 
this?

This does bring up one of my really big conplaints about the Linux
desktop.  There seems to be a race to have the 'coolest' looking desktop
but no real effort to make it personally functional.  Have you noticed it
is very difficult to really customise.
   On the up side I didn't have to fiddle with the /etc/X11/ stuff to get
ssh-agent running - it is.  I just open a window and do a ssh-add and can
securely connect to the world with minimal hassle.

Message-ID: <XVRQ08A7B0XTE9C9JHUT5Z5YC9DAGF21.3e372c6f@mike>

One of my servers graduated to being headless today.

I was used to running a distributed computing app from 
distributedfolding.org. 

As soon as I remembered to start the app, I realized that I 
needed to open a connection to run the app, and that the app 
would run in the window, stopping whan I closed the 
connection. 

It is prob pretty simple, but I have no idea how to do this.

$ (program-name&)

the ()'s detach this process from it's parent (the terminal), the &
makes it run in the background. You should be able to do that, then
logout.

Another option is to use screen, then you can re-attach a terminal to
the process at same point. (screen -r)

ie:

$ screen <program>

C-ad detaches the current screen sesion, then logout.

$ screen -r # reattaches to this terminal, so you can interact
            # with the program again.

well, assuming you're using ssh to connect, (which, of course, you are
;-)), simply append the command you want to execute to the ssh command
line. Since it's an X app, you probably want ssh to background itself,
so you'd launch a remote xterm, for example, like:

$ ssh -f host xterm

or more specifically:
$ ssh -f user at host /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm

If it's an X app, then VNC will work for you.  If it's just a terminal
app, then screen or even just nohup.

It doesn't need X, so I usually start it (as root) with "./foldit"

So to do this I enter "(./foldit)?

I did not intend to start a debate on the virtues of one flavor of Linux
to another.  I'm wondering if anyone has a solution to my dilemma?

You have to background it, or you won't be able to logout correctly.
(./foldit&)

but screen is a _much_ better solution.. Here is a page with more details:

If you want to make sure it runs all the time, write script that checks if 
it's running, and starts it if it's not. Then put the script in a cron job 
to run every 10 minutes or so...

I'm not sure if there is one. RH8 works great in the confines of their 
approved, supported apps- OpenOffice, bluecurve, etc.  I never did get the 
hardware browser to work. I didn't check their bugtracking or user list, 
those would be good places to start. RH8 is very bleeding-edge, it's major 
leaps forward are going all-out for Unicode support, and trying to build a 
standardized, business-friendly interface. Which I still don't get- use 
Gnome, use KDE, use Xfce, use IceWM, use whatever- this weird morphing of KDE 
and Gnome makes no sense to me.

What's odd is the hardware browser comes with RedHat.  I did not install
it.

Lots of stuff comes on the distribution disks that are provided 'for 
convenience', but they don't support them, or even claim they will work.

Actually probably the best way is to preface your

nohup

and then continue it with &

ie 
say

nohup setiatihome&

will run setiathome even when I log out.
This is exactly what 'nohup' is for

This is news to me.  I haven't looked at 8.0, but have noticed that RH has 
significantly reduced the included apps at least since before 6.2.

My guess was that they got popular enough to need to cut down on support 
calls, so they only included what they knew to work.

Don't know if it's still true, but SuSE used to ship 8 or 9 CDs.  If you 
didn't have a decent pipe, you could check out all kinds of stuff.  Find 
something you like and get the latest version from the maintainer.  That was 
about the time RH cut back to 3 cds.

Where does RH disclaim their included apps?  Or do I have a hook in my mouth?

Redhat INCREASED to 6 CDs with the 7.3 release. 3 binaries, 2 source, and 1 
doc.

7.0 had 2 binaries, one source, and one doc, and then the powertools CD.

Redhat 6.2 had one binary CD, one source, one doc and then the powertools CD.

The powertools CD had lots of stuff on it, but it was both binaries and 
source for that, in one CD.

SuSE currently ships 6 CD and one DVD that contains the same as the 6 CDs. 
It's still binaries, source and docs, so it's about the same.

As far as I know, none of the distributions will support the third part 
apps they include with their distribution. Redhat has always stated that 
your support is for "Installation only". Caldera and SuSE say the same 
thing. I know, as I've written both of them. At one point, the NIS stuff 
shipped with SuSE didn't play well with Redhat, but they wouldn't support 
it, as they didn't write it, and it DID install correctly.

OK, I don't want to leave the wrong impression here. I doubt that any of the 
distros offer support for every weirdo app that comes down the pipe. Sometime 
back I asked them about the problems with Abiword and Gnumeric, and a few 
other issues, and this was the response:

"To preface, in Red Hat Linux 8.0 we take the best of breed applications 
and spend
resources to refine that specific set.  Open Office and Mozilla are 
perfect examples.  Abiword and Gnumeric are examples of applications 
that are included as "extras" in our menus whereas Open Office is really 
our preferred office application."

This is where being on the bleeding edge left some apps behind; Abiword and 
Gnumeric do not yet support Unicode. Lots of other apps don't either. The fix 
was reported in the release notes. The release notes are quite comprehensive; 
combine them with the bug tracker and the user list, and you ought to be able 
to figure most things out. This is the price of using a bleeding-edge 
distribution. 

For users who just want things to work, and have less hassle, previous 
versions of Red Hat are still available. 7.3 is solid.

Yup ... sure can.  Problem is it ain't my menu as a drawer it's someone

With Russ's (thanks) corrections on the cd counts in mind, what I meant to 
say was that the Unicode break was probably the whole trouble that started 
this thread.  My rule is to never expect upgrades to work.  It often goes 
just fine, and you get a warm happy feeling.  But when the big number 
changes, clouds roll in.

Suspect some lingering lib that 'hardware browser' is counting on is not hep 
to Unicode.  I'm making stuff up, but that's not the point.
RH shouldn't release bleeding-edge stuff, that's what betas are for.  On the 
other hand, they did a beta for 8.0 and perhaps "bleeding-edge" is too 
strong a word for 8.0

But I wait for x.2 releases before getting all sweaty.

I know python is a snake, that's it.

so make sure you have the proper nautilus installed.  This however is

$ rpm -q python

Case in point: the acl and libacl packages distributed with Red Hat 
8.0. The filesystems supported by Red Hat's kernel don't actually 
support ACLs, but the acl packages are supplied in case you want to do 
some experimentation in that area.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0301290721110.5850-100000@glenfiddich.cse.ogi.edu>

One of the systems I support, a generic Dell box running Red Hat 8.0, 
wasn't initially configured with any USB devices. Then its user got 
one of those nifty 64MB NexDisk USB storage devices that's about the 
size of a rabbit's foot.

It took me a while to figure out how to get Red Hat to work and play 
with USB hardware when it wasn't part of the initial installation. So, 
in case anyone's wondering, here's the recipe, no reboots required:

  # first, figure out whether you've got an ohci or a uhci usb 
  # controller
  modprobe usbcore
  modprobe usb-uhci
  # no error messages means you've probably got a uhci device,
  # though it's worth checking dmesg just to make sure. if not,
  # see if the ohci stuff will work:
  modprobe usb-ohci

  # once you've got that down then add it to your modules config
  # so that red hat's init scripts will load the usb stuff 
  # automatically at next boot time
  cat 'alias usb-controller usb-uhci' >> /etc/modules.conf

I thought about mentioning Knoppix, but didn't because:

          -  I wanted to keep my list short
          -  Altho Knoppix works fine from a hard disk, it was intended
             to run off of a CD.  Because of this, I classify it as
             a speciality distro rather than a general purpose distro.
             On the other hand, I would certainly use certain Knoppix
             elements if I designed and built another distribution
             myself.  Indeed, I consider using Knoppix as the primary
             base distribution and I wouldn't normally consider using
             a speciality distribution for this.  Well, except for the
             distro building distributions.
          -  The software portion of the Knoppix distro seems very
             mature, but supporting items such as documention is
             not yet mature.  (Yes, I know one can generally use any
             Linux/Unix documentation, especially Debian docs; but
             still ...)

The bottom line is that I like Knoppix and I'm using it more and more;
but I still use SuSE on my desktop and based most of my servers on
RedHat.

                                          Sincerely,

Subject: [PLUG] iptables logging help?
Message-ID: <E18dwMF-000447-00@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

Good morning.
I think, what I have, is a failure to read a man page properly.

I'm running iptables on a redhat box.
IPTables:iptables v1.2.6a
RedHat: 8.0 (with most of the current updates, nothing related to iptables or
syslogd).

In my firewall script is this line:

--> /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 1434 -j LOG

which results in this line from "# iptables -L"

--> LOG udp -- anywhere anywhere udp dpt:ms-sql-m LOG level warning

Which "looks" right. Except I can't find any messages in any of my log files
related to it, which seems wrong at this point.  I haven't tried something more
general. 

I'm assuming that those messages will go to /var/log/messages- but there are no
"warning" level lines in /etc/syslogd.conf, so I don't know for sure where those
logging messages will go.  
Here are my questions;

What is the syslog "facility" for iptables? So I could control the syslog messages?

How do I use "--log-level info" in my iptables rule? If I try to change the
logging level from "warning" to "info," (because of the *.info line in
syslogd.conf), when I run the firewall script I get "unknown arg --log-level".

Any help would be appreciated, of course :)

The section of the iptables(8) man page that deals with the 
--log-level option is fairly cryptic. Try this

  /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 1434 -j LOG --log-level INFO

Also, you may need to load the logging module manually: 

  modprobe ipt_LOG

I didn't have the logging module loaded- that's the first thing. Looks like

Subject: [PLUG] Syncing Handspring Problem
Message-ID: <200301291336.57715.sysop@newwind.com>

I'm trying to figure out how to sync my Handspring Visor using the USB port 
under Linux (SuSe 8.0). If I monitor the USB port, I see the Visor when I 
push the sync button, but can't connect to it with either jpilot or kpilot. A 
coworker told me that it may be becuse the code expects a pilot, not a visor. 
I find that hard to believe since they share the same operating system. It 
may be as simple as not using the correct device on Linux. I can't find the 
info in any of the howto's.

Thanks.

It works, have you seen this site
http://usbvisor.sourceforge.net/index.php3

I don't use my Visor often, but I think you plug it in _before_ launching 
jpilot.  Then click 'sync' from the app.  It helps to have a treminal window 
open running
# tail -f /var/log/messages

Also, make sure jpilot is loking at the right device

I made a link, /dev/pilot -> /dev/ttyUSB1

but for some reason, I have jpilot set to /dev/ttyUSB1, but the symlink 
should work equally.

Others here may have better advice

      -M     The  user  home directory will not be created, even if the system

  So you end up with a homeless user. Tsch-tsch!

  Not necessary. We sync a Visor Pro with jpilot here (using the serial
cradle, not the USB one) and it works just fine. jpilot is open at the time.
Works with all the Palm and Kyocera models we've had, too.

For some reason, I tried it again after reading your message and it worked 
perfectly. The _only_ difference was that I pushed the sync button on the 
Visor before pressing sync in JPilot. Maybe that was the secret.

Thanks for your answer and the web page info.

Yes/No/Maybe.

Php is good if you want to learn some basic fundamentals of programming
and have a purpose (creating dynamic content on a webpage..)

O'Reilly PHP Cookbook (just got it...) is nice... but for a new person my
php in "24 hours" book is still a nice basic intro to it with daily
lessons.

I learned PHP last year after only having experience with Visual Basic and HTML.  It took me a short period of time using Wrox's Beginning PHP 4.  I recommend this book and the friends I've lent it to have the same rave reviews as I do (in fact I'm having trouble retrieving it from the friend who has it now because he loves it so much). It won't teach a lot on object oriented programming, but is a great intro to such elementary topics as variables, looping, file manipulation and database connectivity.

PHP would be an excellent choice.  I use it for my own personal projects
and my company uses it extensively on our Intranet and external websites. 
The great thing about PHP is that it's fairly easy to learn.  We have a
helpdesk guy at work that had never done any programming before, but he
picked up PHP very quickly and now is contributing to some of our
projects.

I know you didn't make an open call for suggestions, but I think you'd be

Programming purists would have a cow over the idea. It isn't strongly
typed, it isn't OO, etc. They would probably recommend something like Java,
Objective C, or <insert your favorite LISP variant here>.

On the good side, it's a lot better than the HP or Microsoft BASIC many of
us cut our teeth on. It's easy to get started. They can learn the theory
after they've been hooked.

Does she want to learn how to program or learn how to program correctly.

PHP will not teach proper structure for writing good programs.  (Due to 
the stateless nature of HTTP.)

It may give her more imediate gratification, but be more harmful in the 
long run if those bad habits become ingrained.

c or Java or something more vaguely procedural would be better.

If she really wants to learn programming, teach her assembly language.

There is the issue of not only trying to learn to program they are also
probably having to learn HTML.  The reason I dislike VisualBASIC (which
the local college uses) so much in a teaching atmosphere.  How do you
teach the basic concepts of programming when you're fighting the GUI.  
(If you ever look at VB you'll notice it doesn't even follow the Windows
standard layout/behavior.)

<soapbox>
Go for the command line stuff first.  Maybe not as cute as a graphical
presentation but the student can concentrate on programming first then
play with the presentation later.  And my personal favorite is Perl.  
This is based on learning using BASIC, followed by FORTRAN, back to BASIC,
C, (god forbid but I started understand some old COBOL code I was
debugging), C++, Perl, Tcl, Perl, shell (bash), Perl.  And did I mention
Perl?  :-)  Then one day I was encouraged (required) to teach VisualBASIC.  
I spent more time in the class room trying to get the code window 
reopened on students computers then getting them to enter code.

Oh yeah I forgot about doing LISP, XLISP, and AutoLISP when I sent out my 
own suggestions.  Could be a good choice but does have a steeper 
conceptual ramp-up than the other traditionbal languages.

Hey Eric,
Have you thought about starting with some simple (and up) shell or Perl 
scripting just to see if programming would stick to them? It would likely 
save you some time and money if it turned out to not be what they thought it 
was.

Just a suggestion.

Ayup.  And it's also very likely going to have a *huge* book release
party by a local famous writer, but I dare not say who, because my
publisher won't let me pre-announce things I'm working on.

I am a complete Linux novice but can find my way around a DOS box pretty well.

Can someone suggest a flavor of Linux that will run with GUI on my old P75 machine?  I understand that RH 8 wants a 200 MHz machine.....

How much RAM?  It'll be a tight squeeze if you have less than 64MB... a
very tight squeeze if you're at 32MB, and maybe impossible if you're at
16 or 8MB of RAM (think command line only).

I would suggest trying Slackware with the 3.3.6 X server from the extras
directory.  That will be a little bit difficult to set up, though, if
you are un-familiar with Linux at all.  Google is your friend, though.

Debian, if they still have a 3.3.6 server available, would probably be
almost as fast.

Other than that, perhaps you would have luck with a super-old distro....

But, FWIW, there are a ton more command-line apps for Linux that are so
much more powerful than you get with DOS.  As a former DOS power user
myself, I was shocked at how powerful bash was by itself.  :-)

You are not going to find many implementations of Linux that will run a 
GUI well on a P75. Depends on how much memory you have and what kind of 
video card.

EvilWM or FVWM might run on something that slow.  (As long as you avoid 
Gnome and KDE apps.)  

A machine like that will work well as a mil server or something that does 
not need a GUI, but not very well for anything GUI related.

  Whoa! I've been running Red Hat 6.2 on my Toshiba Portege with 32M RAM --
including the X Window System. A couple of years ago I upgraded the memory
to its maximum: 96M. Still runs just fine both at the console and with X.

  Of course, I don't run either KDE or Gnome. Xfce has always been
lightweight and does all I've asked of it. <http://www.xfce.org/>

  I just ordered Slackware-8.1 for the notebook; perhaps the
servers/workstations later. I'll still be running xfce. A lot depends on
what end-user apps you're running, too.

  On the notebook I've run WordPerfect-8, but do most of my writing with
emacs (in X and on the console) and joe. I've run the XessSE spreadsheet,
the GIMP and some other apps on it -- including GRASS. And these all ran
just fine in 64M of RAM.

  FWIW, the Toshiba Libretto I had ran RH and X in 32M RAM.

I see whatcha mean. Short of writing your own C routine, I don't see how it
can be done, either. And the docs aren't much help...

    For more information on menus, see ???.

It looks like SuSE says Pentium or better and 64MB for installation in 
graphical mode. They make no mention of a processor speed requirement nor is 
there a claim that KDE is going to run (they just mention the YAST2 
installation). Here's the link:

I'm not sure Pascal is even taught anymore in any college course. Pascal 
was the second programming language I learned after cutting my teeth on 
BASIC. As I recall I saw the computer science department at the college 
I attended dropped their Pascal course offerings in favor of C. I felt 
this was a mistake as I had the "horror" of maintaining C code from 
someone that had only learned BASIC. 

I still remember the pain of one program that my supervisor wrote at my 
first programming job. He wrote a program that among other programming 
horrors contained a huge set of if/else if statements that spanned 54 
pages of green bar paper. My supervisor managed to accidently delete a 
curly brace in the wrong place. The C compiler was easily confused in 
those days and couldn't report the actual line number the syntax error 
occurred on.

My supervisor soon tired of his task to try to fix this problem so he 
gave up and assigned the problem to me. I used our company's huge 
conference room and laid the print out on the floor over an area of 
20-30 feet. I went through the printout with a red felt pen drawing 
brackets to show where the curly brackets matched. In the end I found 
where a curly bracket had been accidently removed and so I added it 
back and all was well.

I never saw anyone that had learned to program in Pascal first write 
this sort of crap code but it seemed to be common with some C 
programmers that came from a BASIC-only background. Again this was many 
years ago when most programmers didn't even know what the C programming 
language was since COBOL, BASIC and/or Pascal were probably the most 
commonly used high-level programming languages at the time.

Well, not sure about it now.. but when I lived down in the bayarea (before
moving here...) my first programming course in college was Pascal...
(1999... which wasn't that long ago)
Structured Program with Pascal (i think was our course book)
The next class in the CIS courses would have been C...then C++ i believe.,
etc..

looking online... here.
actually..they STILL teach pascal there.
http://www.missioncollege.org/catalog/cis.pdf

I still have my tpascal disks that a friend gave me... ran in dos.

There are pascal compilers for linux, correct? I wonder if any of my old
can be risen from the dead.

..ok enough of the memories...

If you use devfs, pressing the sync button will create the devices in /dev/...

The documentation actually covers this, but it can be missed pretty easily..

Eric,
I've tried to experiment with PHP for web applications, and to me it looks 
like stripped down and bastardized Perl. 
So far, I found Perl more superior to PHP. 
It's easy to learn and very powerful in almost every aspect language.
Especially, if you're writing Web applications using Perl CGI.pm module 
and run them in FCGI mode on Apache. 
The performance and speed of such approach blows away all these
Java scripts, ASP's,SSI's and PHP altogether.

Here are the links for your reference on the performance of Perl in FCGI mode:

Hi,

I've been working on a project to convert some reports that are usually 
generated in HTML into Latex so we can make nice printable reports. I've got 
a pretty nice system in place for doing so, and the Latex/PDF reports look 
very much the same as their HTML counterparts. The one place they really 
differ though is in the headings. Our HTML column headings often get turned 
into multi-line headings to reduce horizontal space. Unfortunately I have not 
been able to figure out how to get Latex to willingly make a column narrower 
by stacking the words in a column heading. For example I'd like something 
that looks like this...

My Wide Heading

to become

My
Wide
Heading

Any suggestions?
Thanks.

Easier to learn is a relative term.  I'm working on learning Perl and I
find PHP much easier to learn.

I think this happens when people learn programming in
isolation, without spending much time reading other programs
or having other people read their programs.  they end up
with the delusion that programming is about telling the
computer what to do.

programming is about telling other people what you want the
computer to do.  if you get that right, I don't think the
language you start with matters that much.

I found a partial solution, in case anyone is interesting.  Apparently
it's an issue with firewire.  I have firewire pci card sitting in my
computer for use with my Windows Partition (unfortunately, I cannot get
it to work with Linux).  Any the fix is:

Add the following to line 67 of /usr/share/hwbrowser/DeviceList.py :

kudzu.CLASS_FIREWIRE : _("Firewire"),

The fix was found at 

http://www.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=74956

I'm still getting many errors related to the gnome-canvas-path-def.c
file, but at least the hardware browser works.

I have two questions on 2 different subjects. I've found out why my

route -n. The damn firewall will NOT go below High no matter how I try
to set it lower using redhat config and the GUI supplied in the distro.

In PHP it's easy to learn how to do quick and dirty stuff e.g Personal Home 
Page.
While Perl is still easier than C/C++, it teaches you how to program 
correctly.

Greetings...

Does anybody here have any old 200Mhz+ systems lying around collecting 
dust? I'm looking for two computers so I can set up a DMZ for my 
family's home network. Unfortunately I'm currently unemployed and the 
outlook isn't very good. Thanks in advance.

There's a dosutils and directory on the RH CD. In there is a utility called 
rawrite, you can use it to make the bootable floppy from in Win, or use dd to 
make a flopy from a file in the images directory, there are several options, boot 
is the one I usually use, but there's a PCMCIA version, too.

This is all from memory, so I could have details wrong.

Is PHP really a programming language, I mean I hear it's good for web
apps, but what about stand alon projects? ;-)

OK, I'll throw my favorite programming language in the mix (why not?
everybody else is doing it :) - I've programmed in C/C++, Java, Perl, some
Tcl (yuk!) I even tried out Python one afternoon but didn't like that
indentation was part of syntax...  but my favorite for the last couple of
years is Ruby.

The best way to quickly describe Ruby is that it's SmallTalk meets Perl.
The syntax is clean and expressive and the object oriented features in
addition to things like iterators are very consistently used in all of the
standard libraries.

Give it a look:
http://www.ruby-lang.org
You can find the book "Programming Ruby" online, free at:
http://rubycentral.com

The RH8 gui firewall utility uses iptables, edit iptables directly and you 
should be fine. 

On older red hats the gui firewall tool configured ipchains, which led to some 
rude surprises and confusion when you set up iptables. Those 'dangit, I know 
I did it right, what the heck is wrong!' moments, only in more colorful 
language. Then the d'oh moment, remembering lokkit uses ipchains, which was 
gumming up the works. Life on the edge....

PHP is clearly a hypertext processor but the stats look like it's considerably 
more usefull ( http://www.php.net/usage.php ) than "Personal Home Page".

I agree, Perl is a really good choice to promote the learning of good 
programming habits. The transition from Perl to C/C++ is going to be a 
challenge though. It takes a little more than good habits to get some folks 
beyond the proper use of pointers.

What Carla said. And as root:

# service iptables stop

should stop the firewall. If you want to keep it off long-term:

# chkconfig --del iptables

If it helps here are a couple of links for Pascal compilers that you 
might find useful:

http://www.freepascal.org/
http://www.gnu.org/directory/GNU/GNUPascal.html

I've got quite a bit of old Pascal code from my college and early 
professional programmer days and I'm sort of curious how well the free 
compilers work. I may give one or both of these compilers a try under 
Linux.

PHP won't "teach" proper structure because it isn't a bondage and
discipline language, rather than because it's used for stateless web
stuff.  B&D languages don't teach it either, they force it down your
throat.  Also, PHP has applications outside of the web, I use PHP for
quite a bit of general scripting in addition to web applications.

I found that PHP was easy to learn, but then I know a fair number of
languages already.

But I do think PHP would be an excellent language to get somebody "into"
programming, it's a pretty tactile experience to type something in an
editor and then hit reload in your browser and see the changes.

Besides the online documentation, books that I think are good for
beginners are "Core PHP Programming" by Leon Atkinson and "PHP
Developers Cookbook" by Sterling Hughes - neither will take you very
far, but they're handy to get started with.

ummmm... no.  Perl encourages sloppy programming.  it's far
too irregular and has too much magic behavior.

simple example.  this:

    while (my $line = <IN>) { ... }

does not do the same thing as this:

    sub in { return <IN>; }
    while (my $line = in ()) { ... }

and there's no warning for that.

ummmm...  I guess it would help to read the entire thread (or at least the 
subject line). 

So are you saying is that PHP and other Apache/DHTML environments (perhaps 
Apache::Asp or Cold Fusion) will teach better habits? 

The context of this thread is where to begin teaching introductory programming 
and the question was quite specific. While Perl is not perfect, I do think 
that it promotes teaching better habits than the other languages discussed 
while providing a great segway into some of the more rigid concepts of the C 
family - but hey, it's only one opinion shared by many.

no.  I already said earlier in the thread that I don't think
first language matters much.  I'm fond of Scheme, but I
don't think it will work for everyone.  Smalltalk and Logo
are also fun choices.

one idiotic problem with Perl is it doesn't do function args
like any other language.  it takes at least 3 lines of code
to do what most other languages do in 1.  this _doesn't
matter_.  a problem like this just means you teach someone
the 3 lines instead of the 1, probably with an explanation
of why it's necessary.  though too many digressions like
this may get in the way of learning the meat of programming.

You said:

I think good programming habits have little to do with
language.  good habits are: writing clearly, writing
precisely, and obsessive paranoia.  Perl is a little worse
than average in supporting those, so I'm puzzled why you
consider it "a really good choice".

I mean, simple programming ideas like lexical scoping were
added to Perl late, and there are a couple of ways that
lexical scoping doesn't work in Perl.

big deal.  Perl is ok.  PHP is ok.  if someone's going to
become a serious programmer, they're going to learn general
programming language theory anyway.

FreeGeek just started an intro class on PHP.  It is Tuesday nights from 7 
to 9.  This week was the first class and mostly went over the structure of 
the class.  Next week will be more technical and it will dig deeper and 
deeper into PHP with a project for FreeGeek as it goes.   The class should 
run for six or seven weeks.  It was pretty full this week, but I expect 
that attrition will make things a little better by the time the class gets 
to a lot of hands on stuff.  Drop by FreeGeek (see http://www.freegeek.org 
for the address and more info) or hit the web site for more info.

Best,
Kyle

Well, the first language can certainly matter since it will give the
learner certain impressions about the practice of programming that might
be hard to change later.  Way back in the mid 70's I learned BASIC in
highschool and it probably took me a decade to completely unlearn some of
the bad habits that are just inherant in BASIC.

Also, you don't want a language that gets in your way when you're teaching
non-programmers - it's interesting to note that no one on this thread has
seriously suggested that you should teach C/C++ to new programmers.  C++
is great if it's used in the right places, but I just can't imagine
teaching it to new programmers.

I'm convinced that it's best to  teach object orientation up front to new
programmers, especially young ones.  That said, I'll reiterate my
suggestion of Ruby as a first language.  Why?:

1) Ruby is _very_ consistently object oriented (on par with SmallTalk).
Examples:
  #even numeric literals can accept messages:
  3.times { print " Hey " } #->  Hey Hey Hey

  string = "This is my string"
  string.length #-> 17
  (NOTE: In python to get a string length you have to do:
   length(string)
   which doesn't seem very OO to me.)
2) Ruby has builtin regex facilities on par with Perl.
3) Ruby has sigils, but they are used for indicating scope, not type as in
Perl, so they tend to show up less in Ruby code than they do in Perl code
(readability).
4) Indentation is not a syntactical element as it is in some other P
language.  This can be important because a new programmer probably hasn't
used programming editors before and therefore may not be able to
differentiate between tabs and spaces which can lead to all manner of
frustration when it certainly looks as though their code is indented
correctly, but one line uses a tab and another uses spaces.


[BTW: I do know someone locally who has taught eight-year-olds to program
in Ruby.]

Much as I used to like Perl, I never did like the kludgy way you had to
deal with function args...  I think that's changing in Perl 6 thankfully.

Kind of related to the thread about PHP for new programmers (Hey is
there a language called PHB for managers? :-):

In the book "The Pragmatic Programmer" by Dave Thomas and Andrew Hunt
(good book, BTW) the authors suggest that you learn a new programming
language every year because different languages help you to look at
problems differently.  Now I'm not sure about every year, but I would
suggest that perhaps every other year would be a good schedule; two years
gives you plenty of time to master a language (unless it's C++ in which
case give it about five ;-).  My language of the last two years has been
Ruby and so far it's my favorite; I suspect it will continue to be my
language of choice for many projects where it makes sense, but now I'm
looking to learn OCaml and Objective C.  OCaml because I want learn more
about functional programming and it's also compiles to very fast
executables.  Objective C because I really tend to prefer it's object
model over C++'s (Obj-C is much more dynamic than C++, more decisions are
made at runtime in Obj-C) and Obj-C is the basis for a lot of GUI
programming on MacOSX (and the cocoa framework (basically the same API as
GNUStep) is said to be a joy for creating GUIs).

Anyway, my point is don't get stuck forever in one language 'local
minima'.  As you try more languages you'll find that some are better
suited for some tasks than for others and even if you have to use C/C++,
Java or C# at work you'll find that your acquaintance with several of the
other less commercial languages will enrich your toolbox of knowledge and
actually help you when you're programming in those more commercial
languages as well.

Hmm.  Well, for books there is _The Little Schemer_ (Friedman &

You have to understand that if the first language is either difficult or not 
productive then the student is much more likely to lose interest and quit 
(especially young students). Show them that it's fairly easy to create and be 
productive and they will likely stick it out. Originally I suggested shell or 
Perl scripting because of availability, free documentation, ease of use and 
full of features.

You don't like having all of your parameters flattened into @_  :)  (I share 
that feeling).   And I beg to differ, every Perlmonger that turns to C for 
the first time appreciates the fact that Perl passes parameters badly and 
conforms to the new language with pleasure (in that respect). Now here's a 
challenge:  Find a language that nobody can poke stupid holes in...

Quite simply, experience tells me that learning concepts by example is much 
more powerfull than by idiology and theory. We'll have to agree to disagree 
when it comes your theories of good (code) writing habits - I'm really 
puzzled why you would think that someone with no knowlege of the language 
could write code precisely and clearly (I liken that to me speaking fluent 
Japaneese without studying that lanquage).

The is true, but subject to opinion that some don't share, I happen to agree 
with that statement. But then again, the common misuse of pointers in C++ 
caused them to be eliminated in Java - some would say it was the 
implementation of pointers in C++ that promoted said pointer to be commonly 
misused.

I can't agree with that statement more.  Every language has it's pros and 
cons, there nothing but tools. So when introducing someone to programming it 
could be said that the language needs to be one that the student finds 
facinating.

We have a server that's a mail secondary.  The primary went down and mail is 
flooding to the secondary.  The machine has at any given moment ~325 to 380 open
or half open TCP connections.  


[root at cmcservant net]# cat ip_conntrack  | wc -l ;  cat ip_conntrack  | grep 10.10.10.25 | grep dport=25 | wc -l
    365

[root at cmcservant net]# cat ip_conntrack  | wc -l ;  cat ip_conntrack  | grep 10.10.10.25 | grep dport=25 | wc -l
    389
    107
[root at cmcservant net]#

10.10.10.25 is the internal mail server that's down.

Now, should my linux box be able to function well with this many open connections?  Is there a way to increase
the number that it can keep open while we fix the problem on the primary mail server?

Yes, the primary is Exchange, yes, we have a linux based secondary to ensure that mail can be delivered.

As far as I know your box should be able to do fine with that many connections opened (provided it's beefy enough).  I believe that there are 65,536 ports available.  The ports < 1024 being privileged ports.  If your secondary is a p100 with 32 MB RAM, then you might have problems keeping a large number of ports open, but on a PIII or so with a couple hundred megs of RAM, I think you should be fine.

I don't have an answer to your question, but as a suggestion to further
keep Exchange away from the public 'net, you should setup your Linux mail
server as a relay for Exchange.  So mail comes into the Linux (Postfix,
right?) server and then is forwarded onto Exchange on the inside network. 
If the Exchange box is down, then Postfix would hang on to the incoming
mail until Exchange became available again.  You could also setup webmail
(using Squirrelmail or IMP) for traveling employees on the Postfix box
which would make an IMAP connection to the Exchange server on the inside. 
This way you block the outside from ever directly touching Exchange.

big deal.  everyone in this thread has been talking about

sure, whatever.  I suspect object-oriented programming is a
passing fad, but it'll last as long as, oh, Fortran.  after
all, you can do object-oriented programming in Fortran now.

I ran SuSE 6.3 for many years on a P75 with 32MB ram.  FVWM or AfterStep
were acceptable as windowmanagers; KDE was painfully slow.  Mozilla was
painfully slow, but functional.  StarOffice was glacial.

I've still got the CD's - you can have them if you're interested.

I have heard that about OO languages and structured languages and every 
other programming fad that comes along.

C is still the primary language used in Unix and the rest of the

Fortran has good points and bad points.  It is not a good language to 
teach object oriented code to the young however.  (Besides, I think you 
can get jail time for that in some juristictions.)

Object oriented methods are a tool to be used to solve a specific class of 
problems.  They are not the end-all and be-all of programming, no matter 
what the proponents of OOP claim.  For some problems, it adds a level of 
obfuscation that makes debugging next to impossible.

Best to start out teaching kids a language that requires them to be able 
to solve the problem clearly and cleanly.  They need to learn the problem 
solving skills first or else they spend the rest of their lives writing 
code that the rest of us have to fix.

Style is important. Clarity is important.  These are skills that are not 
stressed by most programming books and/or teachers.

I have a few versions that go back even farther.

The big problem with SuSE is that it tends to like to install a LOT of 
software unless you trim it back.  (With SuSE, the number of the box is 
how many gigs it wants, not a version number.)

Another option would be SlackWare.  Just make sure to stick with the 
smaller windowmanagers and it should work out fairly well. 

It is going to be pretty slow no matter what you do however...

That's a different concept. The fact that there are 65,536 ports does
not have anything to do with how many connections can be supported
and how many buffers there are to accept incoming packets.

I won't debate the suitability of perl as a teaching language; its
ability to let people write idiosyncratic and baffling code is well known
- personally I'd recommend something a little more structured.

But I think you're wrong - the two examples above do the exact same thing.
You can't stick them together in a row like this, because you've read from
an input stream in the first, and you have to close and reopen the stream
before you can read from it again.  (Not an uncommon occurrance in many
languages, I believe.)  If I stick your two examples into separate
scripts, they produce identical results; I just tried it.

Again, I'm not defending perl as a learning language, just defending its
honor in general here.

I think the column description you want is 'p' (instead of 'l', 'r', or 
'c').  It creates the column element as a parbox of a width specified as 
an argument.  The parbox implies that the contacts will be wrapped.  I 
don't have my LaTeX referenece in front of me right now, so I can't give 
you the exact syntax.  If you want this different than the other rows, 
you can of course put in in a \multicolumn to change the format 
specification for that row.

yes, which is why PHP is fine.  generating web pages is
interesting.  Perl doesn't do anything terribly interesting
until you have a lot of Perl, unless you like doing sysadmin.

I didn't say you could write clearly and precisely without
knowledge of a language.  knowledge of the language is a
prerequisite, and that's why Perl is less than ideal.  it's
_hard_ to know Perl.  there are too many complex
interactions between its various parts.

most computer languages are not very complicated and not
very different, it's not that hard to learn a new one.  it's
not like learning Japanese.  if I had to use an unfamiliar
language like Ruby, I'd sit down with the reference manual,
spend a day reading it, another day reading other people's
programs, and that's probably enough for me to start writing
reasonable Ruby programs.

Perl is a lot harder than that.  it takes a long time to
read its manual and learn how all its parts interact.  Perl
tricks you into thinking there's an easy learning curve,
that you can just learn a little of it at a time, but that's
not really true.

$ python2
Python 2.2 (#1, Apr 12 2002, 15:29:57)

IIRC, 'length()' is an operator in Python, not a function--the
obj.__len__() is the way Python implements operator overloading.  So it
really is OO, even if it doesn't look like it.

Before I learned Python, I thought that was a problem too--but have only
rarely had it be an issue.  I think the only time funny things happened
was when I got my hands one a source file with DOS linebreaks (or maybe
it was an X cut & paste gone awry).

nope.  the first loop will stop when IN hits eof or error.
the second loop can stop before that.  discovering the place
this is explained in the perl man pages is left as an
exercise to the reader.

> If I stick your two examples into separate
> scripts, they produce identical results; I just tried it.

right.  this is sloppy programming practice.  "identical
results in one case" is not the same as "identical results
in all possible cases".  you're unlikely to find the
difference between those two loops from random testing.  the
inadequacy of testing is one reason so many programs have
weird bugs and security holes.

Nobody doubts that PHP is fine, it's just focused on web stuff. As I said 
originally, I am not a PHP guru but I am by no means being critical of that 
product - nor of those that put it to work. It's fairly obvious that it has 
many followers and that it is quite capable (I thought I made my view on that 
subject abundantly clear in previous posts).

Take a look at mod_perl and get an overview. In fact, the plug site runs on 
mason (which is a perl module). BTW - both products are Apach projects.

I don't find perl any more difficult than bash, bourne or korn. It is, 
however, tons easier than a lot of languages.

To a 10 year old it might be, and that was the original question.

It took me roughly 3 weeks to come up to speed. Granted, I am no beginner but 
the concepts that Perl preaches is, like most scripting languages, not rocket 
science.

Now before this gets too much further out of hand, let's get back to reality. 
I only made a suggestion that I know, again from experience, works well. I 
don't want it to seem like I'm a hard core - nothing else will do - 
perlmonger. I don't wear those boots and I don't maintain any sort of major 
loyalty to perl or any other technologies, I reserve that loyalty for my 
family and friends. In my opinion it is not wrong to teach beginners perl, 
PHP, Ruby or any other host of languages - they're all fun and interesting to 
those of us that like that sort of thing.

OK.  Not to get too much into language wars ;-) but Ruby has _real_
operator overloading:

class Foo

  def +(other)
    #do whatever you need to do to add foo's together
  end

  def [](index)
    #do whatever you need to do to index into your foo
  end

  def []=(index,value)
    #assign some foo index a value
  end

end

....not a complete example, of course...
I find Python's __operatorname__ way of doing operator overloading
annoying.

Yes, lots of Pythonisas say this.  For me I found it caused trouble from
the first Python program I tried to type in.  I played with Python for
about three hours and then decided it wasn't for me mostly based on
this indentation as syntax thing (but also, it seemed odd to have to
pass in self everywhere to your instance methods, at least in their
definitions, and all those __xyz__ method names)...  I think the
Python/Ruby choice is one of taste - they
both have a lot of similar features.  I also tend to  find that if you're
coming from Perl you'll probably prefer Ruby.

Aside from using a different naming convention, what does this do that
Python can't?

I've come to like the whitespace syntax thing.  It really saves the
wrists and vision.  The only think I miss is being able to flash to the
opening brace with '%' in vi.

The quick overview of Ruby:

It was developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto in Japan in the mid-90's.  He liked
a lot of Perl's power (regexen, string manipulation, arrays, hashes, etc)
but he wanted something much more object oriented (on par with SmallTalk).
He didn't find Python to be object oriented enough to suit his tastes so
he developed his own language: Ruby.  In developing Ruby he borrowed
a lot of ideas from Perl, Lisp and  SmallTalk.

*Ruby is a dynamically typed language (but 'type' is primarily determined
by what messages an object can respond to).
*Ruby's object model is single inheritance with mixins
  - you can mixin modules of methods into a class (thus adding both
    interface and implementation, unlike Java which only allows you to
    add interface and you add the implementation seperately)
  - you avoid the trouble with multiple inheritance but can get
    implementation and interface from multiple mixins.
*Ruby is extremely dynamic:
  - classes are always open, so you can add methods to them at runtime
(for example)
  - there really isn't much difference between runtime and compiletime
    which allows you to do things like conditional inheritance or
    conditional mixins (and lots of other cool things).
  - you can add methods to individual objects (singleton methods)

Here's a Ruby intro article I wrote for Freshmeat about a year ago:
 http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/358/

Here's a good article on Ruby in Software Development magazine:
http://www.sdmagazine.com/documents/s=7726/sdm0212d/sdm0212d.htm

Also:

http://www.ruby-lang.org  -  Ruby's home
http://www.rubycentral.com - online "Programming Ruby" book available here

...that should get you started.
Have fun.

stuff like how and when to write comments, spacing and
formatting guidelines, methods for naming variables and
functions, programming idioms to use or avoid, etc.  do a
Google search of "programming style".  there are lots of
different style guides.  consistency is more important than
quibbling over details.  the purpose is to encourage
code that's easy to read and maintain.

No wars intended... I just prefer:

def -(other)
  #do subtraction
end

to:
def __sub__(self,other):
  #do subtraction

...less typing, even with the 'end' ;-)

Each socket connection on a port requires the use of a file descriptor  
so realistically you won't be able to have all 64K ports in use at any 
one time. The maximum number of ports available on a system is going to 
be based on how large the file descriptor table is on a given system.  

Also depending on what sort of processes are being run, you also have to 
contend with the fact that many programs take up 3 file descriptors by 
default...One each for stdin, stdout, and stderr. The number of file 
descriptors in use by a given process will go up further if the process 
opens other files, sockets, or any other resources that consumes file 
descriptors.

I agree, incidentally. I mean, I think a good backing in a C or C++ is
good for providing solid fundamentals, but it's infinitely more useful and
interesting to be able to actually get things done. And with PHP/HTML,
etc. you can actually start manipulating input, creating buttons, etc.
whereas the most you can do in C and C++ is read user input from the
stdin, manipulate it, and spit something out. This is useful in its own
right, but not terribly interesting.

I don't necessarily disagree with anything that has previously been
said.  However, if any of your young programmers have aspirations to
be a hardware designer, they might be better off learning C or even
assembly (preferably not x86).  The advantage of C is that it is relatively
easy to predict what instructions will generated by the compiler, which
makes controlling hardware a little easier.

The ideal situation would be a single
board computer with lots of interesting I/O (LEDs, switches, audio, etc.),
combined with the appropriate cross tools.  This would require a fair
amount of hand holding at the beginning, but I can't think of a better
way to really get to know hardware, short of designing and building
it yourself.

I completely agree with Galen. Assembler was my first
language and I learned it for every platform I touched
in the early years: 8008, 8080, Z80, RCA1802, SC/MP,
TI9900, 6502, 6800, 6809, PDP11, etc. It gave me an
understanding of computers that I would not now have
otherwise.

I'm thinking about getting a broadband connection to the internet
and am looking for advice.

I'm thinking along the lines of a hub/firewall in the basement,
with cables running up to the first and second floors.

I'm not too thrilled with either ATT or Qwest, but they seem to be
the only games in town.  But I'm really apprehensive about the
wiring.  I live in a 1920's wood-frame house, with gobs of windows 
and blown-in insulation.

Any suggestions?

Have you considered going wireless instead of running cat5 all over 
the place? True, it's not as speed as wired Ethernet, and attention 
definitely needs to be paid to security, but 802.11 is not terribly 
expensive these days.

Tricks I've found:

For getting to the second floor, check the space around the plumbing stack
and then come down from the attic.

For putting a jack on a 2nd floor external wall where there is a window,
firebreak etc. bring in the wire elsewhere and hide the wire behind the
baseboard to where you want it.

don't run parrelel to power lines.

Wireless.  

Depending on what you want to do, the Acceptable Use Agreement between Cable 
and DSL varies widely.  If you want to download only than cable is right for 
you.  If you want to have more symmetrical bandwidth or servers on the 
Internet at your house than DSL, is probably what you want.

Qwest runs the lines but look at somebody else for the service.  I've used 
Earthlink over pppoe for more than a year and it's been ok.  DSL Northwest, 
Speakeasy, Pacifier are also other solutions.

Try wireless.  I installed a wireless router (DLink 614+) into my 
father-in-law's old house (ground floor) and I could surf anywhere in the 
house (upstairs/downstairs).  There are some pretty good wireless to ethernet 
adapters that would allow you to put your access point in the basement, put 
the wireless access point on the first or second floor and connect that to a 
hub.

I wouldn't know.  I'm still using SuSE 8.0.  Need to get a copy of 8.1,
but I'm not in a hurry.  Might wait for 8.2.

I understand SuSE's position; especially after having tryed to make
a commercial distribution for MicroSharp called Netule.  I truely wanted
to totally Open Source everything, but they were reluctant for very
good reasons.  The biggest problem we had was that we were spending
significant resources building a good distribution (actually 3 special
purpose distributions), but weren't in a good position to make money
on auxilary goods and services.  This made it very difficult.

I would actually like to try doing another speciality distribution, but
this time I would Open Source it completely from day one and combine
it with a book so one could get it into book stores.  Altho one
wouldn't get rich doing this, it might get the distribution enough
attention that one could use it to sell installation and other services
from the distros web site.

It's really not hard to pull wire through walls, even with blown in
insulation.  Here's a list of materials:

----------------------------------------------------------------

1 box Cat 5 (may want to put in 5e for future 1000BaseT networking)

1 wire tape (also called a snake, but not a plumbing snake)

1 stout drill

1 drill bit large enough to accomodate the head of the snake, which
  is bigger than the Cat 5.

Several plastic remodeling/rework boxes.  These are standard plastic
electrical boxes with little tabs that turn out in order to lock
the box into place.  It's worth the cost to get the deep ones if
your walls are deep enough to accomodate them.

Networking wall jacks.  Home Depot sells some great modular ones
that you can mix with phone jacks, cable jacks, etc.

1 helper to be on the other end of the wire tape.

Tools to cut holes in walls and do patch work.

Measuring tape.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Home Depot has some great self-published how-to books on how to do
wiring when remodeling as well as techniques on how to avoid cutting
large holes to accomodate the drill.  Using channel hardware (which is
a plastic cover for wire exposed on a wall) could be a great time
saver, but keep it to unobtrusive corners if you're into decorating.

You can save a lot of work through careful planning.  For example, if
you can do your routing through interior walls, you can avoid the
insulation altogether.  I've also heard of people who route wire
through duct work, but if I remember right, that's against electrical
code unless you use a higher grade of wire (more insulation due to
heat/vibration).  Of course, you're doing it yourself so that may only
be a problem during an inspection (for example, if you decide to sell
your house someday).

You may also want to think about alternative network solutions.

1) Power-line networking.  This is expensive (last check 3 months
ago) but it's massively convenient.  You may have problems with
older wiring and fuse boxes (people who use a lot of X10 home
automation have a lot of experience with this.)  Depending
on how your house is wired into the main on the street, you
may also share your networking connection with your neighbors,
which could be good or bad :)

2) Wireless.  802.11b stuff is getting dirt cheap.  A few
months ago Frye's had 802.11b cards for $20 each after rebate,
but most people think with an 802.11b card you get what you
pay for, so do be careful.  You may end up sharing your
network with your neighbors as well.

3) Phone-line networking.  Not many people I know use it, or think
highly of it.  But it is available as an option.

Good luck!
Colin

Jeff,

    Have you heard from anyone?
I think Ed Sawacki (www.alcpress.com) is doing this.
I have given seminars on Linux in the passed and have been thinking
about starting to do this again as I need to do more paid work than
I am at the moment.

  I'm in Verizon country, not Qwest (although a neighbor, around the corner,
works for them as an installer/repairman). Anyway, Verizon carries the ADSL
line from the outside wall of the house to Aracnet/SpiritOne in Beaverton.
The line was lit on 1 June 1999 and I am completely satisfied with the
services provided by GTE/Verizon and Aracnet/SpiritOne.

  There have been problems with the line and "modem", but not for over a
year now. I guess all the settling's done so it's nice and stable. The
service with both has been outstanding and prompt.

  Because I don't watch TV I don't have cable coming in the house. I could,
but I much prefer to stay with the TelCo to my ISP. If I was in your
situation I'd run cat 5 cable up through the walls. If you don't want to do
it all yourself I can recommend a fellow based in Gresham who's done all the
internal telephone wiring I've not been able to do myself. Your windows and
blown-in insulation won't deter a competent cable runner.

HTH,

  ... and a tool to put the RJ-45 plugs on the ends of the cable. I have one
of these. Handy little thing even though it's not much used.

Colin's right.  But it's even easier if you just tear down all the walls. 
Convince yourself that the plaster is falling apart and looks terrible, get 
estimates from plaster contractors, then do it yourself using drywall.

Good time to update the electrical, too...

That said, having done the above myself, we tend to use wireless more than 
the wall jacks.  But it is nice to know that I could someday move my desktop 
out of the basement.

Plus if we ever made the right kind of friends, we could have whole-house 
lan parties.

Yup.  I forgot to mention that installing outlet boxes in plaster is 
trickier than drywall.

You'd need to be very careful when cutting the hole not to snag the lath 
which will break the plaster keys along the wall.

Repairing plaster is difficult.  DAMHIKT.

I find this whole 'web centric' approach a bit amusing... I mean most GUI
apps are still developed in C/C++.  Yeah a lot of web apps are developed
in Java now and apparently PHP is the web programming language de jour,
but most desktop applications are written in C/C++.

However, I wouldn't recommend teaching C/C++ to kids, but not because you
can't do anything 'terribly interesting' in those languages.... I suspect
that the GUI you typed that in was written in C or C++ ;-)

Of course. Why is that amusing, though? I don't think anyone is saying that web-apps are superior. They're just superior in certain situations. They're superior when you don't want to have to distribute an installer. They're superior when you want something relatively cross-platform. And in the case of teaching kids, they could be seen as superior because you can show them tangible exciting results without having to learn a complicated GUI toolkit. Seems reasonable to me.

I guess what I found amusing was the suggestion that you couldn't do
anything 'interesting' in C/C++... Where 'interesting' was defined as
being able to create clickable buttons, menus, etc.  The implication being
that you could only do these things with web apps - or maybe it would be
better to say 'apps that run inside of a browser'.  True, the web browser
is just another platform and (for the most part) it's a uniform platform
that runs on other platforms (but I've heard the horror stories about web
apps that run fine under Mozilla, Konqueror and Galeon, but do not work
under IE).

Most of the major scripting languages allow you to develop GUI apps which
work cross-platform so they can offer the same advantages as web-apps.

BTW: Given that the browser is just another platform, you could even use
C/C++ to develop web apps given the right libraries (not that I'm
advocating that :).

BTW2: Mozilla is becoming a platform in it's own right which you can
configure using XUL (XML based, so it's not really a programming
language) - it'll be interesting to see how many apps come out
using Mozilla as the GUI.

I don't think the contention was that nothing interesting could be done with C/C++. The contention was that it would be quicker and easier to get to the point of doing interesting GUI things with a web application. This is true. That doesn't mean PHP is better or more interesting than C/C++, it just means that you can put together a web app in a matter of minutes, whereas it's a little more difficult to do GUI work (especially for kids) using standard compiled languages.

Interesting, but for learning purposes probably not terribly practical. I think the big advantage of PHP is that it has a C-Like syntax. So PHP as a first language would be awesome, not only because you get to see results immediately, but you get to learn syntax that will translate roughly to many other languages such as JavaScript, C, C++, Java, etc. (please note that by syntax I mean how it treats whitespace, math, ++, semi-colons, superficial things that a kid learning a language would be able to easily translate to another language).

The only downfall I can see, personally, is that it's not typed. Maybe non-typed languages are the wave of the future, but I somehow doubt it.

A lot of focus on the best language but what about debugging.  I nice
IDE goes a long way towards making a language usable for learning.  Ease
of debugging can make or break ones willingness to learn a language.

I've been having trouble finding a good open source debugger for PHP. 
What does everyone do to debug PHP code, put in lots of print type
statements?

As for perl I havn't seen much in the way of IDE's either.

Being able to set breakpoints, single step and check variables
interactively can be the quickest way to learn what your code is doing. 
Nothing like the ease of learning in an integrated edit, compile, go
environment.

I'd be interested to see this discussion focus more on debuggers and
development environment, and less on the languages, not that the
language itself is not important.

Sounds like a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop).  Lisp rocks.

Wow, the original thread has really gone astray. The intent was to look at 
what a good introductory language to teach a 10 year old would be. That's why 
you haven't heard anything about the C family, teaching concepts like 
malloc(), polymorphism, inheiritance, operator overloading, C style pointers 
and the likes is probably not appropriate for most 10 yo's (they work for me 
though, I love that stuff). I don't think anyone that's been contributing 
intended to imply that nothing interesting could be done in C, after all - 
without C we would not have *nix workstations and servers: How interesting 
would that be? The discussion was on what would get the interest of a beginer 
and provide a good introductory path to programming, and the web/script stuff 
certainly fits that bill (not to say that C would be out in all cases but a 
10 year old that could hook into C and stick with it's probably rare).

This is an excellent point.  I remember that my intuitive
understanding of what my programs were doing -- and my confidence that
the computer was doing what I told it to -- went up quite a bit when I
started using source-level debugging.

So: what are good OpenSource source-level debuggers?  I've used gdb in
emacs for years, but only happily with C.  With perl and with java it
sometimes works, sometimes doesn't.  And I'm not sure I want to throw
the complexity of emacs into a 10-year-old's life.  Are there "free"
VC++ act-alikes available for Linux for any of the languages we're
discussing?

Fascinating discussion, BTW.  Thanks for all the ideas!

If you're going to use keystones, the tool should come with the
keystones, if you get the right ones.... in which case it is just a
dinky piece of plastic to push the wires down ... or let your thumb-nail
grow for two weeks and you're good to go.  Alternatively, I also have
one of 'dem little thingies.

If you're going to have cable running out of a hole in your wall, then
you want a crimper, but I wouldn't suggest doing that... outlets look *a
lot* nicer.  The RJ-45 outlets in this house (about 15 of them) look
like regular phone jacks, just a little bigger.

I must have had just shoddy luck with wireless or something.  A friend
and I set up a wireless network for a not-to-be-named small business
near Salem (they were *crap* to work for and had some *moron-run*
software company selling them really overpriced and buggy software)...
we could barely get range through a half inch of plywood.

Sight to sight and we were good to go - but introduce any walls (these
were not insulated and most were cheapo wood - we're talking a renovated
barn, more or less) and the signal went to hell in a handbasket.

In a related incident, the same guy needed to link two networks together
over 100 feet of pavement (think accross the parking lot) so got two
wireless access points to act as a bridge.  They dropped all their
packets running through one pane of glass and 100' of air until $100 in
cable and an antenna was purchased....

Is this just a wierd experience or is such stuff common?  I have a
friend interested in wireless networking ... he has a newer house (7
years old) and would be running it through a floor to his wife's
computer in the room roughly right under him.  Do you guys think 802.11b
will be able to cut through a floor?

My experience has been quite favorable. I regularly use my wireless
through 2 to 4 walls (2x4s and drywall) at home. I've _never_ had a
reception problem anywhere in/around my house, though I've probably
never bothered to go more than 50 ft from the access point. I've got
an SMC access point/NAT box, an Orinoco PCMCIA card, and a mini-PCI
Orinoco in my laptop.

I've also used wireless kit to bridge over a distance; maybe a mile or
so. This was using more Orinoco gear:
http://www.orinocowireless.com/products/all/orinoco/outdoor/PtoP/index.html

It was spendy (we didn't have to pay for it in this instance), but
worked like a charm. We did have line of sight and were less than a
quarter of it's rated distance, FWIW.</Orinoco Ad>

I'd love to see semi-directional anntenne for access points. Mine is
on the far side of the house, wasting db out the window towards the
neighbors. I guess I should just tinfoil that side of the house. And
make a hat while I'm at it.
