Keith,

   How about a variant that turns off the "WHEEL ... OF ... FORTUNE!!!" and other
annoying electronic noise from the slot machines all over the Reno airport's
terminals?

It must be noted that the polling operation is typically broadcast traffic that
will not cross routed boundaries, unless you are using WINS or DNS in some sort
of MS Domain setup.  

If you see random Unicast traffic using Netbios (135) or CIFs (445), it's most
likely the clap or someone running portscans, and it doesn't matter if it's from
China or your ISP's network.

Oog.  Corrupt filesystem metadata, I'll bet, depending on what hde is.
That'd probably be a side-effect of the crashes.

Do the crashes stop when you pull out the PVR card?  If so, and you're
using a kernel/driver combo that other folks say works, I'd guess your
PVR card is defective.

Advertising?  Selling?  That's news to me.  Looks like my "cute" post is
being confused with the marketeering dark arts.  The purpose of the
original posting was to let PLUG know how I've extracted myself from ISP
black holes and other abnormalities, by applying the engineering
principle of minimizing dependencies.  

Early on during the Internet bubble era, I created a niche Internet
application service providing email and Web services to small
businesses.  It ran out of my computer lab and was connected to the
Internet via a T1.  DNS, email, and Web servers were redundant.
Unfortunately, one piece I couldn't engineer around was the devastation
reeked by the cable-seeking backhoe.  The cable cut that killed the
business was when all 24 T1 repeaters between the computer lab and the
telco CO were popped.  It took QWest more than a week to repair the
damage.  My partner and I quickly found new homes for our clients, and
folded the business.

This painful experience left scars.  Never again would my business
depend on a single piece of technology.  Thus, the Holy Troika was born.

When I grep'ed /etc/init.d for "/.autofsck" I got a hit.  But creating the

Red Hat apparently uses "/forcefsck" just like Debian.

Today we have signed an agreement for hardware, software and support
from a new vendor, The SCO Group, Inc. to aid in the development and
growth of the Portland Linux/UNIX Group.  Having recently developed a
bit of bad publicity regarding lawsuits against large Linux vendors,
such as IBM and large Linux users, such as AutoZone, Inc., the SCO Group
is attempting to reach out to Linux users (and potential SCO IP
licensees) by supporting Linux User Groups all over the US.

Arriving early next week will be several new servers, pre-loaded with
SCO UnixWare and many of the various open source applications supported
by the SCO Group, such as Mailman, Apache, Sendmail, Samba, OpenLDAP and
MySQL.  Included will be a few proprietary applications they have asked
us to run, such as 'luser-report', 'IPmon' and 'Big Brother'.

We hope you will be patient with us as we make the transition to these
new platforms; there may be some rocky moments in our service.  We are
very excited about this new opportunity to develop a relationship with
so respected a vendor as the SCO Group; they are likewise excited in the
prospects of improving their name in the community and increasing their
revenues.


























Happy April 1st!

Will we have the SCO-Source(tm) licensing for all of those applications?
Will we be protected from lawsuits stemming from our use of Apache,
Sendmail, etc? I want to be sure that we don't inadvertantly become

I am in the middle of becoming compliant with some new regulations from

"stores, processes, or transmits" cardholder data electronically, I'd 
like to know if any pluggers are dealing with this. Have any of you

Much of these standards are "good practices" but I'm sure that in small

these requirements are up for interpretation and sharing this knowledge

  Wow!  What a great idea!  It's good to see a strong *nix vendor like
SCO supporting the Linux community.

  Will they be offering SCO Source licenses at a reduced cost to PLUG

Subject: [PLUG] DVD-ROM Problem
Message-ID: <97aa5afe050402123070039c5e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I installed a DVD-ROM drive in a system that has a RH9 installation
(kernel 2.4.20-42.9).  Strange thing is, when I try to copy data from
the DVD-ROM drive, I receive errors from /var/log/messages (see end of
message for errors).  After a good long wait, the cp command exits with
a "cp: reading `filename': Input/output error" message.  Sometimes it
copies files and sometimes it doesn't - it's a rather erratic error.

Thinking this was a problem with hardware,  I replaced both the IDE
cable (yes...it is an 80-pin cable...although curiously the Sony DVD-ROM
drive included a 40-pin) and the DVD drive.  Same problem - even changed
to a completely different DVD-ROM manufacturer (it's a Lite-On in there
now...it was a Sony).  I checked BIOS configuration and all seems go there.

The DVDs were created by a State of Oregon department and has large (as in 2-3
GB) files stored on them.  I have no other problems with IDE devices (I
have two hds, and a CD-RW as well in the system...and yes the jumpers
are configured properly).

Please offer suggestions on what else might be at fault.  I have one
other suspicion that I hope someone can confirm.  I'll keep it silent to
not influence responses.

Thanks for your thoughts!

You normally can't just cp files off..
Google 'dvd ripping linux' and you should find lists of tools for ripping. 
If you're going to be reencoding video, you'll find that linux really has 
no good programs for that.

I'm sort of jumping into the middle of a thread here, and I'm not 100%
sure what the exact topic is.  But it sounds like someone wants to rip
DVDs, perhaps?

If you run a debian-based distro, add these to your sources.list file:

# Christian Marillat - dvd::rip is available here
deb ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat stable main
deb ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat testing main
deb ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat unstable main

Then you'll find a package called dvdrip.

Sorry, no - I'm not trying to rip a DVD.  The DVD disc was already

I'm confused now :)

If the DVD files are burned to the DVD (data mode) then you should have no 
problems.

If the DVD is playable in a DVD player, then the previous comment still 
applies :)

Try adding a target="_top" attribute to the form tag. Your PHP must then
return the frameset information.

This approach won't be feasible if you don't know the URL of the content
of the other two frames at the time the user submits the form. If the
target="_top" idea doesn't work, I believe that the behavior is only
possible with some client-side scripting.

AFAIK, those only work with lookout 2000 and earlier... lots of issues with 2003
(Suprise.)  Still worth a shot though.

Subject: [PLUG] Network Configuration / Firewall question
Message-ID: <20050401224202.GA12708@sccrmxc13.comcast.net>

Good afternoon.

Our house network is currently connected to the Internet through a
little netgear "nat firewall" box that also handles the other end of the
wireless connection I use for the laptop. I'd like to replace the
firewall portion of this box with a linux firewall box and do some proxying
and the like.  Is it feasible to keep the DHCP on the little thing, and
let it handle the Wireless? Should I start up the DHCP daemon on the
linux box (which is where I'd like it so it's easier to make little
graphs and charts with regards to bandwidth usage)? Can the little box,
in general, do the wireless connection (and this is the tricky
question), but not the dhcp? Or does it all depend on the little box?

Subject: [PLUG] apache virtual host setups
Message-ID: <3027.216.99.218.67.1112597610.squirrel@sautez.com>

Hello all,

I have read through the apache virtual host directives and have not
been able to get an answer to my questions.  The net answers my
question but not really explains what I should expects but rather just
gives config options.  So, I'm looking for suggestions as to the
following configuration settings and if one is better?  Will not work
(although it appears to work)? Or if it will cause problems in the
future.

According to the apache docs I would do the following:

NameVirtualHost 192.168.0.2
NameVirtualHost 192.168.0.23

<VirtualHost 192.168.0.2>
servername example.com
serverAlias www.example.com
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 192.168.0.23>
servername example88.com
serverAlias www.example88.com
</VirtualHost>


Now I'm going to change my IP address and I could add more
NameVirtualHost IP's and add two IP's in the VirtualHost definition
for a time for the IP's to change.  I know this works.  Now here is
another config style I saw but not defined in the apache docs.  It
appears to work but no answers on rather it is a good idea or is not
supported or just bad practice.

<VirtualHost example.com>
servername example.com
serverAlias www.example.com
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost example88.com>
servername example88.com
serverAlias www.example88.com
</VirtualHost>


With this second one, if I need to change my IP's or want to use the
config file on another machine I just need to modify the Listen and
NameVirtualHost IP's.  Is this a bad way to setup my Virtual Host
sections?  Are their problems with this?

I just see the first one defined in the Apache Docs and saw an example
of the second one being used to explain to someone how to setup an
Apache config file.  I have tested both and they work but since Apache
does not document it I'm concerned about using the latter one which I
would like to use.

Suggestions?

Thanks,

Josh

Josh, I don't agree with your interpretation of the Apache docs. 

Maybe we're not reading the same page?  
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/vhosts/name-based.html

Your first example with the IP addresses in the virutal host directive 
is a method to support older browsers that do not send the required data
for the name-based virtual hosts to work properly.

The, I believe, preferred way of setting up name based virtual hosts is
like:

    NameVirtualHost *

    <VirtualHost *>
    ServerName www.patch.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/patch
    </VirtualHost>

    <VirtualHost *>
    ServerName www.slugvelo.org

    </VirtualHost>

You don't even need to do that.  If you specify 
  Listen 80
Apache will glom onto all bound IP addresses on the server.  You only 
need to specify IP addresses if you want to prevent that from happening.

No IP addresses are needed in the config at all.  They are available for
use if you need them - for instance binding a https server to a particular
address.

If AB is equal to BA in your query then:

@list = qw ( A B C D E );

while ($f = pop @list) {
  foreach $i (@list) {
  	# do something with the pair
    print "$f$i ";
  }
}

# yielding: EA EB EC ED DA DB DC CA CB BA 

If AB does not equal BA for your purposes then a pair of loops works:
foreach $f (@list) {
 foreach $i (@list) {
    # do whatever
	print "$f$i ";
	}
}
# yielding AA AB AC AD AE BA BB BC BD BE CA CB CC CD CE DA DB DC DD DE EA EB EC ED EE 

Of course there's other ways to do it.

Common Lisp:

> (loop for i on '(a b c d e) 
    append (loop for j in (cdr i) 
             collect (cons (car i) j)))
=> ((A . B) (A . C) (A . D) (A . E) (B . C) (B . D) (B . E) (C . D) (C . E)
 (D . E))

By way of explanation, LOOP is an iteration macro in Common Lisp.  The
ON clause iterates over successive tails of the list, e.g. '(a b c d
e), '(b c d e), '(c d e), etc.  The IN clause iterates over the
members of the list.  The CDR function returns the list excluding its
first member.  The CAR function returns the first value in a list.
The APPEND clause in a LOOP aggregates sublists into one big list over
the loop iterations, and the COLLECT clause aggregates values into a
list over the loop iterations.  The result of this expression is a
list of so-called "dotted pairs", which are just a sort of compact
two-element lists constructed with the CONS function.  

If you wanted all three value combinations, you could do this instead:

> (loop for i on '(a b c d e) 
    append (loop for j on (cdr i) 
      append (loop for k in (cdr j) 
        collect (list (car i) (car j) k))))
=> ((A B C) (A B D) (A B E) (A C D) (A C E) (A D E) (B C D) (B C E) (B D E)
 (C D E))

Here I used the LIST function as the final constructor and returned a list
of lists instead of dotted pairs.

Josh:

What you are doing may be too complicated and expensive.  Virtual hosts
mean that many websites can share one IP address.  I have 8 websites on
one IP address, serving pages, wiki, mailing list, webssh,  webcvs, and
authenticated subversion source control.  Fragments of my
/etc/http/conf/httpd.conf file:

    ...
# Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to
# prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses (0.0.0.0)
#
#Listen 12.34.56.78:80

    ...
# Allow server status reports generated by mod_status,

<Location /server-status>
    SetHandler server-status
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
    #Allow from .example.com
    Allow from 127.0.0.1 .kl-ic.com
</Location>
    ...
# Use name-based virtual hosting.
#uncommented June 15, 2004 by KHL
NameVirtualHost *:80
NameVirtualHost *:443
...

</VirtualHost>
#
# another server with a wiki
<VirtualHost *:80>

        ServerAlias www.keithl.com
        DocumentRoot /home/www/keithl.com

        ScriptAlias /wiki/    "/home/www/keithl/cgi-bin/kwiki/index.cgi"
        ScriptAlias /wiki     "/home/www/keithl/cgi-bin/kwiki/index.cgi"
        #

... 

Now, all this is sort of organic - it just grew from a couple of sites -
and there were quite a few false steps along the way.  I'm not putting
all of the conf file on the public mailing list, but I can send you the
whole file if you wish.  I actually have two IP addresses, the second
for Randal's High MX spam trap, but they all feed into this single conf
file and the single *.80 and *.443 ports.  If someone looks at this site
with a Really Old browser, all they will see is kl-ic, but anything after
Mosaic 1.0 should be able to find everything correctly.

I hope that suggests a direction you can take.  Apache is a Really 
Powerful tool, but if you plagarize mightily you can find some formulae
that work.

Robert,

   I've seen this before with bad media.

   Was the disk prepared on a Winduhs box or a linux box? If the former, was
it prepared with Rock Ridge extentions?

   Is the disk mountable/readable on machines other than that which prepared
it? Is the brand one of the higher quality ones?

   I've burned cdrom disks that read consistently on all my linux boxes here
but could not be read on machines running Microsoft, despite having been
prepped with the Joliet and Rock Ridge extentions. A change in brand made a
big difference.

HTH,

Rich

 How is the DVD mounted?
I'm thinking it may be that it is trying to read cdrom format instead of 
reconizing it as a DVD.

Just for the sake of completeness, one has to ask whether it is possible
that the disk was burned with some sort of packet writing software like
DirectCD or something.  Though I've never messed with it, a recent 2.6
kernel has this capability.

Hi

My name is Rich Cowger, I am a new user in need os help.  

I used Windows 98 for  several years and two weeks ago my computer crashed and 
I need to upgrade.  I had already decided I wasn't going back to Microsoft, 
so here I am.  I have a new AMD 2.88 machine w/SUSE 9.2 and a lot of 
questions.  

I have downloaded postgreSQL and I need help getting it installed.  I also 
have Mozilla in a "tar ball" and I am going to need help with it.  

Is there anyone in your  club that has the time to work with me?

   Is there a SuSE package for postgres? If not it's no big deal.

   Any tarball of source follows the same five basic steps:

   1.) Untar the file in the directory in which you want to build it. Some
folks use a directory under ~/, I tend to use /usr/local or /opt. The command
is "tar xzvf <filename>.tat.gz".

   2.) cd to that directory.

   3.) The build needs to be configured to your system. If you want to see
where the binary will be installed and what options are available, use the
--help option after you type:

                                  ./configure

then run it with whatever options you want/need.

   4.) Run
                                     make

   5.) su to root and run
                                 make install

   Use the application.

   Sometimes posts seem like a clubbing, but otherwise we're not a club, just
a lose assorment of ones and zeros who gather periodically to talk and drink
microbrews.

   Third Saturday of most months is the clinic at Riverdale High School. Bring
hardware, software, and questions for hands-on help. Or, just kibbutz.

Fire away with the questions. I don't use SUSE, and I'm not sure what
package management stuff it has. You might consider using a linux
distribution that comes with Mozilla and allows you to install what
you want during the initial setup. (I just opened the door for a major
distro flame war. Oh well.) I prefer Fedora Core distribution. I have
also found Ubuntu linux to be fairly easy to work with, but my
experience with that is more limited. If your heart is set on SUSE,
then stick with it. Just my 2 cents.

I think Rich S did a good job explaining this but I'd like to add one 
thing.  After you untar the package you may find a file called README or 
INSTALL that will give you the steps in building the package and perhaps 
notes on problems with various distributions and how to work around them.

No one else has mentioned it so:

  There's a meeting this Thursday, watch for an annoucement with the details.  You can meet people with time and inclination there.

  The third Saturday of most months features a clinic.  Bring your box to the clinic is get all sorts of help.

SuSE should have a package for Mozilla and/or Firefox.  You may not need to go the tarball route.

I've seen this several times with DVD-Rs that had burn problems.  In
some cases I've been able to read the DVDs using a different physical
drive, in others I couldn't read them with anything.

Welcome to Linux!

> Is there anyone in your  club that has the time to work with me?

You are in for some work - most of it pleasant.  If you don't want
to do any work, there are people you can pay to do it for you:

http://www.possepdx.org

Windows is a Yugo.  Linux is an F-117.  The tape player may not
work, but it will get you around the world.  For now, it needs more
skill to operate, but it outruns bullets.  Expect a different set
of capabilities, and a lot more firepower.  

Windows is "easy to use", like a cardboard suitcase is easy to open.
Linux is a 20 ton Chubb safe.  More secure - if you know how to lock
the door.  We take security VERY seriously, and usability (for us,
and for vandals) suffers.  Life is about tradeoffs.

Windows comes from a box, Linux comes from a community.  Like all
communities, personalities range all over the map, from saints to
assholes - you will encounter both.  For your sanity and ours,
ignore the latter.  Questions about behavior, politics, flames, etc.
belong on the plug-talk list. 

How to get your questions answered?  Be sure to read:

http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

The Linux clinic has been mentioned.  Google is your friend - somebody
else has solved whatever problem you have, and posted the answer somewhere
on the web ( http://www.google.com/linux ).  There are some great books.
For example, the "Linux Cookbook" by Oregon author Carla Schroder.  Buy
it.  Read it.  Read man pages.  Read FAQs.  Read Read Read.

There are a lot more books focused on Fedora/Redhat than on SUSE, but
the Fedora community is newbie unfriendly.  SUSE/Novell provides better
vendor service, IMHO.  Linspire is a joke - like a 20 ton safe with a
cardboard door.  In time, as the need for books and handholding
diminishes, a lot of Linuxers migrate to Debian or Slackware or Ubuntu
or about 200 other distros ( http://www.distrowatch.org ).  The extreme
geeks seem attracted to Gentoo and other "build from a kit" distros,
and then go completely mad, fork, and release their own distros.  All
distros are siblings, though, and interchange pieces easily.  Underneath
all the social maladjustment, we love each other.

Remember, on this list we are NOT here to help strangers, but we are here
to share with our friends.  You are invited to be a friend.

Again, welcome!  We all started where you are at, and soon you will be
answering questions along with us.

Keith

I use Suse 9.0 on one of my systems. Like Fedora and many other 
distributions, Suse uses the RPM package manager.  I installed Firefox, 
Thunderbird using the tarball method.

While I encourage you to learn the process of installing from a "tar ball" I 
also understand that sometimes you "just want it to work." As with other 
distributions, SuSE has a package manager. They call theirs, YaST, or Yet 
another System Tool. I'm using SuSE 9.1, so I'm just going to assume that 
your system is similar to what I see and hope this information helps:

When you click on the green ball (I think it's the head of the lizard they use 
for their logo), and look at the list that pops up (like Start in Winders) 
hover over System and you'll see another green ball with a wrench over it. 
Click on that for YaST. Once you've entered your root password and the YaST 
Control Center loads, you should see an icon with the label "Online Update" 
on the left side of the right hand window. As you go through the rest of this 
procedure, if you find that things are taking way too long, try changing your 
Installation Source, which you can reach from this icon. I use the University 
of Chicago.

Back on the YaST Control Center window, the icon "Install and Remove Software" 
is on the right hand side. Click on that to get to where the packages are 
listed. The default mode is Search, but the more useful mode, selected from 
the Filter drop down box near the top of the window, is Package Groups. Under 
the section Productivity is another section called Databases. PostgreSQL 
packages are included in both the Clients and Servers sections.

Having said that Package Groups is more useful, I'm not finding Mozilla that 
way. So, going back to the Search filter, and entering Mozilla gives a list 
that includes MozillaFirefox. Lots of folks are switching to Firefox; I've 
got it installed on one of my Win98 machines. However, give Konqueror a try. 
It's the browser that comes with the K gui. It works a lot like Windows 
Explorer on the files on your machine, and a lot like Mozilla on the web. (I 
think it uses the gecko engine.) You can browse both your filesystem and the 
web from the same tool.

<begin editorial rant>
Some years ago, when MicroSoft said they were going to make the browser an 
integral part of the os, this is what they should have ended up with.
<end editorial rant>

> Is there anyone in your  club that has the time to work with me?

In addition to this email list, the clinic has been mentioned. That's where I 
got my SuSE installation, and lots of help over the last several years. 
Directions are found here:

http://server.riverdale.k12.or.us/~danh/

If you haven't already found our web site, it's here:

http://www.pdxlinux.org/

One thing that has not been mentioned is that, due to the "highly" structured 
level of this organization, you are a member if you say that you are a 
member. So, welcome, new member of PLUG!

OK. I can get kind of wordy. Comes from being a tour guide, I guess. Hope this 
information is helpful, or in the preferred shorthand of email, HTH!

Subject: [PLUG] Encrypt a password
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0504041440310.17917-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I have a situation where I need to generate an encrypted password and a 
failing memory leaves me hanging as to how to do it.

I've tried grub-md5-crypt but it has a bug that it won't allow passwords
over 31 characters ( reported a couple of weeks ago but I have got no
acknowledgement ) and every other command I remember doesn't work.

This is for typical Fedora systems ( plus a few old Redhat 7.3, 8.0 and 9s
) and for the life of me I can't determine what passwd and PAM is doing.  
The kludge for now is a dummy account that I change the password in then
copy and paste the encrypted version where I need it.  I realize I'm being
kind of vague but the ramp up to explain it all is a little steep for me
to go into right now.

So have I searched using the wrong terms and is there a Cliff's Notes for 
this topic.


TIA,
Rod

Definitely not on my list of commands tried.  Best part is it works just 
like I want it to.

Problem is it is semi-broken.  Only accepts passwords up to 31 characters.  
Thirty-two and nothing comes back and with more than 32 you get the
characters after character 32 back.

Richard Clarke said that "The reason why you have people breaking into
your software is because your software sucks." More than just scathing
criticism of the software industry, this comment highlights the extreme
difficulty of assuring that your applications do what they are supposed
to do, and nothing else. You can test for what an application is
supposed to do, but you cannot effectively test for the surprising
"something else" mis-features that attackers exploit: they "tickle" your
applications with "creative" inputs that make software mis-behave, and
as a result can break into your systems. Effects like open source code
review help Linux to be more secure by being less likely to have
unpleasant surprises, but this does not eliminate the threat. To really
secure applications, host application security is required to nail down
what each application is permitted to do, to ensure that it is not doing
any surprising "something else"s. This talk will explain the theoretical
foundations that make proving "nothing else" impossible, and show how
host application security provides the only real alternative to
trust-worthy software. We then show how the LSM (Linux Security Modules)
feature (new in the Linux 2.6 kernel) enables unprecedented precision in
the control of application behavior on standard Linux kernels.

Usual meeting rules apply. Happy Hour meal prices for the first hour.

Subject: [PLUG] LDAP Question again
Message-ID: <4252ED1F.5060201@comcast.net>

I'm having another little problem getting LDAP setup and was hoping one 
of you could help.  I was attempting to setup phpLDAPadmin when I first 
ran into this error, so I went to the command line to make sure it 
worked and here is what happens.

When I run this command:
    ldapsearch -x -b 'dc=nclack,dc=k12,dc=or,dc=us'

I get a list back that looks like the following:

# nclack.k12.or.us
dn: dc=nclack,dc=k12,dc=or,dc=us
objectClass: dcObject
objectClass: organization
o: North Clackamas School District
dc: nclack

# Manager, nclack.k12.or.us
dn: cn=Manager,dc=nclack,dc=k12,dc=or,dc=us
objectClass: organizationalRole
cn: Manager

# Mickey Mouse, nclack.k12.or.us
dn: cn=Mickey Mouse,dc=nclack,dc=k12,dc=or,dc=us
objectClass: person
sn: Mouse
cn: Mickey Mouse

# Minnie Mouse, nclack.k12.or.us
dn: cn=Minnie Mouse,dc=nclack,dc=k12,dc=or,dc=us
objectClass: person
sn: Mouse
cn: Minnie Mouse

# Goofie, nclack.k12.or.us
dn: cn=Goofie,dc=nclack,dc=k12,dc=or,dc=us
objectClass: person
sn: Goofie
cn: Goofie

# search result
search: 2
result: 0 Success

# numResponses: 6
# numEntries: 5

When I enter the same command below:

    ldapsearch -x -b 'dc=nclack,dc=k12,dc=or,dc=us' -W

It to prompts me for the password and enter what I believe to be the 
password I get "ldap_bind: Invalid credentials (49)"

I changed the password for the ldap user and also ran the command 
slappasswd and copied the output into the slapd.conf file.

I'm using Fedora Core 2.

So can anybody tell me what I'm missing here?

Thank You

Robert Haack

Unless it's buried in one of your ldap config files, you need to supply 
ldapsearch its -D option, which specifies the DN you're using to bind to 
the server. E.g,

ldapsearch -D 'cn=Manager,dc=nclack,dc=k12,dc=or,dc=us' ...

Ok, just getting back to this.  I guess what I didn't understand was
how the IP worked in the Virtual Host.  Now I did read the link but
then I also read all these warnings from Apache here:

http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/dns-caveats.html

Now these are dated 1997 and not updated for the 2.0 release.  I can't
tell if they are a big deal anymore.  This was my concern.  I now have
removed all IP's from my httpd.conf file with the recommendations on
the list just not sure if any of the DNS warnings are still valid.

If someone knows let me know. If not I'll assume all is fine.  The
sites are working now.

thanks all,

Josh

The warnings do apply.  Consider the differences between:

<VirtualHost www.patch.com>
  <config statements>
</VirtualHost>

   and 

<VirtualHost *>
  <config statements>
</VirtualHost>

   and

<VirtualHost 199.88.144.12>
  <config statements>
</VirtualHost>

In the first example Apache needs to do DNS resolution to find out 
what the IP address of www.patch.com is, the second doesn't care 
and will apply to all IP addresses configured on the computer,
the third will only apply to requests that arrive at 199.88.144.12.

The IP address, or equivalent, in the <VirtualHost ...> tag instructs
Apache about what IP address(es) it should apply the block of directives
to. Note that the tag can contain multiple addresses.

For example:

<VirtualHost 199.88.144.12, 10.1.1.12>
    ServerAdmin webmaster at host.foo.com
	DocumentRoot /www/docs/host.foo.com
	ServerName host.foo.com
	ErrorLog logs/host.foo.com-error_log
	TransferLog logs/host.foo.com-access_log
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1>
	 ServerAdmin developer at host.foo.com
	 DocumentRoot /www/docs/test.foo.com
	 ServerName host.foo.com
	 ErrorLog logs/test.foo.com-error_log
	 TransferLog logs/test.foo.com-access_log
</VirtualHost>

A developer can access host.foo.com from the local box and be directed
to a test tree of the site and it's content. Any other request for
host.foo.com - that will arrive on one of the two interfaces not local -
will be directed to the real site content.

  http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/core.html#virtualhost

   I would appreciate having someone explain these entries in the sshd log:

**Unmatched Entries**
warning: /etc/hosts.allow, line 8: host name/name mismatch: freshweb.pl != webus01.freshweb.pl
warning: /etc/hosts.allow, line 8: host name/name mismatch: freshweb.pl != webus01.freshweb.pl

   The referenced line in /etc/hosts.allow is:

ALL: LOCAL @appl-ecosys.com

   I've seen many other cracking attempts, but the messages of those relate to
unknown users or incorrect passwords (for unknown users). This has me
puzzled.

Thanks,

Rich

According to this thread [1], its a mismatch between IP and hostname.

A good trick to stopping this is to run sshd on a non-standard port. Just edit 
/etc/ssh/sshd_config and change Port 22 to 1515 or something similar.

   Thanks, Jack. Then the message does not explain the situation but is thrown
up because something is needed.

   I might end up doing this. As long as sshd.conf is highly restrictive it
seems to be working very well.

Well, that makes things like secure rsync (over shh) a tad more of a 
hassle... here's another idea a friend of mine and I worked out:

freshweb.pl has their name resolving oddly.  I was scanned by the same
site.

I don't use hosts.allow.  (I have too many times  need to connect to
work servers from coffee shops.)

Is this for a custom application or for an existing one?

openssl can generate Apache format MD5 and passwd format MD5. If you are
defining it, I would go for SHA-256 or SHA-512.

   I understand that the pdf is a sub-set of PostScript which explains why
file sizes of the former can be an order of magnitude (or more) smaller than
the latter. However, what puzzles me is why the display of the .ps file (in
GhostView) is of a much lower quality than is the display of the .pdf file in
either xpdf or acroread.

   Have others noticed this, too? Any ideas why?

Check the cable on the drive.  Make sure it is for ATA100 or ATA133.
(Not an old cheap cable.)  Also make sure that both ends are plugged in
correctly and the cable is not stretched or mangled.

Look at `hdparm /dev/hdd` and see if DMA is turned on.  It looks like it
is not able to handle the speed, or cannot read the disc due to
fingerprints or scratches, or is having a DMA problem.

Sorry, I prematurely deleted the message about alternative sshd ports 
being a pain for things like rsync.

Not so, really.

You can either adjust your individual ~/.ssh/config file or you can 
modify /etc/ssh/ssh_config:

   # host-specific options
   Host host-with-alt-port.yourdomain.com
     Port 1234
   # network-specific options
   Host *.yourdomain.com

freshweb.pl has their name resolving oddly.  I was scanned by the same
site.

I don't use hosts.allow.  (I have too many times  need to connect to
work servers from coffee shops.)

That only works if the network you want to connect from doesn't block
most of the "non-standard" ports.

acroread and xpdf do antialiasing, while GhostScript does not.

This makes sense given their targets, GS is aimed at printers which don't
have greyscale, only B&W and stippling. xpdf and acroread are aimed at
computer displays which do do true greyscale. On printers at 600 dpi most
characters are going to be 60 dots or more tall, at which point AA isn't
a big deal. On a screen where 12 pixels tall is large, AA is a big deal.

Hi:

I have 4 linux boxes at work that I use for various projects.
They don't have a backup solution and I am thinking about
getting a NAS to serve as backup.
What are some of the recommended NAS brands and work well
with Linux?  Do I mount NAS partition(s) via NFS?

Also, I have been looking at some info  online and many of these
NAS said that Windows and MAC can drop files via web browser.  Is that
going through Samba or something?

thanks for any pointers.

Not a bad way to do it, given how cheap they are these days.

Some NASes support NFS, but I think most just support SMB, which is
reasonably fast and secure, and supported by Winders, MacOS and Linux.

If money's no object and you want high performance, capacity and
reliability, look at a Network Appliance.

In your case, it sounds like 1-2 cheap li'l single-drive units would
do fine.  I hear Buffalo's LinkStation works OK, and they even support
folks who install their own Linux on it.

Most NASes support SMB, but that sounds like plain ol' HTTP-uploading,
which is its own protocol.  And then there's WebDAV.

I seem to remember an (X) application that allowed you to point at a color
on the screen and it would report back its name and/or rgb components.  
It has been too long since I did this so tmpwatch on my brain must have
deleted the name.

I've tried using the gimp color wheel to match a color I have on my screen 
but the old eyes seem to be betraying me.

Does this ring a bell for anyone?

Ronald,

Would you explain the high lighted iptables lines for the iptables novice
( and challenged? )  They almost make sense to me but I can't reconcile
your explanation with the lines.

Most Commercial NAS vendors offer multiprotocol file sharing (Various versions
of NFS, CIFS, HTTP, DeltaV etc.).  Some use  samba for their CIFS
implementation, some use native CIFS code.  If you are looking for something for
backup only, you can use NDMP in conjunction w/ low cost ATA or SATA drives. 

There are a lot of vendors out there, and price and features vary from the very
high end (Netapp, Panasas) to lowered end systems powered by Linux or Windows.

I don't think there is really any serious differences with the  lower end
systems, And in these types of cases it's typically easier to "roll your own",
ie add a 5th Linux box with a Serial ATA RAID card and a bunch of cheap drives.
Install Samba, NFS, Rsync OpenAFS and have fun =)  You can enhance the server
with a Open Source / commercial backup package to handle things like NDMP.

If you need snapshots, mirroring, High Performance or other bells and whistles,
I would recommend a entry level or used netapp filer. 


Regards,
Max

If you are familiar with POP-before-SMTP, it is somewhat conceptually 
similar, in that once an IP has been seen on one port, for one kind of 
traffic, they are allowed on another port, for another kind of traffic. 
Unlike POP-before-SMTP, however, connections on the first port are not 
verified in any way. Thus, the need for port-scanner rules on either 
side.

In response to another poster, yes, the sshd_config file handles ssh 
connections from specific static IP's well (as does iptables), and the 
config file even works with un-poisoned DNS, but it (the config file) 
fares poorly when a sysadmin is in a remote hotel attending a 
conference (or whatever takes them away from specific IP addresses), 
and must connect in from whatever IP they can get at their location.

Many of you may have heard about the "3 minute WEP hack" that has
rendered WEP wireless networks completely insecure.  I thought to
myself "but all my internal network traffic is ssh encrypted, so it
doesn't matter".  However, not all traffic is.  All my printers are
on the ethernet, and they all are talking LPR protocol, which is
unencrypted.  Anyone tapping into my network could watch the print
files go by and extract whatever secrets they contain. 

Now I could send all printer traffic down encrypted VPN tunnels to the
server, and put the printers on a separate net connected only to the
server.  That should be secure against all but a physical tap on the
separate printer network.  However, this is pretty damned inconvenient,
given that the printers are scattered around.  I would have to run two
sets of network cables, or have Yet Another Device that unVPN's each
individual printer's connection.  It also means I lose printing when
the server is down.

Any other ideas?  I guess if my physical network is penetrated, I am
Owned anyway.  Time to upgrade the security alarm ...

Physical? The so-called traditional "physical" layer stopped mattering 
a *long* time ago. Remember the 386?

One word:
Tempest.

Okay, maybe that's a bit short and alarmist, and I should use more 
words.

Let me put it another way:
If your data needs *require* more security, the less your systems emit, 
the better, be it WiFi or simple UTP....

Oh, and since most breaches occur inside, you should monitor their drug 
use, credit records, social life, politics, and sexual history of all 
of your employees, and EMP and de-and-re-magnetize them on every 
entrance and exit from their cages....

As you may (should?) have noted by now, I am postulating an argument of 
extremes. Creating security in a network cannot ever be about making a 
network "totally secure", unless you have unlimited resources and an 
unlimited budget. Since *nobody* has that (and yes, I do mean nobody), 
it becomes a question of balance.

Bops rule (somebody *should* have a prior rule....) of secrecy:
#1: Every secret has a cost, be it in losing, or keeping, the secret.

If you spend 50k guarding something that has a 10K cost, that's, well, 
silly.

Getting back to LPR... if you're worried, run cable! I've seen some 
sites where the CEO is STP to their officers, and where I have guns 
trained on me while I worked. So what.

It's a very simple formula:
Security < Value of secret: Less security
Security > Value of secret: More security

If the LPR data matters enough to protect the things "on the wire", 
it's a done deal.

If you have more than one server, or print queue capable host, on the 
wired network you could set up print queues on those boxes and print
to them.  This is the same situation you'd be in if you did not have
the convenience of network attached printers.  

Traffic between hosts on the wired segment is not echoed to the wireless
segment of the network.  That's part of the function of a bridge - to 
only pass traffic between the the segments on different media when 
the src-dst pair are on the different segments.

Good afternoon.

Our house network is currently connected to the Internet through a
little netgear "nat firewall" box that also handles the other end of the
wireless connection I use for the laptop. I'd like to replace the
firewall portion of this box with a linux firewall box and do some proxying
and the like.  Is it feasible to keep the DHCP on the little thing, and
let it handle the Wireless? Should I start up the DHCP daemon on the
linux box (which is where I'd like it so it's easier to make little
graphs and charts with regards to bandwidth usage)? Can the little box,
in general, do the wireless connection (and this is the tricky
question), but not the dhcp? Or does it all depend on the little box?

I have been very unsafe and lazy.  I have been setting up a new home

I know, I know, that is not preferred, but that is the situation.  I
want to change my erroneous ways and copy all of root's configuration

using that account like a good boy.
I am using Gnome with Evolution, Firefox, Gaim, and Rhythmbox.
Any other needed information can be provided, if helpful.

I remember that too. After fruitless searching I realized that it was

BTW, I found a cool Firefox extension called ColorZilla that does much the

Does anyone know of an amplifier for 802.11b networks to go between
an antenna and the card?  If I'm not mistaken, it's legal to use 
up to 1 watt of transmit power.  I need greater range, I'm
hoping that I can simply increase the power.  I thought I'd
ask before going to the trouble of trying to build my own.

Aside from boosting the power, who is a good supplier of dish
and wire grid antennas for 802.11b/g networking?  Cantennas 
are highly directional, it can be a challenge to line two 
of them up. 

I'm also curious about using LMR-900 cable instead of LMR-400
and what PoE cable is.

This is neat. Anyway to do this for "all" high range ports.  I'm seeing a 
bunch of attempts at ports above 30000 doing ssh2.

Coming from the top or the bottom of the port range?

There you go!  I remember seeing this to and had a couple of _serious_

You are mistaken.  It is not legal to use that much power.

Dish or wire grid antennas are a good way to go.  The Personal

First you need cable where you want to watch it on channel 21 or 23. 

If you are in Washington county the tune your TV to any date listed. But if you are in Portland the only two times you can watch it is 
Wed 04/13/05 5:00Am 
Mon 04/25/05 10:00Am 
on channel 11. Once I get "better known" then I can get better time slots.

Does any one want to do a 15 minute presentation, on something this next show?  Please let me know.

Bop had some good comments, some others are thinking I am worried
about wireless security.  Again, it was the wireless issues that
made me notice this, but it is physical wire security that I worry
about.  In particular, I assume that one of the machines on my
network (perhaps the firewall, perhaps my lovely not-security-focused
wife's laptop) could get Owned.  However, even with perfect machine
security, a small machine could get added by an intruder to spy on
the network  (is that REALLY the same unmodified Netgear switch I
had there last week? ).  Then the packets on my net would be
observable by the Enemy,  and the LPR packets from any machine
to the printers would be observable.

If the printers are on a separate network to the server, they could
only be observed on that physical network, assuming that LPR jobs
are normally sent over VPN from the clients to the servers.  And
perhaps that physical network could be firewalled at the server to
keep anything nasty on the printer network from reporting back to
the 'net.  Then the tapping mechanism would have to have a physical
or radio link back to the network that can reach the internet.
Still, that link could be little more than a couple of cables
(who would notice two more?) and a couple of modified switches.

People worry obsessively about software security and wireless
security, while often ignoring good old physical security.  Cost
conscious intruders will forgo giant banks of key-cracking computers
when they can achieve the same result with a firmware mod on a
switch, and a lock pick.  The sad thing is, if somebody developed
special versions of printers with secure communication protocols,
or mini-firewall boxes, that would result in a indentifiable 
single target for such modifications.

This is all an exercise in extreme paranoia, of course.  I doubt
that anyone cares enough to read my printer traffic right now. 
However, this is just the sort of thing that a small business
with Very Important Secrets ought to worry about.  Since I am
considering starting such a business, I should have a good
answer to the problem.

If someone breaks in to install a bugging device, ALL of your hardware
is potentially compromised.  That includes the CPU on the machine that
is doing the encryption (is that really JUST a heatsink, or is it also
a microwave transmitter antenna in a cunning disguise?!).

FCC regulations say milliwatts. I don't have the exact at hand.
Also, they must not interfere with any other service in the area.

  The solution is not to blast more power into the air.  All that does
is create interference for other people using the "free" spectrum. 
(Good neigbors do not turn the knobs to "11".)  The solution is to
take advantage of all the power available within the wi-fi specs.  You
can get all the distance you need with good design and quality
antenna's.  DefCon sponsors a wi-fi shoot-out each year.  The record
is 55 miles over an un-amplified connection.

Wi-Fi Shootout in the Desert 
http://wired-vig.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,64440,00.html

  Standard wi-fi antennas are omni-directional.  You'll need
directional antennas to push a long distance and pick up a weak
signal.  Panels, tuned cavities (cans), and yagi's are designed to
radiate most of their energy in a specific direction.  Directional
antennas can also provide additional gain to the receive signal.

This yagi provides 14Dbi of gain on the receive side:

http://www.radiolabs.com/products/antennas/2.4gig/14elewpyagi.php

  The technical term for what you're trying to do is "Wi-Fi Link
Budget Engineering".  There is quite a bit of information available
through google.

In that scenario, use parallel port attached printers.

Message-ID: <4255BA3B.9020209@ahapala.net>

Ever look at the output of your history command and wonder when you
executed that command? If one sets the HISTTIMEFORMAT bash variable then
the history entries will have a timestamp.

The format variables can be found in the date command.

Ex:
keith at r31$ export HISTTIMEFORMAT=%d%h%y\ %H:%M

produces output like:
528  07Apr05 15:44 ls /var/www
529  07Apr05 15:45 less .bash_profile
530  07Apr05 15:53 history | tail

once you've got the HISTTIMEFORMAT you'd like, make the setting occur at
each login by putting it in ~/.bash_profile for login shells or
~/.bashrc for non-login shells.

Nice tip. However, you need to be at bash 3.0 or better to have this
feature.

Which would be preferred -- before or after?  I have three blocks that are

Dear Friends,

CNN Money reports ODOT's driver's license management system is moving to
SuSE!

The cool thing is that Steve Adams make a completely business-based 
argument for the migration: efficiency, uptime, security.

Not to mention that it actually works and doesn't cost $100,000,000,
unlike certain other Oregon DMV computer upgrades.

Steve really worked hard on this a long time. He never complained or
seemed to get discouraged; he just kept on moving forward. He deserves a

Subject: [PLUG] Searching for <(something)> with Google
Message-ID: <200504082030.56216.rsteff.l@comcast.net>

I'm working through a CSS book that assumes I already know all the HTML used. 
While I know most of it, I ran into an item that I have never encountered 
before: <thread>. I finally found the description of it in the XHTML Black 
Book. But, before I thought to look there, I tried a Google search, which, 
instead of returning something useful, returned many links to thread, most of 
which were discussion threads. The ads along side even included sewing 
thread! (I got a stich out of those! -- Sorry)

Anyway, is there some way to search for <thread> and get what I want? In 
Google, I searched for:

"<thread>" "html reference"

It appears that Google's search engine ignores the "<" and ">" characters. Is 
there some trick to getting it to not ignore them?

BTW, for those who, like me, had not heard of <thread> before, here's the 
scoop from the XHTML Black Book:

Purpose: Creates a table head when you're grouping rows.

Doh!

It must be getting late, or something. I see my mistake. Searching for:

 "<thead>" "html reference"

does indeed turn up plenty of references to table heads.

Sorry for the noise. Hope you got a good chuckle out of it.

Some people will point you as 'rename(1)', but I always find it too much
trouble to learn a new command when a little scripting works just as
well:

for i in *; do j=$(echo $i|sed 's# ##g'); mv -vi "$i" $j; done

Oh yes you can probably be fancy and use some bash parameter expansion;
a little more obscure perhaps, but cleaner looking:

for i in *; do mv -vi "$i" ${i// /}; done

Search for "Parameter Expansion" in the bash(1) man page.

Just to point out that the value above is EIRP and not "raw" output from the 
transmitter of the radio.  Also Point-to-Point has significantly different 
values than Point-to-Multipoint.

Dick,

   I wonder if you misspelled the tag? Using the search string
                                 +xhtml +tags

google returned a number of solid references ...

   ... However, all the above definitions were to the tag <thead>. No 'r'.

   The tag <thead> shows up in both xhtml and html tag lists on the w3c web
site; the tag <thread> is not found.

Last time I did something like this, the for loop didn't parse it
correctly (it treated each word as a separate token).

This should work:
 ls "* *" | while read i
 do
  j=$(echo $i|sed 's# ##g'); mv -vi "$i" $j
 done

What's wrong with amplifying a signal just enough so that 
the loss over your coax run plus the initial pre amplified 
power equals the output power out of the amplifier?
If your card puts out 16dbm and the loss over your cable
run is 16dbm, what's wrong with amplifying your signal
to 32 dbm?  Let's say your card uses 30 milliwatts of
power, why not hook the card into an amplifier that 
outputs the signal into this coax run at 60 milliwatts?
Is is better to let the signal weaken over the coax
run and amplify it just before the antenna instead?
If I amplify after a loss to the power level I started
with, is this legal?

If I can get where I'm going with the stock amount of 
power, I'm all for that.

I asked the manufacturer what LMR-400 can take, he said 
it can take 100's of watts.  He also said that the limit
on 802.11b is 1 watt, but I doubt that I need to use 
anywhere near that much power.  Going from 30 milliwatts 
to 60 milliwatts sounds closer to what I need to do short
of switching out the antenna.

Say there's a legal card that uses 100 milliwatts of power.
My cards do 16-18dbm, I think that's around 40 milliwatts.
Can I boost my signal via a circuit between the pigtail
and the antenna back up to 40 milliwatts or at least 
something under 100 milliwatts?  Are boosters illegal 
without an amatuer license, or do you simply have to stay 
within the power limits?  Cable loss reduces transmit 
power, is that correct?  Are transmit power and gain the 
same thing?

perl -e 'for (@ARGV) {$o = $_; tr/ /_/; rename $o, $_ unless -e}' *

Basically, for the filenames listed on the command line,
save the old name as $o, replace spaces with underscores, and
rename the old name to the new name unless the new name exists.

Are you sure that wasn't because you didn't quote the variable expansion
"$i" like above?  The 'for' loop shouldn't have problems, but if you do
not the variable expansion, you will have problems (i.e., 'mv $i $j'
will not work, but 'mv "$i" $j' will).  Of course, I cannot say
how /portably/ the 'for' loop will work; it seems to do okay under
pdksh...

Maybe I'm missing something (it's happened before), but if all he
wants to do is replace spaces in filenames with underscores, why not
use the 'rename' command?

  rename 's/ /_/g' *

It's simple to learn, and powered by Perl-y goodness.

When I was playing with this, I was using zsh and I didn't need the
quoting on $i.  I didn't try it with bash though.  

I liked your ${i// /_} solution, btw, which I also came up with.
Randal's perl with the "unless" clause was nice too.  Ironically, it
had less line-noise than the bash equivalent!  ;-)

The whole thing with the amatuer license is wrong. These devices are not 
covered by their license. You'd need a commercial license of some type, 
maybe.
FCC regulations say the manufacturer is responsible for equipment 
suitability to the service. I think the "preamp" idea runs into the old 
"CB SignalBooster" thinking which is illegal. Same as using the TV 
pre-amp. It's not designed for the service, making it illegal to use.

Cable loss can be cured with more efficient cable, but then you get into 
the cost/return factor. Transmit power and gain are not the same thing.
Gain is transmit power increased by a number. My memory is foggy but 
it's something like this:

input 100 watts into a 10db gain antenna and the theoretical output from 
the antenna is 200 watts (this is where my thinking is foggy) actual 
output is still 100 watts, but the broadcast pattern affects how that 
power is distrubted in the antenna's pattern.

which is why the "Pringles Can" antenna makes such a difference in AP 
performance.

Subject: [PLUG] Aborting a shell script
Message-ID: <200504092015.49183.rsteff.l@comcast.net>

How do I tell a shell script to stop running?

Here's the script:

--------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash

for i in *JPG; 
do
convert -size 1600x1600 -resize 1600x1600 $i 1600/`basename $i .JPG` 
-1600.jpg;
done
--------------------------------------------------------

(The -1600.jpg; is on the line above it; it wrapped in this e-mail.)

I'm not sure why this is failing, since the same command works with smaller 
numbers, but that's a separate question. The immediate question is how do I 
stop this script? I'm getting an error message that says:

convert: Unable to open file (1600/IMG_nnnn).

where nnnn is a four digit number representing an individual image file. Since 
there are 61 images in the directory, I'd like to shut the script down rather 
than sit through all 61 error messages.

I tried <ctrl>C, and <crtl>D, but those had no effect. I opened up another 
xterm window, su'd to root, and tried to kill the operation, but discovered 
that I was killing the convert fork rather than the script, and I'm not sure 
which process the script is running under. I tried one of the bash processes 
ps ax showed me, but it had no effect. I suspect that 

kill nnnn

wasn't enough, and not having done this very often, I'm not sure what else to 
try. man kill didn't suggest anything useful (to me, anyway). And the two 
books I looked in, while great at describing shell scripting, make no mention 
of how to stop one you made a goof in.

Of course, by the time I finish typing this, and get a response, the script 
may be finished! But I'd like to know for the next time.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

Depending upon whether you've got `fortune` installed, and which fortune
DBs are installed, you may have /usr/share/games/fortunes/cookie:

backups: always in season, never out of style.

Have you done your backups today/this week? In the end your backup tool
of choice, be it dump, tar, rsync, zip or something else, doesn't matter.
All that matters is that you get on a schedule and use it regularly.

Perhaps it is due to using hardware well past what most people would
consider its expected life span due to $$$, but in the past 3 months I've
had two machines die.

I strongly prefer `dump`, but other tools are fine as well. Just remember
to do your backups!

Assuming that "convert" returns an non-zero exit status if there is an error  
you could add the following conditional test to your script following the 
call to "convert":

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  exit 1
fi

Thanks. That's a great idea to do in the future, but doesn't help me figure 
out how to stop a script that doesn't have good sense like that built into 
it.

Somewhat in my own defense, I did test the basic command on a single image 
file before building the original script, which only produced the smaller 
copies, 25, 100, and 400. Since that worked, I thought that I should be able 
to get a way with just adding another size, 1600, and it would work. Before I 
do it again, I'll have to test converting to 1600 on a single image and see 
why it doesn't like it, before making a script out of it.

Subject: [PLUG] backup bootsector to usb drive
Message-ID: <200504101704.23452.ewilhelm@sbcglobal.net>

We were talking about making a bootable recovery hard drive using an 
external usb drive after the meeting on Thursday (sorry, I don't know 
everyone's name yet.)

Anyway, it was pointed out to me that this won't work:

  dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/sda bs=446 count=1

...and that I would need to use grub-install.  Well, it seems that grub 
stores some info about the rest of the partition geometry in the boot 
sector, so no that won't work if the usb drive isn't identical to the 
hda.

So, today I tried it with grub-install.  The grub docs seem to indicate 
that this should work (assuming sdb1 and sbd2 are already rsync copies 
of "/boot/" and "/" (respectively.))

  mount /dev/sdb2 backup
  mount /dev/sda1 backup/boot
  grub-install --root-directory=backup/boot/ /dev/sda

This comes from the "Installing GRUB using grub-install" portion of the 
info pages (translating fd0 to /dev/sda.)  But, this gives me some 
"/dev/sda does not have a corresponding bios drive" error messages and 
no amount of changes to boot/grub/device.map seems to do the trick.

So, what I ended up with was this process (and it seems that the chroot 
is required (as opposed to anything that you can accomplish by using 
options when calling grub.))

  mount /dev/sda2 backup/
  mount /dev/sda1 backup/boot/
  chroot backup/
  grub --no-floppy
  > root (hd1,0)
  > setup (hd1)
  > quit
  exit
  umount backup/boot/
  umount backup/

I'm not sure if I'm covering new ground here or if the grub docs just 
need updating.  The big catch seems to be that the usb drive is not 
where it *will be* when it is booted for recovery use.

If anyone knows how to tell what device is (hd1) when you're talking 
about /dev/sda, that would be helpful, since this is a dirt-simple test 
system that I was using and it gets more complex when you have a couple 
of cameras or thumb-drives plugged in somewhere.  Most of the grub docs 
assume that you are either working with floppies or ide-connected 
drives.  (and the grub 'find /boot/grub/stage1' command doesn't work!)

Does dirvish use the -c option to rsync (even occasionally?).  I
usually don't either, but on a whim I inserted it last night and found
some somewhat surprising differences.  I made two rsync snapshots in
quick succession (first without and then with -c) and then recursive
diff'd the two snapshots.  I'll have to go back and patch up some of
the old archives (or the working tree, as the case may be).  

Of course, with the -c it is MUCH slower, but probably worth doing
every so often.

Message-ID: <200504102032.26914.rsteff.l@comcast.net>

At least, I think it's automount -- I haven't done this enough to know for 
sure.

Anyway, I popped a just burned CD into my CD-ROM drive (not the burner). It 
mounted itself, and I was able to look at it's contents. I was unable to 
unmount it until I closed KMail. I looked at the CD from the command line in 
an xterm window, and also with Konqueror. I closed Konqueror, but that wasn't 
enough to let me remove the CD. It wasn't until I closed KMail, the only 
other application that was running at the time, that I could eject the CD.

Any thoughts on why KMail should hold the CD open (or whatever the right way 
to  say that is)?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0504110924140.1004-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I just got a friends computer setup and using Verizon DSL after finding 
out they don't do the way we do.  PPPoE where we do bridged ( or routed  
before ActionTec and Qwest fixed the DSL router/modems -- another story 
completely. )

So after a long-ish day Saturday ( with no luck ) then some research 
Sunday AM I found the xDSL settings ( Fedora Core 3 -- PogoLinux system ) 
and away we were going until suddenly it wasn't.  There was some mention 
about Verizon disconnecting after 10 minutes but this was happening after 
1 minute.
   I kludged a cron job to ping an IP every minute but think there is a
"better way".  Any FC and Verizon DSL (PPPoE) users with clues for me?  
Heck anyone with a clue-stick could help.


Cheers,

Abstract:
Pentium Chronicles is the title of my book, to be published in 2005 by 
IEEE/Wiley, describing the development of Intel's P6 chip from the point of 
view of its chief architect. P6 has been the basis for all of Intel's most 
successful microprocessors since the early 1990's, including the Pentium 
II, Pentium III, Celeron, Xeon, and Centrino products. This talk will 
follow the general outline of the book, highlighting the management and 
technical breakthroughs, as well as some of the errors we made, in the 
design of this ground breaking machine. Think: the Beatles' Magical Mystery 
Tour of a modern microprocessor design.

Bio:
Bob Colwell was Intel's chief IA32 microprocessor architect from 1992-2000, 
and managed the IA32 Architecture group in Intel's Hillsboro, Oregon 
facility through the P6 and Pentium 4 projects. He was named an Intel 
Fellow in 1996. Previously, Colwell was a CPU architect at VLIW pioneer 
Multiflow Computer, a hardware design engineer at workstation vendor Perq 
Systems, and a member of technical staff at Bell Labs. He has published 
many technical papers and journal articles, is inventor or co-inventor on 
45+ patents, and has participated in numerous panel sessions and invited 
talks. He is the Perspectives editor for IEEE Computer Magazine, and writes 
the At Random column. He is currently an independent consultant. Colwell 
holds the BSEE degree from the University of Pittsburgh, and the MSEE and 
PhD from Carnegie Mellon University.

Message-ID: <1113254228.22262.20.camel@dagon.fnordora.org>

I have a site running a fully patched Fedora Core 2.  There are two
machines.  One is running Apache with mod_perl and some cgi.  The other
is running MySQL.

About once a month, the web server and MySQL stop responding.  The ssh
daemons are fine.  Nothing seems stuck.  Nothing is eating the cpu.  It
just stops working.  Stopping and restarting httpd and MySQL fix the
problem.

I am not finding anything in the logs to indicate an attack.  (At least
no signs of success.)  I am a bit baffled as to the cause.

Ideas?

I need to put a Snort box on the front of these systems, but I am afraid
of it throttling the bandwidth too much.

Nope.  It was a different issue; the for statement was getting its
input from a command within $( ) or ``.

### This works as expected:
bash-2.05$ for f in *; do echo $f; done
afile
anotherFile
file with spaces in its name

### This doesn't
bash-2.05$ for f in $(find . -type f -print); do echo $f; done
./file
with
spaces
in
its
name
./anotherFile
./afile

You may remember last year when I pestered you folks about a nifty

Peter Harrison.  This is a recipe-oriented book, like Carla's, but
with a focus on networking issues and on debugging.

Well, I also pestered Peter, and pestered some publishers, and when
he got tired of being pestered he took over the publisher pestering. 
And now I am looking at the "Linux Quick Fix Notebook", part of the
Bruce Perens' Open Source Series from Prentice Hall.  I can see
Peter made lots of improvements to his already great on-line book.

Here's the problem.  We need to have an air-gap connection to a
portable device.  The portable device has a three-wire RS232 serial
port.  We are thinking of using a serial-to-bluetooth converter (they
seem to exist).  Questions:

a) do you need another bluetooth-to-serial converter on the PC end, or
   is any old PCI or USB bluetooth device going to work for the PC
   end?

b) what is the Linux software interface like?

c) has anyone played with bluetooth on Linux much?

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [PLUG] rendering circa 1995 WP and HP Laserjet Series II files
Message-ID: <86ekdga5qy.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


I've got an old document (not _that_ old, just 10 years) in two forms:
as WordPerfect file and as what appears to be a "print-to-file" as a
HP LaserjetII device.  I suppose if I had one of those printers I
could copy it to /dev/lp and it would print, but I don't have one of
those printers. 

Is there an HPLJ emulator, say, that would render Postscript of even a
series of PNGs?  In other words, an inverse Ghostscript.  I googled a
little, unsuccessfully.

Alternatively, has anyone got a circa 1995 version of Word Perfect
that could print to something useful, like Postscript?  Or, yet more
alternatively, _any_ version of Word Perfect that might be able to do
that. 

In short, I've got those two versions and I want something useful.  I
am happy to provide the files in question or accept broad hints.  

Any ideas?

My copy of OpenOffice claims to import WordPerfect files, and there's
also WP2LaTeX.  SwiftView sez it can view PCL (e.g. HP LaserJet)
files, and most laser printers (such as mine) understand it as well.

If you have no luck with other methods, email 'em to me and I'll send
it back readable, either in email or in an envelope.

It's just another one of those fine PLUG member benefits,

I followed a suggestion of Aaron's and used SwiftView (trial edition)
to convert the PCL to multipage TIFF, then tiff2pdf to create a PDF.

Subject: [PLUG] dirvish, slocate.cron, and yum updates
Message-ID: <20050412162041.GB13266@gate.kl-ic.com>


I run disk-to-disk backups every night with dirvish, the disk-to-disk
backup program whose development I manage.  It makes nightly full
copies of the files on all my machines, mostly making additional
hardlinks in duplicated directory structures to pre-existing files.
After collecting a few hundred days of backups on one backup disk,
there are hundreds of millions of references to these files on the
disk.  

I got caught by a funny error last night (Apr 12 early AM). 
I warn dirvish users to:

(1) unmount backup partitions when not in use, and

(2) add backup partitions to the /etc/cron.daily/slocate.cron script,
    like so:

    /usr/bin/updatedb -f "nfs,smbfs,ncpfs,proc,devpts" \
                      -e "/tmp,/var/tmp,/usr/tmp,/afs,/net,/backup"
                                                           ^^^^^^^
This prevents updatedb from trying to find every file in your backups
and store them in its database at /var/lib/slocate/slocate.db .  This
file is the database used by locate to tell you where files are stored. 
You do NOT want it to try to locate the millions of files in your
backups.  Trust me on this.

I run "yum update" every night, and on March 22, it downloaded
slocate-2.7-4.i386.rpm .   The package is constructed badly;  it
silently over-wrote the slocate.cron file back to the original,
with /backup removed.  

Last night, I left my /backup partition mounted and some test programs
using it.  I normally umount the partition as part of the script that
calls dirvish-runall, but last night the umount failed because /backup
was being used by the test programs.  When dirvish completed,
slocate.cron came after.  And as a result, updatedb ran on /backup and
created a *huge* /var/lib/slocate/slocate.db.tmp file, filling /var . 
Fortunately, I have separate partitions for /var/log and /var/spool, so
the machine kept running .  I had to find and stop the three processes
involved in slocate, followed by removing the .tmp file.  Back to normal.

To prevent a re-occurence, I changed slocate.cron to chmod 555, and
additionally did a chattr +i on it.  This may kill a future yum update,
but it will prevent a silent over-write of this critical file,  and a
subsequent dirvish-backup-induced overflow of the slocate.db area.

Keith

PS:  on a related subject, yum builds a huge collection of RPMs in
/var/cache/yum/updates-released/packages .  I have this symbolically
linked to a directory in another partition, /iso, which I do not 
back up with dirvish.  This helps keep the size of my /var partition
reasonable.

I have some crazy files that I'm trying to remove that come up with
these file permissions:

---x--s-wt  26227 56055    60670    14824589347723701499 Dec 31  1969

?r-Sr-S-wx  32767 439703130 2443739173 2926262202 Dec  5  1922 fileName4

These were files that were moved from another server to the new
server. I can't remove them or delete them from the server as root. 
If I try ti get:

rm: remove write-protected regular file `fileName1'? y
rm: cannot remove `fileName1': Operation not permitted

I'm doing this as root on the machine that has the file.  This is a
Redhat  2.4.21-4.ELsmp #1 SMP machine.  LVM Raid as well.

I rsync'd the files from another Redhat 9 box and this is how some of
them are coming out.  There are many others like this.  If I could
just remove them that would be fine.  I have also tried 'unlink' but I
can't do that either.

thoughts? suggestions?  My next thought as of now is backup my data
and rebuild the Raid.  Hate to do that.

Thanks for any guidance,

Josh

Josh,

   I had screwed up a filename so it began with a slash, or something similar.
What finally worked for me was to put the full path and file name in double
quotes. With luck it will work for you, too.

   It's been a few months since I fired up VMware to run a legacy application.
I just tried but when I attempted to log in, it told me that it could not
make a permanent connection to the linux share where data are exchaged
between the real OS and the virtural one.

   /etc/smb.conf still has the proper settings.

   I don't use VMware or samba enough to know where to look to find the source
of the problem. I'd really appreciate suggestions.

Maybe a (recursive (use carefully)) 'chmod -R 700 ./' would do it?

There are 300 correspondance* files all numbered sequentially that need

I tried a few things but I would be embarrassed to show them here.

This looks too simple so I'm probably not understanding completely.
Assuming the input files are all in the same directory, you can use a simple
'for' loop to process each of them in turn and use the last character of the
input filename as the output filename.
Am I missing something?

Except for the third one which thinks it's a directory, the rest have
mangled file types in the directory listing. You'll probably need to use
some sort of file system repair utility.

Unmounting the file system and running the appropriate version of fsck
on it might be enough to shake them out.

Were they originally regular files (and not block or character device
files, named pipes, etc)?

One big update:

1. Deleting with full path and quotes - Denied
2. lsattr: lsattr: Permission denied While reading flags on fileName1
3. chmod -R on parent directory: Operation Not Permitted
4. The original files are: normal permission like rw-rw-r-  or similar.

The parent directory begins with a # in this case but I have other
files with the same problems and no weird path names.  So ruled that
out.

Haven't tried taking off line and running fsck yet.  It is a bunch of
home directories so I need to do it at night.

Anything else I could do?  If not I'll try fsck on it tonight or
something.

Thanks,

Josh

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0504131120230.18426@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   As I wrote yesterday, my vmware virtual win98 cannot see the network. It
knows what share to use during login but just cannot connect to it. VMware ie
properly configured so the problem is in the win98 network setup.

   A long time ago I had this same problem and someone told me where, within
the win98 desktop, I would find a dialog box that lets me specify the network
connections. I cannot find the message in my e-mail collection here nor can I
find how to get to the right place by trial and error.

   In Explorer (the file manager), under the Tools menu is an option to "map
network drive". When I select e:\ and choose path (in the lower data entry
widget), \\SALMO\WINSTUFF (the correct share/path) is displayed. However, I
cannot get the silly thing to connect to it. It tells me that either the
server or the share cannot be found.

   Where else do I have to set up things?

Thanks,

Rich

Just thinking aloud a bit more here...what are the permissions of the
directory in which these files reside? Do a:

ls -ld .

in that directory and post the result.

Also, what are the actual file names? Could there be any spaces,
non-printable characters, etc. embedded in the file names?

Rich,

I'm not a Windows guru by any means, but I'm not aware of anything else
you should have to do to make that work. If that is really a valid share
on the network, you should be able to map it with the UNC name like that
directly.

Rich,

   Then you can appreciate my frustration; especially since this has been
working for years.

   The virtual win98 sees that there is a share called "winstuff" and it knows
it's supposed to be assigned to e:\. But, it cannot make the connection.
VMware's setup has the share enabled and mapped the same way.

Just to double check Rich, but can you do anything on the Windows 98 box 
that connects to your network(ie, can you surf the web)?

Something like this should do it:
-----begin---
#/usr/bin/perl
$max_num=300;

for($i=0; $i < $max_num; $i++){
     system("grepmail -hv \"\\[SPAM\\]\" /data4/mail/correspondance$i
> /data2/mail.back/$i");
}
----end---
The nested escape characters probably need tweaking, but that's the
general structure in perl.  For testing, replace the call to system
with a call to print, and use the same parameters (but add a \n to the
end of the string to make it easier to read).

As always, test thouroughly before using.

I have a recollection of a somewhat similar thing happening to me, once. At 
that time, I was trying to learn more about EMACS and discovered that it 
would let me change a name I couldn't work with directly in a terminal 
screen. I don't know if it will work on the permissions, but maybe that will 
spark another idea from someone.

Have you checked Network Neighborhood's properties? Either in Explorer or on 
the desktop, right click on Network Neighborhood, and click on Properties 
(bottom of the drop down). You'll get a Network properties pop up window with 
a list that, in my case, includes my ethernet adapter, and TCP/IP. Click on 
each of those and the Properties button becomes active. There's a bunch of 
stuff in there, but I don't know if it's the stuff you're looking for. On the 
other hand, I don't remember setting anything anywhere else.

Hope this helps.

ls -ld . shows:
drwxrwxrwx    2 user software     4096 Apr  7 11:13 ./

The files names are normal and across the board with different names.
Nothing odd about them to me.  The worst being some have underscores
in the names.

I think we will try the fsck this weekend. I'll let you all know what
happens. If you have other suggestions worth trying I'll give those a
shot this week but I and other seem to be at a lost.


thanks for all the tips.  I just don't know what happened in the move
from the odd machine to the new.  This all should have been routine
move.

No big deal there, then.

Yep, I think that's probably your best shot right now. If it were just
the permissions that were hosed, then they'd be easy to deal with.

But with some of them having messed up file types (with a '?' as the
first char in ls -l output), you're probably dealing with some
filesystem corruption.

: Thanks. I'll start putting that in scripts in the future.

I should probably have been more precise in my description of

trap "kill 0" 2

This "traps" <cntl>-C (SIGINT, i.e., signal 2) and tells bash to
instead issue "kill 0".

Since "kill 0" specifies no signal number, the signal defaults to
SIGTERM. And since the pid is 0, the signal is sent to all processes
in the current process group.

Many of my shell scripts spin off stuff in the background and make use
of the "wait" directive (I run a multiprocessor machine).  A lot of
these background processes are inside loops.  Basically the kill 0
says to kill everything that has been spun off by the script, as well
as the parent script.  So when I hit <cntl>-C it all dies.

In your situation the same idiom should also work even though your
script is not that complicated.

Since the bash manpage says that SIGINT is caught by default I (like
you) am actually at a loss to understand why your original script
doesn't die, though I've seen the same behaviour when I have something
like `convert' being executed w/in a loop.

Maybe someone with more knowledge will enlighten us.

I have a Sony Mavica MVC-CD200 digital camera which writes the pictures

Roxio would find the CD-ROM and I could copy the pictures off of the CD

Rich,

Can you ping the box that the share is on?

Is there a firewall or anything that's doing packet filtering between the
two boxes?

Can you do other things on the network from the Win98 install, like surf
the web?

Rich,

   Er, no. They're the same physical box. I don't know if there's a 'ping' in
win98. I used to be able to print from a win98 application and move files
back and forth between the two systems.

   Nope. That's another physical host.

   I do not have Internet Exploder installed (or visible, whichever came
first) because there are fewer than a handful of old, windows-only apps that
I need to occasionally access.

   Responding to you is so symmetrical!

Rich

Rich,

I'm guessing that you are using Samba to share out the files?  If that
is correct could you have changed Samba along the way?  Could you have
upgraded it and a default setting is now different?  It sounds like
maybe the problem is not win98 as you have not touched that in a long
time but on the share side of things.

You can test the connection by using nslookup, ping, ftp, telnet. 
They should all be on 98 somewhere.  You could also go download some
freeware ftp client like wsftp if you do not have one and try to ftp
to a server you know works somewhere.

Just more thoughts to help you out.  I've had a handful of windows to
samba server issues and almost all were because my samba server was
not configured correctly for the clients I wanted to use.

Josh

Josh, et al.:

   A fellow named Petr from the Czech Republic pointed me to the problem: when
I ran /usr/local/bin/vmware-config.pl after upgrading the kernel the last
time I managed to mangle the process and create host-only networking rather
than bridged networking. This exchange is on the vmware community forum for
workstation issues.

   I don't know the actual solution right now. I kept running the config
script but didn't give it the proper answers to get it straighted out.
Anywho, since version 5.0 came out a couple of days ago I ought to upgrade
before they raise the price again. Then I'll search for exactly what answers
I need to give the script in order to bridge bidirectionally between the host
and guest OS. I do this so infrequently that I forget the terminology and
just how to do it.

Thanks,

Rich

VMware by default uses an ethernet type of "bridged" which gets its
own IP address via whatever means is configured into the Win98 guest--
usually by DHCP.  If you use a VMware interface type of NAT, then the
host OS will be your default gateway within Win98.

So even though they're the same physical box, the ping test is still a
valid diagnostic.

Be careful making this assumption-- even though they are the same
physical host there is no guarantee that packets from the Win98 guest
OS make it to the linux host OS.

The local Linux packet filter is a very common source of problems with
VMware guest OS connections.  Again, the default is "bridged" so the
Win98 host will be trying to connect to SALMO via your normal ethernet
and will look like an external connection to Linux.

If you have a VMware virtual interface set up for "host only"
networking, then it will be communicating over a virtual interface. 
This also needs to be allowed through the local packet filter, which I
accomplish by allowing all traffic from the host OS interface "vmnet1"
through.

To diagnose this, enable logging on your packet filter.  If you see a
bunch of dropped packets from the Win98 guest OS IP, this is your
problem.

The article he writes is about "DPM", a disk-to-disk backup program
from Microsoft that will cost "only" $1000/node, when it comes out
of beta sometime around the year 2250.  Of course, it doesn't do
hard linking between images, and it does not use the efficient and
secure rsync/ssh data transfers, but it does accomplish three
signficant things:

1) It means that M$ will piss off another group of formerly loyal
co-dependent companies.  The "develop for the windows platform and
get eaten alive" message is being re-inforced, and there will be
more lawsuits against M$ and more fodder for the DOJ (when they are
liberated in 2009).

2) It means M$ will finally have to build file systems that can be
completely imaged while on-line.  This has been a problem with
dirvish/rsync when used on M$ NTFS file systems.

3) It means that M$ will develop the "self-destructing EULA."  Their
backup program will copy their own M$ DMCA-protected "intellectual
property" from the disk of a machine it is licensed for to the disk
of a machine that is not so licensed.  Think of the implications
of THAT - for them and for other proprietary software vendors. 
This removes one of the nagging legal risks of using a program
like dirvish to do the same thing.

Microsoft: when you get big enough, all that is left to eat is yourself.
Bon app?tit!

I'm confused. What's a 24-bit floating point number? IEEE defines a single
(32 bits) and a double (64 bits). It's somewhat vague about double-extended
but usually that's 80 bits.

The single I remember is 1 sign bit, 8 exponent bits, 23 explicit
significand (mantissa) bits with 1 implicit bit = 1 + 8 + 23 = 32.

Well my brain is too full this AM ( week actually ) to fully comprehend
your need but a quick search on CPAN for 24 bit got me several hits ( 
at least 60 ).

Pack and unpack may be usefully also.  Come to think of it you might look 
a sprintf though this seems a bit of a stretch.

Message-ID: <1113490870.425e85b66e890@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

Does freegeek or any of the other local Linux businesses 
have a certification discussion list?

A lot of people have talked about freegeek lately.

I went to http://www.freegeek.com/, but that could have been
a different site for all I know.  

I think the site was http://www.trainingcamp.com/, 
it's interesting but not too practical considering 
it offers nothing in Oregon.

I'd appreciate a plug list specifically for certification
training, perhaps a news group would be even better.  Just
out of curiosity, how many people have gotten their Linux
training in Oregon?  Of those, how many of you used training
materials and classes of some form or another verses
a completely self-taught approach?

Some of the links through freegeek.com discouraged me right
off the bat for the lack of information they offered to a
person shopping around.  I don't care for sites that say
they're great, but don't offer you anything to evaluate 
them by beyond fancy logos.  I wish some of these sites
would either give references or sample materials from 
their courses.

I've noticed a healthy thread on scripting recently.  Clearly,
some folks here know tricks that I don't ;-)  Is this book 
learned or is there an effective way to get a lot of this 
off of the Internet, etc.?


The CompTIA Linux+ test didn't look too expensive on one site,
but I couldn't tell if that site was selling software to administer
the test or access to a testing center.  From the standpoint of
learning about certification, I figure if the test can be bought
that it may be useful to look at it in order to find out what I 
need to know.  Thing is, I worry with this approach how fast 
things are changing.

Honestly, I wish the offerings through PCC were more serious than
the two Linux courses and a Perl course I've taken through there.
It seems you can get enough to go through Miscosoft certification
at PCC.  Sadly, I don't see enough offered to study for a Linux 
certification class wise.  Is Ed Sawicki offerering any Oregon
based training options now?  The Perl class was pathetically
short at just three weeks long.  One of the things I want
training in is apache's configuration syntax and module 
architecture.  I also want to learn more about Postfix and 
system auditing techniques.  I want to be able to read and
write init and rc scripts.  I also want to be able to write
daemons instead of scheduling certain scripts over intervals 
via cron.

Moving everything to a centralised server in the long run doesn't make
it any easier to keep a computer clean of viruses and malware.  One of 
the downsides of centralized computing infrastructure is that hackers
have a single target.  Plus, despite the explosion of special purpose
devices, how many of these limited devices are cheaper than the their
more capable cousins?  What might happen is that our inexpensive but 
headache causing general purpose computers may dissapear and be
replaced by over priced, proprietary, limited purpose alternatives.
I would like to see a remodeling of the general purpose computer
concept instead of an abandoning of it altogether.  It's frustrating
that laptops for example use totally different parts from
their desktop cousins and are rarely compatible with a broad enough
software base.  A computer design and manufacture operation that
designs laptops, desktops, and servers which are cuttng edge but
equally software compatible will do well.  I for one would
like to see a laptop that you can detach the screen from for use 
with your desktop computer competitively priced with other laptops
that are currently on the market.  A lot would be accomplished by 
reducing the port types on the PC to say one high performance serial 
bus and one high performance bus for hard disks, etc.  Imagine usb 
being made completely Linux friendly and fast enough to handle 
streaming video.  The PC would get new life if it were designed
better and made more OSS friendly.  High price, limitied capability,
is not where I want to see computer technology heading to.  General
purpose hardware that's a pleasure to work with is what's needed.
Not expensive, overly restrictive, over priced, special purpose 
devices.  With a proper overhaul, personal computers can stay 
viable indefinitely.

If proprietary is the future, Linux might die.  If all the alternatives
to Microsoft crumble, it's possible that noone will be able to afford 
a computer anymore.

A good indicator that you shouldn't be using system() for this.  If you 
need to capture the output or use a pipe/redirect on anything involving 
filenames, you would be much better served with IPC::Run.

They do have a list, but it's specifically for people who are studying to
take the LPI tests through them. It's not a general list for discussing
certifications other than LPI.

Well, again, that's the wrong site. However, I don't think there is a lot
of detailed info on the right one about the LPI certification. This isn't
really a service they are selling. They are a non-profit, and they are
offering the tests at a discount as a service to the community. There is
not a training course associated with the testing at this point, AFAIK,
although I think I remember them saying they are considering offering some
in the future.

There have been several posts about their LPI testing on this list in the
past, you might search the archive.

Pete,

Try unpacking it into 4 bytes with zero in the least significant byte.

You then should be able to have it processed as a normal FP number.

  00 40 40  =   3.0
  00 60 40  =   3.5

Flipping the byte order around is easy, but the unpacking is driving me
nuts. Or can it all be done with unpack ?

I gather when LUGs in other parts have discussed certification, they've
set up a study group of some sort. They start with the published
requirements, and review them, often with the help of one or more books.
Perhaps if there are enough who are interested, we could set something
up with respect to the LPI, Linux+, and or the RHCT/E exams. 

Thanks,
Mike

There have been study groups for the LPI at Free Geek.

I need to get a dial-up connection established to an ISP.

Any good documentation/scripts, etc out there?

I'll be using a USR Courier  V-90 datacenter-class modem connected to a
serial port.

The system is currently running RedHat-9.

Hi Chaz,

I haven't had to dial up for a while, but when I did last I used KPPP. I
had good results with it, and it's pretty easy to configure.

Chaz,

   Have you looked in /usr/doc/Linux-HOWTO/modem-HOWTO and similar references?

Have not read that one yet.  I'll take a look at it.
I've been able to talk to the modem via minicom, so I know the serial
connection is working.

Hi Charles-

If you're looking for console based, I've used the pppconfig package
for debian. It's easy and quick  I'm sure there's an rpm out there for
that.  Otherwise wvdial is pretty idiot proof, especially for
autodetecting modems.

I just moved my last dial-up customer on to DSL so I'm moving all that
info out of main memory ... :-)  but most distributions provide a very
simple dial-up configuration setup.  The dial-on-demand is trickier.  For
years I used diald ( 0.16-5 I think ) and it worked quite well.  Probably
far more power than most users need but it was solid.  Then it finally
made version 1.0 but many things changed causing my other setups to break.  
I stopped using it.  I personally went to a hardware firewall with a
serial port that I connected to my whole home network. This is one option.

A variation on this is a smoothwall box with a modem connected or inside.  
I am working on doing this for fun and one user at our local user group ( 
not PLUG ) is doing to do the same.  Not sure how/if it handles 
dial-on-demand.

With all that said I'll point out that my "last dial-up customer" didn't
do dial-on-demand.  He had the modem tool/applet on his taskbar and would
connect and disconnect manually.

If you can share what distribution you're using we might be able to get 
you headed in the right direction.

Subject: [PLUG] Email server performance
Message-ID: <7cbc132f0504151059477abb8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All, I am having some email server performance issues. Users report
that the performance is horribly slow. I have witnessed this poor
performance. It is only horribly slow during business hours, when
everyone is using it. There are about 180 users who mostly use imap to
access email. The machine seems to have plenty of processing power, 4
Zeons and 4 gigs of ram. I wrote a script to collect some data every
hour. The script collects output from top, vmstat and ps. I noticed
from the vmstat output that there seems to be a lot of disk io, but it
does not appear to be due to swapping. Here is some output from
vmstat:

procs                      memory      swap          io     system      cpu
r  b  w   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in    cs us sy id

Any ideas of how I could address the performance problems? Should I
switch the users to pop3? Put a cap on mailbox size? Any help is
appreciated.

You have absolutely no swap activity during the time slots shown above. 
What kind of disk farm is on this box?  What other services does it supply besides
mail?  Have other disk use monitoring have you done?

Chaz,

   Have you looked in /usr/doc/Linux-HOWTO/modem-HOWTO and similar

Add more disks, get faster disks, or move the filesystems around to
distribute the load.  What is your storage subsystem like now?  I would
definitely recommend against switching them to POP3 if you're using
IMAP.  What IMAP server are you using?  Is this 180 concurrent users?

I'll second the wvdial recommendation. It's very easy to use, and
worked on every Linux system I've tried it on regardless of

There seems to be a heck of a lot of spam activity and related smtp
activity out there in recent weeks.  Perhaps some group has launched
an email DOS attack on the planet.  My mail logs are 40 times longer 
than they were in September.  In fact, yesterday they filled /var/log
and I spent hours checking for a system break-in before deciding it
was just spam volume, exacerbated by all those "low memory in /var/log"
messages filling /var/log/messages.

Look at the length of your mail logs, and compare them to the sizes
in the backups back when things were "OK".   If they are much bigger,
you may want to talk to consultant Brian Martin about setting up
greylisting, or consultant Randal Schwartz about filtering ports.

General question for others:  Does logging get slower as the files
get bigger?  Does IMAP access also touch the mail logs?

Imap access does touch the maillogs and the size of the logs does not
appear to have an effect of performance. This machine is the incoming
and outgoing mailserver as well as the mailhost, where user mailboxes
reside and are accessed via pop and imap. We also have spamassassin
running. Each uses account is configured to run all incoming mail
through spamd. I am seeing several spamd processes that have resident
size of 12-18mb. Could this be causing all the IO? I think the max
email size is currently set to something huge like 25mb or so.

I don't think it's that tricky nowadays. I mentioned KPPP, it has the
ability to make a PPP connection persistent, and I'd be surprised if most
of the other GUI tools don't offer that as well.

Using command line scripts and tools like diald used to be the norm, but I
don't think they're required for the average user nowadays who is running
X. You can write chat scripts if you want :) but people really shouldn't
have to do that at this point in time.

Hi Chaz,

You should be able to find HOWTOs at:

http://www.tldp.org/

Or by Googling. They should be pretty easy to track down that way, as a
lot of people link to them.

Oh, I think I just figured this out. I'll bet the autowhitelist
database has grown to be so huge that it is bogging down spamd. This
would be the cause of all the IO, when spamd reads and writes to the
autowhitelist db.

Do you have an idea of your spam rate?  And in the "I'm an idiot"
department, you may recall that I've posted before on the ill-effects
of virus checking on incoming emails.  

This would be easy to verify.  Run top, wait for the system to slow
down and see if spamd is a frequent entry in the Top 5 list of 
active processes.  That certainly was the case when my system would
slow to a crawl.  

You didn't mention your mail server, sendmail or postfix? In either case
if this line of reasoning is correct you need to enable whichever to 
recognize legitimate addresses on your system and reject mail for 
accounts that don't exist.  

If you're running postfix I can also provide a half baked utility to 
munge iptables when a spammer tries to send email to randomly made 
up addresses at your company.

Can you remind me (us?) of that discussion. I've configured the mail 
servers at home and work to scan for inbound virii -- though it's during 
the SMTP transaction, via sendmail's milter interface, not after receipt.

At the time I was silently dropping, neither bouncing or rejecting, the 
email.  Cooley reminded me that such behavior was unbecoming of a mail
administrator.  His reminder motivated me to clean up my act.  

My comment at the time revovled around the overhead of processing 30,000
spams a day destined for addresses that didn't exist in my systems.  And 
patch.com et.al. are a pretty small group of systems, email list host or
not. 

The spam and virus checking took place before the address checking.

Or *cough*me*cough* about a Mail Defender setup or Cyrus IMAP :)

No, logging is an append operation, which is independent of the file
size.  It depends on which IMAP server you're talking about--all of
course will log at least connections, but unless they're logging in
debug mode they shouldn't generally write nearly as many logs as the MTA
or a scanner.  That said, IMAP does record lots of other information,
such as message flags (seen and whatnot).

At my last job, we had a problem with performance using UW IMAPd and
mbox files.  What was happening was that several users would let their
inboxes get big (tens of megabytes).  Then their mail client would
trigger a scan through the entire mbox file whenever it did a
mail-check, typically every 5 minutes.  This killed memory, disk,
network and CPU.

I think we started by encouraging users with big mailboxes to trim
them down, then we moved to a better IMAP server, which helped a lot.
I don't think we had to switch to maildir.

Maildir *can*  be faster, but it all depends on how efficiently the IMAP 
server indexes folders. A bad indexing implementation can lead to lots 
of unwanted stat()s, open()s, and read()s.

Ick.  I'd strongly suggest moving to something a bit more modern and 
powerful.  I like dovecot, myself, but I don't really know if mbox 
support is there or not (I moved to Maildir quite some time back).

I understand certain mail cients actually trigger UW-imapd to scan a 
user's entire home directory recursively looking for mbox files.  When I 
spoke with the SquirrelMail developers a few years back about sluggish 
performance, as soon as I mentioned I was using UW-imapd I was presented 
with a whole big long list of ugly problems with that imap server.

Just my two cents....

Ouch.  That's a setup I wouldn't wish on anybody--no wonder your
hardware seemed like overkill.  I would recommend investigating Dovecot
or Cyrus.  I'm going to be talking about Cyrus this Wednesday at the
Advanced Topics meeting; are you the guy in Idaho?  (That reminds me, I
need to bug Alan to update the announcement.)  With either Dovecot
(using Maildir) or Cyrus, messages are stored in individual files,
instead of one file per-mailbox (Cyrus doesn't use Maildir, though).
Large single-file mailboxes are frightful for memory consumption.  Cyrus
maintains a database of headers, which keeps the open-files down, which
can be a problem with Maildir as Paul mentioned.  Cyrus also has a few
nice features you won't get with the others:
  o Indexed server-side searches, which makes searching even large 
    mailboxes really fast.
  o Shared mailboxes, which have a number of uses.
  o Server-side filtering with Sieve.  Easier to mere mortals to deal 
    with and there are several nice web-based apps to managing the 
    filters.
  o Good support for off-line/cached mode with clients; I'm not sure 
    how well UW or Dovecot handle these.
  o Single-instance store (a message delivered to a dozen people only 
    requires one file with hard-links; can be a big savings with disk 
    space and disk I/O, especially if people like to send around large 
    documents and such).
  o Duplicate suppression (you only receive one copy of message).
  o Real quotas; users can be warned when they're approaching their 
    quota.
  o Forced server-side message expiration.
  o Native SSL support (Dovecot probably has this; AFAIK you have to  
    use 'stunnel' to do IMAPS with UW).
  o Multiple "partitions" for mail stores.  Add a couple drives, change 
    some configuration settings, and new mailboxes are created there.  
    It's nice not only for adding capacity but also to load-management.

The downsides to Cyrus are:
  o Migration from mbox can be a bitch.  It's been a long time since 
    I've done a migration and there are some tools now that might make 
    it easier.  It's been on my to-research list for a while.
  o Procmail for filtering is discouraged.  Procmail has a number of 
    problems anyway:
    * Less efficient than Sieve, due to forking and all that.
    * Incomprehensible to most people.
    * Can lose mail if it gets in a bind.  (Sieve will just deliver to 
      the INBOX if it gets into problems.)
  o Can be more work to manage.  You have to manually create users' 
    mailboxes (just their INBOX; they can then create their own 
    subfolders).  Managing the ACLs, quotas, and whatnot is generally 
    done with a command-line tool which can be hard to understand.  
    There's a nice Webmin module that I like, called "IMAP Admin."
  o Database problems have been problems in the past (mainly due to 
    deficiencies of the Berkeley DB), but thanks to the integrated 
    "Skiplist" and prevalence of BDB4, those have mostly gone away.
  o Authentication has been difficult in the past.  The addition of 
    'saslauthd' to Cyrus-SASL has eased that considerably.
  o The docs kinda suck.  I've been working on updating the Cyrus IMAP 
    HOWTO (http://nakedape.cc/info/Cyrus-IMAP-HOWTO/), but it's been  
    going slowly.  O'Reilly published a book called "Managing IMAP" a 
    few years ago that covered Cyrus, but it's horribly out of date 
    now.  My Advanced Topics talk is a preparation for the presentation 
    I'm doing at Linuxfest Northwest 
    (http://lfnw.blug.org/fest2005/event.dxp?id=47).  I intend to do a 
    bit of work on the HOWTO in preparation.

Here's some information about the setup OSU uses:

I'm not really sure that the server is the real issue when it comes to 
off-line support; most of the heavy lifting is done by the client. 
Thunderbird works well in off-line mode with either UW or Dovecot.

Dovecot supports linking against either OpenSSL or GNUTLS.

UW IMAP and POP daemons will readily link against OpenSSL -- no stunnel 
required. In fact, I'll go further and say that setting up UW IMAP/POP 
with SSL is almost trivially easy:

1. Build binaries against OpenSSL (which is the default in Red Hat,
    Fedora, and CentOS).

2. Put $SSLDIR/certs/imapd.pem and/or $SSLDIR/certs/ipop3d.pem into
    place (either as real files or, more likely, as symlinks).

3. Make sure that inetd or xinetd is prepared to listen to ports 993
    and/or 995.

Voila! No other configuration is necessary. At work, we've turned off 
ports 110 and 143; only the SSL ports are listening.

Mozilla mail, mostly.  But with UW-imapd, it could be any client; IIRC
it scans the whole dang file whenever you do a newmail.   Oh, and I
was wrong, it doesn't kill the network, just the other three.

You might take a look at this:
http://www.squirrelmail.org/wiki/en_US/FolderListWithUW
Like lots of docs, though, it advocates replacing mbox with maildir,
which may or may not give you the performance gain you're seeking
(depending on the filesystem) but would be disruptive to users.

Dovecot works with maildir or mbox format, and it keeps indexes so it
doesn't have to rescan big mail folders.  I'd recommend swapping it in
instead of UW-imapd.  (Try it on a testbed first, of course.)

Subject: [PLUG] Debian and LDAP auth
Message-ID: <42632A65.8000505@madboa.com>

I'm trying to migrate my home network to authenticate against an LDAP 
server. My CentOS box doesn't have any trouble.

My Debian host, however, is hit-and-miss. Some things -- like "getent 
passwd," logging in using an SSH public key, and various stat() 
operations -- work as they should. Others, notably password checking, don't.

For now, I've had to recreate the local /etc/{passwd,shadow} entries so 
that people can login with passwords.

I've Googled various sites, tried umpteen combinations of edits to 
/etc/libnss-ldap.conf and the various /etc/pam.d/common-* files, and 
even rebooted just for kicks -- nothing worked.

The Debian client seems to be asking the right questions of the LDAP 
server (openldap 2.1.30, hosted on a Gentoo box):

   Apr 17 20:27:42 xxx slapd[29383]: conn=80 op=4 SRCH
   base="ou=accounts,dc=xxx,dc=xxx" scope=2
   filter="(&(objectClass=shadowAccount)(uid=heinlein))"

   Apr 17 20:27:42 xxx slapd[29383]: conn=80 op=4 SRCH attr=uid
   userPassword shadowLastChange shadowMax shadowMin shadowWarning
   shadowInactive shadowExpire shadowFlag

   Apr 17 20:27:42 irvine slapd[29383]: conn=80 op=4 SEARCH RESULT
   tag=101 err=0 nentries=1 text=

The passwords are stored in SSHA format in the userPassword field. 
Anyone got a clue stick they can aim at my head? :-)

Paul,

   I suspected this to be the answer, but I wanted to check first anyway.

   Here's the scenario: my web site is now built using css and xhtml. I plan
on updating individual pages more frequently than in the past, and adding
pages as appropriate.

   Each page has three static components: the header, footer and menu. (Well,
the menu could change, too, but that would need to be reflected in all pages,
anyway.) Each of these sections is in a separate css division (masthead,
footer, and navlist).

   I would like to extract each division into a separate .html file, change
the extensions of the content files to .shtml, and use <!--#include
virtual="/xxxx.html" --> to include each of the three constant components.

   This is what I did with my former, very crude html-4 and tables site. Does
it work the same way with css?

   I know that apache at my ISP provides server side includes for doing this,
but I don't know if the same file structure I used before works with
divisions in a css file.

Thanks,

Rich

It shouldn't be a problem. My understanding is that the process will 
roughly be like this:

1. Apache parses the .shtml files and assembles them into one unified
    document.

2. The unified xhtml file is sent off to the client.

3. The client parses the main xhtml file and asks for any supporting
    files: images, external CSS stylesheets, etc.

4. The client renders the complete document, CSS and all...

I have seen discussions of diskless workstations for
both Linux and BSD, so that concept, at least, does
not threaten open-source. I am not too familiar with
the full range of applications, however.

Subject: [PLUG] multiple ssl domains on apache
Message-ID: <20050418164255.19658.qmail@web52901.mail.yahoo.com>

I would think this would be a fairly common question,
but much Googling has turned up nothing: How does one
install multiple SSL certs for multiple domains
pointing to the same directory on the same server? 

I use mod_rewrite to point multiple domain names to
the same directory like so:
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} www.example1.com [NC]
RewriteRule .* - [L]

RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} www.example2.com [NC]
RewriteRule .* - [L]

Right now I have an SSL certificate installed for
www.example1.com, and I want to install one on
www.example2.com but can't find documentation on how
to go about it.

Thanks in advance,
Jim

You can only have one valid SSL certificate per IP address. You can have 
Apache run multiple SSL-enabled servers at the same time, but each one 
needs its own address.

The reason is that SSL certificates are tied to a single hostname (CN, 
in x509-ese) and DNS resolution happens prior to and separate from the 
SSL handshaking.

Paul,

   Good. Then the same overall file structure should work for the new site as
well as it did with the old. Many thanks. I'll give it a whirl later this
week.

Unless something has changed in the last year, this isn't possible. You 
have to have a seperate IP for each cert.

Heh.

Unix and Linux have supported diskless workstations for a little
while now.  Like, 20 years.  The X Window system is a remote
thin-client protocol; folks only started running their X terminals and
their programs on the same machine when PCs got powerful enough.

That's right, CSS is client-side, whereas SSI is "server-side".  The
client will not know that your menu/nav content lives in separate files;
so regarding CSS, just think in terms of the atomic pages, not the file
particles they include.

Can someone suggest a good program that a user can download and use
offline to test single cleartext passwords for entropy and security? 

I would like something that ran from the command line under Linux/Unix
and emitted a numeric score;  it would be helpful if there were also
GUI versions for M$ and Mac.  A dictionary < 50MB would make the 
download easier to justify.

I don't want to get into a religious debate about methods for password
selection, and I realize that the cracker with the best dictionary wins.
Still, some guidance from a program on the user's machine, before they
are challenged with choosing a password out there on the web, would
prevent some percentage of poorly thought out responses.

I don't think he's asking about multiple virtual HTTPS servers (which
can't be done, as you've pointed out; HTTPS requires a unique IP per
certificate).

I think the solution is as simple as setting the DocumentRoot to the
same place for both HTTPS servers. No rewriting required. 

Or maybe I'm the one who is missing the question?

Keith,

While this isn't exactly what you requested, IMO it's worth considering.
I've integrated pam_passwdqc into the distribution my employer produces.
While it does use an extremely modest dictionary (around 4100 words),
its strength is more focused on being able to stipulate requirements for
a mix of character classes. That approach is much more resistant to
dictionary attacks. It's fairly simple to create a simple c program to
use passwdqc outside of PAM (I've done so) for the purpose of
pre-validating passwords (see the INTERNALS file in the package)...

http://www.openwall.com/passwdqc/

hth,
Sandy

Well, we ran fsck on the drives and were told these files were goofed
and do we want to fix them.  Said yes and ran through this for hours. 
but afterwards we were able to delete the files.

Just a solution we found that worked but still confused as to what
caused the problem.

  It should work the same way. Apache preprocesses the include before it 
gets sent to the visitor's user agent ( which is where the page gets

By both HTTPS servers, do you mean having two
instances of Apache, each attached to different IPs
but pointed to the same doc root?


Thank you all for your responses.

One instance of apache can listen on any list of IPs you give it.

Here's some info from one of my servers:

hive:~# netstat -tanp | grep apache
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80              0.0.0.0:* LISTEN     20241/apache
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:443             0.0.0.0:* LISTEN     20241/apache

Note that the same apache process is listening on all IPs for both HTTP
and HTTPS. This server has 2 NICs handling 6 IPs.

   Thanks, Doug. I've not dissected the process; that gets rather messy and
it's difficult to dispose of all the pieces. But, ... come to think of it,
the browser as a rendering plant is a good analogy. There's a lot of fat to
be converted into something useful

I hear you, but if it's that easy then why would he be rewriting the HTTP
traffic? It would be pretty simple to point multiple sites to the same
document root for HTTP, too. I wonder if there's something more complex
going on that is not clear from the original message.

Yes, I was simplifying the setup. Basically we host
hundreds of sites on this server all on the same IP,
and we use mod_rewrite to say, "if you requested
example1.com or example2.com, use the doc root, else
use the directory named for this alternate domain that
you requested." Only the example1.com and example2.com
domains will need SSL so that's why I left the rest of
it out of the initial question. 

Either way, it looks like I'll need separate IPs for
example1.com and example2.com. I thought that might be
the case but was avoiding it to try to keep the
network as simple as possible.

Message-ID: <20050418190851.0e08cffc.jason@vancleve.com>

Hi,

I'm in some rough waters here, try to get a Dell 1350 Mini-PCI WIFI card
(Broadcom chips) working in my Gentoo/Dell Inspiron 5100.  I'm using
ndiswrapper to run the WindoseXP driver, and that seems to be working. 
The card works in Windows, BTW, and I can see two strong APs in that
interface.

In linux, I can load the driver module, see the device, no errors in the
syslog, and I can bring up the device with ifconfig.  I've also
installed wireless-tools, which is evidently required for any sort of
success at all.  So I can configure the WIFI card, fiddle with it as
needed, and everything looks good, except that I can't see those two
APs.  My output is as follows:

My lord? iwlist scan
lo        Interface doesn't support scanning.

eth0      Interface doesn't support scanning.

wlan0     No scan results

So I'm not seeing any APs under linux, even though we have one running
right here in the office.  I'm missing something here, but it seems
linux WIFI is still quite bleeding-edge, and documentation is scattered
and often outdated.

So, can anyone suggest my next step?  TIA!

Quoth myself, on Mon, 18 Apr 2005 19:08:51 -0700:

At home now, I have managed to get this working with my own Linksys WiFi
router, somehow.  Where were the two APs at work is still a heavy
mystery (since I need this for work mainly), but I see three of them
here, so maybe I've got this after down all, and there's something
skwewy goin' on at work.  Dunno.  I will say that if I'd tried this at
home in the first place, I'd have found the gentoo configuration much
easier than Windoz.  It might have gone:

1. Find Uber's gentoo wifi guide sooner than I did:
   http://dev.gentoo.org/~uberlord/net-book/hb_part1_chap4.html

2. emerge ndiswrapper and know which .inf file from the driver CD to
pass it, by some divine intuition.  As it was, there were four different
.inf's that all looked right.  I grepped all through that CD looking for
clues, and in the end, I picked the largest file and held my breath.

3. Add ndiswrapper to my boot modules and update-modules.

4. emerge wireless-tools, then use iwconfig to set my wifi channel,
ipconfig to bring it up, and dhcpcd to initialize.

I'd describe my WinXPerience, but I'm not much of a humorist.

One possibility... I don't remember the exact term, but many of the
wireless access points I've seen have a security feature that makes them
invisible to a name scan.  You have to "know" that the access point is
there.

That is typically not set by default when you purchase it, but it might
be set that way on your work access points.

It did show up in the scan interface in XP, however, at work.  One thing
I had to do to connect was specify the MAC address somewhere in the
bowels of the Network Connections interface.  But I didn't see any
access points in linux.

I'm told Windoesn't know how to get the MAC address from the device, but
that seems odd.  Would linux know that, using the same driver, or is
there a way to specify the local MAC address?

Thanks Galen.  I had run into a similar situation when I burned an iso
image at work ( much more bandwidth ) then created an iso from the CD (
cheap trick I picked up somewhere: 'cat /dev/cdrom > cdrom.iso' ). The two
were different sizes but worked fine.

One switch I haven't try yet.  I'll give it the a try today.

I used to have this problem w/ RedHat ISO's and discovered adding "-dao"
to the cdrecord command line would solve the problem.  (Drives used are a
Sony CRX140E and a TDK [don't recall model].)

I have a Dell Inspiron 5150 with the Dell TrueMobile 1300 mini-PCI card for 
WIFI. It was early last year  when I put Linux on this laptop. I paid $19.95 
for the LinuxAnt frame to use the Broadcom drivers from Windows to drive the 
thing. My laptop has the P4 with the Hyperthreading and so SuSE 9.0 at the 
time used an SMP-enabled kernel on my laptop. At the time I did the install I 
was informed that the "ndiswrapper" didn't handle SMP kernels so I went with 
LinuxAnt. 

Since I payed  the money for the LinuxAnt framework I continue to use it to 
this day. Later versions are run as an "init" service and so it's nice that 
the framework recompiles itself to work after I upgrade my kernel. I admit it 
was a real pain everytime SuSE released a kernel upgrade as I had to go 
through a manual process to rebuild the LinuxAnt framework to work with the 
new kernel.

With the "wpa_supplicant" daemon running as well I'm able to make my WIFI 
network more secure by not using WEP. I have several Linksys WAP54G that 
support WPA. The "wpa_supplicant" daemon works with my APs using either TKIP 
or AES encryption.

Well, mod_xslt works reasonably well as long as you don't have a huge 
stylesheet (e.g., Norm Walsh's DocBook stylesheet).

You can also roll your own translation CGIs using Perl or PHP -- or 
using a more structured solution like AxKit: http://axkit.org/.

Message-ID: <20050420012125.81504.qmail@web60808.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

Can anyone recommend pointers on getting unicode characters to display
correctly in vim on FC2?  Some of the stuff I work with has Chinese,
Hebrew, and other stuff all mixed together but so far, I've not had any
luck getting things to work right.  I compiled vim with:

  ./configure --enable-gui=auto --with-features=big

That appears to be the correct option to get unicode to work, but I'm
at a loss on how to proceed.  Heck, just getting a decent unicode aware
terminal would be nice (or understanding how my configuration is wrong,
if that's it)

I know unicode support is available as I can get it under xterm:

  LC_CTYPE=en_GB.UTF-8 xterm \
    -fn
'-Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-SemiCondensed--13-120-75-75-C-60-ISO10646-1'

But my vim still doesn't display the characters correctly, though "cat"
will.  I have multibyte support compiled in vim.

Cheers,
Ovid

   No.

   But, I just got Hebrew working in OpenOffice.org-1.1.4. A nice selection of
fonts from a sourceforge site, changes to the Xkb... in /etc/X11/xorg.conf,
install the fonts in OO.o and away we go. Alt-shift switches between English
and Hebrew keyboard layouts; a picture of the Hebrew keyboard came from a web
site.

What is the best Linux client to copy audio tapes to
CD? Actually, copying the audio tape to file(s) would
suffice, of course.

If the "best" application is an expensive proprietary
one, I would also like to know what the best
open-source application is.

When I asked a variant of this question (I was copying vinyl LPs) a
few months ago, the answer was Audacity, which is what I ended up
using.  It seemed to work fine.  Best, I don't know, but adequate and
I didn't try anything better (I didn't trying anything else at all!).

Message-ID: <86k6my2ast.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


I helped a neighbor recover some files from a w2k dell laptop (800MHz
P3 era) this evening and had some strange experiences.  His windows
behavior was perpetual blue screen followed by reboot followed by blue
screen, etc.  Under knoppix (3.7), I could not get X11 to fully load,
it would freeze on a splash screen, so I eventually punted back to a
tty (runlevel 2) boot.  I also tried a Ubuntu live-CD (not the newest
one) with similar results.  Whenever I tried to rsync or cp -a files
from the hard disk, the kernel panic'd.  This occured with both kernel
2.4 and 2.6.  It occurred both when I was rsyncing across the network
and when I was writing to a jumpdrive.  If it was only the hard disk
that was faulty, I would have expected to just get I/O errors, not a
panic.  I was able to copy several individual files successfully.

He had called Dell today, and they talked him through a partial
disassembly, and a windows tech guy came by and didn't have an answer
either.

Does this sound like just a bum disk to you?  Or something more
serious?  

I probably should have run memtest86 while I was there, but he was
more interested in recovering the files he had worked on since his
last backup (luckily he had incrementals up to just under a day ago)
than in diagnosing what went wrong.

I've been happy with the results I get from Gramofile. I mostly record LP's, 
but I have done some cassettes, too. Actually, the audio source doesn't 
really matter all that much once it's plugged into the sound card's input 
jack.

Well, I can't tell about the rest of it, but Knoppix not booting is not, by 
itself, any indicator of hardware problems. I just downloaded 3.8.1 and it 
just won't boot on my HP Pavilion ZD7058CL laptop. In fact, no version has 
since 2.x (can't remember). I would love to have something that I could boot 
on this laptop, but I haven't found anything in a live CD (including Mandrake 
Move) that works well other than that old version of Knoppix, which I seem to 
have tossed. Sigh.

I have a Qwest Action-tec DSL box, a Cisco BEFSR41 Cable/DSL router with 4 
ports, and this Linux box (Mandrake 10) plus two W2K boxen all live behind 
that. 

I use a program called 'putty' from either of the Win boxen to pull files from 
the Linux box. However, just today this stopped working, and the command line 
box from the Win-boxen say "No route to host."

WEIRD CLUE: The Win-boxen can see each other BUT they cannot see the Internet. 
(The Linux box can see the internet, but we knew that already.)

Any hints on where to begin to fix this? Has something changed at the router 
or the DSL box?

Also, I have an external USB hard drive. If I plug it in to the USB port on 
the Linux box, I get a nice icon which pops up on my desktop, called 
"/mnt/removable" but the directory is empty, and if I try to mount from root 
(# prompt) it says 'permission denied.' [SO close - but yet SO far ...]

What should I do on the L-box to access that drive?

if you do an "ipconfig /all" on the windows boxes is the default gateway
correct?

Thank you for the hint.

Answer: No, they don't seem to list a default gateway.

Thanks to all for the great feedback regarding the issues we were
having. There were a dozon or so users with gigantic mailboxes (687mb
was the largest).  Once we got them down to a reasonable size, the
disk IO dropped dramatically and performance seems to be fine.

You might check out GNU shred.  I recall long ago Wil Cooley told me

Package: wipe
Description: Secure file deletion
 Recovery of supposedly erased data from magnetic media is easier than
 what many people would like to believe. A technique called Magnetic
 Force Microscopy (MFM) allows any moderately funded opponent to
 recover the last two or three layers of data written to disk. Wipe
 repeatedly writes special patterns to the files to be destroyed,
 using the fsync() call and/or the O_SYNC bit to force disk access.

I've used it in the past. I can only assume it worked, since I don't
really have the means of performing any real forensic analysis of a
drive.

Thank you, gentlemen. This should give me enough to work with.

The boot and nuke solution sounds like it assumes a working machine. In my 
case, I'm going to be wiping a pair of drives on a non-working machine. I'll 
have to install them in a working machine, first. I've got an unused disk 
drawer, and another used machine from my sister that I'm getting ready to 
install SuSE 9.2 on. I'll probably be able to set it up with the drawer. 
Might end up using the old drives for HD backups or something.

Yep, this works great and doesn't suffer from the achilles heel of
file-based wiping: the filesystem can lie to you.  I don't think ext2
works this way, but some filesystems will reallocate data blocks on
the fly to reduce fragmentation and mark the de-allocated blocks free
but leave the data intact.  These can be recovered trivially.

Boot n Nuke hits the whole raw device so the only data it won't touch
would be from the internal remapping of bad disk sectors.  However, if
you have a severe need for security, converting the whole hard drive
to gases remains your best option.  ;-)

I was assuming the tool would ignore the filesystem and just write patterns on 
the platters. Because of that, I didn't mention that the HD's are from 
Windows machines - one formatted during the installation of Win 2000, and the 
other with Win 98. I'm still assuming that won't matter.

As I recall, FreeGeek wipes every disk it gets. Anyone on the list know what 
they use?

I think they use badblocks -w, which has the additional benefit of
verifying that the media's OK.

Thanks. That's another one for me to check out.

As someone once said, "The great thing about standards is that there are so 
many to choose from." But in this case, each may have a strength the other 
lacks, and I can choose the one that best meets my need.

Dick,

    Doesn't matter. The linux kernel and boot loader are installed on the
floppy/cd-r so it doesn't see any OS on the hard drive.

Nothing is wholly reliable aside from physical destruction of the media
(and even that may be subject to just how much money someone would want
to spend trying to put the pieces back together).

I'm much less of an absolutist these days; partial protection is better
than none, as long as you are aware of the shortcomings.  (An attitude
I've developed after many years of reading inane responses to "Ask
Slashdot" questions.)  A software wipe is good enough for the DoD in all
but the most classified cases; it's good enough for HIPAA or Sarbanes-
Oxley and therefore it's probably good enough to wipe your own personal
data, even if it's full of your own financial and medical records.

Hmm, most platters are made of aluminum...

Aluminum melts at ~660 degrees F.

I know I've melted aluminum pans on a stove....

I think that would pretty much negate reassembly, and it's not that 
expensive... :)

Of course, I have no idea what the platter coating would emit while the 
aluminum was melting.

Message-ID: <NAEMLOHDCGGNKGMHCPFGOEPDCCAA.jimwebb@charter.net>

I just had a problem with one of my linux boxes.  I runs RH 8.  The HD was
making some noise, I think it was the HD, and I turned off the bpx.  Now it
won't boot up.  When I push the on button, the power light flashes green and
nothing else is happening.

None bios post or any fans turning.  Not even the power supply.  My brain is
a little frazzled with packing for a trip, etc and I can't think this
through right now, but what do I need to troubleshoot???

Thanks for your help,

Jim

I happened to have a sparee power supply handy, swapped them, and voila I'm

Thanks for your assistance.  I knew that I could count on Rich for help and

Hell, Russ, you're getting soft in your dotage.

Don't let a small bit of noxious gas get in the way of enlightenment. Crank up 
that oven to CLEAN and pop that little sucker in there to just see what 
happens.

Best do it when the wife's not home, if ya know what I mean. Just make sure 
you've got all the doors and windows open.

Say!

Tomorrow's supposed to be a nice day! Why don't you stay home from work and 
see if you can discover the correct methodology to perform the ultimate data 
destruction possible. 

Helping,
-Ron

PS. If you have a spare oven in the garage, you might want to try it with that 
one first.

PPS, Don't forget to holler those immortal words: "Hey, Y'all, Watch This!"

I've always used /dev/urandom, myself... I would think random data being 
written all over the disk would be more effective than zeros.

I did, some time ago, want to create a /dev/one so I could do a 
/dev/zero, /dev/one, then /dev/urandom a few times to shake things up, 
but never got it off the ground (I think it was before I left for BMT) 
and haven't gotten interested in it since.  :-)

Your DHCP server has died.  The Winblows boxes makeup their own

FWIW, I once had a bad hard drive kill a powersupply dead as a doornail.

I asked about this a couple of years ago.  Unfortunately I didn't post
what I ended up using.  A quick search suggests this:

  tr \\0 \\377 < /dev/zero

I wanted actual ones, I think.  :-)

Something along the lines of:

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
         while (1) {
                 printf("1");
         }
         return 0;
}

...would do just fine.  :-)

Well,
  tr \\0 1 < /dev/zero
should do what you want.  Of course you could stick with the theme and use
  tr \\0 \\101 < /dev/zero

EEERrrrK!  Aluminum melts at about 1220F. I melt and pour aluminum things in a 
home-made foundry, including using bits of dead drives (the magnets are great 
for refrigerator notes.) Now, the cast components of -some- drives are of a 
pot-metal alloy and you certainly -can- melt those on a stove - in a pot - 
hence the name. That stuff usually contains some lead, so keep a window open. 
(I only do my aluminum melting outside, because I heat with coal and 
charcoal ...)

David

In regard to HP in general.  In January I got some new HP desktops that I
wiped the Windoz off of an loaded Linux.  There was a HW problem with the
DVD/RW that HP would not touch because the software they shipped with had
been removed.

I personally will *never* recommend using HP as a result of that support
experience.  I have some suggestions though:

1.  Keep the original diagnostic and Windows partitions (maybe shrunk
however) and load your system Dual Boot to avoid the problem I had.

2.  Check your materials that came with the HP unit.  There is *no* recovery
CD.  If you want one, you must order it.  It will cost you in the
neighborhood of $40 (about half of that is shipping).  It might be a
worthwhile investment to get, prior to really needing it.

Good Luck.

For those of you with Solaris boxes on which you usually install the
SunFreeware.com packages, check out the Community Software project at
http://www.blastwave.org.  It's a wider community-based packaging effort
that not only tends to keep packages more current (and has more of
them), but also actually uses the dependency field in SysV packages,
which makes installing with pkg-get much easier.  (Their packages also
go into /opt, so /usr/local isn't cluttered with non-local software.)

Yeah, I melted a cheap tea kettle once that wouldn't whistle.  Probably
not just aluminum, I'd guess.  I have no idea how hot a stove gets.

Message-ID: <20050421132504.1072dd83.jason@vancleve.com>

I keep trying to scratch this, because it really itches:  what font or
fonts support all the various graphical characters used in CLIs?  I've
been running Eterm and using the default fixed-width font, and that's
good for most things.  I can start alsamixer, for example, and see all
its blue boxes.

Now I'm playing with the epic IRC client (which is pretty cool), and I'm
having trouble dealing with graphics characters in that interface:  they
were coming out as European-accented characters.  So I googled a bit and
then installed artwiz-fonts, which gives me some new and funky fonts;
and those work much better with epic, but they totally fail with
alsamixer:

http://www.vancleve.com/temp/shot.gif

Is there no one font that contains all of these stupid characters?  Must
I start my terminal windows with different fonts, depending on which
program I want to run in them?

Many years ago, when I worked as a phone tech for Central Point Software
(anyone else remember them?), I was told that the spec for a DoD wipe was
to write 0s & 1s to each byte of the hard drive N number of times. (ISTR
that the value of N was 7, but I won't swear to it.)

As Wil points out in another response, given enough money & time, you
can recover the data on any hard drive -- short of melting the platters
into aluminium ingots. (The NSA have on their staff ueber-geeks who
live for that kind of challenge.) For the rest of us, there is/was a
company in Minnesota that would recover data from hard drives that had
been deleted, reformatted, & electronically shredded -- but for a
pretty penny; IIRC, just to look at the disk in question would cost
$500.-- in 1994 dollars.

But the simpler solution would be social engineering. In other words,
if someone REALLY wants the data from my hard drives, it's available --
without the hassle of data recovery -- for $5000.-- each. The only
useful information I figure that's on any of them are a number of my
password for various accounts -- which I'll change the second after I
pull the hard drives from my computer. There are some emails, pr0n, &
code I've written -- but I assume any buyer is looking for useful
information, not entertainment.

Geoff,

   Yup! Sure do!

   When I was in the Army as a counterintelligence spook (go ahead; I've heard
all the puns already) I was taught to pick cylinder locks and to manipulate
combination locks. (My wife and I used to spend evenings in our apartment in
Frankfurt picking locks over and over, trying to set speed records. Yes, I
taught her how to do it, too.)

   My point is that I learned that locks serve only one purpose: to delay
entry until whatever is stored behind the lock no longer has great value.
Given sufficient time, every lock ever made can be opened by a highly-trained
technician.

   So, recovery of data on hard drives that have been scrubbed many times is
to be expected. And your attitude about your hard drives is paralled by my
attitude about shredding all paper with my name and any account number. I use
my faithful ol' Bostich 1/4" shredder and haven't splurged for the 1/8"
cross-cutting shredder. If someone wants that data he's going to have to work
hard for it, but with scanners and computers even the small pieces can be
reassembled.

Good points Rich. Though I don't have a cross-cut, I tend to throw my 
shreddings in with the kitty litter waste, so they get a little extra 
material gain. ;)

I'm being mid 70's retro.

I have Linux installed on a zv5000z laptop.  I will have to look up the
model number of yours. The fisrt search does not find anything by that
model number. 

Mine is an AMD64 chipset, so your issues may differ...

Here are the problems you are likely to encounter...

The wide screen display will give you fits.  I can get you the correct
mode lines.  If it has the nVidia 440GO video card, you will need the
closed source driver.  (Otherwise switching from X back to the command
line will produce garbage on the screen.)  You will need to add "NvAGP"
"2" to get X to boot correctly with the latest driver.  (There is an
issue with the GO processor and the latest drivers.)

If cardbus does not work on the laptop you will need a kernel patch.  I
have a copy of that. (PCMCIA may take a memory exclude option, but that
may just be the 64bit version.)

If it has the broadcom wireless chipset, it will take some hacking to
get that to work.

If the mousepad does not work, add "i8042.nomux" to the kernel boot line
in /etc/grub.conf.

If you have any questions, just ask.

There isn't anything out there that is exactly what you want. I'm 
thinking of something similar to Goldmine or Act!. The closest you can 
find is something like: Webgui, SugarCRM, Anteil, etc.

Here are a few places you can find more info...

Jack,

   Yes, Act! or Goldmine are models. Before I left the DOS world I wrote my
own contact management system in Paradox. Used it every day and it was
perfect ... because I kept tuning and adjusting until it did everything I
wanted and needed. Somehow, I never got around to translating that to
postgres. Probably because there wasn't an easy-to-learn-and-use report
writer, and the reports are the heart of the system.

   I just downloaded SugarCRM. I chuckle at the inclusion of "My Bugs to Fix"
'cause that's not applicable to those of us not in the software/hardware
business, but it looks like it will do what I need. I'm not fond of BUIs, but
I'm getting used to them. Much prefer to keep my hands on the keyboard and
ignore the trackball.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0504221228020.19980@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I'm trying to install AnteilCRM (with a public "Thank you!" to Josh Drake
for the pointer) and restart httpd. Everything looks properly installed in
/var/www/htdocs/anteil_crm. However, when I try to re-start httpd I see this:

[root at salmo /etc/apache]# /etc/rc.d/rc.httpd start
Syntax error on line 105 of /etc/apache/_anteil_opencrm.conf:
Invalid command 'php_value', perhaps mis-spelled or defined by a module not
included in the server configuration
/usr/sbin/apachectl start: httpd could not be started

   In /etc/apache/_anteil_opencrm.conf, at line 105 there is this:

php_value auto_prepend_file /var/www/htdocs/anteil_opencrm/php/include/prepend.inc
php_value include_path .:/var/www/htdocs/anteil_opencrm/php/include:/opt/php-4..3.11/pear:/var/www/htdocs/anteil_opencrm/php/udb_php

   So the problem is with the command 'php_value'. But, I don't know php so I
have no idea why there is this problem. And, I also need a solution so I can
start apache again.

TIA,

Rich

Rich,

Is PHP configured for you Apache installation? Doesn't sound like it.

Create a file "phpinfo.php", save it to your htdocs and put this in:

<?php phpinfo(); exit(); ?>

Call it from your browser. It must come up with PHP configuration 
information. Of course for that you'd first have to mask out the Anteil 
stuff to bring up Apache.

If PHP does not come up correctly, check into: LoadModule and AddModule.

   Yup. I went through that exercise a couple of weeks ago in order to get
WebCollab up and running (which it is).

I've never had a BUI.  Was that a qwerty-typo'd GUI?

In any case, graphical interfaces are good, and interfaces which rely 
solely on the mouse are not.  Will mozilla ever get the hotkey support 
and configurability of konqueror?

Wait.  Was that "Braindead User Interface"?  Got it.

Looks like it's just in the 'vim' package:

$ dpkg -S `which vimtutor`
vim: /usr/bin/vimtutor

   With about 35 years of experience with paper tape, punch cards, Teletype(R)
terminals, and monochrome CRTs terminals connected at 300 baud (remote) or
9600 bps (local), I kinda' grew to like the CLI*. Late 1990s I finally
accepted the GUI** 'cause it gives me multiple virtual consoles in which to
type. But, I much prefer to keep my hands on the keyboard (the Army taught me
to touchtype on manual typewriters at 60 wpm) and not use the rodent (even
when it's on its back as a trackball).

   Close enough.

Web UIs, with newer web standards, are approximating the richness of fat
client applications.  Of course, it's a good bit of work over the
already difficult work of building a good web UI, so lots of
applications are still fairly limited in their keyboard-entry features.
I think UI-guru partner Randall has done a fair amount of keyboard-entry
stuff with SQL-Clinich, but unfortunately we don't have a public demo
yet.

Web UIs, with newer web standards, are approximating the richness of fat
client applications.  Of course, it's a good bit of work over the
already difficult work of building a good web UI, so lots of
applications are still fairly limited in their keyboard-entry features.
I think UI-guru partner Randall has done a fair amount of keyboard-entry
stuff with SQL-Clinich, but unfortunately we don't have a public demo
yet.

Message-ID: <20050423023558.GA20078@gate.kl-ic.com>


Last night was an amazing talk by Bob Colwell, chief architect for
the Intel P6, which was the grandfather of most of the current 
family of Intel processors.  So arguably this fellow designed most
of the world's computing iron - along with a few thousand friends.

There were more people there than I have ever seen at a local IEEE
presentation - 360 registered, more snuck in, and many turned away
at the door.  The talk was long and a bit disorganized, but there
was a great deal of information about the process that decides what
goes into the processor and what does not.  The politics involved 
are enormous - those architectural decisions decided how a hundred
billion dollars worth of computer systems work.  Telling Compaq, 
for example, that the level 2 cache goes in the package, eliminating
one of Compaq's chief differentiators and possibly leading to it's
weakening and absorption by HP.  Telling a Cray chief architect
"sorry, no hidden instructions for you, unless you are willing to
buy 200 million processors and your own design".  Deciding to bet
the company on out-of-order instruction sequencing, and remaining
loyal to older users by keeping legacy instructions (if they had
remembered to do that with Itanium, then Opteron would not have 
cleaned their clock).

The audience was about half Intel; there was a lot of Intel politics
discussed.  One interesting factoid was about the FDIV floating point
divide bug.  There were about a dozen engineers involved in the
various stages of designing and testing the hardware with that bug;
while it cost Intel half a billion dollars to fix, the engineers were
not publically censured.  Colwell does not know their names, but knows
they still have viable careers at Intel.  The idea is that when you 
take risks, you risk mistakes;  if you punish mistakes, you punish
risk taking, which is lethal for a high-tech company.  The approach
they take instead is to plan to manage risk and the inevitable mistakes
that occur.  Unlike the Beast of Redmond, Intel ultimately owned up to
the mistake and fixed their customers machines.

Intel has a reputation as a hard-ass company, but I was impressed by
their having a ghost of a clue, rare for a company that size and that
strongly driven.  Colwell (now a consultant) is a hero to most of the
Intel engineers in that room.

Subject: [PLUG] OpenGL Libraries?
Message-ID: <200504230933.30844.rsteff.l@comcast.net>

I downloaded a CAD program, http://www.tech.oru.se/cad/varkon/ that comes as 
source code, and tried to compile it on my SuSE 9.1 system. As installed, the 
operating system did not have development tools, so, I've installed things 
only as I've discovered I need them. 

My first attempt to compile Varkon failed right away with errors that showed 
me that I didn't have X11 development files. Using YaST, I loaded them, or at 
least what I assumed to be them. 

The second attempt to compile Varkon had substantially fewer errors. This 
time, it looks like what I'm missing is OpenGL. Here's the first two lines of 
the error messages:

In file included from gp1.c:43:
../../DB/include/DB.h:89:19: GL/gl.h: No such file or directory

I went back to YaST, but have not been successful locating OpenGL. Somewhere 
in the Varkon documentation I'm pretty sure I read that they developed this 
software on a ?SuSE 9.1, system and gave some assurance that it should work 
for someone using the same, so I'm assuming I should be able to get what I 
need.

Can anyone describe the package name, and where it's kept in YaST, for OpenGL, 
assuming, of course, that it is what I'm missing?

Looks like you want this:
XFree86-Mesa-devel-4.3.99.902-40.i586.rpm


I'm not a SuSE user, but here's how I quickly found the package.

go to rpm.pbone.net

select advanced search

click the 'Uncheck All' button

select 'SuSE 9.X'

enter gl.h for search expression

make sure the 'File Name' and 'Provide' boxes are checked

search

make intelligent guess at appropriate package based on filenames in search
results

Dick,

   Wow! I thought varkon was no longer supported. I used that years ago, but
I've never really had a need for a CAD program.

   Get a copy of mesa-3D. It's an open source equivalent of OpenGL.
<http://www.mesa3d.org/> or <http://mesa3d.sourceforge.net/>. I believe the
latter is a link from the former and holds the downloads.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0504230955140.18455@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I'm trapped in a mail list managed by mailman-2.1.5 and I wonder if there's
an indirect way of getting off.

   I go through the appropriate steps on the web site and see the message,
"The confirmation message has been sent.", but nothing shows up in my inbox.
I've tried a dozen times, using two different browsers, without success. I've
not before had any problems getting on or off any mailman-managed mail lists.
Or, those managed by ezmlm or majordomo. My e-mail to the list maintainer
yields neither response directly to me nor to my name being dropped from the
list.

   Is there another way to send a message directly to mailman with the
request?

TIA,

Rich

Getting the prerequisites is always fun.  That's why there are rpm, apt-
get, yum, yast, yast2, etc. The way I find what packages to load is to
use Google on the error message.  You are not the first and certainly
won't be the last to need this.  And, oh yes, read the documentation
that came with the application. [RTFM].

   Never mind. I found a different way to do this in mailman's web interface.

   What I had been doing was entering my e-mail address, then pressing the
button for "unsubscribe or other options." When the next page displayed, I'd
enter my password and press the "unsubscribe" button. That supposedly
generated a confirmation message sent to me.

   This time, on the second page I entered my password then pressed "login."
On the page after that, I checked the "yes, I really want to unsubscribe"
box, clicked the appropriate button, and was rewarded with a message telling
me I was succesfully unsubscribed.

   Learned something new this morning ... and the day's just getting started!

Thanks. I misunderstood something I read in the Varkon documentation, so I was 
looking for something other than mesa3d. In YaST2, the XFree86-devel package 
got me X11 support. The next package in the list is XFree86-Mesa-devel. That 
seems to solve most of the problems, at least the ones related to OpenGL 
libraries. I still have an error, but it looks like it's a different subject, 
so I'll start another message thread for compiling Varkon.

Thanks. This will be very helpful to me in the future, and I suspect others

Well, as I mentioned in the last episode, I read the documentation, but 
misunderstood it. Now that I have all the prerequisites (at least I think I 
do) I'm on to another item that, while mentioned in the documentation, 
conflicts with my admittedly rudimentary understanding of the conventions of 
permissions on directories and compiling programs. From past discussions, 
I've come to believe that one should compile programs as a normal user, and 
not as root. So, that is what I've attempted to set up, here.

The docs tell me that I'll have to have read/write access to things. I created 
a directory in /usr called varkon and set it's ownership to be rsteff:users, 
which is what a number of other directories of mine were set to during 
installation of SuSE 9.1. I guessed at this, and it appears to be what the 
developers intended. I untared the download file in /usr/varkon and that 
process created  /usr/varkon/varkon_1.18A, which the docs refer to. So, 
unless I'm missing something, I have read/write access to anything in varkon. 
Apparently, that's not enough. I ran:

make > make.out 2> err.out

Here's the error message I get (the last 5 lines of err.out, which has a lot 
of warnings but, as far as I can see, just this one error):

/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-suse-linux/3.3.3/../../../../i586-suse-linux/bin/ld: 
cannot open output file /bin/mbsc: Permission denied
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[1]: *** [/bin/mbsc] Error 1
make: *** [distr] Error 2

I'm not to sure what that first line means, the one with all the /../../../ 
stuff going on, but I think I understand that make can't create a file called 
mbsc in /bin. Is it possible that I'm supposed to give rsteff:users write 
access to /bin? Or am I way off the track?

Did not mean to be mean an nasty on the previous post.  Just that
sometimes the documentation will give you a clue, but as in this case
the documentation you read mislead you.  Googled on "/bin/mbsc" and came
up with an installation procedure that puts the source
in /usr/local/src.  This directory should be writable by users.  

Yes, you are correct.  Good UNIX procedure is to compile as a user.
Test.  Then let root install the application for system wide use.

Must have gotten out of the wrong side of bed this morning and turned
into an old grouch.

Sorry if I was snippy and rude before, did not mean to be.

Instructions and documentation can and do have mistakes.  Usually when
installing software from source, the source files are placed under
the /usr/local/src directory.  This directory should be open to users to
place their source code there.  Then make and compile your source and
test it as a user.  Only after deeming it safe for the system, do admins
install it as root.

The easier and more nicely done programs have a configure command that
creates the proper make file for the application.  The not so nice
programs require one to create the make file.

Looks like the make is trying to write to the /bin directory.  mbsc is
the Varkon script compiler.

Thanks. That's a clearer description of the process then I've heard before.

Excellent resource. It should help me with a number of things as I get started

   I'm converting a bunch of tables from mysql format to postgres format. The
mysql tables all have a table constraint, PRIMARY KEY, and some have
additional constraints, KEY. I could not readily find the meaning of the
latter in the mysql manual.

   Does it refer to an indexed column, an additional column in the primary
key, or something altogether different?

Maybe this will help. From O'Reilly's MySQL & mSQL, p. 240:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Indexes

MySQL supports the concept of an index of a table, as described in Chapter 2, 
Database Design. Indexes are created by means of special "types" that are 
included with the table definition:

KEY/INDEX[name] (column, [column2,...])

Creates a regular index of all the named columns (KEY and INDEX, in this 
context are synonyms). Optionally the index may be given a name. If no name 
is provided, a name is assigned based on the first column given and a 
trailing number, if necessary, for uniqueness. If a key contains more than 
one column, leftmost subsets of those columns are also included in the index. 
Consider the following index definition.

INDEX idx1 ( name, rank, serial );

When this index is created, the following groups of columns will be indexed:

 -- name, rank, serial

 -- name, rank

 -- name
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The book goes on to define PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE in this section on Indexes, 
which is part of a larger section on CREATE.

Depending upon which OpenGL operations Varkon is using and your hardware
you may see a major gain with the commercial X drivers from ATi and
nVIDIA. The modern hardware covers a lot of the operations.

Yup, that is recommended practice. Having built a number of programs
there are two tricks that work in 99% of cases.

In pretty well all Makefiles, all of those generated by automake there is
the variable DESTDIR. During `make install` $DESTDIR is prefixed to
target directories. $DESTDIR needs to be setup with directories like
"bin", "lib", "sbin", "usr/bin", "usr/lib", "usr/sbin", "usr/share", and
"usr/local" and such as appropriate to the program, but you can then do
"install" as yourself and merely copy the files as root into appropriate
locations. Occasionally you can set this via the "--destdir" option to
the configure script, but it is tragically rare for the developers to
allow for this.  :'-(  In these cases you need to edit the Makefile by
hand to find DESTDIR.

The fallback trick would be to create a zero-length file "/bin/mbsc" as
root and chown that to yourself. One varient of this is to make that as a
symbolic link somewhere in a directory you own. This is ugly, but does
allow you to control the damage done by the program. Also you may
potentially need to make a *lot* of files for this to work.

The first is much cleaner and nearly always works (though you almost
always have to edit the Makefile by hand), while the second will *always*
work all the time.

Just wasn't certain how to translate the mysql "KEY" to postgres' "CREATE
INDEX".

   There is a tool called "udb" that is part of the download for a database
application I'm working on getting up and running. According to the README
file in the udb source directory,

The udb Project
===============
The udb project provides serialized replication of database transactions,
operating system files, and operating system commands.

An abstraction layer permits transaction synchronization across heterogenous 
database systems.

API's are provided for C, PHP, and UNIX shell.

   My question is why and when do I want to have "serialized replication of
database transactions, operating system files, and operating system
commands"?

I know *exactly* what your looking for, but I've not see anything like that 
out there. The next best thing is something like SugarCRM, webgui, etc. As 
you've mentioned, some of those "options" are only content managers so one 
would need to modify the default configuration. This is an area in FOSS that 
has real potential IMO.

Jack,

   I've really missed it the past few years. So I'm doing something about it.
There's a web-based app that's hardwired for mysql that I'm converting to
postgres and probably into a stand-alone application. It is F/OSS so I'll be
happy to release the finished product under the GPL. The original author had
some major boo-boos in his sql table design; for example, creating a primary
key field with a default of ' '. There are no screen shots, demos, or
detailed coverage of what it does and how it does it. Gotta' infer that from
the tables and code.

   Anyway, I've converted the tables now and will look at using BOND or
something similar to create the UI. The middleware will need to be translated
from php to python or C. My intention is to make it business-type agnostic.
Doesn't matter if you are selling your services as a consultant, cabinet
hardware to builders, machine tools, insurance, or real estate. Many of the
CRM tools I've seen are software-development-centric.

   If anyone would like to help, please contact me off the list. I think this
can be knocked out in a couple of weeks.

Thanks,

Rich

   Allow me to clarify how I use terms, then explain the need.

   Marketing it making your targeted pool of prospective customers/clients
aware of your company, your product or service, your features, and the
benefits that you provide. I do this by writing books and articles, speaking
in front of specific industry groups, networking, and generally tooting my
own horn so my target market hears the music. It's a general, non-specific
set of activities.

   The selling cycle ("sales") starts with a pool of suspects: people who
might be interested in what I have to offer because of their position,
company, and industry. I want to put all the contact information about them
into a database (which I do already with my PDA). Through various activities
(such as mailings, e-mail, telephone calls, and meetings) this pool of
suspects is narrowed into a smaller pool of prospects; those who have the
need, the desire, and the interest in buying a service from me. Eventually,
some of these qualified prospects will participate in a meeting and end up
with a proposal for specific services. A certain number will become clients.

   I want software that lets me note every contact with a suspect/prospect.
What was sent and when. When we spoke, and about what. When I next need to
contact him or her ... and why. I want reports that will allow me to analyze
the relative effectivness of various approaches and to track everything with
high resolution. This is essentially what Act! and Goldmine do.

   Once someone is a client, then the after-sale cycle kicks in. It's here
that most CRM is focused. Customer Relationship Management is great once you
have the customer. Groupware is great when you have a group working on the
same, or related, tasks and need to coordinate. I need to track my
prospecting so I can constantly be tuning it for performance. That is,
continuously feeding new stock into the hopper of suspects and turning a
higher percentage into clients at the output end. Of course, being a
committed Oregonian, I believe in -- and practice -- recycling, so I do this
with clients, too. I've one client for whom I've worked for nine years,
off-and-on. I'd like 100 like them.

Hope this helps to clarify,

Rich

   This, in the context of the source, still leaves me confused. There is a
Universal Data Base project (google turned it up amongst all the IBM DB2
references), but that looks kinda' old and still didn't answer all my
questions.

   It's part of the manual installation procedure for
<http://www.anteil.com/>'s OpenCRM. That's the one that claims to be usable
with many rdbms' but is hard-wired for mysql. So, it looks like I don't need
any of the udb stuff to make a standalone application, particularly if it has
sqlite embedded within it.

Thanks,

Rich

Rich -

I'm not 100% sure on this, but here's my stab at a translation:

First off, at least within databases, a transaction implies a set of 
commands that are atomic, meaning that either ALL of the commands 
complete successfully, or NONE of the commands complete successfully.

Serialization is the fine art of taking multiple parallel commands and 
mashing them together into a single stream of commands which, when 
executed, have the same result as if they were run independently of each 
other.

Replication, of course, is having the same data across multiple systems.

My best guess then, is that udb is a project which is supposed to allow 
you to have safe transactions replicated across multiple databases, 
probably for redundancy or perhaps performance.  From the sound of 
"heterogenous database systems," I would wager it uses standard SQL and 
attempts to not care what kind of database(s) is behind the whole thing 
(MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, DB2, etc).

Then again, my database knowledge is getting rusty quickly, so I might 
be way off base.  Interestingly, Google had nothing to say on the matter 
except a couple IBM DB2 articles that translated UDB into Universal 
DataBase.  Is there a project home page somewhere?

In this case, UDB is another name for DB2.  Exactly why it has two
names, I do not know; maybe because it runs on everything from zOS to
Windows.

Wil,

   I suspect not. From the source tree, in udb.spec (he supports Red Hat 7.3
and 9.0):

Summary: udb - UNIX Database with Transaction Replication
Name: udb
Version: 1.8
Release: 29
Group: Database/Daemons
Source0: http://www.anteil.com/downloads/udb-%{PACKAGE_VERSION}.tgz
Copyright: GPL
BuildRoot: %{_tmppath}/udb-root
Packager: Jim Capp <jcapp at anteil.com>
Requires: mysql, postgresql
Provides: libudb.so, libtbr.so

%description
udb provides replication of database transactions, operating system files,
and operating system commands to servers distributed in a wide-area-network. 
A database abstraction layer provides a common application interface
and uniform access to data in a variety of file formats and databases
including MySQL, Berkely db, xBase, fixed length, and UNIX character
delimited files.

API's are provided for C, PHP, and UNIX shell.

   Of course, now that I read this, my question is answered. Why would I read
the .spec file when there's a doc/ directory? I don't need to replicate
anything to servers distributed in a wide-area-network.

Thanks, all!

Rich

Well, I didn't look for the UDB stuff again, but the udb tarball off 
Anteil's web site had most of it's files dated around October 2001, so 
that's kinda old by now...  Also, Anteil appears to support RH7.3 and 
RH9, so that again gives you a bit of a timeframe.

The code in Anteil's tarball seems to be wrapped pretty well around udb, 
so I'm not sure you'll be able to get away with not installing it. 
Looks like it's just YADAL (Yet Another Database Abstraction Layer), 
possibly with some support for database features that are needed for a 
CRM.  Dunno.

Good luck!

Perhaps I should have said, "in that context"--the hits you see about
UDB with DB2 (and DB2 alone) are referring to DB2.  The other UDB stuff
is something else altogether, as you've seen; just a namespace
collision.  Chances are you'll find far more hits for UDB as another
name for DB2 than you will for the project you're actually looking for
information about.

Ken,

   Yes ... and no. I'm glad that it was there, but putting such a clear
description into a rpm .spec file rather than the rest of the docs is less
than elegant.

I just got a new system with a SATA drive on it.
Knoppix sees the DVD-RW and the DVD-ROM, but not the hard disk (the SATA)
Is there something I can to Knoppix to get it to see the SATA drive?

Go into the SATA BIOS, on the systems I have seen it is a Ctrl-Q during
the SATA device boot just after the memory checks and stuff.  See if
there is a legacy ide mode.

Just out of curiosity... for something such as this, why take the time 
to port it from MySQL to Postres?

If you need a full-fledged database, MySQL vs PostreSQL is like Linux vs 
FreeBSD.  I would hazard to guess you could probably do fine with 
something like SQLite or maybe even just BDB in this case, and will 
probably gain next to nothing by porting it over to Postres except fewer 
people will be able to use it out-of-the-box.

My vote is for Python... more cross-platform capable and much easier to 
get off the ground quickly.  However, web applications *do* have their 
advantages, especially for things such as this.

While my free time is horribly lacking at the moment with a decently 
sized database project that keeps growing larger, trying to help edit 
the Revised Slackware Essentials book before print, trying to get 
SlackSec a viable option for Slackware users, working on some Boinc 
stuff, and of course going to school... ACT! like software has 
interested me since I had a customer who used it so much.  If you set up 
some sort of a developer mailing list, I'd like to subscribe to watch, 
if you don't mind.  :-)

Check SCSI devices, SATA drives interface via the SCSI subsystem.

www.alohacondos.com.  

You don't have to be based in Hawaii and it would involve
approximately 10 hours per week of development work - probably through
the end of 2005 - and maybe longer.

I need someone fluent in:

-HTML, 
-Unix,
-SQL Database (MySQL), 
-Perl and perhaps PHP, 
-MS Exchange (public forms & folders), 
-RPC over HTTP,
-Flash a plus,
-Photoshop a plus.

Not sure if this is too off topic for this forum, but
I thought I would toss it out.  

The company I work for is currently an almost entirely
Mac OSX office, and is looking for an alternative to
the current mail server that they are using.  It is
Cyrus running on OS 10.3.8.

We are looking for suggestions for open source
software that will be IMAP capable, and able to
operate on this platform.  Any suggestions guys and
gals?

Sorry if I was too vague, and I may yet need to refine
my question as this thread goes on. 

Well, we have several years worth of emails in it, and
we are using it also as an email archive that we can
browse.  Lately it seems to have noticably slowed down
in its performance.  We cant seem to find any problems
with it, other than it is just slow. 

More questions for you guys...
Do you have experience with this type of setup? Have
you used this client and others, and how does it
compare?  What are the pros and cons of it? How well
is it documented? 

John

Hmm.  Wild-assed guess.  I wonder what kind of filesystem the mail is
sitting on?  Maybe a lots-of-files-per-directory kind of problem?

Are the clients indexing or not? Are the clients slowing down, or the 
server? What operations are slow?

Unless you've somehow hit a limit bug specific to Cyrus, different
mail server software probably won't make much of a difference.

Your best bet is to figure out what's causing the slowdown, and work
from there.  Time to hone your diagnostic skills.

First, figure out the scope of the problem.  Does it affect all users
equally or some specifically?  Is it slow for all operations or just
for e.g. sending mail?  If everyone uses the same mail client, what
happens when you try another one?  

Then, find a way to reproduce the problem.  You may already know how,
if mail is obviously slow for you.  

Characterize the problem: exactly how slow is it, does it happen every
time, does it happen only during the day when the server's busy, or is
it slow all the time?

Finally, observe the server, both during the workday and outside it.
Look at the output of 'top', say, while the problem is being
reproduced.  Look at the loadavg numbers, RAM and swap, and see how
they jump around as processes jump to the top of the list.  If you can
see the server, look at the disk drive light and see if it's on
steadily during some operations.

"Slow mail" can be a symptom of many problems from overload to DNS to
bad hardware.  But like most user-visible problems, it's just a symptom.

Bop,

First off it is IMAP. 

Second, It is the clients who are seeing the slowdown.
 I know that the mail is copied over to the client
machines, as well as master maintained by and on the
server. I am not sure on "Indexing" but we have a
series of nested folders which ultimately ends up in a
folder for each client, and is at most 5 directories
deep incuding the client directory. Primarily
operations such as moving emails from one folder to
another are becoming tediously slow, as well as
general reciept and sending of emails.

Subject: [PLUG] Trend micro's Linux software...
Message-ID: <1114449213.426d253d7cf47@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

Checked out http://housecall.trendmicro.com/ today and found out there's a
Linux version of PC-Cilin now.

I was a little bummed though that it's for Redhat 8 and 9, versions 
I've never liked.

You can get it for Enterprise Redhat too.  What Trendmicro should do in
my opinion is write their own programming language and distribute a
compiler for it written in assembly.  Chances are, that would protect
their software.  Thing is, properly written, their Linux product should
compile on any Linux system that meets standard instead of vendor
specific criteria.  A better solution is getting TrendMicro to say,
"here's the C/Java/C++ code to use our virus engines, you must pay 
$20 a year though for access to current virus lists."

It should theoretically be cheaper and more profitable to sell software
for Linux than it is to sell it for Windows.

I wouldn't mind paying $20 for a program that will compile on Linux 
and allow me to do up to date virus scanning for six months to a 
year.

It's surprising that Fedora isn't supported.   It seems that Trend 
Micro is discriminating against up to date free verions of Linux.  
Redhat Enterprise Linux is anything but free.  Strange that there's 
a Suse but no Debian port.

John,

I can offer an overview of things to look for when determining
performance bottlenecks. The dynamic is similiar to diagnosing server or
PC bottlenecks--say a "performance diagnostic plus" as you've now
extended the problem to include potential networking issues.

I generally start from the core outward. This means the processor load
and memory usage. Is the CPU working hard to process the emails? This
can happen if your mail server not only delivers the mail to the local
filesystem but also processes the mail for spam and viruses.

Does the server have enough memory? If the server is swapping processes
to swap disk space, you're basically gauranteed a chronic performance
problem.

Is the mass storage subsystem up to the task? Think about moving the
storage from a single drive if applicable to a striped (and mirrored)
RAID 0+1 array.

How about bandwidth? Does your server have the connectivity to quickly
send and receive emails so that it may get on with the filesystem
delivery phase or is the server jammed waiting to trickle out? Perhaps
your mail server (shudder for security reasons) also doubles as a
file/print/application server. Is your network subsystem tied up with
these tasks as well? 

Is the mail process set to a high enough priority or is it relegated to
a "when there's time leftover" status?

Moving on to the software...

Does the mail server have a lenghty queue of backlogged mail that it is
constantly trying to process? This can happen by emails that cannot be
delivered as the remote server requires reverse DNS lookups to be
delivered. Since there is not a '504' error meaning definate failure,
the server keeps trying. For all of these issues, look at your logs for
the 'delay=' entries to determine how long the mail took to process.
Larger backlogs means more work for the server and hence fewer resources
for doing the "real work."

Overall, I think a migration to a higher capacity server is usually the
best route in a case where "obvious" things do not yield good results.
My view is that while you don't want to just throw hardware at the
problem, holistically it's better to move to a platform that will give
you room to breath looking forward. It's also worthy of consideration
that  the prospects of tweaking an old server to death may only yield
receive a minimum of benefit. 

As your endeavors continue and the system renders new information we can
home in on what the bottleneck is.

   I'm interested in buying a small scanner that will work with xsane (and a
USB interface will work here) for digitizing photographs. Most are 5"x7" or
smaller; some may be 8"x10".

   What have folks used that they know work well with the 2.4.x kernel?

TIA,

You might want to have a look on Craig's list for a used one. A couple of 
years ago, we thought we'd upgrade to a USB scanner when the SCSI card for 
our old one quit. We were not pleased with the quality of the newer scanner, 
even though it was supposed to scan at a higher resolution than our old one. 
(Sorry, I don't remember the model or make.) 

I don't know about the 2.4 kernel, but I know that my old Epson Perfection 600 
(a uMax something or other underneath the cover), with a SCSI interface, 
works with xsane. Since it is many years old, I'd be very surprised if it 
didn't work with the 2.4 kernel.

I have the Epson Perfection 1660 flatbed with USB.  Running it currently 
with the 2.6 kernel, but I thing I ran it previously under the 2.4.

Just checked the sane page at noted that the epson backend isn't 
distributed directly due to lack of open source, but there is a driver 
and external program.  Not sure what's up with that since I used the 
scanner last week.  The iscan program does support 2.4 kernels after 
2.4.8 if you're using USB.

In anycase the webpage at 
http://www.sane-project.org/lists/sane-backends-external.html is very 
helpful.  It's one the ways I checked to see what scanners were compatible.

   I had a Umax that was reported to work with linux, but I could not get a
scsi card for it that worked. It sat here unusable for several years until I
gave it away.

   If I could put one on the scsi-u2w card I have for the tape drive and
cd-rw, that would be OK.

Mark,

   As I wrote in response to Dick's message, I had checked the sane page
before I bought my old uMax 2200. The problem was getting a SCSI card that
would recognize it. Tried three and gave up.

Thanks,

Rich

   I downloaded a tarball that won't extract. I suspect it's because it's
trying to put the contents in non-existent directories. I want to extract all

   Nevermind. I figured it out.

Develop an entire programming language of their own simply to distribute
one program?! Do you have any idea of the sort of complexity of
developing one good programming language? And the complexity of
developing a decent compiler? Add to this fact that writing the compiler
in assembly language leaves everyone out whose system has a different
processor. Then there is all the work to rewrite their software in this
new programming language. And the compiler itself has to be portable as
well...   ALL of these steps are *extremely* difficult!

Please think a little more and try to avoid suggesting totally ridiculous
ideas!

Could you point to a commercial software entity doing otherwise? The
support the enterprise versions because no sane enterprise uses bleeding
edge distributions on servers (slight emphasis on /sane/). Likely someone
has developed a package for Debian. Most likely they are also
distributing a tarball, and that is usable on any system.

I hope that you all have heard that Microsoft has reneged support to the
gay and lesbian community by withdrawing support for gay rights
legislation in Washington State.

The gay and lesbian cummunity has called for a boycott of Microsoft
products as a result.

I think that this should be an excellent opportunity to push Linux
out there in the community at a time when Microsoft might be in

No, I think he genuinely believes what he writes. I suspect the problem
is he thinks he knows a lot more than he does. Secondary problem is we've
been unable to get that point through to him.

1)  Why isn't this on PLUG-Talk?
2)  Why is it a *software* company's job to support or not support
legislation like this?

Electronics geeks:

I have a portable power-supply problem for a small device and I need
to find a AA battery holder that I can solder some leads onto.  I
haven't quite figured out whether I need 3 or 4 batteries.  It also
needs to be enclosed so the batteries won't fall out.  

Anyone know a likely local source (it's kind of nice to hold the thing
in your hand so you know what you are buying), or alternatively a
recommended part I can get online?

Thanks in advance!

Russell,

   Have you tried Radio Shack?

   Is Lafayette Radio still no NE Grand, by Couch? They used to have all sorts
of stuff.

   Galen will point you to the same electronic components vendor that he got
me using. I forget their name at the moment, but they have everything anyone
could possibly need. Best of all, their catelog will hold open a door in the
strong east winds we get out here.

I'd like to recommend Norvac Electronics out on Nimbus in Beaverton (near the 
W-Square Mall.) Radio Shack -used- to be a great place for parts, but they 
have slowly gotten rid of all the hobby electronic kit projects (such as the 
crystal-diode radio set, or 'fun noises you can make with a 555 timer') in 
favor of nearly completely assembled motorized toys.

They don't even have the tube tester on the back corner of the store.

Norvac has bins and bins of basic hardware, plus switches and connectors, etc.

Or you might try Wacky Willie's out on Vaughn.

The latest entry in the saga of the server is as
follows. 
We did a rebuild of the server data last night, and
things seem to have gone well enough.  Our webmail
interface works fine, and has no problems, but our
email clients on the desktop are not synchronizing,
and our mail client data is corrupting.  

A small snippet of the log errors is as follows:

Apr 26 08:57:57 localhost master[516]: ready for
workApr 26 08:57:57 localhost ctl_cyrusdb[518]:
checkpointing cyrus databasesApr 26 08:57:57 localhost

process 522 exited, signaled to death by 6Apr 26
08:59:16 localhost master[516]: process 524 exited,
signaled to death by 6


Any Ideas?

This really does belong on PLUG-Talk, but since neither of you are probably on 
that (and neither am I), I'll just state the facts.

Fact: Despite whatever other issues M$ may have, they have supported domestic 
partners, regardless of orientation, for many years.

Fact: A bill before the Washington State Legislature prohibiting 
discrimination against people because of their sexual orientation was 
defeated last week by one vote.

Fact: In the past, M$ has strongly supported and lobbied for such a bill.

Fact: Several senior M$ managers (one of which had acted as an official 
spokesman for M$ in the past) came out publicly (so to speak) strongly in 
favor of the bill.

Fact: According to Steve Balmer, in an interview in yesterday's Oregonian, Ken 
Hutchinson, pastor of Antioch Bible Church, contacted him and said that his 
church, Focus On The Family, and other Evangelical organizations would 
organize a boycot of M$ products if M$ didn't pull all support from the bill 
and fire any M$ folks that publicly supported it. Balmer said in the 
interview that he decided to pull support for the bill, but that he would not 
fire anyone because of their sexual orientation or political opinion.

Those are the facts. I have very strong opinions on this, but I'll leave those 
out. Incidentally, I have not yet seen any calls by GLBT civil rights groups 
calling for boycotts and I suspect I won't, since there are much bigger fish 
to fry right now.

Nah. Just a bit misguided, probably thought Pro-Linux means anything 
anti-MS is good. It should be on Plug-Talk.

Message-ID: <426E6F78.5040500@dimstar.net>

In the last month, my rejection rate has gone from ~30% to ~50%. 


Here's my pflogsum summary from March 31:

    551   rejected (28%)
      0   reject warnings
      0   held
      0   discarded (0%)

And the same section from April 25:

    862   rejected (48%)

I'm seeing a lot more rejections like this:

407CBB97.9060701 at dimstar.net

and more that normal of the usual suspects... spoofed comcast, verizon, and whatnot. 

Are other people seeing this?

Russ,

   Yup. And my postfix reject percentage goes up and down like a yo-yo. I see
rejections for messages addressed to pineNNNNNNN at ... (a long string of
numbers where the Ns are) and slrnNNNNNNN at .... Plus, a lot of the same domain
names, day after day.

If you wish to discuss such wildly off-topic things as this, I would
suggest subscribing.  Your guess about my subscription status was
incorrect, as well... I've been subscribed to PLUG-Talk for quite a
while now.  I'm also sending this to PLUG-Talk with only a CC to the
main list so you see where I'm going with it.

So essentially they're damned if they do, damned if they don't.  Instead
of picking a side in a heated debate (in which both sides are 100%
convinced their position is the correct position), Microsoft has pulled
out of the issue and will let somebody else make the decision.

Sounds like excellent business strategy to me and really the only sane
thing to do when put in this situation.  It is not Microsoft's job
(thank God) to determine public policy.  It sounds to me like you're
trying to make some giant mountain out of a little itty bitty mole
hill... get over it.

   Germane to the recent thread on performance throttling on a mail system, I
will tell you about a new book that arrived just this afternoon: "Optimizing
Linux Performance: A Hands-On Guide to Linux Performance Tools" by Phillip
G. Ezolt. It has a 2005 publication date and is put out by HP via Prentice
Hall PTR Group.

   I read the reviews before ordering, but have not looked past the ToC today.
He does have a chapter on finding problems using the performance tools (all
of which appear to be those included in the standard GNU/Linux distributions,
with a couple of extras to fetch and install.)

   For those of us who don't do this for a living, it's going to be a very
handy reference. You guys who do this all the time can ignore this message.

   List price is $49.99; I bought my copy from amazon and saved almost half
(including shipping).

But, since Mark tied Linux into the issue, it isn't "wildly off-topic". 
Last time I looked the list was billed as being for "General Linux 
discussion and assistance". If Mark has specific ideas regarding how this 
issue can be used to increase the Linux user-base, then it is on-topic.

Whether you like his politics or not is irrelevant.

6?  That's SIGABRT (ABORT); not sure what that means, other than
database library mismatch or something like that.  That said, if you're
using OS X Server and the binaries Apple shipped, that shouldn't be the
problem.  (Sometimes people have binaries built for BDB 4.1.X with only
4.2.X installed and that causes bizarre segfaults.)

These error messages could be misleading; it might be that some of your
files are not owned by 'cyrus'--it would account for database failures
and the odd signal number.  Assuming 'cyrus' is the user it runs as
(which it does usually, but I haven't seen what OS X Server does), run
'chown -R cyrus /var/lib/imap /var/spool/imap'.  You might need
'/var/imap' instead of '/var/lib/imap'; it's somewhat system dependent.

Shameless plug/PLUG:  Alternately, if you cannot figure it out and don't
mind paying a little for support, you can get in touch with me.  Since
it's OS X and I hardly know it (but am curious about it), I'd do it on a
pass/fail basis.  (Of course, my time is really tight for the next
couple of days, so I'd probably be unable to go on-site.)

If you're wanting to buy a *new* scanner, then good luck.  The 
manufacturers change chipsets so often that a supported scanner may not 
be the same thing that's on the shelf today (in fact, the scanners on 
the shelf in the same box may not even be the same.)

I've had no driver problems with my Cannon LIDE30.  That's not a good 
(as in graphics quality or speed) scanner, but it is small and cheap.

Now.  Would someone please show me a manufacturer which ships 
open-source Linux drivers and sane backends with their scanners?

IIRC, there was one company that had an active linux driver project, but 
you could only find it via their japanese page or something (sorry, 
REALLY fuzzy memory only contains "starts with P", but no guarantees on 
even the P.)  All I know is that it was really hard to find the site.  
Just call the sales number at every major manufacturer and hang up if 
they say "what?" when you tell them that you want a scanner with Linux 
support.  Don't call Visioneer.

Okay.  epson "contains P":

There isn't any 'make install' with Varkon, just plain make. (I tried, and 
make told me so.)

I tried this. I ended up creating 7 or 8 files, but then started getting other 
errors and decided this was not productive. This wasn't a total waste of 
time, however, as it taught me about the concept of creating a zero-length 
files using touch.

Today, I finally have some free time to fiddle with this. I went back to the 
third party tutorial someone found for me:

http://www.marcdatabase.com/~lemur/vk-varkon-tutorial.html

and took my time reading all his instructions. He, too, recommends compiling 
to a user directory instead of to a system one, and identifies several 
environment variables that need to be created in the .bashrc file. While I've 
been aware of these, it's actually the first time I've had a reason to edit 
my .bashrc file.

To make a long story short, I followed the tutorial's instructions with only 
one exception: instead of creating /usr/local/varkon_nnn, I 
created /usr/varkon as root, and then changed the ownership to rsteff:users. 
tar -xzvf created the appropriate varkon_nnn directory. After I unpacked the 
source in /usr/varkon, I had to change the ownership of some of the files and 
directories with chown -R rsteff:users * (probably because I did some of this 
before remembering to drop back to a normal user!)  

This time, make ran to completion with no errors, and varkon & starts the 
program as expected. 

Thanks to all for the pointers.

Why do you ask that this is a troll?

I see a marketing opportunity here with Microsoft in the midst of
an embarrassment.

As a gay person, I find it offensive what Microsoft has done in
this incident and I feel that it would be appropriate to take
advantage of their embarassment.

I am having trouble seeking where you find this a troll. To
me a troll means that you are embarrassed or outraged

Dick,

   The reason this is not a Good Thing(TM) is that an OS upgrade can overwrite
everything in /usr, including your new directory for varkon. It's much better
practice to install local software in /usr/local/ or /opt (for optional).
Distributions will not write to these directories during an upgrade.

I've got a good solid BackupPC server that has been running for about 6 months now. The other day I noticed that I can't restore a file to different client other than the one I backed up. I'm using rsync as the transfer method. So far everything works fine except for this one glitch. Has anybody else run into this? The error I get on the web interface is 'unexpected response' then the name of the rsync share. Rsync is set up identically across all the linux clients, and it doesn't matter which machine I try to restore to, it only works if the files were backed up from that machine to begin with.

Thanks,

Sean Harbour

I was able to get several 3 year old Mustek flatbed scanners to work more or less correctly with xsane last year. The only problem was finding and extracting the firmware code from the windows drivers so that xsane could properly initialize the scanners. It WAS documented, but it did take an hour or so to figure out. My suggestion is to print out the list of supported scanners before you go shopping, and be prepared to return a couple of them when they don't work.

Sure is, I mean, if some dinky church parish (not even a full church)
can push Microsoft around, we can study what happened and potentially,
we can push Microsoft around too.

I was under the impression that Microsoft has tried in the past to be
Gay-Friendly in order to attract the best developers. 

I wonder what the comparative work environment would be at various Linux
distributers, especially Red Hat in the Bible Belt of NC.... (Raleigh
has a quite different tone from Chapel Hill or even Durham) Anyone who
has read "Just for Fun" understands... or even Novell/SUSE in the Mormon
belt of UT.

Thanks,

	wildcard cert

Well, in some special cases, you can use a wild card certificate. They cost about 3 x what a single name cert does, but are well worth it for where they apply. The trick is, wild card certs only work for subdomains. For instance, your domain is foo.com. You can purchase a wild card cert for *.foo.com. There are no IP address limitations to the certificate, it works for any valid dns host name at foo.com. So, a.foo.com, b.foo.com, x.foo.com would all be valid hostnames with a single wild card certificate. You can put the same certificate on 1000 separate servers, or 1000 virtual domains on 1 server that all go to the same directory, and it will work fine.
One caveat is that they only work for one subdomain level below the registered name. a.foo.com is valid, but x.a.foo.com is not, unless you purchase another wild card cert specifically for *.a.foo.com to use with x.a.foo.com.

We use a single wild card certificate at work for our apache, IIS and hardware ssl accelerators with no problems. Figuring out how to convert the certificate to work on each platform can be entertaining, but google is your friend.

Wildcard certs are intended for enterprise use, and obviously cannot be used to cheaply encrypt just any random domain name agglomeration. Hope this helps.

You need some sort of innocent looking high powered wide angle infra red emitter that could be run from a USB port. People would get suspicious of a guy with ponytails pointing his laptop at every annoying device in the place just before they shut down. :-)

Thanks, Rich. I'll take another look at things and maybe redo the install, if 
for no other reason than that I can use the practice. Eventually, I'll get it

   Then Keith will be the decoy and I'll do the zapping. :-) No ponytail here,

Dick,

   It's not a matter of right or wrong, but of best practices. If there's a
configure file for varkon then "./configure -h | less" will show you the
available options, one screen at a time. Most configure files have a variable
called PREFIX which is the root directory for installation. The configure
file also usually tells us that PREFIX's default is /usr/local/. That, of
course, can be changed to suit.

   What this does is put the executable binary in PREFIX/bin, any libraries in
PREFIX/lib, and so on. It's a well-thought out system for consistency.

HTH,

Rich

I don't know BackupPC, but there may be differences between the
UID or GID numbers of the two machines for the user whose file
you are trying to move.  You may learn something by looking at
/etc/passwd for the two different machines.

That said, I would call this a feature, not a problem.  If one of
your machines is security-compromised, you really don't want that
machine to be able to request backed-up information (say ~/.ssh)
from other machines and then compromise them, too.  I would think
long and hard about the security advantages of this behavior before
trying to bypass it.  I assume the designers intended BackupPC to
behave this way.

Thanks Keith, some good points. Our default policy is to leave the rsync share read only, and only accessible by the backup server. I manually adjust the local rsync settings before attempting to restore something. I think I'll make sure the rsync settings exclude access to .ssh directories tomorrow. :-)

That said, it doesn't even get to the point of transfering a file, it just quits as soon as it receives the rsync share name and descriptive comment. I'll see if I can get some decent debug info tomorrow.

Dear Wil, 

In light of the recent "Marketing" discussion, I looked at
http://www.pdxlinux.org/mail/ and can't find guidelines with respect to
what qualifies where on what mailing list. To me, the discussion seemed
tame compared to what we normally say about Windoze.

I've seen some discussion on /. on the "Marketing" issue. I would think
that if the discussion is good enough for /., it's good enough here. If
there are additional guidelines for this mailing list, I'd appreciate
hearing about them.

Thanks,
Mike

The unfortunate truth is that PLUG has no real rules. In the past, this 
has allowed Rob, Michael, and others of their ilk to abuse and (sometimes) 
drive away members. The solution we came up with was to hand referee power 
to the listmaster - Wil.

In this case, I think Wil saw where it was going and decided to hit the 
brakes early. IMHO, he is within his rights to do so.

I agree. I have very strong feelings on this, but I also recognize that this 
list is a place for us to discuss Linux and to help each other with technical 
issues. I do not want to see any impingement of that goal.

Assuming from our off-list "conversation" the "Rob" you refer to is
me... I must ask:  When was the last time I dove in to an off topic
flamewar, abused members, or tried to drive away members?

Looking at the year 2005, I see nothing questionable by me except
perhaps the recent "Microsoft not supporting gay rights" thread which I
responded to twice, once to PLUG-Talk to attempt to drive the
conversation that direction.

Again looking at this current year, I see you cancelling and announcing
clinics... and attempting to keep the most recent almost-flamewar going.

Nice, Dan...

Rob

The guidelines are:
 o plug      - On-topic and civil
 o plug-talk - Everything else

It should go without saying (but I'm saying it anyway) that network or
system attacks or activity which would get my boxes confiscated for
evidence are not condoned either.

I guess it also needs to be said that trolling for flammage (whether or
intentionally trolling or not) isn't appreciated either, like including
lots of needlessly sordid details about your personal life when you
should know that people are going to tease you about it.  A certain
degree of personal discussion isn't necessarily bad, when it relates
Linux/UNIX (a la alt.sysadmin.recovery).  It's really all a question of
balance.

Laissez les bontemps roulez!

I never claimed otherwise... I was just questioning the whole
pot-kettle-black thing.  Don't snip my comments and then try and give
them an entirely new and different meaning.

In fact, I was all for the thread dying (or just moving to PLUG-Talk,
which is meant for such things), because otherwise it would have turned
in to just yet another massive flamewar.

If you would like to further this conversation by giving yet a different
meaning to what I'm typing, I would ask you to please either reply to me
directly or hit me on PLUG-Talk.

Dan,

Thanks for the support, Dan.  You also don't have to name names, though,
that just provokes people (as you've seen).

I think even a simple statement to that effect could be helpful, e.g.,
that list moderation power is in Wil's hands, and he has the right to
stop any (non-Linux?) discussion with flame potential arbitrarily, etc.
and the power will be used frequently and quickly on any such
discussions?

Thanks,

It's supposed to create a binary rpm for

it doesn't work.

I'm attaching it hoping that someone

It creates a source rpm, but that source
rpm has no file list and I admittedly
am at a loss when it comes to figuring
out where this source rpm installs
the tarball and spec file.

My goal is to roll my own rpms instead
of installing from tarballs.

Check out the .spec file that ships with the clamav source tarball; it 
works pretty well on Red Hat 9 (can't speak for Red Hat 7.3).

Also, I assume that you know that 0.65 is *way* out of date...

You need to include a %file tag and then list out all of the files or your can 
just list out a directory and it assumes all of the files in the directory 
belong to your RPM. There's also a %dir tag you can use so your RPM can 
actually own the directory the files reside in but be careful with that if 
you're installing the files in /usr or other common, shared directory.

A quick Google search should also yield sample RPM spec files that you can use 
as a template for your SPEC file.

I did the research on this a while back.  Once you read through the
rpm documents
and remove the pre-disposition that everything you do for an rpm has
the have the
source then you basicly just use the files section with the
postinstall postremove sections
to configure or remove/move stuff that is not file based but edit/add
to config scripts.

Dear Wil, 

Perhaps this statement could be posted at http://www.pdxlinux.org/mail/,
so if this happens in the future, we can point to it and say RTFM.

One other question - there are 11 lists shown on the page above. It
doesn't match the list shown at
http://lists.pdxlinux.org/mailman/listinfo. ... but wait a sec, gosh,
there's even a message list related just to the Website?

Thanks,

Larry,

This isn't a binary-only RPM; clamav is an open source package and it
isn't making the final installable binary RPM (i386.rpm) for reasons
that others have pointed out.

I have a small collection of things I've packaged (or re-packaged):

http://haus.nakedape.cc/svn/public/trunk/rpm/SPECS/

I've started using a per-package directory (I'm calling them "rpmsets"):

http://haus.nakedape.cc/svn/public/trunk/rpm/rpmset/

Of course, a lot of that depends on my .rpmmacros file...

In my case it was necessary to build a binary rpm because I did not
have (or want) development tools installed on all the machines I had
to manage.  I don't know if this was the case but my read was that this
was what was needed.

Yeah, there were a few we killed because no one used them.  Guess Geoff
hasn't updated the site (prolly should've notified him).  The web site
has gone through various flurries of interest so a list was formed; it
too has atrophied, but several aliases point to its address and it still
serves a useful way to send comments about the site.

So, just for the curious layman, what kind of bandwidth versus what 
kind of cost are we talking about?  How does one of those work?

A T1 provides about 1.5Mbps symmetric.  So it's slower than the typical
cable modem, perhaps faster than most DSL.  Usually available where DSL
isn't.
Normally is unrestricted, meaning no "anti-servers" policy, and a true
routed connection.  All the public IP space you can justify, plus the
option of having the in-addr delegated to one's nameserver to do your own
reverse DNS.  Multiple T1s can be bonded together for more bandwidth.
Sadly, price is not cheap.  That number I provided earlier can detail the
costs.

I don't think a T-1 starts (for line and bandwidth) under $400/mo, and
I might be thinking of only fractional T-1.  (There are 24 64kbps
channels in a T-1 which can be divided up into any number of ways,
including only actually using a few of the channels, using some for
voice, etc.)

We had a frame-relay frac-T1 (only 128kbps "guaranteed") in the
mid-1990s that cost us (combined telco and packet-flinger)
~$700/month.  Moreover, it took over 6-months to get it installed.  Of
course, during that entire time we were continuously promised "next
week".

When DSL finally became available, we quadrupled our bandwidth for
about 1/10th the cost, though with fewer paper guarantees of service
and reliability.  Turned out to not be a significant problem.

A place I worked (in around 1997 or 1998) had some variety of a T1 with 
768kbps of "guaranteed" bandwidth that cost something like $1500/month.. 
For that price we did get excellent service and support however.  I'd 
imagine (hope?) prices could be much better today.

Given the pricing and features of things like DSL lines nowadays why 
spend the extra money on a relatively expensive T1?  Is it the better 
service or are there other considerations?

Much to my dismay, Internet via T1 pricing has not responded downward as
you might expect given the available alternatives.

T1 benefits:
- Can usually be offered everywhere.  Last I checked, couldn't get DSL,
just that IDSL.  T1 was installed no problem.
- Considered "commercial" grade.  Meaning that when you call with an
outage, you can expect dispatch & repair within hours.  Dunno about you,
but when I had cable, it was once down for 9 days, another time 6 days. 
When I called for repair, they said "we'll be out there on the 15th" which
was then about two weeks away.  I think they have improved significantly
since then, though.
- You get a true routed connection.  Meaning you get say a static /24 or
whatnot from the ISP, rather than singled bridged DHCP address subject to
changing at their whim.  While you still may, no need to do NAT anymore!
- Symmetric bandwidth.  1.5Mbps full duplex.
- If 1.5Mbps isn't enough, a few T1s can be aggregated for more bandwidth
using per-packet load sharing or MLPPP.
- Low 1st hop latency.  It's like about 4ms rtt pinging your first hop
router.  What's cable? 10-15ms?  Not huge, but for gaming every ms counts.
- Servers okay.  Pretty much anything goes, except spam & obvious abuse.
- You can share it.  No prohibitions against sharing with the neighborhood.

T1 cons:
- Cost.  Several hundred per month.  blech!
- Equipment.  While there is plenty of cisco 2500s on ebay, linksys
doesn't make a T1 interface.  Expect to spend a few hundred on a router
&/or csu/dsu.
- Wiring may be harder.  Uses two pair of voice-quality wire.  Depending
on where you want the demarc, you may need to extend it.

Not impossible though, this is evidenced by the sheer number of programming
languages that exist already.

What's ridiculous is the fear of writing software for Linux in 
the first place.  What's also ridiculous is the inability to get 
a valuable application that will work on one version of Linux to work 
on another version.  Especially anti virus products like this 
one are sorely needed.  Trend micro could implement a language 
like Java and not teach the world at large how to program in 
it.  If I don't know a particular programming language, that 
doesn't mean I can't compile a program written in it.  You 
write a language that people don't recognize which is as 
portable as Java, you can write multiple programs in it.  
Ideally, Trend would abandon protecting the program to 
access their antivirus database and charge for accessing 
the database instead, but I don't see this happening 
anytime soon.

Does this mean that Redhat once had one free distribution for 
everyone which has now been replaced by their more expensive than 
Windows Enterprise alternative and the non production Fedora 
system?  What drives the pricing of Enterprise Linux anyways?  It 
seems the public at large is losing.  Instead of the operating 
system should be open and free, we're seeing huge price tags on 
Enterprise variants of Linux.  I don't think this is what Linus 
intended for his project.  What I'm seeing and don't like 
is that Enterprise Linux might become as expensive as commercial 
Unix.  It doesn't look like Linux is going to stay free.  If 
open source Linux distributions lag behind Enterprise variants, 
what will be the advantage of Linux over Windows?  Linux is 
popular because it's free and you can have all of the source 
code to the system, supposedly.  Perhaps greed will turn 
Linux into a lemon worse than Windows.  Those who think they 
can charge a lot for a well put together Linux distribution 
are making a huge mistake, they're going to lose the whole 
audience.  The average Linux user isn't going to be a geek 
anymore as adoption of Linux increases.  If the price of 
Linux isn't contained and continues to rise, the bubble 
will burst.  The average person will say, Windows is 
cheaper.

As far as is Fedora Core 3 a good system.  It seems surprisingly
stable to me.  There are a lot of updates to it.  If the updates
continue beyond the introduction of Fedora Core 4, I don't see
why Fedora Core 3 can't become stable.

Last I checked, Enterprise Redhat was in the $5k a server 
range.  This is not what an ordinary person can afford
for a home server.

The program is only up to 0.88 something.  It doesn't look like it's 
that out of date.

Heh, I just spent a part of this morning chatting with a local DSL ISP
owner about bandwidth abusers.

He's is trying to manage people using 1.5Mbs service full bore for 24x7
at $18.00/month.  

However if you buy a T1 from him, he's happy to give you all of the
1.5Mbs that you can handle....

0.65 was released in November, 2003. I'll leave it to you to read the 
current ChangeLog and decide whether or not "it's that out of date."

Like I said, I had a *6-month* outage with a "commercial grade" T1.
Admittedly, it was all in trying to get it installed, but as a
practical matter that wasn't an important distinction.

Also, if you shop around for ISPs, you can find some that will provide
(at least most of) what you are looking for.  Or at least we could.
When I initially replaced the T1 with DSL, we asked for and got 2
class Cs, reverse DNS delegation, etc.  I don't have the class Cs
anymore, but the rest is pretty much intact.

It is certainly possible to spend 10x as much and get the last 2% of
performance or reliability.  The question becomes, in a particular
application, whether the last 2% is worth the 10x.  It might be.  Or
it might not be.

Depending on the use you're looking for, you might look at Verizon's 
FIOS, which is being deployed in Washington County. It has higher speeds 
than anything realistically available for a home user, though obviously 
not as much control as a T1.

The Sangoma T1 cards cost about $600.  Put that in a Linux firewall

are for business where down time is important.  it is cheaper to use DSL 
to your place for email amd web access but have some isp host your website.

   I can convert a pdf file to text using pdftotext. However, I don't know how
to extract all the embedded graphics separate from the text. I'd greatly
appreciate a pointer to some docs that will tell me how to do this.

   Perhaps converting first from pdf2ps, then extracting the graphics from
that?

Thanks,

Please read what I said.

I said it would be *extremely* difficult to do. I most certainly did not
say impossible. You're correct that there are quite a few programming
languages in existance today, however; try listing the _general_
_purpose_ programming languages in major usage today. At the scripting
level, Bourne shell, Perl, Python and BASIC (meaning VB) are the only
serious ones. Java covers the intermediate level, then C and C++ are the
only serious contenders at the low-level.

So you're suggesting that Trend Micro attempt to create a strong
challenger in a group of less than ten? In fact since they'd be doing
low-level programming they'd need to create a new language in a field
consisting of two, and they're very closely related. All of this for
*one* program? They'd need to spend a great deal more time on the
language/compiler than on writing the original program. It would cost a
fraction of the time to simply port the entire program.

Entirely possible, but it would be ludicrus to spend the required time to
do it.

The programs that truely only work on one distribution are vanishingly
rare. Certainly many programs are only /packaged/ for one distribution,
but that is not a significant barrier.

Anti-viral programs aren't needed for Linux itself, Linux is not an easy
target. A number of other companies *do* offer anti-viral software for
Linux. These are the enterprise versions though, scanning e-mail for
EvilOS virii that might pass through a server.

Please state the relevance of this. In addition to the problems above, it
sounds like you're severely underrating humans. The human brain is an
incredibly powerful pattern matching machine. Even if they don't disclose
details of their new programming language, people will figure it out at
which point, what was the point of this exercise?

An anti-viral program isn't merely a DB access program. Their crown
jewels isn't just the patterns, the pattern matching algorithms are a
significant part too.

Again, relevance? Notice that RH Enterprise is very definitely available
for free as White Box Linux. Notice their target market. They're charging
_companies_ lots of money to _guarentee_ their system will crash less
than once every five years. I imagine you're willing to deal with a
system that needs to be rebooted once a month, for big servers that is
too often. If you're just dealing with your desktop, then you're going to
go with cheaper options.

Depends on your definition of stable. Companies tend to be buying
contracts that guarentee support for 3-5 years after the OS is released.
Fedora is ludicrously unqualified by this standard.

Have you priced the Enterprise versions of other OSes? They're paying for
support, not the software itself. They're not targeting ordinary people.
If you're paying $100K/year to Oracle for software and support, $5K/year
for the OS is easy.

Comcast offers business connections with these characteristics, too.  
That's what we went with.  Still DHCP, though.

"Bandwidth abuse" really only comes into play if the connection isn't 
advertised "unlimited bandwidth."  If he doesn't want people using 
their connection, it should be against the AUP and enforced as 
such...

Hello friends,

   Is there a common way to re-initiate a file that you have added or
edited.  My real time example is the .bashrc file in my home directory
that I added an alias or two to.  What or where do I find instructions
on how to get the system to know that I edited it, or say, any other
file like that?

I discovered this one just the other day. In the tutorial for installing the 
CAD program I'm trying, the writer described making changes to .bashrc. He 
instructed me to run:

source bashrc

after saving the changes. 

I tried looking it up in "A Practical Guide to Linux" by Mark G. Sobell, the 
text used when I took a Linux class a few years ago at Clackamas Community 
College. The index for "source" sent me to . (dot) source, which sent me to . 
(dot). Until I finally found out that there is a command called dot (.), I 
was a bit confused. Here's some of what the book has to say:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running .bash_profile with the . (Dot) Command

After you edit your .bash_profile file to change the values of keyword shell 
variables, you do not have to wait until the next time you log in to put the 
changes into effect. You can run .bash_profile with the . (dot) builtin. As 
with all other commands, the . must be followed by a SPACE on the command 
line. Using the . builtin is similar to running a shell script, except that 
the . command runs the script as part of the current process. Consequently, 
when you use . to run a script from your login shell, changes you make to the 
variable from within the script affect the login shell. You can use the . 
command to run any shell script, not just .bash_profile, but there may be 
undesirable side effects (such as having the value of shell variables you 
rely on changed). If you ran .bash_profile as a regular shell script and did 
not use the . builtin, the new variables would be in effect only in the 
subshell running the script.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I assume that there will be more experienced responses that will explain the 
difference between .bash_profile, .bashrc, and .profile, but I think the 
process is still valid. I put some environment variable assignments 
in .bashrc and ran source .bashrc. The assignments were made, and I could see 
the results with echo $VARIABLE.

Let's here from them then. ( At the next advanced topics meeting? (only 
kind of kidding))

I still haven't managed to find a definitive answer about where $PATH is 
supposed to be set.  Between the bash info page, the unison docs, ssh, 
and debian's /etc/profile, I really don't know what is supposed to be 
happening.  I can say that you have to be careful about this sort of 
thing or your $PATH will continue to grow:
  PATH=$PATH:$HOME/my_extra_path/

Anyway, when you login to the console, .bash_profile and /etc/profile 
get run, but never again (I think.)  E.g. if  you are in X, 
your .bash_profile won't get run every time you start an xterm, 
but .bash_rc will.  But, when you do 'ssh localhost' .bash_profile gets 
run.

I'm pretty sure that's why .bash_profile sources .bashrc.

To make things even more complicated, when you run a command over ssh, 
your .bash_profile doesn't get loaded (which is why the unison docs are 
complaining about /etc/profile and .bash_profile being the wrong place 
to set the PATH variable.  I'm sure you could find a similar problem 
with 'rsync --rsh=ssh' if you were running a special rsync.

Now that you think that .bashrc is the place to set your path, put 
'PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.bin/"' in there and do something like:

  bash
  bash
  bash
  echo $PATH

If your $PATH contains four ~/.bin entries then something is wrong.  I 
solved this by doing something like this in /etc/bash.bashrc

  # notice that $PATH is not part of the PATH
  export PATH="$HOME/.bin/:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11"

IIRC, redhat had a pathmunge function in /etc/bashrc that added the new 
directories only if they weren't already in there.

Because /etc/profile sources /etc/bash.bashrc, there isn't a whole lot 
of use to setting the $PATH in there (but that seems to be what debian 
does lately (although it's been a while since I hacked it to taste.))

Don't forget ~/.bash_logout, which really only needs to say 'clear'.

That's great.  I swear it used to be >10ms, but they may have better tech
nowadays.  It was never due to propagation delay, but some error
checking/line conditioning I'd have to imagine.

Not that shell questions wouldn't be a great topic, but the bash(1) 
man page has a fine INVOCATION section that talks about the 
circumstances under which the various environment files are used.

I wrap my environment variable stuff with an ifdef.  I don't know that
this is the correct way to do this, but it solved most of these issues
for me.  Below is a heavily edited version of my .bashrc.

   The message could not be delivered for some reason. Usually, it's related
to the server at the far end.

   There's something in the wrappers or headers that could not be read. Again,
it's probably at Road Runner's end because you're not seeing this from other
recipients.

   The 400 series of smtp codes means "temporary"; the 500 series is
"permanent".

   Your MTA kept trying for the standard five days but could not have the
other end accept it.

   Have you tried sending it again?

   I've seen this when I've made a typo in the address.

   If the user's mailbox is full, you'll get a message to that effect. If the
user no longer has an account there, the return message will indicate this,
too. If your address has no errors, forward the rejection message to
'postmaster at mgw.rr.com' and ask them to look for a reason and let you know.

HTH,

Rich

Hm, my DSL-Only isn't so good:

$ ping 63.105.18.1 
PING 63.105.18.1 (63.105.18.1) 56(84) bytes of data.

I never really noticed because I don't play latency-sensitive games (but
I have used VoIP a little and not really noticed).

Road Runner has had some odd policies and implementations in the past,
although I cannot recall exactly what.  I also seem to recall them
harboring spammers too.  I wouldn't be surprised if they were doing
something screwy.

Wow.  When did bash get a decent manpage?  IIRC, I used to just get sent 
to 'info bash' (where I would then proceed to get absolutely lost.)

This even explains the behavior when you run a command over ssh (the 
part about 'remote shell daemon'.)  But, it still doesn't explain 
why /etc/profile contains the PATH=... statement on debian.

Why are you being a troll?  Prove that I think I know more than you do.  
Wait a minute, I don't care about this.  I just would like to see 
programs like PC-Cilin work with versions of Linux that are more 
commonly found on the average person's Linux server/laptop/desktop.  
Maybe PC-Cilin should be sold as a CD bootable program that can 
scan both Windows and Linux systems for viruses simultaneously.  
It should be easy for Trend Micro to add PC-Cilin to something 
like Knoppix.  If I truly think I know more than everyone else 
on here, why post to this list at all?  It saddens me that the 
average Linux user is getting left behind by Trend Micro.  The 
average Linux server enthusiast can't afford Redhat Enterprise 
Linux.  Perhaps a class system is forming between those who can
afford a decent Linux system and those who can't.  If so, that's
unfortunate.

Eric,

   The O'Reilly & Associates book on the bash shell has been valuable to me.
You might also find it useful.

   Different shells use different files. Most linux distributions have
.profile (used, IIRC, by csh/tcsh) as well as .bash_profile (used by bash).
There are other differences, too, that allow you to select the shell of your
choice and still have the environment in which you prefer to work.

If it's a PATH meant for all users, I'd say /etc/profile is the best
place.  This should make your path elements available to your init
scripts, as well as to all shells.

But anything in that $PATH is not available to a remote shell.  So, if 
'command' is in /usr/site/bin and you try to run it with a non-login 
ssh shell, it won't be found.

  ssh localhost command

I see.  I had to look into that "non-login shell" business.  The ssh man
page really isn't clear on how that works, is it?  Looks like
/etc/profile should be there for all SHELLS, but when you specify the
"command" to ssh, you don't get a real shell.  It's more like a
membrane, with just the default PATH.  On my server, though, I also get
a number of bashish variables.  Now I'm as perplexed as you are!

Perhaps you'll have to source /etc/profile as part of your command:

$ ssh localhost ". /etc/profile; command"

Seems lame, but it also seems to work.

HTH,

Yeah.  That's really lame.  (Not that it's your fault.  It's just lame.)

I swear this man page wasn't this good about a year ago...

<quote "man bash">
Bash  attempts  to  determine when it is being run by the remote shell
daemon, usually rshd.  If bash determines it is being run by rshd,  it       
reads  and  executes  commands from /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc, 
if these files exist and are readable.
</quote>

AFAICT, this what you get when you run 'ssh localhost command'.

Since my /etc/profile runs /etc/bash.bashrc (if $PS1), I figure 
that /etc/bash.bashrc is the place to set the PATH.  Of course, I don't 
use non-bash shells, so there are probably some holes in that line of 
thinking (does ssh only use bash? (I haven't messed with the shell 
entry in passwd))  Like I said, it might be a good AT topic.

I believe ssh runs the shell defined in /etc/passwd for that user.

I'll second that surmise. My niece has a RR account. Lately, any mail
sent directly to her from a non-RR address is never delivered and no
bounce is generated. However, if I reply to an email she sends me - that
gets delivered. She's not technical. I do not envy her task in dealing
with the admins trying to sift out that cruft.

Subject: [PLUG] New List Member and Laptop
Message-ID: <42726FB5.7307.CEA9B9A9@localhost>

After some research on the net I have just ordered a Compaq 
R4000 laptop. It will have:

Athlon 64 4000
1 Gb RAM
80 Gb 5400 rpm HD
Realtek 10/100/1000
Wireless, but I forget which brand (Intel, I think)
Conexant faxmodem
ATI Radeon Xpress 200M

I tried out its previous version at Fry's (R3470) with Windows XP 
and it could eat all the other laptops in the store for lunch. So I 
figure with 64-bit Linux it should kick serious butt.

My intention is to leave Windows XP on the hard disk for the time 
being, but never even boot it up. I'll squeeze it down to, say, 10-15 
Gb, then make another 10-15 Gb partition for Linux, leaving the 
remainder for data. After I get Linux running perfectly so I know I'll 
never need XP, I'll nuke it completely and use the space to install a 
different distro. That way I'll never have to activate XP, and thus it 
should be easy to sell the license for a few bux to recover at least 
part of the Windows tax.

However, my knowledge of Linux is rather limited. Several years 
ago I installed Corel Linux (when it was all the rage) on an old 
computer and played around with it some. That's all I know about 
Linux. I realize Linux has matured enormously since then, but I fear 
I am going to need help getting it installed. I'm especially worried 
about the video.

So I googled around until I found PLUG. I note on the website that 
there are monthly Clinic meetings. That may be just what I need. 
But, considering that there are a couple other out of date things on 
the website, I felt it best to ask someone if the Clinic meetings are 
still being held. And if so, when the next meetings will be (May 21, 
June 18?).

HP says it will be built/shipped by May 20 and 5-7 days for 
shipping.

If you haven't picked a distro yet, you may want to check out some of

After some research on the net I have just ordered a Compaq R4000 laptop. It
will have:

Athlon 64 4000
1 Gb RAM
80 Gb 5400 rpm HD
Realtek 10/100/1000
Wireless, but I forget which brand (Intel, I think) Conexant faxmodem ATI
Radeon Xpress 200M

I tried out its previous version at Fry's (R3470) with Windows XP and it
could eat all the other laptops in the store for lunch. So I figure with
64-bit Linux it should kick serious butt.

My intention is to leave Windows XP on the hard disk for the time being, but
never even boot it up. I'll squeeze it down to, say, 10-15 Gb, then make
another 10-15 Gb partition for Linux, leaving the remainder for data. After
I get Linux running perfectly so I know I'll never need XP, I'll nuke it
completely and use the space to install a different distro. That way I'll
never have to activate XP, and thus it should be easy to sell the license
for a few bux to recover at least part of the Windows tax.

However, my knowledge of Linux is rather limited. Several years ago I
installed Corel Linux (when it was all the rage) on an old computer and
played around with it some. That's all I know about Linux. I realize Linux
has matured enormously since then, but I fear I am going to need help
getting it installed. I'm especially worried about the video.

So I googled around until I found PLUG. I note on the website that there are
monthly Clinic meetings. That may be just what I need. 
But, considering that there are a couple other out of date things on the
website, I felt it best to ask someone if the Clinic meetings are still
being held. And if so, when the next meetings will be (May 21, June 18?).

HP says it will be built/shipped by May 20 and 5-7 days for shipping.

Quite likely the place you want, normally 3rd Saturday of the month,
should be May 21st.

Laptops tend to be tricky to deal with, they often have all sorts of
bizzare hardware. Generally getting a basic installation with almost any
distribution will be easy, but tuning it to the hardware may be quite
difficult. Builtin wireless can be very tricky.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0504301132300.21448@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I had -- supposedly still have -- a directory called /data2/winstuff/ which
is the shared directory between linux and the virtual win98 in VMware. I
cannot see it using 'ls -la /data2/', the backup software reports 'bru:
[I013] "/data2/winstuff": can't stat: errno = 5, Input/output error' and
trying to retore it fails with the same error. So, I assumed that it somehow
became wiped out. However, when I try to recreate the directory I see,
'mkdir: cannot create directory /data2/winstuff': File exists'.

   This is a new one on me! It's there, but not visible:

[root at salmo ~]# ls /data2/
ls: /data2/winstuff: Input/output error
GRASS_projects/       grass-postgres/               rivers-catchments/

grass-applications/   oregon-water-resources.usgs/

   What tool exists that will expose this directory and show me what
permissions or ownership got screwed up?

   A perfect linux learning moment without which I could have done just fine
today.

     I should have mentioned that I get the same results (or lack thereof)
when using the '-a' flag with ls. That is, 'ls -a', or 'ls -la' indicates the
directory is there but not readable/visible.

Does stat(1) show anything? E.g.,

# stat /usr/bin
   File: `/usr/bin'
   Size: 69632           Blocks: 152        IO Block: 4096   directory

P.S -- stat is distributed with the GNU coreutils package, so it 
should be available on just about any reasonably up-to-date Linux box.

Paul,

stat: cannot stat /data2/winstuff': Input/output error

   Something is badly broken with this one directory. I don't know just when,
and I certainly don't know why. My google searches turned up nothing
relevant. This is a real puzzler.

Thanks,

   Aha! I now know what happened, but not sure why and I certainly don't know
how to gracefully recover.

   When I use the 'mount' command I see this:

none on /data2/winstuff type smbfs (0)

which tells me that when I was trying to get vmware to see the share I
somehow managed to munge it from reiserfs to smbfs!

   So, my questions to you SysAdmin gurus are: 1) Can I change this filesystem
type without losing the contained data? and B) What is the recommended
protocol for doing so?

Thanks,

Rich

I don't know of any Lisp-specific courses in the Portland area. What
specific applications are you interested in? There are a couple of good
books on algorithmic composition that are Lisp based -- Rick Taube's
"Notes from the Meta Level" and David Cope's "The Algorithmic Composer".

Between the two comes this Speakeasy hop:

There was a movement on comp.lang.lisp a while ago to start local
Lispnik groups.  I'd be interested.  

I went down to Powells Technical Books to look at the new _Practical
Common Lisp_, but was slightly disappointed by the typography/artistic
design of the book.  Specifically, the margins weren't generous enough
and there was excessive use of bold in the headings.  I don't buy a
lot of books these days anyway, and aesthetics are important to me in
programming.  It bothers me to buy "ugly" books.  Lot's of beautiful
Lisp books, most of which I've got already.

Careful on the quoting, people, somewhere along the lines someone 
stripped out two levels of quote attribution and now it looks like 
Steven Raymond got my ping times.

No, but that is not what you've got. Take a second look at that line from
`mount`. Notice the device, "none". This is characteristic of network and
pseudo filesystems. smbfs would be the SMB filesystem, like what Samba
provides. From the description though this sounds unlikely, try seeing
what the kernel says, `cat /proc/mounts`.

My first guess though would be filesystem damage, umount and run `fsck`.

What's the content of your /proc/mounts?  What's your fstab/auto.*
look like (how are you mounting it)?

Can you unmount it safely?  If you can umount the point, and it does
disappear from the mount list I'd back up the partition if you have
space (dd if=/dev/device of=/tmp/filename bs=4096) run a read-only
fsck (reiserfsck --fix-fixable /mountpoint) on it the original and
check/fix the contents for consistency.
