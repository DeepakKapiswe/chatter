Subject: [PLUG] Duplex card scanner
Message-ID: <20121107151010.GB29960@gate.kl-ic.com>

I would like a duplex card scanner for linux - pop in the card,
get front and back images.  The sane project only lists a couple
of old simplex scanners.   Any suggestions?

Failing that, I can build a kludge with a couple of cheap
digital cameras with macro lenses in a fixture with a push
button.  Any suggestions for cheap cameras that will take
a picture and upload it on external command?  Perhaps all
I need is a single webcam with the right lensing, a pair
of 45 degree mirrors to see both sides at once, followed
by some image correction in software, which I might be
able to do with PovRay.

Message-ID: <509A911B.8010204@cloud85.net>

I've just read read the manpage of debmirror. It seems to 
hint there may be a simple solution to my problem.

I *DO NOT* have good internet connectivity.
I *DO* have the 8 DVD set of Debian 6.0.5.
I want all of the deb files from the set on a 64GB flash 
drive in a format/structure acceptable to apt-get or synaptic.

I'm currently wading through descriptions of the Debian 
repository to be able to do it manually. I suspect there may 
already be a suitable script.

Pointers please. TIA

Subject: [PLUG] problems creating logical volume (LVM)
Message-ID: <CADJK7_SKWxuD_jhhSrXSJfaKGpEv9ziRVet0fLPrtPwGicDTBg@mail.gmail.com>

First off -
Bummed that I missed the PLUG talk on LVM - if I'd realized I was going to
need it so soon, I would have gone out of my way to attend! In any case,
Brian Martin's post [1] on the subject is a great read.

So I'm trying to create a logical volume in a volume group that stripes
across a few of Amazon's EBS volumes. When I try this with a couple 1 GB
volumes, it works fine. When I try this with five 1 TB volumes, I'm seeing
a strange error.

$ vgcreate ebs_vg /dev/sdp1 /dev/sdp2 /dev/sdp3 /dev/sdp4 /dev/sdp5
$ vgdisplay /dev/ebs_vg
  --- Volume group ---
  VG Name               ebs_vg
  System ID
  Format                lvm2
  Metadata Areas        5
  Metadata Sequence No  1
  VG Access             read/write
  VG Status             resizable
  MAX LV                0
  Cur LV                0
  Open LV               0
  Max PV                0
  Cur PV                5
  Act PV                5
  VG Size               4.88 TiB
  PE Size               4.00 MiB
  Total PE              1279995
  Alloc PE / Size       0 / 0
  Free  PE / Size       1279995 / 4.88 TiB
$ lvcreate -l 100%VG -n ebs_lv -i2 ebs_vg -I256
  Rounding size (1279995 extents) up to stripe boundary size (1279996
extents)
  Volume group "ebs_vg" has insufficient free space (1279995 extents):
1279996 required.


I'm expecting it to be smart enough to make it the right size by using the
"100%" for the logical extents. If I try to manually set this to the number
it seems to want, I still get the error:

$ lvcreate -l 1279995 -n ebs_lv -i2 ebs_vg -I256
  Rounding size (1279995 extents) up to stripe boundary size (1279996
extents)
  Volume group "ebs_vg" has insufficient free space (1279995 extents):
1279996 required.

Anyone see anything glaring that I'm missing?

Thanks!

Answering my own question here: I was failing to change the number of
stripes form 2 to 5. This works:

lvcreate -l100%VG -n ebs_lv -i5 ebs_vg -I256

I know it's not the "proper" way to do it, but if you just want to get the
job done and figure out a better way later, just copy all the packages to
the root of the USB then mount it as /var/cache/apt/archives and you should
be good to go.

Of course, I am sure someone knows a better way, but sometimes the fastest
way is all that is needed.

A bit of googling lead me to this page that describes how to create a
signed local repository.
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?s=7cfc0f038cfe90434538e2fe367b0c65&t=1090731

This page has an explanation of how to create a local repository that is
NOT signed but explains step-by-step what the commands are doing. About mid
way down in the comments, there are a couple of scripts that readers have
submitted that may be what you are looking for...
http://odzangba.wordpress.com/2006/10/13/how-to-build-local-apt-repositories/

Hope this helps. I may have to do this myself, just to speed up the updates
on my machines...

I how quickly I could get something up,  the Debian 
installer already will scan all the DVDs available for apt 
to request the required DVD. But it's not a elegant solution.

Subject: [PLUG] KDE4 question
Message-ID: <509D4AC6.8080106@fredjame.cnc.net>

My wife and I both run KDE4, but my machine doesn't have enough of 
something to run quite the way hers does.

I am quite happy with mine ... she is not at all happy with hers. What 
she does not like?

When her cursor moves over an icon in the task tray (at the bottom of 
the screen) ... say the office icon for example, and she has more than 
one document open at the time ... the current document she was looking 
at is no longer full size, but all of her open documents now appear on 
the screen as smaller versions of themselves.

This doesn't happen on mine, and we would like to know how to stop it on 
hers.

Thank you
Regards
Fred James

That sounds like the [present windows] option. Do the following to
change/disable this option...

[system settings] --> [workspace behavior] --> [screen edges]

there will be a picture of a screen with boxes on each side and each
corner. click on the corner that is causing the problems and from the
dropdown menu, select [no action] then apply the settings. That should fix
it.

http://www.sane-project.org/sane-mfgs.html#SCANNERS lists many newer 
scanner with ADFduplex attachments

I have had good luck with HP scanners under Linux in the past.  I 
currently use HP Laserjet Pro M1212nf MFP via TCP/IP on sane/hplip (no 
duplexing attachment though).   Scanning is supported with a free 
proprietary plugin in SANE. I scan 2 sided stuff by just setting up for 
multipage and flipping it over. For < full page I just set the scan 
dimensions(some backends can detect size automagically).

The link above shows quite a few scanner with ADFduplex support (status: 
complete). Fancy duplexing ones tend to be pricey:

HP Scanjet 5590 Digital Flatbed Scanner  (see link above)

I would get a full size scanner and if needed just crop/OCR the images 
producedand not one of the limited special purpose business card ones. 
Also, this claims linux support:

http://www.irislink.com/c2-2203-189/IRISCard-Anywhere-5--Scan-your-business-cards--Organize-and-manage-your-contacts.aspx 


(at least for the scanner portion).  If you find a good USB scanner and 
can detemine the chipset used, you may be able to locate a sane backend 
and then adjust "/lib/udev/rules.d/80-libsane.rules" to add your scanner.

Subject: [PLUG] Noisy mp3s
Message-ID: <50A54A93.8020705@comcast.net>

I have some mp3 recordings to transcribe. For some reason these 
recordings have some noise in them. What it sounds like is the noise 
left over when I use a filter in Audacity to remove some noise. (I know, 
that's a bit weird, but maybe some of you who use the Audacity filter 
will recognize the effect.) Anyway, the other weird part of this is that 
if I listen to them on my wife's Win7 machine, they are clear as a bell. 
They are also clear as a bell if I listen to them on my laptop running 
XP. The same laptop hardware running Ubuntu 10.4 has the noise.

Not all mp3 files on my Ubuntu machine exhibit this problem. So far, 
it's just the two. They both were recorded phone conversations, but I 
don't know the recording technology used. It could have been a hand held 
recorder sitting next to a speaker phone -- that's the usual technique 
-- or it could have been a fancy phone system that has the ability to 
record a call. The call is between two offices of a big, east coast 
consulting company that could very well have that technology.

Anyway, does anyone have any ideas about why the sound on my Linux 
machines show this noise while the sound on two Winders machines does 
not? And more important, is there anything I can do about it, other than 
listening on XP while typing on Ubuntu?

Thanks.

It certainly will, God willing and the creek don't rise.

I have Xubuntu 12.10 in 32- and 64-bit ISOs, waiting to burn for you.

Richard,

While I don't have a solution to your immediate problem, I can tell you,
I've had much better luck with the sound quality of FLAC files, as opposed
to the lossy lower quality file formats like mp3, aac, & even ogg vorbis.

Whenever I can choose FLAC, I do so, whether it's recording, ripping,
buying, downloading, (in  any situation).  Also, FLAC is a free codec, like
ogg vorbis & Theora.

Cheers,

Elcaset

Interesting. I don't have the option of directing the format in which 
the recording is made, though.

Hard to say what this might be.  The only thing I can think of off
the top of my head is that you've got clipping somewhere.  Try
loading one of the errant files into Audacity and check for
clipping.  If it's there, use Audacity reduce the audio amplitude;
that should clear up the problem.

Hope this help,

No, I just mean, in the future, whenever possible, you're better off using
FLAC than the other audio formats.

Rich, what linux audio player are you using? You said you "clean up" the 
mp3 in audacity so is the sound quality bad in audacity or just another 
player? As Dale mentioned, clipping could be a reason. Also, if you 
didn't set up the noise filter properly you can have introduced some 
static that depends on the mp3 codec and player (Fraunhofer licensed vs. 
LAME for example).   Also, you may wish to convert to a lossless format 
(wav or flac) before editing in audacity.  Also, consider mp3 bit rate, 
CBR vs VBR....

Bingo. I had to check the box, "Show Clipping" in the View menu, and it 
was obvious. Clipping was present every time one of the speakers spoke. 
I used the amplify effect to reduce the amplitude from 0.0 to -1.4 and 
the clipping disappeared. However, while quieter, the noise was still 
present in the saved mp3 file.

I'm using a program called a python program called Transcribe. I get the 
same noise when using Movie Player. I'm guessing it uses the same 
underlying sound library as Transcribe, which uses gstreamer. 
Interestingly, though, the noise is not present when I play the audio 
with Audacity.

I gave a wrong impression. I did not use Audacity to "clean up" this 
particular mp3. I have used Audacity for that purpose in the past, but 
not this time. It didn't occur to me to try since the noise sounds like 
an effect I get sometimes when filtering with Audacity.

LAME is what's installed here -- at least for exporting mp3s from Audacity.

This proved very useful. I imported the mp3 into Audacity at the 
beginning of this exercise (responding to these e-mails). Since it was 
already there, I exported the file as flac -- after the amplitude 
reduction. Now it plays nice and quiet in Transcribe and Movie Player.

Thanks to both of you for your helpful ideas.

Dear Plug clinic,

I don't like my Ubuntu 12.something.  I can't figure out what programs
are on my machine.  There is no menu.  I want to go back to 10.04.  Or
I want to put on Mint or Debian on my desktop computer.  I really
don't relish hauling my desktop computer down to the clinic, with my
monitor, printer, et. al.  Can I get help backing up my files, blowing
away Ubuntu 12.something, and putting Debian on my machine, and make
sure I can surf the internet, and be able to print, all in the span of
4 hours.  I've had issues with all these things in the past, and each
time it took an inordinate amount of time.

On second thought, I may be getting a laptop, and putting Linux from
Scratch, or Debian on it, or whatever more sophisticated people than I
suggest.  Once I get that working to my satisfaction, I'll blow away
my Ubuntu 12.something.  Unless there some quick trick to go back to
10.04, I'll leave well enough alone.  Is there a mechanism to roll
back the operating system, so to speak?

Sincerely,
Victor Soich

I hear you about Ubuntu 12.something. I suspect your complaint is more
about Gnome 3 than Ubuntu, at least, that's my complaint. Some love
the new look, and others hate it.  As for rolling back the OS, that is
not generally possible. But, as I just said, I think your problem is
more with the desktop than the version of the OS.

I might suggest Xubuntu instead of Ubuntu. Xubuntu has the Xfce desktop
instead of Gnome 3, and it looks and acts a lot more like Gnome 2.

I also suggest you explore other distros such as Fedora and OpenSuse.

I have live CDs of all the above except Debian. Debian is designed to
be installed over the net, so there is just a very small bootable CD.
Installing over the net is not a good idea at the Clinic due to limited
bandwidth.

Bring whatever you want to the Clinic and we'll burn CDs and play
around so you can see alternatives.

Debian is happy to dual boot with debian or Windows. I don't 
see why it wouldn't be happy to dual boot with Ubuntu.
One of my installs has the default  install of "every thing 
PLUS kitchen sink" ;/ It is just under 4 GB.

Oh , it's definitely _designed_ for internet connected 
install. But it will install without difficulty from either 
the 1st CD/DVD of the set or the LiveCD. With network 
physically disconnected, it will merrily ask about a half 
dozen network related questions which you ignore by pressing 
<ENTER>. It will then divine that [non-existent ;] network 
could not be configure and will present a menu including a 
choice to configure network at a later time.

I'm in rural SW MO at the end of a 56k dial-up connection. 
Bought a set of DVDs and have had no problems when making 
reasonably normal installs. In pursuing my personal 
definition of a minimal install I've exposed a few bugs.

OK, I'm downloading the live CD ISOs. Oddly, the web site says they
will fit on a CD, yet each ISO is around 1 GB. Maybe they have special
CDs in Debian-land.

I forgot a question. The ISOs are on this web site:

http://www.debian.org/CD/live/

Where it says they are "hybrid" ISOs, and then they offer alternative
images in case your BIOS cannot boot from a "hybrid" ISO on a USB
stick. 

What is a "hybrid" ISO?

That doesn't sound right.
I just went looking and 
http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/6.0.6/i386/iso-cd/ shows 
all the CDs in the 640MB range.

Are you getting "testing" rather than "stable"? I vaguely 
recall some discussion about what would have to go to allow 
what the developers considered an adequate minimal install 
on one CD. I didn't follow the discussion as downloading 
isn't practical due to dial-up connection.

Gnome3 or Unity. It should be possible to use the Ubuntu Software Center to
install Gnome Classic, which would return the familiar look and feel
without downgrading the OS, or even reinstalling. The challenge is centered
around how much customization has been done to the current setup. Switching
desktop managers is kind of a big deal, so we won't know how successful
this will be until we try it. Since the plan is to wipe/reinstall anyway,
it's worth a try.

Victor,

One thing I've found is the reliance on the menu.  And I should know
because I'm one of them.  Trying to remember the app names can be
frustrating but I can remember which submenu it's on.

In that regard, I've installed AWN (Avant Window Navigator) which give me
a Macintosh like look (along with Unity).

Maybe you want to take a look at some of the screen shots of that and see
if that fits your bill rather than a full re-install or trying to "fix"
it.

I am downloading via torrent, and I got the torrent files from here:

http://www.debian.org/CD/live/

That is a different web site than the one you cite. And yes, it says
they are the stable release, version 6.05. I wonder what is going on.

That makes a difference. The first CD of >40 gives a rather 
minimal system.
I just did a install fro that CD and it is VERY minimal.

You're asking a newbie ;/  I  know only that it is supposed

The LiveCD has a more representative sample of applications 
an average user is likely to install.

Victor,

Been through that already, posted my own rant. :-/

Try 'apt-get install gnome-session-fallback'. It should restore the mostly 
familiar Gnome interface from 10.04.

AFAIK, a hybrid ISO is an image that can be both burned to optical media
(CD, DVD) and written directly to flash drive to create bootable media.

We have a node with a desktop machine they had set up as a web-surfing
kiosk, which got zombified (udp port 16471, iirc, some kind of
click-fraud according to random google results).  I suggested the node
host install some kind of read-only live-cd-ish linux desktop image on
the box.  They said yes.  Now I need to find one for them.  Any
suggestions?  Extra weight goes to any actual experiences.

Hi Victor,

Give the live DVD, (or live USB, or SD card) of Linux Mint 13 KDE a try.
It is LTS (Long Term support) with 5 years of support.  Linux Mint 13 KDE
is what several of my friends & myself, use and love.

GNOME fallback mode has just been eliminated from any future versions of
GNOME. A lot of people don't like Unity, & GNOME3 is so unpopular, that THE
GNOME project is going to try to make GNOME 4 more traditional like GNOME 2.

The 2011 Members' Choice Awards from LinuxQuestions.org has honored the KDE
Community with "Best Desktop Environment of the Year".  "
http://dot.kde.org/2012/03/05/kde-best-desktop-environment-year"

Cheers,

Elcaset

Subject: [PLUG] Are "standard security procedures" an oxymoron?
Message-ID: <20121120195841.GC13380@gate.kl-ic.com>

A friend taught me that con men exploit smart people more easily
than dumb people, because there are fewer ways to be smart than
dumb, making smart people (and their blind spots) more predictable.

I am helping a friend set up security procedures for a business
in a highly regulated industry, with acres of forms and checklists
and standards that are supposed to result in secure systems. 
Many look like brainfarts from academics working from unproven
hypotheses, who haven't collected the histories of real exploits,
much less fought an exploit themselves.  

Standarized security systems probably have standardized holes,
suitable for automated exploitation.  Instead, should we
construct vivid and instructive stories, and count on the
creativity of end users to develop and elaborate a varied
(and difficult to exploit) set of solutions? 

Or do semi-informed people tend to make the same predictable
mistakes more often than standard security procedures result
in widespread identical holes?

Build a kludge, or buy a black box?

If the industry is highly regulated, you may not have a ton of choice
in the matter. You may have audit requirements that need to be met
whether you like it or not for things like PCI or HIPAA.

I think defense in depth is a very important concept. A lot of people
do rely on the same products and solutions, that's true. Hopefully
your security design doesn't put you in a position where one
standardized hole leaves you too vulnerable.

There are essentially three security tasks, each one more difficult 
than the next:

  1. Secure your network exposure.

Most IT work tends to begin and end here, but it's actually about the 
easiest layer of security to get right. The mantras are well known: 
defense in depth, timely patching, penetration testing, configuration 
management, firewalls, intrusion detection, etc.

  2. Secure your physical exposure.

Physical protection of assets is typically more difficult, if for no 
other reason than it's expensive and the ROI will never be realized if 
things go well. It involves storage crypto, really good locks and 
alarms (or an isolated island headquaters), fire suppression, solid 
electrical and network connections, insurance, tested 
business-continuity and/or disaster-recovery plans, redundant 
hardware, etc.

  3. Secure your people.

This is easily the hardest security task, and the most likely avenue 
for crooks, vandals, and other ne'er-do-wells. All the network 
and physical security in the world won't keep employees from re-using 
passwords, divulging sensitive information via phishing attacks (or 
even on public mailing lists), using USB sticks of unknown origin, or 
visiting web sites with malicious files.

> Standarized security systems probably have standardized holes, 
> suitable for automated exploitation.

Good user training is the best response to attacks, automated or 
targeted. Users who can identify and report suspicious e-mail 
messages, service behavior, and even social interactions are the 
difference between a well-administered network and a secure network.

There are many different kinds of security, but I'll assume you're referring 
to computers and related systems.

Subject: [PLUG] How to clean USB jack
Message-ID: <20121121170947.1a8fd2cb@mailhost.pdx.edu>

My Samsung Galaxy S2 battery has suddenly started draining within a
couple of hours, even with no phone usage. I have several suggestions
from Phandroid forums to try, but one of them seemed a good idea even
if it is not the source of the problem, that is, clean the USB jack on
the bottom of the phone. 

The phone uses a micro USB form factor, which is extremely tiny. To
peer inside it I need a strong light, my geezer glasses *and* a
magnifying glass. 

I am hoping someone has a clever way to clean tiny areas.

While cleaning the USB jack has a small probability of helping,
there are two more likely causes:  Battery failure, and radio
failure in the phone.

I just replaced the battery in my semi-dumb Nokia flip phone,
which used to last a week on a charge (not suprising with 10
calls a month) and recently dropped to a day.  The replacement
worked.  The replacement battery was from a spare/identical
Nokia that I keep around "just in case".  I ordered another
battery via Amazon for $4.


There is a grimmer possibility, a bit technical.  A high
quality cell phone (which nobody makes anymore) would use
a gallium arsenide power amplifier on the radio.  GaAs is
a faster process, so the amplifier does not need to be
pushed as hard to deliver both efficiency and reliability.  

But standard CMOS silicon is cheaper than GaAs, because 99%
of all integrated circuits are made with silicon, and most
of those are CMOS silicon.  Most of the phone is CMOS
silicon, which is great for the processors and memory and
such.  So to save a few pennies per phone, manufacturers
make the power amplifier with CMOS, too.

Whether you use the phone for calls or not, the phone frequently
sends out "registration requests" to cell towers to let the
network know where it is.  If the tower is distant, or you are
in a shielded area, the phone pumps up the transmit power of 
the registration request until the tower hears it.  That means
battery drain, but mostly it means increased stress on the power
amplifier.  If the shielding is a nearby metal table, or other
materials that interfere with the efficiency of the antenna, 
that maximizes the stress.  The stresses can damage transistors
in the CMOS power amplifier, causing them to leak current, even
when the phone is not transmitting.  This leakage can drain
batteries rapidly.  And the power amplifier can't be repaired.

A clever engineer can design a power amplifier, even a CMOS one,
to protect itself from this.  However, few engineers are that
clever, and the ones who are clever usually work for companies
that prefer you buy a new phone every year.  

Until customers make robustness a priority when buying phones,
demand long warranties, and support review sites that do reverse
engineering teardowns and reliability evaluations, the phones
will fail sooner and sooner, because the manufacturers compete
on price and features, not quality.  I'm not holding my breath
for improvements - just buying spares of products that seem 
relatively robust.  

So - good luck on the USB thing, but hope it is the battery, and
that you can get inside to replace it.  Otherwise, assume your
smart phone is more durable than kleenex, less durable than a
hanky.  Try not to put it antenna-side down on metal surfaces.

Hi John,

My Ex was not good for much ;-)
but as an electrical engineer he did teach me this.  Get the disposable 
tiny dental crevice brushes, dip them in alcohol and use in tiny spaces. 
It is helpful if you can dip the "space" in alcohol and swish it around
before and after and of course allow everything 24 hours to dry.....

Peace

True reconciliation is never cheap, for it is based on forgiveness, which
is costly. Forgiveness in turn depends on repentance, which has to be
based on an acknowledgment of what was done wrong, and therefore on
disclosure of the truth. You cannot forgive what you do not know.

As it turns out, the problem is due to some errant process in how the
software works with the hardware. Exactly where I cannot tell, although
an Android expert may be able to sleuth it down. The fix is to remove
the battery and leave the battery out for at least a half hour, then
replace the battery and reboot. I had removed and reinstalled the
battery previously without success, but after leaving it out for half
an hour before rebooting the problem is resolved. I am back to my
normal 12 hours or so per charge.

I bought a spare battery shortly after buying the phone a year ago.
Spare batteries for the SGS2 are about $30. Then again, they are 2150
mah batteries, plus they contain the NFC antenna. Don't ask why Samsung
decided to put the NFC antenna in the battery. Especially considering
that you can't even use NFC with T-Mobile phones yet.

I wonder if this is related to the fact that you have to leave the
battery out for a period of time before the fix works.

I leave the GPS turned on all the time, so the phone is always phoning
home. Yes, I know this means the feds can track me. But it also means
that if I lose the phone I can log in to Where's My Droid from any
networked computer on the planet and get its location within a few
dozen meters. (I have actually done this twice, and both times
recovered the phone.) That's a fair trade-off. Besides, God knows why
the feds would want me, but if they really do want me they can probably
find me without having to track my phone. In fact, they could just call
me and ask me where I am.

>Try not to put it antenna-side down on metal surfaces.

I don't even know where the main antenna on this thing is.

Xubuntu is an excellent Official Community Flavor in fact the folks at
FreeGeek will be transitioning their typically older spec "FreeKBoxes" to
Xubuntu 12.04 next month. Notably though you can easily switch desktop
environments on Ubuntu by simply installing the Desktop Environment of your
choice without the hassle of needing to format or attempt to "roll back" or
migrate data.

Is it wise to add other DEs once Ubuntu 12.04 is installed?

Hey Everybody,

I have a friend who installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on his work desktop PC.
He's spent the last month or more getting his PC set up the way he likes
it.  The problem is, he's having problems with Firefox that I'm not having
on KDE Mint 13 LTS.  Also, he's not liking Unity, in general.  He'd like to
add Kubuntu desktop, or another DE.  He's concerned that this might make
things more likely to break in the long run.  He might be right about
that.  He & I both like to err on the side of caution & stability, using
only LTS releases, & sticking with an install for years, putting a lot of
time & effort into setting up the computer just the way each one of us
likes it.  In other words, not the popular GNU/Linux geek bleeding edge
approach.  What do you all think?

Thanks,

Elcaset

In my experience, adding a DE/WM is not a problem.  Removing one,
on the other hand, can open a large can of worms.  Hideous, ugly,
mutant worms with nasty, sharp teeth and a bad smell.  But if you
never run the DE that you don't like, there shouldn't be any
trouble.  I've run multiple DEs before with not problems.

As for Firefox, you'll have to describe the troubles before we can
help troubleshoot them.  

Just my $0.02.

If you're going to experiment with adding additional desktops or window 
managers (or even new applications that require extensive libs or other 
changes to your existing system) I find it helpful to back up my 
existing system first. On a regular basis, even if I make no significant 
changes to my installation. I use the command line utility dd to make an 
image file of the disk partition containing the system I want to back 
up, along with that hard drive's partition table. Thus:

dd if=/dev/sda of=Ubuntu.boot.mbr bs=512 count=1  #(for the partition table)

dd if=/dev/sda1 of=Ubuntu.img  #(for the partition containing my main 
system)

I keep my HOME directory on a separate partition of that first hard 
drive as well as reserving two other partitions of equal size to the 
first partition on that drive (a WD 120 gig Sata). That way I have two 
extra partitions to use to test new distros as they come along. All 
three installations can use the same HOME directory and files. If I need 
to remove either a distro being tested or restore the main system after 
I screwed something up, I have a known working copy of my everyday 
working system ready to reinstall simply by reversing the dd command thus:

dd if=Ubuntu.img of=/dev/sda1

Keeping the backed up image on a separate physical drive (in my case a 
250 gig WD Sata) also keeps it safe if and when that first hard drive 
goes poof. The above dd commands are predicated on my using a USB or DVD 
live system to log onto that 250 gig WD, which contains the image files.

Hope some or this helps.

Yes, but.

Yes, it can, but you have to set up your backup system correctly.
Read the docs for your favorite backup program CAREFULLY.  Set
everything up, and make SURE that what you want backed up IS
backed up.  At the very least, you want your /home partition, and
any other non-Ubuntu-supplied data you have.  For bare-metal
restores, you're going to need a copy of your master boot
record(s), so that you can re-create your disk partitions, plus
information on filesystems, logical volumes (if used), and so on.

Once you're sure that backups are made correctly, make sure that
you can use the backed-up data to restore your system.  TRY IT AND
MAKE CERTAIN.  I've heard too many stories of outfits that have
faithfully run their backup software, only to find that they
couldn't restore from backups when the inevitable disaster struck.
And trust me, it is inevitable.  Something will go worng somewhere
along the line, and you will have to restore.

Do I make backups?  Yes.  I have a half-terabyte WD MyBook on USB
that I back up to.  I have had to restore from it, too.  Believe
me, I was glad I had it.

Just another $0.02.

Subject: [PLUG] Card Scanner - resolved
Message-ID: <20121125050534.GA25217@gate.kl-ic.com>

I was looking for a duplex (both sides at once) card scanner.
The vast majority are simplex (one sided), and the few that
are duplex seem to be Windoze only.
Consulting  http://www.sane-project.org/lists/sane-mfgs-cvs.html
the one and only "good" simplex (single sided) card scanner
seems to be the Corex Cardscan 800c .  

I attempted to purchase an 800c though eBay for $55, but the
seller is AWOL - 2 weeks after I paid for it, no response to
my emails, and eBay's conflict resolution process hasn't
worked, either.  Oh well.  eBay claims to provide refunds
(after a couple of months of jumping through hoops).  We'll
see if that works.  Otherwise, I've researched out the name
and address of the seller in Texas, and have redneck
relatives living 10 miles away, so ...

The good news is that I purchased an 800c via Craigslist
($99) and just got it working.  It will be hooked up to a
Mac most of the time (and it comes with Mac software as well
as W#@%*!s software), but the sane-cardscan driver is in my
somewhat ancient distro (Scientific Linux 5.6, 2.6.18 kernel).

Out of the box, it worked only as root.  I fixed that by 
adding two lines to /etc/udev/rules.d/60-libsane.rules  :

  # Corex Cardscan 800c
  SYSFS{idVendor}=="08f0", SYSFS{idProduct}=="0005", SYMLINK+="scanner-%k"

With default settings, the results are a little dim, a little
pink, but there are knobs on xsane that can fix this.  It
works well enough for our needs.  The 800c is small, 4x7
inches, USB powered, and just loud enough to let you know
it's working.  Given the $300+ retail price of a new card
scanner plus software, $99 (and same day pickup) is good.

Duplex?  We can run the card through twice.  About two
minutes of extra work a day.

BTW, one of the things we want to copy is customer
driver's licenses (for the picture, not the ODOT info).
I was pondering how to crop the private information
from the picture in software.  My more practical wife
said "how about a postit with today's date on it, on top
of information we shouldn't store".  Sometimes atoms are
better than bits.  She's certainly smarter than I am.

Next step is configuring the Mac to scan the card and 
send the image to the Linux server.  If the Corex-provided
proprietary software is too opaque or nonconfigurable, 
I'll install sane on that machine, too.

Message-ID: <20121126070207.GA1336@gate.kl-ic.com>

This isn't Linux, only vaguely Unix, but it is a question
I expect some open source folks will know the answer to. 
Probably not most Mac folk, who tend to solve problems
with credit cards rather than knowledge.

The second-hand CardScan is working with Linux.  The craigslist
seller advertised it as Mac compatable. He gave me a copy of the 
Mac software installer cardscan.pkg, which allegedly runs with
this scanner.  However, it complains that it won't work with the
OSX 2.6.8 (Snow Leopard) on our Mac.  So the instance of code
may be tied to the specific version of OSX, perhaps to the
particular machine this scanner was first attached to.  It has
been years since I've dealt with $$$ proprietary applications,
but I remember these kinds of shenanigans.

Anyone here know enough about Mac software architecture and
vendor behavior to hazard a guess?  Am I S.O.L?  This is what I
get for working with second rate, amateurish software like MacOS.

Not really, of course - SANE is ported to the Mac, and I probably
can get that running.  We are already running mostly open source
apps on the Mac, and SANE might be easier to integrate with our 
business process than some closed-source walled-garden "solution".

.pkg files are actually .xar archives. This Stack Overflow post has the details on how to get at stuff inside of them:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11298855/osx-how-unpack-and-pack-pkg-file

Look for .plist files and see if there are tags inside of those that specify a specific OS version.

Do you know if CardScan actually needs a newer version of the OS (as opposed to an older app that might just freak out if it sees it's running on a newer version even though it may otherwise work OK)?

I would like to build a system that has removable mirrored drives.

I'm thinking of having 3 drives - 2 in the system, 1 on the shelf, and
rotating them daily.

Q: Is there a motherboard with good hardware mirroring support?

Anyone done anything like this?

Hey all,

The person who recently came up about physical security is interested

Got something to share?

I *may* have time to put together a short talk on OWASP, what it is
all about, what our chapter is doing locally, and introduce FLOSSHack,
(a hacking competition designed to audit open source apps).

Or if that isn't technical enough, I could give a talk I recently gave
at BSides PDX on an open source tool (bletchley) I'm working on which
helps pentesters perform black box cryptanalysis.  Kinda niche also,
though.

Chime in if there is any interest...

Its totally fine to run multiple desktop environments on one install in
fact the Lightdm Logon Screen fully supports multiple desktops and will
show a icon for each one.

The can of warms is because apt-get will often remove dependencies that

is also a good resource for a relatively quick answer.

Subject: [PLUG] 5-1/4" Floppy Issue
Message-ID: <50B41519.7050602@comcast.net>

I just installed a 5-1/4" floppy in a Gateway box I got from Free Geek. 
When I try to read a floppy disk, the disk drive spins, the pilot light 
lights, and then I get a message that says:

Unable to mount location
No media in the drive

I remembered that I had not done anything in the BIOS after installing 
the drive, so I rebooted, pressed <F2> and started walking through the 
System Setup.

On the Advanced menu page there is an entry called Floppy Configuration. 
When I go to that page, there is an entry called Floppy Type. There are 
only two options, <1.44MB> and <2.88MB>.

Is it possible that the BIOS doesn't support 5-1/4" drives? Or did I 
miss something else?

It is not only possible, but likely. One of the advantages of the
(then) new 3-1/2" drives was that they were standardized. The bad old
5-1/4" drives were sometimes 360 MB, sometimes some other number, the
number of sectors were different from one manufacturer to the next,
and there were all kinds of other incompatibilities. It was a nightmare
for BIOS manufacturers as well as users. You were lucky if your 5-1/4"
floppy could be read on your friend's machine. The computer world
flocked to 3-1/2" drives as quickly as possible.

Assuming the disk you want to read is for an IBM PC (or clone), which
at least standardized on 360 MB, you'll need a BIOS from probably
significantly before 2000.

I'll bet Free Geek has a ton of old motherboards with a BIOS that would
do the trick. In fact, you can probably get one for free just by
dumpster diving in their trash.

I do remember those days. My first machine had 10 hole, hard sector drives.

Ahhh, memories of PCs stepping the floppy head at 30msec or some other
similarly brain dead rate instead of what the drives were capable of.
Talk about buzz saw! :)

> It is from a PC.

Is it a 1.2M or 360K disk?

You can read either in a 1.2M drive but you can't read a 1.2M disk in
a 360K drive. If it's a 360K disk try not to write it in a 1.2M drive
if you care about ever reading it in a 360K drive again.

> Q: Is there a motherboard with good hardware mirroring support?

A: I've found a lot that don't, in my searches.  I'm wondering why
would you want to tie yourself to a specific motherboard? (hardware
raid volumes are very rarely usable on other breeds of card than the
one they were made on--sometimes even same-brand is not enough, it
must be same firmware revision!) The beauty of linux s/w raid is that
in 10 years, you can still put those disks in whatever machine is
available (with a "legacy" sata card) and reassemble the raid.  i have
rebuilt my raid on my underpowered (was VIA, now Atom, both fanless
single core machines) fileserver a whole lot in the past 8 months (due
to a failing hard drive that kept working for long enough to rebuild
before erroring out and requiring another rebuild) and the speed of
the rebuild has been pretty close to disk speed despite these servers
not being optimized for I/O - i regularly get 110MB/s rebuilds on
modern 2TB drives (the cheapest ones i could find though!)  plus, my
systems have been pretty usable while the raid rebuilds--they only
serve pretty small stuff except the occasional "fire up virtualbox off
a networked drive to run windows for 5 minutes" and that definitely
gets prioritized over raid rebuilds (you can tweak the settings from
the command line for s/w raid rebuild speed and priority)--so i
basically don't notice additional lag during rebuild (vs the 100mbit
network fileservice speed anyway)

The real problem I think you'll have is that raid 1 is about 2
disks--i don't know a way to proactively mirror that third disk while
the first 2 are working.  maybe some h/w raid solutions have this, but
linux s/w raid doesn't have a concept of 3-way mirroring (unless you
have 4 drives and have a mirrored-mirror kind of thing) so here's the
way things will go:

- you have a 2 drive raid.
- you mdadm --add md0 /dev/otherdrive
- you now have a 2 drive raid with an empty hotspare
- you pull a working drive
- you wait hours to rebuild the new drive from the one that's still
spinning and hope you don't have a failure of that first drive during
this process, since you'll lose data from the last 2 hours.

My 3-drive system is like this:

2 drive mirrored array (have /boot and / mirrored separately from my
data partition so i can upgrade the OS without touching my data
partition

1 external usb drive for use with rsnapshot which is online backups
with months of history for not much extra drive space.  If I'm going
on vacation, i unplug the USB drive and take it with me or anyway make
sure it's not vulnerable to fire/theft/lightning at the same time as
the rest of my system.

Not trying to poo-poo your idea, but wondering if having the solution
in mind instead of the problem (what problem are you trying to solve
with the constant drive swaps, esp if you keep the other drive next to
the computer?) might be narrowing your field of possibilities.

luck++;

In spite of cryptic error reporting, I found out part of what
was going on with the Cardscan Mac software.  The files from
the seller had symlinks that did not survive the transition
from Mac to Linux to Mac.  Other stuff is also broken.

Meanwhile, I used MacPorts to put SANE (scanner software) and
Imagemagick on the Mac.  Still some issues with sane.  Preview,
the provided image viewer, displays surprisingly few image
formats, and MacOS version of Firefox likewise (no PNM,
for example).  

Next, build a tiny little app to scan cards, enter client names,
then file them on the server.  We'll see how hard that is.

Message-ID: <50B4C12F.9030303@opusnet.com>

I have a good friend of a few decades who has been working as an 
electical engineer, first in pagers, then in more contemporary wireless 
devices. I sent him Keith Lofstrom's and John Jason Jordan's exchange 
and here are his additional technical comments. ('QSO' stands for 
'conversation' as he is also a ham radio operator.)

Enjoy:

-------- Original Message --------


The QSO below brings up some interesting points indeed.

For LTE and CDMA protocols in particular, the transmit power is
increased as needed to be heard during events such as described below 
where there is an attenuated path back to the base station.

Also, there is what we call "the cocktail party effect" which 
essentially says that if everyone in a room talks at once, and we wish 
to be heard in our individual conversations, we must raise our voices.

When everyone does this, the situation must escalate in volume until the
path loss between different conversations is large compared to the path 
loss between ears and mouths of the individuals having each 
conversation, and at that point sufficient power has been attained to 
converse...  Essentially, the fewer the transmitters there are on a CDMA 
or LTE channel, the less power is required.  Parties with fewer people 
are always quieter.

This effect is also qualified by everyone operating on the same 
frequency simultaneously. The GSM protocol is TDMA (Time Division 
Multiple Access), which involves the individual transmitters having an 
assigned timeslot, and so we have only one person talking at a time, and 
this takes considerably less power.

The batteries always last longer in GSM phones for this reason.

As for the CMOS power amps, this sounds a bit hoaky. Reason is, that we
need linear PA's in order to have sufficiently low group delay 
distortion.  CMOS makes some great non-linear (like Class C) PA's but 
isn't well suited for linearity. I'm sure some topologies try to do 
this, but most must use GaAs devices in order to attain sufficient John 
Jason Jordan linearity. CMOS also creates lots of harmonics too, which 
is bad for passing FCC part 15B...

I wouldn't be surprised if someone is doing this, but it would be a very
difficult and inefficient way. (I could see some inexperienced Chinese 
company doing this...) In our base-stations, we use GaAs FET's in a 
Dougherty configuration, which means a linear main amplifier,
With an additional peaking amp summing power in. The whole thing is
delightfully linear, but not very efficient (about 26%,) which isn't too 
far from the theoretical class A amplifier maximum of 33%.
This method involves significantly less cost than a big-ole-hawnkin
class A power stage, which makes up for the inefficiency in the eyes of 
management. CMOS would probly be < 8% efficient given all the harmonic 
filtering that would be needed.

While cleaning the USB jack has a small probability of helping,
there are two more likely causes:  Battery failure, and radio
failure in the phone.

I just replaced the battery in my semi-dumb Nokia flip phone,
which used to last a week on a charge (not suprising with 10
calls a month) and recently dropped to a day.  The replacement
worked.  The replacement battery was from a spare/identical
Nokia that I keep around "just in case".  I ordered another
battery via Amazon for $4.


There is a grimmer possibility, a bit technical.  A high
quality cell phone (which nobody makes anymore) would use
a gallium arsenide power amplifier on the radio.  GaAs is
a faster process, so the amplifier does not need to be
pushed as hard to deliver both efficiency and reliability.

But standard CMOS silicon is cheaper than GaAs, because 99%
of all integrated circuits are made with silicon, and most
of those are CMOS silicon.  Most of the phone is CMOS
silicon, which is great for the processors and memory and
such.  So to save a few pennies per phone, manufacturers
make the power amplifier with CMOS, too.

Whether you use the phone for calls or not, the phone frequently
sends out "registration requests" to cell towers to let the
network know where it is.  If the tower is distant, or you are
in a shielded area, the phone pumps up the transmit power of
the registration request until the tower hears it.  That means
battery drain, but mostly it means increased stress on the power
amplifier.  If the shielding is a nearby metal table, or other
materials that interfere with the efficiency of the antenna,

Answering my own question, on the off-chance anybody else finds it useful:

The settings for digikam are in ~/.kde4/share/config/digikamrc

I backed up this file and reopened digikam, which caused digikam to create 
a new digikamrc file.  Now, for the most part I liked the customizations I 
had put into digikam over the years, so I didn't want to have to just go 
back to the original defaults.  So...

I then compared the settings between the old and new files using vimdiff. 
Doing so, I discovered about 5 "Toolbar=disabled" lines in my old copy.
Using vimdiff, I got rid of those lines completely.

I moved the default digikamrc aside, moved my modified (and hopefully 
fixed) copy in place, and restarted digikam.

Voila!  I have toolbars again, and can import new pictures. Success!
And thank ${deity} for hand-editable config files. (Though a GUI I 
couldn't screw up would be nice too.)

No, you are correct. Ctrl-M does just what I needed, but I forgot about 
it.  Thanks.

Ah, but that wouldn't have helped here, because the unwanted settings were 
already written into the .rc file, and thus preserved across reboots.

This is a classic example of the argument for ASCII configuration 
files. Sure, a binary configuration representation might mean 
(slightly) faster launch times, but IMO it's a completely fair 
trade-off since ASCII files allow great out-of-band control and they 
can be easily stored in a VCS, copied to new home directories, shared 
on mailing lists, etc.

My office uses Google Hangouts - it's a little CPU-intensive but works well.

Subject: [PLUG] Wrong Screen Resolution after this morning's update
Message-ID: <50B945F0.6010708@comcast.net>

I ran an update on Ubuntu 10.04 this morning. After if was finished it 
required a reboot. After the reboot one of my two screens came up with 
the wrong resolution -- sort of.

I'm running the NVIDIA driver, version 195.36.24. My video card supports 
two monitors, one DVI, and one VGA. I recently got a second 1680 x 1050 
monitor, and have them set up as "TwinView", which means that I can drag 
the cursor from left to right and go from the left edge of the left 
screen to the right edge of the right screen.

After the reboot this morning, I see an image on the left screen that 
goes about halfway across, at which point the left edge of what's no the 
right hand monitor is displayed. The correct image is displayed on the 
right hand monitor. In other words, what is in the upper left corner of 
the right hand monitor is also displayed in the upper left hand corner 
of the far right quarter of the left hand monitor.

The NVIDIA X Server Settings too shows both monitors detected at the 
correct resolution.

Any idea where to start looking for how to fix this so that each screen 
has its own image displayed?

Thanks.

With further fiddling, I see that I can extend a window on the left 
screen all the way to the right of that screen, but that it also shows 
up in the left had quarter of the right screen. So, for some reason, the 
two views overlap.

you can set all thisup simply in a file in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d  but 
lets do it the "GUI" way. Now, I run Nvidia 310.19, so my gui has a few 
different bells and whistles. When you run the nvidia-settings gui, you 
should have a "X Server Display Configuration". Bottom right corner 
click on "advanced."  No you should see at top a graphical 
representation of your 2 monitors. Do they overlap?  If so move 
themapart. Following example is for my 1920x1080 LCD and 1024x768 CRT. 
Click on each monitor to check/set settings (reddish border when selected).

LCD:
Configuration: Twinview
Resolution: 1920x1008 60Hz
Position: Absolute +0+0
Viewport in: 1920x1080
Viewportout: 1920x1080+0+0
Panning: 1920x1080
primary display checked

CRT:
Configuration: Twinview
Resolution: 1024x76885Hz
Position: Absolute +1920+0
Viewport in: 1024x768
Viewportout: 1024x768+0+0
Panning: 1024x768
primary display *unchecked*

no rotation/no reflection for both.

Hit "apply" and then click on monitor edges to selct the whole X 
screen.  Click on MetaMode to give a list: the 1st one is the default. 
You need to make sure the config you just set is the default. You will 
also see all the modes that are autodetected.

Essentially you want the right hand monitor to start where the left one 
ends. Once you find settings that work, click on "save to X 
configuration file"  (need to be root, or sudo whatever text editor and 
copy/paste)to save the settings.

Hope this helps.

Subject: [PLUG] Wallpaper only after nVidia driver installation in Ubuntu
	12.04
Message-ID: <50B99511.1080404@comcast.net>

I have Ubuntu 12.04 running on my test system. I added an nVidia card to 
the system and connected one of my wide screen monitors. So far, so 
good. The system was using the default driver, so I followed (possibly 
the wrong) directions to install the nVidia driver. The instructions I 
found were at:

http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-install-nvidia-295-40-drivers-in-ubuntu-12-0411-10-using-ppa.html

When I rebooted the machine and logged in, I got a screen with 
wallpaper, but nothing else. I can right-click and get the usual context 
menu. I can get to a terminal screen and run commands.

Next, I ran halt -- which hung partway through. I powered down, put the 
second monitor on the Y cable that connects to the card, and booted in 
to Debian. Both monitors display the same image. Next I booted into 
Ubuntu, again. At the GRUB stage, both monitors showed the same 
information. Once Ubuntu came up, only the first monitor showed 
anything. I logged in, and again, only got the wallpaper image on the 
first monitor. The second monitor was blank. Switching to a terminal, I 
get the same image on both monitors.

I've tried searching but don't have useful foo. Any ideas on where to 
turn? Is there some command I could run, or a configuration file I could 
tweak from the terminal screen?

Thanks.

Further searching turned up:

---------------------------------------------
jockey-text --help
jockey-text -l
jockey-text -e xorg:nvidia_current
---------------------------------------------

as a way to enable the nvidia driver from the terminal. 
xorg:nvidia_current was enabled. But there was xorg:nvidia_173 listed 
above current. I ran jockey-text -e xorg:nvidia_173 and rebooted. Now, I 
do have the expected menu bar, and can run programs. Foobilliard runs 
better than with the default video driver, but is not as smooth as on my 
other machine. I suspect that's because the card in the test machine is 
an old Quadro NVS 285 card with only 64 MB of total memory.

However, I still don't have the second monitor. I ran nvidia-settings. 
It only sees one screen. On the X Server Display Configuration page 
there is a message that says,

---------------------------------------------
Unable to load X-Server Display Configuration page:

The NVIDIA X driver on gateway-u 1204:0.0 is not new
enough to support the nvidia-settings Display Configuration page.
---------------------------------------------

A somewhat odd thing: NVIDIA X SErver Settings on the test machine knows 
what nVidia card is installed, the Quadro NVS 285. NVIDIA X Server 
Settings on this machine says GPU 0 (Unknown). Right off hand I don't 
remember what model card it is, but it does have 512 MB of memory.
