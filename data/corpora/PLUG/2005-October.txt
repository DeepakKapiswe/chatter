   Thank you very much, Tony, for the insight on both the FVS318 and OpenBSD.
For six years I used floppyfw -- version 1.09 all that time -- on a box
sitting under the desk. Because it worked, the Netgear sat here unused for
about a year. One day, a couple of months ago, something died on the floppyfw
box. Once I figured out that was the problem, I uploaded the FVS318 config to
the box from where I had stored it on my notebook, plugged everything in, and
was back on the 'Net in an hour or so.

   The FVS318 is very chatty: not only does it mail me a log of every smtp,
udp, and tcp packet it saw over the previous 24 hours (boring plot, but a
huge cast of characters), it also sends me individual notices of rejected
attempts to scan ports for vulnerable openings. It's silent, small, and just
works as designed and intended. I'm very happy with it.

   If I had major state secrets and a ton of free time when I was sitting here
twiddling my thumbs, I would probably invest in an OpenBSD firewall. As you
so clearly pointed out, it seems to be a career to maintain and is not
justified here.

   On the other hand, getting rid of the rest of the spam that makes it
through the postfix and spamassassin filters is a different story. Sigh. So
much comes through over Friday night it must be an after-school job for kids
everywhere.

Message-ID: <20051002021352.GA25195@gate.kl-ic.com>


Yesterday, I joined the bus tour of the Open Source Labs at Oregon
State University in Corvallis.  I was pleased to learn that they 
are big fans of dirvish, use it on their personal machines, and are
transitioning the big servers to use dirvish for disk to disk backups.

Since they are the primary repository for Mozilla, Kernel.org, Drupal,
Gentoo, and a number of other major open source projects, I guess 
this is hitting the open source big time for dirvish (which I am
currently managing).  Even better, perhaps I can motivate somebody
down there with better software skills to take over the management
of dirvish.

traceroute and tcptraceroute are two different programs.  traceroute
uses ICMP to trace the route, tcptraceroute uses tcp and a specified
port to trace the route.  The later is handy if the something in the
route doesn't honor ICMP requests.

Ed,

   That was the first thought of mine, too. Those must be huge facilities that
require a bus to tour them. Most computer facilities I've visited can be
easily toured by walking.

Actually, an image of Argonne National Labs came into my mind. That sort 
of "lab" is big enough to need a bus tour. :)

In any event, it's nice to have a huge open source mirror a short bus 
ride away. :)

Speak for yourself, Ed.  We don't all ride the short bus.

Wasn't it a divide-by-zero instruction that caused a short on a bus in 
one of the early computers?

Piet,

    I'm not quite sure yet, but I will let you know in a couple days.
I normally go to Portland in the late afternoon on Thursday - so I

   Since I cannot make this meeting, I'd greatly appreciate someone asking
John when they'll provide firmware updates that can be applied from a linux
system. Specifically, for the Professional Series 2500C. Each time the techs
told me a problem would be solved by a firmware upgrade I discovered that it
could be done only from a machine running Microsoft. One tech admitted that
their printer firmware could not be upgraded by those running their own
computer systems with HP-UX as the OS.

Feh!

Subject: [PLUG] rpm spec file macro expansion
Message-ID: <20051003064903.7B24E8F03@tinman.seitzassoc.com>


I'm trying to build some cross tools for the AVR microcontrollers, and I
need to work around an issue with file collisions.  When I build
cross versions of binutils, gcc, and gdb, the info files that get created
have the same name and path as the corresponding files for the native
host tools.  In order to eliminate the conflict, I'd like to do something
like the following in my spec file:

%define _infodir %{_infodir}/avr

Due to the way macros are evaluated, this results in infinite recursion.
What is the correct way to accomplish this?  

I'm bit surprised that this issue with cross tool info file collisions
hasn't been addressed.  The actual executables aren't a problem.  They
are installed in two different places, neither of which causes a
conflict.  For instance, gcc gets installed as /usr/bin/avr-gcc and
/usr/avr/bin/gcc.  The man pages are also installed in a way that avoids
conflicts.  Only the info files seem to be a problem.

thanks,
galen

Generally, I'd just a) specify your longer path throughout the spec 
file or b) define _infodir with a macro further up the chain or with a 
full pathname

a) When building and installing, specify --infodir=%{_infodir}/avr,
    and include that path in your %files section.

b) %define _infodir %{_datadir}/info/avr

    or

    %define _infodir /usr/share/info/avr

Does anyone know if it's possible to RAID remote filesystems? I'm thinking
of being able to combine multiple sshfs or gmailfs filesystems into one

Since your filesystem needs to be laid on TOP of a block-level device,
you can't really do what you're looking to... the closest
approximation would be using a cluster filesystem that takes into
account some underlying fabric connecting a bunch of block devices
(Lustre, PVFS, GFS, etc)...

Though it would likely be possible to hack together a bunch of network
block devices mounted locally and do this.  I'm not sure about your
sshfs or gmailfs filesystems, I'm guessing they won't enable you to do
that however.  Perhaps if you could kludge a sparse file as a block
device (cryptoloop or somesuch) accessed OVER these and mounted
locally you could do it?  If you're accessing these over commodity
internet with so many layers of abstraction, it's unlikely to be
usable or stable however :)

Message-ID: <20051003184513.GA18387@gate.kl-ic.com>


Sometimes people ask about PLUG - or don't run away fast enough
when I tell them about it :-) .   Rather than hunting down a scrap
of paper for the URL, it would be quicker to hand them a business
card with useful pointers and info.  Who would be interested in
buying some from me (at cost) if I had some printed up?

Two thousand color, double-sided cards from Overnightprints.com
costs $90 or so.  I've used them a few times before.  The quality
is good - if you proof them correctly!

I was thinking about a card with a group photo of us on the
front, partly whited out, with "PLUG" and "www.pdxlinux.org"
overlaid in large black letters.   Perhaps someone has a large
inflatable Tux, or perhaps we GIMP the Tux+Umbrella logo into
the photo.  

On the back, a smaller print listing of the meetings when&where,
with a disclaimer to check the website in case they change.  We've
been fairly regular about times and venues, though Murphy says 
something will change as soon as we print cards :-/

Of course, I would put the digital proofs up on the web (as pdfs)
before I sent in the order.

I can bring a digital camera Thursday, and if you doesn't want
to appear in the photo, that's OK, you can hold the camera.

Does this interest people?

Sounds interesting, but what about the option of printing your own? 
Simply creating the design and making it available on the website for
anyone to download and print on standard sized business cards?  Seems
cheaper for those of us likely to hand out about 5 in our lifetimes

RAID is a block level or byte level technology... not a file level one. 
You could certainly mirror data between two systems, but it sounds like
you're more looking into representing multiple mount points as a single
name space.

Of course I will open-source the card design and put it on my website. 
But at a nickel a piece, it is a lot easier to have them printed.

Can I put you down for 5 for a quarter?  :-)

David,

I saw your name listed as the "contact" for PLUG...

We're a Seattle-based integrator of rackmount servers and storage
systems, and we also sponsor of the local Seattle SAGE chapter.  Scott
McDermott (scottm at octaldream.com) is the SAGE contact if you want to
check up on us!

With the upcoming Supercomputer 2005 Conference in Seattle this November,
we have an offer out to the Seattle SAGE chapter for anyone who wants to
attend the Exhibit Hall.  Since we're exhibiting, we have a limited
number of passes to hand out.  Through members of SAGE who are also in
the local UNIX and Linux groups up here, our invitation has also been
circulated through several user groups.

I would like to extend the same offer to those so inclined in Oregon.

If you could send this out to your PLUG list, that would be great.

Please let me know if you are going to do this, just so I know if it's
taking place.

The invitation is below.

Thanks,

Art

This would require a seperate out of band network  (probably) gigabit
between google and the other block device.

Plus most of these places he wants to mount already have native
filesystems running on some sort of RAID, with the file systems being
exported via foo appilcation or protocol.  Rsync would be easier since
it's file level if you wanted simple mirroring, but that's impractical for
a number of reasons (no google shell account!)

You could probably do the same thing that drbd does using a native iscsi
driver and normal software RAID (or hardware).  No out of band or private
interconnect needed.

Max

I have a new favorite FireFox extension - Aspellfox. It allows you to 
interactively check the contents of a text entry box using aspell. Very 
nice, no additional dictionaries required.

The only complaint I have is that you can't do anything with the browser 
while Aspellfox is running.

I think that depends on the printer. I've upgraded firmware (not just
the print servers, but the print engine also) on LJ4200 printers from
Linux. You upload the image via FTP. Apparently that's not the case

It doesn't work for me at all.  Well, it does something - a window
flashes on and off - and it Alerts you that "Spellcheking is
done!" (yes, it is spelled incorrectly), but all of my misspelled words
are still there.  Aspell works from an xterm for me, so I don't
understand why the Fox isn't getting it.  Although it would seem that
the programmer wasn't able to get it to work either.

Links in the story have been reported both working and not working with
Firefox. I use the K12 LTSP Fedora Core 3 and have trouble with those

ColdFusion server or a Firefox flaw?

Message-ID: <4343F99E.1070809@acm.org>

I've looked and looked and can't find or come up with the correct 
combination of settings to get a "Fedora Core 4 - KDE" install from 
automounting the DVD/CD burner when I insert a blank CD-RW.

I Inherited system so I don't _really_ know what was done during the 
install.

Other than just-take-the-line-out of /etc/fstab ( which I still have to 
try, but would prefer not doing ) I'm at a lost.  I suspect there is 
something running as part of the KDE startup but since I normally use 
GNOME I don't know where to look.

This is part of a temporary quick and dirty backup solution so i'm 
swapping CD-RW's daily.

Suggestions?

Is it actually mounting it?  On FC4 with Gnome inserting a blank disk
is recognized by Nautilus and it looks "mounted" but it isn't
actually, rather the fake device shows up to allow drag-n-drop
burning.  If the disk is actually blank I didn't think it was possible
to truely mount it, since there's no filesystem on a blank CD.

But I could be wrong :-)

I just uninstall the automounter, there is "autorun" for KDE, Gnome's one is
"magicdev" or some other piece of "magic". RPM can be uninstalled with no
other dependencies.

Trying to do something it.  /var/log/messages says

... kernel: cdrom: This disc doesn't have any tracks I recognize!

Go figure eh?  I wish the Desktop people would quit trying to make "it" 
act like MS Windows.  Or at the very least make it _not difficult_ to 
turn things off and on.

Problem is I want my cake and to eat it too.  There is also a DVD/CDROM 
in the system and I kind of like it automounting when I stick a DVD/CD 
into it.

Did some more looking and tried making changes to /etc/auto.misc to look 
at the correct device but still no joy.

autorun in KDE is next.

Thanks for the clue-stick.

auto.misc is from autofs, it's a different kind of automounter: autorun and
the like detect that a CD is inserted and mount it. autofs will intercept a
command like "ls /mnt/cdrom" and mount the CD if it's not already mounted.
autofs is configured through auto.misc, and you need to run autofs daemon.
You should not be using both automounters at the same time for the same
device and mount point.

autorun in KDE is next.

Heeeeee! I hadn't noticed the spelling - further evidence of my need for a 
speel-chicker. ;)

I'm not sure what would make the program return that way. Maybe it's 
unable to write to it's temp file? I'll look at the code and see if it 
gives me any clues.

The joys.  Went to the autorun project page and looked at the man pages. 
  This could be rated as a MS Windows wantabe application.  It has no 
method, I could find, to tell it to _not_ look at specific devices or 
only use specific devices.

Ticked me off so I disabled it for my login.

Now to find the applet/application that places all the user mount-able 
devices in fstab in the "Disks" select of the Desktop context menu ( 
right click on the desktop ) that is part of my Fedora Core 1 install at 
home.

For Gnome in FC4, there is gnome-volume-manager.  The preferences are
set with Preferences, Removable Drives and Storage.  It has options
for mounting removeable drives, running commands for blank discs,
audio CDs, and video DVDs.

HAL and udev are doing most of the work; gnome-volume-manager is just
the policy piece.  My impression is that there is a beta KDE Volume
Manager which isn't included with FC4.
I have seen suggestion for running gnome-volume-manager with KDE.  I
don't know how to get this running or configured since I use Gnome.

The PDF thingy works for me on Ubuntu Hoary.  Were you referring to
anything else?

A step or two in the right direction.  Probably evn a reason for me to 
upgrade my FC1 box to something newer.  :-)

As will I as soon as I get it installed on this system and it is what I 
use at home.

In the mean time I can do my QAD backups with no cruft in the logs.

Thanks for the info!

Message-ID: <20051005213803.62087.qmail@web52605.mail.yahoo.com>

I'm building a file server with 6 300GB SATA drives, using software
RAID5. This will probably be running Fedora Core 4. I want most of the
drive space available for file storage (/home/shares). Thing is, I know
you can't boot off a software RAID5 partition, just single or mirrored.
How would you folks set up your drives with redudancy and best use of
drive space?

Another question about SATA: How can I determine which physical drive
is /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, etc?

A friend of mine just set up a raid-5 server using software raid with
one large partition on each disk (and a small, non-raided but manually
mirrored boot partition on each drive). He then used some combination
of lvm + xfs to repartition that huge raid partition.

End result is raid-5 with software, and he can dynamically resize
partitions (no remounting required).

If you want more details, I can put you two in contact..

You can set up /boot on RAID0 and / on RAID5 if you want, it's a bit tricky
(GRUB installer will not configure GRUB to boot, your system will hang on
boot after install, you'll need a boot CD and run GRUB manually to get it
properly installed) but it can be done. Then you can cut a small partition
from 2 big disks for /boot RAID0 and the same size small partition from
remaining disks to use for swap.

You just have to know which connector on the motherboard is SATA1 etc.

I wouldn't use RAID5 is what I'd do.  While I've read plenty about
RAID5, there are certain aspects that remain elusive to me, so I tend to
prefer RAID1 and RAID0, which are simple and clear.

I'd peel off about 100MB of a couple drives for RAID1 /boot (or, with
300GB drives, do on all 6 and have a 6-way mirror).  Then I'd take out
1/2 or 1/4 of your RAM from each drive for swap space and set them all
at the same priority (the kernel with balance the swapping between them,
in a RAID0-like fashion, except if you lose some of them it will use
what's available, unlike a real RAID0, which would prevent you from
using any of it).

Partition the rest of the space on each drive as one partition and then
you could do several things.  Exactly how or what depend on the
application, but you could:
  o Use RAID5 on all 6 partitions
  o Make 3 RAID1 volumes and stripe (RAID0) across them--this is the
best performance, although the available space is less than RAID5.  This
is called RAID0+1 or 1+0; I've never actually been clear which.  You can
also make two RAID0 stripes and then mirror them with RAID1.
  o Make 3 RAID1 pairs and use them as you see fit; for example, the
first pair could be for your regular system stuff, then you could do
RAID0 with the remaining 2 RAID1 volumes.  Or you could do RAID5 with
the remaining 4 volumes.  You could also keep them partially independent
of each other if you're dealing with database applications and a DBA who
like to control what data goes on what spindles.

At any rate, with whatever scheme you choose, use LVM to allocate your
actual file systems.  In the latter case of two RAID1 volumes and a
picky DBA, for example, you can specifically allocate certain logical
volumes to certain physical volumes.  With FC4, you can even resize
ext2/3 filesystems on-line (while mounted), so it's even easier
(although I wish they'd included e2fsadm, which is easier than using
lvextend+ext2online, partly because I find myself continuously
forgetting the name of the latter command).  The LVM HOWTO gives you a
pretty good introduction.

After a few misadventures with RAID-5 booting issues I've finally gone
to RAID-1 (mirroring) on all my systems.  Disks are cheap enough now
that RAID-1 on SATA makes good economic sense.

This depends on the SATA channel each drive is plugged into.  SATA0 =
sda, SATA1 = sdb, etc.

Stuart Cohen of the Open Source Development Labs will be speaking
at the Technology Forecast Power Breakfast, Thursday October 13 at
the Benson Hotel from 730am to 9am.  More detail at:

   http://events.bizjournals.com/1565 

Tickets are $25 from the website by Oct 7, or $30 at the door.
There are going to be a lot of people there learning about Open 
Source, and I plan to bring a stack of Knoppix disks.  This will
be an excellent opportunity for networking, IMHO.

Subject: [PLUG] Troublesome linux box
Message-ID: <1128619620.5530.6.camel@einstein.seansdomain.org>

I have a tower box that I use as a file server at my home.  It's doing
nfs exports to some workstations, as well as some other functions
(dns,dhcp,samba,slimp3 server).

It has been very unstable the last 6 months.

The only clue I have is some messages from dmesg.  If anyone has any
insight into some troubleshooting steps I'm really looking for some
answers.  Please see the dmesg below....

Sean

ksymoops is the tool that is normally used to make some sense of an oops
report.

  Your box is getting kernel oops messages.  They need to be decoded
using the copy of "ksymoops" for your kernel.

  These look like good oops messages.  They haven't been tainted.  It
looks like you may be hitting the same bug over and over again.

  It's also possible that it's *not* a kernel problem.  It could be a
BIOS or hardware issue, depending on which module the oops is
occuring.

Subject: [PLUG] /etc/wlan/wlan.conf tweaks?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0510061511460.20824@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   When I use my notebook with the WiFi card in hotels and coffee shops it
works just fine; a simple '/etc/iwconfig eth1' and I'm up and running.

   However, there have been two occasions over the past couple of months when
the card could not find the SSID of the network. One time was at the hotel in
Incline Village, NV and the other time was at the Portland airport this past
Tuesday. In both situations, the card could not find the network so there
were no lights on it.

   In /etc/wlan/wlan.conf, SSID_wlan0 is == "" and no other networks are
defined or enabled.

   There's a plethora of web pages, tools, and other resources out there. I'd
greatly appreciate a recommendation for what to read, any tools I should get
and install on the notebook to connect to those networks where the card does
not automatically find it, and other suggestions.

   Once past this issue, I want to learn more about securing the Linksys
Wireless-G Access Point I have here in the office. One thing at a time.

Thanks,

Rich

Hello all,

I have some Nexus marine weather instruments that are spitting out data over a serial line.  This serial line is connected to the COM1 port of a new Fedora linux installation and I have been fiddling around with scripts trying to get this solution to work.  Considering using shell scripts, perl , or even python to accomplish the following task.

Goal:  Get the linux box to gather the serial data being dumped from the instruments.  Primarily this would be to capture the serial data into files say every 5 to 10 minutes and then rename those files with time stamps.  Then further script developement wil occur that will read these files and create html and graphics that represent the weather data that has been captured.

Any help or direction would be greatly appreciated.  I have this developement system here in my house if any one is interested.  

Regards,

Ray

Not sure how fancy you want go get but If you want to hold data for historical 
purposes you might want to consider creating a database to hold the results. 
With timestamp data stored along with the weather data you can easily select 
all readings for a given time period.

Well, if you have one of the retail versions, you can log into 
rhn.redhat.com and find it there.

If not, I always had better luck with www.rpmfind.net.

They don't ship a kernel-source-XXX.i386.rpm file any longer for both
RHEL and Fedora Core. They only ship kernel-XXX.src.rpm. For RHEL4 you
can find the source RPM here:

  ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/enterprise/4/en/os/i386/SRPMS/

And for FC4 it's in this directory:

  http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/4/SRPMS/

If you really want the kernel-source-XXX.i386.rpm file, it will
be created along with all the various binary kernels if you do an
'rpmbuild --rebuild' on the source RPM.

The python module pyserial (http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/) makes it
relatively easy to create scripts that interact with serial ports.  I've
done this on a couple of occasions to talk to random hardware.  Another
possibility would be to use kermit's scripting capability.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0510070812520.28087@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I need to copy firmware upgrades to one of my printers. It's the only way
to do this under linux. The suggested syntax is 'cat <filename> > /dev/lp1'.
However, the printers are not directly connected to the server, but are
network nodes served by JetDirect cards.

   In /etc/cups/printers.conf, the printer needing the upgrade is defined as:
DeviceURI socket://colorp:9100; it's network address is: 192.168.55.194.

   Can I redirect the 'cat <filename>' to the IP address rather than the
device and end up with the same results?

TIA,

Rich

Can you temporarily plug the printer in to, say, a laptop?

Rob,

   I think I can find a parallel cable, yes.

   Can't a paged file be redirected over the network?

rpm.pbone.net is another good source of RPMs.

If you need to build kernel modules, the required header files, etc., 
are in the kernel-devel package.

Do you have a raw print queue, that is, one without any filters?  You
might be able to just 'print' the file.  If not, the command 'nc' may do
what you want.  Something like this might work:

nc 192.168.55.194 9100 < file

If you are needing to make patches to the kernel, you need to download the 
src.rpm for the kernel and build a new set of kernel rpms.  (I have to do 
this on my laptop to get cardbus to work.)

It is not too terribly hard to do if you understand how to build RPMs.  

A good book on this is:

Thanks, that's the magic URL.

For anyone who is interested, rpmfind.net does not have RPMs for RHEL4, and 
rpm.pbone.net has a few src.rpms. If you cruise through 
ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/enterprise you'll see a lot of empty 
directories. I guess they want folks to use Red Hat Network. I don't have a 
retail copy, I just wanted to see inside some RPMs.

afaik, Red Hat doesn't publicly distribute binary packages for RHEL, 
though it does distribute source packages.

If you specifically need RHEL binary packages, you pretty much need a 
subscription. You're free to look at the RHEL source packages or the 
binary packages of the free-rebuild distros like CentOS.

I'm not sure where to look on the Redhat site for the RHEL source rpms, but
the CentOS folks obviously know how to find them.  If CentOS source rpms
are good enough for your needs, you can find them here:
  http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/centos/

Many thanks to OSU for providing this.

Red Hat does make a "30 day trial" edition of RHEL 4 available via
http://www.redhat.com/software/rhel/eval/ , which last I checked, does
include the binary RPMs on ISOs that you can burn and use for
installation. I think the 30 day limit is on the access period from the
RHEL 4 distro to the Red Hat Network.

They get away with it, because the GPL only requires them to release the
source code. Red Hat gets to do what they want with the binaries.

While folks like cAos (CentOS) and WhiteBox Linux have done an excellent
job with their rebuilds, they've had to use other tools (not included
with RHEL 4) to build the RHEL 4 SRPMs into their rebuild distributions.

Unfortunately, that means you can't mix and match some RPMs between RHEL
4 and the rebuilds, such as the Kernel source.

Thanks,
Mike

Why wouldn't that simply print the file? I was under the impression that if
the printer receives something on port 9100 that it would print
automatically.

 I may be wrong, as I haven't spent too much time dealing with printers.

Is there a way to telnet/ssh into the printer? I know on some jet direct
print servers you can..

Do you have a raw print queue, that is, one without any filters?  You
might be able to just 'print' the file.  If not, the command 'nc' may do
what you want.  Something like this might work:

nc 192.168.55.194 9100 < file

It depends on the contents of the file.  If it were pure ASCII text that
might be the case, but presumably the file contains some sort of command
sequence that tells the printer to update its firmware.

I think the telnet port is only used for configuration.  At least that's how
it works with my jet direct card.

Yes.

It is not included in Fedora Core 4.  If you need to build modules, you
need to install kernel-devel.  If you have to patch it, you need to drag
down the src.rpm and patch and rebuild the rpms.

mirrors.kernel.org:/fedora/core/4/SRPMS (or something like that) should
have what you want. That is from memory, so it is probably wrong.  (I am
dealing with really crappy wireless at lunch today.)

Last time I had looked, it had not been updated since sometime in the
last century.

It was a good reference.  Too bad it is not even close to current.

   Those of you with a scientific perspective might be interested in the
Quantian live CD <http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian.html>. Based on
Knoppix, this bootable linux distribution devotes about 25% of the space to
scientific tools. Included are R, Octave, GRASS, and LyX.

   Like Knoppix, burn copies and give 'em away. It looks like a good one for
technical folks.

Folks:

I made a first-pass PLUG business card out of one of the pictures we
took last night.  You can see it at http://www.keithl.com/plugcard.html.
The image is not very good if magnified, but should look fine on a
business card.   Click on the images to download the PDF.

As you can see from the card, Geoff is a much bigger person than Eric.
And maybe Alan needs the umbrella, not Tux.  :-)

Bill Ensley of Bear Printing of Tigard has offered to print these up.
Please review the images, and tell me what you think.  I hope we can
have some to distribute at the next meeting.  It would be nice to have
some to pass out at the Technology Business breakfast next Thursday, 
but I doubt we can get everything done on time.

Hey Keith,

My initial thought was looks good on the back. Then I started looking at

Jax Bar, 826 SW 2nd (It's gotta be in Portland)
Riverdale H.S., 9727 SW Terwilliger (It's gotta be in Portland: WRONG!!!)

How about changing the layout a bit:
-----------------------------------------------------
General Meeting:    Portland State University
1st Tues, 7PM       Smith Center, Portland

Afters:             Lucky Labrador
1st Tues, 9PM       915 SE Hawthorne, Portland

Advanced Topics:    Jax Bar
3rd Wed, 7PM        826 SW 2nd, Portland

Linux Clinic:       Riverdale High School
3rd Sat, 1-4PM      9727 SW Terwilliger, Lake Oswego

Join OUR mailing lists http://lists.pdxlinux.org
-----------------------------------------------------

I don't know if that would work, but it might make it a bit easier for 
first timers!!

The general meeting should say *1st Thursday*, not 1st Tuesday.

My preference would be to drop the photo and just have Tux with the
umbrella.  I think the image will be so small on a business card that
it won't add anything to the card, but that's just MHO.  It's your
idea and project, and more power to you for doing it.

Since you are soliciting opinions, I'll concur with Galen.
Unfortunately, -ENOPATCH (as they say on linux-kernel).  That is, I am
not offering an alternative, just handwaving a suggestion to do a
cooler font and simple graphic of some kind, maybe a watermarkie
background.

Yes ... Quantian is very cool indeed. The most recent versions have been 
on DVDs; if you want a CD-sized Quantian you need to go back a few releases.

One more Quantian goodie: if you have a room full of machines, you can 
boot Quantian up on all of them and have a cluster ready to run! I call 
it a Supercomputer on a DVD. :)

Yah, I caught that later, but left it in to see if people were paying
attention.  Since you are, I will fix it now, along with Piet's 
suggested reformmatting.

I could go either way, but my intent is to show that we are an
organization (so to speak) of real people.  Some of the most
powerful images in computing and in corporate history are group
photos of the small teams that later grew huge;  Bill Gates and
the first Redmond team, Edwin Land and the founding Polaroid team,
the Mercury astronauts.  If we do what we hope to do, and PLUG
becomes what it could become, these cards may be worth a lot
of money as collectors items someday.  What, me hubris?

Perhaps that is overly ambitious, and a simple Tux with Umbrella
would be more restrained.

   It boots into the cluster configuation, IIRC. You can run two machines as a
cluster if you wish.

I have used Quantian live CD and been pleased with it.
For some applications (like GIS) it has a more suitable selection
of software than the general Knoppix distro.

Actually, this are a number of Knoppix variants that are nice.
There are a couple decent variants oriented towards science, including
Quantian.  There are also a couple decent security variants.
Unfortunately, I don't remember the name of the one I like.

Actually Knoppix (the CD version) uses a compressed filesystem image
to get about 2GB worth of stuff on a CD.  I don't know if they still
do that with the DVD version of Knoppix.

I just recovered some files from a Debian system (multiple power 
failures hosed the install) using a Knoppix disk.  What a sweet system!  
I'm also looking at Ubuntu.  When my laptop gets here I think it won't 
be very long before my Windows 2000 desktop becomes one of those 
systems.  I'll take a look at Quantian as well.  I'm really impressed at 
what is out there now.

I did a rather sloppy/inexpert job with GIMP to make solid backgrounds,
so I don't think that hacked up photo would look very good at "bigger
than business card" scale.   However, I have posted the original camera
shot to http://www.keithl.com/pluggroup.jpg, for anyone who wants to 
take a better hack at it.  Extra credit for taking out the door without
taking out some some hair also.

I went to last year's Penguin Day at Free Geek.  Had a great time
chatting with lots of cool folks about what open-source technology can
do to help people do good things.

Worth attending.

Subject: [PLUG] Asterisk hints?
Message-ID: <20051008053817.GB9439@merlot.com>

I found out that my nice little PBX appliance, a 3 year old Talkswitch
24, can't be adjusted to work with the impedance of my Packet8 ATA, so I
get a nasty echo when it forwards calls to remote extensions. Talkswitch
support says that it's a hardware issue, and my box is too old to
upgrade to the newer hardware. For the $700 that a new Talkswitch will
cost, I should be able to build a perfectly adequate (or better)
Asterisk box, right?

I don't want to spend a pile of money or time on this, though I think it
will be a fun project and good for some quality geeking time.
Asterisk at Home looks like the way to go; a nice GUI, usable defaults,
etc.

I currently have one analog line and one VoIP line. If I can get a good
deal on raw VoIP lines I could use two of those, but I'm keeping one
analog line for emergencies. I want to continue to use three analog
phone devices: a Polycom speakerphone, a Panasonic cordless, and my fax
machine, an HP all-in-one. I'm not grokking the FXO/FXS distinction...
is there a link that explains those TLAs in terms of phone devices and
phone lines?

The Talkswitch is only a little bigger than my broadband router, and
handles 2 phone lines, 4 local extensions, 8 remote extensions, and 22
voicemail boxes. It has no fan, and makes noise only when it's ringing a
local extension (a little relay-like clicking). I like that a lot. So if
I'm going to build an Asterisk box, I want it to be as close to silent
and as frugal on power as possible. A very small footprint would be
great.

Any suggestions? Favorite links? Any and all advice is welcome.

Thanks!

This was my first hit with Google on: FXO FXS

Subject: [PLUG] Looking for new laptop vendor
Message-ID: <20051008064531.GA6122@gate.kl-ic.com>


I *used to* be quite a fan of IBM Thinkpads, because they *used to*
have quick and excellent repair service.  However, the sale of the
Thinkpad division to Levono has pretty much completed the destruction
of their quality and their reputation, so I am looking for a new
source of laptops.

I desire three things from a laptop vendor:

1)  Demonstrated excellent repair service.  Laptops are subject to
a lot of stress, and *will fail* - I want my next laptop to come 
from a company with a demonstrated history of quick repairs with no
nonsense.  As I said, that used to be IBM.  Who does it now?  Has
anyone here got any positive factory service stories to share?

2)  Mostly Linux compatable.  I want the display and the ethernet
and the mouse-surrogate to work.  I don't need working built-in
wifi.  For software compatability reasons, I need Intel architecture.

3)  I strongly prefer the IBM-style trackpoint to touchpads (Easier
to do precision work in jittery environments).  If there are other
stable pointing devices that work adequately, I would like to hear
about those, too.

I want compute speed (2GHz), don't care too much about graphics
speed, don't care at all about audio, games, etc.  While high 
reliability would be nice, it is impossible to evaluate, as the
machines with reliability track records are all obsolete, and the
various brandname sources all use the same manufacturers anyway.

Any suggestions?

Keith

PS:  My rant about IBM/Levono/Solectron's lousy performance can
be found at http://www.keithl.com/ibm.html .  I won't inflict it
on the mailing list.

Subject: [PLUG] Two screen presentation software
Message-ID: <20051008071037.GA6460@gate.kl-ic.com>


Thursday morning I attended an AEA event, a "mock VC" presentation.
My friend Jeff Zurshmeide and a partner did a mock presentation of
their imaginary startup to a committee of three local venture 
capitalists, followed by their evaluation meeting.  We got to see
how they perform the process;  very educational.  However, that is 
not what I am writing about here.

One of the things I observed was the relentless sequential nature of a
typical Powerpoint slide show performance;  Jeff and his friend had
their pitch rehearsed, and found it very difficult to change order
in order to answer the VC's questions.  I think some of that is the
paradigm imposed on them by their software, which does not easily
support skipping around.

Most modern laptops have two complete video generation systems;  it
is possible to display one image on the laptop screen,  and send an
entirely different image out the VGA/DVI port to the projector.  A
next-generation presentation program could make good use of this
capability.

This means the presenter can be looking at a "control panel", with
perhaps a quarter of the laptop screen devoted to the projected
image, and the other three quarters for script, messaging, notes,
slide sorter, etc.  Further, for situations where audience input 
redirects the order of the slides, the software should adapt to that,
allowing the presenter to resequence in real time, not touching on 
the out-of-order slide again, perhaps adding backup slides or removing
slides from the presentation in real time.   Slides could be made with
"hotspots", indicated areas on the user's panel that cause some 
animation (like text lining up, or movement in part of a diagram)
to happen on the projected screen.  Imagine a flowchart or data flow
diagram, where you can make "data" appear to move down the path you
are talking about by moving your mouse over it on your control panel.

I don't know of any presentation software that offers these capabilities,
but it might not be difficult to do under Linux.  Is there anything
like this out there?  If not, is anyone inspired to do this as an
open source project?

My first thought on "how to do it today" is to just have a second X 
configuration with two displays and run the presentation software on 
the vga-out display.  If you configure without xinerama, the fullscreen 
should still work correctly (maybe even with xinerama given the right 
WM/software compatibility.)  You just move your mouse off of the edge 
of one desktop to control the other.  It's not going to do resequencing 
for you, but it would give you a desktop full of notes without 
disrupting the slide show.

Keith,

I recently bought a laptop from Dell.  Like you I researched the current 
status of vendors before I sent my hard earned money off. Dell's 
reputation is slipping, no doubt about it.  I've never had a bad 
experience with them and this sales call was no exception but my boss 
recently bought one of theirs and the comedy of errors that followed 
didn't make Dell look very good.  IBM's reputation seems to have 
slipped.  The one contact I had who had dealt with them recently (just 
pre-Lenovo sale) won't be talking to them again..  No one I talked to 
would consider any HP outside of a server.  Amazing unanimity on that 
point.  And really surprisingly Gateway came on strong in Laptops.  The 
same person didn't have much good to say about their desktops but 
strongly recommended their laptops, both in quality and service.  
Personally Gateway is on my "Burn me once" list but this person is quite 
knowledgeable, did her research, and loves her Gateway.

Dell has been my company of choice for quite a while now.  I'm typing 
this on an old Dimensions 850 I bought off their refurbished list 5 
years or so ago.  Both personally and professionally they've done well 
by me.  And at least on the Debian mailing lists there seem to be a fair 
number of people running Linux on Dells.

For a better index of Linux affinity, well you might want to look at:
http://www.linux-laptop.net/

And remember if you get the laptop today and don't plan on converting it 
for two or three years then the picture might look quite different by 
then.  You might try booting prospective laptops with Knoppix to see how 
it does recognizing the hardware (as well as giving the sales clerk a 
heart attack!).

A couple of pieces of advice I received on components: Fast laptop 
drives are expensive and you're not going to notice the difference for 
most applications.  Video editing was repeatedly mentioned as the 
exception to this.  Similarly faster processors simply don't earn their 
keep.  Look around 1.7 gig.  Faster processors chew up batteries and 
generate heat without speeding up things noticeably.  And again, there's 
quite a price jump.  I have no direct experience with this so I'm 
relying upon advice.  If anyone knows I'm full of it please don't be shy 
about saying so. Preferably before my 1.7 gig laptop with the big honkin 
but slow drive arrives! ;-) 

I like the TrackPoint as well.  I also find that I really appreciate the 
biggest, clearest screen I can get.  To me that's worth putting money 
into.  I don't play many games (okay, freecell) these days but I find I 
do like music and the idea of being able to take mine with me appeals to 
me. And I'm hearing that a DVD burner is the new "gotta have" as well as 
the memory key.  Think about BlueTooth for connecting to peripherals.  
Again, no direct experience with these, just passing on the advice I 
thought was good.

Good luck and I wouldn't mind hearing what you get and how happy you are 
with it.

I got a Toshiba laptop for $650 (Fry's Memorial day sale) which edits video 
just fine, capturing OK to both the internal 40G drive and external 80G 
laptop drive in a little pocket sized enclosure.

Didn't print to tape from the laptop drive, but prints to tape from 
standard 3 1/2" external USB drives.

This is with Vegas3 on windows XP.


(anyone know of comparable editing programs on Linux?)

Thanks

I know they have any iffy reputation lately, but I still really like my
Dells and wouldn't hazard to purchase another one from them.

If you look at where they're failing, it's in "customer service" - they
don't spend hours on the phone with a technophobe explaining how to
remove viruses and stuff from their systems.  I had to call tech support
with a recent laptop and although I had to wait on hold for 20 minutes,
once I was through I didn't have any issues getting the information I
needed from the tech.

If you pay for it, I think Dell is about the best out there.  I didn't
pay for anything extra and had my keyboard flake out on me about six
months after purchase.  I contacted Dell and FedEx dropped off a box the
next morning.  I convinced the FedEx driver to come back in 20 minutes
and off the laptop went.  Three days later the laptop was back here in
fine working order.

That's with the cheapest warranty they had.  If you pay for the nicer
warranties, the service you get is significantly better - and I
considered my service quite nice.

> 2)  Mostly Linux compatable.

The only thing I haven't gotten working on my (2.5 year old) laptop is
advanced ACPI support for things like suspending it to memory and such.
 Their new laptops tend to have decent Linux support in every area
except for Wifi - and that may have changed recently.  It used to be to
use the built-in wifi cards, you had to use that ndiswrapper driver.

However, you said wifi didn't interest you.  :-)

Dell has reached out a bit to the Linux community.  They had somebody in
contact with the linux-dell-laptops mailing list a few years back and
set up a website and such with information on it, including laptop
information.  I don't know that they've invested *money* in Linux, but
they have spent at least a little bit of time to appease the community.

I've never heard of "IBM-style trackpoints" - Dell used to ship with
dual touchpad/pointingstick setups, but it seems they've dropped the
pointing sticks in favor of touchpads within the last two years.  Too
bad, I really liked the pointing sticks.  My touchpad does just fine for
me, though, and is quite adjustable in Linux.  If I drop the speed, etc,
down, it works fine in "jittery" environments.  What is the trackpoint
like, exactly?

A 1.5GHz Pentium M is likely going to outperform a 2GHz Pentium 4, FWIW.
 Don't get sucked in to the MHz Myth!  If your CPU speed isn't for
graphics or audio, what *is* it for?  Are you sure you need the CPU
power you think you need?

That's such a bad call.  :-)

Hard drives are the biggest bottleneck in computers today.  Applications
load faster, the system boots faster, if you swap out it becomes more
responsive... all with a faster hard drive.  And believe me, going from
a 4200RPM IBM drive to a 5400RPM Seagate drive in my laptop has given
this little system new life.  It went from sluggish to snappy.

Spend the money for the fast hard drive, you won't regret it.  They
aren't generally very expensive, either.  This 60GB 5400RPM drive with
8MB of cache (the 16MB cache Toshibas are also nice, but not as fast for
some reason) was somewhere around $80 from Newegg.

RAM and hard drive are the two most important components in a laptop for
performance.  A sluggish hard drive will kill the whole system... and
even the "fast" hard drives aren't as fast as their full-sized desktop
counterparts.  So get yourself a lot of RAM to compensate.  I wouldn't
even CONSIDER having less than 512MB, and wouldn't purchase a new laptop
today for myself with less than a gigabyte of RAM in it.

You'd find better general computing performance out of a laptop with the
slowest MHz rating available, a gig of RAM, and the fastest hard drive
available than you'd find with that same laptop with the fastest CPU,
half a gig of RAM, and a medium-grade hard drive.

Keith,

   I had excellent experiences with the Toshiba Libretto and Portege; still
have the latter and it's being upgraded to Slackware-10.2 (from 8.x or 9.x)
today. My Sony Vaio PCG-V505BC is also a good mahine, but it has the large
touch plate rather than the pencil eraser for a pointy thing. My one
experience with a Gateway portable (in 1992, a 486DX/25 machine) was so bad
that I vowed to never consider them again for anything. And I haven't.

   My specific recommendation is to call Emperor Linux on Monday and ask for
their experiences with different vendors and models. They sell -- and support
-- a range of portables each with linux pre-installed for us users. I know
there are other vendors, but I've had experience with only Emperor Linux.

   For physical, hardware repair I've used Northwest Computer Support in SW
Beaverton. They've done well for me.

Good luck!

Rich

Rob,

Thanks for the advice.  I had to go back and check my hole card.  Dell 
DOES make a VERY slow 4400 rpm drive for some models that I wouldn't 
consider.  The "slow" hard drive I ordered has a 5400 rpm as opposed to 
the more expensive 7200 rpm models.  I did notice they made a 100 gig 
7200 rpm drive I'd have been glad to pay for but because my account said 
"small business" instead of "personal" I couldn't see the inspiron 
models at all.  That was annoying.

Well, we'll see.  I did save a few bucks from the budget on this machine 
and was planning on getting a nice flat screen monitor when their prices 
drop.

Thanks for the advice.  If I think the machine is a dog I'll look at 
swapping that drive out first.  I got the gig of ram as well.

Have a good one.

My Compaq came with a feature that I dearly love - an on-off switch 
for the touchpad. (All Compaqs have this, I think.) It's so annoying 
to have your thumb accidentally hit the touchpad while typing.

I had a laptop before with the trackpoint thing and I hated it. But I 
also dislike touchpads. I went to Fry's and gave them about $30 for 
a Logitech optical cordless USB mouse. The USB receiver is a 
litltle stick that looks like a flash drive, so there are no wires. It's 
only a couple inches long. It even comes in various colors, so I got 
one in silver to match the laptop. It has a little fabric case that 
holds the mouse and USB stick.

When I boot the laptop the touchpad is automatically working. If I 
forget to put the USB receiver in a USB port before turning the 
computer on, I can stick it in anytime and the mouse then works 
automatically too. The USB hotplug system works just like it is 
supposed to.

I thought of just disabling the touchpad since I don't like it, but it's 
nice to have in case I get somewhere and forgot the mouse at 
home, or the batteries died, etc. -- although the two AA batteries 
last a long time, and the mouse has an on-off switch on the 
bottom, too. The receiver, mouse with batteries and case weigh 
only 150 grams. Getting this little mouse was one of my better 
moves.

Keith,

   I cannot comment on the dual nature of viewing different screens locally
and via the external projector; my notebooks display the same thing as they
push out the external monitor port. That written, I can offer what may be the
solution you seek: The "beamer" class in LaTeX/LyX. I use this for my
presentations (two in the past month) and it's the best computer-generated
slide preparation/display system I've used over the past dozen or so years.

   Ignoring the ease of preparation and control, as well as the typeset output
(particularly with math), I'll explain the ability to navigate among the
slides.

   The slides are compiled to PDF so any Adobe Reader can display them. I
create the presentations on my linux system and show them on the local
Microsoft system; transfer is via USB 'thumb' drive. This format also permits
me to send the slides as an e-mail attachment that anyone can view.

   Along the bottom of each slide are a series of very faint images. These are
used to navigate around the presentation. From the left to right they let the
presenter move back and forward by slide, frame, subsection, section, and
beginning/end. Putting acroread into full-screen display mode (ctrl-l), and
the cursor on the advance-one-slide icon, allows me to advance the display by
pressing the left mouse button. The cursor is invisible, but still positioned
in the proper place.

   If I had to navigate to a slide whose location I did not remember, I would
press ctrl-l to reduce the display size and expose the presentation layout tree
in Reader's separate frame on the left. Here is display the presentation
outline by section and subsection. Clicking on the appropriate heading
displays the appropriate slide. Full screen display can then be restored.

   It's a fabulous system, better than foil, prosper, seminar, and other LaTeX
slide classes. I'll send a copy of the presentation I gave to the BLM last
week to anyone who requests it (761K file) so you can see how easy it is to
navigate. Another great feature is that the outline is shown at the top of
each frame so the audience knows where you are in the context of the whole
presentation.

   As I wrote, it works great in LyX, too, which makes creating an application
very fast and convenient -- except for the thinking, of course. I've become a
very big fan of LaTeX/LyX. I use the Beamer class for slide preparation and I
use PSTricks to create vector graphics directly in PostScript; they can be
included in a LaTeX document when compiled with ps4pdf. What a great set of
tools for technical writing!

HTH,

Rich

Generally real work doesn't require much CPU power.  People have been
doing real work for centuries without CPUs at all!  :-)

Sounds like.  In fact, the mgt. at my company is scrambling to polish
up a similar sort of presentation.  BTW, who's the AEA?

That's one thing that often annoys me about slideware--mouse-click to
go forward, but how to go back?  Just about every slideshow I've seen
has been interrupted as the presenter mouses around trying to go back
a couple slides.

Indeed.  I think maybe PowerPoint supports something like that on
systems set up for dual screens.  I'll have to ask our marketing guy,
who uses a cute li'l Dell notebook in dual-screen mode.

If not, it's a really cool idea.  Couple it with well-defined keyboard
commands and maybe a small 4-button USB remote-control.

Hm.  I wonder if there's a way to design slideware that even Edward
Tufte would like?  (See "The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint".)

What about Apple? I have nothing but good things to say about my  
experiences with their notebooks! My iBook got 4 hours of battery  
life. 4 hours, one battery (1.4 GHz)! I have since upgraded to a  
Powerbook which gets around 2.5 hours (1.67 GHz), but thats still not  
bad compared to my old Thinkpad (2 GHz) which burnt out in about an  
hour or so. Applecare, has demonstrated to me to have a turnaround in  
less than a week (although price of Applecare is arguably a little  
much). iBooks and Powerbooks are almost totally Linux compatible  
(there are some issues with Wireless, but hey, nothing new there). In  
addition to duel booting, when I need quick access to Linux for some  
reason, I fire up Virtual PC with Debian with absolutely no problems.  
Virtual PC restores my Linux session in about 30 seconds.

Besides, now that I have an Apple, all the time I used to spend  
suffering with Windows XP, I now spend with OS X... a POSIX OS.

My 2 cents.

Sounds dubious to me.  What happens when you plug a phone directly
into the ATA?  Have you tried a different ATA?

The phone-line interface bits aren't cheap.  Digium FxO/FxS cards
start in the $300 range.  The cards support up to 4 lines, so it
sounds like you could do with a 1-FxO (for the landline) and 3-FxS
(for the phone stations) setup on one card.

Another way is to use an ATA for the stations.  Atcom makes a decent
4-FxS ATA for pretty cheap.  Then use one of the $100 softmodem-based
1-FxO cards for the landline.

Good idea.  There are wholesale VoIP line vendors that support
Asterisk's IAX protocol, which is more robust than SIP.

You could go to penguin day in the morning, then the clinic in the 
afternoon. Of course, you might miss something either way.

The problem is that the call comes in on a Qwest line at impedance A,
then goes out to the remote extension (through the ATA) at impedance B.
That's where the echo comes from. By itself, the ATA works fine.

Yeah, I've seen those on ebay. Not cheap.

Why not a Digium FXO clone for $10 (on ebay)?

Looks like most of them are around $2/month + $.03/minute. That's pretty
good.

Thanks.

I hate to say it, but Powerpoint already offers this capability for
dual-head Windows boxes.  The gist of it is the slideshow is displayed
on the secondary monitor (i.e. the output on the laptop) while the
main powerpoint window remains displayed on the primary monitor,
including the sidebar with slide previews that allows you to quickly
jump around.  You can even enter notes for your presentation that are
displayed on the laptop screen but not on the actual slideshow.

I do not know if such capabilities are possible with other software,
but given how much trouble I've had with configuring dual-head on
demand, I think there are some other issues to overcome first.  For
example, it is not possible (that I know of) to add a second display
to your system without restarting X, thus forcing you to restart all X
applications you have running.  In the past I've overcome this by
using the text login and two different xorg.conf files, but there
really should be a way to change this on the fly, so you don't have to
kill X.

Of course, I'm just ranting without providing a patch, so I guess I
don't really have any right to complain :-)

Yeah.  But it is possible to start a second server if the display 
hardware is available.  Some have used vnc to integrate this into the 
already running desktop.  With any non-xinerama setup, you can't drag 
apps to the new display anyway, so I don't see why you wouldn't just do 
this for dual-head on demand.

Hmm, this will require some experimentation.  My laptop has an Nvidia
graphics chip in it, and I'm not sure how the second display is
exported.  When I was experimenting before I was using the
Nvidia-provided drivers, but I tend to avoid those now.  Those drivers
provided dual-display through some proprietary extension, so I'm not
sure they export two displays.  I'll experiment if I have some time
:-)

I'll second the mention of Toshiba making pretty reliable laptops. The
reviews I've heard are fairly old as the folks with those laptops still
have them.

Panasonic is another one to consider. I've got no idea about their
service, but their "ToughBooks" are designed to take major abuse and so
aren't supposed to need it. I've heard they do tend to last. I vaguely
recall a mention that the other Panasonic laptops tend to be fairly
rugged, but no certainty here.

Alas that rules out /current/ Apple laptops. Apple has a good reputation,
but of course they're PowerPC. They might make an amd64 laptop in the
future, though my current information is PPC is still far ahead in power
consumption (delaying the transition for laptops).

What is the scale for the 2GHz number? Athlon 64 2GHz? Pentium M 2GHz?
Pentium 4 2GHz?

The Pentium Ms (present on "Centrino" laptops, or those that explicitly
say "Pentium M" rather than "Pentium 4M") appear to be derived from the
Pentium III core, and provide *far* superior performance per clock cycle
in addition to better power consumption. The Athlon 64s match fairly well
to Pentium Ms of the same clock speed, and both masacre Pentium 4(M)s of
the same clock speed. I'm unsure of the exact matchup, but a P-M 1.6GHz
should compare favorably to a P4 2.4GHz.

They do, I have three Tecra 8xxx series laptops, all three still work, I got
them used, they are probably 8-10 years old by now. The problem with new
Toshiba laptops is that they all have that damn piece of glass in front of
the LCD now. If you like looking at your own face all day it must be the
coolest invention ever.

On my (desktop) ge-force 4 card, the X config looks like so:

#########
Section "Device"
    Identifier  "NVIDIA GeForce4 0"
    Driver      "nvidia"
    VendorName  "TI4600"
    BusID       "PCI:1:5:0"
        Option        "UseInt10Module" "on"
    Screen      0
EndSection

Section "Device"
    Identifier  "NVIDIA GeForce4 1"
    Driver      "nvidia"
    VendorName  "TI4600"
    BusID       "PCI:1:5:0"
    Screen      1
EndSection
#########

According to XF86Config-4, the "Screen" value is mandatory for cards 
that can drive more than one display.  The BusID entries are because 
I'm using a second card for the third head.

IIRC, the matrox cards are setup slightly differently, but it's been too 
long since I've messed with those.

Same here, I have an old Toshiba Portege from around '97 that still
works, except the sound card isn't supported by Linux.  No loss there,
I use it as a print server these days (low power, quiet, etc.).

That's not limited to Toshiba laptops, a lot of laptop displays seem
to have the shiny finish now (including my HP).  Whatever happened to
anti-glare finish?

Yes, but the question was whether the open-source nv driver supports a
setup like this.  I dislike using the close-source driver, and in fact
would avoid Nvidia (and ATI) altogether if I could, but the Intel
graphics that come with Centrino laptops are pitiful (and usually
lower resolution).  If I can ever get out of Windows today I'll
experiment.

Ah, wish I could go back to Matrox.  Anybody know if they make a
mobile version of the Millenium cards?  I'd buy that for a dollar...

While the machine has no relevance from a software perspective, but from 
a hardware durability perspective, I'm still using an old Toshiba 
T2000SX that was used when I got it over 10 years ago. The hard drive 
has finally died, so I only boot MS-DOS from a floppy to run an X-10 
control program from time to time, but it still does that quite reliably.

I'll add my name to the list of people with very old Toshiba laptops.
As I mentioned a few weeks (a few months?) ago, some friends have a 486
DX4/75 Toshiba laptop that still plugs along with all original hardware
(sans the battery, of course).  Mom recently started using her old PII
266 Toshiba again - its original hard drive died a few years ago, but
it's been plugging along just fine for email and web browsing with a
replacement drive and some additional RAM.

That said, the 2003-era Toshiba we had (that died when a glass of water
was dumped in it) was far less sturdy and reliable.  It felt flimsy,
even compared to my supercheap Dell... and just didn't have that
reliable feeling I get when working with other machines.

It does. It isn't so much a proprietary extension, as a proprietary
method of configuring it. From the outside it looks and behaves just like
Xinerama, except with better performance because the graphics engine
handles both displays at the same time rather than having to replicate
the drawing commands for two displays.

Unfortunately for you, you've named all three of the remaining
non-embedded graphics chip companies. The former two are also aiming for
the embedded market (though a much more powerful one than the traditional
embedded market).

At least good drivers exist for the former two. The closed-source nVIDIA
driver works extremely well. The open-source ATi driver does 2D just
fine.

To my knowledge no one has bought Matrox yet, but I wouldn't be surprised
if it happens at some point here (or failing that they go bankrupt). Good
luck finding a laptop with a Matrox chip, the above three own the entire
market now. Unless someone has a stockpile of them they're selling off
you're unlikely to find a new Matrox chip in the next couple years.

Message-ID: <86slvbedqb.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


I am writing a set of scripts on Knoppix (derived from the recent
4.0.2 version) to facilitate some unskilled-in-Linux/
unskilled-in-computers folks doing some data collection for us.  I am
not a KDE person in my normal life, but while researching how to
facilitate these operations on Knoppix, I found kdialog, which does
some graphic user interaction and is like to be handy for dressing
things up a bit.

One of the things I'd like to do, but that I don't see that kdialog
supports, is a kind of scrolling output monitoring window (i.e., the
stdout of some process) with a "Quit" button.  Right now, in
developer==user mode, I quit with Ctrl-C in an xterm.  I don't have
the time to write anything elaborate to do this myself.  

I am thinking of an interface either like this:

  $ foo | bar

where foo is a process (that I supply) that outputs information and
bar (which is what I am looking for) displays it, and kills foo when
bar quits (or provides enough information to do it in a shell script
using pid's).  Or maybe an interface like:

  $ bar --command=foo

Any ideas?

Indeed.  Perhaps I will have to support the Open Graphics Project when
they reach the point of having something to sell.

I did not say that the closed-source nvidia driver didn't work well, I
have used it.  I object to it because it requires a closed source
binary kernel module, and my personal view is that it violates the GPL
requirements of the kernel.  Others disagree with this, and perhaps we
will never reach a consensus on it, but the fact remains that I would
prefer (if possible) to support a company who provides open-source
drivers for their products.

I think Matrox still has a foothold in the workstation market, since
they pretty much specialize in dual/triple-head displays with strong
2D graphics for photo/video editing.  I guess they have PCIe Parhelia
stuff now, which I didn't know about until today.  I assumed they
hadn't added anything that wasn't AGP.

I guess just:

For example, try:

  $ xterm -e yes

That's going to take two entirely different kind of search and destroy 
semantics.  In any case, the latter should be a fairly simple use of  
IPC::Run and (insert gui widget here.)

Seems like the former would require you to look in proc to find commands 
with matching parent id's.  Am I missing something there?

At the risk of getting roundly booed for favoring a non-free program 
(MindManager) that runs on a non-free OS (Windows), I think the 
Presentation Mode of MindManager is far superior to PowerPoint. As a 
bonus, you can export the MindMap to PowerPoint for the 
"traditionalists" and the handouts.

I haven't checked recently, but the open source "FreeMind" program might 
be able to do a presentation as well, though certainly not as elegantly 
as MindManager. Sometimes you *do* get what you pay for. :)

I don't work my laptops hard enough to worry about this, but I'm

The last time I needed a laptop repair was a Toshiba and they did very well.

Intel as opposed to Athlon? Or Intel as opposed to PowerPC/Macintosh? I 
have a Compaq Presario 2110US with an Athlon XP in it and it works just 
fine with Windows XP and Gentoo Linux. It's been a while since I put any 
other flavor of Linux on it, but the touchpad and display and NIC and 
USB and PCMCIA all work just fine with 2.6.12. The only gotchas with 
this one are the USB port is only 1.1 and the disk drive is slow.

I haven't seen a laptop with a trackpoint other than IBM in quite a 
while. Toshibas used to have them, but they've gone the touchpad route 
lately as well. With the add-on Synaptics code, I've gotten so used to 
the touchpad that I might find it difficult to go back to a trackpoint. 
For example, a one-finger tap is a left click, a two-finger tap is a 
middle click and a three-finger tap is a right click.

One of the other posters asked what you need the speed for ... I guess I 
have the same question. In any event, one thing you might do is pick the 
machine that can support the largest RAM and, as someone suggested, pay 
the extra $US for a faster hard drive. How critical is lightness and 
power efficiency to you? I think you said you need rugged, so if you can 
handle some weight and don't mind running on a power cord when you need 
the speed, you can probably afford to put in lots of RAM and a fast hard 
drive.

The job control I can probably figure out.  It is the "which gui

"Show me the money". I'll believe it is viable when they've actually got
hardware to sell. They'll also need an EvilOS driver as well (dual-boot
machines).

Both have open source drivers, but those don't do anywhere near the
amount of 3D acceleration that the closed source ones do. It is quite
possible for software to do the remaining pieces, but you still lose
performance.

The generally cited reason for them being closed source is to conceal
patent violations that aren't known about. They aren't knowingly
violating patents, but there are too many landmines to risk it. The Open
Graphics folks will have to deal with this when it arises, will they
survive the experience?

Where did you see mention of a PCIe Parhelia? The Parhelia looked to be
a failure, slower and much more expensive than anything out of ATi or
nVIDIA. If they really do still have a foothold in the workstation
market, I'd hazard a guess that it is mostly folks who say "no one was
ever fired for buying Matrox". There aren't any Matrox chips I consider
viable on their own merits unless three displays really is a crucial
feature to you.

Neither ATi nor nVIDIA make any chips that can handle less than two heads
at this point. There are some laptops and cards where this ability is
disabled, but they *all* support two monitors. Apple did manage to
thoroughly disable it on their iBooks with nVIDIA chips, but nVIDIA never
made a laptop chip without the ability. By contrast a simple OpenFirmware
program can reenable it on iBooks with ATi chips.

Tk::ROText sounds about right, assuming that you want it in Tk.  Looks 
like "see Tk::Text" for documentation.

Subject: [PLUG] debian - testing ( etch ) question
Message-ID: <1128920761.15094.4.camel@badger.had1.or.comcast.net.>

Hi.
I'm trying to recover from a hard drive crash. I was running debian
testing, which has since become stable. In the meantime, I put up a temp
system on an older box. I'm pretty sure I did a CD install for testing
(It had been sitting there for a while). 

On the temp system, I found a really cool application called
'knetattach'. I also had battle of wesnoth and falconseye.

In this new system, which I've installed from a net install CD
(downloaded today), I can't find these in the package manager. How do I
figure out which package contains these apps?

I'm pretty sure the games were in their individual package (I remember
doing an apt-get install wesnoth and an apt-get install falcons-eye) but
I think that the knetattach was part of kdebase. But I may be wrong.

Any tips would be terrific.
Russ

Subject: [PLUG] gnome / fish / knetattach
Message-ID: <1128968707.4666.6.camel@badger.had1.or.comcast.net.>

Good morning.
I'm sorry if this is a repeat, but I don't see my message in the PLUG
list news group. 

My home linux server crashed and I'm reinstalling. In the mean time, I
was using a box I set up for my kids when someone whined that linux
doesn't have any games (I sure showed them!). It was debian testing (the
one that just became stable, woody?). Now I'm installing a new testing
(etch) with a 2.6 kernel, and I had found on the woody box a few neat
things I want on this box.

The first, and most important; In Gnome, which I'm trying to use as
opposed to my "normal" KDE or Enlightenment, I had a menu option for
connecting to a remote server via ssh. It turned out to use the fish://
protocol. On the etch box I'm winding up using sftp. When I used the
fish protocol, I could open the files directly on the remote server. But
with sftp, I can't; the file offers to open but comes back as empty.

This is mildly important just because I'd like to use the Bluefish
editor to modify some remote php scripts, but I can of course ssh in and
use vi. It'd just add to the 'ooh cool' factor. I'm pretty sure that the
toybox was using 'knetattach' which was in 'kdebase' but I installed
kdebase on etch and it didn't have knetattach. So what am I doing wrong?
Do I have to figure out how to install a stable package on testing
machine? 

The other programs were battle for wesnoth (can't find it in etch) and
falcons eye. (ditto). 

Sincerely,
Russ Gilman-Hunt

Message-ID: <9e0a35780510101929y41e1dca4sa909e715247f23de@mail.gmail.com>

I've basically accomplished what I wanted by using the loop device. Another
option that I played with briefly, but should also work, is by using the
Network Block Device.

Here's a brief tutorial:

I have 4 remote filesystems mounted. One is using sshfs, one is using Samba
from a Windows server, and 2 are using NFS from two different NetApp filers.

I then create a 1G file on each mount point and also one on my local file
system...

dd if=/dev/zero of=/sshfs/matt0 bs=1M count=1024
dd if=/dev/zero of=/samba/matt1 bs=1M count=1024
dd if=/dev/zero of=/nfs1/matt2 bs=1M count=1024
dd if=/dev/zero of=/nfs2/matt3 bs=1M count=1024
dd if=/dev/zero of=/home/matt/matt4 bs=1M count=1024

I then create a loop device for each file...

losetup /dev/loop0 /sshfs/matt0
losetup /dev/loop1 /samba/matt1
losetup /dev/loop2 /nfs1/matt2
losetup /dev/loop3 /nfs2/matt3
losetup /dev/loop4 /home/matt/matt4

I then create a RAID5 array from the loop devices...

mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=5 --raid-devices=5 /dev/loop0 /dev/loop1
/dev/loop2 /dev/loop3 /dev/loop4

I then create a filesystem and mount it...

mkfs.ext3 /dev/md0
mount /dev/md0 /mnt/matt

I have two USB storage devices, one is a Sandisk Cruzer Micro and the
other is a USB CompactFlash reader (a CameraMate CF Card Reader, I
picked up from CompUSA on Friday evening).  I plug in the Cruzer, is
becomes /dev/sda and I mount it's only partition /dev/sda1.  Later, I
plug in the CameraMate, and *somehow* it rescans the devices into
different places!

/proc/mounts doesn't change, but the desktop shows /dev/sdb1 and
/dev/sdc1, and no /dev/sda1!  My mount point /mnt/foo where /dev/sda1
had been is empty!  Even though /proc/mounts still shows it there.

WTF!

Anybody seen this before?  Know of a fix?

Message-ID: <1128977819.2719.278.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hi

Just installed a wireless card on my laptop..

Also, a WAP to go with it...

I hate doing two new things at the same time..


Any way..

I am using a Linksys Wireless-B Broadband router.

I will assume it is working well...

I am using one of the ethernet ports on the router and it is doing NAT
and my desktop computer can get out....  So I feel/know that part is
working correct.   I configured the SSID with a name and selected a
channel  (6)..


The laptop is running a Prism 1 card..

And it is detected and loads Orinoco drivers.
I have an ethernet card that I can run in the laptop so I know it loads
PCMCIA drivers also...

Well, Turn everything on and I don't get a wireless link...  No ip
address on the laptop..  It thinks it is up but, no IP..

What would be my next trouble shooting step......

I am running ubuntu 5.04 if that makes a difference..

Thanks

Vram

Could you elaborate on what kind of stuff you want to do?

You may find that ps2edit coupled with a graphic layout tool, or
pdftk, or pdfjam will do what you want, depending on what it is.

   I've no idea what manipulations are done by Acrobat 7 Professional, but
there are the pdftk (PDF Toolkit) and pdf2ascii as well as other tools.

I'm not going to answer your questions in specifics but in general

dpkg -S `which knetattach` will show you what the source for a package
is if it's currently installed in your system.

apt-cache search knetattach will tell you if apt, knows about your
package
apt-cache show knetattach will tell you more detailed information about
the package.

Make sure you have network addresses included in
your /etc/apt/sources.list file to get new/update packages.  Installing
from a CD is only the first step.

The other thing you can do is go to http://package.debian.org and search
for your program.

Did you set the ESSID on the laptop as well?  /sbin/iwconfig will do
it for testing, I'm not sure how permanent configuration works on

'course; my sources.list looks like this:

http://packages.debian.org/ - the 'search' function is dysfunctional
(but you can use google), and it's not in the obvious places in either 
http://packages.debian.org/testing/kde/
or

Thanks anyway, I guess I'll muddle through.

Try running `gksudo network-admin` from the command line. Alternately
you can get to it from the Configure button on the Network Moniter
applet.

When you configure the wireless card the ESSID drop down will list all
of the Networks it can "hear" when you run the program. You can also
chose to use dhcp or set a static ip address there.

I also had this issue. You might try switching to tty4 (alt + f4) to watch log 
output. Second, you might try booting the failsafe option: Install -- safe 
system. 

My problem was that the installer was hanging/freezing when loading the DAC960 
module. How I fixed my issue was shut the system down for 5 minutes, then try 
again.  I was installing Suse Linux 10.0.

HTH,

I've heard about that. What I need to do is convert
.doc to .pdf and then arrange the pages to look like a
booklet, so the printer can use it in that form. Why
.doc? Because a Webmaster puts my soft copy on the
Web, and claims he can't use anything else. If he
doesn't do the Web authoring, I'll have to do it
myself.

Adobe 7 Professional does this--that is, you can
clickbookize the pages. However, if you want to get a
legal copy of Adobe instead of risking identity theft,
with your friendly neighborhood (?--usually in Russia)
Warez shoppe, it will set you back.

Ah, thank you for describing what you want to do.

OpenOffice Writer makes nice PDFs from word-processing documents,
including Wicrosoft Merde .doc files.

But you'll actually have the easiest time if you can get your Webster
to print to a PostScript file.  That way, any formatting or layout
issues are entirely in that person's hands, rather than yours.

Typically, for a booklet layout, I use PSTools.  "psbook" rearranges a
Postscript file's page order to make booklets of various sizes.
By default, it assumes you're folding the whole stack of pages in
half, which at higher page-counts becomes impractical.  In those
cases, you can set the signature to a foldable number of pages,
such as 16.  The printer should be able to suggest a number.

I then use "psnup -2 -pletter" to rescale and arrange the pages 2-up
on letter-size paper.  The "impose" utility is also nice for this,
since it senses the actual document size and scales accordingly.

The printer will likely want PDF, so you can use ps2pdf or something to
convert the Postscript-format booklet into PDF.

This is all commandline stuff, which is nice since you can script it,
do it consistently and even automatically.

But who reads long emails anyway,
  Aaron

Yes, I figured out the problem for MY machine. It was a marginal 
CD-Drive. I replaced it with another drive and was able to continue with 
the installation.

Here's part of the last message I sent the list on the subject:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
MARGINAL CD DRIVE WAS THE PROBLEM.

I changed the CD drive for another I had in an otherwise dead machine, 
and tried again, this time it boots and runs the install just fine.

Since I had installed SuSE 9.1 on the machine, and upgrading from the CD 
set to 9.3 is an option, I'm giving that a try to see how it goes. If it 
is clean, I may use that approach to upgrade this system -- but only 
after backups, of course.

There's only 5:36:21 to go, so I'll have to wait to declare success. 
Hmmm. Now there's 5:42:28, and it says that it's looking at CD2 even 
though CD 2 is sitting on my desk!

Be sure to tune in next week for the continuation of our saga.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm afraid I never sent anything regarding how it finally turned out. In 
spite of the "time remaining" and other install messages, it finally did 
finish and is a working installation. I haven't had time to use it, or 
to upgrade this machine since then, but I'm satisfied that the process 
will work when I get to it.

Currently I'm seeing no easy way to do this without much script-fu.  Anyone 
have a trick for this?  My other option is to set log rotation to 30

Kris,

   I've no idea what nagios are (a generic Nachos?), but the first thought
that comes to mind is a shell script that runs every 30 minutes via cron.
You could pipe the output through awk to extract the appropriate time period,
then pipe that to grep. Will that not work?

sed -ne "/^$(date -d '30 min ago' +'%b %e %H:%M:')/,/\$/p" dhcp.log |\
   grep 'no free leases'

This assumes that dhcp.log will contain at least one timestamped entry 
per minute. Why that's so is an exercise left to the reader. :-)

While not exactly what you're looking for, there are a few utilities
which will maintain a record of where they last looked at a log file and
return only the entries since.  I'm thinking specifically of 'logtail'
from Psionic's 'logcheck' project; 'epylog' also has a similar
capability.  Might be hard to find since Cisco subsumed Psionic, taking
logcheck and portsentry down with it; the source is on my FTP server:
http://ftp.nakedape.cc/nakedape/misc/logcheck/

Thank you 

I did do that...

And when I did that I noticed the card was at   2.437MHz

So had to go back and change the WAP.  I had that on 2.44 MH

Didn't change anything .

Still doesn't connect. 

So it must be something different...


Thanks again

Is your dhcp client running ? (/sbin/dhclient)
I'm running Ubuntu and when I need to connect to a wifi hotspot, I have to

Thank you 

I did do that...

And when I did that I noticed the card was at   2.437MHz

So had to go back and change the WAP.  I had that on 2.44 MH

Didn't change anything .

Still doesn't connect. 

So it must be something different...


Thanks again

Thanks for the input..

I can run it by hand

#dhclient

And see the discover messages...

It is just not connecting..


I need to take either my laptop or my WAP somewhere else and see
if anyone else can connect..


Thanks

Turns out I didn't look closely enough at the check_log nagios plugin,
which does exactly what I want to:

"On the first run of the plugin, it will return an OK state with a message 
of "Log check data initialized".  On successive runs, it will return an OK 
state if *no* pattern matches have been found in the *difference* between 
the log file and the older copy of the log file.  If the plugin detects 
any pattern matches in the log diff, it will return a CRITICAL state and 
print out a message is the following format: "(x) last_match", where "x" 
is the total number of pattern matches found in the file and "last_match" 
is the last entry in the log file which matches the pattern."

Sweet.  This is even useful outside of Nagios.

Google sez you gotta edit xorg.conf (or XF86Config-4 on older
versions) and change DefaultDepth from 24 to 16.

Unfortunately, the state of the software industry has convinced most
people that "license" == "paid for".

I would guess that few people outside the tech industry know the

Not to mention this:

A prevalent corporate cliche from the past century was that you couldn't 
get fired for buying IBM. But over time, even slow-to-awaken purchasing 
managers recognized that you could buy a reliable computer without 
leaning on Big Blue. With multiple credible alternatives, IBM's 
marketplace dominance began to erode.

No mention that IBM is one of several very large companies putting cash

Subject: [PLUG] ATI 9250 Sapphire Drivers
Message-ID: <434F2927.8030203@verizon.net>

I'm a new Linux user. I'd been meaning to get started using Linux on my 
own computer for a long time. However, as I am now taking a class on 
Linux at CCC, I now have an excuse. My initial intent was to get a 
second hard drive, add that to my existing computer, and load Linux on 
that. However, I have come into one problem - my graphics card is an ATI 
9250 Sapphire. I am aware that ATI graphics cards have had pretty poor 
Linux Driver support, so I wasn't suprised that I hadn't found any. 
However, as I'd rather not build another computer, or buy another 
graphics card, I'm hoping to a certain extent that the only reason I 
hadn't found any Linux drivers for the ATI 9250 was because I just 
wasn't looking hard enough. Is this the case? And if there aren't any 
drivers for my graphics card, what's a good graphics card with good 
Linux support that I could pick up to replace it?

The Linux distro I'm planning on installing is Fedora Core 3 (if that 
helps at all). If you need any other system specifications, let me know.

Join us for a Qt Designer HOWTO presentation by Rob Wehrli!

Rob Wehrli will demonstrate using Qt Designer on GNU/Linux to produce
X  
Window graphical user interface applications written in C++.  Rob will  
discuss some of the nuances and annoyances with using Qt Designer
(v3.3)  
while showing how to build an application from start to finish.  Note
that  
this will not be a Qt API-related discussion!  No prior Qt application  
development exposure is required.  Basic C/C++ skills are helpful,
though  
not necessarily required.  Slated for discussion are:


1: Qt Designer General Overview
-what is it?
-how do I get it?
-what can I do with it?
-what can't it do?

2: Using Qt Designer - Basics
-projects & project settings
-basic filesystem structure

3: Hello, World Qt Designer Style
-create a new C++ project
-add a Dialog to the project
-add some widgets to the Dialog
-previewing the GUI
-compile and run (with various styles)

4: Customizing Qt Designer
-fonts and syntax color coding
-templates

5: Questions and Answers (maybe, dumb looks are still free...)

Standard meeting rules apply.

I'm running that same card in my system, and Mandrake 10.1, Mandriva 
2005 and 2006 all work out of the box.

I suspect Fedora will too.

Give it a try.

Subject: [PLUG] wvdial, pppd, and permissions insanity
Message-ID: <200510140828.37223.carla@bratgrrl.com>

OK gang, this is driving me nuts.

I want to let non-privileged users run wvdial. It works on Debian. Here is how 
it's set up:

$ ls -l `which wvdial`
-rwxr-xr-x ?1 root root 98408 Jan 21 ?2005 /usr/bin/wvdial

$ ls -l `which wvdialconf`
-rwxr-xr-x ?1 root root 48968 Jan 21 ?2005 /usr/bin/wvdialconf

$ ls -l /usr/sbin/pppd
-rwsr-xr-- ?1 root dip 232536 Dec 30 ?2004 /usr/sbin/pppd

$ ls -l /dev/ttyS0
crw-rw---- ?1 root dialout 4, 64 Oct 14 00:31 /dev/ttyS0

Easy peasey. I don't have to change a thing. This lets users set up their own 
private dialup configs in 
~/.wvdialrc, and also use the global config in /etc/wvdial.conf. No problems, 
every one is happy, the sun shines, life is good. Any user who need dialup 
services merely needs to be put in the 'dialout' group, with no other 
changes. 

Then we come to CentOS, which is a Red hat clone. (cue ominous music).

$ ls -l /dev/ttyS2
crw-rw---- ?1 root uucp 4, 64 Oct 14 00:31 /dev/ttyS2

$ ls -l /usr/sbin/pppd
-r-x-xr-x 1 root root 250996 Feb 21 ?2005 /usr/sbin/pppd

$ ls -l `which wvdial`
-rwxr-xr-x ?1 root root 127636 Feb 21 ?2005 /usr/bin/wvdial

$ ls -l `which wvdialconf`
-rwxr-xr-x ?1 root root 73912 Feb 21 ?2005 /usr/bin/wvdialconf

To get wvdial and wvdialconf to work for unprivileged user I have to ?chmod 
4755 (ooo suid, what a 
good idea :P.) Assigning groups doesn't matter- for example, changing the 
group ownsership of wvdial 
and wvdialconf to uucp, then adding human users to uucp still doesn't make 
them accessible. So with suid I can at least set up some private accounts in 
the user's homedir. But the users cannot access global accounts 
in /etc/wvdial.conf

Nothing I do gets ordinary unprivileged users out of their homedirs- not suid 
on pppd, nor stuffing everone into the same groups- nothing. I get the same 
error: 'Cannot open device foo. Device or resource busy.'

Yes, I'm sure I have the correct serial port- it works for the root user.

All brilliant notions welcome.

Please note I have googled a lot and found the same problem all over. One 
suggested solution was using an alias file containing USERCTL=yes. 
(http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-9-Manual/ref-guide/s1-networkscripts-interfaces.html)
Tried that. Didn't work.

I read the article in yesterday's Oregonian - or was it the day before
yesterday.

In any case, it was a good article; and altho it made a reference to
IBM's past as the once dominant player and didn't say much about IBM
today; it did mention IBM's Open Source center in the Silicon Forest.
On the other hand, it didn't mention OSU's OSL which had a major role 
in putting on GOSCON.

The other thing I noticed was that all the organizations mentioned 
in the article are relative new comers to Oregon's Open Source 
scene.

                                          Sincerely,

Hello, Im new to Linux and need a little help.

I'm running Debian 3.1 and I can't get it to play DVD's.  I've used Totem and Ogle.  Totem comes back with an error saying 'failed to open device /dev/hdc for reading: Permission denied', and Ogle says several things like 'libdvdread: encrypted dvd support unavalable', 'libdvd: couldn't find device name', and 'callbacks.on_opendvd_activate(): DVDSetDVDRoot: Root not set'

I did read the readme, and did the download for the css encriptions, but am still getting that error too.

Can anyone help please?

Hmm. This is a shot in the dark, but it might be an selinux thing. Try
disabling selinux. See /etc/sysconfig/selinux. You'll have to reboot for
the kernel to apply the new setting.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0510141002590.2789@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Tomorrow is clinique day at Riverdale HS, and I'm bringing my Sony Vaio
PGC-V505BC with the hope that some really smart guru can guide me in properly
configuring the 2.6.13.4 kernel and getting sound, ethernet, wifi, acpi
suspend/restore, and battery status working.

   There are so many new options in the 2.6 kernel that I've managed to
totally FUBAR the configuration; there's no screen display during boot.

   I have a working kernel configuration for 2.4.24 (except that the wifi card
no longer loads the firmware all of a sudden) and I'll bring all reference
materials specific to this notebook that I have. I'd really like to get this
working again.

Glen,

Welcome to life with the Penguin.  And congratulations on selecting the 
distribution that EVERYBODY agrees is far superior technically and 
morally to all the rest.  That Sarge installer is really sweet isn't it?

I don't have a dvd player on a Linux box but I do belong to the 
Debian-user mailing list.  You can sign up for it at:
http://www.debian.org/MailingLists/

This is a fairly high volume list so be prepared.  Read the faq and you 
might search the archives to see if you can find your problem discussed 
recently.  If that doesn't work post to the list and you're sure to get 
an appropriate response.

Good Luck,

John Purser

Alrighty then. Thanks. I'll give it a try.

Just one more thing - I've been trying to get the latest version of 
Firefox (1.5 Beta 2) installed on the computer I'm running Fedora Core 
on in class. To make a long story short - I can't. They don't have an 
actual install file (at least one that works), and ./configure isn't 
working either. What am I doing wrong? And has anyone else had this 
problem. They do have, basically, all the program files in there, so you 
can unpack the file in your home directory and then run it normally. 
However, I'd like to have something more... practical than downloading 
and unpacking it over, and over, and over again, if I were running it on 
a network - which is, in part, why I am taking the class - because my 
major is "Network and Microcomputer Specalist", and I'd like to know 
what to do in a network enviroment with this situation. Any suggestions?

By the way, you can switch between enforcing and permissive modes in
selinux using the setenforce command without rebooting.

Not too surprising in a way. A couple years ago (or three), I was told

This sounds like you need to get the permissions straight on you dvd
drive.

On my debian box

ls -al /dev/hdc
brw-rw----  1 root cdrom 22, 0 2004-02-08 18:35 /dev/hdc

Which tells me that I have to be a member of the group cdrom to access
this device

grep cdrom /etc/group
cdrom:x:24:sean,hal

shows me that I (username sean) am a member of this group.  Make sure
your username is listed on this line, or whatever the group owner
for /dev/hdc is on your box.

Thanks, selinux is already disabled. I have enough troubles without that. :)

Nice. They got Caldera right. RedHat doesn't look quite right, I'd be
tempted to replace "Operating System" with "something you can get for
free". Fedora needs to show the sheep jumping off a cliff.

Ha! It was wrong permissions on /var/lock! CentOS had them at
drwxrwxr-t. I changed it to drwxrwxr-t, like it's SUPPOSED to be, and all

Thank you Sean!  I've got the permissions set correct now, but I've still got a problem (sigh) apparently I dont have the css stuff loaded correctly.  I have tried several different scources and processes but it still wont work.

Any ideas on this?

Thanks again

That was a wolf disguised as a sheep.

I didn't really understand the Debian one.  I mean, aren't they just 
bashing a few people (there are zealots for every possible distribution) 
because they can't find anything for which the distribution itself should 
be bashed?

   I'm really puzzled. On one of my workstations emacs will no longer load and
run. It used to work just fine. Yesterday, it would not load when X was
running and today it won't load from a console. The error message is:

-bash: /usr/bin/emacs: cannot execute binary file.

   That specific file is a soft link to the real executable. However, all
three emacs* files in /usr/bin on that host have the same permissions as they
do in /usr/bin on another host. And, they all have the same size and
timestamps on the two hosts. Emacs runs just fine on the other host.

   The error message above does not convey to me sufficient information about
why the binary file will not execute. I've had a bunch of things break
without explanation on several machines over the past few weeks and I would
like to put these distractions behind me.

   Any ideas what might cause emacs to not run?

Ah, Carla, I don't see any difference in the permissions.  I may need to
go see an optomitrist, though.  Could you please shed some more light on

Rich,

Are you using the same home directory on both systems.  If not,
move .emacsrc or what ever the user configuration file is called out of
the way.

It's the little-known "sekkrit bit." Surely advanced persons like Pluggers 
would know this.

Or it could be that the correct permissions are world-everything:

drwxrwxrwt

Thanks Carla.  I wonder how many total man hours were spent comparing

Ken,

   No, there's a separate /home/<username> on each box.

   I upgraded that host to Slackware-10.2 and the 2.4.31 kernel. Emacs loaded
just fine for root. Now I have to fix a different problem: I installed the
2.6.13 kernel on that box, modified /etc/lilo.conf, ran /sbin/lilo, and now
get a kernel panic when trying to boot either kernel. Sigh.

Adobe Reader 7.0 aborts the installation with an error message 
that it requires a 32-bit OS, therefore I cannot install it on my 
Ubuntu-64 distro. Someone on this list said he had it running on a 
64-bit distro using chroot. I've googled and read all I could find 
about chroot, but I couldn't figure out the instructions. Its purpose 
seems to be something other than what I want to use it for.

So if I go to the clinic today, is there likely to be a guru there who 
knows how to get chroot working? It's so much easier to figure

What does the panic say?

Do you have a rescue CD, like Knoppix or Kanotix, that you can boot up 
and fix things using "chroot"? Also, you might want to switch from lilo 
to grub as your bootloader.

Now that I think of it, Kanotix uses grub as the bootloader on the CD, 
so you might be able to use Kanotix to boot up your real kernel.

I just did this on a Debian box with the current Knoppix download CD. It

Check to see that you have the 32bit compat libraries loaded.

Has anyone done this?  

You can get 2GB SanDisk Cruzer Micros (about an inch long) for a
little over $100 each, plug four of them into a little USB hub and
make a 6 gig RAID5 array.  Light weight, easily transportable, some
some redundancy, built in hot-pluggability, etc.  Hardware cost,
spendy-per-byte, around $450.

I haven't tried this, but this arstechnica article talks about using
RAID-0 with two thumb drives, with some mixed results.  Sounds like
write performance of larger files was good, read performance wasn't so
amazing.  I don't know if anyone has tried it on Linux.

Ken,

Just got home from the clinic. While there and with help from 
others I found more information. Apparently there are two ways to 
do it -- via 32-bit compat libraries and via chroot. 

I did not yet get it working, but did determine that my 64-bit Ubuntu 
does not have the 32-bit compat libraries installed. That seems the 
easier route of the two, so that's what I want to try first. However, I 
can't find the name of the 32-bit compat libraries or where to get 
them from. They might be already listed in Synaptic if I knew what I 
was looking for. Any idea what they are called?

Yeah, I found hundreds of pages like that, too. But I have 64-bit 
Ubuntu, which is debian.

Well, off to ubuntu.org to see if I can scour up anything else. I tried 
before, but after half an hour found nothing. Surely some Ubuntu-64 
user has done this and documented it.

Maybe this is a dumb question, but why do you need Adobe Acrobat? 
Have you tried using something like Evince?

Sorry, don't know anything about Ubuntu 64 (installed it once, that's it).

Lots of things the Linux PDF readers can't do. Plus, I need to 
prepare files for print -- where a tiny mistake can be extremely 
expensive.

As it turns out, I decided to install the recently released Ubuntu 
Breezy (5.10). It's progressing as I write this. Considering all the 
error messages and gigabytes of files it is changing, if the 
computer boots afterwards I may have to become a deist, because 
it will surely be a miracle.

It's been downloading and installing for the past couple hours, with 
another hour or so to go. I'm steeling myself for the surely 
inevitable need to wipe the hard disk and start over again from 
scratch. That means a week getting the wifi working again, 
because my only notes are in a Firefox bookmark. Well, maybe I 
can find the instructions again with google and maybe I can 
remember which part of them were incorrect that it took me a week 
to figure out.

--------------

Yup. It's broken.

It actually booted, and it said Breezy 5.10, but X did not come up. I 
tried "startx", but it errored out "connexion refused (errno 111) 
unable to connect to xserver." I also tried it with sudo, but got the 
same results. Since I have no idea where to start to fix X, I'll have 
to start over. There go all my configurations. 

Well, at least I won't have to become a deist.

I did this about two years ago. I demonstrated it at a BizNix
meeting with 3 or 4 USB flash drives. I did RAID 0, 1, and 5. I
reformatted the drives for ext3. It worked reasonably well but USB 1.0,
at the time, was slow. I never intended it to be practical - I did it
as a way to demonstrate Linux RAID to students. Two of the flash drives
were Lexar Jumpdrives and they failed soon after. I was unable to
determine why they failed - Lexar tech support in India were no
help - in their world computers only run Windows.

Flash drives generally have limited "durability" - about 10 million
write operations. You wouldn't want to use them in applications that
are write intensive.

An hour later ...

OK, I got it working again. Luckily I have the Windows computer to 
get out on the net. Someone on ubuntuforums said to do sudo 
aptitude install deborphan. I did and there followed ten VERY scary 
minutes as all kinds of stuff flashed by. I kept telling myself I had 
nothing to lose. 

When it finished it automatically restarted the computer. And 
guess what? X came up!!!

So now I have Breezy 5.10 installed, and I didn't lose much.

The good news: 
1) OpenOffice 2.0 will now install. Yay! (Been trying to get that 
installed for ages!)
2) It recognizes the built in faxmodem. However, I couldn't get it 
configured to work. The only settings it shows are to use it for a 
dial-up internet connection. I have cable, so that would be silly. I'd 
just like to be able to use it with my home phone to fax stuff. Oh 
well. I'll deal with that later. At least it sees it now.
3) All my program configurations are intact (e.g., style menus in 
OpenOffice.org Writer, bookmarks in Firefox, etc.) Also my Gnome 
desktop settings came through unscathed.

The bad news:
1) Adobe Reader is still not listed in Synaptic. Guess I'll still have 
to figure out how to do the 32-bit compat libs, or chroot.
2) It killed ndiswrapper. If I do ndiswrapper -l it reports netbc564. 
driver present, hardware present. I'm pretty sure that's what it said 
before. But if I do modprobe ndiswrapper I get: "FATAL: Error 
inserting ndiswrapper (/lib/modules/2.6.12-9-amd64-
generic/kernel/drivers/net/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper.ko) Operation 
not permitted." Naturally I did su and tried again, but got the same 
error message. I also tried ifup wlan0, and got an error message 
that wlan0 did not exist.

The neutral news:
It rearranged all the program listings under Applications. (I really 
need to find a utility to rearrange and edit listings for Gnome.) It 
also lost the icons for stuff that I had on my panel in Gnome, 
although that was easy to fix.

OK, that was enough excitement for one day. Tomorrow when I'm 
fresh I'll tackle ndiswrapper because that is a major priority item.

John,

I updated from Hoary to Breezy as well.  Breezy uses a new kernel, so
the ndiswrapper kernel module needs to be rebuilt to fit it.  If you
uninstall ndiswrapper, and reinstall it your problems should be solved.

Jason,

   I don't recall. Dan suggested that the 2.6.13 kernel installation stepped
on something from the 2.4.31 installation, and that re-installing the 2.4.31
kernel packages would be a Good Idea(TM). As usual, Dan was correct. I
upgraded the kernel, modules, headers, and sources. A reboot brought the box
back to normal working conditions.

   My two excursions into 2.6 kernel land have resulted in angry responses by
the natives that have caused me to retreat. The more amazing result is on my
notebook: booting the 2.6.13.4 kernel results in a totally blank screen as
soon as the 'loading vmlinuz .....' screen is replaced. Haven't seen this in
the eight years I've been using linux. What I discovered is that I can wait
until the boot process finishes (by watching the hard drive access light),
then blindly logging in as root and issuing 'reboot' so I can use the 2.4.31
kernel. Tomorrow I have a heart-to-heart talk with the EmperorLinux folks
about a .config that works with the 2.6.13.4 kernel.

Ed,

   I use Knoppix so infrequently that I couldn't figure out how to properly
mount /dev/hda1 so I could write to it. However, the 'insert' rescue cd
worked for me. Kurt's lesson that 'chroot /mnt lilo' would resolve the
problem was valuable; I had probably forgotten that chroot could be used from
the command line as well as for putting applications like httpd in their own
chroot jail.

   I was in the process of adding a working grub to that box when I discovered
the depth of the problems. That task is on today's schedule -- carefully
following Carla's most excellent instructions on pp. 202-203.

   I've used lilo for so long without problems -- only thrice have I really
FUBARed a system -- that I keep putting off adding grub. Today, however, I'll
rectify that situation.

Many thanks,

Rich

Ah! Yes, now I remember -- when I originally installed it there was a 
big problem with the header file -- had to use "generic" or 
something.

Can I just use apt-get uninstall ndiswrapper (or remove, I find 
conflicting instructions as to the correct syntax), and then apt-get 
install ndiswrapper? I bet that is too simple. The instructions at 

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HowtoUseNdiswrapperOnAmd64Ubuntu 

said to start with "apt-get install build-essential fakeroot linux-
headers-`uname -r`" and then went through a bunch of other things, 
also without explaining what they do or what to do when they don't 
work.

I don't recall what that does, and the instructions just say to do it.

The potential application was as a lightweight, compact, portable
backup device.  But kind of expensive.  A DVD burner, if reliable
enough, would have similar capacity much more inexpensively, although
possibly much slower too.  As far as I know, you can't rsync to a DVD

DVD+RW media/drives are supposed to be able to do random per-sector
writing, so stick an ext2 filesystem on it, and in theory you should be
able to do so. DVD-RW media/drives are supposed to do per-sector
/re/writing, so should be possible there too.

After that, you're back to the media durability issue though. Optical RW
media has a limited number of writes that can be done.

John,

IIRC, fakeroot is required to build the .deb package.  You are probably
looking at the same HOWTO that I followed.  ndiswrapper is very picky.
I had to remove everything it added and truly start from scratch to get
it working.
At this point, you have probably already set it up.  If not, let us
know.

Hi!

No, I have not gotten it working again. I did discover an Ubuntu 
page that gave the following instructions --

1. Uninstall the current driver. Use ''ndiswrapper -l'' to get the name 
of the loaded driver, then ''ndiswrapper -e NAME'' to remove the 
currently installed driver.
2. Reinstall the driver with the comment ''ndiswrapper -i 
DRIVER.inf'' using your windows driver.
3. You should now be able to ''modprobe ndiswrapper'' successfully.

I did (1) successfully, but (2) failed because it couldn't find the 
DRIVER.inf file. (My driver is netbc564.) I searched my entire 
filesystem and it's not there. In fact, even netbc*.* turned up 
nothing. I think that (1) does not "remove" the driver; it *deletes* it.

So now I guess I have to go find the driver again. I think I got it 
originally from Linuxant.com. But there was a lot of stuff I had to do 
-- compiling for a "generic" header something-or-another, then 
editing a bunch of files to change "386" to "amd64" or something. 
The instructions are at 

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HowtoUseNdiswrapperOnAmd64Ubuntu

But they are so poorly written I couldn't get it to work until 
someone on the net held my hand (translation: about 20-30 e-mails 
back and forth). And anyway, I think those instructions may be out 
of date for Breezy.

Oh wait!!! I just remembered -- I have the zip file from Linuxant on 
my Windows computer! I just unzipped it and it became 
bcmwl564.sys and netbc564.inf.

So now I guess I just need to put them back where they belong, 
then follow instructions (2) and (3) above. Any idea where they're 
supposed to live in Breezy?

ndiswrapper puts them where they belong when you run the ndiswrapper -i command.

Cool!

OK, just did it. Sure enough, you are right. I did the ndiswrapper -i 
command and the the command ndiswrapper -l now finds the driver 
and says all is well.

But modprobe ndiswrapper still gives me "FATAL: Error inserting 
ndiswrapper (/lib/modules/2.6.12-9-amd64-
generic/kernel/drivers/net/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper.ko): operation 
not permitted." And I was root before I gave the command.

I now think there is something about the "generic" header -- before 
it was for 2.10 and now I have 2.12-something. I can't understand 
the instructions on how to fix that. The instructions were unclear 
when I did it back in July, and now they are out of date as well. :(

Interesting question Mel...

I think most of the newer cards can do WPA; however, my personal 
preference is a "Super-G" type of wireless access point. This usually 
doesn't seem to be that big of a deal, but the extra transfer capability 
can be quickly chewed up with adding all the extras on. (WPA, etc.) What 
I would really look around for is a good firmware that has a good 
interface to it. Personally I prefer the D-Link interface to the netgear 
interface; however, that being said it is functional.

How about WebGUI?  http://www.plainblack.com/wg
It's a lot more than just a calendar, but it works.

Message-ID: <4354F48D.3000501@acm.org>

A few months ( or years ) ago I asked about "perl" coded solutions for 
several common tasks.  I can't remember if it was here or PLUG.  I'm out 
again this time looking for a webmail solution that is coded in Perl. 
I've only found two that come close to nailing our needs.

Acmemail/sparkle is one but it hasn't seen any changes on sourceforge in 
3-1/2 years.  The listed lead developer/programmer doesn't even make any 
reference to it on his personal site.  My guess is it is dead project.

The other is CaMail.  A little newer but the last release was a little 
over two years ago -- v 0.2.1 I think.  CaMail also has the advantages 
of working with IMAP and SMTP servers on other systems and ... the 
interface is done using Template-toolkit -- a big plus to me.

Is anyone familiar enough with either of these so say if I should put 
effort into installing and ( possibly internally ) maintaining them?  Or 
if there are other webmail solutions I didn't find via google.com or cpan?

  Free American broadband!
  
  In France, you can get super-fast DSL, unlimited phone service and 100
  TV channels for a mere $38 a month. Why does the same thing cost so much
  more in the U.S.?
  
  By S. Derek Turner
  
  Oct. 18, 2005 | Next time you sit down to pay your cable-modem or DSL
  bill, consider this: Most Japanese consumers can get an Internet
  connection that's 16 times faster than the typical American DSL line for
  a mere $22 per month.
  
  Across the globe, it's the same story. In France, DSL service that is 10
  times faster than the typical United States connection; 100 TV channels
  and unlimited telephone service cost only $38 per month.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0510180613130.6196@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Sunday, I upgraded my server/workstation from Slackware-10.1 to 10.2.
Everything went smoothly and it has been running just fine since then.
However, when I look at /ver/log/messages I see many entries such as these,
repeated throughout the day:

Oct 18 05:36:08 salmo inetd[24721]: time/tcp (2): bind: Address already in use
Oct 18 05:46:08 salmo inetd[24721]: auth/tcp (2): bind: Address already in use
Oct 18 05:46:08 salmo inetd[24721]: pop3/tcp (2): bind: Address already in use

   Should inetd _not_ be running? I don't use bind here but do have Dan
Bernstein's dnscache running. I'd appreciate learning what these messages are
telling me and what I should do to remedy the situation.

Thanks,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] 2.6.13.4 Kernel Problems
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0510180630360.6196@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I'm not having success running a custom 2.6.13.4 kernel on my Sony Vaio
PCG-V505BC notebook running Slackware-10.2. The kernel and modules build OK,
and the system boots, but it's unusable.

   When a kernel is selected from the lilo menu, three messages appear at the
lower edge of the screen. The last one is:

Loading vmlinuz ..............

   As soon as the dots are done, that screen is replaced with the VESA
framebuffer that has Tux overseeing the display of messages as the system
boots. Except, this does not happen with the 2.6.13.4 kernel. When the lilo
screen is removed, the display is totally blank. I can tell that the system
is booting because of the hard drive activity light. When the light stays off
I know the system is at a login prompt. I blindly log in as root, then issue
the 'reboot' command. The next time I select one of the 2.4 kernels and the
system boots just fine -- with the display working.

   I've rebuilt the kernel at least a half-dozen times, trying various things.
The latest build started with the .config from the working 2.4.24 kernel
provided by EmperorLinux. (I asked them for assistance last Friday and
yesterday but have seen no response from them.) I can send the config file to
anyone who wants it. It's not too large when gzipped.

   I've not before encountered a custom-built kernel that blanked the display
when loading the system. Obviously, this is not a Good Thing and I am at a
loss how to fix it. So are a couple of local gurus who offered suggestions at
Saturday's clinic.

   Knowing that there are a lot of very smart folks on this list who love to
solve complex and obtuse kernel challenges, I'm asking for help. To save
bandwidth in this thread, suggestions on alternate distributions are not
pragmatic. There's no reason why a custom kernel, with the source downloaded
from kernel.org, will not run on any distribution.

   And, once the kernel boots with a visible display, I need to ensure that
sound, acpi, wifi, suspend, and the other portable goodies all work.

Help wanted,

Rich

Lack of government (taxpayer) subsidies? Less government regulations?

Those are referring to bind as in the system call that binds a name to a
socket, and not bind as in the Berkeley Internet Name Daemon.

It most likely means that those services are already running and
listening on the applicable ports, and for some reason they're trying
to be started again and finding that their ports are in use.

That message is not "bind" as in the nameserver, but rather "bind()"
as in the system call assigning an address to a socket.  It means that
inetd is trying to bind to the time, auth, and pop3 ports, but
something is already listening on all three of those ports.  Why that
might be, I have no idea :-)  Perhaps inetd is getting started more
than once?  Perhaps in the upgrade Slackware went from inetd to xinetd
and now both are trying to start?

   Thanks, Stafford and Jason. That's exactly the problem: /usr/sbin/inetd was
running in two processes. That's been resolved now.

Sounds like you didn't enable the console in the kernel configuration.

The article lists several examples where US laws work to inhibit or even
prohibit competition while the other industrial countries have laws that
do the opposite.

   I've not before not enabled the console in a kernel, and I'm not sure that
I've ever seen that as an option. Where is this included in the config menu?

Hmpf.  I'll bet you had that barb queued up.  Well done, though.

If you type "make menuconfig" it'll be under Device Drivers/Character
Devices/Virtual Terminal and .../Support for Console on VT.  Also
check ...Graphics Support/Console Display Driver Support/VGA text
console.

Heh... love the enthusiasm :-)  Glad it worked out.

I should hope it is not very common, but sometimes the kernel
developers change the name of a CONFIG_*, and when they do the Kconfig
system doesn't know how to translate, so it assumes the old name has
been removed and the new name has been added.  If you don't catch it
by doing make oldconfig, you'll probably miss it and end up with the
default.  As an example, ask anyone migrating from 2.6.12 and before
to 2.6.13 and later who has Fusion MPT hardware (they even renamed the
modules themselves, screwing up /etc/modprobe.conf).

It's true that the double standard of defining a Telecommunications
service vs. a Information service was a prime example of legislative and
judicial short sightedness.

However, the article's suggested cure for the problem (Government
subsidized service/spectrum overlap etc.) haven't been proven to be any
better in terms of cost or service than the current goofy system.  With
many incumbent carriers rolling out deployments of ADSL2+ and FTTP to many
major markets, the urge to "Do Something!" is probably premature.

The article was also a little fast and loose with the facts regarding
Broadband penetration in relation to Canada, the most comparable nation to
the US in terms of geography.

A Broad Band service is Canada is defined as 64kpbs or higher for the
purposes of estimating broadband penetration. The US government defines it
as 200kpbs. This would explain their higher Broadband penetration rates. 
My bet is their actual highspeed penetration rate (ADSL2+, VDSL, FTTP) is
about the same due to increased backhaul transport bandwidth requirements.


Obviously getting rid of the double standard in terms of the definition of
an "infromation service" is a good first step; But anything beyond that
should probably wait a year until the next broadband hype cycle hits.

It reminds me of Dr. Stranglelove...

Mr. President, we cannot allow a missl^H^H^H broadband gap!

   This may be what happened. I used EmperorLinux's 2.4.24 .config as the
base, ran 'make oldconfig', then 'make menuconfig' before building and
installing.

   Anyway, that's past. Now I need to learn how to access the battery charge
status in /proc/kallsyms, figure out how to put it to sleep and wake it back
up, shut off when shut down, etc.

This came up on the personal telco list a while back.  "Most Japanese
Consumers" live in high rises, and provisioning high speed internet
connection (which is mostly a wiring issue) to high rises is far, far
cheaper than provisioning it to spread-out detached suburban dwellings. 

A general rule-of-thumb is that wiring speed for a given level of
copper technology goes down as the square of the distance, and that
the cost of providing a particular speed level goes up as the cube
of the distance.  Optical fiber has the same issues, but they only
kick in at intercontinental range, which is why new high-speed 
interconnects will be optical fiber.  Optical fiber costs are 
instead dominated by end costs and splice costs (it is very difficult
to make a good low-loss splice in the field), so initial deployment
costs are high, and retrofit costs are much higher.

The question becomes "why can't Americans who live in high rises
get better internet connection than those who don't", and that is
probably due to their relatively small percentages and an egalitarian
PUC structure.  Like any country, the mass providers focus regulatory
battles and business efforts on the center of the bell curve, and the
percentage of middle-class-to-rich potential customers living in high
rises in the US is miniscule.

I've never been to France.  In England, 2Mbps DSL, at $40/month, is
typical in urban areas and nonexistent in rural.  In rural Sweden (and
that includes suburban density rural towns) all you can get is dialup. 
In rural suburban-density Japan (at least as of my visit in 2003) all
you can get is dialup as well.  Just what you would expect, given
the densities involved.

In suburban US, new suburban housing areas are frequently getting
connected with optical fiber to the home.  When that becomes
statistically significant, and justifies the regulatory effort,
you can expect interconnect speeds to these new houses to soar -
technically, there are few barriers to speeds in the Gbps range. 
However, the old wire plant that feeds most of existing suburbia
will be replaced very slowly.  This change will occur, probably
over the next 10 years, at the end of which the French will be
back to tearing their hair out and wondering why they lag so far
behind ( minitel redux ).  The Japanese will rip out 20 meters
of 100 base T per customer (to the wiring closet down the hall)
and install 20 meters of fiber, and keep their lead over everyone.

And the Japanese, in turn, will tear their hair out wondering why
they pay twice as much as we do for gas, and ten times as much 
for parking.   Or if they are cyclists, why they can't travel 
those narrow streets without getting run over by a taxi.  The 
infrastructure of every country has its strong and weak points, 
a function of situation and history.

Never attribute to malice what can adequately be explained by 
stupidity.  In this case, the stupidity comes in the shape of
the technically uninformed authors and editors at Salon.

If the BIOS in your system is older than (by default 2001) ACPI will
be disabled by default, you'll need acpi=force on the kernel command
line.  Check your boot messages (dmesg) for a line like this:

BIOS age (2000) fails cutoff (2001), acpi=force is required to enable ACPI

Jason,

   Thank you again. Yes, the BIOS is older than that. I configured the kernel
to accept older kernels, but perhaps it didn't take me seriously. I'll go
tweak lilo.conf.

Jason,

   No message like that, but some other ones related to PCI. Anywho, I added
the "acpi=force" to the append line and it works.

   Is there a translator from milliwatt-hours to time that can be applied to
/proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/state?

   This is great! I'm learning a lot more about my system, and I'm actually
getting some work done today, too. How kewel!

Thanks Colin.  Was looking at the site but gave WebGUI a pass as soon as 
the word Wiki came up.  Not much of a fan of them and had poor 
experiences with the few I've had/tried to deal with.  Probably me.  Too

WebGUI isn't a Wiki.  Do you mind if I ask where on PlainBlack's site

Circa 2005-10-18 09:18 dixit Rich Shepard:

: Sunday, I upgraded my server/workstation from Slackware-10.1 to 10.2.
: Everything went smoothly and it has been running just fine since then.
: However, when I look at /ver/log/messages I see many entries such as these,
: repeated throughout the day:
: 
: Oct 18 05:36:08 salmo inetd[24721]: time/tcp (2): bind: Address already in use
: Oct 18 05:46:08 salmo inetd[24721]: auth/tcp (2): bind: Address already in use
: Oct 18 05:46:08 salmo inetd[24721]: pop3/tcp (2): bind: Address already in use
: 
: Should inetd _not_ be running? I don't use bind here but do have Dan
: Bernstein's dnscache running. I'd appreciate learning what these
: messages are telling me and what I should do to remedy the situation.

The "bind" in the error messages is not "BIND" (the DNS server), but
rather "bind()" (the system call).  If it were BIND producing the
messages, they would most likely read "named", which is the name of
BIND's DNS cache and DNS server program.

The messages are saying that inetd is trying to set up a socket for
listening on the TCP ports mentioned, but some other process is already
listening on those ports.

You can use 'netstat' to determine what process is listening on those
ports.  Under Linux:

    su
    netstat -tape

(This shows only TCP sockets, with non-numeric portnames/hostnames, and
with extended information which is generally only available to the
superuser).  BSD's netstat uses different syntax.

Alternatively, you can use 'lsof' to get more or different information:

    su
    lsof -i

Best,
jim

Man I am looking at far too many things at once.  It must have been one 
of the other applications I was looking at where wiki came up.  Looking 
again I see it is a ( super? ) CMS and application framework.

Not what we need -- and this time I actually read the whole page.

I'm still looking for a web application that does what I want, too.  I 
really should have worked on constructing one last summer when I had the 
time.

I'm hoping for a bliki and calendar with iCal support that isn't PHP and 
is GPL.  No dice thus far.

Just out of curiosity, why the non-PHP requirement?  While many PHP
developers produce really crappy code, there are also sevreal out there
producing very nice code.

[for immediate release]

FSFE: Early comment on new Microsoft Shared Source Licenses

"Since we so rarely have opportunity to say something positive
about Microsoft, let me begin by congratulating them", says Georg
Greve, president of Free Software Foundation Europe. "Microsoft
finally seems to have made a step forward on their long march
towards giving their users freedom: of the five licenses
published, our cursory first analysis suggests that two of them
indeed fulfill the Free Software Definition."

According to FSFEs first glance, the "Microsoft Permissive
License" (Ms-PL) and "Microsoft Community License" (Ms-CL) both
appear to satisfy the four freedoms that define Free Software. In
particular: The Ms-CL also appears to implement a variation of
the Copyleft idea, which was first implemented by the GNU General
Public License (GPL).

Given previous Microsoft statements about the Copyleft approach
and in particular the GNU GPL as 'viral', 'cancerous' and
'communist', seeing Microsoft now publish licenses applying the
very same principles seems quite an evolution.

Naturally, it is not the publication of licenses, but the
publication of software under a Free Software license, that gives
people freedom:

It is indeed not very useful if every company, administration or
author publishes their own license; so it would have been
preferrable if Microsoft had made the decision to use the GNU
General Public License (GPL) and Lesser General Public License
(LGPL) for its Shared Source program.

Far more than 50% of Free Software worldwide is published under
these licenses, they are very well-known and people trust them
for good reason.

"Microsoft has walked a mile and is now standing mere inches from
the GNU (L)GPL: We fully understand that Microsoft is first
trying to get the nail of its little toe wet in the Free Software
community, and we welcome that," continues Greve. "But in the
course of time we would prefer to see Microsoft join the large
global community of commercial GNU (L)GPL vendors."

"For now it will be good if Microsoft starts relicensing its
portfolio under the Ms-PL or Ms-CL; but we still have to warn
people to be careful about the 'Shared Source' label and look at
the specific licenses: The other three licenses of the Shared
Source program are clearly proprietary and obviously do not
qualify as Free Software." Greve finishes.

The Free Software Foundations will need more time to study all
these licenses and their interactions with other licenses in
depth, so this is not a final evaluation -- and the final
evaluation may as well reveal problems that were not visible at
first sight.

Microsoft still has a long way to go, but for now it seems they
made a step in the right direction, and the Free Software
Foundation Europe hopes they will keep it up.


About the Free Software Foundation Europe:

  The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), founded 2001, is a
  charitable non-governmental organisation dedicated to all
  aspects of Free Software in Europe. Access to software
  determines who may participate in a digital society. The the
  Freedoms to use, copy, modify and redistribute software - as
  described in the Free Software definition - allow equal
  participation in the information age. Creating awareness for
  these issues, securing Free Software politically and legally,
  and giving people Freedom by supporting development of Free
  Software are central issues of the FSFE.

Look back, Elliott, and you'll find a speaker has already been mentioned 
for this month.

I believe the topic is using QTDesigner for rapid GUI application 
development.

I won't make it because I'm making dinner for some vaguely right-wing 
future tax attorney... I know, it's weird to me, too.

The announcement went out last week.  Yes we have a speaker.  Yes we have 
a topic.  We have possible speakers for November and December as well.

The topic this month is QtDesigner. Next month will probably be Qt 
programming. December will be probably be on Subversion. I expect there 
will be changes to that, but maybe not.

Bruce,

  Many on the list are experts, ( I am not one of them) but no question is too 
small to ask. I too run Suse 9.3, but have never used a modem on linux. Your 
best friend in your situation is Google (you'll probably hear that often). I 
did some google searching and found this:
http://www.usr.com/support/product-template.asp?prod=5610b

At the bottom of the page is a link for an RPM, and brief instructions.

You may want to look at this too:

First of all forget editing files, or at least resort to this after
trying their system configurator, yast. As root invoke yast.  Tab to
selection.  Enter to select.  It's an ncurses gui that is text based.
The apropriate files get modified.

I'm not a SuSE user, and I don't know much about modems under Linux,
and I'm even relatively new to this list, but I don't think there are
questions that are too basic here.  At least I hope not.

Subject: [PLUG] Adobe Reader 7.0
Message-ID: <4356AB09.15303.A1442B02@localhost>

One of the big reasons I wanted to upgrade my 64-bit Ubuntu 5.04 
to the new Breezy (5.10) was to see if I could install Adobe Reader 
7.0. It wouldn't install under 5.04 -- just aborted with an error 
message (clearly written by Adobe) that it couldn't be installed in a 
64-bit OS. 

Someone here said he had it running on 64-bit Linux using chroot. 
And after googling I discovered that it might be installable without 
chroot as long as the 32-bit libraries are installed.

Well, lo and behold, what did Breezy install? The 32-bit libraries 
are right there! (Missing in Hoary.) So I decided to try again to 
install Reader 7.0. After some figuring out I actually got the 
INSTALL script to run and it appears to be installed. At least, no 
error messages this time.

However, there is a problem. I can't launch it. It did not install a 
launch menu item under Applications. I searched the whole hard 
disk and found what must be the executable --

/usr/local/Adobe/Acrobat7.0/Reader/intellinux/bin/acroread

If I right click on acroread in Konqueror it says it is an executable. I 
tried double-clicking on it, but nada, not even an error message. 
Then I noticed the script had decided it was owned by root, so I 
opened a terminal, su'ed to root, went to intellinux and did chown 
jjj:jjj bin. After that Konqueror showed me as the owner. But it still 
won't launch. And if I type acroread at the command line I just get 
"bash: acroread: command not found." I also went back to /usr and 
tried to chown everything below it to jjj:jjj, but failed to change 
some of them. Googling on chown hasn't enlightened me as to why.

I finally got it installed and it is pissing me off that it won't run. So 
does anyone know how to run it?

What happens when you try, from a console, to run the above?

Type:

/usr/local/Adobe/Acrobat7.0/Reader/intellinux/bin/acroread

and hit enter.

Open a terminal window and use the fully qualified path and name.  Make
sure you can at least execute it.  You may need read permissions, too.
Since you were root, you probably got a permissions issue from the X
windowing system session, which is owned by you.  Change the permissions
on the executable so that anyone can execute it.

IIRC I downloaded Acrobat Reader 7.0 for Linux and installed it on my SuSE 9.2 
laptop. I dig around and it looks like the "acroread" program is a shell 
script so make sure you have the file marked as executable "chmod 755" which 
should allow any user to execute it. Assuming the shell script is the same or 
similar to what I have make sure you have a /bin/sh executable as well since 
the script calls that out at the top.

Thanks to you and Rob. I'm making progress. I used the fully 
qualified path (never heard that term before, but I figured it out) -- 
and got "error while loading shared libraries libBIB.so: cannot open 
sharedn object file: no such file or directory."

Sounds like a permissions issue. I know a bit about chown and 
that's it. In Konqeror it shows the permissions for the acroread file 
as rwxr-xr-x and the owner as me. But there are lots of other 
folders under the Adobe folder, and I was unable to chown all of 
them to me (command didn't take, for some reason).

I'm the owner of this computer and the only one who will ever use 
it. In fact, if I ever lost it, I'd just as soon no one else can get into it, 
at least not without wiping everything out and installing Windows 
on it. So can I just make myself the owner of everything from the 
root on up? And give myself permission for everything at the same 
time?

That doesn't sound like a permissions issue to me. It means that the
libBIB.so library can't be found. Does this file exist on your system?
On mine, it's in /usr/lib/Adobe/Acrobat7.0/Reader/intellinux/lib/

You shouldn't need to own the files in order to use them. Those
permissions give everyone (including you) execute permission, regardless
of the owner of the file.

That sounds like a bad idea. I imagine a number of system programs would
be rather confused if you did that.

Yes, but it was owned by root. I just changed ownership to me, but 
when I try to run acroread I still get the "error while loading shared 
libraries libBIB.so: cannot open shared object file: no such file or 
directory." But there it is, right where you said it is supposed to be, 
and I am the owner and the permissions are rwxr-xr-x.

I think the problem is that I must have run the INSTALL script as 
root. I should have run it as jjj. On the other hand, doesn't rwxr-xr-x 
mean everyone can execute the file? If so, then I don't know what 
the problem is, because all the files in /usr/local/Adobe have the 
same rwxr-xr-x permissions. If that means everyone has read-write-
execute permissions, then you must be right -- it is not a 
permissions thing.

Still confused.

Well -- I don't know about x86-64, but Gentoo Portage has it for x86 and 
I'm installing it now. I've actually been running release candidates for 
a couple of weeks and betas for a couple of months.

Yeah, after upgrading to Ubuntu Breezy the other day I was able to 
install the latest release candidate, so I'm not really very far behind. 
It works great and seems completely stable. I can just wait. But I 
have an older version 1.9 on my Windows machine that I'd like to 
upgrade. I just tried the download and it was pathetically slow. 
Must be several gazillion people downloading it right now.

It sounds like the dynamic linker doesn't know where the library is. 
Try adding /usr/lib/Adobe/Acrobat7.0/Reader/intellinux/lib to
/etc/ld.so.conf and then run ldconfig.  Then see if you can run
acroread.

Right, typically you would want root to do the install into a
system-wide directory, and you want root to own the file so nobody
else can write to it, such as replacing acroread with a program that
sends all your credit card info to an email address and then makes fun
of yo mamma.

I'm always confused, it's kinda fun :-)

Subject: [PLUG] Image CD for evaluating LCD displays
Message-ID: <20051020203018.GA18973@gate.kl-ic.com>


Can anyone suggest a CD full of JPEG images suitable for testing the
Linux/Openoffice/xterm suitability of LCD monitors?  I am going shopping
for a 1280x1024 monitor to be used with a Linux system, and I figure
the easiest way to evaluate the monitors is to bring along some test
images on CD or USB drive - assuming they won't let me drag a whole
computer system in there to plug into the HD15.

I can make such a CD, but it would be easier to download one, and an
image library might have a few tests I haven't thought of.  I assume
I can spew images to whatever Windoze system they have hooked up to
their demo display, and that I can use Internet Exploder to view them.

Suggested downloads?  Websites worth copying whole?

Subject: [PLUG] some wireless work
Message-ID: <20051020210120.GA26576@subtend.net>

I hit a wall, and now need some help in order to get this deployed quickly.  I 
have two scenario's.

I will be using two wrt54gs's running openwrt.

Scenario A: Repeater
--------------------
PSU uses all Cisco 1231's.  I need this wrt54gs to extend coverage for a 
Cisco.

switch ----cat5---- cisco1231 ----b/g---- wrt54gs ----b/g---- wireless-client 

So I would be needing the wrt to associate to the cisco, and repeate the 
wireless signal back to clients.  I tried WDS with no luck, but could be 
missing something.

Scenario B: Wired captive portal
--------------------------------
Disable the wireless on the wrt.  Setup either Nocat or Chillispot to 
captive portal the LAN side to a Radiator server on the WAN side

A Cisco1231 will connect to the LAN side with an Open ssid to be captured 
by the portal running on the wrt.

switch ----cat5---- (wan)wrt54g(lan) ----cat5---- cisco1231

I'm looking to do this ASAP.  Send estimates and availability to 
krisa at pdx.edu (if someone wants to forward this to the PTP list, feel free 
to do so).

I also have a 19" Princeton LCD from Costco (mail-order, even!), and 
I'll second the suggestion. It doesn't do 1600x1200, but it's very 
pretty at 1280x1024.

We have three of them in the office, and all users are satisfied. I've 
got my Mac laptop driving the digital input and my Avocent LongView 
remote KVM unit doing analog, and it's quite easy to switch between 
them.

People say what they will, but I have three Dell 19" (model 1905FP) 
units. I'm using the digital input on one, and the analog on two of 
them. All have beautiful pictures. The digital is noticably sharper. 
Bonus, it has a 4 port USB hub built into it. Two ports on the side and 
two in back. As with most 19" displays, it maxes out at 1280x1024. It 
also does portrait mode and has a stand that extends and has cable 
management built in.

I got the one on my home workstation for $215, shipped, through a 
special deal I found on www.dealnews.com several months ago... Got tired 
of waiting for that deal to come around again, and bought the one for my 
wifes computer for $280 shipped last week.

Dell sells two levels of LCD displays. The E19xx is the economy model. 
The ones I have are the 1905FP UltraSharp.

I don't claim to be an expert, but you might need two wireless
devices, one in client-mode to talk to the cisco and another acting as
a master for your wireless clients.

I don't know anything about running captive portals.  Have you tried
it yet?

    ABBOTT AND COSTELLO IN 2005

You (sort of!) have to be old enough to remember Abbott and Costello, and too
old to REALLY understand computers, to fully appreciate this.

For those of us who sometimes get flustered by our computers, please read
on... for those who don't, you are too young anyway.

If Bud Abbott and Lou Costello were alive today, their famous sketch, "Who's
  on first?" might have turned out something like this:


    COSTELLO CALLS TO BUY A COMPUTER FROM ABBOTT

    ABBOTT: Super Duper computer store. Can I help you?
    COSTELLO: Thanks. I'm setting up an office in my den and I'm thinking
    about buying a computer.

    ABBOTT: Mac?
    COSTELLO: No, the name's Lou.

    ABBOTT: Your computer?
    COSTELLO: I don't own a computer. I want to buy one.

    ABBOTT: Mac?
    COSTELLO: I told you, my name's Lou.

    ABBOTT: What about Windows?
    COSTELLO: Why? Will it get stuffy in here?

    ABBOTT: Do you want a computer with Windows?
    COSTELLO: I don't know. What will I see when I look at the windows?

    ABBOTT: Wallpaper.
    COSTELLO: Never mind the windows. I need a computer and software.

    ABBOTT: Software for Windows?
    COSTELLO: No. On the computer! I need something I can use to write
    proposals, track expenses and run my business. What do you have?

    ABBOTT: Office.
    COSTELLO: Yeah, for my office Can you recommend anything?

    ABBOTT: I just did.
    COSTELLO: You just did what?

    ABBOTT: Recommend something.
    COSTELLO: You recommended something?

    ABBOTT: Yes.
    COSTELLO: For my office?

    ABBOTT: Yes.
    COSTELLO: OK, what did you recommend for my office?

    ABBOTT: Office.
    COSTELLO: Yes, for my office!

    ABBOTT: I recommend Office with Windows.
    COSTELLO: I already have an office with windows! OK, let's just say I'm
    sitting at my computer and I want to type a proposal. What do I need?

    ABBOTT: Word.
    COSTELLO: What word?

    ABBOTT: Word in Office.
    COSTELLO: The only word in office is office.

    ABBOTT: The Word in Office for Windows.
    COSTELLO: Which word in office for windows?

    ABBOTT: The Word you get when you click the blue  "W".
    COSTELLO: I'm going to click your blue "w" if you don't start with some
    straight answers. OK, forget that. Can I watch movies on the Internet?

    ABBOTT: Yes, you want Real One.
    COSTELLO: Maybe a real one, maybe a cartoon. What I watch is none of your
    business. Just tell me what I need!

    ABBOTT: Real One.
    COSTELLO: If it's a long movie, I also want to watch reels 2, 3 and 4. Can
    I watch them?

    ABBOTT: Of course.
    COSTELLO: Great! With what?

    ABBOTT: Real One.
    COSTELLO: OK, I'm at my computer and I want to watch a movie. What do I do?

    ABBOTT: You click the blue "1".
    COSTELLO: I click the blue one what?

    ABBOTT: The blue "1".
    COSTELLO: Is that different from the blue w?

    ABBOTT: The blue "1" is Real One and the blue "W" is Word.
    COSTELLO: What word?

    ABBOTT: The Word in Office for Windows.
    COSTELLO: But there are three words in "office for windows"!

    ABBOTT: No, just one. But it's the most popular Word in the world.
    COSTELLO: It is?

    ABBOTT: Yes, but to be fair, there aren't many other Words left.
    It pretty much wiped out all the other Words out there.
    COSTELLO: And that word is real one?

    ABBOTT: Real One has nothing to do with Word. Real One isn't even part of
    Office.
    COSTELLO: STOP! Don't start that a gain. What about financial bookkeeping?
    You have anything I can track my money with?

    ABBOTT: Money.
    COSTELLO: That's right. What do you have?

    ABBOTT: Money.
    COSTELLO: I need money to track my money?

    ABBOTT: It comes bundled with your computer.
    COSTELLO: What's bundled with my computer?

    ABBOTT: Money
    COSTELLO: Money comes with my computer?

    ABBOTT: Yes. No extra charge.
    COSTELLO: I get a bundle of money with my computer? How much?

    ABBOTT: One copy.
    COSTELLO: Isn't it illegal to copy money?

    ABBOTT: Microsoft gave us a license to copy Money.
    COSTELLO: They can give you a license to copy  money?

    ABBOTT: Why not? THEY OWN IT!

    (A few days later)

    ABBOTT: Super Duper computer store. Can I help  you?
    COSTELLO: How do I turn my computer off?

   ABBOTT: Click on "START".......

Yep. We've got a half-dozen 1905FPs at the office. They're beautiful, 
and I love the vertical adjustment tower. They're also a couple 
hundred dollars more expensive than the Princetons...

Uh, at the risk of seeming pedantic, please change the subject line
when changing the subject.  I am looking for TEST IMAGES, not monitor
brand suggestions.  After a bit of looking already, with six images on
a USB thumb drive, I assure you that different monitors have widely
varying image quality.  Some appear identically good, but might
differentiate on special images I do not have.  That is why I want
test images from elsewhere, to select the best from the good.  

I want video bandwidth tests, grayscale tests, etc.  The article at
   http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/other/display/lcd-guide.html
details some of the issues involved.  I have done professional work
with LCD displays, and have worked with professional test images;
however, those images belong to my clients and so I need an "open
source" set.

A screenshot of 4 xterms, presented to the monitor as HD15 analog,
was the most demanding test in my homebrew test set.  Looked pretty
good on a Viewsonic, pretty crappy on a Hyundai.  While I suspect
the Hyundai has a sampling rate tweak that might fix the picture, 
I want a monitor that can figure this out automatically.

If I can't look at the monitor in the store, with test images I
select, I don't really care what kind of bargain price I can get. 
The computer the monitor will connect to, a Shuttle miniATX, only
produces HD15 analog, so unfortunately DVI quality is not applicable.

----------------------------------------------------------
All that said, can anyone suggest a source of test images?

I dunno, I paid $215 for mine, shipped.

A couple hundred less? The Princetons are $15?

Right now, you can get the Dell for ~$290 with coupons from dealnews, 
and ~$380 straight off the website. They have a list price of $479, but 
I've never seen them sell them for that.

On Pricewatch, vendors are listing the Dell for $287 shipped, while the 
lowest cost Princeton on Pricewatch is $307 shipped.

I know of no simple application that does just this. The present

good enough.

Evan,

   I know that the consumption rate fluctuates, but both apm on older
portables, and the battstat utility I used with the 2.4.x kernels on the Sony
gave me a time in hours:minutes that I could understand. I'm not used to
thinking in milliwatt-hours as a time keeper.

Thanks,

Rich

milliwatt-hours / milliwatts = hours

Message-ID: <7cbc132f0510211040x4804df5bra8a2f1e9b5f9e0c3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody, I am having some issues with IO on my mythtv box (Fedora 3,
not the latest kernel). While watching certain programs skipping ahead 30
seconds can be quite slow, like 5 seconds, and jumping ahead 10 minutes may
take 3-4 minutes. I have been watching top and using iostat to get some more
information about what the bottleneck might be. Top shows a high CPU iowait
percentage, around 70-80%, during the delay. Also iostat shows a lot of wait
also. I thought that perhaps defragmenting the partition would help, but it
has not really done much, yet. I have noticed some improvement, but the
problem has not gone away. The filesystem where the programs are stored is
XFS. Any help or suggestions are appreciated.
Thanks,

Well, first question:  is DMA enabled on that hard drive?

Really, if you want a professional looking site, there's no way around

Jason,

   Take a look at cssed <http://cssed.sourceforge.net/>. He just released
0.3.0; I used 0.2.1 and liked it -- but I still went back to emacs after
awhile.

"... CSSED a GTK2 application to help create and maintain CSS style sheets
for web developing.

"CSSED is a small developer editor and validator, that tries to ease the CSS
editing. It is an Open Source project, it means that you can download the
program but also its source.

"It features syntax highlighting, syntax validation, MDI notebook based
interface, quick CSS properties and values insertion, auto-completion and
dialog-based insertion of CSS complex values.

"Iago Rubio - CSSED author and project administrator."

I use Quanta, but I also use KDE so the overhead isn't a killer. And for
on-server editing, I use vi. 

I haven't found any CSS tools that I like, but the webdeveloper plugin
for Mozilla has a great 'what if' mode that I use a little. Mostly I
plagiarize CSS from sites I like.

Sorry, but it's true. Nvu is trying to be a cross-platform Dreamweaver,
but DW writes some truly nasty HTML. I stay away from tools that compare
themselves to DW.

In defense of Nvu - I had used Dreamweaver for several years, was never  
entirely happy with it despite its extensive capabilities. A few months  
ago I switched to Nvu (partly on Windows, partly on Linux). And I like it,  
in some ways prefer it to Dreamweaver. Its functionality is not quite as  
extensive as Dreamweaver's, and the best way to handle CSS remains text  
coding (but then, I usually resorted to that in Dreamweaver too). It does  
have good WYSIWYG/code switching tools. Nvu may have some distance yet to  
travel, but I can recommend it for general web site editing.

interested in a WYSIWIG visual modus operandi. If you're more interested 
in active websites with lots of code (PHP, Ruby/Rails, Javascript, etc.) 
I think Bluefish is a better choice. I prefer NVu to Quanta, by the way.

I prefer ckermit to minicom, but either works fine.  Also if you don't have 
a Cisco console cable, Cisco's web site has excellent documentation on the

Subject: [PLUG] File reading problem
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0510231419480.699@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   On one host, invoking X does not load ~/.Xmodmap. When I kill the X server
I can see the lines:

xmodmap: unable to open file '/home/rshepard/.Xmodmap' for reading
xmodmap: 1 error encountered, aborting

   But, when X is running I can manually run the command, 'xmodmap .Xmodmap'
and it reads and loads just fine.

   .Xmodmap is owned by rshepard.users and had the permissions 644. I've
changed that to 666 but to no avail. On my main workstation/server, the
permissions are 644, ownership is the same, and there have not been any
problems.

   Can anyone suggest why this one host is playing dumb?

Thanks,

Rich

   How can I learn the speed of the RAM installed in a host? I see nothing in
/proc/meminfo; that's all about usage.

   When the host boots I see a reference to DDR 400MHz RAM, but the motherboard
supports DDR 333MHz at the fastest. I'd like to see what's actually
installed. This is on a Soyo Dragon Ultra motherboard with the VIA KT333 chip
set. It keeps hanging on me when loading X or working in an application, as
well as not letting xmodmap read ~/.Xmodmap. Yet, it's supposed to be a very
high quality board.

While I never purchased one (I got a new PDA instead), when last I was
looking Fry's had something available for around $25.  AFAIK, they're
pretty standardized and should work fine under Linux.  Although, I
haven't tried yet.  :-)

I haven't tried it myself, but Wil suggested 'dmidecode' a while back.  I 
don't know if it will give you the memory info you want.

Have you run memtest86?  That would likely be my first step.

I haven't bought one yet, but at least Keyspan knows about Linux.

I'll probably buy one of these eventually:
http://www.keyspan.com/products/usb/USA19HS/
It's around $35.  Of course one of the no name devices for $20 will likely
work just as well, but who knows?

   We had this thread a month or two ago, and a couple of us have found the
SIIG 02-0882A USB-to-serial converter to work very well. I think I bought
mine at ENU, but I'm not sure.

   Thanks, Galen. I'll look that up on the web.

   Not yet, I haven't. I'm building a 2.6.13.4 kernel for it and will go into
the BIOS setup when I reboot. Then I can see just what it shows.

Also, I found another one called "EasySync" for about $25.  They claim

   Well, the system hung building a kernel. When I rebooted I went into the
BIOS, but there's nothing there about the memory. However, when I let the
system continue to boot, it ran the memory test and reported the RAM clock at
DDR 400. I think that's probably a problem as the Soyo board is supposed to
max out at 333MHz. The switch must be on the motherboard.

   Next step is look up RAM setup in the manual and probably halt the system
and change the jumper on the systemboard.

Sounds like the FSB and/or clock multiplier are incorrect, i.e. you're 
overclocking it :)

Charlie,

   No, it's not overclocked by design or error. The bloody motherboard has
failed. Here're the details:

   It's the VIA KT600 chipset on this board, and the DDR 400MHz RAM is
correct. My other system has the KT333 chipset on an MSI motherboard and
works just fine.

   The Soyo manual has a trouble-shooting appendix. In the section on the
system locking up they suggest setting the "fail-safe" options in the BIOS.
Well, I did that and now the system neither boots nor lets me back into the
BIOS to change the settings. All I get is the (ahem!) "pretty" Soyo logo on
the full screen, a bit of hard drive activity, then nothing. Reset gets me
back to the same place.

   I'm more than a bit annoyed. I'll call Soyo tomorrow, but I suspect the
board has failed on me. And, I never got my rebates on it, either.

Subject: [PLUG] DVI, PCI, Linux
Message-ID: <20051024181648.GA13058@gate.kl-ic.com>


Well, I bought the nice 19 inch LCD monitor (A Viewsonic VA912B,
runner-up was a Samsung 930V, and no, Costco no longer has Princeton
and I no longer buy from Dell) and brought it home and hooked it
up to the built-in HD15 video on the Shuttle ST62K microATX I plan
to use with it.  It does not look as good as at the store - the
built-in VGA on the Shuttle has less-than-perfect bandwidth, and
the worst case test image (alternating rows of black and white
pixels) looks a little streaky.  This indicates that the sampler
in the Viewsonic is not sharply selecting the center of the pixels.
The streaky is not bad, but it also results in text characters
that are not as sharp as they should be.

The ST62K does have one PCI slot, which I can sacrifice to the
gods of sharp video.  I will not be gaming or running videos on
the box, so I can live with slow video.  I can put a DVI (digital
video interface) card in there, and drive the monitor that way,
and get maximum sharpness.  My wife, who I am building the system
for, says "it is good enough already", but if she is to support 
me in my old age I can't have her going blind ...

---------------------------------------------------------------
So, the question:  What currently available PCI (not AGP) video
cards support DVI and Linux?  I would love something with open
source drivers and super-duper performance, but I will settle
for binary drivers and 2D functional and cheap.
---------------------------------------------------------------

Keith

P.S.  I am running Fedora Core 4 and xorg on the box - I assume
all the drivers are available on the CD or from up2date/yum .

You used to be able to get PCI cards based on the ATI Radeon RV100 
(aka Radeon 7000) set. If they're still available, avoid them, at 
least for now. There's a severe X.Org bug that renders them useless 
for anything but text mode. See the Red Hat bugzilla entry for info:

   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=170008

When it worked, however, the 7000 combined with the X.Org radeon 
driver was pretty good...

   A set of patches to X.org-8.6.2 came out shortly after the original
release. I've no idea if the latest patches fix that problem.

Here's link where someone compared all of the X drivers.
http://www.tjansen.de/xfree-features/

It appears to me that an ATI 9x00 PCI card meets your requirements, though
the 9250 might require patching X.  Newegg still has a Diamond 9200SE card.
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814103155

Note that I don't own an ATI card, so you should do your own research as
well.  I'm just been shopping for a PCIe card, so that's why I had some of
this info.

Has anyone used screen in multiuser mode?

I've found several different pages out on Google, and none of
them have help me with this.

I start a screen session and then configure it to allow another
user to connect:

Ctrl-A : multiuser on
Ctrl-A : addacl root

My friend is root on the box, running CentOs 3.

He types screen -list and it says:

	No Sockets found in /root/.screen

We've tried various command line options with -x and have
gotten nowhere.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

I can't make any specific recommendations for cards, but I'd suggest
shopping for them at the FreeGeek store.  They have lots of PCI cards,
some with DVI connectors.  And the PFY who interns there is pretty
knowledgable about them.

If you're root, just su to the user that owns it, and 'screen -Ax'

There may be a better solution.. but that's what I'd do :)

Pretty tall order, DVI has been getting more common, but even now DVI
isn't universal for all graphics chip outputs. New graphics chips are
tending to have AGP or PCIe connections, not PCI.

As mentioned on the last graphics chip thread, you've got two options, an
ATi chip or an nVIDIA chip. You /might/ just find a card with a Matrox
chip that can accomodate your desires as well. Support will not be an
issue, you'll have the choice of closed-source and super capable, or
open-source and merely capable.

The problem will be finding a PCI card with a DVI card. Your most likely
candidates will be cards with nVIDIA MX440 or MX4000 chips. Their 3D
performance is unimpressive now, but they're capable chips and they're
recent enough that you'll have reasonable odds of finding one with a DVI
output.

Subject: [PLUG] broken squirrelmail login after upgrade
Message-ID: <20051025003910.GA16923@patch.com>

Google isn't being useful here.  Yesterday I did a classic:

apt-get update
apt-get upgrade

and today logging into squirrelmail is broken.

log file shows:
Oct 24 17:04:29 tire dovecot-auth: PAM unable to dlopen(/lib/security/pam_unix.so)
Oct 24 17:04:29 tire dovecot-auth: PAM [dlerror: /lib/libselinux.so.1: symbol regexec, version GLIBC_2.3.4 not defined in file libc.so.6 with link time reference]
Oct 24 17:04:29 tire dovecot-auth: PAM adding faulty module: /lib/security/pam_unix.so

yet `strings /lib/libc.so.6` does indeed show a GLIBC_2.3.4 reference.

Is this a pam, glibc, libselinux, squirrelmail or what error? [1]

Suggestions on how to set things right?

The fact that libselinux.so.1 is involved suggests insufficient 
permissions. Do you have any SELinux audit logs that suggest that a 
change in security contexts is called for?

(Yeah, I know I'm top posting.  Live with it.)

dovecot needed to be force upgraded.  All fine now.

Used to be that ckermit had to be downloaded/installed seperately from a 
distributiion.  Interestingly Fedora Core 3 had it in the distribution. 
Ckermit support just about and terminal emulation that can be found, some 
really obscure ones also.  The scripting language is fairly robust also.

And to mention something I saw earlier.. there's no special cisco 
cables. Some devices require a nullmodem cable, but that's not special. 
if you have serial->cat5 converters, the easy thing to do is check to 
see if it says "console" or "terminal."

Most devices talk @ 9600 with 8N1. or 7N1. I've seen some storage arrays 
that require 38400.. but that's the exception.

Google this: site:cisco.com connecting serial port
The first webpage explains step by step.

If your question is just about minicom, see the manpage, or use CTRL-A Z 
to access the help.. it's pretty easy, just hit 'o' to configure, then 
select serial port settings.

Thanks Carla

As I read the article I realize my mistake...

Com1 is ttyS0...  So that is why it didn't work...

Also Cisco Routers/Switches use a role-over cable...

So from com1  you need a DB9/25 to RJ45 adapter. Then a role-over cable
to the console port..

<A role-over cable has pin 1 to 8, 2 to 7, 3 to 6, etc,>


Thanks

May the Force be with YOU!!  <Dim or not>

I think the "special cisco cable" referred to was a rollover cable,
which is used on newer Ciscos instead of a DB9 connector.  Rollover
cables ARE different than cat5 straight-through cables.

That's what I was referring to. I know you can use normal adapters with 
a crossover cat5 cable too :)

Most newer cisco's use a RJ45 connector that take a regular patch cable 
and "terminal" serial adapter, or the other with a crossover cable. It's 
all dependant on what the device think it is in terms of serial 
communication: a modem or a terminal.

Carla,

Nice article. There's a link in your article to
http://www.loop-back.com/rs232_std.html, which has a
section called "Where is Pin 1". The connector diagrams
don't indicate which side of the connector is shown -
the front side or the back side. Any reader that tries
to build a special cable would have to work that out.

  I'm running an MythTV box with a 1.3G P4 CPU.  The stock box roared
like an F-14 on a takeoff roll.  I stuffed the ATX motherboard inside
a Antec Sonata with a Quiet PC kit.

  Sorry about that...  I hit the "send" instead of the "save" button.

  I also added a quiet CPU and two quiet case fans.  The system is
whisper quiet when I'm sitting next to the machine.  It's completely
silent when it's across the room in my TV stand.

Multiple uplinks?  I've been trynta make that work, too.  There was a
MWVLUG presentation on that recently, but I missed it.  

I've unsuccessfully tried the kernel-router based instructions at:
http://lartc.org/howto/lartc.rpdb.multiple-links.html

Currently thinking about using Zebra instead:

Subject: [PLUG] 2.4.20 kernel and 3com ethernet card?
Message-ID: <1130357340.14973.15.camel@badger.had1.or.comcast.net.>

Server is a Fedora Core 3 computer, dual opteron. Every day or three (I
haven't been charting the reboots) it dies; it appears to be up but
connections to it just stop. It only comes up on restart (although I
haven't gone down to the colocation to try ifdown/ifup on the network
card.)

It looks to me like a problem with the driver for the ethernet card. But
I've always liked 3com cards, and thought they were pretty reliable.
One result of googling the error looks like an answer might lie in using
lilo's -noapic flag, but I don't know what the ramifications on a dns /
web server would be.  

All the drivers are loaded into the kernel; no modules are present in a
lsmod.

Any suggestions? More ideas on how to solve this issue?

Thanks.
Russ

***The Real Problem with Textbooks: A SafariU Editorial 
The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports that textbook prices

Indeed I have!  Mine was my workstation with a TV tuner card installed.
 I then used bash scripts and mencoder to save TV shows for me to watch
whenever (or live, I suppose).

It was very ghetto.  :-)

I would suggest having a look at MythTV.

I went through this a month ago when I replaced my old tower system. The power 
supply and 40mm chipset fan were so loud and I don't know how I put up with 
all that noise for 4 1/2 years.  I got a huge Zalman copper heatsink with a 
120MM fan that is variable speed. I also got a 480W Thermaltake Silent 
Purepower power supply that has an adjustable fan on it and which allows me 
to lower the speed of one of its fans. 

By far the most noise is the power supply if the fan speed is at 100%. With a 
120MM fan on the CPU cooler I don't really hear much difference in noise 
between low and high speed so I tend to just run the CPU fan at nearly full 
speed.

I didn't spare any expense for heat sinks and got copper heat spreaders for my 
PC3200 DIMMs as well. I've seen some memory that includes the heat spreaders 
but the Kingston memory I got didn't have them so I added them. 

About the only thing I notice is that my mirrored SATA-150 are not silent when 
the head seek mechinism activates but they SATA drives are much quieter than 
the my old 10K RPM Ultra160 SCSI drives I had in my old system.

I was also tired of having a heavy tower case made out of steel and so I also 
splurged for a Lian Li aluminum case. It's noticably ligher but that monster 
Zalman heatsink I got really adds some weight. The bright blue power LED on 
the Lian LI case makes a great nightlight in TV room. I cannot believe how 
bright it is. :-D

On one of our servers (UnitedLinux 1.0), when we reboot the system, the /etc/localtime symlink (or file) vanishes. I'm not sure where in the process it goes away.  I set into /etc/init.d/boot.local a line to symlink the file from the original in /usr/share/zoneinfo/america, but that's an imperfect fix because some services that are already running need to be restarted to get the right time stamps (mysql, sendmail, etc , although syslogd has the correct time).

Any ideas on why it's vanishing, or how to correct it?

Grepping for localtime in /etc/rc.d/ (recursive) doesn't yield any promising results; just the boot.local entry.

Most of the x86_64 problems that I know of are either plugin problems
for the 64-bit Firefox (such as Flash, which you might find you don't
miss after all) or related to greyhat multimedia apps (such as the
w32codecs for mplayer/xine/etc).  As long as any apps you need to run
are either pure 32-bit or pure 64-bit I think you won't really notice
the difference from a user perspective.  You can work around the above
problems by installing the 32-bit versions of
Firefox/mplayer/xine/etc, but things like automagic updates (yum) will
get hairy.

Also, hacks like ndiswrapper can be a problem if there's no 64-bit
Windows driver for your wireless.  The only one I know of that works
is the Broadcom driver (what I have).

Just for balance-sake, a good question to ask yourself is if there's
any reason why you *should* install x86_64, such as >4GB memory or
apps that will take (noticable) advantage of the extra general purpose
registers and enhanced instruction set.

I was wondering when that article would appear. (Now to find a copy.)
For the record, I got paid twice as much for the article as I do for my 
work on the PLUG webpage. (Yes, I do such a good job I was told my pay 
would be tripled.)

As others have mentioned, bigger fans move as much or more air at lower 
rpms. The noise you hear is from the tips of the blades cutting through 
the air. If the fan is going slower, there's less noise.

I made sure all fans in my system were at least 80mm. The case fan is 
120mm.

I didn't get any, but I've also seen fans that were driven with magnets 
around the perimeter of the housing, not at the hub. All blades were 
attached to each other at the tip to eliminate the tip noise.

I know my new system is much quieter than my old one. Now to quiet down 
my server rack... :/

According to Eric, who did the benchmarks, the 64bit code runs about twice 
as fast as the 32 bit code.  Of course some things run only in 32 bit, so 
that may hamper your options.  You can mix and match, however.

   I know that some of you use LaTeX/LyX for your writing. I've been looking
for a better 2D vector graphics editor that tgif; that's sorta' OK, but the
text is not up to TeX standards. So, today I downloaded, installed, and
tested three of the dozen-plus that are available: jpicedt, ipe, and dia.

   For my test diagrams, the first two are really great because their native
format is .eps or .pdf and they compile directly into a .dvi or .pdf file.
The text, of course, is outstanding. 'Dia' is supposed to be a visio clone,
and I'm not sure how to take its output for use in a LaTeX document or beamer
slide presentation.

   jpicedt is written in java; ipe in C++ (with Qt as the UI toolkit). They
both took a bit of trial and error to learn their ways, but I really like
both and would be hard pressed to select one over the other. Both are highly
recommended. If I find some cute clipart images that work in dia, I'll
probably use that one, too.

Hope that someone finds this useful,

Rich -

Have you tried Inkscape at all?  It seems to be more of a CorelDraw
clone than a Visio clone, but that could be useful too, and it does
save in .ps and .eps (and .epsi, whatever that is) amongst other
formats.  I don't know about clipart.

Jason,

    I looked at it, but there was a serious glitch in installing it or getting
it to work; I forget which.

    Most of my needs are less in the area of CorelDraw/Visio and more in the
area of PSTricks, Gri (for data plotting), and the like. They're technical
drawings rather than graphic illustrations. If that subtle distinction makes
sense to you.

    There are at least 15 2D vector drawing programs that I've identified so
far for linux and other F/OSS. And that doesn't count plotting routines in
languages like python (matlibplot, sciplot) and others. Each is very good and
better at fulfilling some needs or working preferences than are others, and
each has a strong following who like and use them.

Thanks,

Rich

   I've had an interesting exchange with Rod Singleton, a key player in the
OO.o online presence. They went with native installers for 2.0 because there
was no one maintaining the 1.1.x installer. They'd like to have that
distribution-agnostic tool again, but need help.

   I know some of you are affiliated with OSS programs at OSU, PSU, OGI, and
whatever, so I'm asking you to put out the word that there is a need to be
addressed. Perhaps it's worth a masters thesis, perhaps someone who needs a
direction to apply his/her expertise. The paragraph below summarizes the
situation. If you -- or someone you know -- is interested, please contact Rod
directly.

Thanks,

I can understand your situation. I was hoping that you had the
resources. Too bad you do not. Maybe someone else who would like to see
the old installer back will read our exchange and step in. I guess that
is the best we can expect.

I think every unsecured USB port just got disabled on networks across

"Universal PC Access. With BlackDog, developers can access all

Combine that with an SDK?  Scary IMHO.

>4GB may be the line where you need 64-bit address space *period*, but it
becomes worthwhile before then. In particular you run into the issue of
the shared kernel address space versus user address space. Perhaps I'm
used to 2.4, but the kernel always grabbed a minimum of 1GB of address
space. There is also the issue that the Unix paradigm for code is that it
is always available (notably startup/shutdown code), and you simply swap
out those portions, rather than bothering to unmap them. This also serves
to clutter address space.

Due to these factors I'd tend to place the line at 2GB. Any more and
you're in danger of encountering one of these.

Dick,

   It does come from Germany:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ host 85.180.159.164
164.159.180.85.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer e180159164.adsl.alicedsl.de.

   Turn on the headers, then forward to abuse at alicedsl.de with a request that
they stop such use of their mail servers.

   You're not running your own MTA, but you could install and configure
SpamAssassin. Teach it to catch junk like this and you'll not see it in your
inbox any longer.

HTH,

Rich

I saw the .de and knew that it means Germany, but wondered when I saw 
the Netherlands reference in whois.

I wasn't aware that SpamAssassin would be of use to me, using 
Thunderbird to get mail from Comcast. I guess I'd better read up on 
SpamAssassin. Any recommendations for reading material, other than what 
I'll find at the SpamAssassin site?

   Sometimes the whois request stops at the owner of the IP address blocks. I
see this result from Europe and Asia on occasion. I don't know why they don't
always return the specific information on the domain registrant.

> I'll do that.

   What's really nice is sending abuse reports to the Brits. Most of them
respond with a sincere thank you note and tell you the results of your
report. Others may or may not act on the report because we never see anything
from them.

   No, I've no suggestions. Thunderchicken has spam filters and I'd start by
digging into the docs for that application, first. A quick Google search
didn't surface any obvious good tips on combining SA and TB.

All,

I was wondering if anyone encountered a make problem when building a kernel with
redhat ES/FC4, and if they have gotten around it?

I saw some references in message boards saying that redhat has broken the kernel
source tree to keep you from recompiling the kernel. Has anyone found a way
around this?

thanks,

Russ,

   The problem is that Dick doesn't run his own MTA so he can't check the RBLs
on incoming mail ... as far as I know.

   The RBLs I have checking incoming mail finds some IP addresses in all the
major ISPs world wide, including comcast.net, verizon.net, and a bunch in
Europe.

Message-ID: <f441a6240510281803p44ddd8c2v6e98972ae61c3e0e@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,
I have a csv file that I need a bash script to pull data from.

The format of the tab delimited csv file is...
last name, first name, other data, some more data

My ultimate goal is to get file.x to be renamed
lastname_first_otherdata_moredata.x for each user listed in the csv.

Is there a way for bash to pull the data line by line, or is another tool
needed? I couldn't seem to find anything that I could specify a line to
read. I think I could scrape the rest of the script together if I just could
find a way to read a specific line.

Any suggestions?

Thanks

   awk. Or, gawk as it's called on most linux systems. It's a great tool for
what you want to do.

I haven't.  You mean either ES or FC4, right?

Very, very unlikely.  Also a GPL violation.

  It's not really broken.  I just won't compile.  :-)

  My understanding is that the RedHat licenced offerings include
non-GPL secret-sauce in the kernel.  The non-GPL files are removed
when the GPL portions of the source are posted on their web site.  The
GPL code won't compile without the non-GPL code or extensive code
cleanup.

The folks at White Box Linux may have a replacement kernel that compiles.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0510290930400.29343@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I've been offered a tentative invitation to participate in a "web
conference" some time next month. My research on Google suggests that all the
software used by vendors of the service run only on Winduhs. If that's the
case, I strongly suspect that one needs a winduhs system to participate. That
ain't gonna' happen here.

   All this got me thinking: has anyone used F/OSS for web conferencing? I
presume that one needs to have working audio, video, and a way to hook a
microphone to the system. It's not something of a high priority, but I could
see a benefit for project collaboration.

I lifted the lid on that worm can and quickly closed it again! I took a 
deep breath and looked again, and now I know why I just use Thunderbird 
with the standard Comcast e-mail account. Perhaps, someday, I'll have 
time to dig into this more deeply.

Is there some way to set myself up to run a MTA and still use 
Thunderbird and Comcast? Or do I need to switch to a different e-mail 
client (and fiddle with stuff I haven't taken the time to read up on 
related to Unix mail systems) to be able to do that? From the brief 
perusal I gave the SpamAssassin site last night, it appears that I can't 
use it with my current setup.

As I understand it, Comcast is running some kind of spam filtering for 
me, and it does catch a fair amount of stuff, storing it in my space on 
their server for some period of time and then deleting it. IIRC, I can 
chose to have this filtering on or off, but don't have any way to tweak 
the settings. I wish they offered a bit more, but I guess that would be 
too much for them to administer.

I have friends on SpiritOne who have access to their own black lists and 
white lists. It would be nice if Comcast were to add even that much. I'd 
consider switching, but we're too far out in the country to get a high 
speed connection from anyone other than Comcast.

Thanks to both of you for your ideas.

Fetchmail works well for a lot of this. It can retrieve and then have 
programs (like spamassassin) process the mail.

Once it's on your system(s), you can then use whatever you want, 
including thunderbird, to read the mail.

GnomeMeeting?  Should work with H.323 (such as MS Netmeeting).

That is completely bogus.  I have successfully recompiled the RHEL4
(AS) kernel from the .src.rpm in the past by extracting it with
rpmbuild and then building it just like any other kernel.  To suggest
that they have non-GPL code in their kernels is just FUD.  Take a look
around, you'll notice the RedHat kernel engineers are the most
violently anti-binary kernel module people (such as nVidia).

Stop spreading this crap.

Dick,

   Yes and no; but there are cable subscription subtleties that others need to
address. Here's the short story on Internet mail.

   There are four major categories of software involved:

   1.) Retrieval from a remote server (I don't know the formal name for this
category). 'fetchmail' is the most usually used in the linux world for this.
The protocols involved are POP3 (Post Office Protocol) and IMAP (Internet
Message Access Protocol). You are probably using one of these protocols to
collect your mail from Comcast. If you run your own server you don't need
this on a local machine, but you need POP3 or IMAP on other hosts.

   2.) The mail server, more formally the Mail Transport Agent (MTA; and not
what The Kingston Trio song glorifies). This implements the SMTP (Simple Mail
Transport Protocol) that takes an incoming message and determines where to
send it next. Examples of MTAs include sendmail, postfix, exim, qmail, and
smail. If you install and configure the MTA, you can filter incoming mail and
reject the spam before the full message is sent; the decisions are based on
the initial conversation between the remote server (the client) and your
server. This takes you off Comcast's mail server which may not be permitted
by their contract.

   3.) The Local Delivery Agent (LDA), usually procmail. When the server
accepts an incoming message because the next step is in the local network,
it passes the message on to the LDA for local delivery to the proper mailbox.
More filtering can occur here; usually assigning the mail to the proper
recipeient and appropriate "folder" or file based on selection criteria.
SpamAssassin usually sits between the MTA and the LDA.

   4.) The Mail User Agent (MUA), more commonly called the mail client or mail
reader. Thunderbird, Sylpheed, Kmail, pine, mutt, elm, and a few dozen others
are all available for use.

   Incoming mail uses categories 2-4, and sometimes 1. Outgoing mail uses
categories 4 and 2.

   The mail system is analagous to a family dinner at your favorite Chinese
restaurant: pick one from Column A, one from Column B, one from Column C, and
one from Column D. You can mix and match to your heart's content.

   So, you could certainly continue to use Thunderbird as your MUA, regardless
of how mail goes in or out. Do you want to learn the subtleties of
installing, configuring, and maintaining your own server? Only if the
incoming spam is sufficiently annoying that you find the time and effort
worth while. Some of us do, many others don't.

   Tune Thunderbird. I've not looked into that because when Pamela complains
about spam I take care of it system-wide.

   And there's the rub. There was an interesting thread on the postfix mail
list a week or so ago on this very topic. In Europe, apparently, the goal is
to provide high bandwidth connections to everyone via the telephone systems.
In this country regulations have been enacted to keep the various interests
(not the consumers', of course) well protected. In other words, politics as
usual. And that is not an invitation for a flame thread, just a statement of
reality.

Jason,

   Thanks for the pointer. However, it looks like there's too much hardware,
software, and underware to learn, configure, and support for it to be worth
my time and effort. Good to know, however.

I've ridden on Boston's MTA, more properly the MBTA -- Massachusetts Bay 
Transportation Authority, or the "T." Be very grateful your e-mail does not!

This will probably seem Dim to Sum. (Sorry, couldn't resist.)

As time permits, I'll work on it. Russ recommended fetchmail as a way to 
get started. I'll start by reading up on it.

I just looked at Tools>Junk Mail Controls... and found that I've got it 
tuned as much as it offers. It doesn't have a blacklist, but it does 
allow one to white list everyone in one of your address books. It allows 
mail I mark as Junk to be moved to the junk folder, or deleted, but it's 
all or none. It has an adaptive filter that processes incoming mail and, 
based on history, moves what it considers junk to the junk folder. I'm 
using all of those features. But, none of those allow selective 
prevention of e-mail delivery.

Ah, yes. The Golden Rule: Them what has the gold, rules. Well, it's 
taking time, but as consumers learn more about what's in their best 
interest, and as technology creates options for more competition, things 
can change. (Sorry, no example comes immediately to mind -- just a 
feeling that I've seen small, positive changes over the years.)

Thanks for the overview. I can see that there is more to learn, and that 
it is important to get it right.

Ordinarily, no it doesn't. $EACH will be each whitespace-separated 
token, not each line. You have two choices if you want to use a shell 
loop:

1. Rely on bash-specific line magic by using a while loop:

    while read L; do echo $L; done < source.txt

2. Reset $IFS to a newline character and do as Russ suggested:

    IFS=$(echo)
    for L in $(<source.txt); do echo $L; done
    unset IFS

Otherwise, Rich's advice about using awk is worth considering!

I have a real problem with Dia ... there doesn't seem to be any way to 
get its units of page measurement and grid into inches!! That's a 
show-stopper for me. Maybe it works fine in countries where metric is 
the rule, like most of the civilized world, but I work in the USA. Other

Hi, Rich,

Off hand, I am not aware of a net collaboration tool that speaks
'proprietary' as we do business using only documented standards wherever
possible.

However, as you are also on a kind of fact finding mission for future
reference I thought I would point you to the "Hexagon" project I glanced
briefly at last week:

  http://hexagon.open.ac.uk/

The project's site includes an online demo. It seems to have the ability
to utilize cross-platform microphone and video camera inputs.

Size is relative. Make the lines per major equal 6 or 12, and then each 
line would be one inch.

Of course, this doesn't help with fractions, but I'm trying...

The other day as my Dell Dimensions Windows 2000 machine was rebooting 
after another round of patches I was wondering if it was the Microsoft 
patches slowing it down or the Norton updates.  Then I downloaded my 
banking activity into MS-Money and found either my installation was 
hosed or the bank had "tweaked" something as most (but not all) of the 
transactions for the last month duplicated.  About then a pop up window 
appeared.  Norton told me if I didn't pay another year's fee for their 
software which protects me from the software MS sold me then, well, 
awful things might happen and they'd hate to see that happen to a nice 
fellow like me.  They're going to give me 72 hours to come up with the 
dough.

After a few minutes I realized that wasn't my dog growling, it was my 
molars grinding and the old twitch was back in my left eye.  Time to 
move to Linux for my blood pressure I think.

I use Debian stable for a server OS on my network but it can get 
hopelessly outdated for a desktop.  So I'm looking at Knoppix and 
Ubuntu.  I may install both for a while.  Given that I'd like some 
advice on some desktop applications.

E-mail: I confess, I prefer Outlook.  I've been using Thunderbird lately

This variation works on my version of bash:

IFS=,;while read varA varB varC; do echo "$varC $varB $varA"; done < source.txt

but it won't handle complex cases, like embedded commas within a field.

   Dimension in millimeters / 25.4 = dimension in inches

   I'm always interested when I find folks for whom it's easier multiplying
and dividing by 12, 16, or furlongs per fortnight than 10. Simple folks like
me use the power of 10 fingers (and toes) and find the SI so much easier on
the brain. No more pondering how many tablespoons in a cup while the pot
boils over.

   Since there are no video cameras or microphones here, use of such software

   I'll let others address GUI MUA options; I've always perferred the command
line and text-oriented applications. I use pine, others like mutt. I also use
jpilot <http://www.jpilot.org/> as the desktop component of my PDA:
addressbook, calendar, to-do list, notes. I've never cared for integrated
"suites" because they limit choices. You might look at sylpheed and see if
that's closer to what you've come to like and want.

   Gnucash <http://www.gnucash.org/>. It ain't difficult, a simplistic
double-entry checkbook register and money management application that
apparently imports Microsoft-generated data. It's great for personal use, but
for business use get SQL-Ledger.

   I've a bookcase stereo system in the office so I've no idea on this.

   OpenOffice.org-2.0 works as an Office replacement. For serious writing, use
LyX, the GUI-front end to LaTeX <http://www.lyx.org/>.

   Even when I was a young curmudgeon I didn't like machines that thought they
were smarter than I am. I still don't like computers to make decisions for
me. Integrated applications fall in this class: you're stuck with what you
get, and you learn that what you're allowed to do is something to emulate as
you defenestrate.

   I believe that one of the most difficult aspects of moving from Microsoft
to linux (or any of the other F/OSS platforms) is coping with choice. You're
moving from a dearth of choices to a plethora of choices. And, they cost you
no money (unless you voluntarily contribute to show appreciation). Don't
think this is a trivial point; it isn't.

   In a thread on 2D vector drawing software I started a couple of days ago, I
noted that I've identified 16 different options, including the venerable
xfig. Others have added to the count. Each is "good" to a different degree,
and each is a bit more capable (or has a shorter learning curve) for
different types of drawings. I've used xfig before moving to tgif, and now
I'm using PSTricks (creating figures directly in PostScript code), jpicedt
(which is a visual creator of PSTricks output), and ipe (which is a visual
editor directly producing .pdf output).

   Writing letters, memos, and other short stuff? There's OpenOffice.org,
AbiWord, Koffice (if you use KDE), a gnome equivalent (I'm sure), LaTeX, text
editors galore, and probably much more of which I am unaware.

   Perhaps it's equivalent to moving from a small city apartment to a rural
house. You go from limited (or no) choices to having options on everything.
It can be scary or overwhelming at first. But, the end result is that you
work with applications that fit *you* and your way of working. Others can
select different applications, yet the data are interchageable (for the most
part) and it doesn't matter what tool created the document.

Have fun and enjoy the journey,

Rich

Evolution works for me, as an outlook replacement. It has mail,
contacts, calendars, tasks. I used Mutt for a while, but since I let the
kid install Zoo Tycoon on my windows box, I'm doing a lot more in gnome.

Maybe Knoppix has improved it's "install to hard disk" since 3.4, but if 
you prefer an "easy to install organization-backed" distro to one that's 
developed and maintained by a closely-knit band of hackers, I'd go with 
Ubuntu if you're looking for Debian compatibility. There are two flavors 
of Ubuntu. Ubuntu itself has a Gnome desktop; Kubuntu has a KDE desktop. 
You could, if you wanted, install Ubuntu and add in KDE from the Debian 
repositories, but I consider that a waste of time and disk space. Pick 
your desktop and pick your Ubuntu.

If you don't want or need Debian compatibility, you could look at 
CentOS. CentOS is an RHEL clone. Other the denizens of this list, there 
isn't a whole lot of Debian adminstration expertise you can fall back on 
if you get into trouble, but there are lots of Red Hat folk. I have one 
system running CentOS 4.2 now, and I like it. It's very stable and 
secure ... the desktop is perhaps a bit "outdated" for your taste, but I 
have had rotten luck with Fedora Core, so I switched to CentOS.

I use Thunderbird and I'm happy with it. I haven't tried the calendar 
piece of the Mozilla suite yet (is it "Sunbird?") Evolution has more 
features and is probably the closest to Outlook in the open source 
world. However ... so-called Personal Information Management software is 
a vibrant field right now in the "web 2.0" space. There are lots of 
gimmicks out there, *especially* if you're willing to trust your data to 
a web-based "service bureau/ASP" model.

Big names like Google are beginning to offer stuff like this, not just 
small teams with advanced ways of managing personal information looking 
for venture capital. I'm much more interested in the second type, 
however, because I *don't* trust my data to a service bureau. :)

Right now I'm tracking something called "Chandler", named after Raymond 
Chandler of the mystery novels. It's about 0.5 release level right now; 
the last release they call stable dates back to about April. I wouldn't 
trust a business to it yet, of course, but it looks like their 
combination of hierarchy (trees), facets and tags has the potential to 
revolutionize the PIM. Have a look at

http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Journal/HierarchyVersusFacetsVersusTags
http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Journal/TooManyWaysToOrganize
http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Journal/ChandlerInFifteenMinutes

I don't do personal finance in Linux. I think "gnucash" or whatever it's 
called these days is the only thing out there with enough features to 
match Money or Quicken.

My idea of a media player is several hundred classical CDs, noise 
cancelling headphones, and "allclassical.org". Other than that, I can't 
help you. :)

That was actually going to be my *real* advice -- get a new Windows XP 
system with the latest advanced supported hardware and upgrade all your 
applications like a good boy. :) I didn't think that would fly on a 
Linux list, but since *you* mentioned it first ...

<ducking>

> Of course general rants about MS software are ALWAYS appreciated!

I think Microsoft's monopoly on the desktop is fading rather rapidly, 
mostly because of the big money behind Google and the flurry of activity 
in AJAX, web 2.0, Ruby on Rails and the semantic web. As Criswell used 
to say, "The future is where we will spend the rest of our lives".

I'm not sure that a Google monopoly is a better idea than a Microsoft 
monopoly, a Sun monopoly, or an IBM monopoly. And Microsoft certainly 
isn't standing still -- I've heard good things about the UI for the next 
version of Office, and they've got the cash to buy into these emerging 
technologies. Cheap Linux servers, Cheap Linux desktops and cheap 
broadband will move the concentration of power around, but the power 
will still be concentrated *somewhere*. That's the way complex adaptive 
systems work.

Russ, et al.,

   I _thought_ eveolution was similar but I didn't know for sure. The point I
neglected to make in my original post is that we often seek a replacement
that "has the functionality" of that which we currently use. Often this is
because of familiarity and because we have no direct experience with
different functionality that we might actually prefer.

   By the way, there's a brand new book out from No Starch Press called "Just
Say No To Microsoft," by Tony Bove. Jason -- and others -- may find this very
useful. Chapter 4 (on alternatives to Word) is available for download from
the book's web site (and from groklaw.net's link). It looks like a very
useful guide to defenestrating.

I know ... I was trained as a scientist and if it came to a vote, I 
would have moved the USA to metric decades ago. I consider the British 
move to a decimal currency the most recent encouraging sign. :) Now if 
they'd just start driving on the right side of the road ...

   Gee! What happened to Gentoo? There was a lot of interest in that
distribution here not too long ago. Not to start a big discussion, but is an
enterprise-level OS (CentOS, RHEL, etc.) really appropriate for a stand alone
desktop workstation -- without a lot of reconfiguring? And, while considering
options, don't overlook The Quiet Distribution: Slackware.

   Do you use a PalmOS PDA? If so, pilot-link comes with all distributions and
jpilot is a great desktop version of what you have on the hand-held. Very
highly recommended.

   Some of us prefer that concentration locally, where we make the decisions.

Actually, it's *worse* than that! Because of curmudgeons who want these 
things *their* way, the software limits choice in some ways and provides 
dozens -- hundreds is probably more like it -- of other choices, 
euphemistically referred to as "customizations" in meaningless areas. 
I'm talking about things like how the menus unfold, whether or not you 
have cute sounds or talking paper clips, desktop themes, etc.

Actually, it's worse than *that*! Because a Windows desktop supposedly 
has to serve a family, a small business or a network of knowledge 
workers in an enterprise, it takes lots of time to eliminate the 
distractions built in to the core of it -- media players, surfing the 
web from your desk, instant messaging from people two cubes away, visual 
UIs for auditory thinkers, email arguments preserved for all time. It 
takes a tremendous amount of discipline for a knowledge worker to 
mainain the focus required.

Well ... you can sculpt an elephant two ways. You can start with an 
armature, add clay slowly to it until it has the elephant shape you 
want, or you can start with a big chunk of marble, a hammer and a chisel 
and cut off everything that doesn't look like an elephant. :)

So ... start with Windows XP, Office 200x, Microsoft Money, anti-virus, 
Internet Explorer, etc. and get rid of everything you don't need or use. 
Or start with a bare machine, load Linux, a lightweight desktop like 
XFCE, and add on "best of breed" applications for your tasks.

Either way you'll get close to the elephant you need, and either way it 
*will* be your unique elephant. But the Linux elephant will be less 
expensive. And you'll be able to hang out with folks like us without 
hanging your head in shame. :)

1. AbiWord is the Gnome word processor, I think.

2. KOffice is pretty lame compared to OpenOffice.org. Flames welcomed 
from KOffice fans. I use the KDE desktop, but I've never done anything 
productive in KOffice.

3. You mentioned LyX for LaTeX work. There is another tool that's 
slightly more advanced but a bit harder to use, called TeXmacs.

As a previous (and current) MS Money user I have a few opinions about
the state of open-source personal finances.  An interesting starting
point for now might be the two-part LWN.net article on personal
finance:

http://lwn.net/Articles/149383/
and
http://lwn.net/Articles/153043/

You're not likely to find anything as sleek or smooth working as MS
Money or Quicken, but as far as I know GNUcash is probably the best
choice.  I tried it for a while, got sick of the interface, and went
back to MS Money.  I'll probably try again if they ever get the Gnome
2 port done.  I haven't tried KMyMoney yet, thought it sounds
promising and actually has active developers.

I also experimented briefly with Moneydance!
(http://www.moneydance.com/), which is a closed-source Java-based
personal finance package with a free trial.  It seemed somewhat
impressive, but I never finished playing with it, instead went back to
MS Money (2003).  Personal finances is something I just want to get
done, not spend lots of time on :-)

Jason

P.S.  On a side note, I upgraded at one point to Money 2005 and didn't
like that either, so maybe I'm just too picky.

"I use Debian stable for a server OS on my network but it can get
hopelessly outdated for a desktop.  So I'm looking at Knoppix and
Ubuntu.  I may install both for a while.  Given that I'd like some
advice on some desktop applications."

I highly recommend Mepis Linux (http://www.mepis.org) - I've been using 
it as my Desktop Linux for about 1 year and absolutely love it. 
Hardware installs like a dream (though YMMV).  Everything works with 
minimal configuration, if any.  In my experience, this is unusual for a 
desktop distro with multimedia desires - especially a free one.  Updates 
with apt-get/synaptic run great - Mepis uses some of Debian's 
repositories in addition to it's own.  The install disc is also a 
live-CD so you can try it out to see how well it works with your 
hardware before committing to it.  I've tried both Ubuntu and Knoppix 
and both miss one or two hardware things - nothing major, just didn't 
see the point in spending time with an installer that didn't recognize 
hardware as effortlessly as Mepis.

"E-mail: I confess, I prefer Outlook."

Evolution is a great piece of software.  Provides nearly the same

  For calendaring, I use Mozilla's Sunbird, though am highly jealous of 
my wife's iCal on her Mac.  I wish Mozilla would release some worthwhile

"Personal Finance: I use an older version of MS Money right now"

I'm no accountant and I just keep up with my checking/savings.  I've 
used Moneydance (http://www.moneydance.com)for the last two years 
because of the cross-platform functionality between Windows/Mac/Linux 
(java-based app).  GnuCash may be better for you.

"Of course general rants about MS software are ALWAYS appreciated!"

I do have one rant, and surprisingly it's not directed towards MS: Apple 
needs to release a Linux installer of it's Quicktime software.  This 
genuinely irritates me that they have used BSD's core for their OS and 
then claim to be open source supporters.  Why in the world do they not 
release a Quicktime installer for Linux?  I refuse to buy an iPod on 
this fact alone.  Leaving us non-MS supporters to our own tricks and 
devices is frustrating.  Oh sure, they'll make a Windows installer...

Oh, I haven't abandoned Gentoo as my distro of choice. The only reason 
I'm running CentOS on *one* system is that I'm studying for the RHCE 
exam. Once that's done, that machine gets Gentoo on it again! My main 
workstation and the Linux half of the laptop are still Gentoo. The 
CentOS box is my "learn how to do server stuff" box; when I'm done with 
RHCE it's going to be a Linux/Apache/PostgreSQL/Rails web applications 
platform.

But yes, if you're willing to sacrifice nifty new features for 
rock-solid security, stability and Red Hat compatibility, CentOS 4.2 
makes a *fine* desktop. KDE is 3.3, for example. And so does Sarge.

I have a Palm PDA (built into an ancient Kyocera cell phone), a Windows 
CE Pocket PC and a Sharp Zaurus. I sync none of them with my desktop or 
each other; they are simply toys as far as I'm concerned. The last 
pocket sized device I actually found useful was the HP 100LX. It had a 
*usable* keyboard, and ran Lotus 1-2-3 2.4 and Derive. I could program 
it in Forth, and it had all the PIM functionality I needed. I have 
*never* found anything as good for the pocket.

The cell phone is about to get replaced with something stripped down 
that just makes phone calls -- no video, no color, no keyboard, no text 
messaging -- nothing but a phone that can remember frequently called 
numbers, of which I have about ten.

write your book with a turkey quill?

   I recently added several postfix restrictions and they all tested OK.
However, now I'm having the problem of a network host not being permitted to
send mail (incoming mail gets to the local user inbox, so it's just
outgoing).

   The MUA on that machine is thunderbird-1.0.6. When we try to send messages
from the draft folder (and there's no "send" icon on the toolbar so we need
to work from the file menu), this message pops up:

"An error occurred while sending mail. THe mail server responded:
<pachy.appl-ecosys.com (192.168.55.5)>: Client host rejected: Access denied.
Please verify that your email address is correct in your Mail preferences and
try again."

   Nothing's changed except for an OS and thunderbird upgrade. The hostname is
in /etc/hosts on the server, so is the IP address. The domain(s) are listed
in /etc/postfix/internal_network.db and /etc/postfix/our_domain_as_sender.db.
The smtp_recipient_restrictions begin with:
         check_client_access hash:/etc/postfix/internal_network
         check_sender_access hash:/etc/postfix/not_our_domain_as_sender
         reject_non_fqdn_recipient
         reject_non_fqdn_sender
         reject_unknown_sender_domain
         reject_unknown_recipient_domain
         permit_mynetworks

   I just do not see where the error is that prevents outgoing mail from
pachy. I'd appreciate your ideas -- and solutions.

Thanks,

Rich

   Is this a great mail list, or what? As soon as I sent the original message
I looked again at /etc/postfix/main.cf and that prompted me to look again at
/etc/postfix/our_domain_as_sender. Sure enough, I had only one domain name
there, not both of 'em.

   Added the other name, ran postmap, reloaded postfix and the problem's
solved.

   I think the act of asking for help provide the mental equivalent of a does

Unrelated to the problem you already solved: do you open the message 
before sending it? The only place I find a "send" icon is in the toolbar 
of a message composition window, not on the toolbar of the t-bird main 
window that is displaying the contents of the Drafts folder.

Dick,

   My apoloties to you and the group for the typos in that last message.

   Anywho, I don't use that MUA; Pamela does. I was trying to send from her
draft file and I wondered about the lack of icon in that situation. It does
make sense to have it on the window of a message that's being composed.

Thanks,

One technique I've heard that works as a sysadmin is to have a stuffed
bear outside your cube.  When someone comes up with a problem, they're
required to explain the entire problem/question to the bear before
they can interrupt you.  Often, the act of telling the bear is enough.

Maybe every mailing list subscriber should get a bear for their home
office. :)

sorry but to me this is either wrong or just too simple.

I have tried (and am trying again) to move from MS to Linux.  I
program for a living.  Luckily for that the sw that i use now has a
port to Linux so it makes that much easier.

But to intimate that Linux has a 'plethora' of options and MS doesn't
just isn't right.  Cost is important .. but it isn't the bottom line.
(i love it when linux guys always through that in<G>).  I do like to
donate ..

For myself (and a couple other guys i know that hare trying or have
tried) the real problem is that SW doesn't come complete.  It may be a
thrill and a hoot to have to go out an look for bits and pieces that
come up as missing when you try to install something.  But for me it
is a waste of time.  I have just loaded Fedora 4 on my laptop (it is
my main workstation.  If i can't get it to work with all hw on it then
i can't use it).  I loaded FULL as i really didn't want to see any of
those 'can't do that cause of missing bits' messages.  But I needed a
DVD player so I did a search on google and found one and downloaded
and tried to install.  Opps .. this library isn't there .. that bit
isn't there.  Did another search for some of the bits and there was no
clear information about the packages I needed.

THIS is the biggest problem.  You are right is saying there are a
'plethora' of options, though i believe generally there are still more
in MS, but the options often seem to be incomplete.  Well unless you
simply want a command line text editor.

I know that lots of linux guys don't like the gui .. lots (well the
ones i have talked to) have no problems with going out and finding the
pieces that didn't come through the install and other <shudder> can't
wait for a quick compile.

But lots of us who would love to make the move find it too time
consuming to do things .. like install a program.

By the way .. i love most all the bits you put up here .. smart and
insightful.  This just bugged me cause i had a bad weekend trying to
install linux apps <G>

You want automated dependency tracking and resolution... I don't think
you want FC4, at least not without addons to have it grab more packages.

Give a Debian derivitive a shot.  Ubuntu is popular (although I *still*
haven't tried it).  Or give Gentoo a shot.  Both those distributions
will automatically resolve dependencies for you.

You're absolutely right ... a Linux desktop is more work than a Windows 
desktop in the current state of things. However:

1. I recommend against Fedora Core for desktops. Debian-based systems 
have a better package management system and lots more packages 
available. Gentoo is close, but you might find having to recompile 
things too much trouble, and the Gentoo installer is definitely a 
hindrance for folks used to Windows. Of course, I also recommend against 
Fedora Core for servers; Debian Sarge and CentOS are my choices there.

2. Media players and digital media are an area littered with 
intellectual property issues. Some very rich folks want to keep you from 
ripping them off, so don't expect a lot of help in this area.

Thanks to all who gave me the benefit of your experience.  I now have
a triple boot Dell that runs Windows 2000, Ubuntu, and Kubuntu.  The
new Debian  installer quit instantly when booting from the CD so I'll
take a look at installing Debian from *ubuntu after I've read the
applicable section of the installation manual.

The *ubuntus are SLICK on the install.  Very nice.  The only problem
I've had so far was Ubuntu wouldn't burn a CD for me.  It kept saying
there was no media in the drive.

After the cautionary advice about Knoppix on this list I checked their
web page and sure enough they caution that some of the choices they
made to create a kick ass (it really is!) live distribution on CD make
it less than desireable as a hard drive install.  So I skipped it. 
I'll still keep a CD around for rescues though.

I'm installing these systems in 10 gig partitions on a 60 gig disk
with a shared swap partition.  No problem with hardware detection
(Dell Dimensions, Pentium 850, 256 Megs ram, dual hard drives, dual
CDs) or networking (DHCP, router, cable modem).  It all just works. 
Lovely!

I plan on installing a few more distributions and then spending a
couple of weekends playing with them.  Grub makes multi booting so
handy I think I'll keep one extra install for experiments.

On converting from MS I think some valid points were made on both
sides of the "choice" debate.  Linux does have a lot of options and of
course I'm looking for the one that's exactly the same as what I've
always used!  I'm looking for a revolution that doesn't actually
CHANGE anything.  Not bright!

This is just FUN!  Thanks again for the help.

David,

   This is a real problem, but one that's easily solved. Really! Let me try to
address some solutions.

   First, your distribution of choice. I went from DOS to linux in 1997 (with
a small window thrown in because I had no choice for some software) and used
Red Hat 4.0 because a clerk at Powell's suggested that over Slackware. From
then through 7.3 I went through dependency hell with every upgrade
(espefially the major number ones) and adding new apps. A couple of years ago
I moved from Red Hat 7.3 to Slackware-8.1 and haven't looked back since.
Other than security patches I do nothing from one release to the next. When I
want additional software, I grab the tarball and build it here. The only
problem I found was with source that wants the C++ STL; apparently Pat
doesn't like it and doesn't include it with Slackware. It's a known problem
and application providers have a work-around that solves the problem.

   My point is that Red Hat is not the only choice. I understand that Mepsis
is outstanding at recognizing hardware and including the proper drivers. A
lot of folks like Debian and its derivatives and feel they need to apt-get
every night. Shrug. They're welcome to it. There are probably more than five
dozen distributions available; you'll easily find one that works for you.
SuSE-10.0 is also supposed to be super simple and recognizes everthing. I've
read good things about Mandriva (nee Mandrake) over the years. And the list
goes on.

   I started working on mainframes in the early 1960s, was away from computers
for about a decade, and returned in the early 1970s. No GUIs, no full screen
editors. Paper tape, boxes of 80-column Hollerith cards that we dropped on
the floor, Teletype terminals. So, yes, I prefer the command line. But, I
really like working in X because I have 10 virtual desktops, can cut and
paste data from one application to another and prefer text-based applications
in virtual terminals. That written, I've become addicted to LyX, the GUI
frontend to LaTeX because I can write so much quicker than with emacs or
another text editor.

   You'll make up the time in not rebooting. :-)

   And, once you have the set of applications you need and want, there's
nothing to do by use them.

   Thanks for the compliment. And, when you have frustrations with an
installation, write to the list. It works.

Keep us informed of progress,

Rich

And this leads to another BIG problem .. which distribution.  You as 10
people you will get 8 different answers .. each may have 'linux' as
the OS but linux is useless without something around it. (well ok ..
not useless .. but i don't want to go back to papertape and card punch
:)  Each distribution has its own packages and libraries and
capabilities.  I never would have thought that resolving missing bits
depended on the distribution .. oh my.  A package is a package .. and
should be complete.

Linux as a os may be great (and i am sure from my readings and study
that it is MUCH better than Windows) but the Heinz 47 flavours of
distributions cause many issues.

This is another big problem.  IF Linux can't do all the things that
windows does then why should one change?  Although watching movies is
not critical to my work I do travel a lot and I watch dvds on my
laptop both while i work late or just to watch.

Heck .. even Macs can play dvds.

    I think it's that you ask 8 people and get 10 different answers.

    That's true. But, it's how the distribution handles the packages that
changes.

    Some distributions aim toward business users, others toward home or casual
users, still others toward the dedicated geek. Since we don't know what you
need or want, we can only suggest. It's your choice. Or, as John is doing,
install a bunch and see which you like.

    Then, of course, you have to decide on how to manage X. You want a
Microsoft-like appearance? Try KDE or Gnome. Want something simpler? Try
Xfce. Want just window managers? Try ..., well, there are just so many!

    See? This is what I meant about too many choices. :-) When you find one you
like, life will return to simplicity. But, don't expect this to occur
shortly.

    Perhaps you shouldn't. Many of us don't like the things that Winduhs does.
You can play DVDs to your heart's content with xmms, xine, and a bunch of
other stuff.

As others have pointed out, you may find a more end-user friendly
distro like Ubuntu works better.  However, if you're still interested
in FC4, I suggest you read the Unofficial Fedora FAQ over at
fedorafaq.org, in particular the parts about yum, the Livna
repositories, and DVDs.

Just one recommendation. 
I recently tried the latest release of UBUNTU and I have to say.... WOW!
This dist is the first viable linux desktop I have seen. 
The advantages for newcomers to linux are:
1) The synaptic package manager. It makes it easy to search and install
almost any package. And when I say almost any package I mean it. I
expected to have to build alot of apps from source, but to my surprise
and delight they were in the repos at ubuntu. I was always a big debian
fan but hated using apt(Probably because I never took the time to learn
it.). I liked the ease of use with Yum on Fedora. Being able to use
wildcards when installing etc. But synaptic makes my life much easier...
2) Its Debian based! Havent had any problems yet with installing debian
packages. And of course it has the stability and reliability of Debian! 
3) Minimalist installation. Why open yourself to trouble until you
really need to? Ubuntu installs a very bare minimum install and the
server install is even more trim. I love it! However the fact that the
firewall is installed but not running off the get go is a little
troubling. Sound, but troubling. Novices can install firestarter or the
likes. others can throw in their favorite iptables script. (one note..
the 'recent' iptables module was misplaced in debian unstable for a
while and was put back in. This means that currently ubuntu is missing
the 'recent' module but it will be back in soon per their bug list...)

I would recommend trying this distro if you are having growing pains
with others... It makes converting alot easier!!!
 
Hope this helps...
JM

yes .. and i will spend the day downloading then installing ..

BUT .. not all distros work with hardware.  I used Fedora 4 because it
is known to work with HP Laptops (specifically the zd8000 line).  Wait
.. there is another problem .. Linux doesn't work on all or even most
boxes.  And a distro that works on one doesn't necessarily work on
another.

Now I understand that until there is more market driven requirements
HW manufacturers wont do anything about linux .. so it is a Catch 22.

But as i have said in other replies i will try a couple other distros

Jason,

Sorry, I wasn't looking to spread FUD. But I cannot compile my kernel (unbder
/usr/src/linux) on RH ES 4 EL WITH the kernel dev package installed (That
replaced .srcs.rpm from rh 3). I simply want to compile the kernel with AGPGART
as a module instead of having it built-in. I can't even do a make modules
without an error. I know there is some other way to build modules, since back
in August I was able to do it. Of course I didn't write it down...

I can also tell you, as I work for a major software vendor who has
proprietary (non-GPL) source in the rh kernel, that redhat does have some
proprietary source in their kernel. I'm not necessarily sure that's the resaon
you can't just go into the kernel tree and run make though. I imagine it has
more to do with not wanting to support every homegrown kernel between here and
Gentoo. But since this is my laptop, I'm not worried about being supported.

After further investigatiopn it appears that I may need a kernel tree under
/usr/src/redhat/BUILD, which is where I probably did the make modules. So, like
Steve said, it's not broken...

I need to correct myself. The kernel-devel packages replaced kernel-sources,
rather than the .src.rpm.

That is because kernel-devel does not replace the kernel src.rpm.  It
replaces kernel-source for building third-party modules.  Redhat
basically decided that most users don't need to 100 MB kernel source
while 13 MB of headers is sufficient for building third-party modules.

The complete source used to build the kernel rpm's is in the src.rpm. 
It has the kernel tarball   To build you own kernel manually, you can
do 'rpmbuild -bp' which will unpack the tarball and apply the patches.
 Then you can do into the /usr/src/rpm/BUILD directory and see the
unpacked sources.

This is false.  All the sources for the redhat kernel is in the
src.rpm.  In fact, it is available to anyone on ftp.redhat.com.  The
basis is a kernel 2.6.9 tarball.  As far as everyone else is aware,
all the patches are GPL.  The src.rpm builds the binary kernel.  In
fact, Centos and others use the src.rpm to build their distributions.

Just as a point of order.... Linux isn't an operating system, it's a
kernel.  Linux plus the userspace tools provided by the Distribution
vendor makes an OS.

Actually, with a bit of work any piece of hardware that works on one
distro will work on any other distro.  Hardware is controlled by the
kernel... and it's Linux all around.  :-)

then it is linux's fault <G> (the kernel that is) I should be able to
take any distro and install without any problems .. Fedora 4 loads
with no problems .. SUSE stops. So if they are using the same kernel
it should work .. right.  Nope .. there is the probing sw there is the
install sw that uses the probing sw .. and on it goes.

Now you may ask why it stops and get out your propeller and try to
figure it out .. but i gave all that up years ago.  I want it to load.
work and let me work.  Every hour spent trying to get it to work is an
hour of non-billable time.

But I will try a couple of other distros and see what happens. Not a
big deal either way. If it doesn't work then i will just stay with
bill .. I get "open source" either that way and still support the
community. And if i can't bill i can't support anyone <G>

 thanks again

Only if you can install the OS far enough to recompile the kernel.  If
the default kernel won't install the OS, then its time to look for
another.

FWIW, I've had more success with Debian than any other installer, but
only because the Debian installer allows you to take control of just
about every aspect of the installation process.  This installer is not
good for newbies, but the defaults should get most systems up and
running.

Subject: [PLUG] grub vs. lilo
Message-ID: <4366F436.6090009@comcast.net>

Greetings to all on a fine Halloween.

    Ever since Mandrake 8, I have been running lilo as a bootloader. It 
was the default for a Mandrake install. It worked, so I left it alone. I 
ran across a cool command-line switch that helped me boot to winders 
whenever I wanted to do some "A list" gaming.

    Then, about two months ago, I loaded Ubuntu-linux and was caught a 
little off guard by it's insistence for installing grub. Naturally, my 
nifty little windows reboot script broke. "Oh well," I thought, "I bet 
there is a way of doing this in grub."

    Alas, my chagrin has been extended by my inability to find a way to 
emulate the "-R" switch for lilo in grub.

    I haven't been able to find anything in the Ubuntu forums of any 
great use. I have tried many suggestions that they have had. All to no 
avail.

    Even google hasn't been it's usual useful self.

Is there a way to be able to 
"simply-hit-a-button-on-the-desktop-and-boot-into-windows" using grub?

recompile the kernel .. i am sorry but i gave up that with the other
childish toys of my youth <G>

I love to play with stuff .. but usually it is how to may my apps the
best apps they can be .. how to bring new features to users and how to
create new 'tools' in the environment for developers.

It isn't to spend lots of time recompiling kernels for searching for
missing bits of an application someone has placed out there.  <g>

When you grap an XP disk or server 2003 disk .. you stuff it in ..
press the button and off you go.  Oh yeah .. you have to know what
region you are in but other than that  .. BANG BIFF POW you have a
system that knows EVERYTHING about your hardware.

I love to hear the 'recompile kernel' bit <G>

Now i know that Linux isn't there yet (kernel or os or distro or ..
pick your definition) and am ok with a bit of blood on the finger
nails and a waste of a lot of time.  But I wonder if it will change
when all the mails i have gotten do not critically look at Linux ..
(kernel, distro, os or what ever) and see what need to be done about
making it a more acceptable solution.

but keep them coming .. i am looking forward to the time that someone
really steps back and says .. oh my .. the emperor really doesn't have
any cloths on .. and it isn't Bill <G>

With modules you do not necessairly need to recompile the kernel. You 
can theoretically just compile the module and load it - it's almost as 
easy as using a prepackaged driver (BTW, when places start releasing 
drivers with better wrappers, it could be as easy to install drivers as 
it is on Windows).

A lot of us have felt this way about windows for a LONG time now.  Let

Message-ID: <1130823206.3131.3.camel@badger.had1.or.comcast.net.>

Ok, running Debian ( etch ) at home. This is just sort of a _general_
question;

If I install sendmail from apt-get, and then spamassassin from apt-get,
does sendmail then use spamassassin?

Is this answer pretty much the same across the board? Ie, if I apt-get
apache2 and then apt-get php5 and then apt-get mysql4, will I be able to
write my LAMP applications using this setup, or is there something I'll
have to configure or compile?

-Russ

It should work. The best way to check is to try it out. It has been my 
experience that it will configure it to use what's there, but sometimes 
it may take minimal tweaking.
