Maybe the subject line could have been, "Linux 
documentation, a training ground for engineers learning to 
write well".

While slogging through Linux documentation (sic, or should 
that be sick ;<), I've been recalling what the chairman of 
the freshman English program said of my writing ability 50 
years ago - "Hopeless".

What is the feasibility of editing current first time 
installer documentation as a semester (or longer) project? 
I'm thinking this could could be done with either high 
school seniors or college freshmen.

Comments? TIA

   Two truisms that might actually be true are that scientists make poor
programmers (see old FORTRAN code) and that programmers can't write good
documentation. The latter may come from being too close to the application.

   There's no reason why any of us cannot clean up and clarify documentation
for any open source tool ... including the OS. I've done this on several of
the critical applications I use (e.g., LyX, GRASS) and no one's offended by
my offerings.

   Unfortunately, poor writing skills are endemic in the broader business
world, too. And let's not go into the results of our local school systems
...

In my transcription work I find many occasions where there is evidence 
of change in spoken English (I think that's how John would think of it 
-- I think of it as people who don't know the correct usage). For 
example, it appears that the article "an" is no long used by many 
people. And the understanding of when to use "take" versus "bring" seems 
to have been lost. I suspect this general change in spoken English is 
contributing to the quality issue in written documentation.

When I have some free time, I'd consider contributing some of it to a 
documentation editing effort. Is there a proper way to do this? Does it 
vary from program to program? Does one simply take some sentences that 
should be shot and rehabilitate them and offer them to the keeper of the 
documentation? And how does one find out who the keeper of the 
documentation is?

Dick,

   Each application varies. A look at the Web site may tell you there is a
documentation project associated with it. If not, an e-mail to the devs can
point you in the right direction. I've not found a project that rejects
help. :-)

One of my pet peeves is the use of an ellipsis to end a sentence
instead of a period. :)

The use of 'a' before a word starting with a consonant (pronounced
[??], with the glottal stop instead of [n]) is simply a historical
development in a particular dialect. In fact, Anglo-Saxon had no
articles at all. The present day indefinite article developed from a?n
'one' (that's a? with a macron, denoting a doubled vowel). 
Prescriptivists have succeeded in proscribing this pronunciation so
well that people with this dialect are considered uneducated and not
fit for polite company. 

As for 'take' and 'bring,' what you complain of is nothing more than
semantic drift, a diachronic change that has always existed in all
languages and always will. The favorite example of semantic drift is
the English 'black,' which many, including me, believe is
derived from a word that originally meant 'white.' Cf the Oxford
English Dictionary:

Etymology:  Cognate with Middle Dutch blac ink, Old Saxon blac ink
(Middle Low German blak ink, black dye, black colour), Old High German
blah- (only in blah-faro of the colour of ink, blah-m?l niello
decoration (Middle High German blach-m?l ), blah-m?l?n to decorate with
niello); further etymology uncertain; on formal grounds the word could
be from a base related to the Germanic bases of blank adj. and the
various forms discussed at blik v., but since this would give an
expected meaning ?shining, white? there is an obvious semantic
difficulty; many have sought to resolve this by hypothesizing that the
word meaning ?black? originated as a past participle (with the meaning
?burnt, blackened?) of a verb meaning ?to burn (brightly)? derived from
this base; this verb may perhaps be reflected by Middle Dutch blaken
(Dutch blaken) to flame, to burn.

Professor Susan Conrad of the PSU Department of Applied Linguistics
(together with others) has been instrumental in developing classes
designed to teach English academic writing. So far most of the effort
has been targeted at foreign students, but she has also worked to teach
English writing skills to engineers (her husband is an engineer). If
anyone is interested in developing classes to teach skills in writing
computer documentation she would be a good contact person.

   Academic writing is not necessarily a desired outcome. It's too often
written by academics for other academics and frequently intended to show off
the writer's superiority. Similar to legalese designed to obfuscate ideas so
one is required to pay a lawyer (by the hour, too) to translate it so it's
understandable to those not in the guild.

   Clear and effective writing can be learned. I used to write long, complex
sentences (that was the style taught until a very few decades ago). When I
escaped academia I had to teach myself how to write short, clear, effective
sentences. Frequently, my first editing pass turned one sentence into three
new ones that were much clearer.

   Application developers cannot write good documentation because they know
exactly what's going on under the hood, how things are supposed to work, and
how they designed the application to be used. Give the application to an end
user and watch what they do. That elucidates how he sees the application and
is quite frequently completely different from how the developer sees it.

I guess my writing skills failed me here. I was trying to point out
that if one can teach academic writing one can teach any kind of
writing. It's just a question of defining the target.

The engineers have exactly the same problem. And the classes Professor
Conrad developed have been successful in making them much better
writers of technical documents required in their field. In fact, their
basic problem was not in communicating with other engineers, but in
expressing themselves in writing to the public and non-engineer
government officials. That sounds to me like exactly the same problem
that software developers have in writing documentation.

Or to look at it another way, some software developers are able to
write effective documentation. How do they do it when (apparently) the
majority of software developers do a lousy job of documenting their
software? Susan Conrad is into discourse analysis, and she would use
the tools of that discipline to extract the methods used by successful
writers of software documentation. While I agree that discourse analysis
would be a good approach, I would start by just asking the successful
writers how they do it.

Will Brian be able to explain how to shrink a partition inside a

I took the plunge and upgraded Kubuntu from 11.10 to 12.04.  So far, the 
only malfunction I can find in the process is RadioTray using the wrong

I know where the proper icon resides, just haven't figured out how to

Message-ID: <CAJeYwHfaum4OBXCQCNwgrkW=d42-U81y3VEyybfbvJ5RVf170w@mail.gmail.com>

I have noticed that my Ubuntu 12.04 linux system is not correctly
logging a timestamp while writing to a flat csv file.  Occasionally
the timestamps will have a backwards glitch, such as

34817.57976
34817.00157
34819.37487

(values are in seconds + decimal fraction)

If the middle value of 34817.00157 is changed to 34818.00157 then
things are okay.  This error occasionally happens about once per
thousand timestamps and always appears to be right when the time has
rolled to the next second.

I am using the sys/time.h header and compiled C code with the -lrt
(real time library) but the _tp struct is acting like the tv_sec did
NOT get updated when the tv_nsec rolled over > 10e9.

I am also running a ntp client, but just now enabled the loopstats
option in the ntp.conf file.  I believe ntpd is running just fine.

Could ntp be making minor adjustments to system time?  Or should I
look somewhere else?

This timestamp problem needs to be fixed before I can move to other
pressing problems.

Any ideas?

What function are you calling to fill the _tp struct?  Where is this
struct defined?

Message-ID: <CAJeYwHdOJCCgctXO0rDtJivStLFkH_MZMkgPBa3okEB-vFrwSQ@mail.gmail.com>

Okay, I found the problem, it was actually caused by the true time
(NIST) being just right to cause the seconds digit to increment
between two time calls that I made

First  I did a time(_tp) call first to get time in the customary hr :
min : sec format.
then did a second call to clock_gettime(_tv) in order to get 2 long
words for the time tv_sec and tv_nsec.

The amount of time between the 2 calls coincided with the time change
on the seconds, as it apparently took about 2 to 4 milleseconds
between these 2 calls.

I am going to have to take only one time call to clock_gettime(_tv)
and then figure out how to get the normal hrs:min:secs.decimal from
those 2 values.

Thanks Galen for your question, but I have resolved the issue now,
after dumping both types of time into an archive file and watching the
time stamping going on.

I'd be happy to talk about that.  The answer is that it's either pretty easy
or usually impossible, depending on what file system you're using.

Sadly, at the last minute I will not be able to attend tonight's
meeting. 

Shrinking the partition is not a critical matter. I'll figure it out
later. 

As for the filesystem, it is a bit confusing. When I look at the disk
with Palimpsest it says the drive (320 GB) is ext3. But it is divided
into two partitions, 6 GB and 314 GB. It says the 6 GB is swap and the
314 GB is ext4. I'm pretty sure it is ext4. I have no idea where
Palimpsest gets the notion that the drive itself is ext3.

Subject: [PLUG] Surge Protector Ratings
Message-ID: <504A0561.7020006@comcast.net>

We bought a used TV yesterday from a couple of brothers getting their 
business started. They recommended that we get a surge protector rated 
for 3200 joules. Their point was that ordinary surge protectors wear out 
quickly, and after catching one or two surges are no longer able to 
catch the next big one that comes along. I Googled and found that there 
are such beasts, starting around $20 on Amazon. The one I looked at is 
18" x 6" x 2" and has 10 outlets, hence the mention of beasts. I don't 
find a joule rating on any of the surge protectors we have in the house.

So, the question is, are they correct? Are all the surge protectors in 
the house probably shot? Is a rating of 3200 joules necessary?

I've heard this before, but never any evidence to substantiate it. I think
the most salient point for us is that we don't get a lot of surges in our
area. We're not exactly a hotbed for lightning and the BPA has things
pretty well regulated.

Good points. I guess the next question is how can you tell if an older

Plug in sensitive equipment, and then hit it with surges until it
stops working.  Then you know the surge protector doesn't work
anymore.

Portland Linux/Unix Group Advanced Topics Meeting Announcement

Who: Beth Flanagan, Intel
What: Embedded Linux and GPL compliance
Where: Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th Avenue, Portland (Left Entrance)
When: Tuesday, September 18th, 2012 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of awesome, open technologies.

Embedded Linux and GPL compliance. How not to make a mess of things.

As Linux becomes more and more common in the consumer device market,
the number of GPL violations found by various compliance
organizations have increased dramatically. We'll discuss how
violations occur, what to do if you find yourself in violation and how
the Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded-Core helps you to avoid a costly
GPL violation action.


Beth 'pidge' Flanagan is the maintainer of the licensing
infrastructure for the Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded-Core, maintainer
of the yocto-autobuilder and build and release engineer for the Yocto
Project. She has spoken on a wide range of topics over the years, from
GPL compliance in the embedded world to open source firearms. She
works full time on the Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded-Core for Intel's
Open Source Technologies Center.


Many will break for the Lucky Lab on Hawthorne afterwards.

I replace surge protectors once they've been hit.  I don't know of any way to determine that they are still good, and they are not expensive.

How do you determine that they have been hit? Short of a lightning strike, it's not like a power surge announces itself.

Message-ID: <00fb01cd8d54$05ed27d0$11c77770$@com>

This computer's power jack is does not work.

My daughter says it can get power briefly if she wiggles it a lot.

I've tried to take it apart but can't figure out how to get the two halves
to release.

I did get it open enough to see that the molded brackets holding the jack
had broken allowing the jack to slide back into the case when attempting to
insert the power plug.  I wedged some paper behind the jack to prevent it
from retreating but still no power.

I believe that the jack has probably broken one of its power leads and needs
to be re-soldered.

Any recommendations as to where/who I can turn to would be greatly
appreciated.

   When I needed laptop repairs in the past I took them to Northwest Computer

Subject: [PLUG] detecting flaky drives with LVM
Message-ID: <20120908025937.GA5140@gate.kl-ic.com>

Brian Martin gave an (as always) excellent talk about LVM
Thursday night.  As I get older and more cynical, I look at
software that seems very nice and wonder "what happens if
this goes wrong?  How do I debug it?"

My concerns about LVM are about rapidly dealing with mistakes
and hardware failure in stressful situations (ever had a 
laptop drive go flaky 4 hours before a presentation?  And
successfully copied the presentation to a live spare with
minutes to spare?).  Brian gave the example of moving data
from a failed drive to a working drive in the same volume
group.  But if all you have for checking data integrity is
fsck at the file system level, and a file system is spread
across many drives in a volume group, how do you tell
which block errors correspond to which drive - quickly?  

For those of us with file systems smaller than the largest
drives available, there is something to be said for buying
a drive that is 3x larger than the current data set, and
buying a new and larger drive when we fill the current drive
to 80% or more.  For those of us using laptops, adding a
second drive usually isn't practical.  So for many situations,
LVM doesn't sound practical.   OTOH, if one needs a 20TB file
system on a server class machine, and assuming there are simple
ways to identify starting-to-fail drives, then LVM sounds great.

I run Redhat-derived distros, but bypass the default LVM setup
of the disks and use bare metal partitions instead.  It sounds 
like I should keep doing that until I cannot fit my system on
one drive.

Unless it has an LED or other indicator of unknown veracity the only
thing that might tip you off it's bad is if the power strip is warmer
than ambient temperature. If it is get rid of it ASAP.

One more thought, having glimpsed photo 1 at the link above again --
get a power strip with a metal case. Hopefully nothing in the rest of
the article contradicts this advice, but it sure seems like a little
more insurance to notice it's getting hot before igniting the case, if
that's the failure mode. :)

Not to insult anyone's intelligence but are you sure it's not the
power cable? Trying a spare charger could save a lot of time & money
just to be sure.

I've fixed several laptops with intermittent charging issues and only
one had a bad jack. The cables haven't looked like there was anything
amiss before cutting the end off and soldering on a new connector.

You could verify the charger output with a voltmeter while wiggling
the cable near the connector. Best done with three or four hands.

Good luck.

That is likely the problem, I've seen a few laptops fail that
way.  I use docking stations around the house and office, so
I don't wear out the power and ethernet jacks.  

I don't know whether Gateway puts hardware manuals online 
anywhere - one of the advantages of IBM and Lenovo Thinkpads
is that the manuals are (or at least were) available.  If worst
comes to shove, you might learn how the IBMs come apart and do
the same for your Gateway (hint - keep very careful track of
the parts!).  Laptops are held together with about a zillion
screws, so it takes a while to disassemble and reassemble
(assuming you carefully keep track of each part).  That
suggests that a repair outfit will charge a lot to do so.
To get at it, you will probably remove the keyboard first
(screws on the bottom) then the top bezel that surrounds it. 
Sometimes the power connectors are buried pretty deeply,
sometimes they are accessable with just the bezel removed.

I've used acsparts.com for replacement parts, but they are 
offline right now.  A web search reveals this $29 "refurb"
(ha!) part:

http://www.ebay.com/itm/NEW-GATEWAY-50-WJ802-010-NV53-NV59-AC-DC-IN-POWER-JACK-CABLE-HARNESS-WIRE-CJ50-/110692593697

That looks like the right cable - and you are in luck, because
you aren't replacing a whole board.  That ebay part ships from
New York.  It is cheaper direct from China, but add another week
for shipping.  Things are more complicated if you also broke
some case plastic.  

If you are ambitious, and with some hints from Thinkpad and HP
hardware maintenance manuals, you might be able to figure out
how to fix your laptop for $6+ and a lot of careful work. 
Since this failure is quite common, I suggest you buy TWO cables
and keep a spare around.  That might also be a good idea if you
take the laptop to a repair shop - they may still charge an arm
and a leg to fix your laptop, but you will have the part they
need to do so, saving some time and avoiding a refurb part.

Good luck.  I like fixing my own hardware, but that isn't for
everyone.  You don't own laptops, you borrow them from the
repair shop, so it is wise to develop a good relationship
with whoever repairs it for you.

My daughter's looking for a new netbook.  It'll run Ubuntu because
they have the best support for her adopted language Catalan (and
because she grew up in a Linux household. :-) I'm happy with my
Samsung, but it's three years old.  Looking now there's a dizzying
array of model numbers and specs and nothing helpful under google
searches like "best netbook for ubuntu".

Anybody running Ubuntu (or other linux) on a recently purchased
netbook and delighted with it?  What's the model and where'd you get
it?  BTW, her preference is for something closer to 10" than 14".

Thanks,

Look here for a list of Ubuntu Certified netbooks:
 http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/desktop/models/?release=12.04%20LTS&category=Netbook<http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/desktop/models/?release=12.04%20LTS&category=Netbook>
Here is a list of netbooks with user submitted details about ubuntu
support: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport/Machines/Netbooks

I would recommend bringing a USB drive with a live image of Ubuntu on it
and test it out on the display models in the store. I have done this on
several occasions and so long as you ask permission first, I have never had
anyone complain. In fact, I have found a number of employees that have used
linux and were either helpful or at least interested in what I was doing.

my wife has a System76 Startling that we both love, but alas they don't 
make anything in that size range (7" screen) any more.

My next laptop will likely be a System76 or a ZaReason. ZaReason offers 
a 10" display in their Teo Pro, but unfortunately (like the little model 
from Asus) it tops out a 2GB ram.

For a netbook running Linux, I would think 2GB was way more than enough.
It's not like you can really expect to run Gimp on 30 megapixel images.
or a huge MySQL server :-)

LVM on a single disk still has its benefits.  It's nice to be able to
re-allot drive space amongst partitions when you find out down the
road that your initial assumptions were faulty.  LVM is also handy if
you plan on implementing full-disk encryption and only wish to deal
with one key for all of your drive's partitions.

I've had some _occasional_ problems replying to *THIS* list.
If I send To:

I do not believe I've ever seen a problem.

However, if I hit "Reply" and the "To:" comes up as
General Linux/UNIX discussion and help; civil and on-topic

I generally get a error message.

Some experimentation suggests the semicolon is the culprit.

Hello everyone, I'd like to introduce myself. I'm a Perl/PostgreSQL

Last Thursday, I subscribed to this list and went to my first PLUG meeting.  
Sorry for being a little bit of a know-it-all blowhard -- I'm taking pills 
for it. :D Even so, I learned a lot about LVM and enjoyed a lot of good

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1209101717170.28452@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   The hard drive in an external case I used for system backups appeared to
fail with I/O errors. I replaced it with a new WD hard drive (sent as a
warranty replacement months ago), and WD replaced the failed drive.

   Only a few weeks later, I'm seeing the same errors on the new drive. One
day last week the console was filled with journal recovery errors. The next
few days everything worked just fine. This morning's report of the dirvish
backup cron job showed that 3 of the 6 partitions were backed up, then the
process failed:

   Just now I tried mounting the drive to see if I could figure out what's

   I've had very good experiences with WD drives over the years. To have
issues with two of them in the same role after a couple of years of flawless
operation is highly unusual.

   Your advice, suggestions, and recommendations are needed. I want to get my
nighly backups running reliably again. If it's the iMicro enclosure (with a
USB2 connection and separate power supply), suggest an alternative. If it's
a software issue, advise me on how to resolve it or further diagnose what's
going on.

Rich,

Check your cables, pull and reinsert them a couple of times.  The 5 volt 
signal levels can degrade after years because of corrosion and relaxing 
contact pressure.  The cable may be broken.  Somewhere it goes over a 
sharp edge and gets pulled.  I have tripped over cables and caused 
failures.  As a sysadmin I seen weirder stuff.

I concur.  I had something similar happen with a WD Passport USB2 
powered drive.  The short USB cable started to go at the micro-USB 
connector to the drive.  All sorts of errors as it was wiggled during 
use - and it was about 2 years old.  Also, in my case the micro-USB 
connecter, also getting worn/loose,  is soldered to the drive PCB.  The 
case is just a protective enclosure.  As a "road warrior" my portable 
electronics takes quite a beating!

I am not familiar with your iMicro enclosure, but the main failure points:

1.  bad USB cable or connectors
2.  USB connector on the drive enclosure.
3.  bad power cable, connectors
4.  bad case electronics - if the drive is SATA or PATA, there will be a 
small PCB to convert that to USB and to route the DC power.

Since this is your second drive, I would try a new compatible enclosure 
and new cables.

Ed,

   Gotcha'. Will do. I cannot believe the WD drives are failing when the
common factor is the enclosure.

   A visit to ENU this afternoon should eliminate this possibility.

Thanks all!

Sadly, there are many poorly designed bridge chipsets in external
enclosures.  Linux adheres to standards, and goes fast.  Windows
is slower, and often has tweaks or vendor-supplied drivers that
are nonstandard, but patch over flaws in the chipsets.

I had similar problems with some brands of USB2-to-IDE enclosures,
years ago.  See http://wiki.dirvish.org/USB2Drives  

I can only speculate why, but perhaps the interface chip designer
did not put in enough buffering between the clock domain of the
drive and the clock domain of the USB interface.  A small fraction
of the data transfers will line up wrong, and some of the bits of
a byte will transfer on clock cycle N and some on clock cycle N+1.
There are known ways to add buffering to reduce this problem to
infinitesimal error rates, but many inept digital designers don't
know about them, or how to do the analysis and the testing.  

Rsync-based dirvish keeps hard drives very busy.  So does an
external "write a lot / read a lot " program, which might be a
good way to test out the enclosures and their interface chips
without risking your backups.

Different kernels may have different error recovery behavior;
some smart USB driver programmer might add a retry patch for
one version of the kernel, and a subsequent clueless programmer
might improve average performance by a fraction of a percent in
a subsequent driver by taking the patch back out again.  Sadly,
there is a lot of "cruelty free" (untested) design out there.

So, find out what chipset the enclosure uses with "lsusb", and
try an enclosure with a different chipset, and report your 
findings here and on the dirvish wiki.  Sometimes, the only
way to deal with this stuff is to carefully document our
problems on the web so our Linux brethren can avoid them.

   Moot. I just ordered a Vantec NexStar 3 3.5" IDE to USB 2.0 External Hard
Drive Enclosure from newegg.com. It was the only one to show 5 stars (based
on 160 reviews). They describe the bright blue case as a positive; I'd
prefer black but as long as it works I don't care.

   Not sure how to test it for the dirvish wiki other than to use it. If you
have suggestions, Keith, please share them with me.

  I happen to have one of those Alcor hubs in a box: it a USB 1.1 
device, and it is crap. A really cheap discount chipset often included 
in many device or computer cases to provide a extra usb exposed SD card 
etc ports on the motherboard.  Crap.  I say toss it.

$ lsusb | grep Alcor
Bus 004 Device 004: ID 058f:9254 Alcor Micro Corp. Hub
$ lsusb -vd 058f:9254 |grep USB
Couldn't open device, some information will be missing
  bcdUSB               1.10

As opposed to a desktop/laptop drive IDE to USB adapter I use:

Ed,

   So, the Alcor is the external hard drive enclosure. I ordered a
replacement from Newegg that was highly rated by users. It'll get here in a
few days.

They've done this before on Clinic day - I do not remember any
major problems, and they may appreciate our presence as guinea
pigs and beta testers.  

But that is my memory - without a parity bit.  If your memory
(RAM, Disk, or neuronal) is also getting flakey, bring your 
machine and brain down to the Linux clinic and we will fsck and
brainck to clear the cobwebs.  We will erase your nightmarish
digital memories of Windows, replacing them with linux on
your disk and linux skills in your head.

The clinic meets at Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th, 3 blocks south of
Hawthorne,  every third sunday from 1 pm to 5 pm.  We have 
wired and wireless ethernet (I hope), keyboards, monitors and
mice, distros, and so-called expert advice based on what little
we can remember from our own linux newbie days.  We may have
coffee, if I don't forget to bring coffee filters.  Forget
about that diet - somebody will probably bring crackers and
cookies, perhaps chocolate.  Remember, gigantic is the new
normal.

Your brain will never be the same.  Ours aren't.

Portland Linux/Unix Group Advanced Topics Meeting Announcement

Who: Beth Flanagan, Intel
What: Embedded Linux and GPL compliance
Where: Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th Avenue, Portland (Left Entrance)
When: Tuesday, September 18th, 2012 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of awesome, open technologies.

Embedded Linux and GPL compliance. How not to make a mess of things.

As Linux becomes more and more common in the consumer device market,
the number of GPL violations found by various compliance
organizations have increased dramatically. We'll discuss how
violations occur, what to do if you find yourself in violation and how
the Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded-Core helps you to avoid a costly
GPL violation action.


Beth 'pidge' Flanagan is the maintainer of the licensing
infrastructure for the Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded-Core, maintainer
of the yocto-autobuilder and build and release engineer for the Yocto
Project. She has spoken on a wide range of topics over the years, from
GPL compliance in the embedded world to open source firearms. She
works full time on the Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded-Core for Intel's
Open Source Technologies Center.


Many will break for the Lucky Lab on Hawthorne afterwards.

To assist the memory functions there will be coffee. I have acquired a
new coffee maker for the Clinic. This one is stainless steel, including
the pot. And the filters that we already have will fit it.

Portland Linux/Unix Group Advanced Topics Meeting Announcement

Who: Beth Flanagan, Intel
What: Embedded Linux and GPL compliance
Where: Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th Avenue, Portland (Left Entrance)
When: Tuesday, September 18th, 2012 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of awesome, open technologies.

Embedded Linux and GPL compliance. How not to make a mess of things.

As Linux becomes more and more common in the consumer device market,
the number of GPL violations found by various compliance
organizations have increased dramatically. We'll discuss how
violations occur, what to do if you find yourself in violation and how
the Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded-Core helps you to avoid a costly
GPL violation action.


Beth 'pidge' Flanagan is the maintainer of the licensing
infrastructure for the Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded-Core, maintainer
of the yocto-autobuilder and build and release engineer for the Yocto
Project. She has spoken on a wide range of topics over the years, from
GPL compliance in the embedded world to open source firearms. She
works full time on the Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded-Core for Intel's
Open Source Technologies Center.


Many will break for the Lucky Lab on Hawthorne afterwards.

Portland Linux/Unix Group Meeting Announcement

Who: Vincent Zimmer, Intel
What: UEFI Secure Boot and Open Source. It's not a 'general war against 
computation.'
Where: PSU, 1930 SW 4th Ave. Room FAB 86-01 (Lower Level)
When: Thursday, October 4th, 2012 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of awesome, open technologies.

See location H-10 on the PSU map at http://pdxLinux.org/campus_map.jpg

As 2012 platform firmware embraces UEFI 2.3.1 and ACPI5.0 support, the 
ability to interoperate with UEFI Secure Boot is imperative. This poses 
a unique challenge for open software that may not come pre-installed on 
the platform. With UEFI Secure Boot, though, infrastructure has been put 
in place to preserve openness, owner choice and control in addition to 
mitigating concerns of malware targeting the platform. This talk will 
provide a history of UEFI Secure Boot, an overview of the 
implementation, deployment practices, and details on the engagement with 
the open source community.

Vincent Zimmer is a Principal Engineer with Intel Corporation. He has 
been working on various platform, networking, trusted computing and 
security technologies around EFI since 1999 and platform firmware since 
1992. Vincent has spoken in various forums on this topic, co-authored 3 
books, 10 papers, and several specifications in this area.

(a) I run chrome a lot and am generally happy with it. not enough to make
it my exclusive browser. not sure that could ever be the case.

(b) those are just examples.

(b.1) not _specifically_ specific, but you "should" be able to compile
Chrome (or Chromium) to work on pretty much any distro out there. it just
depends on how much work you are willing to put into it, vs how much work
it will take to get it to compile and run.

that's the beauty of linux!

I, and seemingly others have had it rupture under high load on Mac OS X. 
Lots of pages, lots of tabs. Not a good practice often necessary.

Hello all,

Here's an update on the PLUG server/services move:

OSU-OSL is out.
PSU is out.
Free Geek is out and is reconsidering their own options.

NYC*BUG (New York City *BSD User's Group) is in, but obviously isn't 
very Portland-y.

Can anyone suggest other no-question-they-can-do-it-and-WILL-do-it options?

Key criteria:

1. Free of charge
2. Staying power
3. Basic security updates
4. Multiple humans

Quite a few of us could host it but it should be trusted to an entity 
with multiple points of contact and administrators. NYC*BUG would meet 
all of those requirements but something local would also be a plus.

I talked to the folks at Peak Internet Services and they are willing to
sponsor the site.


Talk to

And he will get you set up with a web service for PLUG.

Let me know if there is anything that I can do that will make this work
better.

Integra Telecom hosts one of our Personal Telco boxes.  That all
happened before I got involved, so I'm not sure who you would talk to
about it.  There is a colo out near OGI (where Integra came from)
where there is a "community" rack (or that's what it was once
called).

Our other box is hosted by Stephouse Networks.  I can't speak for them
and their willingness or physical capacity to host PLUG, but they were
very nice to PTP (clearly, because we are awesome).  Stephouse is in
the Pittock Building.  Particularly topical since I was just there
fixing a boot problem (supergrub CD, yay!) after a RAID1 disk
failure.

Stephouse is very Portland-y.

A small update:

Peak sounds just fine, albeit in a Corvallis-y way. :)

Integra's PBX dropped my call and a redial gave me a very noisy line. 
Waited awhile on the third try but gave up. Gotta work on that.

Stephouse quickly escalated me to a tech and the lead techs will get 
back to me soon. One tech wears his PTP t-shirt now and then...

They support mailman, that is where I have my lists.
They also have majordomo, but are wishing people would switch.

So I believe they have all the tools that you need.

I look forward to seeing how it goes.

I highly recommend it.

It's been my primary browser for close to three years - no significant
problems, and I find Firefox frustratingly slow and counter intuitive
on the occasions I've gone back (usually to test something, or get
around a rare user agent check).

I wish there were a long-term support version, though.

Message-ID: <867grnotsa.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


After the excellent presentation on LVM by Brian at PLUG earlier this
month, and after our recent disk failure/recovery this week, I was
working on reorganizing our PVs.  I had created a new pv on a new
RAID1 array (md5) and was loving the idea of moving the logical
volumes over from (md4, on a single-disk degraded RAID1 array) to the
new array, with pvmove.  So, I made some backups of files using rsync,
and this morning after that had finished, I fired off:

 # pvmove -v -i10 /dev/md4

And it commenced to, I presume, do the right thing.  After about 17%,
I got some messages (which regrettable I did not preserve) about
suspending (??) the pvmove, and my connection to the machine froze
(done remotely over the network, no console available).  A few hours
later, I got down to the colo and looked at the console.  There was a
login prompt, which I could type at, but I never got a password
prompt.  So, I rebooted and it came back up fine, but the pvmove had
clearly not succeeded.  Googling about, I found this, which looks like
what I saw:

  http://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7004393

In brief, it suggests that you don't do a pvmove affecting a logical
volume that holds /var and/or /var/run.  Ouch, and:
WHY-IS-THIS-NOT-IN-A-MUCH-LARGER-FONT???

Has anybody else run into this?

   I need to admit that I'm quite discouraged. The new external case arrived
yesterday and I mounted the new hard drive (that worked for a few days in
the old case) and got everything set up. Still see the same errors:

   This is a new case, new cables, new drive. What am I missing here? It's
been about 3 weeks with no daily backups and I really need to get this
working once again.

What distribution and what version of kernel and lvm?  Based on my
searches, I think it should be possible, but it looks like there are
multiple opportunities for deadlocks.

Rich,

Does fdisk see the drive?  Can it read the partition table?  If yes,
you could try mounting the drive using one of the spare superblocks
using the "sb=n" option to mount.  My first inclination, though, would
be to run fsck on that partition.  It sounds to me like your old case
or cables must have trashed something on your new drive, and you need
to clean that up.  Given that mount can't find the first superblock,
you'll probably need to provide e2fsck with the block number of one of
the spares (the -b option).  For example,

    # e2fsck -b 8193 -fpC 0 /dev/sdb1

will use the spare superblock at 8193, force (-f) e2fsck to run, and
give you a pretty progress bar (-C 0) while it "preens" (-p) the
partition.  You want the -f option because e2fsck will return without
doing anything if the partition isn't marked as "dirty".

As an aside, since this is a new drive, without much on it, and it's
hooked up via USB, I would seriously consider using ext4 instead of
ext3.  Among its other advantages is that fsck runs far, FAR faster.
I have a 500Gig WD MyBook that I use for backups, attached via USB.
Originally I had it set up with ext3, and it took most of a day to
run.  I switched it over to ext4 and it now runs in about half an
hour.  The first pass through took a long time, since it had to
convert the data structures in the filesystem, but after that it's
been quite speedy.  Since you have little or nothing on the drive, it
shouldn't take long.

Which brings up another thought.  Do you actually have anything on
that drive you want or need to save?  If not, simply reformat it.
Probably the simplest way to go, rather than tearing your hair out
over this.  Again, I'd use an ext4 filesystem, but that's up to you.
(I've heard good things about btrfs, but last I heard it still doesn't
have an fsck.  I refuse to use it until I know I can clean the
filesystem if something goes wrong.  And it it will, guaranteed.
Murphy lives!)

Anyway, I hope this helps, and I wish you luck!

   For the past couple of days I've not been able to connect to my bank's web
site. Running traceroute shows me that once I get to an AT&T server in San
Francisco nothing more happens:

and the attempt stops at 30 hops.

   Is there a way to force the connection to take a different route? I wrote
to all the e-mail addresses at att.net that whois provides. Of course I can
wait for Monday and see if the company plugs in the next step but I'd like
to see if a client wired a payment yesterday.

unfortunately traceroute does not give a reliable indication of the
existence or non-existence of a problem. many routers and other network
devices are configured to drop or otherwise mangle ping and traceroute
traffic. see if your distro's package repository includes a utility named
tcptraceroute, which will more closely resemble the real traffic your web
browser generates and be more likely to represent the path that traffic
takes.

12.122.81.137 is also an AT&T IP, so there's no real useful data here. this
would be more useful if compared to a traceroute from a working machine. if
you provided the bank's URL, more of us could try it and see how our
results compare to yours.

force? short of changing ISPs, no. there are tricks people can do to
"suggest" a router behave differently. these work about as well as voodoo
and hocus pocus. try running a continuous ping to the bank's web server.
try changing the packet sizes larger and smaller.

in my experience AT&T is very unlikely to respond. you may also try
contacting your ISP's support. also unlikely to help.


one other possible idea would be to proxy your traffic through somewhere
else. there are many anonymizing proxies available out there. the downside
of this approach is that the owners of such proxies would then be privy to
your banking info. if you know how, you can proxy through your own server
if you have one. I have a virtual server at SliceHost and use it for this
purpose when needed.

Wes,

   There's only /usr/doc/traceroute-2.0.14/wrappers/tcptraceroute which is a
shell wrapper. Slackbuilds.org does not have a package for tcptraceroute.

   I'm sure it will work for others: https://www.key.com/

   Well, it worked until yesterday afternoon.

   A long time ago I had a proxy set up here; don't know if it's still there.
If so, probably well out of date.

it works for me, and my traceroute stops in approximately the same place:

most likely, it will just start working again soon. could be hours, could
be days. just depends on how long it takes someone to notice the broken
route and fix it.

not sure what else to tell you. maybe run to the library and use one of
their computers to check? or a smartphone if you have one (turn off wifi)?
for some reason I imagine you to be the non-smart-phone type. :)

   Huh! I'm on Frontier copper and they change my IP address 3-45 times per
day.

   I'll wait.  Monday I'll call my banker and she'll look it up for me.

   I have an intelligent phone (Treo 700p with the invaluable Palm PIM), not
a so-called "smart" phone. After seeing what so many users do with these
palm-size computers I'm glad that at least the phone is smart. The
talking/texting drivers are, IMNSHO, quite dumb.

Worked fine for me, that is, the Key Bank login page popped right up
in Firefox. I'm on Comcast in Portland.

You could come over to my house to connect.

   It'll keep. Caught me unawares because I've not had a single-site failure
before. Either access is down to everything or it's up for all

   I read the sudoers man page and look at the examples and still don't grok
how to make a simple entry: I want to allow username 'pamela' to run a shell
script in her home directory as root because the script runs two commands
that need root permission.

   Do I need to set up an alias for this, then assign her to that alias?

   In essence, I'd like something like this in /etc/sudoers:

 	pamela  /home/pamela/shell-scripts/iface.sh root
 	(username)	(command)		    (as root)

A clue would be very nice,

I didn't test these, but I believe the lines are correct.

To do what you want, the line would be:

pamela ALL= /full/path/to/script

However, if you do this, and Pamela were to edit that file, or worse, someone else were to edit that file, and Pamela runs it, the whole thing is running as root, and that could be bad. Add a 'rm -rf /' to the file, and root just wiped out the system. 

I suggest allowing Pamela to run the two commands she needs to as root. Which would look like this:

pamela ALL= /path/to/cmd1,/path/to/cmd2

If you want her to be able to run those two commands without being prompted for a password, put NOPASSWD: in front of the commands:

pamela ALL= NOPASSWD:/path/to/cmd1,/path/to/cmd2

Finally, you'll need to put 'sudo' in front of the command in the script.

Rich,

Cmnd_Alias HERCOMMAND = /home/her/command

Then you can say:
pamela    her_machine=HERCOMMAND

It is almost that simple  or without command alias

pamela her_machine=/home/pamela/first_command /home/pamela/second_command

Russell Johnson beat me to it.  The only thing I could add is to use 
visudo as your editor.

Whatever you do, DO NOT

    sudo vi /etc/sudoers

Do instead

    sudo visudo

With the first, if you make a bad enough mistake in syntax you can
lock yourself out.  With the second, visudo will syntax-check your
changes and give you a chance to exit before committing if there's
a problem.

   A) she's not going to edit the script and 2) no one else has access to her
portable.

   This is not practical because the appropriate commad depends on the

Ken,

   Thanks. The /etc/sudoers file warns that visudo is required. Fortunately,
I know just enough vi to do this. :-)

If you add the script in the sudoers file, then she will have to type 'sudo /path/to/script' to run the script.

If you add the commands that need root to the sudoers file, then the you put sudo in the script, in front of the command.

Shalom

Is the memset below needed?  Stevens says sin_zero is
not used.  Others on the newsgroups say clearing the field
is needed on a few platforms.  I've left the memset in just
to be on the safe side.

sock_type cmw::udp_server (uint32_t port)
{
  sock_type sd = getSocket(SOCK_DGRAM);
  sockaddr_in si_me;
  si_me.sin_family = AF_INET;
  si_me.sin_port = htons(port);
  si_me.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY);
  ::std::memset(&si_me.sin_zero, 0, sizeof(si_me.sin_zero));
  if (::bind(sd, (sockaddr*) &si_me, sizeof(si_me))==-1) {
    throw failure("udp Bind errno: ") << GetError();
  }
  return sd;

I don't like Comcast's business paractices and I have heard horror

Are folks here using CenturyLink or Centurytel (which used to be Qwest.)
How is there dervice to Linux users?

Similar situation for me: CenturyLink/Qwest for > 10 yrs, local Easystreet
as my ISP, got a deal on the ActionTec modem from Qwest, it's old but
functional.

Qwest's customer support was abysmally awfully terribly horrid. Easystreet
is great, they've even helped diagnose obscure incompatibilities between a
prior DSL modem and a cheap ethernet switch in out outbuilding. Haven't
had to deal with CenturyLink yet.

My biggest complaint is the telco's apparent unwillingness to upgrade
their copper - i keep getting breathless promotions about 7mbps service,
but my queries into when i'll have anything above 1.5 go into a black
hole. Still, it's less offensive than having Comcast's tendrils in my
house.

Likewise for me, I've had CenturyLink/Qwest for many years now.  A
standalone DSL line from them and Infinity Internet (iinet.com) for my
ISP.
I believe they're based in Vancouver (WA) but have a colo'd datacenter in
Portland.  Have had good luck with both with the (very few) times I've
actually
had to speak to a human.  Modem is a Dlink DSL-2640B which replaced
a crappy old Actiontec.  Have 1.5 Mb currently but can up that for only
$10 a month more -- that speed varies, of course, depending on location.
Hope that helps!

My wife's office is in CenturyLink territory, a 60 year old building
in Northwest Portland with ancient wiring (cable? fiber? Oh, you 
mean the mechanical stuff they add to keep the building facade from
falling off).  CenturyLink is only marginally competent, and their
copper is slowly turning to mush, but they are losing customers
faster, so they can still provide replacement pairs.  We have
4 lines, 3 voice plus a combined FAX/DSL line.  We have had four
problems requiring line or switch maintenance over the last year.

With the DSL connection, we don't have a routable IP address - they
NAT us.  That is actually the way we like it.  We punch outbound
VPN connections to our offsite servers and the home network.  We
bought our own DSL modem, rather than their suggested models.  The
modem was chosen for Linux compatability.  I don't recall the brand
and model (I will document it on my next visit).  The main reason
for our choice was so that our ALIX firewall could handle internal
routing, VPN termination, address assignment, etc. without a "more
helpful" modem interfering.  Unless your setup is very simple, you
probably want a similar arrangement.

We have our servers offsite for a reason - virtuals with Rimuhosting
and Linode.  If those get hammered/slashdotted/baidu'ed, we still
have internet, and we don't have to worry about address assignment
and Terms of Service hijinks from C.L.  

Other than the fussy setup, and the hardware failures at their end,
it works OK.  It is not blazingly fast like Frontier FIOS at home
in the burbs, but it works well enough to connect a couple of IP
phones, which means we can use the office phone system from home.

I have a fixed IP with CenturyLink.  Getting a fixed IP was a bitch, but
using Linux actually helped get to the right people to get it done.  (I
told them I run my own mail server. Had to turn on port 25 on their web
page config and everything worked fine.)

The problem i have with them is they started capping service.  As of
February you will get nastygrams if you use "too much" bandwidth. (They
just cut and pasted what Comcast did with their service.)  They have the
same bandwidth cap for 12mbs as it is for 40mbs.  I calculated that at
40mbs you could reach your bandwidth restriction for the month in 14
hours.  (I cut my service back to 12mbs when I found that out. Not going
to pay $50+ a month for little or no benefit.)

Buying your own modem is a good idea. My Q1000 overheats too often.

Just an FYI

Banks Warned to be Alert for Cyber attacks (09/19/2012)
The Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) 
has issued a warning to US financial institutions to be alert for cyber 
attacks following outages on the public websites of Bank of America and 
JP Morgan Chase. There are reports that several banks are being targeted 
by distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, but the others have not 
been named.

Subject: [PLUG] Thunderbird progress bar
Message-ID: <50663FAE.80409@comcast.net>

At the bottom of the T-bird window, near the right hand corner, there is 
a progress bar that, as far as I know, shows me that T-bird is still 
trying to download some part of an e-mail. This usually relates to 
something with an attachment.

Is there some way to figure out what specific e-mail is still waiting to 
finish downloading something? I've been watching that little lack of 
progress indicator for half the afternoon. I've read and deleted most of 
the e-mail that came in this afternoon, and don't find anything suspicious.

On a possibly related note, I did allow an upgrade to T-bird today 
(Ubuntu, 10.04).

You can try emptying your mail trash and compacting the mail folders. 
Not doing that regularly can slow things up a bit. Also, you "temp" 
directory could use trimming.  Usually located under "/tmp"

After updating, did you restart your Desktop Environment (log out then 
back in, usually.) How t do that depends on with DE/WM and if you are 
using a graphical login.

Done. Didn't make any difference.

Under 100 Mb in use. Nothing obvious to trim.

I restarted T-Bird, but didn't log out and back in. Have just done that, 
and the progress bar has disappeared. Thanks for the tip. That seems bad 
form for a Linux tool, though.

I'm a heavy Thunderbird user and I get this all the time. In particular 
I seem to get the eternal progress bar after going into offline mode 
after it has downloaded my email. That happens about 50% of the time I 
go into offline mode, and if I leave it this way, Tbird will eat up some 
CPU continuously. If I close and then restart it, things stay quiet as 
expected.

I have the feeling it's just some buggy interaction between Thunderbird 
and the mail server.

It sure would be nice to get some info on what Thunderbird thinks it's 
doing, though - would make it helpful to develop a meaningful bug report 
for it.

Thunderbird hasn't glitched like this for me in a long time, or after 
"on the fly" upgrades. But then, I use Xfce and Slackware ;-)

One trick is to start Thunderbird via the CLI (xterm or whichever). That 
way you might get some error console output.

Subject: [PLUG] Question on efficiently searching large files for a simple
	text match
Message-ID: <CAJeYwHe0T59Y-8pYunnJ8hZJtk=fdd1KMMk3UesdbFbaTAbOxg@mail.gmail.com>

To all:

This is a question on efficiently searching for text items in a large
file > 1 gigabyte in size.

I have a list of about 2 to 5 thousand items where an item is a couple
of text words such as "Side 2050" and S is always in the starting
column, and have to search a large file around 24 gigabytes in size
for these items.  The file is a simple text file, delineated by line
feeds.

Using the typical shell grep command script such as:

grep "Side 2050"
grep "Side 2061"
etc.

results in a very slow execution time, since the 24 gig file has to be
searched for each line of the script and I am finding this to be very
laborious and time consuming, not to mention all the hits on the hard
drive as the script grinds through each line.

I am aware of combining the grep into a pattern set, but then run into
command line length limitations.  Is it best to go this way?

What is the quickest way to do this type of search, when large files (
> 1 gig ) are involved?

Thanks for your tips, or suggestions.

- Randall

HI

Can  you just grep for S and save that in a file?

Then grep the new/smaller file for the rest?

How about something like this:

    $ grep -E "^Side" really_big_file

The caret (^) will anchor the search to the beginning of the line.
That way grep will only have to check out the first word.  Without
the anchor, grep will scan the entire line for the search string,
which would take more time.

There are some programs (e.g., Stringi or Hyper Estraier) that are
claimed to be extremely fast at searching text files.  I've never
used any of them, but from what I've been able to see, many of
them are meant to be part of a web site.  They also need to
pre-scan the text files in order to build an index, which probably
takes a while.  OTOH, if you have to scan the same set of files
over and over, this may not be a limitation.  (Stringi in
particular is supposed to have high-speed replacements for find
and grep.)

If the file won't fit in ram and you're searching from start to finish 
for each item, you'll have to pay for the disk reads 2-5k times.  Much 
better to read through the file once and check your matches as you go.  
If you don't know Perl, I think this is a really good time to read the 
`man perlintro` document.

You could go through the file line-by-line and check all of your items 
on each line

  while(my $line = <>) {
    foreach my $item (@items) {
      print $line if m/^$item/
	}
  }

And that might get it done in less time than it takes to optimize it, 
but I'm guessing you could easily compile all of your items into one 
regexp (`man perlre`) and save a lot of time with the inner loop.

Maybe also try reading chunks of e.g. 100 lines and applying a regexp 
with appropriate anchoring + captures, which might get you more speed by 
moving some of the outer loop down into the regexp engine.

For advanced parallelization, read whatever number of whatever size 
chunks memory allows and farm-out to however many cores are available.

I suspect that Randall Schwartz has just encountered the downside of
posting at PLUG using an alias that hides his identity.

How about just:

grep -f /tmp/sides.txt bigfile.txt

Where sides.txt is a list of all items you'd like to search for, one per
line.

Subject: [PLUG] reply to suggestions on searching a big file > 1 gig
Message-ID: <CAJeYwHcR4Mxy-c-P0J7x-pDghU96VX0MrqDgBOdUxUTct0ekzw@mail.gmail.com>

Thanks for the suggestions, I will make some comments here.

I see that I did not provide nearly enough context again, sorry about that.

To start, almost all records in the file start with ^S.  There are
1,053,062,790 records in the file so  I simply cannot grep for "^S"
because over a billion records will be retrieved.

Secondly I do NOT have 24+ gigs of memory, to load the file into RAM
and search that way.

Scott's suggestion:

   grep -f /tmp/sides.txt bigfile.txt

   Where sides.txt is a list of all items you'd like to search for,
one per line.

might work, I will give it a try and see how well it executes.

I am thinking of setting up multiple grep commands, using about a
1,000 patterns to match in each grep command.

Once again, thanks for the tips.

I would suggest redirect into a file..  Takes A LOT of time to print..

something like

  grep -f /tmp/sides.txt bigfile.txt > new.text.file

YMMV
