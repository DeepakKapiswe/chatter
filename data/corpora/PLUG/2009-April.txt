I'm having a devil of a time getting this to work.

First, uname in the guest OS says "Hardy32 2.6.24-23-Generic #1 SMP."

My Virtualbox on the host OS is 2.0.4-OSE. 

I downloaded the ISO for 2.0.4, got the VBoxLinuxAdditions.run file to
~/, and tried to run it from the command line. The error message in the
terminal is "Unable to build the kernel modules, see the log file ..."
Looking at the log file doesn't help much except I did note the
following errors:

Error: Kernel configuration is invalid
and at the end:
make[2]: *** [/tmp/vbox.0/cmc.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [_modulke_/tmp/vbox.0] Error 2
make: *** [vboxadd] Error 2

Using Synaptic in the guest OS I have installed all the headers that
said they were for 2.6.24-23*, but can't get the script to run without
the above errors. I also found a PDF for 2.0.4 on the same page as the
ISO, but the instructions for installing the guest additions didn't add
any information.

Still stuck without Guest Additions.

I have spent several hours trying to get the Guest Additions for 32-bit
Hardy guest OS installed. 

The host OS is Intrepid x86_64 and the version I have is virtualbox-ose
2.0.4. I downloaded the correct ISO image from the link above, burned
it to a CD, mounted the image after getting Hardy running in the
virtual machine, and tried to run VBoxLinuxAdditions.run. All I can get
is:

Verifying archive integrity ... All good
<lots of dots here>
VirtualBox 1.5.0 Guest Additions installation
Building the VirtualBox Guest Additions kernel module ...
Unable to build the kernel module. See the log
file /var/log/vboxadd-install.log

The install log has a lot of stuff in it, none of which make any sense
to me. I can't put it all here because I'd have to type it all
manually. None of the messages popped out and said "ok, dumbass, here's
what you did wrong." Don't these devs know how to write error messages
that users can understand?

You mentioned that I might need gcc and kernel headers, and possibly
other things. Well, gcc and gcc-4.2 were already installed, but I
installed all the intermediate flavors as well. And I searched on
"linux-headers" and installed every header for 2.6.24-23-Generic (which
is what uname says is the kernel that is running). But I get the same
error message.

Other instructions I have found on the net say to go to Devices at the
top, mount the CD image, then "Install Guest Additions." If I do that
it pops up a message:

Could not find the VirtualBox Guest Additions CD image
file /usr/share/virtualbox/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso
or /usr/lib/virtualbox/additions/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso. Do you want to
download the CD image from the internet?

If you say yes, it times out after about 60 seconds. (Yes, the guest OS
is connected - Firefox can go to eBay.)

I put the ISO on a CD without burning it, created the above folders on
the guest machine, and copied the ISO file into both of them. I still
get the same error message. Just in case it was referring to folders on
the host machine, I put the ISO file in both places on the host machine
also. Still no luck.

I should add that I have Windows 2000 and Windows XP guest OSs also,
and I had no problem installing Guest Additions for them.

If anyone has guest additions working for a Linux guest in virtualbox,
I'd like to hear how you did it.

Hello,

Hmmmm- based on your 2 responses after my post...

Have you tried installing the latest version of VirtualBox, 2.1.4 I think it
is?
This is the download page, there are DEBs in there specifically for Ubuntu:
http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/2.1.4/
I suggest trying the latest version instead of banging your head on a wall
for hours with an older version.

I haven't messed with Ubuntu as guest much, but I think I have it in there.
I have a bunch of guest OSes setup to tinker with.

The error messages sound like the Ubuntu kernel doesn't have the right stuff
compiled in to support the vbox modules, or the vbox modules don't work with
the particular options in the kernel.  I think I ran into this once, and the
issue was resolved by upgrading to the newest VirtualBox version (I think
this was with Fedora guest but not sure).

As far as mounting the Guest Additions CD image, you don't have to burn it
to a physical CD.
Just go to the Devices menu, tell it to mount the image.  The image should
show up in the guest as a mounted CD.
Then go in to the newly mounted CD image, and copy the files *manually* to
your hard drive, and then run them from a terminal (as I mentioned in my
earlier post), don't use the "Install Guest Additions" menu option from the
VirtualBox menu, I haven't seen that work in Linux anyway.

So I have gotten guest additions to work in *most* of the Linux and Windows
guests I have used with VirtualBox, but not all.
For example I can't get the vbox video driver to install in Fedora 11 beta
(just recently released), but that is because it complains of unknown X
server (it is likely too new, and the vbox modules don't recognize it),
though the other vbox modules do install.
The guest additions work fine with Fedora 10 (normal release).

So again IMHO and my suggestion, install the latest version of VirtualBox,
and try again, and let us know.
Also note, you would want to download the latest version of the Guest
Additions ISO as well (in the same directory linked above).

I'll do that later.

I finally gave up on the Guest Additions. My (probably) only purpose in
installing Hardy was to see if printing an OOo document from 2.4.1 on
Hardy would work better than printing it from 3.0.1 on Intrepid.
Without Guest Additions I can't access my home folder to get the file.
So in desperation I just burned the file to a CD (which the Hardy
machine can see), and dragged it onto the Hardy desktop.

I have mixed results. Many of the printing problems are fixed, but not
all. And the incorrect screen view for the formulas remains wrong,
although at least now all the brackets are printing correctly. I'm
still getting various characters replaced by the same character from
another font. The character appears correctly on screen in the font it
is set in, it's just in the printout where it is the same character but
from a completely different font. That's just weird.

I don't know whether to blame Intrepid, OOo 3.0.1, Gnome, CUPS, the
combination, or the dark side. But I found out what I wanted to know
so, for now, I am not going to mess further with the Hardy machine.

I am not smart enough to learn TeX. Besides, anyone who would use
something like TeX to layout a document must be freakin' nuts. :)

Besides, I suspect I would have the same problems printing the TeX
document. There is a problem with fonts and CUPS on Intrepid.

Taking the spirit of what Rogan said and applying your complaint with
LaTeX, you could look at an alternative to LaTeX such as docbook or
reST (re-structured text).  Something Rogan probably didn't mention is
that he writes proposals at work fairly often and he has considerable
experience authoring and collaborating in Word, OO.org and LaTeX.  I
recently went through the thesis writing processes in LaTeX and I
understand intimately why someone would choose a different system.
The next time I go to write something the size of a book I will try
learning docbook myself.  But, the bottom line is, the extra time I
spent fighting with LaTeX is nothing compared to the time I would have
spent fussing with Word or OO.org.

That's fine.  The the fonts/CUPS problems on Intrepid are orthogonal
to the merits of the markup language you choose, or not, to use.  And
good luck with CUPS, I hope you get it working to satisfaction.  But,
I will say that mostly people generate pdf from LaTeX, and a pdf may
just render those special characters as vector graphics or use a font
that is part of TeX -- so you may actually have different luck, I'm
not sure.

Does Latex use its own PDF generator? Run it through ghostscript and
then ps2pdf? Or how?

I ask because if I export PDF from OOo I get results that are not near
as good as if I print to CUPS-PDF, although CUPS-PDF is not perfect
either.

You should be able to copy it over the "network" to the host system,
e.g.:

  scp /var/log/vboxadd-install.log yourlaptopshostnamehere:

Seeing the log file might make troubleshooting this a lot easier. I
have an Ubuntu 7.10 32-bit guest running under VirtualBox 2.1.4 OSE on
an AMD64 host, and have had no issues installing the guest additions.
Select "Devices->Install Guest Additions..." menu item, and when the
ISO is mounted and shows up on the guest's desktop, sudo the
appropriate *.run file.

My Ubuntu 7.10 guest install is "stock", too, right off the CD. I only
use it for exploring alternative distros, so I've never added much
extra (i.e., I never explicitly installed any kernel headers, gcc,
etc.).

All of the above.  The utility pdflatex can go straight to pdf, but if
you use the normal latex command you get dvi, then you can run dvips
followed by ps2pdf if you like.  I did that route for years before
learning about pdflatex.

That is likely to be the difference between OOo's PDF writing
capabilities versus CUPS's PDF writing capabilities.  Not all
conversions to PDF were created equally.  LaTeX is known for making
stunningly beautiful PDFs.

I suspect that there is more than one person on this list who has written a book 
or two.  What did/do they use?  (My son started using Tex in high school, and 
has ever since used it for math and physics publications.)  My experience with 
Word and OO makes me cringe at the thought of trying to get 100's of pages 
error-free out of either of them.

Well, there's Rich for starters.  He used LyX for his book.  I suspect 
he's been ignoring this whole conversation because he knows he'd never 
convince John to use LaTeX.

   Me. You can buy a copy at Powell's Technical Books. "Quantifying
Environmental Impact Assessments Using Fuzzy Logic," published by
Springer-Verlag in 2005. ISBN: 0-387-24398-4. (Autographs extra.)

> What did/do they use?

   LyX. It's the GUI front end to LaTeX. It's what I use for almost all
writing, including articles, reports, and letters.

   Not too many folks -- except the serious masochists -- write in TeX.
That's like writing a computer application in assembly code rather than a
higher level language.

> My experience with Word and OO makes me cringe at the thought of trying to

   There's more than that involved. LyX/LaTeX allows the writer to focus
strictly on content and leaves typography and page layout decisions to the
professionals who have designed the classes. My book used the
Springer-Verlag monograph class. Their TeXpert had be globally change all
/textellipse instances to /ldots. When I looked at the differences I found
they were so subtle that most of us mere mortals would never see them unless
we specifically looked. But, /ldots are the European typographic standard,
so that's what I used.

   I cannot stand to write more than a page in OO.o Writer. It's a time
consuming hassle. And the differences in the printed output are striking.
Write the same page of text in OO.o and in LateX, export both to .pdf and
look; you'll immediately see the differences.

   Word processors use the line as the unit with which they work. TeX uses
the paragraph and the page. TeX also adjusts kerning on the fly rather than
the word processors' adjustment of inter-word spacing. Many (most?) readers
will not be consciously aware of the differences, but the typeset output
from TeX makes a subconscious impression of professionalism and quality.
I've had people comment on the appearance of a typeset report; that never
happened with a word processed document.

   But, John's correct. It takes someone willing to learn and not just click,
drag, and wear out a mouse pointing everywhere. It's not for everyone.

Galen,

   I happened only incidently to read the message just before yours. I was
ignoring the thread because I don't care if someone's using Hardy, Hardee,
or any specific distribution.

   One amusing incident illustrating the different mindsets of us LaTeX folks
from those who process words occurred on the OO.o mail list. When I upgraded
from OO.o-2.x to -3.x I lost the key bindings I use. For years all my
writing tools have used the Emacs key bindings. I have joe and LyX set up
that way, and so was OO.o Writer.

   Well, one responder kept writing and telling me that I should not use such
"non-standard" key bindings because they're not the Microsoft standard.
Really! The concept of tuning one's applications for personal productivity
is apparently a totally foreign idea to that person. And, in his world,
whatever Microsoft allows is what is to be done. I ignored him, and I did
find where to recreate the bindings I want.

   The only person I knew who used Plain TeX was Dean, an engineer at Sharp
Labs across the river and a subscriber to this list years ago. Just as I
started to learn LyX he challenged me to use that tool to reproduce a resume
for his daughter. It took him two weeks to get it looking good with Plain
TeX. I sent him the LyX version the next day. As far as I know, he's still
writing in Plain TeX. :-)

I just have to chime in again and make sure it's clear that TeX !=
LaTeX.  (I'm sure Rich is aware of this--just for general
clarification.)

I've never met a pure TeX user, and I only know of one by name
(Knuth).  LaTeX is a large step up in usability, but it's similar in
spirit.  (They are both textual markup languages, as opposed to LyX,
which is a graphical WYSIWYG-ish tool.)

That's what I feared. I suspect there does not exist pre-existing
classes for the books I do.

I completely agree that a word processor is not the tool for doing a
book. But Scribus isn't ready yet, and I don't have the time or
inclination to learn TeX.

I would kill for a Linux equivalent to Adobe Indesign CS (or CS2 or
CS3, although CS is enough for me). It does all of that, plus it is
religiously WYSIWYG. I mean what you see on the screen is exactly what
will come out of the printer, and exactly what the PDF export will look
like. I could have done the current book in InDesign in a quarter of
the time it took me in OOo. But then I would have a book that was stuck
in a proprietary format that I won't be able to open five or six years
from now unless I keep buying upgrades. And then there's activation.
And I could go on, but I'm getting sick just thinking of the corporate
crap.

A Lyx-Latex-TeX session would be an interesting topic for one of our
meetings if the presenter had a small project that the group could do
on their own computers as the talk progressed. Hands-on demonstration
is the way to sell software.

I went to a session on TeX presented by the local headquarters folk. It
was pretty useless to me. That is, I learned zero about TeX.

   Don't be so sure. There are defined liguistic symbol sets and probably
classes for linguistics books, too.

   Well, ... as Rogan and I mentioned, learning TeX won't make you a faster
writer. Learning LyX will. You will, of course, end up learning LaTeX when
you need to do things not already built into LyX (which is, IMNSHO, getting
too bloated).

   Ah, yes. Well, LyX/LaTeX is WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean). You
can always look at the dvips preview of the typeset page, but you don't need
to see how it appears on paper when you're writing or editing. That's just
distracting. You will find overfull lines that you'll need to adjust, but
that's when you're all done writing and editing.

   And you need to see this as you write and edit because ...?

   Well, walk your mouse to http://www.lyx.org/, download the tutorial, and
run that for the half-hour or so that it takes. And, LyX is not for sale ...
it's free.

Fact it, most tools come with choices like that. An old boss of mine 
called it the Chevy/Jaguar choice.

The Jaguar will get you there more quickly (on any given trip) and 
offer you far more creature comforts and features, but at a high 
initial cost and frequent trips to the mechanic.

The Chevy will be slower and won't offer all the features, but it will 
probably outlast the Energizer Bunny, without all the trips to the 
mechanic.

Samples of the Chevy/Jaguar choice are easy to come by in the digital 
world:

   Chevy            Jaguar
   ---------------- -------------------
   MySQL            Oracle
   Perl             C
   nano             emacs
   PCL              PostScript
   NIS              LDAP

In some cases, the Chevy is good enough. In other cases, the Jaguar is 
the only tool for the job. De gustibus non disputatum est.

I don't mean to be rude, but your above sentence is the opposite of
"being effective".  You should ask your editors/publishers before
making such assumptions.  Let's be honest, it's an excuse based on
ignorance but here you'd do yourself a favor to deal in facts.

Ahem.  No one is actually advocating TeX :)  Several of us think you
should consider LaTeX or an editor which assists you in generating
LaTeX.  And again, docbook or the even simpler reST may be more your
speed.

I was in line at Kinkos yesterday and one customer was complaining
that the Adobe design products she was using did not have that
property.  She was using Adobe something and having exactly the issue
that she was not getting what she was seeing on the screen.  I left
with a print out of my thesis, as it appeared on screen, before she
did -- and I had some last minute formatting issues I needed to
resolve unrelated to the markup language I used.

There is also TeXmacs.  It's about as what-you-see-is-what-you-get as
a latex "inspired" editor can get.  I used it before learning actual
latex.  I used to try things out in TeXmacs and then look at the latex
it would generate.

   Could also be how much control one wants over the final output. I'm a
touch-typist so I prefer emacs and joe because I don't need to take my hands
from the keyboard to use the trackball. After trying a dozen or so vector
line drawing programs (including Xfig, which I still use on occasion), I
settled on PSTricks which writes PostScript code compliable with TeX. No
more futzing trying to get lines to join without spaces or overlaps, typeset
text lables, and really beautiful output. And all my presentation visuals are
prepared using the Beamer class in LaTeX (which I use within LyX).

Non carborundum illegitimum,

The number of assessments that go into choice of tools is quite large, 
though I suspect most can be grouped into four basic categories 
(listed in no particular order; they're all important):

  * User preference (expertise, ease of use)
  * Cost (time and money)
  * Feature set
  * Future flexibility

The tricky part is when the choice is colored by unproductive 
assessments like choosing one product because it's more fashionable 
(i.e., people will think I'm cooler if I work with Tool A instead of 
Tool B) rather than because it's better for the workflow at hand.

John,

   Just occurred to me that you should take a look at the Memoir class for
LyX/LaTeX. It comes with a 307-page manual and is completely configurable.
Once you define how you want your books to look, modify the class to produce
that, and you're set to go. The KOMA classes are also highly configurable,
but the memoir class is easier for newcomers to use.

   In all the years I've run my business using tools on linux, no one has
ever asked what tool I've used. When I must exchange editable documents with
clients, colleagues, or agencies I write using OO.o, then send them the .doc
version. Otherwise, no one cares what I use. That's probably because I have
such a supportive boss. :-)

Funny, but I've never heard of emacs being compared to a sports car before.
vi, maybe, all sleek and fast with no extras.
But emacs seems more like a minivan.
With cupholders.
And an owners manual stashed in the glovebox.
And a luggage rack.
Pulling a trailer filled with more packages that you might want to use.

I'm a mostly happy LyX user, but there are some gotchas:

1. The fonts in a PDF can look ratty / ragged on the screen in some
cases. There's a whole bunch of stuff about this on the LyX web site
in the FAQ, but the bottom line is that it's a non-trivial exercise to
get it right, and not a simple "plug and play" operation. I'm told
they print fine, but I rarely print anything these days.

2. If you use the Beamer (aka latex-beamer) tools with LyX for
presentations, there are things you can do that will crash PDF
production in LaTeX with totally non-informative error messages. You
basically have to divide your document up into small chunks and
*constantly* test-make PDFs, and undo what you just did if it crashes.

3. I have not been able to get an automated Word format document out
of LyX, even though it's *supposed* to be possible. HTML export is
pretty good, but then you have to manually import the HTML into some
other tool and format it.

The goal is not layout control, but document processing.  If you design 
your tags well, you can alter the meanings of your macros after the fact 
to modify the layout for different targets.

Concern yourself with writing well first and presentation later.  LaTeX 
allows you to label your work as you go for intent and choose how that 
appears on the screen/paper/t-shirt when you're done writing -- choosing, 
for instance, which words or phrases get emphasis in a particular 
sentence, but deciding later whether that means italics, bold, or 
forty-points larger type.

Also, using include statements to organize chapters, sections, and 
subsections is heavenly for longer works all the while tracking references 
without having to know whether what you're writing will be chapter three 
or six.

   I use Palatino (and the math font version) and haven't had any issues for
years. My book is typeset with Palatino.

   Never had this happen. If a frame is not closed there are issues, but with
experience it's easy to figure out where we screwed up and go fix the
problem.

   Never done either of these. If I need to send someone Microsoft-formatted
processed words I use OO.o and send them the .doc export; if I need HTML I
write it with emacs. Horses for courses, is my approach.

I would like to get a radio remote control for presentations.
I imagine something that talks to a USB plugin that pretends
to be a keyboard, and generates carriage returns and backspaces
when the powered remote forward and back buttons are pushed,
driving Open Office or Acrobat Reader or whatever.  I would
like a radio remote rather than an infrared one, so I don't
have to worry about where it is pointed.

There appear to be products like this for sale on the web,
but I would like to find out about linux compatability and 
other issues before I buy one.  Does anybody have first
hand experience with one of these?

Jaff Waugh typically uses a nintendo bluetooth game controller at
presentations.  The protocol was reverse engineered a while ago.

Maybe not as simple to setup as you are looking for, but you can

I've used several different kinds of remote RF pointers with my Linux
laptop through the years and have never had an issue (and I do a huge
number of talks every year).  My current favorite pointer is:

	http://www.directron.com/mofxprf.html

Unfortunately, the manufacturer doesn't seem to be making them anymore.
Their new model has a 1GB flash drive built into the receiver that plugs
into the USB port, but seems to be missing the up/down toggle button
on the RHS that makes the older model so useful to me (boo!):

	http://www.aocusa.com/pview.php?g=Input Devices&c=Pointers&sc=Pointers&model=MO-ST-1G

Anyway, find one that's comfortable for you to use, and then buy a
bunch of them because they do break occasionally.  Also, make sure you
always have a spare battery handy.  The pointer I use requires a 
2450 type battery, which isn't always available at the corner supermarket.

Wow. Just wow. And no books were ever written until $SomeTeXApp was 
created to write them with? All authors out there are their own 
publishers as well? What an arrogant comment. He mentioned he put time

Subject: [PLUG] powernow-k8 seems to be the culprit
Message-ID: <99dafee90904021455k59f92720v8478cf7e37fa3f5@mail.gmail.com>

A while ago I mentioned in passing that I'd been plagued by system lock-ups
(sometimes with the flashing keyboard lights that I believe indicate a
kernel panic, most of the time not) that I thought were caused by faulty
hardware, though I couldn't really figure out which piece of hardware.

Well, just as an update, it now seems that the problem is hardware and
software related, in the sense that some subset of my particular
mobo/chipset/cpu combo has a problem with the kernel's implementation of
cpufreq.  The technical explanations go way over my head, but from I've been
able to glean from numerous bug reports in various distros and Linux kernel
lists, the problem is with a flaw in certain chipsets that is exposed when
the powernow-k8 kernel module implements cpu frequency stepping.  This seems
to be an issue only with SMP kernels on amd-64 systems, and it doesn't seem
to matter whether you are running a 32- or 64-bit kernel or userland.  I
have used both and had the problem with both.  VIA chipsets seem to be
particularly vulnerable.  I think others are affected as well, but it might
just be other motherboards with VIA chipsets.  I have an ASUS-A8V mobo with
a VIA chipset.

As usual when trying to get to the root of a puzzling problem, there are a
lot of sidetracks that ultimately don't lead anywhere, and I still haven't
sorted them all out.  (It's especially difficult when you don't really know
what you're Googling for, beyond "random system freeze.")  Some people
thought various video cards and proprietary drivers were involved, but that
doesn't seem to be the case.  Some people reported that disabling AMD's
"Cool 'n Quiet" feature in the BIOS solved the problem, others said that
didn't solve the problem.  I have not tried that method yet.  Some people
said updating the BIOS helped, others said they'd done that and the problem
persisted.  Some people said the problem was with powernowd, but I never had
that daemon running and I still had system lock-ups.

What I did was prevent the kernel module from loading, about 2 weeks ago,
and I have not had a freeze since.  I hesitate to say, definitively, that
the problem is solved, because the last thing I tried worked for a few weeks
and then the problem returned.  So time will tell.  Still, it's been 10 days
since my last reboot -- I can't express what a relief that is after having
the machine lock-up on me as often as two or three times a day, seemingly at
random, for weeks on end.

I'm not sure yet if any BSD OS's are affected, but it doesn't seem to affect
Windows, or at least that's what a few people who dual-boot said.  My
machine is definitely noisier that it was with the module loaded, so I'm
probably sucking down more electricity and running hotter.  I'll keep
looking for other possible workarounds that don't require disabling cpufreq
altogether.  I might give FreeBSD another shot, after I look into whether
this is an issue that affects the BSD kernel.  I don't know when, or if,
Linux kernel developers are going to come up with a solution.

Randal,

That is great.
I also need to talk with you for a couple minutes after the meeting.

And for your (and everyone else's) information; I listened to your
Floss Weekly cast this week.
It was great.  I highly recommend it.

You *can* write in InDesign, and I have done so, but that is not what
it's primarily designed for. It is a layout app. It is designed as the
tool in which you assemble text created in (typically) a word processor
and graphics created in something that can create bitmaps or vector
graphics, and then tweak them both as you position them on the page.
Everything is in frames, which can be linked. Having things in frames
makes it easy to position them on the page. 

Normally I would do the major chunks of writing in OOo and then place
into InDesign. But I much prefer to do the laying out as I write. You
ask why I would do this as though it is contrary to the natural order
of things. For you, it probably is. For me, it's the logical way to
write a book. You see, to me the appearance is as important as what I
say. If I'm getting close to the end of a chapter and I'm near the end
of an even numbered page, I need to decide if I want to condense what I
say so it will fit, or go ahead and add two more pages to the book
(because I'm traditional enough that I like chapters to start on an odd
numbered page).

InDesign is not a text editor where it automatically creates new pages
for you. In fact, when you create a new document you must specify how
many pages you want it to be. You can add and delete pages if you guess
wrong, but it is page based. If you're typing and get to the end of the
page you can continue typing, but the text will be overset. 

To me InDesign is the logical way to create a book. Scribus is too,
because the paradigm is similar, except that Scribus lacks so many
features that it is not usable for much beyond newsletters and book
covers. 

The reason that InDesign seems logical is because it is exactly the
same process that you would use if you were laying things up with hot
wax. 

And I could have done the r?sum? in about five minutes, ten at the
outside. The text would be optically kerned (ignoring the kerning
tables in the font) the margins would be optically aligned and the line
endings would be adjusted according to the paragraph (they actually
used Knuth's code). 

I have no doubt that you would dislike InDesign. But you and I are
wired very differently. I am totally visual, so to me the appearance is
part of the content. I can't conceive of "just writing." When I do
"just write" I must at least have in mind what it is going to end up
looking like on the page.

Yes, I already knew that. And I already own a license for it.

I regret I did not make it clear that my reason for not using it is
because I don't want my work in a format that I may not be able access
easily five years from now. My books have a long economic life, but
need to be tweaked every few years. Adobe does everything they think
they can get away with to force people to buy upgrades.

And then there is the issue of activation and the corporate crap.

FYI, I did a cleaned-up-for-tv-4:3 edit of this creative commons
[by-nc-sa license] netcast so that the guest intro is before the guest
interview, removed commercial references that are problematic on
public access, etc, and am playing it on Comcast 22 in Salem
(44min40sec).

If anyone here is certified to sponsor shows on any of the Portland
area public access stations, let me know what station and/or what
format they accept, and I'll shoot it to you...  Since the co-host and
both guests were Portlandians, it would nice if the Portland community
could see it.

Does anyone know if Leo has any interest in tracking this kind of
re-use, and what is the best way to give a heads up?

   That's a typographic convention. The TeX engine does this automatically
when you use a book class. You don't have to think about it, it's done. You
also don't have to manually set widow and orphan control on because that's
also a typographic convention.

   Another reason why the TeX compiler makes multiple passes over the text is
that it balances page lengths. How much time do you spend with OO.o or
InDesign changing what you've written so the text on each page is the same
height?

   Good. Be happy.

   That's for legs, isn't it? At least that's what I've heard women say.

I was just gifted an analog NEC LCD display and wanted to use it on my

Unfortunately, all I can achive so far is cloned display.  Does anyone
here have a working Xorg conf for a ATI Radeon based thinkpad they

I haven't done this with my T42, but I did have it working on an older
desktop machine -- I might be able to dig up the x config for that set
up as a last resort (it was using an ATI 9800 pro, iirc.).

For what it's worth, "dual head" and "xinerama" are good keywords for this.

You don't need to mess with your Xorg.conf (much) if you just use xrandr:

   xrandr goes beyond ThinkPads; it's included in Slackware-12.2.

Indeed.  I didn't mean to imply otherwise-- it's just that the Thinkwiki
article is one of the more useful I've found on the subject.

Thinkwiki++   The content is top-notch, and if you have a thinkpad,
it's directly applicable (detailed hardware descriptions / issues /
etc.).  For example, the "magic numbers" in their examples will
probably "just work", whereas the info on the Ubuntu forums, for
example, is much harder to find and adapt to your situation (in
comparison--ubuntu forums have great info too, but it's not as

Ooooh, I got me new best frend.

nice clear error messages - the only X change was to set up a virtual
display large enough to accomodate the two screens side by side.

Big Grip Moment - the Kubutu System Settings Display utility:
    * did not emit any reason why it wouldn't do anything besides clone
      the displays
    * when xorg.conf was properly configured to allow the virtual screen
      size it still wouldn't do the task
    * when not doing the task it also reset the previouly good randr
      configured screen arrangement to cloned screens

What a FUG.

Not to waste a lot of time setting up backgrounds and all that stuff

Minor nit about ThinkWiki - searching for dual head or xinerama did not 
lead to the wonderful xrandr page.

Thanks Hal, just what I needed and wanted.

A little late to the party, but my results are:

Host system Kubuntu 8.10 
OpenOffice 	- displays fine

Abiword		- displays garbage
KMail			- displays fine (internal editor)

Odd response on Abiword.

As I read your note I thought of Arbor Peakflow - which we use where I work. 
However it is not free.  Their website and product description do provide fodder for Googling.
http://www.arbornetworks.com/

A potential open source package that might meet your needs is flowscan:
http://www.linuxhaxor.net/2008/01/03/flow-based-ip-traffic-analysis-with-flowscan/

Poking around there I see a tool more oriented with reporting on overall traffic profiles - while you are interested in traffic exceptions.

Something from this Google (linux netflow) may fit your needs:

Glad you mentioned this because I've been meaning to ask for some
distro suggestions.

I have no intention of changing from Intrepid x86_64. My motivation is
to convict the module that is causing all the grief that I have been
having with OOo 3.0.1. At the moment my #1 suspect is Gnome. So what I
want is a distro that uses KDE and has not even a shred of Gnome in it.
That means it also can't come with any part of OOo, since OOo requires
parts of Gnome, even on a KDE machine.

The problem I am having is characters dropping out in printouts and
usually (but not always) dropping out on the screen as well. And it
happens in Abiword, KWord and Scribus as well as OOo. So a distro that
has just those three would be perfect, although I can install them if
it doesn't come with them.

Oh, and a live CD distro would make things way easier. Else I have to
install it in VirtualBox, which is kind of a pain. I never did figure
out how to get the Guest Additions working in Hardy-32 that I installed
in VirtualBox. I nstalled it only to see if the bug happened in Hardy
as well, and it does, so I can now delete the virtual machine.

Any suggestions?

Oh, and since I'm not actually going to use the distro, consider this
request [ - FLAME, +curiosity ].

I've thought this would be a good Advanced Topics some time. The Great
Distro Smackdown. A bunch of lightning talks all showing off what

I would think that there are several flavors that would suit that need: 
Gentoo, Slackware, Knoppix, Debian, SuSE.  I know some of those let you
pick and choose the packages to install, and a subset of those would
tell you if there is a dependency problem.

   Slackware. Pat dislikes Gnome and does not include it with KDE and Xfce
(plus blackbox. fluxbox, and a few others) in each release.

   Feh! I have always used Xfce since both Gnome and KDE are to Microsoftish
in appearance for me. And I've been using OO.o since WordPerfect for Linux
died with the change from libc5 to libc6. The current version of OO.o is
openoffice.org-3.0.0_en_US-i586-3_SBo and it works as well as previous
versions have done. The only KDE installed is kdelibs and kdebase. I've not
needed any Gnome specifically to run OO.o.

   I've run AbiWord, but it's not as useful for translating from/to Word so I
use just OO.o for that. Scribus runs just fine here and I use it for page
layout on fliers and brochures.

I've never really understood the distro smackdowns honestly. I think the one
thing that irks me most is the long held and I believe false idea that
certain distros support certain hardware while others don't. Given that
hardware support is a kernel thing, 3rd party modules like
madwifi/nvidia/ati not withstanding. I do believe redhat does incorporate
some non-mainline kernel bits that do support certain features not found in
other distros but they release patches that would allow anyone to add $x
support.

I think there's plenty to differentiate distros, and as you say, it's
generally not hardware support. Freedom, distance from upstream,
community, frequency of release, and stability are a few of the real
differences, IMO.

Dan,
I can agree. The one and only thing I'd love to see which i think would help
greatly in adoption is a common packaging system/dependency resolution
system. I haven't played much with apt based systems but I do like
yum/packagekit, it used to be a PITA but it has definitely matured over the
years. I seriously doubt that this will ever happen though.

Well ... OK ... brief differentiator list:

1. Color: openSUSE, green, Fedora, blue, Ubuntu, brown

2. Packaging: openSUSE, RPM, Fedora, RPM, Ubuntu .deb

3. Release cycle: openSUSE, 8 months, Fedora, 6 months, Ubuntu, 6 months

4. Distance from upstream: about equal

5. Size of base repositories: I'm not sure here, but I think Ubuntu is
the largest, followed by Fedora and openSUSE. But you can usually find
packages for all of them.

6. Stability: I have no decent hard evidence on this. But if it's
solid stable "ancient history" you want, stick with RHEL/CentOS,
Debian stable or SuSE "enterprise" distros.

7. Freedom: they've all made some kind of bargain to get multimedia,
Java, Flash, Acrobat Reader, etc. Except gNewSense, that is. :)

8. Community: I've browsed all of the forums and they all seem pretty
much the same.

9. Tools for building your own distro, release media, etc.: I have no
idea what Ubuntu and Fedora have here. openSUSE has some neat tools,
although the documentation is a bit on the rough side. Gentoo had some
neat stuff but the documentation was non-existent and the whole Gentoo
release engineering effort appears to have disintegrated. So I'd give
openSUSE the nod here.

In the end, what switched me from Gentoo to openSUSE was the release
cycle. I'm not at all happy that openSUSE decided to slip the 11.2
release from six months after 11.1 to about 11 months after 11.1, and
*then* switch to an eight-month cycle. I downloaded the Ubuntu and
Fedora betas but haven't had a chance to do much except boot Ubuntu
once.

But at this point, I'm not sure I can hold out on openSUSE 11.1 until
November, when both Ubuntu and Fedora will have had two releases. As
far as the announced feature set is concerned, Ubuntu appears to have
more stuff that I want than Fedora. But I'll beta test both of them
and possibly switch my workstation over from openSUSE 11.1.

Subject: [PLUG] Determining if Old Library Versions are Needed
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0904061129210.14072@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   On my main box I have three versions of qt: -3.3.8b, -4.2.2, and -4.4.3.
The last is the latest version and I use that to build new releases of apps
requiring qt4 front ends.

   Is there a clever way for me to determine if any currently installed apps
use the two earlier versions? I'd just as soon delete the /usr/lib/
directories for them if they're not required.

TIA,

Rich

You can ask a binary which libraries it loads.  Use:
ldd <name of file>

You can learn a bit more here:
http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LibraryArchives-StaticAndDynamic.html

Make sure to check both program binaries and .so files.  You wouldn't
want to miss something.  I don't know if this would be exhaustive but
it seems like a good place to start.  Although, it might take a while
to fully automate it.

HTH,

If you're using a Debian-derived distribution, you can use the
deborphan command (which comes in the package 'deborphan') to
determine what libraries are installed but not depended upon by other
packages.  Also, if you use aptitude you can browse through the
"Obsolete and Locally Created Packages" section to find out what is no
longer a needed package or library.

Of course this doesn't help if you compiled anything yourself against
certain libraries or if you're using another distro.

eh, not really.  i've been down this rabbit hole a few times:


export VERSION=4.2.2
find /bin /usr/bin /sbin /usr/sbin /usr/local/bin /usr/lib
/usr/local/lib -type f > /tmp/list
for i in `cat /tmp/list` ;
  do file $i | grep ELF | grep shared && ldd $i | grep libqt | cut -d
\> -f 2 |cut -d \( -f 1` | grep $VERSION && echo $i
done

edit version and paths to find to reflect your setup.

   Thanks very much, Chris. I knew someone much smarter than I am in shell
scripting had put together the tools to do this job.

There was talk of a MySQL backend for Subversion at one time, but I 
think this is dead.  FSFS is what is currently used.  What are you 
looking for that the current Subversion implementation doesn't offer?

FSFS is default, but berkeley db is available in case you really want
to put all your eggs in one basket.

i did a migration about 6 months ago from an old BDB repo into a new
FSFS repo, and i am really thrilled not to have one huge binary file
as my entire repo now.  this could be an artifact of the old version
of SVN we were using, but things got squirrelly after we passed the
11GB mark on our repository (we check in a lot of huge binary files,
our source code is not that prolific...only on revision 12,900 or so
for 6 years of history).  symptoms included incomplete reports from
svn log, extremely slow checkouts/checkins, and occasional misc
weirdness on the server and client side.

so as you may have gathered, this is not a huge recommendation for the
BDB backend.

I am doing research on FSFS, BDB and any other backend solutions that 
might be available and then drafting a small document on advantages and 
recommendations.

I've also heard horror stories about incompatibilities when changing
the version of BDB that your svn is linked against.  In fact, that was
the main thing I remember hearing about when I heard that BDB is no
longer recommended.

oh, true, that was quite a huge pain too.  since i couldn't sanely
downgrade bdb since everything in the world depends on it, i had to
install an old version of bdb to even try to talk to the blob of
repository data when trying to migrate onto a newer OS.

Subject: [PLUG] Formulas
Message-ID: <20090407165731.f2b53ac8.johnxj@comcast.net>

I am hoping someone here has some suggestions that I haven't tried.

I need to generate formulas that look like this (pretend the brackets
are solid scalable brackets):

[ something ]
[ anything    ]
[ everything ]

And pretend that the items in the stack are left justified and that the
right and left brackets are whatever distance apart that they need to
be to hold the largest text item. And I need to be able to specify a
specific font. Also, the number of items in the stack will vary from
one to eight. I should also add that no actual math or calculation is
necessary. This is for print purposes only.

I need the formulas as vector graphics. No bitmaps, please. Because
print output will be to laser and raster images on lasers are generally
ugly.

OOo has a dandy Math module that creates these beautifully. However, it
has so many bugs that it is currently unusable. (Yes, even 2.4.1 on
Hardy.) Furthermore, you can use it to place the formula in an OOo
document (e.g., Writer), but the only export option is PDF. I'd much
prefer EPS or SVG because you can't easily place a PDF in another
program.

KFormula also has a nice little math editor that is in many ways even
easier to use than OOo's math editor. However, it has even more bugs
than OOo's math editor. It offers an EPS export option, but if you try
it you get "unable to parse xml data." Ditto for its SVG export option.
(I may pursue this further if I can't find anything better.)

LyX creates dandy formulas, but if I want them in a specific font I can
get them out of LyX only in PDF format.

Why the problem with PDF, you ask? Because I really need the formulas
as individual graphics. I can export anything that I can print to PDF
with CUPS-PDF. But to convert that to a vector graphic does not seem
possible. I could use pdf2ps and then convert the PS. But pdf2ps
rasterizes the PDF. No more scaling for that image.

Scribus can take LaTeX code and generate a formula from it. Works a
treat, except that the output is a bitmap and you have your choice of
only three fonts, and only the regular-italic versions.

I should add that I am not faulting Linux here. There are only three
packages that I know of on Windows that can do what I want, and they
are all outrageously expensive (InDesign, FrameMaker and Ventura). And
two of them are in a rest home.

It may not be possible to do what I want, but I thought I'd ask anyway.
Any suggestions welcome.

   Well, Knuth created TeX primarily to set mathematical equations so of
course they are beautifully typeset.

   How strange. Since PostScript is a vector language I'm shocked that the
conversion from PDF changes the format from vector to bit-mapped.

   Regardless, pull up your knickers and take a look at pdftk. This PDF Tool
Kit will burst a pdf file so each page is a separate pdf file.

   FWIW, I've converted text from PDF to PS with pdf2ps and ended up with
vectors that are easily converted to ASCII text.

Have you looked at inkscape at all?  I know it can convert between a 
number of scalable formats, but I don't remember if it's much good 
with PDF...

It looks like inkscape has a LaTeX tool:

http://eugenwintersberger.vox.com/library/post/use-inkscape-with-latex.html

assuming that works, you could make your formulas in LaTeX, then
generate the images with inkscape.

I didn't elaborate, but the issue is that I need something to import to
Scribus. And that is because after three days of working with it I have
concluded that there is probably no way I can lay out my textbooks with
LyX or LaTeX.

Scribus, unfortunately, is not very mature. It can import a PDF or a PS
file, but it rasterizes them in the process. The only vector graphics
files it can import and maintain as vectors are vector EPS and SVG.

So I need formulas in those formats. I can do them in LyX, and so far
that seems to be the best alternative. But that means PDF because I
can't get PS out of LyX if I use XeTeX. And I need XeTeX to get the
font I need. (The TeX-LaTeX community seriously needs to mount a
campaign to convert from their old font system to using the fonts that
are installed on the user's system. I have other issues with LyX-LaTeX,
but that is the showstopper.)

It may be that the problem is not in pdf2ps. Pdf2ps may be maintaining
the vectors and it is Scribus that is rasterizing the file. But that is
academic. Either way I am stuck. And I know for a fact that the only
files that Scribus can import and maintain as vectors are vector EPS
and SVG.

So I need something that will create simple formulas and let me export
them as vector EPS or SVG files. And since I have hundreds of formulas
per book it had better be something simple and quick. For example,
doing in LyX with XeTeX is a pain. I have to export to pdflatex, then
use xelatex to convert to PDF, then use something to convert to SVG or
EPS, then place in Scribus. And then I notice that I left out a comma.
Aaargh.

I had looked at it, but I hadn't considered importing PDF. Amazingly,
it seems to do a good job of it. That is, it maintains it as vectors.
And its native format is SVG, so it may be a solution to getting the
formulas into Scribus, which is their ultimate destination.

I still have to create them in something like LyX, export as PDF from
LyX, import into Inkscape, export as SVG, then import into Scribus. For
hundreds of formulas (which I create as I am writing the book), that is
a pain. It would be far better if Inkscape could create the formula
itself, but it doesn't seem to have that functionality. Nevertheless,
push come to shove, it may be the best alternative. Thanks for bringing
it to my attention.

   Scribus is a page layout application focused on graphic-centric
publications. LyX/LaTeX is a typesetting application designed for
text-centric publications.

   Regardless, if you want to produce your books in Scribus, then forget
LaTeX. You'll never be happy as it is not suited for your oft-expressed
preferences. Stick with Scribus and accept what it allows you to do.

That looks really promising. I know how to write the syntax in LaTeX (I observed how LyX did it).

Installation may be a challenge, however. Not the clearest instructions for us dummies. :(

There has been a misunderstanding.

My comment was intended to show that John is, in fact, "smart enough" to 
learn anything he'd like.   If he can write a book, he can write it in 
LaTeX.

I'm sure he meant the line as some kind of self-deprecating humor, but the 
humor is there to distract from the strange willfulness that is preventing 
him from learning the best way to do the thing he wants done.   I mean, 
InDesign?  For a whole book?  That's just silly.  It is very much like 
pasting things up with wax, but we now have computers that do these 
tedious tasks for us so we can concentrate our brain power on things the 
computer cannot do (like, you know, generating the sentences that go on 
the page).

John says he can't imagine writing without seeing *exactly* what the page 
will display as he's writing.  The problem here, of course, is that any 
change in the way the information is presented means John has to revisit 
every page and lay it all out again.  With a proper separation of 
presentation from content, a single change in the class definitions 
changes the look of the entire book from cover to cover.   Of course, he 
also misses the dynamic referencing of chapters, formulae, and charts. 
When John wants to add or remove a diagram, he has to go back and renumber 
all of his diagrams.  Heaven forbid he should decide to move an entire 
chapter -- now he has to go back and adjust the content and layout of each 
page that referenced the headings, charts, figures, and formulae in that 
chapter and, potentially, subsequent chapters.  It's a fucking mess.

Larry Wall's concept of "false laziness" applies here in spades.

I think you're projecting a whole lot.  I don't believe John has put any 
time into seriously considering using LaTeX for his book project.  He 
wrote that he "suspects" there aren't classes for the formulas he would 
like to construct.   Here's the first hit from Google:

Subject: [PLUG] Modern Scanner Advise Please
Message-ID: <49DD164A.3090903@mailswamp.com>

Hello Linux folkz,

My old 7 y.o. HP scanner just gave the ghost, and I'm looking for a new one.
Could somebody please recommend, based on the personal experience, which make or
model of a modern flatbed scanner preferably with the document feeder and either
USB or Network interface or both will work flawlessly with Linux.

Most of the supporter scanners listed here
http://www.sane-project.org/sane-mfgs.html
are either severely outdated or no longer in production.
And even those which have supported Status as "Complete" may not produce
expected image quality.

My old scanner ScanJet 6390C, which supported Status was "Complete", from the
day one was always producing a pinkish vertical stripe along the left edge of
the scanned image, which I had to crop to remove this annoyance. I was using
XSANE as a front end interface for this scanner.
May be you have had more pleasant experience with scanning in Linux.

Thank you in advance for any hint or advise,

Alex

While not a flatbed, the HP 3050 (printer+scanner) is great for B&W 
document-feed scanning.  I would guess that anything else supported by 
hplip would be a similar story (but I think that means it must be a 
printer+scanner rather than just a scanner.)

I spent quite a bit of time looking for a decent scanner with ADF, 
primarily for scanning multi-page B&W documents.  I concluded that the 
pricing was ridiculous and Linux support always looked questionable.  
So, it's a laser printer *and* a trouble-free scanner for less than the 
cost of an flatbed-with-adf driver headache.  Plus, I like to see open 
drivers paid for by the manufacturer.

I also have an old canoscan flatbed which works great for the occasional 
color page I need (though some light reading a while back implies that 
new models may have broken the driver by upgrading the guts.)

I bought an Epson V700 flatbed scanner ($500) last fall.  It needed a
epkowa driver via an Epson iscan package to work on my Debian box, but
it is working great for me.

I am running a HP OfficeJet 7310 which is supported under the newer 
kernels, to scan, copy, print, and fax (all in color or back and white) 
- quite happy with it - it even reads my camera's memory card.

I am running both Linux 2.6.22.19 and 2.6.27 at the moment (Mandriva 
2008 and 2009) on Intel based machines.

Hope that helps

Is anyone using a Laser copy/fax/print/color scan device with a document

I've used a Brother MFC-9840CDW under Linux a little here and there and
didn't have any problems with it. They had a Linux driver on their site that
I used. It is a color Laser all in one, but a large office sized one.
Excellent quality, though. It's my dad's and I just went over there today
and scanned in a whole ream of printouts and had it saved directly to my
thumb drive. (printer has a port for that.) You can also print/fax directly
from the thumb drive. If you need a serious solution it's wonderful, but
it's not exactly cheap, and it takes up more space than the normal user
models.

I'm printing to a Brother 7820N. (You all probably know that N means 
network.)

I haven't used it to fax or scan from my Ubuntu Hardy machine. My 
recollection is that I wasn't able to get scan to work on it, but I may 
not have tried too hard. I do those things on it with my XT laptop.

Printing seems to be much slower from Ubuntu Hardy than from XT. I 
assume it's something to do with CUPS being in the middle. Also, 
printing from a web page doesn't work well from Firefox on Ubuntu Hardy, 
whereas it works fine from Firefox on XT.

   OK. I'll toss out some information, too. I have a HP 5200C (thanks, Pete!)
with a USB connection to my main machine. It just works. And works well. I
use the Xsane front end with it and have successfully scanned color prints,
black-and-white papers (including newspaper articles), and monochrome
drawings.

This looks like it might be a full partition.  Probably the partition

Derek,

   I looked at that, but /var is only 48% full.

I have.
As others have reported any of the HP All in one devices are supported.

My experience with a consumer grade device was:

  Scanning just works
  plugging a camera memory card in works even better
  wireless networking interface is a joy

I know very little about sendmail, but a quick google turned up:

Do you have your postmaster alias set up correctly?

   Yes. Postfix has its own version of sendmail, and this error has not shown
up in any log report prior to a couple of days ago.

Have you suffered a power outage recently?  That looks like it might be
due to orphan inodes getting dropped during recovery after a power cut.

Robert,

   No, all electricity here is delivered through buried cables and has not
gone off in years.

   If the nodes are orphaned is there a way to delete them so those critical
error messages stop showing up in the logwatch report?

Thanks,

Rich

it doesn't look like you've actually looked at the mail logs to see what 
else was going on around the time those errors were generated.  i 
occasionally see errors like that from a real sendmail and they are 
usually related to spam activity and dropped connections.  it could be 
totally harmless.  so find that section of the maillog and possibly the 
system log (messages usually) to see what else was logged around that 
time.

Minor/major quibble: All electricity is delivered above ground at some
point of the journey. All it takes is for some drunken fool to smack
the pole where it transitions from above ground to below ground to
really mess things up. Or anywhere upstream.

Of course if you have a buried cable directly to Bonneville the above
does not apply. <g>

I've had way more outages since moving to a neighborhood with
underground utilities.

   A bit of Google taught me that this is certainly a sendmail thing, but my
MTA is postfix. Apparently sendmail plops messages into
/var/spool/clientmqueue, then shuffles them to /var/spool/mqueue, and
finally delivers them.

   Anywho, I looked (first time ever) at var/spool/clientmqueue and found 91
files with none newer than 2005. So I deleted them (except for
sm-client.pid* which has an atime of Sep 7, 2004. Think I can safely delete
that one, too?

   There is nothing in /var/spool/mqueue.

   Still strange. If no one has a definitive answer, I'll wait to see
tomorrow's logwatch report and see if clearing all files from that one
directory makes a difference.

   With this and the still unresolved procmail issue, someone should cue the
theme music from The Twilight Zone.

Joe,

   I did grep /var/log/maillog* for sendmail ...

   That's what it seemed to be in the logs. I found a bunch of rejected spam
and all had 'sendmail' rather than 'postfix' in the log.

> it could be totally harmless.

   I suspect that it is, but thought someone had a definitive answer for me.

Many thanks,

   That's applicable here, too. However, it was several ice storms ago when
someone ran into a power pole while sliding down 238th Ave. Many years.

   We don't get any BPA power; they sell to the public utilities and we're
charged by PGE.

   Gophers? Moles? Smell cooking meat when the power goes out?

Congrats on the reliable power. I'm jealous.

   Then we'd all be wearing aluminum-foil helmets, wouldn't we?

   However, that's the latest technique for recharging cell phones and
similar small devices. (I can picture people bending their heads with
attached Bluetooth device) to a charging station and watching their eyeballs
roll until the device is fully charged.)

One of the reasons I adopted Linux (Ubuntu Intrepid) was that, unlike
Windows,  it SUPPOSEDLY allowed one to fully back up the entire system,
system files and all, and restore them. So if you installed files or
configured your system and made mistakes, you revert to a previous
system. That's the theory. The reality is  a bitter disappointment. 

I sudo su, change to /  directory and use the following  command and
generate a valid tar backup: 

tar cvpjf /home/username/BackUp/Archives/total_backup.tar.bz2
--exclude="/home//username/HD_1" --exclude="/home//username/HD_2"
--exclude="/home//username/.thumbnails"
--exclude="/home//username/.mozilla/default/Cache" --exclude="/proc"
--exclude="/lost+found" --exclude="/media" --exclude="/mnt"
--exclude="/sys" /

To restore,  I sudo su, change to the / directory and use the following
 command: 

tar xvpjf /home/username/BackUp/Archives/total_backup.tar.bz2  -C /

First problem. Upon reboot I get an "error 15" Can't find the grub
files. They are there but It seems the problem may be with  using UUIDs
instead of (hd0) notation. The UUIDs change. What no-life propeller head
chose to use UUIDs anyway? 

It gets worse. I tried  booting from the distro DVD (Intrepid)  and
using grub to 'find /boot/grub/stage1'. 

grub finds it (hd0,5). That's the correct location. I use the sudo su,
then the root (hd0,5) command. No error messages. I use the  setup (hd0)
command and the output says it found the  /boot/grub/stage1 file and is
writing (hd0)/boot/grub/menu/.lst.

BUT... It does not write (hd0)/boot/grub/menu/.lst. Anywhere. I check
the root drive and the old /boot/grub/menu/.lst is still there. Even if
I rename it, no new menu.lst appears .


What am I doing wrong? Or is Linux still not ready for prime time and
only for hackers?

Do you have a separate boot partition? Maybe (hd0,1) or (hd0,2) etc is your
boot partition
and the menu.lst you need to be editing is in one of those partitions. It
can happen that their are actual grub files in hd(0,5), but that those are
not the ones pointed to by the grub  MBR.   The one thing your tar file did
not back up is the MBR.  To make the backup complete you should
dd if=/dev/hda of=MasterBoootRecordBackup bs=512 count=1

Another possibility is that booting from the DVD changes the drive order,
and when you boot again without the DVD, the drive has changed name. This is
the problem the UUID stuff is supposed to fix. So you can have ugly drive
specifications, or drive specifications that change from under your feet.
This is not really a linux problem per se, but a problem with the BIOS.

Oh, it's ready for prime time.  It's just that the PC BIOS interface
is *long* past it's prime. 

The way you did your backup is a little odd and while it can work,
it's error prone.  Without going into too much detail, let's see if we
can help you get your system booting again.

First of all, on all of my systems the menu.lst file is stored at
/boot/grub/menu.lst, not /boot/grub/menu/.lst.  Do you have a
/boot/grub/menu.lst file?

Second of all, I don't know why the menu.lst file should be updated at
all when you reinstall grub on your hd0.  Primarily grub just needs
to know where the bootloader stages are at on disk (which you probably
changed when you overwrote those files).  Have you tried booting since
you redid the grub install?

That /boot/grub/menu/.lst is a typo. Your  /boot/grub/menu.lst is what
my system uses. I don't know why the  menu.lst file is updated by grub.
That is the output of  the setup (hd0) command. I didn't specify it. I
don't think I can.  

You mentioned that the way I did the  backup is a little odd. I found
the syntax online in an Ubuntu forum and slightly modified it to fit my
system/drive configuration. I have two SATA drives (data and backup) in
addition to the primary SATA drive which houses two ext3 partitions (/
and /home) plus a swap partition. I only want to back up the primary
SATA drive with all requite files to restore. Thus the EXCLUDES
statements. They also suggested the other EXCLUDES.  

If you have any pointers or alternative command  sequence to backup my
whole system  (minus the  two secondary SATA drives) I would be very
grateful 


Thank you,

I have two SATA drives (data and backup) in addition to the primary SATA
drive which houses two ext3 partitions (/ and /home) plus a swap
partition. Nothing else on that primary SATA drive. I only back up the
primary SATA and as a newbie I presume hd0 is the place for the boot
record. 

Using  GParted, I find this drive  is partitioned so:

/dev/sda2

Subdivided into 

/dev/sda6 /

/dev/sda7 /home

/dev/sda5 swap


/dev/sda1 is not mentioned. Where should the grub setup command point
to?  hd0? hd0,1? The Oort Cloud? 

Your suggestion about using dd confuses me. Will this generate a second
file that should be kept with the tar file? Appended to it somehow? How
do I use it  

This very frustrating for a newbie who wants to learn an alternative to
the Totalitarian Microsoft Machine (sigh).

Thank you

Well, I just wouldn't use tar for backing up a whole system.  Unix
filesystems have lots of special files that don't play well with the
relatively naive file copies that tar does.  Examples include hard
links, device files, named pipes/sockets, and probably a number of
others I haven't thought of.

To back up all system files, you'd be better off with using backup
software.  AMANDA is a venerable system for this purpose, though it
may be complicated for your basic needs.  There are dozens if not
hundreds of other solutions out there.  Just run over to freshmeat.net
and type in "backup" in the search form.

Now, with that said, I admit that I use tar for backups.  However, I
am *not* worried about backing up my whole system.  If you're using a
stable Linux distribution/release, you shouldn't have to worry too
much about updates that actually break your system.  I've never had an
update completely bork one of my systems to the point of needing a
reinstall and I tend to run bleeding edge releases.

A final option, if you're really wanting your system in *exactly* the
same state that it was at some point in time, then boot your system
off of a boot disk and run dd to read sector for sector over to
a file on your backup drive.  This grabs everything, including your
boot sector and even Windows partitions if you have them lying around.
You'll need to research the syntax, but it's not too tough.

HTH,
tim

Sorry, I didn't see the newbie designation. If I were to tell a newbie how
to backup his system, I would tell him to back up any files he had
personally created. Then reinstall the system from the install disks as he
did originally , and then copy back onto the disk the files you backed up. I
would never ever tell a newbie to edit his grub  menu.lst or to touch tar.
Those things can burn you and you should feel that your not a newbie before
you touch them.

To remove yourself from the state you are in, just reinstall from the
installation disks, untar your backup file in some temporary directory and
copy the files you need back into the fresh installation.

Realise that the boot loader does not live in a filesystem.  Grub
lives in the MBR of the boot device (or something like that), so
backing up and restoring the filesystems won't install grub for you.
If you are restoring to new (or different) media, you'll have to
reinstall grub on the boot device.  Check grub documentation for
details.  

Everything else should work okay, I think with the possible exception
(I don't typically use tar that way, so I'm not certain of its option
semantics) that you probably want to backup the mount points (just not
their contents) /sys, /proc, /media, etc.  That is, you want those
directories to exist in your restored filesystem.

   Well, no more sendmail log report of severe errors. Cleaning out
/var/log/clientmqueue did the trick. There were only 91 files there so I
doubt that I ran out of inodes. Regardless, the problem has gone away ... at
least for now.

   Thanks, all, for your ideas, suggestions, and comments.

Heya,

A few guys and I on #orlug have collaborated plans to launch a hacker space
this month. Anyone interested can send me an email for details. We are
looking to split rent on a store front in SE evenly all ways. We will also
have a place for servers.

Kyle,

   Take a look at today's Oregonian; the front page of the Business section,
I believe it is. There's a article about CubeSpace and several others that
provide offices, conference rooms, and other amenities for very reasonable
rates. That might suit your needs better.

I currently sublet desk space in a building in SE for $250/mo. I don't have
cool coffee machines or snack services, but I do have 24 hour access and a
dedicated desk for like half the cost of Cubespace and the others.

My biggest complaint is that I don't have people around to collaborate with.
I've worked independently for years and miss a lot having other programmers
and tech people to bounce ideas off of.

I'd love to go in on some office space with some others from the plug. It
may also be worthwhile to look at the building that I currently sublet in,
which is inexpensive but good close-in, and has large spaces currently
available.

Kyle, can I give you a call some time to talk?

We currently have a place in SE we are looking at. This place is super laid
back and they have no baring walls so we can build or tear down as needed.
We need about 10 people total to get the price down to about ~$90 a month
per person. It's big enough to hold about 15 or 20 active working people.
All of us have a pretty diverse set of tools and we plan on making a budget
for books and other various items (like a laser cutter :)). We really need
help to get this thing kicked off this month. I'd like to get things fulling
rolling before the summer.

Kyle,

Can you elaborate on your intention for this space?  I may be 
interested...

This will be a space for any type of rapid prototyping, development, tool
sharing, and programming. We will be renting a retail spot we can all share
and build things. The point of a hacker space is to have a place for all of
us to share and work together in. There is a number of these in cities all
over the US. Portland has had many failed attempts and I have finally put
together a group of people that are dedicated to the project. We suspect to
have it up and running this month.

I just updated two machines today from CentOS 5.2 to 5.3.  In both 
cases the update created /etc/pam.d/system-auth.rpmnew.  The original 
file system-auth is a symbolic link to system-auth-ac.  system-auth-ac 
  is an auto-generated file created by authconfig.  Unsurprisingly, 
there are several lines that differ between system-auth-ac and 
system-auth.rpmnew.  Should I be concerned by this?  Should I rerun 
authconfig?  How have others handled this?

thanks,

you could rerun authconfig, but in general i just delete the .rpmnew as 
i'm cleaning things up.

Subject: [PLUG] Dirvish backups are using *far* too much space
Message-ID: <c834ec80904131420u33453f93u511407d614eaf95e@mail.gmail.com>

I started using Dirvish to manage backups of a couple important
directories at work in early March, and I just realized that the
nightly backups are taking up an enormous amount of space (about 30x
more than expected ;).

The vast majority of the content being backed up is static, but there
seems to be a fully copy of everything made each night.  (and our
backup server just ran out of space, so I don't think it's just my
eyes playing tricks on me.)

For example, my git_repos directory is about 48mb (total) and very,
very little has changed in there over the last month, yet running a du
on that vault gives me this:

$ du . -h --max-depth=1
12K	./dirvish
46M	./2009_02_10-1511
48M	./2009_03_05-1110
48M	./2009_03_06-0025
48M	./2009_03_07-0026
48M	./2009_03_08-0036
....


The dirvish set up is as follows:

--------------- /etc/dirvish/master.conf -------------------------------------

# /mnt/seabackup is an sshfs-mounted volume (the filesystem is ext3,
but that machine doesn't have dirvish installed, and I don't have root
on it):
bank:
	/mnt/seabackup/vaults

image-default: %Y_%m_%d-%H%M

log: gzip
index: gzip

# don't cross devices, just incase I mount something in home...
xdev: 0
expire-default: +3 months

# rsync-option is a list type:
rsync-option:
	--inplace

# Don't try to maintain permissions.  I don't have that kind of access
on seabackup.
permissions: 0

Runall:
	gnuwestlake-documents
	gnuwestlake-development
	gnuwestlake-git_repos
	gnuwestlake-workspace
	gnuwestlake-email
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each vault has a config like this:

client: gnuwestlake
tree: /home/rcreswick/git_repos/


I've compared the output of `stat` on a couple files in the dirvish
trees, and with the "real" files in my live file system, and they all
point to different inodes (is that the right way to check for
hardlinks?) and the access/modify/change times on the live files that
really haven't changed are much older than the corresponding time
stamps in the dirvish trees.  My googling so far hasn't turned
anything up, and #dirvish seems fairly dead.

Thanks!

Use rdiff-backup.  It rocks!

If sshfs supports hardlinks (a cursory search suggests that it doesn't) 
and "somefile" has not changed, then `stat 2009_02_10-1511/somefile` 
and `stat 2009_03_05-1110/somefile` should report the same inode and a 
link count of 2 (or more).  This inode will be a different number than 
on your live file system, but should be the same within the backup 
tree.

Actually, I think this is why I added the --inplace flag to dirvish.
Somehow that went past me without a second thought, even thought I
knew how dirvish/rsync was supposed to work when I set it up...

Looks like rdiff-backup is next on the list :)

Thanks!

I have been using pybackpack, a GUI front end for rdiff-backup. Works
pretty nice. 

Here is a link to the rediff-backup wiki, where there are links to GUI
front ends and other stuff.

   To add to the archival record, allow me to present the tool I've used for
a dozen years for both incremental and full backups to tape. (I do believe
it will back up to other media, too, but I use tapes for my backups.)

   The tool is called BRU and is now sold [desktop is free, at least for a
trial, I believe] by The Tolis Group <http://www.tolisgroup.com/>. It's not
free, but it has been a super-solid, reliable workhorse. I've restored
individual files, directories, and bare-metal restores to a new drive the
one time the main hard drive failed.

   Perhaps buying a solution is not attractive or justified for a personal
setup, but a reliable backup tool was what I required to migrate my business
computing to linux. As far as I'm concerned, for a business daily
incremental backups and weekly full backups are mission-critical. BRU has
never let me down.

   And, if you want to use tapes for backups, I can unequivocably recommend
the Tandberg SLR drives (other than the '5'). My SLR-60 has performed
flawlessly for 7 years now, and I do buy new tapes now and then. :-)

Subject: [PLUG] Possible Causes of Cron Inconsistencies
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0904140610220.31488@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I don't expect to find why cron jobs are no longer consistent here, but
would like to learn what _might_ cause such unpredictable behavior.

   The issue is one I've raised here before: the mail log summary report
produced by the shell script 1pdflogsumm.

   Quick recap: that shell script lives in /etc/cron.daily/ and worked
consistently until recently. In root's crontab is the command to run all
scripts in /etc/cron.daily at 04:40am. The three main scripts in that
directory are 0logwatch, 1pflogsumm, and logrotate. The first and third run
every day as they should. The second one became inconsistent.

   When I stopped getting daily mail log summaries (valued primarily to
identify false positive rejections based on overly-broad UCE rules), I added
a crontab command to run the script just after midnight each day.

   For a while I was seeing two summary reports in my mail box: the one
generated at 00:02am and the one generated at 04:40am. That held all last
week; I kept the early one because I'd rather have 2 reports than none.
Saturday through yesterday, neither report ran. Nor would it run if the
script was manually invoked. Strange.

   Today, the early report ran but not the one in /etc/cron.daily.

   I know enough about system and network administration after a dozen years
to keep things up and running most of the time, and to even fix many
problems ... particularly after I inadvertently break things. But, I
certainly don't have sufficient insight to have any ideas why such
inconsistent behavior might occur. It makes no sense to me that two scripts
in /etc/cron.daily are run every day, but one no longer does. Nor why an
explicit invocation of that script from a separate command in crontab
sometimes runs, and sometimes doesn't. The shell script sets up variables
then calls /usr/local/bin/pflogsumm, a perl script. I upgraded that script
but it makes no difference.

   While I don't expect to actually be able to solve this weirdness, I would
like to understand how it possibly might occur. Your thoughts, ideas,
speculation, whatever are encouraged.

First, if it won't run manually, then you've got a better chance of 
figuring it out. Run it in strace to see if the error is visible:

   strace -o /tmp/pflogsumm.trace /usr/local/bin/pflogsumm

The output of strace is cryptic, but the failure should be visible.

Second, I've seen some new cron namespace restrictions recently. I 
doubt they apply in your case, but I'll alert you anyway, just in 
case.

I assume that the stuff in /etc/cron.daily is launched via a utility 
called run-parts. If so, check the manpage. The new Debian version of 
run-parts places restrictions on the names of scripts that can be run. 
My centrally managed cron scripts all have a .cron filename extension, 
but that violates the new restrictions so they wouldn't run on Debian. 
Wierd.

Third, some versions of run-parts can be run from the command line in 
a test mode and report what programs it thinks it should run, e.g.,

   run-parts --test /etc/cron.daily

Fourth, you can always try putting a bunch of "print STDERR ..." stuff 
in your Perl script to see how far it gets. :-)

You should understand that dirvish uses hard links to "duplicate"
copies of files that are identical in time.  Files that make
small changes over time are not identical, and this includes
accumulating log files, databases, git repositories, etc.  Change
one byte in the binary glob that represents a git repository, and
it is a "new" file.

Yes, there are tools like rdiff-backup that compute and store the
differences between files.  This uses less room.  But before using
any backup tool, contemplate the end goal.  The goal is /not/ to
make /backups/, but to make occasional /restores/.  And what are
you restoring, under what conditions?  Sometimes it is a damaged
file, sometimes it is hacker damage, sometime it is a zapped disk.
Often, you want to get at the version of a file made three weeks
ago, not last night's version.  Sometimes, the same problem that
damaged your original can damaged your backup copy (if they are
both mounted and online).  

In all these cases, every restore is /unplanned/, and occurs at
times when you are busy and haven't set aside time to recover a
file or rebuild a disk.  The major advantage of a tool like 
dirvish is that the images are complete file systems, ready to
copy onto a hard drive.  The backups are searchable and executable
file systems.  And if you manage your data correctly, you can get
a heck of a lot of images onto a large hard drive ( 1500GB hard
drives cost less than $120 on sale).  

But backups will have special cases, usually involving binary
blobs like vmware images and databases.  Often those already 
have "backup nature", the current copy already contains the old
copies, so you don't need more than one copy (plus a few 
redundant copies).  For that you can use the dirvish "expire"
feature, aggressively, in a different vault.  I have a "binary
glob" directory on my system disk with soft links to these big
files, and exclude them from the main backups.  That glob 
directory is stored in a separate vault, and expired after a
few days.
  
With tools like rdiff-backup, you get the daily copies, but
the files are not stored as a file system and not executable,
so they are typically restored manually one by one.  This is
an option for people with inconsequential lives, who aren't
delaying anything important by spending an occasional day or
two rebuilding hard drives. 

Personally, I go for big drives and appropriate backup strategies,
so that restores can be done with a few lines of commands,
possibly restoring vaults from a mix of times.   After a
belatedly discovered system compromise, or more likely a botched
update, I can restore yesterday's user files and last month's
system binaries.

IMHO, no backup system is designed correctly, as a pre-restore
system.  Whatever way you go, there will be inconveniences and
compromises, because these systems are designed to packrat data,
not recover the right data to the right places, in a hurry.  
Whatever backup system you choose, you should test your restore 
procedure onto a blank hard drive (which you should have handy,
just in case), and make your decisions based on how easily that
goes.  Otherwise, backups are just a religious ritual, not a
prudent preparation for future restores.

Paul,

   I mis-communiated the location of the problem. /usr/local/bin/pflogsumm
runs. It is normally called by /etc/cron.daily/1pflogsumm which is a shell
script that defines the variables (e.g., time period, log file location) for
the perl script.

   My cron scripts do not have extensions. And the inconsitency when scripts
run and when they won't suggests the issue is not as simple as a run-parts
namespace change. Unfortunately.

   T'ain't the perl script, but the shell script.

   After initially reading this message of yours, I manually invoked
/etc/cron.daily/1pflogsumm from within a virtual console. Today it ran and
mailed me the report. Yesterday it would not run when I tried the same
thing.

   Screwy, eh? Perhaps it's related to the state of the economy?

ah, then you should start the debugging there.  add a "set -x" to the
top of the shell script to get verbose output of every command that
runs.  i bet you see that some variable is not being set as expected
or some 'setup' part of things is failing and causing the script to
"finish" early, before calling the perl script.

useful manually as well as via cron (as long as your cron daemon mails
output from programs to you instead of discarding them to /dev/null or
similar).

Topic:      Server Sky - Data Centers in Orbit
Speaker:    Keith Lofstrom

Large data may soon consume 50MW or more of electrical energy.  The EPA
estimated US data center power consumption in 2006 at 60 billion
kilowatt
hours, or 1.5% of total US power consumption, and predicts a doubling by
2011. This will have huge environmental, social, and economic
consequences
unless we find alternative ways to power our digital economy.

Server sky is a proposal to build large dispersed arrays of ultralight
solar powered server satellites and launch them into 6400km equatorial
earth orbits, between the inner and outer Van Allen belts.   There is
room in these orbits for billions of server-sats.

A 30 gram server-sat consists of a thinned 12 inch solar cell, with
power efficient processors, solid state memory, and microwave
transceivers bonded to the edges. Thousands of server-sats position
themselves into dozens of dispersed three dimensional arrays (hundreds
of meters on a side) using light pressure for thrust and liquid-crystal
shutters for trimtab steering.  A server-sat array acts as a large
phased array antenna, permitting it to steer thousands of communication
beams at receiving stations and communities under its position in orbit,
handing off communication and control to the server-sat arrays that
follow it in orbit.

Earth can return to what it is good at ? green and growing things ?
while
space can be filled with gray and computing things.  More information at

Cool.

I am working on a speaker for May.  I have been talking to the
"department of speakers" for Intel.

Any particular topics people are interested in?  Intel compilers? Intel
libraries? Specific techniques? (Or whatever I can get.)

I am going to see whao and what will be available for that date.

Hello all -

I am looking for Linux program(s) that will allow me to:

Other ideas on this subject are welcome.

Chris,

   This supposes that a variable is set sometimes and not all the time.

   Today's results suggest it's a lot more complex. This morning, my INBOX
had the report mailed after the 00:02am run, but not the report for a
scheduled run at 04:40am. But, when I manually invoked the shell script from
the command line about 10:15am, it ran, too.

   That's why I wrote it's such a perplexing situation. There appears to be
no rhyme or reason to predict when it will work properly and when it won't.
Annoying.

Thanks,

Rich

while that was my guess as to what's wrong, "set -x" will debug a
plethora of problems.  it's free--won't change the behavior of the
script, just runs an x-ray on what it's doing, if you will.  comparing
a non-working output to a working output will almost certainly
illuminate the differences in the runs.  don't know that you were
resisting the suggestion, but it's the clear next step in debugging
this IMNSHO--it's like the doctor saying "hmm, you're constipated...we
could look inside or we could scratch our heads some more because it
is not normal for you to be constipated" =)

a lot of those scripts don't produce output at all (no email) if there is 
nothing to report.  could it be that between your 0002 run and 0440 that 
nothing of interest has happened, so you don't get any email?

All of the above! Although IIRC some of their advanced performance
engineering tools are not open source and not even free as in beer.
How about Moblin? That's open source, I think, and getting a lot of
buzz.

   OK. I just made the addition and manually ran /etc/cron.daily/1pflogsumm.
Output is below (and it was successful):

   Now, if it doesn't run tonight (while I'm logged off the system), where
will this stdout information end up? Shouldn't I redirect it to a disk file?

Thanks,

Joe,

   No, that's not what happens. Usually a bunch of mail comes in (or tries
to) between the two and I see the difference when both reports show up. But,
even if there are no new messages, the report is run against the contents of
/var/log/maillog and sent to me and I'd see the same report twice.

Thanks,

Rich

depends on the configuration of the crontab.
Also the crontab doesn't have the same parsing capability as
as Bash, so

will get stderr and stdout to the file.

I tried to recruit someone in Intel's wifi driver group a year or so
ago, because we had just had an intel e100/e1000 driver dude talk and
because she used to be involved in PTP and her name started popping up
on the linux-wireless mailing list.  At the time she had just joined
the group and begged off.  Anyone from their wifi driver effort would
be good.

My Intel wifi used to be a problem, but has finally settled down with
Intrepid. Wifi is always good as a topic because it is such a PITA,
even Intel.

I've been playing with it for a week or so. It seems to be in
reasonable shape -- not too many crashes, no data loss (yet). But I
can't get past the hideous color scheme ... Ubuntu brown and orange.
So I'm sticking with openSUSE for the moment. But I'm going to put the
Xubuntu version on my ancient 512 MB laptop just to see what happens.
:)

I also tried the Fedora 11 beta. It's more or less a disaster at the
moment. It sent a kernel oops to the mother ship in the process of
attempting an install, and it blew up trying to format a partition
after that. And it looked to me like the (Gnome) LiveCD didn't even
have Open Office on it!

   Here's why this is so frustrating: this morning both invocations of
/etc/cron.daily/1pflogsumm ran with reports mailed to my INBOX. And, I
received the mail with the log file from adding 'set -x' to the top of the
script.

   Therefore, nothing to see here. It all worked. But, that's not to conclude
tomorrow's results will be the same.

   Ah, well. Guess I need to learn to live with it.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0904150615340.16095@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Here's another strange situation that I've not seen before, BUT ... I
found the solution and will share it here in case someone else has the
problem.

   In brief: tty1 had no cursor. I could type on it but had no idea of the
cursor's position. There was also no cursor in text-based applications
invoked on that terminal.

   Google searches with variants of the search string found a hit that
explained what might have happened and gave the solution.

   Apparently, trying to cat a binary file or doing other unusual things can
upset the terminal and cause the cursor to be lost. The solution is to log
in on that terminal and type 'reset' (without the quotes, of course) to
restore the setterm values, including the missing cursor.

Oh snap, I see what you are saying, the download links appear to be 
broken.  What a shame.  So sorry everyone.  I got so caught up 
downloading I forgot to test out what had been downloaded.

you just leave the set -x in place and eventually it fails, and you
compare the output to a working run.  no need to live with it not
working--just live with it working for the moment =)

Moblin could be interesting. Not certain how much I can talk on that due
to NDA issues.  (I am on that project at the moment.)

Weird. Fedora 11 has been pretty stable for me. (And my laptop has known
problems with recent kernels.)

Try running memtest86 on your machine and see if your memory is stable.
I would also try to get a hardware report out to the Fedora people if
you can.

I assume you're talking about Ubuntu?

You can change the color scheme, you know.

My old 512MB laptop really didn't like the change from Ubuntu 8.04 to
8.10; I haven't decided yet whether I want to go back to 8.04 or forward
to the latest Xbuntu -- I should just install it and play, I suppose.

There were two problems. The first one was a kernel oops, which the
system posted to the appropriate place on line for me! Bad news --
kernel oops. Good news -- it automatically told the right people about
it. :)

The second problem was a bit uglier, and I didn't take the time to
troubleshoot it. I was attempting to quad-boot my workstation
(openSUSE, Gentoo, Ubuntu and Fedora). I booted the Fedora LiveCD
first, and laid out all the partitions (four /boot, one swap, four
root, and one /home). Fedora got into the install but croaked
somewhere in the partitioning process. So I dropped plans to put
Fedora on the workstation as a quad-boot. I'm going to put it on my
ancient laptop instead.

I did have the workstation dual-booted openSUSE and Ubuntu for a
couple of hours, but I couldn't get the bootloader conflicts resolved.
So I am now back to openSUSE and will be building virtual machines for
the others instead. I can beta test everything in guests. :) I may
switch the main host to Ubuntu after it goes stable, though, since the
main thing I want to have is virtualized hosting and I think Ubuntu is
further ahead in that area than openSUSE.

Yeah ... but with openSUSE it comes in a color I like out of the box. :)

I've been able to run Gnome just fine in my 512 MB laptop, but it's
much snappier with WindowMaker. I liked XFCE 4.2 but 4.4 is a bit
"heavy" for me. :) But I think I'm going to put Fedora on the 512 just
so I have a Fedora machine to play with. I'm doing a lot of stuff
these days that needs to work on Ubuntu, Fedora and openSUSE, and it
helps to have all of them available.

   Ooh! How slick that is. I don't know perl so I thank you very much for an
exceptionally fine and useful tool. The one addition to make on the command
line is to redirect the output to another file.

My sed-fu was deficient I guess (or my sed was) so I fell back to perl:

If you want word-case
perl -pe 's/ \b (\w) ([^\s]+) \b /\1\L\2/gx'

# ONE COMPANY  -> One Company (rather than One company)

Message-ID: <1239847122.3297.33.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

My dad has a Fedora 9 box and a Windows 2000 box.

His Windows 2000 box has dual PIII 750 mhz processors.
This box has a gig of ram, but it's PC100 ram.  TurboTax
will not work on Windows 2000 anymore.  Will WINE support
TurboTax?  How about Crossover Linux?

Windows XP is a pain in the tushy because support officially
ended yesterday and worse than that it still costs the same
that it did when it first came out.  Has Microsoft heard of 
depreciation?

His Linux box is comparable to mine, an Intel D845PEBT2 
Pentium 4 system.  I have Windows XP upgrade sitting on 
the shelf that I could use to build a virtual machine I 
suppose...  wish I didn't have to go through the blankety
blank activation.  It is actually installed on a 500 mhz
machine, but that machine hasn't been turned on for a very
long time.

I'd like a solution that doesn't involve Microsoft Windows 
at all, but short of Intuit releasing a Linux version of 
TurboTax that might not be possible.

A solution that involves WINE or a Linux version of TurboTax 
is preferable, but if I have to set up a Windows XP VM I have 
to.

There may be a way with sed an tr, but off the top of my head the perl
function uc will return values in uppercase...

Rich,

I see else where in this thread that you have your solution but let me
propose another way to arrive at a solution.

You can use emacs to interactively record a macro for this purpose.
In fact, since I prefer programming by demonstration for these sorts
of tasks I usually use emacs and teach it what to do.

Open the file in question.  Then type C-x C-(, this will begin
recording a macro.  Then hit C-a for beginning of line, M-c, or M-x
capitalize-word, then hit C-n for the next line.  Now type C-x C-) to
end the macro.  You can now repeat this macro with C-u N C-x C-e,
where N is the number of times you want to execute the macro.  Or just
C-x C-e if you want to run the macro once.  After you memorize the
basic dance of creating a line by line macro the only hard part is
figuring out what commands to do in the middle, M-x capitalize-word in
this case.  But, the nice part is you get a fairly general formula for
text manipulation that takes just a few minutes to apply -- and you
don't have to learn a programming language if you don't want to.

I hope you find this useful in the future.

Or, if that url gets broken go to http://turbotax.com and just use the

Jason,

   Now this is a really good thing to know. I've not before used macros in
emacs; never had the occassion to do so.

> I hope you find this useful in the future.

   I'm certain that I will. I do a lot of writing in emacs and use it for web
page creation/maintenance (xhtml), python coding, and LaTeX/PSTricks.

IIF you have Flash installed.  Last year it wasn't needed.  This 
year's gratuitous Turbotax change was to require Flash.  $#%@#%$!!!!! 
  If I didn't have such a long history with Turbotax, I'd evaluate 
other vendors.

I have a Samsung All in One color laser printer with ADF and it is quite
happy to scan to multi-page PDF/TIFF and e-mail the results which works
pretty well without any drivers being required.  I guess it also supports
scanning to CIFS/SMB shares but I haven't bothered to mess with it since I
don't really need to scan that often.

Grub stores the actual physical locations of the datablocks of it's stage
1.5 or stage 2 files in the bootblock.  If you restore from a tar archive
the location of the blocks for the grub stage files will almost certainly be
different and as a result grub will generate an error 15 because it can't
find them.

After restoring from a tar archive you need to chroot into the newly
restored filesystem and run a grub-install to cause the restored system to
write the grub stage file locations to the boot block.

Or you can restore grub from the grub command.  If my memory serves the
commands would look something like this (assuming your /boot filesystem
(hd0,1) and you want the boot block on the first hard disk:
root (hd0,1)
setup (hd0)

I also tend to take Jason's approach unless I have more than 2 files
that need the same manipulations.

Just to add -- once you've developed a functional macro that you think
you'll need again:

M-x name-last-kbd-macro   to give it a name

(now you can run it by name too, if you want -- it's just like any
other emacs function now that it has a name! eg: M-x myMacro)

Then, if you want to save it, just pop open your .emacs and run:

M-x insert-kbd-macro

It will prompt you for the name, and then write it out at the point,
and every new emacs session will have access to that as a new
function.  (so you can do things like bind it to a keystroke, rename
it, use it in new macros, even edit it if you're incredibly brave ;)

They offer a Linux version, but I can't tell if this is tax software or
not.  Yes my taxes are filed, but I'm thinking about the future.

Subject: [PLUG] Make some tax software...
Message-ID: <1239855051.3297.52.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

Tax software that is good needs to ask intelligent questions and using
the answers to them fill out the appropriate forms.  To achieve that,
you need a programmer obviously to write the software and a certified
public accountant specializing in tax to come up with both the
questions, the calculations, and the proper forms.

What would be involved if hypothetically someone on this list started
a successful tax software company that focused on Linux as the platform?
What language would be most appropriate to write the tax software in?
What tool sets are most likely to be the same across all versions of
Linux that are out there in the wild?  I wonder what people who have 
a background in tax and/or writing financial software think.

There are a lot of choices as far as programming languages.  There is: 
C, C++, Perl, Python, Ruby on Rails, Cobol, Java, Lisp, etcetera.  The
list could probably be arbitrarily long and some languages probably
make sense where others don't.  Here are at least my thoughts on
a language making sense:

1)  It is relatively stable, the portions of the language I use today
    will be implemented equally across all Linux distributions and for
    some time out into the future.

2)  It is particularly well suited to database applications, after all
    a tax preparation program is a sort of database program.

3)  A language that allows easy access to external databases and 
    spreadsheets.  I don't know what the equivalent to Quicken is,
    but it would be nice to be able to import the ol checkbook, 
    etcetera.

Please feel free to discuss what it will take to make a Linux based tax
preparation package.  Hopefully, a lively discussion that brings out
some good ideas will inspire someone someday soon to address the
shortage of Linux based tax preparation software.

It would be nice to see tax modules added to ERP systems like SQL
Ledger.  You already enter all your financial data into the ERP
system.  Why enter it again somewhere else?

I like Common Lisp for any accounting software because it stores
numbers to arbitrary precision.

Most often, you will find that accounting system math involves storing
numbers as strings at some stage.  The old concept of binary coded
decimal is not far removed from the string storage concept.  Both
systems preserve all the decimal digits of the number.  Some handy
Common Lisp functions for converting between strings and numbers:

(defun string-to-real (string-rep)
   "Converts a string representation of a number to a rational
representation.  For some reason, the lisp community calls rational
numbers `real'."
   (let* ((string-parts (ppcre:split "\\." (string-trim '(#\Space #\Tab) string-rep)))
          (integer-portion (parse-integer (car string-parts) :junk-allowed t))
          (fractional-portion (if (= (length string-parts) 1)
                                  0
                                  (parse-integer (cadr string-parts) :junk-allowed t)))
          (fractional-divisor (if (= (length string-parts) 1)
                                  1
                                  (expt 10 (length (cadr string-parts))))))
     (+ integer-portion (/ fractional-portion fractional-divisor))))

(defun real-to-string (real-rep &key (places 2))
   "Converts a rational representaion of a number into a string
representation, rounded to `places' decimal places."
   (if real-rep
       (if (= places 0)
           (format nil "~a" (parse-integer (format nil "~,2f" real-rep) :junk-allowed t))
           (format nil
               (format nil "~~,~af" places)
               (coerce real-rep 'long-float)))
       nil))

(defun double-to-real (double-rep &key (places 2))
   "Converts a double to a real.  It does this by converting the double
to a string, and then the string to a real.  Decimal place truncation
happens when converting to a string."
   (string-to-real (real-to-string double-rep :places places)))

(defun pad-with-zeros (string-rep places)
   "Left-pads a string representaion of a number with leading zeros to
make it the specified length."
   (loop for i from (+ (length string-rep) 1) to places do
        (setf string-rep (format nil "0~a" string-rep)))
   string-rep)

Thoughts:

You're going to spend a lot more time and money on domain experts than you
will on a programming language, particularly when you get to addressing
all the state taxes and potentially the regional (i.e. TriMet).

Instead of "for Linux", perhaps you should think of "for Linux and
Windows", or "for anything".  I was thinking of this the other day, and it
occurred to me that you could even make it open source and still make
money -- just license the framework under GPL, but charge for the
databases that embody all the tax laws.

Java would be a good candidate for meeting the above criteria, although
there are a lot of really good cross-platform tools in a lot of really
good programming languages.

At least with the online version, after you complete your taxes it 
drops you into a short survey.  I definitely let them know my opinion 
regarding the Flash requirement.

While we're on the general subject of accounting software:

I'm looking for a good, possibly simpler, replacement for Peachtree. 
Basically I'm looking for something that's good for a business that has
three to five active customers at any one time.  I mostly need to track
invoices, customer accounts, expenses and a general ledger.  Being able to
extract reports would be a nice feature.  It shouldn't need a full-time
accountant or programmer to keep things perking along.

Suggestions?

You might check out LedgerSMB. It might be overkill, but it's a nice
solid package written mostly in Perl and using PostgreSQL as the back
end.

A fair number of the developers are in the Portland area, which is a
bonus. If I ever need something beyond a spreadsheet, that's what I
plan on getting.

I'm not sure if one of your requirements is that it's opensource but...
There is some excellent web based accounting software out there.

My personal favorite is LessAccounting (http://lessaccounting.com),
they have a free account that works fantastic for my low volume.

The eye is wonderfully adaptive.  After a few minutes, nobody noticed
that all the white letters were orange.  I usually do my presentations
with white/yellow/gray lettering on a dark bluish background (actually,
SUN1=#333366 ), so I picked the right color combination to work with
an orange wall.  However, future talks with the usual black lettering
on a white background may not fare so well.

We started the presentation at 730 tonight, around twilight, and
the room was dark by the time I was done.  As midsummer approaches,
it will be light a lot longer into the evening, and that will
accentuate the wall color problem.

So ... how to deal with this for the "average" talk at future AT
presentations?  I can project an 8 foot wide image on that orange
wall, or I can bring my portable 5 foot wide screen and set it up
on a table.  Which image would people rather see at Advanced Topics?

Would it not be easier to simple hang a white sheet?  That way, you do
not have to bring a portable screen and you can cover more than a 8
foot wide area.  Just a thought.

Except turbo tax is trying to move away from linux compatibility. There 
is another thread on this list where people are complaining about the 
flash requirement of turbo tax. Flash doesn't bother me so much (though 
I'd prefer to be without it) but I've used turbo tax online since I 
first migrated to linux about 3 years ago (and used the install version 
before that). This year though I had to use the 'user agent switcher' to 
spoof turbo tax into thinking I was running IE on windows in order for 
it to let me in. The fact that everything worked perfectly without any 
problems using firefox on ubuntu really bothers me though. I'll accept 
the fact that many companies aren't interested in the linux market and 
don't bother making stuff for linux, but when you have something that 
*is* compatible with linux and you go out of your way to try to make it 
incompatible (and fail at that even), well... it becomes time for me to 
look for another tax service (online or not) which I did this year. I 
would have felt a little better if I had gotten an error or something 
while using turbo tax online (would have meant there was a real reason 
to not use linux with their service) but I successfully used everything 
up to the point where my taxes were ready to be filed and they wanted me 
to pay for the service, I then decided to cancel and go elsewhere at 
that point. Making a FOSS tax program wouldn't be too hard, especially 
since the USA is big enough and it would benefit so many people there 
are bound to be enough volunteers. The problem (as mentioned previously) 
is that in addition to federal taxes you have 50 states with their own 
tax laws along with the unknown number of counties/cities/whatever as 
well. All of these will change from time to time and need constant 
updating. While the USA as a whole is probably big enough to draw enough 
volunteers to keep federal up to date anything below that will probably 
not be kept current or accurate. The only way I see something like this 
working is if the FOSS community built a framework program (as mentioned 
in previous Emails) that connected to a government maintained publicly 
available database which stores information on all taxes at all levels 
of government. This way whenever taxes change due to laws being passed 
the database is just updated and the program can calculate your taxes 
correctly. This way the developers can focus on making certain the 
program remained compatible with the database and interface issues (how 
questions are asked to the user, etc.). Sadly I don't see our government 
being willing to maintaining a database like this even though it would 
help avoid confusion with understanding/calculating taxes even if you 
didn't use our hypothetical FOSS tax program.

A sheet will always be wavy because the material is not stiff enough.

Hauling around a screen is a PITA. I wonder if Roots would be willing
to put up a white board on that wall. Are we the only group that uses
the room? Could they get more business from group meetings if they
adapted the room a bit?

Better late than never but TT DOES work with Win2K this year. As
mentioned, the only hitch is installing flash.

The warning after installing says NEXT year you'll have to use
something better than W2K.

LessAccounting sounds interesting. Even the name appeals to me. 'Cause
bookkeeping work sucks.

However most of the screenshot images on lessaccounting.com produced
only a gray box in Firefox 3.something on my up to date Intrepid x86_64
computer. I do have problems with flash quitting, requiring me to
restart Firefox to get it working again. I usually don't bother, 'cause
flash also generally sucks. If LessAccounting requires flash I am
disimpressed.

I more or less gave in to installing flash-nonfree on Debian.

I just checked that it worked with the flash plugin disabled and it
does. I'm fairly sure the only place they are using flash is on their
movie page: http://lessaccounting.com/movie.html.

I can't suggest them enough. The reason I'm vocal about it is the
support, you can Contact Steve or Allan (The two guys that run it) and
they respond almost instantly and have always provided great service.

Consider this:

When marketing a product, testing costs. Each browser, OS, version,  
locale, etc. is another permutation which requires a full test suite  
pass. One of the problems (from one perspective) linux has at the  
moment that does not plaque Windows nor OS X is that each distribution  
is considered a different OS. In general people making the decisions  
don't see 'Linux Compatible' the same as Redhat Compatible, or Debian  
Compatible.

When I worked at a software company that marketed products on Windows  
and *nix, we tested on both Redhat and SuSE, and then still had  
customers who would not buy unless we stated it was also tested on the  
distribution they ran.

So, when it comes down to dollars, they test on the combination that  
they can afford to test on. To state it works on Linux when it hasn't  
been tested on it, would be a lie, and easy to prove. Intuit is a for  
profit company, and if they can't prove the return on investment, they  
have to do something. Unfortunately, it appears they chose to cut  
support.

I finally decided to restart Firefox to get flash working again. (It
will work for a few hours to a few days before it quits again.) I
wathed the flash videos on lessaccounting.com, but some of the other
windows were still gray boxes, e.g., the Contacts and Business Settings
boxes on http://lessaccounting.com/movie.html. 

What I really wanted to find out is what it means when it says about
the freebie account "limited use of invoices and expenses, accounting
reports."

Really?  I just read the warning, clicked the continue (or equiv button) and
went about my business.  No lies needed at that part of the tax prep process.

The complaint I have about TT web is that it doesn't allow access to the Forms
view that stand alone TT has.  So when Nustar Energy's K-1 had a problem (a
one dollar allocation of income between domestic and foreign sources, with NO
tax affect) TT wouldn't let me file the return until I corrected the error,
but I didn't have access to the form to correct the error.

Growl.  Fortunately I did find a work around and am glad I understand the
accounting concept of "material."

And Cheers to Rivermark CU - when I couldn't find my 1098 (mortgage interest
statement) they called back with the numbers.  But Wait!  I'd origially left a
message asking for help and then called back to say "found it."  After
listening to both calls they called me anyway with the numbers just in case. 
Nice service.

That's odd.  I had to do that last year (when filing for 2007) but I
did *not* have to do anything like that this year (using a different
computer -- and ubuntu vs. debian).  I also did my taxes in late Jan.
though, so maybe they changed it (hey, that might not be a *horrible*
way to cut down on customer service requests.  If you're savvy enough
to install a user-agent switcher, then you probably won't have issues
printing...)

Regarding flash:  I decided that I have no grounds to denigrate flash
apps until I can trivially write a javascript UI that works equally
well on all platforms.

And what does that long history do for you?

On the flip side of requiring flash this year it was possible to skip all
their dialogs and just hit the sections you wanted to.  Major time and
aggravation saver until it started suggesting an upgrade to Premium because I
had stock sales to record.

Maybe other people have had better success with TurboTax and Quicken via 
Wine or Crossover but I fought for days trying to get either of them to 
work correctly in either environment.  They would both install without 
issue and sometimes start but there was always some type of problem that 
would surface and make the program unusable.  I downloaded every 
possible add on using Winetricks to see if it would address the buggy 
issues but the problems continued.  My ultimate, and unfortunate 
solution was to VirtualBox a Windows XP install for the programs and at 
that point they worked flawlessly. 

I hope that others had more success.  I am still pretty steamed over the 
incompatibility issues with those programs and that I was never totally 
successful at getting them to run flawlessly on a Linux platform.

Okay, what in general over the 100s of Linux distributions is the same?
I'm probably not a good enough programmer, but I want to get a project
started to replace TurboTax and I like the idea of making an open source
framework for it.  Ideally, this program should only need X and a gui
toolkit that has been around since a long time ago.  It should work if
you are using TWM or FVWM or ICEWM and not be gnome or kde dependent.

My sister used to work for Chipsoft, the company that originally 
developed Turbotax.  She then worked for Intuit after they bought 
Chipsoft.  She uses the pro series product, so I always send her my 
tax file so she can review it for errors.  I've used Turbotax since 
TY1990.  I've run it under dos, dosemu, W95, possibly wine, os 9, 
possibly os X, and finally the online version.  Ignoring the flash 
issue, the online edition has certainly simplified things.  No more 
lengthy downloads and updates, no more messing with emulation, and 
importing the previous year's data is easy.  That said, it's still one 
of those love/hate relationships.

Perhaps the concept of "long history" alludes to the psychological 
tactics that Intuit employs in order to keep their customers eternally 
locked into their upgrade cycle.

Can your sister reveal anything about how TurboTax was programmed 
when she worked at Chipsoft?  What language was it based on?  Could 
she be part of a project to replace it with a Linux friendly version?
If we can get some people together and possibly hook up with
sourceforge, maybe by next year there can be an alternative to
TurboTax.

Subject: [PLUG] Newby looking for GUI/PUTTY help
Message-ID: <BAY135-DAV51A958C3BC1AA397D3CC48F7A0@phx.gbl>

HI Guys,

I am looking for a way to use my Fedora 10 machine from my Windows Vista
machine.  Currently, I am using Putty to get into the command line interface
of the Fedora box, which is fine as far as it goes.

But I would like to be able to have the equivalent of a remote desktop for
the Fedora box running on my Vista machine so I can use Fedora's GUI
interface from the Vista machine.

Why?  Well, frankly, the windows machine has a much better screen, mouse,
keyboard, desk.  Well, you get the idea.  Also, the "remote desktop" part is
really handy.

I looked at Xming as my X windows software, with PUTTY, but that seemed like
it had a very steep learning curve. Freeware is important for this
home/student project.  Any and all suggestions will be appreciated!

Thanks,

Tom

FWIW, I used a pencil and occasionally added and subtracted and
multiplied using my preferred calculator, GNU CLISP.  When I had
pencilled everything in, I filled in the forms with the fillable PDF's
provided by the various taxing agencies.

And btw, I was slightly stunned that my overall federal income tax
rate on adjusted gross income was just 4.62% in 2008 (and that doesn't
even count the stimulus check we got last summer).

the quickest was is vnc.  run vncserver on the linux box and then connect 
with vnc from windows.  i don't know if fedora will default to a full 
desktop or simple one, but after you've run vncserver once you can edit 
.vnc/xstartup and easily have it start the full deal.

i'd use VNC.  the windows vnc client handled fullscreen remote desktop
usage really well last time i had to use windows as a front-end.
which was 7 years ago.  i can't imagine it's become less capable in
the interim =)

i'd recommend tightvnc over realvnc, but both are freely downloadable.
 and there may be an even fancier one that i don't know about.

A white painted area for projection would be good, above the "fingerprint
zone".  They  probably painted the wall orange because the white wall
looked messy, and orange doesn't show dirt very well.  Venues such as
McMenamins invest in real roll-up screens for a reason; it keeps the
projection surface out of harm's way during food fights or equivalent.  

While shopping for screens, I learned that there is a lot of engineering
that goes into a projection screen.  They are designed to reflect light
evenly over specific ranges of angles and not others.  Light from an
off axis open door won't shine into the audience.  Projection light is
not wasted on ceilings and walls.  On older screens, this is done with
tiny glass beads in a white paint matrix.  On newer screens, an
engineered plastic surface does the same thing.  This means that a
projector with limited lumen output (mine is 1100 lumens) can project
a visible image on a larger surface.  And that is why people spend
hundreds of dollars on a good Da-Lite screen.

The threads in a sheet don't do that, even if the sheet was stretched
in a frame to make it flat.  A wall painted with "screen paint" is
better, but not as good as a properly designed real screen.

A used projection screen might be OK, but buyers should be aware that
aging "paint and bead" surfaces turn yellow and lose their adhesion. 
They are almost impossible to clean - most cleaning products discolor
the paint.  And over the years, stuff gets thrown at them, so a lot
of the old ones have stains.  That is how Da-Lite stays in business.

All that to deliver photons to a few eyeballs.  In "The Wonderful
World of the Future" (tm), maybe we won't have screens.  Instead,
multibeam projection systems will send out small beams of photons
to converge on each of the pairs of retinas in the room, without
wasting light on all the other surfaces.  Of course, it might be
even cheaper to rewire audience brain neurons, so they are left with
the same experience as viewing a slide show or movie or whatever
("Would you like your movie memory to have popcorn in it, and do
you want to remember real buttery taste?  That will be $7 extra").  

To make this on topic, would somebody write a Linux app for this? :-)

So long as we're flaunting our ludditeness,  I also use a pencil and paper.
But I do the addition and subtraction on an abacus (quicker than a calculator)
and check it in my head with the rule of nines.

Once, years ago, I tried using a web-based tax service, one in which you just
answered questions and it did all of the computations for you.  But the answer
that it came up with was obviously wrong (ie, much different from the taxes
that I'd paid the previous year).  And it wouldn't show me what it had
filled out
in the schedules so I couldn't tell where the problem was.  So I went back to
pencil and paper.

Right, the benefit of using TT over competition in year N is the ability to
import data from year N-1.

One of things I didn't do after selling patch.com is update my information
with TT. So I couldn't log in with the account I used last year (remember that
password?  HA!) and the password recovery mechanism depends on sending email
to the address on record.

I couldn't do the hyper easy import of data from last year.  It took less than
then minutes to retype the information, even waiting for the flash laden
screens to refresh.

So what does that long history do for you in TY N+1 ?

and configure your remote access rules.  You'll also need to create a 
firewall rule to allow the connection (I assume you understand the 
liability of opening a remote desktop port on the host's firewall):

iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 5900 -j ACCEPT

At the risk of repeating other fine suggestions ...

Xmimg and putty wouldn't get you the full desktop anyway.

Consider VNC or one of its ilk.  Full *nix desktop as a window on the host
machine.  It can work in either direction ...

You can load up x11vnc to get at the displayed desktop.  Fedora has
remote desktop support
built in but it is not the same as the local display.

if you are really lucky, you can lock that iptables rule down even 
further if you have a single source address that will be accessing the 
remote desktop

iptables -A INPUT -p TCP -s xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx --dport 5900 -j ACCEPT

Or you can use SSH tunneling and start a new X11 session on the remote
host and avoid adding a new firewall rule.  IIRC, it's fairly easy to
forward ports over ssh.  When you get to your remote machine, just use
the Xvnc command with a display argument (e.g. "$ Xvnc :2").

Then when you start the VNC client on your windows machine, you direct
it to the localhost (and the new port) with the local port and the
traffic goes through the ssh tunnel.

Our consulting accountant (who we pay for 1 hour to review our 
self-prepared return, and who usually saves us 2x his fee + the annual 
cost of TT, which is Schedule C and E deductible anyway) is a better 
TurboTax support tech than anyone employed by Intuit - he's helped me 
force TT to do my bidding in some relatively challenging scenarios (1031 
exchanges, odd depreciation allocations, Shcedule E loss 
carry-forwards,etc.).

My biggest beef w/TT (the download & install versions) is how much the 
ui/workflow changes from year to year - kind of gratuitous, and adds 
unnecessary overhead to what should be a fairly repetitive process... 
Yeah, running TT and Quicken on WinXP in VirtualBox is a bit 
distasteful, but works just fine.

Note that you want -I INPUT for most default redhat configs.  

Some versions of redhat have a rule inline to the INPUT table to do
rejections (instead of setting a default policy of reject and creating
ACCEPT rules).  If you add the ACCEPT after the global reject nothing
will happen.  

Below is a nearly default config for fc8.

Another path to the goal 

I did some more research about the  'dd' command (yes I am a newbie) and
that tool doesn't have tar's weakness in this area. Copying the entire
partition takes up ten times more space than just tar-ing the
individuals files but it is faster than my preferred bzip2 compression
format.  Once I starting studying disk partitions I realized that it was
better to install the / file system on one partition and  /home on a
separate partition. That way I could dd my / partition and tar my /home.
The default Ubuntu installation model places  / and /home on the same
partition so it took me some time and research to realize that manually
designating separate partitions for different parts of the file system
was more useful. 

Before using dd on /, I boot up with and run in the installation DVD
Gnome environment. That way I can access / as a dismounted partition
without worrying about file changes during a backup. 

When done,  I mount my /home partition as /media/disk-1 and tar that
one.The datablock location  problem you pointed out does not seem to be
an issue with my /home partition. As it isn't the active /home partition
for that live/installation environment, I assume there will be
minimal/no file changes while it's being tar-ed. Just to be sure I
created one dd /home partition backup to use in case I've missed
something. I'm sure I have and I trust someone will point it out.

With Windows I never needed to know anything about partitioning after
the installation partition selection choice. With Linux it appears I
won't get very far without an in-depth knowledge of disk geography and
the Linux tools used to work with storage media. The upside is that once
I learn the tools I can do things in different ways specific to a given
need. I prefer having more tools even though it can be frustrating to
want to do something I know other Linux users can do but I can't do
because I haven't learned enough about the process.  


Thanks again for the help & information. Linux is becoming more fun and
less a pain as I learn more.

Rich,

Another way to do it, that might make more sense based on how you think:

perl -ne 's/(\b\w)/{uc $1}/eg; print;' <FILENAME> > <NEWFILENAME>

  or if you'd just prefer to act on the existing file:

perl -i.orig -ne  's/(\b\w)/{uc $1}/eg; print;' <FILENAME>

  or if you don't need the backup file:

perl -i -ne 's/(\b\w)/{uc $1}/eg; print;' <FILENAME>

The explanations are:

-i      in-place edit, make a backup if you specify an extention
-n      loop over every line in a file
  e     treat what comes next as a perl program (in this case '...'

s/      substitute
(\b\w)  word bound and word character
/
{uc $1}  upper case the stuff matched inside ()
/e       treat the replacement not as a literal string but a mini-program
  g      globally, do it for every instance found

print    you understand this part

   Many thanks, Michael.

   The explanation of the perl options is very helpful; almost like regex/sed
but not quite.

I noticed that for some reason grub uses UUIDs to determine the location
of the kernel in the menu.lst. For some reason unknown to me, somebody
decided UUIds are preferable to the (hd0) notation I've come  know in
Windows boot.ini or the /dev/hda notation of lilo. It appears to me that
UUIds are not fixed attributes (e.g., like a serial number) of a given
piece of hardware or a reliable partition designation but change with
each installation. 

So if I install a new copy of Ubuntu Intrepid then try to put into place
the old / file system I previously tar-ed, there is a mismatch of UUIDs.
This may in fact be part of my difficulties in Intrepid restoring that
originated this thread. I think I may have installed a fresh copy of
Intrepid then tried to restore the previous / system,

Why did they migrate to UUIDs in grub?  What is the advantage? Can you
employ the other device notations in grub? Can lilo be used in Intrepid
instead? Or another boot loader?  

Thanks,

Can you post your grub.conf to the list?  I believe a bit of commentary
on your current config may offer great insight into your grub
challenges...

http://linuxshellaccount.blogspot.com/2008/08/how-to-manage-your-disk-by-uuid-on.html

Managing disks by UUID lets you specify which disk to use, even if the
loader's flavor-of-the-week -- or worse, the hardware -- decides to change
it.  When the USB gods decide to change your disk's position in the chain
at nearly every boot up, this can be a big help if you want to boot off a
thumb drive.

Managing disks by the /dev/hdxxx model lets you specify which disk
_position_ to use, so you can (for instance) swap your second drive in and
out, with all the advantages you cite.

poe tay toe, poe tah toe.

I don't know if Grub can be made to use the /dev/hdxxx notation; I
certainly hope it still can.

Yes it can. And I hope it always will be able to. When the user gets an
Error 15 there is no other way to tell Grub where to find the root
partition, unless you memorized your UUIDs or wrote them down before
the catastrophe. 

Word Wizard may also find the tune2fs command useful. For example, if
you want to find the UUID for /dev/hda2 you can do:

sudo tune2fs -l /dev/hda2

I understand that UUIDs have certain advantages over the user-friendly
notation. But I'd rather take my chances and have a menu.lst file that
I can actually read. But that's just me. [p??t?e??to?], [p??t??to?].

I sometimes do a quick image backup over the network after booting from a
livecd.  Compressing it on the host running dd keeps the network traffic
down.

dd if=/dev/hda | bzip2 -c | ssh foosystem "/bin/cat > /backup/diskimg.bz2"

Being a newbie (who sometimes lives in terror of what Linux can do if I
make mistake) I was fearful if possibly compressing a DD-ed partition
image might somehow corrupt something that would blow up all the
progress I've made. I realize that acquiring proficiency in Linux will
require accepting some serious screwups in the process but sometimes
going through the  reinstall process from the Intrepid distro DVD can
get tedious. Anyway, with hard disk storage being as cheap as it is
these days, the speed of a straight DD-ed image is more attractive than
a more time-consuming space-saving compressed version.

I'm trying to perfect a flawless backup model so I can play around,
break stuff, learn from my mistakes and eventually become proficient in
Linux administration. It helps to set up a reliable model of restoring
what worked well before I broke it. I suppose I could sign up for
classes in Linux administration somewhere but I seem to learn better
with the hands-on experimenting. Plus there is the  pride of mastering a
skill (mostly) through my own efforts. That's what moved me towards
working with PCs as more than an application user and thence to Linux. I
can't stand  the idea that someone out there can do something so easily
that I can't get the hang of. So much so that I keep banging away until
I can develop an equivalent proficiency. 

Thanks again

i haven't followed this entire thread, but i have to say that dd is only a 
useful backup strategy if you will use exactly the same hard disk to 
restore onto.  using one of a different size or geometry can lead to 
trouble if the new disk partition isn't sized correctly.  it has to be the 
same number of sectors or larger, and if larger it won't use the extra 
space without resizing the filesystem which is another scary operation.

have you looked at dump/restore?  they produce output that can be stored 
on disk or tape.  you can also do interactive restores from their images 
(a mini shell like environment where you can cd and ls and choose files).

those dump images aren't something that you can just restore and reboot 
from.  you need to boot into some minimal system (live/rescue cd) and then 
repartition/reformat/restore.

if you want a bootable bare metal restore, there are some tools out there 
that can create bootable cd/dvd disks, but i have never used them.

I wasn't aware of dump/restore. I need to research that option. It seems
like it is Red Hat utility not easily available for Intrepid. An Ubuntu
GUI application called 'sbackup' is recommended instead. I need to
research sbackup and see if it can sidestep the UUID mismatch that
plagued my tar / backups. 

I wonder if putting the /boot directory on its own partition might help.
I could dd that one tiny partition to avoid the UUID mismatch. The  /
and /home partitions could be backed up any old way. Is there any
minimum size limit for a Linux or Intrepid partition?       

As for the dd requirement of an exactly partition match, until I gain
proficiency in Linux I will only experiment on one machine. Unlike
WindowsXP, Intrepid Linux seems exceeding stable if  I don't screw with
it. So I can use it on other machines that don't see drastic changes.
However I must screw with Linux to learn how it works and how to fix
what I (or eventually others) may break. So one desktop machine is
dedicated to nothing but learning about Linux and I probably won't need
to change the disks as they are new.  

Stability is one reason I migrated to Linux. I can live with having to
fix problems I create in Linux in the learning process. I dislike
Windows problems like registry artifacts that hang around and grow from
old removed applications and other reasons. Backing up a Windows install
usually requires an extra piece of software like Ghost. I'd rather have
an OS that provides all the tools I need. Plus I detest Microsoft's
heavy handed and intrusive software validation process. Windows 2k was
very stable and didn't have the validation regime. I was happy with Win
2k but every release since has gotten less reliable more expensive and
more intrusive and chased me to Linux.

Thanks,

Where dawn of time is V6 (research) Unix.
http://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/DumpHistory

and V6 Unix was the first version available outside of Bell Labs
http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/faq/part6/section-2.html

Or about 1975.

Which really is the dawn of time (epoch being o' dark thirty, pre-dawn) in this context.

"UUID" here doesn't mean anything to GRUB. GRUB's "kernel" command
treats everything after the first argument (the path to the kernel
image itself) as kernel boot parameters, and passes them directly to
the kernel. The "root" argument tells the kernel which file system to
mount as the root file system.  You can use device nodes, labels, or
UUIDs for that purpose.

If you're reasonably confident that your disks won't get moved around
(e.g., your boot partitiong is on a PATA drive, which will always be
the master drive on the first IDE bus), then you can specify the
appropriate device node instead of UUID. For instance,
"root=/dev/hda1". This is not a good bet for disks attached to some
busses, like USB. If it's just the human-unreadability of UUIDs that
you dislike, you might prefer to use file system labels.

Huh, I didn't have to use user agent switcher previous years though I 
did have to this year. I actually would have accepted a disclaimer 
warning me my system won't work and a 'I'll take my chances anyways' 
type link. I understand that companies can't test for every possible 
configuration and as a linux user I'm used to occasionally (often) using 
untested software but getting a message that it won't work (rather then 
just being untested/unsupported) especially when it did work without 
problems just plain bugs me. Maybe it's my system since no one else had 
issues but I was running firefox on ubuntu 8.10 which is about as 
average as things get for linux.

to click past a "yes, continue despite HORRIBLE TRAGIC POSSIBLE

on the 15th (yeah, procrastination...) without complication, and
certainly without fiddling with user agent settings.

I have to second Mark here.  NoMachine has released source as FreeNX, which
is amazing!  Very fast, and not very complicated to set up (at least on my
distro). YMMV.  It's definitely worth a look, and I prefer it highly over
VNC.

On April 15 (between 11:30 AM PDT and 8:45 PM PDT) my Firefox install on
Ubuntu 8.10 worked fine with just a click on the continue button after it
warned me about supported OS/Browser combinations.

DISCLAIMER:  Actual tax prep time was three hours.  Extended tax prep time
involved running extra scenarios and reviewing with my wife.

Message-ID: <49E8A2B9.2050409@opusnet.com>

I am using Ubuntu Intrepid. I am a user and not a coder.
I also live out in slow-speed, ex-urban Oregon.

Lately this past week I have been notified of several large patches; 
17MB, 10MB and today 4MB. I don't like stopping my other downloads every 
other day.

Generally I don't like patches because they feel to me like 'the 
engineers turned in their homework late - after we had already shipped

Guy,

While your frustrations are understandable, prompt patching of problems as
they are found is a foundation of what makes linux great.  We don't have a
"patch Tuesday" (Microsoft releases patches on a schedule), linux has a
"patch as we find problems" mindset.

Securing a system and fixing bugs is a reality of using any operating
system.  Linux just has a history of doing it frequently, as opposed to on a
regular schedule or compiling a "Service Pack".

Ubuntu is still one of your best bets for modern functionality, as it has a
massive following and is relatively easy for end users to operate.

Guy,

   What I can tell you from my 5.5 years experience with Slackware is that
other than issues many of us faced after upgrading to -12.2 (a _very_
unusual situation), it takes minimal effort to maintain.

   Distribution upgrades come out perhaps twice a year, and a subscription
means you get the set of disks in the mail. Worth while, in my opinion.

   Otherwise, individual packages (applications) are patched and upgraded
only when an identified vulnerability has been addressed. This is infrequent
but the individual packages vary greatly in size (Mozilla apps are among the
largest). Many folks don't upgrade distributions for a long time if they
don't need anything other than security updages.

   You can select your GUI from Xfce, KDE, window maker, fluxbox, and several
others. I don't do drag-and-drop so I cannot comment on it. USB works well
with the new HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer).

   I'm certain other distributions have equivalent ease of use but those who
use 'em will have to comment on them.

   Just a thought: have a friend or colleague with a high-speed connection
get the patches and burn them on a cdrom. He can mail you the disk and the
materials and postage will cost you less than the frustration of watching
the bits crawl along the line.

Just thought of one more thing....

I'm not sure if Ubuntu is different, but I use Linux Mint, and it doesn't
make you download anything.  It will alert you when patches and security
fixes are available, but it won't download them until you tell it to.  You
could just ignore it until you have the time to update?

I think we all feel your discomfort, but "release early, release 
often" is so ingrained in development cycles these days that any 
campaign against it has a strong likelihood of appearing quixotic. I'm 
just the messenger here....

Most -- not all, but most -- updates fix bugs and vulnerabilites that 
are not remotely exploitable. That is, if you trust yourself (and 
anyone else who uses your system) to be prudent, you can safely 
forestall installing them.

The more defensive layers between your machine and the Internet -- a 
firewall, packet filtering, disabling services you don't need -- the 
better.

On the other hand, the more functionality you expect of your system, 
the more software that's potentially vulnerable.

The thing is, there's no solid rule here. Some vulnerabilities are 
exploitable under fairly limited conditions -- but you're the only one 
who's able to assess whether your system is at risk.

If it is only the time the large patches take to download with your 
present connection, you could make use of the clinic's broadband 
connection at Freegeek.

I think most of the distros have a stable version with very few patches.

That "is* one annoyance, the red 'zomG if you don't download your system 
will be COMPROMISED' arrow does NOT let you ignore upgrades to software 
you don't even use. I use Thunderbird but if I uncheck all the EUDORA 
stuff the arrow stays on - I have to download megs and megs of stuff 
just to make it GO AWAY.

Thanks for all the comments and information, everyone...

if there are packages you don't use, uninstall them.  that will eliminate 
the update notices and make your hard disk lighter :-).

Guy,

My hunch is that you'll have fewer non-security package updates
running something with a longer release cycle, such as Debian stable,
CentOS/RHEL, or even Ubuntu LTS. These all have much longer release
cycles than vanilla Ubuntu.

Excellent advice, but not as simple as it sounds. E.g., I don't use
Evolution for mail, but I think that other applications use parts of it.
Personally, I just make sure I have a big enough hard disk and leave
alone the stuff that ain't broke.

Denis,

I've had them only since August of last year, but so far they have
been good. Initial installation in an old condo was trouble for them,
due to some signal issues with the existing cable, but they got it
sorted after a week or so by replacing the line.

Kubuntu puts a discrete, green icon on the task bar for you to click or ignore
as needed.

You could also set up a cron job to auto install security updates at times
when you won't be using the system.  For me that's while I'm at work.

Denis,

I think I instigated the last discussion. I'm still using Comcast due to
inertia. The problem I was initially complaining about (bad voip service
using Vonage), seemed to have cleared somewhat. 90% of the time, I really
have nothing to complain about. I'm also not a "heavy" user of bittorrent
and doubt I come close to my download limits.

so, the simple workaround to the excessive presence of the angry red
arrow, if you are really sure you don't want non-security updates, is
to take the non-security repositories out of your
/etc/apt/sources.list file.  this may or may not work for long--some
of those updates may depend on other non-security updates which the
system can't find.  of course, many security issues are with the
kernel, or the browser, which are the huge downloads that clog your
pipe.  i'd keep the non-security ones in there but commented out in
case you need them again.

i run ubuntu but i disabled the entire desktop (i boot to runlevel 2
and startx manually into the most minimal of window managers,
ratpoison), so i never see an arrow.  there is probably an "update
manager" process or widget in the toolbar you could also disable.
this fix, however, is the equivalent of putting electrical tape over
the "oil pressure warning" light in your car.

It's tricky to talk about.  Comcast and Qwest are both big enough to
have many satisfied and dissatisfied customers.

Comcast appears to have a history of filtering bittorrent packets and
then lying about it (google it if you want more info).  On the other
hand, the fix is simple, use a sufficiently powerful BT client that
you can enable packet header encryption.  I found that Vuze has this
ability.  But, it makes you wonder what else Comcast is dishonest
about.  Also, I thought I was having issues with my Comcast service
but eventually I learned that my wireless router was competing with my
neighbors and after I changed the channel on my router my service has
been very solid for 3 months.  The biggest disruptions I've had with
Comcast in the last year were all scheduled maintenance that happened
in the middle of the night.  I only noticed because some of those
nights I was being an insomniac.  When you call Comcast, you can also
haggle with them if you're seriously upset about the price of a
service.  Just be prepared to really cancel your service and not just
make idle threats about doing it.

I used Qwest with a local ISP for a couple years when I lived in
Corvallis.  I found that the service was rock solid, but the data
rates were lower than the Comcast I have now.  I also paid more at the
time.

Which will I use in the future?  I'm not sure.  I don't have a big
complaint with Comcast and it's faster than Qwest was last time I used
it.  On the other hand, I don't trust Comcast to do the right moral
thing where net neutrality is concerned.

i've used comcast as an individual customer for about 4 months, and
with my roommate as primary customer (she's cuter and the tech gives
her free stuff, like a new modem and free cable channels) for about 15
months, and i've never had any gripes with the service.  i do
occasionally bittorrent (and i suspect my girlfriend does it more than
occasionally--she says my internet works better than hers and she
watches a lot of older tv online), and haven't had any trouble with
bandwidth, service outage, service installation, or difficulty with
phone sales people (note:  i only ever had to call them to
order/cancel service--so no tech support opinion can be offered by
me).

Amen to that.  My only complaint with Comcast (aside from the aforementioned Net Neutrality concerns) is the fact that their technical help is fairly useless and they, for the most part, aren't familiar at all with linux-based operating systems.

Is any big name service any better in regards to linux?  I've had more
than my share of broadband providers in my many years, and none of
them were linux-savvy at the consumer level (time warner, at&t,
grandecom, comcast, charter).  not that i didn't tell all of them that
i was using linux, and have them be accepting ("no, your tech cannot
install any software on my computer").  but they were definitely then
of the opinion that "you're on your own".  charter & time warner were
at least tolerant of it at the business account level.

It sounds like you're using default update settings.  By default, it 
checks once a day for updates and alerts the user if any are available, 
but waits for the user to take action, including to download the 
updates.  You can change this behavior by going to Software Sources (in 
your System Administration menu), choosing the Updates tab and selecting 
your options.  You can change the check frequency, allow it to download 
and install, download only, or do nothing.

I wouldn't recommend doing nothing, however.  Mine is set to check daily 
and to download only.  I control when they're installed and don't have 
to stop what I'm doing to download them.

Regardless of which distro you select, there will be advantages and 
disadvantages.  Ubuntu installs just about everything you might want, 
and a lot you might not, which makes installations a snap but is a 
burden to update.  Slackware can be set to prompt you about each and 
every potential package, which makes installations tedious, but your 
system will be much cleaner.  Of course, you may also need to manually 
check for bug fixes and procrastination can lead to unprotected 
vulnerabilities.

No distro is up to date except perhaps on release day and when the 
distro itself is updated to include bug fixes.  Either way, downloading 
and installing updates may be a fact of life for all distros.  It's a 
matter of how much life you give to it.

   I've had DSL service from Aracnet/SpiritOne for almost 10 years now.
They're great! Their SysAdmin is outstanding and the tech support guys know
linux from all sides because that's what they're running there (at least on
their servers). Very highly recommended with no reservations.

   Nah. Each time a patch is released an e-mail message is sent to everyone
subscribed to the announce mail list.

Thanks for the update (no pun intended).  Still this points to the 
less-automatic "disadvantage" because one has to sign up to the list.  
Is it pointed out to the user during installation?  I admit I haven't 
used Slackware since about v8, and I don't recall being told of such a 
list.  If memory serves Ubuntu Breezy (also 2005) had automatic update 
notification by default.

Oops, sorry.  Slackware 8 is much older than 2005.

Help.

Sound out has quit on one channel only.  That is, system sound test, audacity, 
amarok, and on-line videos all lack output on one channel. The microphone 
plugged into the sound card, however, generates output on both channels (as seen 
by ecasignalview). I unplugged the cable to the amp at the sound card and tested 
to ensure that both channels respond, so the problem is not in the hardware 
external to the computer.

ecasignalview shows signal on only one channel (from software sources).

Kmix has a right/left balance slider.  It is set in the middle, but if I move it 
much at all the master volume drops to near zero. Raising the master control 
back up restores the working channel output, but the dead channel remains dead.

Ideas?

-Denis

Right, that's why I said "big name".  i have no doubt there are a ton
of small/regional shops that actually care about their entire

   I've no idea. When I switched from Red Hat I subscribed to receive a set
of disks each time an upgrade was released. I don't recall explicitly
subscribing to an announce list, and I don't remember the headers on the
patch notification messages. What I like is that patches are few and
infrequent and very easy to apply on my schedule.

   Of course, I'm a CLI guy so I much prefer having control over what's
installed and upgraded.

There is a security mailing list that is low volume. I believe there
have been maybe 6 updates since the release of 12.2. Slackware doesn't
generally do kernel upgrades after the release which keeps downloads
low.

> I would love to hear of your good/bad experiences.

I signed up for Comcast just over a year ago when I was in Beaverton.
I run my own mail server and web server from home, and while I didn't
get a static IP from them, I had planned on using dynamic DNS and some
other tricks to serve a fair amount of content even if my IP happened
to change a lot.

After 2 weeks of running my mail server on their line, they blocked
port 25.  I called and asked them to unblock, explaining that I merely
run my own mail server and much of the traffic is incoming spam, not
outgoing (since I don't spam).  They refused under *any condition* to
open up port 25 again.  

I immediately canceled my service and got my money back, since it was
within the 30 day grace period.  I *had* asked their sales people
about blocking any ports or doing other lame filtering several times,
and they universally said they didn't do this.

In the end, I always have trouble with large ISPs.  Unfortunately, in
that Beaverton area, DSL was no longer available at all, and my only
two choices were Comcast and Verizon, both of which are terrible at
providing anything other than fat pipes for downloading pr0n and
pirated content.

I'm now in a Qwest area and much happier that I can sign up with a
third party ISP.  I really hope this model never dies because at least
I get the *option* of using competent non-evil ISPs, even if I have to
pay a bit more.

good luck,
tim

unfortunately it is dieing.  qwest's new fiber to the node (fttn) product 
doesn't allow 3rd party isps to provide service.  and as they roll this 
out, they stop allowing new customers to get the older style dsl.  as one 
of those 3rd party isps, i'm not happy.

Interesting.  That wold certainly alleviate any bandwidth restrictions.

I hear you.  I'm comfortable in CLI, I still install and heavily use 
mc.  But I'm also a bit lazy and like things done for me.  To each his 
own, I suppose.  That's the idea, anyway.

every distribution that i know of lets you do that.  i don't use
ubuntu's gui, so i am manually checking for and installing updates
using the command line apt-get/aptitude/dpkg rather than using the
sparkly notifier and the guiified synaptic.  if you choose to use the
desktop, you can still go my way, you just have to customize your
panels or ignore 'em.  go team TMTOWTDI!

Their contract, even B2B, prohibits customer-end servers of any kind.  I 
suppose blocking the port is akin to measures "up to termination."

For my own experience, my only dislike is the cost.  I don't measure 
value in bandwidth because I rarely use what I'm given.  I get around 
10mb average DL, upwards of 1mb upload, but would be just as happy with 
a T1-speed DSL.  But I'm too far from a CO (and don't have a hard line 
to the house anyway) to get DSL and FIOS isn't out my way just yet 
(southern Cornelius).  I've never called their tech support.  But I've 
emailed them and got decent responses.  Recently, though, their new mail 
center removed the ability to check multiple mailboxes (you can have up 
to seven per account).  Since I use that sometimes when I'm away from 
home I found that to be an inconvenience.  Their solution is to use POP, 
which seems like a step backwards.  But there you go.

I had them for 4 plus years and only experienced one service
interruption which was due to an upstream routing issue with level 3
that took the entire weekend to fix but tech support was upfront and
cordial about it.

Message-ID: <5f6af5080904171527o790868f3g731b0d85d5ef7229@mail.gmail.com>

All C++ gurus,

I'm a C++ newbie, so be gentle ;)

I'm trying to compile a vendor provided c++ file on RHEL 4, test_api .cpp,
and on compile it dumps with an error:

undefined reference to 'get_auto_event(event_ap*, int)'

The file I'm compiling calls get_auto_event. This function is referenced in
a header file autosys_api_auto.h that has this line:

extern int get_auto_event(EVENT_API *eapi, int polling);

Now in the same directory there is a get_auto_event.cpp file that has the
fully defined function:

int get_auto_event(EVENT_API *eapi, int polling);
...

My question is, how does the compiler know about that get_auto_event.cpp
defines get_auto_event from just the extern keyword in autosys_api_auto.h?
Does it just match by the name? Do I have to compile get_auto_event.cpp
before I can compile test_api.cpp, or will the compiler handle that
automagically? (The fact that get_auto_event.cpp doesn't compile is another
issue. That is trying to include a missing header file).

thanks,

   I tried C++ and decided to stick with C; I now use Python when I want an
OO approach.

   I always wrote my Makefiles so that all the subordinate files (e.g., those
included but declared 'extern') were compiled first. The main file was
always the last to be compiled. In other words, struture the build from the
bottom up. Should work the same way with C++.

not truly a c++ issue, but a linker issue.  to make your program work you 
need to compile both files into object files and then link them together. 
the simpleminded way is something like:

g++ test_api.cpp get_auto_event.cpp -o test_api

that will recompile both files every time.  more complex is to compile to 
.o files and then link them together.  as richard indicated, usually that 
would be done with a makefile and the make program so you don't have to 
keep track of what files need to be rebuilt.  i would guess that your 
sample code might have included a makefile, and if so, just type make and 
see if that gets you what you want.

   Hey! It worked once again. As soon as I posted this I found the answer on

I saw a talk at Freedom To Connect in Washington last month by a Chris
Savage (attorney, Davis Wright Tremaine) called "Intelligent
Regulation and the Death of the Chicago School":

  http://www.slideshare.net/f2c/chris-savage-1246598

which is somewhat relevant.  I happen to think that the public (the
users of the network) needs to seize control of the last mile
infrastructure (either by purchase or by building its own).  The
current ownership/regulation model is broken.

I concur.  How might it be accomplished?  And once it is accomplished, how do we

Found this:

"I have a 1525n with Kubuntu Hardy (8.04) and to get full
volume I have to slide the PCM and/or
Front volume sliders from 100% to 0% and back to 100% to get volume on
both channels (with the
sound only coming out of one channel it is obviously lower in volume).
I don't know why this happens and I haven't bothered to find out why..."

Works for me too. Do this after every boot??

One way is the same way other public infrastructure (like streets,
water, sewer) was accomplished.  You decide to build it, sell revenue
bonds (borrowing), build it, and charge fees to pay the bonds back.
We bonds are retired, fees can drop to maintenance levels.

To the degree necessary, you might end up continuing to build
infrastructure further and further.  But if you get somewhere that you
are getting good service and neutral carriage, you can stop.  Right
now in Portland, that basically equals the Pittock Building downtown.

Nope.  Fix remains after reboot.  Now what do you suppose happened, how did this 
movement of one slider down and up fix it, and where is the data stored which 
permanently changed when moving the Front slider?

I think you guys are missing the whole point of the challenge.  The
challenge is to replace TurboTax with a Linux based tax preparation
program.  Talking about whether or not TurboTax online works and
how to do your taxes with a stone chisel or chickens misses the
point.  I would like to see some discussion on how to get a project
going to write a tax preparation program for Linux.  Yeah there should
be a Windows version too, so maybe Java and/or LISP should be used.
I'm curious why people talk about whether or not TurboTax online works
and not about what it would take to replace it with a Linux compatible
program?

How do you get a project started on sourceforge?

Who wants to join me?

What will a sourceforge project cost?

I don't know about anyone else on here, but I don't want to be forced
to run Vista or Windows 7 to do my taxes.  First off, I don't have
anything better than a P4 with 512 megs of ram.  Second off, I'd 
rather not do my taxes by hand as e-filing is much nicer.

Every few years someone tries to start up an open-source tax
preparation project.  It may sputter along for a month or two, but in
the end it always dies.

There are a number of reasons for this.

One possibility is that tax software just isn't sexy enough.  There
are many other projects that are much more fun to work on.

Or the challenge of maintenance is just too high.  Not only do the
programmers have to understand the entirety of the tax statutes to
write the initial package, but they have to update it, every single
year, or it quickly becomes useless.  And to be a complete and useful
package, it would also have to be able to handle the state taxes too,
for every state that has an income tax.  And, yes, those packages
would have to be updated yearly as well.

But I think the main reason that the idea never flies is that the open
source community is so global.  A typical open-source project has
members working on 2 or 3 continents.  And income tax is by its very
nature very localized.  And quite frankly, the vast majority of the
open-source community doesn't give a hoot about US income tax.

As much as I dislike many of Comcast's policies, they were the
ones that built their network, decades of hard work while we were
indifferent and uninvolved in the effort.  Now that they've finished
the heavy lifting, what right do we have to take it away from them?  

If you want their Portland network, you can offer them enough money
that they will gladly sell it to you.  If you want a fiber network
instead, that costs about $1000 per home initial investment, plus
ongoing operations and maintenance.  Start writing checks.  Don't
take the money from schools and roads and community protection.

If you want the community to own the next network, "how that might
be accomplished" is by putting effort into building it, and
convincing others to do likewise. 

Right now, I am putting in 80+ hours a week on the assumption that
Server Sky will be that next network, in 5 or 10 years.  I'm hoping
it will be an open network, and I'm attempting to engage the local
open source community to help.  Some are.  More will.  But whether
a large share of the community gets involved is not my decision. 
As a member of the community, it is your own personal decision. 

And what will that be?

Hi,

I installed debian on my laptop.

I am using epiphany and iceweasel.
I followed the instruction from adobe's website to install flash:


Installation instructions for tar.gz

       1. Click the download link to begin installation. A dialog box
will appear asking you where to save the file.
       2. Save the .tar.gz file to your desktop and wait for the file
to download completely.
       3. Unpackage the file. A directory called
install_flash_player_10_linux will be created.
       4. In terminal, navigate to this directory and type
./flashplayer-installer to run the installer. Click Enter. The
installer will instruct you to shut down your browser(s).
       5. Once the installation is complete, the plug-in will be
installed in your Mozilla browser. To verify, launch Mozilla and
choose Help > About Plug-ins from the browser menu.


As root in the following directory......


/home/victor/Desktop/install_flash_player_10_linux# ls -la

I run the command....

./flashplayer-installer

The installation program runs and eventuall says...

Please enter the installation path of the Mozilla, Netscape,
or Opera browser (i.e., /usr/lib/mozilla):


at which point I type.....

/usr/lib/mozilla

because that path does exist on my system
but I keep getting......


WARNING: Please enter a valid installation path.

Please enter the installation path of the Mozilla, Netscape,
or Opera browser (i.e., /usr/lib/mozilla):


I also get the WARNING:  above when I type in

/usr/lib/iceweasel
/usr/lib/epiphany


How do I get flash to work with epiphany and iceweasel?

Sincerely,
Victor Soich

 Please enter the installation path of the Mozilla, Netscape,
or Opera browser (i.e., /usr/lib/mozilla):

at which point I type.....

/usr/lib/mozilla

- You want to specify "/usr/lib/iceweasel" or alternatively you can just
copy the libflashplayer.so file to /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins

It's easy.  You just sign up at the sf.net website.

> Who wants to join me?

People who think you have a good start on it and also believe you're
serious about getting results.  If you want to find others to help
you, you'll have to take the initiative to get it rolling.  Perhaps
you should read "Producing Open Source Software" by Karl Fogel:
http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596007591/

> What will a sourceforge project cost?

Open source is at least as expensive as non-Open source software.
Costwise you just have the advantage that people donate their time and
some companies donate more than just time.  Hosting at sf.net is
"free" in the sense that they don't put any charges on your credit
card.  Github is also quite popular these days.

I think if you read the whole thread you would recognize that you are

 Greetings,

I've been lurking for several months now. Used to live Portland and
attended a few clinics in sw, can't remember the name of the school.

Gt married and moved, now living in Hartford Ct. Not much going on
community wise in open source in this specific area. Glad to know that
things are flourishing there.

Just installed Ubuntu v8.10 to a new to me laptop. Dell Lattitude D800.
Installation went perfectly. Now, the screen freezes, sometimes while
using oo, other times while in a terminal and sometimes while online.
The only way out is to restart the system. Reminds of the other one.

Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance,

Malaika Sharp

Can you try ctrl alt backspace to see if it is just X freezing or the
actual system? Check logs in /var/log and see if anything interesting
shows up.

The biggest issues I have ever experienced when dealing with Comcast is 
their unwillingness to provide you support when you inform them that 
your system is NOT directly connected to their cable modem (shame on 
anyone that does that).  For example if you tell them that you have a 
hardware based firewall and a wireless router downstream on their 
connection, they will refuse to provide you any support and you are left 
in the cold.

Getting flash to work iceweasel is very easy, get the source code for 
flash like you did, untarball it and then do this.  cd to ~/.mozilla - 
mkdir plugins - and then copy file "libflashplayer.so" to 
~/.mozilla/plugins/.

Have not mucked with Epiphany much as I dumped it because of its 
requirement to have gnome-network-manager to configure it for using a 
proxy when I use fluxbox.

Comcast must have improved their communication of this point.  When I
thought something was wrong with my cable connection they made me
bypass the hardware router I have but they did still support me.  And
to be fair to them, why should they help you trouble shoot arbitrary
3rd party (to them) hardware?  Yes a local ISP is very likely to help
you with that, but not because they are under obligation to do so.
Additionally, in my case, the router was at fault because it was set
to a fixed channel that conflicted with my neighbor's router.

Message-ID: <20090418172026.GA23750@jamhome.us>

I was viewing the source to a web page I retrieved and saw
<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" media="all" href="/sites/default/files/css/04b371acb6269192bb0f071989867540.css"
/>

Hmmmh?   That's a strange name for a css file.   When I open another browser I see:
<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" media="all" href="/sites/default/files/css/04b371acb6269192bb0f071989867540.css"
/>

Same thing, BTW the browsers were Konqueror and Firefox.  My cookies from the site don't contain that string.  The
Firefox cookies do include a session ID.  

I'm thinking the 04b371acb6269192bb0f071989867540.css is a link to some regular file name like non-ie-browsers.css or
perhaps it's an auto-generated css based on a mix of parameters.  But why, as in what's the point?

Ideas?

The site is http://www.mercycorps.org/ and I suspect it is Drupal driven.

I have used similar tactics in the past adding a random date-time string to 
a dynamic css file name
to prevent browser caching.

As both browsers give you the same file name, that may not be what is going 
on here, but perhaps
this site runs on some platform hosting many other similar sites and that is 
this sites ID number?

Most likely a template driven site as you mentioned Drupal. Maybe it's
a dynamic string from a database of templates perhaps?

Moneydance is a great program (I use it), but it is personal finance
software, not tax software.  You can use the categories to keep track
of tax-related spending and withholdings, but it does not inherently
provide any tax features.  There is a free trial version.  Note it is
Java under the hood, which is why it is cross-platform.  The
Windows/OSX/Linux versions just have convenient launchers included.
There is a python interface and API to allow extensions, though I
haven't played with it much.

It is not free, but so far they have allowed free upgrades to newer
versions ever since I bought it.

Cheers,
Jason

Subject: [PLUG] Trimming PostScript Bounding Box
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0904181313490.3462@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I have a graphic as a PostScript file that displays about the middle of a
page. I would like to trim away the white space above and below the text.
The .ps file defines the bounding box as the whole page:

%%BoundingBox: 0 0 612 792

   Since I'm not fluent in PS, is there a way to determine where within that
box the text I want is actually located so I can change the bounding box to
be tighter?

I seem to remember that gv (ghostview) shows you the x,y coordinates
of the mouse pointer.  We used that feature as a cheap-ass digitizing
mechanism to capture geometry from old tranmission tower drawings a
while ago.

But, really, the traditional trial and error method would converge on
an acceptable solution in a few minutes (or perhaps even demonstrate
that it won't work), probably less time than it takes to type out your
question.

   Thanks, Russell. I'll check that out. Of course, I still need to figure
out how to modify the file itself.

It's just a text file. Edit it in a text editor.  Postscript is programming
language for describing pages the ps file is the source.

Bill,

   Yes, I know that. It's finding the x,y positions on the page where the
text in which I'm interested begins and ends.

   Actually, I wimped out and changed the page size of the letterhead that I
created in OO.o's Writer so the 'page' was just outside the text. When I
re-exported that as a pdf file it was much smaller and worked like a charm
in my LaTeX document.

Thanks,

Rich

Say you have a single, diagonal, line as the graphic, that starts at one
corner and runs to the opposite corner. If you crop to the exact start and
end points, you'll have cropped the document's raw information down to the
proper minimum co-ordinates... *but* if that line had a 30 pt stroke applied
to it, the line corners (as it's now more of a rectangle) would "render"
outside of the now-cropped areas. So, rendering has to take place before
cropping, or the cropped data has to be rendered on an a larger area than
the minimum co-ordinates found in the data?

I see the exact same name when I look at the source, so at least you can be
sure it's not some tracking thing following your IP address or something
else the least bit sinister.

But as far as why... sorry, that's beyond me.

Not with standard Drupal, or any plugins I'm familiar with. 

FWIW - I'm a Mercy Corps contributor and the reason I was looking at the source to begin with was an email from them saying "Mercycorps.org is all new!  ... Cleaner, brighter design  ...  Open-source platform leverages latest technology at minimal cost" and I wondered which open-source platform they are using.

That's a Drupal website's theme CSS cache that it builds from the CSS
inheritance hierarchy.  It contains all the CSS code that's in effect.

If you install the Firebug add-on in Firefox you can inspect all page
elements to see CSS directives.  You would not want to try to read the
file because it's just an extremely dense dump of all of the CSS code.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0904190823400.19504@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   As an interim fix for the broken ctrl key on the Toshiba Tecra I want to
create .Xmodmap that swaps the function to the CapsLock key, and puts that
function on the permanently depressed Ctrl key. After all, who uses CapsLock
anyway?

   My Slackware boxes have .Xmodmap defined to do this so I have the content
of the file. On these hosts it is called within ~/.xinitrc, but the Xubuntu
box appears not to have that file (yet both run Xfce; go figure.)

   Since the Toshiba boots into runlevel 5 with no login required, where
should I place a call to .Xmodmap so the key functions are swapped each time
the system is booted?

Does Xubuntu have /etc/rc.d/rc.local?  That is meant for such trivial
local startup tasks. I use that to link various Xsession error files
to /dev/null at every reboot, for example.

   Stockholm isn't Portland. :-)

I would say that it would be difficult to know how much those apples cost.
It is also "free" for me use the highways between here and Newport, but does
that mean they don't cost me anything? Somehow they used over $1e8 of
someone's money just  on new bridges in that stretch of road.

Message-ID: <20090419205600.53c77535.johnxj@comcast.net>

On Ubuntu, does anyone know a command to launch Network Manager?

According to Synaptic the package that is installed is
"network-manager," but that gives a "not found" error message at the
command line.

I have lost the GUI launcher, but I can't recreate it until I can
figure out what the app is called.

This is not the first time I have tried to figure out how to launch an
app from the command line. Maybe there is a command I can use to find
the launch term for all installed packages? Or hopefully can be used
with grep or something in order to get just the one I want?

dpkg -L network-manager
will tell you which files the package installed
That's a capital L.

Not *too* difficult though.  Similar networks here in the US (which
pay for themselves), while maybe not quite $11/month yet, are pretty
damned reasonable for what you get.  

Utilities are usually completely self-financing, capital and operating
costs being paid by user fees.  It cost a lot of money to build our
water supply system here in Portland too, much more than a fiber
build, but it didn't get paid for with taxes.

Folks need to be a little bit more aspirational here.  We don't have
to wallow in over-priced mediocrity.

I think you're looking for network-admin, part of the 
gnome-network-admin package.  Assuming you mean the GUIfied Network 
Manager application normally found in the System ->Administration menu, 
that is.

I believe I successfully untarred the libflashplayer.so file.  I

successfully as far as I can tell.  See below.  When I go to a flash

Thanks. 

Unfortunately, it lists about 50 files. :(

Scanning the list I saw "/etc/init.d/NetworkManager" which looked
promising. But that got me:

jjj at Devil7:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/NetworkManager
[sudo] password for jjj: 
Usage: /etc/init.d/NetworkManager {start|stop|restart|force-reload}

I think I need to find out what launches the GUI.

It used to be that the GUI launcher was in System > Administration >
Network. My "Network" launch item is missing. If someone who has
"Network" listed there can open the menu editor and right click on the
item, it will say what the command to launch it is.

Sorry I haven't been following this whole thread.  Has the CPU
architecture already been discussed?  Are you trying to use a 32 bit
flash player in a 64 bit browser?  Flash is now available in a 64 bit
build.

Until someone can answer that question directly, what happens when you
finish the above thought.
sudo /etc/init.d/NetworkManager restart
?

jjj at Devil7:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/NetworkManager restart
[sudo] password for jjj: 
 * Stopping
NetworkManager...
[ OK ] 
 * Starting NetworkManager...   

And that is all that happens. No GUI.

The reason I need the GUI is to be able to find wireless networks when
I am away from home, select one, and connect to it. It is far faster to
do so from the GUI (assuming I can get it to work) than from the
command line. Furthermore, I am soon going to upgrade to Jaunty, and in
Jaunty the GUI works much better. I know that from trying the live CD
of the release candidate. But at the moment I am not sure that the GUI
package is even installed.

Ok, so network-manager is working ok, you just don't have GUI access to it.
Perhaps one of these package will do?

network-manager-gnome - network management framework (GNOME frontend)
network-manager-kde - KDE systray applet for controlling NetworkManager

or the Ubuntu variant of that.

That was it!

I tried gnome-network-admin and got the "not installed" error message.
Looking in Synaptic revealed that it was not installed. I installed it
and now the launch icon is in System - Administration - Network, where
it belongs.

Now that I can launch it, y'all please cross your fingers that it will
work better after I upgrade to Jaunty in a few days.

Thanks for the pointer.

Perhaps you should look at the numbers for a comparable non-capital
city such as Upsalla, or further out in the countryside, where the
living arrangments approximate our own.  My fourth cousin Dan L?vstr?m
lives in Gimo, ?sterby Kommun, about 50km east of Upsalla.  His
(very high) tax Kr?ner go to fund that municipal fiber network in
Stockholm, which is a VERY dense city, everybody lives in 5 story
apartment buildings.  In Gimo, which is about the size and density
of Forest Grove, dialup costs about twice what broadband costs here. 
Dan can't afford it (because of those high taxes he pays), so he uses
the internet connection at work, even though he has a PC at home.

That's not to say that he resents it.  The Swedes invest a lot in
Stockholm, and hope their children can get jobs there.  They have
a king, and still dote on their imperial capital, and gladly make
sacrifices so Stockholm can be a national showpiece.  Besides, Dan
is more interested in soccer on the TV, and if investments are to
be made, he might prefer more power to the TV transmitters in 
Upsalla so his TV picture was less snowy.  

If you really want cheap municipal broadband, the Swedes will let
Americans like you live in Stockholm.  Well, they will if your
business creates jobs and you are willing to pay their taxes. 
It is actually a pretty nice place, if you don't mind eating your
apples (when they are briefly in season) in a small flat up four
flights of stairs.  

Broadband penetration is always much better in densely packed urban
areas than areas with two story detached homes with big lawns and 
wide roads.  If the bureaucrats allocating the taxes live there,
they end up with the best stuff.  There is also good and inexpensive
(privately owned) broadband in Tokyo.  Which is stacked three times
as high as Stockholm.  If we all moved to high rises, with one fiber
to the whole building and cat5 inside to distribute it, we would
have cheap broadband, too.

To expand:

The "extern" keyword in C++ (and C, for that matter), tells the compiler 
"I'm defining this entity for you.  It's out there somewhere, and I'm 
going to take care of getting it to you later, but for now this is what 
you need to use it".  Think of it as a data sheet for the thing.  I use 
the word "entity" because you can use "extern" to define a function as 
done here, or to define some global variable that you wisely and 
sparingly want to make available (or foolishly and profligately want to 
make available).

So when you compile test_api.cpp, the compiler puts in the code to 
get_auto_event, and it puts an entry into the .o file that tells the 
linker "Yo!  I need this function!".  Then when things get to the link 
step and nothing has the definition of get_auto_event (because you 
didn't compile to a get_auto_event.o file, and didn't submit it to the 
linker), the linker sees that it needs something it doesn't have and it 
bombs.

So you need to get your get_auto_event.cpp file to compile, then you'll 
have the function you need for the link pass (or you'll have other 
things missing -- not that such things _ever_ happen when you're 
wrapping your arms around adopted code).

Thanks.

I've opened an issue with vendor and am banging on them to get me the
misisng header file so get_auto_event.cpp will (presumably) compile.

How dense is Lafayette LA?  Or the network in Burlington VT?  The dude
from Burlington, Tim Nulty, says building fiber is cheaper than
wireless (assuming you actually provide decent service).  See this:

strangely, my (xubuntu 8.10) netbook won't even let me configure the
wireless network into functionality from the command line.  i have
been unable to duplicate whatever it is doing (and i've been doing the
iwconfig/iwlist scanning solution manually for years on other
computers--even set up wpa-supplicant manually once, maybe 2 years
ago), and so have resorted to running the xfce4-panel with just that
dude (well, nm-applet) in.  it works, but it is kind of silly to run
that panel without a real window manager (my "window manager" just
fullscreens every app and lets me toggle between them).  however,
nm-applet works flawlessly, even if the panel is mighty confused
(tends to jitter back and forth between the top and the middle of the
screen.  wish it were something to do with simply loading kernel
modules, because i've tried duplicating the list that show up when NM
runs, and no dice.

anyway as you say, scanning for new networks and autoconnecting to
one-of-the-many-i've-already-setup is way easier through NM, so i
finally gave up and bowed to the dark side of letting that complex
software-stuff do its business.

You tell us.  East coast towns are pretty dense, more like urban
Europe than eastern Portland.  I would like to see a map of fiber
endpoints in the broader region, not just these "rural" towns with
much-higher-than-Portland densities.

The fact remains that provisioning fiber to the home costs about
$1000 per endpoint for something durable (source: the guy that 
installed fiber to my house).  And that is here in suburbia, 
where they string the fiber between poles, and don't run it in
underground vaulting, which costs about $300/foot (source: a guy
from Electric Lightwave, whose company some of us helped get
permission to compete with Verizon here in Beaverton).

If you are willing to personally fork out the hundreds of millions
of dollars necessary to pay for this, go ahead.  Yuppies in the
city of Portland will be grateful, and I will be grateful that my
Portland friends finally get some decent broadband.  But in case
you haven't noticed, there are people in Portland with much more
immediate needs than our internet hobby.  I donate time and money
to them, too.  Go ask a city firefighter: if she could choose only
one,  would she rather have broadband internet, or a non-antiquated
fire engine?

In the Real World, most of this stuff gets paid for by companies
making long term investments, for stable customers who can be
counted on to make the investment profitable.  That is what
Verizon is doing out here in the 'burbs.  Companies don't make
investments in areas where their infrastructure is going to be
"seized", to use your word.  You talk about "paying" them - but
I doubt you will let them set the price.  If I steal your wallet
and let you keep your pocket change, is that "paying" you?

In the long term, fiber is better than wireless, and a lot better
than copper, especially here in the Pacific northwet.  I would
love to see Portland get fiber, and all that copper ripped out
and sold.  But the payback comes over a long period, and
politicians and their constituents want payback within one
political cycle.  Some longer term projects get built, sure,
but if you follow the money through the construction contracts
and back through campaign contributions, it is all short term
politics and short term money.  Provisioning fiber is not like
that, especially because Portland doesn't have the provisioning
companies (and campaign contributors) that can perform a task
of this magnitude.  If there are, you should be talking to them,
not to us.

We will see more fiber in the urban core, the Pearl, and such. 
That is mostly providing fiber endpoints to multifamily buildings,
which is a lot cheaper than bundles of twisted pair copper to
a central office.  A bit later there will be fiber to richer
neighborhoods, because they have political clout.  North Portland? 
Southeast below Powell?  Don't hold your breath.  Portland is a
vast, sprawling city, far less dense than LA.  Unless the city
becomes a lot more successful at attracting wealth, most of it
will stay unfibered for a long time.

   Last autumn Tetra Tech Construction Services, under contract to Verizon,
dug holes under the streets all over this area, installed both large and
small vault boxes, and placed flexible pipe through the system for
installation of fiber cables. I'd be surprised if it cost $300/ft ... then
again, perhaps not.

   The darn paint is still on all the sidewalks, lawns, and streets from all
the multicolor utility markings.

Subject: [PLUG] backup/restore; more questions
Message-ID: <1240258468.8176.2.camel@UrsusMajor>


I used 'dd' to backup the MBR of my primary hard disk thus:

dd if=/dev/sda of=/media/disk/sda.boot.mbr bs=512 count=1

Upon restore I should have received:

/dev/sda1   *           1         996     8000338+  82  Linux swap /
Solaris
/dev/sda2             997       14593   109217902+   5  Extended
/dev/sda5             997        1002       48163+  83  Linux  (/boot)
/dev/sda6            1003        3492    20000893+  83  Linux (/)
/dev/sda7            3493       14593    89168751   83  Linux (/home)

Instead the dd restore omitted the swap area. Is this normal? It seems
to me that one cannot replicate a hard disk Linux installation without
an exact replication of the original disk geography. Is this correct?   

I backed up and restored on an unmounted device from the Ubuntu Live
DVD. Could that have caused the problem? I now perform the same sequence
on a mounted device from single-user mode (init 1). Should that make a
difference?

Thanks

Network Manager has always been a PITA. I went to wicd because the NM
GUI could never find any of the available networks. Maybe once in a
while it would drop down a list. Usually I had to go to the command
line to scan and then connect. Moreover, NM requires you to "unlock" it
before you can do anything. It's time consuming and I don't need that
much security.

Saturday I burned the release candidate of Jaunty and when I was at the
Clinic the next day I booted it up live. Even though Free Geek had
ethernet cables all over the table, I did not plug one in. As soon as
Jaunty was running I noticed an icon in the Gnome panel that looked
like a network icon with bars. It had a red X on it. I clicked on it
and down dropped a list of all available wireless networks, complete
with a percentage for signal strength. I selected Free Geek and in a
matter of ten seconds I was connected. I stayed connected without a
problem for the next four hours. I'm thinking that some serious work
went into NM between Intrepid and Jaunty.

So I have been futzing and tweaking getting ready for the dist-upgrade
to Jaunty this Thursday. And that meant I wanted to get NM working
properly. I reinstalled it (which uninstalled wicd), but I failed to
install all the pieces. Larry gave me the tip and now it is running
fine. I just hope I don't have to go someplace where I have to connect
with wireless before Thursday. 

If you want a simple GUI for network connections I recommend wicd. It
served me well for a couple of years. And if NM turns out to be still
broken after the dist-upgrade on Thursday, I will reinstall it for sure.

weird, that unlocky-bit must be a gnome-ism (or something).  it does
not do that in xubuntu 8.10 where i am always logged in as a
nonprivileged user.  it "just works".

could be.  i have to admit that i have had to do the manually-scan
thing usually, though yesterday in the park it "just worked", telling
me there were a bunch of available new-to-it networks for the first
time ever.

wicd will definitely be my fallback if nm ever fails me (hopefully not
while i'm out of range of another network!)

if i were smart, i'd just install it now just so it'd be on the laptop
already...

The MBR is one piece but the disk partitions are the other part that
is straight from /dev/sda.
Since you are using standard partitioning (not LVM) you can use
something like this
to backup the partition table (extracted from the sfdisk man page):
sfdisk /dev/sda -O sda-partition-sectors.save

I thought the partition information resided on  the MBR and backing that
up would cover it all. I guess I misinterpreted the MBR reference
materials. 

Thanks for the help,

Have you ever been to Vermont?  The network was characterized as
Fiber-to-the-Farm.

  http://ecfiber.net/

Lafayette, Lousiana is not particularly dense either, afaik.  Its
voters. lead by a Republican mayor, decided they wanted it by a 65-35%
margin.  It turned on its first customer back in February.  Its
principle impediment was not financial, it was legal hurdles thrown by
incumbents.  All of which lost, but at the cost of some delay.

Most of the Portland network can be built aerially, like the telephone
and cable infrastructure is.  Downtown, it would be necessary to build
underground, however some of that sub-street conduit already exists.

The estimate is that it'll cost about one lane worth of a
trans-Columbia river bridge to completely build out a fiber-to-
the-premises network in Portland.  That's equivalent to about 3 years
of Comcast service.  Then we'd own it.  Maybe that sounds like a bad
deal to you.  It sounds like a good deal to me.

Just to repeat myself (again?), this doesn't rely on taking stuff away
from the fire department, poor people, health care or a soccer
stadium.  This relies on people redirecting the money that they are
throwing down a rathole on perpetual rent and limited freedom with
incumbents like Comcast, to something that we'll own, that will last a
long time, and that has massively more capacity than existing
infrastructure.

Subject: [PLUG] Abandonware problem and ScummVM...
Message-ID: <1240274170.4037.21.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I recently decided to download a copy of Full Throttle that runs 
on ScummVM from a pirate site.  It seems that to get software 
for ScummVM you are pretty much stuck downloading it from pirate 
sites because anything written for Linux would run on Linux 
directly and either a) be open source or b) commercial and 
purchasable.  I have a copy of full throttle that is legal
for dos which doesn't work so well anymore.

I agree with the notion that current copyright law in the U.S. 
is unethical.  Any software program that is neither supported 
nor sold should not be locked up by copyright.  The purpose 
of copyright is to protect the profitability of writing 
software.  The idea is, it gives you a temporary monopoly 
over that piece of software.  It seems the temporary is 
lost on some people.

So what is the remedy?  Should software go out of copyright
automatically after 10 years if it isn't sold or supported 
anymore?  Should copyrighted software have to be re- 
copyrighted after 10 years for a nominal fee forcing those
who want to abandon a software program to abandon it 
properly?  I like the copyright is 10 years idea.  For
software though, even 10 years may be too long.  After
that there should be a per year charge to keep a program
copyrighted IMHO.

Maybe emulators throw this argument sideways insofar as
old software that is popular could be potentially sold
again with an emulator to make it run on modern hardware.
Thing is, my idea is to make those who want their software
to remain under copyright pay for that privilege after it
has been copyrighted for so many years.

I justify downloading a pirated copy of Full Throttle because
I have one, but what about old games like Warcraft I that I
never did buy a copy of?  That can be downloaded too from
many abandonware sites.  Heck, even Warcraft II can be 
downloaded which seems wrong considering that I bought a
copy not too long ago.

I think the way copyright has been traditionally used when it
comes to software creates a major problem.  The old idea of property
where you own the property forever doesn't make sense when one is
talking about software.  Microsoft has a monopoly.  If Windows 95
fell into the public domain because it isn't supported or sold by
Microsoft and it is over 10 years old, would that still remain true?
How about Windows 3.x, it isn't an OS per se, but shouldn't it be in
the public domain?  Old versions of MS-DOS and Windows are easy to
get a hold of from abandonware and pirate sites, illegally that is
without the source.

Shouldn't someone who wants to compete with Microsoft directly either
via a commercially sold OS or an OSS OS be allowed access to the source
code of old versions of MS-DOS and Windows?

This is an issue with no real clear answer and has very vocal supporters 
on both sides. Although on a *nix mailing list (like this one) you are 
more likely to get opinions leaning towards 'freedom of knowledge is 
good' you have to be careful as it can turn into a political issue. 
Personally I am one that feels copyrights should be cut *way* back 
(especially when software is involved) but it's a tough fight. There are 
organizations that are working to limit coporations' capability to hold 
onto copyrights forever. One of the biggest is the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation, their website is: www.eff.org

Chris,

   No mail reports Sunday morning. Both reports yesterday morning. No reports
this morning, but the output of the 'set -x' ran just after the midnight
invocation. I see a successful conclusion, but no report delivered to me for
that run or the one in /etc/cron.daily. Sigh. Any thoughts?

Then ask yourself when you last had a water outage.

I think the typical cause of that is a gravity outage.

The light in the fiber is more like water than electrons in copper... 
But we should probably have some training if the water department is 
going to run the internet.

Hey Rich,

Is it possible that the script is running fine, it just legitimately
generated no output? What would happen if there was no mail for a
particular day?

Agree to the last.  However, we do not get our water backhauled
from POPs in Seattle and Oakand.  Nor does a pipe splice leak
10% of the water through 100nm gaps.

Boring physics stuff:

Electrons are very much like water molecules, actually, while
light is not much like water at all. If you look at them
statistically, 49% of electrons and water molecules are going
upstream due to thermal vibration.  Look at a waterfall, and
realize that almost half the time every molecule is moving
upstream (very briefly!).   The thermal energy in the direction
of motion is 1/2kT, or 13 milli-electron-volts, or 2.1e-21
joules, which can push a water molecule (3e-26kg) to an 
average thermal speed of 370 meters per second, a lot faster
than the macroscopic average water flow can move. 

An electron (9e-31kg) moves thermally at 70 km/sec.  The flow
rate through a high current copper wire is 4A/mm2, which 
results in an average drift speed of 0.3mm/sec.  It is the
disturbances in the electric field that travel fast in wires.  

Light, on the other hand, travels one direction, thousands of
kilometers through optical fiber with hardly any thermalization
along the way.  A photon is a boson, which means it prefers to
travel in packs.  While some city employees are bozos, and some
vote in PACs, that does not give them any special talents with
bosons.

So light travels more like a school of herring, which penguins
like to eat.  Thus, this post is vaguely relevant to Linux.
However, herring in water pipes, or optical fibers, or on your
hard drive, are very bad.  I would rather have bugs.

   Pickled herring with onions in sour cream is very good. Pickled bugs get
stuck between teeth. Chocolate-covered ants are good, but ants are not
Hemiptera so they are not true bugs.

   Food for thought.

Yeah, but hemiptera suck. It does not matter if it is by design or
evolutionary development.  They suck and always will.  As a point of order
ants do not suck like hemiptera.  But as a point of order they are both bugs.

   Is this a pun, Larry? :-)

>> Or is it possible that this is getting caught in a mail filter somewhere?

   I doubt this very much. I used to see reports mailed from root to me
rejected by postfix because the report had a UCE rejection rule in it.
Haven't seen that in several years.

   What I did not mention in this morning's continuation of the thread is
that logwatch included it's less useful maillog report.

   Yes, there should be a report generated by 1pflogsumm each time it runs.
There is always content in /var/log/maillog and this rotates each day at
04:40am. The report I included in this morning's message was generated at
00:02am today, so it reflects running 1pflogsumm at that time from root's
crontab. There was not another report run at 04:40am which is when
/etc/cron.daily/1pflogsumm is supposed to be run.

   The total lack of consistency and predictability makes it exceptionally
difficult to try to track down the cause.

   Week before last, neither invocaton of 1pflogsumm ran for days; then both
appeared Wed-Sat. Last Sunday, neither. Monday: only the 00:02 run. Today:
neither. But, the details show it ran successfully as the exit code was 0.

Thanks,

Rich

This is a tough one. Companies who develop software for profit have every
right to hold on to the copyright but in the digital world what exactly
defines copyright, is it the software, the code itself and if it's the code
then what is it actually the intellectual property you're trying to protect
or the ability to receive payment for the goods.

I'm certainly not well versed in copyright/IP/patent issues so which of
those should and does cover software and especially as you pointed out what
happens when it is no longer maintained or is abandoned. I agree with
Donkyhotay in that knowledge should be free but I have no problem with
paying for goods/services.

A bit of an aside, when I bought a usb sound card from usbgear.com
it was advertised as being Windows 98SE compatible.  It wasn't.  I 
was told tough when I brought this up and it was suggested that I 
should complain to Microsoft.  If Windows 98SE were open source, 
there'd probably be an open source driver for it.

Microsoft has abandoned the dos/Windows 3.x combo, Windows 95 all
versions, Windows 98, Windows 98 SE, Windows NT all versions, 
Windows 2000, and Windows Millenium.  Sadly, none of these old 
versions of Windows are open source or even freely 
redistributable, although there are web sites that redistribute 
them illegally.

Noone can support Windows 9x except Microsoft and Microsoft doesn't.
This is one of the major problems with proprietary operating systems,
yet it is more common and seemingly more popular to write software
for proprietary systems than it is to write software for open systems.

There is a strong push to support proprietary software on Linux.
ScummVM is part of that push, dosbox another part, virtualbox and
other emulators play a part as well.  Trouble is, will only old
commercial software get support and if that's the case, will it
be legally available?  Changing copyright law to put a limitation
of 10 years on proprietary software makes sense.  The copyright
shouldn't be for the lifetime of the author or company that owns
it.  The government could step in and pass retroactive copyright
reform.  If you are profiting from a software program after 10
years and want to keep it proprietary, you should be able to
pay a nominal yearly fee to keep it that way.

There should be an exception for copyleft software.  Stuff under
the GPL should never come up for renewal.

There are companies out there that have fairly liberal licensing.
One product I use allows me when I upgrade to give away my old
CD's for the program to anyone.  They can register it at no charge.

The reason that there are more companies writing software for the the
proprietary
OS's is that is where the money is.  Also where most of the Eyes are looking
for software (Except in the IT server rooms and that is even moving away).

Windows 2000 (NT5) has over a year of support left, hardly abandoned. An 
OS is made up of many technologies. MS couldn't open source older 
versions of Windows any easier than IBM could OS/2. There is a lot of 
3rd party licensed code in there, and some code is still used in current 
OS's from the old day. Look at the Fonts control panel applet in Win 
3.11 and then in Vista for example. It's identical (and pathetic). And 
Vista/7 has enormous amounts of NT code still in it.

I've heard this argument before and I'm not buying it.  The government
which recognizes copyright could step in and retroactively change the
rules.  Even though Microsoft is afraid to open source old versions of
Windows, the government has no reason to be afraid.  If you honestly
believe that only proprietary software makes money, why do you have
so much faith in Linux anyways?

Copyright is not supposed to protect a company from competition forever.
Microsoft is a monopoly because noone is allowed to work from any of
it's old OS'es.  Efforts to replicate functionality and achieve driver
compatability are taking decades to get anywhere, see ReactOS.  Some old
computers can't support ReactOS even now, but there's no effort to clone
Windows 95 for those machines.  OS/2 should be open source.  Frankly,
I'd like to see what the OSS community can do with OS/2.

Except then software companies could only charge their consumers *once* 
rather then charging them over and over again for the various upgrades. 
If win98 was open-sourced then people would be more likely to keep their 
older computer around and use the open-source updates to keep their 
system running rather then buying new computers. Also if hardware 
drivers and applications maintained better backwards compatibility then 
there wouldn't need to pay $100 or so to upgrade to vista for people 
capable of upgrading their systems individual components and using old 
OS's forever. It's called systemic planned obsolescence and corporations 
love it. Thats what a lot of controversy about DRM is about, 
corporations claim it's to prevent piracy however many people (myself 
included) believe it does nothing to stop piracy, it's only purpose is 
to force people to pay when it expires, and actually *encourages* piracy 
because people get so frustrated by all the restrictions and the need to 
'buy' the same product over and over again. I've believed for some time 
that the main reason most companies refuse to support linux has nothing 
to do with the number of users (though it is *a* reason) but because the 
more people use linux, the more they realize how stupid all the EULA's, 
activation requirements, DRM, copyright restrictions, etc. that you deal 
with daily on windows/osX systems really are. I've introduced many 
people to linux over the past few years and one of the biggest 'selling' 
points are the repositories (I usually start people with an ubuntu). 
Once I explain that although 'store-bought' software won't work I show 
them that just about anything they may want is just a simple repository 
search away. Click on what you need, hit install, you're done. Sure it's 
not for everyone, but most average users can get more from the 
repositories then they ever need. I've been digressing a bit here but my 
point is that many big name corporations make a *lot* of money holding 
onto copyrights and patents for forever minus a day and their not going 
to give that up without a fight regardless of whats 'right' or 'good for 
the public' or even 'best for the consumer'. I'm not one that believes 
copyrights should be removed entirely, with limitations they do some 
very good things and content creators *do* deserve compensation for 
their work, but the flip side of locking everything down (which is where 
we seem headed) is worse then having no copyright at all.

   Update: both invocations of /etc/cron.daily/1pflogsumm ran last night. So

   There is no pattern I see here, which makes it very, very strange for a

Such changes would subject most governments to charges of hypocrisy. It
would be compared to retroactive expropriation. It would also undercut
the US position in bi- and multi-lateral trade negotiations.

To be effective, such a position would have be taken by at least a great
number of governments, and probably by some sort of UN or WTO agreement.
And while an ideal goal, that's not going to happen in a world where
most governments are at least heavily influenced by the backers of DMCA
and similar laws.

In fact, despite the continuing success of open source, the world is
moving somewhat towards additional regulation. W/r/t pirateware, P2P
sites are under legal attack. Boards where information about P2P pirate
sites are shared are also being changed and/or closed.

Yes, DVD Jon had a successful defense, but anything that touches DeCSS
is toxic in a lot of places. Sure, I'd like to see DeCSS in main repos,
housed on US servers, but that ain't happening anytime soon.

While there are exceptions, open source is having success where the
source code is originally (organically?) licensed as open source.

Thanks,
Mike

You don't buy it? What planet are you from? Wanna know a big reason why 
nvidia drivers aren't open sourced? Ask SGI. These things simply are. 
Your reaction is like a kid plugging his ears yelling "LALALALA can't 
hear you! Give me a cookie!" You can't have the government going around 
retro activating laws which affect billions (trillions?) of dollars of 
industry over the last several decades to satisfy the one guy on the 
planets' infatuation with running old Windows games in WINE or on the 
ever-so-popular-please-kill-me-know ReactOS.

This is a really good point[1].  Attempts to replicate functionality
and achieve driver compatibility are taking decades to get anywhere in
GNU/Hurd too.  I really wish someone would talk to the linux devs or
the BSD folks and convince them to open their source.

Jason

The U.S. is party to the [1] Berne Convention and was the most 
aggressive lobbyist for [2] TRIPS, which stipulates that copyright terms 
must extend to a minimum of 50 years after the death of the author and 
that computer programs must be regarded as literary works under 
copyright law and receive the same terms of protection.

So any serious effort to reform copyright laws internationally has to 
start with the U.S., since it was our government that foisted this crap 
on the rest of the world.

As for hypocrisy, consider that the U.S. refused to recognize copyrights 
of non-US citizens until 1891, and only then with [3] caveats.  But now 
we seek to force all nations, including developing nations, to recognize 
ours, for the benefit of big pharma, Microsoft, Hollywood, and what we 
in Portland are fond of calling "the creative class."

That's hypocrisy for you.

[2] 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreement_on_Trade-Related_Aspects_of_Intellectual_Property_Rights

[3] In 1891, the United States finally recognized the copyright of 
foreign authors if they registered their copyright in the United States 
and the book included the proper notice. But copyright of foreign books 
written in English was conditioned on the work being printed in the 
United States or from plates first made in the United States. This 
manufacturing clause would remain in the copyright statutes until 1986.

This comment is hilarious.  First off, WINE is popular with more 
people than ReactOS is.  Second off, there is more to think about
than just games.  Third off, if ReactOS remains behind the latest
version of Windows in software and driver support, it will create 
a problem of sorts.

This problem is somewhat lessened when free alternatives are
created, but Freecraft is a good example of what doesn't work.
How about Autocad and programs like it from the dos era that
are very useful, are there any free alternatives that are 
comparable?  If the only answer to dealing with the problems
of copyright is OSS, how do you pay talented programmers 
enough money to get them to develop open source GPL'ed 
software?  IBM wanted Postfix and that's a unique example 
of a paid for open source program, but can that be 
replicated over and over again?

As far as the trillions of dollars argument goes, I strongly 
disagree.  That is a number pulled out of thin air.  I'm not 
saying do away with all copyrights.  I'm simply saying, put 
a 1 decade time limit on software copyrights.  If you can't 
make a profit on a copyrighted piece of software in 10 years 
time, it's not a very worthwhile piece of software.  The 50 
years idea is ludicrous.  Copyrighting something beyond the 
lifetime of it's author and/or the owning company is also 
ludicrous.  The trouble is, the current copyright regime in
the U.S. and around the world creates permanent monopolies.

Question, why hate ReactOS?  ReactOS is simply an attempt 
to make an open source Windows NT compatible operating system.
Can you prove that it's better to just develop WINE further?
Do you know how to get more software producing companies to
write for Linux?  If the software, like Rick Rocket for
example, is proprietary, does it really make any difference
that it's written for Linux instead of Windows?  Seems to
me that any copyrighted software creates major headaches
for the public.

I'm not just one person who is interested in old games and
other old programs.  Many people are interested in old 
software of various types.  New computers may be cheaper
than they have been historically, but they are still 
expensive and not everyone wants to put up with the latest
DRM and other crap in Vista.  For all the time Vista has
been out, a lot of people are either sticking with XP or 
going to Ubuntu.

If the retroactive part would be too much, I don't think it
would be, non retroactive reforms could be pursued.  Windows
Vista if a 1 decade time limit were imposed today would still
be copyrighted.  Windows XP which came out in 2002 would still
be copyrighted.  Windows 2000 would still be copyrighted.  
However,  all versions of Windows prior to Windows 2000 would
not be copyrighted.  Microsoft could still sell Vista and in
the not too distant future Windows 7, though they might have
to compete with older versions of Windows which someone else
could pick up and develop.  There is supposed to be some
competition.  For the majority of software programs today,
you simply have to run either Mac OS X or Windows XP/Vista.
There are a lot of programs for Linux, but few programs
are designed for Linux relatively speaking.  Go to the local
convenience store, where is the Linux software?  Where is the
Linux compatible hardware?  A lot of hardware will work with
Linux, but my I/OMAGIC USB2 DVD Writer for example doesn't.

Saying that people who are interested in old software that is
not freeware are pirates is harsh.  Built in obsolence is a
nasty and cruel practice.  It creates a lot of junk as people
go out and buy new computers every 3-5 years.  A software pirate
to me is someone who goes after a program that a company is 
still making money on and tries to sell copies of it without 
paying for them.  There is some evidence that software piracy
makes the author of the software more money in the long run
if the price for a legal copy is reasonable.

If memory serves, Walt Disney Productions was a major player in 
extending copyrights because they still had lots of potential revenue in 
their animated movies, and letting them into the public domain would be, 
to their minds, akin to throwing money away.

If memory serves, of course.

Now we see those same copyright concepts being applied to software, and 
it may be that the same law applies or people like Gates stepped in as 
did Eisner and had the software laws changed in their favor.  Thinking 
like a Gates, in order to get the masses to pay me I have to make them 
purchase a new OS, which means I have to take older versions off the 
market forever.  I don't want to spend money supporting old software 
because I've realized my ROI for those versions and need a good ROI for 
the current one.

The letter of the law as written today makes it illegal for one to 
obtain a copy of that software without permission of the copyright 
holder.  The Zero-Tolerance kooks would have us put away for talking 
about piracy.  The spirit of the law, I believe, isn't nearly as harsh 
because to have an interest is not breaking any laws.  To obtain 
software in a manner that doesn't take from a company's bottom line 
shouldn't break the law.  MS might argue that "pirating" a copy of 98 
means you aren't buying a copy of Vista, but then Vista isn't our first 
choice so there's no real loss anyway.

Derek,

   Not likely. There're 2G of memory and only system daemons and the few cron
jobs running overnight.

   Both instances of 1pflogsumm ran last night. Strange, eh?

So I suppose if the US changed its position one more time, that would be
flip-flopping....

But in any case, the current position is in support of capitalism, right
or wrong. 

In addition, any change to copyright laws would also change the effect
of the GPL, as it is also a copyright (copyleft) license. And a time
limit would allow others to bring older GPL code into proprietary
software.

Thanks,
Mike

I am suggesting a change for copyrighted, not copyleft software.
Capitalism isn't about a monopolized market, it doesn't work well
without competition.  Greed destroys capitalistic societies.  I am
not advocating socialism, I am simply advocating a sane limit on
how long proprietary software can remain copyrighted.  OSS software
would not have a limit imposed on it.  This change would make it
possible for someone to pick up an old version of Windows and use
it as a starting point to compete with Microsoft, which would be
good for the market.  Microsoft is a very greedy company that is
giving capitalism a bad name.

It is supposed to support 1680x1050 at 75Hz.  Every time I try

Folks, 

If anyone here is considering this request, I suggest that you look at
the archives of PLUG-talk and read some of Mr. Robinson's messages. 

A number of us have added MRC to the subject line of his messages, at
Keith Lofstrom's request. It has helped those who prefer to filter out
what Mr. Robinson has been saying on that list.

Thanks,
Mike

 You are spamming the plug list.  This has nothing to do with Linux
and everything to do with the fact that the bot server is the work 
of a bully.  If someone else is seeing their posting get twisted, I
recommend that they complain about it on plug-talk.

I disagree.  The current position is in support of corporatism, not 
capitalism.  Capitalism, as Thomas Jefferson noted, benefits from a 
healthy and vital public domain.  That's why the copyright clause in the 
U.S. Constitution is prefaced "To promote the Progress of Science and 
useful Arts."  Jefferson was against including any such clause in the 
Constitution at all, but James Madison persuaded him that it was "a 
necessary evil."  (His words, not mine.)  Madison wrote, "What was it 
drove our forefathers to this country?  Was it not the ecclesiastical 
corporations and the perpetual monopolies of England and Scotland?"  He 
stressed the limited nature of the Constitution's monopolies and warned 
that they must be "guarded with strictness agst abuse."  The original 
copyright term in the U.S. was 14 years, once renewable.

Substitute "ecclesiastical" with "multinational" in Madison's rhetorical 
question and that's a pretty good summation of where we are today, 
except we have no place to flee.  We fled several hundred years ago, 
only to find ourselves right back where we started.

I would urge you to read Justice Breyer's excellent dissenting opinion 
in [1] Eldred v. Ashcroft for a more comprehensive and eloquent view of 
ways in which our copyright regime has overextended itself.

Authors of GPL'ed software have no more right to impose their world view 
on the progress of humanity for the next 100-150 years than do authors 
of proprietary software.  Personally, I'm quite happy when coders do use 
the GPL, even happier when they use the BSD license, but it doesn't 
elevate them to sainthood or mean that they are entitled to near 
perpetual control over how their work is used and by whom.  Imagine how 
different the computing landscape would be if the past five decades' 
congresscritters had stayed true to Madison's ideology, instead of 
selling us out to Walt Disney and company.  Do you think there would be 
a GPL, or only a handful of somewhat viable alternatives to one thuggish 
Juggernaut of an operating system?  The GPL and similar are attempts to 
work around and survive in a brutal environment that heavily favors 
entrenched interests.  Capitalism thrives on competition; copyright, as 
it has come to be implemented, crushes the possibility of competition.

snip - Dear Michael (Moore),

I appreciate the additional information. My only quibble here is that in
today's US, corporatism is indistinguishable from capitalism, at least
in terms of current politically acceptable discourse.

At least some recognize the difference. My previous statements on this

Gosh, it sounds like you're suggesting that the GPL does not elevate
Richard Stallman to sainthood. :) No further comment needed.

Don't.

I am sending this from a KDE desktop, because my Gnome desktop won't start. I get my desktop background, but no Gnome panel. Kind of hard to run applications when you have no panel. And Alt-F2 fails to launch a terminal. Luckily the login option to start KDE instead of Gnome works. So here I am with a sort-of working computer.

OK, I have never used KDE before. But I am now poking at it because it's all I can get working. Maybe y'all KDE dudes and dudettes can convince me to keep it. If Gnome won't run, to hell with it, eh?

Meantime, the dist-upgrade to Jaunty is a pile of problems. I recommend y'all hold off.

/me takes this as a departure point for a tangential rant

I *hate* wide screens and that's all people make anymore.  I just want
a nice 1600x1200 monitor, thank you!  I had one of my lovely samsung
204t's suddenly stop wanting to listen to its analog input (or respond
to any of its menu functions) the other day and I was lucky to find a
refurb for sale or all hell would have broken loose.

Why, monitor manufacturers?  For the love of the flying spaghetti

Demand? Also, a 20" or 22" screen can show two 8.5x11 documents side by 
side and read easily without scrolling. For coding some screens can be 
rotated 90 deg. The widescreen also is the shape of almost all video 
media being made today. Personal preference is fine, but really it's not 
hard to see all the reasons most screens are wide these days. Newegg has 
several 1600x1200 displays, but wow. $$$.

Anyone run this on CentOS 5.3?  Secret Maryo Chronicles doesn't
work either because the blankety blank Mesa is too old.  Sheesh ;-)

I download Mesa-7.4.1 source and try to compile it, no go
because it can't find libdrm.

Okay, I go grab libdrm-2.4.7 source code which won't compile because
pkg-config can't find some pthreads thingy:

checking for PTHREADSTUBS... configure: error: Package requirements
(pthread-stubs) were not met:

No package 'pthread-stubs' found

Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables PTHREADSTUBS_CFLAGS
and PTHREADSTUBS_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.

Well how do I take care of this pthreads problem and will there be
more breakage?  Why doesn't the CentOS team address the fact that
Mesa is ancient and most programs won't work?

Has anyone on here spent substantial time working with text (coding,
ideally) on a rotate lcd?  How is the sub-pixel rendering on the eyes
when it's not in line with the text verticals? Do you need to disable
sub-pixel rendering when rotated, or does X do that automatically? (is
there any benefit to using sub pixels when rotated?)

Thanks!

I had dist-upgrade problems with Ubuntu in the past. I only do clean
installs these days. The new Ubuntu 9.04 has been the smoothest install and
configuring I've had. I tried Kubuntu, and I still think KDE 4.2 needs work.
I'll happier with Gnome and Xfce.

John, do a clean install of Ubuntu 9.04 and most of the troubles will go
away.

   I have seen the same advice for upgrading a variety of linux distributions
over many years. Each time I read this I ask why it should be necessary to
scrape off all the old paint before putting on a new coat.

   It seems to me that the distribution creators should know how to clean up
and remove conflicting packages during the upgrade process, particularly if
the default filesystem has changed. I don't mean to be critisizing or
contentious, but would like to understand why, at this stage of linux
maturity, upgrades can cause problems fixed by a clean install.

Safety.  Many linux users customize their software, tweak their configs, and
like things that way.  From what I've seen a linux "upgrade" doesn't wipe
out much, thus leaves conflicting services and configurations.

I would really like to see a test run of a base ubuntu 8.10 config (nothing
changed) moving to a 9.04 installation and see if upgrade conflicts and
issues still arise.  Has anyone tried this?

I presuming you really meant "upgrade". As opposed tor fresh install. My
advice: don't upgrade. Install fresh . I have had problems upgrading to
Hardy and Intrepid. Once I installed a fresh  system, 95% of therm
vanished.  

The only problems I have had  so far with a fresh Jaunty install were
getting my old HP IIcx SCSI scanner  to work with xsane and installing
the new Flash plug-in for Firefox.  Jaunty  removed  the "scanner"
group so now you have to chmod o +x  the scanner device file to get
xsane to work with an HP IIcx. The Flash plug-in for Firefox worked once
I manually installed the  libflashplayer.so file into a ~/.mozilla/
plugins directory. 

There may  be a few small bugs left in the new release. This is not
unheard of in Windows XP or Vista either. My experience with  Hardy and
Intrepid is that anything serious gets an update fix fast. 

Jaunty fixed several nagging minor problems for me. Aisleriot's sounds
no longer die off after a dozen games, requiring a restart. Sounds
generally are one hundred percent better than Gutsy/Hardy/Intrepid  The
new nVidia driver now cooperates with Firefox, finally allowing me to
run Gnome's special desktop effects without Firefox hiding the menu
bar.

Nye,

   This is a people problem that has a solution. Slackware does address this
by adding .new to each changed config file and advising users (in the
UPGRADE doc) to move any customization to the new file before changing its
name to the default. There are still residual issues, however, depending on
what else has changed.

   Still, I think that better communication between distribution preparers
and distribution users could successfully address these issues. Perhaps I'm
naive and wrong about this.

Unfortunately (?), I think Microsoft upgrades suffer from the same
overall problem. Fresh installs lead to fewer problems than upgrades
there too. 

One thing I do to deal with the upgrade cycle is have a separate
partition for my /home directory. It at least preserves my basic
settings when I do fresh installs. Though I had a strange problem with
Evolution (lost about a month of email) when I dual-booted the 32- and
64- bit Hardy Herons on my Core 2 Duo.

It re-emphasized the importance of regular backups for me.

Thanks,
Mike

Oh, yes.  In fact, the old-timers on this list will remember the early 
days of Unix, you know, when they had manuals and one was required to 
read them, that multiple filesystems was the norm.  It was probably more 
because of the relative unreliability of drives at the time, one could 
lose a drive and not lose the entire environment.

It was for me a crude backup system, though I did find that some 
configurations were better left off the new install so I would instead 
rename my directory, install and then migrate back the irreplaceable 
things like email.

Now I use backuppc to a dedicated drive and wouldn't mind losing the 
home directory.  At most I would lose a day's worth of email threads.

Because they are just rebuilding and repackaging Red Hat Enterprise
Linux.  Enterprises are
not interested in things like game support on their servers.

I run CentOS 5.3 on my work desktop.  I use it because it is the
closest to RHEL5 that
I can get without spending (or causing the company) to spend money.  I
do have paid
support for two copies of RHEL5 as this is for our version control
repositories.  Had to
go with RHEL as the company already was using Clearcase and IBM only supports
Clearcase on RHEL or SUSE.

If you really need to get a fresher package into CentOS, the easiest thing
to do is to grab the package from the Fedora repository.

I download Mesa-7.4.1 source and try to compile it, no go
because it can't find libdrm.

Okay, I go grab libdrm-2.4.7 source code which won't compile because
pkg-config can't find some pthreads thingy:

checking for PTHREADSTUBS... configure: error: Package requirements
(pthread-stubs) were not met:

No package 'pthread-stubs' found

Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables PTHREADSTUBS_CFLAGS
and PTHREADSTUBS_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.

Well how do I take care of this pthreads problem and will there be
more breakage?  Why doesn't the CentOS team address the fact that
Mesa is ancient and most programs won't work?

Helpful hints to preserve a previous environment 


Tar the /home/<your_user_name> directory. That will safeguard
your .evolution, Seamonkey and Thunderbid mailboxes, preserve your
Firefox/Seamonkey settings, any programs/scripts you wrote and put into
your own bin directory, your aliases, .bashrc and .profile startup files
and anything else you put there.        

To keep a record of every program you installed, use the  "dpkg
--get-selections" command in a terminal. That will output a list of
installed programs. Use dpkg --get-selections | awl '{print $2}'  >
installed_progs.lst and save the list. Those names can be used as
arguments to 'sudo apt-get install --install-recommends' to install what
you had.

Alternatively, if you have enough disk space, you can just back up an
image of the entire disk.  In single user (init 1) mode, use dd
if=/dev/[your drive_device_name] of=hard_drive_image.bin. Use the 'sudo
fdisk -l" or 'mount' commands to ascertain the drive device designation.
The resulting file will be an exact image of the entire drive so you'll
need an even larger space on anther disks to store it. This is also
useful for backing up a Windows (or any other op system) installation
instead of paying for ghost.

All,

In the thread on CentOS someone indicated that the OS is as close to a free
version of RHEL5 as one can get.  My question is, do you have to do anything
special with CentOS to get software that only installs on RHEL5  to install
on CentOS?

We do a lot of testing on 1 RHEL4 vmware image, and I've been on the fence
about paying $350 for an activation for RHEL5 when we don't utilize support
for anything. I don't believe I've updated my RHEL4 image in four years.
Would CentOS be the better way to go?

thanks,

As a rule, EPEL does not replace anything in the stock distribution.

Asterisk, for example, isn't there as there is a dep on a newer speex
than ships w/ RHEL 5.x... :-(

And cost.

Demand for the 16:9 aspect ratio means more production means more cost
efficiency means cheaper panels available to wrap flashing around and support
with standard electronics.

But you knew that.

most thing will work just fine.  a few will look into /etc/redhat-release 
and whine if it doesn't have the magic redhat version name.  a quick edit 
is usually all that needs.  i did just hear an anecdote yesterday about a 
program crash happening on centos that went away when the system was 
reinstalled with real redhat.

Not in my experience.  For example, I use electronic design tools from 
Altera and Xilinx.  These tools are only officially supported under 
RHEL, but they work fine under CentOS.

I sometimes describe CentOS as RHEL with the serial numbers filed off.

Gee, I was just about to update Gutted Gutsy to Handy Hardy[1].  LTS is good
there for another two or four years, desktop and server.

Thanks for being our bleeding edge.

You mean to say the obvious benefits of KDE aren't winning you over yet?  :)


[1]  I was distracted by other things and missed the EOL, last Saturday, for
Gutsy.  Not only did they cease providing new patches, the repositories are
offline preventing me from installing stuff that was current 10 days ago.

I still can't get Gnome to run properly. Actually, it comes up fine and
my custom screen background looks the same as it did before. It's just
the panel that is missing. And Alt-F2 won't open a terminal. However, I
can get to the command line with Ctrl-Alt-Fx and back to the GUI with
Ctrl-Alt-F7. And Ctrl-Alt-Del pops up the shutdown options window. And
the bluetooth mouse is working.

I really think all that is wrong is that the panel is not coming up. 

>From the command line I tried killall gnome-panel but it said there was
nothing to kill. So then I did sudo apt-get install gnome-panel and it
said I already had the latest version.

I also tried dkpg --configure -a, which announced that there were 56
packages that had been installed automatically and were not required.
So I did apt-get autoremove and got rid of them. They were all
libraries except Vuze, Azureus and Gnome-gtk. Not sure what Gnome-gtk
was for, but removing it didn't change anything. And I also edited
xorg.conf to switch from nvidia to nv. 

I also tried the session option to boot to Gnome-failsafe, but it got
me the same screen without a panel. Apparently Gnome-failsafe runs
Gnome without any startup scripts. But it didn't help.

Still poking around.

And no, I'm not interested in a clean install. That would take days to
get things reconfigured. I have apps that took me a lot of work just to
get them to run, and I don't always remember how I did it. I have been
doing upgrades with Ubuntu since Burpy Buffalo, or whatever it was that
I started with four years ago. Sometimes there is something to fix, but
it takes less effort than a clean install. Eventually I'll figure out
this problem too. And I'll learn something in the process as well.

But if anyone has any suggestions, I'd love to hear them. 'Cause KDE is
driving me crazy. Can't find the buttons for stuff.

yup.  hardy is our standard platform until another LTS comes out.
which mark shuttleworth recently intimated might be 10.10 instead of
10.4 as one might have supposed:

my colocated machine (2,312 miles from here) is still running 6.06
LTS.  i am so happy with ubuntu's promise-keeping abilities re: actual

here's what i did when feisty fell off the support and caught me
unawares.  i presume gutsy is in the same boat--no new updates, but
old ones still available here:

The closest is OpenSuSE, but that's not *REALLY* close.

But based upon some spot checking it's a little closer than Fedora -> Red
Hat.  Not MUCH, but a little.  YMMV depending on what you're doing.

We've just installed an application at work that "requires" RHEL.

The vendor rep who visited had CentOS VMWare images that he used for training
and demos of the software.  The custom install script also will accept CentOS
when examining /etc/redhat_release

When is RHEL required?  When support checks for it while examining the system
in the course of a support call. I am told if they find CentOS rather than
RHEL they will refuse to provide support.

The "serial numbers filed off" description is apt.

I've also missed the EOL for Gutsy.   Is there anything I can do other

   Every now and then this happens on Slackware with Xfce, too. No panel. I
do get a command dialog box with alt-f2 and can type 'xfce4-panel &' to
restart the panel. The session manager keeps it coming back.

   Can you restart the panel manually? Does a right-click on the main window
bring up a menu from which you can open a terminal?

You can also use Oracle Unbreakable Linux which is using the same
model as CentOS but
with the expertise of Oracle doing tweaks to allow Oracle DB to run better.

It is free to download and use.  The service support (which Oracle
does) is ~$100 a year.

I have both RHEL5 and Oracle EL5 running side by side.

I run a slightly different clone called Scientific Linux.  It is
also RHEL5 with the serial numbers stripped off, and is package
compatable with RHEL5 and CentOS5.  I run SL5 instead of CentOS 
because the distro is used by thousands of scientific computing
sites around the world, has a full time paid support team at
FermiLabs, and has optional packages for scientific computing;
clustering tools, scientific visualization, and the like.  I run
commercial CAD tools targeted for RHEL on it without problems.

The most attractive aspect of SL is that it has very long term
support;  FermiLabs is still providing package updates for
installations running SL3 ( RHEL3).  Some very big compute
jobs run on superclusters for years - they don't stop them
to upgrade distros.  The down side is that you don't get
the latest/greatest hardware drivers with this approach. 
RHEL5 / SL5 resembles Fedora Core 6 .  However, if you are
running server/desktop hardware, or older laptops, this will
work just fine. 

If RedHat offered such long term package upgrades and support,
I wouldn't mind paying their license fees;  although SL is free
as in beer (and freedom), that is not its prime attraction. 
But I don't like to be forced to upgrade distros merely because
Red Hat stopped providing package updates for the distro I am
happy with.  I have better things to do than upgrade distros.

You can do an in place upgrade.  They should have stomped all the bugs by now.

Note: I did not take this route when I figured out what was going on last
night at 9:30.  But I will within the next week and I can let you know how it
worked out.

yup.  check out my mail in the original thread for replacement lines
for your /etc/apt/sources.list file.

however, no *new* updates will be made, so bugs & security holes
discovered going forward will be unpatched no matter whether you
apt-get update or not.  (and, once you do it once, you'll be as
updated as you will ever be.  but i found it useful for installing
new-to-that-machine programs that i happened to need more than for
updates).

Yup, there is one package that provides links to the updates of the Red
Hat Network. While it uses yum, the configuration files for the repo are
in a non-standard location.

(of course, this does not include those packages which have to be
reprocessed to remove Red Hat trademarks)

The "disadvantage" of CentOS is the time lag. It takes time to process
the updates provided by Red Hat under the GPL. It takes additional time
to process it into a complete distro. Don't know if it's still true, but
CentOS at least at one time had to use non-Red Hat tools (or something)
to compile the source code packages.

So the packages you see in CentOS are generally some short number of
weeks behind. If there's a critical update, you should be able to pull
the source code packages from ftp.redhat.com and build them as needed.
But that takes time too.

Thanks,
Mike

rhel 3 is still being supported by redhat as well.  they will be 
supporting it until oct 31, 2010.

and it looks like sl will be following the same timelines:

   A couple of months ago I upgraded my wife's laptop from xubuntu-7.04 to
-8.10 with no problems. It took a few hours, but that was OK.

The problem is that I can't get a terminal open in the GUI. Alt-F2 does
nothing. I can get to the command line with Ctrl-Alt-F1, but when I
give it the command 'gnome-panel &' it just announces "Cannot open
display." Of course it can't, 'cause I'm not in the GUI.

I need to get a terminal open in the GUI, but Alt-F2 doesn't work. The
keyboard and mouse are otherwise working fine. I'm just staring at a
completely blank screen. I don't like icons on my screen, so I turned
off the desktop visibility a long time ago. Normally when I boot up I
get a blank screen with the one Gnome panel that has all my stuff on it.

It's troubling that Alt-F2 isn't working, because that may be
symptomatic of a deeper problem than just a missing panel. I mean,
suppose I do finally get a GUI terminal window open and try to launch
an app from the command line. What if it won't launch? But I'm
borrowing trouble here. First I need to get a GUI terminal up and then
I can figure out what is going on.

Does anyone know any other secret way to get a terminal window open
besides Alt-F2?

have you tried:
gnome-terminal -display :0

or even just:

xterm -display :0

Hi,

I don't know the solution to your overall problem, but I can give you
some small advice about terminals.

Use the following command to tell your console terminal where your display is,

  export DISPLAY=":0.0"

That's the magic env-var that your xterms are using to pop things up
on your display. If you do that and then run your X apps they should
properly appear in your GUI. Well, until you hit the next problem :)

Hope that helps!

Try right clicking while the cursor is on the root window.  With gnome 
under CentOS 5.3, that brings up a menu, and one of the menu items is 
'Open Terminal'.  If that doesn't work, try the other mouse buttons.

In place upgrade?  I'm not familiar with the term.

Seeing how the repositories and such are gone, I no longer have an 
option to upgrade to 8.04 from the updater?

I actually discovered that I couldn't get access the repositories when I 
was trying to get gparted working to format a new hdd.  I was able to 
use my live disc to accomplish the task, which was step one towards 
backing up and upgrading the system to 9.04.

I guess I'm just confused about what my best route is at this point.  
Should I download and burn a DVD and try to upgrade with that, or just 
start clean?  Last time I did a clean install it was after I tried to 
upgrade to 8.04 and lost access to my hdd.  In light of that, it seems 
like I might be best off just skipping the upgrade step?

I guess all I have to lose is time by trying the upgrade...

But I know a clean install would fix my non-functioning GPU, as well.

Ah, choices...

So, if I use:

deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu gutsy main universe
restricted multiverse
deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu gutsy-updates main universe
restricted multiverse
deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu gutsy-security main
universe restricted multiverse


Will that work for installing new programs or updating those that I 
already have?

Can this help me update from 7.10 to something more recent?

   Can you restart the panel manually? Does a right-click on the root window
bring up a menu from which you can open a terminal? I don't know Gnome, but
this brings up a menu -- the same one that's on the panel -- and let's me
select applications from it.

I can attest to that case.  Clearcase support from IBM, this is true.

Well I run both.  Security updates from Red Hat are normally available
within hours for CentOS.
The CentOS team follows the cert notices for Red Hat and act.
Updates that are not published via update e-mails show up within a day or two of
Red Hat positing the source rpm on the Web Site.  Now a release, minor
or otherwise does
take time to build and test new images - 4 to 6 weeks.

yes to both.

i don't think you need the old distro mentioned at all in sources.list
to upgrade--my method of upgrading has always been to change those
lines to the new release (ie jaunty) and do apt-get update; apt-get
dist-upgrade.  that may not be the right way to do it, i just remember
that from the bad old debian days (which drove me off with
too-infrequent releases, followed by too-frequent releases...)

this might be a bit of over the top, but have you tried installing
gnome-do and using that to open a terminal?

Aaron Jorbin <aaron.jorbin at gmail.com> dijo:

Tried that, and suggestions from Joe, Heath and Aaron. The problem is
not yet resolved, but I have different error messages that may be
revealing to someone who knows more about things than I do. 

First, evidently the syntax for the display suggestions is (e.g.)

gnome-terminal --display=:0.0

That is, it needs a double dash in front and no spaces between the =
and the argument. Once I gave the commands in that format I stopped
getting "unable to parse" error messages. Unfortunately, the commands
still didn't work, but at least now I know the correct format.

Heath's suggestion needed slight syntax revision also, but after fixing
it to:

export DISPLAY=:0.0

It worked without error messages. However, it doesn't seem to have
solved the problem. That is, right after giving the command I tried
"gnome-terminal" and got "Failed to contact the GConf daemon; exiting."

When I did:

gnome-terminal --display=:0.0

I got the most interesting error message of all:

Failed to get the session bus: dbus-launch failed autolaunch D-BUS
session: Autolaunch error:  X11 initialization failed. Falling back to
non-factory mode. Failed to contact the GConf daemon; exiting.

I'm hoping someone here can translate that.

As for Aaron's suggestion to install gnome-do, I succeeded in
installing it, but can't figure out what to do with it. According to
the man page "the hotkey to summon the gnome-do interface is <super>
+space." Does <super> mean as superuser? Or what?

And to those who suggested right-clicking on the root window, bear in
mind that there are no windows on the display at all, root or
otherwise. It's just a completely blank screen showing my wallpaper. I
did try right-clicking and other clickety things, but nada. The mouse
and keyboard work, but there is nothing to click on and no windows to
type in.

I do have another ordinary user that I created a long time ago for
emergencies. I haven't tried to log in as him, or as root. I'll do that
after I send this.

give up on gnome-terminal and use xterm.  it's not as fancy, but doesnt 
rely on all the rest of gnome running.  obviously you have some startup 
problem, so you might want to check your x logs (not sure exactly where 
ubuntu puts them).

probably /var/log/Xorg.0.log, unless it changed between hardy and jaunty...

there is usually a per-user log as well.  under redhat it is 
.xession-errors.

Your wallpaper/desktop is the root window.

That's a good idea.  I also agree with Joe.  I think you've got some 
sort of session initialization problem.  Trying a different user 
should allow you to avoid possible customization issues with your own 
account.  You should also try the xterm suggestion.

I'll consider xterm later.

Right now I am thrilled to report that Gnome-do did the job. I am
happily writing this in Gnome with my panel and everything apparently
working as before the upgrade to Jaunty.

As I said in my last message, I logged in as my alter ego "jcj." Good
old "jcj" had a normal screen with the Gnome panel. Yay! Then I logged
out jcj and tried to log in as root, but Ubuntu said root can't log in
from the start window. Oh well.

So then I logged in as myself "jjj" and when I did there was this
little display in the middle of the screen. It was Gnome-do and it said
I should start typing. So I typed gnome-panel and hit enter. And my
panel came right up. Yay!

Now I need to figure out how to make it permanent. But at least I can
get gnome-panel working. And I can get a gnome terminal and anything
else I need.

Thanks for all the tips. Ain't it fun to sleuth out stuff that's
broken? And look at all the neat tricks I have learned. :)

I'm just thankful that I have the time to devote to fixing stuff right
now and a team of PLUGgers with the brains to give me suggestions.

In KDE if I right click on the background, I get a menu with the "run

   That, John, is the root window. It has no application windows on it, but
it is a window. You don't see the frame because it is the root; the
container for all other windows displayed (e.g., the panel, terminals, and
applications).

I wonder if your jjj user is missing the gnome panel applet in the
startup thing for gnome. Now that you have the panel you can look at
applications that are set to start up when the user logs in. Also
blowing away the old .gnome and .gnome2 directories in jjj's home
directory might yield more info. I suspect something in one of the
configs that lives in those dot directories since your other user can
login fine.

Back them up first because it'll probably wipe out your background
wallpaper and other settings but then you can start draggin and
droppin stuff into the newly created .gnome/2 dirs that will be
created at startup and figure out what the culprit is.

Ack! The boy spoke too soon. :(

After I launched my mail client (Sylpheed) I quickly discovered that it
popped up on top of the panel, which nothing used to be able to do.
Worse, I can't drag it around with the mouse. And there are no little -
and x buttons in the window.

This is the window manager, right? Whatever it is, it's not working.

Off to google on Gnome window manager to see if I can figure out what
it's called.

You definitely need a window manager in order to get borders, title
bars, X buttons, panels, etc.

Does your gdm login screen give you the option of picking a window
manager?  I always suggest keeping a lightweight WM around for
emergencies.  Try fluxbox, or even xfce4.  You can use it while trying
to fix gnome.

Every X-enabled box should have twm, though it's rugged.  I don't
think it will be called twm in your gdm login screen interface.  Maybe
it will be called "default".

Well that explains why when you login you're not getting the panel because
the Window Manager isn't running when you login. The panel applet isn't
dependent on the entire WM running so that's why gnome-do will let you
launch it.

See my response in the other thread about deleting the dot dir's for gnome
to see if there is something in there that is causing the issue.

Turns out it's Metacity. Problem is solved if I just type "metacity" in
a terminal window.

So I went into System > Control Center > Startup Applications and added
Metacity and Gnome Panel. Then I restarted the computer. When I logged
in everything was back to normal.

I think it's fixed. However, I wonder why the dist-upgrade to Jaunty
decided that I didn't need a Gnome panel or a window manager. Very
strange, that.

It's *probably* the result of a bigger, more general problem with
gnome-session.  I imagine other things are probably broken that you
don't know about yet.  Backing up your .gnome* directories/files and
reconfiguring gnome is probably a very good idea.

It could also just be an issue with gdm -- the graphical dohicky that
takes your username/password -- but this sounds much more like a
gnome-session issue to me.

I already suspected what you just said. I was hoping no one would say it. :(

But I'm just going to carry on until I find something else that's broken.

Subject: [PLUG] Remote Desktop under Ubuntu
Message-ID: <49F35FAD.1090906@wescottdesign.com>

Clues, clues, clues for the clueless?

I'm running Intrepid.

I'm struggling with the Ubuntu help on remote desktops.  Seemingly I'm 
being told how to share my Ubuntu desktop for Windows users, and how to 
remote into a Windows desktop -- but I want to remote from one Ubuntu 
machine to another. 

As best as I can tell I should use Ubuntu's Vinagre "Remote Desktop 
Viewer", but when I try to connect all I get is a brief flash and an 
error window saying "Connection to host servo.local:5900" was closed.

My system log says "WARNING: Unable to find provider 'gnome-wm' of 
required component 'windowmanager'"; but this comes up during boot, not 
when I'm trying to connect.

Does anyone have a story on how to get this to work?

TIA

I've been using 'tightvncserver' on the host and 'xtightvcnviewer'
as the client on my Hardy (8.04) systems.

I am recalling an interesting thread from a couple months ago where I
asked how to save commands. I have found something that suits me
perfectly and it was not mentioned in that thread. While looking for
something in Synaptic I stumbled upon gedit-plugins. It has a lot of
neat features, but the one I love is a bottom panel that is a terminal
window. Now I can just use gedit as my terminal and, when I want to
save a command, paste it into the document window above. Not only that,
but the terminal panel recognizes Ctrl-c, Ctrl-x and Ctrl-v.

Gnome terminal sees ctrl-shift-c as 'copy' ctrl-shift-v as 'paste'.  It 
doesn't seem to do ctrl-x, but then I've never needed to use it until 
just now when I wanted to know...

Hmmm. That's interesting. My gnome-terminal does not (Jaunty, x86_64).
I can select text, but to copy to the clipboard I have to go to Edit >
Copy, and ditto for paste. The keyboard commands don't work. Selecting
does auto-copy to the clipboard and then the middle mouse button will
paste, but I hate that. My middle mouse button is the scroll wheel, and
it doesn't like being pushed down. It demonstrates its displeasure by
moving the cursor all over. And then the text I wanted to paste is
suddenly deselected.

Oh well, Gedit is a good alternative.

   Does your pointy device have two buttons? In xorg.conf do you have
"emulate 3-button mouse" in the device section? If the answer to both of
these questions is "yes," then all you need do is press both the left and
right buttons at the same time to gain the function of the middle button. No
need to abuse the wheel.

   I've not had a wheel on my trackballs, and pressing both buttons
simultaneously has always worked to paste selected text in both consoles and
GUI apps.

This is tangential to your initial problem, but just to clearify: The
text doesn't need to remain selected in order for you to paste it, you
just can't select something else.

But, copy/paste is very messed up in X anyway.  There seem to be at
least two separate clipboards, and they don't cooperate well.

I associate Vinagre with vino. Once vino is installed on the target
desktop, run 

vino-preferences 

in a GUI-based command line. The options should be intuitive. Once
enabled, you should then be able to use Vinagre from a remote system,
assuming you don't have a firewall configured between the systems (the
default TCP/IP port is 5900).


Thanks,
Mike

I don't run Fedora on a server because I can't count on it like 
I can on an Enterprise Linux distribution.  That said, just 
because I'm running a server or a critical workstation does not 
suggest that I don't care about graphics.  Lack of support for 
3D rendering on a critical workstation can be a major problem.  
For a business environment, Fedora is not even acceptable for a 
Workstation.  Supporting the latest version of the ext filesystem
on an Enterprise Linux system doesn't make sense, but video 
drivers should be cutting edge.  If I can't run command and
conquer under Wine because I don't have 3D support, then I
probably can't run a 3D cad application either.  Fedora is too
bleeding edge and CentOS is too far behind.  I don't feel 
comfortable with Ubuntu.

Maybe it would be better if Fedora were more stable and Enterprise
Linux systems were closer to it in some critical areas.

I find the suggestion that a Linux system that is good for games 
is not an Enterprise Linux system to be disturbingly rude.  Many
of the things that games demand from computers are needed by many
businesses.

Message-ID: <20090426214145.GA17189@jamhome.us>

I group I'm involved with recently decided to move its communications
from email lists to an online forum.

Some of the members are not too happy.  "I may be bringing up a very sore
subject, but here goes. I hate this forum!!"  was one of many comments.

Yet others love the forum and really don't want to go back to the
email lists.

Forum software sending you notification of new, monitored or replied to
posts is not enough of a feature for the email crowd to be happy with.

I thought I'd go find some forum software that would accept emails as
an input form.  Essentially one that would look like an email list to

How about installing Debian 5 "Lenny" It is supposed to be very stable and
you can run all the cool things you like.

Ugh.  Being one of ^-- those sorts, I'm imagining mail messages like:

  "click here to read what should have just been mail"

You are describing a google group?

If you really want something you host yourself, you might have luck with 
searches related to the list management software (e.g. nntp+mailman or 
some-such.)

Is there something preventing you from using Yahoo Groups?  I don't know 
your specific needs, but phpBB might be worth a look.  For less of a 
form appearance, perhaps egroupware or courier.

They aren't designed with the idea of getting your data out.

Also you don't have a good way to get data in either.  Never noticed a
way to take an MBOX of old messages, and import it.

For Yahoo, there is yahoo2mbox.  But over time as a group member with 
email enabled you would have received all those messages anyway and 
simply keeping them would be as effective.

For Google their RSS service might be useful.  Again, though, if you 
have been a group member you've been receiving the messages.

I was able to redirect, using Thunderbird and the Mail Redirect add-on, 
all PLUG messages from the last two days to a Google group I just 
created: http://groups.google.com/group/plug-playground/topics.  Dates 
and authors were preserved.  I suppose the same could be done with a 
Yahoo group.

Forum software sending you notification of new, monitored or replied to

Most IT departments don't want anything that doesn't have some level of
technical support that they can fall back on if the local talent cannot solve
the problems or if they get too large to be done without help.

Also most IT departments are very Microsoft centric and want Windows on
the desktop, even ours where most of the revenue on our site is coming from
Unix/Linux.

I'm helping test a Drupal site for a professional organization I'm a member
of and they intend to integrate our forums and our mailing lists. They have
some rudimentary functionality working at the moment, and it's promising but
not quite ready for real time. I'm not sure if they're using an existing
Drupal module, or writing their own, but it's probably worth looking into.

/etc/logwatch/conf/logwatch.conf

Service = "-sendmail"

and/or

Service = "-postfix"

is what I use depending on whether the system is running sendmail or 
postfix.  I've seen on a few systems that were moved from sendmail to 
postfix that it required both.  Too lazy to go find where the default of 
doing sendmail is set.  :-)

I believe in another logwatch file (somewhere) you use a plus sign, 
verses a minus sign, to turn on extra or custom reports.

That's what Ubuntu has me set up with.  I've further found out that 
everything is fine when I connect to just _look_ at the desktop, but I 
want to sit in my living room with my laptop and do work on this machine 
(my office is in a detached building).

It's all on a local network!  It should be the easiest thing in the 
world!  Aaargh!

First, I haven't worked Intrepid, I'm using Hardy.

I do something similar to what you do. For that purpose, I prefer SSH
instead of VNC; I log into the remote system with:

ssh -X username at remotesystem 

which allows me to tunnel individual GUI apps if/when needed. I find it
faster - and easier to set up - than VNC. 

And there's a third option - XDMCP logins - I have a local VMware Server
system with a GDM login screen. The remote (office) system also has a
GDM login screen, with XDMCP enabled. 

But that assumes you can access remote logins from the Intrepid login
screen. (Put the cursor in the username text box, and press F10. I hope
you see a Remote Login via XDMCP option.)

Thanks,
Mike

Thanks to all.  

Before turning to y'all I'd suggested Yahoo! groups, and by extention,
Google Groups, to the group.  Their forum-esque options don't fill some
of the needs of the group.  The lock in isn't too much of a concern,
these folks don't place a high value on posts greater than six months old.

Not that the needs couldn't be adjusted, we'd just end of with less than
hoped for.

phpBB is a security nightmare. And the codebase is a mess[1].

rForum may or may not do what's needed.  Their level of documentation
(is there really any?) doesn't meet my need to be able to hand off the
project onto someone else.

Drupal would definitely be able to handle the task.  As long as you
like using 18 wheeler trucks to pick up groceries.  It's overkill for
the targeted use.

The rForum page did provide me with a thought on how I was Googling for
an answer.  The keyword to use is "integration."

It seems Phorum http://www.phorum.org/ will do it.  For something along
the Drupal lines, Midguard http://www.midgard-project.org/ explicity
supports forum/email integration.

SIDENOTE:   As the email list discussed the forum vs email choice (assuming
both were not an option) it emerged:

 * email fans outnumbered forum fans about 3:1
 * everyone agreed that the forum didn't get as much traffic
 * everyone understood that email is more convienient
 * some people never realized the email list had archives preserving threaded conversations
 * and, surprise to me, people commented that the email list felt more community-esque

Thanks everyone.

[1] One critic of the phpBB codebase stated, while explaining why he hates forums stated:

  Maybe it was the time I made the mistake of trying to read part of
  the PHPBB2 source code.

  After which I attempted to find a rusty spoon to gouge my eyes out
  with, failed, sobbed quietly in a corner for a few minutes, and then
  fucked off early to the pub and drank until the pain was sufficiently
  dulled that I started to be hopeful that one day I would forget what
  that code looked like.

All,

I'm looking for CMS for my neighborhood association's web site. The current
one is powered by joomla, but evidently it's difficult to administer (as
reported by the current admin/non-techie newspaper editor). I'm looking for
something that has ease of use and minimal learning curve, but would be
extensible enough for future growth. I'm not familiar with joomla, and the
last time I looked at CMS's (5~6 years ago) all I knew well was php. Does
anyone have some good suggestions to look at? Again, ease of entry and
minimal learning curve (even, if possible, for the non-techie) is the
priority.

thanks,

Another option which gives you VNC-ish sessions which stay alive, and can 
be re-joined if you disconnect is NX/freenx. I've only used it under Fedora 
and CentOS, and kind of a pain to set up, last I tried. But it's MUCH 
faster than VNC, and worth looking into.

I'm running CentOS 5.3 which is undoubtedly more stable than Fedora.
I'm updated as much as I believe I can be but Mesa is too ancient to
support Secret Maryo Chronicles and Command and Conquer Red Alert for
example.  I want to upgrade Mesa, but finding the home page and 
grabbing the source for Mesa-7.4.1 I find that there is a libdrm
dependency and grabbing libdrm-2.4.9 source code I find that there
is a pkgconfig pthread-stubs.pc dependency.  Digging deeper on
freedesktop.org I find that X is apparently changing radically.

Has anyone updated CentOS enough to run Command and Conquer Red
Alert under Wine?

Yeah I suppose I could drop in another hard drive and try another
Linux distribution, but which one?

I know another group that migrated to Joomla due to it's ease of admin use.
What are the difficulties encountered by the editor?  Drupal, for instance,
isn't bad to administer as long as you're adept at navigating cascades of menus.
It also has a plugin to put an admin bar across the top of the screen that somehow
is easier to navigate, for me at least.

What features do they need?  Full on workflow? Or just gated editing and creation?

My freshly arrived Linux Journal has the reader's choice awards the CMS winners were

  25%  WordPress (not just for blogging anymore?)
  23%  Joomla 
  19%  Drupal

WordPress certainly presents a nice, easy to navigate, easy to customize through live 
drag and drop interface.  The only mental contruct to keep in mind is "posts" vs "pages".
Posts being the things that show up on your front page blog like and pages being the static 
content you present at fixed URIs.

if you're just needing glx stuff you might be able to just load the ati or 
nvidia proprietary drivers, depending on what video card you have.

Based on the feedback of the group members they are going back to using email
lists for communication.  The consensus was the forum was too time consuming
to use.

   Good for them! We had a discussion of this same issue on the LyX users
list a few weeks ago. The newcomers/Windows users wanted a GUI forum, the
rest of us preferred the mail lists. I think someone pointed out that gmane
(or something like that) allows subscribers to read and write from a web
interface.

   As far as I'm concerned, the major difference between a mail list and a
web-based forum is convenience. Mail lists push information to me so it
shows up in my INBOX or the appropriate mail folder. No work on my part.
Fora require me to go to a web page and pull the information down if I want
it. More time consuming and less convenient.

Subject: [PLUG] Can't ping under Ubuntu Intrepid
Message-ID: <49F72DC5.3010402@wescottdesign.com>

More cluelessness...

Ubuntu.  Intrepid.  I'm trying to connect to remote machines (See the 
thread "Remote Desktop under Ubuntu").  I'm doing this so I can work in 
the comfort of my family room, in the relaxing atmosphere of screaming 
kids who need to be intensively nagged to get their homework done, 
instead of the high-stress environment of a quiet office with dogs 
sleeping on my feet and classical music playing in the background.

I can't even ping the other Ubuntu machines on the network?!?  We're all 
one happy family on this side of the firewall, so I assume the problem 
is one of setting up the right permissions. 

Here's what happens: I'm at thishere, and I know that thatthere is on 
and on the network. 
I do "ping thatthere" and I get told "unknown host thatthere".  I do 
"ping thishere" and I get a happy (and fast!) response.

TIA

thatthere is not in your DNS or /etc/hosts file.

Try pinging it by its known IP address to confirm.
Then either plug it into DNS or /etc/hosts

Note, if your search order in /etc/resolv.conf doesn't specify a search order
then you'd need to specify a fully qualified name for thatthere

   What do you have in /etc/hosts?

OK, that's going over my poor little Windows-atrophied head.  I can do 
the running around to ping by IP (although I'm certain it'll work; I can 
ping other machines that have fixed IP addresses on the net).

Can you give me a quick rundown (or refer me to a web page) on just what 
to put in /etc/hosts or /etc/resolv.conf?

Thanks.

   Here's a portion of ours:

/etc/hosts:

127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain   localhost
192.168.55.1    salmo.appl-ecosys.com   salmo mail
192.168.55.1    eia.appl-ecosys.com     eia
192.168.55.2	caddis.appl-ecosys.com  caddis

   Notice it's an IP address, a fully-qualified domain name for the host,
then any appropriate aliases.

/etc/resolv.conf:

nameserver 127.0.0.1
nameserver 192.168.55.1

Does that mean that I need to make my host machine a fixed IP (currently 
I'm getting that from the router)?  Or can I just call my router a 
"nameserver" in /etc/resolv.conf and have it work?

   I don't know. I've always assigned fixed IP addresses to the hosts on the
local network.

   So, 'thishere' is on a different subnet from 'localhost'. Where's
'thatthere' located?

   Consider doing something like this:
 	127.0.0.1	localhost
 	192.168.0.1	thishere
 	192.168.0.2	thatthere

Now they're all on the same subnet.

You can't just call your router a "nameserver" to make it so any more than you
can call me a millionaire to make me financially comforted.

You may be able to configure the router (what is it anyway?) to always assign
thatthere the same IP address.  In which case you could then add it to
/etc/hosts, as Rich demontrated, and have things work.

With the stability of home networks it is pretty, reasonably likely the IP
address for thatthere will never change anyway.  So you can determine what the
address is and add it to /etc/hosts.

If you go that route figure out where to put a reminder for yourself so that
when it breaks you know what you did and why.

Thank you for the useful information, and for the reminder of the depths

the difference between what my router is doing when it assigns IP 
addresses, and what a nameserver is?

If I'm going to play those games I may as well just assign the desktop 
with a fixed address.  We live out in the boonies with enough power 
outages that the network gets a complete power-down and power-up several 
times a month in the winter; that would scramble the IP addresses each

Going back a bit -- there's no way I can just ping by name?

And all this discussion of modifying configuration files -- that happens 
on the client side, _not_ the host side, right?

Tim,

   Your router passes packetes based on their IP address. That is, it routes
the packets from one host/network/domain to another host/network/domain. It
needs to know where the destination host is located relative to the sending
host's location. That's where the DNS (Domain Name Servers) come into play.

   People remember names more easily than numbers, so we assign names to our
individual machines and domains. You might have thishere.mydomain.com, and
thatthere.mydomain.com. Your router will know they are both local by looking
in /etc/hosts. If the destination is remote from your local network, then
the router needs to query a DNS server (defined in /etc/resolv.conf) to find
where to push the packet on its next step.

   Because computers work better with numbers than with words the DNS servers
are larger versions of /etc/hosts, but they associate a name with an IP
address. A Google search will give you all the information you want.

   For a small, home network that's not adding or changing hosts a lot static
IP addresses work very well.

> Going back a bit -- there's no way I can just ping by name?

   Sure. Once you associate that name with an IP address in /etc/hosts.

A nameserver (typically Bind's named) provides mappings from human readable
names to IP addresses and IP addresses to names.  The software on your system
never sends data to www.whatever.tld, it sends it to an IP address. The wordy
names exist solely as a memory aid for people.  So when you do something that
requires your computer to connect to another one and you do it by the name the
underlying software looks up the name to figure out what IP address to send
data to.  For more information:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nameserver

Your router is performing the role of a DHCP server. DHCP - Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol.   Typically DHCP is used to provide IP addresses to
systems that are configured to ask for one.  The do not (usually) tell a
nameserver about the assignment.  It just hands out the address to the system
that requested one. For more information:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhcp

That's good. Is it running stock Linksys software?  If you've installed
OpenWRT or other 3rd party OS on it it can be a nameserver too.  See:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linksys_WRT54G_series

Not necessarily.  The DHCP protocol allows the client to request a particular
IP address.  And it typically asks when half of the lease time has elapsed.
And by default the DHCP server will renew the lease and hand over the same IP
address.  Most (all?) clients keep track of their most recent assigned IP
address and will request the same one.

It is very likely that herethere and thatthere have _never_ changed their IP
addresses.   So putting them in /etc/hosts isn't a bad idea.

The reason I said to make note of it somewhere is because it's likely to be
months or years from now when that breaks and by then you won't remember what
you'd done to get things to work and a note would save you lots of grief.

As an example, where I work DHCP leases are granted for 10 day periods.  Yet
my desktop has had the same IP address for several months now.


> Going back a bit -- there's no way I can just ping by name?

Not the way you have it now.  change  /etc/hosts and you'll be able to do it.

A group I am a member of recently changed from email to forum.  The advantage of 
the forum as I see it is that there can be different groups within the forum, so 
that I can review the threads I am interested in, and skip the esoteric ones I 
am not.  This, however, requires all posters to perceive the various categories 
similarly: does asking about a tire go in General or Technical?

The forum allows notification by email of any new posting in my selected 
categories.  This helps.

As for as time is concerned, I am retired, so I move slowly anyway.

I agree. When I need to go on line with one of my machines,
# /sbin/dhcpcd will get an address from my router.

When I get done, I go back to my static IP address with
# ifconfig eth0 your_static_ip_address up
For example: ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.22 up

I can once again mount NFS volumes, ssh or telnet into another machine etc.

Depending upon your system, the second time that you /sbin/dhcpcd,
you may have to kill the previous dhcpcd with: # killall dhcpcd.

CentOS is really designed to be a server distro so that's why the stuff is
older. They don't upgrade as often because it's not necessary and they
follow RHEL releases. I don't know if it'll work but you could try adding
the Fedora repo's and see if you can grab the newer mesa stuff you need.

I'll take on this task. Definition of terms:

router: thing that routes traffic. This is needed when sending traffic from
one network (192.168.0.x) to another network (the Internet)
thing that assigns IP addresses: DHCP server
nameserver: thing that provides the service of telling you what the IP
address is for a given hostname, and vice versa

The WRT54G may provide any or none of these services, depending on how it's
configured. My understanding of the default configuration is that it
provides routing and DHCP services, but not DNS (nameserver).

Not automagically between linux hosts. Windows does this using some black
magic voodoo called NetBIOS. With linux, you will have to either set up some
DNS solution (there are several different paths for this) or enter them all
into your hosts file.

Depending on what you mean by client or host. In this case, the modification
is generally expected to happen on the machine on which you want to
accomplish something.

That magic voodoo was first implemented (and quite well also) in AppleTalk. 
Novell's IPX also handled such tasks.

It's codified in Zeroconf networking (http://www.zeroconf.org/) and the
defined address range for use is 169.254.0.0/16.  There are RFCs describing
how things should work out and a couple IETF draft standards.  Heck, Carla has
even written Zeroconf up in an article or two.

'ssh 192.168.1.115'.

Works like a charm, and I don't have to modify any files...

I know that CentOS is designed to be a server distro, but I figure since
I tend not to update very often that it will be better to use CentOS
than Fedora.  Sadly, the graphics aren't catching up and who knows when
the next version of CentOS will be released.  I have the following
sources which I compiled to install under /opt2 as the prefix.  How do
I use them?  Do I have to install over the top of the older Mesa?

[michael at eagle new_mesa]$ ls
dri2proto-1.99.3.tar  libpthread-stubs-0.1.tar  schedtool-1.3.0.tar
libdrm-2.4.9.tar      MesaLib-7.4.1.tar

[michael at eagle opt2]$ cat /etc/ld.so.conf
include ld.so.conf.d/*.conf
/usr/lib
/opt2/lib

My 2 cents, use of 'ssh' notwithstanding:

There are some questions not answered here.
1.  How does one choose the addresses for fixed IP Address assignment in a
     home network?
2.  What is the fully qualified domain name of machines behind a router
     in a home network?
3.  If the router isn't a nameserver, what do I use as a nameserver address?

I offer some simple answers from the universe of possibles.

1. The default Local Area Network (LAN) IP address range of a WRT54G
     is 192.168.1.1/255, according to the WRT54G User Guide.  Address
     192.168.1.1 is the default LAN address of the router itself.  All other
     addresses in that range are eligible to be assigned as fixed....BUT...

     If the router is configured to provide addresses via DHCP, (which I
assume
     yours to be, bein' as how it has apparently been happily providing
     addresses all along) the default range of DHCP addresses under its
control
     starts at 192.168.1.100.  That means that, for sanity's sake, the range
of
     eligible fixed addresses is 192.168.1.2/99.   That should be more than
enough
     for a home network.

     This approach is predicated on the assumption that the router is in a
more
     or less default state.   To verify this, you're gonna hafta put on an
admin
     hat and try to talk to the web interface of the router.  Simply enter
the URL
     192.168.1.1 into a browser.   If you get prompted for an admin name and
     password, chances are the default configuration holds (not necessarily
     a good thing).  I you don't get the prompt, you could try 192.168.0.1,
or
     10.0.0.1.   If you want to pursue this track, get a WRT54G UserGuide
     (google, download, free, try
        http://www.linksysbycisco.com/US/en/support/WRT54G/download
     )
     and 'Read More About It'.

     So this gives you a set of choices for fixed IP addresses.  What about
     FQDNs (do not pronounce this phonetically in a room full of kids, else
     be prepared to suffer 'humiliations galore'), acronym for Fully
Qualified
     Domain Names).   On to...

2.  If you have purchased/registered your own domain name, you are home
     free: use that.   If not, make one up.  Since your machines are behind
     a firewall, it shouldn't matter, but discretion is in order.  I use
'.local',
     which was suggested by some site when I was first figuring this stuff
     out.

     Now there's enough to populate a /etc/hosts file (using yours as a
template):

        127.0.0.1        localhost.local localhost
        192.168.1.2    thishere.local   thishere
        192.168.1.3    thatthere.local thatthere

        # The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
        ::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
        fe00::0 ip6-localnet
        ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
        ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
        ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
        ff02::3 ip6-allhosts

   So what about resolv.conf and the nameservers...

3.  Your ISP has nameservers for you.  They should be already programmed
     into your modem, and possibly even automatically set up in your router,
     as evidenced by the fact that you can ping named hosts in the great
     world ('out among them English').
     Rich's example uses his local nameserver IP address (192.168.55.1), and

     several from aracnet, which I assume to be his ISP.  You should have
     yours around somewhere in some information from your ISP, or they
     might even be in the help section of your ISP's web site, if they are
worth
     their salt.  The 'domain' line in resolve.conf I have found to not be
necessary
     for my simple home use.

For this to effective for your network, all machines that you want to assign
fixed addresses to need to have /etc/hosts and /etc/resolve.conf files
modified
with the same information.

(a bit wordy for 'simple answers').

I found FlatNux to be small, easy to install (basically untar into a 
directory), no database needed and easy to configure for the basics.  If 
you want a little more performance and features, then Drupal is the 
right choice.  It does use a database but is dead simple to install and 
configure.

CentOS does get hardware updates.  The latest 5.3 update support the I7
processors and associated motherboards.

I'm sure they get kernel updates but being that mesa and what Michael
is referencing is part of X they probably won't get as much scrutiny
or updates.

I'd try and find source rpms instead of doing it the way you are
trying because then you screw with package tracking and dependencies
which is never good.

Thanks Tony.  Some of that I already knew, but you tied it together well 
and filled in some vital bits.

Hmm, that's why I set the prefix to /opt2 so I'm not installing over
anything preexisting.  

I've tried openredalert, it isn't playable.  I'm not sure why that 
is.  Events that are supposed to trigger don't.  You are supposed 
to have Tanya, you never get her.  Einstein is supposed to show up,
he never does.  There is junk on the left side of the screen in the
objectives area.  Overall, the first scenario is impossible to win.
I got further with openredalert compiling it from source, but it's
no better than freera and freecnc which strangely enough aren't
developed anymore.

I am at a loss as to what it takes to update Mesa for crossover 
linux so that this game will work correctly.  I am worried that 
things will break.

The problem with compiling to /opt2 is that X is going to be looking for the
shared objects and other library foo that is built with these packages that
it's not going to work any better. What you end up with is removing the
packages you're building for and creating symlinks from /opt2/$foo to where
X expects the libraries to actually live. So you really don't gain much
IMHO. Others might disagree and I'm willing to listen to the arguments.

I hate to be the one to say this. I think you need to look at a different
distro for your gaming needs. I believe you mentioned dropping in a second
disk and installing another distro which keeps more up to date with X
updates and things of that nature.

You've stated a few times that you think Fedora is too unstable. Have you
had any experiences that lead you to that belief? I have had really good
experiences with the last few releases and some of the graphics foo if not
updated through the normal channels can be found in 3rd party repo's like
Livna. They also offer custom "spins" geared towards certain niches, one of
them including gaming IIRC. So it might be worth the time and bandwidth to
actually give it a try.

I'm a Slackware user, however if you're used to clicky pointy drag n' drop
then it's not really gonna work for you. Also unless it's a security update
you're not going to find a lot of updates to things like Mesa unless you run
up with the -current branch which may and has broken things in the past.
There is a distro based on Slackware that is quite a bit more friendly
called Zenwalk which might fit your needs though.

Also there is always ^buntu's ... which I'm sure you can find plenty of
support for on this list as I get the perception that most of the folks on
list use some derivative.

The name escapes me at the moment but there is a blob of software out there
that makes gaming much easier on Linux with some custom packages and such
and has pretty wide distro support. It's a pay for deal but it's rather
cheap if I recall correctly. I used it back in 2003 when I was playing
Counter Strike =) Might be a better alternative to getting Crossover
Office/Linux to force these games to try and work. I'll see if I can dig up
the name of the software and I'll post back when I get a chance.

Cheers,
Drew-

It was called Cedega but I take it from a good friend it's now called
Crossover Gaming but not they are not part of the Crossover Office team.

Subject: [PLUG]  Content Encoding Error
Message-ID: <1240991904.1255.92.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hi All,

I've got a problem that I hope you all can help me with.

The goal: A content filtering proxy server for a small number of users
that don't need to pay for the service, no need for a captive portal.
Log file display or conveyance has been requested.

Current setup:  Puppy Linux setup with the devx pup, manual installs of
dualserver (for DHCP and DNS), tinyproxy and dansguardian.  A firewall
rule to redirect port 80 to 8080 (where dansguardian is listening) to
make it a transparent proxy.  Another to block the port that tinyproxy
is listening on.

Using my laptop as a test client, everything works as advertised until I
point my browser at the Awstats home page (looking for a log display
solution).  The error that I get with Firefox in Windows and most
browsers in linux is "Content Encoding Error" and some verbage about an
incompatible compression scheme.  IE, of course, only gives the usual
"Page cannot be displayed" error.  If I by-pass dansguardian by turning
on the proxy setting in the browser and pointing it at tinyproxy, I can
see the awstat web site.  So, the cause of the error is dansguardian,
however, the error is not generated by dansguardian.  It is generated by
the browser.  The log files do not say anything about any problems, all
is normal according to them.

The only clue I found had to do with zlib encoding, so I rebuilt
dansguardian with the --with-zlib-static switch so that the zlib library
would be statically linked.  No change.  I tried changing all kinds of
configuration options.  No change.  I downloaded the source code for
zlib and installed it.  No change.  I rebuilt dansguardian, again.  No
change.

I feel like I'm missing something, mainly because this does not seem to
have stumped very many people, and dansguardian is not the only cause.
The disheartening part is that the pleas for help went unanswered.

Now I am crying for help, please help with any clues you might have.

Thank you sincerely,

I assume awstats is hosted on a local webserver? Perhaps disabling content
compression support in Apache might do the trick.

Ah my bad, thanks for the clarification.

Maybe try turning off encoding support on your test client assuming Firefox
and see what happens.

http://kb.mozillazine.org/Network.http.accept-encoding#Possible_values_and_their_effects

According to www.netcraft.com sourceforge.net is running a F5 Big-IP:
http://www.f5.com/products/big-ip/ which has its own built in webserver.
I've found some config files floating around for the webserver running on it
and maybe it's sending some weird content compression encoding that doesn't
involve gzip || deflate which seem to be the default accepted values in
Firefox. Maybe they're sending compress instead and it needs to be added.
The Firebug add-on for Firefox will show you the headers being sent by the
server.

Hope that helps,
Drew-

It looks to be sending only gzip compressed data according to

What version of DG are you running? Where did you get it? Package or

Co-worker asked if I had any recommendations for recovering files from

fortunate enough to not need such a service anytime in the last 10-15 years,

FWIW, once I had a failing laptop drive - which didn't boot, and just
beeped at me. Fortunately, I was able to see the partitions (using fdisk
-l) when booting a Live CD. 

I was able to use dd_rescue to recover nearly everything. It took hours.
However, if your co-worker is beyond the reading by Live CD stage,
that's another matter.

Thanks,
Mike

I have used Gillware.com with great success. They don't charge you unless

Don't forget the freezer trick.  Of course, if the data is valuable 
enough that a data recovery company is being considered, then it's 
probably best to not try any home remedies.

Four years ago I used http://www.dtidata.com/ for a laptop drive. They
did a good job for
half of what others were quoting me.  My impression was that
a lot of the seemingly many data recovery services are resellers of
only a few wholesalers that
actually recover the data, or maybe they all were bought up and
consolidated but kept the various names.

Do you *really* mean it doesn't spin up, that is, the spindle doesn't
turn?  

Having just dismantled a pile of floppy drives for parts and played
with the spindle motors a little, that sounds like a problem that
won't affect the data on the platters, which is probably a positive
thing from a data recovery perspective.

On the floppy drives, the electronics for the spindle motor is
completely separate from the data handling electronics.  Its sole
purpose seems to be to get and keep the disk spinning at the right
speed.

One other random thought: In the very old days, I had a disk (a 20MB
"HardCard" in an AT&T PC6300, the latter of which was pretty hawt in
the pre-IBM PC-AT days) with a stiction problem.  To get it to boot up
after sitting for a while, i had to physically drop the case a couple
inches onto the disk for the shockwave to break the adhesion.

They support guy that introduced me to the stiction solution would simply
smack the drive moderately on the side with the heal of his hand, a
technique
I've used successfully man times.

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu 9.04 Software Raid Issues
Message-ID: <6.2.1.2.2.20090429160057.048f2460@landongxi>

I decided to experiment with ubuntu 9.04, having almost always used Red Hat 
or CentOS or Fedora beforehand, and I am having a hell of a time getting 
the software RAID to cooperate.

I installed ubuntu 9.04 amd64 desktop on a Dell Optiplex 740 with the hack 
I found in an ubuntu forum of booting from the cd, installing mdadm, then 
running the installer, so it recognizes RAID as an option during the disk 
partitioning setup. That I had to do this, where it's out-of-the-box with 
any Red Hat or CentOS or Fedora install struck me as bizarre, but whatever.

Anyway, when the grub boot selection is:
         title           Ubuntu 9.04, kernel 2.6.28-11-generic
         root            (hd0,2)
         kernel          /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.28-11-generic root=/dev/md3 ro 
quiet splash
         initrd          /boot/initrd.img-2.6.28-11-generic

it starts to boot, does some schmancy ubuntu splash screen and then states 
that it can't find /dev/md3.

When the grub selection is:
         title           Ubuntu 9.04, kernel 2.6.28-11-generic-sda3
         root            (hd0,2)
         kernel          /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.28-11-generic root=/dev/sda3 ro 
quiet splash
         initrd          /boot/initrd.img-2.6.28-11-generic

it comes up with nothing in /proc/mdstat until I run "mdadm --auto-detect". 
However, it has dutifully mounted /dev/md3 as /. Problem is, it's only 
really using /dev/sda3, but /dev/sdb3 is listed in /proc/mdstat as the only 
disk in the mirror. And since /dev/sda3 is really being used as /, I cannot 
re-add it to /dev/md3.

Ideas?

While I haven't done it myself, I don't think it needs to be that 
difficult.

One would hope that it would be even easier with 9.04.

i have successfully used this method multiple times with ubuntu8.04,
so it is not mere webhearsay that declares it a possibility =)
certainly i have never had to do any trickery.

oh, wait, i always use the server install.  i am not certain the
desktop install supports s/w raid..

The first time, ./configure

The second time, ./configure --enable-static-zlib

The third time, ./configure --with-zlib

Each time it found zlib and did not complain.

Yep. Therein lies the difference. The desktop install does not seem to 
include mdadm on the CD, and thus does not include RAID of any sort as an 
option in the partitioner, unless you go through the jackassery of doing an 
"aptitude install mdadm", after the CD  boot. The idea come from 
<http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=408461>.

Adding all the X foo to a server distro seemed just too messy, which is why 
I did it this way, instead. But really, no RAID on a desktop? Hello ubuntu?

If it is just the drive controller that is bad, a trick that I have employed
a few times is buying an identical drive and swapping the drive
controllers.  It's an easy procedure, usually just requires a small philips
screwdriver.  However, you have to make sure you buy an identical drive
(i.e. same product code), not just the same capacity drive from the same
manufacturer.

if you're going that route, you need to verify that the firmware version is
the same as well.

This is often printed on the label on the drive..... but sometimes it isn't.
Good luck with that!

I have had it work for me once.

That is not all. Assuming you get your software RAID set up to your
liking with mdadm on Ubuntu, when you do a dist-upgrade, watch out. I
used mdadm to set up mirrored partitions when I installed Hardy as the
first, fresh install on a new computer with two identical hard disks.
Everything was fine until I eventually did a dist-upgrade to Intrepid.
For some reason that I cannot understand, the dist-upgrade changed the
Grub menu.lst file on only one of the two disks. And I also fail to
grasp why Grub cannot seem to install itself on mda, as it is installed
individually on the two disks. And it always tries to boot from the one
that does not have the updated menu.lst file. I need to go in and
manually copy the /boot folder from the good one to the bad one in
order to get rid of the Grub Error 15 messages. I haven't bothered
because the computer rarely needs to be rebooted - I just select the
previous kernel to boot to.

Ubuntu does need to get its collective head around mdadm. But, having
said that, I found that several other distros do not come with mdadm
either.

The "right" way to do this with Ubuntu is to use the "alternate" CD to do
the installation, that is a detail that seems to be left out of the HOWTO
above. That way RAID, LVM, and all that fun stuff is easily available and
you still end up with a desktop-style installation. You just don't get a
shiny live environment to play in. My standard practice has become to have 3
Ubuntu ISOs for different situations. the AMD64 alternate and Server discs
for doing actual installations, and the i386 "normal" disk just for a Live
environment. Also, FWIW, I've dist-upgraded several RAID based installations
with no trouble.

a project mid-stream and take it to completion (previous guy was not 
cutting it).

The project is about 60% complete but that is a guess.  Breaking it down 
this is where they are:


Database Tables and fields
90%

Stored Procedures for data
50%

SMS Link       90%

Web page functionality                                                 25%

CSS Framework      75%

If anyone out there is looking for a short term project or knows of 
someone who is, have them contact me directly.

Subject: [PLUG] Older postscript printers
Message-ID: <20090501031839.GA19380@gate.kl-ic.com>

Summary:  If you have postscript 2 printers, use the native
format (PCL for HP) and the Foomatic/hpijs driver.


I have 3 old HP4M laserjet postscript printers, and two of them
are our main working printers.  The HP4M is postscript level 2;
level 3 came out in 1997.  Over time, support for level 2 has
been going away - Acrobat Reader 7 and Firefox 3 don't support
it, for example.  Since the 4M is robust and the chipless
cartridges are cheap and easy to refill, I've had a twist in
my knickers about the lack of support.

Then I had a head-slapper moment.  The HP4 *without* postscript
(PCL) is also supported, and the Foomatic/hpijs driver translates
from whatever to HP PCL just dandy.  The printer is on 10mbps
ethernet, the computers are fast (much faster than the engine
in the HP4), and I don't often print directly to the printer
from remote sites (I can route those jobs through my server). 
So - from now on, I will use PCL and the driver.

I will still use the HP4M postscript level 2 for some of my old
postcript files (I do business cards, envelopes, and letterhead
in hand-written postscript), but from now on I will use the 
foomatic driver.  Sad, really - I'm fond of Postscript 2.
