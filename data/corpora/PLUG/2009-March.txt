Once again I don't have a speaker for the PLUG meeting.

This month's PLUG meeting is March 5, 2009.
Does anyone want to speak?
Or, does anyone know of someone I should contact?

It's a bit late for a reply on this, but I wanted to point out that 
one of the original purposes of a display manager was to allow the 
user to select a host to manage the display.  Think X terminal. 
Someone using an X terminal typically needs to be able to choose a 
host on which to run X client applications.  xdm can display a chooser 
window which lists the hosts that are available.

Here's an example of an xdm chooser window:

So....

I foudna good deal on a Lenovo X61 Tablet on Ebay the other day as a
potential replacement for my wife's machine. Unfortunately, I pulled
the trigger before I remembered that they do not have an internal
optical drive, which makes it a non-starter for her. I got it new in
box, warrantied, the whole thing. It's basically been unboxed, and had
the tablet pen features played with a bit.  1.6 Ghz ULV core2 duo, 2GB
RAM, 120GB HDD. Lenovo sells them direct for about $1200, I'd like to
get $800 out of it so I can break even on it. I'd entertain other
offers though.

I also have an HP 2133 mini-note. It's the high-end Vista Business
model that goes for about $700 new these days, though I have Ubuntu
installed on it. 1.6 G via, 2GB RAM, don't remember the HDD (80GB , I
think? I switched out the one that came with it...) extra 6-cell
battery, and a carrying case. Nice netbook setup. Really sharp screen,
awesome aluminum case, and surprisingly good speakers. I'd like to get
$350 out of this guy, but again, will entertain other offers.

If you are interested, please remember to respond off-list.

What I'm doing may be more of an "advanced" topic, but if people want
to bring Linux laptops, I can show people how to download and use
"blktrace" and "seekwatcher".

Ed,

I haven't used either of these tools, but they look very interesting
now that I'm looking at them.

In some ways this might work a bit better at Advanced Topics, but I
think it could also work for the general meeting; especially if you
did an install and showed some use examples on the projector so people
without laptops could follow along.

So I say go for it.

Let me know if you want to do this and I will announce it.

Otherwise, we will try to have a discussion about social web sites
like facebook, linkedin, twitter, google sites, and maybe specialized
wikis.  Personally, I would prefer
"blktrace" and "seekwatcher".

OK ... I'll get it set up. I've got a little written up on getting
started with them, so I'll post that and people can come prepared.

BTW, blktrace is installed by default in openSUSE 11.1; the boot
process includes something called "preload" that uses "blktrace" to
attempt to shorten boot time. I haven't dug into that use case yet.

That's the only reference I've found other than the documentation that
gets built when you compile from source, and the Howto that I am

After the Thursday March 5 PLUG general meeting, should we head
back to the front room at Roots ( at 1520 SE 7th ) like we did
for afters in February?  I don't think we would be getting the
big room at Roots if we go there, though perhaps someone can ask.

Or should we go to the Lucky Lab (at 915 SE Hawthorne)?  
That is less crowded and noisy than the Roots front room.

Ideas?

in Sproul Plaza near a card table, etc..

If people from all over cannot simultaneously meet, what about starting
to telesync the meetings for future distribution?

LinuxFormat is releasing the current news-stand version of their magazine as
a *free* PDF download.
Not some weird proprietary format, no DRM, no strings.  Just as a thank you
to their community, and also to try to encourage more readers to go digital.
The only catch, is it is available for 24 hours only.

Hi Tim - I'm guessing by "telesync" you mean "record the audio of the
VOIP conference"?

It would require someone to volunteer to do that.  Feel free to
volunteer!  :)

Or, just try joining in the VOIP conference, & learning what it's all
about.  :)

According to that page, "If you want to get hold of the DVD that comes 
with issue 116, click here to grab the ISO via BitTorrent. It's a 
distro-tastic fest of OpenSUSE 11.1, Linux Mint 6, Slackware 12.2 and 
heaps of extra software!"

But when I try to download just the PDF, I still get the torrent -- and 
no PDF.  Am I doing something wrong or did Tux Radar mess up the link?

Oh well, I grabbed the free Linux Starter Pack anyway.  Might have some 
helpful information.

It looks like they're distributing the PDF via bittorrent also. Are you sure
you're not just getting the .torrent for the PDF? The DVD ISO is a different
.torrent.

   I read on another mail list that it has a nice introductory article on LyX
(the GUI front end to LaTeX). Not a review, but positive.

   It shows on the download window as a *.torrent file that is 10K on disk.
How does one get the actual .pdf from this?

How can I arrange to relieve you of it?  I live on the east side of Beaverton, 
close to the Sylvan interchange of Rt. 26.  I am downtown Tuesday and Thursday

You're right, the DVD ISO torrent is a different one -- didn't catch 
that.  The way the information is presented implies (to me, anyway) that 
  one should be able to download the PDF directly -- it says "Download 
high-res PDF (124MB)".  But I guess you can't.  It's only 4:26 pm 
2009-03-04 GMT, so the offer shouldn't have lapsed yet.

Why do you suspect that the big room at Roots will not be made available?  if 
your suspicions are correct, then I vote for the Lab.

For more confusion,

I was at a Dorkbot meeting at the Lucky Lab. on Quimby and NW 19th Monday two 
weeks ago.  They have a large separate room, and the place was not at all 
crowded.  They even have bike racks inside the place.  Perhaps Monday is a slow 
day, but if what I observed then is typical...

Opinions, experiences?

On my Ubuntu 8.04 machine, I followed the link in the e-mail, like the 
rest of you, opening the page in Firefox. On that page, I clicked the 
first download link (for the large version) and saw the torrent. It 
looked like it was going to take awhile, so I went on to other e-mail. 
When I was done, I found that there was a zip file on my desktop 
(Gnome). I extracted that to the desktop. It's a directory named 
linux_format_116. Inside that there's an index.html file and two 
directories, images and pdfs. The index.html file is a table of contents 
that links to the pdfs in the pdfs directory. There are 50 pdf files in 
the directory pdfs.

Now I need some time to read them!

Guess that depends on your definition of "directly" - you can download it
via BitTorrent, which is arguably more or less as "direct" as via HTTP. It's
a big file, and bandwidth is expensive.

Thanks for posting this Matt,
My guess is that the Linux Format people are shrewd.
The Torrents may only be available for 24 hour, but 
 they can persist on the net as long as people have the .torrent and
 there are people that are sharing it back.
Seems a very savvy use of corporate bandwidth.

LinuxFormat is releasing the current news-stand version of their magazine as
a *free* PDF download.
Not some weird proprietary format, no DRM, no strings.  Just as a thank you
to their community, and also to try to encourage more readers to go digital.
The only catch, is it is available for 24 hours only.

LLNW is pretty typically uncrowded and quiet, especially by 9pm on
weeknights.  i used to attend a game night there on wednesdays, and we
were practically the only people in the place.  especially in the
wintertime (summer, it opens up to the outside and is slightly more
busy..)

I got the 124.9 MB zip file and am currently seeding it back. If anyone
wants to get it I have Transmission set to no limit for the upload and
I can send at 400-500 KB/s.

I am also downloading the ISO, but that will take longer. It's 4.0 GB
and after 15 minutes I have only 25 MB. But maybe it will pick up.
Torrents do that.

Thanks Matt, but bit torrent stalled and I've never had good luck
downloading anything through bit torrent. The one time I used it it took one
day to download. I like the idea of it but it doesn't work well most of the
time.

Subject: [PLUG] iGoogle - turning off that annoying left side tab
Message-ID: <20090304181205.GA1068@gate.kl-ic.com>

I like iGoogle, and the ability to put extra little search engines
on my Google home page.  I do NOT like the fact that they have been
pimping it up with extra crud, like the left side tab (with 
default name Home ), and most recently the little "Chat" popup
that causes a screen redraw.

It turns out the old version of iGoogle is still available (for now,
until they change it). 

Instead of:              http://www.google.com/
or:                      http://www.google.com/ig
as a home page, use:     http://www.google.com/ig?gl=all 

The old straight lines come back (they render faster) and the left
side tab goes away.  That also turns off the annoying "chat" popups,
which cause the page to re-render in my case.


BTW, my favorite iGoogle gadget is the Multi Search Gadget
"mysearches" at:

http://www.google.com/ig/directory?gl=all&url=mysearches.googlecode.com%2Fsvn%2Ftrunk%2Fsearch.xml

Enter search text and click one of the icons below it (wikipedia,
imdb, amazon, etc., perhaps 20 icons out of hundreds) and it goes
to that service in a new page or tab.  It is only partially 
customizable.  You must select from the 200 or so sites that the
author programmed in, and can't add your own to the list.  But it
still saves a lot of screen space. 

Perhaps some ambitious person here can rewrite it so it is
customizable.  Or at least tell me how to make a localhost
version of the gadget so I can tweak on it myself.

Ok, time for pedantry.  A torrent is a means to an end, not the end 
itself.  The end, in this case, is a PDF.  In that context, a torrent is 
arguably an "indirect" method of obtaining the PDF.

My definition of "directly" is when a web page indicates "click here to 
download a 124MB file," then one will click to download a 124MB file, 
not a 10k file.  Truth in advertising.

On Linux Torrents, it's clear that you are downloading a torrent, which 
you then use to obtain whatever distro you're after.  You would to there 
only when you *want* a torrent.  On Debian's website, it's clear that 
you can download -- directly from Debian's mirrors -- a 150MB netinstall 
iso that will be a 150MB download, or a 700MB iso that will be a 700MB 
download, or a 4.6GB DVD image that will be a 4.6GB download, or one of 
various torrents you can use to obtain those.  The torrents, obviously, 
will be much smaller downloads.  The end result will be the same after 
you load the torrent in your torrent application, but the method is 
different.

I don't fault them for using BitTorrent -- the more the merrier.  It's 
smart.  I just think they should say, explicitly, what it is you are 
about to download when you click.  Websites have a grammar about them, 
beyond the grammar of the language they're written in.  This instance 
violates that grammar.

And, of course, that's when we grammar Nazi's come out of hiding, 
because someone has to save the world from chaos and anarchy.

Me too. My upload ratio is already 3x just in a couple of hours. And
Transmission tells me that there are 1,675 seeders, so y'all should be
able to get it in a matter of minutes.

I'm also downloading the ISO, but that will take several more hours.

Yep, my ratio is at 4.4, seeding 12 of 18 peers.  My UL speed is in the 
dirt, though.  Possibly some throttling by Comcast, but we all know they 
don't do that sort of thing.

I'll have the iso done in about 10 minutes.  I'll be seeding until I log 
out (fat chance) or reboot, whichever comes first.

You might want to check out samfind:
http://preview.tinyurl.com/adcxdz

It's similar, but you can add custom sites to search.  It doesn't use 
the pretty icons.  It breaks the searches into topics like "search," 
"news," "maps," "videos," "blogs," etc., and has some default sites for 
each topic.  (For "videos": YouTube, Live Video, Break Video, and 
Spike.)  You can add or delete sites to each topic, you can add more 
topics from a predefined list, and create your own topics.  It's pretty 
flexible, and has a "view all" button that will search multiple sites 
simultaneously.  For example, under videos, enter a title or subject to 
search for, click "view all," and it will search all four of those 
sites, or whichever sites you've defined for the "video" topic if you've 
made changes.

It's a lot of clicking for my taste, I'm more inclined to do

ctrl+l > gg searchterm > enter
("gg" being my Firefox smart search keyword for Google)

or

ctrl+l > gi searchterm > enter
("gi" for Google Image).

But sometimes I do want to search several sites at once, and samfind is 
good for that.

I don't have the tabs or the chat thingy on iGoogle, but I think that's 
because I use "Google Apps for Your Domain."  The Google Apps version of 
the customizable homepage is somewhat more minimal than the regular 
iGoogle, more like what you're describing as the old version of iGoogle. 
  You can customize the headers and footers and color scheme, but you 
can't add tabs.

Subject: [PLUG] Why Not VLC?
Message-ID: <312928.83104.qm@web50612.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Sometimes I like to record video clips, complete with sound. I have a Philips-based Webcam and a Creative SB X-Fi on 64-bit Ubuntu. The following does the job:

mencoder tv:// -tv driver=v4l:width=320:height=240:device=/dev/video0:forceaudio:adevice=/dev/dsp -ovc lavc -oac mp3lame -lameopts cbr:br=64:mode=3 -o webcam3.avi

VLC, however, is much nicer to use, and I did in fact use it with different sound hardware in the past. Now, however, when a stream is opened, there is a loud rushing noise, even if a sound device is not selected. If anyone has insight into this problem, I would be interested.

On one of my desktop boxes this evening I observed something
unsettling.  The box had been rebooted because of a freeze (I think
due to an inadvertent ssh session in X, but I wasn't present, so I'm
not certain).  Box came back up in memtest86 (inexperienced hands
probably were responsible), and I rebooted when I returned home.

However, when I rebooted and logged in, I wasn't prompted for a
password:

  login: russell
  $ 

What the ...???

Even more disturbingly, su took me right to a root prompt.  The
/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow appear to be intact.  I immediately
assumed the worst and unplugged it from the network, booted a live-cd
and did some trolling through the filesystems.  I found evidence in
/var/log/auth.log that two or three ssh-knockers had logged in as
root, but within a minute had logged out again.  I disregarded all the
cool forensics stuff I learned at PLUG a month ago.

I ran chkrootkit which came back clean, but ... clearly something is
haywire.  I strace'd a getty and all it exec'd is login and then a
shell.  The md5sum of /bin/login matches what shows in the
/var/lib/dpkg/info/login.md5sums file.  

What explains the weird passwordless logins?

Clues?  Ideas?

it could be pam configurations that allow anyone to login.  or it could be 
a trojaned c library that makes crypt return the salt, which is usually 
just passed the encrypted password.  did you see strace read the shadow 
file?  running ltrace might also give clues.  is there a way to globally 
check checksums for all installed packages?  i'm not a deb user, so i am 
not sure.

How old is this Debian box? Have you run ssh-vulnkey to make sure your

Yeah, I was going to say; there are many places where your binaries or
configurations could be backdoored.  If I were you, I'd get any data of
importance off of that system and plan on rebuilding it, if you hadn't
decided on that already.  Trying to figure out what they did to your box
is fun and all, but don't assume you'll get the system clean without a
reinstall.

If you still plan on investigating the system for curiosity's sake,
here's some thoughts:  your box freezing up could have been due to the
attacker trying to install a kernel-level root kit.  You should try
running rootkit hunter (rkhunter) as well as chkrootkit.  Did the
attacker nuke your root user's .bash_history file?  If not, maybe there
will be some clues in there as to what they did.  If they did nuke it,
perhaps you'll find it partly intact on the filesystem still using tools
like The SleuthKit.  (You'd think something so obvious would be wiped
right away by any attacker, but in reality, most are not terribly smart
and/or don't care if they're discovered since you'll never catch them
anyway.)

good luck,
tim

I have a bit more info, but not a lot in the way of solutions.

I can successfully resume the tablet if I plug it into a dock *before*
waking it up -- it seems that it must be resuming w/out either of the
dock or the wifi inorder to hit the problem case.

The next logical thing seemed to be to rmmod the dock module before
putting the tablet to sleep, but I've been unable to do that, and I
don't know why.

The dock module is called "dock", and it depends on libata, libata
depends on ata_generic, pata_acpi, ata_piix, and ahci.  I can't rmmod
the dock module w/out rmmoding all the others, and for the most part
that goes well.  However, I've been unable to rmmod ahci.

$ sudo rmmod ahci
ERROR: Module ahci is in use
$ lsmod | grep ahci
86: ahci              37132  2
87: libata          177312  1 ahci

How can I find out what is using ahci?  (This is all happening when
the system is *out* of the dock, so I'd assume it's not *really* using
ahci...)  I have a feeling it's hald, but I think I want hald running
;)

I looked for that, and grepping for open() calls, it doesn't open shadow.

debsums comes back clean, but of course I am relying on the md5sums of
the presumably compromised box.  It is just possible that it wasn't
cracked and something else f'd up the pam configuration.  The only
externally exposed port on the box is ssh.

My intention is to wipe and reinstall, but ... I've got other
similarly configured boxes and it would be nice to know what happened
so as to prevent its recurrence.

On the other hand, it's kind of nice not to need any password. ;-)

i don't know if debian based systems are layed out the same as redhat. 
look to see if there is a /etc/pam.d directory.  in there you should see 
config files for all the various services.  most likely there will be some 
kind of line in each one that includes a global system policy.  look 
through things and look a timestamps to see if anything looks odd.

It doesn't get as much attention as my other boxes, but I am pretty
sure I dealt with that last spring (or whenever it was).  It is
possible I missed something.  Running ssh-vulnkey gives me some
"Unknown" which is weird, since the openssh-blacklist package is
installed.

Message-ID: <20090308223241.GA16999@gate.kl-ic.com>

http://portland.techshop.ws

Techshop is getting ready for their grand opening in April.  This is
a "membership machine shop" with woodworking, metalworking, clothworking,
and electronics tools.  They are only partially open now, but they have
room for 30,000 square feet of equipment, and a few dozen metal and wood
machines installed.  Much of that equipment is being used to build the
rest of the facility.

They will have some auto shop capability, but that is still hung up
on insurance issues.  But I bet you could build a titanium/composite
bicycle there now, and there is a big truck parking lot to test it
in.  No good place for static-testing large rocket engines, sigh,
but you could probably build one there.  One of their "early adopters"
built a large robotic race car (4 feet on a side) and found out that
the clearance under a dumpster is less than expected.

Relevant to this list is a planned computer and open source lab,
CAD tools, and the like.  They have some funding for open source
projects.  PSU CS is involved.

This is a hard time to start a business, but this shop will make
it easier for others to start hardware-product businesses.  The
$125/mo or $1200/yr membership fees are expensive, but cheaper
than maintaining a personal shop.

I had this exact same thing occur to me yesterday.   I first noticed it when
su took me directly to root.
Having seen this thread, I went though the backups for the last few days and
noticed that several files in /etc/pam.d had been updated during a normal
debian upgrade. The files were
etc/pam.d/common-account
etc/pam.d/common-auth
etc/pam.d/common-password
etc/pam.d/common-session

I restored these files from the backup and the problem disappeared. As far
as I can tell this was not caused by any malice, but was caused by a
packaging problem.

The code to empty out my linked list of lines is crashing.

I'm having a heck of time finding this bug.  It only happens
the third time I try to read a file.  Using backtrace in gdb
tells me it is happening when I'm dumping the old list prior
to loading fresh lines into it.  I get a sig abort and it is
always crashing on a free command.

I realize without putting my code up that people are going to
have a hard time figuring this one out, though I wonder if
anyone has any idea how this third times the charm thing 
is happening?

Something odd I've noticed, it's my function prototypes in one
of my header files that crash the program when it tries to read
them.  Read my linklist.h header file without the function prototype
lines, the program doesn't crash.

My program is attached for those who are interested in looking.

I don't think that the list allows attachments.

On the core file you can take a look at the stack and backup to
look at each function.

Subject: [PLUG] XMMS Fonts
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0903090917320.956@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I have a problem with the play list display in xmms. I used Options ->
Preferences -> Fonts and saw a huge list of names I've never seen before.
The fontface names I know I have on the system (e.g., Bitstream Charter) are
annotated as being 2-byte fonts that might not display correctly. But, when
I select a fontface without that notice, I see gibberish displayed in the
play list.

   Does anyone have experience with this?

   I used xmms before, but it was removed from Slackware-12.0 and -12.1
(replaced by audacious), then restored in -12.2. When I try to invoke
audacious I get a seg fault.

Suggestions greatly appreciated,

Rich

What?
Aren't the prototypes in the header files used only used by the 
compiler? Maybe you have a name space / scope problem where you are 
trying to use a reserved name - one already in use.

I feel your pain. I have about a dozen music players installed on my
Intrepid laptop, and finding one that displays filenames and tags
correctly is a challenge. 

A lot of them are front ends for xmms, so you might try some of the
alternatives. There are also dozens of plugins for xmms, mostly to
enable it to play different kinds of files. And the latest version is
xmms2. Here is a link with a listing of most of the options and
packages:

http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=xmms

There is also Amarok, which has some fellow travelers as well (e.g.,
Banshee). And there is also the venerable Rhythmbox, which has been the
standard in Ubuntu for some time. And I also have Realplayer, which is
the free but not OS add-on to the FOSS helixplayer.

The problem is not just filenames, it is also the tags. For example, at
the moment I am listening to something from the M?nchner
Rundfunkorchester in Rhythmbox, and the ? is displayed correctly. But
earlier I was listening to something by Lutos?awski and the ? was not
displayed correctly. Strangely, Rhythmbox displayed the ? correctly in
the filename, but not when it was part of an mp3 tag. And if I try the
same file in Amarok it displays some of the tags correctly, but not the
filenames.

I think it is just that the various developers are not completely savvy
on Unicode and have not fully implemented it in every part of the
program. But having said that, your problem may be something else. If
the entire filename is gibberish, including characters found on a red
white and blue keyboard in the land of the free and the home of the
closely watched, then something else is going on. I just have problems
with the foreigners who insist that the Roman alphabet isn't good
enough for their language. :)

I haven't used xmms in years, but IIRC it is a GTK1 app, correct?  Do 
you use other GTK1 apps and have no problems with fonts?  From what I 
remember, in dealing with this issue a long time ago when I was still 
trying to use one or two GTK1 apps, there is some special configuration 
magic you need to do to make these apps aware of xft or fontconfig 
fonts.  (I'm not sure if that's the correct terminology -- what I mean 
is the fonts that GTK-2 apps use by default, the kind that get 
registered automagically by running fc-cache, or by various distros' 
installation routines, or by GNOME drag-n-drop, and made available to 
all GTK-2/QT3/QT4 apps.)

I don't remember what you have to do or how to do it anymore, but you 
can probably find out from Google if you search for "GTK1 fonts" or 
something more targeted to Slackware.

Personally, if you're wedded to the WinAmp-style audio player, I would 
spend more time figuring out what's wrong with Audacious, because it's 
much nicer than xmms.  Unless, I guess, you're already wanting to use 
other GTK1 apps and need to get it sorted system-wide.  I was under the 
impression that most of them that haven't gone by the wayside probably 
will eventually.

   I don't think so. In earlier versions of Slackware, such as -11.0, it
worked just fine with GTK2.

   I don't know that I have any GTK1 apps.

   When I look at the audacious site I see that it's based on xmms. Appears
to me that they're all related somehow.

   Frankly, I could not care less what I used. The two that are installed
here don't work: one no longer properly displays the play list and the other
segfaults when I try to invoke it. Feh!

Sounds like a bad pointer.  This could be happening because you're calling
free on a previously free'd pointer.  Try setting your pointers to NULL on
creation and after you free them.  Then if you see yourself working with a
NULL pointer, more likely the C run-time will catch it, then you know you're
working with bad pointers.

You could/should also try enabling the run-time extended debugging for the C
run-time via the environment variable *MALLOC_CHECK_*:
http://linux.die.net/man/3/malloc

This IBM article has lots of cool little programs you can use:
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-debug/

Ultimately, I think your best bet for seeing the problem is valgrind:

C is not a safe programming language.  Once you do something that is bad, or
"undefined", you cannot expect to know about it at all.  Consider yourself
lucky that it shows up consistently on the 3rd try.  Likely whatever you're
doing wrong is wrong on each attempt but due to the nature of the C language
and the kernel it doesn't manifest until you hammer on it.

As an experiment you could remove all calls to free and see if the bad
behavior goes away.  If it does, then it is very likely to be a resource
cleanup issue.

Good luck,

Thanks Joe.  I'll go that route then.

I am surprised I found no binary (or src) package for it.

Worked?  As in, it ran?  Or it looked fine?  Font handling has changed a 
lot in Linux over the years, much for the better IMO.  The type of 
font-handling infrastructure that GTK1 apps use has probably been 
modified.  As I understand it, anyway, this is why the GTK1 apps still 
around look crappy without some kind of fiddling.  I'm pretty sure xmms 
is a GTK1 app, but the xmms website seems to be mostly gone.

There's no reason why GTK1 apps wouldn't run even though most of your 
apps are GTK2 or QT3 or 4.  GTK1 and GTK2 aren't mutually exclusive. 
The former, though, aren't equipped to make use of the same resources 
that the latter are.

Exactly.  There's a reason for that.

Yes, that's why I said "WinAmp-style."  Xmms was based on WinAmp, Beep 
Media Player was a GTK2 fork of xmms, and Audacious is a fork of Beep 
Media Player, which is no longer developed (not the classic version, 
anyway).

Linux doesn't lack for audio players.  If you just want something 
simple, there are good cli players like cplay, Cmus, or MOC (Music on 
Console).  I used cplay for a while and really liked it.  Now I use 
quodlibet because the excellent tagger saves me time and typing (I use 
the plugin that auto-tags files from the Musicbrainz.org database) and I 
like the interface.  But it's more of a music player/manager combo, so 
it may be more than you want.  Unlike Rhythmbox, it doesn't require vast 
chunks of GNOME; and unlike Banshee, it doesn't require mono.  However, 
it does require Gstreamer, which you also may not want.  JJJ already 
mentioned some other players, and you could always use mplayer along 
with something like FAPG (Fast Audio Playlist Generator).  (That's 
presuming you already have mplayer installed.)

   I could read the artists and titles in the file list and in the main UI.
They also played.

   Thanks, Michael. As time permits I'll look at something else. Yes, mplayer
is installed and it's the default in firefox.

packaging problem or compromised package?
Coming from the package does not rule out malice. 

Your post had me immediately bounce around to all my machines and verify that I'd be prompted for a password for su.

You might try grepping /var/lib/dpkg/info for pam-auth-update, maybe?

That does turn up the culprit. It was a post install script for the
package libpam-runtime
libpam-runtime.postinst
that installed the new configuration files as part of pam-auth-update.

In the mean time I have completely reinstalled because my system was
running without passwords for about a day.

I think there's a correlation between `stat -c %D .` and the major/minor 
numbers in /proc/partitions.

It might be worth pointing out that this is true of any programming
language.  It's just a *lot* harder to mess up memory in something
like Java / c#, but there's really no limit on the weirdness that can
ensue when it does happen.

that won't work for nfs, smb, fuse, etc.  only for local physical disks. 
however, that may be good enough for the original poster.

I am looking for a brief tour or even unclassified documentation that
would show me how these grids and/or clusters are installed, configured
and managed, including how HPC applications are deployed into these type
of environments.  All of this mostly to learn as many possible technical
details about this technology.  I am interested in learning about this
for personal enrichment.

Thanks

there are myriad ways to do all of these things--it's a science and an
art, like writing perl =)

many clusters i've been involved with have grown organically from
other roles (desktops, old servers, etc) which informed the route they
took from their prior life to their current.  so for instance, the
last large-scale cluster (~500 nodes) i worked on used a queueing
system that ran on every machine in the place and soaked up idle
cycles, and supported process migration so that your desktop was part
of the cluster while you were at lunch, and apps were "deployed" by
running them from your home directory on any machine.  longer-running
jobs eventually ended up on the dedicated cluster machines as they
tried to allocate more resources than desktops were configured to
share.

in a previous life, we had a system setup wherein nobody could log in
to any of the dedicated cluster nodes, and everything had to be run
via MPI from a bastion host, and we had a homebrew app to inform you
of which machines you should set MPI up to run on based on load of
each cluster machine.  low-tech but functional and free in the days
when you needed a lot of free time to babysit or learn most queueing
systems available.

these days, queueing systems have improved and i help manage a cluster
using SGE to handle queueing that works without hassle.

if you want to drink from the firehose, the beowulf mailing list
(http://www.beowulf.org/pipermail/beowulf/) is where i learned a lot
about what i was doing when i built the first cluster on my campus in
1998.  it can also be really informative to set up your own
minicluster and run the example pvm and mpi programs (for a feel for
parallel computing frameworks) as well as some of the niftier
user-accessible projects out there like distcc (a distributed
compiler)

True, though there is /proc/fs/nfsfs/volumes, and probably something 
identifying the other filesystems.  Interestingly, I can see from this 
that two nfs mount points are on the same partition on the server.  But 
at some point, it might be just as easy to find the canonical path of 
the directory and match it with the longest root from /etc/mtab.

I've never had printer problems. Does NW Computer do printers as well?

I don't know about NW Computer Support and printers, but The Printer 
Place on SE Powell, near 17th, does. And from personal experience, I 
know that they will turn away repair work when it's cheaper to buy a new 
printer.

   I'll second this recommendation. They did an excellent job when I had a
problem with my LaserJet 5 (a paper jam that was a tiny piece of paper stuck
in the internal paper path).

I'm putting together a linux compute/shell server for my office (of
windows users -- one step at a time :).

We've need a box like this for a while, and the key features are:

   * Lots of ram  (we often load multi-gb data sets--4-8gb is minimum)
   * 64-bit arch, so a jvm can actually address the ram (32-bit jvms
are essentially unable to use more than 3gb)
   * Large & fast disks (I'm looking at 2 2TB WD. 7.2k rpm sata drives.)
   * more than one core / cpu.

I think I have a pretty good idea of what we want (list is below) but
I really don't have a clue re: motherboards (and, by extension,
everything else I've selected may need to change.)

The big questions are:

(ddr800 vs. ddr1066), faster ram seems the way to go, but, I may
simply not know how to configure a system to use 16gb of ddr1066+ ram.

It has come to my attention that Glen Ropella, whoever that is,
is running a bot server that is spamming plug-talk with contorted
versions of anything and everything I post on there.  Could someone
please pressure him to stop?  Is there an effective way I can fight 
back since my servers are Linux based?  Plug-talk seems to be for
anarchists, atheists, and radical liberals only.  It is supposed 
to be for idle chatter and heated discussion that ISN"T specific 
to Linux.  There are some people on plug-talk who have been 
attacking me and trying to label me and now this MegaHal crap.
I didn't start all the threads I am getting attacked on, other
people are to blame for that.  Bullying is a major problem on 
plug-talk, I will have to go somewhere else I suppose, never 
mind that I live near Portland and go to college at Portland 
State.

If Obama's shoes is an acceptable topic for plug-talk, why aren't
my own political views acceptable?  What gives the community that
is on plug-talk the right to single someone out for abuse?  If
plug-talk is a soapbox for certain people, why not others?  There
are politically correct and obviously politically incorrect things
to say on plug-talk.  Can I go after Glen Ropella for slander?

Okay, I'm biased, but get an ASUS Intel mother board, I'm sure I will 
get flamed by someone, but reliability is a factor, yes?  Spend a little 
extra and get hardware RAID (see below).

Second, get 5 1TB disks and raid them, you will get way better 
performance and it's cheaper.

Faster memory only makes a difference if you are doing some extreme app, 
generally more is better.  So go more cheaper RAM.

My sincere apologies for responding to PLUG-proper, but I feel that
since Mr. Robinson has brought the discussion here, *this* list needs
at least an inkling of what has been going on on PLUG-TALK.

This will be my only post to this list on this topic.  Any replies I
make to subsequent comments will be done privately.

You have been asked numerous times to stop ridiculing people of
different faiths, sexual orientations, and those with eating
preferences (amongst others, I'm sure.  That's all I remember
off-hand). Never have you given any indication that you will even
consider conceding to these wishes, yet you demand it of us.

You've stated that you want the right to kill the president of the
united states, and his family.

You have also caused many people to leave the mailing list, and your
'discussions' have constituted the bulk of the traffic for the last 2+
months.

You have gone far, far over the line in your discussions on PLUG-TALK,
but the community as a whole has not (apparently) rallied enough to
use technological solutions to remove you from that list.

I am one of the people who left that list to get away from your
bigoted discussions and dismissals, and now you are using the
*on-topic* list to try and gain leverage, and "fight back" or "go
after" someone on the talk list?

If you want advice about libel/slander issues, go to a forum
appropriate for that -- or get a lawyer.  This is *not* the place for
your complaints, particularly given your treatment of others in
PLUG-TALK.

Take a look at the offerings at pogolinux.com  You may find it is 
cheaper, in the long run and your time, to buy a pre-built system and if 
not you can at least see what they feel comfortable offering.

Several years ago I ordered a system but wanted it with the latest 
version of a SCSI RAID host controller (with battery backup - if memory 
serves me right).  Before I could get a quote out of them their 
engineers acquired and tested the card to make sure it would play well 
with the rest of the system.

Rogan Creswick is a diabetic who is angry at God for reasons I 
can't even fathom.  I'd hardly expect him to defend me from a mob
let alone help me in a time of need.  I hope people on here don't 
think plug-talk should be a venue for abuse.  I hope people on 
here don't believe in isolating someone in a public forum and 
attacking them.  There is a bot that is taking stuff I have
posted here and on plug-talk, mixing it up randomly, and
posting it as if it is from me.  I find that highly offensive
and wrong.

Imagine if you can for a second that you use plug for Linux related
questions, but there is this plug-talk list that says open to
potentially flammable discussion.  You say okay, people are expressing
opinions on there about various issues so I'll put my 2 cents worth in.
Problem is, the whole community on plug-talk is against you and all the
liberal free speech should reign supreme talk goes out the window
because you are someone to discriminate against, someone to denigrate.
You make good arguments against various political and religious attacks,
but you are called a straw man and a weakling.  If that isn't bad
enough, someone sets up a bot that inappropriately twists what you have
posted creating spam with your name on it.

Rogan, I don't hate homosexuals if I say no to gay marriage.

Rogan, I don't hate Obama because I disagree with his policies that will
bankrupt the country.

And Rogan, thanks for trying to wreck my appeal for help from the
potentially sane people on plug at a time when I really need it.

No apology is necessary, Rogan is a very troubled man, pray for him.

I don't ridicule people of different sexual orientations by being
against homosexual sex.  I didn't ridicule the Vegan woman, I 
simply said I don't understand in a light of a few facts.  If 
everyone became a vegetarian indefinitely, billions would 
starve to death and there would still be mass butchering of 
livestock to prevent overpopulation.

I have never stated that.  You are taking my words grossly out of
context.  I said I wish I had the right to kill him but I don't
have that right.  Repeat, I don't have that right.  If I was intent
on killing him, I wouldn't be worried about justification and I 
certainly wouldn't announce it on a public mailing list that the
whole entire world can read.  Honestly, I wish he would just quit
before he can sign FOCA and before he drags the country into a 
second depression.

So what Rogan.  Next you'll be saying that I argued against and made a
victim of myself.

I have never gone over the line on plug-talk.  It is a topic free 
list for random chatter.  People who can't handle beliefs and opinions
that don't match their own are wise to leave plug-talk.  Asking me
to be quiet because people are leaving is rude.

Would you rather I get a lawyer and potentially take down the Portland
Linux User's group?  I'm not saying I could, but perhaps a lawyer should
be my first recourse.  Guess what, I don't agree with that logic.  I
have faith in people, a belief that rational individuals can come up
with a reasonable solution to this problem.  For starters, I want
HAL or whatever the bot is called shut down.

I haven't treated anyone badly on plug-talk that hasn't been nasty
to me.  This is most certainly the place for my complaints.  There
shouldn't be a second list that is completely lawless and a standard
that says you can't come out to the larger community and ask for help.

Bigotry Rogan involves hating someone without a valid basis.  I don't
hate anyone.  I have valid objections to certain lifestyles, but those
are objections and objections are not bigotry.  I'm sure everyone can
think of a lifestyle that they object to, and they won't agree that 
they are bigots because of it.  There is more to being a bigot than
simply disagreeing with someone's lifestyle or politics, a lot more.
If differences on politics and religion make you a bigot, then 
everyone is a bigot because in everyone you can find at least 
slight political differences.

For my uses quantity of ram is always more useful than speed. For most
purposes you are comparing hard disk speed to ram speed. You usually
need to go through the data set more than one time. The first time its
expensive in time to read off the disk, you don't want to have to pay
this price more than once by having to swap it. It's really great to
be able to get your whole dataset plus your applications all in ram.

I just finished building a system with that exact motherboard in it
and thought it was the best motherboard I have worked with in a couple
of years.  It is quite well build, and gave me no troubles.  The case
and power supply I used were.,

SeaSonic S12 II SS-330GB 330W ATX12V V2.3 80 PLUS Certified Active PFC
Power Supply
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817151035

Antec Solo Black/Silver Steel ATX Mid Tower Computer Case
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811129018

The power supply may be to low power for your application, but the
case is really nice and quiet.

Why is that relevant? I didn't see him making personal attacks on you having
pointed out solely what was apparently posted on plug-talk. I'm not
defending anyone nor choosing sides. It's simply not my place. I just joined
plug-talk to see what shenanigans are going on.

Can you sue for libel? Sure but I doubt it would hold up in court (mind you
I'm not a lawyer). You are posting things to a public forum which is then
indexed and available to anyone. In this age of the internet unfortunately
for better or worse you can't have a reasonable expectation of privacy
unless you are using secured lists/email etc and it's leaked, that might be
another story. i

Can you stop whomever is doing this? Probably not. Email address/header
spoofing is incredibly trivial. You certainly however, can defend yourself
and state what is not accurate. Resorting to hostile attacks in response to
what is apparently happening doesn't make things look any better in your
favor IMHO. You could also choose to take the high road and simply ignore
it. If someone is trying to get underneath your skin and provoke you and you
respond, which it appears is what is happening then they are accomplishing
their goal. If you don't respond then they have no reason to continue
because whatever their aim is, is then removed from the equation.

It depends. You can get shelves or special brackets to put a machine
designed for a four-post rack into a two-post telco rack. In fact, a
lot of private (ie - not colo) datacenters do this because you can get
better rack density this way.

Unless you care about sub 10% differences in specific benchmarks, or
have some other extreme edge case, all modern RAM is fast enough that
quantity matters more than speed.

All this looks fine, but I'll pose a question to you. Is this server a
stop-gap, or something that you will want to grow with? If it's a stop
gap, what you listed thrown in just whatever case will be fine. When
you outgrow it, retire it and replace it. If you want this to be an
investment into something you can grow, I'd _strongly_ recommend
getting server-class parts in a rack-mountable chassis. In AMD land
that unfortunately means no Phenoms right now, which is a bummer, but
it is what it is. A multi-socket motherboard will support up to 32 or
even 64GB of RAM (as opposed to 16 on the board you linked), you have
room for more cores if you need them. It's a machine you can grow as
your needs change.

I'd also second the comment below that more, smaller disks will give
you better performance / $ than the 2GB flagships. But, if that
doesn't matter, getting by with fewer disks will reduce your power and
cooling requirements. I don't necessarily support the recommendation
for hardware RAID though. In the budget you seem to be talking about,
getting real hardware RAID (don't be fooled by fakeraid cards!) will
be a substantial increase in cost (30% increase, minimum) and is
unlikely to buy you anything you actually need. When running Linux, I
actually favor the software RAID over hardware RAID in all but a
handful of cases. A mid- to high-end database server, for example. The
performance difference in real-world applications is usually only a
couple %, and software arrays are portable and easy to manage.
Hardware arrays aren't usually.

As much as I hate to say it, if you want to get into "real" server
hardware, you might be better off in terms value to look at one of the
tier-1 vendors (Dell, HP, or even tier-2s like Pogo, Advanced
Clustering, or Penguin Computing) than you would be building your own.
The "fit and finish" on those machines is simply better, and that's
typically worth something to whomever is tasked with taking care of
them. But again, if the "creature comforts" that sort of hardware
offers are not important to you, what you linked to above looks fine.
I'd not get a micro ATX case though. It will likely limit the number
of drives you can run, which may prove to be a hassle at some point.
It's also worth while to get a quality powersupply. It's the
foundation that everything else depends on.

   Earlier this morning I apparently lost all SCSI and pseudo-SCSI devices.
There are no longer any /dev/sd*. Yesterday and early this morning I was
able to mount my mp3 player (/dev/sda -> /mnt/meizu) without any problems.
Now I cannot. However, if I use the same USB port, I can mount/umount the
flash drive and can see it being recognized in /var/log/messages.

   Tailing /var/log/messages doesn't reflect plugging/unplugging the mp3
player.

   My questions are: 1) what might have happened, and (more importantly) 2)
what is the most efficient way to get /dev/sda back?

your flash drive should show up as a scsi device as well.  it sounds like 
maybe your mp3 player is having usb issues?

Joe,

   Perhaps. I've unplugged it for a while. When plugged in, the first thing
it does is start charging the internal battery, but that's fully charged
now. I don't know why it's not recognized when plugged it.

   Can you suggest a test?

If it was totally flat when you plugged it in, it might not have been
able to start and present the disk interface to the PC. I've seen what
seems to be that behavior with my Sandisk player that I've flashed to
run rockbox. Anyway, you re-plug it now, does it do anything? It's
also possible your USB stack is goofed up a bit, try reloading
relevant modules or rebooting. If you have access to another computer
try using the player on one of them, that will suggest where the
problem lies.

lsusb is a good start.  dmesg to look for any errors when plugging the mp3 
player in.  as another poster said, maybe a reboot?  even though it isn't 
windows, a reboot can sometimes be an answer :-).

And has a big impact on operating costs.  I've started to see cases 
(namely Antec) include "80+" power supplies, which is nice because the 
electricity savings (even at current salmon prices and neglecting A/C 
cost) can recover the $10/$20 premium within about a year at this 
point -- usually not such an easy choice if you buy a case and replace 
the 60% efficient power supply.

Of course, many situations can find a few hundred dollars in labor and 
downtime savings to justify a quality, efficient PSU.

Unfortunately, I haven't seen any of the pre-built system vendors 
mention the efficiency of their power supplies.  Non-fun when they're 
specially dell-shaped units.

I'll second that when it comes to the usb bus suddenly dissappearing.

The only reason you don't need to reboot Linux to upgrade your web 
browser is that Linux doesn't run the web browser in the kernel :-D

Eric,

   Perhaps. However, the USB flash drive is recognized while the mp3 player
isn't.

   I'll use the player and run down the battery a bit, then see how it
reacts.

Indeed, many (though not all) manufacturers who are 80+ certified are
listed at http://www.80plus.org/ .

Yes, I haven't seen any numbers on those either, it would be
interesting to find some information on the PSU's that the tier-1's
include in their builds. I like to think that they are as efficient as
they are reliable (I have found the PSUs in my Dell and HP servers to
be 100% reliable so far....) but I find it more likely that they are
not. As far as my own builds go, I've long been a fan of PC Power and
Cooling. They were making high-end power supplies before it was cool
to make high-end power supplies, and they have several 80+ models..

The Tech Report is pretty serious about power supply testing. They
built a device they call The Beast for load testing PSUs, and they do
PSU roundups regularly. The most recent one seems to be this:
http://techreport.com/articles.x/16073

Anand Tech seems to have reasonable testing methodology and they do
PSU reviews often as well.

Fry's has occasional sales on various Antec NSKxxxx cases with PS for $40-$50.

Today NewEgg is running a $69.99 deal with free shipping on the NSK4480B.

I haven't run into any problems with the 80+ supplies in Antec cases,
but I've only been using them for a couple years so far.

This might help, if you can cross-reference the P/S model number with
the system:

Just following up with the solution I'm using now.  I learned a few
interesting things in the process, and thought I'd share.

I needed to extract the top N most revised wikipedia pages -- each
page is in a <page> tag, and each <page> contains a number of
<revision> tags.

The first attempt was to use a streaming xml parser to read in each
<page> element, count the revisions, and write it to disk if it made
the cut.  This failed horribly.  Many wikipedia pages have more than
3gb of revisions, java can't address more than 3gb on a 32bit machine,
and I was (foolishly) using java's serialization api to serialize the
content through a gzip stream -- that only nets you about 50%
compression, where as serializing plain text through the same stream
will compress things to 20-25% (or better).

Since the out of memory issue took me by surprise (the entire data set
is only 17gb, 7zipped, and I hadn't counted the articles yet), and it
was a Friday, I decided to scan the whole archive for <page> tags, and
record the byte offsets.  Grep was the perfect tool (--byte-offset),
and worked fast enough to complete over the weekend.

Using the output of grep to calculate and sort the page entries by
size was a minor adventure, but not too troublesome (there are over 11
million pages, by the way, and the largest has 52gb of revision
text(!))

That obviously dictated that I come up with a fixed-memory solution,
so I hacked out another java app that did not use an xml parser at
all, and instead searched for <page> tags, and streamed the page
content through a (100mb buffered) gzip stream to disk, using a uuid
as the file name, and counting the <revision> tags as it went.  The
UUIDs and revision counts are tracked, and once the threshold of
articles is past, that is used to delete the smaller files on disk.

Unfortunately, even gzipped, the articles I'm extracting will still
need over 110gigs of space -- and 188 hours to extract. (thanks to
'pv', the pipe viewer, for providing a progress bar & time estimates!)

I have been able to set up a cromfs that's 7zip-compressed, however,
so that's my next attempt. (Writing to the cromfs instead of through a
gzipped stream.)

Thanks for all the suggestions!

Subject: [PLUG] cron.daily scripts not reporting if they have been run
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0903120611250.7968@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   A couple of days ago I noticed that my mail no longer included log reports
for /var/log/secure and /var/log/maillog. Both calling scriptes are in
/etc/cron.daily and syslog.d is running (with the -m 0 option I added a
couple of days ago). Could that option have stopped the scripts from
running? My assumption is that the scripts are being run each night, but the
summary results are not being mailed to me. Perhaps that assumption is
wrong, and the scripts are just not being run at all.

   /etc/logrotate.conf specifies daily rotation, and that's occurring.

   This happened once before, a number of years ago, and I no longer have a
record of what I did to get the log reports started again. Any and all
suggestions greatly appreciated.

see if you have a /var/log/cron file to see if cron is running the jobs. 
then check your maillog to see if you see signs of messages being sent 
around the time you expect.

   Huh! Looked at the directory but didn't see cron*. Those logs are rotated,
but empty. I'll try restarting syslog.d.

Yes, I point this out because *most* of the time, it works,
but I got burned once on an automated tool I wrote because I didn't
realize it wraps occasionally.

And this was BSD, so it might not apply to the GNU versions.

The "-P" flag fixes that by using the POSIX output format, at least
with GNU coreutils.

there is also the -P option (for portability) that keeps data on 1 line. 
it is in the gnu version, but i don't know about other flavors.

   Er, OK. Mea culpa! Yes, it is:

you might want to strace cron to see what it is doing.  and check to see 
how cron.* is handled in syslog.conf just to make sure that /var/log/cron 
is the right place to look.

Remember, Roots is unavailable next Wednesday, 3/18.  No response from
Sarah at roots
about rescheduling.  She had offered the following Wednesday, and I
countered with a
request for Tue 3/17 or Thu 3/19.  I'll squeak the wheel.

   Many of the files it says it cannot find exist, but in different
directories. As far as I know, nothing's changed since log reporting
stopped.

i meant to strace the running crond.  strace -p PID does that.  that way 
you can see if it is trying to do things.

oh!  did things stop working around daylight savings?  that used to be a 
problem with some cron systems.

All three of those dates are good for me (that is, I /can/ bring
the projector).  I imagine the actual choice of date is dependent
on the speaker Alan chooses.  I hope to have a presentation ready
for Alan on April 15, a practice run for the talk I am giving at
Linuxfest.

   Ah, so. Nothing going on now, and won't until tonight.

   Root's crontab runs because the backups are done each night.

   Possibly. Hasn't been an issue before, but this is a new distribution
since the last time change. I'll enquire if others have experienced the same
problem.

   The mp3 player apparently needed a hard reset. I did this when it hung
while I tried shutting it off, and that fixed the problem.

Thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] spamd, imap, procmail
Message-ID: <49B961EC.7020209@tempusdictum.com>


So, I intended to set up a procmail pipe to process some (not all)
e-mails I receive automatically.  But two things (may) complicate the
issue: 1) I use imap and the folder it uses is /var/mail/gepr, whereas
all the procmail examples show it going to something like
$HOME/Mail/mbox and 2) I'm using a system-wide spamd.

Can I just set DEFAULT=/var/mail/gepr without reconfiguring IMAP?  And
will the standard debian configuration of spamd interfere at all with
proper procmail operation?

If it's relevant, I'm using dovecot and exim4 on debian etch.

Thanks.

It's been several years since I needed to think about a setup like this so I
could be wrong or misremembering...

Okay, now that the disclaimer is out the way.  Isn't IMAP just a protocol
for communicating with the mail server?  So under that assumption, it seems
like you can put stuff in your mail spool however you want.  That is, I
think your DEFAULT would work just fine with IMAP.  I can't comment on the
interaction with spamd.

Could you test it on a different account that uses the same setup?

If you find that exim4 is confusing or the manual leaves you with too many
questions, I recommend giving postfix a try.  I was quite reluctant to
switch but I've never looked back.

HTH,

Yes, imap is just a mechanism for syncing e-mail from a central server
to multiple clients.  OK.  I'll create a dummy account and try it out.
Thanks.

I'm pretty comfortable with exim4 by now.  It would take more than the
current issues to overcome my static friction. [grin]

The package was libpam-runtime  the top of  whose changelog
/usr/share/doc/libpam-runtime/changelog.Debian.gz
says
pam (1.0.1-7) unstable; urgency=low

I updated the package on 3/3/2009. I don't remember answering any
questions about keeping the current config files, or using the package
config files, but it's possible I answered such a question the wrong
way. Either way, it would have been nice of it to leave my login
system working correctly.

Not certain what people want to do. Try for fourth Wednesday? Heavy

To our kind benefactor - could you email Alan Olsen, and Tony Rick,

If they aren't, I'd be happy to burn some! There are four possibilities:

1. DVD with optional non-OSS add-on CD
2. KDE 4 LiveCD
3. Gnome LiveCD
4. Network install

and they come in 32-bit (i586 for DVD, i686 for LiveCD), 64-bit x86_64
and PowerPC.

They are all conveniently located on the OSU OSL repository at

http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/opensuse/distribution/11.1/iso/

I usually do my openSUSE installs from the Gnome LiveCD, so I probably
have two or three of the i686 and x86_64 versions of that lying around
already. But if there's a need, I can download the others and burn
them. I've been getting about 10 MBits per second download speeds.

OK ... I'll burn all the LiveCDs for 32-bit and 64-bit x86. Anyone
else interested in the PPC ones?

I think I'll hold off on the DVDs ... I haven't got blank media I
trust, and they take longer to install. :)

P.S.: This is KDE 4.1 -- if you're used to KDE 3.x, there's a learning curve.

I am going to pop down for the Linux Clinic tomorrow for my first time. 
I have tons of Debian install CD's Etch and Lenny), Ubuntu (8.10),
PC-BSD (7.2), PCLinuxOS, FreeBSD (7.2) and SUSE (10.3 and 11).  Please
let me know if any of these could be useful.

Subject: [PLUG] Hard Drive Dock
Message-ID: <20090315025638.GA4320@gate.kl-ic.com>

I bought a new toy for $40 at Frys:

http://wiki.dirvish.org/index.cgi?DriveDock

This is a Vantec NST-D100U external dock for a bare 3.5 inch (or
allegedly a 2.5 inch) SATA drive, which plugs into a slot on the
top.  It has its own power supply, and connects via ESATA or USB2
to the host computer.  I tried it out with a 1.5TB (1500GB!!)
Seagate (which were $125 at Frys), connected (with the supplied
cable) to an ESATA socket on the back of my desktop.  Since it is
a straight ESATA connection, there are no Linux compatability
issues.  I don't know if the USB2 connection works.

It has a power button on the front, permitting hot swapping. 
I will use it for backup hard drives for dirvish.   I rotate
drives in succession into a fire resistant safe, and this will
be facilitate that as long as I don't drop the drives.  Fry's
also had "protector sleeves" for bare hard drives, which pad
the sides and corners of the drive, but these do not fit into
the top slot on the Vantec.

I'm not sure about long term reliability - it is cheaply made,
and the plating may wear off the SATA connector.  There were some
complaints on the Newegg customer reviews, though most reviews
were positive.   My drive formatted and stored at least a few
gigabytes OK, so time will tell.

I have a 160 GB USB drive that I am no longer using, so last summer I
dedicated it to holding distros for the Clinic. It currently has the
following, all in 64- and 32-bit versions (where both exist):

Fedora 8 DVD and Live CD
Fedora 9 and 10 DVD and Live CD, also KDE andd PPC
Gentoo 2007
OpenSuse 11.0 and 11.1
Ultumix 0015UE
Damn Small Linux 3.4.6
*buntu all versions and formats from 7.10 to date
Linux Format Magazine PDF
Linux Format Magazine ISO (various distros)
Linux Mint 5-r1
PC Linux 2007
Puppy 3.01 Seamonkey
Slackware 12.1
Slax 5.1.8.1 (love it as a rescue CD)
Syllable 0.6.4
Ultumix 2008 Pre_v0.0.1.1

I frequently fail to get the latest versions of things because I have
to do it manually and nobody tells me when there is a new version that
I ought to have. If there is something that needs adding or updating,
please let me know. There is still about 30 GB free on the drive. And I
can weed out some of the older ones when it gets full.

What we could really use at the Clinic is a big spindle of blank CDs.
We use up several at each Clinic making CDs of distros for people. Last
time we ran out and were scrounging in everyone's backpacks to come up
with some.

Subject: [PLUG] Server Sky
Message-ID: <20090315034401.GC4320@gate.kl-ic.com>

I got an idea about a month ago that can change the world.  I
am starting to build a community around it.  It is far enough
along to involve local volunteers.  If things work out, this
could provide thousands of jobs in the Portland area, bring
internet service to the world, save gigawatts of power
generation, and eventually replace most of the electric
power generation on earth.  A major game changer.

The idea is an enormous array of orbiting satellites that are
little more than a naked solar cell with processor chips,
memory chips, and radio chips hung around the edge.  These
"server-sats" will be about 40 cm across, thinner than a
sheet of paper, and weigh perhaps 30 grams (2 grams is
possible).  They can be launched in stacks of 33,000 ,
perhaps 4 stacks to a launch, and deployed in arrays.  They
turn solar power into computation and communication to the
ground.  Transmitting as a phased array, they can communicate
with multiple small regions on the ground, more like cell
phones than sat-phones.

As outlandish as it sounds, it appears that the system can be
built and launched for less than $500 US per server-sat, and
pay for itself relative to ground based server farms through
electricity and backhaul savings alone - each one saves about
100W of ground based power, and lots of infrastructure.  Local
businesses such as SolarWorld, Intel, Triquint, Maxim, Sharp,
Merix, D.W. Fritz, and others could build just about everything
but the rocket and the satellite container it is deployed from
(Boeing?). 

See http://www.server-sky.com .  It's a wiki, and I'm looking
for positive contributions.  Mostly I am looking for folks to 
help with the software, simulations, animations, game design,
etc.  If you can handle algebra-level math, and have good
"spatial" imagination, you can probably help.  Heck, if you
can understand server sky well enough to answer questions,
you could be a big help.  I can even use linguists to help
name things - good names will make it easier to explain and
help sell the idea to investors.

Longer term, server sky can beam power to the ground, not just
petabits/second of data.  It and be launched by, and provide
power for, systems far more thrifty and environmentally benign
than rockets (see, for example, http://www.launchloop.com).

The idea is still in its infancy, but it is showing signs of
surviving to adulthood.  Since I don't expect to "own" it,  I
want to crowd-source the conceptual design,  and in a few months
build the core team that does the real design out of the best
volunteers.  There are still a lot of problems to solve, but most
of the things that I thought would be difficult (space radiation
resistance, space junk avoidance, and phased array grating lobes,
for example) have easy solutions.  With enough people helping, I
hope to have enough public domain solutions for all the obvious
problems that the idea won't be held hostage by patent trolls.

I plan to give a presentation on this to Linuxfest in late
April, but I hope to have an alpha version of the presentation
ready in a week or two, perhaps for a PLUG meeting, perhaps
at a special event.  But besides sharing this with a few
dozen friends, this is the first public announcement, because
the Portland open source community has the right talents and
values to bring this to fruition.

I am very busy, mostly getting more stuff ready for the wiki. 
If you have questions, please read what is on the wiki first. 
If you see a question on the site or on this mailing list that
you can come up with an answer for, please answer it for me,
and add it to the wiki.  Together we can change the world with
this.  Perhaps even the universe.

Wow! I'm not quite sure what to think about this, but, since we don't
have a topic for Advanced Topics this month, perhaps we could discuss
this over beers / coffees at a local pub. Meanwhile, am I correct in
my belief that tomorrow is Clinic Day from 13:00 -- 17:00 at FreeGeek
much closer to sea level?

There was a 2008.0 Gentoo release -- should I burn copies of it? I
couldn't get it to boot on one of my machines, and the failure to
produce 2008.1 was one reason I switched from Gentoo to openSUSE.

I could also burn the current "minimal install" Gentoo media, but you
need a network connection and a lot of patience (or some bash scripts)
to install it. :)

I'll also check out Daniel Robbins' "FunToo" release -- maybe he's got
something easier to use than stock Gentoo.

I've got a decent sized spindle I can bring. They're 52X and seem to
be burning clean, unlike the DVDs I've got.

It would be better if you would put the ISO file on a CD. Then I can
copy it off to the US drive. Using the USB drive I can burn the image
as many times as necessary. Of course, we could also make copies of a
boot CD, but most of us have only one CD drive so it takes forever to
make the copy. Plus CDs get lost in the Clinic stuff - we already have
so many it takes time to find the one you want.

Network installs are fine for when you have good bandwidth. Free Geek
does not have enough.

> SystemRescue CD? CentOS? Debian Lenny?

Actually, my favorite rescue CD is GRML. It boot super fast, mounts all
the partitions it finds, and gives you a root command line. And it has
all the utilities you might need as well, including some that are not
used often. But I carry a Slax CD in my backpack because it has a GUI
and that is frequently easier to use.

I've just been informed that we have more in the Clinic cabinet that I
was unaware of. So we don't need any for the time being.

Ah.  All this time I had been confused about the talk of cloud computing.
This makes a lot more sense ;)

A fascinating idea, course in addition to all of the technical problems 
you have I wonder how you are going to avoid getting it named (either 
officially or unofficially) 'skynet' which *would* be a very appropriate 
name for it except for the bad connotations caused by a certain movie 
franchise.

Sounds like a great idea. I hope it's successful.

Are you aware of the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITAR

It is a bureaucracy that controls, among other things, pretty much 
everything someone from the US might want to send into space. As you 
proceed with this project, you will need someone with deep pockets to 
fund the paperwork side of getting permission to launch. As this project 
sounds like a great place for Google to place server farms, they may be 
the logical deep pockets to tap.

There's a lot of perl experience here.  Anybody worked with unicode
in perl?

I'm trying to output a string of characters as 16-bit unicode.  If they
were all ascii, I'd do this for each one:

print MYFILE pack("n", ord($my_chr));

The analogous line with unicode text is

print MYFILE pack("W", ord($my_chr));

but that gets me utf-8 text: one byte for 7-bit ascii characters and
two for most others.  I want utf-16, not utf-8, each char exactly 16
bits, but modifying the outfile screws everything up, e.g.

open MYFILE, ">:encoding(utf-16)", "$filepath";

BTW, if there's a good place within the perl community to ask questions
like this I'd appreciate a pointer.  Google hasn't helped -- though as
always it's probably that I just don't know how to ask.

Thanks,

--Eric

my quick reading shows that maybe you need UTF-16?  but the other issue 
might be endianness.  so try UTF-16BE or UTF-16LE to see if that gives 
what you want.  or maybe you really mean UCS-2BE/LE?  UTF-16 can actually 
give 4 bytes for certain characters.

Subject: [PLUG] Rumors that Windows 7 will kill Linux...
Message-ID: <1237187803.23352.14.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

Googling around to try and educate myself about this Windows 7 
thing, I'm running into a lot of claims that Windows 7 will kill 
Linux on the Desktop.  Based on what exactly?

I'll admit that Linux has difficulty supporting certain software.  
Maybe GCC isn't the most optimal compiler in the world.  Perhaps 
package dependencies have gotten out of control in some Linux
distributions.  And yes, certain distros like CentOS are especially
limited because they don't support the latest OpenGL release nor is
there an obvious way to upgrade OpenGL because of dependency hell.

Still, I have Rick Rocket and Dirk Dashing and there is a lot that
even CentOS can support if you add Vmware workstation and Crossover
Linux to it.

I'd love to get Secret Maryo Chronicles working on CentOS 5.2, 
but that requires updating OpenGL which I can't figure out how 
to do.

It's not just CentOS that is limited these days.  There are hundreds
of Linux distros in existence and the Eee PC by Asus uses Xandros
which is out of the box using an old version of firefox.

I am glad that companies like http://mygamecompany.com are challenging
the notion that noone produces commercial software for Linux.  Still,
there is a great deal of room for improvement.

I'm not sure I buy the notion that we are all going to give up our Linux
systems for Windows 7.  First off, I doubt that Microsoft will abandon
the annoying and abusive habit of requiring it's customers to activate
their Microsoft software.  A product key isn't enough anymore.  I doubt
that Windows 7 will be free of digital rights management.  I seriously
doubt that it will run on a 32 bit single core computer.  I'll be
surprised if it is significantly faster than Vista.  If ReactOS ever
becomes stable, and it seems to be moving in that direction, I'll be
surprised if people even feel a need anymore to buy Microsoft's latest
version of Windows.

I'm sure Windows 7 won't cost $400 for a single user license.  Oh I'm
sorry, that was sarcastic.

I wonder what other people's thoughts are.

  Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) determine how authentication, 
  authorization, and password changing are handled on the system, as well as 
  allowing configuration of additional actions to take when starting user 
  sessions.

  Some PAM module packages provide profiles that can be used to automatically 
  adjust the behavior of all PAM-using applications on the system.  Please 
  indicate which of these behaviors you wish to enable.

    1. Unix authentication  2. none of the above

  (Enter the items you want to select, separated by spaces.)

  PAM profiles to enable: 

Pressing enter with nothing in "PAM profiles to enable" disables
passwords.  Selecting "1" enables normal Unix passwords.

That does look familiar.  In a normal Debian package hitting enter at
this point would keep the current configuration.  In this case hitting
enter disables passwords.  I wonder why that is the default or even a
choice?

marketing fiasco vista turned out to be (I've heard if you call MS tech 
support they don't even refer to vista by name anymore) they're mostly 
making certain people have positive prejudices rather then any real 
changes. All the changes I have seen so far are things that could be put 
in a service pack for vista rather then in a new OS. Will it 'kill' 
desktop linux? Never, due to it's open source nature linux can't die 
unless *everyone* in the world stops using it. Although many people 
don't care about DRM, giving up civil liberties, and being spied upon 
(they see the computer as just an appliance like the microwave) there 
are many people in the world who *do* care about such things. It's 
possible that people will get smart and realize windows 7 isn't worth 
the money but more people will buy it because (just like vista) thats 
what was on the computer when they took it out of the box.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0903160849090.8652@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Audacious-1.5.1 is part of the Slackware-12.2 distribution. However, when
I try to start it it segfaults. Running 'ldd audacious' fails because ldd
cannot find a ~/.audacious file or directory. The audacious man page notes
that ~/.config/audacious should have config and gtkrc files as well as a
playlist.xspf file. I have neither the config nor gtkrc files, but have a
playlist/ directory and a log file that tells me logging started each time I
tried to invoke the app.

   The web site (http://www.audacious-media-player.org/) is strangely barren.
Nothing on the config file's contents; no reference to a mail list or other
help. One of the most useless application sites I've encountered.

   My Google search for 'audacious config' finds a bunch of hits, but all
refer to the file getting too large, or re-creating it automatically when
the appliation is invoked. I cannot get that far.

   If anyone has suggestions, please pass then on.

I doubt that very much. Why I switched to Linux and won't switch back 

I was a confirmed Windows user. Windows 2000 did everything I wanted in
its day. Much better than NT 4.0. After Win2K got a little behind the
curve for me I moved up to Windows XP Pro. That's when it started.  

I had a 64 bit processor but if I opted for the 64 bit XP, I would be
forced to give up most of the non-Microsoft software I had gotten
accustomed to because it  would not run on XP/64.  I settled for XP/32.
Some drivers would not install properly, forcing me to reinstall, hack,
etc. The Windows OS update model can best be described as painful, time
wasting and prone to mistakes. Windows security has always been
horrible, even with NTFS. Then the ultimate insult. After shelling out
decent money for XP Pro, I had to jump through hoops to clear the
Microsoft anti-piracy regime! Even worse, because of Windows' file
backup model and its gradual Registry degradation, I could not just load
it and forget it. I had to periodically reinstall Win XP. Going through
the same obnoxious Windows update and validation regimes over and over
again. Until I received a notice that due to the fact I had reinstalled
my copy so many times, on-line validation would no longer work and I had
to call and beg some anonymous Microsoft employee to turn on the
software I had paid for!  

In the middle of all this, I tried a copy of Ubuntu/Gutsy Gibbon. For
the first time, Linux actually installed easier than Windows. It even
found my Motorola cable modem and installed the proper driver right off
the bat, something Windows XP would not do without some work, even with
the modem CD. I could take advantage of a 64 bit system. Gutsy installed
a plethora of powerful applications for free. Getting even more,
everything from  video/audio/graphics editing to powerful text editors
to network tools was only a simple GUI away. Compared to XP, updates are
simple quick and competent. And NO jackboot validation torture! I'm on
Intrepid now an eagerly awaiting Jackalope. 

That's not to say Ubuntu is perfect. Solitaire sounds randomly quit in
the middle of a game although the sound driver continues to work
everywhere else, forcing me to close out the game and restart. KDE puts
Win Vista to shame with its GUI and application integration but that
Evolution/keyring requirement has GOT to be changed. Who decided that I
must enter a password to read my mail? KDE also needs a better selection
of screen savers (nitpicking there). KDE's faults are not important
because I usually run Gnome and can select XFCE, IceWin, Blackbox,
Fluxbox and God-knows how many other window managers right from the
login screen. Security is as tight as anyone needs, without any
extra-cost security suite. The biggest hassle I've had is getting Google
Earth to work and even that is easier than getting XP to work with that
cable modem, once you know how.

Oh yeah, did I mention that if I do run into trouble, as I did with
Google Earth, all I need do is paste the error messages into Google and
dozen or more Linux sites pop up with the fix. Think Windows Knowledge
Base squared.       

Windows 7 kill Linux? That I gotta see!

Just ran across this interesting article concerning Windows 7

http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/817/1050817/microsoft-plans-multiple-windows-versions

Although I can agree with all the rest of the Linux addicts out there,
we have to be aware of the majority of computer users out there that are
not Linux savvy, the huddled masses that will blindly snag up anything
with Windows 7 because Windows is what they know.

I believe everyone is aware of the fact that Microsoft is going to be
offering Windows 7 for free on Netbooks but here is why this particular
starter version is being offered for free:

http://www.workswithu.com/2009/02/06/fatal-windows-7-flaw-will-bolster-linux-netbooks/

Microsoft's thought process on this is that when users get upset because
of the application limit on the the free starter version they will give
up and pay the licensing fee to upgrade to an unrestricted version. 
Quite honestly, I believe the majority of people are going to do this,
mostly to avoid the inconvenience of having to return the Netbook while
deliberating on what to purchase instead.  I am trying to play devils
advocate here and if I put myself into the shoes of an average computer
user that has only used Windows their entire life, it almost seems
inconceivable that this user would return the Netbook and say to
themselves "Hey, why don't I try out the Linux version Netbook".  It
would be far easier to just pay the fee and get Windows 7 unlocked on
the Netbook they already own.

What could help to build the Linux case at this critical moment is to
edumacate them on what Linux looks like on a Netbook, what it can do,
how easy it is to use, the cost (or lack of) of the OS, and all the
other good stuff that will curtail the fear factor of the unknowing
customer.

In the past it is possible that Linux has been targeted toward home
users based on its generic properties such as no cost, easy to use,
flexibility, and security and this is all good but now, with Netbooks
out there and a lot of people considering purchasing them, this gives
the Linux community something very tangible as they can now promote
Linux with something specific that consumers are interested in buying.

   Ah, progress! I touched ~/.config/audacious/config, then 'ldd
/usr/bin/audacious'. This tells me I'm missing two libraries:
linux-gate.so.1, and /lib/libsafe.so.2, except the latter exists.

   Well, now when I have the time I can track this down.

Maybe but,


I'm no Linux Guru and I've found Ubuntu Gutsy/Hardy/Intrepid to be as
easy or even easier to work with than Win XP Pro. Granted, it helps to
pretend you have never operated a PC before and NOT make certain Windows
OS assumptions. I've heard that PC newbies can get kneecapped by Linux
but I wonder if maybe the users most at risk of frustration are those of
us who have spent enough time with Windows to think we know what we're
doing. As a non-guru desktop user, I can testify that once you get into
the Linux mindset, it is Windows that begins to look weak, clumsy and
troublesome. Once you get accustomed to Linux power and capabilities,
Windows just seems lame, a crippled OS more appropriate for an
elementary school than adult use. 

On the plus side, the OS is free plentiful and powerful, the apps are
free plentiful and powerful, and while Linux is getting better and
better, Windows is getting worse and worse. For me, the respective up-
and down-curves crossed somewhere around Win XP and Gutsy. From what
I've seen, for many more users that intersection will certainly be
passed at Windows 7 and Karmic Koala

Subject: [PLUG] Introductions, I suppose
Message-ID: <49BE8134.4090204@holbrookmasons.org>

Greetings all,

I'm pretty new to this group, having heard about it through a friend 
with whom I connected on LinkedIn.  I'd like to thank the list owner for 
allowing me to join.  I'm not an expert in Linux by any stretch, but we 
go way back.

My first taste of Linux was in the 90s when a friend of mine introduced 
me to the AT&T 3B1 Unix PC.  Having taught myself BASIC and 6502 
Assembly, I was eager to start learning C, but I didn't have a 
compiler.  I could buy one for Windows (3.1 at the time), but then I 
discovered SLS Linux.

Those were rocky roads then, and Windows was my primary OS until about 
10 years later when I made SuSE my primary.  I have never considered 
putting Windows back on as primary, but when I bought a new PC it came 
with Vista.  I gave that a try for six months.  It tried to do too many 
things and be too much of a nanny.  It was taxing to the PC unless I 
added RAM.  Adding OpenSUSE was easier and less expensive.

I now use Ubuntu Hardy (Intrepid appears to have issues with my 
hardware) and I have XP as a guest in VBox.  I'm not afraid of trying 
other *nixen and sometimes enjoy the challenge, learning how to use 
ndiswrapper and other fun tools.  And it's childishly fun to show my 
daughter (laptop Vista) what I can do with compiz that she can't do with 
Aero.  I've almost got her converted for that alone; she already uses 
OOo, Firefox and T-bird, the rest is fluff.

Thanks for reading,
Larry

Ubuntu: Karmic Koala to make cloud 'dance' 


Feb 23, 2009 6:45:39 AM

Extensive cloud-computing functionality will be built into Karmic Koala,
the next version but one of Ubuntu, Canonical has announced.

Canonical chief Mark Shuttleworth introduced Karmic Koala on Friday, in
a post on the Ubuntu site. That release of the Linux distribution, due
in October, will follow the Jaunty Jackalope version that is expected in
April.

I seriously doubt it, unless someone with a *lot* more resources than
Canonical throws some hard cash at this. I'd be more inclined to
believe that the new leader will be some combination of a Google
Android netbook with VOIP and VMware ESX servers. And if the rumors
are true, VMware will be a division of Cisco. :)

Message-ID: <20090316111437.193dbada.johnxj@comcast.net>

I have Gnome 2.24.1 on my Intrepid laptop. However, I have
disconfigurated some things because they are a pain. For one thing,
network manager sux rox and i replaced it with wicd. For another, in an
attempt to get my bluetooth headphones working with Intrepid I
completely uninstalled pulseaudio (I mean thoroughly). 

So today I discovered a new phonetic font. I downloaded it and tried to
view it with Gnome font viewer (the command is "gnome-font-viewer").
But Gnome font viewer won't run. Neither will Font Installer ("kcmshell
kcmfontinst"). "No such file" is the error message.

Synaptic is not helping. Neither pops up in a search. Ubuntu-desktop
does turn up (not installed, and I think I remember removing it), which
says it includes "utilities." To install ubuntu-desktop it wants to
remove wicd and install pulseaudio, plus a bunch of other things I
don't want to do. As for kcmshell, Synaptic also fails to turn it up. I
don't think I ever used it, but I'm curious where it came from.

And I need some kind of standalone font viewer that is not part of some
megapackage that I don't want. Again, searching in Synaptic is not
turning up anything. All I can find is "specimen" which can only
display fonts after they are installed (no "file open" feature).

Any suggestions?

Some good responses in here, but most of them (including the original
suggestion that 7 will "kill Linux") are missing a crucial point. The
platform is beginning to matter less and less as each of them are
overcoming their shortcomings, and none of them are likely to ever
"kill" any of the others. All three of the big platforms (Windows,
Linux, OSX) are roughly equal when it comes to core functionality.
Each of them will have their group of adherents and the niches that
they fill a little better than one of the others. Now that the MS
hegemony is broken, it's unlikely to be replaced by another, unless
one of the major players really stuffs up somehow. A failure of that
magnitude is not likely. OSS is too fluid and responsive, Apple is too
conservative and has a tremendous stabilizer in the iPod/iPhone, and
MS has deep enough pockets to absorb what would be catastrophic
mis-steps for other organizations and is improving greatly on the
responsiveness front.

Don't forget that this industry is quite young, and as things
"normalize" for personal computing I suspect it will become more and
more like the auto industry. Each platform will end up being more the
same than different, and which one you use will become less and less a
relevant question in and of itself. Just like no one argues about
whether Honda will "kill" Peugot, and no one talks about 4x4's
supplanting sub-compacts, these discussions will seem silly. You use
the one that is clearly the right tool for the job, or lacking a clear
winner, whichever one you happen to like better. This is the norm in
virtually every mature industry, and I believe it will become the norm
in computing as well.

The big exception is MS Office. My intuition is that, broadly 
speaking, MS Office addiction drives Windows sales, at least in the 
business environment. You can get Office:mac, but it's not 100% 
compatible with the Windows version.

There are speciality applications that will always tie certain 
businesses to certain platforms -- but MS Office is the de facto 
standard for production of business documents. As long as that's the 
case, Windows sales will remain relatively level.

As long as internetworking is not 99.5% accessible or reliable, 
locally run applications will have a large influence on OS choice. 
Google Docs and its successors will all face the internetworking 
bottleneck. Unless my bedroom, plane seat, remote conference room, and 
all places in between have reliable, fast internetworking connections, 
I'm going to rely on local applications, not cloud apps.

well, the standard desktop-agnostic no-frills viewer/chooser since i
started using Xwin in the 90's is xfontsel.  but i don't think it
works on non-installed fonts either.  why not install the font in
question?  it's not like font files are a huge pain in the butt--just
one or two files to drop in the right place, xset +fp rehash, and
you're good to go.  removal, just remove and re-xset and you're back
where you started.

Correct again.

However, I wasn't talking about "cloud apps", though those are having
a substantial "normalizing" effect on the platform wars, I think that
their full effect will not be felt until after platform has alady
become a non-issue, due to the same limitations you list. I was
talking about local apps which have effective[1] feature parity with
the incumbent. In the case of MS Office, the obvious competitors are
Open Office and iWork. All of which can exchange documents well
enough[2], making platform less and less technically relevant and more
and more preference / aesthetic relevant. Once the idea that people
have a viable alternative choice becomes more widely realized,
"aesthetic preference" will increasingly become a deciding factor.
There will always be "killer apps" for certain people / organizations
that will drive OS choice, but those apps are becoming fewer and
further between, and their niches are getting to be more and more
specialized. To extend the car metaphor, these will be the people
driving the custom lifted Suzuki Samurais with the roll cages, while
the vast majority of the world gets around in their stock
camry/civic/focus/whatever. The vast majority of consumer choices are
_not_ driven by large technical feature differences, because most
products in most categories are technically approximately equivalent.
They are driven by aesthetic differences and how well the accumulation
of minor technical differences conform to the individual consumer's
preferences. I believe that the people who choose platform X solely
because they must have application Y will become the statistical
outliers, not the norm. It's arguable that we are already there, we're
just suffering through the hangover from the days when there was only
one viable platform choice for "typical" needs.

-QH-

[1] - If you only use 10% of application's features, another
application that delivers only those features is "effectively
equivalent".
[2] - If you need perfect document portability, you need to make sure
both ends are using not only the same platform, but the same version
of the application. Most people are fine 90% conversion accuracy, as
long as the deficient 10% is easily corrected or rarely used.

Paul is on to a very valid point, most places I have worked or consulted
at already have an extensive Microsoft Office suite backplane.  So good
luck to any users that wish to use Linux in a Windows and MS Office
environment but it is possible.  Some users will want to use OpenOffice
and discover that they will need to have a WebDAV connector to integrate
with Sharepoint or they find out that only exchange connections are
allowed for email, forcing the user to rely upon Evolution.  If all else
fails, install VMWare or Win4Lin and use your Windows environment when
you have to.  So there are options and it can be done but the point here
is not whether someone can get away with using a Linux platform at work
but if it will ever be the standard platform and my guess is with so
much money tied up in Microsoft Office integration suites that it is
very unlikely to happen.  The data center could be an entirely different
story however.

If we are talking only about home users then I am way off topic.

"Well enough" is a good metric when the document's recipient only 
needs to read the document, or when changes to it are kept locally.

When full read/write compatiblity is the key, then "well enough" 
starts to approach 100%. Most organizations which which I've been 
affiliated don't want to spend staff time testing compatibility break 
points. The compatibility problem is magnified by differing release 
cycles between MS Office and, say OpenOffice.org.

Even when alternative apps are acceptable, there's the question of IT 
support, both for installation and ongoing maintenance.

Finally, a note about iWork. I use (and like) a Mac at work and at 
home. I'm no anti-Apple bigot. I rule out iWork, however, because it's 
the most platform-tied office bundle in mainstream release. There's no 
iWork for Windows, much less one for Linux. Apple has no native 
remote-display protocol (and VNC isn't multi-user in OS X), so IT 
can't provide Windows or Linux users a mechanism to edit iWork docs. 
At least MS Office is available for OS X, and RDP is a reasonable 
remote-access solution. Regardless of its usability or features, iWork 
is the embodiment of vendor-lock-in and only has a place in a Mac-only 
shop.

Absolutely correct. I doubt very much that we will ever see a
patchwork of supported applications/platforms within a single
organization be a common phenomenon. Even just tacit acceptance of
non-supported applications and platforms is unlikely. The efficiencies
to be gained by standardizing are simply to great.

Regardless, I was not talking about patterns within an individual
organization. I was talking about the scope of the entire IT industry,
wherein each individual purchase-making "entity" is a single
datapoint. Within that context, I think that the question of "which
platform?" as a technical acquisition criteria is in decline, and in
the next 5-10 years will likely be completely irrelevant in the vast
majority of cases. The only reasons it will be a consideration for
purchasers will be aesthetic ones.

Yeah, I am not much of an Apple fan. Apple products are cages. They
are shiny, comfortable, generally well-appointed cages, but they are
still cages. But some people like that, and their needs don't require
freedom.

Good point, though I think your window will be closer to 10 to 15 
years than to 5. Inertia in ultra-large organizations is just too 
great. :-)

At our company, there are only only two or three positions (out of 35) 
that have prescribed platform needs. We offer every other new hire his 
or her choice of Linux, Windows, or Mac OS X. Our shared 
infrastructure is deliberately built around open protocols, leaving 
choice of client application to the individual. Our few 
platform-specific applications are distributed via remote-access 
mechanisms (X11, RDP, or CLI over SSH) to clients with incompatible 
local environments.

There are some inefficiencies with this approach. Shared calendaring, 
for instance, is currently difficult to implement. Also, IT support 
needs to be broader -- which usually translates to "more expensive." 
Complex documents, like spreadsheets with multiple windows and 
dependencies, tend to be tool- and platform-tied.

Still, I think it's the way forward. Users determine their own 
efficiency and comfort level, and they interact with shared digital 
assets via open protocols. Here, anyway, it's not utopia; it's the 
present.

I am currently considering canceling.  A bunch of real life events has

helping.

Anyone have suggestions?

I can talk about how broadband stimulus funds may be helping to

venue and a day (thursday would be better for me, frankly).

   Way back when I was running Red Hat-4.1 I installed
/etc/cron.daily/dailyscript. It seems to have worn out and no longer runs.
Part of that is due to my losing /etc/dailyscript.conf during my upgrade
mess a couple of months ago. Anyway, after a dozen years it's time for
something more modern.

   Dailyscript was written to send an e-mail (to root or a user) summarizing
who logged in, and activities in syslog, named, identd, pam, ftpd, sshd,
kernel, talkd, telnetd, and PAM_pwdb -- if there was any activity to report
in the logs. It also checked /var/log/messages for anything important.

   What are you SysAdmins using nowadays? I'd prefer takeout rather than
trying to write my own.

On the one system setup before I got here, there's a thing called
logwatch running.  seems like it does what you want:

ah, Joe beat me to it.  it's running fine on a debian system too, to
add any meaningful comment to his post.

Joe,

   Well, that was easy enough. Downloaded the source tarball, executed the

Maybe some gurus here can help me. 

I backup the entire system (as root , PWD= /) with the command: 

tar cvpjf /home/myname/Archives/total_backup.tar.bz2 /

When I extract-reinstall the file system I get an ERROR 15 message which
means it cannot find the /boot/grub/* files. Why is this?  


Solutions on line include:


1) Using grub to define the boot/grub/ location. Problem?  You must use
the (hd1,0) notation but the menu.lst file uses UUID notation for Ubuntu
(but still uses hd0,0 notation for the Windows drive- go figure that
one!) How do I translate between UUID --> (hd,0) --> dev/sd* notation?

2) Using Intrepid Install CD to manually install new partitions then
don't actually partition, then install grub. Problem?  How do I
determine the right mount points and sizes for root, swap, etc. to
accurately replicate the existing file system?  It seems to me that if
they don't sync, I lose the whole disk. 

One problem (among many) I had with Windows is that it was incredibly
difficult to back up and restore the entire system (without extra
software like ghost). I had hoped Linux was better. I still believe it
can be and it is my lack of Linux knowledge that is at fault. Any help
would be appreciated. Otherwise I may need to go to the FreeGeek Linux

I know nothing about how the infrastructure works, but I am always
eager to listen to things that might result in getting better bandwidth
at home. Evidently I am going to be stuck with Comcast for a long time. 

And any day is fine with me.

Grub will happily use regular device notation instead of UUID. However,
when I say "regular" I mean /dev/hda1, not hd0,0. Strange, that.

You can also find the UUID with "sudo tune2fs -l /dev/hda1," changing
"hda1" to whatever partition you want the UUID for.

I have been told that the UUID is better because it points at a
specific place on the platter, where /dev/hda1 may move around
depending on what the user does. Fine. And how often have I moved
partitions around and messed up my booting because of it? Never. I
haven't even heard of anyone who has ever done so. I wish they'd just
dump the UUIDs for Grub.*

*I did end up with a messed up pointer in menu.lst, but not because of
anything I did. An update to a new kernel failed to realize that my
file system was on a software RAID, so it put the new files on one disk
only and told menu.lst to look for them on the other disk. I've done my
share of dumbass moves, but that one wasn't my doing.

If I haven't already answered this, then this question is above my job

That's what the Clinic is for! Besides, some of us have only enough
knowledge to answer the boring newbie questions. If there were no
boring newbie questions we'd have nothing to do. Or we'd try to help
someone with serious problems and end up seriously messing things up.

   Unfortunately, WW, I'm not one of those gurus. I've been using BRU (which
is an enhanced tar) for a dozen years and have no problems with full
backups.

It is looking like we won't be having an advanced topics meeting
for March.  So to get Alan off the hook for arranging a meeting,
and unless I hear otherwise, I'm going to show up at the *Northwest*
Lucky Lab on Wednesday March the 18th at 7PM and talk about server
sky ( http://www.server-sky.com/ ) with anyone who shows up.  I
posted a short bit about it to the PLUG list a day or two ago.

If somebody wants to call to arrange the back room (for free), we
can use that, otherwise we just take over a table in the corner. 
If somebody wants to post directions, that would be appreciated too.

I don't have anything like a presentation ready, or even answers to
75% of the questions I expect I will get, but I can answer a few,
and perhaps others can research/compute the answers to others. 
I do have some pictures on my laptop, and on the website, and we
can work some things out as we go along.

The idea is very young - push it and it falls right over - so I'm
not looking for "this will never work".  I am not even looking for
"why don't you try MY idea".  I already have a lot of ideas to
try.  I am very much interested in "here's an idea about solving X,
and here is how I plan to research and calculate and design it."

I am also interested in people that can do graphics and physical
simulation.  I think game programmers might be helpful - who knows,
perhaps there are gaming architectures that can handle radio
propagation, orbital mechanics, and hypervelocity collisions,
but even ordinary game physics would be helpful.  Changing the
world is easier if it is fun.

I will be giving a more formal presentation at Linuxfest in late
April, and I hope to present an alpha version of the presentation
in early April, so people that want to see a more polished version
can wait for that.  On the other hand, I am team building now, so
if you want to get in on the ground floor, or are too curious to
wait, I'll see you wednesday night.

Subject: [PLUG] UPS Advice needed
Message-ID: <20090316203931.39b8175a.johnxj@comcast.net>

So now that I have my desktop computer set up as an audio center
playing mp3s and streaming radio stations to the stereo, everything is
cool in JJJ-land. Except that sometimes I come home and no tunes greet
me as I come in the door. And when I look at the computer I realize it
is no longer even running. Worse, my laptop (which sits in a docking
station) has locked up in suspend mode.

Yep, PGE has scorched my ass again. It used to be that I could go for
years without the slightest power glitch, but lately it's been every
couple of months. The outages aren't long - mostly they're just long
enough to kill the desktop and lock up the laptop. (I have worked long
and hard to figure out the laptop problem - it should just
automatically switch to the battery, but instead it goes into suspend,
and I cannot get it back.)

So I have decided it's time to get a UPS. I have an old APC, but it has
sat unused for a number of years. It won't even take a charge. And it's
probably not worth fixing. I'd rather just get a new one. 

I'm thinking of 1500 VA, but I could be convinced to go higher. I'd
rather err on the high side. And years ago I had a great one (before
the APC) that ran everything off the batteries which were continuously
recharged from the mains. Sadly it died and is no longer with me. And I
think that kind is rather expensive and hard to find in stores these
days. I'll probably be OK with the automatic kick-in type.

So in that size range, what is currently a good brand / model? And
those things are too heavy to ship, so who should I buy it from locally?

Most likely it's fine. The batteries only last a year or two at the most 
and they are replaceable.

1500VA for one desktop and a laptop? Is there a reason you need such a 
long runtime?

You want to get a good surge protector in front of the UPS as it will 
have a higher joule rating. As for the UPS, get one that has runtime and 
battery health monitoring and is supported under Linux. Then get your 
computers set up to talk to it. This can be set up to automatically tell 
the computers to shut off (nicely) once the battery level gets down to 
5% or whatever you tell it in the event of a power loss.

And plan on replacing the battery every one to two years.

Yes, in case the power goes out I can shut down the desktop and still
be able to work on the laptop for a very long time.

Good idea, i hadn't thought of that.

I also didn't think about getting the computers to listen to it. More
good advice.

Just as a reminder (I've used similar setups) of mistakes I've made:
Don't forget the peripherals that you "need" to effectively work on  
your laptop, if your main power is out. For example, switches,  
routers, dock station, powered USB hubs, etc...

Oh, and don't even try to use a laser printer off of a UPS. Crazy  
juice suckage.

My general philosophy on ups's is that 95% of power outages are very
short, a few seconds.  In most of the remaining cases, the outages are
long enough that it will run through whatever batteries I (can afford
to) have.  So, I just figure I'll lose in the 5% of the cases anyway.
Extra run time is unlikely to do me much good and so spending extra
money on them is mostly down the rat hole.

FWIW.

what about running rv batteries with an inverter or dc-dc supplies? id
assume the hardest bit would be the switching circuit and charger.

I am running two 1000VA APC units (SmartUPS), they provide plenty of 
power for the four systems attached as well as the network 
infrastructure needed so they can talk to each other.  My monitoring 
software just happens to run on XP (mostly because APC provides it for 
free and it does what I need done and is easy to configure).  That 
software uses ssh to "tell" the other systems that the power has been 
off for five minutes and that they should shut down.  I use cygwin on 
the XP boxes (two of 'em) and, of course, my Debian systems don't need 
anything extra.  This setup has worked well for many years.  Pretty 
cheap insurance for the cost of a set of batteries ($100 at Batteries 
Plus) every couple of years.  Seems to me that your laptop, when 
properly charged, should run for many hours even without the UPS.

Actually I have a 5000 watt gas powered generator. It puts out enough
to run the fridge, freezer, television, computer and lighting. When the
news said we were going to have snow and ice before last Christmas I
filled up a couple five gallon gas cans. From previous experience, they
are enough for nearly two days, and there's another 20 gallons in the
truck parked in the garage.

So I have plenty of backup power capability. The problem is that the
power from the generator is probably not the cleanest. I have run a
television off it with no problem, but the only time I ran a computer
off it was back when I had the UPS that ran everything off its own
battery 100% of the time.

I can do without the desktop, but not my laptop. And even when it was
brand new the battery lasted only about two hours. I know they say some
huge number of hours in their ads, but they get those numbers by
letting it sit and do nothing. In my experience, whatever the ads say,
cut it in half if you actually plan to use the computer.

And then there's the glitch in <some unknown part of Ubuntu> that makes
it go into suspend if it loses line power. Yes, the battery is fully
charged (although down to only about 85% of what it was when new three
years ago), but when it loses line power it goes into suspend and then
switches to the battery. That wouldn't be so bad except for an
additional glitch in <some unknown part of Ubuntu> that makes it refuse
to unsleep itself. If I hit Ctrl-F4 it tries to come back, but I can't
get X to resume and I can't even get to a command line.

Even though I have the generator I don't really want to fire it up
until the power has been out for long enough to make me worry about the
freezer and refrigerator. Therefore, I'd like something that would
produce line voltage to the laptop for, say, 12 hours. And it's a big
Thinkpad and I am really using it with lots of stuff running and lots
of disk activity, bright screen, etc. And, as someone else noted, I
need to keep my router, switch and modem running too.

So I remain unconvinced that I should get a small UPS. 

After reading the several responses I have concluded that the advice
that I really need is what UPS will work with a laptop and a desktop
that run only Ubuntu. Even when I had the old APC running I was using
Windows and I never connected any cables to the computer or installed
software to shut the computer down. So I know nothing about how that
part works. 

Bottom line: What FOSS software do I need to run, and which UPSs are
compatible with it?

   apcupsd and the APC units are top-notch. I bought a Smart-1400
(refurbished) several years ago that has served me very well. Check the
refurbished prices and you'll get a good-as-new unit for a lot less than the
really-is-new unit.

hate to be pedantic, but if the area is without power for an extended
time, does that mean that the internet infrastructure won't be
running?  guess it depends what you have and how they are setup.
dunno about you, but my computer gets a lot less interesting without
an internet connection.  not useless, but i wouldn't be using it
instead of reading by candlelight without a connection, frinstance.

to be frank, i'm not certain that your usage pattern even calls for
graceful-shutdown-software.  if you're planning to be using the thing,
you can watch the battery level.  if you're not around, you still want
it to run for 12 hours?  the software might be an added pain without
substantial added gain.  see below for an example of pain.

we have a honking APC ups here at the office, like, fridge-sized, and
the free software that exists for linux (apcupsd) is pretty flaky.  so
much so that i have it running, but not doing anything except logging.
 because it logs transient connection-to-the-ups failures constantly,
which would normally shut the machine running the software down.  so
instead i monitor *that* software for an outage longer than 5 minutes
and do some automated sshing around shutting things down.  total
kludge, but i gave up on apcupsd after a day or so trying to get it to
work right.  so i can't recommend the APC free software.  maybe others
have had better luck with it.  the commercial "powerchute" stuff
seemed to work better last time i used it.  dunno if it's available
for linux or if it comes free with consumer-level ups's though.

additional information:  i am monitoring it over the network, not via
a direct connection.  i guess anything you'd buy would probably not be
monitored that way.

Interesting.  I have a Back-UPS XS 1300.  I'm using the 
apcupsd(3.14.0-3.el5) that is part of CentOS 5.2, and it 'just works'. 
  All I had to do was connect the USB cable.

yeah, i bet that would work great.  unfortunately, the UPS is in its
own room and the cable conduit between the two is so full of stuff
that the network cable was actually running out the door and down the
hall for awhile.  usb is out of the question--couldn't get the
connector through the hole (had to thread an un-ended cat5 cable
through and put the connectors on both ends after the fact).

Good idea. Refurb is something I hadn't thought of. 

I just spent a few minutes googling on refurbs and didn't find much
price advantage. Where did you get yours? And are there any local
stores that sell refurbs?

   I don't recall. It's been several years since I bought it. IIRC, I bought
the 1400 for the same price as a new 1000. Guess the prices fluctuate.
However, a quick Google search prompted my memory:
http://www.refurbups.com/.

   Good service, and a good price when I bought mine.

Maybe not, if you're using dial-up.  :-)

Note the power meters on the large (size of a refrigerator, or two)
distribution boxes in your neighborhood. Likely whatever powered
equipment inside doesn't have a backup that'll last for more than
brief outage, but I have no actual first hand knowledge.

Network UPS Tools.  I was shocked, shocked I say, to have to RTFHowto
on Ubuntu 8.xLTS when I set up a CyberPower. Worked just fine, even
though it was my first forray into the Linux USB world.

I don't know if apcupsd supports multiple machines per UPS, but that
seems to be a NUT strength.

Neal

p.s. I'll deny suggesting it but you could check out episode 93 at
http://revision3.com/systm/ for using car batteries to extend runtime
on a normal UPS. Patrick seems pretty sharp, Roger fairly good but
take everything technical David says with a huge grain of salt, IMHO.
Makes my inner EE cringe. Maybe it's stage nervousness during filming
or something, but man....

I suppose so if you get to the internet from the power lines. Phone and 
cable TV lines can be unaffected in a power outage.

really?  cable lines don't need power?  there isn't some aggregator

it sounds like some part of hal isn't working.  hald, dbus-daemon, 
dbus-launch, and udevd should all be running.  there might be others i am

I  sent an email to Sarah at roots saying that we were cancelling the regular
March meeting (due to apparent lack of inertia).  I'll ask for a reschedule
for later in the month if the need arises.  I asked her to confirm
that we are still on the calendar for April.  I don't think anything is
scheduled
farther out than that.

For DSL, power is supplied by the phone company. You need to supply 
power to the modem though, which is where the UPS comes in.

For Cable, the nodes that cover an area aren't necessarily affected by 
an outage that affects your own house. If it is, then they usually have 
a battery backup themselves, but there's no guarantee how long that 
would last.

Memtest is a good place to start ... then perhaps move on to testing
the disk; I use badblocks -n (non-destructive read/write test) for
that.

The program is called Digital Clock 1.0.0 and it 
is for Windows 3.1/9x/2000/and XP.  It is supposedly 
freeware.  Here's the rub, the about pops up this 
license that says for use on one computer at a time 
and not over a network.  Is this little tidbit BS 
or do I need another program that does the same 
thing for old versions of Windows?

I synchronize to my Linux based ntp server.

On the subject of time, can I snag checkit 98's
98SE fix for MS-DOS?  How about freedos, does it 
need a clock fix?  Actually, my MS-DOS is kinda
screwed up because I accidentally installed
freedos alongside it and when I went to clean
that up, there were some files I couldn't delete.

Actually, why do you need it?  Windows can sync to internet time servers.
I think the idea is that you won't (shouldn't) be using this program to provide
time services to the rest of your windows network.  Individual
programs syncing to
a Linux NTP server should be fine.

Message-ID: <20090319173548.GB17910@gate.kl-ic.com>

Last night about 8 people showed up to talk about server sky.
Very productive, although I think I talked too much.  We met at
the Lucky Lab at 1945 NW Quimby, and had the meeting room to 
ourselves.  It was a little noisy, but far less noisy than the
meeting room at the SW Lab.

I still prefer Roots as a regular Advanced Topics space, and
I am told that the NW Lab gets pretty crowded in the summer.
However, I think the NW Lab would make a good alternate site
when Roots is busy, and we might consider using it for General
Meeting Afters, as it is much less crowded in the main room on
Thursday nights than the SW Lab.

Message-ID: <ae2db4620903191612h1f19cdebo93196a2a0cd4081d@mail.gmail.com>

hey folks,

one of the last steps remaining for us to become PCI compliant at my
place of employ is to "employ an intrustion detection or prevention
system to monitor all traffic in the data environment".  we have a lot
of software that serves similar function (file-modification monitor,
carefully watched syslog including firewall logs, arpwatch, standard
system reporting on events like service startups and
half-opened-and-never-used-again network connections from
postfix/proftpd), but no specific "intrustion detection system".  upon
looking into it further (ok, i read the wikipedia article and a few
SANS articles), i find there is a plethora of signature-based systems
which seem to not be what i want--we have very limited services
running (ssh/sql connections only) and i'm more interested in a
statistical anomaly type of report.  "well, you got a thousand SQL
connections in a second from this host that usually trickles 'em in at
1/hour" or "hmm, ssh leaving *from* one of the firewalled machines"
type of reports.  i don't expect to see a lot of the stuff that people
use, say, snort for, since there's no incoming traffic at all from the
internet, just ssh connections from the dmz hosts and SQL connections
from the same.  so i don't need to sniff the entire network's traffic
(nor do i want to)--i want something host based that i can run on each
host behind the firewall to report on things happening to that host.

but i haven't found anything that's free, relatively simple, and
statistical-anomaly-type.  i don't actually want intrusion
*prevention* software that would modify firewall setup or otherwise
deny traffic, i just want to get paged when i see a portscan happening
*behind* the firewall.  ideally, such a system watches the network for
awhile and "learns" what's common--"oh, on monday, dude's gonna ssh in
for 10 minutes each machine.  carry on.  but he never seems to ssh in
at 3am.  and WHOA a netbios packet on this network?  red alert!"

does anyone use any software that does that?  would love to buy you
lunch and pick your brains about it!  and hey, if you're so inclined
and your google-fu is better than mine, let me know what i'm missing!
the best candidate i found that-a-way was "SPADE" which is a
deprecated snort plugin.

Well, I just bought a used APC Smart UPS SUA155 on eBay for $186.35:

http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=260379092720

Replacement batteries cost about $100 with shipping. 

I did a bit of local shopping and the only APC 1500VA units I could
find in the stores were the BR series, which aren't half as good as the
SUA series, plus the cheapest price was $200. 

So the next part of the saga will continue in a week or so when it
arrives. Then I get to try to figure out how to get it to work with
Linux. But from what I've read, that should be pretty easy.

Thanks to all for the suggestions and comments.

Just a thought in this direction that you may have already considered.

Host based also allows for being compromised. If a host is reporting  
on itself, how can you be sure it's reports are accurate?

One of the reasons for 'third party, impartial' reporting is just  
that. The host can't be trusted to report on itself accurately. The  
best way to assure accuracy is to have another host that reports on  
the activity of the rest of the hosts.

I've got another mailman instance running for server-sky.  I think.
If interested, sign up at:
   http://lists.server-sky.com/mailman/listinfo/server-sky
and bang on it, see if it works.  If it works, stop banging and
start contributing!

BTW, there was a meeting of about 200 entrepreneurs at "nedspace".
I announced it in front of all those people, and the ones watching
the video stream elsewhere.   I guess I did a good job - I got
applause, and a couple of new helpers.

Well, since no one else has responded, I'll throw my 2bits in on this topic.

Some tools that I can think of that would help you get closer include:

1.  Use both Syslog and Tripwire to a secondary server for data roll-up.

2.  Use Logwatch to forward emails.  I think that will also filter data
out that you could roll-up onto a second server or into Syslog, but I
haven't tried that.

3.  There was an article on TechRepublic about OSSEC
(http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=342).  That tool is available
from http://www.ossec.net.

4.  This is a guess, since I don't really use it, but maybe you could use
TCPDump to filter on suspicous traffic and forward the data to another
server (or at least log it locally).  That might require some scripting to
really get it to do what you want.

For non-free/open source tools, IBM has available ISS (Internet Security
System) available for purchase.  More info is available at: 
http://www.iss.net/

Don't know if that helps, but I hope it's a start.  You'll probably have
to do some custom scripting / log parsing for any of these to get closer
to what you want.  And there's no real AI portion in any of this or
provides the statistical analysis roll-up or rule building that I can see.

Below is a normal looking postfix SMTP connection for incoming mail (mine
has amavisd; you may not see some of these lines).  Notice that the qmgr
line does not appear until after a few smtpd lines.  You say you grepped
/var/log/maillog.  How about cracking that sucker open and seeing what
other log entires are there?  It seems like you'd have to have a "connect
from" entry a few lines before the one you found.

If you have the luxury, the surest way to troubleshoot SMTP issues is with
telnet.  If you can prove that it is possible to send an email in this way
from the client's location, then the problem is with the client's MUA. 
(If your postfix requires TLS, you will have to generate a STARTTLS
string; you can do this with a perl one-liner.)  For instance, I've seen
where the Mac-bundled MUA doesn't deal with TLS worth a crap, at least
when a self-signed cert is involved.  This results in the connection being
dropped (or hanging?) before the point where STARTTLS is normally issued.

Just for fun, type "mailq" just to see if the email is sitting in you
local queue.  This is highly unlikely, but what the heck.

Couldn't hurt to make sure that the IP address of the client isn't in
/etc/hosts.deny.  Perhaps you're running denyhosts, and they tried to hack
you in the past.

Heath,

   Thanks, Heath. This happened once before, but I don't recall the solution:
this message was delivered by postfix to procmail, yet it was not delivered
to me. Darn! Perhaps I can find this thread in the list archives.

Heath,

   This has become "interesting" (in the perjorative sense of the word).

   I found the thread for this same issue in last month's archive. So, I look
toward the end of ~/procmail/log and I see two messages from a maillist. One
was processed by procmail at 10:30:30 this morning, the next message was
processed at 10:56:58 this morning.

   What might have happened to the missing message that was handed by qmgr to
procmail at 10:52:15 this morning?

   In brief: postfix (/var/log/maillog) shows the message passed to procmail
at 10:52, but the procmail log has nothing between 10:30 and 10:56. Sigh.

   The message was sent again, but still did not make it to my inbox. Since
it's not a Postfix issue, I found a procmail mail list and will ask there.

TTFN,

Here's a link to a story about bugs and exploits in Safari, IE, and 
Firefox on Mac and Win. There's no mention of Firefox for Linux, but 
since Mac is a lot of Unix under the hood, I wonder if this can be a 
problem on Linux, too.

Subject: [PLUG] One Console Missing Cursor
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0903210804270.7300@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   A couple of days ago I noticed that when I came to log in each morning
there was no blinking underscore cursor on tty1. No matter, I thought, I can
easily type my username and password followed by 'startx'. This morning I
decided to search Google to see if I could learn why the cursor disappeared.

   Before doing the search, I checked all the other consoles (tty2-7). They
all have working cursors.

   Based on no cursor on only one console, I've no idea how to construct a
search string for Google. I cannot imagine that I wore out the cursor on
tty1 because that's the default here when X isn't running.

   It's a minor issue, but one I'd like to understand and repair if that
doesn't require a large time investment. Suggestions on where to start
looking are appreciated.

Dick,

   That there's no mention at all about linux is very interesting. Also no
mention of Opera. I, too, would like the opinions of linux security experts
on this topic.

Reading that article and especially the content on Google Chrome got me
thinking about a potential new project for OS developers or perhaps a
third party solution that will create and maintain a chroot environment
for users to run their web browser in.  Perhaps make the work of
creating the chroot environment transparent to users so that all they
need to do is either install a .deb package or simply click a button. 
But of course the option to do this manually will always be available
for the adventurous.

One of the undercurrents of the story is how much money can be made from 
the folks at Apple or Microsoft for finding the bugs. That may be why 
Linux is ignored.

I did this a couple months ago. At the time I had no problem opening it
in OOo 3.0. Since then I have upgraded to 3.01 and the file will no
longer open - that is, it opens, but it is blank. I downloaded it a
second time, but got the same results.

I am not concerned at this moment whether there is a bug in 3.01 or
not, because if there is I am sure it has been reported by now. What I
would really like is for some kind soul who has OOo to open that
backets.doc file in OOo, save as .odt format, and send it to me. Please?

Never mind. I figured out the problem. The file contains only a Word
formula. OOo can't grok the formula because OOo's formula syntax is
utterly different.

I could swear Writer displayed the formula last time I opened it. Maybe
the import filter for 3.01 can't do it any more.

I have OO 2.41.  It responds the same way: blank.  The file is not blank, 
however.  It has some stuff in it.  Is it possible that the file has been 
damaged so that OO cannot interpret it?

I need to set up a system for my 88 year old mother-in-law.

I think it's really great that she is interested, but she is VERY
non-technical (has never driven a car).

Is it possible to set up a Linux box with a Very Simplified interface for
web access and email?

I'm going to have it connected to the net via DSL so she doesn't have to
mess with dial-up.

I would like it to be a Linux box so that I can get on it and support her
remotely.

Any suggestions or insights would be greatly appreciated.

Ubuntu or Suse would be a pretty straightforward and easy to use

I'd suggest a tweaked FVWM UI with only the features she'll really
need.  You can add some odd keystroke or something to get to a
terminal so you can do whatever you want (eg: C-S-r to get a "run"
box, or something like that).

Ubuntu et al. may be "simple" in comparison to many things, but
there's ample opportunity for confusion.

FVWM can look plenty nice, and it can grow as she is ready for new
things (you can add applications to a button bar, for instance).

It's probably possible to do the same thing with gnome / kde, but it's
a bit too easy to break things when the configuration/placement is
just a right-click or a mouse drag away.

I forgot to Google first!

Imagemagick, of course, has the tool:

convert x.pdf x.jpg

When my 80-something year old mother's windows box died, my brother
got her a new box and put Suse on it, running (I think) KDE.

Probably any combination of distro and window manager will work,
provided that you go in and configure the interface for her, sticking
the icons for the things she wants where she can get at them easily.

Actually, you might want to do an auto-start thing, so that a browser
and email client will come up automatically.

   convert (part of ImageMagick).

   I used it in the reverse sequence to convert 12 scanned manual pages to 12
pdf pages that I then concatenated with pdftk.

You can make a multi-page pdf directly with convert, but I've had better 
luck with `convert *.png foo.ps ; ps2pdf foo.ps`.

I haven't managed to get my grandpa to understand how to use webmail.
They frequently change user interfaces, and that's a problem.

FWIW, my experience with getting my Mom an iMac:

-- She never installed security updates because she thought Apple would 
charge her, or that they were trying to sell her something.

-- It took some practice, but she got reasonably good at using Apple 
Mail.  I'm not sure if webmail would've been a better alternative for her.

-- She could get to where she wanted to get online, but she wasn't good 
with the intricacies of organizing browser bookmarks or using browser 
history or anything much more complicated than typing in an address or 
clicking on a link.

If you're going to be doing the updating, I would suggest turning off 
whatever update notifications the distro you pick might enable by 
default.  In my limited experience with avowedly non-technical users, 
stuff like that just tends to confuse them or make them suspicious.  I 
think that's why so many Windows users don't install security updates in 
a timely fashion, or at all.

Either GNOME or KDE can be made to appear pretty simplified.  Another 
nice choice, aside from the other suggestions others have offered, might 
be IceWM, which is a straightforward and simple WM.

Epiphany, which is the GNOME browser, has a very simple, clean UI.  It 
might be less intimidating than Firefox for someone who's never used a 
browser.

Debian or Slackware might be really good choices for a distro.  I know 
it sounds a bit counter-intuitive because they are both considered 
somewhat more appropriate for experienced users than for new users, but 
both of those distros are very stable and don't need much maintenance 
beyond security updates.  (Obviously, I mean Debian stable, currently 
Lenny, not testing or unstable.)  Your mother-in-law won't be concerned 
with the latest and greatest, or with new releases every six months. 
Debian, once you get it set up, will just work, won't change, and you 
won't have to deal with a new release for a long, long time (sigh!).  It 
has such an enormous software repository it's doubtful you would ever 
have to install anything from source, especially since her software 
needs will probably be fairly minimal.  Slackware has the advantage 
(IMO) of a simpler BSD-style init that might make remote administration 
easier for you.  I guess it depends upon what you're used to.

If your firewall is capable, you should be able to configure it to work with
the t-mobile device.

Try to run it (1pflogsumm) from the command line.  I'm assuming this is 
some kind of wrapper (shell, bash, etc.) around pflogsumm.pl so you 
should also check that ownership/permissions didn't get changed 
somehow/someway on either or both of them.

Probably if somebody could tell me what ports I needed to redirect, but
have you talked to customer support of a consumer level device?  and
then if anything goes wrong getting support? Run my own servers and
can't just give over my IP address to some random piece of hardware.

I have a friend that made the switch and went with Call Centric

after spending some time with www.sipphone.com.  He is happy with Call Centric.

You're looking at the same situation when rolling your own: no support.

You could hack a known-working device into service, and possibly get support
if you lie to the support reps properly. Or, you could guarantee no support
whatsoever by rolling your own. The other option is to go with a more
expensive service which will likely present the same challenges as the
t-mobile service: access.

That said, if you want cheap, you can get an account with Teliax and build
an Asterisk server to handle the traffic. You'll still have to figure out
what ports to forward through your firewall though.

f2it.com is a local company doing voip.  the ata devices he uses work just 
fine through normal firewalls.  but, any device you use behind a firewall 
will probably need priority queueing magic done on the firewall to give 
the best voip experience.  that is why t-mobile wants to replace your 
firewall so they can make sure that voip traffic gets to the head of the 
line always.

Rod,

   For a reason I cannot immediately determine, it no longer runs from the
command line. /etc/cron.daily/1pflogsumm is a shell script that references
/usr/local/bin/pflogsumm (a perl script without the .pl extension on the
file or referencing shell script).

   I updated the Date::Calc module to eliminate that as a reason for the
sudden failure of the script to run.

   Running '/usr/local/bin/pflogsumm -d yesterday -e /var/log/maillog.2'
works.

   I wonder if the reason is that the log rotation resulted in the numbers
being incorrect so the script's looking for a non-existent log file:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ ll /var/log/maillog*
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  216601 Mar 24 10:03 /var/log/maillog
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1219888 Mar 24 04:40 /var/log/maillog.1
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1029689 Mar 23 04:40 /var/log/maillog.2
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2700694 Mar 22 04:40 /var/log/maillog.3
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1168552 Mar 21 04:40 /var/log/maillog.4

Notice that both maillog and maillog.1 have today's date.

OK.
1. Does 1pflogsumm do the same as your command line below? (copy and 
paste from the file to be sure).
2. Is the execute bit set for 1pflogsumm?

maillog.2 will have mostly stuff from the 22nd.  Logrotate happened at 
4:40AM the 23rd so there will probably be only a few entries for the 23rd.

Also do you have enough memory to run with the -e switch?  The man page 
says that switch can eat RAM like crazy.

I run this command daily at just after midnight on 200+ MByte log files 
but you can see it isn't generating a lot of output.

/usr/sbin/pflogsumm -d yesterday -h 10 -u 10 --no_bounce_detail 
--no_deferral_detail --no_reject_detail --no_smtpd_warnings 
/var/log/maillog

If you're not receiving any mail from cron jobs, you might want to check
the permissions on your mail spool file, such as:

/var/spool/mail/rshepard (or whatever is your own userid on the system).

On my system, they would look like:

-rw-r--r-- 1 rshepard mail 0 2009-03-24 06:17 /var/spool/mail/rshepard .

If something changed the permissions from 644 as above to 640 or 600, it
could block your local mail handler (like postfix) from writing to that.

   Not quite. /etc/cron.daily/1pflogsumm:

   - checks location of /var/log/maillog
   - defines EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/bin/pflogsumm
   - sets up /etc/postfix as a temporary directory
   - defines OPTIONS (the default time is 'today' since it is supposed to run
     at 04:40 so /var/log/maillog is still the current (today's) log file.)
   - describes the e-mail heading
   - locates sendmail
   - locates postfix
   - proceeds with other checks, then runs EXECUTABLE.

   Yup.

   Should. Doesn't. How it got borked I've no idea:

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  223228 Mar 24 10:10 /var/log/maillog
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1219888 Mar 24 04:40 /var/log/maillog.1

   1G. Besides, this script has worked every day for several years. It
stopped running a couple of weeks ago, then started when I also ran it at
00:02 hrs. from root's crontab. Got two reports each day, one just after
midnight, the other at 4:40 am. Now neither is running and I think it's the
screwy log names.

   If logrotate ran this morning at 4:40+, which it did since /var/log/cron
shows the change:

-rw------- 1 root      root         0 Mar 24 04:40 cron
-rw------- 1 root      root         0 Mar 23 04:40 cron.1
-rw------- 1 root      root         0 Mar 22 04:40 cron.2
-rw------- 1 root      root         0 Mar 21 04:40 cron.3
-rw------- 1 root      root         0 Mar 20 04:40 cron.4

   then /var/log/maillog should show the same pattern. It doesn't; somehow
it was moved to maillog.1 and a new maillog started some time after that.

Robert,

   Here it's

-rw-rw---- 1 rshepard mail 72721 Mar 24 06:05 /var/spool/mail/rshepard

and those permissions should not have changed.

Thanks,

  The OLTP project has created the Sugar interface.  It's designed to
be an easy-to-use interface running on top of Linux.  It should have
the basic tools your mother needs with the full power of Linux beneath

Message-ID: <49C95B79.2000403@verizon.net>

All,

I am running Kubuntu Jaunty.

I recently came into a reason to try video conferencing.  I searched 
Google and found several references including the Kubuntu Guide.  In the 
guide are several different programs that might fill the bill.

My question is, which program will more than likely work best on an 
IdeaPad running a 64-bit install.  The webcam is built in.  I know it 
can work with Kubuntu and have actually seen myself upside down in Hardy 
but haven't tried to use it for anything lately.

The use we are looking for includes 4 laptops.  3 run Kubuntu, 1 runs 
Ubuntu.  Just the 4 of us trying to stay connected and looking for a 
better way than sharing speakerphones on each end.

TIA,

Bruce

I currently run Debian, and for grins searched Synaptic for "video 
conference". I found ekiga, ekiga-dbg, and rat. I have no idea if these 
can be made to suit your needs. But the *untu's are based on Debian, so 
it might be a good place to start.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0903241649020.25404@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Last week I asked for ideas on where incoming mail went after postfix
found the incoming connection. I discovered that the messages were passed
from qmgr to /usr/bin/procmail but they never showed up in my inbox.

   I found and signed up for a procmail mail list and posted a query there on
what to do to learn what's happened. There has been no response since then.
Today I discover that more messages are being lost.

   Since there appears to be no procmail support on their mail list, where do
you folks suggest I go to get help with this issue?

well, you could post your procmailrc here and tell us all that you
know about a message that disappears (sender, subject, and anything
else that might be affected by whatever filter rules you have in place
in procmial).  i find it very hard to believe that your procmail log
file hasn't told you what's happening to those messages.  i often lost
messages and always found them via the log, when i used procmail for
12 years.  i've finally given up that ghost and let gmail do all my
sorting these days.

Thanks Mel,

I too saw those in the Kubuntu Guide online.  I am more interested in 
other folks experience with the different programs.  I am sure that each 
has strengths and weaknesses.  Our needs aren't demanding...just didn't 
want to waste time trying each one.

Well, it's not free (as in freedom), but Skype works reasonably well if
you're using Gnome or KDE environments.  If you're using alternative
window managers/environments, then there are some glitches, but it can
still be made to work.  Binary packages are available for a few various
Linux platforms.

Chris,

   Here's ~/.procmailrc:

# set to yes when debugging
VERBOSE=3

# Remove ## when debugging; set to no if you want minimal logging; to all
# for max.
LOGABSTRACT=all

MAILDIR=$HOME/mail

# Directory for storing procmail-related files

INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/recipes.rc

# Catch SPAM

* ^X-Spam-Flag: YES

#EOF

   And here's an example of a message from linkedin.com:

   I've had no problems (of which I'm aware) the past dozen years until last
month. Then a prospective client sent me a message that never arrived, and
the resend never made it to my INBOX, either. Same thing happened late last
week (different domain), and now the messages from linkedin.com are not
arriving, either. Very frustrating.

You can set the bit rate for the connection using the "rate" flag of
iwconfig.

I haven't seen anything about T-Mobile and VoIP other then the consumer
space stuff that they have where they sell you a wireless router and you can
use devices that support UMA like the blackberry which is basically a
bastardized version of VoIP .. I use it at home and it does work really well
though, no need to buy T-Mobile's gear though.

Does anything show up in /var/log/maillog?

Since it's in mbox format you should be able to cat the mailbox and grep for
the message by sender/subject since you know what they are. Maybe it's an
MUA issue and not the MTA which is unlikely but possible.

   Yes. That's how I know that postfix received the message and passed it to
procmail.

   I don't need to do this since the contents of /var/spool/mail/rshepard are
presented in ~/mail/INBOX.

   What exacerbates the situation is a comment from someone on the Slackware
mail list who reported the same (and similar) issues after an upgrade to
12.2. His recommendation was a complete re-installation, but I don't think
that's really practical for a production system with years of data and
non-distribution applications. The latter (and the libraries) are in the
same filesystems and directories as are the distribution's files. Sigh.

Rod,

   I just tried to run /etc/cron.daily/1pflogsumm by copying each line to
another virtual console logged in as root. Each line was excepted until the
long perl statement. The full statement, followed by the result, follows:

perl -e 'use Date::Calc;' 2>/dev/null || {
     sed -e '/# ---Begin:/,/# ---End:/d' < ${EXECUTABLE} >
${TMPDIR}/${TMPEXE}
     chmod u=rx,go= ${TMPDIR}/${TMPEXE} || echo "$0: warning - unable to set
permissions on ${TMPDIR}/${TMPEXE}"
     EXECUTABLE=${TMPDIR}/${TMPEXE}
}

> > sed -e '/# ---Begin:/,/# ---End:/d' < ${EXECUTABLE} >
${TMPDIR}/${TMPEXE}
> > chmod u=rx,go= ${TMPDIR}/${TMPEXE} || echo "$0: warning - unable to set
permissions on ${TMPDIR}/${TMPEXE}"
> EXECUTABLE=${TMPDIR}/${TMPEXE}
> }
-bash: ${EXECUTABLE}: ambiguous redirect
-bash: /: is a directory
-bash: warning - unable to set permissions on /

   This suggests to me that the forward slash used to indicate the
directory/executable file path is seen as the root directory. The line
assigning values to $EXECUTABLE and $TMPDIR string were accepted by bash:

EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/bin/pflogsumm
TMPDIR=/etc/postfix

and was accepted a few lines further in the script:

trap "test -r ${TMPDIR}/${TMPEXE} && rm -f ${TMPDIR}/${TMPEXE}" 0 1 2 3 15

   Does this help to identify what I should do to fix the script so it once
again runs?

Thanks,

Rich

Typically the connection speed is auto-negotiated with the WAP/router
depending on the type of card you have and the current signal conditions.

Why do you ask, are you getting a slower connection than 54MB/s or 105MB/s
or whatever 802.11N is supposed to be?

It might be a problem of low signal strength.  If you are too far away from
the WAP and the signal is weak (or there is a lot of interference), the
wireless device in your system should negotiate a slower speed in order to
ensure a stable connection.  Trying to force a higher speed might not give
you any performance benefits.

If this is the case, you have a weak signal, the best thing to do is boost
the signal.

Some WAP devices will allow you to tweak the settings and notch up the
transmit power (such as if you have a router with DD-WRT or OpenWRT or
similar), however this is not always the best way to do it.  The best way is
to get better antenna(s).  You can get 3rd party bigger antennas for the
router, and depending on the device, antennas for the wifi device in the
computer.  This is easiest if you have a PCI device, the antenna just screws
in the back, you can get an external one with a cord, and set it up as high
as possible.

If you have a laptop with built in wireless your antenna options are more
limited.  A good compromise might be to get a USB wireless device, and build
a parabolic reflector dish for it (and disable the internal wireless
device).  There are plans for such things around the net.

I am a Ham Radio operator, and one of the first lessons to learn about radio
propagation is that boosting your radio transmit power helps up to a certain
point, but getting a better antenna, and one higher up, will always help,
and in many cases can be less expensive than boosting power (such as with an
amplifier).
Also with 802.11a/b/g/n you are limited by the FCC how much transmit power
you can use.
802.11 is radio technology, in fact part of the 802.11 band overlaps one of
the Ham bands.

In Ham Radio one can build a small transmitter into an Altoids tin, throw a
wire antenna across a couple of trees, and work people around the world with
less than 5 watts.  Of course that is the HF bands (3-30mhz), where 802.11
is in the 2.4Ghz band and is line-of-sight.  OK enough Ham speak for now...

Where is TMPDIR and TMPEXE set?  Earlier in the 1pflogsumm script?  If 
they are not set _correctly_, ie. empty then you end up with a '/' 
instead of a /path/to/tmpdir/tmpexe.

Is any part of this setup chroot?

Rod,

   Yes, earlier in the script:

#!/bin/sh
# Default location of the log file, if not learnt from LOGFILE
[ -z "${LOGFILE}" ] && [ -f /var/log/maillog ] && LOGFILE=/var/log/maillog
EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/bin/pflogsumm
TMPDIR=/etc/postfix     # default directory for temporary executable, better than /tmp
TMPEXE=pfls.tmp.$$      # name of executable if Date::Calc module not available

Obviously, /etc/postfix is no empty. And, this is the way it's been set for
years.

Support for 11n (ap mode) in OpenWrt (and linux generally) is a bit
shaky at the moment, I think.  I keep saying this, but ... I expect
things to be better in 6 months.  People are actively working on it,
including many of the radio vendors.

802.11n uses three antennas (typically).  Replacing three antennas
probably isn't practical if you want 11n as the cost of reasonable
quality antennas will exceed the cost of a different device.

how about /etc/nntpserver ?

you could also run slrn under strace (strace -s 64 slrn |less and
search for my_news_server) to see if you find that string anywhere.

It seems you have to have Windows XP or higher to watch any show on
nbc.com.  I suppose this is because NBC is MS NBC.  Does anyone know
a way around this?  I'm using the latest version of flashplayer,
version 10.  It doesn't do any good though.  Under 2000 running in
vmware I get further, but I still can't play any videos.

Moonlight is a mono project to play Silverlight content in Linux.  It
doesn't work at NBC, likely because Silverlight is at v2 with v3 in

NBC's shows (at least the ones I tested just now) are in Flash. I just
played some A-Team on Firefox in Linux.

Wait, what?  You have a problem of mail not arriving where you expect it to arrive.
That implies that all assumptions and "things I know" are suspect.

It would take a few seconds to do the test. 

Do it.

Oh my.  You still use mbox?  In that case, learn about the file
locking flag for procmail recipes and make sure you use it in all the
right places.  (IIRC, you can use it too much and usually not have an
issue, it will just degrade performance.)  If you have a missing lock,
I could see how occasionally you'd lose a message.

Good luck!

I can get short clips to play, but when I go after full episodes on
nbc.com it doesn't work.  If I'm lucky, I get the NBC symbol.  It
flashes a couple of times and that's it.  I can't get this to work 
under a native copy of Windows XP either.

It's an odd thing, this script. I don't have the 1pflogsumm cron
script, but I do have pflogsumm on one of my machines, and it doesn't
have any of this "# ---Begin" or "# ---End" stuff in it. It seems kind
of odd to rely on sed cutting to work around Date::Calc problems, too.

The interesting thing with your error here is that the code that's
producing the error should only be hit if Date::Calc isn't setup
properly. Are you certain that perl module it works? If you type the
following, it should produce no output:

  # perl -e "use Date::Calc"

If that works, but the shell script continues to not work, my
suspicions are that there was a small mistake made when you went
line-by line to test the script.

How about you email me both the 1pflogsumm cron script and the
pflogsumm perl script that's on your system?

Subject: [PLUG] Clear WiMax
Message-ID: <1238066464.7810.0.camel@palerider>

Does anyone have any experience or advice?

Recently Clear WiMax has begun offering its services here in Portland. I
was given a 7 day trial using a desktop Motorola WiMax Ethernet modem. 

My experience with Comcast service for both HiDef cable TV and broadband
has been utterly dismal, with periodic service interruptions, ever
increasing charges,  poor service tech performance, etc. Comcast's
recent addition of a 99 cent monthly service insurance charge (or pay a
large service tech bill if they need to actually DO something) is
particularly galling given their lack of competence. 

I am considering Clear WiMax as a broadband replacement. Although the
listed download rate is lower than Comcast, actual measured throughput
is about 30% higher as Comcast has been degrading in tandem with the
number of customers they've signed up. Clear WiMax is offering a
guaranteed price w/ a 24 month contract that is actually less than
Comcast with NO download limits.

I need to commit by next Tuesday, March 31st. Any advice on what I
should be wary of here?  This looks too good to be true. Should I expect
a throughput degradation akin to Comcast as Clear signs up more
customers? I'm hazy about the tech details of the limits of this kind of
service versus Comcast's copper lines. Clear offers no news feed or home
page  akin to Comcast, both of which are minor details if Clear service
remains superior to Comcast. Are there stand alone news feeds and home
page services out there ? 


Any info would be greatly appreciated 


Thanks

WW

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0903260555001.28035@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I don't know how to interpret this section from logwatch:

  Refused Connections:
     Service in.comsat:
        localhost.localdomain (127.0.0.1): 235 Time(s)

   In ~/.bash_profile biff is set to 'n'. Does the above mean someone
external tried to log in via ssh claiming their computer was
'localhost.localdomain'? Or is this somethinge else and possible related to
the non-appearance of incoming e-mail messages supposedly passed on by
procmail?

Heath,

   No output. I used MCPAN to upgrade Date::Calc just in case that was the
problem.

   What is strange -- to me -- is that the cron.daily script has been used
for years with no issues. I no longer remember where I got it, but it's not
from pflogsumm's web site. That has only the perl script. Yesterday, I
updated the latter from 1.1.0 to 1.1.2. But, the issue is with the shell
script in cron.daily.

   Thank you. Sent off the list.

Michael,

   From ~/.pinerc:

# Path of (local or remote) INBOX, e.g. ={mail.somewhere.edu}inbox
# Normal Unix default is the local INBOX (usually /usr/spool/mail/$USER).
inbox-path=/var/spool/mail/rshepard

   So, I run 'grep linkedin.com /var/spool/mail/rshepard' and I see the one
message from March 5th that I also see in pine. None of the others that
/var/log/maillog* tells me were received and processed by postfix and
procmail.

   I agree it makes no sense. That makes it more frustrating. Why suddenly
now? Why only three domains, and one from which mail had no problems making
it into /var/spool/mail/rshepard?

Thanks,

Rich

Jason,

   That's apparently the default with pine/alpine. It's worked for a dozen
years, and seems appropriate since I use the same box as both the (mail)
server and my workstation. If there's a smooth transition to maildir, I've
no objection to using that instead.

   How might a locking flag suddenly go missing? And why would it affect only
specific sending domains, and consistently do so? Two of those domains had
not before sent me any messages, but each sent two (original and a resend)
and neither made it to my INBOX. The third sends messages every day that
were always seen. That stopped earlier this week.

Everyone:

   A-ha! The log reports problem is all part of the procmail issue!!

   Yesterday, I added this recipe to the bottom of ~/procmail/recipes.rc:

:0:
* ^TO_rshepard at appl-ecosys.com
personal

   This morning, the postfix (1pflogsumm) summary report was in my personal
file ... both from root's crontab (at 00:02am) and from /etc/cron.daily (at
04:40am). Also, the netgear firewall's security report was also there, along
with a message direct from Heath.

   I suspect that if messages from the individuals at gte.net and the other
domains that suddenly went AWOL were resent, they'd appear in my personal
file, too. However, I don't want to ask this of them until I'm certain the
problem has been resolved, and I want to fix this procmail issue for all
incoming messages.

   There is no procmail mail list any more. The hosting domain in Germany is
gone. I have an authentication issue with slrn trying to connect to
news.aracnet.com and I'm waiting for their tech support to reply to my
message on that before finding a mail-related Usenet group.

   This is certainly well above my knowledge of mail systems. Procmail
reports the message delivered to /var/spool/mail/rshepard, but it's not
there. Where'd it go, and why?

   Let's close this thread and focus on the procmail one.

Thanks,

Rich

Supernews might fit the bill for news feeds although there is a fee to
use it. In terms of service degrafation, it's going to end up being a
matter of their oversubscription rates on the tower. Maybe call and
ask them?

Heath,

   Thank you. The procmail issue seems to be both subtle and very difficult.
I'm hoping that folks here have sufficient collective insight to help me get
this fixed, too. While I could figure out a kludge for the log summary
report issue, I'm totally clueless on the procmail one.

Drew,

   Thank you. I need to make time to learn what might break if I make this
change. I'm sure there are other components that would need to be changed,
too. Since the incoming mail volume is low (most are rejected by Postfix),
I don't believe that there is a compelling reason to make the change now.

Rich,

Something you might want to consider.  Move to Postfix, Postgrey, 
Dovecot (IMAP), and mail-sieve.

Postfix is rock solid, easy to configure, and with Postgrey tossed in 
I've seen the spam (to a semi-trap account) drop from 20+ a day to a 
worst case of 2 or 3 a day and some times none for days.

IMAP (Dovecot) means your mail stays on the server so is accessible from 
all your computers not just the one you pop'd it to.

Mail-sieve handles nearly everything that procmail does and actually 
gives errors if something fails.

I agree the missing original and resend seems to be pretty good
evidence that locking is not the issue.  It's good to eliminate that
problem.

I haven't read this thread closely, but from what I have seen I don't
know the solution.  Your setup is somewhat complex with the various
layers.  It sounds like procmail is doing the right thing and has been
for a long time.  What is the most recent component you've upgraded or
changed?

Good luck!

Rod,

   I've been using postfix + cyrus + spamassassin for oh, ... 9 years?
Something like that. I tried postgrey but couldn't get it working properly.

   I hardly ever see spam in my inbox now; it's the messages that I expect to
see there and are missing that's the issue.

   I have only the one, plus my notebook. When I travel, I ssh into the
server and read my mail there.

   Worth a look.

   Yeah. It goes Postfix -> Procmail -> mail folder.

   That's correct; about 9 or so years.

   The distribution, but that was early last month and at least two of these
missing messages happened only this week. I doubt the reaction would be so
delayed, and so originator-specific.

Can we assume that DSL is unavailable at your location?  I recently 
evaluated Comcast, Verizon, and Clearwire for my parents in Hillsboro. 
  Given the need/desire for a POTS land line, adding DSL from Verizon 
was the least expensive option.  For a little more money DSL is 
available from local ISPs.  A local ISP will certainly be more 
responsive when it comes to things like Usenet.  They are also less 
likely to arbitrarily block ports, etc.

I have no specific advice; but we use it at work (mostly just me at the
office) and it's performed quite well.  We went with it because we
probably won't stay in that space for very long.  There were a couple of
hiccups immediately after delivering our appliance; but the service has
been solid since then.  We've been using it for about 3 months.

If you can, find out how close you are to the nearest 2 towers.  They
shut down the transmitter we normally use for maintenance and the
support guy said we _should_ have failed over to the next nearest one,
but didn't for some unknown reason.

I also haven't bothered to ask tech support whether or how I can punch a
hole for SSH through the router.  The sales guy said that shouldn't be a
problem; but you know how sales people are.

Oh!  And some yahoo on #orlug (jokingly, I suppose) suggested attacking
us with a DDOS just because we use WIMAX.  So, perhaps there's some
bizarre subculture out there with some WIMAX issues. [grin]

We used Clear where I work for a few months to test it out. Once FiOS came
to our block, we dropped it.

I tried to get ClearWire tech support to help me allow traffic in for SSH
and VNC, but they said this was prohibited. A little google searching
revealed the default password for their silly device, which is "motorola" -
once I logged in, it was trivial to make it do what I wanted.

Also, they don't offer a static IP.

I have had Comcast at home for internet and basic tv channels for
several years. I have never had any significant problem with them.
Recently my modem died and the first tech person I talked to failed to
get the new one working. On the second call I got a different tech
person who did the job right. Other than that minor incompetence, I
have never had a problem. 

I always pay several months in advance to avoid the hassle, which
requires talking to a human instead of the automated telephone system..
About three weeks ago I made such a call and the conversation went like
this:

"I notice you have had no special offers from us for a long time." 
"Ummm, well, I don't need any new service."
"No, I mean I can offer you a reduction of $12 a month in your bill for 
	the next six months." 
"Why? What do I lose?"
"Nothing, we just like to keep our customers happy."
"Oh. OK, I suppose."

He pushed a couple buttons and now my bill is $40 a month instead of
$52.

As for speed, at one time they were throttling torrents, but I'm pretty
convinced they are telling the tuth when they say they are no longer
doing that. Instead they have gone to a monthly download limit and if
you exceed it you get charged more. I don't have any problem with that
business model. It seems reasonable to charge the heavy users more, as
long as they are not secretive about it.

I know I am getting about 2.5 - 3.0 MB/s down and about 450 KB/s up. I
use speedtest.net to check my throughput. Recently Clear had a table at
PSU with a couple employees, each with a laptop. I stopped and asked
them what their bandwidth was. They gave me some number in kb/s, not
MB/s or even KB/s, which makes it hard for me to compare quickly in my
head. So I suggested that one of them go to speedtest.net. They did,
and their download speed was 450 KB/s - a sixth of what I get with
Comcast.

I can add another little fact. There was an older student in my
Phonology class winter term who works for them. Her job is to get use
permits from the city for new tower installations (you can't just build
something any more; it must first be approved by a dozen government
agencies and there has to be a public hearing). She said that they have
at least a couple dozen requests in process all the time because of
their expansion needs. In other words, they are adding infrastructure
that they will own, rather than having to lease poles from other
utilities. I get the impression that they are intending to improve
coverage aggressively.

For me their bandwidth/cost ratio is not impressive. But I am at home
90% of the time, and when I am not at home I am at PSU, Free Geek,
Roots, or someplace else where I can get online for free. If I traveled
all over the city all day long and needed a constant connection that
would be a different matter. Plus, I suspect that if I signed up with
them I wouldn't probably notice a huge loss of speed when surfing
because the bottleneck is on the web site's end, not mine.

   The procmail issue is very specific; apparently it affects only messages
addressed to me at my business domain. The vanishing messages from gte.net,
a company with its own domain, linkedin.com, the mail log summary, and the
netgear security notices are all addressed to rshepard at appl-ecosys.com.

   Every message to a mail list is sorted -- and delivered -- by procmail to
the proper mbox file. Mail addressed to me at my personal domain is plopped
into that mbox file. This leads me to believe that the problem _might_ be
related to /var/spool/mail/rshepard. Except ... I do see new messages in my
INBOX. For example, messages from the Slackware mail list in the UK sent to
me yesterday appeared there. So they were processed by procmail to the
default /var/spool/mail/rshepard.

   Permissions for /var/spool/mail/rshepard are 660 and it's owned by
rshepard.mail. I just now added me to the group 'mail'.

   So, I need help from you folks vastly more experienced than I at tracking
down subtle bugs and system glitches. What information about system status
can I provide? What tests could I run?

   This has nothing to do with the problem. I sent a test message from my
personal domain to my business domain; it ended up in the mbox file for the
former.

I think the explanation is far simpler.

Chris,

   I thought that the message might refer to incoming message, but didn't
grok why the log shows them as denied.

   Could this possibly be related to procmail delivering messages to INBOX
that never show up there?

   Perhaps I'm grasping at straws, but that is all I have now. This mail
issue is way over my head.

Thanks,

Rich

because your system is setup to deny comsat accesses?  fwlogwatch
monitors firewall and syslog entries, right?

that seems unlikely to my mind.  comsat was designed to be separate
from email delivery in my understanding.  the mailman can drop
whatever he wants off on your porch whether your doorbell works or
not.

i've only had half an eye on the thread, but it looks like procmail is
quite willing to deliver the mystery messages to a different folder,
right?  so i think at this point you're only needing to look at
procmail rules to find the culprit.  even if they didn't change, maybe
procmail itself did.  which would be weird since it hasn't been hacked
on since 2001, by appearances.

maybe you call shell script snippets in your recipes and the behavior
of some of those programs has changed?

Comcast has an immediate significant problem for me.  That is, lack of

major advantage of open access networks.  Comcast is largely free to
do whatever they want with rates and restrictions.  Yes, they are

They were probably not Clear employees.  Clear has been extremely open
to resellers.  Many, many podunk little computer consultancies, ISPs,
cell phone dealers, etc have been signing up to resell Clear.  You see
"Clear people" everywhere.  Few to none of them are Clear employees,
any more than the cell phone kiosk dudes/dudettes at the mall are
Verizon or AT&T employees.  I don't know what the resale deal is, but
I suspect they get a cut of the subscription fee.

Clear has had a lot of money dumped into it.  Intel alone gave it
something on the order of $1.5 Billion (somewhat amusingly, the devices
that Clear is using on the network are not using Intel radios, but
broadcom and motorola).  Comcast, Sprint and others have also invested
in Clear.  Right now, Clear is aggressively advertising to get
subscribers.

We (Personal Telco) have been told that Clear can be used to backhaul
PTP hotspots.  If that is verified by experience, then they can be

potential node hosts.

Right now, there are no linux drivers for the Clear USB WiMax device.
So mobile WiMax use for linux (and Mac, I think still) is
problematic.  You can take the Clear Home modem thingie with you, and
it uses a standard 12V power supply and has ethernet ports so drivers
are not an issue with it.  Just a bit bulky, is all.

That is, in summary, what I know about Clear.  Eventually (when device

C'mon Russell, compare them to a local option.

All US options FAIL when compared to Tokyo.
Unless maybe you factor in the cost of rent and food for the humans using the
broadband. We might come out ahead then.

Message-ID: <8975a95f0903261119l5652178frd383649b32f8c48@mail.gmail.com>

Ok, so this is weird.

I have a couple Wordpress 2.7.x sites that are sending 404's to my
monitoring system (Nagios, using the normal check_http plugin) ,
regardless of what URL I hit on the site. And it's a custom
WP-generated 404.

But.

Hitting the sites using a browser from the same server that is hosting
the monitoring works fine. Get content and a 200 status as expected.

Changing my user agent to that which the monitoring system sends
doesn't break it on "real" browsers, so it's not a user agent thing.

The only common thread I can think of is that these sites are running
Wordpress 2.7. They are the only ones we are hosting that are this
new. Any thoughts would be appreciated. My prayers to the Googley-bear
so far have been fruitless.

well, the first step is to see what your server logs have to say.  do you 
see the 404 in there?  anything in the error log?

There are (or were) plenty of free usenet servers around, and some were 
actually pretty reliable, last time I used any.  This is for text 
groups, though.  If you want consistent, reliable access to binary 
newsgroups, you're almost definitely going to have to pay.  The 
alternative is to monitor alt.free.newsgroups closely and jump on any 
notice of free servers that appears there, or find some other source of 
information about the ever-changing world of free binary servers out 
there.  (That can often mean taking advantage of some poor admin's 
configuration error, which leaves a server open to all comers if you 
know where to find it.  Needless to say, these types of mistakes are 
usually corrected PDQ by the company running the server.)  Commercial 
services are numerous and many have a pretty good range of pricing 
plans.  It's not too difficult to find a plan that reflects your usage 
pattern (amount you want to download, rate at which you want to 
download, etc.).

But if you only want access to text newsgroups, check out 
alt.free.newservers and see which seems to be the most popular free 
services around now.  At one time, I used [1] DFNNetNews, based in 
Germany.  It required registration, but was free, complete, and 
reliable.  I'm not sure, however, that it's still available to those 
outside Germany.  The other favorite was [2] Readfreenews, which is run 
by the same guy who runs the commercial provider [3] Octanews, based in 
Minneapolis.  He also runs Big Gulp, which does include binary 
newsgroups, but binary downloading is severely throttled.  Still, if 
your binary needs are very limited, it is a good free option.

As for homepages, what's wrong with iGoogle or similar (Netvibes, 
Pageflakes, etc.)?  What does Comcast's home page have that these don't?

Oddly, nothing in the error log. The page getting sent with the 404
status in the access log though. It doesn't reveal anything that
immediately looks useful to me unfortunately:


1.2.3.4 - - [26/Mar/2009:13:34:14 -0500] "GET http://www.site.org

if that is truly what the log says, then that is your problem.  your 
nagios is trying to do a proxy get (the http: tag).  it should just say 
something like "GET /" for a normal request.

I tried clear a couple months ago.  Dropped it for the following reasons:

- signal becomes very unstable on windy days
- can't change password on the Motorola WiMAX router
- SSH/SSL+IMAP sessions hung on a regular basis
- SMTP server (via gmail) rewrites From: field on ALL msgs
- didn't like being locked into a 2 year contract

That said, I think for casual use where you're not needing to run servers
or session-based apps it's fine.  Anything that runs in a browser seems
not to be affected much by the signal stability issue.

Helpful hint: if you decide to opt-out during the 7-day trial, do it _at_
one of the Clear stores; they'll expedite your request through the phone
queue - probably so you don't make a scene!

Good catch. I totally missed that detail. I monkied with the
check_http command until I hit on something that allowed me to check
vhosts and verify content, I didn't notice it ended up doing the proxy
get. I worked around this by using different options for the
check_http plugin.

Rather than what I used before:

check_http -I 1.2.3.4 -uhttp://vhost.to.check -s"string to look for"

I changed it to:

check_http -H vhost.to.check -s"string to look for"

Which also allows for testing vhosts. I was under the impression that
the -I option was required, but if you use -H you don't need it.

Still funny that only WP 2.7 choked on the weird get.

Thanks!

   I can confirm that this is the case. Adding a procmail recipe to place
business mail in my personal folder has produced messages that outherwise
would have gone missing.

   Where might I find the expertise with procmail to explain why this
suddenly came about and advise me how to fix it?

Keith I was wondering if you had a chance to ask around and see if there are any GNU cash experts in your social circle. 

I may even need a programming project done to make GNU cash multi-user. The rumor is that it used to support a SQL back end but that effort was dropped. I may have someone interested in pursuing that avenue and making the result part of the open source. 

I am local to the NW, but the client is in NY. 

Any thoughts?

If they aren't stuck on GNU Cash there is LedgerSMB -- 
(http://www.ledgersmb.org).   Web based, PostgreSQL as the database, and 
several of the developers appear to be from the Pacific Northwest.

Message-ID: <20090327151637.GA16903@gate.kl-ic.com>

Linuxfest Northwest is April 25 and 26 (Sat/Sun) in Bellingham WA,
gateway to Blaine.  I will be giving a talk on server sky.

Anybody looking for a room or a ride up?

I booked a two-bed room at the Rodeway Inn for Friday (24) and
Sat (25), and would welcome a roommate.  The Rodeway is $129.07
(with tax) for the two nights and has free wifi.   No free 
continental breakfast like the official Hampton Inn, just muffins
and coffee, but it doesn't cost $196.51 for the two nights, either. 
There is a greek restaurant across the parking lot that serves
a real breakfast, and there is a a coffee stand at the Fest.

I plan to drive up Friday, and I have room for two passengers. 
However, my current plan is to spend Sunday night and Monday in
Seattle for business meetings, so riders will either get back
another way, or keep busy for the day in Seattle.  I can drop
folks off at the train station in Bellingham or Seattle if
desired, though the last train leaving Seattle on Sunday is
530pm, and the shuttle bus from Bellingham to that train leaves
early afternoon (before the 'fest ends) so an overnight stay
may be needed anyway.

Subject: [PLUG] Firefox Bookmarks: Maintaining Sorted Order
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0903270900490.13112@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   The way firefox-3.x handles bookmarks is quite different from the way
version 2.x did. In the older version, I could right-click on a list of
bookmarks, select sort, and they would remain that way.

   In the new version I need to select Bookmarks -> Organize -> View -> Sort
(A-Z). However, there is apparently no way to save that view because as soon
as I close the window (either ctrl-w or on the right-most frame button), the
sort order disappears.

   What step have I missed?

TIA,

Rich

Not sure Rich, I had the same issue but I found something called SyncPlaces
http://www.andyhalford.com/syncplaces/ that works great and sorts as well as
stores bookmarks for me.

In Organize Bookmarks, right-click the *folder* in the tree list to get the
context
menu and select Sort By Name at the bottom.  I haven't used the plugin that
Drew
noted; it may offer more options.

Tony,
It does offer more options however it's not entirely germane to the
discussion. Sorry about that. It is an interesting plugin for bookmarks
though. As you can control where they are stored versus something like
foxmarks err xmarks or whatever it's called now. I've used it with great
results.

Cheers

Tony,

   That's what I missed! I was right-clicking on the bookmark leaves, not the
branch on which they occur. I'll still look at the plugin Drew mentioned,
but your point works.

Thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] Security Fears Drive Iran to Linux

This is interesting:

http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/03/security_fears.html

Iranian government reliance on MS is being treated as a national
security risk given MS is a US company.  I've heard this before
referring to hardware and even MS (e.g. US concerns over the Lenovo
purchase of IBM's client business).  I'm not sure I've heard a country
refer to it driving them to Linux.

Cheers,

How to use grub to recover lost GRUB bootloader 

System hard disk profile:

First sata= Windows XP/ntfs. Two partitions, one Windows system, the
other Windows data files. 

Second sata= Ubuntu Intrepid/ext3. Three partitions, one swap, one /,
one (the largest) /home.  

Third sata= Data files/ext3. (mounted stand alone separately
as /home/username/Datadrive)

I understand that you must enter grub, then find /boot/grub/stage1. I
get (hd1,4). Understood.

Next root root (hd1,4). Makes sense. Now the tricky part. 

Type setup (hd1,4)?  Or setup (hd0)?  Or............?

Thanks

Message-ID: <20090327172859.884cc744.johnxj@comcast.net>

The current thread about sorting bookmarks reminded me that I have long wished for a way to be able to use the same bookmarks with different computers, each with different browsers. At home I use my laptop, which has Firefox and Opera. I also have a desktop, also with Firefox and Opera. But when I am at school using a university computer I have no access to the bookmarks in my home computers. 

Naturally, I would export the bookmarks and then edit them to delete anything potentially compromising, like a bank account. Actually the banks' web sites are smart enough that I can't auto-login with a bookmark, so if someone got the link they'd just get the login page and still need the password I use for that bank. Other than a few financial bookmarks, I have nothing else that would be a problem if it was public. Nothing salacious in my bookmark folder.

I just googled a bit and discovered a bewildering list of places that promise to store your bookmarks. Does anyone here use any of these places? Recommendations?

Back when I found bookmarks to be a useful concept I was happy with
del.icio.us.  These days I just google for things I want to find.  I
haven't missed bookmarks.  YMMV!

Foxmarks/ Xmarks works well for me. I don't know if it works with Opera
though? It really does a good job of synchronizing bookmarks between
browsers on separate machines.

Thanks to you and Jason for the suggestions.

I note that del.icio.us and foxmarks/xmarks want to install a plugin on
my browser in order to be able to access my bookmarks. I very much
doubt PSU will let me install a plugin on a browser on their computers.

I think I want something less high tech. Just a web site that I can go
to and there is a list of all my links. The End. No plugins, toolbars,
icons or BS.

With xmarks  you can access / organize your bookmarks via their web
page as well if you like. If you install the plugin on your personal
machines to "seed" your bookmarks, you will then be able to access
them on PSU's machines via their web page.

I can totally relate if you don't want or like plugins.  On the other
hand, I would be surprised if the machines at PSU are configured so
that a normal user is unable to install a firefox plugin.  I'm pretty
sure that's a per user setting.

The same is true of the del.icio.us website, or at least it was when I
used it.  When I first signed up there were no browser plugins as far
as I know.

Good luck,
Jason

You could try portable firefox for complete ease of use or find a
webhost/set up your own and manually export your bookmarks. As I mentioned
in the other thread I use Sync Places because it allows me complete control
rather then some random place hosting my bookmarks. Maybe it's a bit
paranoid but who knows what they could/might/would do with that type of
information.

Thanks for the advice on my trial Clear WiMAX aservice. I still haven't
made up my mind yet but now I have some good knowledge to help.  So far
the service seems blazingly fast with no interference problems due to
weather (or anything else). Maybe because I can hit the broadcast tower
with an energetic stone's throw, with a direct open line of sight to my
modem.   

Some references were made to the modem's password and accessing its
settings. I have Googled myself crazy  but I cannot find any link to a
user's manual for the  Motorola CPEi 150 WiMAX series modem. The account
sales rep didn't leave any manual with device. How did anyone find out
how to access this puppy? 

Any leads to finding out how to get a Motorola CPEi 150 WiMAX modem user
manual or any info about accessing /changing its settings would be
greatly appreciated.

Thanx,

Actually, you can just use a little javascript shortcut to add a 
bookmark to your del.icio.us account, so you don't need to install the 
plugin.  I used the javascript method when I was using Epiphany, the 
GNOME browser, which didn't have a del.icio.us plugin.  The "official" 
plugin has a couple of extra features, but they aren't necessary; the 
bit of javascript will work with any browser that does javascript.

But now I'm using Xmarks and Firefox (Iceweasel), though I still have my 
del.icio.us account.

One nice thing about del.icio.us is that I've found it to be a really 
helpful source of OSS tutorials and tips.  Of course, you don't need 
your own del.icio.us account to use it as a search engine.  Just sayin', 
for the benefit of anyone who's never bothered with social or remote 
bookmarking, that del.icio.us is worth checking out for more targeted 
and potentially more useful results than you might typically get from 
Google, particularly on subjects related to desktop 
computing/publishing, website design and content management, fonts, and 
the like.

What I've found, after frustration with the same issue, is that if you 
open the bookmarks sidebar (keyboard: CTRL+B; menu: View-> Sidebar-> 
Bookmarks) and right-click on the bookmark folder you want to sort, or 
right-click on "Bookmarks Menu" if you want to sort all your bookmarks, 
and select "Sort by Name," then Firefox will preserve the sort order. 
Note that if you have a lot of bookmarks it will take several seconds; 
I've found that whistling helps pass the time.

If you do it this way, then go back to Bookmarks -> Organize etc., 
you'll see that they are, in fact, now sorted in alphabetical order.

Don't ask me why it only preserves the sort order when you sort via the 
sidebar.  It just does.  I have accepted that this is a question I will 
go to my grave not knowing the answer to.

Initially it was possible to get a root terminal, but they can push
updates to it via wimax so plugging in the power was sufficient for
the more locked down firmware to get installed.

Thank you very much!


I don't know what I'd do  without this PLUG list. I was more than
competent with Windows and a simple Surfboard cable modem. I chose to
switch to Linux (Intrepid, soon to be Jaunty) and explore other
broadband options (may risk a 2 year contract with WiMAXX with this
blazing fast connection; 30% faster than Comcast according to Internet
speed test sites). 

All this is new to me and the PLUG list is a great educational source.
In a few weeks I should have gained enough Linux knowledge to volunteer
some time at one of the Free Geek clinics. Help out some other Linux
newbies and give back to the Portland Linux community. And learn even
more from some of the more experienced Linux hands. 

Linux FOREVER! 

Thanx again!

Subject: [PLUG] Spam on the plug wiki
Message-ID: <20090329184326.GA22673@gate.kl-ic.com>

Nobody is using the plug wiki, at  pdxlinux dot org slash wiki  .
Except the spammers, there are about 900 pages of spam there.
I do not have administrative privileges, so I can't clean it out.

I was hoping this would evolve into the main portal for PLUG -
that way we could maintain it.  I spent quite a few hours setting
up the library (which only a few people used).  But you can't 
always get what you want.

So we have a decision to make - are we going to use the wiki,
or abandon it?  If we use it, we will need to add some simple
stuff like a "textcha" to hinder the spammers.  So far, that 
has worked on the moinmoin wiki on my own server.  We would
need to advertise it, and some of us would need administrative
privileges to maintain it.

Otherwise, we should probably nuke it.  I would like to save
a copy (mostly to capture the library pages), but I don't want
a place for spammers to store their garbage.  Perhaps we can
leave a shell up, and redirect the links to www.fbi.gov;  they
don't care about stopping real criminals, but at least they
and the spammers can use each other's bandwidth.

   No comment on the 'main portal' idea, but I could see a lot of value by
posting issues and their solutions by category on the wiki page. Over the
years I've saved mail list messages that answered questions posed by me and
others that I knew would be useful in the future when I again needed that
information. This type of content could benefit everyone.

Who does have admin privileges?  Maybe there should be more than one, if
that
is not already the case.

Subject: [PLUG] Bug confirmation help needed
Message-ID: <20090329132615.5ed89963.johnxj@comcast.net>

I have filed a bug report here:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/351080

I first discovered this bug while working in OOo 3.0.1 in Intrepid. I
have just tried the March 26 beta of Jaunty and the bug persists.

What would be helpful are:

1) Confirmation from other users of Intrepid and Jaunty, especially
non-Gnomies.

2) Confirmation from users of non-Ubuntu Linuces that the bug does
NOT exist for them. Or that it does, if that is the case, although I
suspect the problem is peculiar to Ubuntu.

The bug affects about half of the IPA glyphs in a font, but only when
the bold attribute is applied. I never noticed the problem until just
now because I rarely use bold. Unfortunately my bug report is coming
very late in the development of Jaunty (release date April 23).

An easy way to test this is to copy and paste the following line into
your favorite word processor or Scribus:

Linguists need combining diacriticals to write something like [b?t??].

When you apply bold the three IPA characters in the last word may drop
out. If they do, change to other fonts. Those three characters are
extremely common and just about all fonts these days contain them. You
can verify that they exist in the fonts you try it with by going to
character map. The names to search on are "small cap i," "tie bar," and
"esh." The Unicode numbers are 026A, 0361 and 0283. Although the bug
affects many other glyphs, those three should suffice as a test.

   I'm totally stymied. I still have the procmail issue (and the postfix log
summary issue has reared up again, but that's a different topic ... I
think), and cannot find help in resolving it.

   The postfix mail list apparently doesn't have the expertise to offer.
There no longer is a procmail mail list because the server in Germany is no
longer on the 'Net. Friday I subscribed to comp.mail.misc and posted a
request for help there; today it's still the only article on that news
group.

   Arrr-r-g-g-g-h-h-h-h!! Where can I go to learn how to find what broke and
how to fix it?

What should it be used for?  What does "main portal" mean, in this context?

I guess I haven't used the PLUG wiki because I've not been clear on how 
I should be using it, or what people expect to find there.

Shuttle uses the Nvidia 8200 chipset and includes HDMI out. I'm

Message-ID: <20090330052433.GA24169@gate.kl-ic.com>

A month or so ago, someone suggested the DGS2208 D-Link "green"
ethernet switch.  I had a 5 port Linksys go flaky on me, so I
bought the little brother, the DGS2205, at Fry's today for $30.
Indeed, it draws only 2W compared to the 4W that the Linksys
draws, and it is a gigabit switch. 

I will probably buy two of the DGS2208's mail order - Newegg
is selling them for $44.99, and D-Link is offering a $10 rebate
for each of 2 or less.  I suppose I should have bought the
DGS2205 from them, too, because Newegg is covered by the rebate,
and Fry's isn't.

Well, I can *delete* it, even though I can't mark it as spam and
train the wiki.  So I deleted 537 spams over a few hours.  That
is either way obsessive or a great way to get my aggressions out
( DIE SPAMMER!  YOU DIE TOO, SCUM! ).  It would be nice to have
a faster way (like root access, and mass deletes of globs).

Thanks to Ronald Chmara for dealing with the last infestation a
month ago.  This garbage comes in waves, and we are in the
middle of one now, a few came in while I was deleting.

Textchas can slow it way down.  For example, the following clause
can be added to the file:  /home/[wiki name here]/moin/wikiconfig.py

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    textchas_disabled_group = u"TrustedEditorGroup" # members don't get textchas
    textchas = {
        'en': { 
            u"Name a primary color": ur"(red|green|blue,yellow)",
            u"What city is pdxlinux located in?": ur"Portland",
            u"Who is the President of the United States?": ur"(Obama|Barack Obama)",
            u"Name a Portland bridge": ur"Sellwood|Ross Island|Marquam|Hawthorne|Morrison|Burnside|Steel|Broadway|Fremont|St Johns|Saint Johns",
            u"The number of a Portland interstate freeway is": ur"(205|I205|405|I405|84|I84|5|I5)",
        },
        # you can add more languages if you like
    }
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
These should be common knowledge, have short unambiguous answers,
not opinions, not esoteric.  This is to stop 'bots, not test trivia
knowledge.  The Portland bridge question shows that some questions
have far too many answers, and some answers can be expressed in
more than one way.  On my wiki, I ask questions about time units,
some antonyms, and so forth.  Perhaps at Thursday afters we can
collect a few questions to put in the textcha clause.  The best
questions will be the ones everybody can answer, and most robots
cannot.

   Are the robots capable of correctly parsing the question? Is there a way
to restrict wiki postings to subscribers of the mail list? I ask out of
ignorance. I've made use of application-specific wikis and have not seen
messages on the associated mail lists of wiki spam, so I'm curious why this
one is different.

Thanks,

I've installed phpldapadmin in my never ending quest to confuse the  
hell out of myself.

openldap is working fine. I have one of my systems authenticating via  
ldap, and it seems to be working fine.

I can log into phpldapadmin as any of the users on the system. They  
have read only access. This is how it's supposed to be.

I can not for the life if me figure out how to log in as an admin of  
the ldap directory. So far, I can add, delete, query and modify  
records from the command line, and view them in phpldapadmin.

I have the Manager account set up in openldap as outline on this page: http://www.server-world.info/en/note?os=ce5&p=ldap

If someone knows where the magic is hiding, I'm all ears. I've  
googled, scoured both the openldap and phpldapadmin sites, but can't  
seem to add an administrative user.

Thanks in advance!

That's just it, As I browse the table, I don't see anything but the  
users I imported from the NIS setup.

I have the Manager setup as in this ldif:

dn: dc=dimstar,dc=net
objectClass: dcObject
objectClass: organization
o: dimstar Organization
dc: dimstar

dn: cn=Manager,dc=dimstar,dc=net

cn:manager

dn: ou=People,dc=dimstar,dc=net
objectClass: organizationalUnit
ou: People

dn: ou=Group,dc=dimstar,dc=net
objectClass: organizationalUnit
ou: Group

and I've put in a password that works at the command line. but this  
user can't log into the web interface.

If the configuration is correct, you just need to login with a valid
account to manage everything....

cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com

with the appropriate password.

Try first with the account used in the SLAPD configuration file that can
already read / update the database.

On my system, the main account I use for administration is:
simpleSecurityObject

It is also: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com

(domain name changed)

Does that help?

Some time ago I bitched about feedback noise from the computer to my
stereo. Think of a public address microphone where you get feedback
weeooweeoowow because the microphone is positioned too close to the
speakers.

I no longer use the radio in the receiver. All sound comes from the
desktop computer which is connected from the sound card output via
cable with RCA plugs to the video input on the receiver. I have a
little adapter for the 3.5 mm mini headphone jack on the sound card to
RCA jacks. The source is usually streaming internet radio, sometimes my
own mp3 collection, and occasionally a movie. Eventually I will use the
computer for television as well.

The problem seems worse when the humidity is low. Moving my body
slightly affects it. 

The longest wire in the setup is the pair of RCA cables from the
computer to the stereo. I bought a pair of triple shielded cables on
eBay and they arrove the other day. I thought this would be the
solution, but after switching to the new cables it is even worse. So
much for shielding.

In the computer I have turned off or down to zero all microphone
inputs. I have turned the sound volume down to about 20% and use the
volume control on the receiver to increase the volume to normal
listening levels.

There is a lot of electronic equipment and wiring in the room, but I
can't get rid of any of it.

If anyone has any suggestions I'm all ears. Literally.

Someday there may be a robot capable of parsing the questions,
but the robots are not customized or sophisticated; for now they
just quit and move on.  I thought of an easier way to fool robots,
and doesn't require much special knowledge, just the ability to
parse english, for example:

What word tungsten doesn't belong in this sentence?

If the robots (or the humans programming them) figure out the
answers to a set of questions, we just replace them.  This is
an arms race we can win, unless somebody wants to spend a more
time breaking into our wiki than we spend defending it.

Once the wiki is defendable, we can start putting the main page
information on it, presentation announcements, etc., and the
overworked maintainers won't have to.

Feedback?  That is an open microphone somewhere, typically the one
on the laptop itself.  Can you disable it in the BIOS? 

Or perhaps it is the radio eavesdropping device implanted in your
house by FBI agents back during the J. Edgar Hoover era.  :-)

If your problem is actually bleedthrough from some other source, 
then sometimes cleaning the connectors so they make good contact
is helpful.  Sometimes Oregon dampness corrodes connectors, and
the corrosion acts like a diode, which rectifies radio signals,
which makes the diode and audio system behave like a crystal radio
receiver for AM signals.  

Or perhaps you need somebody to come take a look.  This kind of 
thing is difficult to diagnose remotely.

Any ACL's in place that might block access? And as was mentioned the
password/user combo should be the one that exists in slapd.conf.

You should be able to rule out audio feedback by using earphones on the 
receiver, and no speakers.  If the problem remains, it is some type of 
electrical coupling.  What gain settings affect it?  Receiver gain, mixer 
settings, etc.  I have this problem if the line input to the sound card (for 
recording) is on at the same time the line output (for playing) is on.

I agree with Keith that remote diagnosis is difficult.  You wanna host a party?

OK, even weirder... If I user ldapadmin on Windows, everything works

So you're able to bind as the manager/admin whatever user you have set up :)
The logs for my ldap server are stored in /var/log/debug but depending on
your platform and logging options they may be somewhere else. You might look
in there to see if you can find any errors that might be useful in figuring
this out.

Ground each piece of equipment to your electrical ground in the 
conduits. For multiple boxes, be sure that each ground path branches off 
from the ground wire but does NOT form ground LOOPS. In other words, if 
you have three boxes A, B, and C, then if you ground A to the wall and 
then tie B to A, and then you may tie C to either A, B, or directly to 
the wall elsewhere. HOWEVER:

1.  If you ground C to the wall, do NOT *also* tie it to either A,
   (Loop: GND - A - C - GND)

   or B  (Loop: GND - A - B - C - GND)

2. If you ground C to A, do do NOT *also* tie it to B
   (Loop: C - A - B - C)

If you can login correctly from Windows, then I would imagine that your
local configuration is not setup correctly for connecting to the Directory
Service.

Possibly the values for connecting to the database and/or the auth type
are not correct (in xxx/phpldapadmin-xxxx/config/config.php).

I think for some of the problems I was seeing at home I looked at
/var/log/syslog to help troubleshoot.  But check there and
/var/log/messages, if you have logging enabled.

I like your suggestion, but I have also seen the use of SSL as a way
to deter wiki spam bots.  I don't really understand why using https
instead of http deters bots, it seems like the author could easily
update the bot to support SSL but a friend of mine put his personal
mediawiki instance behind https and it stopped all the spammers.

Anyway, just a thought.  I don't really know if this suggestion is
appropriate for the wiki.

That's an interesting idea.  pdxlinux.org would need a cert, or it
would look untrustworthy.  On Feb 25 Joey Pruett suggested:

I looked at that site:

http://www.rapidsslonline.com/rapidssl-certificates.php

... for a "single root certificate".  I will have to learn what
that means and how it applies to a site.  Does that certify all
pages https://www.pdxlinux.org/*  ?

Thanks!

No, I don't need the screenshots.

As far as I can tell the problem happens only in 3.01 and even then
only on Intrepid and Jaunty.

well, i'm a Gnomie, using OOo 3.0.1 on Intrepid (Upgraded from Hardy) 
and it looks fine, except in a couple of free fonts that apparently lack 
some of the the characters.

The laptop is sitting in a docking bay on the same table as the
desktop, but is not connected to the stereo. It is the desktop that
serves as the audio source. The desktop has no microphone, although the
sound card does have an input jack for one.

There is a microphone on the laptop, but I don't see how it could have
anything to do with the problem. Also, it is only a little hole less
than half a centimeter. When the wailing started a few minutes ago I
put my finger over it and there was no effect on the feedback.

As for the desktop, not only does it not have a microphone, but I have
turned off all microphone inputs in the alsa sound thingy. Those that I
couldn't put a red X on I moved the sliders down to zero.

It would even be difficult to diagnose if you were standing in the
room. Because every slight movement of your body affects it.

The fact that body movement changes the frequency and volume tells me
it has to be RF. Does there exist a device for sniffing out the source
of whatever is transmitting RF? Maybe I could point the thing at all
the electronic equipment in the room until it lights up.

I'm mostly pissed off that my fancy triple shielded audio cables that I
paid $5 for on eBay actually made the problem worse. The signal has to
be coming into the receiver via that cable, because it is the only
cable connected to any of the input sources on the receiver.

I assume you probably know, but since it's possible that you've got a
lot of book learning on basic electronics but not much real world
experience I wanted to point out a couple things.

That example in class was actually pretty bad. With the car battery
hooked up to the starter and the headlights in series. Of course if
they were ever wired that way neither one of them would work properly.
Almost everything in a car is in parallel with each other, of course,
except for the controls for those circuits.

But (and this is the troublesome part,) you also mentioned that if the
starter needed all the energy then the lights wouldn't get any, though
they would still get the current. If the lights were getting current
then they would have a voltage drop, and in every case the starter
would be a lower resistance than the headlights, so the lights would
use more power than the starter any way you configured that series
circuit.

I didn't speak up because you were just trying to introduce a basic
concept and thought maybe you were just dumbing it down for that
purpose, but those statements still bothered me some.

I very much doubt it is a ground problem. Would not a ground problem
produce a hum? Specifically a 60 Hz hum? I know what a 60 Hz hum sounds
like and this is nothing at all like that. This is a wailing that
varies in frequency and intensity as you move around or as a bird flies
overhead.

Anyway, all the equipment is plugged into the same circuit. And I did
all the wiring in this house myself so I know everything is well
grounded. Not only that but I have double the code requirements for
grounding - I have two water bonds and four 10 foot copper rods buried
15 feet apart outside. You can sit by an outlet in my house and watch
the stray electrons in the air being sucked into the ground holes. OK,
maybe not. Wait, electrons flow the other way, don't they. Oh well. I
find it difficult to believe that it has anything to do with grounding.

single root means that the certificate you get is directly trusted by a 
certificate that is in most browsers.  lots of other cheap certs have to 
use an intermediate certficiate authority to get to a directly trusted 
cert (which isn't very hard to setup, but a pain none the less).

if you get a cert for www.pdxlinux.org, then all urls using 
www.pdxlinux.org would be protected.  you can also use the cert for smtp, 
pop, imap, ftp, etc for the hostname www.pdxlinux.org.  the cert will not 
protect a url with just pdxlinux.org in the url.  the certs from godaddy 
require the intermediate cert, but are setup to work for both the 
www.domaim.com and domain.com formats.  i've been poking at rapidsslonline 
to add that feature in, but haven't gotten any buy in from them yet.

Aha! it's not the path(s) to ground, but rather that if you create a 
LOOP which may then act as a receiving antenna for HIGH frequency 
emissions from unshielded equipment. The resistance to ground at low 
frequencies (60hz, 120hz, etc.) may indeed be nearly zero, but the 
impedance at high frequencies is another matter.

The loop gets excited by receiving the RF, and SHARES it with all the 
participating components. The noise you hear is the frequency of the 
emission source plus or minus any fun overtones you get from the 
resonance frequency of the loop (which depends on the size of the loop.

Moving your body (a watery mass) with respect to the loop also changes 
its high frequency characteristics. Bullet chronometers work this way - 
the metal projectile moving PAST two V-shaped antenna a known distance 
apart causes impedance variations; the first acts as a trigger (pulse) 
and the second stops the timer. The time of flight is calculated from 
the two events a known distance apart in time and space, and vee-o-la, 
(viola!) you get a reading in feet per second without touching the 
actual bullet in flight.

If you have an RF noise source and a loop in any signal paths (not just 
grounds) then that loop may pick up the emitted noise or a harmonic 
multiple of it...

OK, you're the first person I have heard from who is using 3.0.1 on
Gnome and Intrepid, and does NOT have the problem. You realize that
makes you a very, very special person!

Further details: The final word in that selection - [b?t??] - contains
three glyphs from the IPA and combining diacriticals blocks of Unicode,
specifically 026A, 0361 and 0283. In most programs the leading zero is
not required, including OOo.

Can you test something further? 

Just about all fonts contain those glyphs unless it is really basic,
which is possible in some of the freeware fonts. However, they
definitely exist in FreeSerif Sans and Serif, Junicode, Times New
Roman, Nimbus, Liberation Sans and Serif, Linux Libertine, Bitstream
Charter and Vera Sans, Verdana, and all varieties of Arial.

So, specially just for you, I have prepared the following text:

Bitstream Charter Regular [b?t??]
Bitstream Charter Italic [b?t??]
Bitstream Charter Bold [b?t??]
Bitstream Vera Sans Regular [b?t??]
Bitstream Vera Sans Italic [b?t??]
Bitstream Vera Sans Bold [b?t??]
FreeSerif Regular [b?t??]
FreeSerif Italic [b?t??]
FreeSerif Bold [b?t??]
FreeSans Regular [b?t??]
FreeSans Italic [b?t??]
FreeSans Bold [b?t??]
Liberation Sans Regular [b?t??]
Liberation Sans Italic [b?t??]
Liberation Sans Bold [b?t??]
Liberation Serif Regular [b?t??]
Liberation Serif Italic [b?t??]
Liberation Serif Bold [b?t??]
Nimbus Sans Regular [b?t??]
Nimbus Sans Italic [b?t??]
Nimbus Sans Bold [b?t??]
Nimbus Serif Regular [b?t??]
Nimbus Serif Italic [b?t??]
Nimbus Serif Bold [b?t??]
Verdana Regular [b?t??]
Verdana Italic [b?t??]
Verdana Bold [b?t??]

It would be awesome if you can open a blank document in OOo 3.0.1,
Scribus (any version), KWord, and AbiWord, and paste the above into
them. Then apply the fonts as listed. If you don't have all of those
programs, not to worry, just use the ones you do have.

And when you are done, print the documents and compare the printouts to
what you see on screen. And then send me screenshots from each
application with commentary as to how the printout may have differed.

That is a lot to ask, but since you are the only one I have run into
who says they do not have the problem, I'd like to verify first of all
that you really don't have the problem. And once we are sure, then I
want to try to figure out why.

You are so very unique. You are very special to me. OK, don't take that
the wrong way. (And prescriptivists can shut up about how I use the
word "unique.")

And anyone else on this list who has Intrepid and any of the above
programs, you can help by doing the same. And if you have some other
distro, it would also be helpful, because I think the problem is only
in Intrepid and Jaunty. It would be good to verify that, or discover
that it also affects certain versions of other distros.

Do you have a cell phone with a GPRS radio? How close is your wireless
router to the desktop?  Completely out of left field but I've had GPRS
equipped cell's cause RF interference when they periodically ping the tower
on all types of equipment from audio sources to TV's.

Message-ID: <1238458194.11676.65.camel@eris>

I'd look for a motherboard with an Intel or AMD chipset if I were you.

As Charlie Demerjian said at The Inquirer today, "Nvidia chipsets are
not only buggier than the mattress of a third-world prostitute, but
their Linux drivers are barely functional if you can find them."

http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/583/1051583/nehalem-proves-server-mettle 

Admittedly Charlie dislikes Nvidia, but I happen to have a machine with
a Nvidia chipset, an Asus Crosshair with the Nvidia C51/MCP55 chipset,
and it's got a memory controller bug.  When that system gets powered off
and turned back on, it won't detect the 2G of Crucial PC6400 DRAM in it.
I have to open the case and put in a 512MB stick of PC5300 to reset the

However, other than that minor problem, the motherboard seems to work.
It was free from a friend, but I'd get something else if I were buying.

the worm won't infect the linux boxes, but it is completely unknown what 
will happen on april 1 when the worm reaches out for new instructions.  it 
could turn every infected machine into a full bandwidth data source, or 
any other kind of nasty thing can could certainly impact any system on the 
internet.  it all depends on how warped the minds are that can access one 
of the thousands of domains that conficker may check for new instructions.

wednesday may be an interesting day...

I've got a Gigabyte GA-MA78G-DS3H (that's an SB700 chipset, w/ onboard
ATI Radeon HD 3200 video). It has HDMI out, though I have no idea if
it works (nothing to plug it into). DVI/VGA are fine, though quite new
X.org drivers are necessary for even 2D acceleration. The radeonhd
driver initially gave better support, though work appears to be
proceeding quickly on 2D/3D R600/700 video in the radeon (aka ati)
driver now. That's what I've used for the last month or so in Fedora's
rawhide.

Wow, I'm really sorry, cause this went out to the wrong address. I
started typing it in and I guess it autocompleted to the wrong
address. Oops.

But no, the lights would not act as a fuse. They are a resistive load
meant to be run at the full battery voltage, so they would limit the
current possible through the starter to roughly the same as they would
use without it in series, since the starter has so much lower
resistance than they do. So if the starter solenoid was engaged and
the light switch on you wouldn't see much difference in the light
output from the headlights, but the starter sure wouldn't be spinning!

Sorry everyone for the email!

I don't know anything about libgd, but presumably from the output of
rpm we can say it's installed.  Next I would look at config.log to see
if you can figure out why the test for libgd failed.  For example, the
configure script could be looking in the wrong path.  In a case like
that the next step is to figure out if you just need a symlink or
similar to get it working.  Also, there may be a flag you can pass to
configure that tells it where your libgd is installed.

I've also seen configure scripts give output like this when they can
find the required library but it doesn't have the correct api.  In
that situation the test in the configure script fails because of api
incompatibility but with a potentially misleading error message.

By the way, what version of gd-devel is on your CentOS 5.2 machine?

Message-ID: <20090330234953.4f9d35f1.johnxj@comcast.net>

I need to register a domain name for commercial purposes. The name is
available.

The question I have is about hiding the registrant's information. I
have another domain name and I was required to give a phone number by
the outfit that registered it for me. At least once every couple of
weeks I get a telemarketing call. The idea of having my details kept
from the public is enticing. 

Network Solutions will do it, but they want $10 a year to keep the
information private. They're also not cheap on the per-year
registration fees. 

I could use some suggestions for who does this, who is cheap, and who
does a good job. Oh, and I plan to register it for at least ten years
so I don't have to revisit this issue until I am closer to dead.

Thanks to Tim for pointing out a logical next step. I was spending so  
much time trying to figure out how to create the admin user, it didn't  
dawn on me that the user already existed, but phpldapadmin was  
attempting to auth the wrong way.

In the config file for phpldapadmin is this paragraph:

/* If you specified 'cookie' or 'session' as the auth_type above, you  
can
    optionally specify here an attribute to use when logging in. If  
you enter
    'uid' and login as 'dsmith', phpLDAPadmin will search for  
(uid=dsmith)
    and log in as that user.
    Leave blank or specify 'dn' to use full DN for logging in. Note  
also that if
    your LDAP server requires you to login to perform searches, you  
can enter the
    DN to use when searching in 'login_dn' and 'login_pass' above. You  
may also
    specify 'string', in which case you can provide a string to use  
for logging
    users in. See 'login_string' directly below. */
// $ldapservers->SetValue($i,'login','attr','dn');
// $ldapservers->SetValue($i,'login','attr','uid');

When I got there, the bottom line was NOT commented out. So,  
phpldapadmin was looking for a uid to auth against.

Bottom line; now I can modify the ldap data from the phpldapadmin  
interface.

Thanks!

Most registrars seem to have some sort of private whois registration.  I
think it solely depends on how many (useless to me) services you want from
the registrar.  I mostly use godaddy.com for my registrar and private
domains, but I'm thinking of switching to namecheap.com for cost savings.
So long as it will protect my name/number/address, and points to the right
nameservers, that's about all I need it to do.

I use Dotster because they are relatively cheap .. they did raise their
rates recently for a yearly registration. I can look it up but I believe
their rate for a proxy whois was a nominal fee of like 2 bucks. Bonus points
for them being a local outfit based in Vancouver.

How do I get swap to go down??

It is currently at 95%...

I had firefox up and it leaked and filled swap..

Killed firefox but, swap is still high...

Guess I could log out and log in??

There must be a better way??

Name.com is the same company with a cheaper price (I used to work at
Dotster, I know all the tricks).

$8.99/yr registration, free whois privacy (last I checked).

Thanks guys. I shopped all the suggestions and ended up
at namecheap. For 10 years including privacy service it came to 122.82,
and they take PayPal.

Now I need to think about a web site for it. But that will come later.
First I need to finish writing the book I will sell on it.

He was trying to compile nut-2.2.2 on Centos 4.7.  There is an EPEL
package for RHEL4 which
is a little older that could work.

Should be:

top is great for finding things like that.

Run 'top', then press "M" to sort by resident memory (usually good
enough) or press F (change sort column) then o (select virtual mem.)

The biggest consumers will be listed at the top, and you can kill them
(k) by pid from within top (defaults to sending a SIG_INT, iirc.) or
you can just figure out which window it is on your own from the
command name shown in top.

I am forwarding this information to the entire group.
This is a conference we want to support as much as possible.

(1)  It is sort of a replacement for OSCON in Portland

(2)  It is definitely a community sponsored conference and that is really COOL.

Hi David,

I'm attaching our standard form letter for the conference :) ?The main
take-aways are that we have a user group discount, call for proposals
ends March 31, we'd love some more proposals, and could you pass this
on to the user group related lists you're on!

Thanks!!
-selena

I'm co-chair of Open Source Bridge, a new open source developers?
conference being held June 17?19, 2009 in Portland, Oregon. We?re
aiming to connect people across projects, languages and experience and
would love to have members of PLUG involved as speakers and
participants. More details about the conference are included below.

We?d be delighted it if you could mention Open Source Bridge at the
next PLUG meeting, post this email to your mailing list, and get us in
touch with others in your community interested in participating.

Our call for proposals is closing on March 31st, so please pass this
information on as soon as possible.

We don?t expect something for nothing, so we?re giving all of your
user group members a discounted registration rate of $150. That?s $25
off the Early Bird rate, and $100 off our regular registration. User
groups are very important to Audrey and I ? that?s how we both got
started in the open source community.

We?re also offering a free conference pass to give away to a member of
your group. If you?re interested in more ways to promote the
conference, let us know!

Thank You!
Selena
Open Source Bridge
http://opensourcebridge.org/

CONFERENCE PASS RAFFLE INFORMATION:

You get one free conference pass to raffle off to a member of your group!

We?ve found the most successful raffles tend to follow these conditions:

1) Let all of your members know about the conference, dates, and URL:
http://opensourcebridge.org/
2) Allow anyone in the group to sign up for the raffle.
3) Draw the winner at random, preferably at a public meeting.

When you have selected a winner, email
usergroups at opensourcebridge.org, CC the winner, and we?ll register
them for you.

DETAILS TO SHARE WITH YOUR GROUP?S MEMBERS:

Open Source Bridge
http://opensourcebridge.org

Open Source Bridge is a new conference for developers working with
open source technologies. It will take place June 17-19 in Portland,
OR, with five tracks connecting people across projects, languages and
experience to explore how we do our work and why we participate in
open source. The conference structure is designed to provide
developers with an opportunity to learn from people they might not
connect with at other events.

Open Source Bridge is run entirely by volunteers who believe in the
need for an open source conference that focuses on the culture of
being an open source citizen, regardless of where in the stack you
choose to code. All proceeds from conference registration and
sponsorship go directly to the costs of the conference.

Our sessions and events will share in-depth knowledge about using,
creating and contributing to open source as citizens of a greater
community. You?ll find relevant information whether you write web apps
for the cloud, tinker with operating system internals, create
hardware, run a startup, or blog about technology.

We?re still seeking session proposals, so submit yours by the end of March 31st.

Some examples of our proposals so far: Brian Aker on Drizzle, a reboot
of MySQL designed ?for the cloud?; Linux Kernel hacker Greg K-H about
how Linux manages development; Ward Cunningham, inventor of the wiki,
about what?s next in collaboration; Amber Case, an anthropologist
living in both the physical and virtual worlds, about Cyborg
Citizenship. (You can view all current proposals at
http://opensourcebridge.org/proposals/)

In addition to regular conference sessions, we will hold an
unconference day for free-form sessions, and host a 24-hour dedicated
?hacker lounge? at the top of the Portland Hilton. In addition to
hosting the hacker lounge, the Hilton has offered Open Source Bridge
attendees steeply discounted room rates, starting at $139/night.

The city of Portland is a great place to visit. It has a thriving
technical community, a love of all things open source and offers many
attractions for visiting geeks, including Powell?s technical books,
dozens of local brewpubs, and large greenspaces like Forest Park?all
accessible by mass transit.

Visit http://opensourcebridge.org/ to learn more about the conference,
see our session proposals, and register to attend.

Thanks!

PS: Interested in taking advantage of the user group discount code
that will allow user group members to register for $150? Enter
?osb4228? when you register to receive the discount.

If he's looking for a topic, I'd be interested in hearing why I can't
stay connected to pub.net, but never have a problem with any other
wireless location. <Dig, dig>

OK, that was kind of mean. But it's true that something has been wacky
ever since last summer when they rearrranged stuff.

It looks like the 825VA unit is supported, maybe it will just work.
All I want to be able to do is monitor the battery life.  The unit
that is connected to this UPS isn't a typical computer, it's a 
router.  If only my brother had refrained from buying a no name
UPS.

Anyways, the sticker on the bottom say CPS425SL.  Hmm, maybe this

And why should we care about this?  Call me cynical, but when 
something like this gets posted from a heretofore unknown email 
address, my astroturf-sense gets all tingling.

It's bad enough when slashdot.org starts reading like 
backslashdot.org, but when it happens to my local linux mailing list 
it's about more than I can handle.

And if you're around a computer at 2pm tomorrow (wednesday),
we're interviewing Selena and Audrey for FLOSS Weekly, streamed live

My guess is that it's from Tim Slighter.  At least, same IP address and
Thunderbird stamp.

We should care about future releases of IE because the majority of the
world uses Microsoft products which partly sets the bar for other
software products.

Well, you shouldn't. But more importantly, keep in mind it's April 1st 
in some parts of the world already. ;) IE allowing you to switch to 
gecko or webkit for rendering? I don't think so.

...aaand the subject is incorrect--CFP deadline has been extended to 10 april.

something to be aware of is that this is not a purely technical
conference.  it is about technology, but not everyone speaking is
going to be a kernel hacker, programming guru, or even project
management wonk.  the list of tracks here:

http://opensourcebridge.org/events/2009/tracks

is a peek into the different aspects of technology that one might
address in a talk.  there's quite likely something for everyone who's
motivated to contribute, even if it be with a topic of "how to
interact well with a local linux users group" =)

I will be pushing for Lucky Lab Northwest, 1945 NW Quimby.  We had
our little alternate-advanced-topics aka server-sky discussion
there, and the place is relatively empty.  They also have a
screen, and a bigger meeting room, so this is an excellent
alternative for Advanced Topics if Roots is unavailable.

Afters at the S.E.  Hawthorne Lab in March was so crowded that
we ended up outside in the frozen smoke zone.

OTOH, we may get pushback from our large and respected eastside
colleagues.  If there are good reasons for the Hawthorne site
(possibly sitting outside), please share them, and we can
finalize this at the meeting.

The top 5 ways to tell that unemployment is getting the upper hand....

5.  You have rebuilt your system so many times that you forget what OS 
it has
4.  You spend all day trying to custom build an application that already 
is        available as a working app
3.  You change all of your email addresses to see if you can erase your 
online identity
2.  You have a data center at home that sucks up more kilowatts per hour 
than the data center where you last worked
 
And the number 1  .....

1.  You post reviews on Internet Explorer on a Linux mailing list to see 
how many neck hairs you can raise  .. hah hah

Subject: [PLUG] Going back to Hardy
Message-ID: <20090331175140.0b2a239a.johnxj@comcast.net>

I have been using Intrepid x86_64 since last December. At first I
didn't notice any significant problems, but lately I have been working
on a book that requires extensive use of characters not found on a
standard US keyboard. I have been tearing my hair out getting correct
print output. Sometimes the screen is correct and the printout is wrong
and sometimes both are wrong.

For example, I have characters appear on the screen and fail to appear
in the printout. Today, for example, someone looking at a page of my
book noted that I had left out an open quote. Then we noticed another
missing open quote a couple lines later. And another a few lines later.
Sure enough, they appear on screen but fail to print.

In other cases OOo substitutes another font for certain glyphs on
screen, but fails to print them. And when I take the text and paste it
into Abiword, KWord or Scribus the glyphs drop out on screen as well as
in the printout. This happens with all fonts I have installed. I.e., it
is not a font problem.

When I create a stacked formula in OOo Writer the brackets look OK on
screen and in the printout, except they are very faint. To overcome the
faintness I applied bold to the brackets. That makes the brackets
appear superfat on screen, and their width on screen varies according
to the number of items in the stack - the more items the wider the
bracket on screen. Yet most print with a bold bracket. However, some
print with one side of the bracket superfat. I have attached a PDF
showing what I see on screen. The PDF was exported from OOo, so OOo is
exporting the screen view, even though when I print the page from OOo
most of the brackets print OK.

[Edit: Ack, attachment won't go through. Deleted and resending.]

I can open a brand new document and replicate the problems, so it is
not a corrupted document.

At first I blamed OOo 3.0.1, but just now I opened the document in
2.4.1 which is still installed on my Intrepid desktop. The screen view
problems with the brackets are the same. Yet, strangely, when I printed
a page the incorrect parts were different, but fonts were still being
substituted and glyphs were substituted and/or dropped out. 

I just tried the March 26 beta of Jaunty, hoping that the problems
would be resolved and all I would have to do is wait for Jaunty. Sadly
the OOo on Jaunty is the same release that I am using on Intrepid, and
it has exactly the same problems with the document.

At this point my #1 suspect is Gnome. I say that because screen views
are affected as well as printing. But what do I know?

I filed a bug report here:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ttf-junicode/+bug/351080. But
so far none of the Jaunty developers have even looked at it. However,
at least one user from the OOo user e-list has confirmed my findings.

I don't know what to do, but the present situation is not tolerable. I
must have a word processor that works dependably with all the funny
glyphs, tables, frames and stuff that I use. I hate like hell the
thought of ripping out Intrepid and reinstalling Hardy (at least two
days of work to reinstall all my programs, many of which required
tweaks to get them working - tweaks which I don't remember how to do).

I'm to the point where I'm thinking of scrapping the past two weeks of
work and starting over using InDesign on Windows.

I am really not happy.

Why not install VirtualBox and then install  Hardy as a VM, rather than 
scrapping the entire OS?

An FVX 538 is connected, it is connected to the battery backed up
power outlet.  There is no way for a Netgear FVX 538 to take a
signal from a battery back up device.

This is just not my day.

I thought your suggestion was brilliant. I was so upset and frustrated
that I couldn't think of something so simple. And better yet, it would
give me a chance to prove that OOo 2.4.1 on Hardy is trouble free and
would solve my problems. I could leave the decision about reinstalling
Hardy until later.

I already had VirtualBox installed, with Windows 2000 and XP installed
as guest OSs. So I created a new one for Hardy, then inserted the Hardy
live CD. It started to install, then announced that it required a
64-bit CPU. Of course, it was Hardy x86_64. Except that I do have
x86_64 Intrepid and Vitualbox 2.0.4, and 2.0.4 is supposed to handle
64-bit guest OSs. Well, it doesn't.

So off to Sun Microsystems to muck around. I discovered that there have
been improvements to 64-bit support and the current version is 2.1.4.
But 2.1.4 is not currently in the repos. "No prob, I'll just download
the amd64 deb from Sun and install it with gDebi." Hah! Download is
quick, but gDebi announces that it can't install it because it
conflicts with Virtualbox-OSE.

So back to Sun, and I discover that I can add the Sun repo for
Virtualbox. Supposedly that will make the latest version appear in
Synaptic and Update Manager and stuff. Done. But it still does not
appear in Synaptic. OK, back to Sun again. There I find instructions to
just install it with apt-get. OK, did that. But the installation with
apt-get removed Virtualbox-OSE. "No problem, that's the old version
anyway" I think. 

So I try to launch the new Virtualbox. Apt-get failed to install any
new launch menu entries. The old launch entry does nothing - no error
messages, just nada. From the command line "virtualbox" and
"virtualbox-ose" say they can't find the command.

Back to Sun. No instructions for a launch command.

"OK, screwi it" I say to myself. I'll just reinstall Virtualbox-OSE
2.0.4 from Synaptic and use a 32-bit Hardy. Synaptic happily installs
Virtualbox 2.0.4, although it says it must remove 2.1.4 to do so.
Afterwards I click on my launch menu and still nada. Command line still
says no such command for either virtualbox or virtualbox-ose.

So here I sit with no Virtualbox and apparently no way to get it
reinstalled so that it will work.

Bah. Time for that bottle of Canadian.

I discovered these dependencies when installing virtualbox-ose:

fakeroot linux-headers-2.6.27-7 linux-headers-2.6.27-7-generic dkms
virtualbox-ose-source

Perhaps there are some compatibility issues with these other packages 
and the newer 2.1.4?

Just skimmed this thread, and noticed someone having trouble finding
the virtualbox executables. Note that Sun makes the dubious choice of
making the virtualbox commands start with caps. So on the command line
it will be "Virtualbox" if I recall correctly, not "virtualbox". Also,
the "shortcut" is in a different place when using the Sun packages.
The Intrepid packs put them in Accessories, and I think the Sun
packages put it in System Tools.

Hope this helps alleviate some of the frustration! It's not just you,
they made some.... questionable choices.

Forgot to add, I'm using Virtualbox quite happily in Intrepid on my
work machine, I my be able to help you get going more while at the
office tomorrow, if just being able to find the $#%$ executables isn't
enough to get you going.. If my memory of the command name is not
correct, try to V(tab)(tab) trick to see what is suggested. There are
very few commands that start with V, so it should be pretty obvious.

Dear John, 

If you go the VMware route, I recommend VMware Server, the 1.0.x series.
While 2.0 is released, it's a resource hog. The download site for both
versions is http://www.vmware.com/download/server/ .

In either case, while it isn't open source, it's a "free" license which
does not expire.

Thanks,
Mike

It still sounds a lot like a font problem.  It might be something 
involving cups or OOo's treatment of the font.  If you've installed OOo 
2 on intrepid and gotten the same results, I would suspect the system's 
fonts or cups.

IMO, writing a book in OO.org, abiword, kword, Scribus, or even Word,
for that mater is friken' insane.

Please, please, please (re)consider using LaTeX or one of the LaTeX
front ends (eg: KyLyX).  I know that in years past you've rallied
against the idea of using a programming language, but I strongly
encourage you to reconsider.  I won't belabor the benefits of LaTeX,

OK, if the ups has an interface, then plug it into the computer your  
going to put nut on. Unless it's a network interface, then it really  
doesn't matter, as you put the IP in the nut config.

I finally managed to get Virtualbox 2.0.4 reinstalled. I had to do a
complete removal, then a complete removal of the residual package. (Why
does "complete removal" not do a *complete removal*?) Then I did a
reinstall, but it still didn't work. Rinse, repeat, and it worked. I
now have my Virtualbox back. All is back to where it was.

Right now I'm struggling with the most annoying thing about Virtualbox
- getting Guest Additions installed. You can set up shares for your
guest OS so it can see your home folder and whatever you want it to
see, but the shares are not visible to the guest OS until Guest
Additions are installed. And Guest Additions requires an ISO from Sun.
And when you download it, it goes into the Desktop. But Virtualbox
never looks in the Desktop for the ISO and there is no way to tell it
where to look. Gaaah.

Not to worry folx. The Canadian is improving my attitude. I'll get
there.

Well, when I needed to install Guest Additions for XP, I choose it from
the menu.  The ISO mounts and autostarts.  I've not tried with a
non-Windows guest, but I would expect the ISO would be made visible by
the server.  You can also mount the (any) ISO as a CD.

But even when Guest Additions can't be installed, can you share the
folder as either a Unix or Samba share?

The problem I am having is that the Guest Additions ISO must be in the
guest OS's filesystem, specifically either /usr/share/virtualbox/
or /usr/lib/virtualbox/additions/. The installer can't find it anyplace
else.

If the guest OS is windows the ISO can be on a CD if the CD drive is
mounted in the guest OS. Then all you have to do is run the EXE on the
CD drive. But Linux requires the ISO in the above folders. At least, I
think that is correct.

My first problem is that I have the ISO in my home folder. But I did
not at first realize that it was the ISO for installing Guest Additions
for a Windows guest OS. When I tried to copy the ISO off the CD
to /usr/ ... etc... in the Hardy virtual machine all I could see was
various files on the CD, not an ISO. The files were things like
setup.exe - in other words, I had the Windows Guest Addtions.

I have been googling all over trying to find the ISO or whatever is
needed to install Guest Additions when the guest OS is Linux. So far no
luck. And that makes me think my assumptions must be incorrect.

I did install Guest Additions for my two Windows guest OSs using the
same CD. 

Still struggling trying to figure out how to install Guest Additions
when the guest OS is Linux.

Oh, and yes, I could probably just get access to ~/ with a Samba share
but, 1) Samba is buggy and a PITA and, 2) I  may need to run OOo in the
guest OS for quite some time and it would be awesomely easier if the
guest OS can just automount my home folder and, 3) I have never
understood Samba worth a damn and, 4) I really don't need any more
computer challenges right now.

Here's the rub, nut doesn't seem to support the Cyberpower 425VA ups
model CPS425SL.  Even if it does, which driver??? I don't know if I
have the right serial cable, I have a gray one where I'm sure that
the cable that came with it is black.  The APC B cable is different
than the APC C serial cables, so I suspect the wrong cable could be
a problem trying to get signal to/from the Cyberpower unit.

Message-ID: <200903312300.29231.scratchcomputing@gmail.com>

Hi all,

If you're a student interested in Open Source (or know some students), 
now is the time to act to get involved in Google's wonderful Summer of 
Code program.

  http://code.google.com/soc/

Each year, Google offers students the opportunity to spend their summer 
vacation coding rather than flipping burgers.  You propose a project, 
and if selected, you're assigned a mentor and provided with a stipend.  
It is a competitive program to get into, but offers an amazing amount 
of real-world experience and the ability to get seriously involved in 
an open source project of your choosing.

Please help us get the word out to students and remind them that the 
deadline is fast approaching (noon on Friday!)

Thanks,
Eric

P.S.  Many of The Perl Foundation mentors are local to Portland and PSU 
is also participating as a mentor organization.

I gave up on --with-cgi on the old box and used nut on my 
CentOS 5.2 box with cgi support to monitor my second UPS 
via web page.  Works nicely.  I don't need cgi support on 
more than one server.  I ran into something about needing 
to explicitly indicate where libgd is for older versions, 
probably what I ran into.

My gd-devel on my older CentOS 4.3 upgraded to 4.7 box is:
     gd-devel-2.0.28-5.4E.el4_6.1

And on the newer CentOS 5.2 box it is:
     gd-devel-2.0.33-9.4.el5_1.1

Oh, a huge hint to people trying to get NUT to work on 
CentOS is to use both init scripts and only run upsmon 
on a slave box.

Hello,

First- download VirtualBox Guest Additions ISO-
http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/2.1.4/VBoxGuestAdditions_2.1.4.iso

If you aren't running 2.1.4, back up in the directory tree on that site to
find the version you are running.

Next- while your guest OS is running, in the VirtualBox menus above the
guest OS window, go to Device | Mount CD/DVD.
Browse to the downloaded ISO (in your host OS filesystem).
Poof, the CD should mount automagically inside the guest OS.

Inside the CD should be several files, among which are-
VBoxLinuxAdditions-x86.run
VBoxLinuxAdditions-amd64.run

Copy the appropriate version to your HOME (depending on what the GUEST OS is
running not the host, the GUEST OS must be running 64bit to use the 64bit
version), give it execute permissions (chmod 777 for example), and run it
using sudo or directly as root.
You may need to install kernel headers, gcc, and possibly a few other
dependencies.
Once it is done, reboot the guest OS.
