I went through this a few weeks ago for my 2 year old Athlon Thunderbird 
system. I didn't have any problems finding another SDRAM 128MB PC-100 
DIMM. They're quite cheap now if you look around. I wasn't sure if my 
MSI mobo could handle a mix of PC-100/PC-133 so I played it safe and 
got the PC-100 memory.

Success!  Thanks everyone who nudged me in the right direction.  My debian
guru / mentor will kill me for the blunt force, but I'm still working on
debian kernel compiles vs. the rest of the Linux world.  Here's how I got my
new Sun SBUS FastEthernet card to work :

According to the man page for lang (chapter 5) C and POSIX are
interchangable.

So, C means POSIX. (Maybe "Compliant"?)

Also, if the LANG environment variable is NOT set, then it will default
to C.

OK, let's try a different approach- When using the command env LANG=C to run a 
program, for example

env LANG=C gnumeric

is it correct to say, this sets the locale for gnumeric as defined within 
gnumeric's own code? In order to override the system locale? That C = the 
default as coded in the app itself?

Or am I like totally confused? Here are some reference docs I found:

http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html
http://www.ccd.bnl.gov/bcf/cluster/pgi/pgC++_lib/stdlibug/sta_9169.htm

I can firmly and confidently state that env is a bash command. By dang, got 
that much.

Yes, just be sure that both the exising memory and the new memory are
unregisterred.  (This is the most common type, registerred memory is
usually only used in large memory configs of >1GB.)  Registerred PC133
memory will not work in many PC100 motherboards.

You should also buy from someplace that will let you return the memory for
exchange if it doesn't work.  I've had very good luck with Crucial
(http://www.crucial.com).  They also have a large database of
configurations they or their customers have tried.  If you can tell them
the type of PC or motherboard you have, they should be able to tell you
what kind of RAM to use.

yes.  PC-133 memory must pass more stringent (e.g. higher speed)
tests than PC-100.  It will perform just fine at the slower 100MHz
front-side bus speed used by your CPU/mainboard.

Also, when looking for hard-to-find memory, I like to give Memory Time
a call:  http://www.memorytime.com  (they're local).

Sun systems do that.  The MAC address is not actually tied to the
ethernet adapter.  The last 3 bytes of the MAC address are pulled
out of the system-id ROM chip.  (Remember the big hu-hu when Intel
was adding CPU serial numbers to the Pentium?  Sun has been putting
serial numbers on their mainboards since .... 1990(?))

Instead of copying the file, use the bookmark import function.  Your

Richard,

  As I keep relearning, things that _should_ work a certain way in linux
seem to have a mind of their own on my network. I used the import option
when first starting the new version. Bad karma, or something, but nothing
worked until I stood on its toes and forced the new bookmark file to remain.

  Very strange experience; not fun.

Thanks,

Rich

Hmmm... Going to the site, it says this:

<<
A shell (/bin/sh) script to send a message on even weeks might look 
something like this:

-------------
#!/bin/sh

WK=`date +%W`
ON_WK=`expr $WK % 2`

if [ $ON_WK = 1 ]; then
   cat /opt/stats/msgs | mailx -s "stats report" someone at someplace.org
fi
-------------
 >>

Since there's 52 weeks and one extra day (two on leap years), every so 
often we have an odd number of weeks in a year (53 instead of 52). That 
is we'd have two odd weeks in a row every five or six years. It seems 
like the above code would break every few years.

:

I think LANG=en_US has to do with National Language Support in the
application.  LANG=<language>_<territory>, so en_US is the US
localization of English.  An application might use this information in
formatting dates and numbers, for instance, so that Americans will see
their decimal numbers as "2499.99" and europeans would see the same
value displayed as "2499,99".

I don't know what LANG=C would mean in an environment.

  All source code is formatted as C rather than C++, java, perl or cobol.

All-
My Mandrake 7.2 installation has never been a clean one.  As a result, I
have always had to manually insmod 8390, then insmod ne2k-pci, then network
restart after boot.  This is because, during boot, eth0 and eth1 fail
because 8390 is not in place prior to starting the network.  Even though my
proc time averages about 6 months between reboots, I decided I needed to
"fix" things so the machine can reboot and come up working without my
intervention.  Now it's "fixed" alright: just like my dog......
I read that etc/conf.modules would be the file to edit and add my "insmod
8390" statement.  However, my system does not have this file, only a file
etc/modules.conf and another one etc/modules.  My reading lead me to believe
the modules file might contain a list of modules to load during boot.
Therefore, I edited it to contain "8390".  Previously, the file was empty,
with a size of 0.  This change did not seem to affect the machine at all.
Next, I edited etc/rc.d/rc5.d/S10network.  It seemed to be the only family
of files containing anything resembling command prompt-like statements.  So,
I added a line "insmod 8390" on a line a little before the network stuff
starts happening.
During boot, and a little after level 5 starts going, I see a couple error
statements ("something?something?command not found"), then I see a brief
blip about loading lo, then my screen starts rolling with a partial error
message (it looks like something that ends in "[?.true]", thousands of
times.
I rebooted without network support and vi'ed S10network to remove the line
"insmod 8390" (but I left the blank line).  I also edited out the
etc/modules file back to being empty, however I wonder if it really is
empty, since it probably now contains an EOF so it probably is now size 1
instead of 0 like it was (maybe it is not supposed to be a text file?).
Any thoughts?
				Thanks,
				Brian.

Hey Brian,

You should be able to add this line to /etc/modules.conf

	alias eth0 ne2k-pci

and that should be it. When you restart the network (reboot or run
/sbin/service network restart), it should automagically load the 
8390 & ne2k-pci modules.

If that doesn't do the trick, you can force it by adding a couple lines
to rc.local. I'm not sure exactly where rc.local is on Mandrake 7.2, 
probably /etc/rc.local or /etc/rc.d/rc.local

	/sbin/insmod 8390
	/sbin/insmod ne2k-pci

...from the `man' page for modules.conf...

ALTERNATIVE CONFIGURATION FILE
       For  historical  reasons,  if  /etc/modules.conf  does not exist,
       modutils will read /etc/conf.modules instead.  However the use of
       this historical name is deprecated and it should be replaced with
       /etc/modules.conf.  This version of  modutils  issues  a  warning
       message  if /etc/conf.modules exists, later versions will give an
       error message and refuse to load modules.

You can create it as a zero length file by simply...

    cp /dev/null /etc/modules

Sandy

LANG=C does mean language = the C programming language. As several of you 
said. The missing link for me was what the heck does that have to do with 
locale? Well duh, C itself is written in ASCII. So 'env LANG=C' literally 
means 'turn off localization', though the end result is similar to setting 
the locale as American English. Technically, it's not the same as 'env 
LANG=en_US', because that is setting a locale, rather than turning it off. 
But to the beleagured end user who just wants their screen fonts to not look 
bizarre, it's the same.

This is an issue because of the move towards internationalization with 
Unicode. Many legacy apps do not support Unicode, so when they run in a 
Unicode environment like Red Hat 8, interesting glitches appear. Some of them 
go beyond cosmetic, for example if filenames are encoded in in the encoding 
of the locale this creates most interesting complications. (UTF-8 is the 
ASCII-compatible Unicode encoding, found in RH8 and other *nixes.)

Never a dull moment.

Sorry, Carla, but that's incorrect.  Technically, the "C" stands for
"Coconut", and according to m-w.com, it means, "the drupaceous fruit of
the coconut palm whose outer fibrous husk yields coir and whose nut
contains thick edible meat and coconut milk".  Personally, I find it
rather odd to think of this as "meat".  But, alas, I digress.  Anyway,
back to the topic at hand.  As I was saying, the letter "C" rhymes with
"three" and "oh gee", and if you've studied your latin, you'd realize that
this is an ancient riddle that has the potential to unlock vast stores of
gold and myrrh buried deep within the volcanic ashes of an uncharted
island off the coast of Madagascar.  Beware the neoprene!  And with that,
I bid thee ado.

One of the *important* differences between LANG=C and LANG=en_US is
that capitalization matters in the former and not in the latter, that
is LANG=C is in ASCII order, LANG=en_US is in alphabetic order.  Old
timers like me are used to the LANG=C behavior.

So that means that in LANG=C,  "A" is  41h?
What is "A" in LANG=en_US ?

It doesn't matter what code it is, it is only the order that is
important to collating operations.  In other words, for en_US, "A" has
the same value as "a".

Try this little experiment:

  mkdir test
  cd test
  touch a A b B c C

then 

  LANG=C ls -l

then 

  LANG=en_US ls -l

Notice the difference?

Subject: [PLUG] LPRng doesn't work on local printer.
Message-ID: <200211011921.23588.aschlemm@attbi.com>

Well I thought I had printing working with CUPS but one thing I'm
finding painful is the fact that CUPS doesn't support a simple (no
filter) forward to a remote printer queue. One remote printer server I
have to deal runs "apsfilter" and so it's smart enough to know how to
convert PostScript to something the PCL-based HP laser printer connected
to the server can handle.

I tried setting up CUPS to filter and produce the proper output but I
find on the remote printer I then gets an extra one inch of top margin
on every page printed and I also get two empty pages which preceed every 
print job I send from my Linux box.

I removed CUPS and the only other option that SuSE 8.1 offers is the use 
of LPRng. This solved all of my remote problems expect now I can't get 
my locally connected inkjet printer to work at all. I keep seeing the
following messages from "lpr" and my syslog is filled with "connection
refused" errors:

Nov  1 17:41:57 tigger lpd[9643]: connection refused from unknown
Nov  1 17:43:25 tigger lpd[9889]: connection refused from unknown
Nov  1 17:43:37 tigger last message repeated 2 times

Nov  1 17:53:30 tigger lpd[10915]: connection refused from unknown
Nov  1 17:54:33 tigger last message repeated 7 times

When I try to print something to th local printer I get the following
errors from "lpr":

tigger:/usr/sbin # cat /etc/hosts | lpr -Poptra
Status Information:
 sending job 'root at tigger+997' to optra at localhost
 connecting to 'localhost', attempt 1
 connected to 'localhost'
 requesting printer optra at localhost
 job 'root at tigger+997' transfer to optra at localhost failed
  error 'ERROR TRANSFERRING DATA'
  sending str '^Boptra' to optra at localhost
tigger:/usr/sbin #

Can anyone help? I don't see that "lpd" is actively listening to port
515 which is what I used to see when I was using a BSD-style LPD
process. "lpd" is running and I get a completely different error asking 
me to check that "lpd" is running. I'm at wits end as to why any LPRng 
client programs are unable to transfer any data.

Thanks,

Tony

This one is for the archives :-)

 This error can occur on machines with limited memory and swap space.
This error occurred on my firewall which has 16Mb RAM and 32Mb swap
space. The cure is to just create some more swap space with the
following procedure.

   1. cd to /
   2. issue "dd if=/dev/zero of=swapfile bs=1024 count=64000" to create
64Mb of swap, change the count value to suit
   3. format the file as swap space: "mkswap swapfile"
   4. use the swapon command to bring the swap space online: "swapon
swapfile"
   5. "swapon" -s will show you your swap file usage
   6. add a line to your /etc/fstab so that the swap file will be used
upon each booting
   7. proceed on with your rpm transaction remembering that while this
transaction will complete, it will be very slow because of all the
swapping to disk.

I got this partially working if I do the following with "lpr".

cat <some-file> | lpr -Poptra at tigger

This works when I specify the printer and host name. The problem I have 
with alot of my KDE programs is that they run "lpr -Poptra" instead 
which fails since "optra" is converted to "optra at localhost" which for 
some reason doesn't work.

Hello Linux folkz,
Sorry for this posting, but I'm in desperate situation.
May be somebody agrees to exchange four 256MB PC133 ECC 168 pin SDRAM's
on two brand new 512MB PC133 ECC 168 pin SDRAM's.
The reason for exchange, my ASUS P2B-DS mobo doesn't support more than
256MB SDRAM in one slot. 
Please contact me off list if somebody interested in this exchange.
Thank you in advance for understanding.

Alas, no.  I also do not know of any utility to determine this.  You might
be able to tell if you have brand-name RAM from the DIMM part number.  You
probably will not be able to tell from the SDRAM chips themselves.

Odds are if it just came with the PC, it's unregisterred.

The registers on a registered DIMM are external to the SDRAM devices, so
yes, you can visually spot them.  They will typically be oriented parallel
to the edge connector, unlike the SDRAMs, which are typically perpendicular
to the edge connector.  Here's an example from Micron's web site:
http://download.micron.com/pdf/datasheets/modules/SD18C16_32_64x72G_B.pdf

Registered memory is typically used in higher end systems such as servers.
The use of registers to buffer the signals from the SDRAM controller
allows more memory to be installed.  For example, in an unregistered
system, each address line from the controller has to go to every SDRAM.
If you have 4 DIMM slots and 8 SDRAMs per DIMM, that's 32 loads.  Driving
that many loads at 133 MHz is a difficult thing to do.  If those same
4 DIMMs were to use registered DIMMs, there would only be 4 loads on the
address line.  Driving 4 loads at 133 MHz is no problem.

Well, yes and no, for certain meanings of "default".  For an 
internationalized application, there are no hard-coded "defaults" 
(otherwise, it wouldn't be flexible enough to make translations for).  
However, for a newly created application, C is typically the first 
"translation" done--there is, I think, a standard or at least informal 
convention that this locale always exist.

I've never done any actual development with i18n'd applications, so past 
that I can't tell you.  Of course, locales change things other than 
language text strings--it also controls the way numbers and dates are 
formatted in some standard C functions.

Yes and no :)  It is a command, but it's not a bash built-in command, like 
'test' or 'echo'.  It's also not necessary in your example above--'LANG=C 
gnumeric' would have worked just fine.  The only reason I can think of for 
prepending 'env' would be to make it portable to other shells--my example 
wouldn't work in csh but yours would.  But now I'm OT. 

Hm, maybe this from POSIX/The Single Unix Specification v2 will be 
enlightening (and then again, maybe not :):

  POSIX Locale
  All systems provide a POSIX locale, also known as the C locale. The   
  behaviour of standard utilities and functions in the POSIX locale is as if 
  the locale was defined via the localedef utility with input data from the   
  POSIX locale tables in Locale Definition .

  The tables in Locale Definition describe the characteristics and behaviour 
  of the POSIX locale for data consisting entirely of characters from the 
  portable character set and the control character set. For other 
  characters, the behaviour is unspecified. For C-language programs, the 
  POSIX locale is the default locale when the setlocale() function is not 
  called.

  The POSIX locale can be specified by assigning to the appropriate 
  environment variables the values C or POSIX.

  All implementations define a locale as the default locale, to be invoked 
  when no environment variables are set, or set to the empty string. This 
  default locale can be the POSIX locale or any other, 
  implementation-dependent locale. Some implementations may provide 
  facilities for local installation administrators to set the default 
  locale, customising it for each location. This specification set does not 
  require such a facility. 

If you don't want to go through the mess of getting a downloadable copy of 
SUSv2 from http://www.opengroup.org, you might also look at the glibc info 
pages.

And, as I'm sure you know, you can compromise between the two with:

LANG=en_US
LC_COLLATE=C 

Of course, you could set 'LANG=C' to begin with, but then you wouldn't be 
able to display high-bit Latin-1 characters, so you couldn't write things 
like "G?tterd?merung" or "beim Ma?" or even "el Ni?o".

Thanks Wil. Great information. 

The theme of the current Linux Journal is internationalization. The article 
about India is quite interesting; it's a mess. There are no common standards, 
software vendors try to lock customers in with a particular character set 
that competing products cannot read. There aren't even universal fonts for 
email and Web pages.

Message-ID: <1036275526.3038.4.camel@laptop>

Hey,

I wanted to look through the archives today for a question I had with
rpmfind and I was wondering if there was any way to search the
archives?  I poked around pdxlinux.org and I was only able to look
through each month sorted by thread,date,author,etc... Other then
downloading the entire archive (~34m) and searching it myself, I
couldn't find anything... 

Thanks

PS my rpmfind question was: I get this error:
rpmFetchDistribList: failed to grab distrib list
URI:http://rpmfind.net/linux/RDF/resources/distribs/metadata.rdf

I tried to go there manually, and the distribs directory doesn't exist
on the server.  Is there some config setting I should be using, or not
using as the case may be... I have rpmfind 1.8

There are searchable archives at plug.skylab.org, although they don't
look up to date.

Well I'm finally ready to completely the cord that is
Wintel. I've been successfully running RH on an old
notebook for my classwork but have continued to run
Win98 on my desktop at home.

Last night, my much less technically savvy significant
other naively opened a file from an email. Short story
I was completely hit hard by something. I had to
rebuild (mostly unsuccessfully) this morning.  The
irony was that it occurred on the day that the court
announces that Microsoft can run rampant.

So, I'm willing to try RH at home. However, I need
equivalents in the linux/gnu world of the multimedia
options that windows offered. Specifically I need the
same/equivalent of the following:
  winamp (for listening to streaming radio, ie
radioparadise)
  realplayer (for video; do they make one for
linux/gnu?)

Also, admitting that we still live in a wintel
dominated world, what linux/gnu-based web browser
handles the latest web tricks (flash, etc) the best?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Mozilla is your best bet, there are flash plugins for it. Galeon's
another popular one (http://galeon.sourceforge.net)

Jim,

   Don't know. We don't use the computer for these. Others do and will
advise you well.

  We use both mozilla and opera. There are only a few sites that are so
Microsofted that I cannot get a page from them. So I don't. The sites that
have all the eye candy opening stuff almost always have a link to bypass it
and that's what I use. So, these two do the job for me. Why two?

  Mozilla is set up with cookies and java off. Opera is set up with them on
and reports itself as Internet Exploder 5. When a site insists on cookies, I
just switch to the opera desktop and go on from there. Works for us, YMMV.

Well it looks like I was fighting a "tcpwrappers" problem and that is 
why I couldn't connect to "lpd" when I didn't use a 
-P<printer>@<hostname> agument. It looks like there might be a bug in 
"lpr" as it appears to use a hostname of "unknown" when no hostname is 
specified with the "-P" argument even through it spits out the name 
"localhost" all over the place in the debug messages.

I added the following to my /etc/hosts.allow file and I'm glad my 
workstation sits behind a firewall as I don't like specifing "UNKNOWN" 
here to make things work:

lpd : 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0 LOCAL UNKNOWN : ALLOW

It's a rather glaring bug IMHO but things at least work for me now:

tigger:/etc # pr -f /etc/hosts | lpr -Poptra -V
LPRng-3.8.12, Copyright 1988-2002 Patrick Powell, <papowell at lprng.com>

And the syslog messages confirm this behavior:

Real Player has a unix version.  I have it installed on a Red Hat 7.3
box and it works great.  There is a program called XMMS that comes with
RedHat 7.3.  Looks exactly like WinAmp.

I recently upgraded by Mozilla browser's flash plugin. The readme that
comes with the software (fount at www.flash.com or www.macromedia.com)
is made for Netscape, but replace the word netscape with the directory
your mozilla is installed it and the installation works great.  The PLUG
list was a great resource when I did that little exercise.

I've found only one website that I can't display the home page and that
is StarTrek.com.  They insist you need flash 6 which is not available
for Linux.  Also some pictures, when viewed by themselves (like clicking
on a picutre in a gallery) don't display because mozilla says the
picture is corrupted but it displays fine on IE.

I generally use Mozilla with a lot of success.  It does take longer to
load then Opera, but it has expanded capabilities than Opera.  Opera is
nice for wanting a quick look at a website.  Never had a problem with
cookies at any website.

Hope this helps.

Eric & Sandy-
Thanks to both of you for helping me learn enough to get through this.  I am
back up and running, and I was successful in getting my machine to load the
modules when it boots, without my intervention.  This fixes a minor problem,
but one that has been bugging me for six months.  It feels good to
understand a little more about the in's and out's of this module thing and
the booting process in general.

Thanks Again,
Brian.

Ditto to what everyone else said, but

www.codeweavers.com will sell you a plugin that will allow you to run 
shockwave, flash 6, quicktime, winders media player all in 
mozilla/galeon/konqueror.  $24.95.  This is the best money I have spent on 
linux software in a long time.

What you are seeing is normal for unzip. 

What you are telling unzip is to extract all those files (Aqua.zip,
BruchedMetal_Xmms.zip, etc.) from the file Apple_Platinum_Amp.zip. Those
files don't exist inside the zip file, so it doesn't create anything. 

xmms seems to be able to handle the files in a zipped state anyway.
That's all I have in my .../Skins/ directory. When I browse skins,
they're all listed.

I find this interesting since Microsoft got off with a simple slap on 
the wrist and will continue to enjoy a monopoly here in the U.S. for 
many years to come. I guess I might be worried but Linux has gotten a 
lot of good press coverage over the last few years and so it's not some 
obscure little Unix-like OS that was started by some guy from Finland 
that nobody has ever heard of now. :-)

"Steal" market share?!? In the process of switching to Linux myself,
it's been my experience that you *earn* every bit of market share
you take back from Microsoft. And "tidalwave" is seems a bit
exaggerated; "rising tide" is more like it. And as everyone knows, a
rising tide floats all boats.

I have been able to use just zipped skins in the past...but what about
using a tar.gz file from the xmms downloads site? I untarred... the
file...it created a folder in my Skins folder...and it shows in the
SkinBrowser, but when I select the skin it goes to the default skin.

any thoughts?

Absolutely!  They got it from embracing the notion thats competition is
superior to cooperation, all human interaction is best described (and,
indeed, optimized) in terms of a market, and that profits are a right
granted to those who endeavor in entreprenuerialism.

>From there, it's just a short leap to recognizing that profits are
exploitation and the most exploitation yields the most profits.

They're just doing their job as good little capitalists in making public
life a baffling ordeal so that private property is expanded and
consolidated into the hands of the very few.

Surely you can't disagree with that.  You're an American, aren't you?

United We Stand and all that...

"better" is entirely subjective - and a function of your requirements. FWIW,
I've got no complaints about Bulkregister.com.

How can I get a quick and dirty comparision between an AMD

I know that there's a million factors, but I'd like to 
extrapolate a capacity. I've got figures for the K6-2 300, 
but since I can't buy that new very easily without going to a 
retail store (:P), I'd like to compare the figures I have to 
newer hardware.

If somebody knows that the P4 is 3 times more powerful, that 
would do it for me.

I use a pine/fetchmail combo to retrieve and read my attbi.com mail. 
In ~/.fetchmailrc, I've got

poll mail.attbi.com proto pop3
        user "heinlein", with password "SeCrEt", is "heinlein" here,
        ssl,
        sslfingerprint "1D:E5:D5:34:FE:9C:B0:00:9C:5E:12:0F:79:0E:34:7D"

In ~/.pinerc, I've defined a role for my attbi.com account:

patterns-roles=LIT:pattern="/NICK=home/FLDTYPE=EMAIL" 
  action="/ROLE=1/FROM=Paul Heinlein <heinlein at attbi.com>/
  LSIG=--Paul Heinlein <heinlein at attbi.com>\\n/RTYPE=YES/

This is all on one line in .pinerc; I've broken it over multiple lines
for the sake of readability. You probably ought to create yours using
Main -> Setup -> Rules -> Roles.

I've got a corrupted rpm database on a RH 7.3 system, so:
#rpm -rebuilddb

It runs for a while, but instead of finishing, I get:
Seegmentation fault

Why is this? I cannot install packages on the new system and 
it's causing me delays on my project. Waaaah.

Since the switch from @Home to ATTBI, you can forward from attbi.com
to the address of your choice.  Go to:

  <https://memberservices.attbi.com/msws/MemberServices>

or equivalent and "email settings".  Of course, this assumes that you
have somewhere more convenient to forward too, but I'll irresponsibly
assume the reference to Sendmail is a positive indication.

I assume you mean 'rpm --rebuilddb' (with two hyphens, not just one).

The best thing to do is wrap rpm in strace so you can figure out which 
system call is the one causing it to hang:

# strace -o /tmp/rpmcrash.txt rpm --rebuilddb

You might also consider verifying the db files to see if you can spot 
the error:

# db3_verify /var/lib/rpm/*

You can get the demo version of CrossOver at 
http://www.codeweavers.com

Then install the plug-ins for Real Player, Quicktime,
even Windows Media player, etc.

I edited the .pinerc file with all of my account info. I downloaded and installed fetchmail, but don't seem to have a .fetchmailrc file located in my home directory. I ran a locate before and after the installation and still no results. Is this a file that I need to create, or should it be invoked when I installed fetchmail.

I know this is not the answer to the question but it is related. If you like XMMS skins try the K-Jofol plugin. You can get a link off of http://www.xmms.org under the visualization plugins. Or if you use Debian it is in testing as a deb. These skins are *much* cooler than anything you will find for XMMS/Winamp.

I've made a /usr/share/xmms/SKINS directory. I've unzipped various skins 
to that directory. This is all per ;

   "mkdir /usr/share/xmms/Skins" <upper-case "S" on "Skins"
4) Download skin.zip to "/home" or right to "/usr/share/xmms/Skins"
5) if you DL'd to /home, then "cp *.zip /usr/share/xmms/Skins"
6) "unzip /usr/share/xmms/Skins/*.zip"
(This should give you a folder for each skin you DL'd)
7) Launch XMMS, and pick your skin!

  It's a diy file (Do It Yourself).

  The locate command works off the 'whereis' command and is updated daily
(if the machine's on all the time) or when you tell it to update the
database. Running it immediately after installing an application will not
help you. Try 'which fetchmail' and it will show you where the executable
has been installed.

  Follow Paul's model for .fetchmailrc and modify it to your situation.

I've used them as well and they're good, but bare-bones.  You'll need to
find someone to actually host your DNS entries.  I like zoneedit since
they're free.  Set your support expectations accordingly.

I have had horrible luck with register.com.  It was so bad that I couldn't
even pay them to renew my domains.  You'd think this would be one thing a
company would like to get right.  But they didn't.

How is 'locate' related to whereis? I thought whereis searched a generic
list of directories, and locate used a special database.

1. which - searches PATH
2. whereis - searches generic list
3. locate - searches locatedb

How is 'locate' related to whereis? I thought whereis searched a generic
list of directories, and locate used a special database.

1. which - searches PATH
2. whereis - searches generic list
3. locate - searches locatedb

Tyler,

  You're probably absolutely correct. I thought that the locatedb was built
using the whereis command. Ergo, they were equivalent. Apparently my
thoughts were incorrect.

Mea culpa!

  I believe that some of you are using gnucash. I've just started with it
(after a long hiatus) and I must be doing things incorrectly because
entering a single transaction is painfully slow and requires the trackball
more than the keyboard. I'd like to learn what I'm doing wrong.

  We can do this off the list if that's more appropriate.

Message-ID: <20021105005552.GC10509@sthelens.dimstar.net>

I've been beating my head against the wall for two weeks now. 

I'm assuming I've been trying to make this too hard. 

I've tried to install the java plug-in using the instructions here:
http://mazinger.technisys.com.ar/pruebas-nick/mozilla/

I've also downloaded the JDK and/or the JRE from Sun for Java2 1.4.1.
I tried a link to libjavaplugin_jni.so in the
/usr/lib/mozilla-1.1/plugins directory, and I've tried copying that file
to that directory. 

In all cases, when I make changes, I go to about:plugins in mozilla, and
it only lists plugger and the default plug-in. 

I've gone through and ln -s all the files needed by the plugin mentioned
above. So when I run ldd on the plugin, it finds everything. 

Still no joy. 

Any ideas out there?

Learn to use the tab key to navigate when entering transactions. It 
makes pretty good guesses at what you want to enter and really speeds 
things up. Also, use the "+" when entering a check numbers. It 
automatically increments from the most recently entered number.

Those are all the gnucash speed tricks I know.

Terry,

  Thanks a lot. I was using the tab key, but in the transfer dialog box. I
learned from someone else that it's faster to just enter transactions on the
bottom line of the register. Despite reading the manual I didn't pick up on
all this. The plus key is particularly handy.

I use gnucash (only for checking).  Speed seems to be no problem for me,
except registering the transaction.  When I press enter, it takes a
second to go to the next line.  Other than that no problems.  What are
you using the trackball for?

By this logic, I must be ecstatic with my service from Verisign.

LO *thump* L

*ouch*  I hate it when I fall out of my chair laughing.

Verisign has really shitty service because they've figured out that most 
people are suckers who will pay $70 (or whatever it is they charge) for 
"expedited" service.  Actually, most people don't have a choice because 
of the damage that will be caused if the can't update their records, etc.

In contrast, the $10/year folks have figured out that there's really not 
much cost associated with maintaining these records if the forms are 
good enough for most people to take care of things themselves.  Whois 
servers aren't hit *that* hard, so if you could put, oh, 20,000 records 
on a single box that's still $200,000 year for hardware, power, 
bandwidth and a person or two...

But even that analysis is bogus.  There's only a handful of true 
registrars, most of them are resellers who buy in bulk.  They may only 
pay a few bucks per domain per year, and essentially no one-time charges 
to set up the domain beyond the cost of running a server.  As long as 
they can minimize customer service calls, they make a nice profit.

Here's an odd question for you.  Are you running Gentoo 1.4?  Or any
other system compiled on gcc3.2?  All the java's I've seen compiled were
compiled using gcc2.95, and since java uses C++ and bianary
incompatabilitys abound...Well, you see what I'm talking about I hope.

Anyways, this might explain it.
Also, you might want to start up using galeon, on the command line, as
it gives slightly more verbose info about plugin loading, Mozilla trys
to hide problems...

Robbert,

  Doing date entry incorrectly. I was selecting the "transfer" button for
each transaction and filling in the dialog box. SLOW! Boring! Turns out the
slick way is to enter the transaction on the bottom line of the register.
Then the software remembers what you entered before and it's _much_ faster.

  Of course, they have the debits and credits in reverse order of every
other accounting package, but ... one adjusts after a bit.

Thanks,

Rich -- the happy camper now.

That it might... I have Mandrake Linux, and gcc reports 3.2...

Hmm, I don't have galeon.. Something about requiring kde or gnome... I
don't have either of those. 

Thanks for the pointer... I wonder if there's a solution.. Does anyone
make a static linked java?

Anybody here got any tips on upgrading a Yopy 1000 Linux palmtop? I'm
trying to help out a friend, but I'm having a heck of a time getting
into the boot mode so I can flash it with a custom image. Following
the docs is not working for me. Supposedly you attach a serial
console, and reboot while holding down a key to get into the custom
bootloader prompt, but no luck. Sure is cool though, gotta be one of
the faster Linux boots I've ever seen. I'll bring it along to the
next PLUG if anyone wants to check it out.

This guy has some decent pictures:

Apparently, in release 8.0 they removed the Taiwanese flag in some 
internalization config so as not to upset China who are perceived as a major 
potential customer.

As a Red Hat user, for no particular reason, I find this deeply unsettling. 
  Perhaps Jeme will chime in and this time he might make sense :)

  Yes. Both data and transaction number. As long as they are the grey keys

I think you got it wrong. Not f**f flags, but
f**k whoreism. They are being a whore to china.

Actualy, I saw something better than f**k**g a flag.

I was at a talent show last winter. One of the
participants actualy took a certain country's
flag (the one we live in), put it on the floor
of the stage, and then proceeded to go to the
bathroom on it.

May be so, however John would not have been admitted into the gathering
where this talent show took place. It's too spiritual for him.

There are some settings for "use encryption" down in the depths of a
particular connection.  But as is normal in an Apple product, I can't
seem to make out what they do from a technical perspective... just
a marketspeak perspective.

I typed "encrypted mail" into the AppleCare Sherlock, and the
first hit talks about CRAM-MD5.

Ahh, but another link further down talks about

   Mac OS X Mail: About Secure Email Communications (SSL)

That seems to imply that it attempts a IMAPS or POPS connection
in preference to an IMAP or POP connection, *unless* you disable
the magic box.

Does that help?

Hello all. I'm new to the list, so I'll start by saying "Hi everybody!"

My problems is this: I have Samba shares set up on Linux servers
(RedHat 8.0, 7.1, etc), and some NT4 servers. Windows computers can
access them correctly, and can read, write and delete. I want my Linux
workstations to be able to access them, but I can only mount them if
I'm root. The problem is that since root mounted them, I have limited
access as a normal user.  I can read files, and even edit them, but I
cannot create files or copy files to these shares. I have full access
when I "su" to root, but that's inconvenient.

How do I mount them such that any user on the workstation can have full
access to them? I'm thinking of maybe using the "sudo" command, but it
seems pretty complicated. Is there an easier way?

Define "More PowerFUL"..

What type motherboard are you running on?

What type memory ..   SDRAM  DDR    30 pin simms

I still use 30 pin simms where possible. (I get a good buy on them)

Do you have a motherboard that will accept either of
these two CPU's??  Either/Or??

You should be able to mount SAMBA shares as a normal user using the
smbmount command (smbumount to un-mount the share).

This depends on how your shares are set up, user level or share level. 
Also, what do you mean by "full access".  Having a single user be able
to read and write to his/her home directory is very different from any
user being able to read and write to any other users home directory.

In any case "sudo" is not needed (or recommended, you would still have
users with root privileges to the file system).

I've been in the situation of sharing files with both Windows and Linux 
clients and use Samba for the Windows systems and NFS for the 
Unix/Linux clients. You can mount Samba shares to Linux systems using 
"smbmount" if want to to SMB rather than NFS.

I tried using smbmount, but got the following error message:

$ smbmount //patsy/web /home/scott/web-patsy -o
username=scott,password=mypassword

smbmnt must be installed suid root for direct user mounts (500,500)
smbmnt failed: 1

I have Samba running on both machines (server and client) and can mount
them as root with:

$ mount -t smbfs -o username=scott,password=mypassword

But the above method can only be run as root, and causes me the
problems I mentioned.

System: both running RedHat 8.0, samba-2.2.5-10.

Derek,

My shares were created by modifying the defaults in smb.conf. I have
home directories only accessible by the user that owns it, and I have a
public "transfer" directory that is full read/write access by anyone
with a valid sambapasswd account.

Matt,

I just tried that, now I get the following error:

smbmount //patsy/web /home/scott/web-patsy -o username=scott%mypassword

libsmb based programs must *NOT* be setuid root.
21189: Connection to patsy failed
SMB connection failed

If it's talking about this file: /usr/lib/vfs/modules/libsmb.so, the
rights are already set to 755.

Message-ID: <20021105182930.A30936@defiant.ncplus.net>

This may look familiar from a thread last month, but there are
changes:

network looks like this:

  |----defiant---modem   <--- used to get email on laptop when off-net
  |
  |----auger             <--- dev workstation
  |
  |----dax---modem       <--- used for GUI access, desire _all_ access
  |
 hub(10/100 switch --- all devices have 10/100 nic's)

dax has squid running, and ppp configured for demand and persist.
defiant can cause dax to dial, and can see the world thru dax. auger
can cause dax to dial, and can see the world thru konqueror only. dax
can see the world just fine thru it's modem. defiant can dial thru it's
own modem, and see the world just fine; but this access in now only
used when I'm not connected to the local net. defiant has no GUI. I haven't
figgered out how to get lynx to do proxy, but seems to work just fine.
auger sees thru konqueror because the browswer understands proxy. port
forwarding is enabled on all systems (/proc/.../ip_forward == 1).

iptables on defiant (using iptables -t nat -nL):

Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         

Chain POSTROUTING (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         

iptables on auger:

Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         

Chain POSTROUTING (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         

iptables on dax:

Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         

Chain POSTROUTING (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         
MASQUERADE  all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0          

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         

After I got this all working last month, dax locked up for some
unknown reason. I had to reboot it, and restart squid, etc. Running
thru the thread from last time, I created this script, which got
everything happy again:
_______________________
#! /bin/bash

# This shuts down the default ipchains, and sets up the correct iptables

echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

rmmod ipchains ip_tables iptable_filter ip_nat_irc ip_nat_ftp ip_table_nat

modprobe ip_tables iptable_filter ip_nat_irc ip_nat_ftp iptable_nat

iptables -F -t filter
iptables -F -t nat
iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT -t filter
iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT -t filter
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT -t filter
iptables -P POSTROUTING ACCEPT -t nat
iptables -P PREROUTING ACCEPT -t nat
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT -t nat

iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ppp+ -j MASQUERADE

iptables -t nat -nL

echo run pppDial now
_______________________

Then, I needed to scan a doc, and discovered that the device wasn't on
when I booted auger; and to get the scsi device visible, I had to
reboot auger (AARRGGHH!).

So, I did. Now I can't get auger to work outside the browser. Defiant
works just fine, and everything I did for defiant as a result of last
months thread, I duplicated on Auger, and it was working fine until I
rebooted. I'm almost afraid to reboot Defiant right now.... And I was
considering doing just that for a completely different task last week.

So, what am I missing?

TIA,
-bk

Sounds like you didn't change permissions on the right program.  Change
them to 4755 for smbmnt, not smbmount (it's silly, yes, I know).

There are a ton of issues involved in this issue. Here are but a few:

NFS
- uses basic Unix "user, group, world" file-permission model
- exports to hosts, not users
- uids/gids can be shared via NIS or distributed passwd file
- no widespread standard concerning ACLs
- RPC-based, so difficult to tunnel except via omnibus VPN solutions


SMB/CIFS
- can be tunnelled reliably via ssh
- authentication is user- not host-based, but isn't tied as tightly
  into standard Unix auth data sources (NIS, passwd, ...); often, SMB
  auth is handled by a Windows domain controller or a secondary 
  password map
- ordinarily, permissions look "odd" from normal Unix shell commands, 
  but can be made to work with NT-style ACLs if sufficiently tweaked

It's really not that great...  It's a little dated.  If anything, it's an
interesting background into Stallman starting the GNU project.  And it
ends on a rather sour note, with all the high-flying Linux stocks crashing
down, which some may take as meaning that Linux has failed, which it
obviously hasn't.

I did come across this article that describes doing encrypted NFS using 
OpenSSH. I've never had the need to use something like this but here's 
the URL to the article:

The guys at the Clinton are just fantastic.

They're new schedule is in this week's Mercury.  The high points, to me,
are RevOS and Bartleby.  But there's lots of good stuff coming through
there.  Pay special attention to the special shows put together from the
Clinton's own film archives.  Brilliant stuff.

I work at home a couple days a week, at the office the other three. 
Normally, I run pine locally and use its IMAP/SSL capabilities to poll 
for mail at the place I'm not.

Today, however, I've been running pine remotely via an ssh session. 
My ~/.pinerc files are pretty consistent wherever I am, so after a 
while I forgot that pine was running on a machine 25 miles from my 
workstation.

A couple times, I used pine's 'launch browser' function to view a URL 
that someone had put in a message (like the funny MS Nmap one :-).

Odd, I thought. Why is there a slight delay while mozilla pops up? 
It's usually much snappier than that.

Then it hit me: mozilla was running on my computer at work, and the 
bits were being shipped via an ssh tunnel.

And it just worked.

Greetings, 

I am looking for advice for a 802.11 network card for my Linux notebook.  Any 
particular models that are favored over others?  Does anyone have a home 
wireless network and would recommend hardware/software to set up a node?  I 
was just over at www.personaltelco.net and Portland seems to have quite a few 
access points.  (I work from home, so I am itching to get out of the house 
while being able to work and not necessarily sit in a Starbucks all 
afternoon...)

Thanks

The netgear seems to be pretty good. Just hope it is not based on the 
GlobalSunTech equiptment.

        Accesspoints disclose wep keys, password and mac filter

Date
----
        2002-11-01


Description:
------------

GlobalSunTech develops Wireless Access Points for OEM customers like
Linksys, D-Link and others. Capturing the traffic of a WISECOM GL2422AP-0T
during the setup phase showed a security problem.

Sending a broadcast packet to UDP port 27155 containing the string
"gstsearch" causes the accesspoint to return wep keys, mac filter and
admin password. This happens on the WLAN Side and on the LAN Side.


Systems Affected
----------------
        Vulnerable, tested, OEM Version from GlobalSunTech:
                WISECOM GL2422AP-0T

        Possibly vulnerable, not tested, OEM Version from GlobalSunTech:
                D-Link DWL-900AP+ B1 version 2.1 and 2.2
                ALLOY GL-2422AP-S
                EUSSO GL2422-AP

Yeah, but "worked" tends to be a little on the _slow_ side.  What is
even better is to be running your usenet/email software remotely,
browse-url, and have it come up on your local browser... via the magic
of CCI.  I've mentioned this a few times in the past.

I followed the link (despite the fact that it's supposedly a 
little "_slow_" :-), but couldn't immediately make sense of it.

Is this something that needs to be specially built into an app like 
pine, or is it an add-on?

I went with the older ( not the new double speed ) USR cards because of price.
Each card had a $30 rebate. I got a PLX based PCI card and a pcmcia card. I
installed the PCI PLX card in my Linux firewall and run the laptop and firewall
in ad-hoc.  I have not been able to use WEP on the PCI PLX card when using the
wlan-ng PLX module in this setup. 

There is no AP in this setup. I use IP-SEC to tunnel between laptop and
firewall to get access to the local printer and Internet. It would be nice to
have another ethernet interface to be able to the printer on its own network. I
am  using the wireless as the DMZ in the firewall with only DHCP isakmo and
port 50 open. The firewall is serving as the internal DNS, SMTP, POP and DHCP
server. I want to setup squid on the firewall, but haven't got port forwarding
figured out. I want all port 80 and ftp traffic to be tranparently sent through
squid.	I'm using djb tools for SMTP, POP and DNS. All three boxes, less the
printer are using an host based firewall on their interfaces, so I'm not just
relying on the firewall for protection.

I installed the Linux AP modules ( http://hostap.epitest.fi/ ) for the PCI PLX
card and it was able to work in AP mode as well. I didn't go this route as I
had to use bridging to pass data. The box I using it in only has three PCI
slots. I'm using two for ethernet, local network, Cable modem, and the wireless
card. I was thinking about trying to bridge to a local interface and then route
from there, but I was getting pressure from my wife to stablize things so that
she could do her thing. 

Thank you
Russell

Good question.  I'm an Emacs/Gnus user and for me it Just Works^TM and
has for years and years on Mosaic, Netscape and Mozilla.  The one
caveat being that your local browser has to be open already.  I don't
know if Pine has the feature built in or not, or even for certain that
it is using CCI.  According to the lisp/net/browse-url.el (e.g. for
GNU Emacs 21.2) it is possible the feature is using another interface.
See:

  <http://www.netscape.com/newsref/std/x-remote.html>

All I know for sure is that it works! ;-)

Or you could just use gnome-terminal and your mouse. :)

I've used both Cisco and Netgear pcmcia cards without issue under linux.  If your interested in war driving the ORiNOCO cards seem to have the best application support.

Caught me by surprise too, first time it happened.  I still haven't 
decided if it is a good or bad thing.  It can be annoying though when 
going through four ssh hops.  Just a tad slow.

Looking a little more closely, it seems Emacs is just launching:

  mozilla -remote 'openURL(http://www.any-url.org/,new-window)'

with or without the "new-window" part.  If you can tell pine how to
open URL's, then maybe you can mutate it appropriately.  Looks like
Pine supports this.  c.f.:

String Parsing in C...YICK.  I would sugest finding a better tool.  If
you are absolutely stuck with using C, and refuse to see if yacc works
in Windows, you can check the regex library in C /usr/include/regex.h

(Haven't done any regex in C, so I don't have a program for you to look
at.)

That's how I set up pine to operate, too:

  url-viewers="/usr/bin/mozilla -remote openurl\(_URL_,new-window\)"

Hmm. Maybe mozilla was running locally, and the delay was caused by 
pine and/or mozilla trying to figure out where "here" was.

I was listening to a conversation about this technology last Monday.  
It seems like a killer document format for scanned archival documents:
DjVu docs of scans are an order of magnitude smaller than PDFs or JPGs
of the same scans.

Here's the relevant FAQ-ish paragraph:

    One of the main technologies behind DjVu is the ability to 
    separate an image into a background layer (i.e., paper texture and
    pictures)  and foreground layer (text and line drawings). 
    Traditional image compression techniques are fine for simple 
    photographs, but they drastically degrade sharp color transitions 
    between adjacent highly contrasted areas - which is why they 
    render type so poorly. By separating the text from the 
    backgrounds, DjVu can keep the text at high resolution (thereby 
    preserving the sharp edges and maximizing legibility), while at 
    the same time compressing the backgrounds and pictures at lower 
    resolution with a wavelet-based compression technique.

Message-ID: <20021107162641.YAJP13074.rwcrmhc51.attbi.com@rwcrwbc70>

I'm setting up a new firewall for our company. I normally use slackware, but I'm
tired of the slackware way :) Luckily, there are many other distributions
available.
I finally decided on RedHat 8.0 (as you can tell from the subject line); nothing
scientific, more of an ease-of installation/support and practice for their
certification exams. 
I'm setting up port forwarding (destination NAT, according to the "Linux 2.4 NAT
HOWTO" written by rusty russell. And towards the end there's a perfect example I
can rewrite to do the NAT the way I want it (a web browser requesting port 80
from the firewall will get port 80 on the "internal" web server).  

Here's my question: 
Do I need to enable routing, so that the firewall knows to do the routing to the
internal network, or is that "covered" under the NAT ?

You need to enable routing:

  /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

Why do you want to do this?  Probably best just to ask for the amount
you want and check the result for error.  If you were _able_ to ask how much
there was accurately, there is no guarantee it would still be there
when you went to allocate it.

I use Pacific Solutions on 52nd & Powell. IMO they be the best.

IN addition to Paul's reply,  note that many of the iptables rule set 
generators out there ensure routing is enabled by setting ip_forward to 1.  
I use a program called fwbuilder extensively and it always includes this 
in the shell script it generates.

There's a place on 82nd Ave near Clackamas Town Center next to Stuff
called PC Club (also one in Tigard on 99W that I know of as well).  I know
a guy that does PC repairs and builds there.  But don't expect Linux

Pacific Solutions gets my vote, too. While I normally roll my own, I had
them build us a server on short notice. They did an awesome job on it and we
are very pleased with the quality of work.

Fair enough. I guess I'll have to 'fess up to the real reason.
I'm trying to find a quick way to find out how much memory a
fairly complex piece of code (that I inherited) is allocating
between two operations (approximately)  Actually, what I'd
like is a variable that tells me how much memory my process
has allocated. I was just going to look at the amount of
memory "left" because I *thought* there was an easy way to
do that. I can arrange for the rest of the system to be
fairly quiet while I run the test. 

How about a call to tell me how much I've allocated?

Given the prevalence of memory allocation/deallocation bugs in C/C++
programs, there are an abundance of memory debugging tools around.
The one I am most familiar with is "electric fence", but I know there
are others.  A quick google turned up this:

  <http://www.fortran-2000.com/ArnaudRecipes/FreeMemoryDB.html>

Maybe one of them will be appropriate for your problem, or lead to
something that is.  These days I write most of my code in Common Lisp
with automatic memory management, so I don't have any fresh experience
chasing these things.

IIRC, there's a function to do this in HPUX called "mallinfo", but you
can't call it until you've already written one block of memory. There's
probably something equivalent in Linux.

I don't think that approach would work in linux-based systems. For
example, see the notes section of the linux malloc manual:

"Linux follows an optimistic  memory  allocation  strategy.
This means that when malloc() returns non-NULL there is no
guarantee that the memory really is available. In case  it
turns  out  that  the system is out of memory, one or more
processes will be killed by the infamous OOM killer."

there isn't, because there's no way to get a meaningful
number for "amount of memory left".

Thanks to all your help, I've got my Samba stuff working smoothly,
however I'd like to run my network script automatically to mount Samba
shares on my workstation.

If I put my script in rc.local, it runs as root, but I want to run it
as a normal user (scott). I tried putting it in .bashrc, but then the
script runs every time I open a terminal window.

Is there a start-up file that runs when you first log in to Linux? Or
is there a way I can have a script in rc.local run start as user
"scott"?

You can always grab it via the /proc interface-- even through an external
progam should you like.

Look at "man proc" for the /proc/[pid]/stat entry.  I think that vsize is
the field you want.

You want the share-mounting script to be run as a user?  You may run in
to problems with that.

Anyway - the way I run a script as a user when I boot up is with su...
for instance, I run SETI at Home as the user 'seti' (in group 'seti' no
less) so I appended su seti /seti/seti.sh to rc.local... seti.sh is the
script which actually starts SETI at Home and runs it for me.

If it is the right way to do things - I don't know... but it works for
me.  :-)

Not sure that will work.  According to the man page, "Not all fields
are meaningful under Linux.  Right now (Linux 2.4) only the fields
ru_utime, ru_stime, ru_minflt, ru_majflt, and ru_nswap are
maintained."  I haven't tested it.  Also, even if the data is
maintained, it might be at too coarse a granularity.  Seems the
interface reports in 1k blocks.  It might be hard to see a memory leak
at that resolution, depending on the leak of course.

Rob,

Thanks, that did the trick. I was hoping it would be something simple
like that.

BTW, I look forward to meeting all of you tonight at PLUG. I'll be the

The other thing you could do if running it from .bashrc is to put a 
simple test in the script to see if the file system(s) are already 
mounted or not. If they are skip over the mount process.

sheesh.  linux sucks :)

ok, sbrk(0) will give you a pointer to the current end of
the data segment in your process, which is probably where
malloc gets new memory from.  this isn't the size of your
process, but you can get meaningful deltas.
    void* old_edata = sbrk (0);
    /* do some stuff */
    void* new_edata = sbrk (0);
    ptrdiff_t diff = new_edata - old_edata;

but if the goal is to detect memory leaks, this isn't all
that useful, because malloc/free doesn't necessarily shrink
the process size ever.

detecting memory leaks is a hard problem.  the best
approaches are: a) program in a way that's provably
non-leaky.  b) use a language where memory leaks can't
happen.

Languages not designed for garbage collectors usually work well with
conservative GCs, like Boehm-Weiser. Even though it's too expensive for
the GC to explicitly tag and deallocate every pointer (for unions
especially) such GCs ensure inaccessible memory remains bounded, something
that rarely happens manually.

IIRC, Boehm-Weiser is the GC used in Mono's .NET runtime. I heard it's
also used in Mozilla, so actual results may vary. ;)

All,

I'm excited to report that I've completed moving my production client to
the new Gentoo Linux 1.4_4rc1 after having tested it on my development
machines.

I have to tell you that I am very pleased with it's flexability, ease of
administration, and it's usability.

You can see for yourself here, as I have posted a few screenshots:

I gotta ask...

Why would you use something OTHER than a floppy distribution for a
firewall?

but if you need more space, just build the software you need (a kernel,
sysvinit, a shell, maybe login, sshd, syslog, ipchains, etc.) and put it
on a CD.  You set everything up with init scripts anyway and your only
disk is read-only.  If you get hacked, just hit the big red button and
you're back to where you started.

I don't understand why people want a hard disk in their firewalls.

I would have to put a vote behind Gentoo at this point as well.  I put 
together a test box and threw quite a few Distributions at it.  Gentoo 
got my vote.  It's not the most intuitive at first and it does take 
forever to get everything bootstrapped and compiled. (If you start from 
stage1 like I did.)  However, it's a really nice distribution, that's 
easy to customize.

Another distro that I have just started looking at is Knoppix.  A very 
cool distro that has everything on a bootable CD.  It's definitly going 
to be my tool chest distro.

I guess ICMP replies could work, but I just need to know when

Here is the problem statement:

A catenary is the curve assumed by a flexible rope which hangs freely
between two fixed points (a uniform gravitational field is
stipulated).  A formula can be given as follows:

  y = A + B cosh (x/B + C)

Given three arbitrary points (x0,y0), (x1,y1), and (x2,y2) on the
curve, solve for A, B and C.

How about mon?

It isn't a graphical widget like you seem to be looking for, but it's a
very slick service monitoring daemon. It can notify by e-mail, alpha
pager, etc. It can do simple pings or, um, more:

Service monitors that come with mon:
ICMP echo (ping), SMTP, Telnet, FTP, NNTP, HTTP, POP-3, IMAP, TCP-based,
services, Disk space, Uptime via Asynchronous SNMP, HP Printers via
SNMP, Processes via SNMP, Network Appliance free space via SNMP,
Network, Appliance quota trees via SNMP, LDAP, DNS, Dial-in terminal,
servers, mSQL and MySQL databases, Network latency, Sun RPC Services,
Foundry chassis, Compaq Presario chassis, Brocade SilkWorm FCAL
switches.

http://www.kernel.org/software/mon/

Probably overkill if you just want to see if a host is up. The plus is
that it doesn't take up _any_ screen real-estate until there is a
problem. Then you get an e-mail or your pager goes off, etc.

Hello Linux folkz,
Could somebody tell me please how to make 
sound work in Vmware in virtual Win98?
The sound device which is connected to Vmware 
on Win98 boot up is /dev/dsp but I can't get any
sound from the inside of Win98.
The sound in Linux which uses ALSA is working though.
Thank you in advance for any help or sources of information.

Unless your sound card supports hardware mixing (denoted by the [4] in
the alsa card matrix), you can only have one thing at a time accessing
the hardware - be it VMWare or a sound server like ESD (often found with
gnome) or Arts (always found with KDE).

VMWare doesn't support sound servers because the developers didn't see
fit to include them with the binary-only setup they have going on.

So - if you're in KDE, kill the arts server... otherwise, look for and
kill esd if it is running.

If you're sure /dev/dsp is free (with alsa on non-hardware mixing chips
it seems to always be free - just delaying everything)... ie; no
software mixers running.. then you can also look at Windoze problems and
VMWare problems... are you sure you hit the install button on the device
so it is listed?  Did you install drivers for the sound chip in Windoze
itself?

I'd follow up to some vmware newsgroups... they host their own news
server and there are some smart people there.

Hi Jeme,

How are you :).... Anyhow... ppl want a harddrive on a firewall maybe
because one want to do iptables logging, network monitor, IDS, and
other statistic collection and trending goodies.. well, you need some

Some of us, depending on our situation, need a firewall that can also 
double as a file and/or print server. Yea it's a bad idea to run 
services on a firewall box but with a carefully crafted firewall rule 
set that restricts access to running services to only systems on the 
local network this is indeed possible. I've done this with all of my 
home firewall boxes for the last 4 1/2 years now with great success.

It's not as difficult as it might sound at least in my case. Whether I'm 
using PPP, or a broadband connection, it's just a matter of blocking 
connections on the external network interface of the firewall. With a 
dialup this is usually the ppp0 interface and with broadband it's 
whatever "ethX" interface the broadband connection is on.

I just figure you should do your logging on a remote host because your
firewall is your first point of contact and likely your first point of
compromise.  If you're logging locally, the logs can be modified, but if
you log to a remote host (or MULTIPLE remote hosts), you reduce the risk
of log tampering by an intruder.

Also, I would put intrusion detection on the systems providing services,
but what sort of intrusion detection is useful on a system with nothing
but read-only filesystem?  The best you could do is log analysis, which
can be done on the remote loghost in the first place.

Statistic collection for the local host can be done on the remote logging
host and statistic collection for remote hosts shouldn't be done on the
firewall because it would require openning more listening ports.

I guess I'm a firewall minimalist.

Howdy!

I've been reading the docs, and I'm just getting more confused with
sed. I want to extract the inet address from "ifconfig ppp0" to patch
into an html doc for upload to my constant web space page.

What to do with the data after it's gathered is relatively easy, I
think; but getting the data is another matter.

  inet addr:192.168.0.177  Bcast:192.168.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0

Turning the above into:

  <A HREF=http://192.160.0.177> Ongoing Work In Progess </A>

is the goal (the IP numbers here are for reference only).

My plan is to paste this line in between the front and back of the
rest of an html doc, and then scp it to it's destination; but only if
the IP number has changed since the previous check.

The docs seem unreasonably complex, or maybe I'm just making it that
way. This seems like the sort of thing that's done often (especially
where broadband is out of reach); so an example of such code ought to
be more readily available?

Any ideas?
TIA!

I needed to do the same thing, got help in the #orlug channel in about a 
minute.  Here's what the cool froods in there came up with:

addrext=`ifconfig eth1 |grep "inet addr" |awk -F":" '{ print $2 }' |awk 
-F " " '{ print $1 }'`

just change 'eth1' to your appropriate interface and you're golden.

You can do it with `sed', Richard...


sed -e '/^### Begin - Control ###$/,/^### End - Control ###$/d' httpd.conf


Redirect stdout from the above to a new file and then mv that to httpd.conf.

Or, if you don't mind loosing your positional params, I love `set`... (Of 
course you could save them first)

#!/bin/bash
   set -- `/sbin/ifconfig ppp0 | grep inet`
   MYIP=${2##addr:}
# Optional
#  MYBCAST=${3##Bcast:}

Hello Sandy,
Thank you very very much.
I have been trying to figure this out all day. I have read the sed
manual over and over and still could not figure it out. For the last
hour I have been looking through the sed mailing list.

Richard,

My pleasure... happy I could help. It so happens I had struggled with that
myself some time ago, so I had the solution at hand. I used it in a procmail
recipe to eliminate the annoying Yahoo! banner from incoming email...

# Yahoo groups mailing lists
:0
* ^Mailing-List.*list.*@yahoogroups\.com
{
        :0ABD fwb 
        * ^-* Yahoo! Groups Sponsor -*~-->$
        | sed -e '/^-* Yahoo! Groups Sponsor -*~-->$/,/^-*~->$/d'
}

cheers,
Sandy

Mike,

Are you sure that's it? Try `up2date-nox -u' and see if that works :-)

cheers,
Sandy

Message-ID: <1036804773.1132.6.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Who uses Ximian Evolution for a groupware package?  I have version 1.0.8
and it won't store my pop3 password very well.  It seems to become
corrupted.  I'm constantly having to retype the password since I get a
message that says that "Error sending password: incorrect password or
account name."  Then it asks me to enter the pop3 password for my
account.  

I'm using this on RH 8

Subject: [PLUG] Dying Hard Drive
Message-ID: <1036816162.22427.3.camel@moochercrew.org>

Well...My computer is dying.  I'm blaming my hard drive, because I'm A)
getting seek errors on it and B) it's not always showing up on boot,
though my CDRom drive is (thus not an IDE problem).  Anyways, the
question is this; This is my second hard drive to die in the past year,
(This one wasn't a replacement, just a second drive), and I'm kinda
getting tired of it.  I was wondering if anybody knew of a company that
made nice long lasting hard drives.  Cost unfortunately is an issue, as
I'm a college student, I'm hoping for around a 40 gig hard drive that
will last a couple of years, for under $100 dollars.  Anybody know a
drive that fits this bill?

I'll detail my Harddrive problems if anybody cares, but I doubt there is
much I can do to save this one, even though it's only 2 years old.

Thank you 
Chris

Let me see if I can summarize the responses I've seen on other lists where this question was asked:

Advisor 1:	"Western digital drives are amazing, but Seagate drives suck."
Advisor 2:	"Seagate drives are amazing, but Western digital drives suck."
Advisor 3:	"Don't be a wuss! Spend the money and buy SCSI."
Advisor 4:	"I've had this IBM drive for all of an hour now, and I'm amazed at how reliable it is."
Advisor 5:	"IBM, Pah! If you want reliability and you don't care about speed buy Samsung."
etc.

All that being said, see if you can find a drive that still has a 3 year warrantee. I hear that the Western digital drives with 8MB buffers still do (even though Western Digital sucks and Fujitsu drives are amazing).

In the last few weeks, both Maxtor and Western Digital dropped their
warranties on their hard drives from 3 year to just 1 year.

IBM drives are still 3 year.

In the last year or two, though, IBM drives have gotten themselves a
reputation of dying easily.

In fact, I'd almost be willing to put money on this - one, if not both,
of the OP's drives were IBM drives.

IBM is being sued for their nice drives' level of quality.

So... I'd stay away from IBM drives... buy anything else, really.  I
haven't heard of anybody else having reliability problems as bad as the
IBM ones do.

Subject: [PLUG] PLUG-org - Call for attendance.
Message-ID: <1036819716.30338.48.camel@bittersweet>

To all interested Ladies and Gentlemen,

I'm cooking up an idea or two regarding evolving towards and instituting
a more formally organized and conventionally business-like PLUG
sub-group.  I think that we need to discuss and draft a constitution and
set of bylaws, for starters.

So, this is a call for attendance on the PLUG-org mailing list, which
you may subscribe to via the usual-interface at
<URL:https://lists.pdxlinux.org/>.

Please announce yourself (role call) as you "arrive" on the list, and
please create a folder for it.  (The low murmur of aspiration prior to
the Calling to Order is acceptable here; formal "attire" and behavior is
most appropriate, but no neckties allowed.)

I would greatly appreciate the attendance and guidance of folks familiar
with corporate boardroom proceedings, etc. along the lines of RROR
(below) and the Debian Constitution.  Please lend a hand and help to get
the ball rolling.  I have no formal training in these matters, and will
require your input.

 Mandatory Reading List - I'm serious.
=======================================

Your reading list should contain foremost this URL, or hard-copy tome:

<URL:http://www.constitution.org/rror/rror--00.htm>

... which you will find a link to at:

[oblistarchive: SUBJECT TO CHANGE: the following is a temporary URL.]

<URL:http://new.pdxlinux.org/resources/>

@Book{robert00:_rules_order_newly_revis,
  author =	 {General Henry M. Robert and Sarah Corbin Robert and Henry
M. Robert III and William J. Evans and Daniel H. Honemann and Thomas J.
Balch},
  title = 	 {Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised},
  publisher = 	 {Perseus Publishing, Cambridge Massachusetts},
  year = 	 2000,
  edition =	 {10th},
  note =	 {http://www.robertsrules.com},
  ISBN =	 {0-7382-0384-X or 0-7382-0307-6},
}

I found a paperback copy at Border's books for $17.00.  It's 11x16x3.5
cm, 704 pages, 10pt, and is thus the perfect size to carry around for
idle loop reading.  It will fit right in your cargo pocket, scouts.

So, let's get after it and start to sketch out our constitution and
bylaws, shall we?

I had this problem.  It seemed to be resolved by making sure to select
"save password" when first setting up the pop3 account.  This seemed to
prevent Evolution from constantly asking me for the password.

Subject: [PLUG] dual-boot install
Message-ID: <3.0.5.32.20021109001750.007e19a0@mail.inetarena.com>

Just attempted to do a dual-boot install of RedHat 7.3 on my Win2k=hda1
computer.  I used Disk Druid to partition my hard drive for the "custom"
install option (/boot=/dev/hda2, /=/dev/hda3, swap=/dev/hda5).  I specified
that LILO should be put in /boot, a necessity to prevent changes to the
NTFS MBR on hda1.

However, also on the bootloader selection screen was a field containing
"hdc=ide-scsi".  I could not figure this out, and there was little or no
information about it in the online help provided by the install.

Part of my dual-boot install scheme was to edit lilo.conf in Linux rescue
mode before the computer did it's first post-install reboot; I was unable
to do this.  Once the last package was installed the CD-ROM tray popped
open and the POST started before I had a chance to react.  The computer
booted based on the lilo.conf file created by the install process.

I was presented with the lilo GUI, and Linux booted just fine.  However,
when I tried to boot into Win2k it was hosed.

Back in Linux, I checked lilo.conf.  Part of it was as follows:

	image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.18-3
		label=linux
		initrd=/boot/initrd-2.4.18-3.img
		read-only
		root=/dev/hda3
		append="hdc=ide-scsi"

Also, in anaconda-ks.cfg was the following:

	bootloader --append hdc=ide-scsi --useLilo

What the heck is 'hdc=ide-scsi'?  Should I have blanked-out that field in
the bootloader selection screen?  I'm going to check Red Hat and Google,
but I would appreciate any input from the PLUG community.

Thanks.

Subject: [PLUG] PLUG-org - Call for attendance.
Message-ID: <1036825030.30338.96.camel@bittersweet>

To all interested Ladies and Gentlemen,

I'm cooking up an idea or two regarding evolving towards and instituting
a more formally organized and conventionally business-like PLUG
sub-group.  I think that we need to discuss and draft a constitution and
set of bylaws, for starters.

So, this is a call for attendance on the PLUG-org mailing list, which
you may subscribe to via the usual-interface at
<URL:https://lists.pdxlinux.org/>.

Please announce yourself (role call) as you "arrive" on the list, and
please create a folder for it.  (The low murmur of aspiration prior to
the Calling to Order is acceptable here; formal "attire" and behavior is
most appropriate, but no neckties allowed.)

I would greatly appreciate the attendance and guidance of folks familiar
with corporate boardroom proceedings, etc. along the lines of RROR
(below) and the Debian Constitution.  Please lend a hand and help to get
the ball rolling.  I have no formal training in these matters, and will
require your input.

 Mandatory Reading List - I'm serious.
=======================================

Your reading list should contain foremost this URL, or hard-copy tome:

<URL:http://www.constitution.org/rror/rror--00.htm>

... which you will find a link to at:

[oblistarchive: SUBJECT TO CHANGE: the following is a temporary URL.]

I found a paperback copy at Border's books for $17.00.  It's 11x16x3.5
cm, 704 pages, 10pt, and is thus the perfect size to carry around for
idle loop reading.  It will fit right in your cargo pocket, scouts.

So, let's get after it and start to sketch out our constitution and
bylaws, shall we?

As for IBM, I've never owned an IBM IDE drive, but my IBM SCSI is, er, 
amazing :-)

As for Fujitsu, it's facing mass recalls of drives:

  http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/54/27109.html

As for WD and Maxtor, I've never had a single failure from either 
manufacturer (though I've only owned ca. 3 drives from either 
company, so it's not a huge sample).

Just a quick question.  What is kjournald?  I have searched the internet

Chris,

  For years -- at least 15 -- I've used Western Digital drives with
excellent results. I've had two drives fail in all that time (one a ST-225,
21M unit). I've also used one Maxtor, but don't have a track record for
them. Anyway, what I learned about the WD drives is that some models are
outstanding, and some are dogs. I avoided buying the dogs.

  As it happens, in the beginning of September I pulled a couple of WD
drives from my main workstation/server and replaced them with a single, much
larger drive. They're not in your capacitiy requirements (one's a 4.3G
drive, the other's 5.1G), but they're available for very reasonable cost.

Robbert,

  From a forensic dissection of the word, it looks like a daemon run by the
kernel to maintain/access or something with a journaling file system.

It's been a long time since I looked at that but I think it's intended to set up SCSI emulation, which is necessary to use cdrecord with an IDE CD burner. Is hdc a burner?

That would make sense.  I was trying to figure out if it had something
to do with KDE, which I have installed but don't run.  What you said
makes sense.

Here's more anecdotal evidence.  All of my IBM SCSI drives are still
spinning, including a couple that are > 5 years old.  I just purchased
another IBM SCSI drive, and they still have a 5 year warranty.  
Of course I paid twice the cost of an IDE drive.

I can add that it's been running on every system I've installed for at least 
the past year and a half, which coincides nicely with the last time one of my 
systems lacked a journaling FS. It's been present with or without KDE 
installed.

Google turned up this for the first link:
http://www.redhat.com/mailing-lists/ext3-users/msg04067.html

"grep -R "kjournald" *" in the 2.4.19 source tree turns up references to it in 
fs/jbd/journal.c (including the definition of a function /named/ kjournald).

tera term is an excellent vt100 emulator.  It's free.

Personally, I don't trust hyperterminal.  The terminal emulation is poor,
and it (or windows) has a propensity to drop characters.

Before you totally blame the hard drive...

Make sure the drive is completly plugged in.  Sometimes if the cable has

Depends when the IBM drive was made.  If it was made before they sold 
their drive works off to Hitachi, they are some of the best drives made.  
If it is after -- well...

I have one drive that has failed from Western Digital in the last couple 
of years.  (Heat related flakitude.)  They have changed their warrenties.  
try and find one with a three year warrenty (8mb buffer) and not the 1 
year.

Maxtor's I don't like because they have tended to have weird IDE 
interactions.  (Not liking other drives, like Seagates.)

As for Seagate, I have not bought one in a while.  The last Seagate SCSI 
drive i had i used to use to heat my apartment. (I wish I was kidding.)

Before replacing the drive, i would make sure it is actually gone bad and 
not a bad cable and/or connection.

  If it referred to a KDE applet, wouldn't it have to start with an

Unpluged the cable, pluged it back in, switch cables with my CDRom

Hello everyone!  Just joined the group and wanted to say Hi!  The line 
append="hdc=ide-scsi" basically tells the kernel to treat your hdc device as 
a scsi device (through emulation).  I'm assuming that hdc is a cdrom device 
because this is one of the entries necessary for using a cd-burner on a linux 
box.  If you look in /dev and do a ls on cdrom, you'll probably find an entry 
simular to: cdrom -> /dev/scd0.  This only affects how linux "views" your 
devices and does not affect your dual boot with Win2k.  As to your dual boot, 
I found that the only way I could get it to work properly was to install 
Win2k then linux and have linux control the boot.  Afterwards, I went into 
lilo and changed the default OS.  Hope that helps.

Subject: [PLUG] Another Drive Related Question
Message-ID: <3DCD8262.29B2EF98@attbi.com>

I have three IDE devices in my RH 7.0 machine. The Primary IDE cable is
connected to a Seagate ST38410A, 8.4 Gb drive and the drive has no
jumper on the master/slave/cable select pins. The Secondary IDE cable is
connected, via the connector in the middle of the cable, to a Seagate
ST340810A, 40 Gb drive, which also has no jumper on the
master/slave/cable select pins. An HP CD-Writer Plus 7200 Series is
connected, via the connector on the end of the cable, and has a jumper
on the master pins.

Do I need to install jumpers on the Seagate drives? This setup has
worked for over a year. Recently, however, when I finally configured the
software necessary to run the CD drive as a burner, I started having
problems with the sound system (Creative Labs model number SB0100 -- OEM
Sound Blaster Live, I think. Got it from ENU). I have no problem
accessing either hard drive. I do have a problem accessing the CD-ROM
drive. When I try to mount a CD, I get the message, 

  mount: the kernel does not recognize /dev/cdrom as a block device
         (maybe 'insmod driver'?)

I'm new to the list, I've been developing an interest in *nix recently and I
picked up a copy of Computer Bits and saw that the local groups included a
Linux user's group.

I'm getting ready to install FreeBSD on a 20 GB partition (I'm going to dual
boot for a bit and see how I like it before I dump a bunch of money on a new
system).  I'm not expecting this to be a multi-user machine at any point.  I
primarily use my computer for watching movies, listening to music, web
browsing, newsgroups, e-mail, web design, and games (thus the dual booting).

What I'm looking for in terms of advice :

1 ) I've read a little bit about the partitioning process, but I'm really
not sure what the best way to go about things is.  Should I just cram
everything into one / partition, or should I break it up into a few, and if
so, does anyone have some good advice on how to partition?

2 ) I use Xnews on my windows machine for news, if anyone is familiar with
both windows and *nix newsreaders, can you recommend a similarly-featured
newsreader?

3 ) I've got a 60 GB FAT32 partition on the same drive which is pretty
exclusively for video/audio storage.  Everything I've read indicates that
there shouldn't be any problems accessing this - is there anything special
I'll need to do to make it available?

4 ) Can anyone recommend a good media player which will handle
MPG/VOB/DivX/AVI?

Anyway, that's probably enough questions for now.  Thanks in advance for any
advice you can provide.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0211091658170.23864-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I've missed an important step in modifying a flock of files with sed and
I'd appreciate receiving a correction to my approach. Here's the situation:

  I have a directory with several dozen .cpp files and I want to change an
'include ' line to reflect the name change to a header file. If I run
	sed 's/mtsptype.hpp/prototype.h/g' *.cpp
the change is made to STDOUT, not written to the file. According to the ORA
'sed & awk' book, there's a flag, w, for writing the results. Up to 10 files
can be open, says the book.

  As I've not used sed in a mass production mode before, I don't know if I
can get the results I want (i.e., change all references to the prototype
header -- probably only referenced once per source file -- and write the
changed file back to disk with the same name) if I change the syntax to
	sed 's/mtsptype.hpp/prototype.h/gw' *.cpp

  Is this the way to do it?

TIA,

Rich

I always split the disk slice up. The FreBSD installer can divide the slice up automatically but you can customize your setup if you do it manually. Optimists may say that modern filesystems and disks are so reliable you should put everything in 1 partition; however, pessimists never put all of their eggs in 1 basket.

/	128MB is all you need
swap	2x-2.5x your RAM is a good rule of thumb.
/tmp	Depends, but on a 20GB slice I'd probably allocate 1GB.
/var	Depends. On a play/workstation 1 or 2 GB. On a mail or database server much larger.
/usr	Most of the rest of the slice.
/home	what you haven't already allocated elswhere.

You'll need to edit /etc/fstab. Something like this:
# Device                Mountpoint      FStype  Options         Dump    Pass#
/dev/ad0s1	        /win            ntfs    ro              0       0
You'll have to customize it to suit your system. I'd copy /etc/fstab to /etc/fstab.bak before making any changes, just in case.

She's awesome.

If you going to dual boot I recommend grub. Figuring it out the first time can be a little hairy but once mastered it makes swapping operating systems much easier.

If you've got an Nvidia based graphics card, you're in luck. Nvidia just released binary drivers for FreeBSD. Now you can play Bzflag at >2fps.

However, "consumer" drives are only supposed to be turned on about 40

A new unit of measure: drive-years.

So a consumer drive is rated (warranty-able) for 6,240 hours? (40*52*3)

If they don't feel comfortable warranty-ing a consumer drive running 24/7 
(which racks up 8,736 hrs/yr) then I guess a one year warranty is great.

I'd be nice if drive manufacturers stood by their MTBF ratings, which are 
around 10,000 hrs IIRC.

Rich,

The `w' command in `sed' *must* be followed by a filename. e.g.

sed 's/foo/bar/gw newfile' oldfile

Unless you want to `cat' the results into one file, this approach is not
going to work for you. e.g.,

sed 's/foo/bar/gw newfile' *.baz

will result in the results all being written to newfile. You could grunt
your way through this in a shell script - or take the elegant Perl
approach...

perl -pi -e 's/mtsptype\.hpp/prototype.h/g' *.cpp

cheers,
Sandy

Something to that effect. I saw a slashdot article on this earlier this
year. Made me pause, because most of the drives in the pc's in the lab I 
manage are IBMs of one size or another.

In my experience, Mplayer seems better with multiple formats than Xine,
but Xine's interface is *a lot* better.  It won't play encrypted DVDs
without some hacking, though.

I use Ogle for DVDing.  The only thing I don't like about ogle is that
it has no progress bar I can use nor any kind of a counter - where you
are is where you think you are.  :-)

And then, after making sure it is doing what you want:

Or a little better (touching only the intended files)

   for i in `grep -l foo *.cpp` ; do sed ...

Note the backticks.  Salt to taste.

Well, there are 3 equations and 3 unknowns so they
are exactly determined, but the nonlinearity seems to
make it hard to solve analytically. However you can get 
a pretty good approximation by looking at the parabola
instead of the catenary.

First let's slightly redefine C so that

0) y =A + B cosh ((x-C)/B)

then use the Taylor's series for cosh(z)
cosh(z) = 1 + z^2/2 + ...

so 0) becomes
   y = A + B[1 + ((x-C)/B)^2/2]
     = A + B + (x-C)^2/2B
     = A + B + x^2/2B - xC/B  + C^2/2B

for the three arbitrary points
 (x0,y0), (x1,y1), and (x2,y2) 
we get the three equations

1) y0 = A + B + x0^2/2B - x0c/B + C^2/2B
2) y1 = A + B + x1^2/2B - x1C/B + C^2/2B
3) y2 = A + B + x2^2/2B - x2C/B + C^2/2B


now subtract 2) -3)
   (y1-y2) = (x1^2/2 -x2^2/2 - Cx1 + Cx2))/B
   B(y1-y2) = (x1^2/2 -x2^2/2 - Cx1 + Cx2))
4) B(y1-y2) = (x1^2/2 -x2^2/2 - C(x1 - x2))

and subtract 2) - 1)
   (y1-y0) = (x1^2/2 -x0^2/2 - Cx1 + Cx0))/B
   B(y1-y0) = (x1^2/2 -x0^2/2 - Cx1 + Cx0))
5) B(y1-y0) = (x1^2/2 -x0^2/2 - C(x1 - x0))

6) B = (x1^2/2 -x0^2/2 - C(x1 - x0))/(y1-y0)

divide 4) by 5) to eliminate B and solve for C
   (y1-y2)/(y1-y0) = (x1^2/2 -x2^2/2 - C(x1 - x2))/(x1^2/2 -x0^2/2 - C(x1 - x0))
   (y1-y2)(x1^2/2 -x0^2/2 - C(x1 - x0)) = (y1-y0)(x1^2/2 -x2^2/2 - C(x1 - x2))
   C(x1-x2)(y1-y0) - C(x1-x0)(y1-y2) = (y1-y0)(x1^2/2 -x2^2/2) - (y1-y2)(x1^2/2 -x0^2/2)

7) C =  (y1-y0)(x1^2/2 -x2^2/2) - (y1-y2)(x1^2/2 -x0^2/2)/((x1-x2)(y1-y0)-(x1-x0)(y1-y2))

7) gives you C in terms of the given arbitrary points.
use this C in 6) to get B
and then use this C and B in 1) to get A

This gives pretty good first approximations for A,B and C
if you want better values, you will probably have to use numerical methods.
I would guess that if you are calculating fields far from the wire this
will be pretty good, but as you get closer to the wire you will need
better values for A,B,C

I didn't pause, I screamed in terror :) I bought a 45GB IBM 75GXP drive 
maybe.... year and a half ago? Might even be two years now. So far I haven't 
had any trouble with it, but I'm edgy about it.

Keep in mind that the massive defect reports seem to only apply to the 75GXP 
and 60GXP series drives, the higher-end stuff. If you're using primarily 
lower-end drives in the lab, I doubt you'll see any unusual defect rates.

Subject: [PLUG] DDS3 capacity??
Message-ID: <86lm41wtcl.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

I was having some "trouble" with a DDS3 tape drive (a Seagate 624000N,
advertised 12gig native/24gig with compression) the other day, was
getting "too many errors" reading from a tape and the little LEDs were
turning dim, very weird.  I could power cycle the drive, reload the
SCSI driver module, and try again and the failures (during read)
seemed to occur at different times/places.  I ran cleaning cartridge
and tried again, still the same problem.  I order another tape drive,
heh, then try a new tape.  New tape works.  Another new tape works,
and then an old one works.  So, I figure it was a bad tape.  However,
I decide to try rewriting the whole tape on the one that I'd marked as
bad, so I do this:

   mt -f /dev/nst0 setblk 32768
   dd obs=32768 < /dev/urandom of=/dev/nst0

which works (though it takes about 13 hours to finish).  A read takes
about 3 hours.  Odd thing is that despite an advertised 12 gig native
capacity, I hit End-Of-Media at 10,127,835,136 bytes.  How come so
little?  One of the pissers about these tape drives with hardware
compression is that you never _really_ know where you are on the tape.
Can't eject them without a rewind, so even just visual inspection is
out.  I am *guessing* that the hardware compression on the "random"
data from /dev/urandom actually resulted in the recorded information
being larger rather than smaller.  I suppose I could turn off the
hardware compression and try again to test that theory.  Besides that,
I don't have any theories at the moment.  Anyone else?

I suspect your guess is correct.  Running the test again with compression
turned off is probably the only way to know for certain.  BTW, the
seagate manual has much detail about the operation of the drive.
I don't know if this is the model you have, but I'm sure a lot of it
would apply.

Message-ID: <1036948295.1492.5.camel@localhost.localdomain>

I seem to be having trouble with my mouse after installing RedHat 7,3. 
I am using a Microsoft P/S2 Wheel Mouse.  The problem I am having is
that the wheel no longer works while it worked on RedHat 7.3 before.  I
guess the problem I'm having is I'm not sure what to configure it as on
/usr/sbin/mouseconfig.  I've tried several different combinations of
generic 2 button mouse, generic 3 button mouse, with and without emulate
three buttons.  The microsoft mouse choices that I tried intellimouse
with and without emulate three buttons.

Because I know I will get this question, I had RedHat 7.3 installed on
this computer last night when it worked, and I reinstalled RedHat 7.3,
never removing any hardware (in other words, the mouse was not removed
from the PC).

Nothing seems to be working.  Any help is greatly appreciated.

Also, where can I find the mailing list archive that I've heard others
talk about?  I checked around www.pdxlinux.org but was unable to find
it.

Where does the mouse not work? On a console, in X, or somewhere else? 

The fix will most likely be different depending on the answer.

Message-ID: <200211101243.28293.alex@daniloff.com>

Hello Linux folkz,
My sister bought an el'cheapo Athlon system based on M841LR (PC DDR266) mobo.
It has SiS 740 chipset with built in AC97 Codec (SiS 7012 Wave) with AMR modem 
card, built in LAN SiS 900 and built in video.
I've installed Linux on this system but I still can't get sound, modem and LAN 
port working on it. 
I even can't get report on PCI devices cause /proc/bus is empty.
Could somebody please share a positive experience on how to make this system 
work under Linux, or at least point me to the source of information.
Or this system should be doomed for eternity to work under Winblows only.
Many thanks in advance.

Alex

Hey, cool.  Wonder why I didn't see this before.  With a suitable
software implementation of the DCLZ compression algorithm you could
compute in advance the resulting size of whatever tarball (or
whatever) you were wanting to plop on the tape and make sure it fits.
Anyone know if such a thing exists already?

there is a sis900 module that needs to be loaded to get your LAN

say it is compatible with sound blaster?

Doing more grepping on the kernel source I discovered there is a sound
module i810_module that supports the sound card.  Ther is a not in
Documentation/Configure.help that mentions SiS7012 is used on
645/735/745 motherboards.It deals with a compilation variable of
CONFIG_SOUND_ICH, and is covered under the "Intel ICH audio support".

To load a module explicitly do:  insmod /lib/modules/<kernel
version>/kernel/net/sis900.o.  Similarly, if the kernel is configured
properly you could load the sound module.

I found that PCI bus/devices  information is passed through the BIOS and
for some reason can't be retrieved by the kernel on its own during boot up.
I added these options in /boot/grub/menu.lst to pass PCI parameters to the 
kernel: 
pci=bios,biosirq

Now I can see all devices with lspci and they all work except modem.
Could somebody tell me please if  this modem 
Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 56k Winmodem (Smart Link HAMR5600 compatible)
is possible to make working under Linux at all?

Many thanks in advance.

If it's truely Smartlink HAMR5600 compatible, try www.smlink.com, go to 
downloads on the left-hand menu, agree to some stupid end-user license, then 
it's self-explanatory.

I'm going to assume you mean with the wheel. 

If that is the case, then most likely, you have the standard ps/2 mouse
driver specified in your /etc/X11/XF86config file. Change PS/2 to IMPS/2
in that file, and restart X.

I decided I wanted to upgrade postgresql, and start coding with it.

I went to tuxfinder and got the latest stable release.

rpm -ivh postgresql-7.2-103.i386.rpm
error: failed dependencies:
  libcrypto.so.0.9.6 is needed by postgresql-7.2-103
  libssl.so.0.9.6 is needed by postgresql-7.2-103

This happens to me alot. I ran rpm --redhatprovides libssl.so.0.9.6,
and was told "no package provides ...".

Now what?

Subject: [PLUG] Strange Hardware/CD-ROM problem
Message-ID: <1036974524.21949.25.camel@duron>

I've run in to a problem trying to work with my CD burner.  I can burn,
no problem.  It's the trying to read a CD that is giving me Hell.

I'm afraid this is going to be a lot email with lots of detail... so be
warned.

Here's how the system is set up:  It's an nForce board.  The primary IDE
channel has just the hard drive (a 75GXP!  ackk).  The secondary channel
has my CD burner and a DVD drive (added about two weeks ago).

hdc=ide-scsi is used to boot the system so I can use my cd recorder as a
burner.  Interestingly, it assumed the DVD drive was to be scsi emulated
as well.  No big deal, I think.

Now, I don't know when the RW drive stopped being able to read disks - I
haven't used it much lately at all.  I know it was before my last reboot
(a power outage 3 days ago) because I tried to install Windoze in VMWare
and it failed.  I used the DVD drive.

Now, when I try and mount a cd in the rw drive, I get this:

root at duron:/home/rob# mount -t iso9660 /dev/scd0 /mnt/cdrom
mount: block device /dev/scd0 is write-protected, mounting read-only
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/scd0,
       or too many mounted file systems

and this, in syslog:

Nov 10 15:49:07 duron kernel: scsi0: ERROR on channel 0, id 0, lun 0,
CDB: 0x03 00 00 00 40 00

Nov 10 15:49:07 duron kernel: isofs_read_super: bread failed, dev=0b:00,
iso_blknum=16,block=16

(sorry for the line wrapping, I can't fix it in evolution)

For which I have been googling.  Thus far, I've found people who have
this cause kernel panicks (akk!  Luckily not me!) and one that wasn't in
english caused by trying to mount a cd as /dev/hdc1 instead of /dev/hdc
- I'm working with scsi here, so this shouldn't be an issue.

Soo... I'm having problems here.  :-\

cdrecord is able to burn CDs just fine, and the only error I ever get
from it is about char-major-97, which I googled to see was for parport
burners - not an issue here.

xcdroast locks itself up on launch trying to read the CD.

cat /dev/sr0 > test.iso

gives....
Nov 10 16:01:01 duron kernel: SCSI cdrom error : host 0 channel 0 id 0
lun 0 return code =

Nov 10 16:01:01 duron kernel:  I/O error: dev 0b:00, sector 32

repeated with the sector number increasing by four up to 84.  test.iso
ends up as being a 16K file that is very strange - cat test.iso gives
nothing, nano test.iso gives nothing, but it seems to be taking up
16K... whatever.

This would seem to imply the isofs problem way up there was just
something caused by not being able to read from the device (as it
matched this set with just that additional line).

So now I'm totally stumped.  Does anybody have any ideas?  The only
thing I can think of is that somehow the DVD and CD-RW drives don't get
along well - the CD-RW may have gone out at the same time the DVD was
installed, I just don't know.  I don't really want either one on the
same channel as my Hard drive, though, for performance issues......

Any thoughts?  :-)

The symptoms you describe are typical for cd-r drive failures. They tend to get 
more and more flaky until they just won;t read their own stuff any more.

Well, that is a major bummer.  The drive is about two months old, or so,
and has been working flawlessly until around the time I installed this
DVD drive.  And I'd be looking at two weeks turnaround to get a
replacement.  :-(

I think I'm going to try shutting down, unpluggnig the DVD drive, and
seeing what happens later tonight - but I *hate* shutting down the
system.  :-\

Thanks for the info, though.....

That might be the problem.  I had a similar problem with a DVD drive and 
a CDR not playing nicely together.  Wound up putting them on seperate 
systems and no problems.

Are you familiar with grep?  :-)

grep i.p.add.ress access.log > /path/to/new/file

That works if everything is static, if you want something more
permanent, wait a bit and an expert may answer you.  :-)

It seems that rpm --redhatprovides  depends critically on
some provides directives in the spec file and is not always
very useful. So it does not very often answer the question
you are asking. In general I would like to know how to
answer this question also. The answer to your specific question is
rpm -qf /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.6
openssl096-0.9.6-13

Are we taling about having apache make separate files for each IP?

IIRC there's a config line for httpd.conf that will allow you to specify a 
different log file for virtualo domains.

That's the OpenSSL libraries, but I can't help you beyond that since I 
1) use Debian and 2) track OpenSSL and PostgreSQL myself.

Actually... if there's a problem, it may be due to a recent spate of 
problems found in the 0.9.6 series.  You really need to be running 
against 0.9.6g (or later), but I still see stuff linked against 0.9.4 in 
Debian and OpenBSD packages.

You need to install the openssl096 package. Unless your box is
completely isolated, don't use the one on your CD-ROM. Get the
latest from ftp://updates.redhat.com/ or one of the mirrors. There
have been some important security fixes.

You need to supply the full path when querying the database

$ rpm -q --whatprovides /lib/libssl.so.0.9.6b
openssl-0.9.6b-28

Are you familiar with grep?  :-)

grep i.p.add.ress access.log > /path/to/new/file

That works if everything is static, if you want something more
permanent, wait a bit and an expert may answer you.  :-)

Yes, this works, but the failed dependencies message gives you no
clue as to what the full path is. So unless you can guess
the full path, you are stuck.

Try selecting Logitech Firstmouse Wheel.  I use that for my MS mouse and
the wheel then works fine.  Wheel functionality has zero to do with the
3-buttonness described in the list of mice during RH install.

Hi gang,

I'm having a heck of a time finding a good howto on this- Googling turns up 
many broken links and outdated information for Xfree 3.x. Red Hat provides no 
easy way to do this, dern them all to heck. Mandrake and SuSE on this same 
box did it all automagically- I want Tux Racer, dangit.

any good links or suggestions? Until I get acceleration working, my only fun 
game is Defenguin.

thanks,
Carla

Bill,

  Or, you wander over to rpmfind.net and search for that library. You'll get
the package in which it is found.

Message-ID: <2464.192.168.1.249.1036993104.squirrel@mail.robbyrussell.com>

Hey Pluggers,
My girlfriend is trying to get mandrake 9 working on her dell pc. It has
an onboard video card (intel 810) and she has a 2nd video card (ati rage
128 pci) that she added after she got the machine.
Should be simple enough to get her machine to work with the ati rather
than the 810 correct? Her windows XP partition runs fine... not a problem
with the video.
When it came time to setup the Xserver configuration in the install she
tried to select the ati rage 128...and found it, set the standard 1024x768
resolution...and hit test and black. Nothing. It hangs the machine. We
booted into the console... tried to configure the display settings with
DrakConf..same thing. It always defaults to the Intel 810 when we go to
configure the Xfree86 settings. Is there a way to verify which device it
is attempting to use for the Xserver?
We even went as far as plugging in a 2nd monitor to see if that would
work. It still didnt quite work. It reset the 2nd monitor like it was
going to do something..and black..and hang.

Any thoughts as to how we should go about resolving this issue?

thanks in advance.

Roby,

If it makes you feel any better, I have found more ways *not* to
configure X than perhaps may be statistically possible!

This is probably a resolution/refresh issue. Try a lower resolution like
``640x480'' first and work your way from there.

Also, ppost your /var/log/XFree86.0.log file. That would be very
helpfull.

Disable the onboard video in the BIOS.

I'm shocked Windows is working - it should be trying to work as a
two-monitor system with the i810 (AGP) as the primary monitor and the
ATi (PCI) as the secondary monitor.

God only knows why Linux isn't working... but I wouldn't worry about it
until the i810 video is disabled in the BIOS.

I wonder if Mandrake is, for some strange reason, trying to use the ATi
drivers for the i810 video?  Or vice versa?  I dunno...

you can't 'disable' the i810 in the bios. It's already using the pci video
as the 'default' video card...and I'm sure if I wanted to make the onboard
video card work in windows it would if i plugged in a monitor.
My guess was the same as yours. I think mandrake might be trying to use
the i810 card with the ati drivers...which... does not work.

which is why i plugged in 2 monitors ot see what the deal was. no dice.
i'll try a lower refresh rate and work my way out of it. and check the log
file.

thanks, i'll try to get a little farther.

That's just strange...

Have you googled about a bit?  I'd google for your dell model number for
information about the video setup.  Maybe there is a jumper somewhere
that disables the onboard video?

I just dunno.

My guess is it is trying the wrong drivers on the wrong card.  Hence no
video from either.

Get some info out of your log file... down around the bottom where it
actually bails out (it does bail, right?).  :-)

Subject: [PLUG] X problem messed up in RedHat 8.0
In-Reply-To: <200211101442.41775.alex@daniloff.com>
Message-ID: <20021111064521.25578.qmail@web10408.mail.yahoo.com>

Today I tried to install Nvidia drivers for my RedHat 8.0 box. Nvidia
only has RPMs for 7.3, so I tried installing from a source RPM (not
really sure what I was doing). Anyway, the install didn't work. I had
saved my original XF86Config to .bak, so restored it, and was able to
get back into X with the generic NV drivers.

I then proceeded to try to install from tarball from Nvidia, which
didn't work. However, restoring my XF86Config.bak did not let me back
into X. I tried the old Xconfigurator command, but it doesn't appear to
exist anymore. Now I can't get into X no matter what I try.

Best solution would be to install Nvidia's drivers so my 3D is more
than 2 fps. Second best solution would be to get X going the way it was
before I tried installing Nvidia's drivers from Tarball. Help!

While I'm at it, I think I'll vent just a little. I really like Linux,
been using it as my main workstation at home since last Xmas and at
work since last February, but I do have some frustrations. One of the
first things learned was a very useful tool called linuxconf, where I
was actually able to, as a newbie, set up pretty much everything about
my machine. Next version came out (7.2 I think), and Linuxconf wasn't
there by default, so I had to download it and install it manually. Next
version, it doesn't exist! I found the setup command, which could at
least set up about half my system stuff though, and got by with just it
and Xconfigurator. Now Xconfigurator doesn't work.

Anyway, I'm a little irritated that about the time I get comfortable
with a tool, it disappears, and now I'm stuck. Is there a replacement
for linuxconf that I haven't heard about (non-GUI)? Is there a new name
for Xconfigurator, or a replacement for it?

It's nice when they add cool new tools to my toolbox, but I wish they'd
quit removing the ones I know how to use!

A little more info:

I also tried xf86config and redhat-config-xfree86. The latter tried for
about 10 seconds, then came back with a simple error message:

 "Error: cannot start X server"

I can't resist.

Pretty simple, eh?

OK, seriously... I don't mean to be a dick or anything, but you should get
a nice book like Essential System Administration (from O'Reilly &
Associates) or even UNIX IN A NUTSHELL.  Hell, I've even heard good things
about some of the "for Dummies" books, though I'm absolutely appalled by
the condescending, anti-intellectual naming convention.

The questions you're asking are very basic sorts of things that should be
part of your toolbox -- I/O redirection, GNU fileutils, etc.

Spend a day with a book and some sample tasks.  You'll be glad you did.

having read the whole thread of responses, I did a locate on the
libssl (and libcrypto that it also complained about) and found
*.so.0.9.6 in /usr/lib, and *.so.9.6b in /lib. Then I did the rpm -qf
command on those two paths, and got openssl096-0.9.6-6 for the
/usr/lib, and openssl-0.9.6b-8 for the /lib.

So, if these two are installed, how come the postgres rpm doesn't see
them?

I'll go get the latest openssl as well. Maybe if I install both latest
packages at the same time, they'll both be happy. or not.

OK. I went to tuxfinder, and found two version of openssl:

openssl-0.9.8-1.i386.rpm
openssl096-0.9.6-13.i386.rpm

any ideas what the differences are, or which is preferred?

Subject: [PLUG] X configuration advice
Message-ID: <3DCFBFE8.4030000@attbi.com>

I lately went through a bit of a hassle getting my Vaio set up with X 
and learned a few things in the process.  Though I've got a bit further 
to learn.  Anyway, the simple explanation.

I went via this tutorial at IBM (free reg):
http://www-105.ibm.com/developerworks/education.nsf/linux-onlinecourse-bytitle/3100FF4795B3F31F86256AF70056FDB3?OpenDocument

Helped a lot with XFree86 4.x on one of my systems.

Didn't quite work properly with my laptop.  Only got a depth of 7 and 
800x600.

I had recently downloaded Knoppix and noted it got depth of 16 with 
1024x768.  Much better.  So I took it's XF86config file and edited the 
Files section to match my Gentoo setup.

Wound up working except for an invisble mouse cursor.
Setting:
Option "SWCursor" "True"

in the devices section got that working.

Hopefully this will help somebody...

0.9.8 is the development version

0.9.7 is a version very near release.  Close enough to release that 
development had to move on to the next version

0.9.6g is the current stable release.

Message-ID: <1037029523.7507.24.camel@homepc>

Hello Folks,

I hope you're following the Red Hat Road Tour gang in their journey
across the country. It makes for fine reading as long as <LOL> is ok
where ever this message finds you. ;-)

http://www.redhat.com/roadtour/journal/  <<< Tour Journal
http://k12linux.org/roadtour << Schedule of Portland stops

What strikes me is how the open source community is so diverse and how
it's touched people in so many different ways. Cool...

I'm glad that Portland is at the end of this trip because we'll get to
hear all the stories. The best time for this will be at the BridgePort
Brew Pub on Friday. The clinic on Saturday will be a great chance to
hear more stories and simply play with stuff. We're opening up several
extra rooms in expectation of a big crowd. Red Hat is drop shipping a
truck load of goodies to give away. So far we have over 20 different
K-20 EDU agencies represented for the Monday EDU/Open Source round
table.

If you're coming down from Seattle or up from the valley, post to the
PLUG list and I bet you'll find some folks willing to put you up if
you're looking to attend both Friday and Saturday.

As someone who gets to see the kids using the software everyday I'd like
to say thanks to the larger community of code writers, bug reporters and
problem solvers that make up the OS community. My motto is now "It
works. It's free. Duh..." What I see is that the EDU world and many many
others are starting to understand "duh" and you all know how hard that
can be. ;-^)

Looking forward to seeing you all in Portland next weekend!

;-) Paul

Subject: [PLUG] Compressed data files
Message-ID: <1037032226.9386.63.camel@red>

I'm wondering how some programs deal with data files that
are sometimes compressed using gzip. I haven't yet written
code for this.

Taking the loadkeys program as an example, it can read
keyboard map files that are either compressed or
uncompressed (us.map or us.map.gz). Loadkeys is
dynamically-linked and uses only libc.so.6. Does
libc provide programmers with the ability to read
compressed files or is this coded into the loadkeys
program?

It looks to me like it probably forks an external process:

  [heinlein]$ strings /bin/loadkeys | grep -i zip
  bunzip2
  gunzip

If I were you, I'd grab the console-tools source code and grep for 
'unzip'.

Hi Carla,

This card is a 3Dfx card, the 3Dfx-HOWTO
(/var/share/doc/HOWTO/en-txt/3Dfx-HOWTO.gz on my debian system) should
get it up and running.  However, this is a crippled 3Dfx card, and I
struggled with one for a while before giving up, it was just too
unstable (in winblowz) and was really slow at any 3D tasks.  When I
finally got it running in linux, there was a light snow falling on the
desktop.  This was seen by other users of that card, and was chalked up
to drivers.  Maybe Xfree86-4 would work better, I got rid of the card
before it came out.

How about changing the memory allocated to 0?  Does the mobo have a real
AGP slot (you may be able to disable the i810 by putting something in
the AGP slot)?

Another thing to try, is to use a more generic driver (like svga) which
should run whatever card is active (not very well, though).

Subject: [PLUG] Start Me Up
Message-ID: <1037059001.1101.10.camel@duron>

Anybody remember Microsoft's plan to have The Rolling Stones' "Start Me
Up" song playing while Windows 95 booted?  Remember how it never
materialized in the final product?

Well, I was thinking about this the other day and decided to play with
the idea a bit.  

I don't have many things loading up on this box and my startup scripts
are optimized to heck and back with &'s, so it isn't ideal for me, but
it may be for you (especially those with boxes that take 3+ minutes to
boot up)...

I put this in my /etc/rc.d/rc.S script about halfway down, after mount
is run to mount all the partitions.  I'm using alsa - hence the
modproble line and alsactl line.

/sbin/modprobe snd-intel8x0;modprobe snd-pcm-oss;modprobe
snd-mixer-oss;modprobe snd-seq-oss
/usr/sbin/alsactl restore
/usr/bin/nohup /usr/bin/mpg123 -k 120 /mp3/Angel\ -\ Theme\ Song.mp3 -q
&

That is three lines - darned Evolution wrapped it.

Anyway - about two seconds after the kernel finishes loading, the song
starts to play... in this case, it is the theme song from Angel.  It
survives init's attempt to kill it with nohup's help.  It then plays
until it is done and frees up the audio channel.  :-)

One could easily substitute the 'Start Me Up' song if you so desired....

It plays for me past where I log in, run startx -- -quiet &, let X load,
then switch back and log out and open an Eterm or two... but most
systems take a lot longer to boot than mine.  :-)

Just a bit of fun I thought I'd share......

I'm sure it could be improved upon - rewrite the soundcard drivers to
start playing the song (in a non-compressed format, I'm sure) as soon as
the audio device is initialized, compile the drivers in to the kernel,
and have the song start playing even before the kernel finishes
loading.. but that is way far beyond my capabilities.

It's so much easier to install a large electro-magnetic around the door to 
your bunker with a hidden "defeat" switch.

Or, to be safe, rig all your gear with small explosives like Mel Gibson did

The zlib (and bz2lib) libraries are easy to use.  You can either use the 
stdio-ish routines, e.g., zfopen(), zread(), zprintf(), or call the 
inflater and deflater routines directly.  That takes a bit more work, 
but it gives you *much* more flexibility in doing things like inserting 
a Z_SYNC_FLUSH after every meaningful chunk of data (e.g., every file in 
an archive) so that you can recover the maximum amount of data even if 
the file is subsequently corrupted.

As for gzip in particular, it's a well-documented format that provides a 
wrapper around the zlib output.  Things like original filename, 
timestamp, and at the end of the file the uncompressed size and CRC 
checksum.

Put it all together and you get a very nice function that I'm surprised 
has never been put into a library - maybe it's just too obvious - ...

1) open the file
2) lock it
3) mmap it
4) check the first few bytes - if it's a GZIP file mmap a buffer large 
enough to hold the uncompressed data and blitz your original file into 
the second mmap file.  Unlock and close the original file.
5) return the structure containing the information needed when you close 
the file - file pointer, locks, mmap ptr, etc.

This is the type of code that can be a pain to get right the first time, 
but once you have it working it can be reused everywhere and you wonder 
how you ever got by without it.

That was never the plan.  The plan was only to use that song during the
Windows 95 launch advertising campaign and it DID materialize.

Microsoft had already paid Brian Eno to develop the Win95 startup sound
before Portland's own Wieden + Kennedy got the big idea of using the
Stones for the advertising.

Just so's you know.

Ahhh... it was back before I was really in to computers very much, so
was only vaguely aware of it... but I did think that KATU did a piece on
it, and at the very least showed it starting up wtih the music playing -
I probably put two and two together and got five.  :-)

Thanks for the info....

	Too bad about the choice of song. Kind of ironic that the 
software so closely lived up to the song's title. Or maybe that was 
the intention, all along.

	Perhaps Microsoft will chose better next time, and select a 
song about CONTINUOUS OPERATION, rather than continuous start ups. 
; -)

	... although I hear that there's a "Cult of the BSOD" that 
uses the down time for pray and reflection.   <smirk>

Subject: [PLUG] C++ cout in Linux - force terminal to output partial line?
Message-ID: <001a01c289fd$11650700$6401a8c0@Endeavor>

In migrating from Win to Lin, I've noticed an interesting issue:  Output
to the terminal doesn't seem to take place as the cout command sends the
stream to it, until a endl or "\n" is received.  For example,

	for(i=0;i<29;i++)
	{
		cout << i << " ";
		//(1 time delay second delay code here)
	}
	cout << "\nNow you see it.\n";

executing this could would display nothing for 30 seconds, then dump to
the terminal:

	0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
25 26 27 28
	Now you see it.

a carriage return ("\r") does not do it either.

In a DOS console, output is immediate, though I can't say many other
positive things for working in a DOS terminal.  After some searching, I
am still unable to find a way to force an "ouput buffer dump" on the
terminal, so I imagine I'm attacking this from the wrong angle?

Having similar issues with kbhit() though I have found several articles
on different ways to emulate this in Linux, so I'll check that out.

Any ideas or how-to links for the output problem appreciated.

Thanks,
Greg

positive things for working in a DOS terminal.  After some searching, I
am still unable to find a way to force an "ouput buffer dump" on the
terminal, so I imagine I'm attacking this from the wrong angle?

Having similar issues with kbhit() though I have found several articles
on different ways to emulate this in Linux, so I'll check that out.

Any ideas or how-to links for the output problem appreciated.

Thanks,
Greg

In general, it depends on tge buffering options of the file.
The most portable way to do what you want is by flushing the buffers every
time you want the output to be displayed.

#include <unistd.h>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    for ( int i = 0; i < 10; ++i )
    {
        cout << i << " " << flush;
        sleep(2);
    }
    cout << endl;
}

Thanks.. I came across this for an iMac problem of all things... but still
a valid problem.
http://www.mandrake.com/en/archives/cooker-ppc/2002-09/msg00105.php

I disabled the i2c driver like so..

cd /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/
mv libi2c.a libi2c.bad

and it worked when I did a startx.

am I missing out on anything in the video by doing this? Of course now the
/var/log/XFree86.0.log file shows complaints about not finding the "i2c"
module.. how can I track down where it is trying to call this to avoid
this error in the future? It's working now...which is great, but... for
sanity I'd like to figure out what causes this and how this affects the
machine longterm. Where might I look to see where this module is being
called on a startx ?

I think the i2c module is used to query the monitor about what resolutions
it supports.  Only newer monitors and video cards (< 3 or 4 years old?)
support this feature.

You should see the i2c module listed in the Module section of 
/etc/X11/XF86Config.

If you really want to reduce the file sizes for your programs, check out
lzip:
http://lzip.sourceforge.net/
It provides better compression than even bzip2, which is pretty
impressive.

Well, at least part of the probelm is that I ran out of space 
on the /var partition... I've corrected that by moving some 
dirs and linking them back, I'll update as soon as I know.

That's a very cool trick. Thanks for sharing it.

I've got a corrupted rpm database on a RH 7.3 system, so:
#rpm -rebuilddb

It runs for a while, but instead of finishing, I get:
Seegmentation fault

Why is this? I cannot install packages on the new system and 
it's causing me delays on my project. Waaaah.

There is no "boot flag".

Check the BIOS settings in their computers to see if CD's are allowed to
boot.  If that's not it, then what it likely is, is that their
computer's BIOS do not support booting an "isolinux" CD image.

You see, there are two ways to make a CD bootable.  One, the older way,
supported by older BIOS, is called "El Torito".  An El Torito CD has a
bootable floppy diskette image on it.  The BIOS uses that to boot the
CD.  The newer way, using "isolinux", is not the same thing, AFAIK.  (I
may be wrong; perhaps isolinux uses El Torito?)  I've had trouble with
older BIOS booting "isolinux" CD's.  The same computer would have no
trouble booting an older El Torito CD.

See if the CD provides a boot floppy image to use...  Hmmm.  Why must
you boot with the CD to perform an upgrade?  On a Debian GNU/Linux
system, you would simply run "apt-cdrom" to register the new CD, then
use the normal "aptitude" or "apt-get" tools to perform the upgrade. 
(no reboot required, unless you upgrade your kernel)

Yes, that sounds likely...  so it's probably being pulled in by the DDC
module?  Perhaps if you comment off the line:

	Load	"ddc"

... it will stop complaining, and won't break again on upgrade, when
that module is reinstalled on you.

Check the GNU Libc "info" documentation, and learn about terminals. 
You'll find in there how to set the buffering from line buffered to
non-buffered.  You need to set the "stdout" descriptor's buffering
characteristics, probably using a libc call.

Are there issues with mixing calls to "printf" type functions and the
C++ operator << ones?

All this and more!  Read the fine info.

I'm trying to start up mysql...and keep running into this problem.
any thoughts?

mysqld got signal 11;
This could be because you hit a bug. It is also possible that this binary
or one of the libraries it was linked agaist is corrupt, improperly built,
or misconfigured. This error can also be caused by malfunctioning hardware.
We will try our best to scrape up some info that will hopefully help diagnose
the problem, but since we have already crashed, something is definitely wrong
and this may fail

key_buffer_size=8388600
record_buffer=131072
sort_buffer=2097144
max_used_connections=0
max_connections=100
threads_connected=0
It is possible that mysqld could use up to
key_buffer_size + (record_buffer + sort_buffer)*max_connections = 225791 K
bytes of memory
Hope that's ok, if not, decrease some variables in the equation

Attempting backtrace. You can use the following information to find out
where mysqld died. If you see no messages after this, something went
terribly wrong...
Bogus stack limit or frame pointer, fp=0xbfffe0b8,
stack_bottom=0x3bdbc910, thread_stack=65536, aborting backtrace.
Trying to get some variables.
Some pointers may be invalid and cause the dump to abort...
thd->query at 0x3ac6fc20  is invalid pointer
thd->thread_id=1919639395

Successfully dumped variables, if you ran with --log, take a look at the
details of what thread 1919639395 did to cause the crash.  In some cases
of really
bad corruption, the values shown above may be invalid

The manual page at http://www.mysql.com/doc/C/r/Crashing.html contains
information that should help you find out what is causing the crash

Who owns the directory /var/lib/mysql?
You are starting it as root and even root may not have write access to
that directory.

IIRC a Stones tune still lives in the 9x series startup.  After the 
initial install, when the desktop comes up, the 9x 'tour' screen pops up 
with a Stones riff going on in the background.

So there we are.  :)

See page 65 of the November 11, 2002, issue of Fortune magazine for a
one page column by Stewart Alsop on Chandler, Mitch Kapor's open-source
alternative to Outlook/Exchange.

Alsop thinks it could take 5 years to develop and another 5 to get it to
the point where it catches up with O/E in terms of market penetration.

I'm using flexbackup to do web server backups. Today while I was watching 'top' I 
was stunned at how much system resources that gzip took.

How do I renice this? I don;t really care how fast gzip is, but I want the server 
to be more avail to apache.

Can I default renice gzip or something to fix this? Will gzip be reniced if I 
launch it with a reniced flexbackup? 

I'm not sure I know what I want, except that I need gzip to be more polite.

Generally gzip is CPU-bound.  The default UNIX scheduler does a pretty
decent job of transparently managing CPU-bound processes with a minimum of
impact on a system.  (The same cannot always be said of I/O or
memory-intensive jobs...)

If gzip is forked by flexbackup it should be also niced if the original
flexbackup is started using the "nice <command>" command.  If you just
renice the flexbackup process that's already running then no, the gzips
won't change.

If you can change the invocation of gzip that flexbackup uses, try using
"nice gzip --fast" instead.  This runs it at reduced priority and uses a
slightly less tight compression.

In my tests on the same data set gzip (default) compressed a set of files
to 20% of their original size and "gzip --fast" compressed the same set to
25% of their original size, but completed in less than half the time.

If you really want to get serious, you might also look at
"lzop" compression.  This is NOT gzip-compatible so if you plan to read
tapes far into the future or on systems without lzop you should not use
it.  It compressed that same data set as above to 30% of its original
size, but was 7 times faster than gzip!

I trust it more than I do Minicom/lrzsz, at least for uploading Cisco IOS 
images.  Everytime I've tried to use Minicom it's mangled the upload 
somehow; when I tried with Hyperterm it's just worked.  Of course that 
makes it hard to do anything other than TFTP updates, since I don't 
actually keep any Windows systems around...

Mike,

I built a small script that's universal. You could simply run this from
cron in the case of your backup.  It take two arguments; The first the
name of the program you wish it to run and the second is the priority
you wish it to run at.

Since a child processes cannot take on a higher priority than it's
parent by default, be assured that sub-processed gzip will be nice using
this script.

Of course, there are several variations but this should give you a
platform from wich to work at the very least.


#------------------begin run_nice.sh----------------------------
#!/bin/bash

#nice_run.sh
#usage nice_gimp.sh (name of application) (priority level)
#Example: # nice_run.sh gimp 20

exec $1 &

ps -ef | grep $1 | awk '{ print $2}' | while read proc
do
  renice $2 -p $proc 
done

#--------------------------end run_nice.sh----------------------

You're trying to run postmap on a regex map, which doesn't work.  postmap is 
for building databases with literal mappings, not regexs or pcres.

I assume this is the one in northwest, not the one on Hawthorne. (Is that 
one even operational again after the fire?)

There is programmatic support for gzip compression, through libz (and for 
bzip2 through libbz2).  There are of course wrapper interfaces for the 
various scripting languages--Python, Perl, PHP, etc.

Better yet, as Steve Bonds pointed out:

# nice -n 20 flexbackup

This is a case where you build something in Unix only to find out that
it already exists.

No such thing, either the CD-reader can read the boot sector of the CD,
or it can't.  There are many factors that determine whether or not a
CD-reader will boot.  The most difficult CD's to boot are CD-RW's, the
re-burnable coating is not as reflective as single burn CD's and
CD-readers have more problems with re-writable CD's than other types.

The firmware of the CD-reader and the motherboard BIOS play a part, some
of the older ones can only handle the "floppy emulation" that El Torito
boot disks use (when this boots, you have a virtual a: drive that
consists of the boot image, the real a: drive becomes the b: drive and
the CD cannot be accessed without CDROM drivers being loaded).  Some of
the newer ones can only handle the "iso boot" that isolinux does.  Some
can do either without any problems.

I guess the first thing to try is to burn to a CD-R, if that doesn't
work then, try swapping the CD-reader that doesn't boot with one that
does.  If it still won't boot, then the motherboard is getting in your
way and your going to have to come up with another boot method or
motherboard.

BTW, I had a laptop CD-reader (no floppy drive in the machine) that
wouldn't boot a Win98 floppy image.  It would boot isolinux, Win2k, and
FreeDOS, but not Win98, even when it was loaded with the isolinux
"floppy emulator" emulator memdisk.  There are some mysteries that will
never be solved.

Good Luck

Internet Security Systems Security Brief
November 12, 2002

Multiple Remote Vulnerabilities in BIND4 and BIND8

Synopsis:

ISS X-Force has discovered several serious vulnerabilities in the Berkeley
Internet Name Domain Server (BIND). BIND is the most common implementation of
the DNS (Domain Name Service) protocol, which is used on the vast majority of
DNS servers on the Internet. DNS is a vital Internet protocol that maintains
a database of easy-to-remember domain names (host names) and their
corresponding numerical IP addresses.

Impact:

The vulnerabilities described in this advisory affect nearly all currently
deployed recursive DNS servers on the Internet. The DNS network is considered
a critical component of Internet infrastructure. There is no information
implying that these exploits are known to the computer underground, and there
are no reports of active attacks. If exploits for these vulnerabilities are
developed and made public, they may lead to compromise and DoS attacks against
vulnerable DNS servers. Since the vulnerability is widespread, an Internet
worm may be developed to propagate by exploiting the flaws in BIND. Widespread
attacks against the DNS system may lead to general instability and inaccuracy
of DNS data.

Affected Versions:

BIND SIG Cached RR Overflow Vulnerability

	BIND 8, versions up to and including 8.3.3-REL
	BIND 4, versions up to and including 4.9.10-REL

BIND OPT DoS

	BIND 8, versions 8.3.0 up to and including 8.3.3-REL

BIND SIG Expiry Time DoS

	BIND 8, versions up to and including 8.3.3-REL

It's interesting you mention this.  I just got through upgrading the
software in my Cisco 675.  I had a terrible time getting the xmodem
transfer to work.  I tried both kermit and minicom.  Each time I started
the transfer, it would just sit there.  I poked around on the net and
found a few people saying that the lrzsz doesn't have a very good xmodem
implementation.  I ended up rebuilding lrzsz from the latest src
rpm I could find.  After trying a couple of times, I finally got
it to transfer.  I'm not certain the newer lrzsz code helped, but
at least my 675 now has current firmware.

The story of how a price was put on the rights to use Start Me Up is itself
interesting...

(ObDisclaimer: It may be an UL for all I know).

I've read suggestions that Microsoft negotiate for the rights to use another

Put the public_key into the .ssh/authorized_keys2 file on the server you
want to send the files to...here's how I do it (YMMV).

Machine1 = Local Machine
Machine2 = Remote Machine

[Machine1]: ssh-keygen -t rsa
On this step don't enter a passphrase for the key.

[Machine1]: scp .ssh/id_rsa.pub [youruser]@[Machine2]:~/.ssh/authorized_keys2

Or if you have an authorized_keys2 file on Machine2, copy it to your home
directory, ssh to Machine2, and do 'cat id_rsa.pub >>
.ssh/authorized_keys2'

Now you should be able to login without a password.  At least that's what
worked for me.

Hi.

I've got to build a cable for pulling a serial console up on this old
ethernet switch.

Now, I've got the pin diagram for the RJ45 on the switch, but I'm not sure
how to wire them to the DB9 for my PC.

The RJ45 diagram looks like this:
1  Transmit Data (XMT)
2  Data Carrier Detect (DCD)
3  Data Set Ready (DSR)
4  Receive Data (RCV)
5  Signal Ground (GND)
6  Data Terminal Ready (DTR)
7  Request To Send (RTS)
8  Clear To Send (CTS)

Now, my understand of RS232 on DB9 is as follows:
1  Data Carrier Detect (DTD)
2  Receive Data (RxD)
3  Transmit Data (TxD)
4  Data Terminal Ready (DTR)
6  Data Set Ready (DSR)
7  Request To Send (RTS)
8  Clear To Send (CTS)

So what's 5 and where does the signal ground go?

Can someone give me a quick chart to show which pins on the RJ45 go to
which pins on the DB9?  I'm not in a position to get another DB9, so I've
really got one shot at this or waste a whole day until I can get another
connector and get back here.

I'd make a stab at it intuitively and see what happens, but I'd rather
check with the old-school wiring experts I know sit on this list.

Thanks.
J.

I'm far from the old-school guy you are looking for, but a quick google
seemed to indicate that pin 5 on the DB-9 is GND also. Here's one I
found:

I don't have a good answer for you, but if you do fuck up, don't cut
off the DB9 end, cut off the RJ45, since it is pretty easy to crimp
another one.  If you don't have a crimper, let me know.  

BTW, When is Leatherman going to integrate an RJ45 crimper.

Jeme,

I think I'd start with this simple 2-wire config first,
how it works:

     TxD  <->  RxD
     RxD  <->  TxD

I know it's better to have the signal ground (GND) line,
but if it's not available ....
... another possibility is to solder the ground to metal
surround the end (perimeter) of the DB-9 connector ....

Just my $.02 -- I'm *not* a EE.

doh!  I didn't read Jeme's orig. post close enough.

Yes, Dan, pin 5 = GND sounds right.  (Hey ... it's
been a few years since I've had to cobble these together.)

Pin 5 on the DB9 is Signal Ground.  (Pin 9 on the DB9 is Ring Indicator, BTW)

At first glance, this one looks correct.
http://www.zytrax.com/tech/layer_1/cables/tech_rs232.htm
If you happen to have the "Using C-Kermit" book, you can find what you
need on page 484.

Do you know if the ether switch is a DCE or a DTE device?  A DCE device,
like a modem, would drive the RD, DCD, DSR, and CTS signals.  A DTE device,
like a VT100 or a pc serial port, would drive TD, DTR, and RTS.  Very
generally speaking, in a DCE device with a DB connector, the connector
would be female.  The DTE DB connector would be male.

If you have a voltmeter (aka multimeter), you can check the voltages on
the RJ45 to see whether it thinks it is a DCE or DTE device.

Yup, the keys I'm using right now were generated with PGP version 6.8.x
in Windows 2000.

Since I imported them, I've just been taking my .gnupg directory with me
wherever I go... but I think the syntax was 

gpg --import --enable-secret-keys <exported secret key file>

...or something similar.  Google about or read the man page...

Good luck.  :-)

They dropped the snd prefix in CVS about two weeks ago... and I *think*
released RC4 or RC5 since then... so most people just getting in to alsa
now will likely not see the snd- prefix stuff.

you can either generate an ssh key without a passphrase for
just this purpose, or you can tell ssh to use an ssh-agent
which you will have to type the passphrase to at some point.

I had a similar need close to a year ago, and found a great article at
the following URL:

<http://www.hostingtech.com/nm/01_09_madness.html>

It gives a very detailed description of how to set up a "modular"
cabling system using CAT-5 cabling (w/ RJ-45 connectors) and various
DB-9/25 serial connector adapters. I found all the parts required at
(gulp) Fry's.

If the link doesn't work, let me know. I archived a copy of the article
locally.

That helps, but it still allows my idle to drop to under 5%, still not what I was 
looking for. Before renice, it would totally monopolize the cycles. I'm going to 
drop the compression rate a bit.

I thought you used SuSE? If so, in 8.1 I think this is the package
Intel-v92ham - Driver for Intel's v92 HaM modem
This package includes the drivers and configuration tools for the Intel HaM
Modem with MD563X-HaM V.90 chipset.It is a controllerless modem and so
sometimes called a "winmodem" (or in this case a linmodem).
This is not completely free sofware!. Please read the license agreement in
/usr/share/doc/packages/Intel-v92ham/license.txt
As this driver is binary only, please note, that SuSE can offer no installation
support for this modems!!

I recieved the same advice about the cd-rw out of Austin's LUG.
Thank's Derek.


No such thing, either the CD-reader can read the boot sector of the CD,
or it can't.  There are many factors that determine whether or not a
CD-reader will boot.  The most difficult CD's to boot are CD-RW's, the
re-burnable coating is not as reflective as single burn CD's and
CD-readers have more problems with re-writable CD's than other types.

The firmware of the CD-reader and the motherboard BIOS play a part, some
of the older ones can only handle the "floppy emulation" that El Torito
boot disks use (when this boots, you have a virtual a: drive that
consists of the boot image, the real a: drive becomes the b: drive and
the CD cannot be accessed without CDROM drivers being loaded).  Some of
the newer ones can only handle the "iso boot" that isolinux does.  Some
can do either without any problems.

I guess the first thing to try is to burn to a CD-R, if that doesn't
work then, try swapping the CD-reader that doesn't boot with one that
does.  If it still won't boot, then the motherboard is getting in your
way and your going to have to come up with another boot method or
motherboard.

BTW, I had a laptop CD-reader (no floppy drive in the machine) that
wouldn't boot a Win98 floppy image.  It would boot isolinux, Win2k, and
FreeDOS, but not Win98, even when it was loaded with the isolinux
"floppy emulator" emulator memdisk.  There are some mysteries that will
never be solved.

Good Luck

I'll bite on this on. I had the symptom, CD OK, hard drive not, and it turned

No jumper usually means the IDE connector only has a single drive. Some drives
when they are only drive on the connector and set to master or slave will not
work, some will. Any same jumper, ie master and master on the same connector,
usually causes one drive to disappear.	Some drives will not play nice with
others no matter how the jumpers are set.  So the best thing to do is to
experiment, to find out how your drives behave.

MPlayer has compiled for me straight out of the tarball every single time
with no trouble whatsoever.  There were times when certain proprietary
codecs didn't work as expected, but the fact that any of that stuff has
been reverse engineered when so many people like me are doing nothing to
help is fantastic and amazing, so I'm not bitching.

But anyway, I've compiled every release of MPlayer for the past maybe
eighteen months and never had the tiniest bit of trouble.

Well, if you're not making any effort, you may as well be lame.  I think
it's a fine description.

Recognize your lameness.  If it makes you feel bad, change your behavior
to be less lame.

Your response reminds me of a time in my high school chemistry class when
the later-valedictorian girl got her test back from the teacher with D on
the front.  There were two As in the class and lots of Ds and Fs (oddly,
no Bs or Cs).  The girl spoke up and said, "This is wrong.  You shouldn't
give me a D.  Nearly everyone got a lower score than me.  Not everyone can
be like those two over there."  She indicated the two A students who sat
next to each other and were actively interested in chemistry.  The teacher
looked at her with unmitigated scorn and said, "You gave me a D paper and
now want me to create some kind of formula that turns your D into an A
without you putting any more work into it.  That is simply not going to
happen.  Some people are capable of doing this and that has been
demonstrated.  You are not.  That may disappoint you greatly, but it's not
my job to make you feel good about your failings, just to show you where
they are."

> Also, there was mention of a security issue.

Is this an attempt to turn people away from MPlayer because they called
you a lamer?

If you are honestly trying to warn people of a security issue, you could
make the effort to actually explain the issue and provide links (mention
where?  what kind of issue?).  Perhaps you tried, but your lameness slowed
you down.  I can dig that.  I appreciate and respect that some people
carry handicaps.  Me, I can't play basketball for shit.  But for goodness'
sake, try to let us know your limitations so we can accomodate for them.

I'll sell you a disk image of my filesystem (minus /usr/local and
/home) for a fair price (a fair price being that exchange which gives me,
the seller, enough to compensate for the lost time and materials).  Say,
$1.00? 

Of course, it only 'works' if you have strikingly similar hardware to mine
as there are no extra modules compiled for hardware not present in my
system.  So maybe that's not an option for you.  However, I could point
you to instructions for building a system like mine that will be suitable
for your hardware and I'd do that for free (considering it would take very
little time and no materials other than some miniscule, unbillable amount
of electrical power and bandwidth), but I don't think you're willing to
pay the extended cost of your own time and energy to construct a system
that 'works' even when the materials and instructions are provided to you
freely.

Subject: [PLUG] Up-2-date applet missing from taskbar]
Message-ID: <1037190961.1336.11.camel@localhost.localdomain>

I upgraded my evolution groupware package from 1.0.8 to 1.2.0 tonight
using Ximian redcarpet update tool for RH 8.0.  The directions weren't
entirely clear, but I managed to update the package.  

Then I continued having problems where my pop3 password continually had
to be re-entered even though I clicked on the button asking for it to be
saved.  There were times where it wouldn't log into my ISP's pop3
server.

I ended up rebooting the system after going into root from my regular
user name.  When the system came back up, I noticed that the button for
the evolution email was missing from the left panel.  A blank space was
still there between the icon for the mozilla browser and open office
application.  I was finally able to figure out how to get a new
evolution button placed there by dragging and dropping from
/usr/bin/evolution.  The icon is different from the original one, but it
works somewhat and I still have problems with evolution messing up the
pop3 password.

The last thing that I just noticed was that the applet in the taskbar
indicating about up2date status is missing.

What is going on?

TIA,

Jim

Keep in mind that even if you renice a process, it still may monopolize 
all of the CPU time if there aren't any other processes that are ready 
to run. With the process reniced to 20, it should hopefully only run 
when there are no other processes that need need CPU time.

With your processes reniced, look at the "nice" value that top displays 
not what the "idle" time is. The lower the nice value the less CPU time 
that is going to your backup and compression processes. You may find 
that if no other processes are ready to run that the "nice" value goes 
to over 99% as the system is now devoting nearly all of its CPU time to 
running the backup and compression processes since no other processes 
require any CPU time at a given moment in time.

I've run the distributed.net clients for years now and the client is 
reniced to 20 and only gets CPU time when there's no other processes 
that need to run. I don't even notice the client is running since it 
doesn't impact my system's performance. I do notice when my system 
isn't doing a whole lot that the "nice" value in top is up at 99.6%  
but that value goes down when other processes need to run.

It shouldn't be necessary to re-install Linux.  How the packages are
compiled depends largely on distribution and RedHat, for example,
compiles most of the packages to be compatible with i386, meaning your
Athlon will work just fine.  The only packages I can think of that does
such processor dependent code are a few media apps like XMMS (which may
do dynamic detection rather than a compile time option) and MPlayer
(which can do either) so it really shouldn't matter.

Awesome explanation, thanks.

That's the way it works for me, too. It is amazing how fast apache dispatches the 
requests.I can watch top and make 20 requests while it's backing up (to another 
HDD) and httpd pops up and drops off very quickly, even before the browser seems 
tohave all of the data. I guess thats the miracle of computers...

Subject: [PLUG] Network Guru Question
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20021113084436.0487e638@pop3.perturb.org>

I have two seperate IP networks on the same physical switch.  So for the 
boxes to talk to each other a router (their default gw) is needed.  On that 
router is ICMP Redirects which should be telling the boxes "If you need to 
talk to that IP, it's on the same network as you are so don't come ask me 
just go direct"

It seems to be work for my NT boxes.  If I ping the OTHER network from an 
NT box it pings and the route table updates itself to show the correct 
route for the other class.

If I ping it from a Linux box it pings, but does NOT update the route 
table.  Some digging shows that I need to tell Linux to accept ICMP 
redirects.

"echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/accept_redirects"

According to a Google search should turn on accepting ICMP redirects.  I 
have no way to verify if that worked because the route table STILL does not 
update.  A "route -n" doesn't show anything new.  So either it's not 
accepting the ICMP redirected routes, or the redirected routes are stored 
somewhere else.  Any idea where I might start looking?

Subject: [PLUG] Postfix Issues
Message-ID: <3DD28B0F.4010708@sun.com>

Hi all,

After having what I thought was a heat issue on one of my data drives, I 
moved my main fileserver from a P200 to a P3-533 in a bigger box.  There 
weren't any issues with the OS drive when I powered it all up, but for 
some reason, Postfix won't start.  I looked up the error via google, and 
found a hit or two, but the fix provided there didn't seem to fix my 
issues.  Here's what it's doing:

# /etc/init.d/postfix restart
Stopping mail transport agent: Postfix.
Starting mail transport agent: Postfixarguments:
/etc/postfix/post-install: Error: Usage: /etc/postfix/post-install 
[name=value] command
     create-missing          Create missing queue directories.
     upgrade-source          When installing or upgrading from source code.
     upgrade-package         When installing or upgrading from pre-built 
package.
     first-install-reminder  Remind of mandatory first-time 
configuration steps.
     name=value              Specify an installation parameter.
.

/var/log/mail.log shows the following:

Nov 13 09:14:42 belgarath postfix/postfix-script: warning: unable to 
create missing queue directories
Nov 13 09:14:42 belgarath postfix/postfix-script: fatal: Postfix 
integrity check failed!


So I'm suspecting the /etc/postfix/post-install script.  Running it by 
itself like so:

# /etc/postfix/post-install create-missing
arguments:
/etc/postfix/post-install: Error: Usage: /etc/postfix/post-install 
[name=value] command
     create-missing          Create missing queue directories.
     upgrade-source          When installing or upgrading from source code.
     upgrade-package         When installing or upgrading from pre-built 
package.
     first-install-reminder  Remind of mandatory first-time 
configuration steps.
     name=value              Specify an installation parameter.

Gives the same error as postfix.  I've tried removing the package, 
reinstalling, moving the postfix config directory (/etc/postfix) and 
reinstalling again, to no avail.

The googling I've done said that the post-install script had a missing 
'echo'.  I found that and performed the fix, but to no avail.

Using postfix version 1.1.11.0-3, Debian Unstable.

Thanks,

-R

As it has many folks. Unfortunately, that's the way of living on the
bleeding edge of computer software.

I agree. However, those who are too l33t for us that don't program seem
to look down their collective noses at us. 

Then Jeme and/or Karl comes up with some way that it's our fault that we
don't have the forsight to be interested in learning to program or write
a make file. 

Just because you CAN do a thing, does not necessarily mean you SHOULD do
a thing. 

I am very happy for those folks who choose to build a system from
scratch, building every binary from carefully inspected code to ensure
that they know exactly where every bit is and every bit is in its
place.

I'm not one of those folks, and I choose not to be. It's my choice.
Someone else is willing to put in the work, and I'm willing to support
them. If that means paying for a distribution that works when I install
it, so be it. I see no reason to learn how to be a plumber, beyond some
very basic knowledge. I'll let the plumber come and do that work. I'm a
Systems Administrator because I don't want to be a (insert any other job
here), and I enjoy what I do.

Some folks have entirely too much time on their hands.

I'll have to double check the Stevens TCP/IP Illustrated book, but it seems
to me that if the NT machines really are talking directly layer 2 to
devices that are not on the same network, then they're playing fast and
loose with the rules of IP.

ICMP redirects are sent to a source device by a router telling that
source device that there is another router _on the same network_ that
has a better route to the destination that the source device is trying
to reach. In your example, since you have two seperate layer 3 networks,
devices on one network should not communicate directly with devices on
the other network regardless of the fact that it's one layer 2 broadcast
domain.

MPlayer is great.  But I have always been on the lookout to figure out how
to use MPlayer as my media handler in Mozilla.  Has anyone found how to do
this?

It looks like maybe the permissions in /var/spool/postfix aren't set so
Postfix can manage the directories it needs?

Your /var/spool/postfix directory may be somewhere else, but that's where it
is on my FreeBSD machine...

Richard,

  I don't know if lack of a fully-qualified domain name when setting
up/starting postfix the first time would generate those errors, but it was a
slight stumbling block for me.

  Postfix wouldn't start (or install properly) until I changed the machine
name from 'salmo' to 'salmo.appl-ecosys.com'. Then postfix was happy. Once
it was idleing smoothly, I changed the uname back to simply 'salmo' so other
apps would again work. It's been fine since then, including putting it on a
different hard drive and upgrading to the latest version.

HTH,

Rich

Thanks Rob, I checked the perms, they looked okay.

I was pretty sure that the post-install script was the evildoer, so I 
went over to postfix.org and grabbed the source to the latest release. 
Unpacked it, found the post-install script and copied it over to my 
postfix directory.  Backed up the old one, and made the new one executable.

Ran 'post-install create-missing', and it finished without errors.

Restarted Postfix, no problems.

*shrug*

I don't know why Postfix picked on me last night, but it works now.

Thanks for the tips guys.

Wow, new heights of arrogance have been achieved Jeme!  Your anecdote

always thought you were home schooled because of your undeveloped social
skills.

What's so wrong with wanting software to "just work"?  NOT ONCE in my
entire life have I ever wanted software to be hard to install and get
working. It's pretty rare that I ever bother with software that doesn't
compile and run right out of the tarball.

A hearty hurrah for those that mine their own ore to smelt their own

sweaters when they're cold, hand roll their own distributions, etc -
great, start a cable access program on how to do it so you can

Cliff White tells me that the Open Source Development Lab has an opening

looking for. Essentially what they seem to be looking for would be a
"Senior Linux Admin". Sounds like a great opportunity for a PLUG member.

Have you tried adding it through the Helper Application section in
Edit-Preferences?  All you need to know is the MIME type and the
location of the executable.

Let us know if you get it to work.

Note that this is only for Bind 4 and 8. The doughnut goes to those who
have already upgraded to 9. And anyone who is still running 4 deserves

The X Window System packages probably replaced the init.d script or
changed the line in your inittab that launch the X server or XDMCP
display manager.  They are likely no longer being started with the
option that allows network connections.  If it's gdm, for instance, you
need to edit it's conffile and enable network connections to it.  Also
be sure that your netfilter rules allow connections to it's port from
the networks you wish to allow access.

The same thing may happen each time you upgrade, since the package
management system is apparently not capable of or not set up for keeping
settings like that for you across upgrades.  On a Debian GNU/Linux
system, this should be (but is not always set up to) handled by
"debconf".

So he produces a piece of software and then *gives* it to you and you bitch because it is not easy enough. Clearly they are writing code for people like themselves who know how their machines work and like to have control over them. In other words if you want something to just work use an app that is designed to work that way. Don't bitch because someone did not design their app to work the way you think it should. Better yet write a patch and give back to the others who want what you do. That way we all benefit.

Sub-note:

Versions of BIND 9 prior to 9.2.1 *are* vulnerable to a DoS attack,
and even 9.2.1 is vulnerable to a buffer overflow if you
./configure-ed it with the --enable-libbind option.

The problem is not that they are people that I pray are not out there 
developing commercial software that will ever be seen by a standard end-user, 
but that they are openly hostile to anyone that is critical of their 
software. If you don't want criticism, keep your code to yourself.

Certainly there are people out there that will whine to no end about it, but 
they are not the majority. Most of us are just noting deficiencies, and the 
response we get is juvenile at best. *Linus* doesn't give such absurd 
responses to /unwarranted/ criticism. I've yet to run into any project 
besides Mplayer that has such openly hostile developers. If they don't care, 
they can say "We don't care", or even just ignore everyone that complains. 
There's no cause to attack anyone.

Well I should have been more clear.  Let me make a crude diagram:

         R
         |
         S
       / | \
   T -/  |  \- P
   |     N
   G

R = Router
S = Switch
T,P = Servers (12.x.x.x)
G = Server (10.x.x.x)
N = NT Server (12.x.x.x)

T is acting as a router, two nics, ip_forward is on.

So if P tries to ping G they're NOT on the same subnet so it goes to its 
gateway (R).  R should reply with an ICMP redirect saying G is local on 
your network, talk to T to get to G.  Assuming ICMP Redirects allowed P 
should then route all its packets through T to get G.

All boxes are able to talk to each other, so it's not a network design 
problem.  Assuming that P does NOT accept ICMP redirects it should just 
make R do the routing for it.  In which R would route the packets to T 
instead of P going directly.

I have an NT server (N) that when it pings G it adds the route to the 
10.x.x.x network in it's routing table (route print).  Doing the same thing 
on P (route -n) shows now such route after it receives the ICMP redirect.

There has to be a way to show the route, I'm guessing it's not part of the 
regular route table.

When MS gives away the code for IE so that it could be fixed if someone wanted to then yes we should shut up and code. 

Think about the position these guys are in they write *great* code. They give it away. Then people complain because they might have to work a little to make it install on some system that they can't possibly test on. This is bound to lead to frustration. Let me give you a clue commercial software people call their users worse than this behind their backs. The point is they are being upfront. They can't test on every configuration known to man and to complain at them that you had to customize something in their code to work on a system they have never seen is lame. OTOH MS almost certainly can afford to and should test on a *very* wide varity of systems. Mostly because they can't/won't give us the code.

Use the mime type "video/*" and it works great.

Message-ID: <200211131134.53631.mark@linuxhardware.net>

I have been following this thread and think Linux is in a unique situation 
because of all the points mentioned.

For the new Linux "convert", installing an application from source, and 
encountering errors could be very daunting.  Especially if this user came 
from a Windows environment and just wanted to click on a file and have it 
play in something like Windows Media Player.  Having installation problems 
and then looking for answers only to be met with brusque responses would be 
disappointing, maybe enough to make this user abandon Linux althogether.

On the other hand, this software is free and is being developed by people on 
their watch.  They are giving it to the community, free for anyone to use.  
They can behave as they want, it is their project.  Developing free software 
and having to offer support for it can be very time consuming.

So where does that leave Linux from an advocacy point of view?  Encouraging 
folks to use Linux, only to have them become frustrated isn't going to help 
wide spread adoption.  But also criticizing the author of a free piece of 
software because of the developer's attitude or comments isn't going to help 
either.  

Is the middle ground the responsibility of the major distros?  I certainly 
don't know, but think it is an interesting position for Linux to be in.

Sounds like a great idea. Naturally, PLUG would be much more enjoyable
if only we had a some sort of central authority. All those
who like things just the way they are (status quo?) say "aye."

I certainly can't be the only one who notices the delicious irony

As I recall we have Mozilla. I stopped using IE on windows platforms months 
ago in favor of Mozilla. Both of my parents have subsequently been switched 
to Mozilla in their Windows environments. Why do we lose the right to 
complain only when IE's source is released, instead of when there's a 
perfectly functional alternative sitting right infront of us whose source IS 
availible? We inherently gain a right to complain because a product we CHOOSE 
to use doesn't do things our way?

It leads to frustration among developers of /all/ complex open source 
projects, but I don't see anyone but Mplayer openly attacking people.

Yes, some do. Some have been reprimanded and even fired for it, too. That, 
however, is not the point.

> The point is they are being upfront.

The point is they are being rude and hostile. "I don't know anything about 
YourRandomSystem" or, "I don't have time to deal with this issue", are good 
responses. "You are lame" is not. I reserve the right to complain about rude 
and hostile people.

That depends entirely on what kind of change was needed.

MS doesn't have to. They only provide IE for win32 and late-model Macs (they 
used to provide a version for HP-UX, I don't know if they still do).

Nobody is saying MPlayer's developers should spend obscene amounts of time 
testing every possible configuration. The complaint is that they are unduly 
hostile. There are two solutions to the problem:

1) MPlayer developers stop talking to users.
2) MPlayer developers grow up.

If they choose neither, then there will continue to be complaints about their 
attitudes, and they'll have to learn to live with it.

You misunderstand.  I did not mean government in the sense of "ruling
authority", but more in the sense of "representative body".  I see no
irony here.  What is it that causes you to see irony?

This sucks, we are forced into this even if we think it is a bad idea. How can
a sub group get together and say we're changing things without the whole group
first giving them the authority? Where did the authority for this sub group
come from? http://www.intriguing.com/mp/_sounds/hg/repress.wav

Can we have a open vote on this first to see if anyone wants to change the way
PLUG runs?  If this was discussed at a meeting and everyone voted there for
this then I think there should have been a write in vote as well. It should
have been well announced on plug-announce with out being part of a meeting
announcement as well.

There's a whole slew of config files in /etc/X11/xdm (where Red Hat
places the default display manager, kdm in my case).  Do you know which
one to look at and what to change?

This was the first time I've ever done this in reverse, I actually
"updated" from 8.0 to 7.3.  In previous installs and updates I've
had no problem.

I don't see any reason why people who do not like what is going on in PLUG
can't start their own user group.  There can be more than one Linux/Unix
group in Portland.  In fact it could just be an exclusive Linux only
group.  I for one would join.

Subject: [PLUG] Subject: Inet Connection Sharing (Mandrake 8.0 gateway, MDK 9.0 host)
Message-ID: <20021113195834.DF0352FEF8@joseph.doink.com>

Short Summary:  Mandrake Control Center connection sharing broke
		the ability to ping on my LAN.  Can you help?


Details:

I just got a used computer and installed Mandrake 9.0 on it;
call this my "slave" computer.  It's in the same room with my
main computer with Mandrake 8.0 on that; call this my "gateway"
computer.  Last night I configured the eth1 card in the gateway
to be 192.168.0.1 and eth0 in the slave to be 192.168.0.11 with
a gateway of 192.168.0.1.  Both have netmasks of 255.255.255.0.
Then I added name IP address associations in the /etc/hosts files
of both computers, followed by 'service network restart' as root.
At this point both computers could happily ping each other by
name.  Woohoo!

Next I took on the challenge of getting the gateway computer to
share its internet connection; eth0 on the gateway connects to a
DSL router/modem.  I fired up the Mandrake Control Center (MCC)
and followed the internet connection sharing wizard in expert
mode.

Now neither machine can ping the other.  The machine names still
resolve into IP addresses correctly, but I get this error:


PING slave.foobar.com (192.168.0.11) from 192.168.0.1 : 56(84) bytes of data.
>From gateway.foobar.com (192.168.0.1): Destination Host Unreachable


What went wrong!?!

MCC started up a dhcpd daemon serving out addresses
192.168.0.{16-253}.  That's fine, since the static IP for the
slave won't conflict with dhcpd's IP range.  MCC also configured
iptables for me -- and ipchains, but that only fires up for 2.2
kernels, and I'm using 2.4.18.  My iptables config looks like
this at the moment:


Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         
ACCEPT     udp  --  anywhere             anywhere           udp spt:bootpc dpt:bootps 
ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere           tcp spt:bootpc dpt:bootps 
ACCEPT     udp  --  anywhere             anywhere           udp spt:bootps dpt:bootpc 
ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere           tcp spt:bootps dpt:bootpc 
ACCEPT     udp  --  anywhere             anywhere           udp dpt:domain 
ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere           tcp dpt:domain 

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         
ACCEPT     all  --  192.168.0.0/24       anywhere           

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         



My hunch is that iptables is somehow blocking the connection
between the two machines.  But, I don't know how to confirm or
repair this.

Can anyone give me some hints?

Thanks....

Help! 
Don't make me go back to Slackware! 

I have: 
1) box with a nic of 192.168.1.2
2) box with a nic of 192.168.1.1 and a nic of 10.10.10.222

2a) the box (gilgamesh- maybe I should have given it a more tractable name) with the 2 
nics has this as it's route table:
[root at gilgamesh root]# route -n
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
10.10.10.0      0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth1

2b) This box has "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"

2c) Box one and two are connected by a crossover ethernet cable between the 2 nics of  
the 192.168.1.x network

3) I can't ping 192.168.1.1 from box one (the inside box) nor can I ping 192.168.1.2 from 
two (the external box) : the result is "destination host unreachable".

So obviously (to me) I'm having some sort of network routing problem. Both computers 
are running redhat 8.0.  

Suggestions would be helpful. 
Thanks.

I think it's an issue of pride and workmanship, and the target audience of the 
developer. If it's just a geek toy, it can have rough edges. If the author 
wants widespread adoption, it needs more polish, and good documentation. If 
you don't want users pestering you, write good instructions. Duh. (users need 
to have manners, too, I'm not excusing rudeness from anyone)

I love a good makefile, building from source doesn't have to be a nightmare 
and a horror. An example of a great makefile is in Snips, which is a dandy 
little network monitoring utility, 
http://networking.earthweb.com/netos/article/0,,12083_1487121,00.html 
(blatant self-serving plug alert)

The output of Snips' make is nicely formatted and readable. There's a lot of 
good information generated with any make, I really like the author of Snips 
for taking such care with the output, and even telling how to export it to a 
file for leisurely study.

Exactly right. I definitely have higher expectations for a commercial distro. 
If they ship it, it should work. No cost is no excuse for shoddy, either. 
Programmers can't have it both ways: they can't be all snippy and cranky and 
turn out lumpy applications, and expect people to like and use them. The 
whole point of the Linux model of development is to produce top-quality 
software. 

All users can contribute something- money, detailed feedback, bug reports, 
documentation. Expecting everyone to be a programmer is so silly it isn't 
even worth rebutting.

Mmmm. Yeah. I'd like to see at least an explanation of why this is a 
good idea.

Or do I have to join the other list to get that? (Also, maybe I missed 
something that was posted here. If so, mea culpa in advance.)

Why wouldn't you connect the two 192.168.1.X nics together?
That got my sys's going last night, until I tried adding IP forwarding.

They are connected via a crossover cable.  I will be needing port forwarding - but at this

crossover cables can give some flaky connections. Do you have
a hub you can temporarily test the system with?

Ok the crossover cable has been replaced with a powered on asante hub, with no 
change to the "destination host unreachable."  I've also learned about the /proc/sys/net/
ipv4/conf/eth1 (and eth0) directories; but that looks right.

the other, similar one is still "live".

I screwed around with the ethernet configuration so much I finally gave up and ran 
netconfig and configured for the internal lan - then on reboot disabled eth1 (which I was 
trying to configure for the internal lan) and rebooted. Mine's working now. I now move 
along to the portforwarding and firewalling portion of this process :) 

I thank you for your time.

Amen about the docs!  There are too many people who slap a interesting bit
of code together and release it on an unsuspecting world and then get
irritated that others don't appreciate their genius.

I'd add a caveat, though:  I like to see test suites included with software
packages.  I don't know why commercial software typically doesn't have "make
test" or similar facilities.  It would be nice to know *before* I decide to
install it if the code is going to cause my system to crash and burn.

Cheers,
Ovid

There's a difference between learning to program, and learning to solve
problems. 

I did, at one time, take a C++ class. Got an A in it. I can usually
decipher simple C and C++ code. I can write perl. 

I shouldn't have to to install an application on my machine that's
supposedly of a quality level that it's beyond beta.

Maybe that's why so many project in the OSC have a revision level of <1.

I prefer an open forum where the most "members" can see my objections.

2> Whom decided that we needed "representation"?

There are many other questions of why and what and how, but that's
enough for now.

I don't know why the formation of an organization is necessary.  Are we

So the authors know what release quality software is and are honest
about the quality of their product.  I believe most also offer a money
back guarantee :)

Anyone know if there are other groups that are coming? Are there any disabled
people that need help with downtown? The pub does have an elevator for the
second floor, but the area the pub is in, is not wheelchair friendly. Some
curbs have ramps around the newer construction but where the pub is, is pretty
old. Train tracks, cobble stone, lots of construction, small sidewalks, and not
much if and handicapped parking. Let me know if I can help.

Thank you
Russell

For any coming down to Portland for Friday's event, there is a Blazer game on
Friday that may cause a little traffic. The train station down town is about a
thirty minute walk from the pub, but some there are some bad areas between the
two. If there is going to be a few coming down, and you are willing to walk, I
will be happy to walk with you to the pub. I need to know when you are coming
in to meet you there. If I get only three responses or less I will drive the
people from the train station to the pub. 


The 2:33 PM train is sold out. So before or after.

Subject: [PLUG] GRUB won't boot
Message-ID: <3DD2DDD3.5050006@pacifier.com>

I screwed up last night and deleted to contents of my /boot partition.

Was able to boot into `rescue` mode and copy the missing files from another 
machine.  Problem is that grub is not happy.

When powered on, I get
GRUB

and it hangs.  This is an early-stage failure since it's not giving a error 
message.  I did make the relevant changes to grub.conf so it should know 
where to find my kernel.  At least with lilo, you could determine at what 
point it gave up by how many letters it spit out (LI, LIL)

Anyone know what grub is really trying to say?

Assuming your /boot and / partition is /dev/hda1 and your kernel name is
/boot/vmlinuz_2.4.19:

grub> root (hd0,0)
grub> setup (hd0)
grub> kernel /vmlinuz_2.4.19
grub> boot

That should get you booting again. Note that I have no idea what the
name of your kernel is (mine is vmlinuz_2.4.19). You may have to mount
your /boot partition using a rescue disk to find out.

The pub is only 15 blocks from the station, so I'd say 20 minutes or
less.  Portland blocks are small.  

There are two bus options. 
The #77 goes right by the pub.  $1.25  Pick it up at the corner of Hoyt & 
Broadway.
http://www.tri-met.org/schedule/r077.htm

The #17 runs on Glisan, leaving you with a 6 block walk north to Marshall.
The advantage of this is that it is free because you are traveling within
the fareless zone.
Pick it up at the corner of Glisan & Broadway.
http://www.tri-met.org/schedule/r017.htm


I would have to respectfully disagree with the implication that this
is an unsafe area to walk.  If walking, I would walk south from the
station to Hoyt, then west to 11th, then north to Lovejoy, then west
to 13th, then north to the pub.

I once heard someone say, "If something isn't broke, don't fix it."

Since plug doesn't appear broken, why do you wish to "fix" it into a 
a more broken state?

What does PLUG do besides arrange meetings and install parties?

OK, up to here, I agree with you.  We have an anarchic system and people
can and should be left to do whatever they please (though they also can
and should be encouraged to be courteous and helpful and hard-working and
self-actuating).  The new user has a responsibility to put as much time
and effort into learning as he possibly can and the developer has a
responsibility to provide the best software she possibly can.

Don't let them become frustrated.  Don't leave them in the hands of
developers who have no time for frustrated and frustrating newbies.

> But also criticizing the author of a free piece of software because of

Criticizing an author is one thing, whining is another.  If you provide
useful critical commentary, perhaps you can bring about positive change
(or encourage a meaningful code fork).  But if you just complain and want
someone to come be the magic code at the back of an "Install" button, then
you're not criticizing, you're bitching.

> Is the middle ground the responsibility of the major distros?

Absolutely not.  The middle ground is YOU.  If you encourage a convert,
follow up with them.  Help them.  Put them in contact with people who will
give sympathetic support (if you can't do it yourself, which should be
your first choice).

Conversion isn't just getting someone to try Free Software, it's
indoctrination into the community.  You are part of that community and the
closest and most personal part to your new convert.  You can help them
join a larger community when they're ready.  But take some of the
responsibility on yourself right now.

I realized that when I posted it. However, I also realize that these are
the types of questions that *SHOULD* be answered BEFORE discussions
start about what the origanization should look like. 

You don't start a company with a statement like, "OK, I'm CEO of *blah*
company, now, what do we do?"

I have this distinct impression of folks running off behind a curtain,
making plans, instituting changes, and then coming back to tell us what
changes have been made. All before we've decided if those changes needed
to be made in the first place. 

Who knows, it might be a good idea to make the changes. It just seems to
me that we're on step 5 already, and steps 1-4 haven't been taken yet.
Sort of like running make before you run ./configure or tar.

Please be patient as my upstream bandwidth is limited and there are

Yeah, I did something like that from the info pages, but it brought up the 
grub shell on boot--it wasn't finding my grub.conf file.

Then I got it to bring up the menu on boot, but it created /boot/boot/grub/
which I didn't want.  Per the info pages, this worked

grub> root (hd0,4)
grub> install /grub/stage1 d (hd0) /grub/stage2 p /grub/grub.conf

it's all good now.

This all started because my /boot partition is too small.  (Tip: Don't try 
to move /boot when it's mounted)

Now off to see if gpartd will resize partitions.


Cheers,
Kyle Accardi

Oops, that's `parted` and that's what it's designed for, but looks quite

I think these are very sage words and illustrate another advantage Linux has 
over the alternatives - a large, very knowledgeable community with a wealth 
of experience that is willing to lend a helping hand to those who need it. Of 
the few people who I have encouraged to switch to Linux, all are still happy 
users (3 years on now). I found that by not only being there when they hit 
the rough spots, but showing them how to find help, whether through Usenet, 
the Web, discussion forums or encouraging them to join the local LUG, gave 
them the tools they needed to solve whatever was thrown their way. Sometimes 
showing someone how to problem solve was a bigger challenge than explaining 
the concept of a boot loader. But to this day:

"Mark, how do I configure my new NIC?" 
"man ifconfig" 
"but it's easier to ask you!" 
"what are you going to do when I'm on vacation?" 
"Call you at your hotel, you will leave the number, right?"

LOL

Subject: [PLUG] Another GIMP filter question
Message-ID: <3DD305CD.21203E25@attbi.com>

I found the filter I want (LoG) and downloaded, and unzipped it.
Following directions I found at

http://www.graphics-muse.org/source/GFXMuse/GFXMuseTools/modified/logconv-1.2.1/docs/log.html

I tried to install it. configure seems to work, but I get error messages
with make about not being able to find gtk/gtk.h or libgimp/gimp.h. A
search of the system shows that indeed I don't have either of those
files on my Debian system. Do I need the developer version of GIMP in
order to add filters? Is there a way to get filters for GIMP installed
with apt-get?

Subject: [PLUG] RHN/Up-2-date applet missing from taskbar
Message-ID: <1037239812.3727.12.camel@localhost.localdomain>

I upgraded my Ximian evolution groupware package from 1.0.8 to 1.2.0 tonight
using Ximian redcarpet update tool for RH 8.0.  

I ended up rebooting the system after going into root from my regular
user name due to problems with the pop3 password.  When the system came back up, I noticed that the button for
the evolution email icon was missing from the left panel.  A blank space was
still there between the icon for the mozilla browser and open office
application.  

The last thing that I just noticed was that the applet in the taskbar
indicating the up2date/RHN status was missing.

What is going on?  Has anybody else seen this?

TIA,

Jim

I concur with Rich. I used it successfully when I discovered that I had
undersized a partition and had to shrink another one so I could expand
the small one.

I followed directions at:

Do ya suppose she used her home-rolled Linux installation to send and
receive emails so as to expedite her insider trading?

Will they let her bring her home-rolled Linux install to prison?

Sorry for ignoring the rest of your post, I'm a little pressed for time.

Is the filter you want in the gimp1.2-perl package?  That contains many
filters and perl support.  Other than that, I don't know what packages
exist in the stable tree.

  It was also in yesterday's "Oregonian". Unfortunately, it is an "opt-out"
list for which we victims must pay rather than an "opt-in" requirement for
which the spammer must bear the cost. I'll be contacting the AGs office
about this, as well as a couple of legislators I know.

I see a picture where US spammers are getting all those official "NO-SPAM"
e-mail registries and resell them to other spammers abroad.
We may see less spam floating within US but increased spam
from the outside world.
How would Oregon officials deal with foreign spammers?
Bomb their countries of origin? :)

:

There is a difference between bitching and -cautioning.- MPlayer might have 
rave reviews in some circles, but since it doesn't come in what I'll call a 
single-intent/single-action format, I was CAUTIONING that the install may 
require a bit more research and perhaps even a higher level of risk to one's 
computer system.

A good rule of thumb for user interface design is that if you can descibe 
what you want to do in a human language, then the number of actuation steps 
it should take should equal the number of verbs in that phrase.

So, since this thing is available only as a tar.gz, then it is simply THE 
TRUTH to say that 'the install in NOT straightforward,' and 'that can be a 
show-stopper for many users.'

: Your response reminds me of a time in my high school chemistry class ...

Neat. I didn't know that installing something to be used for FUN was supposed 
to feel like a chemistry test. Actually, that was EXACTLY the problem I was 
trying to bring out. Remember, we're talking about a program written for 
playing ENTERTAINMENT files. (Hint: Most people don't find learning what to 
do with a 'tarball' ENTERTAINING.)

If -you- do, that's great, but it's still a FACT that MOST people DON'T. To 
say so is NOT indicative of an attitude problem on my part. (Nothing of the 
foregoing is a reflection on willingness or ability to learn, mind you, it's 
a statement of how accessible something is, as assessed by and for 'regular 
folks.')

:
: Well, if you're not making any effort, you may as well be lame.

False. First of all, you don't know what efforts I -have- made. Second, do 
you seriously believe that learning curves are the spice of life, and that 
every intent, even in leisure, ought to be tested in an arduous cruicible of 
success versus failure, of blood, sweat, toil, study, and tears?

I don't, so my opinion is: "Yeah, but it doesn't install with a double-click 
and the website mentions security problems which you have to be a computer 
networking expert to understand. So, MPlayer in its currently available form 
is probably -NOT- ready for most users. And, incidentally, the authors of the 
website have even contrived a derogatory term for a majority of good people 
who might otherwise be interested in trying out their program" (they just 
happen to be good at other things, like my vet down the street. This guy is 
-NOT- 'lame' by any means.)

I know a man with a lathe in his garage. He bitched and cussed (in a friendly 
way - I love working with machinists) about how they wanted $8 at Freddy's 
for a hose coupler to convert pipe thread to garden-hose thread, when 'any 
dork' can turn one up in brass.

I guess everybody else who doesn't do this is somehow deficient on the 
evolutionary scale, right? Don't know the taper angle for standard pipe 
thread? Then I guess you're an idiot, right? After all, it's on page 1659 in 
my 24th ed. of "Machinery's Handbook." (c.1992) I mean, geez, it's a
standard so I thought that EVERYBODY already knew that. It's been the same 
value for at least 70 years, mind you. (p. 871 in "Mechanical Engineer's 
Handbook, 3rd Ed." Lionel S. Marks, 1930. I would have checked my 2nd Ed 
dated 1919, but that's currently on diplay in an engineering museum in 
Salem.) What, are you too lazy to look it up? I just did so twice. What's 
wrong with you?

: change your behavior to be less lame.
I already did that.

I don't know. It's available at http://registry.gimp.org/plugin?id=342
in the form of: logconv-1.2.1.tar.gz. I tried following the directions

Linux is not UNIX.

"UNIX" refers to the operating system originally developed by the AT&T 
Bell Labs and its partners. The UNIX code is copyrighted and is in no 
way Free. The UNIX trademark is currently managed by The Open Group:

  http://www.unix-systems.org/

Linux is a UNIX workalike. It emulates the UNIX system calls, libc
base, the "everything's a file" philosophy, POSIX specs, and many
other traits -- but there is no UNIX code in Linux, nor has The Open
Group certified Linux under any of its UNIX standards.

Scott,

Linux is indeed a clone of Unix. Unix was ``invented'' by Ken Thompson
after Bell Labs left the Multics project, originally so he could play
games on his scavenged PDP-7. Dennis Ritche, inventor of the ``C''
programming language is considered the coauthor of the system.

 The term 'Unix' was a play on words the creators used to describe it as
a clone of Multics, a multi-user platform. It is ironic that the systems
we now hold has the bellweather for multi-user platforms was originally
a single user platform!

Over time, two distinct versions, or `flavors' of Unix developed: System
V and BSD, note however that there were still considerable
cross-influence between them. 

Until the early 80's, that was it: basically two flavors of Unix. Then,
seemingly out of nowhere, a proliferation of new computer companies
brought several versions of new UNIX systems to the market. Worse, many
of their enhancements were kept proprietary. Soon administrators found
that a script working on one system did not work on another. Unix
forked.

Everyone now knows the story of how Torvolds wrote a rudimentory kernel
for the Intel platform and released it under a liscence develeped by
Stallman, the GPL.

Linux is a clone of Unix, but it has several key differences that make
it so exciting.

First, Linux combines the most popular features of the prior Unices and
melds them into a really usable system. I personally, for example, have
never really liked System V's printing commands, opting instead for the
BSD style.

Second, Linux is totally open source. This makes it nary impossible for
any single vendor to take the code and run away with it.

Third, Linux supports a wide variety of hardware platforms from Intel,
to Sparc, to PowerPC and others. This makes it possible to take a
program's source code from an Intel box and 

Finally, Linux is just cool; it supports most of the hardware available
for the x86 architecture, no small feat indeed.

Did you run oad-slay and/or killev after upgrading to 1.2? You might
still have some processes left over from your 1.0.8 install still
running.. That could cause problems 1 and 3..

Originly UNIX was delivered wit the source code and BSD is directly
derived from AT&T UNIX and is open source.

I was thinking exactly the same thing.  Compile together a great list of
email addresses and publish it with the stipulation:  You can't spam
these people.

Uh-huh.

"UNIX" is a registered trademark of X/Open, and no OS can technically be
called UNIX without their permission. Also Linux is not based directly on
the source code from the original version of UNIX, unlike FreeBSD,
Solaris, HPUX, Chord, or Xenix.

Like minix, linux (a kernel) is described as unix-like because it
implements UNIX interfaces and takes a Unix-like approach in its design.
To be accurate, Linux is not a version of Unix because it is not patterned
from the Unix codebase.

1. UNIX(tm): the original Bell labs Unix.

2. Unix version: HPUX, Solaris, Xenix, Chord, BSD. ("True Unixes")

3. Unix-like: Linux, minix.


HTH,

Tyler

At one time BSD Unix had AT&T Unix code in it but as I recall all of the 
AT&T code was eventually removed from the BSD sources because of the 
licensing issues this caused.

As a guy that has used a number of different Unix systems over the last 
19 years all I can see is Linux feels like Unix. I didn't have any 
problems configuring and using Linux when I first installed it and may 
of the same files were used to configure the system just like many of 
the Unix systems I had worked on. 

The biggest thing for me was that Linux changed my perception of the 
Intel platform. I found that it could be run for months or even years 
with out a crash. Up until my first taste of Linux I had only used DOS, 
Windows, OS/2, and WinNT on Intel platforms and none of those systems 
were that resistant to crashes. OS/2 and WinNT were better than DOS and 
Window 3.x but I saw my share of BSOD on NT and OS/2 had alot of 
problems with GUI lockups because of the way Presentation Manager  
handled its input queue.

The freely available BSDs are also quite good although they don't 
necessarily have the level of hardware support Linux has. Many of the 
BSDs also support multiple hardware platforms just like Linux. I have 
found that many programs are easily compiled under BSD with the same 
"./configure", "make", "make install" steps I've used under Linux.

Why not make it legal to attack the offender's systems?  Or we could use the 
technique of England against Spain and commision privateers who would have 
the right to retaliate against the systems of spammers.

Oh, I don't know. The guy that always has something along the lines of:

   No, one more time, I do NOT need your "leadership", sir.
   Please just GET OUT OF MY WAY.                                .''`.

in his sig suddenly deciding we need to have some sort of steering
committee to make this club work the way someone thinks it ought
to?

As to your distinction between "ruling authority" and "representative
body," that's little more than a matter of degree. Besides, who made the
decision that the membership wants, or even needs, "representation?"

Wow. Creating a brand new OS just so you can game on some second-hand

Computer systems were incredibly expensive back in those days and so it 
was probably cheaper to write your own OS to get the functionality you 
needed. :) 

Years ago I once worked with a guy that was proud of the fact that he 
had a PDP-8 in his home. I don't think he used it much anymore but he 
said it still booted and ran.

See http://www.robotwisdom.com/linux/timeline.html

Here's a description and some real examples of "Letters of

Well, we've been picking on Karl for a day now, but I suspect
the "plug-org" idea does have merit.  There is definately a
core of volunteers in PLUG doing a lot of work: web site, mail
list maintenance, scheduling meetings, holding clinics ...
This year, we've had discussion on bringing high profile
speakers to Portland, and recently the RedHat Road Trip.
IIRC, a couple of years ago, there was talk about holding
a Linux convention in Portland.

These things take time and organization.  If those who are
actually doing the work need/want a mechanism to communicate,
and not bore the rest of us with tedious details, (hey, I've
more than enough tedious details in my own life that y'all
don't want to know about) I say "go for it!".

The reality is PLUG does have an steering committee (or, if
you prefer "cabal", "inner circle", "secret council" :-) ).
They are the guys/gals getting things done.  And, I must say,
they've been doing a pretty damned good job.  I certainly get
a lot of benefit from PLUG ... and I don't do squat!  (Well,
I try and answer at least one question for every one that I
post ... but that's pretty minimal in exchange for all the
other goodness this group makes available.)

My comments/suggestions for "plug-org" are:

   * Make any proceedings/notes open [for reading] to all.

   * Public write access is not necessary.  If one of us lurkers
     really has a serious itch, we will have e-mail addresses
     of the partcipants, and we'll just have to lobby the
     individuals to accept our idea.  Or ... we put our own
     butts on the line, and join the group!  Our organizors
     put their reputation on the line by taking responsibility
     for keeping the meetings/clinics going, making sure the
     pdxlinux.org servers work, etc.  And they do it as
     volunteers.

   * It might be a good idea to write up an informal charter
     that plug-org and plug-er's can review to remind ourselves
     why plug-org exists.

I too missed Karl's original post.  Going back an re-reading it,
he is right.  If we are ever to become ambitious enough to try
and host a convention (at least to host as "PLUG") we will need
some quasi-legal proof of existance -- you know, the ability to
sign agreements for leasing expo space, etc.

I am dismayed though, that his e-mail to PLUG occurred *before*
the infrastructure (web page and mailman config) were ready.

... ok, I yield the soapbox to the our next distinguished speaker ...

Dropping the compression rate won't improve your idle time.  The "--fast"
compression will still use 100% of the CPU available to it, but will do so
for a shorter period of time.

I think the best networked tank game I ever played was one written in GL 
called "bz" that we ran under IRIX. It was like Battle Zone but it was 
in 3D color and we had to capture the other teams flag. All of the 
developers in the group I worked in had SGI boxes on their desks and we 
would sometime stay late of Fridays playing in two teams. 

We even went so far as to hack the code to make the gun projectiles 
fired by our tanks twice as fast as normal so we could beat the team 
that was unbeatable! There was now way our opponents could ever move 
fast enough to get our of the way in time.

Yea it was bad that we cheated but the other team was impressed at our 
craftiness. :) Later on with enough practice we were good enough that 
we could win a few games now and then due to our skill at the game. :)

HP-UX, Solaris, AIX, SCO OpenServer and UnixWare are all derived various 
System V codebases, so they are in fact "UNIX" by this definition.  They 
  also pay a nice license fee to use the term "UNIX" to whomever owns 
the trademark now (SCO, I think).

BSD is another story, you can read up on it at the BSD Complete FAQ, at 
http://nakedape.cc/info/bsd-complete.faq.html#0.1

When I ran BSD only, I though that Linux had better support for newer
hardward, soundcards and the like.  When I started running Linux I found
that was not universally true, that there was no way to predict which
had better support and it seemed that things were pretty equal.

as for the AT&T code being removed, I view that rather like a "seed"
crystal around which BSD grew, the fact that the original "seed" has
been replaced does not change the shape of the crystal :), but then
again, what is UNIX is a matter of opinion, in my opinion.

And Kleenex is (or was) a trademark, and Asprin was trademark.  As a
private citizen I am entitled to my opinion and if there is no essential
difference between two items, I see no need to make a distinction just
because some fool has paid millions of dollars for the rights to some
word.  UNIX is as UNIX does.  Having worked with UNIX* for some 20 years
kernel and user-space I feel entitled to my opinions, I don't feel
lawyers or courts are entitled to an opinion on this matter.

Unix systems I have worked on.

SuSE 8.1 has mplayer packaged. If its not on the personal cd set it is on the
ftp server for you to grab. I'm not sure if you can use the package on RH but
it might be worth a try. This are the other package requirements as best that I
can tell.

I used this to find the requirements. I might have missed something.

Thanks for the reminder, add Dynix/PTX I don't count AIX as UNIX :)

Scott,

  They are UNIX-like, or 'unices'. When you buy (or drive) a car, you find
all the expected pieces in the same places: clutch on the left, brake in the
middle, accelerator on the right; drive on the left, wheels on each corner,
etc. Brand doesn't matter -- to the functioning of the vehicle, that is.

  Same with the unices. They all work pretty much the same. Some have power
windows (oops! a pun!), others have hand cranks. Some have the fuel tank
opening on the left, others on the right. Paint schemes differ, too. But,
they're all working the same where the bits meet the wire.

  From the perspective of one who worked on mainframes (primarily CDC,
Burroughs, and IBM S/360) and minis (HP-3000, Prime, DEC/System 10, and the
odd PDP-ll/750 and VAX), I gotta' say what you all neglected to write: that
linux has put the FUN back into working on a PC. DOS was OK, but not as good
as CP/M, windows I always thought was a dog, but linux ...? It's happy time

Subject: [PLUG] perl question
Message-ID: <1037320113.18207.4.camel@atlas.subnet.gotdns.org>

I am trying to rename a bunch of files in a directory into a consecutive
pattern.  That was pretty easy, however I am trying to name them in
order of the mtime of the file.  I have been messing around with
File::stat, but this is above my knowledge of perl.  I am reading the
llama book now but this problem just cropped up.  I also was reading the
man perlfunc pages.  If one of you more talented types could help me out
or point me in a different direction it would be greatly appreciated. 
Looking forward to meeting a bunch of you tomorrow.

thanks,

VAXes were fun so long as they had BSD or DEC Ultrix on them. :-) I did 
do my share of work under VMS though too. I did think DOS was a bit of 
a step up from plain old CP/M-80. My CP/M machine was a 6MHZ Z80B 
system with 64K of memory. My DOS system which I got later on had 640K 
and later versions of DOS included support for subdirectories and stuff 
which was something my old CP/M-80 system didn't have. 

I do believe there were some much more functional versions of CP/M that 
came out later on that supported concurrent users and stuff but I had 
already moved on to Unix by that time and was out of the loop. I had 
endless hours of fun with CP/M and taught myself 8080 and Z80 assembly 
language when I had the system. 

Later on Borland's Turbo Pascal was available for CP/M and it was 
offered quite inexpensively that I was able to afford a copy even 
though I was a poor college student at the time. :)

to assume that it is the same game. It looks alot more sophisticated 
now. When I was playing it the battleground looked like a moon with 
hills and large boulders. I was playing this game back in a 1994-95 
timeframe.

In looking at the logfile information in the screen shots it brings back 
alot of fond memories. I can still here people scream in the office 
when their tank got killed. :)

We also had another game called "Battalion". It had some cool graphics 
and had monsters like Godzilla and Mothra. You fought against tanks, 
helicopters and other stuff. It was cool to shot the tanks as they sort 
of melted into slag. There was even a red and silver man-like enemy 
that looked like a crude rendering of Ultra Man. 

Looks like Battalion is still around and is available for Linux. It 
looks alot different than I remember:

Your explanation settles any misgivings I can think of. I lack the time (and inclination to drive to Portland) to attend many meetings or clinics. If a core group wants a seperate forum to discuss matters that rarely concern me (and that I don't contribute to) so be it.

I remember working on a 68000 based S100 based system that ran System V 
Rel 1.5. It was from a company called Dual that was in Berkeley, CA. 
The systems had these amazing 80MB Fujitsu hard drives that had a 
repretation of lasting nearly forever. 

The systems where purchased in 1983/4 timeframe and were still running 
24/7 in 1991 with the same hardware when I left the company. The only 
changes over those 7 years was some additional memory to support more 
users and ethernet cards so we didn't have to use UUCP to transfer 
files between systems anymore. 

The system held a patient billing system on a Unify database and the 
drives were thrashed pretty hard twice a month with the billing cycles 
and report generation that was done.

  Take a look at how many Okidata dot-matrix printers are still working in
retail stores and other places after 20 years. Hardware used to be well
made. Many systems are still running but the companies that designed and
built them failed. What lesson do we gain from this?

I certainly can't swear to the accuracy of this, but according to my copy of Absolute BSD the "seed" of contention between AT&T and Berkeley amounted to half a dozen files when things were settled.

Subject: [PLUG] Shutdown won't power down
Message-ID: <20021115014814.3C4812FEF8@joseph.doink.com>

I've checked the usual suspects:

 - APM is configured in the kernel
 - APM is configured in the AmiBIOS on my Tyan Titan (S1571)
   motherboard.

Still, none of 'shutdown -h', 'halt', 'halt -p', nor
shutdown/halt from the graphic display will power off my
computer.  It just goes through the shutdown process and where
the last thing to print to the screen is:

    Halting.
    Power down.

Then it just sits there powered up and doing nothing.  How can I
get this to power off?

I'm running Mandrake 9.0 on this Pentium I MMX 233MHz system.

Thanks....

The short answer is that I had to reboot the gateway computer, in
spite of restarting necessary services, which I would hope MCC
would have done for me anyway.

In a related topic, if I turn off my client PC, and then
subsequently turn it back on, then I have to restart my "network"
service, or network traffic just won't go there.  Anyone know why
this would be?  Rebooting the client PC without powering it down,
does not cause this trouble.

Thanks...

I don't see how you folks could call those things "minis". From that photo
of Kernighan and Ritchie, it looks like the PDP-11 takes up half the room!

Pentium 1? For that era, it is most likely an AT power supply rather
than an ATX. AT power supplies have a "hard" switch and cannot turn
themselves off.

  Could the box have a time delay switch that needs to be disabled? I know
this is a stretch: my box requires one to hold the power button in until it
finally recognizes that I really mean it. OTOH, when I issue, 'shutdown -h
now' it does so.

That's why they were called "minis," they only took up half the room. 
(Actually, one or two full racks, plus another rack for each tape drive 
or a half-rack for a removable disk pack.)

Hm, that it's better to make shittier products and charge more for them? 
  Nah, I don't think that's really accurate.  Lots of things happened in 
the business orgy of the 1980's that screwed a lot of things up. 
(Didn't someone once say that the sixties were about free love; the 
seventies were about free sex; but the eighties were just about getting 
screwed?  Probably not, since I just made it up.)

You forgot Coherent and Interactive as well. I think Coherent just 
disolved at one point and Interactive was sold to Kodak and then to Sun

It still tickles me that the Unix Behemoth created by ATT is now owned by a 
small linux company Caldera...  Who is releasing some of the code open source.

Switch, hub, or cross over cable?

Switch or hub, it could be a 10/100 auto negotiation issue. Manually setting
the client's Ethernet speed, 10 or 100 and mode, half or full, might solve the
issue.

If cross over cable, when the client powers off, the Ethernet link would go
dead. Your firewall, if you have one, might not allow connections until it was
was restarted after the link comes back up. Also routing might be automatically
disabled in the event of link loss and only restarted when you restart your
network.

If you are using a cross over cable and the client is a newer box with WOL,
wake on LAN, then turning it on should leave the Ethernet link intact when the
client is powered down but not unplugged.  

Thank you

yes, but that was after most of the "seed" had already been removed,
early BSD's were just a set of patches.  BSD 4.4 evolved slowly over the

He's entitled to his opinion, but I suspect I've seen more AT&T code

How about this in bash:

  j=1 ; for i in `ls -1tr` ; do echo $i $j ; j=$(($j+1)) ; done

The "echo" is there as a placeholder to show what is in each
variable.  When you've got them how you want them, replace it with
"mv".

By far finest dot matrix printers I ever used were the DEC Writer IIIs. 
With a 1200 bps connection they were reasonably fast and were 
absolutely fantastic for multi-part forms. One place I worked at picked 
up a number of them for almost nothing from the local community college 
that had them collecting dust in the basement. I saw a number of 
businesses continue to use the DW IIIs even after laser printers were 
pretty much the norm then.

I guess the lesson would be that if a company makes something very well 
that never breaks they'll have a hard time staying in business since 
there isn't alot of revenue to be made on replacement parts and/or 
repeat business from customers.

Hi, 

Stat is the way to go:

$mtime=(stat($filename))[9];

then put it in a hash:

$all{$filename}=$mtime;

then sort it:

foreach $g(sort { $all{$a} <=> $all{$b} } keys %all){
print "$all{$g} $g\n";
#and do some noodling around here as well.
}

hope this helps.  

Mark

I have a couple of ATX P1 boards.  The last iterations of the P1's would 
allow higher bus speeds (75/83+), ATX form factor, PC100 DIMMS, etc etc.

OK so ignore the P1 part of the question I have almost identical kernel/BIOS settings with a brand new AMD based box. Mostly I don't mind but my wife would like the auto shutdown. So does anyone have any thoughts on how to implement from this point?

In the PLUG announcement for the clinic, it said 1-4pm.  On
the website it says 11-5.  Which is it?

Is this a service on your server?  What is the error that you are
getting, server not found, or page not found?

The most likely suspects are /etc/apache/httpd.conf (or the config file
for your web server) or your DNS is not pointing to the web server.

HTH a little anyway.

As if that matters...

My point is, that if people start calling is "UNIX", and that becomes
common, then someone will be sued by the folks that own the copyright on
the term UNIX. 

Regardless of your, my or anyone elses opinion, that's the law of the
land. 

That's also why the folks at GNU and Linus all say that it's not "Unix",
but it is a "Unix-workalike". That's as close as you can legally get
without stepping into potentially scalding water. 

This is especially important for those of us that actively support and
advocate the use of Linux. If we "sell" the use of Linux as "a form of
Unix", then we are opening ourselves up to being sued by the copyright
holders. 

In addition, the copyright holder (as I'm sure you are aware) is
REQUIRED to defend his copyright. If he doesn't, he loses it. So, you
are really asking to be sued by purporting Linux to be a UNIX, when in
fact, the creator and distributors of said product states that it is not in fact, a UNIX.

I've seen boards that have both AT and ATX connectors (the FIC 503+
comes to mind)  usually designed for the AMD processors that still used
the socket 7 pinout.  Most of these could run up to 100Mhz front side
bus.  Some of these could take either SIMMS or DIMMS for memory too.

Well, the question still stands - is it an ATX or AT
powersupply/motherboard?

If it is AT, then nothing you do will let it automatically shut down. 
If it is an ATX, then we may be able to figure something out.

My neighbor had a Socket 370 board with an AT-Style Keyboard connector. 
  I think the PS was ATX, but the combination was odd, to say the least.

The web site is for normal clinics. The road tour is a special event so
we extended the hours. It will take all the extra time to give away all

This is probably not the answer you are looking for, but I "fixed" by
powerdown by selecting the "use real mode to power down" option while
configuring my kernel (I always compile a kernel for each system that I
install).  Make sure that you select the "enable APM on boot" as well.

This option is probably enabled in most pre-compiled kernels, but the
"enable APM on boot" is not.  To enable APM on these kernels, you need
to have your bootloader tell the kernel to turn it on.

Good Luck

That is most likely what I was looking for. Since I'll be building a new kernel tonight, kernel-package just makes it to fun and easy and I *love* to see it compile on my new box, I'll try that thanks.

Try 'noapic'  at the boot prompt and then try a poweroff once the box boots. If
it works then add noapic to the append line. 

Thank you

This is my motherboard:

It's described as AT like, or AT2.  I don't see ATX
anywhere.

It looks like I need to recompile my kernel with "use real mode
to power down" and "enable APM on boot".

Thanks....

I've got a system with an Asus SP97V mobo and it has both AT and ATX 
power supply connectors on the board. It does have a AT style keyboard 
connector but it did come with a PS/2 style connector for converting 
one of the onboard serial ports to a PS/2 connector. 

A little strange to say the least and I've always used an AT power 
supply on the thing even when replacing the old power supply with a new 
one. I was surprised to find I could still find new AT power supplies. 
I don't know how I could use an ATX power supply on the thing unless 
those power supplies fit in an PC/AT case. More importantly...without a 
PS/2 style keyboard connector and, DB25 and DB9 connectors mounted on 
the back of the board I don't see how I can put this mobo into an ATX 
case.

According to the picture at that URL, it has only an AT power connector.
If that's actually the case, then you won't be able to have it auto
power off. The motherboard has nothing to do with it. 

Manually turning off the power supply is the only way to accomplish a
complete shutdown.

Not unusual, just not common. :)

I've built several computers over the last 4 years or so that had ATX cases
that came with a special insert for that type of motherboard. The insert
only had the keyboard hole in it, and that had a knockout so you could
make the hole bigger if the MB had the AT style keyboard socket. 

I think I've still got some of those inserts lying around, as I've never
actually used them. I was building computers with ATX motherboards, so I
used the other insert that came with the case.

Actually this is a different problem.

Turn off APM.

Turn on ACPI.

I have the same problem with my Dual Athalon 2100+ MP.  The default 
install of Redhat sees enough of ACPI to think that APM is there and stops 
looking.  (Probably because ACPI is brain-damaged on some motherboards.)

One of my older ATX cases has an insert for the rectangular IO 'hole' 
that has a AT-Style keyboard hole, and that's it.  I don't think any of 
the newer ones I've bought have that insert, although they may be 
available from the manufacturer after the fact.

Looking at the picture, there is only an AT power connector, you will
always have to hit the power button to power this board down.  It is the
way the power supply is designed.

The ATX power supply and the AT power supply usually (I say this because
some OEM's have proprietary power supplies) have the same case size and
mounting holes.  To convert your case from AT power to ATX power, all
you need is a push button switch (normally open, momentary push to
close) that you can connect to the appropriate pins on the motherboard. 
The tricky part is usually finding a switch that looks like it belongs
to the case, but that is only a matter of aesthetics.

                    Tux Fights Bux for the Soul of India

   Thursday, November 14, 2002--I worked in radio back during that
   industry's Jurassic, when disc jockeys still picked the music and it
   was okay for everybody to have fun. Even commercial stations were
   about as corporate as the corner bar.

   My best years were spent at WDBS, a commercial "progressive" rocker
   incongruously owned but not operated by Duke University. Its operators
   were a bunch of deeply committed and barely organized folks who, in
   retrospect, resembled the free software and open-source cadres of
   today.

   With no profit motive and the lousiest signal on the dial, we had a
   hard time selling advertising. So we'd make up ads for things that
   didn't exist and run those instead. Many were by a weird announcer
   named Doctor Dave. That was me. My nickname today is a fossil remnant
   of that old radio persona.

   We ran ads for Bangweasel Stone & Rubber Company, Mumbling Pines
   Apartment Village and Wellington Raffelators. In many cases the actual
   nature of the business was left unrevealed. "If you need a pipe
   cleaned or a zipper laid, we'll do the job for you... remember you
   can't take a customer without taking his money."

   One fake ad with a recognizable purpose pushed a record collection
   that consisted of "All the world's most beautiful music, all at once."
   The listener was then treated to an overdubbed blast of countless
   simultaneous music selections.

   That's kind of the way I feel about the current news about the
   conflict between Microsoft and Linux in India, where Bill Gates is
   touring right now, causing free PR for Linux wherever he goes.

   Still, I've managed to put together a chronology of Our Story So Far.
   If it reads like a series of dispatches from The Front, well... maybe
   it is.

     * October 10 - The Inquirer:
       http://inquirerinside.com/?article=5767 writes "India Moving to
       Linux", explaining things this way:

     India's government Department of Information Technology has
     announced a sweeping initiative (the Linux India Initiative) to
     move the entire country to Linux as its "platform of choice"...

     The plan is to establish Linux in Indian academic institutions as
     well as throughout central and state government offices. India's
     business sector also is likely to move to Linux for its lower costs
     and to employ the Linux skills developed in the large Indian IT
     workforce.

     As a developing country, India feels the bite of expensive
     proprietary software licenses much more acutely than other
     countries with mature economies. Enforcing intellectual property
     rights--as India has pledged to do--will spur its takeup of Linux
     open-source software.

     * November 11 - Business World India runs "The War for India's
       Software Soul":
       http://www.businessworldindia.com/cover1.htm. An excerpt:

     The battle has spilled over into India. Look around. There are
     noises being made about how proactively the government is
     considering Linux. The Supreme Court has a few pilot projects
     underway. So have High Courts in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The
     Central Excise Department has moved 1,000 desktops to Linux. The
     Delhi Road Transport Office (RTO) has implemented a pilot [program]
     to examine its viability. C-DAC, the government's supercomputing
     arm, has moved lock, stock and barrel to Linux.

     Then there is the National Stock Exchange - among the early
     adopters who used Linux to implement a solution unique to stock
     exchanges anywhere in the world. Corporates like Asian Paints and
     IDBI are cheerleading the free source OS. Others like Reliance,
     Texas Instruments, the Times of India group (publishers of The
     Times of India), Raymond, Bombay Dyeing, Godrej Infotech, HDFC
     Bank, Hindustan Dorr Oliver, Central Railways and Air-India have
     deployed Linux to power at least a part of their backends.
     At premier educational institutions like the Indian Institute of
     Technology, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and Bhabha
     Atomic Research Centre, Linux exists - de facto. Those not on the
     bandwagon, are slowly getting onto it. To get a sense of that, step
     into the Sardar Patel Engineering College in Andheri, Mumbai.
     You'll find people like Dinesh Shah, Trevor Warren and Harsh Busa
     of the Mumbai Linux Users Group (MLUG) bubbling with enthusiasm. On
     weekends, they spend time at educational institutions across the
     country spreading the gospel of Linux in neatly slotted two-day
     workshops. In Maharashtra, the clamour for their workshops has gone
     up because the government made Linux mandatory to their curriculum,
     beginning this year. "Catch them young and watch them grow," says
     Trevor gleefully.

     Just weeks before Mr Gates' impending arrival, officials in India's

     an effort called the Linux India Initiative. It is meant to promote
     Linux for use in government departments and corporations.

     The world's richest man, on the third day of his trip to India,
     didn't bring any gifts, but instead delivered a sales pitch in the
     nation's technology capital. More than 1,000 software companies are
     based in Bangalore.

     Gates, who said on Tuesday that his firm would invest $400 million

       http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/95307_india13.shtml opens
       their story along pretty much the same lines:

     NEW DELHI, India--Hoping to stave off a rise in the popularity of
     free, open-source software, Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates
     announced yesterday a $400 million investment in India to expand
     the company's operations and boost computer literacy.

     * November 13 - The Financial Express:
       http://www.financialexpress.com/fe_full_story.php?content_id=21608
       writes that Gates "ducked a couple of Linux-related questions"
       before "replying to a pointed questions on Linux" with a dig at
       Sun. "There is a visible shift in UNIX space from Sun platforms to
       Linux. In fact, it is Sun which is losing market share to Linux,"
       Gates said.

   Meanwhile, the grass roots grow deeper and wider on the subcontinent.
   Linux Bangalore, for example, is pushing its Linux Localization
   Initiative:
   http://lli.linux-bangalore.org--the kind of quiet and steady purpose
   that will cause countless Linux victories on fronts no publication
   covers.

   Actually, I doubt it's a battle either side will lose. It's a big
   country. There is an awful lot of work--a majority of it,
   probably--that can only be done on highly capable, flexible, reliable
   and cost-free platforms. That's a "threat" that Microsoft can't do a
   thing about, no matter how much money they throw at it.

I guess I'll have to see if I can find such an insert as it would be 
nice to go with an ATX case and power supply since all of my other 
systems are ATX based. My little old Socket 7 system is not that fast 
and so it makes a perfect gateway/firewall system that I hope to keep 
alive for many years to come. 

Because it's a critical system I'm forced to keep a spare PC/AT power 
supply and CPU cooler on hand for it.

Subject: [PLUG] FTC targets deceptive spam
Message-ID: <20021115132242.B17029@kippered.herring.org>

http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/privacy/story/0,10801,75880,00.html

ObTeaser:   Yesterday, the FTC said in a statement that it had filed three
            more complaints against three spammers and settled with four
            others who used spam to promote chain e-mail schemes and were
            caught in an FTC sting. 

            [...]

            Chris Hoofnagle, legislative counsel for the Washington-based
            Electronic Privacy Information Center, said that while it's good
            for the FTC to go after spammers who send fraudulent e-mails,
            the agency should do more to protect consumers against
            mainstream spammers. 

            He called on Congress to pass "opt-in" legislation for spammers,
            requiring them to get a user's permission before sending out
            spam e-mails. In addition, the legislation should require
            spammers to label their e-mails as advertisements.

How about an Attorney General who clamps down on civil liberties in a
quest to protect the American way of life. Or a President who kills
innocent people in an attempt to eliminate terrorism. But then, we'd be
talking politics rather than Linux I guess. :)

2) The Clinic is actually going to start at 11am Saturday, instead of the

Oh, so the program WASN'T written for playing datastreams that are not

Your emphasis on entertainment is either way off-base or purposely
misdirecting the argument here.  It's not a matter of what a person does
for fun, rather it is a matter of what a person should be willing to do to
improve their own situation (however they judge that improvement on their
own).

If a person cannot install or use a piece of software, then they must
determine the value of that software to the improvement they hoped to
bring to their life and maybe even re-evaluate the improvement itself
taking into account the amount of time and energy they'd like to spend to
reach their desired result.  That's just an overly-verbose way of
describing a natural process that all people have always followed
throughout history.  But we in the post-industrialist world have become a
pack of spoiled whiners that expect to get what we like with little or no
effort on our own and (worse yet, in my mind) believe that money is ALWAYS
a substitute for effort.

On a side note, I do, in fact, believe that learning how to do things for
yourself is fun and that the primary goal of nearly all human action and
interaction should be to improve your world and your self.  We should work
very hard to reprogram ourselves and our culture to use that end as our
basis for the determination of "fun".  Pleasure without productivity is
empty and base.  [As a straightforward example to which we all can relate
(chosen for its universality and appropriateness, not to shock those of
repressive and regressive morality), consider the value of sex with your
partner as a relationship-building exercise versus masturbation or casual
sex with a virtual stranger.  Which gives you the greater sense of
satisfaction?  Which is more fun?  Consider the reasoning behind your
answer and try to see how that measures against your ideas about
constructive and destructive behavior.]

If what I wrote were "false", it would be logically flawed or
contradictory to some verifiable fact.  This is not an argument of logic,
but of semantics.  And the contradiction is in our respective ideas of
what the word "lame" means in this context.

> First of all, you don't know what efforts I -have- made.

My statement was a conditional:  IF you're not making any effort, you may
as well be lame.

I didn't say anything about the effort you made, specifically.

Yes.  Leisure time (time when work isn't required for mere survival) can
either be constructive or destructive.  Construction is usually hard, but
it can be fun and relaxing, too.  The point is that you are putting in

You perceive it as derogatory.  I certainly don't.  It's just a statement
of fact, in my view of the word.  If you're not being constructive, you
are acting like a lame person (one who CANNOT be constructive).

I think you're missing the fact that "lame" is a sort of double-subjective
term.  First, it is in reference to a particular capacity.  Second, it is
in reference to level of competence and apability within that capacity.  
It is, if you pardon me, a measure of capacity within a capacity.

To say that a particular person is "-NOT- 'lame' by any means" is to say
that that person is exactly as capable and able in every endeavor as any
other person.  This would truly be a superman; as good as the best in
every field of human endeavor.

The word "lame" means "lacking in needful or desirable substance".  Both
"need" and "desire" are subject to the person defining the nature of the
substance.  As far as the MPlayer developers go, they are making a
judgment of certain user's lack of needful and desirable skills and/or
equipment required to use or improve their software.

So the term might be considered "derogatory" because the people using it
are describing people by what they have not, but it is no more derogatory
than calling a group "the poor" or "the infirm".  Really, it is only the
arrogant who are insulted by such statements.  Most people, I think,
realize their deficiencies and own up to them.  If they don't, they
should.

Nobody said that.  But I wouldn't at all be offended if he called me
"lame" for not knowing how to construct the thing and not trying to learn.

Hell, the reason that fifteen cents worth of brass (with six cents worth
of labor and maybe a dollar in shipping and stocking, plus, for gross
overestimation, another dollar in overhead costs for lighting and storing
the piece) costs EIGHT DOLLARS is because we live in a society that works
very hard to exploit the failings of others for private gain and profit.
Embracing your flawed nature and recognizing your deficiencies is the
first step in improving yourself and breaking out of a system of
exploitation and greed.

Nope.  Just a lame fuckin' machinist.  And that doesn't offend me because
it's completely true.

> What, are you too lazy to look it up? I just did so twice.

Well, if you'd given me the opportunity to look it up, I'm sure I could
have.  I'm not a lame researcher... not by my standards or most who've
bothered to judge me on those merits, anyway.

> What's wrong with you?

With respect to the question of knowing the thread taper of standard
pipe?  What's wrong with me is that I lack knowledge.  Sucks, huh?

Thankfully, I have resources that can show me that a 1" pipe has
11.5 threads per inch (assuming you meant NPT).

And, of course, garden hose thread has an outside diameter of 1-1/8, with
the same 11.5 threads per inch.

So now I'm slightly less lame, but still a VERY lame machinist.

> : change your behavior to be less lame.
> I already did that.

Cool.  Keep going.  Laurels are not a license to stop working.

I hope you understood the sentence you chopped for the above quote,
though.  The point is that IF you are offended by being called lame, then
you should change your behavior so that it complies with the competency
standard.  If you are NOT willing and able to comply with the standard to
which you were being held when you were called lame, then you shouldn't be
offended, you should merely accept the designation.

Subject: [PLUG] Backup mistake
Message-ID: <3DD5A290.566477EC@attbi.com>

I started a backup of my /var/www/html by copying it to another drive.
Unfortunately, I failed to account for a link that points back to the
root of the destination drive, so I've filled up a 40Gb drive with what
should have been less than a gig! Now, I'm looking for what to do to
undo this mistake. 

How I got where I am:

I have the 40 Gb drive mounted at /home/mp3. I've created a directory in
there called NECbackup, and I created a directory in there called
021115-var-www-html-backup. While at /home/mp3/NECbackup, I started the
copy by running:

# cp -R /var/www/html 021115-var-www-html-backup/

Inside one of the directories under /var/www/html is a directory,
MusicDB, with a link to /home/mp3. So, I've recursively created a large
number of copies that I shouldn't have. I suspect that there's an option
to ignore links, but I didn't read up enough to understand that before I
began.

So, now that I have all this, should I go to the first place down the
tree that the recursive copies begin and delete that by running:

cd /home/mp3/NECbackup/021115-var-www-html-backup/MusicDB
rm -R mp3

I note that ls -l shows mp3 in
/home/mp3/NECbackup/021115-var-www-html-backup/MusicDB as a directory,
whereas it shows mp3 as a link in /var/www/html/MusicDB.

For future reference, what should I have done? I just looked at the man
page for cp and didn't see a way to ignore links.

"man cp" gave me --no-dereference as an option, which indicates to

But what is rude BESIDES rude?  I know there is such a thing as rudeness,
but I don't think it applies here.

I'm trying to tell people that they should give everyone the benefit of
the doubt and try to find the best possible light in which to view a
person and their actions.  In this situation, there is a perfectly logical
and internally coherent way to view these actions without negativity or
malice.

At least TRY to give people the benefit of the doubt.

Interesting. That's not in my copy of "man cp." This is my RH 7.0
machine and has GNU fileutils 4.0x, July 2000, according to man cp. I
tried man -a cp, too, just to be sure I wasn't missing something. Is
that a relatively new option? It seems like it should have been around
for a long time, at least as long ago as RH 7.0.

so I can make it read and use variables when it starts apache. I know
perl can be used in the httpd.conf I have seen it done. I just don't know how to make
it work in there.
It needs to read the following when it is starting Apache

Sample of what I need to do

This is in the httpd.conf file

if ("/home/sites/home/certs/certificate" = "") {
SSLCertificateFile /home/.autoserv/conf/ssl.crt/server.crt

No. That doesn't work. However, rm -rf mp3 does the job. I found the
answer on page 338 of the Sybex book, Mastering Red Hat Linux 7.1, by
Arman Danesh, under the heading, "Deleting Whole Directories."

Sounds to me as if the owner/group or permissions on some file (in the users
directory?) got changed to root or somehow made so the user can't read
it.

This could possibly happen if you startx after 'su'ing to root without the dash.

I need to replace a series of lines in a httpd.conf file on the fly.
So it needs to be done in a bash file. I have been trying a bunch of

Is there a better way of doing this?


cp /tmp/TESTSCRIPT/httpd.conf /tmp/TESTSCRIPT/httpd.conf.autocontrol

sed -e '/my (@ssl_conf,$ip,$group,$rewrite_rules,$proto,$ret);/a\
my ($portnumber);

Well, like a bull (a frustrated one at that) I decided to remove some of
the config files in my user directory to see if I could get to the cause
of the problem.

After removing .xinitrc, I got it to work.  I am not sure what caused it
to become "corrupted" but it is gone and I am in.

Thanks for your help.

Actually, you want /tmp at permission 1777

Dunno. I found it in the cp man page on both RH 8.0 (fileutils-4.1.9-11)
and Gentoo 1.4_rc1 (fileutils-4.1.11), plus the online docs:

Subject: [PLUG] Wireless D-link PCI card
Message-ID: <200211161110.06627.bob@bmtsolutions.com>

Good Morning Everyone;

I am running SuSe 8.1.  I have a DWL-520+, D-Link AirPlus Wireless PCI 
adapter, I would like to use it on the modest server I put up. I tried using 
the iwconfig tool.  When I tried to use iwconfig it spits out "no wireless 
extensions find"  AT this point I assume the D-Link card I am using is not 
going to be usable. . Can anyone suggest a card the does work in linux or any 
more ideas.  I would like to get the server out of the small office to 
different place.  I was hoping to avoid doing any cable running.   

Thanks for your help
bob

You can use the option -e multiple times in one call of sed. I didn't see in
your pattern matches where the following pattern relied on the proceeding
pattern being in the file, so I believe you can combine them into one call. I
might have missed something though. 

#!/bin/sh

ORGINAL=/tmp/TESTSCRIPT/httpd.conf 
KOPY=/tmp/TESTSCRIPT/httpd.conf.autocontrol
OUTPUT=/tmp/TESTSCRIPT/httpd.conf.new

cp $ORGINAL $KOPY

sed -e '/my (@ssl_conf,$ip,$group,$rewrite_rules,$proto,$ret);/a\
my ($portnumber);
' -e '/$proto = 'https';/a\
    $portnumber = '5001';
' -e '/$proto = 'http';/a\
   $portnumber = '5000';
' -e '/RewriteRule .*cgi-bin\/.cobalt.* proto:\/\/servername:81.*/a\

RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}		^([^:]+)\

RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}		^([^:]+)\
RewriteRule ^/rcp/?$			
proto://servername:portnumber/resellerpanel/index.php\
### End - Autocontrol ###\
' -e '/$rewrite_rules =~ s/proto/$proto/g;/a\
$rewrite_rules =~ s/portnumber/$portnumber/g;
' < $ORGINAL > $OUTPUT

mv $OUTPUT $ORGINAL

exit 0

Thank you

FYI, someone wrote me this cool vim syntax file for viewing procmail logs.
I placed it in ~/.vim/syntax/proclog.vim and use it with: "vim '+set

Enjoy!

Hello Russell,
I just ran this and I get this error message
sed: -e expression #5, char 23: Extra characters after command

I removed the last -e expression and the script works. It looks like it
does not like the ~ in this line ' -e '/$rewrite_rules =~ s/proto/$proto/g;/a\
because that is char 23 what can I do to fix that. will a \ work to
make sed not read that as a Command

Also it added everything except these two lines
' -e '/$proto = 'https';/a\
    $portnumber = '5001';
' -e '/$proto = 'http';/a\
   $portnumber = '5000';

   Is that because of the '' around https and http if so do I put a \
   in front of them so sed does not read that as a Command

Hello Russell,
I fix the error I just needed to \ in front of any / in that part of
the script.
But I still can't get the part working that has 'httpd' and 'http'  in
it. It just goes buy it like it could not find the lines that it is
looking for.
' -e '/$proto = 'https';/a\
    $portnumber = '5001';
' -e '/$proto = 'http';/a\
   $portnumber = '5000';

Subject: [PLUG] LinkSys WPC11 Wireless Card and Redhat 7.3
Message-ID: <1037482132.10683.198.camel@lana>

I am not positive that this is a problem with the card, but I am having
serious problems getting it to work under rh7.3.

I installed the wlan driver package per the instructions, and I get a
happy tone from the card when I plug it in, but when I do ifconfig, it
does not show at all.  No wlan or eth0 device show.  Obviously then, I
do not have an IP.

I have a wired card that does work without a problem, and the access
point has worked up until now.  

I tried to use redhat-config-network but it does not have a wireless
selection when adding.  To rememdy that, I coped ifcfg-eth0 to
ifcfg-eth1 and tried to force it, but no soap.  It seemed to understand
that it was a wireless device, but it would not let me activate it.

I have spent way to many hours on this and am getting frustrated so any
hints would be most helpful.  Thanks.

You might try the hostAP stuff.  I think that's what I was using
before I switched to a Proxim RangeLAN card.  Google should find it.

Someone else suggested (was that you) on the PTP list.  What is hostAP
and how do I use it?  Also, is this really a driver problem?

Nobody else has mentioned this, so I will....

Don't use 'cp,' use a real archiver.  E.g., 'tar,' 'cpio' or even 'zip.' 
  That will preserve all information, can be easily compressed (to get 
you more backups into the same space), and can be safely copied onto any 
backup media.

In contrast, something like 'cp' can bite you if you try copy it to some 
media.  E.g., a recent article in SysAdmin magazine mentioned making 
backup copies to CD-R, but (IIRC) didn't mention that you can't have 
long filenames or more than 1024 entries in any directory under ISO9660.

I haven't been keeping up on the PTP list recently, so if it was
recently, it wasn't me.  All I remember is screwing around back in
June, then finally getting it to work and I am using the hostAP
drivers now, so infer what you want.  The URL seems to be:

  <http://hostap.epitest.fi/>

You don't have to use the drivers in "host" mode, but you can if you
want.  So, for example, you could plug your laptop into a network jack
and become an WiFi Access Point for everyone else in the room... if
you wanted to do that, which you might.

"rsync" is popular for copying trees these days, too.  I am still
mostly doing tar-to-tar for fresh copies (or tar-to-ssh-tar for
non-local copies), but I use rsync too, particularly when I just want
to sychronize two mostly-the-same trees.

Hi All,
I've got a problem with some scsi drives.
They don't seemingly want to format and now I can't get them to be
recognized by DOS  enough to run a fdisk or format on them from DOS
I was attempting to format from the SCSI utility in the SCSI
controller and they just hung. I have three drives that are this way.
Any help?

I'll keep it in mind, but I am reluctant to install something new on my
system until I know for sure why it doesn't work now.  A lot of folks
seem to be able to get to work, so I want to keep it going with the wlan
stuff.  If all else fails, though.....

This brings up a question... does anyone know the difference between the
different archival programs ar, shar, and tar ?  My impression from the
manual is they're the same, and all I ever see used is tar, but is it
sometimes better to use ar or shar?

When you did this did you edit the line inside the file the identifies
the device?
ie.. change

DEVICE=eth0
to 
DEVICE=eth1


also, do you have a profile set up in /etc/pcmcia/wireless.opts for the
card that sets the ESSID and Channel, Rate and other information, since
you are still running RH 7.3

(notice in RedHat 8.0 they've utilized the device scripts in
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts to set these preferences, like essid and
channel)

When you get the good beeps when inserting the card, you don't see any
device in ifconfig. However, do you see any information with the
iwconfig tool? (part of the wireless-tools package, also see iwlist and
other tools in this package.)

You may see your device there but no use information.. use iwconfig to
mess with these.. 

iwconfig <device> essid "any"
iwconfig <device> rate 11M
iwconfig <device> txpower 30mW

iwlist <device> txpower 

and other commands..

Suddenly not working or from the beginning?  I'm not an expert but I've 
made my share of mistakes and then figured them out - or had someone slap 
me up-along the back of the head ...

Do you have them all at separate device numbers?  Is there termination on
the SCSI chain?  Are the cables well seated?  Can you start with one
connected and get it to work?
   And then so we can pick the right nits.  What SCSI controller card are
you using and what types/models/makes of drives?

It is better to use shar when you don't have tar on the target system.
One of the few packages that GNU distributes in shar format is for
tar.  Used to be, before MIME attachments, that shar could be more
useful, because it produced text that could be email'd.

Today "shar" is mostly a relic.

"ar" is mostly used for creating object file libraries, and is mostly
invisible to the normal user (i.e. the user executes it indirectly
through make files, etc.).  Debian packages are actually "ar" archives
of two files, IIRC.

Why oh why did MS insist on using the format utility to create a
filesystem on a harddrive?

format in dos, does not format a harddrive, it just initizes the file
system.

The format on the controller does format the hardrive, but if it starts
and fails, the drive will likely then be unusable.

One word, formating a large drive takes a long time ... hours.

Without having your system in front of me I really could not say what
the state of your drives is, but I would suggest, that you put one drive
in, bring up the controller utility and format the drive, let it run
overnight if necessary.

Does yast2 see the card and only the wireless setting are not available? If so,
setup the card in yast2, `yast2 lan`. This should leave a ifcfg-ethX file in
the /etc/sysconfig/network directory.

Open the ifcfg-ethX in an editor and add  WIRELESS='yes'  or 
echo WIRELESS='yes' >> /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-ethX.

Start yast2 lan again and choose edit. Choose ethX and the options for wireless
should now be avialable for you to setup.

You will need to have the wireless tools, pcmcia, and wlan-ng rpms installed. 

If `yast2 lan` does not see the card at the command prompt 

modprobe prism2_pci 
#see if yast2 lan sees the card, do the above
rmmod prism2_pci
modprobe prism2_plx
#see if yast2sees the card, do the above

I've also got an AT power supply, the MG-250HP from MACASE:  
http://www.macase.com/ps-at.htm

So, I get to exercise my finger when I power down.  Oh well,
that's better than the exercise my finger gets with another
OS.  ;-)

Cheers....

According to the picture at that URL, it has only an AT power connector.
If that's actually the case, then you won't be able to have it auto
power off. The motherboard has nothing to do with it. 

Manually turning off the power supply is the only way to accomplish a
complete shutdown.

I thought you had your patterns matching what you wanted, sorry. I believe the
' in 'https' is the issue. Replace the ' with .   .htps.

/$proto = .https.;/a\

ar(1) is a very limited format - only 14 bytes for filename, no symlinks 
or other special devices, etc.  I can't remember if it's byte or word 
aligned - whichever it saves some modest space over tar format which is 
512-byte (or larger) block aligned.  It does not have a TOC - you can 
easily stick additional files to the end.  ar archives are typically 
neither compressed or encrypted.

As somebody else pointed out, the Debian .deb format is actually an ar 
format with three files.  A version marker, "data.tar.gz" (what the 
upstream package produces), and "control.tar.gz" (the Debian control 
information), and derived packages can add additional files with ease as 
long as they observe a few basic rules.  (E.g., for a while I was 
playing with embedding security info in an additional entry.)

tar(1) is a general format - it stores permissions, dates, special 
files, etc.  It can support 100 (150?) byte filenames trivially, a bit 
longer with the "prefix" field, and arbitrarily long files with a widely 
recognized extension.  It can also cleanly support "sparse" files, and 
has limited support for multiple volume archives.  It does not have 
either header or TOC.

tar files are typically externally compressed, with either gzip (.gz) or 
bzip2 (.bz2).  They are not encrypted except on an ad hoc basis.

shar(1) is a transportation archive format designed for portability. 
It's not widely used anymore.

cpio(1) is a legacy format that some organizations still use.  Most 
notably, a Red Hat RPM file is a non-standard header followed by a cpio 
archive.

zip(1) is a general format that hasn't been widely used in the Unix 
world, but it is gaining popularity with the increased use of Java. 
(.jar, .war, etc files are basically .zip files with some content rules 
and specialized additional files.)  Zip directly supports compression 
and modest encryption, and extensions provide for Unix file permissions 
to be archived and some PKIX info.  I don't think a standard extension 
supports PKI encryption yet.  Zip has a TOC in a "central directory" 
block at the end of the file and per-file headers.

Like most of life, the best choice for you depends on your specific 
needs.  As a rule of thumb, if you only have regular files owned by a 
single user, zip may be better - at least if you know Java. :-)  If you 
have special files, multiple users, or the like you'll probably want to 
stick with tar.

hey folks,
     Has anyone has any success getting the latest Nvidia drivers to work with Redhat 8.0.  Bit frustrating for me as I have followed the directions to the "T" and still have yet to get acceleration operating correctly (3d acceleration).  Thanks for any feedback you folks can give me.

Message-ID: <20021117065654.XWIQ21905.sccrmhc02.attbi.com@linux>

A while back, I believe there was a post on one of these lists, for a way to
easily setup time based internet access. There was, IIRC, one reply to that
post that stated it was possible via iptables but didn't provide an easy to use
tool to do this. The following is a floppy based router that seems to provide
the functionality asked for. 

This is the time based access documentation for the tool.
http://www.bbiagent.net/en/docs/explorer/300.htm

This is the project home.
http://www.bbiagent.net/en/index.html

I have no experience with this and only came across it searching freshmeat for
another tool. 

Thank you

I'm using flexbackup. It's designed for tape drives, but it works well
for drive to drive backups. I like that it automagically names the files
with the date and source, and I can tweak the compression rate and lots
of other stuff.

Subject: [PLUG] Evolution 1.2
Message-ID: <1037523194.16548.8.camel@duron.stpaultel.com>

I just wanted to share my experience with using Evolution 1.2.....

I downloaded it and spent a bit of time compiling the sucker (and
everything it depends on)...

Now, I compiled it with far less optimizations (-march=athlon
-mcpu=athlon -O3 -s -ffast-math -funroll-loops) than I had 1.0.8
compiled with.  It is, however, a *lot* faster.  It loads up my mailbox
probably twice as fast and whenever I receive new email, there isn't
that churning of the disk I had with 1.0.8 - they really fixed their
mail storage problem.  The interface also seems a bit more refined -
nothing I can really put my finger on, though.

Now we run in to problems.  I open up the PLUG VFolder, click on a
message up at the top, and hit 'n' for 'next unread message'.  Ooops, no
dice.  I hunted around for several minutes - I think that keybinding and
event have just vanished.  Bummer.

So I go prancing through the config settings (which are all in one place
now... nice).  Can't find it.  I changed a few things and hit OK or
Apply (don't remember which)... the evolution-mail portion of ev
seg-faulted.  No biggy, I say, I do a oaf-slay && killev && oaf-slay to
be sure it is gone and launch it again.  Now whenever I go in to that
Settings box, evolution-mail dies.  Errm... bummer.

The shortcuts on the side seem to also have problems updating - new mail
came in (3 plug messages) but Inbox's count didn't go up - PLUG's did. 
I have yet to see if the 'Unmatched' count works properly or not (it
didn't update with 1.0.8 unless I was viewing the unmatched folder when
the mail came in).

That about sums it up.  I'd wait for another release - hopefully with a
fixed 'n' key.  :-)

But if you store a lot of email in ev, you'll find a much much snappier
system.  I have about 5300 emails in my inbox and definitely noticed a
big improvement.  I'm sure those of you with years' worth of email will
find an even bigger jump in speed.  :-)

I missed the 'n' key function also.  It seems to move to the next or
previous unread messages you use the ']' and '[' keys.  My experience is
a lot better speed also.
The only problem I have is the calendar crashes the program if I select
it.  
You said you used the vfolders, is there an advantage to that over
making a lot of regular folders?

If I'm not mistaken, evolution is a GTK+ app, which means you can add a
keybinding by highlighting the appriopriate action on a pull-down menu and
hitting the key you would like bound to the action.

Don't know if this is possible in your case, but I thought I'd throw that
out there.

Thanks for all your help Russell,

I went to /etc/sysconfig/network and edited the file ifcfg-eth0 and changed 
wireless='no' to wireless='yes'.  As you said,  when I started 'yast2 lan', I 
now had the wireless configuration.  When I went here the very first thing I 
saw was Operating mode, which was set to Ad-hoc ( i believe this is used for 
peer-to-peer networking?)  In the installation guide for the DWL-520+ D-Link 
AirPLus PCI adapter, (guide geared towards windows installation), I noticed 
they have the wireless mode set to infrastructure.  This of course is not one 
of the options.  So I set it to automatic ( I tried the other setting and the 
results were all the same) .  Next the essid, I set to 'default', which is 
the same setting on the router ( I figured I would change this later and 
assigned name , of my choosing, for the wireless network). Everything else I 
left as is.  I set the card to static IP of 192.168.0.101, GW: 192.168.0.1, 
etc  I going to use port forwarding to be able to have my email server and 
webserver on the internet.  

Note: I did check to see wireless tools, pcmcia and wlan-ng packages were 
installed.  All but wlan-ng were installed. I went to yast2 / install and 
remove software and did a search for wlan-ng and came up empty handed. Would 
this package be bunched together with another package? You mentioned this has 
be to installed so where would I find this package on the installation disks.  
Is package usually used w/ redhat?

I tried to ping the gateway and was not able to.   Out of curiousity I did a 
rcnetwork restart and recieved the following errors:
    eth0 ifup-wireless command  'iwconfig eth0 mode automatic ' returned
            ifup-wireless: Error wirless request "set mode" (8B06): set failed  
            eth0 operation not supported


I am still very new to all the linux.  Thanks to your great help I was able to 
get this far.  Do you have any more suggestions on how to proceed.  I will 
continue to look over FAQs an linux documentation to see if I can make head 
way.  

Oh, I forgot to mention I did try modprob prism2_pci, prism_plx, orinoco_pci 
and orinoco_plx.  I get "init_module: no such device"  

Thanks again for all you help!

It's still there, just bound to odd keys  ("[", "]", "," and ".") -
which I'm sure seemed like good a idea at the time but nobody now seems
to like them.  You can change them by editing the
evolution-mail-message.xml file that's (probably) located in
/usr/share/gnome/ui.  Changing the 'accel=' will change the key binding

    <cmd name="MailNextUnread"
     _tip="Display the next unread message"
     accel="n"/>

    <cmd name="MailPreviousUnread"
     _tip="Display the previous unread message"
     accel="p"/>

Poke around and you'll probably see some other things you might like to
bind keys to or change the binding of and how to name the keystroke. 
You may want to make a backup before you tweak the file, and you'll have
to stop and restart evolution before the changes get picked up; I don't
know what will happen if you bind two commands to the same key.  Also
make a backup of your changes, an Evolution upgrade will probably
overwrite it.  I wish this was configurable in the application..

I've not noticed this - do you mean on the "Shortcut" bar or in the
"Folders" bar?  Shortcuts in the shortcut bar have never shown
new/unread/read message counters for me, but the folder list does.  You 
did mentioned that you stuff your PLUG messages into a VFolder, which
I've noticed "broken" behavior from (not updating sometimes as new mail
flows in).  I filter my incoming mail into mailboxes organized into
folders and subfolders and haven't noticed new message counts being off.

I've never really used VFolders except as a way to search across
mailboxes and to have persistent searches in place - do the messages get
hidden from your Inbox?

Evo 1.2 has a HUGE speed improvement over 1.0.8 for large mailboxes!
Overall startup times went from about 2 minutes to a couple seconds for
me.  Opening a large mailbox went from a few seconds to about 1 second. 
Performing multiple operations at once like deleting hundreds of
messages while opening another mailbox and reading a message is now
feasible whereas before it would seem to wait for all the messages to be
deleted before loading the other mailbox's message to read.  Filtering
is much faster too, which is probably related to the faster mailbox
handling.

I wouldn't wait if one is looking for a new mail program and Evolution
has the features you need - it's a very nice program I think.

The things I like:

 - If you're a packrat like I am and subscribe to dozens of mailing
   lists it's very nice (though not perfect) for managing thousands of
   messages. I've got about 29,000 messages in it now and it's far
   better to use than anything else I've used (pine, mutt, outlook,
   eudora (older versions only, recent ones might be better)).

 - Filtering is very easy and quite powerful - 97% of procmail's
   capability at about %3 of procmail's effort.

 - The built-in mail editor is pretty nice - features like inline spell
   checking and some handy text formatting features (but not enough)

 - It's reliable (at least for me, some people have had other
   experiences), I often leave it running for weeks at a time with no
   problems.  On the rare occasions when it as crashed it's not lost any
   mail, even messages in the process of being composed.  YMMV of
   course.

The things I don't like:

 - About once a day I wish it had was a way to easily search across
   folders.

 - I wish it had a better text editor with a richer set of text
   formatting features.

The things that would be nice to have:

 - A text-only mode

I did a normal update direct from Ximian and I also had problems.  Minor
compared to yours.  At first, my mail addresses disappeared but I got
them back (I forget how at the moment), but my inbox folder -- and only
my inbox folder -- is not threading properly.

Look for bug updates soon, I would think.

Thanks everybody who came up with solutions for the keybinding issues -
cool.  :-)

And Jeme - I was aware of the GTK+ keybinding stuff, but in my
experience it cannot bind to regular keys (just n) but must have a
modifier.  And "Go to next unread message" isn't in any of the menus. 
:-\

I don't use the calendar yet.  In Windoze, I was able to use my Yahoo
Calendar and it would sync with my palm - giving me access to my
calendar anywhere I was.  I haven't used a calendar on the PC side since
I dropped Windows - and will not until I find something that can sync up
with the Internet and my palm.

I don't think so.  I started using VFolders with my old CS2K IMAP
account and just stuck with them.  Regular folders would do the sorting
as mail came in - just once - rather than sorting them every time the
program is launched *or* when new mail comes in.  It does, however, give
me better mail count control.

As far as speed and usability are concerned, regular folders should be
better.  I just don't feel like switching.  :-)

Rob  <~~Just found another glitch (probably due to gtkhtml
optimizations) . the end key doesn't work.

VFolders work by taking a filter rule and applying it to whatever
folders you want, then take the matching emails and put them in the
VFolder, more or less.  The messages stay in your Inbox, too... and can
be in multiple VFolders if they match the criteria for them.

Yeah, I am speaking of the 'Shortcuts' bar and not the 'Folders' bar.  I
put all my VFolders in that and it looks pretty.  It has always (1.0.8
did) had the number of unread messages in parenthesis.

With 1.0.8, the 'Unmatched' VFolder - which catches everything not
matched by other VFolders... did not ever update as new mail came in
unless the folder was open.  This still seems to be the case with 1.2.0,
unfortunately.

Now, with 1.2.0, the 'Inbox' real folder in the Shortcuts bar is not
listing a number at all, ever.  It just says Inbox with no number beside
it.  Not a big deal, I guess.

My bad on the wlan-ng. I thought it was a rpm. I think it was a seperate
package in the past, but it is now part of the kernel package. So you're good
to go.

The error is because the card doesn't understand "automatic" use "managed". It
is the same as "infrastructure" i.e. in managed mode your box talk to an AP.
You won't be able to ping the gateway until you have the link setup. At the
command prompt you want to run iwconfig after setting the card to managed. The
things to look for are; the Mode, confirm it is in Managed, the Cell, make sure
your seeing your AP ( some places in town it is easy to pick up someone elses
AP ), and Signal level, if its 0 you know you can't "see" the AP and need to
start closer to the AP or look at the AP to make sure it's working.   


Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.462GHz  Cell: 00:00:00:00:00:00
	  Bit Rate=11Mb/s   Tx-Power=15 dBm   Sensitivity:1/3  
	  Retry min limit:8   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off

	  Link Quality:0  Signal level:0  Noise level:0
	  Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
	  Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0


I'm not sure why you weren't able it install modules. It is good that it falled
because that was only needed if yast didn't see your card which it did. 

Thank you
Russell

I've noticed that su - chamges you to root's home dir, whereas plain su
leaves you in the user's dir. Shouldn't make any difference to $PATH,
though, I shouldn't think, so there's more to it than that..

I saw this statement. Is this true? Why or why not?
Thanks, Dirk

from the 'su' man page:

	-, -l, --login
 	             make the shell a login shell

so 'su -' sets up the environment as if root had logged in normally, rather 
than with 'su'. It's the same difference as starting bash as 'bash' rather 
than 'bash -l' or 'bash --login'.

Err, sorry, that's not quite correct, bash doesn't behave quite like that. I'm 
awake, really! :)

This, out of the 'su' info page is better:

`-'
`-l'
`--login'
     Make the shell a login shell.  This means the following.  Unset all
     environment variables except `TERM', `HOME', and `SHELL' (which
     are set as described above), and `USER' and `LOGNAME' (which are
     set, even for the super-user, as described above), and set `PATH'
     to a compiled-in default value.  Change to USER's home directory.
     Prepend `-' to the shell's name, intended to make it read its
     login startup file(s).

Well, thanks to you Keith, I am ever closer to my goal of actually get
it to work.  I am having serious doubts about the tag line on the
product that says "Instant Wireless".

Anyway, I installed the RRMs as you suggested and I now get the wlan0
showing on ifconfig but when I try and ping the closest machine on my
local network, I get a network unreachable message.  How can I test to
see if there is a signal there?  My access point has worked in the past.

Thanks for all the great feedback.  I worked on this all day and still got no 
where.  I was on the verge of committing electronnic suicide when I shot off 
an email to the suse group.  I got the following reply back from a Rick 
Green...

"The 'plus' series of wireless adapters from D-link is using a new chipset
from Texas Instruments(ACX-100), not the intersil prism chipset that has
been common up to this point.To date, there is no open-source driver for the 
TI chipset, and TI has declined to release the information necessary to write 
one. I did see a few weeks ago, a note from a representative of the
Australian division of D-Link to a LUG there, that a closed-source
binary-only driver was under development and scheduled for release around
the end of the year.I, too, am awaiting more information, as this chipset is 
purported to have significant performance advantages over the intersil part, 
and has been adopted as the new standard by D-Link, USR, and others."

I thought I would shared the info just in case someone else has purchased or 
thinking about purchasing this particular card..... DWL-520+ D-link Airplus 
Wireless PCI adapter..   So I guess I am off to purchase a different card.  I 
would love to hear about any suggestions on cards that you or anyone else 
knows that works.  

Times like this reminds me on how little I know. I have come along way, over 
the last couple of years but maybe someday I can graduate to at least an 
intermediate user.  I am forever stuck on newbie..   Thanks for you valuable 
time and feedback.

Do you have an adequate route statement to reach the network?

What does `route -n` show?

My experience has been that $PATH is part of the user's environment and is
set appropriately upon invoking "su -", i.e. /sbin and /usr/sbin are in
$PATH, whereas they might not be for Joe User.

Hrm, I'm trying this out right now, and $PATH is being set for root even
when just using su (sans -). I know I've seen this not happen, where 'su'
does not set $PATH for root, but 'su -' does. I'm using Gentoo 1.4rc1
here. Am I crazy?

Coherent went bankrupt around 1997, IIRC. According to the guy who told me
about this, they just couldn't compete against Linux. (And had Linux
never been created, I'd bet that it would have been one of the *BSD that
would have killed Coherent.)

Then again, a few years ago my source started claiming that Windows would
replace Linux, so take that bit of 2nd-hand information with a grain of
salt. (He said some stuff after that, but I stopped listening to him;
every time he claimed to have the scoop about What's New in computers,
I would end up getting into a flamewar with him because his view of
reality was perpendicular to mine. I didn't need one more excuse to get
mad about stuff.) Lots of potentially useful developments in computing
have shrivelled up & died entirely because of a few bad business decisions.
Not that any of us could think of an example or two we have witnessed in
the last few years.

caveat: I'm shooting from the hip

I've never investigated how the various su invocations do shell 
initialization, but my hunch is that root's interactive 
(~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, or ~/.profile) and non-interactive 
(~/.bashrc) login scripts are identical, or nearly so.

I got it to work by changing the DesiredSSID in the wlan-ng.opts file.

It feels sooooooo good :)

At last Saturday's clinic I overheard a father say to a son
something like, "Well, Linux is only really good for email
anyway."  It seems the father was wanting Mathcad to run on
Linux.  I suggested that Mathematica would run on Linux and is a
better program than Mathcad.  Yes, it's expensive.  But, maybe
the son can buy the student version, which is identical to the
professional version except that you don't get tech. supt. and
it's about 90% cheaper.  I also suggested some open source math
software, specificly:  Maxima, Scilab and octave.

If anyone else thinks that Linux is only good for
email, or if you know someone who thinks that, then you
really need to know about this Linux applications list:
http://home.xnet.com/~blatura/linapps.shtml

Oddly enough, Maxima isn't listed there.  Its URL is
http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/wfs/maxima.html

Is that still maintained? His "copyright" lists 1998 as the last year.
Not that that matters much, but it's indicative of not updating the

Dave,

I haven't had any luck with this either. I also tried installing Nvidia
drivers from tarball and from source RPM, but no luck either way.
Hopefully nVidia will put out a RH8 driver soon, and hopefully in time
for the Linux version of Neverwinter Nights comes out.

Have you tried Amaya? It's the only linux web design app with WYSIWYG

	Freshmeat.net is another really good place to look for stuff.
	That one *is* maintained.

Is that still maintained? His "copyright" lists 1998 as the last year.
Not that that matters much, but it's indicative of not updating the
site.

What exactly is the problem?
I don't have RH8 on my gaming box, but I havea kernel even newer than the
one from RH8, and I have NVidia drivers working with no problems.

"When Linux version of Neverwinter Nights comes out" will soon become the

Weird. I have it working fine.

Get the source RPM. (I don't remember version numbers and I am not in 
front of the computer.)

rpmbuild --rebuild NVIDIA_kernel-<whatever>.src.rpm

Find the rpm it built

rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/NVIDIA_kernel<version>.rpm

rpm -ivh NVIDIA_GLX<version>.i386.rpm  (Might have to rebuild this too.)

The tricky part is that you may need to force the module load the fist 
time.  You also need to make sure that the XF86Config* files are pointing 
to the correct driver.  (That works as documented.)

The only real issue is that there are some issues with it complaining 
about gcc 3.2 and lack of GPL issues.  insmod --force will take care of 
the complaints.

It works pretty well on my system.  (I can run Unreal Tournement 2003 with 
little or no problem.)

Let's hope not.  I moved my main desktop/gaming platform to linux just 
because they said that they'd have Linux support 'real soon now'.  This 
was back in...April?  Heh.

I have it working as well.  It takes a bit of rebuilding, but I always do 
that due to the quirks of my system.  (Dual Athlon 2100+ MP.)

What have you heard? Tux Games has it listed as the end of this month.  
(Although that may be optimistic.)

Mozilla has WYSIWIG.

So does OpenOffice, and it's not that bad for simple pages.

I wouldn't doubt that WYSIWIG modules could be built for Bluefish or
Quanta.  Quanta Gold (from The Kompany) may have a WYSIWIG mode, but it
costs money, although you do get the source.

Here's the thing.  Until people start using WYSIWIG on Linux, no one
will develop it.  If a bunch of people started submitting bug
fixes/feature requests to the Bugzilla sites for each project, then
work would be done.  Every Linux person that continues to use FrontPage
and Dreamweaver on a different partition or under Wine/Win4Lin/etc
actively hinders the development of those tools under Linux.

Linux client is due for a Fall release. We're getting weekly updates on

I haven't heard anything specific, but Tux Games used to list it as August.
Also, the Neverwinter client progress page is rather depressing. Sure, it's nice to see that they are working on it and there is some progress but... "huray,
we got audio code working!"... hello, guys, you told us it was "parallel
development" and Linux client was "just slightly behind", and now we find out
that until a month ago it did not have any audio at all? Same for textures, etc.
What exactly was there from the days of parallel development, a splash screen
may be? Sounds more like there was no parallel development and they have
just started writing the Linux client pretty much from scratch.

Actually, they did:

What we can't give you right now:
- an exact completion date

All we can estimate is that we expect the Linux Client to be available
for download in Fall 2002.

  R and scilab are two different things. Just as the GIMP and sketch do
different types of graphics, but they're both drawing packages.

I've tried the Mandrake 9.0 download and I like it on my system.
It's a little lean compared to the 7.0 and 8.0 PowerPacks that

MandrakeClub or by buying a Mandrake 9.0 PowerPack.

What do you recommend?

I hosted one of their mirros for a while.

They EAT bandwidth.  Instead of putting pointers to  usable tarballs for 
the stuff you need, they host it all there. Double-plus ungood.

A very cool project though.  Not certain if I like the copyright 
requirements for contributors.  (Basically the autor of the site claims 
all copyrights.  Or did the last time I looked.)

There's still a mirror up at http://lfs.sourceforge.net
Short version: Instructions for compiling a Linux system from scratch (LFS - 
"Linux From Scratch"). They eat bandwidth because they provide a tarball of 
all the required source for the base install.

Thanks Mark,
I missed your posting.  You are correct though  I did not come to this 
conclusion, on the driver support, until early this morning. I wish I did not 
miss your post I could have same myself some time. I ordered another card 
that uses the Prism2 chipset.    I hope the card I just order will have a 
smooth install. 

Thanks for helping out.

I asked a friend of mine if he might be able to handle the colo of 
LFS.  His answer is below.  Bottom line is that it looks like there 
could be help for LFS if they could restructure the data for smaller 
downloads or if they could share the load across mirrors somehow.

Sigh...




===============================================================


I certainly have the physical room, but can you give me an idea
of the amount of bandwidth they typically use? I had a "friend"
sink all 7 of the t1's here after they put out a set of U2 MP3's
on their website - I can handle a lot but this ain't a 100 mbit
pittock building colo... If they have ten thousand people a day
downloading ISO's I probably can't handle it :-)

> http://community.linuxfromscratch.org/explanation.txt

oh, gulp - 23GB/day ... I just read that. Last paragraph stats
2500-3000kbit/second, in otherwords, maxing out of two $900/month
T1 circuits... at that level I don't think I can do it... I know
a company down at the pittock that has the bandwidth but they
also have to pay for it - about $300/meg, so a 3000kbit/second
connection would cost them $900/month (much cheaper than t1's but
still $$$)...

so... ahem, I hate to say no but I can't handle the load they
are talking about...  I think they need to find a well located,
and well heeled ISP that is not paying $/bits (like my friends
at the pittock) or limited to smaller pipes, even if there are a
lot of them (like me). No doubt this is why they are having such
problems finding a new home... If there is a reduced version of
the site or they could stand to be bandwidth limited, I would be
more than happy to help out.

As somebody else suggested - pulling the tarballs themselves off the
site and instead just linking to them - from the owner's site - would
work a whole heck of a lot better.

Heck, provide a wget script or something...

Oh well.

I am NOT an expert user. However, I have purchased Mandrake and am a Club
member so here's my two cents . . . Joining the Mandrake Club is way better
than purchasing stale code on coasters, unless you're still using a dialup
connection. Purchasing the retail product helps keep Mandrake functioning,
but so does joining the Club.

I remembered to back up a lot of stuff before installing RH 8 on my

worked on RH 7, so I don't have those to refer to.

When I start httpd, other machines in the house can see the web site on
nec, and I can bring up the maintenance web page of my Netgear router by
typing in the address 192.168.0.1 in Mozilla on nec, so I know that the
eth0 is working. But I can't see anything other than local pages. 

The Netgear documentation said to use 192.168.0.1 as the default gateway
address.

Suggestions on where to start looking will be greatly appreciated.

Three events in all:

   * Friday night @ Bridgport: Pretty much like a typical post-PLUG meeting
          at the Lucky Lab, but with a dog-n-pony show in the middle. 
          Imagine a PLUG meeting where we had beer before and after the
          presentation.

   * Saturday clinic at Riverdale: Pretty much like a regular clinic but
          with three times the normal crowd. The RH techs jumped in and
          helped with installations/debugging/general-geek-stuff and there
          was a seperate room setup for presentations (marketing stuff I
          would assume, but I spent the whole time doing geek-stuff).

   * Monday education round-table: Roughly 45-50 educators discussing how
          they are using Linux, why they are using Linux, what would it take
          for them to use more Linux, etc. Red Hat folks talked about what
          they are doing to help schools.

I believe tht's true if the Linux person is a programmer. Without the ability to 
program a better tool.

I don't see how I could help, for instance.

I attended the opening lecture, he was funny and did a geat 
overview of the new desktop and new features. He was funny 
and pointed (at M$) I spent the rest of the time in the lab, 
where there was a mondo install fest. LOTS of copies of the 
first two disks were distributed.

I understand that the stump-the-geek festival in the separate

I made two public school people happy by sending them out 
with fully functional RH 8.0 installs on hardware they could 
play with at their work sites.

  This reminds me: I tried installing 8.0 on a laptop (the "tried" is
because the hard drive has too many bad sectors so the process didn't
complete) but saw only Gnome and KDE as options. No Bluetooth (or bluelips
or whatever the mongrel is). Where is this new hybrid located -- for when I
try this again?

Thanks,

I didn't say you have to be a programmer, I said you have to be a
user.  In my opinion, large software projects are usually desperate for
people to fulfill two jobs:

1) Insightful user.  This person is committed to using the software and
can write informative bug reports in a clear concise manner.  They are
usually able to type "make clean all install" to check out bug-fixed
versions of software.  Coding skill can help here, since patches are
always welcome.

2) Documentation guru.  This person can write copious amounts of
documentation with little or no guidance from developers.  Most
documentation is created from bad bug reports and email list traffic.
Coding skill is definitely a plus here, but not necessary.

A large user base usually guarantees the success of a given project,
since there are enough people to fill those two tasks.

It's the default. I've even installed the complete Gnome and 
KDE desktops, too but the bluefin/tooth/lips desktop is the 
default when you reboot after installing. It's great to only 
reboot once while installing.

The Bluecurve theme came up by default when I ran the install. I don't
recall choosing either Gnome or KDE, but if I did, I probably went with
Gnome, since that's what I'm familiar with.

Under the red hat icon --> Preferences --> Theme, there is an option to
change from Bluecurve to Metal, Raleigh, or Redmond95. There's also a
button for adding new themes.

  Coders make terrible documentation writers. Despite my writing skills, I
learned that writing documention for applications _I_ wrote is a very, very
difficult job. Not because I don't know the software, but because I know it
so well. I assume that the reader knows things that are obvious to me. They
don't. Responding, "Well, _everyone_ knows that" doesn't cut it. :-)

  The best end-user docs come from end users who are not intimately familiar
with the program design decisions and the code. Sad but true.

Mike,

  How interesting! What of Gnome and/or KDE is essential in this case? I'll
probably be putting xfce on this box, too, but I'm just curious how
blue<whatever> is installed when the choices are Gnome and KDE.

  Reboot only once while installing? Hasn't this always been true with
linux?

Thanks muchly,

Rich

  Aha! I was selecting Gnome-ish things and rejecting all KDE-ish things.
When I buy a replacement drive (and this one's only about 3 years old!) I'll
see what happens.

  Interesting. I'll see if we can add xfce, too. It's not a "theme" but a
desktop manager we use on all the boxes here.

Danke,

Gentlemen,

Bluecurve is their graphical interface that appears no matter what you
do.  I believe that it is Red Hat's desktop that tries to make either
KDE or Gnome have a similar appearance and function somewhat similarly
with by improving the menus from KDE and Gnome so that they appear
somewhat similar.  I installed both desktop environment packages during
my install.

After playing around I realized that the desktop and panel for both
environments looked similar, yet different.  If you ahve installed both
environemnts and then used the desktop switching tool you can see the
differences.  The main menu button for both KDE & Gnome environment has
a red hat and not the K gear or footprint that you may be used to.  In
both environments, you'll, initially, see the evolution groupware
package and then office.org application buttons and so on.  

The desktops look different and open up different file managers.  The
first desktop that my sytem started with, I believe, was bluevurve based
on gnome since I recognized nautilus file manager.  I used the desktop
switching tool and changed to bluecurve based on KDE and my file manager
was Konqueror.

I hope that this makes some sense.

TIA,

Jim

I tried your instructions, but it didn't work, as before. Here is what
I did:

rpm -ivh NVIDIA_kernel-1.0-3123.src.rpm

This seemed to work, but complained about no "user buildmeister" or
"group buildmeister" so using root.

This file didn't appear to create an RPM, not one I could find anyhow.
It did create the following empty directory:

/var/tmp/NVIDIA_kernel-1.0/lib/modules/2.4.18-18.8.0/kernel/drivers/video

It also created this directory:

/usr/src/redhat/BUILD/NVIDIA_kernel-1.0-3123

In it were no RPMs, just the following files:
makedevices.sh   nv_compiler.h  nv-misc.h       os-interface.h
Makefile         nv.h           nv_ref.h        os-registry.c
Module-nvkernel  nv-ids.h       nvtypes.h       README
nv.c             nv-linux.h     os-interface.c  rmretval.h

I tried running make, which did a bunch of stuff, with lots of
warnings, and ended with the following error:

make: *** [nv.o] Error 1

The README told me it should create NVDriver, but I could not find any
file by that name.

Because it's only a theme.. and they have taken that Theme and created
one for KDE and for GNOME.. (common icons and naming conventions between
the two desktop systems.)   Bluecurve. For common usability between the
two. That is all. Cosmetic..

Instead, try

  rpmbuild --rebuild NVIDIA_kernel-1.0-3123.src.rpm

You should end up with some sort of rpm in /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386. 
Install that one.

Are you saying you can't browse the internet?  If not, can you ping urls
and/or ips (yahoo's ip is 66.218.71.84)?  If you can ping by IP and not
url, make sure your dns configuration is correct.  If you can't ping by
IP or URL you may need to make sure that your router is routing traffic
from your machine.  My guess, form personal experience is that it's a
dns problem.

Read those instructions again.

You need to do an "rpmbuild --rebuild NVIDIA_kernel-<version>.src.rpm,
rather than installing the src.rpm. Building from the src.rpm will drop
the rpm in /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/<arch>/NVIDIA_kernel-<version>.<arch>.rpm.
You want to "rpm -ivh" that to get the kernel module installed. Then edit
your /etc/X11/XF86Config and change 'Driver "nv"' to 'Driver "nvidia"'.
You'll need to install the GLX rpm also.

I didn't have any problems when building from "source" <cough, cough>
rpms, and otherwise following NVIDIA's instructions.

As a member of society, I reserve the right (one of the few society and the 
government still allow me!) to complain about rude and hostile persons. Those 
that don't like it are, of course, free to leave society.

This concludes my statements on the matter.

I'd check out the Linux-USB website. There is support for mass storage USB
devices in 2.4 kernels. It looks like they emulate SCSI devices, and would
therefore be mounted by doing a "mount /dev/sdxX /mnt/<mountpoint>" or
whatever.

Subject: [PLUG] Why is it slower on a P4?
Message-ID: <20021119051849.GB27602@sthelens.dimstar.net>

Here's the situation.

I have a machine at home configured like so:

Athlon XP 1800+
Soyo kt333 motherboard
512 mb RAM
40 gb hard drive
32 mb ATI video card
DVD drive
Creative CD-RW 12/10/32
Mandrake 9.0

At work, I have the following configuration:

P4 2.4 ghz
Dell mb (Sorry, it's a dell workstation. work bought it for me...)
1 gb RAM
40 gb hard drive
32 mb ATI video card
cd/dvd/cdrw combo drive
Mandrake 9.0

Here's the catch... The Athlon can handle more load than the P4. I'm
writing this message while downloading files, burning a CD, listening to 
mp3s, and untaring BIG tarballs. No problem at all. 

If I try this same thing at work, the system is EXTREMELY sluggish. The
mouse pointer jumps instead of smoothly crossing the screen, I can't
drag windows around. It's hard to get the mouse pointer to stop on the
window bar, let alone on a corner...

Why would the P4 be such a dog (besides the fact that "it's a dell,
man."

Could it be the P4 system doesn't have dma enabled?

As root, try hdparm /dev/hda (assuming hda is your hard drive)...

Mine outputs this... it uses DMA, but I haven't played with any of the
other settings.  :-)

/dev/hda:
 multcount    =  0 (off)
 IO_support   =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)

 readahead    =  8 (on)

Subject: [PLUG] Simple Directory Listing to HTML Script
Message-ID: <1037684387.20343.21.camel@cooper.cooper.stevenson.name>

All,

I just finished writing a script for a friend (actually a pretty fun
``script on demand'' session really) that converts a directory listing
into an html page who's links point to your files.

It's single argument is the name of the directory who's contents you
want written out an html file.

You may need to change the first line (#!/usr/local/bin/ksh) as your ksh
shell may very well be in a different directory.

Also, if you do not have the Korn shell, I 1) highly recommend the Korn
shell and 2) you can modify the `print' statements to `echo' statements.


#------------------Begin Script----------------------


#!/usr/local/bin/ksh

#html_list.ksh
#Usage: html_list.ksh [name of directory to list]

#define the output file as a variable change only this variable to
change it.

output_file=/home/arat/dirindex.html

#Write header information to file
print '<html><head></head><body>' > $output_file

#Okay, grab the directory listing and append it to the file.

find $1 | while read file
name
do
 print '<A href="'"$filename"'">'"$filename"'</A><BR>' >> $output_file
done

#Append the final statement
print '</body></html>' >> $output_file

#---------------------------End Script---------------------------

Be sure to check the cd/rw/dvd combo drive, too. I've never dealt with a combo 
drive, but MDK9 defaults to DMA off on my desktop's DVD drive (actually, my 
DVD drive doesn't handle DMA all that well anyway, but who knows).

That's wierd - the kernel defaulted to dma being on for both my DVD and
CD-RW drives - and I don't have a well-supported chipset.  I have to
manually set DMA for my hard drive.  Go figure.  :-)

Either way, unless you're playing a DVD or reading from the drive or
writing to it, DMA on the combo drive shouldn't come in to play in
general system performance.

Good tip, Cooper.

I've got a bunch Micronics M6Me (P-Pro) boards at work that will fall back
to "unoptimized" defaults if they are interrupted during POST.
Essentially, they turn the L2 cache off, resulting in incredibly pitiful
performance. I've rebooted servers with these a few times, neglecting to
make sure the cache was enabled, then pounding my head on the nearest hard
surface trying to figure out why they were booting sooooooo sloooooowly.
Doh!

I can't get my Hoontech Sound Track YMF-754 XG D/B I card to make

I fired up the alsamixer and played with all the sliders.  It
does look like the sliders match the functions of the card, some
of which are unique, like S/PDIF i/o.  This leads me to believe
that something is right.  But, aplay doesn't cause any sound to
come out of the speakers.  A CD playing app. doesn't make any
sound either.

Any ideas folks?

Thanks....

Just a thought: Boot to the command line (don't start X) and play an mp3/ogg 
with mpg123/ogg123. If it works, you may have an issue with aRts (or a 
similiar sound server for a non-KDE environment (I think GNOME uses esound)).

I'll try that.  I was using IceWM when trying to get sound.  I don't 
think it has any sound server issues.

One reason might be that you don't usually run Apache on your
CD-ROM's.

I created an online photo album that is generated with a single fairly
simple Makefile.  It takes a directory full of full-sized images named
*.JPG and builds thumbnails, medium-sized images and the necessary
HTML glue to hold them all together.  Works pretty well by itself with
a web server.  

Trouble is, when multiple such directories full of images are burned
on a CD-ROM, browsers don't provide very nice ways of navigating the
folders.  I found it useful to provide some top-level HTML glue.

That's what I needed to point me towards the answer - always start with
the question! It was indeed a DNS problem. I successfully pinged yahoo
by ip address. My problem was not realizing that /etc/resolv.conf was
empty. I got out the notebook from Ed Sawiki's Linux Networking course,
looked up the section on DNS, found the place where he describes
configuring the resolver, looked on my Debian system to see what it had
for resolv.conf, and entered that into the empty resolv.conf on the RH8
system.

The world is a brighter place this morning. Thanks for the help!

What hard drive is in the machine at work? I'm guessing you bought something nice while Dell tends to put cheap stuff in theirs. Also the Soyo is a pretty good chipset once again Dell not so much. The other reason is in almost everything except multimedia the Athlons tend to do better than the P4s. Also have you built a nice custom kernel for one and not for the other. Turning on processor support when building a kernel can make a *huge* difference.

Here's the situation.

I have a machine at home configured like so:

Athlon XP 1800+
Soyo kt333 motherboard
512 mb RAM
40 gb hard drive
32 mb ATI video card
DVD drive
Creative CD-RW 12/10/32
Mandrake 9.0

At work, I have the following configuration:

P4 2.4 ghz
Dell mb (Sorry, it's a dell workstation. work bought it for me...)
1 gb RAM
40 gb hard drive
32 mb ATI video card
cd/dvd/cdrw combo drive
Mandrake 9.0

Here's the catch... The Athlon can handle more load than the P4. I'm
writing this message while downloading files, burning a CD, listening to 
mp3s, and untaring BIG tarballs. No problem at all. 

If I try this same thing at work, the system is EXTREMELY sluggish. The
mouse pointer jumps instead of smoothly crossing the screen, I can't
drag windows around. It's hard to get the mouse pointer to stop on the
window bar, let alone on a corner...

Why would the P4 be such a dog (besides the fact that "it's a dell,
man."

I've got an 8100.  It was installed by default with Windows XP.  Just 
recently I wiped it and installed W2k and Gentoo.  It runs quite well, 
hardware is detected easily and is pretty snappy for a sub-Ghz machine.

Knoppix runs nearly flawlessly on it as well (wireless nic was the only 
thing it didn't auto-detect).

Take a look here:  http://www.linux-laptop.net/

They've got TONS of howtos on installing your distro of choice on your 
laptop of choice.  If there's a laptop out there that can run Linux, 
chances are someone has it, has done it, and has a howto up on that site.

Good luck.

Thanks to everyone who sent help. I found that my Athlon system has all
the DMA stuff turned on by default, and the Dell (Smell?) P4 has it all
turned off by default. 

However, there's no joy in Muddville this morning, as here's the results
of my attempts to turn it on.

First, I rebooted, and verified that DMA (UDMA in this case) is enabled
in BIOS.

There is no POST screen on a DELL Optiplex. It just shows the stupid
Dell logo. Like I didn't know it was a Dell?

When I run hdparm /dev/hda, I get this:

[root at ciclid root]# hdparm /dev/hda

/dev/hda:
multcount    = 16 (on)
IO_support   =  0 (default 16-bit)
unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
using_dma    =  0 (off)
keepsettings =  0 (off)
readonly     =  0 (off)
readahead    =  8 (on)
geometry     = 4865/255/63, sectors = 78165360, start = 0
	
I can turn on IO_support:

[root at ciclid root]# hdparm -c1 /dev/hda

/dev/hda:
setting 32-bit IO_support flag to 1
IO_support   =  1 (32-bit)
 
But I'm unable to turn on dma mode:

[root at ciclid root]# hdparm -d1 -X34 /dev/hda

/dev/hda:
setting using_dma to 1 (on)
HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Operation not permitted
setting xfermode to 34 (multiword DMA mode2)
using_dma    =  0 (off)
    
I've been googling for awhile now, and I don't find much in the way of
help. At this point, I'm assuming the chipset is not supported.

  There's a domain, mail.com, that's infested with spammers. But, if I put
in a postfix filter, /mail\.com/	REJECT, in the header_checks file,
then domains such as hotmail.com are also rejected. Not a bad idea, but not
practical, unfortunately.

  Would specifying the regex as /@mail\.com/	REJECT solve this problem
and limit the rejection to only the mail.com domain? If not, is there a way
of writing the expression to catch the one and not all of the others?

TIA,

Hit ESC when the Dell screen comes up, or just hit DEL (or F1, F12, or 
whatever it is that Dell uses nowadays).

Chances are that there's a BIOS setting (or two or seven) keeping things 
slow.

Find out what the chipset is.

/sbin/lspci should give you a route to start with.  Or googling for your
specific dell model.

Once we know what kind of chipset it is, we can find out what we need to
do in the kernel to get 'er working well.  There is likely support
*somewhere* for it - be it in the form of a few obscure kernel settings
or a patch to the kernel... or maybe using a -pre kernel.

Is it a brand new Dell?

Thanks to everyone who sent help. I found that my Athlon system has all
the DMA stuff turned on by default, and the Dell (Smell?) P4 has it all
turned off by default. 

However, there's no joy in Muddville this morning, as here's the results
of my attempts to turn it on.

First, I rebooted, and verified that DMA (UDMA in this case) is enabled
in BIOS.

There is no POST screen on a DELL Optiplex. It just shows the stupid
Dell logo. Like I didn't know it was a Dell?

When I run hdparm /dev/hda, I get this:

[root at ciclid root]# hdparm /dev/hda

/dev/hda:
multcount    = 16 (on)
IO_support   =  0 (default 16-bit)
unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
using_dma    =  0 (off)
keepsettings =  0 (off)
readonly     =  0 (off)
readahead    =  8 (on)
geometry     = 4865/255/63, sectors = 78165360, start = 0
	
I can turn on IO_support:

[root at ciclid root]# hdparm -c1 /dev/hda

/dev/hda:
setting 32-bit IO_support flag to 1
IO_support   =  1 (32-bit)
 
But I'm unable to turn on dma mode:

[root at ciclid root]# hdparm -d1 -X34 /dev/hda

/dev/hda:
setting using_dma to 1 (on)
HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Operation not permitted
setting xfermode to 34 (multiword DMA mode2)
using_dma    =  0 (off)
    
I've been googling for awhile now, and I don't find much in the way of
help. At this point, I'm assuming the chipset is not supported.

How about /^mail\.com/.  I'm guessing postfix peels the doamin out of the 
address - everything after the @ so this would only match mail.com

I just had to take this chance to brag.

I block all domains named *mail.com. 
I block all of Asia and Africa. 
I block all of AOL.
I block all of netzero and juno and yahoo and any other webmail type services that come to my attention.
I block MSN.
I block Earthlink.

Having said that my advice may be a bit extreme. Why not block hotmail. In this day and age who really uses hotmail or Yahoo or anything else like it for real mail anymore. And if you have friends or whoever that do just put them in a "whitelist" and block the rest. But as you can see from the above there is a large portion of the species I just don't want to talk to. But that's just me.

  There's a domain, mail.com, that's infested with spammers. But, if I put
in a postfix filter, /mail\.com/	REJECT, in the header_checks file,
then domains such as hotmail.com are also rejected. Not a bad idea, but not
practical, unfortunately.

  Would specifying the regex as /@mail\.com/	REJECT solve this problem
and limit the rejection to only the mail.com domain? If not, is there a way
of writing the expression to catch the one and not all of the others?

TIA,

The CD player apps just talk to the CD-ROM drive - not the sound card. 
If everything is working properly on the hardware end of things, the
CD-ROM plays, no software involved.

Wow that was a lot of modules loaded!  I have 21 loaded and thought that
was a bit insane.

You might think about looking at alsa-project.org for any notes specific
to your soundcard... maybe there's something somewhere you need to tweak
that Mandrake didn't catch.

I don't know about OSS-free drivers, but the ALSA drivers for the sound
chip in the 8200 are lacking.  It uses the i8x0 driver, as does a
bajillion other chips (including my nForce), so they have a hard time
implamenting anything for it.  If you do any sound recording either line
in or mic doesn't work.  There's also no hardware mixing support in the
alsa drivers - although the hardware itself seems to support it.  I
believe there are OSS drivers (free or commercial - I don't recall) that
say they support hardware mixing (multiple audio streams) but in
reality, the guy whose email I read said it didn't work.

That's about all I know about the 8200... it looks like a good laptop. 
I plan on buying one (or something similar) after I have a little bit of
cash.  :-)

You should do that, and anchor the end.

/@mail\.com/  matches:
   mail.com
   mail.computers.net

If you think in filesystem wildcards, then it would look like this:

@mail.com*

If you anchor the end, /@mail\.com$/ then it should do the right
thing.

Is the controller set to Auto mode?
If so it may be that the drive doesnt support "standard" DMA modes. Try
setting it to a manual mode 3 or 4. (if the bios lets you)

Hello Linux folkz,
Could somebody please give me an example of iptables
configuration which allows to pass mail traffic through the
firewall and redirect it to the mail server behind the firewall.
And the same I'd like to achive for the web server which is 
a separate host as well.
Thank you in advance for any ideas or sources of information.

What type of RAM?  I've seen a LOT of Dell's running very fast P4's with
only PC133 (SDRAM) memory (doesn't matter how much there is it is still
slow).  Talk about a huge waste of silicon.  Most of these will have the
stupid integrated video (sounds like yours doesn't though), that uses
system memory as video memory, another huge waste of silicon.  This
combination will make a 200MMX look fast.  This combination sells
because of the P4's impressive clock speed, not because of the actual
performance.

The Athlon is running DDR memory (the only memory the kt333 can use).

There may be more to it, but this is probably a factor.

This could also be a mouse configuration problem.

I don't see how, with 1Gig of RAM, the DMA state of the harddrive will
make the mouse sluggish.  I really can't imagine any swapping going on. 
Harddrive speed will affect application startup time, file copies and
other read-write activities, but not the mouse movement or general
application usage.

Does your machine have adequate swap space available?

How much memeory does your machine have, and how much swap space are you
using?

My original post was more about general slowness and treating the mouse as a side effect of that.

But it is interesting that you should bring up the mouse. On my brand new Athlon system at home I have a USB trackball. When I was first setting it up I had some issues with getting the USB working right, a 2.4.19 configuration thing that I had a hard time finding, but in any case for a short time I had my trackball set up as a PS2 device and now that you mention it as a PS2 device the mouse sucked to the point of pain. Not sure if this helps but I have seen something similar.

Thanks for your suggestion.
The problem is that people whos data is stored on this file server
have no clue how to encrypt/decrypt their data files.
They are typical M$ drones.
If you can somehow retrieve encrypted data files and brake encryption
even on one file, all other files of that particular user are
accessable.
Is there any better solution?

DMA doesn't directly speed up hard disk access so much as it may be
implied...

DMA reduces the amount of CPU power needed to access the hard drive.

If you're doing any kind of disk activity, your CPU utilization will
spike, and that can cause the mouse to jump around like was described.

In reducing the amount of CPU power used when doing anything with the
drive, DMA *does* speed up disk access, though.  I would guestimate as
CPU speeds increase, DMA vs non-DMA in terms of drive speed will become
less of an issue - but in overall system performance I think it will
remain relevant.

When making a new thread, it is nice to create a new post rather than
replying to an old one - your post comes up as a response to the "Regex
help requested" thread on my threaded mail client.  :-)

If you google about a bit, you should find information regarding both
encrypted file systems and loopback encrypted file systems - it is my
understanding the latter is more secure than the former.

Remember, though, that nothing is fool-proof.  There's always a way to
get at the data.

Oh, I think Mandrake (which is icky, imho) has native support for
encrypted filesystems (loopback and not).

If I set any -X mode without the -d mode on, performance goes down.

In any mode, the best I've gotten is about 5 MB/sec.

No, actually, I've verified that UDMA mode is on in the BIOS.

On any machine running a 500Mhz processor or better, the spike will be
small enough that the mouse should have lots of cycles left for itself.

Rod,

  Postfix reads (and processes) one line at a time. The caret (^) means
'beginning of line', so that won't work here. It's a regex string match

Thanks much,

Russ,

Thanks for the hard numers!

It looks to me the same as it does to you... everything checks out,
except, of course, the responsiveness of the machine. and found this:

I looked at the UDMA mini-howto and found this
(http://leuksman.com/linux/Ultra-DMA-8.html):

  ``Normally, a UDMA-aware kernel will automatically enable UDMA support
for drives and interfaces that support it. In most cases that it
doesn't, the kernel either doesn't know how to drive your IDE chipset
(get yourself a patch, see above) or doesn't believe it is safe to
enable it (meaning you shouldn't!).''

When one follows the link to the patch, I get this for hdparam:

``UDMA support is provided for at least the following chipsets, and
probably many more I don't know about:''

  All Intel chipsets: FX, HX, VX, TX, LX
  All SiS chipsets (only SiS5598 tested, but this entire family of 

At this point a caviet: This documentation may be a bit dated. 

I then went out to look at what your motherboard chipset might be.
ExtremeTech tells me that if it's a Dell Dimention then it probably has
an Intel 845E chipset.

Off to http://groups.google.com to search for `Linux UDMA 845E.'

Bingo!

There's a patch for this. Also, there's tons of information about
hdparam in regard to the Intel chipsets!

Best,


Cooper

  There are two problems with this approach -- for me, at least. First, I
deal with lots of digitally challenged folks who use these services because
they're free or because they don't know any better. Not all these people are
bad or not worth communications. I also have clients with accounts at these
domains.

  Second, I have postfix check the entire set of headers because spammers
frequently direct their dreck to my secondary mail server (at my ISP) rather
than directly to me. This also means that a message sent to me as well as to
other folks may have hotmail, yahoo or aol in the header because that's
where other recipients get their mail. No reason to block mail to me because
others are also on the "To: " list.

Colin,

  I pondered this, but realized that there may well be a closing parenthesis
after the address, or some other symbol. That's why I didn't use the end of
line metacharacter.

  If this had a simple solution I'm sure I would have stumbled over it by
now. :-)

You need to define your problem better.  This is a proverbial bag-o-goop 
  - if you push hard on one thing (e.g., having files individually 
protected), you're going to be pushed back elsewhere (e.g., requiring 
the users to be clueful).

The first question is why are you seeking to do this?  Are you, per 
chance, trying to comply with HIPAA? :-)  If you're motivated by 
external requirements, it may be better to ask how others are solving 
this specific problem instead of asking about a generic solution.

The second question is if you're comingling requirements.  Do you really 
need to have combined encryption and access control?  Or can you 
separate them - handle encryption entirely on a closed file server 
(protecting the disk from mirroring), and use standard access control 
tools to limit access?  Or do you need to protect the data in transit, 
which means you need something like NFS-over-SSH or SMB+SSL?  Or perhaps 
you can use a standard file server since the files are stored and sent 
in ciphertext, and all decryption is done by the individual client.

Finally (for now), it also sounds like you may be looking for an 
analogue to the per-file encryption in W2K.  At least, what they 
advertise it to be - I think there's some question about how well they 
implement it.  (If you're not familiar with it, I believe the filesystem 
is extended to include support for public key crypto - each user has 
their private key bound to them, and protected files have their 
symmetric encryption key encrypted with authorized user's public keys, 
so you get transparent access to encrypted files.  Sorta like GnuPG 
pushed into the FS layer.

It sounds like you need something like /@mail\.com\([^a-zA-Z0-9.-]\|$\)/

I'm not familiar with the regex's used in postfix, so I don't know
whether this will actually work.  The intent is to match mail.com either
when it is followed by either a character which is not valid in a domain name
or end of line.

How about

  /[@\.]mail\.com/

Or, if these regexes are perl-compatible

  /[@\.]mail\.com\b/

That'd catch anything from @mail.com or .mail.com, and rule out 
hotmail.com, etc.

I'm not trying to comply with anything. This solution should solve

Imagine situation, when burglars,FBI,CIA or other crooks are breaking
into your office and taking your server or hard drive away to look
into your secret data files.
What method of data protection should be chosen in this situation
besides glueing a brick of dynamite to the each hard drive? :)
Securing data in transit is also very important, but there are many
different concepts were developed already to cover this area.

I googled and found this:

http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/linux/udma.htm

Which contains the following footnote:

ICH4 requires kernel 2.5.12 or later to enable any DMA mode

Since this is my work machine, and I'm not willing to possibly corrupt
things, I'll have to live with it until a more stable kernel comes
out...

Crypto is the answer to the questions you have asked. Learn how to use it and implement it. If the data is that important you will have to educate your lusers anyway.

Imagine situation, when burglars,FBI,CIA or other crooks are breaking
into your office and taking your server or hard drive away to look
into your secret data files.
What method of data protection should be chosen in this situation
besides glueing a brick of dynamite to the each hard drive? :)
Securing data in transit is also very important, but there are many
different concepts were developed already to cover this area.

Woah!  Where do you get THAT?  THat's not extrapolated from his answer
above.  That still matches the previous example of "mail.computers.com" or
"mail.communicator.net".  You want to match mail.com ONLY when it's
followed by a illegal domain character or an end of line.

Note the carat at the beginning of the bracketted phrase.  This means NOT
one of those characters.  So if mail.com is followed by a character that
is not one of the characters you can put in a domain name, then the end of
the domain name has been reached and you've started on something else
(like a delmiter of some kind) OR the end of the line, which the |$
catches.

Dig?

Subject: [PLUG] mpg123 for RH 8
Message-ID: <3DDABFB1.80C057E5@attbi.com>

Red Hat 8.0 does not include mpg123 due to mp3 the restrictions on the
mp3 technology. So, my new install of RH 8.0 won't play my mp3
collection. No problem. I'll just download the source, compile and
install it, and I'm back to where I was.

Did that, but the sound quality is choppy.

The source of the problem is not clear to me. I've noticed that RH 8.0
does more paging than RH 7.0 did on the same hardware (Pentium 200 MMX,
64 Mb RAM). With only two terminal windows open, one running top, and
the other from which I launched mpg123, top shows from 54.1% to 78.6%
idle.

Any idea what the problem is?

The version of mpg123 I downloaded and installed is mpg123-0.59r.

There is an rpm file on my RH 7.0 CD, mpg123-0.59r-8.i386.rpm. Would I
have been able to install that on RH 8.0? Should I have. It's not clear
to me whether it would have made a difference. If it might, will
installing it override the version I just installed?

Thanks for any ideas. (Suggestions that I should be using oog instead of
mp3 are fine, but I have all these mp3 files. I'd consider switching,
assuming that would make a difference in the quality of the sound, if
there is a way to convert mp3 files to oog.)

OK I am a full on misanthrope but how do you get class warfare out of that list? I block all of them because they are the source of a great deal of all spam. AOL, MSN, and Earthlink are by no means cheap. Really the only reason I block Earthlink is because so many people use it. I also block a *bunch* of other neblocks.

So no I have nothing against poor people having been poor for more than a few years I know it sucks. Now if you want to get into a conversation about welfare I'd think we would have radically differing onions.

Ah yes converting MP3 to ogg. Don't do it both a lossy formats and they are lossy in different ways. This means that a file converted from MP3 to ogg will sound like crap. OTOH rip all your new stuff in ogg. It produces smaller files that , to me, sound just as good or better. I'm far from a golden ear though. 

I can't speak to rpms but if this was a deb the answer would be that you most likely would be able to. But I don't think that will solve your problem. What might given the info you have thrown out is applying the low latency patch and building yourself a shiny new kernel.

Setting maxlogins in /etc/security/limits.conf does not do the trick and
I'm not having much luck googling it.

As I'm not using RH, I haven't really looked into it, but apparently something 
about RH8's kernel is causing CPU usage issues with certain applications

If you do start moving to ogg, don't convert from mp3. There are utilities to 
do it, but both are lossy formats, and the quality will end up, at best, the 
same as the original mp3, but likely worse than if you'd left them as mp3's.

That said, ogg does produce higher quality sound at the same bitrates, if 
you're encoding straight from the source (the CD). It also uses good VBR 
techniques to further reduce filesize without sacrificing quality.

The main drawback to ogg, aside from lack of widespread adoption, is that 
current decoders are slower than those for mp3. This might be an issue 
considering you're only on a P200. Encoding is slower, too, but that's a 
one-time penalty.

Cool.  Thanks for the input.  After discussing it with my wife (and more
research), we decided to go with a Toshiba, and for now, keep windows on
it.  I will eventually partition it to see how it does with Linux, and
if all is well go from there.

As much as I like the idea of supporting open source, I think I'll stick

I'm not likely to upgrade this machine anytime soon, and I know it used
to sound good, so I'll pursue the problem from that end. Always
something new to learn about.

I just had another thought. Is maybe the 8 kernel "optimized" for newer processors and the 7.3 kernel was not? This may very well explain the difference.

I googled HTML escaping because I didn't understand what the issue was. I found
an example CGI and following by example I thought this would work. Does this
cover the issue or are there other characters that break the output? It seems
to deal with <BLINK> correctly.

find $1 | while read filename ; do
		htmlfilename=`print $filename | sed -e 's/&/\&amp;/g'  -e
's/\"/\&quot;/g' -e 's/>/\&gt;/g' -e 's/</\&lt;/g'`
		print '<A href="'"$filename"'">'"$htmlfilename"'</A><BR>' |
grep blink >> $output_file
done

I found what I was looking for... by default Samba ignores the PAM account
and session management. Adding the following line to the globals section
of the smb.conf changes this behavior:

	obey pam restrictions = yes

Do you really think poor people always buy the cheapest thing?  Check out
the clothes the kids working at your local Taco Bell are wearing.

Consider that these are the largest ISPs and most people have them because
of some false economy from promotions (free 1025 hours, free with PC
purchase, etc.) or inundation through media combined with poor education
and a lack of access to the technical elite.

The perceived necessity of high cost goods and services is one of the
methods by which the poor are kept poor.

The vast majority of the people who use the services you block are poor.  
The reasons WHY that is are actually irrelevant.  The point is that you
are primarily blocking poor people.

> I also block a *bunch* of other neblocks.

Right, like asia and africa where poor brown people live.

You know that it sucks to be poor, but that doesn't prove you have nothing
against them.  Hell, you openly state your contempt for all humanity (and
I'm not even going into the self-loathing aspect of misanthropy).

I can guess your view, certainly.  A misanthrope would have no interest at
all in improving the welfare of people.

Ah, very nice. I was starting to look at feeding "smbstatus -b" to awk
as a preexec script, but that sounds much better! :-) I'll try it out.

Dude, take it OFF of the main list.

Regardless of what you may think his reasoning is, the fact remains that 
those ISP's, AND those countries are where a great majority of the spam 
comes from.

People build their regexps based on the amount and type of spam they get 
from each location, not due to regional demographics.  I wouldn't block 
aracnet.com because they cater to 'middle income white people in the 
portland/metro area', I'd block them because AND ONLY because they were 
(hypothetically, of course) spamming my email account.  That's IT.  End 
of story.

Stop trying to read things into why people do the things they do. 
People are chaotic.  We don't have to HAVE a reason.  If we don't like 
it, it goes into the bit bucket.

Sheesh.

You may have a point about the AOL and MSN thing. I've never thought about that.
As for Asia I've lived there for at least 4 years since 1990 and my wife is Asian therefore making my children half-Asian. The reason I block Asia and Africa is simply because they have so many open relays and thus a large percentage of spam comes from those two places.

I have offered to help people I know there close these relays they simply are not interested. Leaving me with no choice but to block. Now there are clear reasons also why all of these things tend to generate spam. Let me just say this again. I block these things because that tends to be where spam comes from until your post I had never thought about the poor aspect. It is interesting but not really important to me.

As for welfare I'm all for improving the welfare of people because in the long run it helps me and means they will tend to leave me alone. I'm just not for giving them welfare mostly because from what I've seen that does nothing to improve their welfare. 

So accusing me of hating poor people is wrong I hate spammers. I also happen to have no desire to communicate with people I don't already know. This makes it easy for me to implement aggressive filtering.

I agree that this shouldn't be on the list, so I'm not going to further
the discussion on this list.  We can go to plug-talk, if you like.

Mostly, I appreciate what you wrote.  Just a couple of TINY comments.

This really has nothing to do with blocking asia.

As a self-proclaimed misanthrope, you hate all people, no?

This is a slightly different problem, but I personally believe the
pervasiveness of this idea is perhaps the greatest problem facing our
society and culture.  Quite possibly it is the root problem for most of
our social ills.

As per the samba docs:

http://us6.samba.org/samba/ftp/docs/htmldocs/smb.conf.5.html#OBEYPAMRESTRICTIONS

"Note that Samba always ignores PAM for authentication in the case of
encrypt passwords = yes  . The reason is that PAM modules cannot support
the challenge/response authentication mechanism needed in the presence
of SMB password encryption."

Okay. This cannot be good. I'd like to have PAM authentication and yet I
can gaurantee you that I'm not sending passwords cleartext, even if I
could as I believe later implementations of Microsoft's SMB call for
encrypted passwords only.

Hello, pluggers!

First off, I was impressed with the turnout at the clinic. That was ver'
kewl to see that kind of response.

That said, I need help, dagnabbit!

I'm trying to set up VPN on our network. I've got Mandrake 9.0 for the
server and Win2k clients. I've also got FreeS/Wan on the server, and IPSEC
looks like it's up and running - ipsec verify returns everything hunky.

I have a Hawking firewall and it (supposedly) passes VPN traffic just fine.
I had VPN installed on our last server (NT4) and VPN worked just fine.

When I try to VPN locally from my machine, I get no answer (error 678).

Any tips/tricks/pointers/help on getting Win2k clients to VPN into a Linux
server?

Thanks in advance,

I tried this, and couldn't get it work, everything claimed to be
installed and functioning, but it still wouldn't work.  After a week of
not getting it to work, I gave up.  There are other VPN implementations
out there.

The Windows implementation of VPN (uses Microsoft protocol, PPTP) is
very different from the FreeSwan implementation (uses ipsec, which must
be installed on the clients).  For the Windows version, I use PopTop
(check Source Forge) on the linux server and the native Windows
"Dial-up" VPN.  The drawback to this is the use of the GRE internet
protocol, which some firewalls have a tough time forwarding, and only
one GRE tunnel can be forwarded through a firewall at a time.

I think that may be what we have, as the firewall docs say I can only have
one VPN user at a time. I'm possibly looking at getting a Cisco router
instead of the Firewall that we have, so I dunno...

I understand that, but if you get 3 people together you'll have at least 
4 different opinions on what the "data security problems" are.  We need 
to know what YOU consider to be the problem before we can give specific 
advice.

If you're worried about the FBI or CIA, I'm not sure how much I want to 
help.... It's not that I trust them, but if they have a search warrant 
they can demand the decryption key and search the disk anyway.  If you 
want to prevent this, you want to be ready to commit obstruction of 
justice and that makes me wonder why.

At the same time, I fully understand the need to protect legally 
confidential material (financial, medical, etc.  People have found 
highly sensitive material, e.g., names and HIV test results, on 
discarded disks) or trade secrets from competitors and have no problem 
helping you protect this information.

(BTW, if you're serious you'll also store the disk's serial number 
inyour safe.  Why should the bad guys bother stealing your disk, copying 
it, and then risking getting it back into your machine when they could 
just swap in a bad disk?)

Anyway, this means your solution must involve one of the on-disk 
encryption approaches.  I tend to favor the loopback filesystem with 
encryption, but once mounted anyone with access to your filesystem can 
see all of the files on the encrypted disk, modulo the regular 
permissions.  Others prefer the CFS approach, which uses a specialized 
NFS server, since it doesn't make the contents available to everyone on 
the system and it doesn't require you to set aside dedicated space for 
it.  (That also means that somebody can immediately identify all of the 
space consumed by encrypted files - with the loopback device you don't 
know if an encrypted GB partition is empty or full.)

The other concern is that you need to be able to export whatever 
solution you use.  I think a "loopback" approach is much lower than a 
CFS approach - you can probably export a loopback FS via NFS or Samba, 
but may not be able to do so with CFS.  But I could easily be wrong 
about this.  (As a rule "like can't export like," so I doubt NFS can 
export a partition mounted by NFS/CFS.)

> Securing data in transit is also very important, but there are many
> different concepts were developed already to cover this area.

That's not the only concern.  What about somebody who copies the 
exported files to ZIP disk or CD-R file on the client system?  Or email 
a copy of the file to somebody outside of the company?  It makes no 
sense to install a heavy steel door while you leave the windows wide open.

I checked into the website.  According to the documentation there, my

having trouble mounting it.  I have tried several different iterations
but keep coming up with this error /dev/<whatever> is not a valid block

1).  What am I doing wrong.
2).  Is NTFS supported?  I'm asking because I'm not sure if I have an

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

This is what I had to do to get my USB drive working:

Had to fdisk it first.  Note this will destroy any data you have on the
drive.  While it seems that you should be able to mount an NTFS or FAT32
partition, you'll need support for those file systems in your kernel. 
When I compiled this kernel I thought I was smart and didn't include it. 
Heh can't even read a dos-formatted floppy doh!

So in my machine the usb drive shows up under /dev/sda, therefore:
fdisk /dev/sda
Make a small partition to start out with, perhaps 1GB.  For some reason on
my drive when I try to use make the partition fill to the drive maximum
size, it tends to hang during fdisk and didn't even complete overnight. 
If I make it even say just 1GB smaller than the 40GB capacity, it fdisks
in about 5 minutes or less.

Next you have to make a filesystem.  Of course you must have the chosen
filesystem support in your kernel.  I recommend ext3fs using the following
command:
mke2fs -j /dev/sda1
Note that sda1 is the partition you just got done making in fdisk.

Finally you have to mount it.  So pick a place to mount the drive, I used
/mnt/usbhd,
mkdir /mnt/usbhd
mount -t auto /dev/sda1 /mnt/usbhd/

That worked for me.  It is actually a usb2.0 hard drive that is
bass-ackwards compatible with 1.1.  It seems to function okay, is pretty
slow, and is subject to what appear to be strange timeouts.  However have
found that if I am patient, the timeouts will eventually complete.

Hope this helps.

Thanks for the help. I do want to preserve the data on the disk.  Is
there anyway to do this without losing the data on the drive.  I can
mount a dos floppy disk, so that shouldn't be an issue.

Then try just this part:
mkdir /mnt/usbhd
mount -t auto /dev/sda1 /mnt/usbhd/

See what that does for you.  The auto should (assuming your kernel can
read it) mount the drive automagically.  If it doesn't, then my guess is
that the kernel needs that filesystem support loaded in.  The file system
has nothing to do with usb drivers; usb doesn't much care about
filesystems.  It all depends on whether your kernel has the right smarts
to read whatever the drive formatted as.  Save yourself the trouble of
guessing and check the drive on your windows machine; I can't recall how
but it should be very easy to determine under file explorer (right-click
and properties I think).

Someone here with more knowledge than I can tell you how to determine what
filesystem support your kernel already has.

Thanks.  Believe it or not, my windows machine crashed and I am facing a
reinstall, I want to take my old drive and move some files over to linux
using the USB connection (if possible).  I'm testing with another drive
that I used on my Windows machine to test it out.

I'm doing it the hard way now by taking another hard drive making it
master, reinstalling windows on it and then taking the data of my
original master drive (which I've made slave) because it'll take less
time than figuring out th USB or IEEE 1394 mounting issue.  It's
interesting that there is very little documentation on the 'net about
mounting a usb drive.  When I have some more time, I will try to figure
it out.  Perhaps I will have better luck with the IEEE 1394 card I have
on my other computer.

I think USB drive support is new or has just changed in the kernel or
something similar - I thought I read something about it somewhere, but
can't remember specifics.

I haven't been following the thread closely, but I got the jist that you
couldn't mount it - because you didn't have information about it... the
filesystem or the actual location on the /dev tree.

Since you didn't know if there was NTFS support or not in Linux, I'm
assuming you didn't compile your own kernel.  Try modprobe ntfs and see
if you get any errors... if not, bam, you have NTFS support.  FAT
support, I would think, would be compiled in ... if not, I'll bet it
autoloads.

Now run fdisk /dev/sda as root.  Your disto may have your CD-ROM (or RW
or DVD) drive loaded as ide-scsi emulation, so if that fails, try
/dev/sdb, then c, or d, etc.  If it launches with no errors, hit p to
print the partition table - that should give you your format type and
your location on the dev tree.

Then just go from there... mount it as you would any other hard disk. 
:-)

Is this a new setup?  Perhaps the tape drive has parity disabled.  I 
would also try reseating all the connectors.  Make certain both ends
of the bus are properly terminated.

Message-ID: <1037770070.4258.4.camel@alexlinux.qwest.net>

Here's an update to the paper size from way back when on the 26th of
September this year.

There are 3 places that you need to change the paper size at in order
for this to work but work it will.

according to: http://www.jca.umbc.edu/FAQ_Computing.html

"There is no way (AFAIK) that a user can change their default page
 size. But the SysAdmin may do so by editting the file:

/path/to/OpenOffice/share/psprint/psprint.conf

In this file, look for the parameter: PPD_PageSize . Set it to an
appropriate value, like Letter."


The file is nicely commented; changing it worked great on my
 installation

Specific to your issue, no.  But I do see a lot of postings to the 
freeswan-list discussing W2K to Linux/freeswan configurations.  I believe 
most of those folks are using a commercial client from ssh.com called "SSH 
Sentinal" (IIRC).  There is a gent from ssh.com that consistently posts 
trying to help people out.

I'm just starting figuring it out, at this point I can point to the howto with

I honestly don't know the answer, but is $25/hour better than $0/hour?

What are the other two places? I only made the one change and it solved 
my problems. I did find two other places in my system's psprint.conf 
file but those paper size values were associated with the two printers 
I have setup. I was able to setup the appropriate paper size for each 
printer when I set them up in the admin program.

Thanks,

It doesn't percentify the HREF yet.  Mine did.
A file named "please <blink me>" needs to look like:

  <a href="please%20&lt;blink%20me&gt;">please &lt;blink me&gt;</a>

So there's URI (%-ing) and HTML escaping on the HREF=, and
there's HTML escaping on the visible text.

Seems OK for PHP, since that's more lightweight than a scalable language
like Perl.

:-)

Having said that, I see quite a few low-ball offers coming over the
job lists.  And they'll probably fill them, because of the glut of
people.

But remember, you get what you pay for.  If you have a site that
handles credit cards or private information, do you really want
someone who will work for $25/hr to build it?  Sounds like a recipe
for disaster, of class-action lawsuit proportions.

Definitely.
But then, we're just a little record store, not a Big Corporate Business.
Everyone else here works for $8/hr.
(Imagine the movie High Fidelity.  That's us.)

I'm not looking for someone to have 20 years experience.
Just looking for someone who knows their PHP and would rather do programming at a cool music store than some other boring day job.

This looks like the ticket.

performance loss?

So how much do you pay your lawyer?  Your doctor?

The point being that rates are determined by the amount of experience 
and effort that goes into being qualified for the job, not just how much 
everyone else is paid.  I might not like paying a plumber or electrician 
$100/hour for work, but I know that it's usually going to be cheaper 
than me doing it myself.  (And redoing it when I screw it up the first 
time, repairnig the extra damage caused by the first attempt, etc.)

Assuming that you can figure out which guy deserves $50/hour instead of 
$25, the "more expensive" guy may be cheaper because he'll get the job 
done right the first time, and has enough similar experience to get it 
out quickly since he's already implemented something similar.  Meanwhile 
the "cheaper" guy may be more expensive since he'll implement stuff that 
could never work in practice, miss deadlines (because he doesn't yet 
have the ability to make good schedule estimates), etc.

Ultimately, it's your call.  But don't pull the "poor little me" line. 
Not unless you can show that your $8/hr workers have spent as much of 
their own time keeping current with their fields as we have.

Huh???

Try

     <a href="please %3cblink me%3e">please &lt;blink me&gt;</a>

or

     <a href="please%20%3cblink%20me%3e">please &lt;blink me&gt;</a>

That is, use HTML encoding outside of the tags (<,> become &lt;,&gt;) 
and hex encoding within the tags (<,> become %3c,%3e)

But I don't see why you need to escape this anyway.  Well, maybe you do 
with some scripting languages that may be over-eager to interpret the 
space, < and > characters.  (I normally use C or java and this isn't an 
issue.)  Normally this encoding is only required for the characters used 
in GET commands (&, ?, =) and possibly characters with the high bit set.

Do you see a lot of unemployed layers or doctors on the streets?  When you
do they'll go for $25/hour too.  Right now there are lots of unemployed
programmers out there and I'm sure a lot of them would be glad to get
$25/hour.

Maybe... but as I said, right now there's plenty of good (there were a
lot of very good people who were working for companies that had bad
business plans - being unemployed right now doesn't say anything about
your level of skills), available talent out there that would be happy to
make $25/hour so they can pay their rent.  It sure beats $8/hour at
Starbucks.  It's the market at work.

It's something we have to get used to...  It's not 1999 anymore.  Hourly
rates are adjusting to market forces by going down and they're likely to
stay there for a while.  I don't like it anymore than anyone else, but
that's the reality.

I saw an article on how the Indian province of Madhya Pradesh adopted free
software for its e-governance and school education programs, even though
Microsoft Corp. expressed interest in sponsoring one of them.

In the article chief minister Digvijay Singh is quoted as saying:

"For us it is not a question of Microsoft versus Linux. It is just a
matter of choosing between a free software and a monopoly. We feel that
when we are putting public information out in the open, then it should not
be through a proprietary software."

For christ's sake, give the guy a break!

I for one am an unemployed programmer (I do mostly, perl) and would be
happy to have a job for $25/hr full time, especially at a small shop
like this.

If you don't want this job then don't apply for it.  If you can find a
better job, then take it.  If all you care about is money and don't have
enough integrity to do a good job for a good job's sake, then maybe they
are better off without you.

BTW, I am not applying for this job so I have nothing to gain by this
rant.  I am just happy to see somebody hiring web programmers and it
bothers me that anyone would complain about someone hiring in this
market.  More power to them for building web applications in a tough
market.

Hi.

Some of y'all helped me a week or so ago when I needed to wire a serial
cable for an old(ish) ethernet switch to get to the management console.

Well, for some reason or other, it didn't work.

I'm pretty sure I wired the cable up properly (everything straight through
except TxD->RxD & RxD->TxD... should something else be crossed over,
too?  Maybe RTS->CTS?  I have no idea), but neither minicom nor
hypterterminal gave me any output at all when I powered up the device and
repeatedly struck the enter key (as the manual suggests).

Does anyone have some reasonable steps I can go through to troubleshoot
this?

Would anyone here have and let me borrow a VT100 terminal that definitely
works so I can at least reduce it to cable/switch (rather than software
configuration) problems?

Any help appreciated.

I found the problem.  Not only do I have to crank up the volume,
but I have to unmute all the channels (and there are lots) that I
care about.  All is well now, and Mandrake Control Center *DID*
it's job to configure my card.  Now if there was just some way to
turn on the speakers by default and set all the volumes low,
maybe 10%.  It seems that I see tons of postings about ALSA
driven sound cards being muted.  Even so, with this new card, I
missed it in the maze of config data.  So, it wasn't my IRQ.

Cheers....

I don't know if this qualifies as "help" or not, but here goes a
couple ideas:

a) I once had trouble talking to a device, I think it was a Cisco 675,
   until I turned _off_ all flow control (hard and soft);

b) maybe you aren't supposed to cross transmit and receive (i.e.,
   whatever document you are looking at didn't intend you to).

Set the volume and everything else how you like it then, as root, run
'alsactl store' and add 'alsactl restore' to your init scripts.

At least, that is how to do it by hand.. I could see some Mandrake tool
automagically doing things for you and messing up the volumes you
save/restore.

I think this is in the ALSA FAQ - www.alsa-project.org.  Check it out.

Yeah, no parity, eight data, one stop... it auto-senses the bitrate, but
that's why you have to hit enter a few times.

Flow control is another story.  There's nothing about it in the manual.

I'll try turning it off completely as Russel suggests.

That's the one flow control setting I have NOT tried...

Well, according to the manual, pin 1 of the RJ45 is transmit and labelled
as "Output".  This tells me that it's not the pin to be wired TO a
transmit on the far end, but to a receive.  Hopefully that's the correct
interpretation.

I suppose there's a chance I wired the whole thing completely
backward...  oh hell.

Any more suggestions?

$0 to both.  Don't have either.

I think the point is also the difference between being a FREELANCE person hired PER PROJECT, where you're entirely responsible for your own taxes, health care, and you don't know if the project will be there for you next week - and being a STEADY EMPLOYEE, where it's a guaranteed steady thing, taxes and health care taken care of, etc.

If I was hiring a QUICK PROJECT person, I'd pay more.   But for a steady employee $25/hr is WAY high for me, it's the equivalent of hiring three new people at once, whereas this PHP work is something I COULD do myself (I already am, right now, and have been for 4 years), but need some extra help doing it now.

Blah blah blah... it's an incredibly cool job for someone who wants it.

The switches and hubs i use here require No Flow Control and a set baud rate
or they wont respond. 
IF your device is fairly old try setting to no flow control and 9600 baud.
>From there go to 19,200 and finally 115,200. One of those should work. Only
other thing i can think of is possible emulation protocol. That usually just
means you will get a garbled screen though if its not right.

I built a pII box, 128Mb RAM, with a total of 3 disk in a LV, 2 at 120GB, ATA 133
5400 RPM and 1 at 100GB, ATA 100, 7200 RPM IDE drives. The two 120GB drives used
the ATA133 PCI cards that came separate with the drives and the 100GB used the
primary on-board IDE channel. The OS lived on a separate 18GB SCSI drive. the
box is running SuSE 8.0. 

I used LVM on the three large disks creating a 300 something GB ( it wasn't 340
but in the ball park ) striped LE. From the FAQ: "In certain situations this
strategy can improve the performance of the logical volume. Be aware however,
that LVs created using striping cannot be extended past the PVs they were
originally created on." 

We are able to do 90+ Mb FTP transfers on a dedicated 100 base network. We
pulled ~90Gb off the box per run; about 3000 files, file sizes where between
64kb and ~4G, each file transfered in its own ftp session (slow approach, my
fault for scripting it this way, but I needed to know if a file transfer
failed), in about four hours. This was the only thing this box and network was
used for.

Thank you
Russell

Do you have access to one of those little "Christmas Trees" as we used 
to call them. They're RS-232 testers with 7 LEDs on them and they have 
a male DB25 connector on one side and female DB25 connector on the 
other. It shows the following signals: TD, RTS, DSR, CD, RD, CTS, DTR. 
I got mine years ago at Radio Shack quite cheaply when I did some part 
time system admin work on a System V Rel 1.5 system that was connected 
to dumb terminals.

I even have what they call a "Breakout Box" called "Easy Bob" that has 
18 LEDs, 25 little switches on it, and bunch of jumper wires for 
connecting different pins together across the unit. I used to use the 
box to help me figure out what pins to use when I had no documentation 
to work with. 

Sure there are certain basic pin connections for RS-232 but back in the 
old days (1980's) there were some strange devices out there that 
required some interesting pin configurations. This sort of equipment 
may be rare now since everything has moved over to ethernet for the 
most part although for debugging the kernel and stuff a serial port and 
terminal is still required I think.

Our new home is in Room 8 of the Huvland Building on campus. A little recon reveals this room to be a fully functioning computer lab complete with overhead projector!

Special thanks to Russell Born of the Computer Facilities department for his hard work and follow-through on this...although it took some time, he really stuck with it! Also I extend my thanks to the Oregon State University Engineering department for their generous contribution of their facilities. 

Our next meeting is scheduled beginning at 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday, November 3rd in room 8 of the Huvland Building. I will send out an official announcement in the coming days. 

So come one, come all! Whether you're a new user, IT professional, student or educator, come on out and enjoy rubbing shoulders with some of the finest computer professionals going. I guarantee you a fun and informative time!

See you there!


Best,


Cooper

I'm not sure if WRQ has a demo of reflections on their site but if they do it
might be worth taking a look at as it can emulate just about everything and at

I went through this process recently using XP and Linux.  Here's what I
did...

1. Downloaded the trial version of PartitionMagic from
www.powerquest.com

2. Changed the size of the NTFS partition

3. Installed Linux (Debian)

This not only kept my install of XP intact, but installing Debian went
off without a hitch.  I poked around a bit on sf.net and freshmeat.net
and didn't really see anything that would split NTFS file systems... but
that doesn't mean there isn't anything, just that I didn't find it :)

Does the demo version of Partitionmagic actually partition now? It has not in
any of the versions I have looked at over the years. The reason for this is
pretty obvious it is for many people a "one use" app and a fully functioning
demo would be selfdefeating in many ways. 

Having said that repartitioning with Partitionmagic and then installling Debian
is a *good* plan and  is the way I built my first dual boot box. I just doubt if
you can do it with the demo version.

Message-ID: <1037808940.484.253.camel@laptop>

Hey,

I remeber someone mentioning a while back about not having a server
complete until it had a serial connection (I believe it was Mr.
Heinlein) and I was wondering how this worked out exactly?  What is the
serial connection for?  And, is it supposed to take the place of a
mouse, keyboard and monitor, or something else?

Thanks

Yeah, the benefits were not mentioned in the initial posting.

$25/hr is more than I'm getting via Intel.  (Who just cut most 
contractors rates by 10%)  At least I'm getting benefits via my agency.

I know I'm worth more than that, but I've also been looking and not 
getting any meaningful nibbles.

For what it's worth, I think $25 would be a low rate for some 
programmers.  Closer to the intermediate or below than the intermediate 
to expert Derek wants.  But it is better than $0.  We do have a bit of a 
glut on our hands.  If I knew PHP, I'd be tempted.  On top of the $25 
you do have flexible hours which isn't too bad.

Jeme,

1)  Have you tried the "minimalist's" cable?
     Just 3 wires:  TxD -> RxD;  RxD -> TxD;
     and  GND -> GND.

     Basically, this is the hardware equivalent of
     Russell's (excellent) suggestion to turn flow
     control off.

2)  Your computer (or terminal) will be DTE.
     Do you know if the hub/switch is DCE or DTE?
     DCE ==> straight-thru cabling.
     DTE ==> null-modem config

IIRC, all that "clear to send", "terminal set ready",
"data set ready" ... is *not* a straight thru connection
for a DTE/DTE (i.e. null-modem) setup, and, in fact,
it can mean stuff like a pin on one side is connected
to *two* pins on the other!

- Don

P.S. Any chance there is a URL to the manufacturers web
site with info about the serial port?

This I haven't tried.  I can do this in the morning.

I'm almost positive it's a DCE.  I called their support desk and the guy
talked to me (even though there's no kind of support contract for this
thing) and told me that he's pretty sure it's a DCE because it was
designed to be connected to a (real) VT100 terminal.  I know that doesn't
necessarily mean anything, but it's the best I've got so far.

I have the manual in PDF.  There are pin-outs for the RJ45 and they say
"use the connector in the kit" for connecting to a PC serial port or a
VT100 terminal.  Needless to say, "the kit" vanished probably a decade
ago.

Which is partly what I was asking in my initial post. I've been living in
Portland for less than a year, and have been working only as a freelancer,
and spending a lot of time yoyo-ing my rates to figure out what's
reasonable. And I've seen Craig's List postings for PHP consultants for as
low as $12-$15. Which makes the job at starbucks with bennies start to look
good. Mm, all the coffee I want and I don't have to think.

Yes, even 12 bucks an hour is better than nothing, especially when rent is
due. And  I know we aren't in the heady days of 1999, when an HTML coder
could bring in $60/hr. But it is also not 1933 either, back when Perl was
the only scripting language around :)

Perl was good enough for my granny, by gosh.

I know a couple o persons who have been unemployed for two years. They are not 
on the streets, thanks to having working spouses, who IMO are far too 
patient. They're not going to find a job that meets their specs, because by 
gosh they are worth way more than anyone's offering. A person can be picky 
when they have a bidding war going for their services. Otherwise, be hush, 
get to work, and be glad to be receiving a living wage. Clerical and temp 
jobs range from $8- $12/hr, no bennies. That's not living wages. Unless you 
live in your parent's basement.

That sounds good, unfortunately it isn't true.

You can have every certification in the book, a PhD, and 25 years
experience, but if you're standing in line for a job with 200 others
with your same skills, you won't be able to demand a higher wage.

If you have 6 months experience, no certs or degree, but you're the
only one around who knows about a particular job, you might be able to
demand a nice wage.

The market decides what a good or service is worth. If you can convince
people to buy your pet rocks for $5000, then they are worth $5000. If
you can only get $50 for your used 2001 Mercedes, then it's only worth
$50.

If he can hire a skilled programmer for $25/hour (or $20 or $10 or
whatever) then good for him. If your time is worth $75/hour to you, but
he can't afford that, then he'll have to find someone who will do it
cheaper, do it himself, or do without.

I love America!

...which is why "worth" means absolutely nothing and should be discarded
along with "deserve" and "earn".

But anyway, the point is that the purpose of the market in labor is to
drive down wages and benefits while driving up per-worker production.  
That's why high unemployment and low growth (i.e. third-world economics)
is ideal for a booming bond market.

We have a situation in this country where all of the essential needs of
the people can be met with far less than 100% employment hence the
enormous demand generation industry (to create industries that don't need
to exist at all), the low quality of consumer goods (to encourage
re-buying), the highest incarceration rate in the industrialized world (to
decrease the number of have-nots on the street that might revolt against
the haves), and a grossly disporportionate military (both to enlist
have-nots and give them false hope and to threaten and repress the
unenlisted).  Of course, that hyper-inflated military is also what allows
us to import goods or off-load labor at a fraction of the real cost by
repressing foreign uprisings as well as domestic.

If you read the business press, they're very straightforward on the goals
of the "new economy" which include labor market flexibility (which means
job insecurity and a perpetually high unemployment rate so that folks will
take whatever wage they're given and won't bitch about cutbacks) and the
transfer of public funds into private power via government contracts
(military and otherwise).  Privatization is exactly that: a privatization
of what was formerly public property.  Many lose for the benefit of the
few.  Privatizing public works means lower wages for most and huge profits
for a small few... and those profits are all tax dollars.  Where a public
agency's goal is to USE all of the money it is given, a private
corporation's goal is to HOARD the money it takes, dispensing as little as
possible.  I ask you which is better for the people and the economy.

Hurray for the new economy.

I'm the Reflection Project Lead and principal developer at ADP. While it's
true that Reflection is a terrific product, it won't help Jeme. It runs only
on Windows. And yes, they do have time-limited demos on their site.

No, you've %-encoded < in a URI, which isn't needed.  It *is*
however needed to be HTML encoded.

Let's take this example.

To create a link that passes "fred=flint stone" and "barney=rub ble"
to a CGI form response, the URI must be:

        /cgi/response?fred=flint%20stone&barney=rub%20ble

However, you can't have that "&" in HTML... it must be encoded as "&amp;",
so we show that as:

   <a href="/cgi/response?fred=flint%20stone&amp;barney=rub%20ble"> ... </a>

Thus, to go from a filename to HTML, you have to first URI encode the
dangerous stuff, then HTML-encode any remaining HTML-specific chars.

YOU CANNOT SHORTCUT ONE OR THE OTHER.

If you "get away" with something other than what I just listed, you
are simply relying on error-correction non-standard behavior that is
trying to DWIM, rather than Doing The Right Thing.

Please trust me on this.... I've been doing the web for a decade now,
and spoken to many experts.

All of the above.  Or is that none of the above?  By running a serial 
console, there is no need for a keyboard, monitor, mouse, or video card.
Most management of the system is done via ssh.  For things that can't be
handled over the network, there is a serial connection which allows
access via getty/login.  The other end of the serial connection could
be a simple as a plain old ascii terminal connected to a mechanical
switch that allows selecting among multiple systems.  A fancier setup
might use some sort of serial port concentrator.

It should be noted that the BIOS of typical PC motherboards is lacking
in this department.  Usually server/high end motherboards are the only
ones that support BIOS interaction via a serial port.  If anyone knows
of inexpensive exceptions to this rule, I'd like to hear about them.

Well, there is a Windows laptop in the machine room where I'm doing this
work, so it's POSSIBLE to use Reflection.  I just don't think it's a
software problem (at least not on the terminal end)... but I know little
enough about this sort of thing to be totally wrong about that, too.

By the way, how do I get minicom to not "initialize" my device?  Do I just
null out the "modem init string" configuration (and the hangup, I assume)?

Definitely your mistake.  This is the primary mailing list for the
Portland Linux/Unix Group.  We try to keep close to discussions of
technology and technical culture, but there is a slow gradient from tech
culture to economics (just as there's a slow grade from technology to
politics that becomes very grey indeed around Free Software).

We do have a plug-talk list for discussion the participants deem too far
away from technology and tech culture, though sometimes the slide is too
fast to move the whole discussion before it's over.

Isn't that around $50k a year? I don't know what you get paid, but I don't
consier that chump change. I make more, but when did we become so greedy
that someone willing to take that kind of pay would be considered a risk

If all you want to do is concatenate or stripe your drives, the MD system 
in Linux is just fine.  LVM is designed to do more than that.

I've used it to do things like near-instantaneous snapshots of live MySQL 
databases.  That's where LVM really starts to shine.  You can also extend 
live filesystems (some filesystems at any rate).  I haven't tried that 
yet.  Lack of trust.  Seems like an accident waiting to happen.

LVM2 is in the 2.5 kernel (well device mapper is) and should provide a lot 
of fixes for things that LVM1 didn't do so well.    That plus the EVMS 
tools in userspace will make a lot of sysadmins happy.

The 200GB drives are supposed to be out this month I think.  Ten of those 
and you're at about the limit of disk space that Linux can address (2TB 
limit).

Best,
Kyle

That's funny. It's okay to ridicule people who might work for $25/hour,
but it's NOT okay to explain (quite well I might add) the underyling
conditions that produce this kind of economic situation? Typical of what
I've seen on this list. It's okay to criticize people who are young or
self-taught, but it's not okay to question the system at large (which is
really where the problem lies).

This review mentions the tyan mpx board has a bios setting to redirect video output to the serial port.

I hear it's about $200, more expensive than your basic board, but it sounds great for a 'nix box. Anybody have one? Opinions?

I think ... or at least hope ... the comment wasn't directed at just
you, but rather at the whole conversation.

I hope I never reach the point where I wouldn't work for $25 an hour
after being unemployed for a great deal of time (adjusted for
inflation)......

No, since I don't think I'll buy Mathematica.  I think that Maple 8 is

What calc courses are you taking?  Just your basic 1-4 won't require
much Maple - most of what they did was done in-class at their math
computer labs.  Definitely not worth buying the software... if you buy
anything, get yourself a nice TI-92 calculator.  :-)

I suppose Maple might be useful if you got in to some of the
higher-level stuff, though.  But I don't know where you're at.

Hey, I'm moving up in the world: "Mr. Heinlein" :-)

The short answer is, yes, the serial connection becomes the console, 
the moral equivalent of keyboard and monitor. The LDP's Serial 
HOWTO[1] is a good place to start for information.

The advantages of a serial console over a KVM are many:

* it works over a slow connection like a modem
* the cabling can be longer and is available at any electronics supply 
  house
* the equipment is cheaper, esp. comparing a dedicated console server 
  to one of those tricky KVM-over-IP thingees
* you can keep full logs of all your console sessions
* anything that can emulate a vt100 terminal can act as the console 
  host, including Palm Pilots[2]
* your admins have to master at least the basics of vi

There are some disadvantages:

* getting an x86 BIOS to redirect itself to a serial port can be 
  tricky and/or require an add-on card (though getting Linux to send
  /dev/console to /dev/ttySx is pretty simple)
* no access to GUI apps, though console curses work ok
* your admins have to master at least the basics of vi

Here's what I use for a serial console.  I have an entry in
/etc/inittab:

  6:2345:respawn:/usr/bin/openvt -c 6 -w -- /usr/bin/minicom -o -c on serial-console

and then in /etc/minicom, I have a file called minirc.serial-console
that contains:

   # Machine-generated file - use "minicom -s" to change parameters.
   pr port             /dev/ttyS0
   pu baudrate         9600
   pu bits             8
   pu parity           N
   pu stopbits         1
   pu rtscts           No 
   pu minit            
   pu mreset

   pu mnocon1          
   pu mnocon2          
   pu mnocon3          
   pu mnocon4          
   pu mhangup          
   pu mdialcan         

I created the serial-console "profile" (or whatever).  Probably by
starting minicom, changing parameters and then saving the config.  

The inittab entry gives me a "virtual console" on Alt-F6 for the
machine I am monitoring by way of the serial console.  This was
screwing me up for a while, because when I wanted to reboot the other
machine, I was pressing Ctl-Alt-Del on the serial console and
rebooting my desktop box instead!  Oops!

I missed you, Jeme.  After I left the geeklist, it's been boring boring
boring.

God forbid I should keep my mouth shut for too long.

Unfortunately with the current glut of technical talent in the area, wages
ARE being pushed low.  Too low.  It took me 9 months to find work after
being laid off, and that was with a 47% pay cut.  There was a lot more work
in Seattle or San Diego or DC or Richardson, but I like this area.  I just
talked to a local DSL reseller (that shall remain nameless) who offered me a
contract position for $10 - $12 / hr.  The guy said upper management decided
someone would take the job.  And they're probably right.  They probably can
get someone with expertise at layers 1, 2, and 3 to come off unemployment
(or no benefits at all) and take the job.  Someone who may have been making
3x that amount a year ago.

But that doesn't make it right.  Not by a long shot.  People deserve a fair
wage whether the market bears it or not.

I'd kill someone for $25 / hour.  With benefits?  I'd throw their wife in,
too.

The first time I tried VMware, I somehow got it in full screen mode, and

Perhaps I should just get by with TeXmacs, Maxima, Gnuplot, and the
emacs calculator for the time being.  I saw a study guide on the shelf
at the bookstore that says "... with Waterloo Maple" on the cover
though, so I assumed that perhaps I'd like to have a copy eventually.

system took a lot longer. Comparing the two, even for simple striping, LVM wins
hands down. I've resized LVM volumes with reiserfs file systems, two commands
and it's done. very, very slick.

$25/hr+benefits as a salary for an employee (which would be $50k/yr
plus benes) is different from $25/hr as a consultant (which is $25k/yr
minus benes).  I understood this to be a consulting gig, in which case
it's a mighty poor paying consulting gig.

Did all that. It still asks for a password.

After being frustrated with pacifier using OpenBSD, and the multitude
of things that are different there, I looked at the ISP I'm dialing
in to.

That ISP uses linux 2.4.18, with all the expected files in place.

So, some one else suggested that I use rsync (not available on the BSD
system).

And I created a new user (ipsync) on my local system that will do
nothing except this update function, so that I don't have to muck with
my keys that I use for other systems.

ran ssh-keygen as the new user. created a cron entry to run the ip
update script. The script works, except for the last bit:


RSYNC_PASSWORD=itsAsecret
export RSYNC_PASSWORD
rsync -e ssh -logptrvz renegaid.html asavage at ncplus.net:www/


This _always_ asks for a password if run by hand, and always reports:

Permission denied, please try again.
Permission denied, (publickey,password).
unexpected EOF in read_timeout

when running in the cron. Once I get this working, I'll post the full
script.

TIA!

   Some More Writing Advice

   In C, putting extra parentheses in an expression can make it clearer.
   This tactic does not work in English. Human readers are not compilers.
   Either use commas instead of parentheses or put longer explanations in
   a different sentence.

   Microsoft Windows NT 4.x, Windows 98 and Windows 98 SE enter the
   "Non-Supported Phase":
   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/lifecycleconsumer.mspx on June 30,
   2003. No future security fixes will be available for those products
   after that date. Vendors, is it time to offer a promotion to get users
   of these common products to switch to a system for which you do offer
   security updates?

It makes the conditions different, but all the same when I graduated from
college my first job was $10/hour. Why $10? Because at the time it was the
most money I'd ever made and given the extreme poverty from which I came I
was happy to have it. That didn't make me a bad person. It made me poor
and willing to take whatever I could get.

Check the permissions of your keys file.
If it's accessible by group or world, then ssh will refuse to use it.

Yes.  Also, the -v option can be useful for figuring out what is going

Anyone know if there's somewhere on or around 82nd from, say, Foster
down to Clackamas Town Center where I could pick up a null-modem cable
that's 15 to 20 feet long? I'm going to be in that part of town around
lunchtime today, so I just thought I'd ask.

Thanks.

I'm in calc 1 (251) at PSU this term and have been using Gnuplot for some of the
homework assignments. I also have the TI-89, which has the same software as the
TI-92, but can be had for $40-$60 than the TI-92. Some of the students have
Maple, but I think the student edition is still $120. Gnuplot and the TI-89 do
it for me, but that may change in some of the higher level stuff.

Don't depend on the auto sense to determine baud rate, try setting it
manually, some of those things NEED to have only one baud rate set, all
other baud rates can confuse both ends of the connection.

Greetings, 

I had been following the PHP programmer thread.  Yesterday, the discussion 
turned to economics and then to whether it was Linux related or not.  It most 
certainly is, one of the hot topics lately in all the IT rags has been the 
debate over the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of the Linux operating system. 
This group seems very diverse, and I'm sure a TCO discussion could benefit.

Lets face it, buying a $6.99 set of RedHat CDs at cheapbytes.com is far less 
expensive than the proprietary alternatives.  But, this not only includes the 
Operating System, but a full set of software, everything from databases to 
Web servers, to email clients, graphics programs, etc.  Alternatively, if you 
already have access broadband, you can just download the distro of your 
choice, or get a copy from a friend.

Then there are the issues of system maintenance, uptime, etc.  I'm sure there 
are varying experiences here, but we've all heard stories of long uptime on 
Linux servers, (personally, I had a Web/database server up over two years 
without a reboot, only to come down in a power outage).  Pepper this with 
security, quality, and the benefits of open source code, I firmly believe 
Linux comes out far ahead than the alternatives at a TCO of far less. And, as 
far as tech support goes, you can beat the wealth of information on the Web, 
Usenet or the local LUG.

Lets not forget that Linux runs on a variety of hardware old and new.  I have 
a 3 year old laptop running Linux that is still rock solid, no complaints.  I 
have seen some folks around give machine specs along with their question and 
have noticed the 200MHz processors still in use.  "Dude, you're getting a 
Dell", why?  My desktop is a bit old, but works fine.

This past summer, I decided to try Windows XP and explore .NET.  I had not 
used Windows since Win95, and felt that in order to glean a fair opinion I 
needed to try Microsoft's latest offering.  In short, as I said above, I 
firmly believe Linux comes out ahead.  And its much cheaper.  Last week I was 
thrilled after I installed XDarwin on my Mac OSX machine, and then through 
the Fink project, install the Gimp, and the newsreader Pan.  Photoshop is 
expensive, and I like the Gimp, am used to it, and it does exactly what I 
want it to do. (For those of you who have seen Mac Gimp out there for $30, 
you can get the Gimp through fink.sourceforge.net for exactly $30 LESS.) 

Have a good day

There ain't much out here.  Really Good Stuff got rid of most of their 
cables and odd adapters and the new computer shop next door has next to 
nothing.  There's a new place on 52nd and Harrison (a few blocks south of 
Foster) that I haven't been to yet.  There is a Circuit City towards 
Clakamas--probably best bet.

There's a place that moved in next door to Stuff called PC Club or something
similar, and they had a variety of cable when I was there. You might want to
give them a call first? (503) 788-8738 (and their website is Pcclub.com if
you want to check them out ahead of time.

Good luck!

Thanks to Kelly and Dan for the PC CLub suggestion. Sadly, it only 
stocks a standard 6' null modem -- not that I expected anything 
different.

So you're just taking the basic Calc series?

Just looking at Maxima, it looks like it does very many things similar
to Maple.

I haevn't gotten in to TeX yet, nor gnuplot... does gnuplot let you
graph more complex things?  More than just F(x)=... type stuff, that is.

I hope between Maxima and emacs calculator you're able to pretty well
emulate a Ti-86-92 calculator, many of the professors will expect you to
have one and will teach you how to use it.

I'm guessing you'll have a laptop with you in class... not a bad idea. 
Unless you're very fast with TeX, I would be sure and have a pad and
paper ready for taking notes.

Also, be very wary of using the calculator (or software) to figure out
the problems for you, at least in Calc 1... it will mess you up down the
line if you can't do quick integrations in your head and really
understand the principles behind it.  If you do differential equations,
you will be very glad you learned all the stuff in Calc 1-3.  DiffEq is
*hard*.

Are you a full time student at PSU?  You may decide to take classes at
PCC as most math professors suck at PSU.  I had five professors from
calc 1 to diffeq (dropped diffeq the first time I attempted it because I
couldn't understand a word the professor was saying) and had only one
really good professor - Dan Streeter.  Joyce O'Halloran is probably one
you really really want to avoid.  I don't remember any of their other
names.

  Seems to me that preview images used to remain available from one time of
access to the next. Now they're not. It's not practical to re-create them
(with more than 100 images so far on this project) each time. The guash
plugin, I believe, needs to have the previews generated before it will
display them all.

  Have I missed something here or is there a way to get thumbnail/preview
images that are 'sticky'?

So I guess the SSH experiment went well?

What kind of NNTP server do you want?  Google for leafnode (that's what
I use) or INN.  They're two different classes of NNTP servers... so pick
which one you want and read its documentation.  Leafnode is very very
easy.

It sounds to me like you could use a general primer on Linux in general.

The Linux Documentation Project (http://www.tldp.org) has a slew of 
information.  Just type what you want to know about in the search box, 
and it will come up with a HOWTO or two on that subject.

I hate giving generalized RTFM advice, but when you ask such generalized 
questions, that's all we can do besides sending back a barrage of 'which 
what why how when' querys.  Unless we get something more along the lines 
of 'I installed X to do Y on hardware Z as per the instructions in the 
README|HOWTO but it failed with AA error, and now I'm stuck', it's hard, 
VERY hard to help.

Help US help YOU.

Can't you just buy 4 of the 6' and splice them? You could also find a long
serial and convert it to null modem maybe.

Heh, that's an interesting observation.  The best math prof's I ever had were 
at Clark College in Vancouver.  When I transfered to UW I took one math
class and it was so bad, I never took another. 

Now I watch my math skills wither away every day.

best thing would be to get a long serial cable (should be readily available)

Depending on where you are coming from Graybar might be in your path.

I think two RJ45 to DB 9 or 25 connectors and however many feet of cat5 you
need, is going to be your best bet for getting a long null modem in town. 
Don't forget to get a pin extractor if you don't have one. They are about $4-6
which is way over priced for the cheaply made tool, but it will pay for itself
if you confuse the pins.

I am SO worried about this.  I haven't been to college in seven years and
I'm returning in the next few months.  I have to take this advanced
calculus sequence.  I took differential equations (my last calculus class)  
when I was 20!  It's my understanding that (luckily) the course is all
theory and I don't need to recall all those integration rules and stuff.

When buying null modem cables, be certain of what you are getting.  I've
seen some pretty odd wiring, and even, IMHO, the wrong gender of connector.

RANT: If it's supposed to look like a modem on both ends, it ought to have
female connectors on both ends.

We all tend to get annoyed about someone going off topic,
especially when it's a wildly off-topic rant about something
we don't care about. However, in this case, Jeme's assessment
of the new economy is exactly correct, thought I'm not sure
giving public money away for the benefit of a few is a new
phenomenon.

We should all care about what Jeme writes about because we're
all being raped by a corrupt system that does not serve the
public good as it should. Many of us on this list are affected
by this in profound ways. Jeme is trying to point out why
we're in this sad state. Yes, this isn't the correct forum
for this kind of talk, but what is? Certainly not the media,
which is part of the problem. Where does one go to be
heard?

I sometimes wonder what drives a lone gunman to a clock tower.
Maybe it's because he had an important message and nobody would
listen.

I don't know if it's possible for you or not, but the best experience I had 
for this situation is to back up a class or two, say calc3, diffy-q and take 
that again.  Then by the time you start the new stuff a lot of older material 
is refreshed.

  For scientific plotting there's Gri. Dan wrote it because he wasn't aware
of gnuplot and his plotting language is (IMO, of course) _much_ better than
gnuplot. See: <http://gri.sourceforge.net/gridoc/html/>.

  My son started Ball State U. (Fruit Jar Tech) as a statistics major. All
the math faculty were from China and India and weren't required to be fluent
in English. He dropped that major after one year. He ended up with a degree
in CS/Math and got jobs in the insurance industry writing code in COBOL.

Subject: [PLUG] Xplanet - Gnome
Message-ID: <20021121193234.0C9A793AEE@einstein.seansdomain.org>

I'm running debian-unstable with gnome2.

For a while I was running kde2 and really enjoyed the xplanet as a 
background.  Now that I have gnome2 working again, I borrowed some code, did 
a little reading and hacked this little shell script together.  I run it out 
of cron every five minutes and it works great.

But, I am trying to figure out if there is someway to detect that 

a) I am logged in 
b) I am running gnome2

or alternatively run this with some kewl gnome2 app, so that it will
only run when I am logged in and running gnome2.  I want the cron job to
start and if I'm not logged in stop right there.  If I am logged in and 
running gnome2 it should continue.

BTW, if anyone's interested I also rewrote this script to run under gnome 
using

xsetbg, instead of gnome2

If you can find a long serial cable, yeah, that works.  I have a null
modem adapter so I can use my palm with a regular modem... it was like
$8 at Radio Shack (yep, a total ripoff!).

  The only accessible URL (other than /.) was to the Register.

  Fascinating article! What really caught my attention was the costs of
setting up 3,500 servers: $6,000,000 using MS Server, $15,000,000 using MS
Advanced Server and $0 using FreeBSD or linux. And, Redmond can say -- with
a straight face, no less -- that the Windows TCO is less than that of the
unices? Wow! What's worse is that too many people apparently believe them.

  The above are only the OS licensing costs -- no hardware, time to
install/configure/whatever. To poor folks like me, that's real money.

  Thanks, Carla. I don't know if this gives me hope or depresses me, but
it's certainly good to know.

I find this assertion disturbing, more or less akin to "it is
ok to post long-winded political diatribes on this list as long as your
political views match mine."

Toeing the anti-corporate line is not a prerequisite to being
interested in Linux.

have we ever considered the source of those ideas, may be it is FREE
windows. (I doubt if Billy Boy will ever allow such a thing to happen :) but

It doesn't really matter to me.  I've never bought a version of Windows 
I've used.  It's not so much the cost though, it's the frustration.  I'd 
MUCH rather have an OS that I can change the network settings on WITHOUT 
having to reboot, or install an application, or restart the windowing 
system without bringing down the box, or run cron jobs, or make my 
desktop a professional-level web/mail/ftp server with a single command, 
or, or, or, or, or...

I don't think Windows being 'FREE' (as in beer) will matter much to 
those who know that Linux is the superior product, free or no.

Depends what you mean by "survive". Some of us use Linux (pay for it even)
not because it's cheap or free, but rather because we like contributing to
software that anyone can take advantage of. I think that's where a lot of
the popularity comes from. Even more, many of us also use Linux in large
part because it's unix-like. Windows isn't. Therefore I can't imagine a
free Windows really doing damage to Linux. It might get companies and
govt. agencies to think twice, but Linux will survive.

Do you know about the "man" command?  I assume that by now you do... 
The "sshd" has a man page, and if you read that and tinker a little,
you'll know about as much about it as the rest of us.

Which kind of free?  If Windows just becomes a no-charge
download, then I believe that Linux, being open source, will
survive just fine.  If Windows source becomes free (as in open
source) then there would be quite a bit of upheaval as people
scrambled to fix the bugs in that code base, to rewrite ugly
sections (look what happened when Netscape became open source),
and to point fingers of blame at back doors and stupid bugs.
After the bits settled, I think Linux would just have another
open source competitor, but one with a bit more of a foothold
than FreeBSD, for instance.  In the end that wouldn't be bad,
since the competition would be good for consumers of that
software.  Oh yeah, and I mean "competition" as defined by Adam
Smith, not Bill Gates.

Cheers....

I like minorfish (formerly minordomo).  I tried mailman but it seemed to 
require a webserver running in the system it was installed on.  Minorfish 
goes in pretty easily and the config files have pretty good comments.
   About scalability I don't know.  I running pretty low volume, low user 
count lists.

If you are going to manually add and remove the users from the list,
then all you need to do is define the list in your mailers aliases file.

Use Linux, and reap the pleasures of getting yelled at and insulted. Hey, 
there's a recruiting pitch. K. Prasad, I hope you found the useful responses 
in this thread.

Did it ever occur to you that not all people posting here have a good command 
of English? Especially the ones, say, who live in India? Phrasing a complex 
question may be not be easy.

Would a little graciousness be so bloody difficult? Y'all snarky twits had the 
option to ignore the question, or use that same energy you spent being 
buttheads on being helpful. You preach 'Linux is the best! Join us!', then 
jump all over people who don't write posts that meet your exacting standards. 
That'll win people over, why, just think- if you insult ten newbies per day, 
who in turn each insult ten newbies, and so on, Linux will achieve world 
domination in no time.

Would this mean that companies like Dell could start selling Desktops without 
an OS?

Most Linux users I know use Linux because it is Linux, not because it is less 
expensive than Windows.  And, there is a whole set of open source tools 
available for Windows.  When I experimented with XP.  The CD burner software 
that came with XP will only record "track at once".  This is not an option 
for live shows, you need to record "disc at once". So I ended up using the 
win32 version of cdrecord.

Yea hows Microsoft supposed to support all of its other losing ventures 
and other free software givaways without Office and Windows covering 
those loses? As a paying customer of Linux distos I wouldn't be 
switching over to Windows even if it was free. I don't want to go back 
to the frustration of Windows if I can help it.

With that said though I still am forced to keep a Windows 98 box around 
for myself to handle Word documents I get from other people. Sure I use 
OpenOffice under Linux but I've found that I would have looked pretty 
foolish sending out a Word doc from OO without checking how it looks 
under MS Word.

Most of the time my OO documents look fine but every once in a while 
something is amiss and I have had to fix the document formatting in 
Word before sending the document off. I don't know it's something I'm 
doing with OO or if there are some minor incompatibilities with OO's 
handling of Word documents.

While that's a VERY important question, it's not really relevant in that
any sort of free Windows is still Windows and hence full of design flaws

The GNU/Linux system is not just open source, but Free.

Woah woah woah...  Open source is NOT the same as Free (as in
freedom).  Free software requires the guarantee of freedom.  Distributing
source code without ensuring the right to redistribute modified and
unmodified source code is hardly respecting liberty and freedom.

I don't think there's any competition whatsoever.  Those things that make
Windows appealing to some (outside of its corporate backing) are the same
things recognized as flaws by user's of GNU/Linux or the unices.

And, of course, when software is free (as in freedom) there is no need for
competition.  We have something better, then; we have cooperation.  Note
that we have competition when code becomes LESS free (think Xemacs vs. GNU
Emacs where Xemacs is less free because of the lack of proper copyright
transfer in the codebase... of course, Linux has the same problem).

Adam Smith is an economist and economics is the study of scarcity.  In
(free) software, there is no need for scarcity.  The competition would be
between developers (whose resources are scarce) and appeal to users is a
secondary concern.

I think he's trying to say that the discussion was an attempt to assess
the root causes of a problem and discuss those rather than the
superficialities of a particular labor market.

There was no "long-winded political diatribe" (and believe me, being
responsible for many in my day, I know one when I write one).  There was
an attempt to describe the economic system we've achieved to date and how
it relates to the current labor market.

Certainly not.  I don't know that anything I wrote was overtly
anti-corporate.  Now, if I'd gone off quoting Adam Smith and his argument
that "the firm" is a threat to the public good (and his perception of the
free market as an instrument of public benefit) and so on, that would
perhaps be more overtly anti-corporate.

If the logical activist conclusion to my assessment of the new economy is
to take an anti-corporate view, then so be it.  But the assessment itself
was not anti-corporate.  It was merely a description of the state of
affairs in our economy with a few notes as to why things are the way they
are.

I agree that there are very important issues out there, and we
sometimes feel strongly about it. However, I would think that writing
several paragraphs on one's political stance in a Linux/Unix/Technology
listserve is off topic.

I'm new to this listserve, and I certainly don't want to make waves,
but if every person decided to write a bunch of paragraphs on what we
felt strongly about then pretty soon we'd have to wade through Amway
sales pitches, global warming warnings, starving people in Africa or
that we're all destined for an eternity being tortured in Hell because
we haven't chosen the "right" religion. All of these subjects are of
utmost importance to someone out there, but I'd hope not to have to
wade through them in this listserve.

Anyway, I hope nobody was offended by my original sentence of this
being a Linux listserve, as in the couple of weeks I've been on the
list I have had one Linux bug fixed, lots of suggestions on another,
and was able to contribute to help someone else with a hardware issue.

I like that the list is fairly loose about what is on-topic, having 'topic 
cops', like some lists, is worse than wandering a bit.  But the same old 
rants from the same old ranters don't interest me, nor do other people's 
half-baked poli-sci and conspiracy theories. Even if they're right, I don't 
care- that's not why I come here. Plug-talk is available for any subject. I 
suspect posts more appropriate for Plug-talk end up here, for lack of an 
audience.  

You're right that everyone has beliefs that are of the utmost importance to 
them. Where some of them blow it is insisting on spouting diatribes, without 
considering the context or the audience. It's a big turnoff to be lectured 
and talked at, and treated like you know nothing, like you have never given 
thought to the issues. I think most of PLUGers have given a thought or two to 
the larger issues, and really don't need to be yelled at and talked down to.

It seems to self-correct pretty well. Stick around and enjoy the fun.

If explaining the current economic conditions that make our technology
skills "worth" what they are is OT, then certainly complaining about
people working for said money is also OT, is it not? I personally welcome
the semi-OT posts, especially as a counter to the "Back in my day you had
to have 100 years of experience in Unix and 70 years of Java experience to
be considered a real techie" posts.

I'm certainly not offended. I'm just not sure that it's THAT OT, when the
discussion was regarding the state of the economy for tech workers.

When Freedom and the Constitution in this country are being shredded at
record pace by politicians and corporate thugs it's sometimes hard to stay
silent. Especially since silence=agreement with the status quo.

Russell,

Thanks for this website.  I've seen this site or a site similar to this
recently.  I can say that I'm getting probed for port 137 every 2 - 3
minutes all day for several months.  I'm not sure why this is happening
at such an increased rate recently.  I used to see this rarely, but not
any more.  I hope that some of the people at CRIME have an insight.  I'm
more than happy to share my log files.

Are the rest of you seeing this much activity?

TIA,

Jim

Agreed. I'd like to draw a distinction between talking about these things, and 
a person feeling like they possess The Truth, and Must Educate The Ignorant 
Masses, and turning every little thing into a diatribe. There's quite a gap 
between the two.

Something to consider- how does ranting on PLUG help anything? Except sharing 
misery with friends, perhaps. :)   Again, I'm not in favor of getting all 
restrictive over keeping on topic. Me, I think it's better to not waste my 
energy pissing and moaning on PLUG and Slashdot and such about the state of 
the world, and to put those energies to work where they have a chance to do 
some good. Just because I don't talk about my various activisms here, for 
example, doesn't mean I'm sitting on my fat happy ass doing nothing.

Port 137 (and 138, 139) are NetBIOS ports. I *think* that this may be due to
the Bugbear virus which propogates through NetBIOS over your network. It's
not you, it's other machines "out there".

I've got it too. My logs get filled with "port 139" attacks (which is a
NetBIOS vulnerability attack) and port 137 hits.

Of course not. I try to effect change in my personal life as well. I
know I don't do enough, and wish I could find a way to affect greater
change.

Where I'm coming from, however, is this. Given that our nation is under
such a colossal assault from corrupt politicians and corporations I tend
to believe that while something may not expressly *help*, it never hurts
to disagree with the status quo. To weigh in. Because the more you weigh
in, the  more you dissent, the more you say, at the very least, "I don't
agree, this is why I don't agree." If enough people did that. If enough
people made their opinions known, then perhaps some would think a little
more about the little choices they make, the things they do, the things
they don't do. Perhaps it would make a difference. Perhaps not.

All I know, is that in times like these I don't want to passively allow
lies and half truths to go unchallenged. If a discussion arises and I have
the time to weigh-in, I will. And I won't begrudge someone else for doing
likewise. What this nation needs is more discussion, more dialogue, not
less. Even if it's a little OT. You can disagree, of course, but that's my
opinion.

I had a similiar situation with my Apache access logs. I used this sight
to perform a reverse IP address lookup: 

  http://eamnesia.com/index.jsp

>From this information I gathered that many of the attacks were coming
from attbi.com's domain.

The nature of the attacks tells me that a worm had infected innocent
computers and was hitting my port 80.

I simply mailed a copy of the relavent portions of the log to
abuse at attbi.com. To their credit, they dispacted several automated
emails and the activity seems to have reduced.

This isn't the technical answer but if it gets the job done effectively
then who cares?

Hope This Helps,


Cooper

I am pulling my hair out over this.  Actually this has been a fun learning 
experience.   I first tried the  520+ series but I found out there was no 
opensource drivers yet and does not support the new chipset.  Thanks for the 
help of Mark and Russell I have been able to make headway. . So I replace the 
card and installed D-Link DWL -520 wireless PCI Adapter.  I do see the card 
uses the Prism chipset.  I think that is good? The computer detected the card 
wonderfully and even labels it as a d-link wireless card.  But....I am having 
trouble from there.

First I went modified /etc/sysconfig/eth0 and changed wireless='no' to 
wireless='yes'  I then changed the wireless settings 
    operating mode = ' manage'
    networkname (ESSID) = 'default' (this is what the router is set to by 
    default for at the present.)

Next I did a rcnetwork reboot.  I get the following error:  
    ifup-wireless: command 'iwconfig eth0 mode managed' returned
     ifupwireless: Error for wireless request "Set Mode" (8B06): Set failed
     device eth0 operation not supported.

I get several of these types of errors and, of course, the card does not talk 
to the router.  I looked through the knowledge base and the archived mail 
list and did not see anything that leads me to a solution.  I am sure I am 
overlooking something.     

I am really feeling stupid about this and hate to ask, but can anyone please 
lend a guiding hand.  Is it possible I might have to compile a new kernel that 
supports what I am trying to do.   I am just about ready to throw in the 
towel  ;-)

Thanks very much.

I get hit on 137 through 139 regularly - Windoze boxen on my subnet
constantly broadcast to and from them looking for other Windoze boxen
they think are on their local network.

If I don't filter them out of my logs, I record about three hits per
minute on each of those ports.

I just glanced at the page with those drivers on it... but if they're
anything like the nVidia drivers, it was a combo kernel module and XFree
module.

Be aware, the kernel module likely won't work if it was built for a
kernel other than the one you're using.

Michael, 

Thanks for the information. I just went back through my logs and found
that the first time my logs were emailed to me for review and contained
the start of the port 137 probes was Oct. 2, 2002, which is 2 days post
w32.bugbear.  BTW, bugbear is not a virus, but a worm.

I could kick myself for not putting these two facts together, but I was
ass deep in a swamp full of alligators at the time.

Thanks again,

Jim

Are you sure your wifi card is eth0?  May be wlan0 or something.

This is a stupid question but how do I find out for sure.   So the answer is 
no I am not sure.

I just looked and it does look like it is eth0. I did a ifconfig and i only 
had eth0 and lo listed.   I am assuming this is what you were asking.

Your fine. The cards show up as eth0. and are configured like wire based cards.
iwconfig will tell you the wireless parameters, ifconfig will give you the IP
configuration of the wireless card. I don't know if you can get away with  not
removing your first eth0. Removing it and then reconfiguring the new card as
eth0 is your best bet. After that or if you think you're fine, use the command
lsmod as root. If you're not seeing the wireless modules, then you can add them
by hand or reboot. Even though I did what you've done in yast, I had to first
add the modules by hand. I realized on my second install that I could just
reboot. I rebooted to make sure the modules would come up at boot. I had the
card first in my desktop to play with and then moved it to my headless pc
router. 

So to recap the above ramble, reboot and see if it just works. If not, remove
your old eth0 if you didn't and do what you did before to configure the card.
Reboot again and see if it works. This is all I had to do. 

You can probably use ad-hoc to talk to an AP if managed still gives you grief. 
Most APs will do both. The only issue I have with my setup was I could not set
the encryption. I don't have the same card as you do so this might not be an
issue with your setup, but it might be an issue if you AP is set up to not
except non encrypted packets.

Thank you
Russell

Subject: [PLUG] RH 8.0 Kernel Compiling
Message-ID: <3DDDA6FB.B346529B@attbi.com>

In the last several days, I have installed RH 8.0 on three machines from
RH supplied installation CD's (the 3 CD set, not the 2 CD evaluation
set). The first machine is a 200 Mhz MMX Pentium, the second, a 550 Mhz
AMD K6, and the third an IBM Thinkpad 390X with a 400 Mhz Celeron. The
first two machines have 64 Mb of RAM, each, and the laptop has 96 Mb.

The installation went smoothly on all three machines. I am now
interested in addressing performance problems on the first two machines.
The laptop doesn't seem to have any performance problems that show up to
my eye. On the 200 Mhz Pentium, things seem to work as expected with the
exception of mpg123, which I reported a couple of days ago. On the 550
Mhz AMD, the entire feel of the system is slow, feeling even slower than
the 200 Mhz Pentium.

I'm assuming that the solution is optimizing the kernel for each
machine. I understand from replies to an earlier post that I need to
read up on the low latency patch, and have done some of that.

Today's question is, where do I start reading about what options to
specify (or however it's done) to get a kernel that works well with the
AMD K6 chip as opposed to the Pentium chip. (BTW, I get good performance
from Win98 on the AMD machine and on the Laptop, although I feel as if
the 400 Mhz Celeron on the laptop runs faster than the 550 Mhz AMD.)

I have started reading
http://www.redhat.com/support/resources/howto/kernel-upgrade/ and find
that, "This guide was written specifically for the Intel platform." They
mention specific instructions for Alpha Systems and SPARC systems, but
don't say anything about AMD systems, at least not as far as I've
gotten.

I've also looked in the book Mastering Red Hat Linux 7.1 and found some
hints as to where to look to see what I have. I find in /usr/src and
directory linux-2.4.18-14, and within that a directory configs which has
files ending with athlon.config, i386.config, i586.config, i686.config,
and x86_64.config, among others, but nothing specifically referencing an
AMD K6. How do I know which configuration to use, or is there another
source of configurations for AMD chips?

I've also started reading the howto at:

http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-formats/html_single/Kernel-HOWTO.html

It talks about loading the source rpm from the redhat CD. I think I
already have the source -- I selected "everything" during the
installation. The question is where to find information specifically
related to AMD K6.

Do you know about the emacs calculator?  It's in XEmacs or it runs in
GNU Emacs... in Debian, for emacs you must install the calc package, but
for XEmacs, it's already included.  You can then type "M-x calc" and get
what is essentially a souped up HP-48 that can also do some algebra.  It
uses Gnuplot to draw plots.

There is also a great Gnuplot mode for the emacsen, that is installed
when you install gnuplot, under Debian.  It gives you a special mode for
editting gnuplot scripts, where you can send commands from the edit
buffer to a live gnuplot process.  This works very well on a laptop
right there in class.  You get way better plots that you get with a
simple hand calculator.  The only missing feature is the trace; where
you move a cursor along the curve to find the function's value at some
point.  You don't really need that though, since it's not hard to simply
compute the value by hand.

I also like to use Guile, MIT Scheme, or CMUCL running under XEmacs
while in math class.  I use it to compute function values, and also have
written some simple algebra routines (learned from "Scheme and the Art
of Programming", MIT Press) and stuff like the distance formula.

Another cool tool for Calculus is "Maxima" running as a session object
under "TeXmacs".  TeXmacs is pretty awesome for taking notes in a math
class, since once you learn how, you can type math at full speed.  It
uses real TeX fonts onscreen, WYSIWYG.  TeX is what is used to typeset
mathematics textbooks in real life.  "Maxima" is the original computer
algebra system, developed years ago for the US Deptartment of Energy. 
It's written in Common Lisp (CLTL Lisp, if you know what that means it
matters) and is now released under the GPL.  It is maintained at the
University of Texas by a professor and his crew.  The Debian Maxima
package runs under GNU Common Lisp (GCL), also maintained at utexas.

Both the emacs calculator and maxima, for a lisp programmer, are very
interesting programs...  I have not figured them out yet, but plan to do
so.  Anyone on PLUG know much about them?  Any hints?  Perhaps if this
gets going, we should move it's thread to "plug-devel".

I have not tried GRI yet, but plan to.  It looks very good.  Another
tool I plan to learn to use is GNU "R", for statistics.  It is one of
THE tools for that sort of work.  There is also a mode in XEmacs for
both R and for GRI.  The one for R is called "ESS", or "Emacs Speaks
Statistics".

Running inferiour processes like that under XEmacs or TeXmacs is really
wonderful.  Once you learn how to do it, you'll wonder how you got along
without it.

If enough people are interested in learning to use these tools together,
let me know, and we can set up a meeting or something.

For playing MP3's, you might like to try "xmms", make it SUID root, and
check off the "use realtime priority" option.  See if that makes it work
a little better.  It is safe to make "xmms" setuid to root, since it
drops permissions very early, right after setting it's scheduling
priority to realtime round robin.  (A quick look at the source code will
verify that.)

The performance problems might have more to do with disk I/O latency
than anything else.  Install and read about the "hdparm" tool.  You can
use it to improve disk performance by quite a lot.  Turn on 32bit I/O,
and DMA, and set multi count to 16.  That alone will often give you
another several megabytes per second throughput.  If you've got UDMA 33
or 66 hard drive + controller, but the BIOS does not set the disks into
that mode automaticly, then you can also use "hdparm" to set the UDMA
mode.  It only works when the hardware can do it though.

There's a checkoff in the kernel configuration (make menuconfig) for
what type of CPU you have.  If you are running blazingly new Debian
unstable ("Sid"), you could try to use the "apt-build" tool to install
all your software, and have it autobuild each package with full per-CPU
optimizations.  I've not tried to do this yet myself, so don't know how
well it works.

Here I refer to the XMMS configuration menus, not to the kernel
compilation options.

In a new (and idle, not moving forward) section of the PLUG web server,
you'll find a search page:

http://new.pdxlinux.org/search.html

Searching there for "wireless" turns up some potentially useful stuff. 
The search engine there has indexed all of the "*-doc" packages I've
installed on drizzle.pdxlinux.org, including the LDP "HOWTO" documents
and this mailing list's archive.

I was never able to use the binary Nvidia driver on my box. After the posts 
last week, I realized that I wasn't the only one and it might not be the fact
that I bought a cheap card. I started looking for an answer and found one that
worked for me. In the BIOS set PnP OS to no , and set  Assign IRQ to VGA set to
yes. 

Thank you

Yes, just "apt-get install alien", then "man alien".  Another tool in
this category that every Debian admin should know about is "equivs".

It does not always work right, since Red Hat packages are most often not
Debian Policy compliant.  They go through a lot less trouble making
certain that things are installed in FHS compliant locations, I am
told.  The libraries are not always named the same either, and
interpackage dependancies can differ, since Debian tends to split things
up more, or the packages names are just different.

You might want to just open the RPM with "mc" (midnight commander) and
copy what you need out, then hand install it.  You should at least use
"mc" to poke around inside the generated .deb to see that the locations
it will install things are kosher and compatible.  Be aware that if you
hand install stuff, it can get blown away on upgrade (of the X11
packages, in this case), so to prevent that, you might like to place the
affected packages on "hold" status.

If you use "aptitude" (or ye olde "dselect") for your package management
tasks, you can put a package on "hold" using the "=" key.  That will
prevent "aptitude" from automaticly marking that package (and any
dependancies) for upgrade.  For example, I use this to hold onto my
custom build of "iptables", which I needed to match some special patches
(POM) applied to my kernel.  I've also used it, on "drizzle", to ensure
that the EVMS user space tools are not upgraded past the version built
into the kernel there.

I've used "equivs" to declare library dependancies for an older copy of
"Maple" installed on a computer at PSU.  Without the "equivs" generated
pseudopackage, "apt" would have uninstalled the libraries that older
version of "Maple" was built against, since it would have seen them as
no longer in use by anything.

Karl's response pointed the inquisitor to a rich source of useful
information related to the original post.  I don't see how that's yelling
or insulting.

Now MY comment was sarcastic and uncalled-for, but it wasn't an attempt to
ridicule this person for lack of knowledge.  It was an attempt to ridicule
the person for not asking a question at all and playing this
passive-aggressive game wherein one whines about what they want and still
expects people to meet those needs without being directly asked.  
Personally, I find such behavior not only rude, but indicative of serious
ego problems on the part of the whiner.

> Did it ever occur to you that not all people posting here have a good
> command of English?

Not that this was directed particularly at me, but I'd just like to say
that my response is related to the fact that there was no request, just an
expectation of service.

I understand that in some languages no change is made to a sentences
structure at all when a question is asked.  I have no idea if that's the
case with this person's native tongue, but throwing a question mark on the
end would have done it for me.

Now, see, here's the REAL reason I replied to this post.

I (to take this last bit personally, however incorrect that may be) might
preach "GNU is the best!  Use Free Software!" and I surely will jump all
over a person who doesn't write posts that meet my exacting standards.  
But I see those actions as complementary, not contradictory.  It's not
insulting to point out sloppiness in reason or laziness in activity and it
is exactly sloppy reasoning and laziness that prevent people from using
Free Software in the first place (exception: people with vastly different
priorities than I have; say, people who hate and wish harm to fall upon
others and themselves).

So having exacting standards and working uphold standards is the same
thing as encouraging Free Software, it's just the hard way.

Russell I got it working.  I deleted the eth0 and used Yast to to install the 
wireless card.  I went edited /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcg-eth0 and changed 
wireless='no'  to yes.  I rebooted and bang it is working.  I can not believe 
how hard is was making.  But I have learned a bunch in this venture.  Thanks 
everyone and especially Russell.

Now I just got to get encryption to work and I am golden. But I am going to 
wait until this weekend to tackle that one.

You have more excuses for rude, mean behavior than I can count. You're not 
upholding any standards except your own bIzarre self-justifications for being  
a butt.

And that's my last word on the subject, this has taken up enough list space.

For my information, when you mentioned you had to first add the modules by 
hand, where can I find the documentation to learn how to add modules in SuSe

"executives" who think that they can fire someone making $60K per 
year, and hire someone with the same, or MORE, experience for $40K is 
obscene and evil, at the very least.

	Like Ayn Rand's "John Galt" (in her book, "Atlas Shrugged"), 
I choose to remove my participation from this punitive charade that 
masquerades as the Computer Information Technology industry. These 
people (US companies) need US more than we need THEM.
	Speaking (again) for myself, I have other skills and 
experience beyond Computer IT, and I'm already using them! I know 
that others do not, so I don't fault them for participating in this 
horrendous mess by not "dropping out" as I have. The folks that feel 
that they have "no choice" but to endure dramatic pay cuts, job loss, 
or ever-increasing responsibilities, longer hours and job stress have 
my sympathy and pity. I've discovered that perfectly usable 
rack-mounted servers also make perfectly good DOOR STOPS, too.

	It's up to each one of use to use his/her "moral compass" to 
decide when "enough is enough." Enduring this abuse amounts to 
"enabling" (psychological definition) - just as much as if you were 
to buy an alcoholic a drink!
	I encourage everyone and anyone who has other skills or 
dreams to pursue them. Create your own bunker and hunker down. Let 
the IT war rage outside of your "bubble", and emerge safely - with 
your skills intact! - when the climate is much more in your favor.

No, but my comment was about the quality of person you could get at
that discounted rate.  It's not someone I should trust with money or
private information.

Too bad you just missed it.  The most recent Geek Cruise
(www.geekcruises.com) last week was a Cisco Certification Course.  At
sea.  The Caribbean Sea.

Don't miss Linux Lunacy 3, with Linus himself (and yours truly) coming
up at the end of September 2003, out of Vancouver BC for a week in the
Inside Passage.  The previous Linux Lunacy was a few weeks ago as
well.

I saw three lines that I changed in order for it to come up as a letter
size default. The first line did nothing so I just went ahead and
changed the other 2 (checking each change) and it took all 3 to effect
the change. Of course right now it seems that lpr has dumped all over
itself and I am unable to print at all. Still working that one out.

Hey, at some point we had to learn about the man command so that we did
not any longer need to ask others to post man pages to the list.

What I said was:

Do you know about the "man" command?  I assume that by now you do... 
The "sshd" has a man page, and if you read that and tinker a little,
you'll know about as much about it as the rest of us.

If you knew me a little better and could imagine the tone I'd have taken
when speaking that remark, you'd not be so quick to call it rude.  I'd
have a smile and a twinkle in my eye when I took the jab at you...

You called the most relevant part of my statement "useless", Karla. 
That was that "if you read it's man page and tinker a little you'll know
as much about it as the rest of us".  That is to say, it's really not
THAT mysterious; there is not much archana beyond the man page's
contents, so don't be afraid to just go from there.

I try to find answers first from documentation, then from a list search
(http://new.pdxlinux.org/search.html), then by a more global internet
search, then by asking.

Isn't there some middle ground between complete trust and someone you
wouldn't trust? I mean, I've known some mediocre IT people that probably
make $60,000+. Hell, I worked with someone at one job who spent nearly the
entire day day-trading. Didn't do any actual work and he made almost 100
grand. This emphasis on what money you demand or what money some other
sucker was willing to pay you defining your worth is nonesense. That's my
point.

I may not have been an expert while seeking $10/hour, but I'm fairly
certain you could have placed a level of trust in my quality, if perhaps
slower skills at that time.

You need gcc 3.2 for any AMD-related optimizations, IIRC. Not sure if that
applies to the older Althons at all.

I've been experimenting with apt-build and have to say it hasn't worked
very reliably, at least for the large programs where such a utility is
more convenient and useful than apt-get source. It doesn't appear to have
generated a lot of popularity yet, either, but I should keep trying it and
figure out more.

Michael,

Thanks for the information. I just went back through my logs and found
that the first time my logs were emailed to me for review and contained
the start of the port 137 probes was Oct. 2, 2002, which is 2 days post
w32.bugbear.  BTW, bugbear is not a virus, but a worm.

I could kick myself for not putting these two facts together, but I was
ass deep in a swamp full of alligators at the time.

Thanks again,

Jim

I'm not sure if this is the same thing or not, but Woz was in a plane crash
before they had gotten the original Mac built and all the stuff was in his
head, which had suffered some trauma and he couldn't remember anything for
like three days. Quite the story, actually.

And if you don't think cruises are risky, you haven't watched the news this
morning about the two ships who ended up with a buncha sick people over
contaminated water or something.

I hate it when people scream about rudeness and meanness when somebody
tries to explain how to find an answer to a question instead of just
spewing forth the answer to the question.

This is far too common in the computing world.  People have a question,
they ask it, and then they get an answer, hand-holding them through the
whole thing.  They then learn absolutely nothing that could help them in
their next project (like... say... an NNTP server?)... and when the next
obsticle appears, they're dependent upon free tech support to solve it.

If, instead of being told exactly what to do, they're told where to look
for the answer to their question... chances are they'll look there the
next time and won't have to ask for help.  Eventually they'll get to the
point where they can start helping other people with their questions.

But no, Carla, this is the rude way to do things, huh?

Give a man a fish and he is fed for a day.  Teach a man to fish and he
is never hungry again.

If you were saying Karl was being rude in the specific language used - I
didn't read it as being rude at all.  You should have learned by now
that Internet communications are prone to being mis-interpreted - we
don't have tone or body language to help set the mood.  That makes it
somewhat stupid to jump on somebody in things like this - where it could
be questionable what tone the poster was posting in.

Subject: [PLUG] ISO & CDR checksums
Message-ID: <20021122183735.8127F2FEB3@joseph.doink.com>

I'm having an odd trouble with ISO checksums.  I created my own ISO 
of some Mandrake 9.0 contrib rpms.  Then I run the md5sum on that ISO.
I also burn the ISO to CDR and subsequently compute the md5sum of the 
CDR like so 'dd if=/dev/scd1 | md5sum'.  This has always worked, 
except for when the CD drive mounts or unmounts during the dd.  I 
think I've prevented the (un)mounting problem, and yet I can't get 
the md5sum of one burned ISO to be identical on the burned CDR and 
the ISO spinning on the harddrive.  Doing just the same thing with 
other ISOs is working with the same equipment and method.  Oddly 
enough, I can read the burned suspect CDR just fine when I mount it 
*AND* the md5/gpg signatures on all the RPMs on the CDR are just fine.

Do you think it's safe to consider the burned ISO good?

Does anyone have a better technique for computing the md5sum of the 
CDR?

Thanks....

Teach a fish to man, and suddenly he's a Unix expert.

The sad thing is that when someone needs help for the most common 
configuration items for Linux/Unix like: email, FTP, SSH, DNS there are 
a number of websites with good information available online. I went 
though this with OpenBSD when I needed to figure out how to setup DNS 
and sendmail and a Google search with the proper keywords yielded 
quickly yielded pages with all of the information I needed.

Certainly it's fine to spell out the solution step-by-step but I would 
hope that most people trying to do system configuration for the various 
Unix services might want to learn something in the process and not be 
above RTFM replies that include relevant man pages and/or URLs.

Of course we've all seen idiotic responses from some people that give 
the stock "RTFM" response with no relevant resources sited which is 
just a waste of bits IMHO.

Some folks see it as "Light a fire for a man and he is warm for
the night, but set him on fire and he's warm for the rest of his
life." 

Flames are a part of the process with all online tribes. A little
heat now and then keeps you on your toes.

Lots of good stuff to learn. I think this machine may be old enough that
most of the higher performance stuff won't be there, but I'll look into
it.

I guess I'll just give that a try. I understand that compiling the
kernel doesn't change what's installed, so I won't really hurt anything
if I get it wrong the first (or second, or third) time. The important
thing is to make sure I don't overwrite the boot image (or whatever that
file is called), and add another option to GRUB. When I get back this
evening, I'll give it a try.

Hello Lunux folkz,
I have a Linux box with three NIC's in it (eth0, eth1 and eth2).
I need to divide my local network into two subnets e.g.
192.168.1.0 on eth1 and 192.168.2.0 on eth2
and perform their masquerading and firewalling on eth0.
Let say eth0 assigned to 63.215.105.0 network.
I assume that I can choose subnet mask ether 
255.255.255.0 or 255.255.0.0 for both these subnets.
Please correct me if I'm wrong!
Now I setup routing tables in this order:
route add -net 127.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 lo
route add -net 63.215.105.0 255.255.255.0 eth0
route add default gw 63.215.105.1
route add -net 192.168.1.0 255.255.0.0 eth1
route add -net 192.168.2.0 255.255.0.0 eth2

I hope, this will produce routing between two
subnets on eth1 and eth2 and routing between
gateway and eth0.
Please correct me if I'm wrong. 

How I can masquerade eth1 and eth2 on eth0 interface
simultaneously?

Thank you in advance for any thoughts or info.

Alex

I think you'll want a subnet of 255.255.255.0 for the two 192.168.x.x 
subnets. By only using 255.255.0.0 it matches only 192.168.x.x so the 
system won't know which interface to use so you need to match that 
third octet as well.

Hello all,

I find myself buying one or two unix related books each month. Unfortunately I've been burned a few times by books that were, inaccurate, full of fluff or just plain badly written. In the hope that my experience may help someone else, here are my opinions on my latest 2 purchases. I would hesitate to call this a review. How about a tip?


DNS & BIND Cookbook by Cricket Liu
O'Reilly & Associates

If you're an experienced DNS admin and you already have the current edition of DNS & BIND you probably don't need this book. I found very little in this book that wasn't covered at least in passing in DNS & BIND. Unlike the cricket book, the DNS & BIND Cookbook covers answers to specific problems rather than covering the entire topic in depth. I'd buy it with, not instead of, DNS & BIND. 

Pros: 	1 If you have a specific problem with DNS or you like lots of examples, this is the book for you.
	2 It's relatively cheap. I bought mine for $28 at Powell's.
	3 You won't strain you back toting it around (about 220 pages).
	4 It answered a couple of questions I had that were not covered well enough for me by the Cricket book.

Cons:	1 It's short. It may not have what you're looking for.
	2 It covers a lot of the same territory as DNS & BIND.



Absolute BSD, The Ultimate Guide to FreeBSD by Michael Lucas
No Starch Press

I found the title a to be a bit overstated. The foreward begins with a pompous, "Twenty five years. My god, has it really been that long?" The cover is just plain ugly. All of these flaws are relatively minor defects in a good book about FreeBSD. Absolute BSD is aimed at using FreeBSD as a server platform, not a desktop OS. I think there may be better guides for complete beginners, but for those familiar with 'nix and wanting to get a little further beyond the basics Absolute BSD is a good reference.

Pros:	1 Good coverage of doing "real work" with FreeBSD.
	2 Good coverage of kernel tuning and customizing.
	3 Each BSD and Linux ditribution has it's own configuration quirks. Chapter 9 covers FreeBSD's /etc in depth.
	4 The ugly brown cover will conceal any coffee stains.

Cons:	1 Misleading title? My ultimate guide to FreeBSD would be having the FreeBSD Core team on site, offering advice, and smacking me with a rubber chicken when I screw up. 
	2 How much relevance will it have when FreeBSD 5 is stable?



In short I consider both purchases to be money well spent, of course YMMV.

Here's the flip side of the coin. Does anyone have any recommendations on books on LDAP, preferably OpenLDAP?

On more than one occasion I have been so lost that I couldn't even formulate the proper question. I have always appreciated the courtesy shown by those who provide a link along with RTFM,  and the mercy of those who omit the RTFM and provide only a link. I sometimes think the only factor determining whether or not a person is a clueless idiot is what side of the bed they climbed out of that morning. Of course the non-idiot side of my bed is against the wall :)

Subject: [PLUG] Samba config question
Message-ID: <3DDE94D8.54C2122B@attbi.com>

I'm trying to get Samba working again. I remember that for my setup, I
needed very little in the smb.conf file. I've found a couple of places
that tell me what to do, starting with:

http://www.troubleshooters.com/linux/samba.htm

It's a nice step-by-step guide. It starts with simply making the linux
machine visible to the windows machines. That part works. The smb.conf
file looks like this:

[global]
   guest account = pcguest
   workgroup = House

With that for an smb.conf file, I can see the linux machine from windows
explorer.

The next step is to make /tmp visible and accessible. Instructions at
that web site and in a book say that all I need do is add the following
to my smb.conf file, (well, the web site had me create another
directory, /scratch, but with the same permissions as /tmp, and the
result was the same):

[tmp]
   comment = Temporary file space
   path = /tmp
   read only = no
   public = yes

When I restart Samba and try to look at anything on the linux machine
from windows explorer, I get a password prompt. The book and the web
site don't mention this happening at this stage. The message looks like
this:

---------------------------------------------------------------
Enter Network Password

	You must supply a password to make this connection:

	Resource: \\NEC\IPC$

	Password:
---------------------------------------------------------------

(The name of the linux machine is nec.)

I did try adding the following to the [global] section, but it made no
difference:

   security = share

I assume that there's some other step I'm omitting. Could someone point
me in the right direction, please.

Thanks.

OK,
If I set subnet mask to 255.255.255.0 for the both 192.168.x.x
subnets will these subnets be visible for each other?
If I need to masquerade them on eth0 how these eth1 and eth2

Have you checked out O'Reilly's Safari?  I find it a great way to have access 
to their books, especially if it is something that I am only going to need in 
the short term.  The basic subscription is $10 for five points.  Most books 
are one point, although some are 1/2 and some are more. You can swap out once 
a month.  They also are starting to include books by other publishers.

Thanks for the review.

Mark

You will be asked for a password, even for a guest account.  If you
don't enter a password (just hit return, or click ok), then you will be
connected as the guest user.  BTW, the guest user needs to have a system
account, and a SAMBA account, what you choose for a password doesn't
seem to matter.  You may also need to add the line:

guest ok = yes

under your [tmp] section.

Be careful that if you are building the same kernel version that you are
running that you don't overwrite the installed modules with the new ones
without making a backup first!  (This is one area where Debian's
"make-kpkg" from `kernel-package' really shines.  You can use the
`--append-to-version' or `--revision' switch to make the kernel's uname,
and thus module install directory, unique.)

This is THE paper about booting the Linux OS.  (The LaTeX source is next
to it at that site, IIRC.)

Teach them to fish and they'll drive the fud driven consulting market's
hourly rates down.  It will be hard to make ends meet on less than 100k
per year, you poor folks.  Don't forget to tip the beggar at the fancy

It's funny how people who are normally snide read that tone into other
people's writing, like how when somebody on a soap opera reads a letter
it sounds like the person who wrote it reading to them in their head. 
Is it the pot calling the kettle black, or it takes one to know one, or
is it just that since "I" do it, everyone else must also?

Yes, they'll be able to see each other.  Machines on each "span" will
have a default gateway of the router.  The router knows all (at least
locally).  If you've got the iproute2 tools:

  IP=/sbin/ip
  IPTABLES=/sbin/iptables

  DSL_IF=eth0
  DSL_IP=63.215.105.xxx  # insert your static IP here
  DSL_GATEWAY=63.215.105.1

  LAN_1_IF=eth1
  LAN_1_IP=192.168.1.1

  LAN_2_IF=eth2
  LAN_2_IP=192.168.2.1

  $IP link set up dev $LAN_1_IF
  $IP addr add ${LAN_1_IP}/24 broadcast + scope global dev $LAN_1_IF
        
  $IP link set up dev $LAN_2_IF
  $IP addr add ${LAN_2_IP}/24 broadcast + scope global dev $LAN_2_IF

  $IP link set up dev $DSL_IF
  $IP addr add ${DSL_IP}/24 broadcast + scope global dev $DSL_IF

The router has a default gateway (of whatever is your upstream):

  $IP route add default scope global via $DSL_GATEWAY

The masquerading is configured relative to the external
interface, e.g.:

   $IPTABLES -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o $DSL_IF -j MASQUERADE

Also, need to make sure forwarding is enabled, e.g.:

   echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

Your system should automatically route the traffic to the proper 
192.168.x.x subnet since a 255.255.255.0 mask matches the first three 
octets so it will know what interface goes with what private subnet.

You would need to masquerade the traffic from the 192.168.x.x subnets 
when it goes out the eth0 interface since that is the only network 
interface with a publicly routable IP address. 

Also, make sure you set the default gateway on the systems on the 
192.168.1.x and 192.168.2.x subnets to the respective IP address you've 
assigned to the eth1 and eth2 interfaces since your firewall system 
will be the default gateway for systems on your private subnets.

You should be able to masquerade all traffic from the private subnets by 
only matching the first two octets. Something like 168.192.0.0/16 will 
match traffic from both private subnets.

For our convenience, I've installed the Debian packages containing the
Internet RFC documents on the PLUG web server.

http://www.pdxlinux.org/doc/RFC/
http://www.pdxlinux.org/doc/RFC/rfc-index.txt.gz

You can use your browser's text search function (Ctrl-f in Galeon and
Mozilla) to search for stuff, then get the RFC number.

Try looking for "subnet", "cidr", "route", etc.  The actual RFC's can be
found via the attached script.  It uses "galeon -n" as written, or you
can edit it and make it use "gnome-moz-remote" or whatever you like. 
Install it in /usr/local/bin, and you'll always have it available.

I use Gnome, and have replaced the little foot menu on my lower panel
with the "mini_commander" applet.  It lets you set up match expressions
and commands to run when an expression you type there matches.  I have
it match the expression "^[rR][fF][cC] *([0-9]+)" and have that run
"moz-remote-rfc-by-number \1".  Now I can type or paste a string like
"rfc1219" into the mini commander, and Galeon visits that RFC in the
blink of an eye.

http://new.pdxlinux.org/search.html

... should locate RFC's also.  For instance, try typing "subnet" into
the search box there.

Unless you want them treated differently for filtering purposes, of
course.  If one side is faculty and the other is student workstations,
for instance, you may well have different rules for each.  (Do as I say
not as I do?)

You don't need any kind of a special utility to do that...

If you edit the Makefile and put something in for 'EXTRAVERSION' you'll
get a specially named kernel version and module location.

When I was playing with Win4Lin, for instance, everything was 2.4.18-w4l
so it didn't cause problems with the pre-exiting 2.4.18 kernel that was
in place.

I just realized that this script does not do a lot of good if you don't
have the RFC's installed on your own machine.  Well, for now, you'll
have to find them by hand.  They are all linked to in:

Message-ID: <3DDEBF0D.F20CC203@gisnet.com>

I used to know this, but I've forgotten and haven't found it in
my FM. 

When you add a new user as a private FTP only account, how do you
set the default file creation privileges? Can I do this in
/etc/ftpaccess, or does that not work for directories outside the
/var/ftp tree? 

I'm using RedHat 7.1 with a text-only interface.

Russell,
Thank you very much for your response.
Aren't iproute2 tools including routing utilities for 2.2.x kernels
only? 
That's what I red in iproute2 package description.
Since I'm using 2.4.19 kernel, what kernel routing utilities/features
should I use in  this case?

Many thanks in advance.

Sure, or you can use "make EXTRAVERSION=.1 ...".  See:

AFAICT, the same interface works for 2.4 kernels.

And I think Redhat defaults EXTRAVERSION to something different than 
what is in /lib/modules.  "custom" IIRC

That was the problem. I commented out "guest account = pcguest" and got
the condition I was looking for. nobody is what I used to have. That's
what I want this time, too. Since this is a network at home, behind a
router, and I want it to be available to any machine in the house,
whether it's me on linux, or my wife on windows, I don't want it to ask
for a password for /tmp or one other directory that I will create for
windows file storage.

Thank you both for your comments. Together, they explained what I needed
to know. This time, I'm keeping a paper log of the things I'm doing to
the machine, so I won't have to remember which files to back up if I
ever do a start from scratch OS load again.

That does look promising. Unfortunately, as affordable as electronic documents are, my eyes prefer dead tree format for long term viewing.

[root at localhost download]# rpm -Uvh kde*
error: Failed dependencies:
        kdebase = 3.0.3-13 is needed by (installed)
kdebase-devel-3.0.3-13
        kdelibs = 3.0.3 is needed by (installed) kdelibs-devel-3.0.3-8

Is this telling me that kdebase-devel and kdelibs-devel are installed? 
Because I can't find them on my system.  And I have kde installed and am
running it right now.

TIA,

Jim

You need to add a Samba user:

smbpasswd -a {username}

The -a adds a user to Samba's database so you can log in.

I'm well aware of that news.  That's on Holland America... the same
cruise line that we're using for Geek Cruises.  It's sad that they're
taking every precaution possible and still ending up with some carrier
of the disease between one trip and the next.  I think they made the
right choice to just cancel this week's trip, work to contain the
situation, and then move along, even though the revenue lost must be
significant.

No, that's not the FTP server daemon.  "inetd" is the Internet super
daemon.  It listens on a bunch of ports, on behalf of other service
daemons.  When a connection comes in for one, it fork/exec's the daemon
for that port.  This way, they don't all always have to be running.  It
saves system resources.  Speaking of saving system resources, IMO,
"xinetd" is somewhat of a hog by comparision to plain vanilla "inetd". 
The security fud protection features it provides can be provided by
"tcpd" (tcp-wrappers).  This way, you need only one very lightweight
process running for all those rarely used services.

Ok, so now we know how your FTP daemon is being launched.  "xinetd" is
listening for FTP connections, then launching the actual ftp server
daemon when one comes in.  If you serve a LOT of ftp, you might want to
shut it off in "xinetd", and run a standalone ftp daemon.  The same one
that inetd is starting should work in that mode also, started by an
/etc/init.d script.

So now, back to the original question.  Which brand of FTP server daemon
is it?  wu-ftpd ?  proftpd ?  Once we know that, we can learn how to
configure it by RTFM.  (The man pages provided by it's package can be
gotten via a package manager query | grep.)

I still under the impression that you are using SuSE, so I answering this SuSE
specific.

If you are using SuSEFirewall2 then you have to specify in
/etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2 :
# Do you want to allow routing between interfaces of the same class
# (e.g. between all internet interfaces, or all internal network interfaces)
# be default (so without the need setting up FW_FORWARD definitions)?
#
# Choice: "yes" or "no", if not set defaults to "no"
#
FW_ALLOW_CLASS_ROUTING="yes"

To masquerade requires a few settings in /etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2. 

# Which is the interface that points to the internal network?
#
# Enter all the network devices here which are trusted.
# If you are not connected to a trusted network (e.g. you have just a
# dialup) leave this empty.
#
# Choice: leave empty or any number of devices, seperated by a space
# e.g. "tr0", "eth0 eth1 eth1:1" or ""
#
FW_DEV_INT="eth1 eth2"

# Should routing between the internet, dmz and internal network be activated?
# REQUIRES: FW_DEV_INT or FW_DEV_DMZ
#
# You need only set this to yes, if you either want to masquerade internal
# machines or allow access to the dmz (or internal machines, but this is not
# a good idea). This option supersedes IP_FORWARD from
# /etc/sysconfig/network/options
#
# Setting this option one alone doesn't do anything. Either activate
# massquerading with FW_MASQUERADE below if you want to masquerade your
# internal network to the internet, or configure FW_FORWARD to define
# what is allowed to be forwarded!
#
# Choice: "yes" or "no", if not set defaults to "no"
#
FW_ROUTE="yes"

# Do you want to masquerade internal networks to the outside?
# REQUIRES: FW_DEV_INT or FW_DEV_DMZ, FW_ROUTE
#
# "Masquerading" means that all your internal machines which use services on
# the internet seem to come from your firewall.
# Please note that it is more secure to#
# Which internal computers/networks are allowed to access the internet
# directly (not via proxys on the firewall)?
# Only these networks will be allowed access and will be masqueraded!
#
# Choice: leave empty or any number of hosts/networks seperated by a space.
# Every host/network may get a list of allowed services, otherwise everything
# is allowed. A target network, protocol and service is appended by a comma to
# the host/network. e.g. "10.0.0.0/8" allows the whole 10.0.0.0 network with
# unrestricted access. "10.0.1.0/24,0/0,tcp,80 10.0.1.0/24,0/0tcp,21" allows
# the 10.0.1.0 network to use www/ftp to the internet.
# "10.0.1.0/24,tcp,1024:65535 10.0.2.0/24" is OK too.
# Set this variable to "0/0" to allow unrestricted access to the internet.
#
FW_MASQ_NETS="" communicate via proxies to the
# internet than masquerading. This option is required for FW_MASQ_NETS and
# FW_FORWARD_MASQ.
#
# Choice: "yes" or "no", if not set defaults to "no"
#
FW_MASQUERADE="192.168.1.0/24 192.168.2.0/24"

SuSEFirewall2 is pretty well commented and there are other options you should
set according to your policies.

Thank you
Russell

:-)

I had no trouble at all, once I figured this out:

Appended to "/etc/apt/sources.list":

# KDE 3, from http://www.cupis.co.uk/debian/kde3.html
#
deb     http://download.us.kde.org/pub/kde/stable/latest/Debian/sid ./
deb-src http://download.us.kde.org/pub/kde/stable/latest/Debian/sid ./

# Kdevelop
#
deb http://people.debian.org/~njordan kde3.0/


Appended to "/etc/apt/preferences":

Package: *
Pin: origin download.us.kde.org
Pin-Priority: 989

Package: *
Pin: origin people.debian.org
Pin-Priority: 989

Now "aptitude" selects the new KDE packages preferentially over the ones
at http.us.debian.org.  Amazing tools, huh folks?  I LOVE DEBIAN.

The upgrade proceeded without a hitch, and in 45 minutes I had KDE 3.0
running.

Yes, good point, Rich.  It's best, that is, most useful and relevant,
when giving a RTFM response, to try and help the newbie fill out the
prerequisite graph[1].  If they don't even know about "man" or "info",
or "google", they need to be TAUGHT that.  If they don't know WHAT MAN
PAGE TO READ, then we need to help them learn HOW to find out which one
to read.

[1] graph -- as in mathematical graph theory - nodes and edges.  Put
your googles on if you don't know what that is.  It's used by the
package manager (dpkg or rpm) and by the "make" utility.

Subject: [PLUG] who can write a linux driver for an ISA Pertec tape interface?
Message-ID: <86r8ddnkb4.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

I've got an old 9-track tape drive, a Fujitsu 2444, and a shitty
little ISA Pertec interface card to drive it.  It originally came with
DOS software.  The company we got it from is out of business, but we
have the drive manual, which describes signals it expects, and the DOS
driver source which could be useful at least for clues.  

I have always wanted to get a Linux driver for the card so that we
could continue to use the drive (I had an opportunity just today to do
some data archeology on 10-year old tapes).  The other route is to get
a Pertec/SCSI adapter for $600 or so, which sadly seems more expense
than it is worth.  Does anyone have kernel driver writing skills who
also is sufficiently: a) enthusiastic for a challenge; b) desparate
for something to do; or c) <fill-in-lame-reason-here> that might be
interested in this?  I think I could arrange a small honoraria (a few
hundred bucks), too insultingly small to be called a fee, for someone
who delivers such a thing.  Would probably have to do the work at our
office, where the several hundred pound tape drive lives.

You don't need to apologize.  Just stare in wonder like a child, and

Alright, so it's WU.  Do you still need assistance?  We'll give you some

I could offer a few other reasons why those folks are still unemployed, but
I don't want to get side-tracked in the psychoanalysis of unemployment.
(Although I will mention that someone who has been without a real job for
a year or two is probably also suffering from depression. And needs to get
help.) I just wanted to mention that at my current paying job -- taking
catalog orders at Norm Thompson -- I'd estimate about a quarter of the temps
working there lost their jobs in the high-tech blowout. There simply aren't
enough technology jobs to go around.

Anyway, working at Norm Thompson beats working at Stream. At NT, I'm only
fighting boredom (& it helps working for a company that sells things I
can believe in); at Stream, it was a daily battle for my self respect.

BTW, I'm sure the folks in charge of Norm Thompson are happy to have us
high tech cast-offs: according to one woman who has worked the phone center
for 10 years, the temps they had to settle for barely qualified to be called
the ``scrapings of the barrell." Some of them were obviously not fluent in
their own native tongue -- English. (Well, those weren't exactly her words.
She used rather more earthy language to describe them.

Check the permissions of /dev/dsp, /dev/audio, and /dev/mixer. Make sure
you daughter has write permissions. 

The best solution, if these files are owned by group `audio,' is to make
your daughter's login name a member of group `audio.'

If not, I would first make the permissions permiscous temporarily, see
if it works, and then change the group to audio, lock down the
permissions to 660, and then make her part of the audio group.

Odds are the audio wire running from the CD-ROM drive to the sound card
isn't plugged in.

Is there a play button on the front of the CD-ROM drive?  If so, try
that.  CD playing doesn't rely on software drivers.

Most no-sound I've found is related to mis-wiring. 

Does the PC make other sounds? If so, you might be missing the redbook audio cable that goes from the CD-ROM 
straight to the sound card. It goes on the opposite side of the IDE connecor as the power plug.

If there are no other sounds, check to see if the speakers are plugged into the PC correctly. Sometimes the 
plugs fit into the wrong places so it's easy to plug in incorrectly.

That's my 2 cents.

I'd like to start a shell directly from init, bypassing getty and login.
I put this in my inittab:

# Run bash on first serial port.
S0:2345:respawn:/bin/bash --login

This does start bash, and if I do an 'exit', I immediate get another
bash prompt.  However, signals (ctl-c, ctl-z, and friends) do not work.  
For example, if I do a 'ping', I can never get control back.  It looks
like my problem may be related to terminal process groups.

Does anyone know the correct way to do this?

thanks,
galen

While that's true of most audio playing - it isn't of CD audio.

CD audio goes out the back of the drive directly to the sound card.  I
suppose if you're using some sort of software CD player (which does
nothing but tells the drive to play) you could be looking at bad
permissions for /dev/cdrom (or whatever your cdrom is)... but /dev/dsp,
/dev/audio, and /dev/mixer shouldn't have any effect on playing CDs.

Okay, I'll be happy to RTFM, but which FM? The Kinsey Report or the Kama
Sutra? I still don't know the answer, but I'm certainly appreciating the
problem. The Linux newbie has to learn *a lot* before he even knows enough
to ask a question with enough detail to get a specific answer.

But I'll go search for some FMs and see what I can find. Obviously, I need

I was preparing to install FreeBSD when a friend of mine recommended Gentoo
Linux, and now, after having looked at their pages, I'm interested.

Does anyone here use Gentoo?  How easy is it going to be for a novice Linux
user to install and configure?  As a disclaimer and warning, let it be noted
that I'm not an incredibly patient person when it comes to computers - I
don't mind waiting for 8 hours for something to compile/install, but if I
need to read the gideon bible just to get to the 8 hours of waiting, I am
not interested.  Please note that this is not an "I'm not willing to read
anything", but I'm also uninterested in becoming an authority on
dependencies just so I can watch movies on my system.

I like the idea of a light, fast system that's customized for my hardware,
however, so if installing Gentoo would not be an ordeal or an exercise in
frustration for someone who isn't a unix administrator, I'm definitely up
for it.  I've taken a look at the Gentoo installation pages, and nothing in
there looks too horrible, but I'd prefer impressions from someone who has
been through the install process, along with any pointers or
recommendations.

Thanks,

I've got Gentoo on my laptop and it is now my favorite distro - I've used
Slackware, Debian, RedHat and Mandrake (and I've installed Lycoris).
Gentoo is definately not the easiest of these to install (that distinction
goes to Lycoris), but Gentoo is definately best when it come to installing
software  and upgrading (Debian is second).

Hmmm...  In general I'd say that if you're a newbie that you probably
wouldn't want to start out with Gentoo.  However, if you really don't mind
doing a bit of work up front and you've read the docs on Gentoo.org (which
are actually quite good) and you feel comfortable with them then I'd say
go for it.  You'll learn a lot more about Linux with Gentoo than you would
with, say Mandrake or Lycoris.  However, I would recommend that you have a
fast internet connection (though, I did it over dial-up which took a few
days :) and that you also have another machine next to it browsing the
Gentoo site - that makes it much easier.

Final warning: if this is your first foray into Linux you're jumping in at
the deep end of the pool. However if you feel you can 'swim' in the
deep end you'll find that when you get a Gentoo system setup you'll like
it a lot as you won't have to deal with the dependency problems that are
rampant on distros that use rpm packages (RedHat, Mandrake) and you'll
also find that since all of the packages are compiled specifically for
your architecture that things will run noticably faster than pre-compiled
distros that give you the lowest common denominator binaries that'll run
on the  386.

Don't worry about Karl, just don't feed him.  When confronted with figuring 
out which virtual manual to pull out from the library installed on your 
system, a very useful command is `apropos` (I believe it's the same as man 
-k, but I like typing apropos).

So in your case, a question about ftp permissions, try
$ apropos ftp

You should get a nice fat list and now be in the right aisle.

If you have a broadband connection, you can use google in much the same 
way...hmm `apropos:` ?

Good luck,
Kyle Accardi

Boy. From what I've heard you could spend upwards of 4 or 5 days trying to
get Gentoo running. Which in my mind isn't really a great way to learn how
to actually run the system day-to-day. This is all personal preference,
of course. And what works for me, may not work for others, but the way I
personally learned is just to immerse myself. Drop Windows, cut the cord
and try to do the things I normally did using Linux. First Red Hat, then
Mandrake, then SuSE. Those are by no means lightweight, but I don't need
lightweight as much as I need fully functional and headache-free so I can
focus on programming.

A good route to go, might be to try FreeBSD. I REALLY like FreeBSD. If the
Java support in FreeBSD were better I'd probably switch to it 24/7. And
that's an OS that travels light. It's also pretty free of configuration
widgets so you are forced to learn how to administer it from the
command-line. An awesome learning experience, in my opinion, and a great
OS on which to learn. Problem is that I get the impression that not all
skills are transferrable to Linux. It's somewhat similar, but different to
administer. So depending on what your goals are it might not be of as much
use. But personally if I was trying to learn the Unix-like way of doing
things from scratch and didn't have heavy multi-media needs (or Java needs
currently) I'd go with FreeBSD.

The last version of Gentoo I installed was 1.2 Unless they've made significant progress on their install system since then I would not recommend it for a newbie. It's not quite Linux From Scratch, but it is definitely more hands on than most novices are prepared for. On the other hand, once installed it seemed like a good system. Until Nvidia released drivers for FreeBSD I was considering switching.

Why the special interest in Gentoo and FreeBSD?

Try seeing if using an "stty" command form and/or "tset" from your
shell's login script will turn those signalling keys on there.

You might want to have a look at what "login" does before it fork/exec's
the user's shell.

Yes. An excellent method for this is described in the article below:

"Automated Logins Revisited"
Adrian J. Chung
http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue72/chung.html


-- From the article:

Using your favourite text editor create a file named autologinfred.c and
type in this short C program:

int main() {
   execlp( "login", "login", "-f", "fred", 0);
}

The execlp system call invokes the command "login -f fred" and replaces
the current processing context with this invocation. The man page for
login describes the action of the -f argument. Compile this tiny C program
using the GNU C-compiler:

$ gcc -o autologinfred autologinfred.c

Gain root privileges (using su) and copy the executable to a public
directory:

# cp autologinfred /usr/local/sbin/

Now take a look at /etc/inittab. This is the configuration file is used by
init, the very first process started when Linux initialises. You should
observe lines similar to the following:

1:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty1
2:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty2
3:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty3

The exact contents of /etc/inittab differ from distribution to
distribution. On Debian systems one sees:

1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty1
2:23:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty2
3:23:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty3

Edit the line beginning with "1:2345" so that it reads as follows:

1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty -n -l /usr/local/sbin/autologinfred 38400 tty1

The above will cause the user fred to be logged in automatically on the
first virtual console. On some GNU/Linux distributions (like RedHat)
/sbin/agetty must be used instead. The -l <alternative login> argument to
getty substitutes the default /sbin/login program with the one we compiled
earlier. The -n tells getty to not prompt for a user ID.

[...]

Message-ID: <200211222145.19306.kyle_hayes@speakeasy.net>

I've managed to get Gentoo mostly installed, but it took a while. I have 
yet to configure things like sound and X. I've got an aging P-II 400 and 
it was really wheezing compiling such things as OpenOffice.  I really 
think you shouldn't bother with a source-based distro unless you've got a 
PC that's 2GHz or better.  I used the "stage 3"  tarballs and still had a 
couple of compilation steps that were on the order of 12 hours each.  This 
led to some "domestic friction" with my spouse :-)

I installed 1.4rc1.  I don't think I'd recommend 1.4 until they're actually 
done with it. I ran into many annoying problems that prevented me from 
moving forward such a Gimp being pulled in en masse for gimp-print and 
then finding out that the Gimp ebuild was broken.  Then, the KDE 3.04 
ebuild was broken against X 4.2.0...  The ebuild gurus seem to have worked 
most of this out, but it was not a pleasant introduction to Gentoo.

If you are really new to Unix, I really wouldn't recommend any of the "some 
assembly required" distros.  Learn the basics with one that makes getting 
something running easy.  After three years of beating my head on Red Hat, 
I'm not going to recommend it to anyone.  Mandrake has been pleasing to 
some collegues (and I have a soft spot for French things).  I personally 
like SuSE, but I don't think it's as easy for the newbie as Mandrake.

All that said, I'd love to see a little discussion group on Gentoo.  I am 
very interested in source-based distros and tried Sorcerer before its 
creator went loony and the whole thing split into three projects.  
Sorcerer had the fine point of needing over 40 hours of compile time on my 
machine.  Ouch.  However, within about three days, I was able to write 
"spells" for it and feel like I knew what was going on.  Gentoo isn't 
giving me that feeling of total understanding.

Best,
Kyle

I run Gentoo on one of my boxes.  It's a PIII-650 and it took 3 - 5 days 
of compiling different packages to get to the point where it was very 
usable.  I really like it though.  On the other hand, I've got other 
machines that were running Redhat & Suse to use while waiting.

The 3-5 days were not constant either.  Most of it was seeing what I 
wanted to install, going to bed or work and then seeing how it went. 
Not much work really.  The support available via www.gentoo.org and it's 
forums is great.

For a Linux newbie though, I wouldn't recommend it.

So, to swing a little off the main post.  You might look into ebuilder. 
Makes it kinda easy to build gentoo ebuilds.  Also, as portage has
matured ebuilds are getting nicer and nicer, in some situations it's as
easy as emake, einstall within the ebuild itself.  Though sadly I always
seem to look into things that aren't that easy.  Oh, and after much
streamlining (about 3 or 4 installs) I've gotten gentoo down to a one
day install.  To get most of my stuff running, it's about 2 days to
perfection.

Oh, and back on topic, I would be leary of sugesting gentoo to a
newbie.  Though the package management is great, and 1.4 autodetects
stuff, there isn't a cohesive program for instalation, instead you get
to do all sorts of things one at a time.  I think during the summer, if
nobody has bothered I might see how hard writing an installer is, who
knows, it might be easy with gentoo *shrug*.  But yeah, I say no for
newbies.

I got this to work finally, like this:

int
main (int argc,
      char ** argv)
{
  execl ("/bin/login", "/bin/login", "-f", "karlheg", 0);
}

as "/usr/local/sbin/autologin_karlheg", and:

5:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty -n -l /usr/local/sbin/autologin_karlheg 38400
vc/5

(wrapped by evolution)

You could make that user's login shell be just about anything, provided
it does all the things a login shell is expected to do.

Sendmail is an MTA (Mail Transfer Agent).  It speaks SMTP for sending and
receiving email and has some limited ability to deliver email locally by
writing to a fixed mail directory (though most people these days have
sendmail hand mail over to procmail for local delivery).  It is not a post
office server.  You'll need to run a different daemon to provide that
service.

I kind of like the courier mail system, but there are all kinds of POP and
IMAP servers available.  Try searching by protocol on
<URL: http://www.freshmeat.net >.  A search like "POP3 daemon" should give
some pretty reasonable results.

Thanks to everyone for your help.  I should have told you that I was
trying to save space by eliminating getty and login entirely.  Also, I was
trying to avoid having to create a new program.  Alas, with those 
constraints, I'm not sure it is possible.  Here's the best I could 
come up with.  This at least eliminates login.

In inittab:
T0:23:respawn:/sbin/agetty -f /etc/issue.galens -l /bin/direct -n \
38400 ttyS0 vt100

In /bin/direct:
#!/bin/sh
exec -cl /bin/bash


thanks again,

While I don't speak more than a few words of French (I can ask

Ewww, Sendmail! I would use Postfix or Exim. But that's not what you asked. :)
To retrieve mail with a Windows client, all you do is configure the mail 
client itself. Give it your mail server settings, mail.linuxbox.com, or 
whatever yours is, and the account name and password. 

I believe that people should spend lots of money on books, to support 
hardworking authors. Lots and lots of books. However, if you venture to 
Safari Books on O'Reilly, they are magically viewable for free. Do a search 
for Sendmail, you'll get a long list of books to look at.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0211230851370.14512-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  As part of my port of a DOS/win32 application to linux I need to rename
source code files to have meaningful names rather than the cryptic
abbrevations forced by the 8.3 naming restrictions. For whatever reason, the
author of the original code put each function in it's own .c file. Oodles
and oodles of files in the directory.

  When I listed the directory contents it displayed in three columns across
the screen. The idle thought wandered into my head that the arrangement was
probably done by bash counting the number of files and assigning one-third
to each display column. But, after I had converted a few dozen names, the
display became two columns rather than three. My experience with looking at
lots of directory displays suggests that the shell tries to fit them on a
single line, but creates columns (down, rather than across) as the number or
length becomes too large.

  So, just out of curiosity I would like to learn what controls this
display. I assume that it's something within bash (or the shell of your
choice). Is the algorithm some generally accepted standard or does it vary
with the phase of the moon and the tides?

Not sure what process handles these but it works in a VT as well as an xterm,

$ echo $COLUMNS
92

$ echo $LINES
55


guess is that ls checks $COLUMNS and determines how many columns it can 
display based on the longest filename.

Are you asking how to make the listing go across

a b
c d

instead of down?

a c
b d

I think ls can do that, but I'm not awake enough to look.

  Ah, that makes sense. I wasn't aware of the environment variables above.

  Nope. Just curious how bash or ls decides what I see.

  I've not used emacs since I upgraded from RH 6.2 to 7.3 at the beginning
of September. It was an unpleasant surprise this morning to discover that
Red Hat replace my entire ~/.emacs with it's shitty -- and inappropriate --
new version. I'm royally pissed at this! I cannot recall an upgrade in the
past 5 years where Red Hat replaced an existing config file -- especially in
a user's home/ directory -- without saving the old one or just adding the
new one as *.rpmnew.

  I've lost all the custom colors and control key movements that I had
carefully added over time. The "new, improved" version 21.<whatever> doesn't
tell me what column the cursor is on and I no longer can match a
parenthesis, brace, bracket or angle-bracket by typing the '%' key or by
pressing alt-ctrl-n and ...-p.

  This replacement without saving is a major flaw and I'll find someone at
Red Hat who should learn of this.

Not a happy camper,

Rich

Do you have a backup of your home directories so you have a version of 
your .emacs file you could restore? I take a paranoid approach and 
always backup /home before doing an upgrade just in case something goes 
wrong. That way I haven't put myself into a totally helpless situation 
since I'll be able to restore /home from a backup.

I've actually never needed the backup as I've not had an upgrade fail on 
me yet (knocking on my wooden desk very hard as I write this). :-)

Subject: [PLUG] Apache and php question
Message-ID: <3DDFDB4A.55D5D55@attbi.com>

I'm trying to get my internal home web site running again on RH 8. I
followed the instructions in the books I have but have been unsuccessful
in getting php working. The book says to add the following to httpd.conf

AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps

I have those lines in the file. 

apachectl configtest reports:

Syntax OK.

Apache itself is working; I can connect to the web site from other
machines in the house. However, when I try looking at a page with <?
phpinfo() ?> as its only content, I get a blank page instead of the long
page of php information that I should get. And, when I look at any other
web page that uses php, I see the php commands instead of the results of
those commands. From this, I assume that Apache is not using php.

What step am I missing?

Thanks in advance for the help.

  Yes, I've gone through the menus and the config options but I cannot find
how to remove the hieroglyphic line on the window border. The top window
line has the menu and the fat line underneath has pictures for those who
need to use a mouse on a picture rather than on the word (or just typing the
commands on the keyboard).

  I'd like to take this extra line off the border and gain a line or two in
the buffer. Does anyone know how to do this?

TIA,

PS. Thanks to Dick Steffans I have contact info for one of the folks at last
week's clinic. I'll send him an e-mail about the lost config file.

  I make a full backup every Friday night, but I rotate between two tapes.
Nothing in /home _should_ be touched because it's not a system directory.
And, to compound the crime, they didn't put the new .emacs in as
.emacs.rpmnew nor save my old, multi-hundred line version as .emacs.rpmsave.
They just silently replaced it.

Their should be another line in the apache config that tells apache to load
the PHP shared object file.  (Not sure if 'shared object' file is what it's
called).

On my Debian box, that line looks like:

  LoadModule php4_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/libphp4.so

Stating the obvious here, but the web pages with php should be named with
the .php extension, according to your config, to be parsed by PHP.

PS: After you edit your httpd.conf file, you'll need to restart apache for
those changes to take effect.

Do you have a .emacs~ backup file laying around from the last time you 
edited your .emacs file in emacs? My .emacs and .bash_profile files 
have followed me from job to job over the years and would hate to lose 
them.

One thing I do for my critcal text files is to put them into revision 
control using RCS. I find this very handy as it makes it difficult for 
me to completely lose a file as I can always go back to an older 
working version if I find my newer version doesn't work for me. Theres 
no way that a system upgrade will touch my RCS files so I won't lose 
any critical files even if my system upgrade changes on of them.

I would have to give Red Hat two thumbs down for going through user 
directories and changing or removing user configuration files without 
saving the old file as a backup. Since no .rpmnew file was created it 
makes me wonder if it was something other than "rpm" that did the 
damage. There might have been some post install script or something 
that did this. I suppose they could have had emacs do when you first 
started it up as well I don't really know.

Try putting this in your .emacs file:

 '(tool-bar-mode nil nil (tool-bar))

It appeared when I turned off the toolbar in the Customize pages.
I believe that you can also turn of the toolbar in your X resources.

  Nope. One of the tasks of ~/.bash_logout is to get rid of backups. When I
want to save a file I copy it to a different name rather than leave it with
the tilde hanging off the end.

  I read about this recently in Linux Journal but haven't implemented it
yet.

  No, the datestamp on the file is Sept. 5, when I did the upgrade and had
it upgrade emacs, too.

  Of course there's no way of recovering the file now, so I can find the
humor in the contact name given to me (and presumably correctly typed from
the business card provided) bounces from redhat.com as 'no such user'. I
guess that if you're going to screw up you might as well do it thoroughly
and not half-way. Sigh.

I found it on RH 8.0 at /usr/lib/httpd/modules/libphp4.so and added the
line

   LoadModule php4_module /usr/lib/httpd/modules/libphp4.so

to my httpd.conf file. Then I restarted httpd and got the message:

[root at nec conf]# /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart
Stopping httpd:                                            [  OK  ]

[root at nec conf]#

>From this, I assume that this installation of Apache has the php4 module
compiled in, or something like that.

However, now httpd is not running. If I try to access it locally with
Mozilla, I get an alert message that says:

The connection was refused when attempting to contact 192.168.0.254.

(That's the ip address of the machine.)

If I try to stop httpd at this point, it fails.

[root at nec conf]# /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd stop
Stopping httpd:                                            [FAILED]
[root at nec conf]#

Starting claims to work, but ps -ax | grep httpd only returns the line
showing the grep command. httpd was working before I started on this,
this afternoon.

I switched back to the httpd.conf file supplied by RH and tried to start
it again. It started with the message:

[root at nec conf]# /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd start
Starting httpd: httpd: Could not determine the server's fully qualified
domain name, using 127.0.0.1 for ServerName
                                                           [  OK  ]
[root at nec conf]#

Now I can see the web site again, both locally from Mozilla, and from
other machines in the house. I must have messed up something in
httpd.conf.

> Stating the obvious here, but the web pages with php should be named with

Yep. I sort of thought that might be what the AddType lines were all
about.

Thinking that the message about the domain name might be a clue, I
checked in /etc/hosts and found that I had 192.168.0.255 instead of
192.168.0.254 listed for nec, which is the machines name. I fixed that,
but it didn't make any difference. If I run hostname, it reports nec.
Now that I think about it, I used to be able to reach the web site by
typing nec in the address line of a browser, but now I have to put in
the ip address, so there must be something missing regarding the name of
the machine as Apache sees it.

Any other thoughts on either the machine name or php?

Thanks for the help.

Ali,

  Many thanks.

  Where in the customize pages did you find this? I looked for a 'display'
area but none appeared, so I looked through a few but saw nothing that
looked like a target.

How are you accessing the files? http://127.0.0.1/ or
with file:///var/www/ (or whatever Red Hat uses)? The
only way I ever got that kind of error was by
accessing the files directly (file://), which doesn't
even touch apache, and thus, no PHP, but by accessing
your site through http://127.blah it actually does go
through apache.

HTH,

If it's compiled into apache, it should work.  You might want to check your
php.ini file (not sure where it would be) for this:

  short_open_tag = Off

If it's on, you can open up PHP in your HTML using just '<?' and closing
with '?>'.  If it's off, you have to open with '<?php'.

Some people like it off so XML documents won't be parsed as PHP:

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>

When this sort of thing happens -- apache is mysteriously not running in
this case -- check it's debug log file.  (Implying that you should set
the loglevel appropriately.)

I've found segmentation faults in Apache (and XS mod_perl) modules this
way; once I was having trouble with "Set::Object" causing mod_perl to
segv the apache process.  It would just die on me; the log contained a
minimial clue as to what was occuring, I guessed where it was, and found
that you cannot add "undef" to a Set::Object.  Rather than handling that
gracefully, it would segmentation fault. I bug reported it, and they
fixed it.

Well, then obviously what you must do is write a C replacement for getty
that sets up the terminal then execs the shell.  Perhaps "mingetty" has
what you want?  Maybe it's even all you need?

Perhaps what you need is "busybox".  You can build that with an "ash"
shell, "getty", and "init".  One binary does it all.  It will link with
ulibc also, if you need to get really small.  Also, in the
smallification department, there's a tool used by the Debian
"boot-floppies" installer that performs a library reduction.  It creates
a subset of the shared object libraries... the subset .so's it makes
contain ONLY the union of the sets of functions actually used by all of
the binaries in your small closed system.  This is fine unless you want
to drop arbitrary binaries onto it -- they MIGHT need a library routine
that got elimintated by the tree shaker.

Definitely consider setting up RCS or CVS. For local stuff RCS is really 
easy to setup and emacs has support for it so you can check files 
in/out of RCS from within emacs. I generally use RCS from emacs but I'm 
comfortable checking files in/out from the command-line as well.

Thanks, that was the clue I needed. Got it working already.

Thanks again,

Richard,

You need to turn on short_open_tags in /etc/php.ini. I had the same
problem when I went from RedHat 7.3 to RedHat 8.

You might want to write your future PHP scripts with the "proper" PHP
tags, like:

<?php phpinfo(); ?>

instead of short tags:

<? phpinfo(); ?>

I'll second that.
If you start working with another language with php...such as xml, you
will find problems with the short tags being turned on.
I'm currently in the process of doing find and replaces on <? to change
them to <?php on a lot of old code because I am using XML now and needed
to turn short tags off.

<? phpinfo() ?>
and
<? xml version="1.0" ?>
won't work together otherwise. (at least as far as I know...)

I tested this by changing the phpinfo.php file as you recommend above.
Works like a charm with no other changes to httpd.conf or php.ini. Looks
like I either missed something several months ago when I first learned
how to write php, or the books I used missed something. Now I know
better.

Regarding short_open_tags, Rob Hudson wrote:

That makes sense. I'll try the php.ini file change to make sure
everything's OK, and then probably go back and edit the offending .php
files to fix them.

Thanks to all for the advice.

Busybox is on my list of things to do, but it has a low priority right
now.  It's good to know about the library reduction tool.  BTW, this
is on a serial port, so mingetty won't work.

  Ah, there it is!

  I've looked around there -- and other customization menus -- trying to
find where I can add the cursor's current column position to the status
line. Do you know that one, too, offhand?

Many thanks, Ali,

I've been thinking about something similar to Safari, only using real
books instead of e-books.  It would follow the same format: monthly fees
that differ based on the number of books you wanted to read at any one
time.  So, the lowest fee would only allow you to have one book out at
any one time.  But, you would be able to return at anytime to get a
different book.

Ideally, the monthly fee would be as close an nominal as possible, but
it would almost have to be more then Safari's monthly fee, as you would
have to physically ship the books back and forth.  Similar to
netflix.com.  

How does this sound, would you use it?  Would it be useful?  Or do most
people like having permanent copies of the books they buy?

This is a brilliant system and the more people involved, the more books
could be shared by the widest segment of the public.

I'm quite thankful that such a system has already been devised and
implemented (by Benjamin Franklin, no less) and is called the "public
library".

The fee is shockingly nominal when spread across all of our society.  
Hell, we could probably double the amount we spend on the system and it
would be an even better deal.

I forgot to mention that when the scale is increased greatly, the limit on
number of books allowed at one time drops to such a tiny differential that
it can be discarded entirely.

Subject: [PLUG] Better console keymap for XEmacs.
In-Reply-To: <878yzjddoz.fsf@dnbridge.dyndns.org>
References: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0207220630100.10101-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

Message-ID: <1038097676.19209.14.camel@bittersweet.intra.hegbloom.net>

For XEmacs:

Use "m4" on the xhypermap.m4 to generate a console keymap that gives
sane keysyms for Ctrl-_ and shifted function keys, etc.  Dump it into a
file by using the shell's ">" operator.  On a Debian GNU/Linux system,
you would then copy that into /etc/console, gzip it, then use
"install-keymap" to make it get installed on reboot.

Then, install the "ext-fkeymap.el" into your
"~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/lisp/user" or anyplace you like, on your
`load-path', and follow the instructions at the top of the file to
install it in your XEmacs.  Now you can use "Ctrl-_" for undo, shifted
function keys, and Meta-Left / Meta-Right for `backward-sexp' and
`forward-sexp', just like under the X Window System.

A similar "ext-fkeymap.el" could probably be written for GNU Emacs; this
one MIGHT even Just Work; I've never tried it.

# This keymap is a ground-up reimplementation of the keyboard map,
# intended to be consistent and rational.  It uses an m4 metalanguage to
# declare the key mappings.  Usage is `m4 hypermap.map | loadkeys'.
#
# # m4 xhypermap.m4 | gzip -c -9 > /etc/console/boottime.kmap.gz
#
# The modifier flags used are `shift' (1), `control' (4), and `alt' (8).
# Left and right modifiers are not distinguished.
#
# In general, Meta is always distinguished, and M-S-KEY is distinct from
# M-KEY.  This is good news for Emacs users.  C-S-KEY is consistently
# folded into C-KEY.
#
# Shift is more loosely interpreted than the other modifiers; usually if
# S-KEY has no special meaning, the action will be the same as KEY.
# However, if M-KEY or H-KEY is undefined, nothing happens.
#
# Because Caps Lock's position is so out of proportion to its utility,
# it's been totally redefined to a new sort of modifier, which I've
# arbitrarily named `Hyper'.  Shift is ignored with Hyper.  Hyper
# provides dead keys:
#	H-`	dead accent grave
#	H-'	dead acute accent
#	H-^	dead circumflex
#	H-t	dead tilde
#	H-d	dead diaeresis
# and ISO-8859-1 symbols (some more mnemonic than others):
#	H-SPC	nobreakspace
#	H-!	inverted bang
#	H-h	cents (`hundredths')
#	H-#	pounds sterling
#	H-$	currency
#	H-y	yen
#	H-|	broken bar
#	H-s	section (the galaxy symbol)
#	H-c	copyright
#	H-a	feminine ordinal
#	H-<	left guillemot
#	H-]	not sign (it's angular)
#	H--	soft hyphen
#	H-r	registered trademark symbol
#	H-=	macron
#	H-0	degrees
#	H-[	plus/minus (near + and -)
#	H-k	superior 2 (jkl form a series)
#	H-l	superior 3
#	H-u	mu
#	H-p	pilcrow
#	H-:	centered dot
#	H-j	superior 1
#	H-o	masculine ordinal
#	H->	right guillemot
#	H-q	1/4 fraction (qwe form a series)
#	H-w	1/2 fraction
#	H-e	3/4 fraction
#	H-?	inverted question mark
#	H-x	multiplication symbol
#	H-%	division symbol
#
# You can also use Hyper plus Alt to type characters by decimal code on
# the keypad, as with Alt alone, or in hex on the main keyboard.  And
# H-TAB is a Caps Lock.
#
# Function keys work as marked, except that Alt plus a function key
# switches to the corresponding virtual console.
# 
# A-F1     - A-F12     --> console  1 through 12
# S-A-F1   - S-A-F12   --> console 13 through 24
# C-A-F1   - C-A-F12   --> console 25 through 36

Anyone got a copy of an email with a virus in it, like the ones that I
see now and then hitting the PLUG list server as non-member postings? 
If so, will you please send it my way, and if possible, not as an
attachment, but as a regular mail addressed to me?

I promise not to mail it out to anyone; I'm just testing some filtering
software that I hope will enable us to open the PLUG lists back up to
legitimate non-member posting.

Someone at the school I went to a couple of years ago has been hit by
the Klez virus and so I get stuff every now and again. I'll try to
remember to forward the next one to you.

  Thank you very much, Karl. Now that I tried it, it makes sense. But, I
had no clue it existed.

  I'd re-read the GNU Emacs book this evening but I've got a stack of books
ahead of it.

  So much to learn, so little time.

  I've read good things about gnus. But, after five years I've got pine
tamed and working very well so there's no sense changing to something else.

  So, are you suggesting that my short-term memory is shot? It probably is;

I just re-created PLUG-test.  I am so far the only one subscribed.
Before you subscribe beware that I plan to do virus scanner and spam
scanner tests there.  Don't sign on if you are running Outbreak Express,
for instance, unless you are doing that ON PURPOSE.

Anyone got a Klez virus they can throw at it?  It will accept posts from
anyone...  plug-test at lists.pdxlinux.org

Let's find out if "spamassassin" (with "razor2") knows about the common
viruses... Or will it also need a virus scanner?

I've got it set so that anything with:

subject: \*\*\*\*\*SPAM\*\*\*\*\*

... in the headers will get blocked for list manager approval.  Exim
scans all mail on the way in with spamassassin.

  Not at the moment. But, they come in bunches, just like grapes. I'll save
you the next ones that come it.

  Actually, today is remarkably spam-free for a weekend. There are generally
a bunch that bypass the postfix filters, but this morning I think there was
only one and only one more came in today.

  I like you test spam, Karl. Did it make you a lot of money?

It's the test message that comes with Spamassassin.

I think if you want to block viruses, you need AMaViS (which does work
with SpamAssasin) or something similar.  I don't know how well Exim
works with it - I'm a postfix kinda guy myself.  :-)

I wouldn't be terribly surprised if SA did block a few viruses on
accident, though.

It's worth noting that my combo AMaViS/SpamAssasin *has* blocked a few
legit PLUG emails since I installed them... as well as a few legit
emails from other lists.  It is rare, but does happen.  I'm willing to
put up with it myself, though.  :-)

Does SA drop the email or add SPAM to the subject line?

Mine drops it, but it isn't a complete SA setup.

If it drops it, you may want to add a bounce message - so those legit
emailers know there is a problem.  Spam emails would just bounce to
non-existant addresses.

It modifies the subject line, probably adds another header or two, and
edits the body of the message with information about why it marked it as
spam.  In Mailman's admin page for a list, under "Privacy Options",
there's a text box where you enter regular expressions, one per line, to
be tried against the message headers.  When one matches, the message is
held for moderator approval.  So now anything flagged as SPAM is held
for approval.

I have not opened the list yet, but will as soon as I get AMaViS / OAV
Scannerdaemon / Spamassassin all working right under Exim.  I'm tired of
the constant non-member posts.  I'd rather just let them through, but
many of them are virus or SPAM.  I want those stopped, but any random
person posting via the USENET interface or via a web email archive ought
to get through.

Your mail to 'PLUG-test' with the subject

Is being held until the list moderator can review it for approval.

The reason it is being held:

    Message body is too big: 137633 bytes but there's a limit of 40 KB

Either the message will get posted to the list, or you will receive

Subject: [PLUG] Virus and SPAM scanning implemented for PLUG mail.
Message-ID: <1038128520.4870.63.camel@bittersweet.intra.hegbloom.net>

I've installed and set up "AMaViS" with the "clamav" virus scanner, as
well as Spamassassin.  These are run by Exim for all incoming email to
lists.pdxlinux.org.  Virus email is quarantined, and the person who sent
it is sent a notice regarding the virus, so they'll know they've been
infected.  Mail flagged as SPAM has the subject line modified, with the
string "*****SPAM*****" prepended.  The Mailman list software
configuration allows a list of expressions that if one matches a mail
header, that mail is held for moderator approval rather than sent out to
the list members.  I've added an expression to match SPAM tagged email.

You may test this by sending SPAM and virus email to the "PLUG-test"
list, or even straight to the normal "PLUG" list if you like.  It SHOULD
not show up at all now, even if you're a subscriber.

After we are all comfortable with this, I suggest that we open the list
back up to allow non-member posting again.

If anyone wants to know how it was done, just log into
drizzle.pdxlinux.org and look over the "/etc/exim/exim.conf" file along
with the conffiles for amavis, clamav, and spamassassin.

Just wondering if everyone with a user account on Drizzle is checking
their mail there on a regular basis or not?

When I send mail to "users at drizzle.pdxlinux.org", are you all reading
it, I wonder?  (I'd have sent this there if I was certain it would reach
all of you.)  I need to know because very soon I will be implementing
cram-md5 authentication for both the IMAP and TLS SMTP AUTH (for
authorized relay).

Will this be a problem for anyone (with an account on drizzle)?  Do all
of your mail user agents (MUA's) support:

IMAP with TLS on port 143, or IMAPS (IMAP over SSL on port 993)
SMTP AUTH, preferrably over a TLS encrypted connection?

I'm pretty sure that Evolution can do these things.

Yes, it should be safe to open the list to non-member posts again. 
Then, the NNTP interface will work again also.

Subject: [PLUG] BRU backup with CRU crash recovery
Message-ID: <20021124161956.772972FEAA@joseph.doink.com>

I'm using BRU for backup and CRU for crash recovery.  CRU initiates a 
BRU backup for use in the crash recovery process.  In the 'cru' 
script there's this note:

# This is the CRU main startup script.  It is run on the host system and calls
# the other elements to create the boot and root disks, as well as perform a
# full CRU-compatible backup.
#
# NOTE: It is very important that the 'crubackup' script be used to create
#       the recovery backup.  While it is possible to MANUALLY recover from
#       a standard BRU backup, the automated recovery requires that the backup
#       be created in a specific manner for proper operation.

Looking further in the script it calls 'dobackup' which calls 'bru' 
like this:

bru -cvvv -O -A -m -R -f ${DEVICE} -L "CRU system backup" - </tmp/CRU.backup

which looks more or less like a vanilla 'bru' command line.  About a 
month ago I sent an email to the BRU support line, since I'm a paying 
customer, asking them what's special about the backup initiated by 
CRU.  I haven't heard anything back yet.  I'd like to add the option 
to use compression to the above command line since w/o compression 
the backup takes twice as many tapes and twice as long to complete.

Any thoughts?   Thanks....

  I keep intending to set up CRU but have never gotten around to it. Sigh. I
_really_ should, I know. Anyway, ...

  What version of BRU are you using? They (now The Tolis Group) dropped the
-Z compression option from release 17.x Something about it being built in or
automatically detected; I forget the exact reason. Anyway, I modified incbru
and it's been chugging along just fine so it must work.

  I don't have the fastest tape drive available, only 3-4M per minute, but
it was the fastest I could afford. Besides, there's not that much data (only
about 16G). I don't know whether or not it's compressed because the logs
don't show it one way or the other and the backups are every night on a 60G
tape.

  FWIW, I've had excellent support (e-mail and phone) from the guys there on
the few occasions I've needed it.

Is she playing an audio CD?

If she is then there might not be an audio cable from the cd drive to the 
sound card/motherboard.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.44.0211241622330.29650-100000@eel.ENGR.ORST.EDU>

Hi folks -

I'm trying to check my '/' filesystem, and according to e2fsck I should
unmount my filesystem before checking it. However, when I try to
unmount the filesystem ("umount /") I get this error:

"umount: /: device is busy"

How do I unmount my '/' filesystem so it can be checked without using the
/ filesystem itself?

Thanks,

This will also work with MS Exchange / Outlook. That's the format it's
in. I suspect that's why Evolution can add it (being an 'Outlook Clone'
and all)... I seriously doubt anything else will be able to just add it
to your calendar, unless other things have started supporting Outlook /

Boot with a floppy or cd-rom and check it that way.  tomsrtbt

Your feedback is needed.If you have comments or suggestions for
improving the site we'd love to hear from you!

Finally, look for the site to be at this address this week:

Hi Karl -

> All incoming mail will now be SPAM scanned.

Out of curiousity, what happens to messages when they test positive for
spam? It gets sent on to us with **SPAM** in the subject line, correct?

In theory the positive message could also be deleted or placed in a folder
for review by the sysadmin, but as legitimate email is often tagged
positive, this could violate the user's privacy. For example, if
spamassassin tagged a steamy letter from your girlfriend as spam, you
wouldn't want the admin reading the letter and forwarding it on to you.

Another guideline established on site-wide spam filtering is to provide
users the means to opt out. For example, most users don't receive a lot of
spam and it would be annoying if one of their friend's emails were
consistently flagged as spam. Mandatory spam filtering also constitutes a
kind of censorship in that messages containing certain phrases, or manners
of expression (ie shouting in all caps), are usually flagged.

Anyway, I don't get many messages on this account, but generally its
important to balance spam filtering and protecting user privacy/freedom of
speech. Observing the "tag and forward" and "opt-out" policies helps to
achieve this.

Thanks,

Tyler

I know the public library exists, and whenever possible, I use it.  But,
I have found they they have a dismal selection of technical books, hence
the previous message.  If the library had such a great selection, why
would anyone buy books in the first place? 

Also, this system would allow for book reviews, similar to amazon.com,
and would keep a nice, updated list of books, both learning and
reference.  I feel that that it could be worth a monthly fee to be able
to "check-out" a good, quality book on a language I am only going to use
for side-projects, or something I am personally interested in.

Subject: [PLUG] RH 8.0 Kernel Compiling
References: <3DDDA6FB.B346529B@attbi.com>
Message-ID: <3DE1B151.967B55DD@attbi.com>

I'm getting ready to compile the kernel. I'm getting confusing
information from multiple sources about just which set of source files
to work with. There are some kind of source files on the machine put
there during the RH 8.0 installation process. But, the README file in
there (/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-14) says not to use them. Instead it says
to unpack the source from the CD into my home directory. I looked on the
three CD's I have and do not find the source. I do find a README file on
the CD's that says the source is on either CD 4 or 5.

I did a google search for the Linux kernel and found
linux-2.4.18.tar.gz. I'm assuming that there will probably be something
different between this kernel source and what I'd get from Redhat. At
the Redhat ftp site I find kernel-2.4.18-14.src.rpm. Is that the same as
what I've already got installed? Is there someplace else I should be
looking for a tar.gz file that would be the source for 2.4.18-14?

I suspect that there will be many different answers to the question,
what source should I use? I want to maintain as much compatibility with
the existing installation as possible while compiling the kernel
optimized for the AMD K-6. Or, does that matter? Would it be safe to use
the latest stable kernel source, which is something like 2.4.19, or
would that break things done in the installation?

Thanks for any advice.

Since nobody else using KDE is speaking up, I gave it a shot. Takes a little 
jumping through hoops, but KOrganizer deals with it fine once it's in.
Had to save it off to a file manually and do a Merge from within KOrganizer. 
KMail doesn't have integrated support to toss it at KOrganizer, but it's on 
the "Todo" list:
http://korganizer.kde.org/korgtodo.html#subKOrganizer%20-%201047142960.423

It's actually fairly trivial, it would appear.

All,

I am pleased to announce the Mid-Willamette Valley LUG's brand new web
sight! You can find it here:

  http://www.mwvlug.org

  or here:

  http://www.linux-enterprise.net

The sight-subject to member approval-is a total revamp of the old site.
Here you can get the latest news, MWVLUG activity announcements, and
Linux documentation!

Additionaly, you can submit your own Linux related stories and
announcements! 

Please be patient as bandwidth is limited during the beta phase as we
add more content and get the site into it's new home.

Your feedback is needed.If you have comments or suggestions for
improving the site we'd love to hear from you!

Finally, look for the site to be at this address this week:

  http://www.mwvlug.org

I registered and updated the DNS records for this domain. It should take
about two days for the entries to propogate throughout the Internet.


Enjoy!


Best,


Cooper Stevenson

Message-ID: <3DE23684.7020907@attbi.com>

Good morning everyone. I need help with a class lab assignment. I am 
supposed to get nfs running on two machines, be able to mount a 
directory on the server...and so on. I have nfs compiled into both 
kernels and it shows up in the /proc/filesystems file. I have mounted 
directories on the server box that show up in the /etc/fstab file. When 
I try to mount a directory from the client side I get this error:   
mount: 10.0.0.40: failed, reason given by server, Permission denied.   
In the /etc/export file the directory has these parameters: (insecure, 
no_root_squash, rw), insecure just because I was trying to remove all 
barriers to get this to work......Does anyone have some advice? I am 
about to start hitting my head against the wall....

After you added your entries to /etc/exports, did you run exportfs -a (on the 
NFS server)?

Also, I found this NFS how-to to be very helpful when I first started using 
NFS.

You might check your logs to see more information about the specific 
error - try to mount the directory, and then 'ls -lt | head' the 
/var/log directory.  Pick the top file and tail it to see what your 
error could be.

Here's my /etc/exports file:  (stupid line wrap)

# cat /etc/exports
/home/users     192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0(rw)
/var/cache/apt/archives         192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0(rw,no_root_squash)
/usr/share/public               192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0(rw)

Here's /etc/fstab from a remote system:

# tail /etc/fstab
192.168.1.252:/home/users   /home/users     nfs 
rsize=8192,wsize=8192,timeo=14,intr     0       0
192.168.1.252:/usr/share/public     /usr/share/public       nfs 
rsize=8192,wsize=8192,timeo=14,intr     0       0

# mount
192.168.1.252:/home/users on /home/users type nfs 
(rw,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,timeo=14,intr,addr=192.168.1.252)
192.168.1.252:/usr/share/public on /usr/share/public type nfs 
(rw,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,timeo=14,intr,addr=192.168.1.252)

Hope that helps somewhat.  I noticed that you said you were using 
/etc/export (sans 'S'), that could be an issue.

Good luck.

I'd be interested to know what it says in /var/log/messages on the 
server. There are a couple things to look at:

* the Linux portmap is typically compiled against libwrap, so you'll 
  need to make sure that /etc/hosts.{allow,deny} allow incoming 
  connections from your client

* sometimes, /var/lib/nfs/*tab will store old/errant information about 
  which machines are mounting what, and new mounts will stall. A 
  reboot can help or, if you're up to it, pop rmtab into a text 
  editor, remove current references to your client system, and retry 
  the mount operation

* double-check that there are no ipchains or iptables rules that would 
  prohibit your client from accessing the server

* check the troubleshooting section of the nfs FAQ:

    http://nfs.sourceforge.net/nfs-howto/troubleshooting.html

One more for the RTFM department:

If you are a CS student or professional, you need to know about:

 http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/cs

It's the BEST way to find research articles in the Computer Science
field.  I wonder if there are any similar sites, using the same
software, holding collections of articles for other sciences?

I've found that the best document format for reading many of these is
DjVu.  It's the fastest one, and works well with older papers that have
been scanned from paper hardcopy, like the older MIT AI memos.  Many of
the PDF files are hard to read since they've been converted from
postscript, and don't contain very good fonts.

To use DjVu, if you run Debian GNU/Linux, you can use "apt-get" to
install:

djview - utilities for the extraordinary DjVu image format
djvulibre-bin - utilities for the extraordinary DjVu image format
djvulibre-plugin - browser plugin for the extraordinary DjVu image format

?Are there similar packages available for those using other Linux
distributions?

Sure, in theory... but the only messages that are getting sent to a
sysadmin for checking are those sent to the *public list*... so in this
case that is not an issue.

It would be one hell of a sysadmin who would go through your mail and
look for spam... lol  :-)

Since all it does is add something to the subject line... I wouldn't be

if you touch /etc/forcefsck and reboot, at least Slackware will check
the root partition.

Don't the other guys (RH, Debian, etc) do that?

No need to use a floppy or CD or something.  :-)

Sorry about the spam folks, I was testing the filter with some samples and
they made it through spam assassin. Perhaps non-member posts could be
monitored for spam more closely than member posts to prevent false
negatives?

What about dropping down to single-user mode, mounting / read-only and 
running fsck?

No loss of uptime that way.  ;)

Oops, this message was actually regarding spam filtering on our drizzle

Btw, thanks everyone for the info on how to fsck and umount. (wait, that
doesn't sound right. What were you Unix folks thinking when you made up
these commands? :)

An ext2 file system does not need to be umounted, IIRC, it will work if
you mount it read only.  It's been a long time since I've needed to
fsck.

It is possible that Red Hat has patches in their kernels that are not in
the stock kernels (yet if ever).  I know that, at least for a while,
perhaps that's changed recently, you have to use a Debian kernel-source
packaged kernel if you plan to use Debian's "initrd-tools", since they
create a "cramfs" initrd, and the stock kernel cannot use "cramfs" for
an initrd.

When you install the Debian kernel-source package, it drops a .tar.bz of
the kernel into /usr/src.  That tarball opens up into
"kernel-source-<version>/", rather than into "linux/", so that you can
have the sources to several kernels installed without conflict.

I would assume that Red Hat does the similar.

I tried that just yesterday and couldn't remount / ro.  I didn't feel
like dicking with it at the time (this is my play box, not the server)
so I just touched the file and rebooted.  :-)

I realized you were talking about the drizzle accounts...

Karl set up the rule to send the *****SPAM***** stuff to the admin in
the mailman config.  All spamassasin is doing is changing the subject to
include SPAM.

It should still be delivered right to your mailbox... so sure it may be
annoying to deal with false positives if you get any, but you won't
*not* get any email (unless it is virus-infested) and there shouldn't be
any privacy concerns.  :-)

At least... that is how I read it....

/usr/bin/rename is in newer versions of util-linux, if it exists you can
simply run:
$ rename " " _ *\ *

to replace the spaces with underscores in all of the filenames that
contain spaces.

There's an older c program written by

Rob Schipper, but I can't google it.

The tarball is only 12K if you want me to sent it.

You must shut down all services that have files open for writing. 
Generally, this means going to runlevel 1, with "telinit 1".  DON'T DO
THIS ON A REMOTE MACHINE!

On "drizzle.pdxlinux.org", runlevel 2 is the lowest remote level I have
configured.  There are no services running aside from the devfsd and
sshd at runlevel 2.  I can "telinit 2" from here, to shut down
everything, then "telinit 4" to bring it back up again, with no reboot. 
I have done this several times now, after system upgrades, to ensure
that the newly upgraded libraries are in use by all daemons.

Drizzle will never need a fsck, since it uses Reiserfs.

Yes, and each user with a login and email account can edit

There's an old perl script by Larry Wall that I dropped in my bin directory.
It allows you to use regexes to rename files.  To replace spaces with
underscores, you would write this:

  # rename 's/ /_/g' fileglob*.txt

Attached is the perl script.
-------------- next part --------------
#!/usr/bin/perl

#Usage: ren perlexpr [files]

($op = shift) or die "Usage: ren perlexpr [filenames]\n";

if (!@ARGV) {
  @ARGV = <STDIN>;
  chop(@ARGV);
}

for (@ARGV) {
  $was = $_;
  eval $op;
  die $@ if $@;
  unless ($was eq $_) {
    rename($was,$_) or die "Unable to rename $was: $!\n";
  }
}

I know the public library exists, and whenever possible, I use it.  But,
I have found they they have a dismal selection of technical books, hence
the previous message.  If the library had such a great selection, why
would anyone buy books in the first place? 

Also, this system would allow for book reviews, similar to amazon.com,
and would keep a nice, updated list of books, both learning and
reference.  I feel that that it could be worth a monthly fee to be able
to "check-out" a good, quality book on a language I am only going to use
for side-projects, or something I am personally interested in.

The problem is that when the shell globs, it won't get the file names
with spaces in them -- they'll be split on IFS, which contains a space!

You have to walk the directory with Perl, or use an explicit list of
file names, either with spaces "\" escaped, or inside a perl script.

I've got a nice talk I just wrote for a university on "Perl Code
Reviews".  The first two-thirds is on Code Reviews, what they are, why
they work, and selling them to your boss.  The last third is Perl
specific.  I could present it in an hour, or stretch it to two.

You may need to run the rename thing a few times... I've found that it
only replaces the first instance of a space in a filename, so it the
filename has four spaces you must run it four times to get them all
changed.

Why do you call icalendar a weird format, it's defined by RFC's, I think

Not sure precisely.  Checking my backup logs, it did something on the
order of 88meg/minute (~5 GiB/hour) for me on my last local backup on
the write pass, and about the same on the compare pass.  This is using
tar, which I trust more than anything else.

Yes, it is internal.  We got it as a backup to an external (a 624000N)
that was starting to act flaky.  The internal mechanism is identical.

As I mentioned in another thread, I was doing some office archeology
recently.  In addition to other things, I came across one of my
notebooks for 1992-1993.  In it, as part of an entry on November 17th,
1992, I found the following:

 Marcus came by a little later and we installed an operating system
 called Linux on a partition on Sharon's machine.  Was at the office
 until 6 a.m.!  Ouch.

We were installing a thing called SLS, for "SoftLanding System", I
think.  Basically, a bunch of floppy images that we sucked down on a
14.4k modem.

So, just a week late, here is to 10 years of liberation and freedom
with GNU/Linux!

ren will clobber files if you're not careful, and I kept
running into situations that it won't handle right, like
    ren 's/\d+/$& + 1/e' 1 2 3 4
will end up moving 1 to 4.  so I wrote my own a while ago,
and it's become almost generally usable now.

Of course it will.  You told it to :)
It would probably be better to say something like:

ren will let you clobber files, just like rm -f will.

well, yes, but the variant I wrote comes much closer to "do
what I want" all the time, which makes it more useful than
ren.  like, it also does things like
    cmv 'tr/1234/2341/' 1 2 3 4
the way I want it to.

Thanks, Karl. I was hoping to find that to be the case, too. However, in
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-14/README, under the section "INSTALLING the
kernel:" it says:

------------
"If you install the full sources, put the kernel tarball in a directory
where you have permissions (eg. your home directory) and unpack it..." 

"Do NOT use the /usr/src/linux area! This area has a usually incomplete)
set of kernel headers that are used by the library header files. They
should match the library, and not get messed up by whatever the
kernel-du-jour happens to be."
------------

I found kernel-2.4.18-14.src.rpm at the ftp.redhat site. What I don't
know is if that is the full source, or if, when installed, that will
simply replace the stuff in /usr/src that I already have.

Weird.  My usual burn/check routine looks like this:

    # cdrecord -v  my_image.iso
       ... lots of messages ...

    # md5sum my_image.iso /dev/cdrom
    58caad7d93b06c1c0e2af1ce2111a4ae  my_image.iso
    58caad7d93b06c1c0e2af1ce2111a4ae  /dev/cdrom

The main difference here is that I don't use dd(1).

We had some weirdness with some early RH 6.2 kernels and ASUS
motherboards which excercised a Via chipset bug, and could get
different answers depending on which programs accessed the IDE
devices.  Not a common problem, but not unheard of, either.

My first experience with Linux was during the Winter of 1995 (probably
Jan. or Feb), with "Yggdrasil Fall '94 Plug-n-Play Linux".  I was living
in a ski village in Idaho.  I'd UPS'd my brand new 486DX-33 8Mb RAM to
myself.  It was running Dos 6.0 and Windows 3.1.  My girlfriend had a
discount software mail order catalog, and in there was a $9.99 CD with a
"Unix Clone, all source code included".  It sounded fun, and was cheap,
so I ordered it.

They had a graphical installer based on Tcl/Tk on the X Window System. 
It ran Linux 1.0, IIRC.  Within a month, I had blown away the DOS
partition and given the entire machine over to Linux.  I have not used
anything but Linux since that day.

I agree that the Reply-To should NOT be set, Randal.  But every time I

do not know how to use the "Reply to list" feature of their mail

yes, I think you misunderstand shell parsing.  this is
described in detail in the "EXPANSION" section of the bash
man page.  globbing happens after a command is split into
words, the globbing generates a list of words, it doesn't
get concatenated together and re-split.  all unix shells I
can think of are like that.

Dick,

If I were you, I'd shy away from building kernels using Red Hat's 
source package. It's not that it's bad; it's just that it's unwieldy, 
with lots of patches, backports, etc. Plus, if you do things Red Hat's 
way, you won't end up with a kernel that's much smaller or more 
optimized than Red Hat's.

I'd grab the 2.4.19 tarball from kernel.org and any of the gazillions
of patches floating around the Net you think will help your particular
machine(s). You can use Red Hat's /boot/config-$(uname -r) file, which
should already be installed, as a guide to your configuration.

The only exception to the "grab the kernel.org tarball" would be the 
case where you rely on a patch set that Red Hat has made to work: 
user-mode Linux, LVM, crypto API, blue tooth, gigabit-over-copper 
ethernet, or what-have-you. In that case, I'd recommend just using Red 
Hat's build rather than struggling long and hard for the pretty 
dubious return of duplicating Red Hat's stock kernel.

Oh, wow.  That's really way bogus.  The libc6-dev package ought to ship
the <linux/*> and <asm/*> headers and install them under /usr/include,
rather than symlinking to ones in /usr/src/linux.  (One more reason why
serious developers should not work fromn a Red Hat box. <grin/>)  There
might be some things to read regarding this issue in the debian-devel
mailing list archives, and perhaps also in the /doc/libc6-dev/ readme's
on www.pdxlinux.org.

It's also bogus that Linus ships the kernel sources tarred up so they
open to "linux/" like that.  I wonder how many times people have opened
up a new kernel tarball right over the top of the old, realizing too
late that they forgot to move the old one aside for safe keeping?  That
is why the Debian kernel-source tarballs are repacked so they open into
"kernel-source-<version>/" instead.

That also is somewhat bogus, in light of the potential to install
kernel's other than Linux!  It ought to be "linux-source-<version>", and
perhaps the "<version>" ought to include not only the upstream kernel
version, but also the "-N" Debian package "build" version number as
well.  This way, you could have "hurd-source-<version>" or
"freebsd-source-<version>", for example.

I build kernel's in "/usr/src", which is group owned and writeable by a
group called "ksrc", on my machine.  Actually, by default, on a freshly
installed Debian machine, "/usr/src" is group owned by "src".  Users in
that group have writes there.

I always use the "kernel-package" package's `make-kpkg' utility to build
my kernel and modules as a .deb, since the postinst script in the
resulting "kernel-image-...deb" takes care of ensuring that my initrd is
rebuilt, and that the boot loader is configured for the new kernel.

The "initrd-tools" setup on Debian is pretty good.  It lets you
customize what will end up in the initrd image.  The image is not
generated until after you install the kernel-image.  It's not shipped
inside the kernel-image, since that would eliminate the possiblity to
place custom software inside of it, and would make it need to be a lot
smarter about knowing what device is your "/", etc.  If you want to know
more, I suggest just grabbing the source to it.  (ask for an account on
drizzle.pdxlinux.org if you want access to a Debian box where you can
easily "apt-get source" to have a look.)

You should be able to use "mc" (midnight commander) to look inside of
the .rpm package, to see what it will install and where.

This is another part of the kernel building process in which Debian's
system really shines.  Not only are there "kernel-source-<version>"
packages (which only install a Linux source .tar.bz2, not the Debian
kernel building setup, which is installed by the "kernel-package"
package), there are many "kernel-patch-*" packages.

Kernel patch packages are generated by a special script, found in
"dh-kpatches".  They install the patch itself, as a "diff -u", in
"/usr/src/kernel-patches/{all,i386,sparc,ppc,...}/<patchname>/".  Also,
in "/usr/src/kernel-patches/{all,i386,...}/{apply,unpatch}/<patchname>",
are shell scripts that apply the named patch or unpatch the kernel in
your PWD.  Those scripts can be run automaticly by "make-kpkg", if you
like.

This is a really nice setup.  It makes it very easy to install a
customized kernel on several machines, or to get one running with well
tested and reasonably stable patches for XFS, FreeSwan IPSEC, or EVMS.

Debian really is very well set up for the non-casual Linux user, server
admin, and developer.

Subject: [PLUG] Problem - Installating RH7.3 on a RAID-0 box co-exiting with
 Windows
Message-ID: <5.1.1.6.0.20021126112257.02e32ab0@pop.net-yan.com>

Hi all folks,

I installed RH7.3 on a RAID-0 box which has following setup

(2 HDDs, each 40G)
Drive/partition
C   FAT16 200MB as boot section
D   FAT32 22G Win98/Win2000 dual boot machine
E   FAT32 48G For installation of RH7.3
F   FAT32 remainder For Win98/Win2000 data storage

At time of installation I selected automatic.  After installation I could 
not start the PC.  The screen hanged on ;
....
.......
GRUB

I booted up the PC with the rescue floppy and RH7.3 started.

on KDE console window
# fdisk -l

Disk /dev/hdc: 16 heads, 63 sectors, 77557 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 1008 * 512 bytes

Disk /dev/hdc doesn't contain a valid partition table

I suppose

hda = drive-C
hac = drive-D
hdg = drive-E (not CD-Writer)
hdh = drive-F (not CD-Rom)

Kindly advice how to rectify this mistake moving RH7.3 to hdg(drive-D) and 
create GRUB on hda(drive-C)

If impossible kindly advise how to uninstall RH7.3

Thanks in advance.

I don't think RedHat has put system headers in /usr/src/linux for a while 
now.  (Not sure if 6.2 did or not.)  They are in the proper place now, that 
being /usr/include/linux.  Maybe their warning has more to do with some 
stupid apps & libraries that look to /usr/src/linux for headers.

Agreed.  In RedHat 7.3 (and this started a little earlier) RedHat doesn't 
use /usr/src/linux for anything.  Instead you'll see 
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-17.7.x, so you would be safe to untar an official 
kernel tarball there.

It would be nice if RedHat released their kernel patches as a seperate 
rpm/s.  Maybe that's their "value add" and they expect you to just diff the 
source if you really want to know.

It worked that way in the V7 One True Shell.  Every Bourne-like shell

csh-like shells work that way.  I don't know what shell you're using
that doesn't work that way... maybe you're thinking of COMMAND.COM

Out of respect for the work that Linus has created, I ask

It's fine to say GCC and GNU Emacs.  But Linux is Linux.  The GNU
project had nothing to do with it, any more than Portland General had
to do with this message just because my computer is plugged in to the
wall, or Apple because I'm typing on a powerbook.

I met Linus recently.  He actually said the words "Randal, I will
have to kill you now" when I was joking around and said "GNU/Linux".
Given the amount of restraint he showed the rest of the week,
that statement was damning.

Please, out of respect for Linus, it's just "Linux".  Thank you.

  <http://www.componentsdirect.com/>

They are a little squirrelly with their product numbering.  For
example, they call their external version a 224000N also, even though
Seagate calls their external version a 624000N.  

Another thing, the unit I got was an "internal" with a 5.25-inch
bezel.  Even though Seagate sells different bezels and their own
literature tells you how to dismantle various things, the unit I got
came with warranty "dots" ("warranty void if broken") that connected
the mechanism body with the steel mounting rails it came with in such
a way as to preclude changing the bezel.  Since they were patently
absurd, I didn't hesitate to break them anyway to remove the mounting
rails.

Another curiosity is that the refurb is selling for the same prices as
new, which casts a little doubt on the newness.  I must say though,
our unit gave every appearance of mint condition.

When I bought our first 12/24gig DDS3 five years ago or so, it was
nearly $1k, so $229 seemed worth the risk.

And sorry, I don't have any information autoloaders.

I can't recommend this tool enough.  My main firewall has become quite the

firewall.  I cannot imagine trying to manage netfilter rulesets by hand, 
this thing is truly a life saver.  And it will gen up stuff for PIX

Uh, what is the "it" you are refering to?

I've always thought people should call it (BWIM: the conglomeration)
what they want to call it.  Saying that it is only proper to call it
"Linux" is just as bad as saying that it is only proper to call it
"GNU/Linux".

Besides, there more of us than Linus has bullets.  He can only shoot a
few of us!  ;-)

No guarantees, but I think Linus started using more descriptive names
for the root of the tarball a while back.  That could just be wishful
thinking on my part, however.  Also, it might only be a 2.5.x thing.

While it's true that all the patches are in a single src rpm, each patch is
in a separate file.  The patch filenames give a pretty good indication of
what is in each patch.  Diffing against a standard kernel shouldn't be
necessary.

It started in 2.4.x at x = 19.  It was in 2.5.x as early as x = 6
(that's as small an x as I've got archived locally).

Too bad we can't split our unit production between teams... I'm quite

If you install the src rpm, you should find the pristine tarball along 
with the patches in the redhat/SOURCES directory.  When you build, the
tarball gets untarred in the redhat/BUILD directory, then the patches
are applied to that tree.

Bullshit.  If not for GNU Compiler Collection, GNU Emacs, and all of the
GNU tools, there could be no Linux kernel.  Even if there was a Linux
kernel, what would you run with it if not for GNU?

So, when referring to the kernel, it's "Linux".  But when referring to
the entire system of kernel + userland software, it's "GNU/Linux",
pronounced "GNU over Linux".

Got it working.  What I needed was a non-crossover cable between my

Hmm,

$ rpm -q kernel-source
kernel-source-2.4.18-3
kernel-source-2.4.18-17.7.x

$ ls -l /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/
total 0

browsing kernel-source-2.4.18-18.7.x.i386.rpm
looks like everything gets dumped into /usr/src/linux-2.4.18-18.7.x

Confused,

I've actually never TRIED to do that -- I misunderstood how it works. 
Good to know that I can iterate over the results of a glob, and get file
names with spaces and stuff in them without needing special handling.

If I interpolate those into a string, THEN they'll get split, right?

Thought about that some after I wrote it... the word I should have
chosen, rather than "shines" is "Coruscates".  Debian is truely a
treasure trove!

Well, Debian's kernel-source package's kernel has a few patches applied
to it wrt Linus's upstream kernel.  Or, at least it did last time I
checked.  They are SUPPOSED to submit the patches back upstream when
that is appropriate.  The main one is the one that lets a "cramfs" image
serve as an initrd image.  Debian's "initrd-tools" rely on that feature!

The stock kernel-source package will generate a stock kernel-image.  If
you want EVMS, XFS, to build a special user mode linux, or to add IPSEC,
you must install a kernel-patch for it, run the patch, then rebuild your
kernel.

I purchased the book "GNU C++ for Linux," which
contains the code for the programs on a CD. It is to
be installed in a user account under "src" with a
subdirectory for each chapter.

I think I must have installed it as root. When I issue
a command such as the following

$g++ program.cpp -o program

I receive the message "permission denied," although it
will compile as root user. Can I change the
permissions on this directory so that the ordinary
user can compile programs? How would I do it?

Interesting - I hadn't ever noticed any kind of integral reliance upon
Emacs in any of the distributions I've used.  Maybe I missed something.

IIRC, Slackware recently dropped the GNU half.  At the end of its
install, it used to say something like 'Welcome to Slackware GNU/Linux'
... but IIRC Pat took that out.  I could be mistaken, though...  :-)

chown is the golden command.

# chown mike.user /this

Would, if I get it right, make the folder owned by "mike" of 
the group "user".

I'm not at a terminal now, but I'm sure you could type "man 
chown" and get the manull for the command.

What's giving you the permission denied?  Is it the creation of the new
file?  Can you write to the local directory?  Do you not have execute
permission on your compiler?

Could be a number of things, no?

Out of respect for the principles of the Free Software Foundation and the

Linux is a kernel.  I'm perfectly happy calling Linux "Linux".

But the operating system I run is GNU on top of a Linux kernel.

The kernel, maybe... but the operating system most of us run is more GNU
than Linux.

And isn't true that Linus intentionally modified the source of Linux to
run GNU software as written, without porting, because it was easier than
porting each piece of GNU software to Linux?

So Linus' opinion differs from mine and just about everyone else that
cares about the future of freedom and culture.  That's nothing new.

> Please, out of respect for Linus, it's just "Linux".  Thank you.

As a programmer, sure, props to the man who put in the effort and
(somewhat) manages the project.  As a human being, sure, I will defend his
rights as staunchly as any other person.

But I have absolutely no respect for Linus' lack of vision and social
consciousness.  I think that he is essentially short-sighted and selfish.  
I feel he turned his back on an opportunity to serve mankind by taking a
place as champion of Freedom.  Instead, he giggles and titles his book
"Just For Fun".  The man squandered perhaps a once-in-a-generation chance
at revolution.

Personally, I think there's still time and opportunity for him to redeem
himself, but he shows no sign of taking it... not from where I sit.

Specious argument.  If not for Intel and IBM and Andrew
Tannenbaum and Bell Labs and ... there could be no Linux
kernel either.  Everyone knows that everything has complex
connections and history.  "GNU/Linux" is primarily a PR
move, and a shrill insistence that GNU be in the name is as
annoying as the "Intel Inside" marketing campaign.  What's
the next target?  GNU/Mac-OS-X?

Out of respect to every reasonable person on this over-politicized rock, I ask 
that you stop going around in circles about it. We don't care. Really. The 
debate is about as meaningful as my decision to wake up 5 seconds later today 
was. Call it whatever you want. We're tired of the debate, it doesn't 
accomplish anything. Stow your egos and get on with life. We'd rather you go 
back to vi vs emacs, at least there's a tangible distinction.  The sky isn't 
going to fall because four arbitrary characters were added or subtracted from 
the also-arbitrary name of an operating system.

For all the "advancement" of human civilization, we still fight over what to 
call something that humans could survive just fine without. I feel like I'm 
back in kindergarten.

Subject: [PLUG] setuid best practice?
Message-ID: <20021126045707.Q32455@defiant.ncplus.net>

Howdy,

I need to run an equivalent of the following script as a non-root
user:
_________________________________________
#! /bin/bash

# pppDial written recently by Bruce Kingsland, with help from the list.

# This dials the fone using pppd with certain variables. The variables are
# set in the following while case, and can be in any order. The command is at
# the end, and the usage is shown here.

until [ $# -eq 0 ] ; do
  case $1
    in
      dial)
        pppd /dev/ttyS1 115200 :1.2.3.4 remotename ISP user USER connect \
	"/usr/sbin/chat -v '' AT OK ATM1 OK ATDT1234567890 CONNECT '\d\c'"
	shift
        ;;
      stop)
	killall pppd
	exit
        ;;
      *)
        echo Broken Code
	exit 77
        ;;
  esac
done
_________________________________________

The pppd part needs to be run as root. I need for a couple users to
be able to stop the pppd so that they can use the landline, and then
for them to be able to restart the pppd when they need back online.
But I don't need for them to know how to become root.

My think is that I "setuid pppDial", and then local users can run the
tool. Actually, remote users could run the stop version, but then
they'd be disconnected. By local users, I mean folks on other clients
on the inside network.

I'm aware of the security hole concerns of using setuid, which is the
primary reason for this posting; how do I do this properly? Are there
any gotcha's that I'm not aware of here? Any other things of valueable
interest?

TIA

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0211260650290.4688-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I have a bunch of pdf files created a few years ago from WordPerfect docs
-> postscript -> ps2pdf. I can view them with acroread (but the typeface
does not display well) but now with xpdf. They load in xpdf, but each page
is blank.

  Might there be a generic reason why a pdf file can be seen in one view but
not the other? Is this a function of the application's recognition of the
typeface used?

  Guess I need to take them apart and reassemble them.

Just shooting from the hip: I know that acroread ships with its own
resource fonts and type-rendering libraries. Perhaps that's the
difference.

You could always try running xpdf under strace to see if it's failing 
to find the fonts that it needs.

Paul,

  I suspected it was something to do with recognizing the fonts in the doc.
Guess that acroread can translate an unknown typeface to something it knows
while xpdf cannot.

  Good idea. Perhaps this evening. What I'm trying to do now is disassemble
a pdf so I can re-do it with a "standard" typeface (Palatino). Of course,
pdf2ascii, pdftotext and all the variants I have here are not working for me
this morning. pdfinfo works just fine but pdftotext produces garbage. Sigh.

Thanks very much,

Rich

Okay, I see why you are confused.  I should have been more explicit
when I said src rpm.  You need the src.rpm package, not the
kernel-source package.

kernel-2.4.18-18.7.x.src.rpm

BTW, in case you didn't know it, midnight commander (the mc command) 
understands rpm files.  You can use mc to explore an rpm without
having to install it.

A program that simply launches 10 threads that just malloc, wait 100
milliseconds, and free the data and then loop.  

This simple program segmentation faults. I'm using glibc version 2.2.2. I

Thoughts?

Probably.  You might need to set some define to make it threadsafe.  
Check... well, no, the malloc man page is from 1993.  That's not going to 
help.

Put mutexes around your calls to malloc.  See if that helps.  If not, maybe 
you're doing something you shouldn't in your threads?  Sharing a global 
variable by accident perhaps?

Thanks Kyle,

Yes. It works perfectly fine with mutexes but I'm not sharing anything other
than the memory allocated by malloc. I wanted to avoid mutex locking for
performance reasons. If malloc is already reentrant/thread safe, why should
I be doing extra locking?

Going through the dates in the patch, it looks like late September of 1993.

Ahh, yah!  Forgot that I don't usually pull down the source rpms from the 
mirrors.  All is clear now.

I use FileRunner and it too knows how to view rpms (rpm -qilp) as well as 
all sorts of tarballs.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.33.0211260928500.17330-100000@lukem.com>

I'm using Mozilla 1.1, Plugger, and the Outlook Web Access for my Linux
users to connect to an Exchange server.  I've modified /etc/pluggerrc to
use OpenOffice for opening MS Excel documents.  File attachments show up
as links.  If the attachment has spaces in the name, then I get errors
when clicking the link.

The OpenOffice splash screen pops up and then a dialog box says:

Error loading document file:///tmp/plugtmp/PHONE%20DIRECTORY-%20March.xls:
/tmp/plugtmp/PHONE DIRECTORY- March.xls does not exist.

/tmp/plugtmp has this file:

PHONE%20DIRECTORY-%20March.xls

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to handle spaces in URL
attachments with Plugger and/or OpenOffice?
Thanks,
~Matt

what's your sample program?  it looks like the malloc in
glibc 2.x should already cooperate with pthreads.  (it uses
pthread_atfork to set up the mutexes it needs.)

Indeed it is running, and running strong.

They're begining to get close to starting BOINC, essentially SETI at Home
II.  The framework of BIONC will be GPL'd, if I read things correctly,
better allowing others to write distributed clients similarly.

Matt,

  I get those space fillers in file names, URLs and everything else
Microsoft that someone's created with spaces in their names. I've tried to
teach them that not every one in the world runs Microsoft, and not even Mac
users can see the names the way they can. Most don't care.

  So, if you find a working solution (other than world domination by linux),
please let me know, too.

Thanks,

Rich

slow but it works. Now I don't have to disassemble it and put it back

Open Office handles filenames and URLs with spaces with no problem. It doesn't 
sound like an Open Office issue. Does it work with filenames with no spaces?

Actually...  I've had this problem myself with SO6 under Solaris.  I 
think it is a problem with Mozilla sending out the wrong filename.

Shouldn't /tmp/plugtmp have the file:

PHONE\ DIRECTORY-\ March.xls?  Since the %20's are a (what, URI?) 
web-based 'shortcut', and the filesystem isn't web-based.  ;)

Well, the file only exists while the error dialog box is up.  Once I click
OK, then the file vanishes.  But when the error box is up, the file in
/tmp/plugtmp has the %20's in it.  Odd...
Well, now that the Ximian Connector supports public folders, maybe I'll
switch my users back to Evolution.

  I guess that we need a lawyer of Bill Clinton's stature to teach us the

The thing is, she's got a point -- at least in the abstract. (In the 
particulars, the RIAA can go jump off a bridge, but in the 
abstract...)

Consider the following 'fact':

  "Paul showed up at the movie theater last month in his underwear."

The 'fact' is true (yes, I wear underwear when going to the theater), 
but the rhetorical force of the argument is hardly the truth. Why? 
Because the writer is trying to give the impression that Paul showed 
up at the theater "in nothing but his underwear."

The writer could deny that such was his intent -- but I think it'd
take a fairly naive person to accept his denial at face value.

IOW, it's quite easy to string nothing but true facts together in 
order to tell a lie.

Now, back to your normal off-topic PLUG posts...

Perhaps you should "apt-get source plugger" and fix it?  I bet it's a
simple fix.

If the file is not found under the first name it tries, the one with the
URL escaping, then run the URL unescape function on it, and try again. 
Any moderately competent C programmer should have no trouble getting it
to work in an hour or so.  Don't forget to submit your patch upstream
accompanied by a "ChangeLog" entry paste-in.  (Don't send a patch to

I wonder if -D_REENTRANT does anything for "malloc"?  My
"/usr/include/malloc.h" contains, near the top:

  $Id: malloc.h,v 1.22 2002/03/12 21:58:54 drepper Exp $
  `ptmalloc2', a malloc implementation for multiple threads without
  lock contention, by Wolfram Gloger <wg at malloc.de>.

  VERSION 2.7.0

It is owned by:
karlheg at bittersweet:~
% dpkg --search /usr/include/malloc.h 
libc6-dev: /usr/include/malloc.h
karlheg at bittersweet:~
% dpkg --status libc6-dev | grep '^Version:'
Version: 2.3.1-5

So, the first question is, what version of libc are you working with? 
(and on what distro, just out of curiosity?)

myself and do not have details about the compensation.  However client is
very serious about contracting some help soon.

A quick look at the NEWS file shows that at release 2.3:

* The malloc functions were completely rewritten by Wolfram Gloger based
  on Doug Lea's malloc-2.7.0.c.

I wonder if -D_REENTRANT does anything for "malloc"?  My
"/usr/include/malloc.h" contains, near the top:

  $Id: malloc.h,v 1.22 2002/03/12 21:58:54 drepper Exp $
  `ptmalloc2', a malloc implementation for multiple threads without
  lock contention, by Wolfram Gloger <wg at malloc.de>.

  VERSION 2.7.0

It is owned by:
karlheg at bittersweet:~
% dpkg --search /usr/include/malloc.h 
libc6-dev: /usr/include/malloc.h
karlheg at bittersweet:~
% dpkg --status libc6-dev | grep '^Version:'
Version: 2.3.1-5

So, the first question is, what version of libc are you working with? 
(and on what distro, just out of curiosity?)

Try the -D_REENTRANT trick others have mentioned.  It is possible that the 
ARM version does not support pthreads as well I suppose.  Not likely, but 
possible.

Can I play with and ARM too? :-)  I've thought the ARM architecture was 
amazingly nice when I got the first brochures in 1987...  Sigh.  I've 
never even been able to use a computer with an ARM.

Well, I managed to get a connection to the VPN server.
I used PoPToP, as recommended by another list person.

Now for the "but..." portion of this post:

I can connect, but it's not an encrypted VPN session - I'm working on that
part.
The second and REALLY the problem is that I connect, but I only have TCP/IP
to use. I can't do "net use K: \\server\share and have it create the share.
I believe it's a Netbios issue - Netbios isn't going over the wire.

I'm sure I need to give oodles more information to get a coherent answer,
but I'm just looking for someplace to start looking. I've done web searches
and it's not a subject that I've seen alot on. At least, nothing *very*
recent.

Thanks in advance!

Hello, pluggers!

First off, I was impressed with the turnout at the clinic. That was ver'
kewl to see that kind of response.

That said, I need help, dagnabbit!

I'm trying to set up VPN on our network. I've got Mandrake 9.0 for the
server and Win2k clients. I've also got FreeS/Wan on the server, and IPSEC
looks like it's up and running - ipsec verify returns everything hunky.

I have a Hawking firewall and it (supposedly) passes VPN traffic just fine.
I had VPN installed on our last server (NT4) and VPN worked just fine.

When I try to VPN locally from my machine, I get no answer (error 678).

Any tips/tricks/pointers/help on getting Win2k clients to VPN into a Linux
server?

Thanks in advance,

Maybe it's just not as important as you think it is... 

In 100 years, will it really matter. 

Probably not.

Cooper -

You might want to clarify that the presentation is in Room 08 of Hovland.
Its not a big building, but posting the room number or floor will help.

Btw, that's one VERY spiffy website for MVLUG.org! :)

Thanks,

Tyler

You bet. As Tyler pointed out, we are holding our meeting in Room 08 of
the Hovland building.

Thanks, Tyler! I hope you all enjoy using it as much as I have enjoyed
creating it. It's your site, really.

By the way, special thanks go to my wife, Kassetra Stevenson, for
creating page's ``mwvlug'' graphic design.

You need to look for something called MPPE, this is the native Micro$oft
encryption.  The corporate side of the VPN connection needs to
understand it as well, I had to patch the kernel on the linux box that I

If you can ping the WINS server, you should be able to browse the
network.  Try using the "Find Computer" tool instead of net use K: (and
specify the ip address of the computer you are trying to share files
with, not the NETBIOS name, you can use the name once your remote
machine has participated in a NETBIOS election or revelation or
obfuscation or whatever you want to call it.) 

Remember, that NETBIOS is not a service that updates its list of hosts
instantly, it can take up to half an hour.

that you are using to try to establish this connection, please specify
what OS is on each piece of equipment and where the private ip addresses
get translated to public ip addresses.

Thanks. I've already got MPPE working. I think ;) I am working with getting
certificates going and all that.
I'll look tonight at the "Find computer" - I forgot about that - thanks :)

Here's the setup:

Home (Win2k, SP2) <-> Cable modem <-> Internet <-> Firewall/DSL router/NAT
<-> Server (Linux 2.4.19, Mandrake 9.0)

Repeat the mantra: I will make it work... I will make it work...I will make
it work...

You need to look for something called MPPE, this is the native Micro$oft
encryption.  The corporate side of the VPN connection needs to
understand it as well, I had to patch the kernel on the linux box that I
set up for this.

I will give that a try. For the first go at it, I'm following the
instructions I finally found at:
http://ftp-mirror.internap.com/pub/redhat/8.0/

Earlier, I wrote:

I'm not sure why there seem to be conflicting instructions depending on
which documentation I read, but in appendix A of the Official Red Hat
Linux Customization Guide, there are instructions for determining
whether the kernel source is installed, and how to take a stock .config
file and modify just the parts you want to change. I've done that and
changed only the cpu type to K6. I want to see how that works.

Those instructions tell me to build the new kernel while in
/usr/src/linux-2.4/ and the process will take care of keeping this
version separate from the existing one by means of a line in Makefile
that says EXTRAVERSION = -14custom

I changed to the directory /usr/src/linux-2.4 and then ran:

make mrproper
cp configs/kernel-2.4.18-14 .config
make xconfig
  (the only change I made was to select K6 as the processor)
make dep
(edited Makefile and changed EXTRAVERSION = -14custom to EXTRAVERSION =
-14-021126)
make bzImage
make modules

As I type this, I'm still watching modules being made. The next thing
the documentation says to do is:

     Use the command make modules_install to install the kernel modules
     (even if you did not build any). Make sure that you type the
     underscore (_). This will install the kernel modules into the
     directory path /lib/modules/KERNELVERSION/kernel/drivers (where
     KERNELVERSION is the version specified in the Makefile). In the
     example it would be /lib/modules/2.4.18-7.95custom/kernel/drivers/.

No need for certificates, mppe just happens, it is an encryption scheme,
not an authentication scheme.  You should be able to tell by looking at
the properties of the connection from the Win2k Side.

Do you have a server designated as the WINS server?  Is the Linux server
the end point of the VPN, or the DSL router?

The setup I have, which allows more than one roadwarrior to connect to
the corporate LAN looks like this:

Road (Win2k)/VPN <------> Internet <------> Linux box/firewall/NAT/VPN

If the Roadwarrior is behind a firewall, that firewall needs to have GRE
protocol forwarded (which Microsoft's Internet Connection Sharing
appears to have by default).  This forwarding is the reason only one
Roadwarrior can connect through that firewall.  I can have lots
(hundreds, I think) of Roadwarriors connect to the Linux box.

Sounds like the mail server is down. Maybe there's an interruption in your 
internet connectivity.

Can you ping the server? Can you get telnet access to the box on port 25?

Those are the easy answers, anyway.

It already should be, sounds like.  You can run the debconf
configuration again by typing, as root:

dpkg-reconfigure -plow gdm

Next, type:

grep initdefault /etc/inittab

... to see what your default runlevel is, then run:

ls -l /etc/rcL.d

... where L is your default runlevel, and see that there's a S99gdm in
there pointing to ../init.d/gdm.

You can start or stop gdm by hand with:

/etc/init.d/gdm start
/etc/init.d/gdm stop

> Also I started gdm manually and it didn't execute the programs in my

Do you use Gnome, KDE, or the Debian XSession?  Use the "Session" menu
on GDM to select one.  I don't use an .xinitrc anymore, since I use the
Gnome session, and use "Settings | Session | Session Properties and
Startup Programs" to launch a few things.  The gnome-session session
manager will restart anything I had running last time I logged out. 
That's what it's for.

Those three work for me using mozilla 1.0.1.  I've seen/heard of sites that 
refuse to work with mozilla, but that doesn't seem to be the problem here.

Occasionally, when mozilla starts acting weird, I run `ps fax` and will 
often notice dozens of zombies spawned from mother mozilla.  Closing the app 
will zambonie the zombies.  Then launch mozilla again...all is well.

And that compiles, but does not run, it causes segmentation violations? 
When does it crash?

It would not build as shown; I had to add some #include directives. 
Attached is what I was able to compile and run.  It seems to work fine. 
You'll see comments showing it running; a "ps wwwauxf" excerpt.

I don't think it's Mozilla at all.  I think it's ECN (explicit
congestion notification).  Try this, as root:

echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn

... and see if it starts working.  If so, then either put that into a
startup script, or if you have "/etc/sysctl.conf" (Debian) then add:

net.ipv4.tcp_ecn = 0

... to it.  If you use some sort of firewall tool, like "fwbuilder", ECN
should be explictly set to OFF in there as well.

Apparently, ECN is fairly recent, and many firewalls drop packets with
that option set.

Have you enabled NetBIOS over TCP/IP?  Using DHCP, it defaults to the
DHCP server settings . . . which in my case has no setting for this
configured.

Resolved may be too strong a word when it comes to kernel compiling. I'm
sure that I have much more to learn. However, for now, I'm a happy
camper. I started the process at about 4:20 this afternoon and I
rebooted at about 9:30 this evening. The only thing I changed from a
stock configuration was to specify that I have a K6 processor. Now,
instead of having a sluggish response, I get nice, smooth tracking with
the mouse, and speedy web page loading, like I expected I should.
However, when applying an edge detect filter in the GIMP, my 400 Mhz
Celeron Thinkpad is still faster than this 550 Mhz K6. So, I assume that
there are more things to understand if I want to get everything I should
be able to out of this machine.

Thanks to all for the advice. Any further ideas on what options to tweak
will be appreciated.

Thus is probably my problem, I just recently installed the "shorewall"

-D_REENTRANT can only have some effect if one of the included headers
ifdef's on it.  The Debian Policy Manual mandates that all development
libraries must be built with -D_REENTRANT.

Evolution - no problem, one click update!  Shouldn't the timezone be

I just remembered that there is another difference between my Thinkpad
and my desktop machines: memory. The Thinkpad has 96 Mb and the desktop
has 64 Mb. I'll have to add some memory to the desktop and see what
happens. I'm guessing that the GIMP tends to use a lot of memory for
editing images, and that, combined with all the stock stuff in RH 8.0,
means that 64 Mb isn't enough. The sleeve from the RH 8.0 evaluation
CD's says that 64 Mb is the  minimum memory required for text-mode, the
minimum for graphics is 128 Mb, and the recommended for graphics is 192
Mb. I'll have to see just how much I can stuff into that odd
motherboard.

I thought about this, but I can't find a setting in the VPN connectoid. Is
that where it's set?
In the connectoid for the LAN connection, I do have an "Enable Netbios over
TCP/IP" option on the WINS tab under Advanced, and for the LAN connectoid,
it is set.

There ain't no such critter on the WINS tab for the VPN connectoid.

Have you enabled NetBIOS over TCP/IP?  Using DHCP, it defaults to the
DHCP server settings . . . which in my case has no setting for this
configured.

Ah. Well, I tried Find Computers last night - no go. I can ping the server
and I can browse the webpage on the server (it's just the Apache default
page right now).

The Linux box *is* the WINS server. If, by the "end point" of the VPN you
mean "which device has the IP address that you tell your connectoid to talk
to", that would be the router. The router then uses NAT to sent VPN to the
server.

See, this was all working just hunky dory with the Windows NT server. I'm
(fairly) certain that it's something I need to do on the Linux server to
make it all play nice. I'm not worried at the moment about having more than
one VPN connection, although I might have an issue later - depends on if we
open another office or if we get more people trying to work from home.

No need for certificates, mppe just happens, it is an encryption scheme,
not an authentication scheme.  You should be able to tell by looking at
the properties of the connection from the Win2k Side.

Do you have a server designated as the WINS server?  Is the Linux server
the end point of the VPN, or the DSL router?

The setup I have, which allows more than one roadwarrior to connect to
the corporate LAN looks like this:

Road (Win2k)/VPN <------> Internet <------> Linux box/firewall/NAT/VPN

If the Roadwarrior is behind a firewall, that firewall needs to have GRE
protocol forwarded (which Microsoft's Internet Connection Sharing
appears to have by default).  This forwarding is the reason only one
Roadwarrior can connect through that firewall.  I can have lots
(hundreds, I think) of Roadwarriors connect to the Linux box.

Thanks Karl,

Sorry for missing the header files, it was a cut-paste error. I have seen it
running without any problems for a longer time with 100msec sleep,
eventually it will seg fault but without the sleep it seg faults sooner both
times the seg fault is at either chunk_alloc or chunk_free (I have made the
sleep to one iteration of the for loop in the code below). Apparently it
works fine if I add mutex around malloc and free. 

I'm running a XScale Linux ( Kernel Version 2.4.7 ) distribution from
LynuxWorks (http://www.lynuxworks.com/products/bluecat/bluecat.php3) & glibc

And that compiles, but does not run, it causes segmentation violations? 
When does it crash?

It would not build as shown; I had to add some #include directives. 
Attached is what I was able to compile and run.  It seems to work fine. 
You'll see comments showing it running; a "ps wwwauxf" excerpt.

Here's the ldd output against the finished binary, running on ia32 (Dual

anything like that.  I do have a lot more difficulty with plugins, though.

Is it just me or have other Linux users found Web sites
that refuse connections with Linux machines?  I'm finding
several sites (soundblaster.com, toshiba.com, clausing.com)
that either refuse to connect or time out when accessing
from my Linux box, while my wife's Window's ME box connects
without delay.

I'm running Debian with mozilla-browser 1.1-1. My wife also
uses Mozilla 1.1.

I suspect many of us care, since many of us are using text only mail programs... Some of us even over an ssh connection to a machine not running X or in any way able to view images. 

I'd hate to have to start using Windows to view the PLUG mailing list. (That's sarcasm, Jeme, not whining.)

Subject: [PLUG] OpenOffice will not load
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0211270911260.9211-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  This problem started this morning. When I try to invoke OpenOffice I see a
message box telling me that it as committed an unforgivable sin and cannot
continue loading. When I press the "OK" button, the basic window shuts down.

  There are no zombie or other stuck processes for soffice.bin. I found a
couple, took care to them, and expected the application to work again. It
won't.

  Looking for the appropriate files, I discovered that there were two copies
of soffice.bin with different dates. One's in
/usr1/open-office/OpenOffice.org1.0/programs/ and the other's in
/usr/local/OpenOffice.org1.0/programs/. I copied the newer one (which was
also slightly larger) over the older, smaller one. Makes no difference.

  Has anyone any ideas I can try to get this working again?

TIA,

Rich

A lot of sites are so interested in getting all your personal info that if
the browser doesn't give it up immediately it just kinda times out.  Too
many cookies :P

And I'm sure the marketing department could give a rat's butt about
Non-windows people anyway.

This is odd.  I was on plug for quite some time.  But once classes started
this year I unsubscribed so I could make myself focus on school.

But appearntly I'm still on plug at microsharp.com.  Can anyone help me with
that?

Thanks,
Jason

GLibc 2.x should be threadsafe I think.  At least since 2.1. I think it is 
very likely that you have a different version from what Ulrich Drepper and 
his gang of merry hackers have.  

If your test program works fine with mutexes and will invariably crash 
without, then you definitely have a version of glibc that is not 
threadsafe.  That means that nearly everything else in it is going to be 
risky.  Even in a threadsafe glibc, there are some functions that are not 
threadsafe (strtok comes to mind).  However, malloc should not be one of 
them.

I'd contact LynuxWorks (if you've got support) and find out if they made a 
version with the threading disabled.  It is possible that they did for 
embedded work (to save on size? to save on speed? to make for more support 
calls?).

If you can get the package source for your version of glibc, you might be 
able to check the compilation flags and see if support for threading is 
off.  My faulty memory also says that there might be a #define in a header 
file that lets you know if _REENTRANT was turned on for glibc.  I'm not 
sure where you'd find this though.

If possible, you might want to see if you can build your own version of 
glibc for the ARM and see if that helps.  Building GLibc takes a couple of 
hours on my P-II 400.  I've probably got a lot more RAM than your systems 
do.  You might be able to build a cross compilation chain if LynuxWorks 
doesn't provide one.

Best,
Kyle

For this piece of scumbag spam, text conversion wouldn't have really helped to
"read" it; the "newsletter" looked like it was in French.  I wonder if its
sole purpose was to be annoying....

Hopefully the address used by that gang is now blacklisted.

I am using the same version of Mozilla on a Debian box, and all three
loaded just fine for me, seems like you might have a configuration
problem, not a rejected OS problem.

Good Luck

RFC 2445, written by D Sternerson of Microsoft and F Dawson of Lotus.

Actually a really good read, and icalendar support is not that hard to
add to things.

Looks like spamassassin on pdxlinux.org only tagged it with a score of 3.4. 

Since I have plug whitelisted, spamassassin doesn't process those messages.

Sounds like the VPN is working.  I'm also assuming that you can "find"
to the Linux box when you access it through the LAN.  In which case,
NETBIOS on the remote machine is most likely using a protocol other than
TCP/IP, like IPX or NETBEUI or...

Apparently for this to work, TCP/IP must be the only protocol "bound" to
NETBIOS, the easiest way to do that is to remove all other protocols. 
Remember, that the VPN connection is different from the Internet
connection, and the two can have different protocols.

The last thing I can think of is the subnet.  NETBIOS is supposed to be
routable, meaning that it is supposed to be a well behaved protocol and
follow the TCP/IP rules.  However, reality according to Redmond is very
different.  Make sure that the IP address of the remote side is in the
same subnet as the IP address of the server.

This doesn't read quite right.  When you use the VPN to connect to the
router, your remote machine should look like just another box on the
local network, with the IP address assigned by the router (or DHCP, if
the router is configured that way.)  So, I guess the big question is,
which box is controlling the IP address assignment of your VPN
connection.

My recommendation is to replace the router/firewall/NAT device with a
linux box that has a nice fresh 2.4 kernel with iptables enabled, PoPToP
(with mppe patch) and some firewall/NAT rules.  The documentation at
SourceForge is good enough to get things properly patched and configured
for reasonable security.

Hope some of this helps,

Derek Loree

Sounds like Explicit Congestion Notification (IP, RFC 2481).

Have a look at the option in the kernel Configure.help.

Add this line to /etc/sysctl.conf:

  net/ipv4/tcp_ecn=0

Or just "echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn"

So we can benefit from the experience of others who have already done
it. It may be that one distribution is significantly better than all
others for a particular platform.

...which we might have assumed had you said 'are there any distributions
which are significantly better on RS-6000 hardware than others?'

And then we could have had a fun little flame war.  :-)

But you asked which ones can install, not asking which is better than
the other.

So now we have to debate whether a question was worded correctly? No
wonder why some of the threads here go on forever. Can't you just give
people a break and either answer their questions without a hassle or
don't answer at all?

Subject: [PLUG] How is env initilized?
Message-ID: <1038425865.4997.157.camel@dereklinux>

Hi All,

I've got a puzzler that probably fits in the category of "Everybody
knows that, why do we need to document it?"

The opening scene:  I've been experimenting with backing up live
servers, essentially running tar (--except /proc) on a live server, with
all services running, and seeing if I can restore the tarball on a
different box.

Don't laugh; I have had it work on two different servers, better than I
was expecting!  Of course the third server I tried this on didn't work
as well as the first two.  The problems that occurred are not the kinds
of things I was expecting either.

The most annoying is the $PATH setting for the root user.  On the
original server, when logged into bash as root:

server:/home# echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11

The same command on the restored box, logged into bash as root:

server-test:/home# echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11

So, I'm confused about where the environment gets the values for its
variables, linux is supposed to be "file based", so there should be (a)
file(s) with this information in it (them).  What files contain the bash
environment?  (If you through the book at me, please include the
relevant sections.)  How can only part of PATH get lost?  It seems like
it aught to be an all or nothing kind of thing.

Another problem, I'm not sure if this is related or not, is that the
command /sbin/ifup isn't there after the restore; /sbin/ifdown and
/sbin/ifconfig are there, just no ifup.

I didn't have any of these problems on the first two servers, just the
third one.  BTW, I tried this several times, thinking that the tarball
got corrupted, with the same results.

TIA,

Derek Loree

I think IBM has a port of Red Hat that runs on it.
Can't say exactly which one. Read an article somewhere with a list of ports

Yes, and not 24 hours have gone by since I opened the list, thinking

I'll report that one to Razor.

Let's leave it open for a while anyhow, and see how it goes.  If there's
not too many like that, we can tolerate it.  I've learned how to edit
the archive (found the FAQ; have not made any edits), so we can trim out

I'm trying to determine that now. I don't think it's a pSeries
because it's an older machine but I really don't know. I'll
post another message here with the specifics as soon as I know.

It's documented in the INVOCATION section of the bash(1) man page.

The various distributions set up shell environments in subtly 
different ways, so a lot will depend on what distro you're using.

Plus, there's often a difference in environments between interactive 
and non-interactive shells, *and* between login and non-login shells. 
There's an obtuse truth table for figuring out which quadrant you're 
in. The bash man page will explain it better than I can.

In general, you'll want to start your investigation with /etc/profile.

It seems confusing to have two copies installed so you might want to get 
rid of the older version for simplicity's sake. Since "soffice" is a 
shell script, have you tried running "sh -xv soffice" to see if there's 
any thing funny going on. The script sets and tweaks some environment 
variables before exec'ing the "soffice.bin" file.

The people on this list have varying levels of technical expertise,
experience, and willingness to find their own answers. Some of us
don't need to be spoon fed answers. We're willing to do the research
on our own. When I posted my question "What distributions can install
on a RS-6000?", I expected that I'd get answers that told me which
distributions I should be researching. Someone might volunteer other
information. I would take it from there and spend time doing research.
I might come back with more detailed questions later.

It was a simple question - not a <difficult_question> - and the
answers could have been simple. Instead I was criticized for not
doing a Google search. Apparently, the person thought I was unwilling
to do any work to get the answer. In my experience, Google does not
provide ALL the answers. There could be a RS-6000 Linux distribution
out there that I might not find in a Google search.

When I tell people, such as my students, that the PLUG list is a
resource for them, I caution them that they sometimes have to pay
the price for this free support. Being hassled because of faulty
assumptions is one such price.

Tony,

  I haven't tried that, but I will. I looked through the shell script but
saw nothing that made sense to me. I knew strace wouldn't help me here.

This was productive, to an extent.  I'm running Debian-Woody on all
three servers, and the /etc/profile contains:

# /etc/profile: system-wide .profile file for the Bourne shell (sh(1))
# and Bourne compatible shells (bash(1), ksh(1), ash(1), ...).

PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/games"                                                                                                                        
if [ "$BASH" ]; then 
  PS1='\u@\h:\w\$ ' 
else  
  if [ "`id -u`" -eq 0 ]; then  
    PS1='# '    
  else  
    PS1='$ '    
  fi   
fi   

export PATH PS1  

umask 022 
(EOF)

Which explains where the user path comes from, it is hardwired, for lack
of a better word.  I don't understand the embedded if statements
though.  How can the prompt string be used to modify the PATH (which it
obviously is, why else would the export statement be there)? 

When I issue the command "echo $PS1", I get the the following:

\u@\h:\w\$

Not as confused, but still looking like it.

Well, even spamassassin isn't 100%. :)

It catches most of the spam directed at me. About 95% or better of the spam that my system actually accepts, gets tagged as spam. Thankfully, I have some measures in place that tell my mail server not to allow connections from several thousand machines on the 'net.

Marvin,

  Do what us simple folks did in the Old Days: put an answering machine on
your line. Then, when you're using it for a connection to the 'Net folks
calling you will receive a busy signal and will call back later. When you're
not there, the answering machine catches the calls for you.

This is probably a function of your modem. It doesn't hear the dial tone, and fails. 

You'll have to turn off the wait for dialtone feature of your modem. Most likely, this is at&m# where # is a number between 0 and 9. It's been a while, so I may be wrong as far as the at code...

I have an HP 9000 712/60 machine that does not have a CD-ROM drive
or a floppy drive.  I would like to install Debian Woody but can't
without a floppy or cdrom.  I can't seem to find any information on
the web that states whether this machine can take a PC style floppy
drive.  Does anyone know?  Moreover, it has an external SCSI II port
on the back but I have read that it only accepts a minimal set of
external cdrom drives do to buffer size differences.  Is there another 
method that I could use to get Linux on this thing such as somehow 
remotely install the distro?  Doesn't seem possible without a floppy
drive at least.  I know it is an old machine but I just want to put 
it to good use :)

The PS1 variable has nothing to do with PATH. If you type 'help 
export' from a bash prompt, you'll see that you can export multiple 
variables into the environment with one command.

In this case, /etc/profile is exporting PATH and PS1 at the same time;
that's all there is to it. There's no secret (or even unsecret)  
relation between the two variables.

The tokens available for the bash prompt are listed in the PROMPTING 
section of the bash man page. In this case, you've got

              \u     the username of the current user
              \h     the hostname up to the first `.'
              \w     the current working directory

No floppy or CD-ROM?  Bummer.

Could you possibly pull the hard drive out of the sucker and put it in
another machine for installation purposes?

Isn't that a PA-RISC workstation? I wasn't aware there was a linux
version than ran PA-RISC. You may need a version of HP-UX.

Yeah I am half-way tempted to pick up another which does have a cdrom and
floppy...
Seems crazy that these machines were sold without them.

Are you saying that when you have voice mail, and pick up the phone to make 
a call, you hear a "da da da da" before you get a dialtone?

Russ's answer might work, but I'm not sure if the central office is would 
notice the modem's dialing tones before it has presented you with a real 
dialtone.  Maybe put a delay in your dialing prefix string that is longer 
than the notification tones (da da).  You should be able to use a few commas 
each of which IIRC represents 3 seconds.

Apparently, a network install is possible. It works the same way as a
typical Debian network install apparently. I am no Debian expert, so I
will defer to one of them for more info.

I noticed that too but it still seems as though you need the Debian
boot disk.  So I am back to my first issue...I wonder if a pc floppy
drive will work on these bad boys...I guess I should try and see
(not like I would be out much if I somehow destroy the thing)

This is odd.  I was on plug for quite some time.  But once classes started
this year I unsubscribed so I could make myself focus on school.

But appearntly I'm still on plug at microsharp.com.  Can anyone help me with
that?

Thanks,
Jason

  A comma was always a half-second delay. But, you can string together as
many as you want. I used to have 5 or 6 in the modem dial string when I was
dialing out of a hotel room and had to wait for an outside dialtone after
dialing '9'.

Happy Thanksgiving all (in the US),

My Spamassassin config caught it.  Admittedly, I have it cranked up a
bit more than the defaults...

Here's the content analysis on that "Newsletter" message:

>SPAM: Content analysis details:   (7 hits, 4 required)
>SPAM: FROM_HAS_MIXED_NUMS (-1.5 points) From: contains numbers mixed in
with letters

That rule is because of my sneakemail forwarding-- originally I
whitelisted anything from my sneakemail but thanks mostly to some of the
other mailing lists I'm on I had to stop this.  Believe me, PLUG is one of
the more well-behaved lists from a spam standpoint.

>SPAM: INVALID_DATE       (0.5 points)  Invalid Date: header (not RFC 822)

>SPAM: CTYPE_JUST_HTML    (4.3 points)  HTML-only mail, with no text

That last one is my "big gun" to slap down the HTML-only mailers.  Unless
the mail has other redeeming qualities it's going to get filtered.

Here's the line from my spamassassin user_prefs:

score CTYPE_JUST_HTML 4.3

  -- Steve

PS: My preference would be to keep the list closed.

Tony,

  The script ran quickly along until this line:

+ exec /usr1/open-office/OpenOffice.org1.0/program/soffice.bin '' '' '' ''
'' '' '' '' ''

  Then the splash screen came up, the outer window opened and the message
box appeared. When I clicked "OK", the window closed and the script showed:

Aborted

  So, I see nothing that tells me what the problem might be. This is very
strange, but ... perhaps it's time for a re-installation of OO.

Thanks,

Rich

Yes, the switching equipment will understand the DTMF sent prior to the stutter tone stoping. 

At least, I never had a problem with that when I was running that configuration.

I have some old HP9000's in my lab that take a regular, external, SCSI cdrom. I think it's a standard Toshiba drive, and the housing is pretty generic. 

I run HP-UX on these boxes, but I've reinstalled with that external CDROM several times, without error.

Yes, there seem to be differences between what xpdf and acroread can
handle.  Generally, I use acroread.  (Yes, it is proprietary, but it
works.)  Well, it sort of works.  As I recall, acroread (and WordPerfect)
will not work if X is configured for 24 bit graphics.  I have to have
X configured for 16 or 32 bits, but not 24.  Of course, maybe this has
been changed.  I haven't tested this recently.

If so great.
Unfortunately, I can not make it as I have a LinuxFund meeting in

Cooper and all,

    (1)  Good site.  I like it.

    (2)  Regarding the old site at lug.peak.org

         -  Is there information on this site that needs to be moved to
            the new site?

         -  Moving a site is a pain.
            I assume that lots and lots of people link to lug.peak.org.
            Thus, you should keep this site as long as possible and link
            or redirect people to the new site.
            (Along these lines, I still have people trying to find me
            at my transport.com address and I haven't had anything there
            in several years.)

    (3)  Interestingly the old site links to our failed conference attempt
         at www.LinuxNorthWest.org
         We gave up this domain and it was picked up by someone in the
         Tacoma area.  It is now being used for a conference planned
         for Bellingham, Washington.  I intend to talk to them one of
         these days to see if we help them in anyway.


                                          Sincerely,

Dave,

  The workstations here have always been configured for 32 bpp. The problem
might have been font related and was fixed by my upgrading xpdf to the
latest and greatest.

After installing Mozilla 1.2 on my RedHat 7.1 workstation at work,
someone mentioned installing it on RedHat 8 with "Xft." I didn't know
what that was, but I just installed it on my home workstation, which is
RedHat 8, and it is cool! It's really nice fonts now.

Anyway, bravo to Mozilla for making a great-looking browser, and to
RedHat for making a more more appealing desktop (Bluecurve). I just
started using Linux a year ago, but jumped in with both feet, using it
exclusively at home and at work. I quickly fell in love with it, but
felt the general "ugliness" of the desktop and browser was a drawback.
Improvements like this I think are another step toward Linux on the
mainstream desktop.

Is anybody using LCD flat panel monitors with their Red Hat linux
boxes?  What can I expect from kudzu and Red Hat, if I switch from the
crt to a flat panel?  Will I have to reconfigure xf86 config file or
will kudzu handle it?

Happy holidays,

AFAIK, Kudzu does NOT deal with monitor settings at all.  That is the
domain of the X Window System configuration tools.  Before you shut down
to install the LCD panels, you should configure the machines so that X
will not start when it boots.  Halt, install the panels, reboot, and
then reconfigure X using the same tools you used the first time.

While I don't have an lcd panel, my laptop does.  The panel should act like 
any modern svga crt and tell the os (via kudzu) it's capabilities.  I 
suspect that kudzu will handle it gracefully if you are happy to keep (and 
the new panel can provide) the previous resolution.

Can't recall if kudzu will bring up monitor configuration or not.  If not, 
it should still work, then you can use the right tool (which seems to change 
names with every release).

That's all to say, there's nothing special about lcd panels AFA the os is 
concerned.  The video drivers shouldn't even care unless it's a hdtv.

Just out of curiosity, can anyone tell me what is the latest release
version of Kudzu, and is it available anywhere via CVS, offhand?

Probably I should just google for it...

Yes, there's quite a bit of content there. I will spend some of the
holiday weekend moving that information to the new site; there's some
valuable stuff there that I feel needs to be kept. 

I have begun this process with the ``past meetings'' link. I intend to
give the sight a seemless look with both the old and new information.

There are other things I wish to do, such as a beginner level FAQ,
screenshots, and more links pointing to poplular Linux sights.

That reminds me. If you guys have an article or piece you'd like to
share, just click the ``submit story'' button; I'll likely post it.

No doubt. I'm learning this the hard way. I may automate this. :-)

This is a really good point. I hope to chat with John briefly after the
meeting about this if he can make it.

Put a packet sniffer in front transport.com's router. That way you can
redirect traffic intended for you ;-).

Well, it looks like the latest version of "Kudzu" performs a DDC monitor
probe.  So, with a relatively modern video card and monitor, Kudzu will
go and get that information.  The question that remains is:  Do the Red
Hat boot scripts, when a new monitor is detected, automaticly
reconfigure the local X Server(s)?  Or, must that be done manually?

On Debian, the "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86" command will execute
the "/var/lib/dpkg/info/xserver-xfree86.config" script under debconf. 
That script uses "read-edid | parse-edid" to get the similar information
that Kudzu is gathering.  It actually uses the same peice of source
code, internally.  That is, both Kudzu and read-edid use code that came
from the same source, originally.  This reconfiguration, on Debian, does
not happen automatically.  You must run it by hand.

Any DVD player that works in any distribution of Linux should work in
RedHat 8.0... and any DVD player that works in RH 8.0 should work in any
other (up to date) distribution of Linux...

That said, I really like Ogle.  It plays CSS encrypted DVDs and those
without region settings.

Xine also plays DVDs, but to get it to play the encrypted DVDs, you have
to mess around a bit - I didn't have any success with it.

A good friend of mine was playing with VideoLAN the other day and said
he *really* liked it... play your DVDs out over your LAN, or view them
locally... it's a cool idea, but one I haven't played with (yet... I'm
finishing up my jabber server first!)  :-)

Will soon be doing a custom install of Red Hat 7.3.  I've always used Gnome
in the past, but this time would like to have KDE available to see what it
is like.

Will the two desktop environments coexsist peacefully?  If so, how do you
switch between the default desktop and the alternative?

Ok, so this might sound kinda funny, but my father has finally gotten
upset enough with windows that he wants me to show him linux, this is a
great thing in my mind, even though he doesn't often call for tech
support.

Anyways, the problem is, A) he has a winmodem, but the good news is it's a
fully working linmodem, so, this can be gotten around, B) All I have is a
gentoo 1.2 CD, nothing to use to show him what he would be getting into,
so I thought AhHa, Perfect use for Knoppix, if it has linmodem drivers. 
Sadly, I can't find out if it does or not.  If anybody knows, or anybody
can help me I would greatly apriciate it.

If worst comes to worst I could probably ssh into my box, download
knoppix, mount it loop back and check to see, but I'm hoping somebody else
knows something before I start delving into it.

Thank you
Chris

Yes. I install both in my standard configuration at work and have 
never had a problem.

The switchdesk utility should be able to handle it for you. Try the 
switchdesk(1) man page for info.


One note. I myself run Xfce, but occasionally make use of GNOME or KDE 
apps. (Xfce will automatically build GNOME and KDE app lists for its 
popup menus. Very sweet. Uh, but where was I? Oh, ...)

I really like a number of the KDE apps, but they're tied pretty
tightly into the KDE messaging system, DCOP. If you're running the KDE
desktop, DCOP is already running, but if you're running GNOME or
something else, it isn't. So if you're running GNOME and you start up,
say, kghostview and then run ps, you'll see a half-dozen of 'kdeinit'
entries. They'll go away shortly after you quit kghostview.

Both ogle

are good dvd players,
but in both, the synchronization is off. Has anybody

This happened to me as well just recently.  I played around with this for 
about three days before I finally ripped OpenOffice off my box.  Fortunately, 
I did not have a large number of documents saved in OpenOffice format.  I 
tried reinstalling, downloading the latest and greatest, completely 
UN-installing then installing in different directories...nothing worked.  
OpenOffice worked great for while and then just went kaput.  It would be 
really nice to know what "unforgivable sin" was committed, but for now, I 
have returned to other office type applications (KOffice).

  I also posted a request for help on the OO mail list. One fellow came back
with the suggestion that -- as root -- I re-run 'setup -net' and select the
'repair' option. (Aside: with OO installed, running setup provides three
choices: modify, repair and uninstall.) I did this but it made no
difference. So, I'm waiting to read something more from the developers and
folks who know the application better.

  This is a very strange situation and one that I've not seen before. Your
experience is equally strange. I'm not sufficiently guru to be able to
understand what could possibly be preventing the application from loading
after it worked for a few months. If nothing shows up in the process list,
and a 'repair' has been run, I wouldn't even know where to start looking for
a reason. Even for computers, this is totally illogical and irrational.

  But, when I get it figured out I'll post the solution here. As AbiWord
doesn't (yet) have the typefaces I need available, my business word
processing has been moved from WordPerfect to OpenOffice Writer. I'm sure
that the developers will focus on this problem since it's not just me and is
certainly a critical error.

Thanks,

Rich

I noticed the audio being out of sync with the video with MPlayers, but
not with Ogle....

What sound system are you using?  I'm using ALSA... but compiled Ogle
before I switched to ALSA, so it was using OSS emulation.  The sound was
getting quite far out of sync set up like that... I recompiled ogle with
ALSA support and haven't had a problem with the sound being out of sync
since.

Could you be looking at a similar situation?  Perhaps you switched to
ALSA, but then apt-get'd or rpm -Uvh'd (I think that's right, isn't it?)
a precompiled ogle package?

If so, I'd remove the prebuild binaries and build it from source...  :-)

I wonder if using "strace" and tracing all of the system calls would

OK, not so strange. I just don't know why I get the following errors
in the term window that I launch konqueror from on my twm desktop;

DCOPServer up and running.
trying to create local folder: File exists
trying to create local folder: File exists

The lines up to and including 'trying....' all happen as the browser
is opening. The rest all happen as the browser is 'quit'ing. I'd build
the folder tree it is trying to make, or just remove the file that is
causing the errors, but I don't know what it is trying to do, and I'm
having difficulty figgering out where to discover those details.

Any ideas?
TIA!

Doesn't work if you're never offline when non-programmers are likely
to try to call. After awhile, they get tired of always getting a
busy signal, and never call.

You are not connecting when you have voice mail because of the beeping
dial tone you get when you pick up the phone. 

The solution is to place a couple of delay strings in the chat script as
follows:

M is speaker control. 0=off, 1=on until carrier, 2=on, 3=on for dial
only.

X is call progress result codes. should be set to 0 to ignore buzy/no
dialtone (that should be the factory setting). I have a Multi-Tech
modem, and it has some extended features that may not be in your
modem; so I'm only listing the standard AT commands here.

S6 defines how long the modem should wait for dialtone before
aborting. Default is 2 seconds.

S8 defins how long a  'comma' delays the dialing. Default is 2 seconds.

S11 defines spacing between dialed digits. Default is 70, Recommended
minimum is 50; I use 55.

I have stutter tone on my modem too, from time to time, and my ppp Dial
script works fine inspite of it (ie, without any commas). 

What modem. Have you studied the modem manual for vendor specific
codes?

Message-ID: <20021128131118.28a99bd6.paul@pflnet.ws>

It's been a while since I set up a server from scratch. Now I know why I'm doing it -- I forgot how. The OS is RedHat 8.0 from the Bible book. I've got imap, pop3 and Apache going by ...

chkconfig iptables off
chkconfig imap on
chkconfig ipop3 on
chkconfig httpd on

When I send mail to the box, I get a connection refused message.

telnet inet2 110 -- I have a conversation with the pop3 server
telnet inet2 25  -- Connection refused.

ps -ef|grep sendmail says ...

root       569     1  0 09:27 ?        00:00:00 
sendmail: accepting connections

smmsp      579     1  0 09:27 ?        00:00:00 
sendmail: Queue runner at 01:00:00

Should I start troubleshooting the firewall or Sendmail?

Regards,
Paul

Start by troubleshooting sendmail.

In your sendmail.cf file (Yes, I still edit the cf file and not the mc 
file.  No flames please. ;) look for:

O DaemonPortOptions=Port=smtp,Addr=127.0.0.1, Name=MTA

This line tells sendmail to _only_ accept SMTP connections from localhost.  
I change mine to read:

O DaemonPortOptions=Port=smtp,Addr=0.0.0.0, Name=MTA

This allows connections from any IP.  Before anyone starts asking about 
opening myself up to be used as an open relay, I control that throug the 
access file.

Make the appropriate change in the cf (or the mc) file, HUP sendmail and 
try connecting again.  This _should_ resolve the issue.

Regards,

Chesley

Actually, when I think about it, adding a delay there won't work. It's still picking up the line, and listening for a dialtone, during the pause. When it doesn't get a dialtone, or one it understands anyway, it aborts. 

I found the following page (google search) http://members.tripod.com/michaelgellis/modem.html.

On it, it looks like you need to change the string to ATX0DT3603144221

This WAS the ticket! The relay was refused. I edited /etc/mail/access and was good to go. THANKS!

Regards,
Paul

PS: That WAS in the book buried in other strange configs on page 749. It does say the 127.0.0.1 will restrict the use of port 25 to the localhost, it doesn't say to replace it with 0.0.0.0.

Tony,

  I wondered the same thing. I thought that it might not since the
exectuable is called from within a shell script, but it would be worth a
trial to find out.

Message-ID: <1038523731.11009.10.camel@duron.stpaultel.com>

Hey everybody-

I'm in a bit of a bind with gcc versions.

I'm trying to compile the ICQv7 transport for my Jabber server.

It says it will compile with gcc 2.95.3, but seg faults a lot... it is
all C++.  It requires gcc 2.95.4 or better, but less than 3.2.

The server my jabber server is on is running gcc 2.95.3.

I'm running gcc 3.2 on my system sitting here.

So, sibn in #orlug suggested compiling gcc 2.95.4 and putting it in my
home directory, then modify cc accordingly... 

But there aren't any gcc 2.95.4 sources anywhere!

Debian seems to have used it for a while, and I know RedHat used it for
a while, but Slackware stuck with the official 2.95.3.

So......... does anybody either:  have gcc 2.95.4 running on a system
with libsigc++ version 1.0.0 or above and glibc 2.2.5 who wouldn't mind
compiling a few things for me... or happen to know where I can grab the
source for 2.95.4?  I can't use an srpm or source deb file - I need the
actual tarball (or a bzball).  I'm running slackware 8.1 on the server.

I'm really stuck... any ideas would be appreciated.  :-)

The README file says "gcc-3 recommended". It ought to work with 3.2. 
Esspecially if it works with 3.1, as 3.2 is, mostly, just an ABI change.

Yep... it *should* work with 3.2, but that readme was written before 3.2
was close to release.

There's a patch available that is supposed to fix a few problems it has
with gcc 3.2, but it broke many things for me... my guess is that patch
was for something in CVS or the stable release - it didn't really say.

But, even if I did build it with 3.2, odds are it wouldn't work for my
gcc 2.95.3-compiled jabber server - due to the ABI change, binaries
created with GCC 3.2 are generally incompatable with binaries created by
2.95.

This whole thing is a little nuts... lol...  :-)

Well, if Debian is using 2.95.4, they also have the source.  Debian
source files come in three peices.  There's an .orig.tar.gz, a .dsc, and
often a .diff.gz file.  All three are needed to create a Debian package
from that source.  The .orig.tar.gz is the upstream source.  The
.diff.gz contains a "diff -u" between the upstream and the Debian
version.  The .dsc is a "debian source control" file, used by
"dpkg-source" to verify and patch the source, in preparation for
building it.  There is also a newer source format, where the patches and
upstream tarfiles are contained in the .orig.tar.gz, and there is not a
.diff.gz.  In either case, you don't need special tools to get the
upstream source code out of the package.

Both gcc 3.2 and 2.95.4 are installed on drizzle.pdxlinux.org.  You can
"apt-get source jabber" there also, and see what the Debian maintainer
did to get it to compile.

Do you have an account on drizzle?  If not, email me your username, full
name, daytime telephone number, and ssh protocol 2 public key
(id_dsa.pub).  I'll create an account for you then.  It's not a super
fast box, but you CAN build software there.

Google led me to these pages:

http://www.voxtechnologies.com/niu1600a.htm
While I didn't find your model number, the series seems to be related to
terminal servers.


http://www-mice.cs.ucl.ac.uk/multimedia/misc/tcp_ip/8811.mm.www/0034.html
If you understand what these guys are talking about, it might give you a
hint. I'm guessing (since I don't really understand everything they're
talking about) that it is also referring to some kind of terminal
serving function.

(Enjoying some otherwise spare moments after the day of feasting.
Nothing better to do, so why not google? Happy Thanksgiving, all.)

Ok, looks like that might be the way for me to at least get myself a
tarball to work with... where would I find the said tarball?  :-)

I have jabber compiled - no sweat... what I'm trying to get compiled is
a no-longer-maintained jabber transport to icq.

Jabber is way super cool - if you've never played with it, I'd suggest
grabbing it and playing with it.  All your IM accounts (Yahoo, AIM, ICQ,
MSN, even IRC) under one login.....

I do indeed have an account... and am compiling at the moment.  It's
definitely harder to get something like this working when you don't have
root access... lol... I needed libsigc++ for libicq2000, and man... what
a bear to get it living nicely in my home directory!

I did finally force that in to working and got libicq stuff compiled,
now I'm putting jabber in my home directory, then I'll fight the icqv7
transport - which is the final thing I need.  I just hope I don't run in
to too many library problems between Debian and Slackware.  What glibc
version is Drizzle under?

Anyway... it's going... thanks for providing it for stuff like this. 
:-)

Just use the -f option to strace, and it will trace any process that
is forked from the one you start with.  Also, redirect output to a
file with a -o /tmp/foo.strace so that you can review it afterward.

It's installed on drizzle now, but not running.  I also installed the
"jabber-dev" package, so you should be able to build the transports for
use on drizzle, provided all dependancies are met.

Let me see if those are available on Debian...  Got them.  I'll install
them right after I fix Exim so that it does not scan each and every copy
of mail from the lists.

You can run the "aptitude" interface as a non-root user.  Use it to
locate things you need, then email me or /msg karlheg on IRC in #orlug
to get them installed.

Find out with:

% dpkg --status libc6

... or just:

% ldd $(which ls)

... then follow the symlinks with "ls -l".

Since the "soffice" script exec's "soffice.bin" I think it should work 
since an exec call overlays the current executable with the new one. I 
tried it and it appeared to work although I didn't examine everything 
in great deal. "strace" kept spitting out data until I exited out of 
the associated OO window.

I installed it with Mozilla.  You must first have a working Java VM, and
browser plugin.  Then, you can just let Mozilla install the flashplayer,

Stephen,

The kernel is looking for init, wich is located on your root partition.
Check your root partitions for integrity, your /etc/lilo.conf (if you
are using lilo), your /boot/grub/grub.conf file (if you are using grub)
and your /etc/fstab to ensure that the root directory is defined
correctly. 

The overal picture is that the kernel is looking for the init daemon,
who's binary is located on the sytem's / directory (/sbin/init).

Posting /etc/lilo.conf, /boot/grub/grub.conf, /etc/lilo.conf, and the
output of the `fdisk -l > fdisk.txt' command would be helpful. You will
have to mount your root partition from rescue CD for some of these.

Right click the clipboard in the bank of icons beside the clock on the 
taskbar. There's an item in the menu that says "Actions Enabled". Click it to 
disable.

This is perhaps the single most annoying "feature" I have ever seen in a 
desktop environment.

Basically what I did to get the GCC sources.... for future reference, it
appears GCC "2.95.4" is just a CVS snapshot RedHat, Debian, and Mandrake
used a lot and called "2.95.4"... 20011006.

Are you interested in getting it running?  Since it'll all run as a
regular user I can hack my jabber.xml file to work under 'normal'
situations again... right now I have mine all set to authenticate via
POP3 (so it uses the existing authentication setup) and keep adding
transports.....

Did you get it so it stopped scanning the email?

It's 2.3.1.... and I'm running 2.2.5... the binaries didn't play nicely
together.  After I was able to apt-get the tarball for GCC "2.95.4" I
scp'd it home (to Slackware), built it, and comopiled the plugin - no
sweat.  :-)

What a pain it is when devs don't support 2.95.3!  :-)

Sure.  I don't know how to get jabber to work.  It's running, and it
runs as "daemon", but I can't seem to connect to it with Gabber at all. 
Will you look at the configuration (on drizzle) and see what's the
matter with it, if you have time?

  OK. Looking in /etc/X11/XF86Config-4, I find that there's a 3D Labs
Permedia 2 board installed. (AGP? I don't know, but the retailers will).
Anyway, a google search on this product revealed this insight:

"Permedia 2 On Linux

    "This document outlines the steps I took to get a 3DLabs Permedia 2 card
to work with a Redhat Linux 7.1 install. This basically entails downgrading
to XFree86 3.3.6. Another machine in the lab next door had to do the same to
get a Permedia 2 to work.

"Situation notes:

    "* The machine was previously working with Redhat 6.2, XFree86 3.3.6. It
was recently hacked, at which point Redhat 7.1 was installed, part of which
entails installing XFree86 4.0.3
    "* The X configuration process seemed to go well, and the machine ran at
full resolution and such. However, little white lines would appear whenever
scrolling or moving windows. More importantly, xscreensaver and xlock would
crash if left on for a time. The machine could still be telnetted into, but
the console would be rendered useless with an image stuck on the screen and
an inability to switch to a virtual console. The only solution was to
reboot, killing X had no affect. It's unclear if any application would have
also crashed.
    "* In an attempt to fix the problem, the machine was upgraded to XFree86
4.1.0. This was highly unstable---the machine would frequently completely
lock up to the point that it couldn't be telnetted into or pinged.
    "* A machine in another lab had experienced similar problems which were
only resolved by going to 3.3.6 so the same was done to this machine. This
seems to have fixed the problem."

  And when did my problems show up? Right after upgrading from RH 6.2 to
7.3. Another "Aha!" moment has occurred. So, I go buy a replacement for the
Permedia 2 and we should be OK.

  Remember my thread about the root window being visually trashed on one of
the workstations? Well, I've decided the time has come to buy a replacement
video card. Before I do so, I'd like to identify what's there (without
taking it apart, of course).

  Running /bin/dmesg I see this:

Linux agpgart interface v0.99 (c) Jeff Hartmann
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 28M
agpgart: Detected Intel 440BX chipset
agpgart: AGP aperture is 64M @ 0xf8000000

  But, this does not tell me that I have an AGP card installed. I looked
through other /proc files without seeing anything I could identify as a
video card brand, model or amount of vram on board.

  I'd appreciate a pointer to learn where this information is to be found. I
know that XFree86-config has a screen section; is that the only place?

TIA,

Rich

If RedHat compiled Galeon with GCC 3.2, you need to have a 'fake'
library in place to use plugins compiled with GCC 2.95... except for
Java, the only way to use that right now is to compile it yourself
(which I hear is a real bear!).

If your symptoms are different, than ignore the rest of the post... but
when I had Galeon compiled with GCC 3.2 (under Slackware 9.0 - an early
beta) it just went *poof* every time I visited a flash site (after
installing the plugin).

What needs to be done is you need to modify the following post (I got it
from alt.os.linux.slackware) to fit Galeon, then just put it in place. 
LD_PRELOAD the library up near the top of the galeon script, if you want
to.  Or right before galeon-bin is called.

Move the resulting libc++mem.so to the location where run-mozilla.sh

mv libc++mem.so /opt/mozilla

Open run-mozilla.sh and just below line 351 enter
export LD_PRELOAD=$MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME/libc++mem.so

I put the resulting libc++mem.so elsewhere, but it makes little

would like to use that version of KDE.

There is no binary available for Caldera. I often
install Red Hat RPM's, but would I be safe in assuming
that the binary for RH KDE would work on Caldera?

If not, is it difficult to compile and install KDE3

In any case, suggestions would be welcome.

Last week I had some trouble updating KDE packages in order to fix a

but I could not find the packages in RH rawhide that I needed to install
in order to correct the dependency issues.  The deficient dependencies
were from older packages of KDE base and KDE libs, I believe.  They
were, most likely, from KDE that was released prior to the RH 8 release.

I guess that I could try to install with rpm command with no
dependencies, but would apt-get help me more?  I know that those of you
who use debian use this product and it sounds like you like it.  But
what about those of you who have RH?  Has any one tried apt?

I'm guessing since we've had a few IMs since then that you got it

It definitely isn't a difficult compile... but it is a *long* one unless
you have a decent CPU and lots of RAM...

I've followed the directions at kde.org to build it, and have also done
so with the SlackBuild scripts Slackware provides... both times I ended
up with a fairly stable product that was considerably faster than what
you get by default.

KNode still crashes, though... lol... I no longer have any KDE anything
on my system today.

  I knew there was something else! Thanks, Russell.

  Here are the results:

01:00.0 Display controller: 3DLabs Permedia II 2D+3D (rev 01)
        Subsystem: 3DLabs AccelStar II 3D Accelerator
        Flags: bus master, 66Mhz, medium devsel, latency 64, IRQ 10

        Capabilities: [4c] Power Management version 1
        Capabilities: [40] AGP version 1.0

  The bottom line suggests that it is an AGP slot card. I didn't know that
AGP takes a pci channel.

  So, I should get a replacement AGP video board. Any recommendations for a
low-end one?

How low-end?

There's older ATi Xpert and Radeon cards out there in the $30-40 range, but 
they'd be of questionable performance for 3D loads.

Googlegear also has a 32MB GeForce2 MX-200 for $50. TNT2 M64 cards for $33. 
GeForce4 MX's will run you anywhere from $50 to $100 depending on the card 
and will give reasonable 3D performance. In the somewhat higher-end, GeForce4 
Ti 4200's (great cards, my desktop uses one) can be found for as little as 
$120.

Finding new (as in, not used) cards under $30 that will work might be 
possible, but you'll have to look a bit to find them. I imagine you might be 
able to find used TNT's, Voodoo Banshees, and even GF2MX's for little or no 
cost if you looked hard enough.

You could also say to heck with AGP and talk somebody out of an old PCI video 
card if you're just looking for 2D work, I'm sure there's plenty of people 
out there with more of the things than they know what to do with.

  Good enough for us. We don't play games, movies, or audio on the
computers; that's what the TV/VCR and stereo are for. Games can be played
anywhere.

  Less than $50 is perfectly acceptable. As long as it works with
XFree86-4.2.0 and higher, I couldn't care less about the brand or model.

Rich,

I'm sure you'll get alot of suggestions...

When I got a new workstation a year and a half ago, I got an inexpensive 
ATI Xpert128 AGP card. It's nothing fancy but I've found it adequate 
for my Linux desktop which is strictly 2D. I'm currently running KDE 
3.x with XFree86 4.2.0 with this card. 

I did have some instability problems with XFree86 back with the early 
4.0.x versions with the this card but since I've been running with 
later versions of XFree like 4.1.0 and 4.2.0 it's been a stable setup 
for me.

When I got my system this particular ATI card was in the $50.00 price 
range as best as I recall. I'm sure there are better cards for less 
money now.

Tony

How do I change the name of my computer so I don't keep seeing

/etc/hosts but could not boot into gnome afterwards.  I attempted to
change the localhost after localhost.localdomain so it read:

But still showed localhost.local even after rebooting.

Any suggestions?

This method will change the current hostname, but it won't survive a
reboot.

In RedHat, /etc/sysconfig/network should have a line that says:
HOSTNAME=whatever.you.want

When you boot, the script /etc/rc.sysinit will read /etc/sysconfig/network
and set the hostname for you.

Somewhere in your initialization scripts (/etc/rc<X>.d) your hostname is
set with the "hostname" utility.  You'll also want the information in your
/etc/hosts to match the hostname associated with each IP address (external
addresses, really... the loopback addresses can USUALLY be almost
anything).

Right.  Grep is your friend:  

  $ cd /etc ; grep -r -i oldhostname .

Patch up as necessary.

Unless it's listed in /etc/fstab, you have to specify the mount point, not just the device.

When this is happening, what the output of 'mount' by itself?

Assuming it's not mounted anywhere. You can fsck it without mounting it.

# fsck /dev/hdc2

Subject: [PLUG] FS: IBM Thinkpad 770x + Docking station with SCSI controller
Message-ID: <000301c29841$7f70a4a0$6e01a8c0@Endeavor>

Runs Redhat Linux or Windows XP wonderfully.

IBM 770x
P-II 300mhz
256mb RAM
8.1gb HD
13.7" 1280x1024 SXGA TFT 
DVD drive
3.5" floppy (internal or external)

Detailed specifications at:
http://www5.pc.ibm.com/us/products.nsf/$wwwPartNumLookup/_95497AU

ALSO includes a NICE docking station which has 3 shared PCI/ISA and a
SCSI controller, plus room for an internal IDE or, of course, a SCSI
hard drive.  I have used with a 8gb IDE in the past as well as a
Geforce2 MX PCI video card which (under Win) performed really well on
the Half-Life/Quake III engine games.  It has its own bigger speakers
(about 3", nothing special, but better sound than a laptop), plus output
jacks for everything under the sun pretty much including USB, PS/2 for
mouse, monitor (of course), sound (line/mic/spkrs).  Has an additional
3.5" floppy drive that can also function as an external or internal
drive on the 770x.

(The docking station is comprised of the "Selectadock III" and the
"SelectaBase" port replicator)

http://www.pc.ibm.com/qtechinfo/DSHY-3PNTX4.html?lang=en_US&brand=IBM+Th
inkPad%7CDocking+Stations&family=IBM+ThinkPad%7CDocking+Stations&doctype
=&subtype=All&up=unknownuser1004106089


NOTES: I'll include Redhat 8.0 or Mandrake 9.0.  It comes with Windows
98, you supply any newer Windows version if you want that. (Really,
Redhat rocks on it).  Ideal for someone on a budget who wants a sturdy,
reliable laptop with a full 1280x1024 display with the DVD drive, and
would also enjoy using it at home as a second box in its docking
station.

As many others here will probably tell you, IBM's are rock solid, and
built like tanks.  Metal hinges vs. the cheap plastic ones on the
Dell's.  My IBM A30 (different laptop) even suffered a rather major drop
onto asphalt and continues to run like a top.  My hunch is that IBM
realized a lot of bigwigs that hold purse strings for things like large
server purchases use their laptops, hence they are built to please.

I'll include a Netgear 10/100 PCMCIA NIC if you need one.  If you need a
PCI Network card (for use when docked) we can talk.

I have to mention one more thing:  The battery life.  It's a camel, I'm
not sure on the time but I think it will last close to four hours on
light duty, less if you are running it to show a DVD of course.

Price: $495 for everything- I live in Klamath Falls (OIT student) but am
making a trip to Portland the weekend of Friday, December 13th. I have
family there and travel there often.

Last week I had some trouble updating KDE packages in order to fix a
screensaver bug for my RH 8.0 box.  There were dependencies identified,
but I could not find the packages in RH rawhide that I needed to install
in order to correct the dependency issues.  The deficient dependencies
were from older packages of KDE base and KDE libs, I believe.  They
were, most likely, from KDE that was released prior to the RH 8 release.

I guess that I could try to install with rpm command with no
dependencies, but would apt-get help me more?  I know that those of you
who use debian use this product and it sounds like you like it.  But
what about those of you who have RH?  Has any one tried apt?

TIA,

Jim

You can also change the hostname on the fly by typing 
'echo FQDN > /proc/sys/kernel/hostname'  FQDN is fully qualified domain
name, which consists of hostname.domain.com or net, etc.

Good Morning Everyone
I hope every one had a good turkey day.  Everything with my wireless card has 
been going great until today.  It stop numerous times, all morning long.  The 
error message I get is device or resources are busy.  I looked in the 
/var/log/messages and did not see any hint on why this is happening. I also 
did a search on good old google and the past postings of suse mail list and 
still stuck with the problem.  Some of the information I search was to turn 
off the dhcpd, which did not seem to help. I do not see how the dchpd could 
effect the issue I am haveing.  Then again there is alot I do not know. 

Anyone have any ideas.  Thanks
bob

These were the steps I took to change the name.  Granted, I'm not
running a server, just two home computers sharing a connection through
attbi.com.

Edit /etc/hosts to read as the following
127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain {computer name}

Edit /etc/sysconfig/network to read as the following
NETWORKING=yes
HOSTNAME={computer name}
        
I now have to computers named what I want.  Thanks for the help.

I forgot to menition, I did look @ /proc/interrupt and did not see a conflict 
there:

I was thinking it was an interrupt issue, but it does not appear so. Just want

The default main.cf file that ships with postfix is very well commented,
you should do just fine following the comments and examples.  :-)

If you get stuck with something, go ahead and ask... but I'm not going
to post my full main.cf to the list for a few reasons... one of which is
it is so well mutilated by now it won't be of much help to anybody...

OK, it's mounted on /mnt/sysimage. That /tmp/hdc2 is how it's referenced when you boot in rescue mode.

Unmount it 'umount /mnt/sysimage' and run fsck on that 'fsck /tmp/hdc2'.

Another thing. This will only repair the filesystem. If you have damaged files, they may not be recoverable. Unless you want to manually recover those (assuming the fsck fixes the filesystem) it's easier to simply reinstall from scratch.


You can back the information you want from the rescue mode, and then reinstall. Once the reinstall is done, restore the backed up information.

Unlike most other unices, linux wants the FQDN in the HOSTNAME variable in that file.

I have one of those also, and find that it's a very good card.  The rage
128 frame buffer console for Linux works with it fairly well.  You can
have it boot into 1024x768-70, and have a nice large and flicker free
text console.  It also works well with XFree86 4.2.

My other machine has an ATI Radeon board that works well also, though I
cannot get it to boot to the larger screen size.  I can use "fbset
1024x768-70" to get it there after booting.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0211301150570.407-100000@linux.sourballs.org>

I don't normally run Apache on my home desktop, but I'm using it to test
some CGI.  On a whim, I decided to make use of the UserDir directive.
So, in httpd.conf, I:

1) uncommented:
UserDir public_html

2) added:
<Directory /home/*/public_html>
    Options all
</Directory>

3) made sure /home/joe/public_html existed & had 777 perms.

4) stuck an index.html file in /home/joe/public_html.

5) fired up apache.

Browsing to http://localhost/~joe got me a 404 error:
File does not exist: /usr/local/httpd/htdocs/~joe

notice that the path isn't translated at all.

The UserDir module appears to be ok, though - here's the relevant bit
from http://localhost/server-info:

Module Name: mod_userdir.c
Content handlers: none
Configuration Phase Participation: Create Server Config
Request Phase Participation: Translate Path
Module Directives:
UserDir - the public subdirectory in users' home directories, or
'disabled', or 'disabled username username...', or 'enabled username
username...' Current Configuration:
httpd.conf
UserDir public_html

Anyone have any ideas why ~joe isn't becoming /home/joe/public_html?

(I don't even need to use the damned feature, I just want it to work...)

Thanks Josh.  I was beginning to wonder whether anybody was going to
reply.  Have you used RHUN yet?  It sounds like it works in a similar
fashion to apt, but I ran into trouble in trying to update KDE to fix a
screensaver bug.  Even though I have KDE installed from a fresh RH 8,
when I tried to update KDE, it kept referring to kde material that was
from an earlier version of KDE than the one that came with RH 8.  I
don't understand that crap.  

When you say apt and then allude to apt for rpm is there a difference. 
I was going to download apt-rpm from http://apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org/.  Is
there another place to get apt from?  

TIA,

Jim

Eric, Thanks for the info.  So I should download

Karl-
   thanks for the information, unfortunately it doesn't clear up the
problem.  I didn't see anything obviously incorrect in my httpd.conf, and
I tried a quick merge of yours with mine (your settings, my paths) but
apache stubbornly refuses to translate user directories.

I'm open to any other insights or suggestions.

Yes, this seems to be the most common problem that people have with
UserDir.  However, that particular misconfiguration results in a '403
Permission Denied' error - I'm just getting the straight '404 Not Found'.

Technically, your home dir doesn't need to be world readable, just executable

I have not been using apt in production, I use up2date on all of my production boxes.

In my tests, I can say that you can simply install the apt rpm and it will work
out-of-the-box. Synaptic will *almost* work out of the box, it requires you to
run "apt-get update" once before it will run the first time.

The default source is:

	rpm http://apt.freshrpms.net redhat/8.0/en/i386 os updates freshrpms

but since I'm working with Warren Togami at the University of Hawaii, I'm using
Warren's repository:  (see http://fedora.mplug.org/fedora.html)

	rpm ftp://videl.ics.hawaii.edu/mirrors/apt/ redhat/8.0/en/i386 os updates freshrpms


So far my experience has been that apt works ok for the most part, but is a little
funky with dependancies and conflict resolution. It messes up on Obsolete tags in
particular. Obsolete tags are usually only a factor when doing major upgrades, so
most people will never run into that. [Obsoletes don't work well with older (<2.8.x)
versions of up2date as well]

The user interface on Synaptic is somewhat non-intuitive. I had to play with it for
a while to figure out exactly how it is supposed to work work. It is much less
newbie-friendly than up2date. Once you get used to it, Synaptic works just fine.

Eventually I'll probably end up using a mix of up2date and apt. Up2date works
great for the official RH packages. Apt will be nice for third party package
support.

I was playing around with my Apache configuration on a couple different
boxes and I wasn't able to duplicate your problem.  As a side note, on
1.3.x you can leave all the UserDir stuff commented out and it still
works.  2.0.x doesn't require you to uncomment the UserDir public_html
line, even though it says you have to in httpd.conf.  So your problem is
peculiar...  Since this usually just works.  Which distro and Apache
version are you running?  Have you tried removing and reinstalling Apache
just to be sure you didn't accidentally muck something else up in the
config?  Can you access files from the default web server location
(assuming anything is even there)?  Does http://localhost/ do anything?

Thorough as always, I see.  :-) What is the best way to handle
situations where you are trying to update a package and you get
dependency issues, but find it difficult to find the packages that are
listed?  I had a situation where my screensavers don't work on my KDE
desktop.  I've tried to update KDE since that is supposed to fix the
bug.  I downloaded the kde packages, but I received a message saying
that I needed an older or earlier version of kde base and libs packages
then was available at rawhide.  I believe that the packages that were
mentioned were released before RH 8 was released.  I don't understand
why this happens in linux, but I'm trying to work my way around it.  I
was hoping that apt would help since these are mentioned in up2date
site.

TIA,

Jim

Subject: [PLUG] Mozilla and Java on RH 8.0
Message-ID: <3DE971DD.669D8847@attbi.com>

Where can I find instructions for getting Mozilla to use Java? I've
downloaded the self extracting file, j2re-1_4_1_01-linux-i586-rpm.bin,
and run it to produce j2re-1_4_1_01-fcs-linux-i586.rpm. Then I ran rpm
-ivh j2re-1_4_1_01-fcs-linux-i586.rpm. 

The next step, according to the instructions at
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/control_panel_script.html is to run
ControlPanel with the following options:

	ControlPanel [ ( -r scheme | -u scheme ) ] -c path -j path ]

-c refers to the path for the browser, which I found to be
/usr/bin/mozilla
-j refers to the path for the Java Runtime Environment, which is
/usr/java/j2rel.4.1_01
-r means register
-u means unregister
scheme is to be replaced with the name of a scheme. They list the
following, all geared towards Netscape: ns4, ns4E, ns4L, ns610, ns610L,
and ns610R.

Which one should I use for Mozilla 5.0, or is there something else I
need to do?

Thanks in advance for any clues.

No, that's coming next.

Yes, browsing from the DocumentRoot location works ok.  The default cgi
location works, too.

Dick,

I'm using an older Java (build 1.4.0_01-b03), but all I did was

  killall mozilla-bin

  ln -s /usr/java/j2sdk1.4.0_01/jre/plugin/i386/ns610/libjavaplugin_oji.so

Rich,

I've been out of town a few days but I wanted to let you know also have
started having problems with OOo starting on my system.  (I haven't made
it to the OOo lists yet.)  At first I thought I'd upgraded something that
may have broken something that OOo relied on but after some research I
found there was no correlation between the two.

Thanks Paul. In my case the path to the plugin is:

ln -s /usr/java/j2rel.4.1_01/plugin/i386/ns610/libjavaplugin_oji.so

Otherwise, I followed your directions and it works.

You're trying to use packages from Rawhide? In that case you're on your
own, no automated tool is going to help there. Rawhide constantly changes
and offers ZERO assurances that the packages and/or package dependancies
will actually work.

KDE releases it's own packages for RH8.0, which may or may not be of
use to you:

	ftp://download.us.kde.org/pub/kde/stable/3.0.5/RedHat/8.0/i386/
