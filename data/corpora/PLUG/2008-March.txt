What does your error.log say? Have you tried bumping the LogLevel up 
to something more verbose?

Alternatively, you could stop httpd and run it in debug mode (maybe 
with strace, just for grins):

   /sbin/service httpd stop
   strace -o /tmp/httpd.trace httpd -X -e debug -k start

Then try access viewvc from across the network. I suspect something 
will show up...

I finally found the answer on a French Ubuntu forum. For future
reference, "sudo hidd --search" usually works, but last night did not.
However, "sudo hidd --connect 00:0F:F6:6C:6C:DB" got it working again.

Thanks for the suggestions.  It's working now.  I discovered two 
issues.  1) Apache configuration changes are much more effective if 
you remember to tell the daemon to reload.  2) It helps to not 
transpose IP addresses(It's 192.168, not 168.192.  That's twice I've 
been burned by this.  Ah, the joys of growing older.)

Message-ID: <20080302050331.GA3367@gate.kl-ic.com>


Reminding you all that most of the PLUG Library is still in my basement,
ready for long-term borrowing.  These books were brand new last summer,
but they aren't getting any younger.  The rules are, you get to keep
the books until somebody else wants them.  I will be bringing a few
Ruby books to the Thursday PLUG meeting, for new member Gilbert. 
I can bring some for you, too. 

Please go to the main Library Wiki page at:

http://www.pdxlinux.org/wiki/PlugLibrary


Today's addition to the PLUG library is from the Tigard Library
used book sale.  At $2 per bag, it cost me about 8 cents:

http://www.pdxlinux.org/wiki/0071352600   (or)  snipr.com/20rmb

The Unofficial Guide to Getting a Job at Microsoft
by Rebecca Smith, McGraw-Hill, 2000

This is suggested reading for any twits on the list that want Linux
to be more like Windoze.  Please cut and paste the handy snipr 
abbreviation into your mailer, and send that in response.

Keith


PS - By an amazing coincidence, 20 RMB ( Renmembi, Chinese currency)
is about $2.80, which I imagine is approximately the hourly rate for
the only people Microsoft is hiring these days.  Of course, if the
dollar keeps plummeting, 20RMB will seem a pretty high wage in five
years or so.

Message-ID: <47CADA95.8020609@gmail.com>

Hi,

I've lost a maildir and it's contents from a series of mishaps and the 
system administrator at the site didn't have adequate back-ups in place. 
  We had to let the drive stay mounted for about an hour after the fact 
as it is a production mail server.  We imaged the drive the and I have 
the original now and am poking at it with various tools like foremost, 
unrm, and the like with mostly unhelpful results.

I'm hoping someone out there has advice on restoring a deleted maildir 
directory and it's contents from an ext3 filesystem.  If I can't get at 
the deleted maildir in the inodes easily, I might be able to pull an iso 
or gzipped-tarball that includes it from the night before from back-ups 
that should have been burned to disc.  I'm giving DiskInternal's Linux 
Recovery a shot on my XP box now with the image mounted.

Just frazzled.  It's been a long night.

Thanks,
Robert

I'm no expert in this area, but I'll spout a theory anyway.  If you
have a second hard drive that is identical to the first (i.e. the
exact same number of blocks), you could fdisk it to look just like the
way you want the first disk to look.  Then you could dd the first 512
bytes of the second disk onto the first.  If I'm not mistaken, the
partition table is contained in these first 512 byes.

Any boot record issues can be fixed afterwards by booting into
knoppix and using grub-install to reinstall the MBR.

No such luck.
I normally record the entire partitioning using "sfdisk -d".
This one time I was missing current info.
The files that I had were out of date.
If you read up on sfdisk, the "-d" output can be used as input to
reconstruct the partition table.
That includes the extended partitions (> 4)

Have you tried using the SleuthKit?  It's quite effective at recovery on
a wide variety of filesystems.  I would recommend staring with the fls
and ils tools and then following up with icat to get at the data.  You
can email me off list if you get stuck with them.

good luck,

   Just to throw something out for your consideration: matplotlib. It's
similar to MatLab (ergo, to Octave), but is a python library. Look at
http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/. Very powerful and flexible, and the text
and annotations can be compiled with LaTeX.

Two tools which do exactly this under Linux are TestDisk and gpart (not
to be confused with gparted).  TestDisk provides an ncurses front end of
sorts while gpart is command line driven.  Be sure to read the man pages
on them, as they may not do what you need with default options.

For anyone with disk/partition/filesystem woes, I recommend visiting
opensourceforensics.org.  There's quite a good inventory of open source
recovery tools there.

good luck,
tim

Hi,

Sometimes gpart can rebuild a damaged partition table:

Before you try anything, you will probably want to make an in image of
the entire drive.   That way if something doesn't work quite right,
you can restore from the image.

Two ways to image:
1) boot knoppix and use dd to image to an external USB drive (I've done this)
2) boot the clonezilla live CD and image to an external USB drive
(have not done this but heard good things)

Let us know how things go.

I have a mirrored pair of disks and one is failing.  "No problem, reboot,
break the mirror and go", or so I thought.

The failing drive the the primary of the pair and it seems the mirrored
drive doesn't have the MBR written. This seems brain dead.

Is this something that "happens"?

My experience (CentOS 4 & 5) is that the MBR must be manually 
duplicated to the other drive(s).  Here's an example at the bottom of 
this page:

Yeah; it's sometimes dependent on how the mirror was established. If 
you use the OS-setup routine (e.g., anaconda in Red Hat land) to build 
the mirror, grub often will only write to the MBR of the first disk it 
finds, even if the disks are intended to be fully mirrored.

What I usually do is manually invoke grub after installation and 
ensure that the MBR on the second disk is grubified.

Is NetworkManager even able to recognize the 54meg setting?  I have had very
little luck with getting NetworkManager to see my Broadcom card correctly.

Which kernel driver are you using?  b43, b43legacy, or one of the older
drivers?

Yes, this is actually common and in a way, it makes sense.

You see you are mirroring partitions here, not disks.  The MBR is not
part of the partition, it's the first sector on the disk, while your
first partition typically starts at offset 63.

Sure, if you have some magical GUI interface that tries to set this all
up for you, it might be smart enough to put grub in to two MBRs if /
your boot partition is mirrored.  In general though, the tools that do
the tasks of mirroring and of setting up the MBR have no real reason to
know about each other and coordinate things.

It seems that all the responses so far assume I implemented RAID with
Linux's software.  Instead I used the (MSI motherboard) hardware RAID for
the SATA drives.  Which, I thought, mirrored physical devices, not logical
segments.

Not true?

Tangent, with good backups I'm wondering if mirroring is worthwhile.  
It's not like I'm going to buy a now overpriced hard drive to replace the,
small by today's standards, one that failed.

Ugh, that depends entirely on how they want to do it.  I agree that is
a reasonable assumption (as is the one that it would actually cover
the entire physical media as opposed to the last N-X sectors), but
I've learned not to assume anything after my experiences in that
arena.  I was trying to go that route with an asus MB since I figured
I could dual boot and have all the mirroring free and accessible in
win and lin, but the linux drivers never did get around to supporting
the chipset for raid1, so I had software raid on linux and installed
all the windows software on a mirrored samba server instead.  I had to
move that array to another machine when the motherboard and processor
got in a literal flame war, so I was glad I'd gone that way.

If I were the manufacturer and looking for a reason not to support
mirroring the MBR, it'd be that the primary-disk-lacking machine
wouldn't boot without moving the secondary disk to primary considering
that the MBR has drive-order-dependent addresses in it (AFAIK), so the
mirror wouldn't provide for unattended or even
without-opening-the-case-and-cable-pulling failover.

You can always replace with whatever the cheapest (same or larger)
drive is...if you switch to software raid.  The other benefit there is
that you are not screwed if the *motherboard* craps out and there's
not a replacement available that understands and is willing to
participate in precisely what the last motherboard did in regards to
mirroring..

I would have thought so too.  Regardless of that, I bet this is fake 
RAID.  Did you intentionally choose to go this route?  In most cases 
you are better off using the md driver.  For example, with a fake RAID 
system, if the motherboard dies you may have difficultly when moving 
the disks to another system.  The disk data is typically stored in a 
vendor-dependent format.

Of course I'm probably telling you stuff you already know.

Ah, pardon the assumption.  I'm not familiar with the on-disk formats
that various mobo vendors use for this, but as other posters have
mentioned, I too have stayed away from these semi-fake hardware RAID
systems.  It was my understanding (at least as of the early ATA mobo
RAIDs) that the drivers do much of the work in managing the RAID logic
and it therefore buys you very little in terms of speed.   This may have
changed more recently, but again there are advantages to using a more
standardized RAID format.

That's a good question.  If you're good with your backups (and you test
that they actually worked periodically, etc), then the only advantage of
mirroring is probably the reduced downtime it buys you.  If you throw a
disk, then you're still online until you have a chance to build a whole
new array to replace it.  I did just this not too long ago when one of
my mirrored drives started complaining about a few too many bad sectors.
If you're not worried about occasional unexpected down time, then it may
not be worth it.

thanks,
tim

You are running the older driver.  Not certain if there is a good fix for
this since that driver has been deprecated.  (The b43 driver is the current
driver and, in my opinion, is much more stable.)  The b43 driver will need
the version 4 firmware.  I am not certain when Ubuntu will support it.  (The
next version I would expect.)

I would check my laptop for speed if I had it here, but I don't.

Sounds like a modified version of nmapfe.  You would want to connect it to
whatever firewall rule-builder you had to make it so you could turn things
on and off as needed.  (Getting them to understand when and why to do it is
much harder.)

Subject: [PLUG] Voice Recording applications
Message-ID: <47CC8DDB.3060808@acm.org>

I'm putting an Asterisk box together and really want to make my own 
messages for the menu system (IVR) but I can't find an easy to use 
application to record them on my Linux box; and in fact I can't get the 
one I'm trying (arecord) to work.

I went so far as to plug the headset (mic and headphones) in to the W2K 
system I have hanging around here and it worked just fine.  Sound 
Recorder worked like a charm.

And I'm pretty sure it isn't the sound card on my CentOS 5 system as, I 
can hear myself, after I fiddled with alsamixer and friends.

The examples for using arecord are less than spectacular so I may just 
be doing-it-wrong.

Any suggestions for software, applet, application?  Google searches are 
not giving me much to work with.


Thanks,
Rod

I've successfully recorded with gramofile on Linux, although I have not
tried it with a microphone. gramofile is a command line tool using ncurses.

Audacity should also work, if you are willing to live with a GUI.

I've never had any issues with it. It seems that most popular distros install it easily.

Gramofile isn't available via any of the repositories I have set up, 
including rpmforge, and it is a little long in the tooth -- 2001 was the 
last update.  :-)

But Audacity works like a charm.  A better quality headset or mic would 
help but so far it works.  Two messages down and ??? to go.

Jason, thanks for the suggestion.  I'd been down the alsamixer trail and 
must have got the settings right.

One way you could do it is to use Asterisk itself to record to a temp file
and then move an rename accordingly.
Code in you dial plan could look like....

exten => _66XX,1,Wait(2)
exten => _66XX,2,Record(/tmp/prompt${EXTEN:2}:wav)
exten => _66XX,3,Wait(1)
exten => _66XX,4,Playback(/tmp/prompt${EXTEN:2})
exten => _66XX,5,Wait(2)
exten => _66XX,6,Hangup()

This lets you dial from 6600 to 6699 and drops the recording to /tmp. Press
# when you are done recording and it will play it back to you. You can then
rename and move files accordingly. The resulting recording tends to be
fairly good quality since most modern phones will filter out most
background/whitenoise.

Having used $pendy professional audio multitracking & editing on the Mac 
& Windows, i've been very impressed with Audacity. It's definitely "goog 
enough" for home-studio multitrack recording, and the ease of editing is 
a dream for cleaning up voice recordings (i've used it for a number of 
voice podcasts).

Before you try anything, you will probably want to make an in image of
the entire drive.   That way if something doesn't work quite right,
you can restore from the image.

Two ways to image:
1) boot knoppix and use dd to image to an external USB drive (I've done
this)
2) boot the clonezilla live CD and image to an external USB drive (have not
done this but heard good things)

Let us know how things go.

Regards,
- Robert

Note that the bit-rate is usually adaptive.  That is, an algorithm
tries to pick the rate that maximized throughput when packet loss is
taken into consideration.  If there is noise, or if you aren't right
near the access point, it ought not be surprising to have a rate less
than 54M.

Russell,

Here is the output of iwconfig:

robin at moose:~$ iwconfig eth1
eth1      IEEE 802.11b/g  ESSID:"KP4983"  Nickname:"Broadcom 4311"
         Mode:Managed  Frequency=2.437 GHz  Access Point: 
00:15:E9:69:36:FF           Bit Rate=24 Mb/s   Tx-Power=18 dBm

         Link Quality=88/100  Signal level=-46 dBm  Noise level=-69 dBm
         Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:6  Rx invalid frag:0
         Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0

Noise level seems to be a bit higher than the signal level...do I read 
that right?

Just wondering if booting up on a rescue CD, then you could grubify your

Those are negative numbers.  The signal is 17 dB above the noise floor.

Subject: [PLUG] Lost Boot sector and partition table -- Resolved
Message-ID: <016401c87e0f$2009c6e0$6d01a8c0@RAMA>

Well gang,

I recovered the data.
gpart works fine for primary partitions.  It recovered my boot and /
partitions.
gpart is clueless with respect to extended/logical partitions, even through
it detects them.

After recovering partitions 1-3, I used testdisk.
First I went to my trusty Knoppix 5.1.1 -- but wait, testdisk is missing a
NTFS library that apt-get can't seem to find.
After some searching, I down loaded gparted-LiveCD which contains both gpart
and testdisk.
testdisk ran fine from this live CD.  testdisk is a great program!
After several reworking attempts I finally hit upon the options and
selections needed to recover all three of my logical partitions.
The text GUI is nice.  It even lets you see the directories on your proposed
partitions.
This will be my "goto" application for partition recovery from now on.

I have also resolved, that if I have the time to zero out disks that I am
repartitioning so as to make recovery easier.  I was amazed at how many old
partitioning it detected.

I have a disk in which the boot sector (including the primary partition
table) was overwritten.
All partitions are ext2 and ext3.
Does anyone know of any software that can possibly reconstruct the primary
partition table?

Somebody suggested I mess with the timeout value in
/boot/grub/menu.lst, and that "fixed" it.  With the timeout set
explicitly to 0, the box boots unattended.  With any other value, or
with the line commented out, the box waits forever in the grub screen.
No matter what the value of timeout, there's no counter at the bottom
telling me how long until it boots.  So at least it's honest.

I put "fixed" in quotes because with the timeout at 0 there's no way
(ok, I only tried twice) to break in and pick other than the default
kernel/cmdline.  So it's back to lilo for this box.

Thanks,

--Eric

There is a way to break in: repeatedly tap the ESC key after the bios
screen.  But if LILO works for you, use that.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0803040844110.15363@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   For the few among us who use LaTeX/TeX/LyX for writing technical documents
and other important tomes, there is now the ability to write business
letters, proposals, and similar documents -- complete with logos or
letterheads and scanned signatures -- without dropping back to a word
processor.

   With the assistance of one of the LyX developers in Germany, I have a
working letter/proposal template that uses a PDF file for the letterhead and
a scanned signature so the pdf file can be "signed." It's based on the
KOMA-letter2 style and is compiled using pdflatex.

   The template will soon be posted to the LyX wiki <http://www.lyx.org/> and
available for your writing pleasure.

   By including your technical vector graphics using PSTricks, you can create
beautiful typeset documents and forego word processors except to translate
M$ .doc files to .odt.

Mike,

Boy, that was scary.
As you can see from my posting to the group I recovered the data.
The author of testdisk has done a good job.
It even apparently can handle some Vista stuff.

I am transferring the data to a new system.
I will keep more up-to-date copies of boot sectors and sfdisk dumps.
And of course, backups.

Hi,

Sometimes gpart can rebuild a damaged partition table:

  Not really...  The voice tends to go over licensed emergency bands
in the US.  A lot of the data was actually running over the old CDPD
network.  Most was transitioned to the CDMA or GPRS data networks when
the CDPD networks went away.

I know this has been asked before....

I am in need of a local (pdx) colo space for a 2U server.

I will probably need 5 or so IPs and I'm very price conscious. 

Where should I look and who should I avoid?

I just got a machine set up with coho.net.  They're a small shop quite a
ways out of town, but so far they seem good with support.  They gave me
a deal on the price for the first year which tipped the scales in their
favor.  Depending on where you live, it may not be terribly convenient
for you though.

good luck,
tim

PS - If you do ultimately end up using coho.net, tell them who referred
     you. ;-)

If you need real local, there is Primarytarget.com
They are primarily a dedicated server company, hosting game servers for a
variety of games, and even game servers for EA, and other big massive online
games.
They also do co-location in several cities, their Portland location being
inside the Pittock building here in downtown PDX.
If you're familiar with the Pittock building, then you know all of its
benefits as a major telco hub.
About 20 providers are in this building, and they all peer on GigE, and
10-GigE switches in a Meet-Me room.
The building has redundant power feeds, redundant diesel generators which
are tested monthly, and the building has four entry points for its Fiber
loops.

I also work in this building (not for Primarytarget).
I have used Primarytarget in the past, though. Recently I moved my server
onto my internal network in this building.
One of the resellers of bandwidth in this building in SilverStar Telecom.
They sell BGP peered bandwidth that meshes with the rest of the providers in
this building. No need to mix your own BGP.
I routinely saw sub 10ms pings to much of the west coast, and below 60ms to
the rest of the country. High data throughput was also much enjoyed by me
:)

There are other co-lo providers in the Pittock:
www.pdx.net
www.dsl-only.net
www.lsnetworks.net

You may also be able to get your own cage, or quarter rack from the building
management, and mix your own bandwidth.

Hope this doesnt sound like a sales pitch, but this is one of the better
buildings in Portland, the other being Inflow/Sungard, or ATT (both of those
are hard to get private equipment into)

I have a few boxes out at Easystreet and have no issues.  Their NOC is
responsive around the clock and the wind power offering (via PGE) is preferred
by us and our clients.

Subject: [PLUG] Adding a startup script in SuSE
Message-ID: <47D17A92.1060308@comcast.net>

Last week I learned that in Slackware rc.local is where one puts
something one wants to run when the system is booted. This week, I'm
trying to locate that in SuSE.

There is a link in /etc called rc.d that points to init.d. Inside init.d
there are numerous directories and files. There is boot.d, rc0.d through
rc6.d, and rcS.d. I understand that rc0.d through rc6.d relate to run
levels. I don't know what rcS.d is for, although from its contents, it
looks like it's related to booting.

The SuSE documentation tells me:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
boot.local
 Here, enter additional commands to execute at boot before changing into
a runlevel. It can be compared to AUTOEXEC.BAT on DOS systems.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

boot.local does not appear to exist, yet. It's not clear to me if it is
supposed to be a file I add to boot.d or a directory into which I put
more files.

All I want to do is to have this command run when the system boots:

#! /bin/sh
#
#
# create a link to /dev/ttyS0 for use by the x10 program
ln -s /dev/ttyS0 /dev/ttyX10

Should I create a file named boot.local and put those line into it, or
should I create a directory named boot.local and put another file in
there with those lines.

If the later, is there a naming convention? I understand that the files
for starting things begin with S followed by a number, and that they are
executed in numerical order. Likewise, the files for shutting things
down begin with K and a number. Would I create a similar convention for
files I put into a boot.local directory?

TIA.

You are on the right track.

1) put all boot up scripts in /etc/init.d/
2) softlink to the script from /etc/rc?.d/ using the Kxx/Sxx convention

Wish I could point to a good reference.  If I find one I will.

I don't know about SuSE, but Redhat initialization works like this:

kernel boots and starts init process
init reads /etc/inittab
init runs /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit
init runs /etc/rc.d/rc N, where N is the current runlevel
/etc/rc.d/rc runs the startup scripts in the directory rcN.d
In rcN.d there is a sym link S99local which points to ../rc.local. 
The S99 prefix causes rc.local to run last.

I would look in rc3.d or rc5.d for a symbolic link that points to 
boot.local.  Of course, none of this may be applicable to SuSE.

I was wrong. boot.local does exist. I just didn't see it when I looked
before. It is a file in /etc/init.d. It tells me:

# Here you should add things, that should happen directly after booting
# before we're going to the first run level.

So, I'll pop my little command in there and see if it works, the next
time I need to re-boot.

Thanks for the advice.

   I recall a brief thread last month on the various ID3 editors that run
on linux and are used to add metadata to .mp3 and .ogg music files. I looked
at the mail list archives (plug and plug-talk) for January and February
without seeing this thread.

   Was there a consensus recommendation of an editor?

I missed the thread, but if MusicBrainz's Picard Tagger wasn't on the 
list I'd recommend it.

I don't recall the thread or a consensus, and I'm not sure I would have
expected a consensus.

   Well, I thought there was such a thread, but the discussion of id3 tags
may have been part of a different thread.

   Thank you. I'll build the supporting libraries and the application.

My consensus of one is:

A) id3v2 for the straightforward MP3 tagging tasks. Simple,
command-line interface. Good for tagging large collections of files
when you already know what the tag data should be.

B) picard for most everything else. picard has a GUI that's difficult
to understand at times (even the developers admit this), but the way
it makes use of the MusicBrainz "audio fingerprint" database is almost
magical. Highlight the mystery tracks (or the ones you're just too
lazy to manually tag), click "scan", and if They know about your
track, it'll be tagged automatically. Works with all sorts of file
formats, including MP3, Ogg, FLAC, etc.

It must have been a _very_ brief thread, 'cause I sure don't remember
it.  That said, everybody seems to have their favorite.  I use EasyTag.

There were two threads mentioning ID3: one starting in November 2006
(subject:"I say Uncle")* and another in November 2007 (subject:"Rip CD
software")*.  I suspect the latter is the one you were thinking of.

Subject: [PLUG] linux wireless laptop help for saturday peace event
Message-ID: <9FD903B1-D4C8-4BE3-B333-6C0818A86C48@gmail.com>

Hi,

I just joined this list a couple weeks ago, so forgive me if this  
query is out the character of this list, but here goes..

We are looking for some people who might want to serve as tech support/ 
or mentors to youth to help set up wireless on about 4 or 5 Ubuntu  
laptops on loan from Free Geek during this week, to ultimately serve  
as public accessible computers at an all day outdoor peace rally/ 
workshops/music event on the anniversary of the start of the Iraq war  
- next Saturday March 15th in the south park blocks, SW Portland. It's  
a full day of music, with speakers, and 9 workshop tents, with a large  
march through downtown Portland.

This is specifically for the Youth Tent workshop area to have  
computers available in order to recording experiences of the day,  
sending email - so nothing too complicated, and a great way to show  
off linux. Although they are getting these laptops setup from Free  
Geek - there is a bit of support needed to make them wireless ready  
(at least with the broadcom chipset wireless compaq laptop I just  
setup).

It's possible that kids from the youth group might want to take this  
on, but might need a mentor to track down the appropriate drivers or  
unix commands to make it all happen. They are planning on getting a  
booster for wireless signal as well.

The contact for this is Pam Phan at pamphan at gmail.com , Youth  
Coordinator

I am sending this message for them - so it's best to contact Pam  
directly.

Info about this event is at http://www.pdxpeace.org/m15

thanks

Robert,

Subject: [PLUG] Boot Hangs After LILO
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0803111100440.2657@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Up until this morning, my Sony VAIO notebook booted and ran just fine.
Including yesterday afternoon. Now, when I try to boot it, LILO completes,
but nothing happens after that. It sits there with no hard drive activity
and doesn't continue loading the OS.

   According to http://www.dslreports.com/faq/1622, if I see LILO on the
screen, followed by loading linux-2.6.21.5 and a bunch of dots walking
across the screen, then all parts of LILO have worked as designed. There are
no BIOS error messages. The installed OS is Slackware-12.0.

   When I reboot with my knoppix-3.6 cdrom inserted, it boots and I can look
at all partitions in /dev/hda5. /dev/hda6, and /dev/hda7 (the user
partitions as originally set up by Emperor Linux).

   What might be the reason for the system to hang and not continue booting
at this point?

No chance you upgraded the kernel Rich? Were you running in console or frame
buffer boot mode (pardon my ignorance on this one I've always let it boot @
640x480)?

I've had weird issues after kernel upgrades and booting when I was using
frame buffer mode in Slackware.

   Apparently not. I posted the problem on the slackware section of
linuxquestions.org and received one response. Following his suggestion, I
booted with the first Slackware-12.0 disk and at the boot: prompt entered
'hugesmp.s /dev/hda6 rdinit=ro'.

   The system booted, I logged in as a user, and started X. Then I
re-installed the 2.6.21.5 kernel and rebooted. System hung, just like
before. I just re-ran mkinitrd and this makes no difference, either.

   Not experiencing this wonderful learning opportunity before in the decade+
I've run linux, I'm at a total loss regarding what broke and how to fix it.
The hard drive's OK, the system boots off the knoppix and slackware cdroms,
but it won't boot by itself with the kernel reinstalled.

Sigh,

Rich

Drew,

   I had upgraded when the new kernel became available on Feb 18th. Yes, it
has been happily running in the framebuffer (1024x768) during boot, with Tux
sitting happily in the upper left corner of the screen.

   I'm completely stumped. As I wrote initially, it never had a boot problem
through yesterday afternoon.

   So, reinstalled the kernel-generic-smp-2.6.21.5_smp-i686-2_slack12.0.tgz just
now and re-ran mkinitrd.

   Booting from the Slackware-12.0 Disk 1, I use the boot command:
 	hugesmp.s root=/dev/hda6 rdinit= ro

and it boots (console not in frame buffer mode).

   In /boot, System.map, config, and vmlinuz all point to the
vmlinuz-generic-smp-2.6.21.5-smp files.

   Just for the heck of it I just ran /sbin/lilo (although LILO appeared to
run to conclusion) and ... ta da! It once again boots. So, something FUBARed
lilo when the system shut down yesterday. In /etc/lilo.conf I have vga 773
enabled: framebuffer 1024x768x256.

   But, now it works again. Yea!

Whew!

A coffee shop I frequent is expanding and they want to use a single
database for their credit accounts across all stores. There are a large
number of packages that can do this, but I don't even know what
questions to ask to get something that will work for the life of the
business.

Doesn't this look like fun?

If you do this kind of thing for a living, I'll happily share. The pay

   I'm trying to replace a '\n' with '),\n', but haven't figured out the
proper syntax. The search is specified with \$, but if I specify the
replacement as ),\$ the editor wants to keep adding '),' to the end of the
same line.

   My ORA emacs book has no explicit examples (pages 57-65), and replacing at
the begging and ending of lines is a frequent occurrence with me that always
leads to spending a lot of time and failing to get it right.

   Cluesticks greatly appreciated.

So you're trying to do the equivalent of this:

$ echo foo | sed 's/$/),/'

in emacas.  Is that right?

   Ah, yes. To those whose only tool is a hammer, everything looks like a
nail.

   Actually, I discovered the solution by reading comments to a blog on how
to do the replacement. The blog's solution did not work, but one comment
well down the page did.

   For posterity (and my future needs when I forget it again) here's the
poop:

   M-% (to specify search-and-replace)
   C-q C-j (that's emac's code to create a newline, as the search string)
   ),C-q C-j (for the replacement string)

   Once you confirm it's working, press ! to automatically run to the end of
the file.

   (I suppose that I abhore vi and its offspring because it's a line-oriented
editor rather than a page oriented editor, and rquires entering and leaving
modes to add, modify, delete, and so on. I spent a summer typing a long
dissertation into the HP-3000's only text editor, TDP -- that's Text and
Data Processor, a line-oriented editor that was like an electronic
typewriter. Don't remember the number of characters per line, but if one did
not press the [Enter] key at the end of the line the rest of the characters
were truncated. Had to exit 'add' mode and enter 'move' mode to get to
another location in the file, then entered 'modify' mode to make changes or
'delete' mode to delete something. It was a miserable, time consuming
experience. I'll take a screen-oriented editor over a line-oriented editor
every time. Then, of course, the MIS folks in the business college took the
system down for some reason and lost my entire file. I ended up retyping the
entire dissertation on an IBM Selectric typewriter so I could defend it and
get done with the degree.)

I'm not sure I understand the problem you're describing.

I did:

M-x replace-regexp
$<enter>
)<enter>
and every line in the buffer now ends with ")"

It seems like that does what you want (modulo a ",")

Using the \$'s as mentioned above has no effect (nothing matches)
although I get errors and thrown into the debugger if only the replace
string contains \$ (no groups in the search string?)

Robert,

   Yeah. Didn't occur to me to use sed. Sigh. I'm not used to thinking of sed
when editing files. I suppose tr could also be used.

   Wouldn't I need to specify that it's a global replacement, too?

Rogan,

   I did not try that because the emacs book notes that the ^ and $ need to
be escaped with a \.

   Next time I'll try that.

You could, although it would be unnecessary as lines only have one end.

It seems that you need the escape when searching for a literal $.  The
rules for replacement seem a bit more opaque, but I may just not have
good test examples.

It could also be that emacs 23 behaves differently.

   I found them opaque for beginning and ending actions.

   Good point. I have 21.4 installed here, but the book's 12 years old and
probably well out of date. I should dump the book and use the online docs
instead.

In sed things like ) and $ must be escaped because they have special

Does emac do something similar?  Hope this helps

Subject: [PLUG] Wireless headsets for softphones
Message-ID: <47D82CB6.70007@acm.org>

Any recommendations for low-to-moderate priced wireless headsets to use 
with a softphone?  Searching with google (both raw and from 
voip-info.org) gets lots of cellphone stuff.

So I think I'm looking for either a semi-proprietary wireless system; 
plugs into the Mic and Earphone jacks and does wireless to the actual 
headset; or a bluetooth based system.  The obvious restriction is it 
must work on a Linux system.  Mine is currently CentOS 5.


Thanks,
Rod

Thanks Fred,

I seem to remember using them years ago for some cellular and Palm Pilot 
stuff.

Looking at the prices makes me think I'll go with a hard IP phone.  I 
can get a Grandstream for around $80.00.

Plus, from my research it looks like Bluetooth headsets (listen and 
talk-able) are not quite there in Linux.  I _could_ get a connection to 
my cell and push some files across but didn't go any further with that 
as I have other work to get done.  8-(

You might want to ask the guys at FreeGeek. I know they had around 100 POS
systems to fix and throw linux POS (touch screen) software on. I evaluated
around 50 of them. Fun stuff.

Subject: [PLUG] laptop bag - marginally Linux related
Message-ID: <20080313231459.GE16269@merlot.com>

Hmm... how can I connect this to Linux? My T61 which RUNS LINUX  doesn't
fit in my old Kensington Saddlebag. Oh, it fits, but about two inches on
the DVD-burner end remain unprotected by any kind of padding. If you
have a laptop that fits, I highly recommend the Saddlebag with it's easy
lifetime warrantee.

But my T61 doesn't fit. I need something that doesn't look extreme; not
too corporate and not too pierced and tattooed. No big logos, no fine
Corinthian leather, no shiny buckles. On the inside, I need room for a
15.4" widescreen with the fattest factory battery and all my stuff
(power brick, collection of retractable cables, paper notebook,
headphones and a Clif bar). 

If it also has room for a toothbrush and a change of clothes, great. If
it can do that with less than 3 pounds of overhead, my credit card is
itching to be entered.

A comfortable backpack would be great; a messenger bag might work also. 

Suggestions?

Thanks!

This is what I use.  It is the only backpack I have found that will fit my
laptop.

I had a Jansport laptop backpack that fit a 15" PowerBook with room to
spare. It was relatively inexpensive (~$60), very durable, and had
plenty of additional space for books, gadgets, clean underwear, etc.
It doesn't appear to be available anymore, but it looks like Jansport
still has a few comparable models:

I use a Spire backpack (http://www.spireusa.com/).  I've gone through three of
them, all carrying T series.

First one was stolen in Hawaii carrying a T43.  I got everything back but the
bag (long story).

Second one was stolen when my house was broken into.  This time nothing came
back (the same T43 was now stolen for good.. but it was LVM/dm-crypt).

So I'm now on my 3rd one, at first housed an HP NC6220, how housing a Lenovo T61
(14" screen).

They seem to switch out their models often, as I haven't had the same one twice.
 Looking now I would probably say mine compares to the Torq model.


On second thought, maybe it's the bag that is bad luck. :)

More trendy, but I've heard good things about these:

I've got an old Spire shoulder bag that I liked quite a bit until my 
laptop outgrew it, they make a size that fits bigger laptops too though:

I use a The North Face backpack, "Bandwidth" model, that holds my T61
with the fat battery just fine. The laptop compartment is padded and
also has a sling on the bottom to keep the laptop from being banged if
you set the backpack down hard. In addition to my T61 the laptop
compartment will hold a fat notebook and a couple of textbooks. I use
the front compartment for the power brick, bluetooth headphones, iPod,
enough clothes for a couple of days, and a couple more books. There is
also a smaller front compartment suitable for toothbrush, razor, and
related articles.

I don't know if they still make it, but I do know that The North Face
advertising literature lists the maximum screen size that you can get
in their various backpacks. I got it at an outdoor outftter store on
Broadway just south of Burnside - name escapes me at the moment. It's
not REI, but that's the kind of merchandise they sell.

Also, because it's the "Bandwidth" model, carrying my laptop around in
it makes the network faster.

I've been using a Chrome messenger bag (www.chromebags.com) daily for
years (~10 years?) it doesn't have a laptop sleeve, but that's easily
remedied by getting one for $20 (I *don't* suggest Tom Bihn sleeves --
they are very expensive and very bulky, which seems counter to the
idea of a sleeve.)

Things I like about the big chrome bag / little sleeve combo:

   * it doesn't look at all like a laptop bag.
   * new laptop? new $20-30 sleeve, same ~$100 bag, and you *could*
carry ~4 T61's at once, if you were insane.
   * in 10 years of daily use, the only sign of wear is sun bleaching.
   * lots of space, and you can take the laptop sleeve out if you need
more (and either leave the laptop, or get another strap and carry the
sleeve over your other shoulder)
   * Chrome makes amazing messenger bags.  It has a rubberized liner
which is waterproof, and once you grock packing it right, you can
easily make it mold to your back at nearly any level of fullness.

My only complaint is that I haven't found a good way to carry a camera
+ lenses in it.

Chrome does make laptop bags, but I have no experience with them.
I've also been generally impressed with Crumpler bags, but they are
quite heavy and somewhat stiff, so they may or may not meet your
needs.  Tom Binh bags look nice, and many of them probably are (plus,
he's local to Seattle) but the sleeve I'm using now is by him ant it
is bulky compared to other sleeves, as well as costing somewhere
around $45 + $20 for the shoulder strap. (I desperately needed one on
hours notice, and it was the only place open.)

i have a Targus  TXL617 
(http://www.targus.com/us/product_details.asp?sku=TXL617), into which i 
can comfortably fit:

- 17", ~10 lb Clevo/Sager laptop
- noise-cancelling headphones, iPod, Handspring Visor, various cables & 
adapters
- business casual clothes for a 3-day trip
- snacks for a x-country plane flight
- reading & note-taking paraphenelia

It's fairly non-descript looking; a bit less geeky than the JINX, though 
not as earthy as the Chrome.

When it's full, it doesn't *quite* fit under the seat in front of me (at 
least in coach). But, it's pretty comfortable to wear, even when fully 
loaded. i use a much smaller freebie that i got as conference swag when 
i travel with my tiny (in comparison) note-taking and e-mailing Dell 
Latitude D620.

The smaller Targus  TSB007US 
(http://www.targus.com/us/product_details.asp?sku=TSB007US) has most of 
the same features, but is better suited for the smalle machines.

 From the gui, Applications->Settings->Printing brings up a Printer 
configuration application.  Select a printer on the left, then, under 
the Settings tab, click on the Make Default button.

I can't believe I just admitted to only knowing the gui way to do

I have one of these Timbuk2 for a T42.  It has at least an inch to
spare, width-wise for my 14-inch LCD model.  A little spendy at $100,
but it matched my needs.  I'd be okay hauling this around on a bike in

Before that, i had a cheap nylon bag with good padding that I paid $20
for at a random luggage store.  It fit the machine, and provided
padding but not waterproofness, which led to the change.

   Thanks, Galen. It occurred to me late last evening that I should perhaps
try the BUI approach, but your way is simpler.

   We change as we age. And the ?ubuntu familily of distributions is heavily
GUI-oriented so sometimes that's the path of least resistance.

Kurt,

I have a T61 also and can't say enough good things about my Timbuk2 Track 
Daypack.

<URL: http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/laptop/track-day-pack >

(I also have a really great canvas and corduroy laptop sleeve from them 
that I use in my ginormous messenger bag when I need more cargo space.)

It's got a very nicely padded, corduroy lined laptop compartment right up 
against your back with a larger storage area behind that and a full-size 
zippered pocket with internal pockets on the outside.  Plus, there are two 
vertical zippered pockets on the very back face (which I use for snacks, 
yo-yo, things of that nature).  Also, there are side pokcets for water 
bottle and/or umbrella (if you're of that bent).  There's an ipod pocket 
inside the main compartment (up against the padded laptop compartment) and 
a double-flap headphone port (yeah, it would be cooler if it had a dock 
connector and controls on the straps, but those just aren't as common as 
you'd hope*).

The front (which is on your back) is padded with an unpadded channel down 
the middle for air-cooling (I wear this on my bike every day).  The 
shoulder straps are quite comfortable and adjustable.  There are loops on 
the straps that appear to be designed to take belt-clips for phone 
holsters and the like.

And while this pack is smaller than most of theirs, I find it's a great 
size for carrying my math books and a sweater.

Again, I use this bag every day (black/silver color -- the logo is fairly 
inobtrusive in that color, but also succumbs to a seam ripper and some 
dilligence) and I promise you the rain and heat here are more punishing 
than anything you see in Portland.

Anyway, I love mine and was able to buy one over at The Mac Store on NE 
7th & Multnomah for a bit less than the Timbuk2 online store.  Woot!  Go 
local!

J.

*  A friend of mine has a snowboarding jacket that contains an inside 
pocket with ipod dock connector and a minijack on the lapel (it came with 
very short-cable headphones) and controls on the left sleeve.  Brilliant.

Sunday March 16 (3rd sunday each month) is Linux Clinic Day!!!   

Join us at 1PM to 5PM at Free Geek (1731 SE 10th Ave, 2 blocks south
of Hawthorne, http://www.freegeek.org/map.php ) and bring your
misbehaving computer or your misbehaving Linux repair guru.  We will
combine them and see what happens.

We will have distros, power, wifi, ethernet, monitors, keyboards, and
meece.  We will have coffee, cookies, and Penguinos (a mexican cupcake,
somewhere between Little Debbie and scouring pad).  We will have 
access to the vast Free Geek library, with solutions to all problems
for software predating 1995.  We will have bad jokes, nerd cameraderie,
Linux expertise,  hardware expertise, linguistic expertise,  dating
expertise (just kidding, we are nerds after all), strange opinions, 
and a hammer to smash unsupported wifi cards.  The thrift store will
be closed, so it's a good idea to bring whatever hardware you might
need to get your machine running.

Escape your drab, wretched, lonely existence!  Replace your boring
old problems with shiny new ones!  Help others find the true path
to open source enlightenment!  

PLUG Library:  surf to www.pdxlinux.org/wiki/PlugLibrary and look
at the NEW books available.  Check them out, get them out of my
basement, and LEARN SOMETHING!  I will be bringing a box of checked
out books to the Clinic - I wouldn't mind bringing two boxes!

I just got stuff from www.tombihn.com - they seem to be very laptop savvy with
inserts that provide various degrees of soft-to-hardness, and even
accomodating the 17-inch MBP of mine.  I've had it only a day, but I'm
impressed with the value (I got the Big Brain backpack).

Are you sure that all your DNS servers are running the same zone 
files?

   dig domain.tld +nssearch | awk '/^SOA/ {print $4" "$11}'

If they are, hmmm. I guess I'd shutdown named on the secondary in 
question, remove all slave files, restart it, and test again.

These are my top two choices right now. I checked all the 'serious'
messenger bags and all the Timbuk2 bags at REI, and I'm going to go to a
local bike shop after lunch to hopefully test fit a Chrome bag. I've
always lusted after the Chrome bags, but they are not cheap and my
Saddlebag has served me well, pre-widescreen.

The Track backpack looks pretty damn ugly on the Timbuk2 site, but it
also looks extremely functional. I guess that's a good balance... I
think REI has those and I didn't investigate them very deeply because
they're so ugly. Yes, I'm shallow. #:) I'll look at one of these today
also.

Thanks for the suggestions!

GUI interfaces can be nice but just for reference you can use lpadmin
with the -d switch to set the default printer.

Subject: [PLUG] Postfix smarthost, relay, null-client - SMTP AUTH?
Message-ID: <47DAFB3B.50103@acm.org>

If that subject isn't confusing I'll elaborate and see if I can muddy 
the waters less.

I am trying to get a system to use another system's mail server to 
actually deliver messages (they're reports).  But after a day plus 
researching and testing I'm totally stumped.

I suspect I have got something in a knot on the sending system's Postfix 
main.cf file and I haven't kept very good records (all in memory) of 
what I've been changing and unchanging.

First off after many failures I installed saslfinger and see the remote 
system (client) has:

250-AUTH LOGIN
250-AUTH=LOGIN

Main.cf on the sending system (server) has these entries (w/ mungified 
values):

relayhost = [smtp.domain.tld]
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter = !plain, login, static:rest
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/smtp_auth
smtp_sasl_security_options =
smtp_sasl_type = cyrus

and smtp_auth has

smtp.domain.tld	username:password

and I've run postmap smtp_auth

Yet when I run saslfinger -s I'm get

saslfinger - postfix Cyrus sasl configuration Fri Mar 14 15:09:27 PDT 2008
version: 1.0.2
mode: server-side SMTP AUTH

-- basics --

-- active SMTP AUTH and TLS parameters for smtpd --
No active SMTP AUTH and TLS parameters for smtpd in main.cf!
SMTP AUTH can't work!

/var/log/maillog has

Mar 14 14:44:14 rpt postfix/smtp[2968]: 81F6667F42:

delays=0.1/0/0.01/0, dsn=4.7.0, status=deferred (SASL authentication 
failed; cannot authenticate to server smtp.domain.tld[1.2.3.4]: no 
mechanism available)


What the heck am I missing?  Every page I've found, web-in-general and 
from postfix.org, says this should work (or the !@#$%^ message thread 
stops at this point.)

Suggestions, thoughts, ideas?


Thanks,
Rod

The name server in question had a resolv.conf that pointed to other servers
that had cached values from a period of misconfiguration.  

It's easy to get caught up in thinking a DNS server will check with itself
first.

If I run wget on a file (or series of files), how do I specify what
directory I want the loaded file to go to? The way I understand it is that
wget loads the file into whatever dir it was run from. But I don't want that
behavior, as I am giving somebody else the command to run as a cron job. I
would like to be able to specify the dir from root, like
/home/something/download. Since I know where the directory is on this
persons server (and I won't be running the command), I feel if I specify the
directory from root, it will eliminate confusion, as opposed to saying "cd
into the downloads dir, then run the command". Thanks. Kurt

       -P prefix
       --directory-prefix=prefix
           Set directory prefix to prefix.  The directory prefix is the 
direc-
           tory where all other files and subdirectories will be saved to,
           i.e. the top of the retrieval tree.  The default is . (the

I see this in 'man wget':

       -P prefix
       --directory-prefix=prefix
           Set directory prefix to prefix.  The directory prefix is the 
directory where
           all other files and subdirectories will be saved to, i.e. the 
top of the
           retrieval tree.  The default is . (the current directory).

If you're only pulling down one file / wget command, you can use
--output-file=<file>

eg:

   # pull my LaTeX bib file down from citeulike,
   # storing it in dynamic.bib, instead of "creswick"
   wget --output-document=dynamic.bib
http://www.citeulike.org/bibtex/user/creswick

(Aside:  I've found this to be *extremely* handy for managing
citations with multiple LaTeX documents.  The thing I haven't figured
out is a good way to check the timestamp on dynamic.bib and compare it
to the modification time of the citeulike feed for my username(s), so
I have to manually invoke the make target to update dynamic.bib when
it's needed.)

I stopped by Free Geek this morning and picked up a key so there will
not be a repeat of the delay we experienced last month. The Clinic will
start on time at 1:00. There will be coffee and the usual assortment of
goodies and merriment. Y'all come on down and bring your ailing
computers and assorted Linux problems. Or just come to watch and ask
questions. Or just come and have fun!

I see this in 'man wget':

This seems like the way I'm looking for (the -P option). The command I was
running is this (minus quotes): "wget -c -i image_urls.txt", which works
great but probably not as a cron job. So if I was to modify this command to
put files into the proper directory, I come up with this (minus quotes):
"wget -c -P /home/webadmin/images/ -i image_urls.txt". I'm not sure whether
or not the syntax is right, and I'd rather not run the command on the server
without getting the ok by someone who has done this before. I was also
thinking that it might be easier to simply add the command "cd
/home/webadmin/images/" before the wget command... Any suggestions? Thanks!

You should test it on your own with sample values.  (maybe a short
list of urls, and some local directory.)  You should be able to run
wget on pretty much any OS out there, and cygwin will even have the
correct path characters if you're stuck on windows.

There's always more than one way to do it, but I'd suggest just using
the wget command.  "cd" can fail, and then you'd end up with files in
random places.

I tested the -P option with the directory and it worked great. tested on
local computer and on server ;) This job is officially done... phew

Your right about cd'ing in a cron job. I don't know why but I'm worried
about that. Seems like an ugly way to do it. But really, I can't think of a
reason why cd'ing wouldn't work, especially as root? I would still have the
same problem with the -P option if the destination directory for the photos
changed...

Thanks a lot

Thanks for letting us know how things went using the -P option.  Never
looked at it until this thread.

As for cd, the simplest solution would be to do something like "cd ...
&& wget ...".   But the -P option seems more elegant.

Regards,

I haven't checked, but presumably if wget can't write to the directory
for some reason, it won't write *anything*.  Robert C.'s suggestion
to: cd <place> && wget ...   is a good one, but any way you cut it,
using the cd in addition to wget introduces an additional (albiet
small) place for error.  (say a \n gets stuck in there, or someone
wants to insert a debug statement to see what dir is actually being
cd'd to... maybe the partition is important due to space reasons, so a
pwd or mount or ... is added between the cd and the wget, and the
error checking semantics of && is lost in the process...)

I'm of the opinion that human error is rampant, and I don't trust my
self much more than anyone else, so when possible I design solutions
to be robust to my own stupidity.   (This is also why I hack code in
haskell, rather than python.)

Subject: [PLUG] benchmarking webserver performance ?
Message-ID: <1205872597.21008.216.camel@badger.arghwebworks.com>

I have to admit a mild stumping. 

I've gotten my boss used to the idea of "benchmarks" so that he can not
only ask "is the load high on serverX" but also "how does the load today
compare against last week's load?"  ( good boss, have a donut ). 

Now he wants me to look at a webpage on serverX and gauge the response.
On one hand, it responds quick, but on the other several included bits
( you know, graphics, javascript libraries, all that web2.0 crap ) can
take seconds to materialize. 

I think it'd be fairly easy for me to add a graph to mrtg to just
monitor how quickly the server responds ( how quickly the html starts to
come down the chute ), but how do I tell mrtg I want to know when the
last piece comes down and the page is "done" ?

Thanks :)

Russ

PLUG Advanced Topics meeting
March 19th, 2008
7:00pm - 9:00pm
Jax Bar
826 SW 2nd Avenue Portland, Oregon

Speaker:  Randal Schwartz
Topic:    Smalltalk

Sure, Smalltalk is where we got our modern view of windows and mice and "the
desktop" and object-oriented programming and extreme programming two decades
ago, but what has Smalltalk done for us *lately*?

I'll answer this by showing off the Seaside web application framework: an
open-source (but vendor supported) challenge to the classic web design
strategies.  Imagine being able to debug a broken web-hit in the middle of
the
hit, fixing the code, and continuing before the browser knows that something
went wrong.  Imagine being able to re-use control flows and web components
with the ease of OO programming.  Imagine being able to do test-driven
development, even for HTML delivery.  Imagine taking an application from
"three guys in Starbucks on a laptop" to "3000 hits per second on your Amazon
EC2 cloud" with no major changes in design.  No need to imagine... I'll
demonstrate all this and more.

Smalltalk knowledge is not required: I'll start with a brief overview of
Smalltalk using Squeak, the free implementation that's even included in the
OLPC XO.  General knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming basics would be
helpful, though.

Please note that this talk is a work in progress... this presentation is a
rehearsal for the actual delivery in mid-April in Brazil at FISL 2008.  Some
parts are still a bit rough.

Standard meeting rules apply.

FWIW, *long* ago I recruited a fellow, Ken Dickey, that gave a Squeak
talk for an Advanced Topics meeting.  Just to show how long ago, it
was held in the basement of the It's a Beautiful Pizza.  Its old
location.  My plug-list archive says it was May 2002.

Regrettably, I won't be able to make this one.

I will say, that I have a long-running freecell session running in a
Squeak image in which I've played nearly 3000 games over the course of
several years.  Can be stopped and started at will.

Question: has your boss given you a budget, or does he want you to build 
this yourself? The reason I ask is that there are quite a few good load 
testing tools out there. The two best IMHO are Borland SilkPerformer 
(which I know well) and HP/Mercury LoadRunner (which I've never 
touched). These are the expensive ones. There are also open source tools 
and less expensive commercial tools, but I'd recommend investigating the 
"name brand" tools first.

As far as knowing when "the last piece is done", that's not easy for a 
variety of reasons. Essentially you need to get fairly intimate with the 
browser, and it's highly dependent on how fast the client PC is, how 
much RAM it has, and what else it happens to be doing.

I know Randal is as pedantically touchy about the number of concluding

one and Russell has two.

That's one useful metric. I try not to confuse the PHBs with too many
metrics, but you might enjoy others.

You can get this from your logs.

What is the purpose of this measurement? Log analysis will tell you
more than just page load time.

There are a ton of tools that can do load, stress, and performance
testing.  Silk is fine if you have bucks to spare and time to write the
scripts.  I haven't worked with it since 1999, and I'm sure it has
changed. But I also worked with it when it was in beta (1994) and there
was not a big delta to 1999.

You could actually script a real browser (Selenium, Watir), but it would
have to be on a network that is representative of the networks your
customer/clients are using. Better to use the data already being
collected in the log.

How about Cricket or if you don't want to use the logs for some reason,
Jmeter or httperf or something from this page:

There are lots of reasons besides raw performance that, for example, 
images take seconds to load.

I think you're going to need a lot more data than just that if there is 
a delay found. I'm shooting from the hip here as I need to leave for 
work 5 minutes ago, but have you heard of Cacti? It's quite verbose in 
it's graphing and also splunk. Watch the demo videos for splunk.

Cacti and Cricket both have as their underlying data collection 
mechanism a rather nifty tool called RRDtool. In some ways, RRDtool and 
Cricket or Cacti are the successors to mrtg. However, they are simply 
analysis and data collection tools. You still have to be able to measure 
the quantities of interest and get them into the database somehow. :)

Watir (or FireWatir if you're using Firefox) is probably the closest 
you're going to get in the open source world to something that can be 
made to measure end-to-end response time from the point of view of the 
browser, but even those tools are going to have difficulty measuring 
*everything* on the client end if your application isn't pretty vanilla 
about how it deals with the browser. The "richer" your application, the 
less likely it is that an open source tool is going to be able to help 
you. In the end, you may end up biting a rather expensive bullet called 
WinRunner. :)

Jes (one of the other owners) gave a similar answer when I asked her last
month.

Do people want to switch to Jax?  It is much quieter and it has a better
alcohol selection.  (As well as more food, but no peanuts.)

It's an easy walk from PSU.  The experience of the Advanced Topics meeting has
been great.  I think the switch would be good.

This from an AP wire story:

Verizon Wireless, a joint venture between Verizon Communications Inc. and
British telecom giant Vodaphone Group, won nearly every license in the
consumer-friendly "C block."

The spectrum, which encompasses about a third of the spectrum at auction, is
subject to "open access" provisions pushed by FCC Chairman Kevin Martin,
meaning users of the network will be able to use whatever phones or software
they wish.

So now Verizon is on the hook to provide open service.

Thanks, to all of your responses.

The boss's old concept of "metric" is just the load, and then he uses
"top" to figure out what the problem could be. I do enjoy others :) And
I'm introducing him to the concept of histories and baselines.

I use mrtg-rrd for his servers, and cacti in another role at another
position.  What I'm looking for is a graph to be able to show him "yes,
response time is slowed down overall" or "this is a sudden drop in
response time and it corresponds to this other graph's spike here." 

He's not given me a budget, but then I haven't asked for one either. I'm
just using mrtg/mrtg-rrd to make some pretty graphs so he can see where
we stand.  For instance, the "storage server's" drive might have vast
tracts of land open, but it's increased 5 percent in usage over the past
two weeks, and is at 95 percent now.  You know, some sort of thing so he
can judge necessary resources.

So, really, I'm trying to figure out a few metrics to look at on his web
server to determine how slowly it's responding to requests.  

I suppose I could create a single base file and graph the download time
of that one file, as well as how long the server takes to acknowledge me
asking for it. I was thinking about using the index page of the main
site on the server; then they could see how changes to the index page
affects the performance.  If I use the single file, the size of the data
will always be the same.  Maybe what I should do is use a wget script
that downloads the index page and the requisites and just time the
length of time that script takes to process.

What I'm aiming at is something along the lines of "a customer places
the order within 4 minutes and his meal is delivered within 25" -- but
in webserver terms. I want to know when the meal is delivered.

Thanks again.

Subject: [PLUG] common authentication for small server/web site?
Message-ID: <47E6DB26.90401@seitzassoc.com>

I'm setting up a new server for our office of ~12 people.  In the past 
I have always just used /etc/shadow and /etc/samba/smbpasswd for 
authentication.  With the new server I plan to run additional 
apache-based services.  I'd like to make some of these services, such 
as squirrelmail, available on the net via https.  The apache 
documentation that I've seen discourages the use of /etc/shadow for 
web-based authentication.  If I want to avoid having authentication 
info duplicated across multiple files, etc., is ldap my best option? 
This is on a Centos 5 machine.  Some of the services I want to run are:

ssh
samba
imap
https
squirrelmail
subversion(probably via webdav)
trac (web-based bug tracking)

I'd prefer to stick with Redhat/Centos delivered packages for 
authentication, as I will have less visibility of security issues that 
occur with unofficial packages.

thanks,

I give thumbs up to LDAP. I've used it for several years without a hitch.
Redhat has an enterprise ldap server package but I'm not sure how well its
maintained.

Apache and linux both will also make use of Kerberos for authentication, 
LDAP is really a namespace for authorization and directory information 
rather than a secure password repository.  Subversion and samba can also 
use Kerberos for authentication.

It's not included with CentOS/RHEL, so you may dismiss it out of hand, 
but I've had good luck with mod_authn_sasl, which will allow Apache to 
authenticate against system accounts via the SASL libraries. I'll be 
happy to provide a .spec file for building an RPM if you need one.

If you've got SELinux enabled, you'll have to allow the httpd binary 
to read various items with saslauthd_* security contexts. Module 
available on request. :-)

As long as you set up HTTPS for any password-protected areas of your 
web site, your users' passwords should be fairly well protected.

You can also use SASL for doing SMTP AUTH with Sendmail...

According to the list I'm looking at, openldap is in everything from 
Redhat 6.2 through RHEL 5.

Now, auth_ldap is not included past 7.3, but I'm sure there's some way 
to use ldap authentication with apache.

Got a meeting right now, so I can't look myself.

Not sure about the spca50x module, but I've had reasonable success
with the version of "quickcam_messenger" that's included in the Debian
(stable) 2.6.18 kernel. The images are of barely acceptable quality
(320x240 pixels, low sensitivity, poor dynamic range).  I doubt that's
the fault of the kernel module, though.

I use an app called "vgrabbj" that accesses the QuickCam via the V4L
interface. The following short shell script will take a photo (crappy
though it may be) and imprint it with the date/time:

DEVICE=/dev/video0
WIDTH=320
HEIGHT=240
FONT=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-bitstream-vera/VeraMono.ttf
TIMESTAMPFORMAT='%a, %Y %B %e %T'
OUTFILE=$(date +'%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')-qc.jpeg

vgrabbj -d $DEVICE -w $WIDTH -H $HEIGHT    \

My original post was obviously not clear; I apologize. I was talking

CentOS/RHEL.

Subject: [PLUG] How to create flash files
Message-ID: <20080324124444.d7fab211.johnxj@comcast.net>

All I know about flash is how to get it working in browsers on Ubuntu.
I've always generally disliked flash on web sites, but now I find
myself wanting to create a simple little flash image for a web site I
am working on. Basically all I want is a little box (like for text
entry on a form), and I want IPA characters scrolling across it like a
ticker tape. Note that I do not want to become a flash expert, as this
is probably the only flash image I will want to create in my entire
life. I just want the quick and dirty, get 'er done approach.

I have no idea where to begin. Are there open source tools to do this?
Do I have to buy something from Adobe? If so, can I make it run on
Linux somehow? Are there any good tutorials? Any pointers and
suggestions welcome.

Quick and dirty: You are better off using the Flash program. You could
probably do what you described in a few minutes using the gui. If you have a
windows or mac, just download the *free Flash CS3 30 day trial from Adobe's
site. 30 days should be enough to create the only Flash file of your life ;)
Sounds like you need a basic 'time-line animation'.

Open source: If you want something free, that runs well in a Linux
environment, I recommend the Flex SDK which is open source, free. You feed
the mxmlc compiler an Actionscript 3 file, and out comes a swf (yes, pretty
f'in cool). However, you would have to learn Actionscript 3  (or MXML (ugh))
to Tween the said image or text. Older versions of flash will run in Wine
but I wouldn't even bother if you have a simple project (besides, older
versions of Flash program create less efficient swf's, since the Flash
Player has improved a lot). Running it in Wine is not free or open source,
unless think adobe has enough money already. Can explain this in more detail
to anybody who is interested in setting this up.

I would also recommend creating a form in html, as opposed to inside the
swf, just to make it easier.

If all else fails, just be nice to me and I'll do it for you.

If the IPA characters can be entitized or represented in unicode (and it 
looks like you can: http://linguiste.org/phonetics/ipa/chart/) you can 
do something like this and can avoid flash:
http://www.gcmingati.net/wordpress/wp-content/lab/jquery/newsticker/jq-liscroll/scrollanimate.html

And you don't need to tell me how disappointing it is that "IPA" in this 
case has nothing to do with beer.

Ah. I'd be interested in that. I use Apple OpenDirectory, an oddly 
opaque OpenLDAP implementation. It works, quite well actually, at 
providing central authentication for Windows, Mac, and Linux. (Solaris 
9 and 10, not so much. It can see users and groups, but it doesn't 
know how to deal with OD's password scheme.)

The trouble is its opacity. When something goes awry, debugging is 
difficult.

The other trouble is that the password-server module seems to be tied 
to a specific host (or perhaps hostname). Restoring passwords from 
backups to another host is seemingly impossible.

Thanks for the suggestion. 

I started out trying Kurt's suggestion of using the demo of Flash from
Adobe. I have Windows 2000 installed under VirtualBox, so I fired it
up, downloaded the demo, and installed it. And then when I went to
launch it the stupid thing announced that it required XP or later and I
would have to upgrade my operating system. There must be pigs a-flyin'
in Adobe-land.

So the liScroll thing looks like the path of least resistance.
Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out what to do with it from the web
site. It looks like I'll have to take a course in Javascript and
another in HTML before I can do it.

The website I am working on is at pbwiki, and it allows plugins:

http://ipa4linguists.pbwiki.com/FrontPage

I just don't know what part of liScroll is which. I do know how to
create the IPA characters in HTML - ? is &#x1dd; and so on. The
liScroll web site says it needs an unordered list. Everything in my
life is unordered, so that should be easy enough. I downloaded the
jquer.li-scroller.1.0.js. I assume I am supposed to upload it to my
website. But where does the list of IPA characters go?

Ahh, well, if you're on pbwiki I think you're out of luck on the 
javascript front, and maybe on the flash front too, but I can't tell 
from my quick glance at their website.	If it was in a regular ol' 
webpage either solution would work (though I think the fastest and 
easiest is the JS one); email me off-list if you'd like help getting it 
set up outside of pbwiki though.

the recent Advanced Topics meeting. I was thrilled at the time, as it
worked great. Except that I have just discovered that my efforts do not
work at all in Internet Explorer. (But I just have IE 6 on Windows 2000.)

Could someone who has Internet Explorer look at this page and tell me
if 1) the IPA characters appear correctly and, 2) if the icons have
transparent backgrounds. And if either answer is no, do you have any
idea how to fix Internet Explorer or the icons?

Thanks for the feedback.

I just converted one of the PNGs to GIF with the Gimp and used it to
replace the PNG on the site. Then I viewed it with IE 6 under Windows
2000 (in VirtualBox) and the replaced image looks fine. So it appears
your advice is sound. Now I'll replace all the others.

Re the text, that is a major headache for us. The page is set to
Verdana and all the characters look fine in Firefox, Opera and
Konqueror. But they don't look right in my IE6 either. I need to figure
out how to reconfigure IE6 (and IE7) so they appear properly. Or if it
turns out that it is absolutely impossible, then I want to know what is
wrong with IE so I can say so on the web site, and then tell them just
to go get Firefox or Opera.

Couple things. Don't resize images in HTML. It makes them look horrible. 
I see jaggie edges on all of them. I don't know about Gimp, but 
Photoshop would resample on a resize and make them look better. Then set 
the size in HTML natively. This is all more noticeable on the larger 
icons on the right.

Also, transparent backgrounds that are made for white don't look good on 
black. So what that means is when making a transparent gif, use a matte 
color that is the same as your (average if more than one) background 
color so the anti-aliased edges look better. In short, this makes the 
transparency blend better with the background.

That's interesting. In every case the original images uploaded to the
site were larger and then made smaller in HTML. That should never
create jaggies. I can't see a single jaggy on any of them. Maybe it's
because I have a 15.4" laptop screen at 1680 x 1050. But I have viewed
them all on screens at PSU computer labs and they also appeared nice
and sharp.

I also can't see any of this either. I may have not done a super job of
fixing the edges of the paths, but I was in a hurry. We're just trying
to create an ordinary site with acceptable graphics in order to explain
to linguistics students and professors how to use IPA on their
computers. We're not going for a Nobel prize in web design here.

But if anyone else sees these problems and it appears bad enough to
spend the time to fix, let me know. The site is

I have a 1680x1050 screen and see the icons pretty jagged.   It doesn't look
horrible, but not a smooth sleek edge.  I agree with the idea of resizing in
an actual photo program instead of letting html distort them.  Usually turns
out much better if no changes are needed, and besides, bad design policy to
make someone download a picture larger than they're actually looking at.
It's just a waste of bandwidth.

That's most likely it. You have a small monitor at very high resolution 
for the size. It doesn't surprise me that you don't see the jaggies, but 
for the rest of the world, you might want to look at it on a 17 or 19" 
display around 1024xSomething. Like you, I love that kind of resolution, 
but the reality is most don't, and you might want to consider who else 
is visiting the site.

I don't see myself as ultra-picky. But I do notice these things because 
I do a few sites and guess I just picked it up along the way.

> I also can't see any of this either.

Well, the resizing is most of what I see. The matte thing may not be an 
issue if the sizing is fixed. Tux isn't too bad, but the Apple is 
noticeable and the Windows logo is really jaggy to me. When viewing the 
actual gif it looks like someone tried to do some cleanup. The blue and 
yellow panes have stuff wrong with the edges.

Don't worry about me. If you're happy with it then that's all that 
matters. :)

Subject: [PLUG] Intel Trusted Execution Technology
Message-ID: <20080326062956.GA1093@gate.kl-ic.com>


I went to the Intel Trusted Computing Technology talk by David
Grawrock.  It looks interesting, and the presenter made frequent
mentions of it being Operating System / Virtualizer agnostic,
and not aimed at Digital Rights Misappropriation.  A lot of
it was above my head, but the gist of it is:

32K of cache is reserved for an Authenticated Code Module, or ACM,
which is designed by Intel to work with a particular chipset.  The
ACM pulls a public key out of the ICH chip ( IO Controller Hub,
aka the Southbridge), and ACM code of the disk.  The ACM software
comes from Intel, and is signed with their private key.  If the
ACM code does not properly validate, the machine reboots.

When the ACM is validated, a typical function for it is to 
load something called a Launch Control Policy list, which
contains signatures for the code that gets loaded next.  It
wasn't really clear how the LCP list is built, but there can
be two sets of policies - PS or Platform Supplier (the system
manufacturer) as well as the PO or Platform Owner (the
corporate or personal owner of the individual machine).  The
PS policies are default, but the PO policies can override them.

Intel is working closely with the Xen folk.  The Xen 3.2
hypervisor is one of the first things they are building PS
lists for, so future Intel machines may load Xen first,
then use that to load virtualized operating systems next.

There is nothing in the system that prevents hardware hackers
taking over the machine;  the public key can be intercepted over
the wires from Southbridge to CPU.   Instead, the idea is to
hinder remote software threats, while allowing machine owners
to control their own hardware.  

I'm a little worried about protection for the private key.  It
is a "three out of six" layered key;  Intel stores portions of
the key at 6 guarded sites, and three of the sites must be used
to do the private key signing on new ACM code.  So the bad guys
must be able to access 3 of those sites to compromise the key,
or destroy 4 of the sites to make it impossible to update the
ACM code.  Since one can expect some common mode failures, and
the benefits to some bad guys could be huge, I wonder how much
it would cost to do those accesses.  Still, it is not as wussy
as an unlayered single private key stored in three places.  

There is more information in the book "Intel Safer Computing
Initiative", 2006 Intel Press, David Grawrock with a forward
by Eugene Spafford, ISBN 0976483262 .  He also mentioned an
open-source TXT related project on Sourceforge, which may be
this:  http://sourceforge.net/projects/tboot/
Ted Kubaska was also there; he picked up a lot of things I
missed.  I hope somebody gets the book and checks this thing
out more completely.

I hope they got this right.   It is possible I missed something,
and the bad guys can use this for software or vendor lockin or
DRM in some way, but Grawrock seemed to be wearing a hat that
was at worst a light shade of gray.

I've never run into that problem as I (in GIMP and PS in the past)
always used layers and kept the "background" on a separate layer and
used it only for viewing the work.  With the main image on it's own
layer and having the BG for that layer as transparent, it does a generic
dithering that, if you zoom in on it, makes the the dithered pixels a
gradient transparent instead of what ever BG you would have normally
done it with.

My $0.02, YMMV, feel free to ignore ;)

Thanks to everyone for their suggestions.  I decided to go the ldap 
route.  I now have sshd, postfix, dovecot, apache, squirrelmail, 
subversion, viewvc, and trac running on my Centos 5 machine with user 
and group data contained in ldap.  I have yet to integrate samba. 
Here are the two links I found to be the most useful:

http://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/5.1/Deployment_Guide/ch-ldap.html
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-openldap/index.html

One gotcha that I encountered was that slapd requires a file named 
DB_CONFIG in /var/lib/ldap.  It took a while before I stumbled onto a 
link that explained the problem.  Note that the file should be edited 
to better suit your requirements.

   cp /etc/openldap/DB_CONFIG.example /var/lib/ldap/DB_CONFIG
   vi /var/lib/DB_CONFIG

A second ugly bit was my caused by my desire to support both svn+ssh 
and http access to subversion.  This requires running apache with a 
umask of 002 in order to avoid permission problems.  It's somewhat 
ugly to change the umask because apache can be started by either 
apachectl or /etc/init.d/httpd.  I didn't want to have to touch either 
one of these, much less both.  Instead, I hacked a Mandriva spec file, 
and built and installed an rpm for an apache module call mod_umask.

Now, of course, I have more questions, but I'll start a new thread for 
those.

thanks,
galen

Subject: [PLUG] recommended ldap tools
Message-ID: <47EBD131.5050007@seitzassoc.com>

What tools are recommended for manipulating user and group data stored 
in ldap?  I'm looking for ldap replacements for the following:

useradd
userdel
vigr or groupadd and groupdel
vipw

I've tried passwd, and it seems to be doing the right thing, but 
useradd definitely does not.

Do the redhat gui tools for user and group management work properly in 
an ldap environment?

Note that this is for a very small ldap deployment(< 30 users).

thanks,
galen

I'm a big fan of ldapvi. Allows you to make changes just like you were
editing a text file.

http://lam.sourceforge.net is a web based ldap manager

I can't find the link right now but I also use perl script I found that can
be used as a drop in replacement for passwd.

Subject: [PLUG] Partition failing to unmount at shutdown
Message-ID: <430790.42990.qm@web56607.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

I've got an EeePC laptop running Ubuntu Gutsy. I installed an 8GB SD module, and formated it as ext2. My problem is that when I shut down, for some reason it does not unmount, causing me to have to fsck the drive each time I boot again. How can I tell Ubuntu to automatically unmount it at shutdown?

As a work-around, I created an entry in /etc/fstab with the intent of keeping it from automatically mounting. However it still mounts automatically upon booting. The following is my /etc/fstab entry:

/dev/sdb1   /home/svanhoosen/data   ext2   rw/user/noauto/exec  0  0

So my second question is, why does mount automatically with this setting?

Hi Scott,


Looks like you might have a syntax error in this line.  I'm not familiar
with separating options with '/' characters.  Normally you'd use ',' for
it, though perhaps some systems support '/'.  Try changing this line:

> /dev/sdb1   /home/svanhoosen/data   ext2   rw/user/noauto/exec  0  0

to:

 /dev/sdb1   /home/svanhoosen/data   ext2   rw,user,noauto,exec  0  0

or something thereabouts.

HTH,

Do you mean it mounts automatically when the card is inserted? This is
usually a function the Free Desktop features, some partially dependent
on GNOME or KDE implementation. It is probably a bug that it doesn't
unmount when you shut down; have you tweaked the startup at all?
Something like the dbus daemon might not be running, which I think is
used to pass a message to the desktop that the system is shutting down.
Is this a regular Ubuntu install or one of the ones tailored for the
EeePC?

You need commas to separate the options, not slashes:
rw,user,noauto,exec

Oh, you're right about the typo, but that error is just in my e-mail, not the file. I miss-typed it into the e-mail, rather than a copy/paste.

Wil,

It mounts automatically at boot-up, though it also will auto-mount if I insert the card later.

It is a standard install of Gusty from a USB CDROM, with only a hand-full of tweaks: installed wireless driver, a couple of tweaks Gnome to better fit the small screen using gconftool-2, and re-ordering of some start-up files, as follows:

sudo mv /etc/rc2.d/S12hal /etc/rc2.d/S13hal
sudo mv /etc/rc3.d/S12hal /etc/rc3.d/S13hal
sudo mv /etc/rc4.d/S12hal /etc/rc4.d/S13hal
sudo mv /etc/rc5.d/S12hal /etc/rc5.d/S13hal

I followed the tutorial here:
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EeePC

Wow, I wasn't aware people were still running windows 2000... Sorry for that
gotcha, I didn't use a computer until XP was heavily in use, so I never even
thought of running Flash on W2000. Adobe probably doesn't care too much
about running it on older versions, since they seem only concerned with
making money. I've tried installs of XP on VirtualBox and couldn't get it
running, but apparently other people have without any problems... so if
you're thinking of upgrading to XP, running Flash (amongst other Adobe
products) would be another good reason. I have to run Vista on my hp tx1000
just for the Adobe products. A lot of my friends are running XP or Vista
just for design tools, and it's such a nuisance, I wish Adobe would pull
their heads out of their asses and release the Creative Suite 3 for Linux.

   I've been using the AXS Visitor Tracking System for several years now, and
it does a sufficiently good job of showing who visits our web site. But, it
does not have the ability to tally downloads of PDF files there.

   I am curious which ones are downloaded, and by whom (at least by domain or
IP address). Is there a tool that will do this tracking?

No, because it turns out that the pbwiki site blocks it anyway. So I just discarded the whole notion.

You could use PCC's computers, since they have Flash CS3 installed. I could

Thanks for the offer, but I have more important stuff to get done. Here is the site I am working on:

http://ipa4linguists.pbwiki.com/FrontPage

See the sidebar? All I wanted to do was put a marquee with IPA characters scrolling across at the top of the sidebar. But as far as I can tell pbwiki blocks such content, so no matter what I do I won't be able to get it working. I tried several things on a test page. They were code snips I got from the web, but to none worked.

It's not a big deal.

As far as I know, I am still scheduled to talk about the OLPC XO at the 
April meeting. But I haven't received any confirmation of that. Is it in 
the "usual place" at Portland State on the first Thursday, which would 
be April 3rd? I need to get this nailed down as soon as possible -- I 
want to invite all the rest of the local XO people!

If pbwiki blocks swf's (which is what I assume you are referring to when you
say 'such content'), then maybe a animated gif will work?

Bill,

   I just looked again, and don't see that it will provide the information
I'd like that AXS doesn't provide. Surficially AWstats provides the same log
summaries as does AXS. There may be a plugin, however, so I will investigate
further.

Thanks,

It looks like I am going to need another laptop.  This one is near dead.
(It overheats if the cpu runs for more than a minute at full speed.)

What I am looking for is something that has a good warranty, is light, has
an AMD dual core processor, a fast video card with lots of ram and is not
over $2000.

I am looking at a couple of HPs.  I have ruled out Lenovo.  (They don't
have the graphics card I need.)  Dell is overpriced for what I want.

Are there other brands I should look at?  I don't know who has a good
warranty for accidental breakage these days.

Ideas? Suggestions?

Just curious, why AMD dual core?  How about an Alien laptop.  I recall that
they used good graphic cards and even allowed a design where you could
replace the card with newer ones.

Because the AMD processors have a much bigger cache.  I want to be able to
run VMWare with the hardware acceleration.  I also want 64bit.

Depending on your portability requirements, Lenovo may still have
hardware that will work.  The high-end line of laptop docks offers
PCIe slots (one full-height, one half-height) as well as a host of
other goodies.

http://shop.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/e/web/LenovoPortal/en_US/catalog.workflow:item.detail?GroupID=38&Code=250310U&current-category-id=34851FD360E5473EB9DFEB639312E18E

You can put a full-power video card in there, and use it when docked,
yet still have low-power portability and a Thinkpad :) (I'll try not
to preach about the benefits of the later here... ;)  Of course, if
you need high-end graphics while on the move, this won't work, and you
will likely be pushing $2k to get the machine you want, the dock, the
video card and the monitor.. (I'm assuming the PCIe will only drive
external video... ;)

We just got in a bunch of Dell Vostro 1700s that are Intel dual-core and
they have IVT. VMware Server even noticed that I had turned it off in
BIOS (troubleshooting a different problem) and suggested I turn it on.
Aren't all the mainstream x86 processors these days 64-bit?

These Vostros were remarkably inexpensive and have really nice screens
(with the WUXGA upgrade). I just ran through a configuration, 1.4GHz
dual-core, 2GB RAM and it came to $959.

They're not light though and 17" won't fit in most back packs.

Many P4s are.  But if you want to be sure, boot linux and run this:

$ grep -qw lm /proc/cpuinfo && echo 64-bit CPU || echo 32-bit CPU

When I upgrade it to the level of the HP I am looking at it is about $600
more.

AMD Turions have 1MB L2 (512KB per core), the new Intel Penryns have
4MB (2MB per core). Dunno about L1 cache.

FWIW, Dell has a 30% off coupon on laptops over $1299, 
ref http://bensbargains.net/merchants/6/Dell-Home-Coupons/

Without such coupons, I quite agree Dell is overpriced, though some of 
the deals at Costco are OK (which is where I got my dual core T7200).

Thanks,
Mike

i'm on my second Sager (i.e., Clevo) - my wife got the first one when 
her old Gateway began dying. Clevo is a Korean white-box manufacturer, 
Sager adds disk, ram, video, etc. You can buy direct from Sager or from 
PC Torque or XoticPC - i got one from PC Torque, the other from XotciPC, 
both provide great service and more options than buying directly from 
Sager. Alienware and other gamer-oriented VARs base some of their 
laptops on Sager. Best of all - the OS is optional, you can buy just the 
hardware, and they include drivers for Windows & Linux. You can get 
quite a high-performance machine with a great display in the $2k 
neighborhood.

my current model is the Sager NP5793/Clevo M570RU - a 17" screen beauty 
with a fast Core 2 Duo.

http://www.xoticpc.com/sager-np5793-custom-laptop-built-clevo-m570ruu-m571ruu-p-2276.html

Some Sager/Clevo models offer an AMD option. It's more of a portable 
desktop replacement than a notebook, but it's great for development. 
This one comes with NVidia video, which is much more Gnome- and 
Compiz-friendly than the ATI hardware in my previous model. Between the 
two i've owned, i've sucessfully run OpenSUSE, RedHat, Fedora, and 
Ubuntu with no major problems *except for Hibernate/Sleep features*. i 
can get Hibernate to work intermittently on my current machine, and 
can't figure out why it's intermittent.

Before making these purchases i did an exhaustive comparison of features 
& price with IBM/Lenovo, HP, Dell, Toshiba, and others. Sager/Clevo was 
the best value for the features i wanted.

Asus sells some nice laptoips with Linux pre-loaded & certified - and 
they all have working hibernate/sleep.

Well no one has said it yet but for that price look at macs. I have a  
very nice one for about 1300 after adding an after market hd and  
memory. It runs OS X, Linux, or xp. (probably vista too i haven't  
checked)

I have both good and bad support for the apple store and great support  
from some of the athorized stores

Alan,
I bought an Acer Aspire from a big box retailer just over a year ago and
while it did just recently give up the ghost it met most of your
requirements I believe as it was an AMD dual core system. It was cheap (sub
700) with a 15.4 inch display and ran Linux without a hitch even with the
included ATi video .. which with recent releases of the proprietary drivers
makes eye candy with compiz very easy.

HTH,
Drew-

No. He said that he needs a system with specific requirements:

"What I am looking for is something that has a good warranty, is light, has
an AMD dual core processor, a fast video card with lots of ram and is not
over $2000."

What about an animated GIF?  pbwiki will serve it and anyone can view it.

That's an interesting idea. But I'd have to learn how to do it. I'll see how much time I have. The group has decided that we're going public on Monday morning, so we're all finishing our final edits and stuff. The marquee is optional at this point. Of course, we can also add it later too.

I did finally manage to create an object using the pbwiki tools that does what I want. You can see it on our test page:

http://ipa4linguists.pbwiki.com/test

It works fine on the regular pages, but when I put it on the sidebar it does not appear. Of course, the sidebar is the only logical place to put it. :(

Just now I downloaded a free animated GIF from somewhere on the web and
stuck it on our sidebar. It appears fine, so evidently pbwiki does not
block animated GIFs on the sidebar. Now all I have to do is learn how
to make one with scrolling IPA. 

I have pretty much all the open source graphics tools installed,
including Xara Extreme, Krita, Inkscape and the Gimp. If I fire up
Windows I can use CorelDRAW 9, Illustrator 10 or Photoshop 7. Can any
of these do it?

The gimp can make animated gifs.  There are probably lots of tutorials
out there, but this is the first one google turned up, and it looks
fairly simple:

http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Simple_Animations/

If the instructions don't perfectly match your version of the gimp you
may want to google for a different one.  (Gimp's menu system was
reorganized in a recent version, so some tutorials are not perfectly
accurate -- usually you just have to hunt a bit for the menu entry)

i forgot to mention that i also looked Mac laptops in addition to other 
big names. A Mac laptop with equivalent CPU, screen, video card, RAM, 
and disk cost $1500 more than the Sager, and, as much as i like the OS 
comes with software i don't really need, and i'd end up paying for OS 
upgrades. i've owned 4 Macs in the past and loved them, but...

I always recommend IBM Thinkpads. I bought my IBM T61 Thinkpad (Dual core
Intel) about a year ago now.
I ordered a relatively base model, about $1,000. I then proceeded to get
upgrades myself (160gig drive, 4gigs RAM) for an additional couple hundred
bucks.

This laptop is a tank, I've dropped it, sat on it, tripped on the power cord
and yanked it across the room end over end. I even tossed it on my bed,
which acted as a trampoline and threw the laptop into the air, and a couple
feet onto the floor...
Good times had by all, I'll tell ya!

It also runs Ubuntu pretty well (but, linux still has poor power management
across the board).

IBM/Lenovo still makes the best business laptop out there, for the right
price, in my opinion. Others come close, but don't close the deal.
I would shy away from Dell and Apple, solely based on their build quality
(both have junk build quality from my experience). Though I do like OSX.

HP also makes a mean laptop, but I am not familiar enough with their newer
models anymore.

ya, i own a mac laptop too, along w/ 2 extra motherboards and 3 extra
batteries. lots of fun if you like to ship back to the manufacturer
and wait while mac force and apple ship it back and forth to each
other trying to figure out the issue

i have a new lenovo t61p from emperorlinux

emperorlinux was holding off the shipping for 2 weeks, and they didnt
say why. finally, they said their hardware tests were failing since
lenovo had switched out something in the hardware. they finally sent
it w/o perfecting it after i just said i was a hacker :) or sorts

now, when it hibernates, it wont come back up. so let me know if you
have insight. otherwise, i'll grab the next kernel from them that
matches the latest hardware when comes available

also, i'll try dropping it and let you know what happens. soon or later

Thanks for bringing this back on track.  The good warranty is key;
laptops are tradeoffs, between cost, capability, and reliability.
( "cheap, fast, good - pick two" ).  Alan's price range suggests
that he is willing to pay extra for "fast, good", which shows some
intelligence IMHO. 

I am typing this on a 6 year old IBM T30; it has been repaired three
times but works fine with very heavy use.  The only real problem is
that it is beginning to fall off the back of the Linux driver support
curve - all the drivers work with the 1 year old distro I am using,
but I expect there will be upgrade issues when they stop supporting
this distro 3 years from now. I paid about $1800 for it, and another
$300 for warranty extensions, and that is a much better bargain than
$800 for a junker every 18 months.  Unless filling Chinese landfills
with production debris is part of the attraction of new ...

One of the problems with Linux is that it sometimes takes a while for
the drivers to show up, unless you are really careful to check out
chipset support before purchase ( see http://www.linux-laptop.net/
and http://www.thinkwiki.org/ among others ).  So the sweet spot for
drivers is approximately between 6 months and 5 years after the
appearance of a new laptop.  The junker-every-18-months approach
actually means about 30% of the time you are chasing drivers and
upgrades.  If you gotta, you gotta, but that isn't something I try for.

Alan wants to run AMD - not my choice, and not as popular, but he is
invested in AMD already and I am glad there is someone smart like Alan
supporting that portion of the community.  Since AMD is usually the 
"cheaper" choice, it may be harder to find a high-support good-warranty
laptop with that processor family.  I hope he succeeds, because without
AMD to compete with them, Intel will slack off and abuse customers.
Hooray for the "loyal opposition"!

The bottom line may be that Alan will end up doing his own hardware
maintenance after an inadequate warranty expires.  There are a lot
of part sources out there for repairing laptops ( for example, 
www.acsparts.com , and broken laptops on Ebay ) , and there are
communities of users that do so.  Laptops are more difficult to work
on than desktops, and the parts are more specialized and expensive,
but skilled user maintenance is possible.  Alan's particular problem
(a CPU that overheats) is possibly a problem with the cooling fan,
and sometimes a simple cleaning is enough to get those working again.

If we make arrangements, we can have the big room at Jax for afters.
When I broached this a couple of weeks ago, reactions were positive.
Should we go ahead at Jax, and announce that when we announce the
PLUG general meeting for Thursday April 3?

Bill,

   I just looked again, and don't see that it will provide the information
I'd like that AXS doesn't provide. Surficially AWstats provides the same log
summaries as does AXS. There may be a plugin, however, so I will investigate
further.

Thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] FYI switching DVI connected flat panels(wrong panel size)
Message-ID: <47F10808.2040201@seitzassoc.com>

I purchased a new widescreen LCD for my home system yesterday. 
Hooking it up ought to be simple, right?  I managed to waste a couple 
of hours trying to get it working at its native resolution.  For those 
in a hurry, the short answer is that you may need to reboot in order 
to get the higher resolution.

My old display is a 1280 x 1024 LCD connected via DVI to an Nvidia 
6200 video card.  I'm using the free Xorg nv driver.  The new display 
is 1920 x 1200.  I unboxed the new display, disconnected the DVI from 
the old display and connected it to the new one.  As I expected, the 
display was a stretched 1280x1024.  I logged out to cause the X server 
to restart.  Upon restart, the X server was still operating at the 
lower resolution.  No amount of fiddling with xorg.conf would get it 
to run at the higher resolution.  Xorg.0.log showed that it thought 
the panel was still 1280x1024.

(--) NV(0): CRTC 0 is currently programmed for DFP
(II) NV(0): Using DFP on CRTC 0
(--) NV(0): Panel size is 1280 x 1024

I could see timing for the higher resolution, but with the driver 
thinking the panel was 1280x1024, it would throw out all higher 
resolutions.

(II) NV(0): Supported additional Video Mode:
(II) NV(0): clock: 154.0 MHz   Image Size:  518 x 324 mm
(II) NV(0): h_active: 1920  h_sync: 1968  h_sync_end 2000 h_blank_end 
2080 h_border: 0
(II) NV(0): v_active: 1200  v_sync: 1203  v_sync_end 1209 v_blanking: 
1235 v_border: 0
...
(II) NV(0): Modeline "1920x1200"  154.00  1920 1968 2000 2080  1200 
1203 1209 1235 -hsync +vsync
...
(II) NV(0): Not using default mode "1920x1200" (exceeds panel dimensions)

A few of my searches mentioned the video BIOS and the lack of 
modesetting in the nv driver, so I decided to trim out the junk I put 
into xorg.conf and reboot my system.  Success!  Rebooting cured the 
problem.  I believe the issue is that the video BIOS configures the 
panel settings when it runs at boot time.  The nv driver uses whatever 
settings are made available by video bios, as it doesn't know how to 
configure the DVI timing itself(aka no modesetting).  Thus, a reboot 
is necessary when trying to drive a new panel at a resolution/timing 
that was not supported by the previous panel.

I don't know whether any of this is applicable to the nvidia, ati, 
intel, or other drivers.

Subject: [PLUG] Xubuntu Startup Fails
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0803311040590.22838@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   My wife's laptop runs Xubuntu-7.10. Now and then (very rarely) Xfce fails
to start the panel when X starts. In other distributions, a right-click on
the root window brings up a menu of available applications. This allows me
to select a virtual terminal and manually type 'xfce4-panel &'. This brings
up the panel and retains it in the session settings for the next time.

   However, right-clicking on the root window brings up a limited menu. I
tried selecting the 'create launcher' option, and typing 'xterm' in the
command line, but the dialog box's 'OK' button remained greyed out. So, no
virtual console.

   Do any of you ubuntu gurus have a suggestion on how to open a terminal so
I can manually start the Xfce panel?

Rich

Actually in all honesty I've been rather put off by the distro because they
keep spamming the PLUG list.  I joined the plug list for discussion and to
be part of the community, although it's semi-interesting that someone made
their own linux distro I wouldn't ever try it because I get enough spam and
have no interest supporting the practice of hijacking a perfectly good list
for pushing their own commercial interests.

I don't mean to offend anyone--however I find it repulsive every time I get
these emails and it makes my interest turn to zero.  By "commerical
interests" I mean ads on the front page (adbrite?), selling stickers,
selling computer repair services, and probably more that I missed.  Also the
consumer reviews (honest and unbiased?) and yet at the same time say to use
only specific hardware (I watched the first video on the site).  Where as
all over linux distros have no preference to hardware and try and work with
as much hardware as possible.  That's not unbiased...

Anyway, I find these emails annoying..and I'm surprised no one else has said
anything.

But I could be wrong (it happens all the time)..again I mean no offense.

Cheap laptops die faster.

I have found that a warranty that fixes problems "no questions asked" is
worth the extra money.  (And if you don't buy it, you are punished by the
gods with a smashed laptop.)

The fans do not appear to be clogged.  I think that the heatsinks are
lifting off the CPU.  (It only started doing this after the motherboard was
replaced and has gotten worse over time.)

I plan on getting a new one and the old one will get recycled into an MP3
player/streaming media box for the living room.

In-Reply-To: <004101c89386$3d27fa30$9e02a8c0@MichaelFunk>
Message-ID: <968859.22545.qm@web512.biz.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I would like to mention that there were some problems with the original torrent files and now the ones available at www.ultumix.com are ready.

As far as what Ultumix GNU/Linux 0.0.1.5 has to offer it's a KDE based distro based on Linux Mint KDE 4.0 but without the stuff that scares away GNU/Linux users. Recently I got an e-mail about it from one of my relatives that was scared of the system:

"Hi Justin.. I am not intimidated at all with linux.. One thing at a time I am using it. I use it as much or more than windows. Thanks for your help." 

and she is using Version 0.0.1.4.

I must admit that the Kmenu in 0.0.1.4 was geared more for the Windows user however from complaints that we have received from existing Linux users about having to learn the new menu we made a high bred that is more like what your use to with the standard Kmenu and still is not too intimidating for Windows users.

Unlike standard versions of GNU/Linux that either have bloated kernels or have little to no programs installed by default we used the non bloated LinuxMint Kernel and added anything a Windows user could ask for and made the terminology in such a way they can understand. Also we have a Power Point Presentation on the Desktop to walk users threw the system as well as a read me. In 0015 not only can you open .docx files and convert them (without OpenOffice 3.0) but you also have a good amount of clip art and templates to browse threw. This is thanks to my mother who complained about not having any clip art or templates. 

Why could this be bad? Well for starters it takes up more hard drive space to install and seems to only run on computers that have right under 512 MB of RAM or higher. I haven't tested it much on these lower end computers but do know it won't run on 256 MBs with a 800 Mhz processor. We will be working on a lighter edition as well as an edition for the current Linux users. :)

Windows programs run better in Ultumix GNU/Linux 0015 and it's fun to tinker with them. 

Anything I forgot to mention?

I apologize Aaron. I'm the one announcing the release of this new distro. If it will get you using it I will stop announcing it in here. :( I joined this PLUG for help in the beginning but now I want to contribute. Maybe I should leave this mailing list because the only reason I'm still here is to contribute. I haven't had many of my questions answered in this room but thats not surprising because there are not many people who can answer my questions. I have no FTP or HTTP mirrors for my distro and no announcements on distrowatch.com so I thought I should advertise wherever I could. Once again I'm sorry.

   Perhaps posts of this nature should be on the plug-talk list.

Justin,
I don't think anyone is suggesting* that you leave the list. I think he was
trying to say that there are better alternate forums for announcing
releases. As Rich suggested PLUG Talk might be a better avenue.

*not trying to speak for anyone but that was what I got from Aaron's email.

   Perhaps posts of this nature should be on the plug-talk list.

OK, I'm downloading the Ultimate Edition by torrent. It's going to take
a day and a half. :(

But I'm not bitching too loudly about the download speed. It's tough
for small underfunded outfits that have to depend on advertising on
their site to pay the bills. We all have to start somewhere. Part of
the open source philosophy is giving everyone a shot at the brass ring.
It's not like I have to have it right now.

Do I understand correctly that what I am downloading is a 32-bit
version?

Yes it's 32 bit however the Ultimate Edition is an upgrade to Gamer Edition. The download for Gamer Edition should be faster because there are currently 6 peers and 3 seeds.
