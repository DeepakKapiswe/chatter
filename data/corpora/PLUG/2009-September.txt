Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu Hardy kernel as xen guest kernel panicking.
Message-ID: <4A9D7E52.7070506@zenlinux.com>

Hi all,

A co-worker of mine is trying to consolidate some Linux servers onto a 
single machine using xen. He's been having problems with the Ubuntu 
Hardy xen kernel (2.6.24-24-xen) panicking on boot as a xen guest. The 
host OS is CentOS 5.3 running 2.6.18-128.7.1.el5xen.

For testing purposes he's tried running the CentOS kernel within the 
Hardy install and it appears to work, but we'd rather avoid that 
workaround if possible.

If anyone has experience with the above, we'd be curious to hear from you.

Thanks,

Scott

Is he running HVM or Paravirt for the VMs that are crashing?

Greetings!

I am the "co-worker of mine" mentioned in the first message. :)

I am running paravirt (the hardware doesn't support HVM).

I admit I haven't searched for any known bugs in ubuntu yet.

Thanks!

   As far as I'm concerned, it should be the default (as it was with

I run CentOS 5.3, I try to keep updated because it's CentOS and CentOS
sadly is way behind as far as Linux distributions go.

People who run CentOS want something that just plain works and they
don't expect to reinstall their operating system every 6 months or 
sooner.

Ubuntu seems to be the most popular Linux distribution for desktops
and it seems to be more current, but I'm not sure I like Ubuntu.  
I don't like having to maintain 2 different Linux distributions.

Games like Dirk Dashing Secret Agent noticeably don't work quite right
on CentOS.  The latest release of Dirk Dashing doesn't seem to work at
all on CentOS, I am not sure why.

Where is Linux going in the future?  What is getting the most attention
right now across the board in general?  Wine and ReactOS still have a
long ways to go.  Dirk Dashing is a native Linux program, but it doesn't
work equally well on all Linux distributions.  Are the various Linux
distributions, enterprise and desktop editions, going to get closer in
time features wise?  Is there going to be a 2.8.xyz kernel soon?

The kernels that CentOS uses stock are quite old as far as the 2.6
branch goes.  I am using 2.6.18 and the current kernel is like 2.6.27
or something.  In CentOS, the mesa drivers seem to be ancient.  
Graphics support in CentOS seems to be weak even if you have 
updated as far as you can.  I'm wondering when CentOS 6 is going to
come out?

Enterprise Linux Distributions are supposed to be for people who need a
system that just works.  But do these distributions have to be so far
behind the bleeding edge?  I'm surprised there aren't repositories for
CentOS to make it more bleeding edge so that you don't have to maintain
a whole entire different Linux distribution.

You can't do it in Tools > Options because those settings apply to all
text in all documents. I realize that is what you want to do, but it's
much more flexible to set it in the paragraph style. 

If you want it to be on by default, just modify the Default paragraph
style in your default template. You can also set other paragraph styles
to  be based on Default if you wish.

There's a major argument going on in the OOo forums and e-lists. It
seems the developers have decided they want to add a ribbon to future
versions of OOo, ? la MS Office. I know of two MS Office users who tell
me they love the ribbon. Personally, I don't care one way or the other.
If OOo is to have a ribbon, I don't know why it can't  be user
selectable. Just because a program has a feature doesn't mean I have to
use it.

I can also see a strong argument in favor of copying MS Office, to a
point at least. For OOo to succeed it needs users. Easing the
transition for MS Office users helps with that goal. 

On the other hand, at its current level of development OOo has all the
features I want it to have except freedom from bugs. Instead of adding
a ribbon I wish they would declare a moratorium on new features for at
least a year and concentrate instead on cleaning up the existing code.
In "cleaning up the existing code" I include fixing font management on
Linux so it uses OpenType fonts like all my other Linux apps. That the
flagship Linux office suite cannot at this date is pathetic.

So too do those in the Debian Stable crowd, but their lives are more
functional, more manageable, and more full of joy.

I think it's nearly fair to say that Ubuntu has pretty much killed
everything else in the Desktop arena. Except for a few rogue funbois who
still play with other stuff (e.g. lots of people on this list.)

Using the mesa driver probably isn't helping.

Ubuntu.

You can look at it that way. really, I think these projects should be
abandoned and that development should be invested into our native
applications.

Probably. They'll all run apt* package management and look like [KX]?Ubuntu.

Boy, that is ancient. You should run Fedora, if you like the redhat thing.
FC11 is at 2.6.29 right now. Debian Stable is at 2.6.26, and Ubuntu Latest
is at 2.6.28.

Whenever RHEL6 does -- likely not in the next year.

I think you're talking about Fedora.

Or Debian Stable if you don't like the Red Hat thing. I don't.

   Ah, so! That's what I'll do then.

   Yellow ribbons? Pink ribbons? "Save the Skeets" ribbons?

   OTOH, why should anyone transition from Office to OO.o if there's no
discernable improvement? Both are free (the cost of the former is hidden,
though) and if they work the same what's the inducement to change? That's
what I've heard people say for a long time.

Amen to that! Other unpleasantness (in the word processor) relates to 
screen updates when using Compiz - so buggy (even on my well-supported 
Nvidia card) that's it's unusable.

Even though under deadline pressure, i tried LyX for my current writing 
project (thanks to this list), and am really enjoying it. A good blend 
of gui editor and clean separation of structure & appearance. One 
interesting thing is discovering body-memory for a bunch of keystrokes 
for dealing w/bad habits from MS-Word.

centos is based on redhat enterprise.  and very few enterprise shops are 
going to care about running games or even having opengl.  they care about 
running web, mail, database, etc services.  and they want those things to 
not have interface changes over a long lifetime.  so redhat picks a stable 
version of the various tools and does a lot of work to backport security 
and bug fixes to that original version so that your core enterprise 
functionality is not impacted.

only recently have they decided that upgrading firefox is better than 
trying to patch things because that kind of program doesn't need the same 
level of stability as sendmail, apache, mysql, etc.

ubuntu is certainly more desktop friendly.  so is fedora.  but fedora is 
not sanity friendly because they go to the other end of the spectrum and 
grab the latest and greatest toys and throw them in the blender and hope 
that enough alcohol will kill the taste :-).

i have only recently started running ubuntu on a netbook, and since i 
don't really get under the hood very much, that works fine for me. 
thunderbird, firefox, ssh all work like i expect.  but i run centos on 
every server i deal with.

You have to understand the ideology behind the distro before comparing  
it.

CentOS has a stated goal to be as like RHEL as possible, without  
infringing on Redhat IP. RHEL has a stated goal to be stable for two  
years.

Stable is defined as, "What ran on RHEL 5.2 at release will run on  
RHEL 5.2 with all updates". (I'm paraphrasing... )

They don't release kernel updates unless there is a compelling reason  
to do so. Most kernel updates will wait until the next major update of  
the OS.

Basically, CentOS will release kernel updates when RHEL publishes  
kernel updates. They would be subverting their own stated objectives  
if they were to release their own kernel update.

Fedora, on the other hand, is the Redhat playground. It's not stable,  
not for production, shouldn't be used for 'real work'. YMMV.

None of what I have stated in this message should be considered as  
gospel, or as a statement from, about, pro, or con against any  
particular distribution. I'm simply restating, in my own way.

Constructive comments welcome. "Flames and/or distro-war fodder" >> /

Joe,

   I do almost all my writing with LyX/LaTeX. Only when I need to exchange
documents with those using Word do I use OO.o. It's a realy PITA. With
LyX/LaTeX the writer's focus is on content. Professional typographers
designed the classes and the typeset output is truely beautiful.

I agree with what you have said, in so far as it is similar to what I have
read and believe to be the common view of the topic. In practice, the CentOS
machines I've used (often without root access) for "real work" have been out
of date to the point of hindering productivity. As you start compiling more
and more recent versions of things you need, ~/ starts to look like /.
Additionally, I have not found that open bugs in Fedora Core have created
problems either. As a general rule of thumb, my opinion is that Fedora
(CURRENT_RELEASE - 1) is usually better than whatever CentOS is doing.
CentOS is fine for servers that humans don't actually directly use, I
suppose: content servers, etc. Lousy for a build/development machine,
though.

Having used CentOS for a variety of servers, I must say its probably the
best thing out there for that type of deployment. Its super stable, has a
strong community and provides a large number of backports and packages via
the CentOS repo and EPEL. When you're worried about uptime, stability is
absolutely your top priority. This is defintely the main purpose of CentOS.
I should not be cutting edge for these reasons.

That said, you can install whatever you want on it. Its a perfectly capable
dev and build enviroment. You might be on your own for support since its far
beyond what the distro is designed for, but in my opinion there are plenty
of times "cutting-edge" software puts you on your own too.

Even on non-Compiz computers the screen update is horrible in OOo
Writer. Click on a graphic and the whole window jumps. Click back on
some text and the window jumps again. That's just lame. And it has
always been that way, since I first started using StarOffice 0.9 on
Windows. C'mon OOo team, clean this crap up.

I used to use Adobe InDesign a lot, and I still have it installed in a
virtual Windows machine. You can get some versions to work under Wine
as well. But I wanted a completely GUI layout app that was also
completely open source. I found it in Scribus. Scribus is currently at
about the level of InDesign 1.5, but the developers have done a great
job and progress is quite rapid. Typography is superb. However, it
still lacks footnotes, references (biblography), indexing and tables,
although there are (sometimes clunky) workarounds for all of those.

I think of Lyx as a word processor on steroids - a word processor
because it is continuous text. In contrast Scribus is a design app
where each page is a discrete object and text is always in a frame, so
it does not automatically flow from page to page (unless you tell it
to). Many projects could be done in either one with equal facility; but
the fundamental concepts behind the way they work are completely
different. In my experience you like one or you like the other; few
like them both.

   I strongly disagree with your initial statement. LyX is a GUI front end to
LaTeX which is a markup/macro language for the TeX typesetting engine. The
focus is on text-centric documents, but tables and graphics are easily
incorporated. The author does not need to futz with document or page layout;
tracking styles for headings; hyphenation; cross-references; tables of
contents, figures, and tables; or indices. Want to change from a report
style to an article style? One change in the document setup dialog box and
it's a completely different appearance. The writer focuses on content.

   Scribus is a great page layout application which is more graphic-oriented
than text-oriented. Sure, you can write a book with it but that's not its
forte. Brochures, magazines, newspapers, and the like which have layouts
designed to grab attention are best created with scribus rather than a word
processor or LaTeX.

   They are different tools for different purposes. There is a variety of
vehicle types (sports cars, sedans, trucks of various sizes and purposes)
each for a specific need. Document creation is equivalent. Given all that, I
still don't like to use OO.o Writer, and anything with mathematics in it
pales by comparison with the output from TeX.

You have read something into what I said, or at least I didn't make
something clear.

(1) Suppose you have a document in Lyx that is currently 100 pages. You
insert a table in the middle of page 2. By default all the text will
move down on all the pages.

(2) Suppose you have a document of 100 pages in Scribus. You add a
table to the middle of page 2. By default none of the other pages are
affected because each page is a discrete object containing only the
objects within it.

(1) is how a word processor operates.
(2) is how a page layout application operates.

There are lots of other strengths/weaknesses that are different as
well, but that is what I was trying to get across when I said "the
fundamental concepts behind the way they work are completely
different." And that's all I was trying to talk about. I didn't say
anything about which is inherently better for which task.

Yet approx every 6 months they release a major update.  RHEL 5.3 was released in
Feb 09.  5.4 is in beta now with expected release late Sept or early Oct.
They do major back ports to support newer hardware.  We have RHEL 5.3 running
on IBM I7 hardware with 10Gb interfaces.

Agreed.  But I know, or am pretty sure, why that's happening.  From
what I've observed, OO.o paints the document in a position within its
workspace, centered if it all fits.  But when you click on an image,
for example, or a table, there is a relevant toolbar that OO.o decides
you need to see and it will display that toolbar.  If the toolbar is
docked, its appearance changes the dimensions of the workspace and so
OO.o moves the document to accommodate.  Click off the item and its
toolbar goes away and the document is again repositioned.

Very frustrating indeed.

And, as implied in my first message, ALL updates that RHEL has  
released that do not violate the IP of RH, have in turn been released  
for CentOS.

Good theory, but I don't think it is correct.

I have no toolbars docked. Long ago I unchecked all the toolbars and
created my own personal toolbar with just the buttons I wanted. And I
keep this toolbar floating off to the right of the document window. I
did this in order to give myself the maximum height for a document. And
when I select an object in the document no additional toolbars jump up,
because I unchecked them long ago. In general I'm not a big fan of
toolbars.

Yet, in spite of the fact that there are no toolbars, the position of
the text and objects in the document window jumps when I select a
graphical object.

It could be that OOo is respecting the position that the toolbar is
supposed to go into if it was not turned off. So your theory may still
be the basis of the problem. 

I have subscribed to the OOo Users e-list for ages. What amazes me is
that this has been the state of affairs with OOo for so long that no
one even complains about it any more.

You have to decide what you want your machine to do and what you value more.
If you value something super stable and not bleeding edge then something
like CentOS is a good bet. Slackware is the same in many respects although
that project isn't beholden to an upstream distro for updates in the vein of
CentOS.

I really stayed away from the Ubuntu train only because when I first tried
is many many releases ago it just wasn't my thing. I have run more recent
releases to play with and I do find it has really matured and supports all
the things that I want to run/do. I am currently running Fedora 11 though
and have found it to be stable, easy to work with and prompt with updates.

So you're at the cross roads. Move to something else or stick with something
you're familiar with. Unfortunately with the way open source and it's
dependency and code re-use goes (which I find to be a good thing) .. changes
with games and such aren't going to work on a distro that doesn't release
the latest and greatest graphics updates.

Well, You could always use the LTS version of both server and desktop.

snipped from website
Ubuntu 8.04 LTS Desktop: Released April 2008 and maintained until
April 2011 ? ideal for large deployments.
Ubuntu 8.04 LTS Server: Released April 2008 and maintained until April

i also find (on a regular basis) that if i'm typing in the middle of a 
paragraph, the position & wrapping of the text below the insertion point 
doesn't update properly until i scroll the window or move the inserstion 
point forward or down with the arrow keys.

i'm not looking for a reason or fix, just shocked that so basic a 
function could be so broken.

One of the nice advantages of CentOS piggy-backing on RHEL is that it is
supported for what seems like forever. There is still a stable release of
CentOS 3 with backports and updates. For these kind of distributions there
should not be a 3 or 5 year cut off since the systems they are used to build
will be running for much longer and need to be extremely stable. When you
run CentOS you should thinking about uptime. (I wonder what distro google
uses... )

I brought a ubuntu system to a google office to offload a few gig of
video files.  "I'll boot our gobuntu cd will be able to read your raid
and write to the FS in our data center."

That's all I know.  I will let the reader extrapolate.

Google is large enough that using it's own distribution could make
economic sense -- since it's not distributing it 'out of house' I suspect
that it could even keep it's own changes private, if it wanted to.

But that's just supposition -- I'd like to know too.

I was under the impression that Google largely uses its own customized
Linux distro, though I'm not sure it can be called a "distro" if it
isn't distributed ... in any case, I think Google's Linux is its own
thing.

As a former Googler I can say we did use a custom Ubuntu called
Goobuntu. No real secret sauce to it. Just bundled with some tools we
used in house of course I can't say what because of that darned NDA :)

>> Where is Linux going in the future?

Well, I'm pretty sure a direction it's *not* going is toward One
Distribution to Bind Them All, though Ubuntu is about as close as it
gets.  We're a very fractured community.  If something seems works
well one one distro, it's likely to be taken up by the others, but if
we wanted to run the same thing everyone else is running, we wouldn't
be using Linux to begin with.

So why do you run Linux?  Because you want to keep your skills sharp?
Because you like the flexibility?  For the freedom?  Whatever it is,
there's probably a distro that's best for those reasons.

CentOS/RHEL is meant to run on servers.  If you want to stick with the
Red Hat paradigm, but trade some stability for desktop performance,
then try Fedora.  If you don't mind moving away from RPMs altogether
and you want recent packages with a large community and a lot of
support, then Ubuntu is the obvious choice.  If you want to
micromanage your computer and you don't mind stuff breaking whenever
you upgrade, then give Gentoo a try.

Burn yourself some LiveCDs.  Just about every major distribution has a
LiveCD that will run the OS free of commitment.

Message-ID: <1251928249.15617.10.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I have been trying to build a local repository of the Fedora 10 updates,
but now there is Fedora 11.  Yikes!

I wish there was an attempt to take a stable distro like CentOS which
works without updates and add modern features to it.  I realize that
CentOS is an enterprise distribution that tries to follow RHEL, but
the problem is that there needs to be something between CentOS and
Fedora.

It isn't easy to build local update repositories, or maybe I just am
not the best at it.

I find the Ubuntu root business with sudo a bit odd.  I am also
uncomfortable with the fact that Ubuntu tends to be installed from
a CD that doesn't contain most of the Ubuntu packages.  I don't want
to use a Linux distribution that isn't supported for very long if 
I'm expected to go to the Internet to get packages for it.  Even
though Ubuntu is supposedly a desktop operating system, I know my
brother uses it on his server system.

The nice thing about CentOS is that you can literally order a DVD
for it and without the updates it will work.

I wish there was a Linux distro that takes Fedora and fixes anything
that breaks before making a new release.  No updates between releases.
Frequent releases with the ability to upgrade existing systems.

Have you tried serial console?  How do you know the bootloader is

EPEL, rpmforge?  Though they may not let you bleed as much as you'd 
like.  :-)

I've only semi followed this thread but want mention that I use CentOS 
5.3 (final) for my desktop/workstation (along with a couple of dozen 
servers.)

There have been a few applications that wouldn't work or even install 
that I would have liked to play with but for the most part I am happy.

Installed Ubuntu for a friend/client and most of the regulars at the 
local user group use Ubuntu but I am not ready to give up my working 
setup to play with the bells, whistles, streamers, and flashing lights 
that they are always showing.  Besides those same things are available 
for CentOS if I wanted to take the time to play around.  I like knowing 
I don't have to upgrade for a couple more years.
    Maybe if I fix my wife's computer and get my bench (play) system 
back I can spend some time with other distributions.

So back to your concerns.  I think you can get close to bleeding edge 
with EPEL and rpmforge.

tftp won't connect. I ran a command that effects how much memory it 
thinks it has. I was in one of those reading/learning/20tabsopen fits 
and stopped paying close attention. The command was for a GS, not a GL. 
gah... The power light just flashes on and off with the rest solid. I've

These are the commands I ran:

nvram set sdram_init=0x0A
nvram set sdram_ncdl=0
nvram commit
reboot

A person than myself told me the router falls over suring boot becaause 
I told it a lie on how much memory it has. My original post (doh, it's a

I believe the Ubuntu Long Term Support editions do exactly what you state: a
linux distribution that is supported for a long time, and you are expected
to go to the internet to get packages for it.

It does not, however, do the other thing you asked for, which is to add
modern features. I'm afraid you are simply asking too much in this case.

   Thanks, Bill. Reading the wiki section on webcams I'm pointed back to
Ekiga. And it's interesting that the Logitech model I have is a newer
version of one of those mentioned on that wiki, but it not explicitly

   I'll give them a try, too.

Yes Fedora 11 is out, with 12 on the way.  It is a 6 month cycle.
If that is too fast for you, Fedora is not your best option.
However, they do officially support the N-1 release, which means each
release is supported for 12 months.  Fedora 10 is supported until Fedora 12
is released, and 11 is supported until 13 is released.
By supported I mean questions in the forums and IRC channels, security
updates, bugfixes, etc.

I am trying to understand your bottom line here- you want a stable distro,
that doesn't have updates, yet you want modern features?  You either have
stable (CentOS, Debian Stable, Ubuntu LTS), or you have modern (Fedora,
Debian Testing, Ubuntu current), there really isn't much middle ground.  I'm
not sure but OpenSuSE and Mandriva probably fall into the "modern" category
as well, being desktop focused.

As far as "between CentOS and Fedora", if you mean the old vs. new package
point of view, would probably be the previous release of Fedora, as
mentioned above the releases are supported for 2 release cycles or 12
months.  So if you want somewhat more stable than Fedora 11, stick with 10.
But be prepared to upgrade when 12 comes out.  You can stay one behind if
you want, but once you are two releases behind you are no longer supported.

And what exactly do you mean "works without updates"?  You can run any
distro without updates, just don't expect to remain secure.  Is your problem
internet bandwidth, you don't want to have to download the updates?

I know for Fedora, there are the Fedora Unity "respin" ISOs, which are
released periodically, and contain all of the updates to that point.  So at
some point there will be a Fedora 11 respin release, with all the updates up
to the date of release, so you can just install it and be good to go,
without having to install all the updates since 11 was initially released.
These are not "official" ISOs, but they are suggested for those who don't
have the bandwidth to download all the updates.

http://spins.fedoraunity.org/unity

It looks like they have torrents for the Fedora 10 respins, but not the 11
respins yet.

I am not sure I understand your point here- Fedora project takes the release
and "fixes anything that breaks" with updates, that's what they are there
for.  You want it to be "fixed" but you don't want any updates?  If you want
there to be 0 bugs in any given release, that is a pipe dream for any
software, commercial or open source.  Bugs happen, updates fix them.

And you want more frequent releases than 6 months (Fedora style)?

Most current distros have the upgrade option, Fedora and Ubuntu included.
Going from Fedora 10 to Fedora 11 example, you can do it with a CD/DVD, or
there are ways to do it with the update repos.
However as with any OS, it is better to back up data and install the new one
fresh.

To put it another way, how many people still run a machine that originally
had Win95, then did upgrade installs of Win98, WinME, Win2k, XP, Vista, and
soon Win7?  Making the jump from the old DOS based Win95/98/ME to the NT
based Win2K/XP/Vista would be very messy if not impossible, without a fresh
install.  And just going from one major release to another would be rather
messy as well and is not recommended.  Granted MS systems tend to gain much
more bloat than Linux, but you can see the gist of it.

I'm just going to say it:  You can't have your cake and eat it too.
You want an up-to-date distro that's been fully tested.  Well, there
just aren't enough resources around to do this in the open source
community.  

Microsoft comes close to achieving this, but they do it by cutting
corners and don't actually package any serious amount of third-party
software.  (I know this isn't a Linux vs. Windows discussion, but I
think the comparison helps us understand what's reasonable to expect
from a vendor.) Microsoft forces hardware developers to do the driver
work, and many of the sorts of packages that Linux distros always come
with by default (compilers, interpreters, editors, audio/video, ...)
have to be installed separately on Windows with a different release
cycle.  Linux distros, on the other hand, package everything together
and even maintain the majority of the drivers for supported hardware.
It's a complex task.  Microsoft's advantage here, is that if some
driver or third party software package comes out buggy, they can just
blame someone else or force Dell and the like to test things for them
on particular platforms.

Linux distributions are all about collecting thousands of packages
into a somewhat coherent installation.  Many of them are not going to
be well tested *and* be updated frequently because some are only
seriously used by ~5 people.

Anyway, depending on the purpose of your installation, you can always
pick between multiple levels of stability/updatedness on that
spectrum.  You just can't get both with any distro and I doubt that
will change any time soon.

My opinion?  Software is a living thing; lack of care and feeding
leads to death.  No longer can you stand still in a connected network,
no matter what vendor you are talking about.  As soon as someone burns
that convenient DVD and you install it, you're behind.  Install from
the network and you download less and get more up-to-date software.

You need to, at a minimum, apply security patches.  Many Linux distros
apply only security and serious bug updates and don't change
functionality which keeps them stable.  If you're not connecting a
device to a network at all, then just don't bother with the patches...


Good luck in your quest,
tim

Rich,
I'll be installing Slack 13 in the next couple of days and I'll plug in my
camera and see what happens with Ekiga and hopefully I can point you in the
right direction. I'll try it on this Fedora install as well and see what
happens.

And Eric is correct.  That's the config file that lists what was running, in what state on which desktop.
It is what I was looking for.

Message-ID: <20090902222001.0df93b33.johnxj@comcast.net>

I have a Thinkpad T61 with Intel Core2 Duo at 2.00 GHz on which I have
Jaunty x86_64. At the moment I am trying to print a couple of pages of
a PDF from Okular and it is taking forever to image. While I watch the
progress in System Monitor I note that the CPUs switch back and forth.
That is, for a while CPU1 will be at or near 100% and CPU2 will be
around 30%. After a while they swap and CPU1 will be at 30% or so and
CPU2 will be at or near 100%. I get the same results from Adobe Reader
9.1. However, Adobe Reader is so slow that I killed it after waiting 20
minutes.

I am wondering how Linux decides which CPU to use for which process.

Can't help you with the cable, but this is the sort of thing I would
be willing to kick in part of the cost of.  I could probably build one
if I had the time ... which I don't, sigh.

And I agree with Russell and others;  there are things you can do
without resorting to JTAG.  

On a side note, which will no doubt hijack the thread:

I would strongly suggest doing flashing of WRT's with a better power
supply than the wall wart.  I've had good luck with some of the IBM
T series AC adapters - they put out a nice constant 16.8V, while the
"12V" AC adapters put out wildly varying crap (from 9 to 17 V, sorta
kinda average 12V).  The ripply stuff gets regulated in the box, but
if it drops too low during programming, then the programming fails.
Heck, a car battery and a cable/plug end (and I have some) would do
a better job than those cheapo linksys adapters.

? ? Nothing exercises the limits of software like turning it
? ? over to the end users. While in-house testing is invaluable,
? ? the end users can often find the neglected edge cases or subtle
? ? race conditions in a more reliable manner. However, once the
? ? software is in the end user?s hands, postmortem crash information
? ? is usually lost.

? ? By taking the Google Breakpad project and enhancing it with
? ? Mozilla?s own Socorro project, Mozilla has a solution to this problem.
? ? When Firefox goes down, in a last ditch effort, it lobs a
? ? packet of crash information over the wall to Mozilla's Socorro
? ? servers. ?Socorro Servers, written in Python, can handle millions
? ? of these crashes per day. Using Google Breakpad libraries to
? ? reconstitute useful stack traces, Socorro Server saves its
? ? work in a PostgreSQL database. ?There statistics are gathered
? ? and displayed under the Socorro UI, a PHP web application.
? ? With this suite of tools, the Mozilla developers can track
? ? trends and even drill down to look at specific instances of
? ? Firefox crashes.

? ? WARNING: during this talk, Firefox will be intentionally
? ? crashed live on stage. ?Those of delicate constitution may wish
? ? to retire to the lobby prior to the spectacle.

Subject: [PLUG] Grey listing nightmare...
Message-ID: <1251966341.18429.42.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

It seems that comcast.net, hydrogendiscoveries.com, and other
email domains are served by servers that bounce if there is
any kind of non fatal delay.  What is going on?  You don't 
bounce simply because the destination server told you to wait.  
Like I said though, comcast.net and a lot of other domains 
bounce if there is any delay for any reason.

If this is true, grey listing is out.  I have been using sqlgrey
and it has been at least slowing down junk email.  When it is on
though, I am probably delaying or stopping more legitimate email
than junk.

I asked if grey listing makes the spam problem worse, but that 
didn't generate any interest.  The spammers are obviously 
retrying to defeat grey listing.  I check the spamcop.net and
dnsbl.sorbs.net blacklists, but that clearly isn't enough.

Because of the way smtp is set up over the Net, it is extremely 
rude to reply to the random email that comes in with a go to this 
site and authenticate your message message.  It would be terrible 
if I was doing that and slipped up so that the administrator of 
the plug list got such an email.  The point of asking people to
authenticate their message is that I might be able to stop 
random emails from email bots.

I have SPF checks turned on and if I don't recognize the domain 
of the sender, I reject.  I am at a loss.  I use Postfix.

Black listing every possible email address and only white listing
those that I know are legit would almost certainly stop the spam,
but it would make it difficult to receive email from new sources
or even old sources when someone's email address changes.

How do you discourage people/bots that try to send to addresses 
you don't support anymore?  How do you get solicitors trying to 
sell stuff you don't want or need to leave your email box alone?  
If I didn't know any better, I'd say that my email address is 
getting harvested.  Maybe someone on this list has decided to 
target me specifically.  On the other hand, it could just be 
zombie computers that are virus ridden and hooked up to the Net.

Would it be appropriate to fire off a reply immediately or 5xx 
someone who is trying to reach a mailbox I don't support?  How 
would I go about doing that?  How do I fight the spammers who
are dictionary attacking me?  If I continue to change the email
addresses I support, I will eventually run out of choices.
Varying the email address is not the answer, but I don't know
what is.

I don't know which apps are multi-threaded but if they are they can use both
CPU's which could be why it's bouncing back and forth between the 2. How big
are the PDF's you're working with?

Drew,

   Thank you. Because I know nothing about video on linux I have no ideas
were to start looking for the source of the errors.

   The Ekiga error is the driver not recognizing colors that Ekiga does, and
the CamStream error is the inability get VIDEOSYNC(1) working.

Rich,
I can confirm it's not working with a stock Fedora 11 install either. No
video output at all. I think I mentioned awhile back that the qc-usb module
is needed which I just tried and it puked because it doesn't like the
currently installed kernel. I'll be installing Slack this weekend so I'll
let you know if I have any more success with it.

i use milter-greylist with sendmail as well as the greetpause option 
(delay the initial smtp banner and reject if anything is sent before 
that).  in the greylist config i have it set to accept anything that 
passes spf, except if the spf passes with my own ip and it isn't me.  that 
keeps out email where the spf is set for wildcard acceptance.  using that 
combination does a pretty good job of keeping the bots at bay.  i also 
then use postini as a content filter.  i could probably live without 
postini, but i run my isp so i take advantage of the postini option.

for non-technical people i strongly recommend postini.  they don't do 
greylisting, but they do a pretty good job.

Drew,

   That's interesting. I think the key question is whether there is a common
cause among distributions and kernels.

   My research on drivers for the Logitech, Inc. QuickCam Communicate STX
confuses me. Almost no sites mention that specific model, but they do have
information on the VC (Viet Cong?) model which the STX replaced (or was that
the Pro model?). They mention the qc-ca driver, the qc-usb driver, the pwc
(Philips) driver for some Logitech models, but that was proprietary, no
longer supported, and now has a completely open version. Then there are the
V4L1 and V4L2 drivers and the vnclinux drivers; where they go in the stack
I've no idea. Long fire engines have drivers in front and back. Do webcams
need multiple drivers, too?

   I don't understand why there is such a plethora of drivers and so little
specific information on the STX model. Reminds me of the early days of linux
when too few hardware manufacturers opened their driver APIs to the linux
community and getting a specific item to work was a major hassle. I thought
we were well past that point by now.

I realize I'm not answering the question, but I fixed slow pdf printing by
changing from the "prefered" printer driver.

If memory serves, I just tried them one by one until I find those that
printed a small pdf quickly and then traded off the quality of the test
page.  I ended up with the Gutenberg driver instead of the preferred driver.

FWIW, my driver is exactly "Brother HL-1270N - CUPS+Gutenprint v5.2.3
Simplified".  Which I found out from: http://127.0.0.1:631/printers .

Drew,

   Just did another Google search and found the Logitech linux team web site.
According to them, the QC Communicate STX uses the spca drivers. These
include gspcav1 for v4l1 and gspcav2 for v4l2 for kernels >= 2.6.11. How do
I determine which version of video4linux (v4l) I have here?

   Loaded drivers currently include:

gspca_zc3xx            50688  0 
gspca_main             23808  1 gspca_zc3xx
videodev               36736  2 uvcvideo,gspca_main
v4l1_compat            17924  2 uvcvideo,videodev

   Does any of this help you or me?

Rich

I wish we were past it Rich. I've got all my project stuff uploaded to the
svn repo so I'm just gonna bite the bullet and do the Slack install shortly
and I'll let you know what I can find out about the cam then.

Looks like v4l1 is loaded so I assume that's what you have.

Drew,

   Well, v4l1_compatability, at least.

   From the SPCA web site for this camera:

Logitech 150 0x046d 0x08ad Communicate STX stream: jpeg drivers: spca5xx/LE gspca v4l1/v4l2
quality: ****

   Ergo, it appears that I have the proper driver (gspca) loaded (see
previous message) so the issue should be something other than the driver,
no?

Later,

Rich

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0909030902190.27466@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   This is apparently a new issue with firefox-3.0.13 here. While I don't
often print web pages directly to the printer, I wanted to do just that but
I cannot.

   When I invoke the print dialog box (menu, clickable link, ctrl-p) the
Print button is greyed out if a physical printer is selected so my only
option is to print to file.

   I find nothing about printing in the Edit->Preferences tabs. The printers
are properly recognized, but I cannot define options for them nor print to
them.

   Any ideas where I should look for a fix?

Thanks,

Rich

Well as I mentioned, the Linksys TFTP app indicates nothing no router is 
there to communicate with. I successfully used this app on the router 
when getting rid of the VXWorks OS. So I know how that part works unless 
there are some additional sneaky techniques.

As for the serial idea, are you referring to soldering on a serial port? 
That looks no less invasive than the JTAG approach.

I'm open to idea's, but

Even the newer switching power supplies? The problem with your approach

The problem is not slow printing at the printer; that is, the driver is
not the issue. Once the print job gets to CUPS it is sent rapidly to
the printer which images it in less than a minute. The problem is in
the PDF reader (Okular or Adobe Reader 9.1). Okular takes about ten
minutes to send just one page of the 132 page document to CUPS; Adobe
Reader over twice that long.

The PDFs were exported from Scribus. The Scribus document is 97 MB, and
contains no bitmap images at all - just text and vector graphics. The
first time I exported the file I embedded all nine fonts used in the
document and the resulting PDF was 207 MB. The second time I converted
all fonts to outlines and the resulting PDF was 203 MB. That surprised
me, because converting to outlines usually results in a much smaller
PDF. 

According to System Monitor Scribus is using 2 GB of RAM with the
document open, Adobe Reader uses 500 MB with the document open, but
Okular uses less than 100 MB. I was trying to print just two pages.
Okular took ten minutes to send the job to CUPS, but I never found out
how long Adobe Reader would take because I gave up on it after 20
minutes. 

I have no idea whether either program is multithreaded, but I very much
doubt that Adobe Reader is because it is still only 32-bit. I was
thinking that neither was multithreaded and the behavior of the CPUs
was nearly 100% on one CPU for the program that I was printing from,
and the other CPU at 20-40% because it was handling the OS. I just
found it strange that the roles of the CPUs were swapping back and
forth.

The gnome document reader "evince" is pretty snappy, it might be worth a
try...

It might not be a FF problem because I can print to a physical printer
with FF3.0.13.  I have two printers defined, my Epson and the cups PDF
driver, and the print button is enabled for both.

I find myself using the PDF driver more often because I really do
believe in the paperless office concept.

I'm using cups version 1.3.9-17ubuntu3.2 on a 32-bit Jaunty system,
and Synaptic reports FF as version 3.0.13+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.04.1,
if that matters.

If there is a header on the board, you don't need to solder.  I don't
remember if the WRT54GL has populated the header or not.  That might
go for the JTAG as well though.  From your description, it sounds like
you do need JTAG.  If the CFE (the bootloader that Broadcom uses on
the board) isn't coming up correctly, and isn't able to accept TFTP,
then serial probably isn't going to help.  Serial could let you watch
it fail though, which could be informative.

As it happens, I just purchased a USB JTAG adapter (an Olimex
ARM-USB-OCD from Sparkfun), but the software I am using with it
(OpenOCD) does not support Broadcom MIPS boards (I got it for an
ARM-based board, which is working ... yay!).

I also have a parallel port "Wiggler" style adapter that someone
loaned me, but I don't have any documentation for it and it isn't
labelled with any identifying information that would let me find
some.  I would loan it to you, but it isn't really mine to loan.

There are lots of instructions online for making your own adapter.  If
you've got a machine with a parallel port, some old cables and a
soldering iron, you just need a few resistors and some elbow grease.

To some extent I can understand the fixation on not spending any money (I
have it too), but at this point I think if you went back in time, dressed
in your rattiest clothing, and stood outside of Powell's Technical Books
or Free Geek and begged passers-by for spare change for a JTAG adapter
you'd find that you'd get enough to buy one from Olimex for the time
you've spent digging for information here.

Out of curiosity....

Any time I do either the hardware or software design for an embedded board
that needs to be serviced remotely, no matter how much convincing it
takes, I make sure there's a "get out of jail free" mechanism on the
board.  On the hardware side this is a pin to be grounded (or a switch)
whose exclusive function is to let the boot code know that it Absolutely
Positively Should Not attempt to run application code.  Then I make sure
that the boot code checks the pin, and resides in a part of flash that
Never Ever Gets Erased.

Does anyone know if, by chance, the WRT54GL has this, or did they just
rely on JTAG as their download of last resort?  They don't need to be
serviced remotely, and Linksys probably doesn't feel like folks
downloading their own firmware is a big part of their market share, so it
makes oodles of sense for this not to be the case.

In addition to the reasons you have outlined, they have the same motivations
to not tell anyone about it if they did put something like that in. So it
very well may be there, but it's useless to us if we can't figure out how to
use it. If we can figure out JTAG sooner/more easily, then it is the more
valuable option.

The explicit statement is true, although you are absolutely correct that
the implied value judgment is a bit hasty.  I knew that, but I figured
that the OP could make his own value judgments.

I think it'd be fun to go begging for cash for computer parts, just to see
how people would react.

This talks about how python uses cores and what happens when it

I am not sure if it actually answers the question, but it is interesting.

Larry,

   I used to print directly from FF, and all my other apps print directly to
the printer so I assume that's where the problem is located.

I agree, all indicators point that way.  I'm just giving you a data
point.  Can you print to the cups PDF driver?

If you go to about:config in FF, and look up "print.print_command",
what do you see?  I see:

   lpr ${MOZ_PRINTER_NAME:+-P"$MOZ_PRINTER_NAME"}

I don't generally use Evince because its print dialog box offers
practically no options. However, just now I tried it. It did open the
203 MB file reasonably quickly. I told it to print pages 101 and 102,
and that took it only three minutes. But at the end it popped up a
message "Failed to Print Document: Too many failed attempts." (There
are no jobs in the print queue.)

That kind of behavior is typical of Evince. And if I ever do get it to
print something it cuts off the bottom of the page, or prints landscape
when the document is portrait, or some other mess. It's fine for
viewing a PDF on screen but printing is unreliable.

I always wondered what was responsible for that.   I was blaming the
fact that I was using the usb hub built into my lcd - it seemed like
power cycling my lcd fixed it.  i guess just retrying fixes is.

The GL unit is explicitly for this kind of hacking.  More memory,
higher price.  The regular WRT54G unit started out with enough ROM
and RAM to hack, but devolved.  That does not mean the GL has the
appropriate protected firmware and reset pins and such;  few people
are as smart as Tim.  When Wescott Wonderful Wireless starts selling
access points, I will buy one.

Since there are low cost, low power, fully featured programmable units
like the PCEngines Alix out there, which run a normal X86 distro on
fast hardware and have a slot for a PCMCIA wireless card, I've been
less interested in flashing COTS access points, anyway.  Still, I would
love to live in a world where all consumer gear was reprogrammable
( "download Nokilla, and turn your cell phone into a death ray!").

That doesn't help the original questioner, though.  Maybe it sets 
the "just give up and use an Alix instead" threshold.  There is a
non-zero chance that his particular GL unit is unrecoverable.

Subject: [PLUG] Interesting C problem
Message-ID: <4AA038D1.2070400@pacifier.com>

I am modifying some C code. One function had a very large automatic 
variable. It was the array:
jsProfile offLineProfiles[NUM_JOE_SCAN][NUM_BUF_PROFILES];

This array as an automatic variable worked in the older Slackware 9.1 
2.4.22 uni-processor systems. However, when I moved the code to a newer 
2.6.27.7-smp, it would Segmentation fault in the function. Interesting 
thing was that it would fault when attempting a sprintf(). Using ddd, I 
could step through code in the function until the sprintf() was reached.

In my various attempts to gain some insight, I added a printf() above 
the sprintf() - it faulted on the printf(). Finally, I moved the large 
array automatic variable and made it global - everything ran.

So I looked at the array and calculated it's size to be 11,824,000 bytes.
sizeof jsProfile == 2956
NUM_JOE_SCAN     == 2
NUM_BUF_PROFILES == 2000
Looking at the older system from which I received the code, ulimit -s 
showed the stack size to be unlimited.
The stack size on the newer system however is 8192.

I am assuming that gcc-4.2.4    CFLAGS = -g -Wall -W
places automatic variables on the stack. Is this a reasonable assumption?
If so, creating the variable overran the stack and stomped all over 
something, maybe that function's index to C libraries - or????

Another interesting observation is that if I place the large array back 
in the function but return from the function before executing any C 
library calls, later C library calls to printf() etc. work fine.

Any wisdom and insight here would be appreciated.

Wayne

The v4l1 compatibility thing probably means you have V4L2 set up on
your system, which I think is a good thing.

In my 2.6.30 kernel sources, searching around in 'make menuconfig'
brings me to the menu under the path:

     -> Device Drivers                                    
         -> Multimedia devices

             -> V4L USB devices (V4L_USB_DRIVERS [=y])
               -> GSPCA based webcams (USB_GSPCA [=m])

And here I'm presented with a list of GSPCA modules:

In your previous email, it seemed lik you might have the main GSPCA
module and the ZC3XX module loaded, but not one of the SPCA5XX modules
loaded.  The line you included above seems to imply that would be
required.  If you don't have that module compiled with your kernel,
you may need to recompile.  I would suggest just compiling all of the
items in the above list as modules and hopefully kernel auto-detection
will get it straight.

Good luck,
tim

i am assuming mean the new stack is 8192k (9 meg).  you are correct to 
identify that as the problem.  calling a function requires using the stack 
to record parameters for the called function, so by trying to allocate 
more local storage than the stack would allow caused the cpu to try and 
access memory outside the valid range and seg fault.  any function could 
have caused it, as well as any access to the beginning of the 
offlineprofiles variable.  if the function is not re-entrant, then making 
it a global would work.   so would making it be a static and malloc'ing it 
on the first call.

There is a little known non-standard (but common) function in C called
alloca that works for this sort of thing:
http://www.cs.utah.edu/dept/old/texinfo/glibc-manual-0.02/library_3.html#SEC45

I have no idea how old that documentation is, but it seems to describe it.

alloca is still on the stack so it won't help his problem of blowing 
through the stack limit.

My mistake.  I thought by being a dynamic allocation of stack that it
avoided the segfault.  Googling a bit more I do see that you can have
a stack overflow from alloca and the behavior is undefined.  Bummer.
Sorry for any confusion.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0909031530300.27466@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   When I need to send a draft document to someone else for review and comments
I save it as a Word97 .doc file. When comments come back, I'll sometimes
reconvert the document to .odt. Doing this with OO.o-3.x causes all sorts of
formatting changes that did not occur with earlier versions.

   When I use my OO.o letter template the document has the letterhead first
page and continuation pages with a different header after that. What OO.o
now does in the translation to .doc is put the letterhead on each page; it
totally looses the different page styles.

   Also, it now inserts random spaces between words and, in a couple of
cases, within a word.

   This is retrogressive behavior. It's time wasting and a PITA to have to go
through each line to look for random changes. What a shame that it's
becoming less of a collaborative writing tool than it used to be.

Not PCMCIA, mini PCI.  There is still reason to like reprogrammable
COTS devices: they are cheap or free, while an Alix with its enclosure
and so for (as awesome as it is), costs on the order of $150 to put
together.

JTAG is available on that board and given his report of what went
wrong (misconfiguring his bootloader) it sounds highly probably that
correcting the data on the flash will fix his problem.

Or malloc it and then free it when you're done.  Just make sure that 
_every_ path out of the function goes through free (oh, I do like C++...).

While I agree these kind of problems can be a PITA, and OO.o is not perfect,
it is still a good program.

My wife is using OO.o on a G4 Mac running OSX 10.5, and has some problems,
but overall it works.
I think part of the problem (slow, occasional crashes) can be due to running
Leopard on a G4 Powerbook instead of an Intel MacBook/MBPro, and the fact
that OO.o on OSX is not a native GUI app, but there is a port (Neo Office),
which uses X11 instead of Carbon/Cocoa.

What purpose is it to convert between .odt and .doc?  IMHO, if you are
working with people in the M$ world, just keep it as .doc, and if you are
working with people who use OO.o, keep .odt.
Converting between them has never been a slam dunk, and that only
exacerbates the problem.  This is not entirely the fault of OO.o, we can
blame the ever changing .doc standard for part of it.

YMMV

I am not into blaming, so I shall stay out of that, but I should like to 
add my vote to that of Matt McKenzie, as my experience would seem to 
collaborate his - and I run Linux only - no dual boot or VM.

To avoid MSW making hash of an OO.o file, or the other way around, I 
often passed it on as a PDF - possibly not a productive suggestion in 
your case?  However, my daughter (and MS user, and college professor of 
Math) uses LaTex/Tex, and I have found LyX is available on a number of 
platforms including MS - possibly also not a productive suggestion in 
your case, as it might imply a learning curve for your reviewer(s).  Sigh.

That does seem to leave keeping it in MSW format for simplicity - hope 
some of this helps, or at least does no harm
Regards
Fred James

PS:  Even HTML doesn't always help as MS slipped off on their own there too.

   Yeah. That's all I've used the past dozen years.

   No one seems to notice what I wrote. When I need to collaborate on a
document, that is, write a draft and have others make comments on it I need
to use OO.o. If you look in the archives of this mail list you will see many
of my posts noting that almost all of my writing is with LaTeX/LyX. The
folks in the business world stick with Microsoft -- and all the default
settings on every application -- and have no interest in using anything
different.

What about RTF?  OO.o does remark that it's converting the document,
but there may be less of an issue with that than any DOC format.

Most of the documents I send are a one-way communication, meaning the
recipient is not expected to make any changes, and so I use PDF in
almost every case.  Only when I am asked for a DOC format do I send
one.

I can't speak to anyone else's issues with OO.org, or their needs with
respect to MS Office interoperability, but RTF is simply insufficient
for many uses.  Cross-referencing document sections, figures, tables,
bibliography entries, etc. are all critical for the .docs I have to
work with.

In my experience, OO.org has never been sufficient for sharing
documents with MS Word users.  I simply have no idea what the
documents will look like on the other end.  (The last time I tried
this, every image in the document was stacked on top of eachother,
regardless of archoring location.).  It's just embarassing.

If you do use OO.org in a professional capacity, you may want to find
someone who can show you what your documents look like to a Word user.

I now think of OO.org as a handy viewer of MS Office formatted
documents, but if I actually have to produce one I fire up a Win XP vm
that does nothing but run Office.

If you only use OOo to write for the purpose of collaboration, why not just
keep the document in .doc format from the start?

I find that crossover Linux standard runs MS Office 2003 
student teacher edition nicely on CentOS 5.  Apparently,
the current version of Quicken works with the latest 
version of crossover Linux standard as well.

It is discouraging that documents produced using OO 
render differently under MS Word, but I guess it 
should be no surprise that this is the case.

Just thought I'd point out that crossover Linux is a 
potentially cheaper route to go than running XP under 
emulation and it is faster to boot.

Another approach, if you can do this, is to give your 
customer the word processed document in openoffice format 
with printed instructions on where to get openoffice.  Of 
course you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make 
it drink ;-)  I tried this in college and didn't get 
anywhere.

That's a great suggestion, and I actually own a copy of crossover
office specifically for that purpose, but unfortunately it just hasn't
worked very well when it comes to actually running office under Linux.

I think older versions of Office may have worked well, but a couple
things make the VM solution work better for me:

Crossover office, as of late 2008, needed a fairly select subset of MS
Office installation media.  There are a *lot* of different
distributions of Office, and each CD / DVD seems to have the relevant
bits in a different location, so of the 3-4 different versions /
distributions I had access to, only one actually bothered to install.
(I don't recall which at this point).

It played havoc with my windowmanager -- graphical glitches, issues
with resizing windows, full-screen problems, etc... generally
speaking, office apps just didn't "play nice" with the rest of my
desktop.

Win32 widget rendering has always been a bit off, in my wine-like
experiences, and...I'm absurdly picky about things like that.  I guess
I'm somewhat of a slave to the aesthetic usability effect ;)

There are a couple other things that make VMware a reasonable solution
-- VMWare Unity integrates nicely with a number of desktop
environments (unfortunatle, dr17 isn't yet one of them..) and once in
a rare while, I need to do something else in Windows, like verify a
build system is cross-platform, a bit of web testing in chrome / IE,
or design a UI in Visio.

When possible, I send LaTeX-generated pdf.  The clients I work with
often don't have the freedom to choose their software--there are many
places that take software installation very, very seriously, so
getting access to something new could take years.

It's significantly harder to do that than it is to hire someone who
produces nice looking .doc files ;)

Sorry - I guess my thoughts got lost in my wordiness - but I (and 
others) did suggest that the simplest answer would be to just keep it in 
MSW format from beginning to end - at least until you don't need your 
reviewer(s) any longer.

Since you are already using LyX - once the reviewing stage is over you 
could save as text and go at it from there.

Or have I missed something again - like you want them to review the 
formatting as well?  Sorry to have been such a bother, and probably no 
help at all

Message-ID: <4AA19893.5040808@comcast.net>

Can someone point me to an image that shows all the icons Ubuntu uses 
with its update manager? I'd like to see a table with each icon and what 
it stands for. Googling produced some textual descriptions, but not of 
all the icons I've seen.

Today, I had a yellow triangle with an explanation mark in the middle. 
When I clicked on it, I got the usual update window, but an error 
message came up (sorry -- didn't write it down, and then it was gone). I 
decided I'd try to find out what the icon was all about, but while I was 
Googling, the icon disappeared from the upper right hand corner of the 
desktop.

Make that an orange triangle.

Hovering over the triangle  told me that something was out of date and 
that I should run the update system manually and click the "check" 
button. Upon so doing I got the following:

I am not sure, but faced with the above I would first check System >
Administration > Software Sources. Look at what repositories you have
enabled. I have never heard of kheb.homelinux.org and I don't know what
repository it is in, but it sounds like there is a repository enabled
somewhere that points to a server that is no longer there.

After checking the above, then I would do an update. There is a command
that ends in -update, but I can't remember the rest of it. I just do it

Here's the actual text of the tool-tip that pops up when I hover over 
the orange triangle with the ! in the middle:

The update information is outdated. This may be caused by network 
problems. Please update manually by clicking on this icon and then 
selecting 'Check'.

Here's what's in the Software Sources window, Third Party Software tab:

[ ] cdrom:[Ubuntu 8.04.1 _Hardy Heron_ - Release i386 (20080702.1)]/ 
hardy main restricted

Sounds like something is wrong with the  "unstable main non-free" source.

I unchecked:

[ ] http://kheb.homelinux.org/debian unstable main non-free

Reload worked without an error, and the triangle icon went away. I 
suspect that this isn't really a solution, since now I won't know about 
updates to non-free stuff. Googling pointed me to a thread on a forum 
where someone said that it may be that the source is off-line 
temporarily. The original poster said that it had been three days. So, 
maybe there is a problem someone's working on. I'll put something on my 
desktop to remind me to try it again later in the week.

I use Postfix 2.2.10 and I wonder what common practice is to stop
backscatter email?  I see that body checks and header checks are
recommended.

I turned off grey listing and have since been looking to improve
my spam prevention without it.  So far, I have studied the sorbs black
lists and I've added a few more.  I was originally using just
dnsbl.sorbs.net where I have added the spam list and all the rhsbl
lists.  I am also using just bl.spamcop.net and I have been trying
to produce my own dns black list.  I figure if I add more black 
lists I will stop more spam from getting onto my mail servers in
the first place.  The trick is figuring out which ones to add.

What hardware is needed to mate an electric musical instrument to a

plug, and the signal is sufficiently preamplified, what hardware do I
need to plug it into, that will make the signal available to the

Assuming you have a 1/8" line in socket on your sound card, you need
an adapter to convert both size and channels.  I wouldn't doubt that
Guitar World or Radio Slack might have what you need.

And if the signal is not sufficiently preamplified, use the mic input.

I'm seeing other info that suggests the same thing.  Now it comes down
to sound card input quality.  Let's say I want to get a really
good-sounding card.  The M-Audio Audiophile looks intriguing:

   http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16829121120&Tpk=m-audio%20audiophile

It uses a VIA VT1712 chipset.  One has to consider kernel
compatibility.  Any high quality cards (preferably with RCA inputs
like this one, since a good connection is critical) that are known to
work with the linux kernel?

I'm getting an electric viola.  They all seem to come with built-in
pre amps.  It probably has to do with the electrical qualities of
transducer bridges.

I was curious to see what you were talking about, so I googled for
"surbl blacklist":

  http://www.surbl.org/


Sounds like an interesting idea, but it's a post-delivery content
filter approach, not something you can deploy as a first line of
defense.


In your quest for more RBLs, obviously there's spamhaus.org that you
hadn't mentioned before.  I also download these two blacklists
periodically, process them, and host my own internal RBL server with
rblsmtpd:
  http://www.openbsd.org/spamd/traplist.gz
  http://www.openbsd.org/spamd/nixspam.gz

Like you, I also use spamcop.  Not using SORBS right now, since I
thought they were throwing in the towel at some point.  

When greylisting first became popular, I figured it would end up being
ineffective after some short period of time.  It's yet another
tit-for-tat defense strategy that just requires about as much effort
on the spammers' part as it does on ours.  I never bothered
implementing, even though early results showed it being very effective
for my brother who has a similar mail setup.  However, I have noticed
a lot of delays for legitimate mail due to greylisting.

On my systems, I've set up scripts to start temporarily blacklisting
IPs that send me mail at nonexistent addresses (after some sanity
checks).  The idea being that spammers often flood many nonexistent
addresses in conjunction with real ones they've harvested.  My scripts
don't stop a whole lot more spam, but it was an interesting
experiment.

Anyway, I'm still not happy with the level of spam that gets through
my border, but I simply don't have time to keep up with it.  Let me
know if you come across any other good blacklists or tricks to cut
down on the volume at the perimeter.

I had a substantial backscatter problem last Spring. I ended up writing
a bunch of custom python code to filter it. The algorithm went something
like this:

1. Determine if the incoming messages is some sort of bounce (possibly
legit). This is determined by two things:
a. The "From:" address (typically postmaster or mailer-daemon).
b. Some or all of an original message is included either in-line
or as a MIME attachment.

If it is a bounce then:

2. If the original message is included in its entirety, then run the
original through your regular spam filters. If it turns out to be spam
then the bounce is backscatter.

(This next step requires that have a name for each email address
on your system, i.e. that jsmith at example.com is "Joe Smith". Where
you don't have that information you'll have to skip this step.)

3. Look for the "To:" line in the header of the original message.
Parse out the email address and the name. Check to see of the name
is a possible match for the email address. Typically in bounced
spam you'll see a complete mismatch, i.e.:

    From: "Wendy" <jsmith at example.com>

There's no way "Wendy" could be a match for "Joe Smith", so the bounce
is likely backscatter. I used a fuzzy string comparison so that slight
variations and typos of "Joe Smith" would count as a match (a legit
bounce). Python's difflib.get_close_matches() works well for this.

This algorithm ended up catching well over 90% of the backscatter. I
eventually reversed steps 2 and 3 to reduce CPU load. Step 3 is fairly
cheap CPU-wise and very effective, so if it detects backscatter you can
skip CPU-intensive step #2.

I have 'evince' on Mandriva 2008 and 2009, and have not noticed any 
particular problems, printing or otherwise, that I have not also found

Not sure this helps

   Is there a way to get the entire trunk (directories, modules, and other

Add a dot to specify the top-level of the repository:

Or for just the pyfuzzy module:

  cvs -z3 -d ... co pyfuzzy

In CVS, there is the repository, and there is the module.  Your
command is missing the module name.

   cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous at pyfuzzy.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/pyfuzzy co

/cvsroot/pyfuzzy is the repository.  The repository is just the
directory on the CVS server which contains stuff.  That stuff is
called "modules".

A module could be as simple as the name of a top-level directory
within the repository.  For instance, let's say the CVS server
contains a file:

    /cvsroot/pyfuzzy/projects/fuzzyproj/fuzzyproj.py

/cvsroot/pyfuzzy is the repository.  That leaves 3 choices for
modules:

   - projects (would give you everything)

   - projects/fuzzyproj (would give you just projects/fuzzyproj; if
     there were more items within projects/, you would not get them)

   - projects/fuzzyproj/fuzzyproj.py (would give you just one file!)

As you can see, modules aren't some magic unit of division in CVS.
It's simply a (not too great) nomenclature for "any path under the
repository".

Your command should look something like:

   cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous at pyfuzzy.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/pyfuzzy co <some_module>

where <some_module> needs to be looked up on the project's web page.

Next question then: does the lpr command work for you from the command
line?  Can you print a text file with "lpr <filename>?  (Set up a
default printer in CUPS first.)

I did have a machine once that gave me problems with lpr.  I think it
went south when I used KDE's printer GUI to set up printers.  From
then on, I had to use cupsdoprint in lieu of lpr.  I wonder if xfce4
has a printer GUI, and its own print command?

Another idea: Firefox lets you print to a file.  This file is in
postscript format.  Can you print one of these with lpr?  That would
assure you that Firefox is producing valid postscript, and it can be
printed with the lpr command.

If all that is true, but you can't print from firefox, then maybe try
setting a default printer in CUPS, and then changing
"print.print_command" to just plain old "lpr".

Carlos,

   I have a default printer set in CUPS; it's the same as it's been for
years.

   But, lpr is not working properly from the command line. It's printing a
newline but not with the carriage return. A text file prints line-by-line
but each new line begins below the end of the preceeding line (plus one
space).

   This is also fairly recent behavior. It used to work just fine in earlier
versions of Slackware/Xfce4/CUPS/whereever. I've no idea what broke.

   Xfce4 does have a printer settings command; the choices are NONE, CUPS,
and BSD-LPR. No output difference regardless of which is selected. PITA, eh?

Thanks,

I think it's safe to say that firefox is not the issue.  Time to
regroup and go after lpr.  We must determine if there is some xfce4
print command that has hijacked lpr, like kde did to me.  I have xfce4
installed; I'll look around.

Terry,

   Thank you. That's the same syntax as subversion so I should have known to
add the current directory as the checkout target.

Clue stick appreciated,

The command you're looking for is:

cvs -z3 
-d:pserver:anonymous at pyfuzzy.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/pyfuzzy co -P 
pyfuzzy

this didn't come out quite right on thunderbird for me, it's meant to be 
all on one line.

Do not be afraid to joust a giant just because some people believe in 
windmills.

Carlos,

   Thank you.

   It may well be related to an "improvement" in the latest Xfce4 that broke
what worked well in all previous versions.

I can't budget $500 for Linuxcon.  I imagine many of you are in the
same boat.  However, there is apparently some kind of free/$99 (?)
Live Streaming option.  Perhaps we ought to get together some of the
usual suspects and watch remotely.  I've got a big screen projector
and 4Mbps FIOS, and the living room is cleaner than usual.  Or perhaps
one of us in a corporate venue has a better feed and a conference
room (or better yet, two - there are two tracks).  Should we be
planning a 3 day Linuxcon party?

Ken points out that Best Buy, Office Depot and others are lying to people
about Linux so they only think to buy Windows 7.

Maybe it's time to speak with some of these managers make them aware of
their misinformation. I'll bring my laptop w/ Ubuntu on it and give them a
demo so they can see for themselves what Linux is, because most employees
and managers are ignorant of Linux and it's time they did know the truth.

Check the definition of "lying" in the dictionary before you go.  At least
according to their chart I don't think you could prove in court that what
they're doing is "lying" -- they're too clever for that.

What they _are_ doing is choosing the chart such that Linux comes up
looking bad, and in some cases stretching the definition of "few".  Let's
go over it point by point, and think of how _we_ might honestly answer
those questions.

But keep in mind, too, that if you're really honest you aren't going to
recommend Linux to your church secretary unless you're willing to be
her/his constant IT companion.

So let's look at those questions.

"Familiar and easy to use":

Are my mother and sisters familiar with any flavor of Linux?  No.  My
sister in law?  My brother in law?  My geeky brother?  No.  So no matter
how easy Ubuntu is to use (and with the exception of my mother and one of
my sisters the rest of the cited people would pick up on it in minutes),
Linux is not familiar, so it is therefore not familiar AND easy to use. 
So they've told the truth (the @#*$#&^%).

Even I find that Ubuntu -- in theory the easiest to use Linux flavor --
requires IT expertise that is way above and beyond what your average
mechanic, church secretary, or office manager even comprehends, much less
is happy to do.  Until everything -- _everything_ -- under the hood is
accessible equally well from a graphics app as from text, until those
graphics apps are self-explanatory or backed up by ample help files, and
until you almost never need them, this is going to be the case.

"Most customers want":

Given a choice, my wife and both sons use Windows (even Vista) in
preference to Ubuntu.  Why?  See my above comments.  With Windows -- even
Vista -- they can get by on their own.  With Ubuntu they're always calling
me.

"Digital Home":

Who the heck cares -- I don't even know what they mean.  But Microsoft has
made it their goal to put the capital letters in Digital Home, so let them
cite it.  Me, I want to do business on my computer.

I'd be interested in knowing what the heck a "Digital Home" is, for that
matter.

"Cameras/iPod/MP3 players":

Well, I can access a camera that makes itself look like a disk drive,
ditto for iPod & other MP3 players.  #1 son logs onto Linux to fix things
when his iPod gets hopelessly screwed up by Vista.  But if you want plug
and play, if you want your Nikon camera to talk to the Nikon camera app
then I'm afraid your best hope is Windows.

"Printers/Scanners"

Define "few" and "many".  Once again they're clever in lumping these
together.  My printer worked right out of the box, but my scanner required
the kind of diddling that I could only do because I'm a software guy
and/or IT professional.  I wouldn't expect _any_ of my siblings or in-laws
to be able to get it to work without concentrated help -- except for my
geeky brother and one geeky B in-law (ironically he's the one married to
the anti-computer sister).  I have high confidence in randomly buying a
printer to run under Linux -- but not a scanner!

"Services Integration"

I'm not sure what the heck they mean by that, but they probably mean that
the web browser doesn't automatically go to MSN when you start the
computer.

"W-WAN Support"

I don't know.  It's worked quite well for me, but I hear stories about
needing to select one's laptop if one wants the built-in WAN to work --
that sounds like a compatibility issue to me.

"Software Compatibility"

OK Mr. Refuter -- just how many folks out there use Linux _exclusively_,
_without_ having a copy of windows stashed away somewhere for those one or
two applications that Just Don't Work on Linux?  How many of us can truely
cut ourselves free from all the .doc formatted files we have to read, and
accountants who want our tax records in Peachtree format, and
microprocessors that can _only_ be debugged with software that just can't
live without being hosted on Windows?  How does that fly with any claim of
Linux as being "Software Compatible".

Go into Office Depot, inventory all of the software titles that they're
making $$ on, and put a check mark next to the ones that _really work_ on
Linux, or on Linux under Wine.  What's the percentage?  I'll bet you that
the number of check marks on your list will meet the definition of "few"
in just about any dictionary you can pick.

Can you find software titles, for free, that _replace_ those titles that
Office Depot makes $$ on after someone buys a Windows machine?  For the
most part, the answer is "why yes, I can".  Is that the message you want
to leave the store manager with?

I think that one needs to take the Microsoft list apart, and reassemble
it.  If you want to be nasty, have a version that makes Microsoft look bad
and one that's objective.  Hand out the 'bad' version first and say "Now
this is the quick summary", then hand out the 'good' version.

But I think that at this stage of Linux's maturity one still needs to be a
bit of an IT expert to use it -- even when Ubuntu makes it easy.  I know I
can't send my mother into Office Depot with a check and the instructions
"Only buy stuff that has a 'Linux Ready' sticker on it".  Until I can, my
recommendation for Linux will be "as long as you know what an OS is, as
long as you know how to dink with your computer, and as long as you don't
mind maintaining not one, but _two_ OS's, then go for it".

   Clients and agencies provide .doc files of processed words. When I need to
collaborate with others on a document I send them copies in that format.
(And now the drafts will be totally unformatted so there are no conversion
hassles in either direction).

   My accountant likes the .pdf files I send her.

   Don't know the answer to this one. But, it seems that most of the
questions posted to the LyX, PostgreSQL, and SQLite mail lists (perhaps
others I've overlooked) are from those using Windows, not linux. It seems
these folks really like F/OSS but won't take the next logical leap out of
Windows.

Some items jumped out at me 

Claim: Printers/Scanners  Windows7 Many - Linux Few  - Fact:
Printers/Scanners  Windows7 Few - Linux Many


Being a former Windows user (loved Win2K, XP was good, Vista, yecch), I
downloaded Wind7 RC and tried it out. Surprise!  There is no support for
my H-P IICx scanner. Or even the Adaptec PCI scsi  card that feeds it!
Nor is there any planned. That scanner is perfectly adequate for  my
needs and, like all H-P  hardware of its generation, it's built like a
tank and will likely outlive Bill Gates.  Why should I buy a new one so
I can run Win7? Contrary to Microsoft's BS, their Windows team is
obviously removing support for most legacy hardware. Probably to make
hardware vendors happy. Having run Ubuntu Linux for almost three years
now, I find support for legacy hardware is superb. Never one problem
with the system recognizing it, even on installation. Windows should be
so blessed!

Claim: Software Compatibility Windows7 Many - Linux Few - Fact: Software
Compatibility  Windows7 Few - Linux Many

Same problem in a different sphere. Nearly every app I replied upon in
Win2K and XP won't run or won't run well in the GEE-WHIZ LOOKIT THAT!
world of Windows 7. So I'll be forced to lay out a grand or two for a
basic suite of office, graphics, media and systems tools. While every
need they service is met FOR FREE in the Linux world. What do I get with
Windows7? A resource-hungry pinball machine of an interface that is no
longer even intuitive. Nearly every change Microsoft made was solely for
change itself, not to create a more user-efficient system environment. I
won't even get into the bootheel-intrusive Microsoft anti-piracy model
or its fat unwieldy yet still vulnerable security paradigm.   

I don't think Linux fans will have to "DO" anything to refute this MS BS
PR push as the article suggests. Microsoft may have finally delivered
one product that can really lure the average PC notebook and netbook
user into a switch. To Linux. There is a reason Microsoft is waging that
expensive disinformation campaign. It isn't because  
Windows 7 can stand on its own toe to toe with Linux without lies.

The first thing that jumped out at me was: why is MS comparison
advertising with linux, if linux is so bad?  I suspect it might spark
people's curiosity to ask, what is linux?

As for the question "What are you prepared to do?", I'm not
trash-talking MS (futile and unproductive) and preparing to help with
Ubuntu's Global Bug Jam in October:

...misinformation is a better term. I have six people in my neighborhood who
are now using Linux just fine and they didn't know much about Windows. So I
proves to me that once the system is set up with all the basic programs a
person can do just as well with Linux as Windows. Ubuntu, Mint and Mandriva
are my favorites for first time users.

I just want to give managers and other employees at a Best Buy or Office
Depot the opportunity to try Linux out first hand. Once they use it the fear
factor is broken. It may not change any policies, but it will give them
knowledge of another OS that they may like more than they thought.

Subject: [PLUG] computer case wheels
Message-ID: <20090911000954.GA4382@gate.kl-ic.com>

I want to put some wheels on some new computer cases for easy access.
I have 3 cases that sit under a bench (user + mail/backup server,
compute server, occasional use "clean machine" ).  Like all card
carrying geeks, I sometimes roll them out to fiddle with them.  

Commercially, I've seen "side clamp" and "X base clamp" wheels, both
of which kinda suck.  They stick out to the side too much, they 
interfere with opening the side, and the wheelbase is too short.
In the past, I bought hardware store furniture casters and attached
them to the case with holes drilled in the bottom.  

This time, I'm thinking about attaching the casters to a thin sheet
of plywood, then attaching the plywood to the case with adhesive-
backed velcro (no metal shavings in the case, no warranty issues).

But there might be something better out there that I haven't heard
about.  Suggestions?


Keith

BTW, two of the cases are Antec Sonata Designer 500's, ultra-quiet
and energy efficient, not at Fry's Wilsonville anymore, but
shippable to Wilsonville from their other stores.  They seem to 
be going obsolete, which is sad, because other cases are noisier
and more wasteful.  Sigh.

Our last experience with Office Depot in Gresham:

May I reboot this computer with a LiveCD version of Ubunutu?
No, Linux voids the warranty on any HP computer.

I came home and called HP...they confirmed that statement.

Just to be perfectly clear - they are saying that using a particular
piece of software can void a hardware warranty? Or is there something
else I'm not understanding?

I'd like to see them explain how they designed their hardware poorly
enough that software could harm it. Or is my knowledge of stuff that
far off? That's not really a significant possibility, is it?

I used to do Tech Support for HP, and that's not technically true. HP 
supports the software and hardware on the computer /as shipped/. Thus, 
they can't provide support for systems with Linux on them, because the 
troubleshooting tools that they ship with the system (and provide 
diagnostic codes that they use for setting up service orders) aren't on 
there, among other things. Thus, they need the customer to do a full 
system recovery first, to put Windows (and the diagnostic tools) back 
on. However, this in turn wipes the hard drive. It's not convenient, but 
it's not done out of total evil either.

As far as adding hardware goes - well, they can't support that, and if 
the system needs to be sent in for repair, they ask that the added part 
is removed and the original re-installed before you send it in. This is 
referring to home desktop computers by the way. I can't speak for the 
policies of the notebook department or the business desktop departments, 
because I didn't work in those.

Linux is not a revenue opportunity for the stores.  Of COURSE they will
only sell Windows.  Just like Computer City, or CompUsa, or PC Club,
or Good Guys, or ... (your favorite defunct computer store here).

Do you see a trend, here?

Microsoft revenue was down 23% last quarter.  That means less money
to peddle their nonsense.  Layoffs.  Fear.  Which will lower next
quarter's revenue even more.  I don't think they are smart enough to
downsize while retaining their lock on the minds of their users, 
with massive advertising and bribes to politicians.  Death spiral.

Is the trend becoming clear yet?  

The recession is not over - in fact, it is just getting started.
August unemployment was reported as the highest in 24 years.  
Meanwhile, garden seed sales are at an all time high.  

Best Buy and Office Depot may not be here in two years.  What "they
think" will not matter.  Meanwhile, our friends and neighbors will
no longer be able to afford the "my PC has a virus, buy a new one"
yearly cycle.  They will be volunteering at Free Geek to get repair
parts for their current machines.  The Windows licensing model does
not support that.  People will learn to maintain their computers
themselves.  Easy with Linux, almost impossible with Windows.  Smart
people will stop looking for easy, and start looking for empowerment. 
Windows is entertainment.  Linux is a survival tool.

Linux is as easy as it needs to be.  It can and should be easier, 
and some of us are working on that.  Mostly Linux should be more
empowering, providing survival capabilities to people who can't
afford retail.  Since geeks need to survive, too, we are more
likely to develop and provide open and adaptable solutions than
the proprietary folk.  And if we keep our eyes open, we are more
likely to find survivable niches when the money appears to be gone.

If we want Linux to dominate in the future, we should stop trying
to emulate dancing paper clips and learn how code, document, teach,
run a business, and most of all listen.  A new world is coming. 
I don't think it will have a place for a Microsoft monopoly. 
Whether it has a place for computation depends on us.

Unfortunately the big box stores aren't going to want to push linux 
because it isn't profitable. People know windows, and even if they don't 
like it, it's what they want because it's what they know. Also, if 
people move to linux then they learn about the advantages of FOSS and 
learn how many great open source alternative programs exist out there. 
If people learn about open source software then they are less likely to 
purchase proprietary software. By selling a linux computer the, the big 
box store my make the same amount of money as they would selling a 
windows computer, but they lose the opportunity to sell them proprietary 
software. Chances are if someone uses linux then they are unlikely to 
also purchase, an anti-virus & MSoffice & photo editing software & big 
name game titles & finance software and pretty much all the other little 
programs that are needed to flesh out a windows install but come free on 
linux. Most people buy all this stuff because they don't even know that 
are non-proprietary alternatives out there, many of which run on 
windows. If people never know or even hear about FOSS, or only hear 
about it in a bad way then they won't be tempted to try it and will 
continue to buy proprietary software for the rest of their lives. In 
regards to the problem with it being 'harder' then windows I feel this 
is subjective. I've found that teaching someone to use linux that has 
used windows or osX for any length of time is difficult mostly because 
they need to unlearn all the bad habits they've picked up. On the other 
hand if starting with someone that has never used a computer before in 
their life it's pretty easy to teach them how to perform basic functions 
on linux such as web browsing, Email, word processing, etc. Also in 
regards to the 'linux invalidates the HP warranty' discussion, I 
currently do HP tech support and as of right now, installing linux does 
not invalidate the warranty but in order to recieve technical support 
you would have to reformat/reinstall the original version of windows the 
computer came with. This isn't just for linux either though, this is 
true even with another windows based OS, if you buy a computer that 
comes with vista and install XP (or windows7) on it, the system would 
need to be formatted and the original OEM OS reinstalled to recieve 
technical support.


Do not be afraid to joust a giant just because some people believe in 
windmills.

I'm not responding specifically to any posts on this discussion so far but I
think the reasoning behind it has to do with Google releasing Chrome next

There is proprietary software for Linux, but it is sold online
a lot of times by small companies.  I for one think it's an HP
and it comes with tech support is dubious at best.  This is
often not so great where a lot of times it means that there is 
something about the computer that makes it difficult to use 
Linux.  There is a weird BIOS or there is an integrated sound 
card that doesn't work in Linux or something else.

One company that sells games for Linux is 
http://www.mygamecompany.com/.
Lately, I hear they are adding a new Linux title every month.

Another proprietary software package for Linux is Crossover Linux.

Vmware Workstation is a proprietary software package for Linux.

For a while at least, HP offered a Linux based laptop and/or desktop
system.  Don't know if this is the case anymore.

I wish I had the skills to start my own software company that
specializes in selling useful proprietary programs for Linux
at reasonable prices.  I would try to open source that
software over time.  I would love to get my hands on the source
code to Mapinfo for example and bring it over to Linux.  If I
could get my hands on TurboTax and port it, it would probably
take very little work to update it.

Another thing I wish I could do is significantly help the ReactOS
developers get their Windows XP replacement stabilized.  I question
if having a Windows compatible operating system under the GPL is
doable or even the best approach, but there do seem to be some
applications that just don't get ported.  A lot of games don't
get ported and Crossover Games only goes so far.

I would like to see the big stores get hurt when it comes
to selling computers if those computers continue to be fairly useless
when you don't use Windows on them.  If I buy a Windows machine and I
want to run Linux on it, I should be able to do that and still have a
warranty.

The Linux Asus Eee PC by the way has been working quite well for my
nephew and it comes that way.  The guy at Preheim computers that 
sold it to me said he hates Linux, but that didn't deter me.

Subject: [PLUG] SRM console...
Message-ID: <1252666928.24056.13.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I need it and I can't get it.  I need SRM console to install a 
modern version of Linux on my Alpha PC164 system.  I found 1 
person on Ebay selling an Alpha PC164LX motherboard with the 
processor, nothing else sadly, who says that the board has 
SRM console on it.  I asked him if he can get a copy of it
to me.

The HOWTOs on http://www.alphalinux.org need to be updated so
that they point to a place on the Internet that you can actually
download SRM console from.  I take it that HP or Compaq owns 
Alpha now, but it seems to be killed where the HP web site doesn't
let you get to anything pertaining to the Alpha.  What's worse
is that HP doesn't support the PC164 Alpha only listing Alpha
server machines.

I'm having the same problem with Microsoft in regards to Windows
NT 4.0 Alpha.

I can't install a Linux distribution that is any newer than Redhat
6.2 on my Alpha system.  Redhat 7.1 is supposed to be milo 
compatible, but I can't install it from milo for some reason.
Obviously, I'd be better off installing CentOS 4.2 which 
definitely requires SRM console.

Does anyone know of a mirror of digital equipment corporations
ftp site with the last version of SRM console that works with my
PC164 Alpha?

Linus, if you hear about this problem, please ask the Alpha 
maintainers to start working on an open source replacement 
for SRM console.  It is ridiculous that MILO, the open source
loader for Linux on Alpha, got abandoned in favor of SRM 
console which I can't get my hands on.

On second thought, maybe I should forget about trying to educate employees
of these stores. Just let them know they have an option and they will learn
about Linux like the rest of us.

It is too bad the public site is no longer available (it used to
be one of the ftp://ftp.dec.com properties).

I think this is what you are looking for:

which is the only one I have a copy of.

Good luck,

Anyone on the list a Verizon Mobile Broadband user?

I'm looking at the MiFi device (verses the USB modem/dongle) but to

Windows program.

Any ideas as to how to get around using a Windows system?  I have some

You only need to have it activated once by using a windows or os x
system. After you can use a dialer like wvdial to run the modem inside
linux.

that has been my experience with prior verizon mobile broadband
products (2 of them).  "dialing up" under linux actually happens
automagically (via network manager) since ubuntu 8.10 (or anyway, does
with xubuntu/xfce, i don't use gnome)

It's not about truth, it's about incentives. Retailers don't know how
to make money off of Free Software. They're pretty good at making
money off of proprietary software. No doubt Microsoft is ready to
grease the palms of their retail partners if they appear to be getting
any subversive ideas, too.

Subject: [PLUG] Motherboards
Message-ID: <20090911174314.GB8558@gate.kl-ic.com>

I'm upgrading motherboards for my desktop/mail/backup server.  The
old 2002 Rambus machine is too power hungry and slow.  I'm looking
for decent speed ( > Atom, but by not much ), low electrical power,
DVI, Intel socket 775, more memory.  Linux friendly (of course),
with the additional constraint that I do not want to upgrade distros
quite yet, so it needs to work with the 2.6.18 kernel and the 1.1.1
xorg-x11-server that come with Scientific Linux 5.3 (RHEL5 clone).

My first attempt was an Intel DG43NB from the 4 letter F word place
in Wilsonville.  I should have done more research first.  There are
some buggy Intel G43/X4500 video drivers that can be compiled for
the newest xorg.  For older xorg you need to use VESA (which does not
offer 1400x1050 like my LCD).  You also need to compile new ethernet
drivers.  Other problems, like the CPU temp sensor doesn't read out
(even in the BIOS).   Some of the peripheral chips get too hot.  I
assumed Intel supported Linux well.  Not so much ...

My next attempt will be a Gigabyte GA-73PVM-S2H, on the way from
Amazon now.  It has good ratings here:
  http://hardware4linux.info/system/3529/
and uses onboard NVidia (which seems to have good drivers that get
updated with my distro).  Not the fastest video, but adequate for
flash and youtube.  

Another interesting board is the MSI P7NGM .  Pacific Solutions has
one in stock for $133, and NewEgg has them on sale for $90 .  That 
is more powerful (Nvidia 9300 graphics), but probably uses more 
electricity.  The next step if the Gigabyte disappoints.

There are some off-brand boards available.  And BioHazard\\\\\\Star,
which has terrible reviews for reliability.

Other suggestions?  It is a little frustrating trying to build a
quiet, low power system in a screw-the-planet gamer's world.

Reading Keith's mail and this one just caused a business model to spring,
fully grown, out of my head (just like Athena from Zeus, except my
headache wasn't so bad and no one had to go after me with an ax).

Problem:  Ultimately, only techie geeks can keep a computer going
indefinitely.  Just as cars need mechanics, computers need geeks. 
(Currently Windows users are solving this with the 'new computer every
year' behavior).

Problem:  Office Despot and company need money, and can't get it selling
free software.

Solution:  Do like the car dealers do (not to mention Fry's).  Sell the
computer, then sell the service for it.  Sell extended warranties.  Sell
on-site service.  Sell remote log-on service (ooh, won't that enhance
security!).  Sell books on how to use open software.  Sell _classes_ on
how to use open software.  There are tons of opportunities to make $$ in a
free software culture, many of which are compatible with an Office DepMax
sort of business.  So, embrace them.

Of course, this can't be done on a store manager level -- the Office
Whatevers of the world would have to make these decisions at the corporate
level.  But it would mean that the sale of a computer would be the

Oh, for that "Linux Ready" sticker.

The dual-core atom 330 at 1.6GHz seems to do pretty well for tina so far 
(openoffice, firefox, gimp.)  The intel graphics performance is 
dissappointing with dual-head though.

It does appear to wedge itself under heavy load -- that is either 
overheating (it's a fanless CPU but has a fan on the GPU -- not much 
room for fans in this shuttle case) or maybe it is something to do with 
the OCZ SSD getting ahead of everything.  Not sure if this graphics 
chip would work on the old kernel/X, but you probably want to put a big 
slow fan on it somewhere because I don't think the fanless thing is 
working here.

An asus board with onboard nvidia and one of the 45W AMD's (did they 
quit making these?) would probably be my next option.

> work with the 2.6.18 kernel

That might be a trick.

Paul, you are correct it's not about the truth, it's about money. But little
by little the public will find out about Linux and FOSS and they are the
ones that will benefit from it and hopefully some of us will make money from
our services to them.

You'll get nowhere. The stores are just following orders from corporate. 
Corporate is getting fat checks from MS or other incentives and unless 
you have something better to offer you'll get nowhere. They just want to 
make money.

What you could do is get 5 brand new random laptops and a few carts full 
of brand new peripherals, make a YouTube video showing these things 
working in a way plug-n-play was meant to be. Of course they had better 
work. :) Most likely any troubles you do have would be similar to 
installing peripherals on Windows with all the driver/app bundling bloat 
going on for some time now. Oh what's that? You don't have $10K lying 
around to spend to get this all done? Yeah, me neither. But this 
document got out to the public, and the best way to fight it would be 
the same. Not at the stores.

I think Linux does a great job keeping up with new devices. But I think 
where Windows fails miserably is with legacy hardware. My wife uses 
Windows XP on a Dell Inspiron 600M. This laptop is about 6 years old 
now. But, it has 2GB of memory and a 160GB hard drive with a 1.8GHz 
Pentium-M. I threw Win7 on it to see how it would work, and while 
overall performance was actually pretty on par with XP, the ATI Mobility 
wasn't supported under 7 (or Vista for that matter). I got a driver that 
finally worked, but some of the built-in apps still wouldn't run 
claiming the video card wasn't sufficient. A perfectly usable laptop 
except for one unremovable peripheral. I don't know whether to blame MS, 
ATI or Dell more. If you don't mention the age of the machine, the specs 
don't look half bad, and plenty to run any modern OS. But I find 
especially with older video cards, scanners and some printers that this 
latest set of slides slamming Linux is pretty hypocritical.

While individual we may not be able to do this, but we could
collectively.  Every time we get a new piece of hardware, we create a
YouTube video of how we got it working and what we can do with it.  In
short, flood YouTube with Linux HowTos.

Oh, what's that?  You don't know how to create and edit YouTube videos
with linux.  Yeah, me neither.

Intel graphics is an issue with the older X, and I am in the Atom++
league because backups really thrash the machine and the SATA interfaces.
The motherboard will be going into a Antec Sonata Designer III case; I
already have the RAM and the Mondo-big-and-slow cooling fan for the CPU.


Side note - the noise of a fan goes up as the 3rd power of the airspeed.
So a fan with twice the diameter moving the same air volume will be
moving that air at 1/4 the speed, with (area / noise-per-area) 
= 4/64 times the noise.  Or 12dB quieter.  80mm => 2x120mm is 13dB
quieter.  Big cases are good, shuttle cases are small and cute but
noisy and failure prone.

I wouldn't know how to do it in Windows, but a synaptic search returns three
packages that claim to be video editors.  Just attach your V4l-compliant AV

meh @ howto's. It would just need to work.

Alternatively, you could demonstrate the idiocracy in the Windows 
versions and feature split. For example:

Bitlocker: Only in Ultimate and Enterprise. NOT in business or Home 
Editions. Not even in the biz version? Really?

DVD Maker: While you'll find Movie Maker in all versions of Vista/7, DVD 
Maker is only in Home Premium and Ultimate. Continuity?

Backup: All have the backup feature. However Vista Home editions can't 
do full disk backups. The selection is simply omitted. (not sure about 7 
here)

Volume Shadow Copies/Previous Versions: A really cool feature built in 
file versioning feature that is built into all versions of Vista, except 
Home editions. However the framework is there, so you have to download a 
free 3rd party utility that gives you the ability to quickly restore a 
previous version of a file or a deleted file.

I could go on. It's just like they're drunk and throwing darts at 
features to determine what goes where. How are people suppose to know 
about all this stuff? They don't!

100% agree.  I was thinking more along the lines of the old iMac commercials:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHzM4avGrKI

The videos should highlight the features of Linux that do indeed "just work."

MS has been kind enough to highlight what it thinks are Linux's
weaknesses.  A few nice video showing otherwise would be nice.

I'm not so interested in pointing out MS's weaknesses.  That's not my
passion.  Making Linux better is.

Well, I got CentOS 4.3 to install on my PC164 Alpha system, but 
with only 64 megs of ram I don't think I can run X.  I'm trying 
a reinstall right now after I dropped in a D-Link ISA network 
card in plug and play mode ( had to use a freedos PC to set 
the nic up that way ).

Some questions I have:

   Can SRM console and ARC console be installed to the 
   motherboard at the same time?

   Can the arc command under SRM console be redirected to a FAT 
   partition on a local hard drive instead of the disk drive?

   Does anyone know if X doesn't support the Matrox Millenium
   II graphics adapter well?

   Why when I run Xorg -configure do I totally lose control
   of the system?

I might have to try Debian Lenny for Alpha again.  Problem is,
Debian doesn't seem to recognize the DVD writer.  I wonder if
using low density cable when the USB cage used high density
cable is a problem?

This system uses 72 pin simms that have to be ECC type I believe.
I'm wondering if it's even possible to pick up 64 meg FPM 70 ns
72 pin simms anymore?  With 8 of these, I'd have enough memory
probably.  On the other hand, I spotted a PC164LX that takes
4 ECC PC100 DIMMS with the 533 mhz processor.

I'm wanting to get a 2.6 kernel based Linux system running on 
my Alpha with X, but I'm not too keen on doing hardware 
upgrades to get there.

It is at least possible to find the RAM you mentioned:

http://www.memory4less.com/m4l_itemdetail.asp?rid=fd_10&itemid=1438949855

sale price 165.23... have fun with that.

At the risk of opening Pandora's box..... why are you spending so much time
on Alpha stuff?

   Has anyone here come across a form prepared by a state agency that cannot
be modified in OO.o's Writer? Even saved as .odt it cannot be filled in.

   This is the first time I've come across this situation, but I suspect it
won't be the last. I've downloaded a couple of version 1.5 pdf files from a
state agency Web site and they will not open with xpdf, but will with
acroread.

   If someone wants to try the .doc file I'll send it directly.

Protecting documents against modification is kind of a joke... if you
can read the data (i.e. it's not encrypted or you know the encryption
key), you can change it.  It's just a protection mechanism only
enforcable in software you use to read it.  

In my grad school crypto class, we cracked the Excel hashes used to
enforce this exact type of protection (though I don't know if it is
the same for .doc files).  I reversed the weak hash using pen and
paper, so not only is the protection pointless since you can just
remove the hash from the file header, but you can also figure out the
password used to protect the document.

Anyway, I thought there was a way to remove this kind of modification
protection in documents through open office.  Maybe somewhere in the
security preferences or something.  The harder stuff to get around is
the read-protection encryption (though it's also somewhat weak), but
this should be easy to disable in theory and hopefully practice as
well.  If you easily remove it without knowing the hash, there should
be a number of .doc file password crackers out there you could use.

Good luck,
tim

MS Office was never known for strong protection.  Write-protection could be
eliminated by saving the doc as RTF.  Read-protection went the same way, but
one had to know the key first.

Yep, a slew of them.

Tim,

   It's even more of a joke when the document is intended to be filled in on
the computer. They provide a .pdf version for those who want to fill it out
by hand, and a .doc for filling in on the computer. The file was not
supposed to be read-only.

   I think this is a result of the state government using only Microsoft
products and not conforming to open standards. They assume that everyone
uses the same junk and make no accommodation for anyone else. I think it's
analogous to the state buying only one brand of vehicles and forbidding any
other vehicle brand from parking in a state lot. It's annoying. On top of
the hassles I have with several federal agency bureaucrats it's not a
welcome event.

Thanks for your thoughts,

Rich

Eh, unless they didn't create the PDF this way, or your software doesn't 
have this capability, PDF's can be filled out on your computer for some 
time now.

   Sigh. I can no longer clearly communicate. I wrote that the .pdf is for
those who want to print the form and fill it out manually, not as a fillable
PDF file.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0909160951270.28205@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   For a reason I do not know, OpenOffice.org will not start this morning,
and I need to finish a document today. I was running OO.o-3.0.0, so I
decided to see if upgrading to the latest version would fix the problem. It
won't.

   I got the -3.1.1 tarball, but my SlackBuild script fails to complete
because it cannot stat a usr/ directory (but doesn't tell me the parent
directory). Anyway, searching for the problem's source I discovered that
/usr/bin/soffice is a link to /opt/openoffice3.org/program/soffice, and the
application loads if I invoke it as root, but not if I try to invoke it as a
user. /usr/bin/soffice has 777 permissions.

   /opt is owned by root.root with 777 permissions.
   /opt/openoffice.org and /opt/openoffice.org3 are owned by rshepard.users
with 755 permissions.

   What might have happened? More importantly, how do I fix the system so I
can again invoke OO.o?

If all else fails, run it in strace.  That should tell you exactly
which file it fails to stat.

Carlos,

   I'm not educated sufficiently to understand the strace output. It ends
this way:

rt_sigaction(SIGINT, {0x807b8d0, [], 0}, {SIG_DFL}, 8) = 0
waitpid(-1, ^C <unfinished ...>

and you can see where I terminated the wait.

   I could send the entire output, but it looks like it's trying to load
totally unrelated libraries, too.

Thanks,

Rich

   Here's an update: after about 3 minutes the application loaded! I wonder
what's going on here.

   BTW, I have the strace output if anyone would look at it for me.

Thanks,

if i were you, i'd make sure all the files in the openoffice user
directory are owned by you, not root.
i still use v2.4 and the directory in question is ~/.openoffice.org2/,
not sure if it changed for v3.

This behavior seems to indicate some sort of failed network
connection.  Oo must be trying to make a network connection for some
god-awful reason.  Maybe do a wireshark packet trace?

Not sure about the image issue.  I had to reinstall googleearth today
because some recent (gentoo) updates shook things up.  It was
complaining about its bundled libpng.so being the wrong version.
Again I suggest strace, or maybe just try launching Oo from an xterm
so that you can see any stderr messages in the shell.

I would be happy to look at your strace output.  But I won't be able
to give it the attention it deserves until tonight.  Why not get a new
strace with the 3 minute wait and image problem.  I realize it will be
huge; that's fine.

Carlos

Chris,

   Yes, all files in /opt/openoffice.org3/ are owned by me.

That is not the directory i'm talking about.  I'm talking about where
openoffice writes its per-user files.  It will be somewhere in your
home directory.

Chris,

   Oh. Yes, all files in ~/.openoffice/ and its subdirectories are owned by
me.

I run strace like so:

  strace -f -o /tmp/strace-foo <normal-commandline>

The '-f' says follow any forks (if it spawns any children, trace them
too), the '-o /tmp/strace-foo' says redirect the output to the
filename you provide.  

When it finishes, open /tmp/strace-foo with /usr/bin/less and start
hunting around for open() or similar calls that fail.  Probably most
expeditious to start at the bottom and work up.  Strace generates lots
of volume, a tiny fraction of which is very interesting, but your
error is in there somewhere and by judicious guessing, you'll identify
it before long.

   Thank you, Russell.

   This issue has been mooted; 3.0.0 loaded fine (and quickly) after a couple
of times, and I've upgraded to 3.1.1. That loads just fine, too.

   The image issue remains to be resolved; I'm trying to identify the source
of the problem.

Carlos,

   The loading issue has been resolved. I've also upgraded to 3.1.1 and that

   Me, neither. I'm working on it.

   I was not aware of that option since it has apparently always been active

I'm just happy that you're rolling again.  C'mon, admit it, who hasn't

First, the ~/openpoffice config files are -2 for version 2.0, but for
version 3.x they just kept the "2." No, wait ... I think for 3.x they
reverted to no number at all. I don't remember for sure. I now have
3.0.1 Ubuntu-Go version (from Synaptic) and I have both a -2 and a -no
number config file, but the no-number file is older than the -2 file. I
remember that I installed 3.0 from OOo back in the days of Intrepid but
kept the 2.4 Intrepid version side by side. The config file numbering
was weird and counter-intuitive.

Whatever config file you have, you can rename it and OOo will create a
new one next time you launch it. You'll just lose all your custom
settings (toolbars, window sizes, dictionary and autocorrect entries,
extensions, and a few other user things). Whenever something is messed
up this is an easy way to figure out if it is a user configuration
issue or if the problem lies elsewhere.

Second, version 3.x has an automatic check for updates that requires a
net connection. I think you can disable it in Tools > Preferences, but
IIRC it is on by default. If OOo is trying to phone home, this is
probably why.

Why Alpha got into the hands of Compaq followed by HP, I am not certain.

Sadly, Alpha could have been a significant alternative to Itanium that
would have competed well if it had been continued.

The market is dominated by Intel and this is not healthy.  The IA32 
and Itanium architecture are probably highly complex and complicated.  
A simpler architecture built for speed like the Alpha should in 
theory be easier to support Linux on.

Should Sparc die out because it is not an Intel compatible architecture?

Heck, these days Intel even makes the Mac.

But seriously, why did a computer architecture that was creaming the
IA32 architecture on floating point lose to the Itanium architecture?

I suppose AMD processors, which are not a different architecture really
from Intel's, are the only alternative left in the mini and micro
computer world.

The Wintel monopoly is well known and frankly it is sickening that these
two companies work so closely together.  The DEC Alpha could have broken
that up a bit.  Intel Mac and Intel PC are not enough, there need to be
more choices than that.  It's kinda like saying, "You can have any car
you want, as long as it's black."

There are a few problems with Alpha that show how tightly Intel and
Microsoft are married.  Windows NT 4.0 on Alpha is out of support now,
but even before support ended there was no easy way to know where to
get Windows NT Alpha software where the PC version wouldn't work.
FX32 wasn't that great.  On the other hand, this poor support for
Windows software translates to poor support for Windows viruses and
worms.  Using an Alpha for a server instead of a PC is theoretically
safer.  Using the Alpha these days is like using Latin.

I don't see trying to upgrade the memory in my Alpha as opening
Pandora's box at all.  I don't like where computers are today.
I don't like that Linux used to run on 5 or 6 different computer
architectures equally well where these days it only seems to run 
well on just one or two.  Does Redhat even support Linux on 
Sparc anymore?  Is Sparc dead?  How about MIPS and PowerPC?  
PowerPC is an interesting concept, a powerful computer that 
can run software meant for both Macs and IBM compatible 
personal computers.  What happened to that concept?

Why isn't there a software company supporting a non Itanium computer
architecture that isn't tied to Intel?  Intel is becoming too 
powerful.  Windows should have lost major market share a long time
ago, but Intel has been tying the most common computer hardware to
it.  Even Mac these days uses Intel hardware.

I think the Alpha is a great architecture with no hacks like the IA32
and Itanium architectures.  Alpha's have a young architecture that was
never taken to it's full potential.

I know you got it going, but you might check for a full partition, that
is the usual reason that a user can't run a program, but root can
(ext2/3 file systems reserve some of the partition for roots exclusive
use).

Good luck,

To sum up, it sounds like you use it because it specifically is not Intel or
Intel compatible.

Three cheers for the little guy who coulda been a contenda...
>From what I understand the reason Alpha didn't go any further was marketing
(or lack thereof), not technical.

I don't have any Alpha, but I have a PPC based NEXT slab workstation around
somewhere, and a G4 and a couple G3 PowerBooks.  I also run AMD64 in my main
desktop.  But I do have a couple Intel laptops and a netbook.

I don't want to see Intel going down or anything, they happen to be a big
part of the Oregon economy (jobs being a big part of that)- but I do agree
lately the market has thinned too much.  The last major holdout was
Apple/PPC.

That being said, you have to admit, without Intel, how likely is it, we
would all have our own personal computers at home (or several), instead of
sitting at a teletype logged into a mainframe?

Message-ID: <20090918002151.GA32575@gate.kl-ic.com>

Greetings, gentlebeings!

The little hand is on the 3rd week, and the big hand is creeping
towards Sunday September 20, when we will have Yet Another Episode
of The Linux Clinic, featuring YOU, the Linux user with pesky old
Linux problems that you would like to trade in for shiny new ones!

We meet, as always, at Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th Ave, between 1PM
and 5PM.  We have displays and keyboards and meece.  We have wifi
and wired ethernet and power.  We have crazy people who think they
can help you solve your Linux problems.  You have a desktop or a
laptop you want help debugging, or you like to help others, or you
just want to prove you are crazier than the rest of us combined!

This is not a class - we don't even know what class is.  The rest
of the building is closed - no store, no donations.

This month, I will be bringing 10 surplus Cisco Aironet 350 
802.11B PCMCIA wireless adapters ( AIR-PCM352 fccid:LDK102040 ),
which we can peddle to those tempted to purchase the driverless
crap they sell at Frys.  Begone, spawn of Satan!  The Ciscos are
untested, but they should work well with the airo_cs driver.  It
would be great if some wireless guru would show up and help us
test and deploy these on the random laptops that appear Sunday.

BTW, please leave the parking spaces near the front door,
and the table space near the inside door, free for people
with mobility problems.

Assuming John brings the key as usual, see you Sunday!

Keith

I know there are some Python coders out there.  Maybe someone could
answer me this:

What is the hot setup for Python web development?  Is there something
analogous to Ruby on Rails, Struts, or Hunchentoot for Python?  A
framework that simply everybody is using, and for good reason?

The reason I'm asking is because I want to get my hands dirty in
Python, and I don't want to spend a lot of time going down dead ends.

Carlos,

   There's django ... and this Web site:

                  <http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks>

   I also saw a Google reference to a link for the Ruby on Rails equivalent.
I'm using python for our fuzzy system models, but know nothing about Web
development with anything other than xhtml and css.

You should hook up with the python group in town. They're #pdxpython on

   I did a couple of years or so ago.

   For Carlos, that would be very useful since many of the folks there focus

mod_python http://www.modpython.org/ It's the easiest and works like a champ.

pyjamas looks promising (http://pyjs.org/), but it only handles the UI
side. As far as I know it does nothing for the DB side.

Wow, I just read up on mod_python and it is cool!  I am going to
consider it for a small, specific project: a database intermediary
that runs queries on behalf of another program.

I guess I'm not so much looking for the best python web framework,
silly as that may sound.  I'm looking for the one that the most
employers would want me to be familiar with.  Hopefully the python
community is so with-it that they naturally gravitate toward the best
solution.

   Well, Carlos. There goes the weekend. You'll need to become an expert in
django, turbogears, pyjamas, and mod_python to cover all the bases.

Being an Ag School grad, I thought this was just a rehash of something 
we've known about for years. But then I saw the "u" in the word cloud.

Remember back when "Web Services" was the catch phrase?  Or "Service
Oriented Architecture"?  "Agile" is still hanging on.  These and other
terms are the lifeline that technically deficient managers cling to in
an attempt to feel like they are keeping the operations of their
departments in sight (or at least on a spreadsheet-agenda).  They
should be less worried about how the programmers are doing, and pay
more attention to their own methodologies.

I should just get a subscription to Oracle Magazine because that's
what IT managers use as their self-improvement study manual.

Carlos,

   How about that? All this time I thought it was the Microsoft ads they
used.

   Has anyone here successfully built and installed QScintilla? It's a port
of the Python scintilla editor to Qt, and apparently needed to build a
SQLite management tool called sqliteman. I can't figure out the pwd to get
the silly thing to build.

   The source is in /opt/src/QScintilla-gpl-2.4/ and the qscintilla.pro file
in in the Qt4/ subdirectory under that. The instructions are to

cd Qt4
gmake qscintilla.pro

   Here, the latest (-4.5.2) Qt is in /usr/lib/qt4. If I change to that
directory it cannot find qscintilla.pro even with the full path specified.
If I change to the directory with the .pro file, it tells me there's nothing
to be done with gmake. Checkmate.

I read the documentation here,

  http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/static/Docs/QScintilla2/index.html

It actually says to run "qmake qscintilla.pro" (with a 'q'), not
"gmake". It's a very easy thing to miss!

Hope that helps.

I have it on my gentoo boxes because it is a dependency of Tora.  But
gentoo builds it, not me.  But it builds from source.  So maybe
something can be learned by looking at the ebuild (below).

The file that is downloaded by this ebuild is
http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/static/Downloads/QScintilla2/QScintilla-gpl-2.4.tar.gz

I downloaded this file and stared building it.  Got past the
qscintilla.pro step fine.  Is this the same tarball you are using?  If
so, then the problem is probably your qt4 environment.  If not, try
it!

Heath,

   Well, duh! I read the same instructions but kept seeing 'g' rather than
'q'. Sheesh!

Oregon Institute of Technology has a good BSCS or BSIT program that is 
mostly online.  I'm enrolled in the BSIT program since I'm doing mostly 
business and database apps now.  The information is at 
http://www.oit.edu/portland/it and http://www.oit.edu/portland/set.  My 
criteria were that the program had to be online, and had to be 
accredited so I could get tuition reimbursement.
I also found one at the University of Illinois, I don't recall the exact 
details but that it was hard to get into.  University of Phoenix and 
DeVry both have programs (DeVry is even accredited) but I think a degree 
from a real college will carry more weight.

Well, be careful here...

Accredited means different things to different people.

ITT is accredited but, their credits DON"T transfer anywhere.
So for example if you received a Bachelors degree from ITT and wanted to
get a Masters....      NO ONE would accept that degree.. Except ITT.
You could go back there and get credit..

Same thing with Associates Degree.. Get it at ITT and most colleges in
the area will not recognize it..

Not sure DeVry is the same.....
There are A LOT of uncredited schools out there.

I took some continuing education on line from University of IL. and was
very  happy..


Good luck with that..

I am leaving shortly for the Clinic. If some at the Clinic are
interested it would be fun to see about setting it up. 

However, while at Free Geek we can receive e-mail, but not send.
However, I personally have a fabulous device for communicating with
others in real time. I call it my "telephone."

I've been quiet so far, but I'm trying to get a CS bachelors degree
myself and the following are my thoughts and experiences:

1) Getting the degree completely on line, even from University of 
   Phoenix, is not possible.  I talked to University of Phoenix and 
   was told to attend courses on a campus.

2) The requirements are changing even at PSU, and frankly the degree is
   valuable because it is hard to get it.  There is a ridiculous
   amount of math and statistics that you have to take for example.
   I still have hard courses ahead of me even though I'm technically
   beyond what the fussers guide says I need to pass to be a CS major.

3) A bachelor's degree will in all likelihood not teach you what you
   need to know depending on what you are going to do, but it puts
   you in a different category compared to a person who doesn't have
   one.

4) Computer science is a lonely field, seriously consider social work
   or something else before you commit potentially 10 years or more to
   getting through engineering school.  If you want to meet and work
   with people, this may be the wrong field for you.

5) If it is taking you a long time, don't be afraid to see a doctor in
   the event that depression is setting in and slowing you down.  There
   are a lot of depressed people who are aren't getting any help even 
   at PSU.  The statistics are 1 in 3.

6) Be prepared to be treated like you are going to be an engineer even
   if you really want to be a programmer and could care less about 
   hardware.

7) Be aware that what you really need in the computer science field is
   credibility and that is what a traditional bachelors degree is for,
   not education.  With that in mind, a DeVry or ITT degree might work
   if you pile the appropriate certs on top of it.  That said though,
   why go to ITT for a degree if you can get a traditional one that
   everyone will respect?

8) Don't expect to get through in 4 years.  I graduated high school in 
   1998 and I'm still working on my first bachelor's degree.  The number
   of credits to be a computer science major at PSU is >180 by a 
   significant amount and none of that is underwater basket weaving.
   I got an Associates degree at PCC which helps considering that it
   secures me as a junior even though computer science is changing 
   rapidly.

9) Don't take discrete mathematics at PCC like I did.  I took it too 
   long ago and it didn't cover the material that CS250 does at PSU.  
   I'm signed up for CS311 and frankly I'm a bit worried.

At OIT there are some of the gen-ed classes that are not on-line but are 
at least taught in Portland.

Ridiculous amounts of math is why I chose the BSIT app-programming 
degree instead of CS, plus lot's of very applicable knowledge (at least 
if you are doing database and business intelligence stuff like I am).

Right.  Also I need a degree to teach credit classes at PCC.

Actually PSU has a Computer Engineering degree, at least they did a few 
years ago, that has more hardware focus.  What I found about the CS 
degree is it is more theory and algorithms instead of practical 
knowledge, not many jobs for compiler optimization out there.

Which is why I'm at OIT instead of DeVry.

However do take Java at PCC instead of VB (business programming) at 
OIT.  And definitely take
CIS 275 _Data Modeling and SQL Intro_

How to do this effectively for a Bachelors level degree is probably

There is a good reason for the math - it's the foundation of CS.  If
you want to be a technician go to a tech school.

This is true.  I've seen pin-headed bosses try and fire excellent 
systems programmers simply because they didn't have a bachelors.

I've never found it to be lonely, even when I was working from home
as a contractor.  Then again, one of the things I learn while getting
my bachelors was how to deal with and respect people I found personally
distasteful.

Different people have different paces.  And different circumstances.
A good friend of mine got his degree in 4 years, I was on the 7 year
plan.


There is more to school than studying, taking tests, and working
on project. Even underwater basket weaving can teach important
lessons.

Don't know if the simms I got aren't parity or what the problem is, but
my Alpha PC164 won't start when I plug them in.  They must be EDO simms.
Counting the chips on them there are 18 which seems to suggest that they
are parity, but that's no guarantee.  At least I only paid $20 for them.
They say 64 on them and HP so I guess they are 64 meg.

Indeed.  This x27d seems to have torched itself. Fanless CPU is 
apparently a bad idea in the dual-core atom.  It was actually fairly 
quiet, but maybe that's why it no longer exists.

Now back to the research drawing-board.  Might be easiest to go with the 
Asus M2N68 and a 45W AMD as the "devil I know".

That is:  this Asus will do suspend-to-disk, but not to ram.  Anyone 
have good experiences with a more recent board?

Hello Roger.

Attached is my resume. I have not had a six on/six off job before, but  
I believe it would work well with what I am doing at this time in my  
life. The six on would allow for some income and additional  
experience, and the six off would allow for personal projects and the  
many outdoor activities that I enjoy with my friends and family.

I'm typing this on a new Gigabyte GA-73PVM-S2H Intel socket 775
mobo.  Antec Sonata Designer silent case with Earthwatt 500W supply. 
The mobo has builtin Nvidia GeForce 7100 video and Nvidia nForce
630i ethernet.  I'm running RHEL5(clone) with an ancient 2.6.18
kernel.  I had to compile new nvidia and forcedeth modules ( a
temporary PCI ethernet card moved the bits).  I've booted it with
various Ubuntu live CDs ( >=8.04 ), which come up in VESA mode ).

The machine is initializing dirvish backups right now, so I can't
tweek or reboot it for a while, but the mobo manual mentions 
ACPI S1(POS) "Power on Suspend" and S3(STR) "Suspend To RAM"
sleep states.  I don't know what kernels those work with.

If you want to bring a SATA drive with your favorite distro over
here to KLIC World Headquarters, you can check it out.  Limited
time offer - I shut down my noisy old server and cut over to this
machine on Sunday.

Keith

PS:  I picked the board because it is not ASUS ( which is allegedly
becoming more Linux hostile, YMMV ), Intel processor but not an
Intel peripheral chipset ( new drivers break old kernels ), and
has built in DVI video.

Despite the fact that I've heard this from several people, experience
shows that this just isn't true. It may be harder to find a place that
will take ITT credits, but there are places that will accept them. One
person who got an associate Degree at ITT is now getting a bachelor's
degree from Franklin University (http://www.franklin.edu/). I even had
a pleasant experience with PSU seeing if my ITT Credits would
transfer. Though, I didn't follow through as my interest in PSU was
due to financial aid problems and the school corrected them, so it's
not a total confirmation of transferability.

It sounds funny to say, given the proliferation of Linux distros, but
I think there is room for even more with a focus on lessening the
having-the-cake/eating-the-cake trade-off ...

... by reducing this complexity where possible.  That means, either:

1) more distros that don't offer every piece of software under the
sun, all packaged up with a wing-and-a-prayer that it might, sorta
mostly work.

or

2) more distros that provide a stable, standards-compliant base that
users can rely on while they add/install/tweak software they install
from source or some standardized, simplified packaging.  Think
somewhere between Slackware and Arch Linux.

Exactly.  Doesn't that beg the question, do people really want
smaller, more focused distros, with well-tested and relatively
up-to-date software?  Or do they want kitchen-sink distros with
practically everything packaged, even if that means that stablility is
only possible by using older software or currency is only possible by
putting up with wonky apps and frequent updates?

In the absence of Microsoft-like capitalization to conduct extensive
focus groups, it seems to me just judging from the popularity of
what's out there now, they mostly want the latter.  But maybe that's
just because standardization efforts have only gotten so far, and it
seems will only ever get so far, given the resistance they face.

True, a narrower focus in a distro helps you provide both timeliness
and stability.  Of course then the community ends up becoming more
fragmented with loads of duplication of effort, with each package
being packaged hundreds of times with slight tweaks.  This leads to
your next point...

Yup, this is what Debian is becoming.  Debian uses the Filesystem
Hierarchy Standard for directory layouts, categorizes software
carefully based on your ability to redistribute it, and makes adding
your own "special sauce" very easy.

For instance, if you want your own custom distro that focuses on, say,
audio/video software, you can have your users install a stable Debian
distribution and then just ask them to add one line to
/etc/apt/sources.list:

  deb http://custom-packages-server.example.com/ stable main

Now, if your custom packages (which can be tweaked versions of
Debian's distributed source packages that you compile) simply have a
version number greater than the default Debian packages for that
particular package, then yours overrides.  Since Debian stable doesn't
change very often, you only need to maintain more up-to-date versions
of the specific packages you're interested in.

Oh, and by the way, someone is already maintaining a more up to date
and all-inclusive audio/video repository for Debian:
  http://www.debian-multimedia.org/


So the key is to have the flexibility of adding your own up to date
packages without having to reinvent the wheel.  There's a reason
Ubuntu is still tracking Debian in a loose sense, rather than
branching off from it wholesale.

Yeah, I think people tend to go for kitchen-sink distros so they only
need to learn the ins and outs of that one.  But if we had a platform
where a majority of the software management utilities (apt) were
standard and it was easier to share packages across distros with
proper dependency management, then people would be more willing to try
out distros focused on their particular application.

Has anyone been able to get all the keys on a multimedia keyboard to produce
scancodes or events?  I have an HP 5187-7583 with five destination keys
(search, HP club, Internet, Info, Email), two eject buttons, a Burn CD/DVD
button, multimedia controls and volume controls.  Three of the destination
keys don't produce a scancode or keycode, neither do the eject or burn
keys.  I've used xev and showkey, and it's as if I'm not pressing a button.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Larry

I read a thread somewhere about this (sorry, it was too long ago for
me to remember exactly).  Some machines have one or more cmos settings
that control multimedia key  behavior.  You might give that a shot.

You may also want to try a couple of Javascript event handlers:

http://unixpapa.com/js/testkey.html
http://sawmac.com/missing/javascript/tutorials/examples/chapter06/events.html

I suspect Tony is right, you will need to fiddle with the BIOS to see
those events show up, but those webpages are another way to look at them.

Myself, I'm looking for something that will log keyboard/mouse events
with timecodes to a file, so I can evaluate various USB devices that
pretend to be keyboards.  Some of these devices emit out long strings
of characters.  Perhaps someone can suggest a tool that would help
both of us, or I should hack on showkey to make what I want.

A little more research shows a lot of chatter about this on the nets.
(keys: multimedia keys dead evdev) It seems to be related to X and the
evdev driver, which started being used for keyboards along and about
Hardy, I think.  Much of the chatter reports the behavior as a bug,
but a lot of the bugs say 'closed', assuming or indicating that newer
releases fixed the problem.  You might check your xorg.conf for the
keyboard entry.  If it says the driver is 'evdev', you might try
changing it to 'kbd', which was one of the simpler suggestions
floating around.

If you have libusb, this will read keycodes or characters from things 
like barcode and magstripe devices.

  http://search.cpan.org/~ewilhelm/Linux-USBKeyboard-0.02/

The newer (0.03) version has some added features, but apparently doesn't 
work on perl's before 5.10.0 right now.

Thanks for the suggestions.  Nothing in BIOS that seemed even distantly
related to the keyboard.  I'm not sure it's X unless it owns the
/dev/console drivers.  Oddly, or maybe not, my xorg.conf doesn't have a
keyboard section.  It's missing a lot, actually, from what I've seen
previously.  I'm using Ubuntu Jaunty.  I suppose I could try a live CD with
not-Ubuntu or do some research into what replaced xorg.conf.  But the
guified keyboard selector has an evdev option as a generic keyboard but it
wasn't selected.

All
Running OpenOffice (2.2.1 on Mandriva 2008 if it makes a difference?)

The sequence of events ...
    Start OpenOffice
    File -> Recent documents -> filename (happens to be an ods document)
    Status message reads "Loading document"
    Progress bar indicates about 50 percent complete and stalls for 
about 3 minutes (give or take a few seconds)
    An OpenOffice 2.2 Error message dialog box appears
    Click OK and the Error message dialog box closes
    The document loads successfully

The contents of the Error message box ...
    An International "No Entry" symbol
    The message "General Internet error has occurred"
    An "OK" button.

The document does have links to other documents on the same machine, but 
nothing to the Internet that I know of

Is there a reason for OpenOffice to be trying to connect to the Internet 
at that point?
How would one stop this type of activity, or should one even try?

Thank you in advance for any help you may be able to offer

I am using rngd on a web server to keep the /dev/urandom entropy pool
up.  This machine does not get any keyboard or mouse action, and it
uses urandom to generate each new sessionid.  Without some source of
entropy, urandom would run dry.

rngd is helping, but even it seems to require some hardware signals to
produce entropy.  Are there PCI cards that can help with this?  What's
a good one?

Some versions/flavors of OOo check the 'net for updates (all of the 
recent MS versions certainly do).  It could be doing that.  Are you on 
the 'net when this happens?

Isn't 2.2 kinda old?

   Last evening we tried to update OO.o-2.4 to the most recent version
available for Xubuntu. The process wouldn't let us start.

   We navigated to the Synaptic Package Manager and tried to update there,
but the list has all the OO.o components individually, not collectively.

   So, I logged in as root and tried 'apt-get upgrade' only to learn that
/var/log/dpkg/<something> directory could not be locked.

   I'm not familiar with Debian or its derivatives so I assume that it's a
user error easily corrected when someone points out what I should do.
Actually, I'd like to upgrade the distribution, too, which should bring OO.o
more current than 2.4.

   As an aside, what prompted this is the apparent inability of 2.4 to
recognize and/or open a presentation I had converted for her from .ppt to
.odp using my copy of OO.o-3.1.1.

I think this means that something else has the /var/log/dpkg/... open. 
If you still have Synaptic open, that will prevent you from using apt-get.

Bruce,

   That was the killer when we tried using synaptic. It was when I saw that
result that I tried apt-get from a virtual console.

   What should I be looking for as a source of this problem?

Thanks,

Rich,

My experience has been that I didn't close Synaptic before I tried to 
use apt-get.  If Synaptic is still open in the GUI and you are trying to 
  use apt-get by ctrl-alt-F1 to the console...that was my best guess.

I don't normally try to answer questions here since I am learning by 
reading this list.  This one seemed obvious.  If you have closed 
Synaptic then I would be using Google from here.  I do wonder if 
something hung in a previous install/upgrade.  Apt-get -f install or 
dpkg --configure -a, run as sudo would help those problems.

Good luck.  I will be watching to see what the fix is when you find it!

Bruce

   The synaptic window was closed. However, even when it was open the same
locked file message was presented.

   I need to learn what those commands do. I'll check with the Xubuntu web
forum.

   The laptop was shut down overnight. I just brought it into my office and
started it. Opening Synaptic I selected the upgradable packages, then told
it to go ahead and upgrade them. No problem with locked files or
directories.

   It's slowly getting the upgraded packages, and I'm sure it will offer to
upgrade the whole distribution when it's finished with the packages. I'll
let it do that, too. Then I'll see what OO.o version is on the system.

   Why it did not want to cooperate last evening will probably forever remain
a mystery. Regardless, it's chomping away at the bits as I write so we're OK
on the issue.

   Thanks, all, for your comments.

Thank you - bingo - what I was looking for, but - sigh - the navigation 
" Choose Tools - Options - OpenOffice.org - Online Update" does not 
exist on this installation.
"Online Update is a module that can be selected or deselected to be 
installed. Choose the customized installation in the Setup of 
OpenOffice.org." may or may point to that issue.
But again ... just the knowledge that "OpenOffice.org will check once a 
day, week, or month, as soon as a working Internet connection is 
detected." goes a long way toward explaining the somewhat erratic 
behavior, and eases my mind somewhat about the document itself.

"kinda old?"  Sure, but it works well.  Upgrade?  I have a 2009 box 
running as well with OOo 3.x on it - haven't used it enough to see any 
advantage as yet.  Actually (no brick bats, please), I think I might be 
more interested in LyX, but that too remains to be seen.

Thanks again

What is currently feeding your /dev/hwrng?  Is the hw_random module 
loaded?  From my reading, rngd is only for bridging hw_random into 
the /dev/random, so you need to already have rng hardware on the 
machine.

/dev/urandom won't ever run dry, though it will become somewhat weaker 
if it has used up all of the entropy.

"The read-only file entropy_avail gives the available entropy. Normally, 
this will be 4096 (bits), a full entropy pool."

  cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail

"Normally" apparently occurs only inside a concrete box.  I think all of 
those ssh sessions are using my entropy... I've only got ~3600 bits.

Does the error message look like this when you run apt-get install anything?

E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily
unavailable)
E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another
process using it?

I would look for /var/lib/dpkg/lock.  If that's present, and you are not
using aptitude or synaptic, it's likely an orphan and can be deleted.

I don't know if I buy the claim that /dev/urandom will never run dry.
It might not block if it does.  But there is only one entropy pool,
which is shared by /dev/urandom and /dev/random.  /dev/random will
block.  This means that using /dev/urandom to excess can cause
blocking indirectly via /dev/random.

If it's true that the network card, disks, and other drivers also
contribute entropy, then I should be OK.  There is certainly plenty of
network and disk activity on the server.

I've seen entropy values in the single digits before installing rngd.
I admit that the numbers increased substantially after installing
rngd.  But they did not increase to what I would call a comfort level.
It is probably safe to assume that there is enough hardware action
going on to keep rngd's head above water.  I'm just trying to make
absolutely sure.  I am looking for a new job, and will be moving far,
far away from this client.  If they should ever experience entropy
issues, they will not have anybody around who will be able to
troubleshoot it.  I want to leave them on solid ground.

So back to my question: any good random number generator cards for
headless servers?

I've posted a few times over the last couple of months in relation to
my MythTV and recording cards experiences, so check out the list
archives.

In short, I'd say it can be a fun to tinker around with all of the
things you can do with a mythbox.  Besides having a nice TV DVR (which
actually skips commercials and is generally pretty smart), you can get
game emulators running, install free games, play karaoke discs with
pykaraoke, of course watch movies and all kinds of other things. 

However, it can also be *a lot of work*.  There are several MythTV
distros out there that might take some of the effort out of it.
Myself, I'm just used to maintaining lots of Debian boxen, so I run a
standard install with packages from http://www.debian-multimedia.org/.
These can be rather unstable though.

I recently upgraded my mythbox to do over-the-air HDTV (ATSC) and it's
been working out nicely.  It does have some bugs, but it's working ok
for us, and over time I slowly squash those things.

Feel free to ping me off list if you have specific questions.

HTH,
tim

i used a mythtv setup for a while with a regular ntsc decoder and it 
worked fine for me.  i hooked it up with galleon (tivo home media server 
for linux) and a fuse interface so that the vidoes could be watched from 
my tivo.  i haven't used it for a while after comcast stopped serving ntsc 
for most channels.  but i'd expect things to be pretty similar for a 
digital decoder card since the data will be mpeg2 still.

Works for me:
- CentOS 5.3
- MythTV 0.21 (RPMs from atrpms.net)
- Custom kernel build (2.6.27.x) for DVB.
- Intel P4, 3.2 GHz, HT
- 3GB RAM
- pcHDTV HD-3000
- ATi Radeon 9600

The HD-3000 may not be under production any longer. The HD-5500 is the
latest offering. My understanding is that is uses the same drivers.

The CPU is just at the edge of being able to handle HD rendering.
Previously this machine had a 2.8 GHz P4 (no hyperthreading) and it
was insufficient. Any modern processor should do fine.

This might be helpful:

Linux collects randomness from interrupt timings, etc.  It
keeps an estimate of how much entropy it has in its pool of randomness,
and when it doesn't feel that it has enough randomness it won't emit
data from /dev/random.  It waits for more interrupts, etc.  Or it pokes
the hardware RNG if you have one.

/dev/urandom acts like /dev/random until the entropy pool
is exhausted, then it reverts to a Mersenne twister or some classical
pseudo-random number generator, which will theoretically 'start over'
in a few thousand years.  Except that more entropy will be available
before then, which would make the period even longer.

Yes, that's the part I was forgetting.  That's how /dev/urandom can
avoid blocking even if there is no more entropy.  But falling back on
a pseudo-random generator is not good enough.  The reason I am using
/dev/urandom is because I have witnessed other generators repeat
themselves.  If someone were to get a sessionid that an administrator
had previously, that could be enough to give elevated privileges in a
webapp.  The seed for the /dev/urandom pseudo-random generator is
saved to a file to survive a reboot.  But what happens if that file
cannot be written to, or the computer crashes suddenly?  You'll get
the same numbers all over again at next reboot.

You mentioned hardware RNGs, but now could you please tell me a good
one to use with linux?  That is what I need.  I like facts and trivia,
and I'll gladly receive more, but please include the name of a
commercially available card.  I changed the subject of this thread to
draw more attention to this urgent need.

Carlos

You said you have witnessed other generators repeat themselves.. but have
you witnessed urandom repeat itself? I'm betting not, and I would bet that
very few people have. The general rule that I've heard in the industry is
that throwaway values

If that is still not good enough for you, are you prepared to spend what it
takes to meet your needs?

Also, I have heard that VIA chipsets have a hardware RNG onboard.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0909281749070.25262@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Last evening we discovered that my wife's laptop running Xubuntu has
OO.o-2.4 installed and cannot open a presentation file. So, while doing
other things today I upgraded her system expecting that OO.o would also be
updated. Apparently not.

   Two questions:

   1) How can I determine which xubuntu version is on the system?

   2) According to the Synaptic Package Manager, OO.0-2.4 is the latest
version. Since I'm running -3.1.1 on my Slackware hosts I know that's not
correct. What is the procedure for finding a more current version of OO.o
and having the system upgrade what's currently there?

TIA,

Rich

   That, I just learned, is in /etc/issue. It tells me that 8.10 is
installed, not 9.04.

Rich,

What's the contents of your /etc/apt/sources.list ??

That's the key file for determining where you get your packages from.
When I upgrade a debian machine, I simply change the distro in that
file, and do something like:

  apt-get update
  apt-get upgrade

(or the equivalent in aptitude)

Of course that will upgrade the entire system, not just OO, but that's
basically what you have to do to get the newer version.

HTH,
tim

Are you confusing "guaranteed to generate a distinct series of numbers from a
limited set" with "random"?  It's starting to smell like you are.

If you want to ensure non-duplicate numbers over a range, deal from a pool
without replacement.  Don't count on a "random number generator" to not deal
the same number twice.

Remember: the sequence "5 5 5 5 5" is a random sequence (one of many :).

And that explains why the latest version of OOo in Synaptic is 2.4. If
you upgrade Xubuntu to Jaunty 9.04 Synaptic will then list 3.01 as the
latest version. In fact, a dist-upgrade will automatically also upgrade
OOo. There is a small catch - you can do a dist-upgrade only one
version at a time, so you'll have to dist-uprade from Hardy 8.04 to
Intrepid 8.10, then from Intrepid 8.10 to Jaunty 9.04. 

Note that the Jaunty repos will still have just OOo 3.01, not 3.10.
Karmic Koala will have 3.10, but that won't be final until sometime in
October. Meantime you can install 3.10 if you download the .deb file
directly from OOo. In fact, you should be able to install it even on
Hardy.

There are some issues regarding the version that you get directly from
OOo and the version in the repos, even when speaking of the same
version. Ubuntu uses the Go version, which is modified from the
official OOo version. I forget what group makes the modifications, but
the Go version is commonly used by various distros instead of the
official OOo version.

One reason for the Go version is that it fixes occasional bugs. But it
also enables/disenables certain features. At one time I was using 3.0
from OOo and I noticed that if a document had not been altered since
the last save, then File > Save would be grayed out. After switching to
the version in the repos I no longer had this feature. Apparently some
people in the Go operation decided that Excel did not do this, and they
wanted OOo to look as much like MS Office as possible, so they disabled
the feature. Go figure. 

At the same time I was once doing an advanced sort in Calc and I asked
a question on the OOo Users list. It turns out that I had the option to
do a "smart" sort where the sort was more like a human would
alphabetize things, and that option was missing in the official OOo
version. So the Go group apparently added a few things at the same time
as they removed stuff. By and large the differences between the
official and the Go versions are pretty trivial.

   Yup. We went from 8.04 to 8.10. Now I'm stuck because on a reboot the wifi
card is no longer turned on. Where do I go to tell the system to get the
card identified and fired up?

Thanks,

Hi:

I am looking for recommendation of hosting a domain plus a java app
that will listen for incoming traffic on a port off this domain.  Linux as
platform
is preferred.

Does anyone has a good recommendation on a Linux hosting solution?

Thanks

Slicehost.com - works for me, I have had 0.0 issues, and thus 0.0
reasons to find out what their support is like, but I hear it is good.

friend works at rackspace, who bought slicehost... so good for them.

I'm not confused; I know the difference.  I'm not sold on
/dev/urandom; it's simply the best thing I have available.  No, I want
true randomness from a dedicated hardware device.  The USB stick looks
good.  Too bad it has to be ordered from Finland.  Seriously, no one
has used a nice, easily obtainable card that can be paid for with US
Dollars?  Never mind then.

That's what I would typically do under Debian.  Perhaps the
dist-upgrade procedure is a better one though...?  I don't know what
it would do differently.

I sell "random numbers",  see http://siidtech.com .  While a
semi-decent hardware RNG can beat the pants off of pure software, 
any random number generator is only as good as the chain of hardware
and software that delivers it to the application, and the wisdom of
the programmers and users that design and operate that chain. 

Hardware RNGs are subject to "side channel attacks", involving crazy
manipulations of power, temperature, clock rates, and system noise,
especially in untrusted environments.  That cute little Araneus RNG
USB dongle is a black box.  Who knows what back doors it might have,
intentional or otherwise.  Or whether the USB dongle that is plugged
into the computer this week is actually the Araneus dongle you bought
(in person) last week, or a counterfeit substituted by the M.I.B. 

The crazy thing is, unless you tear down to the silicon, you have
no way to know whether it has back doors, because there is no way
to differentiate between a real random sequence and a high-entropy
deterministic one.  At best, all you can do is detect the more 
obvious sequences.  A generator that emits the binary digits of
pi is purely deterministic, but mathematical randomness tests will
call it random.  There are an uncountably infinite number of
deterministic transcendental numbers like pi and e, BTW.

In the end, it becomes a question of trust, either in open software
and the people reviewing it for you, or in the skills and sincerity
of hardware designers and manufacturers.  Use your best judgement,
but limit your exposure, and set aside resources to clean up
afterwards if you make the wrong choice.

Yes Carlos, /dev/urandom is the generally accepted way of doing what you are
trying to do. The hardware you're looking for is not readily available
because there is minimal demand for it. However, there are ways to do it. If
you have a sound card in the machine, http://www.av8n.com/turbid/ could
help.

Or you could find a motherboard with an RNG built-in.

   The upgrade from 8.04 to 8.10 on the laptop broke the networking
capability. The laptop connects to the LAN via a wireless card and I cannot
get it recognized and the network started.

   In /etc/networking/interfaces I see that there are three defined
interfaces:

iface eth1 inet dhcp
auto eth1

iface eth2 inet dhcp
auto eth2

   eth1 is supposed to be the wireless one; all three have static information
commented out.

   I tried 'ifconfig eth(n) up' without success. I also tried
'/etc/init.d/networking start' without success. Obviously, I'm missing
something simple here and would very much appreciate a clue stick. I need to
get the network up so I can upgrade the system to 9.04, re-learn how to fix
the networking if it breaks again, and return the machine to my wife so I
can get back to my work.

Thanks,

/sbin/iwconfig eth{$} essid "your ssid" channel auto key $key

dhcpcd $eth{$}

should bring it up but that's the manual ghetto way of doing it.

Man iwconfig will give you all the options you might need.

What wifi card/chip set?  lspci should tell you.

my Atherose (sp) gave me problems like you are having.  i had to
enable hardy-backports or something like that.

dmesg - look for network related lines, post them.

The rt2500/rt2x00 drivers weren't working for a while around that
8.04/8.10 time (fixed with most recent hardy kernels), and I had to
download/build/install the development version. The wireless card in
my laptop is an old Zonet ZEW1501 that I got from ENU.  In any case,
you should be able to connect to the router with  (gasp) an ehternet
cable, do the update, and go back to wireless after that.

Drew,

   That's not what I've used before to restart the networking on that host.
Regardless, iwconfig eth(n) reports 'no such device' so it's something about
the interfaces not being found or networking not running.

   What's frustrating is that I fixed this in the past but I'm completely
blank on just what I did to resolve the issue. With Debian-like systems
isn't it '/etc/init.d/networking start' to bring that up?

Thanks,

Rich

It appears that the upgrade borked seeing the network card. Your syntax is
correct for bringing it up but it's just a wrapper to iwconfig and other
bits I believe, same thing as Slackware's /etc/rc.d/rc.inet stuff. Anyway,
someone mentioned posting lspci and I think that would be the route to go so
we can tell what type of card is in the machine.

if iwconfig says there is nothing there, then the driver isn't 
present/happy/configured.

it sounds like you have a normal ethernet on the box, so why not hard 
wire it and do the final upgrade and see if that gets you anywhere?

   lspci doesn't say, probably because the interface cannot be found.

   The card is a Lucent WaveAccess Gold, and it's worked on this host with
previous versions of xubuntu and slackware.

> dmesg - look for network related lines, post them.

   /etc/init.d/networking start cannot find any interfaces.

   All I see in dmesg is that pccard recognizes a PCMCIA card in slot 0.

tony/Joe:

   Yes, one would think this would work, but it's not playing nicely.

   There's no built-in Ethernet on this Tecra 8000, so I put in a PCMCIA
adapter card and wired that to the router. The link and full duplex lights
on the adapter light up.

   In /etc/network I edited the interfaces file so eth0 has a static IP
address, netmask, and gateway address; only eth0 is listed as 'auto'.
Unfortunately, when I run '/etc/init.d/networking start' that interface
fails to come up. It's not recognized.

   Something in the distribution upgrade really torqued this system. The
wired/static connection ought to be seen and that interface should be
recognized and made visible, but that's not happening. Sigh.

Rich if you don't have success in the next hour or 2 let me know and i can
bring over a USB wireless adapter that I know works .. it should at least
let you finish the upgrade.

it may not be eth0.  run ifconfig -a and see if you can match up the mac 
address to what the card has (should be labelled somewhere).

Joe,

   Could not find a mac address on the card, but ifconfig determined that
it's seen as eth2.

   I edited /etc/network/interfaces, restarted the network, and now have the
system on the network.

   Now to upgrade to 9.04 ...

Thanks, everyone!

   As noted later in this thread, I got the networking going on the ethernet
cable. Now to upgrade the distribution and see if that fixes the wireless
issue.

   Again, thanks to everyone.

well, it doesn't say because it is not plugged into the pci buss.

try lspcmcia but don't be surprised if it dosn't give you anything
useful.  I only recall being disappointed in its output.

but I see you got the wire working - yay.

Let us know!

I was going to suggest getting out the chainsaw, i.e. burning a new 
install disk on another machine, backing up all your data, and starting 
out fresh.  It seems that every second or third time I upgrade Ubuntu it 
torks something and I need to do just that.  On the one hand it's a 
royal pain, but on the other it's like moving into a new house with no 
dust in the corners.

I use it too.  I haven't messed with for a while, so I forgot all the
ids.  I think its mythbuntu about a year old.  I runs XFCE.  I
installed several times, the last after an upgrade that committed
hari-kari.

It runs on a 2.8 xeon server I bought used.  The scsi disk it came
with was too noisy, so I put in a cheap ATA drive with plenty of
space.  I also had to upgrade the video with a cheap nvida card that
has hdmi output.

Getting it going is like a lot of things, takes twice as long as you
expect, even when you double your estimate in the beginning.

Good luck

I've been happy with Linode for virtual hosting--I really like having
complete control over the OS, and not worrying about hardware.  (If
you go that route, I'd like to get you a ref code...)

The cost/power trade-off may not meet your needs though, so make sure
you know your processor / memory requirements if you go with a virtual
machine.  Plans start around $20 / month.

Subject: [PLUG] gdm errors
Message-ID: <20090929195545.GA26785@gate.kl-ic.com>

This morning, the gnome desktop my wife's laptop stopped responding to
left mouseclicks on launchers, left mouseclicks on panel closes, and
other weirdnesses.  Left mouseclicks still worked in the workspace
switcher in the panel.   A crtl-alt-bs restart of X did not help.  A
reboot with an fsck did not help.

In the log file /var/log/gdm/:0.log,  I saw a few messages like:

AUDIT: Tue Sep 29 08:38:04 2009: 3508 Xorg: client 5 rejected from local host
  ( process 3508 is the Xorg server )

After looking for a cause, like a recently updated package or a missing
file, I came up empty.  The only thing different is that she ran Win2K
under VMware yesterday, in order to run a .exe on a cdrom.  Perhaps the
vmware daemon ate a file in some obscure place.

She needed her machine, so I punted.  I used yum to update the gdm RPM
package, then rebooted, and the error seems to have vanished.

I'm not happy with that - what if the error returns?   I have nightly
backups, and can do some forensics, but that is an awful lot of files
to look through.  Any likely culprits I should be looking at?

   Well, so much for the myth that the ubuntus are bullet-proof. After
spending _all_ day downloading 1006 files for the 9.04 upgrade, and
configuring it all, I'm back to square 1: cannot get the wireless card
recognized.

   I changed /etc/network/interfaces so eth0, eth1, and eth2 are all 'auto'
and working with dhcp. The wireless card used to be on eth2, but ifconfig
doesn't show any ethernet interface. There's the irda1 (for use with the TV
remote, I suppose), lo, and pan0 (for cooking?).

   Tomorrow is another day to try to get this working, not tonight.

   I'll also have to resubscribe to the xubuntu mail list because now when
the laptop shuts down it doesn't also automatically power off.

   If anyone here has ideas on regaining either the wireless PCMCIA card
recognition or power off when the system is halted, please share them with
me.

I have both a slicehost account, and a linode account.  I like the
linode one better as the control panel gives a lot more control.  For
upgrading the OS, I could do everything myself including boot to the
new kernel using linode.  With slicehost I had to put in a support
ticket, and wait for them to get it done.  Though they were
responsive, and got it done pretty quick.

Tony,

   The Lucent GOLD worked fine with the 8.04 distribution, broke with the
8.10 distribution, and appears to fight being fixed with the 9.04 version.

   And therein lies the rub. :-) I could get the wired connection up on eth0,
but no longer can return the wireless interface on eth2. Not nice.

Ubuntu is famous for not shutting down completely. The forums are
replete with user complaints. I have been reading posts about it in the
forums since Breezy Badger. Lots of fixes, sometimes they work,
sometimes not. And Jaunty is one of the worst.

Re the wireless card, search the forums on the card and you may find
the answer. The forums are one of the reasons I stick with Ubuntu.

Of course, you need to be online to get to the forums. :(

   We missed the fun, then. Ever since it was put on the ThinkPad, then
transferred to the Tecra it's powered off when shut down. This is a new
experience for us.

   I'll ask on mail list. I prefer mail lists that push information to me
over fora where I have to actively go there and pull down the information.

> Of course, you need to be online to get to the forums. :(

   Which I am. :-) The Tecra is sleeping now.

This post is interesting:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/315489

and offers a somewhat less than friendly, but apparently reproducible, solution.

I and many others have had problems when trying to upgrade Ubuntu. I
think 3-4 different upgrades for me personally have failed with all
kinds of weird different symptoms that proved very hard to track down.
On all of them I finally gave up and wiped the disk clean and did a
fresh install of the then current Ubuntu, and each time it worked
*much* better. Things just worked for the most part where with an
upgrade they were broken in enough places to drive me nuts. I no
longer plan on upgrading the distro, just bugs and security updates.

Tony,

   I'm probably missing the point, but the above seems to reference both an
older kernel than the one provided in the 9.04 distribution and a lack of
working WPA, not recognition of the Orinoco Gold card itself.

   Later this morning I'll power on the laptop and report the kernel version
and firmware version for the referenced file. Perhaps it's the corrupted
size, too.

Thanks,

Rich
