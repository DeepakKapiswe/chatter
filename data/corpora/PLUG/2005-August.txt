I think this could be caused by KDM not knowing where to find xfce
(presumably KDM runs a script to start XFCE, and if that scirpt is
broken, it may return immediately, dropping you back to the login
screen).

Does this happen if you choose other Window managers from kdm?

Rogan,

   Then something working broke yesterday morning. It had been working just
fine for months with xfce-4.2.0. Yesterday morning, when my fiancee was
working away on it, everything shut down. (I assume it was some sort of user
error but I have no way of knowing.)

> Does this happen if you choose other Window managers from kdm?

   I'll test it later today. Before the upgrade to xfce-4.2.1, it cycled me
through the KDM login a second time before starting xfce-4.2.0. After the
upgrade is when the infinite loop appeared. This happened both when the
session was marked as "default" and as "xfce". I'll do more testing as I have
the time.

Thanks,

Rich

Eric,

      I haven't been able to get a speaker for August.
      However, I will be at OSCON on Wednesday and Thursday.
      I'm hoping to grab someone there and have them speak
      at PLUG.  Help would be appreciated.

      Failing this, I will discuss the work I'm currently
      doing with UMN MapServer, R, GRASS, and other GIS software
      at Oregon State University.  However, I have only been
      doing this for a couple months and I'm not ready to
      give a presentation; so I'm hoping to get a speaker 
      from OSCON.

Hi all,

What happened to the vacation utility? It's been a while since I used
it, and now I can't find it anywhere. I've seen some vacation RPMs,
but I'm curious why it's not part of a "standard" distribution. Since
it's been removed, is there a better program to use?

TIA,

Doug

I have an Atheros card using the Madwifi drivers. I have not tried
getting WPA to work.  At some point I need to replace me wifi router
first.  (The current one is a piece of crap.)

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0508011152120.16344-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I'm trying to move to using an IMAP ( dovecot ) from a pine/mbox setup and 
while doing that update/upgrade my procmail rules.

So far no problems with the simplistic settings I was using ( one or two 
triggers and into a folder. )

Now I'd like to place the messages in subfolders.

:0
* Subject:.*CS\ *100.*
.Classes.cs100/

:0
* Subject:.*CS\ *212.*
.Classes.cs212/

:0
* Subject:.*CS\ *228.*
.Classes.cs228/

Created three folders at the $MAILDIR level named .Classes.cs100, 
.Classes.cs212, and .Classes.cs228.  What I'd like is a folder .Classes 
with three subfolders, cs100, cs212, and cs228.

I tried .Classes/.cs212 but get this error message.

procmail: Match on "Subject:.*CS\ *212.*"
procmail: Unable to treat as directory ".Classes/.cs212"
procmail: Assigning "LASTFOLDER=.Classes/.cs212"
procmail: Opening ".Classes/.cs212"
procmail: Error while writing to ".Classes/.cs212"

Is this possible and if so were do I read more on how to do it ... 
correctly?

A good example of why vacation utilities are out of favor arrived in my

Sending vacation notices to mailing lists is considered bad form.

So use one that doesn't do that.  I've used a qmail-ified vacation
program (a perl program) that specifically does not reply if:

     * The sender address includes the string -REQUEST at .
     * The sender is you.
     * The sender's name is any of:
          + daemon
          + postmaster
          + mailer-daemon
          + mailer
          + root
     * The sender matches any of the mail addresses listed in the
       optional files ~/.vacation.aliases and ~/.vacation.noreply. See
       the FILES section below for more details on these files.
     * There is a Precedence: bulk or Precedence: junk header.
     * There is a Mailing-List: header.
     * The email is flagged as SPAM by spamassassin. This will only
       happen if spamassassin is installed on the system receiving the
       email.
     * Your mail address, or any address you have listed in the optional
       ~/.vacation.aliases file does not appear in either the To: or Cc:
       headers. This feature can be disabled using the -j option. See the
       below for more details on this option.
     * An automatic reply has already been sent to the same address
       during the last week. The timeout value may be changed using the
       -t option. See the section below for more details on this option.
     * -n was specified on the command line and the user does not have a
       ~/.vacation.msg file.

I seem to recall in my pre-qmail days that the plain-jane
/usr/bin/vacation program was smart enough not to reply to mailing
list traffic either.

I'll put the question first, and then, if you're inclined to read the 
boring details, they'll follow.

How do I switch the wine user back from root to rsteff?

Here's how I got into trouble:

On the machine I recently upgraded from SuSE 9.1 to Suse 9.3, I was 
fiddling with wine. (I had used wine under 9.1 previously.) By mistake, 
I typed:

wine --help

in a root terminal. wine happily went about changing who gets to run 
wine from my rsteff user to root. It told me the following:

-----------------------
dhcppc1:~ # wine --help
wine: creating configuration directory '/root/.wine'...
Converted windows dir to new entry HKCU\Environment "windir" = 
L"c:\\windows"
wine: '/root/.wine' created successfully.
Wine 20050211
-----------------------

Then, I switched to an ordinary terminal as user=rsteff and tried the 
same command (unfortunately, I don't have enough lines retained in the 
terminal display to get the first handful of what happened):

-----------------------
Created symlink /home/rsteff/.wine/dosdevices/com1 -> /dev/ttyS0
Created symlink /home/rsteff/.wine/dosdevices/com2 -> /dev/ttyS1
Created symlink /home/rsteff/.wine/dosdevices/com3 -> /dev/ttyS2
Created symlink /home/rsteff/.wine/dosdevices/com4 -> /dev/modem
Created symlink /home/rsteff/.wine/dosdevices/lpt1 -> /dev/lp0
Created symlink /home/rsteff/.wine/dosdevices/a: -> /media/floppy
Created symlink /home/rsteff/.wine/dosdevices/c: -> 
../%HOME%/.wine/fake_windows
Created symlink /home/rsteff/.wine/dosdevices/m: -> /media/cdrom
Created symlink /home/rsteff/.wine/dosdevices/x: -> /tmp
Created symlink /home/rsteff/.wine/dosdevices/y: -> ../%HOME%
Created symlink /home/rsteff/.wine/dosdevices/z: -> /
Created symlink /home/rsteff/.wine/dosdevices/a:: -> /dev/fd0
Created symlink /home/rsteff/.wine/dosdevices/m:: -> /dev/sr0

You can now remove the [SerialPorts], [ParallelPorts], and [Drive] sections
in your configuration file, they are replaced by the above symlinks.

Converted drive type to new entry HKLM\Software\Wine\Drives "A:" = L"floppy"
Converted drive type to new entry HKLM\Software\Wine\Drives "C:" = L"hd"
Converted drive type to new entry HKLM\Software\Wine\Drives "M:" = L"cdrom"
Converted drive type to new entry HKLM\Software\Wine\Drives "X:" = L"hd"
Converted drive type to new entry HKLM\Software\Wine\Drives "Y:" = 
L"network"
Converted drive type to new entry HKLM\Software\Wine\Drives "Z:" = 
L"network"
Converted temp dir to new entry HKCU\Environment "TEMP" = 
L"C:\\Windows\\Temp"
Converted path dir to new entry HKCU\Environment "PATH" = 
L"C:\\Windows;C:\\Windows\\System;X:\\;Y:\\"
Converted profile dir to new entry HKCU\Environment "USERPROFILE" = 
L"c:\\windows\\Profiles\\Administrator"
Converted windows dir to new entry HKCU\Environment "windir" = 
L"C:\\Windows"
Converted system dir to new entry HKCU\Environment "winsysdir" = 
L"C:\\Windows\\System"
Warning: the specified Windows directory L"C:\\Windows" is not accessible.
Warning: the specified System directory L"C:\\Windows\\System" is not 
accessible.
Wine 20050211
-----------------------

Then I tried to run the version of notepad found in 
/home/rsteff/.wine/fake_windows/Windows; wine complained as it loaded 
it. The two warnings about directories that are not available (same as 
above) repeated, followed by a request to:

-----------------------
Please use the registry key HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG\Software\Fonts\LogPixels
to set the screen resolution and remove the "Resolution" entry in the 
config file
-----------------------

Notepad loaded, and I was able to type in it, but when I tried to save, 
it complained five times that it couldn't create the directory:

'L"C:\\windows\\profiles\\rsteff\\Desktop"'

and after a bit of fiddling, Killed itself.

I switched back to the root terminal and discovered that it was looking 
for the .wine directory in /home/rsteff, and if I run notepad.exe from 
there, it works and saves just fine.

So, I'm assuming there's a configuration file somewhere that defines 
where "L" points, and that it's now pointing somewhere other than where 
it pointed before. Any ideas where?

TIA

: Sending vacation notices to mailing lists is considered bad form.

Since you never know who-all subscribes, vacation notices sent to mailing 
lists can sometimes be translated to read "Free stuff if you know where my 
house is" in the minds of some subscribers.

Russ,

I'm sorry, I must not have worded my question correctly. Let me
try again:

I'm looking for a auto-responding email utility for my users. The
"vacation" program was once available and now it's not. I'm looking for
an alternative if one is available.

I didn't ask anything about mailing lists, so maybe you've confused my
question with a different thread.

Thanks,

Doug

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0508020750380.30952@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I want to allow one user, on one specific host, to have the shutdown
command run as root when logging out.

   In /etc/sudoers I defined:

Host_Alias  LOCALHOST = localhost
User_Alias  USERS = <username>
Cmnd_Alias  SHUTDOWN = /usr/sbin/shutdown, /usr/sbin/halt
USERS       LOCALHOST = SHUTDOWN

   Where do I place the NOPASSWD: <username> so I can put the command,
sudo /usr/sbin/halt
in ~/.logout and have the system shut down when the user logs out?

Thanks,

Rich

If you can come help out for a while that would be useful.
Also, anyone else you can get to come.

Scott Rainey will be there most of the time, and I will be there
as needed.  But I it would be nice to get some time off.
I'm hoping people will drop by and relieve us from time to time.
If you could help for a couple hours that would be great.

                                          Sincerely,

   I'm stuck.

   I've googled for insight, read the sudo section of Carla's book, read the
man pages for sudo and sudoers, tried what I thought the instructions say and
it still isn't working.

   When I try to run 'sudo halt' at the prompt I'm asked for a password, then
told that the user is not allowed to run sudo on that host.

   Here's the /etc/sudoers file from the laptop:
-------------------------------------------
# sudoers file.
#
# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.
#
# See the sudoers man page for the details on how to write a sudoers file.
#

# Host alias specification
Host_Alias 	LOCALHOST= localhost

# User alias specification
User_Alias 	USERS = pamela

# Cmnd alias specification
Cmnd_Alias 	SHUTDOWN = /usr/sbin/halt

# Defaults specification

# User privilege specification
root	ALL=(ALL) ALL
pamela	localhost= NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown -h now
USERS	LOCALHOST= NOPASSWD: SHUTDOWN

# Uncomment to allow people in group wheel to run all commands
# %wheel	ALL=(ALL)	ALL

# Same thing without a password
# %wheel	ALL=(ALL)	NOPASSWD: ALL

# Samples
# %users  ALL=/sbin/mount /cdrom,/sbin/umount /cdrom
# %users  localhost=/sbin/shutdown -h now
-------------------------------------------------

   In Pamela's ~/.logout I put the line,
sudo /usr/sbin/halt

   Obviously, I've missed something important in /etc/sudoers but I've no idea
what it is. I'd greatly appreciate a clue.

Thanks,

Rich

Greetings Pluggers!!!

I know we're all so overwhelmed, but let's take a break and show our support
for PLUG. OSCON is going to be held THIS Wednesday (August 3) and (August
4th). 

People are needed to cover two hour time lots for the following times:

Wednesday (August 3):
10 - 12
12 - 2
2  - 4:30
6  - 7:30

Thursday (August 4):

feel free to come join us!!!!

Piet van Weel

BTW I will be there opening on Wednesday!!

What does your .logout have in it?  Your sudoers seems fine, but in
your .logout you should have something like: "sudo /sbin/shutdown -h
now" or "sudo /usr/sbin/halt".  You have to specify the explicit path
since you declared it within your sudoers file.

Cmnd_Alias	SHUTDOWN_PAMELA=/sbin/shutdown


pamela		ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: SHUTDOWN_PAMELA


I pretty sure those two lines will give access to the shutdown command
to pamela without password.

We use something similar, in combination with ssh keys, to do some
default admin access settings for newly built Personal Telco Nodes.

David,

   As noted in the original message, I have the full path in her .logout file.

   I'm stymied because it all looks correct to my naive eyes, but there's
obviously something incorrect.

Did you do your edits with visudo?  /etc/sudoers can be

This makes a blind assumption that the next run will be safe to
compress, and that this one isn't... kind of a big oversimplification
that won't always be right.

If for instance this was a monthly archive, all the archives would
always be a month behind, no?  Not to mention that there's the chance
(more likely on shorter-interval rotates), that the file will STILL be
open and being written to by some application... it just puts off the
incorrect behaviour until the next run.

This didn't seem to fit the bill for me, in fact I've never used the
delaycompress option because it doesn't seem to make much sense :)

   Thanks, Aaron. I tried this with the same negative results as before. It's
almost that logout isn't looking at ~/.logout so it doesn't see the command
in there. Strange.

   Just for the heck of it I registered for an exhibit hall pass and planned
to spend a bit of time just seeing who and what was there. I may not be able
to spend two hours there, but I'll stop by and help for a while if needed.

I'd like some direction or pointers on a good enveloping printing
utility for Linux.  I've tried it with OpenOffice but find it lacking
(at least the couple of times I've tried).  I've got an older HP
Laserjet 4 and am simplying trying to print to standard-sized envelopes
(#10).

Robert,

   What problems are you having with OO.o? I use that all the time without any
hassles.

   The one thing I learned several years ago is that if you feed the envelope
on the left side of the drop-down front (the way it is on my LJ 5), you need
to set the orientation to the right-most image in OO.o. Totally counter
intuitive, but it works that way.

/eli,

   Yes, I suffered through visudo. It's supposed to pick up either VISUAL or
EDITOR and use the defined editor, but it doesn't. So I pull out "Linux in a
Nutshell" to refer to the vi commands and stumble my way through it.

   I did go back and replace any spaces between the initial variable and the
following values with a tab.

Thanks,

Rich

So can you confirm that .logout is even working at all as you'd expect.
Can you put something like

/bin/echo "foo" > ~/areyou.there 

and see if it's even executing that file on logout.. 
(/me thinks, permission on .logout?? )

Aaron,

    My, my, my! ~/.logout is not being read or acted upon. Perms are 644, the
same as ~/.bashrc and ~/.bash_profile. Nothing was echoed to the file name.
"Foo" is right!

   So, where should I look to learn why .logout is not being called? Haven't
dived this deep into logout before.

Thanks for the helpful pointer,

Rich

/eli,

   It does parse OK.

   What puzzles me is both why .logout is not being read (and acted upon) and
why that user cannot invoke sudo. There must be a problem with /etc/sudoers
that still remains.

Many thanks,

For starters, you can try 'mv .logout .bash_logout'.  The bash man page
on my system (bash 3.0) does not mention a '.logout', only
'.bash_logout'.

Probably a silly suggestion but is it actually suppose to be .logout 
verses .bash_logout?  What shell is sudo using?

Darn you beat my reply by a few seconds.  I just sent it; then when pine

Wil,

   Sigh. Thanks. I blew that one.

   At least now it's seen, but the 'sudo /sbin/halt' does not work. However,
... 'sudo /sbin/shutdown -h now' _does_ work.

   Many thanks to all of you: /etc/sudoers is now functioning, the logout file
is properly named, and the command is happily accepted. No more worries why
KDM isn't functioning, this works the same way and lets me log in to a
console for maintenance.

That's a bit of an understatement, no? rasmus, wez, zak, andi, 
andrei....This is like saying there are going to be perl "luminaries", 
when the main guest speakers include Wall and Christiansen.

Gotta love OSCON bringing in such interesting folks.

You've really got a program that will keep the log file open for a full
month, and cannot be caused to close() and then re-open() it? If this
really is so, then you'd have to write a program that acts similar to a
pipe. Make a FIFO inode and read from that. Generally SIGHUP causes most
programs to reopen files.

Makes it handy if you want to do post-mortiem examination of them,
knowing they're not going to be touched.

I've always made such files +x, as well... it just makes sense in my
head, although I suppose I don't know if it is required or not.

Two issues at hand here, BTW - sudo not working *and* ~/.logout not
being acted upon.  I would strongly suggest if you haven't solved one of
the problems that you pick one and focus on it until it is solved and
*then* hit the next.........

So, I may hang around downtown until the exhibit hall opens or I may return
to do some work. If I can spend time at the booth I will.

Hi Folks,

I posted this to PLUG-jobs, and someone wrote to suggest that it belonged on
the general list. I hope that's OK.

Wednesday night, I'm running a recruitment party for Sourcelabs at
Kells, and
it strikes me that the folks who need jobs aren't necessarily paying big
bucks to attend the O'Reilly conference this week. Thus, I hope you
don't mind my passing this on. If you bring your resume, I'll buy you
drinks and some food.

Sourcelabs is in Seattle, and is supporting various Open Source "stacks"
for enterprise users who expect some things in a product that the Open
Source projects don't generally provide. The company stays true to the
Open Source ethos. They do not attempt to impose a lock-in model on Open
Source as some vendors have. The same version of software that they
support is available from their web site with no strings attached over
the original Open Source licenses. Thus, we have to maintain excellent
service because customers can go elsewhere.  We announced our Java stack
today, and have had a *AMP stack out for a while.

Date: Wednesday, August 3
Time: 8:30-10:30pm
Place: Kells Irish Restaurant & Pub, Ulster Room, 2nd Floor
112 SW 2nd Ave., Portland, Oregon 97201

                             <tim at consultix-inc.com>

To quote Tim:

I'd be willing to give a talk on the "Minimal Perl" dialect,
which can run from 30 minutes, to 2+ hours in the deluxe version. 8-}

Attendees will be shown how they can leverage their UNIX/Linux skills
to learn basic Perl quickly and easily.

For more details, follow links at
http://oscon.kwiki.org/index.cgi?TimMaher,
or see http://minimalperl.com

The talk I have in mind is based on the 3-hour tutorial I was scheduled
to deliver at YAPC::Toronto and YAPC::Portugal, but I had to withdraw
from both of those due to the last-minute demands of the publishing 
schedule.

Stop by the Powell's Books both from about 12:20 to 1:30 today to find
me at OSCON, or call my cell phone at 206 498-1443, or leave a message at
206-781-8649.

Not really "bringing" since Rasmus had to foot the bill for his own
plane ride. Gotta love Portland for helping make folks like this
available to cash strapped geeks. The event was quite well attended.

For an article including some photos of Rasmus, Drupal's founder Dries,
and some locals like the OSDL's Carl Johnson and Naked Ape founder Wil
Cooley check out the coverage on News4Neighbors Technology section:

N4N will be continuing coverage and announcements throughout the week.
Later today we hope to be broadcasting live from the Exhibit Hall.

Hm.  64MB should be (barely) enough.  I'm running a 32MB RAM + 32MB
swap virtual host for mail and it runs SA with Razor.  Thing goes to
its knees when everything else swaps out for SA, but for $5/mo,
whaddaya 'spect?

I have taken some old hardware to City Recycle over on Killingsworth and they 
have a little store they sell used stuff out of. Not sure of what their 
selection is like since I didn't go in, but it might be worth just giving 
them a call to see if they have anything you are looking for.

Sean,

   I just took down my old Floppyfw box. I _think_ it has a 200MHz Pentium-MMX
in it with a mixed bag of 64M RAM I had lying around. No hard drive. You're
welcome to it (it's a mini-tower) if you want to boost the RAM and add a hard
drive to it.

Sean,

    If you're interested, I have an older Dell, with 800Mhz Pentium3, 52x CD drive, floppy, no Hard drive, no memory, and I think the CMOS battery is dead. Unfortunately, it's a tower (small), but if that would work for you, you're welcome to it.

If by that you mean a shared box where everybody is in a UML... let me
share my experience with such a thing.  :-)

Three friends and I decided to get just that a while back... a beefy box
we'd all share via UMLs.  We got the box, set it up and stuff... and
thought about the shared root situation.  Since we're all decent
sysadmins, it wasn't a big issue, but we did lay down some ground rules
and procedures for things.

As we got setting up the box for various things (we expected the host to
run Apache, Postfix, and BIND for a few things) we started to find less
and less a need for the UMLs.  Now, probably eight months later...
*none* of us have gotten so far as to set up a UML yet.  We're all
happily sharing services with each other.

Has anyone here had experience networking a printer with a Netgear PS101 print server?  I'm trying to get it to print using using CUPS and lpd://ip.address but have had zero luck.  Googling for the answer has left me equally frustrated.  (I am, of course, trying to set this up from a linux machine.)

If anyone has any tips or ideas, I'd appreciate it!  I really can't afford losing more hair!

Thanks.

Can't say I've worked with that particular model, but in general, I've
had good luck with lpd://ip.address/lp or with socket://ip.address:9100.

I'm against Dansguardian.  It's a neat idea, but you can't always go through
a proxy and it has blocked the wrong sites on me many times.  A lot of web 
sites can't be accessed through a proxy at all and proxis are difficult to 
set up.  A more sensible approach for a blacklist is to intercept dns packets
and evaluate the URL in them.  If that URL is on a blacklist, send back a
response that points to a local browser instead.  All one needs to do is 
run a local dns server that supports blacklisting and perhaps dynamic 
updates, then force the local users to use it.  This approach isn't a proxy
solution, it's a dns one.  Not to mention, you could restict what web sites
can be accessed to those on a trusted list.  Apparently there is a supposed
to be a way to implement something like this using netlink and xinetd.
A more elegant solution is a blacklist record much like the A record
in bind.

Subject: [PLUG] passive FTP failing ...
Message-ID: <86ek9a2saf.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


I am running an anonymous ftp server on a public IP.  Recently,
passive-mode FTP transfers are failing.  This seems to include
browsers that seem to do passive mode by default, but I can replicate
the behaviour with /usr/bin/ftp by ensuring passive mode is on.  With
passive mode off, it works just fine.  My iptable rules look like
this:

    /sbin/iptables -A ftp-input -p tcp --syn --dport 21 -j ACCEPT
    /sbin/iptables -A ftp-input -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
    /sbin/iptables -A ftp-input -p tcp --syn -j DROP
    /sbin/iptables -A ftp-input -p udp -j DROP
    /sbin/iptables -A ftp-input -j ACCEPT

It is possible the failure started when I converted from 2.4.x to
2.6.11.x.  I am going to look at the kernel possibility.  Any other
pointers?

Never mind.  I found it.  I had ip-conntrack-ftp compiled as a module
but hadn't loaded it.  I loaded it by hand and plopped it in
/etc/modules and I should be fine now.  Sorry for the bother.

It works fine. I use socket://ip.address:9100

I'm using JetDirect with an HP inkjet printer. You
need to be sure you have the correct driver selected.
Is the light on the server blinking? Anyhow, I've also
used it with FreeBSD.

The Mozilla/Firefox plugin "Adblock" does something similar, except
that it's maintained as a list of regular expressions rather than with
folders/descriptions like bookmarks..

http://adblock.mozdev.org/

I don't know of any plugin or browser feature that maintains a block
list like bookmarks.  If you find one, let us all know.  ;-)

After a while, the windows boxes started to error out when trying to
print to it, so I brought it home, where linux was able to print to it
with no problem.

How much configuration where you able to do?  Were you able to assign an

If you can get mplayer to play the DVD, you can use 
  mplayer -dumpaudio -dumpfile audio.mpg

I think the audio file comes out as mp3, or whatever compressed-audio
format DVDs use.

Hi,

Trying to help a student connect to Comcast via a cable modem:

NETMASK=255.255.248.0
IPADDR=24.20.92.89
GATEWAY=24.20.88.1

It appears the gateway is on a different network. Is that allowed?

Thanks,
Mike

No, but it isn't. That /21 mask has the range 24.20.88.0-24.20.95.255.

It sure is insane though..

That netmask only allows for 6 IP's, including broadcast and
gateway...  it only goes up to .92.94

You won't be able to reach that gateway, thus you don't have a
gateway, since it's outside your network.  Did that get assigned by
Comcast's DHCP?  Looks like your system inherited its settings from
two separate DHCP ack's, like it didn't re-set the GW address when it
got a new lease for a different network.

Yep.

Your concept of "different network" is perhaps too heavily influenced by 
the current custom of using 8-bit netmasks (i.e., 255.255.255.0, 
resulting in "class C" network segments) just about everywhere.

It wasn't always so. It used to be that universities with an entire 
class-B network (e.g., 130.50.0.0/255.255.0.0) used to put the 
255.255.0.0 netmask on *every* machine. Broadcasts were sent to 
potentially thousands of machines. And the default gateway was almost 
certainly on a different "class C" network than your workstation.

The size of a network is pretty arbitrary. It needn't be X.Y.Z.0-255. 
Using netmasking it can range from the entire IPv4 address space (mask 
0.0.0.0) all the way down to a single host (mask 255.255.255.255).

No.. that's a /21 mask which allows for 2K addresses.
.88.0 is the subnet address, and .88.1 is the first IP, and apparently the 
router's IP.

No.. if the netmask is 0.0.0.0 your OS will try to ARP for *everything* and 
if proxy-arp isn't enabled on the router you're using, you won't get to 
anything that isn't in the local subnet, because the entire Internet won't 
hear your ARPs.

No! :-)

That's a *very* broad netmask, allowing addresses from 24.20.88.0 to 
24.20.95.255.

You were probably thinking of a netmask like 255.255.255.248, of the 
sort often handed out by ISPs to customers that don't need a ton of 
publicly routable IP addresses.

   I found what looked like a decent addition to ~/.emacs for working with
python code. However, there is no syntax highlighting, as there is with other

   If you can recommend a source for a working set of .emacs additions to
support python, please let me know.

Ooops, I forgot to engage brain before starting mouth.

Yes, I was working on a subnet mask of 255.255.255.248. It seemed 
improbable that Comcast would use11 bits for the host and have 2046 
possible hosts.

As Rosanna Rosannadanna says "Never mind."

To get that to work, you have to load the iptracking kernel modules for

Thanks for the responses.  The trick was to set the device uri socket://ip.address:9100
I now have a functioning networked printer.

I had to initially configure the print server from a Windows machine, but sometimes it's necessary.

Subject: [PLUG] [OT] Hardware Question
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0508041934550.15219@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Why might a change in motherboard chipsets require the hard drive to be
reformatted? In all the years I've built my own hardware (starting in 1984)
I've not heard this before, and I've moved disks from system to system.

   The context for this question arises from the sudden death of my server's
power supply this afternoon. No warning. I cannot say that it was getting
progressively louder over time, it always seemed loud to me. First time it
was fatally afflicted.

   So, off I drove to ENU to buy a replacement power supply; an Antec 'cause
they're good quality and relatively quite quiet.

   When I put the new drive in the box and turned on the power, the system
told me, "No CPU fan. Should I shut down now? (Y/N)". Of course, I said yes.
Checked all the wires and saw nothing wrong. After going through this a few
times I pulled the box forward and watched: sure enough the fan was spinning
merrily away. After the POST the beeping and message went away.

   I called ENU and was told that the motherboard was obviously not toast, but
something must have been upset when the powersupply went. The fellow on their
end of the conversation asked me which board and chipset I had; they have
another MSI board with a similar chip set, but not the same. He told me it
was important because one "usually has to reformat the hard drive if the chip
sets are different."

   A bunch of you are hardware gurus so I'd like your opinion of both the

I don't claim to be a hardware guru, but the format advice sounds like
voodoo nonsense.  If you really want to clear the HD of wrong doing,
unplug it and try booting without it (with a knoppix CD if necessary).

Have you googled for the error message?

Not a hard drive be reformatted... but if you're running Windows you
generally need to reinstall.  It's a messed up system those Microsoft
users live in.

Russell,

   I don't believe there's anything wrong with the hard drive. Now that the
system has been up and running again for about four hours it seems perfectly
normal to me.

> Have you googled for the error message?

   No. But I will.

   Wow! So if a Microsoft box suddenly goes down the entire OS must be
re-installed? That's crazy!

It's "possible" to not have to do that with Windows.

However, because the drivers for each piece of hardware is installed 
individually, it would be like changing motherboards after optimizing 
your kernel and removing all the excess modules.

It may work, but it definitely won't be optimized without reinstalling a 
bunch of drivers, and even then, you'll have things scattered all over 
the hard drive that aren't needed.

Yeah, it's pretty insane.  I can't understand why anybody would pay 
for that.  Or pay even more for workarounds like Ghost...

I know that "Drinking Liberally" was meeting there tonight, with

To paraphrase a certain jumping monkey:
"licenses!", "licenses!","licenses!"..

If you could swap drives (move old drive to old box, add new to drive 
new box) on two boxes, each with the same OS install, without paying MS 
for *two* installs... well, MS thinks that just ain't right.

Thus, they "key" each install, to the hardware used. Anybody have more 
tech details?

Russell, et al.:

   I think that I have found the reason why the motherboard reports the CPU
fan not running when the system first boots: it's running too slowly to be
detected.

   The new power supply is an Antec "True Power" model that adjusts fan speeds
(power supply, case, cpu) based on temperatures. When the system first boots,
the CPU temperature is sufficiently low that the fan runs slowly. However, it
probably quickly warms and the warning message stops.

   Looking at the smartd records in /var/log/messages show the CPU temperature
between 102-112 C. So I guess everything is working well and I'll save the
money, time, and hassle of replacing a working motherboard with a new one.

I thought smartd only looked at hard drives, is there another smartd
that does CPU stuff?  Also: CPU temp between 102 and 112 C?  You could
make your morning coffee with all that heat!

There was no TF despite the overall testosterone level.

The speaker did run longer than normal and we didn't arrive until 9:30 or so.

There was a high percentage of first timers on a low turnout night.

As I mentioned at the meeting last night, I received an email from
Linux Format magazine in Bath England, asking for an article on
PLUG. (They have a regular feature on LUGs from around the world.)
Hopefully, the folks there will like what I write well enough to
publish it, & we'll get some international attention.

However, they'd also like some photos of our group, & the heat
yesterday made me forget to bring my camera to the meeting last
night. So does anyone have some digitized PLUG-related photos
that Linux Format could use?

NOTE: Please DO NOT email them to me. I have a crappy dialup
connection that chokes on large attachments, & any sent to me
will end up deleted unseen. Instead, put the photos online,
send me the URLs, & I'll take things from there.

And I might also use them for our own website.

Message-ID: <1123275506.32708.6.camel@desktop.igoweb.org>

Hello!

I'm not an active plug member, but I'm in a real tight pinch right now
and I'm hoping somebody on the PLUG mailing list can help me out.

I needed to install Fedora 4 onto a laptop *today* to take on a business
trip *tomorrow*. I downloaded the ISO images over the past week, but
then today when I went to install, I discovered that I had accidentally
downloaded the ia64 images! It took over 2 days before to download, no
way do I have time to re-download.

So my plea is: Does anybody have FC4 CD-ROM images that I can borrow or
buy? Or do you know a store that happens to have these CD-ROMs in stock?

Because this is urgent, please call me at 503-223-2285 or send email to
wms at igoweb.org if you know where I can get some. Thank you!

Subject: [PLUG] Macros in Thunderbird?
Message-ID: <42F40399.2030905@comcast.net>

Is there a feature in Thunderbird that would allow me to create a macro 
that I can apply to specific message? The examples I have in mind are 
s-p-a-m and fraud. I have developed a fairly simple procedure that I 
apply to every message that I identify as s-p-a-m, and another, similar 
procedure to every message I identify as fraud:

Either I, or Thunderbird itself put the offending message in the Junk 
folder.

I determine if it is s-p-a-m or fraud.

If s-p-a-m, I forward it to missed-spam at comcast.net.

If fraud, in addition to missed-spam at comcast.net, I also forward it to 
reportphishing at antiphishing.org and to uce at ftc.gov.

Then, I delete the message from the Junk folder, go to the Trash folder, 
and delete it from there, and then go to the Sent folder and delete the 
associated message from there.

Since the process is always the same, it seems logical that I should be 
able to automate it. Does anyone know if this sort of thing is available 
in Thunderbird, and if so, what it's called?

TIA

They are feeding you a load of crap.  The hard drive should not even be
accessed at the point where you are getting that message.

If there is a problem with ide drives being read differently, it is a
different message.  (Errors of sectors not ending on the correct
boundaries or some such.) 

Sounds like the cpu heat sensors got fried in a power surge.  Replacing
the motherboard is the only fix I know for that.  (Or you can run
without the sensors and hope that the fan fails open and not closed.)

Ah, thanks for the suggestion! I didn't think to call them.

As it happens I found a set at a former workplace, spent 3 hours getting
there, picking them up, and getting them back...only to find that disk 1
failed the checksum.

But free geek came to the rescue, I got another set there, and they
worked great!

They weren't saying it was... they were saying if you get a new
motherboard, you'd likely need to reformat.  This is mostly true for
most of their customers: Windows users.

Yeah, the hard drive wasn't the problem...

Actually, no.  The BIOS spits out quite different errors when the CPU is
overheating (or seeming to overheat).  For years, motherboards have been
able to detect the speed of the fans spinning.  It seems either the CPU
fan was plugged in to a different plug on the motherboard (unlikely
considering Rich wasn't messing with that part of the system) or the fan
speed sensors were messed up.

Alan,

   That's what I assumed.

   When I queried google about the CPU fan not running I found a couple of
hits that were relevant. They mentioned that a variable power supply runs all
fans based on temperature, and that when the system is first booted after
being down for a while, the CPU is relatively cool and its fan is running
slowly. Some board sensors have a fan speed threshold below which they assume
the fan's not running.

   The beeping soon went away and the smart monitor (smartd) happily reports
minor temperature fluctuations of the CPU. The fan was running all that time
so I have to conclude that it was a cold start that triggered the message.

   It's been working just fine for more than 24 hours now.

Thanks,

Rich

If you didn't tell ENU that you were running Linux of some sort, they 
probably assumed it was a Windows system.
And in the case of Windows, sometimes it requires a reinstall, and in 
extreme cases, a reformat to get Windows to run properly with a new 
board/chipset.
This is due to the drivers, and hardware changes. Liken it to this, you 
stripped out all device modules out of your kernel, except the ones you 
have and are currently using. You then do a motherboard upgrade, one 
that has a totaly different chipset vendor.
Linux may, or may not accept the new hardware, based on what kernel 
modules you have enabled.
Albeit, most people just leave all the modules enabled, and are only 
used when loaded.

So, claiming the ENU employee on the other end of the line was full of 
crap, or otherwise trying to mislead you, that is the load of crap here.

Following this thread, just sounds like you got a flaky motherboard.
ENU has a very very good return policy, just pack it up like new, take 
it back, tell them the issue, and get a new board. Unless otherwise a 
BIOS update, or other tweaks fix this issue.

   The motherboard is more than a year old. It's fine. The sensors are fine.
The original (cheap) power supply ran all the fans at one speed: maximum. The
new power supply amuses itself by monitoring system temperatures and
adjusting individual fans to suit conditions. The CPU was cold when first
booted so the fan was run slowly enough to be below the sensory threshold of
the board sensor(s). All's well.

I am used to those sensors being handled by the motherboard.  (The board 
drives the fans, not the power supply.)

True, but the power supply isn't smart enough to feed the motherboard
varying amounts of power depending on feedback from the motherboard.  It
doesn't control the fans plugged in to the motherboard, the motherboard
does.

Now, if Rich's CPU fan plugs in to one of those D-plugs coming out of
the power supply, the power supply could theoretically control its
speed.  However, I've never heard of such technology.  CPU fans have,
IIRC, had the ability to self-throttle themselves for a few years... and
 motherboards could throttle the fans if they wanted to, as well.

Motherboards have been refusing to power up if a spinning fan isn't
plugged in to the CPU fan plug on the motherboard for years.  I fixed an
old KT133-based board a few years back when a BIOS update required the
CPU fan be plugged in to the motherboard rather than directly in to the
power supply via an adapter.

Alan,

   Far be it for me to challenge your greater expertise. I knew nothing about
these until (with Russell's prodding) I searched with google for the error
message. The seemingly relevant hits suggested the message was an artifact
and not a real concern, and that is how I reacted.

   Whether it's the board or variable power supply, it was a new experience to
see that, but it is apparently not a continuing issue.

> That is good.

   We certainly agree on this. :-)

Thanks,

Rich

It's time again. This August 21 (yes, that's two weeks from Sunday), Free
Geek will again be hosting LPI Exams for those who wish to have their
Linux-guruhood certified by an independent organization. There will be
several spaces available for both 101 and 102 exams, so if you haven't
signed up yet, just let me know.

The Linux Professional Institute (lpi.org) is based in Canada and offers
their exams all over the world. They currently have two levels of
certification (Junior Level Administration, Intermediate Level
Administration), and are developing a third. There are two tests for each
level, and you can take any one of those four tests at Free Geek for $40
(significantly less than at "normal" testing centers). Part of your test fee
goes to help support Free Geek's programs. 
Everyone wins!

You can find a schedule of LPI exams at http://freegeek.org/lpi ,
information about the exams themselves and preparing for them at
http://lpi.org/en/lpic.html , and you can contact other local folks about
preparing for these exams at http://lists.freegeek.org/listinfo/lpi-study .
It's all lined up. All you have to do is sign up - and study!

Peace
laurel

Tektronix company store in Beaverton currently (as of this last week)
has a bunch of used PCs at $25 to $35 for a ~400MHz box with 128 to 256
MB RAM and 3-6 GB HD.

Only open first and third Thursdays.  For location see:

I tend to take those errors seriously due to having a few heatsink 
failures.

Subject: [PLUG] Reliable storage on a shoestring
Message-ID: <1123387918.5559.18.camel@luffy>

As I go off to college, I want to build myself a reliable storage system
to backup data from my laptop. It seems like disk-to-disk backups are
the thing to do these days. I have 2 120GB drives and one 250GB drive
and a reasonble box to put them in.

I've done some googling and so I have some ideas how I'm going to set
this up, but I am open to suggestions if anyone has any to give. :-)

I found the Linux Software RAID Howto:

http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-RAID-HOWTO.html

After reading it and looking at my storage requirements, I think I will
use the 2 120's in a RAID 1 and use the 250 as a standalone drive for
that data that I don't care that much about.

This leads to a more specific question: in what way are my drives likely
to fail? Will they throw up a red flag saying "I'm dead, replace me", or
will they be less straightforward about it and start flipping bits in my
data? If the latter is at all likely, I think I need a third disk in the
RAID 1 -- is this true?

Thanks,

Evan

Drives almost always fail two ways: slow decay (more and more unreadable
sectors) or catastrophic (won't do nuthin'.)  Either way, silent data
corruption doesn't happen.

With RAID, unreadable sectors aren't a big problem; the system bitches
about it in the syslog and gets the data from a good drive.  Same deal
with a dead drive.

Modern IDE drives have a thingy called SMART for monitoring drive
health.  You can install SMARTd, which will keep an eye on it.

Aside from defining the problem, let's try to solve it.

I assume you have re-started the computer, have you restarted the modem?

unplug for a minute or two to clear and perhaps it will recieve a

Thanks, Evan. That's what I was looking for. I searched the Mozilla 
site, but didn't think about Google -- duh!

I note, in the comments, that some of the questions refer to things I'll 
need -- and aren't answered there, so this may or may not actually work. 
But, it's a good starting place.

If you use a very current OS (Fedora4 or RHEL/CentOS4), the md
(Software RAID) drivers are configured by default to alert you (via
syslog/logwatch at least, possibly mail to root I forget).  As Aaron
mentioned, use smartd which also comes standard with all modern
distros.

Just as a note, I have seen 'silent' corruption in a couple of cases,
where you don't know your files are toast until things stop working
right, start segfaulting and you MD5 them.  I've seen this during some
filesystem testing and tripped an XFS bug, and also some straight up
3Ware issues.

Not related to drive failure and SW-RAID, though, right?

Subject: [PLUG] Is there a debian installed packages backup script?
Message-ID: <1123438953.8392.13.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hello,

I am not sure if this is worded right, but here goes.  Is there a
utility that reads dpkg's (or apt's?) database to see what has been
installed, and creates a backup script that will install all of those
packages again?  If this does not exist, does it sound like something
that would be useful?  Maybe it could be updated after each install,
removal, or upgrade, or via a cron job after a certain interval.  My
thinking is that if you can just back-up the config files like /etc*
and /home*, and the list of packages, it would be more efficient if you
had to reinstall.

Thanks for any input,
W. Reid Leake

No, just my typical OT ramblings.  

Make sure to use 'quality' cables... avoid any old 40-pin IDE cables,
or those with the cable-perf caps loose, those invariably lead to bad
performance/corruption.

   What does this buy you over restoring from a tape or external hard drive?
I've used a full backup on tape to restore what came off one drive onto a new
hard drive. I think this is what you want to do, correct?

I don't know of a script that does that. But it should be pretty easy.
dpkg can give you a list of packages and what you wanted to do with
them. From dpkg(8):

       To make a local copy of the package selection states:
            dpkg --get-selections >myselections

       You might transfer this file to another computer, and install it
       there with:
            dpkg --set-selections <myselections
       Note that this will not actually install or remove anything, but
       just  set  the  selection  state on the requested packages.  You
       will need  some  other  application  to  actually  download  and
       install  the  requested  packages.  For example, run dselect and
       choose "Install".

       Ordinarily, you will find that dselect(8) provides a more conve-
       nient way to modify the package selection states.

dselect seems to be in disfavor these days. Maybe aptitude or even plain
apt-get will do.

Hope this helps,
Evan

That's very good to hear. It appears that old drives did silent
corruption, but new drives don't. All my drives are relatively new, so I
should be fine there.

Thanks for the tip. I will definitely use that.

I am attracted to RAID 1 because of the simplicity, but RAID 5 would
give me more redundant storage at the expense of some non-redundant
storage. In my situation, with 2x 120GB and 1x 250GB, what do you
recommend?

Also, is it a good idea to boot on SW-RAID? It can be done, but is it
wise?

Thanks again for your help,
Evan

I'm too much of a whippersnapper to know what those mean, but I probably

There are only two tricks to having a bootable SWRAID volume, provided
your distro handles creating and installing on the volumes properly:

1) Set your BIOS to boot from all physical drives in the array,
otherwise if one DOES fail, you won't be able to boot from the
secondary if it's not listed.

2) RH (and some other distros) don't install GRUB to the bootsect of
the drives properly... if your install goes fine, but you can't get
the OS to boot post back here (presuming you have another box ;)

You _could_ use your 250G in a RAID5 array with the two 120's but you
don't want to, firstly RAID5  treats all members of the array as the
smallest member size... you could have a 500G drive and four 100's and
only 100G will be utilized from the 500.  RAID5 will also only grant
you (N-1) * members in capacity, so you'd only get 240G from three
120G drives.

First of all, you cannot boot from software RAID-5, only from a mirror
RAID (RAID-1).
As far as GRUB, any distro which relies on grub-install won't be able
to install GRUB on soft-RAID. I don't think GRUB documentation
mentions how to do it either. But there is a way, you have to get to
the grub prompt and do it manually. Here is how to do it for a RAID-1
built from hda1 and hdb1 (# is shell prompt, grub> is GRUB prompt,
everything else is what GRUB prints out):

# grub
grub> root (hd0,0)
 Filesystem type is ext2fs, partition type 0xfd 
grub> setup (hd0) 
 Checking if "/boot/grub/stage1" exists... yes
 Checking if "/boot/grub/stage2" exists... yes
 Checking if "/boot/grub/e2fs_stage1_5" exists... yes
 Running "embed /boot/grub/e2fs_stage1_5 (hd0)"...  16 sectors are embedded.
succeeded
 Running "install /boot/grub/stage1 (hd0) (hd0)1+16 p
(hd0,0)/boot/grub/stage2 /boot/grub/grub.conf"... succeeded
Done.

grub> root (hd1,0)
 Filesystem type is ext2fs, partition type 0xfd

grub> setup (hd1) 
 Checking if "/boot/grub/stage1" exists... yes
 Checking if "/boot/grub/stage2" exists... yes
 Checking if "/boot/grub/e2fs_stage1_5" exists... yes
 Running "embed /boot/grub/e2fs_stage1_5 (hd1)"...  16 sectors are embedded.
succeeded
 Running "install /boot/grub/stage1 (hd1) (hd1)1+16 p
(hd1,0)/boot/grub/stage2 /boot/grub/grub.conf"... succeeded
Done.

grub> quit

If you look carefully, you're actually booting from either half of the
mirror. Your /etc/grub.conf should reflect this:

default=0
fallback=1
timeout=5
splashimage=(hd0,0)/boot/grub/splash.xpm.gz
hiddenmenu
title Fedora Core (2.6.12-1.1372_FC3)
        root (hd0,0)

        initrd /boot/initrd-2.6.12-1.1372_FC3.img

I realize that RAID 5 uses only the smallest disk size, but I could make
a 120GB parition on the 250GB drive, correct?

The way I see it, I have two options: RAID 1 and RAID 5. RAID 1 gives me
120GB of redundant storage (using the 2 120GB drives) and 250GB of
non-redundant storage on the thrid drive. RAID 5 gives me 240GB of
redundant storage (using the 2 120GB drives and a 120GB parition on the
250GB drive) and 130GB of non-redundant storage. Either way, I have
370GB total.

I will probably choose the RAID 1 option for the simplicity and because
I can boot from it, but I'm interested in hearing arguments for or
against either of these scenarios.

Thanks,
Evan

First, thanks so much for the grub tips! They will be of great help.

>From your example, I gather that in a RAID 1, both drives are also valid
standalone drives. I can pull one disk out, stick it in another box, and
read data off it, even if I don't have any RAID tools installed. Is this
correct?

It buys you a gig or two of backup space and it ensures that your restore 
is the latest and greatest pristine binaries from the Debian archive.

You don't need to keep a backup (or twenty) of the binaries that come in 
your distribution because they're already archived all over the net and 
you're just probably just going to rewrite them with a fresh update as 
soon as possible anyway.  With this approach, you keep local backups of 
local data (/etc, /home, /usr/local) and let the rest of the internet 
worry about backing up the data you just pulled off the internet in the 
first place.

This seems to me very much consistent with The Debian Way -- keep a 
reliable, semi-recent install disc around and restore your system from 
your apt archives and local backups as needed.  The scripts in the package 
archives will show you what changes need to be made to your old 
configuration files to make them compatible with the new versions of the 
packages and you then choose to let the files be automatically modified, 
modify them or not at your own convenience and let the install proceed, or 
abort the installation.

I have a cron job that dumps my dpkg selections to a file in /etc, 
William.  It's VERY trivial and straightforward and contains all the data 
I need to restore a new system.  I just use vi and some carefully 
constructed regex replacements to trim the list down to currently 
installed selections and restore those with something like

$ apt-get update       #  Read my new sources.list and get package data
$ apt-get dist-upgrade     #  Update installed packages from new archives
$ apt-get install `cat /etc/selections`  #  Restore packages from old list

This can be done from a very minimal install of pretty much any version of 
Debian.

Naw.  What if you find out you've been running some h4X0r'd /sbin/init? 
It could be that no backup you have would allow a clean upgrade without 
passing on its poisoned payload.

and /var/www, /var/lib/mysql, /var/mailman and such ilk too.

Michael 'just did such a rebuild' R

Actually I didn't do just that.  The old system, RedHat based, developed 
read errors.  These were reported by smartd. Over the course of a week
I migrated off all the data as Jeme describes, built up a new system, 
injected the local data and was operating.

There were some differences to be resolved in transitioning from RedHat
to Debian based systems but nothing major.  I had more problems with 
juggling around old hardware and turning the project into "lets upgrade
80% of the boxes here."

No recent drive is ever supposed to fail by returning bad data, by recent
I'd say new within the past 10 years or more than say 100MB. Alan's is
not the only report I've seen of a drive giving back bad data when it was
dead though. So modern drives generally fail by failing to give back
data, but very rarely they fail by giving back garbage.

Manufacturers might claim it never happens, but Alan is reasonably sane
so I tend to believe his report, and I have seen other reports of it
happening (rarely, but they are out there if you look).

Recently I thought I had a case of "silent data corruption" on a disk drive.  However, what it really turned out to be was a case of intermittently failing memory.  The apparent result is the same but the cause and treatment are quite different.

Subject: [PLUG] Quiet intermittent beeping on Thinkpad T42
Message-ID: <1123550597.20766.27.camel@luffy>

Hi all,

I come to you today with a very odd problem. My thinkpad is now making
an annoying low-volume sound that is very difficult to describe. I made
a recording:

http://evanheidtmann.info/audio/thinkpad-beeping.ogg

You will have to turn up your speakers a bit. It's a high pitched
beeping sound that is irregular, yet seems to have a pattern.

I can't tell if this sound is new, or whether it's been there all along.
I also can't tell for sure what part of the box it's coming from, but
the recording was made from a speaker. The same noise can be heard in
headphones attached to the laptop. The sound happens in Linux, but not
in the BIOS, GRUB, Windows, or the IBM Rescue & Recovery application.
The sound disappears when any constant CPU activity occurs: playing an
OGG (muted), moving the mouse around, scrolling, or holding down a key
(with autorepeat). It seems unrelated to display activity. The volume
decreases to an almost inaudible level when I reduce the CPU frequency
from 1700Mhz to 600Mhz.

Has anyone seen this before? Any suggestions for how to go about
eliminating it?

Thanks,
Evan

Subject: [PLUG] A cheer for Linux - largefile
Message-ID: <20050809020008.GA29494@patch.com>

At work I'm dealing with Solaris 9 systems.  One of them is running an
application with some performance issues so the vendor asked for a debug
log file.  The first one created was 11G.  No problem, I thought, log
files compress really well.  gzip barfed on the file.  A little research
showed that not all programs in the Solaris world can work with large
files - in fact there's a man page entry that describes what is
"largefile" capable and what is not.  It indicated that compress would
be able to handle the file.  compress barfed.  As did split, perl and
every other utility I tried. They all died about the time the read hit
the 4GB mark.

So I got creative.  Re-ran the process, did a `tail -f logfile | perl
<prg2make_little_files>`  it barfed.  The vendor said to send what I had
and they'd work with that.

Come home tonight and create an 11G file by catting all the logfiles I
have on my system multiple times.  Everything I try on it works.
Increase the file size to 17G everything I've tried so far still works.
This is all on a vanilla install Debian system.

One hears a lot of discussion about Linux having features needed by
enterprise customers.  In the area of support for large files it seems
to be doing quite nicely compared to a "real" Unix.

Sounds somewhat similar to the interference my HP Pavilion has through 
the headphone jack.  As near as I can tell, the hard drive interferes 
with my headphone jack causing a sorta beeping, sorta whining sound that 
is directly related to the hard drive access light.  I guess routing an 
analog signal through a cramped laptop is kinda tricky :-(

If that's it (does it match your HD activity light?) then I dunno if 
there's a way to fix it, if you figure it out let me know!

Unfortunately, it does not match my hard drive activity light. I could
live with that! This noise is constant.

Geoff,

    Thanks for your work.  I haven't gotten back to these people.
In any case, I don't have many photos.  Guess I should take more.
We should have some Lucky Lab photos, but I don't have any.

    In any case, I put the few I have up on my ftp server at

                     ftp DavidMandel.com
                     under /pub/

They are there as a single 40 mb tar file called Pics-for-Geoff.tar
and they are there in a directory called Pics-for-Geoff as well.



                                          Sincerely,

   I have a LinkSys/Cisco WAP54G that is set up for use by one portable host
here. I've not kept up with the latest news on this model, but I'd like to
secure it from outside use.

   Can I set up WPA with authorization on this unit? Is there some
documentation on how to better secure it than with WEP?

Pointers solicited,

Thanks Jeme, that will accomplish most of the functionality I am looking
for.  How do you read the dpkg selections, and what is the trimming
syntax?  I would appreciate it if you could either post the script(s)
here, or for security reasons send it directly to me.  Hopefully that
request is not contrary to mailing list protocol :)

The following one-liner works for me:

   dpkg -l | awk '/^ii/ {print $2}'

You could add something like this to your crontab:

   20 4 * * 0 dpkg -l | awk '/^ii/ {print $2}' > /etc/selections

That would run the selection-dumping "scriptette" every Sunday in the
wee hours of the morning.

You might try the Blastwave/CSW packages (http://www.blastwave.org); I
suspect their packages are built with largefile support.

I've experienced this problem before. Try passing no-hlt to the kernel
parameters. This usually involves editing lilo.conf or grub.conf.

Good luck,

Ouch, that'll prevent your CPU from idling (it'll busy loop)!  Don't
put that sucker on your lap anymore, you'll get burnt!  Not to mention
crappy battery life.

Subject: [PLUG] IPCop and OpenVPN: linux client problems
Message-ID: <20050809215056.75049.qmail@web52613.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello all,

I set up an IPCop machine yesterday and installed the OpenVPN plugin
for it. I can connect Windows and OSX clients to it, but can't figure
out how to set up a Linux client (SuSE 9.2 with openvpn-1.6-2.1
installed via YaST). I can't find a helpful tutorial. Anyway, the IPCop
plugin creates two files:

  test.p12
  test-TO-IPCop.ovpn

The test.p12 seems to be a certificate.
The .ovpn file is the equivelent to openvpn.conf, and consists of the
following:
 #OpenVPN Server conf
 tls-client
 client
 dev tun
 proto udp
 remote 12.34.56.78 1194
 pkcs12 test.p12
 cipher BF-CBC
 comp-lzo
 verb 3

(IP address changed to protect the innocent)

The .ovpn file worked as-is for my Windows client, and worked for my
iBook once I renamed it to openvpn.conf. I renamed it likewas on my
Linux machine.

There was an empty /etc/openvpn directory. I copied openvpn.conf there.
When launching "openvpn --config /etc/openvpn/openvpn.conf" I get
errors in the config file for lines 3 "client" and 7 "pkcs12 test.p12".
I commented out those two lines, and ran again with the following error
message:

 Options error: You must define CA file (--ca)

I point --ca to my test.p12 file, then it complains about needing
--cert. I tried pointing --cert to test.p12, then it complains about
--key, which I also point to test.p12.

Any suggestions?

Hey people,

I need some help here.  My linux box ahs been having some problems with
heat.  My CPU fan was going bad.  I switched fans today, put new conductor
material on the CPU, placed the new fan on.  Initially, I smelled something
like a burning smell and there was no POST sounds.  I redid the fan on the
CPU and I still get no POST sounds.  I've disconnected things and
reconnected, but nothing.

What's going on here?

Thanks,

Jim

I tried that, and it doesn't solve the problem. It behaves just as it
did before.

It's just as well: power usage has gone through the roof.

Jim,

   Are you getting power to the system?

   Is there any sign of life when you press the power button?

   Last week I had a power supply fail. Today, the replacement power supply
failed. So I took that back and exchanged it for another one. Less than an
hour latter, that quit, too. After the unit sat for about 15 minutes it
powered on, but the BIOS monitor shows the temperatures as a bit high. Right
now I have both side panels off and a small floor fan blowing directly into
the case. It's stayed up for 2.5 hours now.

   In my case, I suspect that when the original power supply failed it
weakened the motherboard heat sensors/controllers. I'm having a more
experienced hardware mavin come by tomorrow morning. In the meantime, I'm
back to ENU for a replacement motherboard (an ASUS this time instead of
another MSI). I hope the chipset is supported by lm_sensor so I can build a
userland temperature/fan speed monitor and keep an eye on these.

   If your power supply is good, the CPU may have been terminally injured. Can
you get into the BIOS at all to see what the PC Health screen has to offer?

Thanks Rich.

The CPU fan turns on, the CD-ROM lit up as did the lights on the front of
the box.  I think that power is going into the box.  I hear a click, but not
a beep at the time when I usually hear the POST beep.  THIS box is old, I'm
not sure how old.  I know that I have AMD with an ASUS MB.  I probably can't
even get that CPU anymore.

I can't get into CMOS.

I'm not sure how to test the CPU.  I guess that I could throw the HD into
another old PC and see what happens.

Jim,

   If it's that old, consider a new motherboard/CPU/RAM set. I know that I ran
my PII/333MHz box for about 7 years and it was fine. Until I replaced it with
the Athlon XP+ 2200 I now have. It's worth the upgrade every now and then.

Rich,

Quick question.  I have a slightly newer box running another OS, which I
won't mention, but do you think that I could just take the HD from this

Jim,

   If you put the new hard drive in the other box it should boot without a
problem. The OS, boot loader, and files are on the hard drive. It's only if
you try to run the X Window System that you may find the monitor settings
incompatible. In console mode it should boot and run just fine.

   Well, that's not a Good Thing. I suppose it's appropriate to write that the
old CPU is toast, eh?

   I don't mean to make light of the problem. They're never fun and they take
time away from more important things, such as billable work and marketing.

No problemo, Senor Rich.

The important info has to do with a job search.  I was let go 10 days ago
from a job I've had for 5 years.  I wonder how I can change the monitor
settings.  Heck, I can use the same monitor with the newer box.

Jim,

   For your immediate needs, that is the best solution.

   Good luck with the job search!

   I got off that circus a bit more than 13 years ago when I tired of being
the scapegoat (i.e., newest senior staffer) for bad management decisions. I
knew the only way I'd be happy with management was working for myself. Most
days I consider that to have been a wise decision. :-)

It will boot if you disconnect the drive with the other OS or make this 
your master drive, but you won't be able to boot both OS's without 
tweaking some things on your linux hard drive.  I'm sure one the guru's 
out on this list can help you with that if you decide to go this way.

How would I go about changing monitor settings?  I can't remember since my
linux box hasn't given me any trouble since I build it.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0508091825390.2711@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I've googled for this board model and find mixed reviews: linuxhardware.org
likes it; others find it won't boot linux. Some complain that the nVidia chip
set is difficult to set up because the drivers are proprietary.

   My MSI board (that I think is slightly injured, but nowhere near as bad as
is Jim's system) was a breeze to set up with the VIA KT333 chipset. The Soyo
was also easy, but I still have problems with the console display when I try
to use the trackball, and the trackball is not smooth or easy to control in
X.

   So, if I need a new motherboard, should I stay with the Asus or get another
MSI? The CPU is an Athlon XP+ 2200.

Thanks,

Rich

Jim,

   Depending on the distribution and version of X (i.e., XFree86 or X.org),
there's an Xconfigurator (or xconfigurator) somewhere in the system. Well,
there isn't on my Slackware-10.1 boxes.

   In /etc/X11 you'll find either XF86config (or XF86config4) or xorg.conf.
Your monitor manual will have the refresh frequencies you need. If you no
longer have the manual, google for that brand and model and you'll probably
get the data you need from the web.

   Also, before swapping drives, check your distribution (RH 8, I think you
wrote) for docs on how to configure X. Just to make sure.

I'm not familiar with that particular A7N8X variety, but have used a few
others in the past.  If it's one of the dual-channel-capable
varieties... I'd go for it.  They're very fast with more memory
bandwidth than the CPU knows what to do with.

As far as drivers being proprietary - if you use a recent kernel, it's
all supported out-of-the-box.  ALSA drivers support the sound via the
i8x0 drivers, networking is supported by the ForcedEth driver, and
everything else pretty much just works.  I think there is IDE controller
support specific to the nForce in the kernel these days now, as well.

I've loved all my nForce-based motherboards I've had, including the
A7N8X varieties...

Rob,

   Yes, it is a dual-channel-capable board; up to 800MHz memory bandwidth, if
I recall correctly.

   I will find out, then, if the 2.4.29 kernel is sufficiently recent. :-)

   Thought I had seen words of praise for Asus on this list.

Thanks very much for the feedback,

In the new box boot from Knoppix or other rescue CD.  From there you
can either progress to pulling out the data you need or repairing
the drive issues.

Subject: [PLUG] Using lm_sensors with 2.4.x kernel
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0508100643170.1574@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Anyone here with experience in installing, configuring, and using
lm_sensors?

   I know that my motherboard (VIA KT333 chipset) has temperature, fan speed,
and voltage sensors because the BIOS provides this information in the "PC
Health Status" screen. However, that's not practical for monitoring a
running/working system.

   Enter i2c and lm_sensors.

   When I grep for i2c in /proc/* on my Slackware-10.1 system with the 2.4.29
kernel I learn that it's present in kcore. Therefore, I assume it's been
installed as part of the stock kernel. I found a Slackware package for
lm_sensors-2.9.1 and installed that (since i2c is supposedly already
available). Not finding any man page or docs for lm_sensors, I asked google
for help and it returned a very useful page:
                  <http://xlife.zuavra.net/columns/20020807/>
which I've read and have been trying to implement.

   According to this page, I should be able to run 'sensors-detect' to
configure them. When I try to run this command I learn this:

[root at salmo ~]# sensors-detect
No i2c device files found. Use prog/mkdev/mkdev.sh to create them.

   I cannot discern how to run mkdev/mkdev.sh so it works:

[root at salmo ~]# prog/mkdev/mkdev.sh
-su: prog/mkdev/mkdev.sh: No such file or directory

   Same results if I try just 'mkdev/mkdev.sh'.

   Trying 'sensors -s' results in this:

[root at salmo ~]# sensors -s
Can't access procfs/sysfs file
Unable to find i2c bus information;
For 2.6 kernels, make sure you have mounted sysfs and done
'modprobe i2c_sensor'!
For older kernels, make sure you have done 'modprobe i2c-proc'!
[root at salmo ~]# modprobe i2c-proc
[root at salmo ~]# sensors -s
No sensors found!

   So, I'm stuck, and I'd appreciate some thoughts from those of you who have
successfully installed this userland tool.

TIA,

Rich

Rich,

Try using find looking for 'mkdev.sh'.  I may be hidden elsewhere.  Also 
consider using -iname.

On SysV-ish ( verses BSD-ish ) systems the command is MAKEDEV and the 
script is located in /dev.  Look in the script and you will probably find 
it accepts several commandline switches or arguments.  Look for the 
lm_sensors one.

See above re: commandline switches.


Good luck,

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0508100718540.14964-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I'm looking to do some advanced routing on Linux box.  I've found the 
"Adv-Routing-HOWTO" on The Linux Documentation Project but it is dated 
July of 2002.  Things get old fast on the Internet so does anyone know of 
later docs/pubs/books on, advanced, routing?

FYI, this is for a Linux-Vserver with three NICs: one for the LAN and the 
other two going to two different routers ( ISPs ) to the Internet.  Each 
guest server may access the LAN and one of the WAN interfaces.  ( This is 
not your normal -- well my research says so -- networking issue.  And the 
Linux-Vserver kernel adds a few interesting twists.  :-)


Thanks,
Rod

"Linux Routers: A Primer For Network Administrators" by Tony Mancill

Rod,

   I'm sorry that I forgot to mention that I used find for mkdev.sh and i2c.
No luck on either.

   Aha! There it is. But, it does not know how to make 'makdev.sh'. So, I keep
searching.

Many thanks,

Thanks Paul.  It looks to be of the same time frame as the lpd HOWTO so  
I'll go over that first then look at getting a copy of Tony's book.  Too

I googled and got the following information; and Where is the correct root

ok its possible that ur boot directory has changed
boot linux in rescue mode
i.e bot it from CD & type

linux rescue
at boot prompt after that check in /etc/grub.conf file & check wheather it
points to correct root partition

if u dont know abt where ur root partition is :
then give this command at the cmd-prompt

#fdisk -l

I also saw this: root=LABEL=/
to
root=/dev/hda*

Jim,

   The distribution doesn't matter. Most of the time folks put the / in
/dev/hda1; the first partition of the first hard drive.

   It doesn't help you at this stage, but I found that Red Hat's partition
labels were more of a hassle than a help to me.

   If you put in a Knoppix disk and (re)boot the system it will come up and
let you click on the image of /dev/hda. Then you can confirm that /dev/hda1
is the root partition and you can pass that to grub at boot time from your
hard drive.

   Sorry you're having such a hard time with that system.

Jim,

   I do. I have a copy of Knoppix-3.6 sitting right here.

   I've no idea where you are, but I'm in Troutdale and I'm going to ENU on NE
122nd Ave and to the airport Post Office some time during the lunch hour. If
those are convenient places I can give you a copy.

Oops ... no.  I was looking at "The Linux Documentation Project" pages and
that is 2002.  More embarrassing is I now remember someone pointing me at
this a few months ago when the project first came up. I must of had to
remember some new since then and traded this out.  :-)

Try adjusting the volume in alsamixer.  In gentoo, alsamixer comes
with the alsa-utils ebuild.  If you're not running gentoo, it may be
part of a similarly named package, or may already be installed.  There
are also exist gui-frontend projects for alsa.  Since the problem only
manifests itself in Linux, it may be alsa-related.  I'd start looking
at your alsa configuration.  If you aren't running alsa, then maybe
you should.

If that doesn't work, you did suggest sort of a solution yourself:

Not very elegant, but less cpu-intensive than no-hlt to the kernel. 
I'd suggest you play thinkpad-beeping.ogg on an endless loop, for
sheer irony.

Subject: [PLUG] linux compatible USB Compact Flash reader?
Message-ID: <863bphsccb.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


I have a combo USB CompactFlash/SmartMedia reader that I've been using
for years successfully with Linux, however recently I've tried using
CompactFlash and it isn't working.  I get a /var/log/messages line
that looks like it can't see the media size:

I have seen people complaining about uba, but I see the same thing on
a different box with sda.  On that box I get a message like:

Any clues about either fixing this in software or pointing at a
different USB or maybe even PCMCIA CompactFlash reader hardware device
that works under linux (kernel version 2.6.12+)?

Ah, I got it working.  It was a matter of enabling
CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN.  Also, in order to detect the CF, it required
having some SmartMedia in the device as well as the CF.  Good enough
for now.

Dan,

   Is this the equivalent of Tax Freedom Day? That would make it the day when
finishes paying Microsoft its license fees for the year. So, I can see why it
would take until September 10th.

Rich,

I looked at the startup script.  It tries to load the i2c module, if
the /sys/bus/i2c file exists.  So I loaded the module by:
/sbin/modprobe i2c-dev 

It loaded fine on my Fedora FC3 distribution.  Kernel 2.6.12-1.1372_FC3.

I then ran sensors-detect. This creates the /etc/sysconfig/lm_sensors
file or I should say it configures the file with the necessary modules
to load.

HTH,
Ken of CAD 2 CAM

I have some experience. Mostly trial and error. Wait ... make that 
mostly error. No, wait ... make that just about 100% error.

The main utility you need is gtkpod. This will allow you to transfer 
your mp3s to the iPod. Unfortunately, I found it hopelessly 
unintuitive and there are no help files. Also, be sure to unmount the 
iPod before disconnecting it, as there are reports that failing to do 
so will wipe out the iPod database.

You also need something to create mp3s. The iPod cannot take 
any format but mp3 -- no ogg, flac, wav, etc. Just mp3. As a result, 
if you point gtkod at a file that is not an mp3, the file will not even 
appear in gtkpod's list of files to install on the iPod.

Ripping CDs to mp3s is another problem area. Most say the best 
is Grip, and that may be true. However, I couldn't figure it out. 
There are a bazillion options with little explanation of what they do. 
I finally gave up and found some freeware and shareware rippers to 
put on my Windows box. But they turned out to be so bad that I 
had to give up on that route as well. I recently found that k3b can 
rip CDs, and I did do one CD with it. However, the quality was poor. 
Hopefully there is an option somewhere for greater quality, but I've 
been too busy to go back and try it again.

K3b has another minor problem for me, as I am using Gnome on 
Ubuntu-64, 5.04. It installed, but there is no listing to click on in the 
Applications drop-down list. I have to launch it manually.

I'm a big fan of abcde ("A Better CD Encoder"), a shell script that
reduces the process of a ripping an audio CD to MP3 or Vorbis to a
nearly trivial affair. It's text mode, but that shouldn't scare anyone
away.  Pop a CD in, "abcde", answer a few questions, check over the
album info retrieved from CDDB, and let it rip.

You may find answers to many of your questions on ubuntuguide.org

The defaults settings for grip on my ubuntu install were almost
perfect, and amarok appears to offer an interface to iPods, although I
haven't tried doing that yet (I don't have firewire on that machine).

I did try gtkpod once, and I echo your sentiment about it being a pain
in the a**.  I have heard rumors that iTunes runs in linux under
crossover office, or wine, but I haven't tried to verrify that.

Ken,

   When I grep /proc/* for i2c it's found in kcore. I assume this means that
i2c is built into the kernel rather than being a loadable module.

[root at salmo ~]# sensors-detect
No i2c device files found. Use prog/mkdev/mkdev.sh to create them.

   So, perhaps I need to find and build i2c from scratch. Stay tuned for
details at 11.

I really like abcde as well, I wrote a wrapper around it that checks a
cdrom drive status.  If it finds something there is starts
ripping/encoding automatically.

Works great!!!!!

I have this on a headless box, and it starts on boot.  Pop in a CD and
watch it go....

=================================
#!/bin/sh
CDROM=/proc/ide/hdg

RIP="/usr/bin/abcde -x -b -N"

while true; do
     sleep $DELAY
     CAPACITY=`cat $CDROM/capacity`
     if [ $CAPACITY -gt 0 ]; then
         $RIP
     fi
done

   Guess it's now 11 ... somewhere on the east coast.

   A Google search -- again -- seems to suggest that there are no i2c drivers
for the 2.4.x kernels (except for one Apple PPC chipset). So, I guess I'm out
of luck.

Thanks,

When Novell bought SUSE, I expected them to apply restrictions and be less 
"open."

Wrong!

Before Novell, SUSE did not post current .iso files for their latest 
distribution. Now, Novel has put the .iso files online. Also, they just 
created OpenSUSE with access to betas and bugzilla:

***O'Reilly Connection Launched at OSCON
O'Reilly Connection is a tech-centric jobs and networking site for
developers and those who want to hire them. The service was conceived
and created by Greenplum, a company commercializing the open-source
database PostgreSQL for Business Intelligence.

On O'Reilly Connection, developers build a professional profile that
lays out their skills, and experience, and network in one place. They can
connect with peers and designate "go to" people-other site members whom
they consider experts in a particular technology area-and keep tabs on
those alpha geeks through personalized watch lists.

Employers can quickly search through O'Reilly Connection to find job or
consultant candidates with the specific qualifications they need.
Because profiles on O'Reilly Connection display members' networks, they
provide a richer picture than a standard resume. During the beta period,
O'Reilly Connection is offering free job postings to all members.

***The Practicality of OO PHP 
PHP is an easy language for doing practical things immediately. The
easiest ways to begin aren't always the best ways to stay productive,
though. PHP's support for object orientation requires a little more
learning and a little more discipline, but it has many benefits for
larger projects. David Day explains the basics of OO in PHP 4.

***Porting Test::Builder to Perl 6
With Pugs and Parrot playing nicely and bringing Perl 6 to the rest of

what he learned about Perl 6, Pugs, and his design along the way.

   According to the reply I got from MSI's "tech support", they are unaware of
any OS other than those from Microsoft. I filled out their web form
explaining that I run linux and want to know if they have i2c drivers for the
sensors on their board.

   The reply indicates that they either did not read my message, or they just
did not understand it. They told me to use the Windows-only "PC Alert" and
that they use a "Winbond super IO" to read the sensors.

   While I'm not in a position now to replace the board (and it does work), I
now know to not buy any MSI product for my linux systems. At least I now
know.

In case anyone missed my opinion on MSI under the recent "Linux: ATI or 
nVidia?", I'll repeat it again.  Never buy from MSI.  MSI sucks.

Now, if I could just convince google to return a blank page containing

I would probably be happier had I never heard of MSI.)  Hmm.  Nobody 
seems to have purchased any addwords for MSI... maybe I can get a good

Yup.  Par for the course.  Support techs just about anywhere are
graded by how many calls or emails per hour they handle, and
escalations are often counted against them.  So they get the customer
to go away as quickly as possible without actually hanging up on
them.  You've now experienced a couple of "good" support techs.

I've never had a constructive support session via email.  The person
or script handling support emails just scans for the first technical
term in the message, and replies with whatever canned text is handy
that's vaguely related.  Getting them to actually *read* my email
despite laziness, deadlines and language barrier, generally takes more
time and effort than just calling in and being assertive.

You're gonna have'ta Google for it, and/or read the lm-sensors docs.
Motherboard model number will be helpful, as will chipset info from
lspci.

I use Debian GNU/Linux exclusively at home and it plays nicely with my 
iPod.

I use gtkpod, too, but it has a handful of small issues (not nearly as 
many as iTunes, though -- phew, don't get me started).  Mostly those 
issues have to do with speed and updating lists of files.

The biggest trouble I had was making sure the firewire always worked.  I 
ended up switching to udev which creates a /dev/ipod when and only when my 
iPod is attached to my computer.  It also automounts the thing and gtkpod 
just works at that point.

I've formatted my iPod to vfat because I use it occassionally as a 
portable storage device and vfat is more widely supported than HFS.  I've 
not found a way to reformat it properly and safely except using the 
non-free software from Apple which runs only on OSX and Winders.

I've yet to put Linux on my iPod, but that may be in the future since that 
opens up the recording capabilities and allows playing more diverse file 
formats.

I am trying to rip symphonies, and I find the sound really sucks 
unless I rip at considerably more than 128 kbps. Moreover, the 
default settings on Grip were to ogg, not mp3, and it took a lot of 
figuring out in order to get it to rip to mp3s. Eventually I got it to rip, 
but it still insisted on ripping each track as a separate "song." I 
needed to get it to rip each track as part of one larger file for the 
whole symphony. In addition, I needed to add a couple seconds 
quiet space in between each track. I never figured out how to do 
that or how to get it to make several tracks into one file. I also 
never figured out how to name the file and the tracks so they would 
show up correctly on the iPod. After hours and hours of reading 
about it, perusing the help, scouring the internet, and asking users 
on web pages and blogs, I just gave up on it.

Not sure I really want iTunes on my Linux computer. As for 
Amarok, I just installed it, but there is no way to use it to transfer 
files to an iPod. It seems to be strictly for burning CDs of mp3s 
that have already been ripped.

I just got home after my last final exam (yay!!!) and tried k3b again. 
I am now able to say that whatever it is using for the encoding rate 
(128 kpps?) it is stuck at that and there is no user option to 
change it. Since that quality is too poor, I guess I'll have to 
abandon it.

Thanks for the tip. It was listed in Synaptic, so I installed it.

Then I tried to use it. I typed "abcde" and it started ripping the CD 
that was in the drive. There were no questions beforehand. I 
suppose there are some switches for options, but I didn't know 
what they were. It also did not retrieve any album info from CDDB. 
In the case of the CD in the drive, that wouldn't have resulted in 
anything anyway, as it is not listed in CDDB. I ripped this 
previously with Grip (couldn't get it to rip four of the nine tracks as 
one file), with k3b (lousy quality), and with both I had to type in by 
hand the name of the piece, the artist, and the filename. Not sure if 
abcde is really designed for this sort of ripping task.

Still looking for something to rip my CD collection of symphonies 
and operas to mp3s.

Thanks for the tip. Actually, it was May. :)

Unfortunately, it didn't give me any options I hadn't already tried. It 
did, however, give me a couple links to documentation for gtkpod 
that might be helpful. 

I'm still trying to rip CDs to mp3s correctly and with good quality.

Most board vendors use pretty standard chips to monitor sensor outputs. 
Winbond being one of the most popular.
If lm_sensors has trouble reading the Winbond chip, its probably due to 
lm_sensors code being out of date, than being MSI's problem.

I've used lm_sensors in the past, with some pretty obscure boards, and 
always had success, either by messing with it for hours, or it would 
succesfuly read the output with no hackery.

And expecting some random MSI tech to support Linux is expecting 
Microsoft to volutarily open source their entire product line, total 
pipe dream.

That's perfectly understandable but depends somewhat on your ear.  I know 
people that can't listen to ANY music MP3s at less than 192kbps.  That's 
probably a good minimal starting point for music you care about.  Most of 
the stuff we find on the net these days ripped by those who care about 
sound quality is 320kbps.  Makes for big files, though.  192kbps is fine 
for me and my ear.

Um, that's weird.  I had lame and oggenc both installed and my version of 
grip (from the rarewarez Debian archive, I believe) had good default 
settings when I chose "lame" as my encoder in the "encode" configuration 
tab.

You'll further find that the "Options" tab under the "Encode" settings 
includes the bitrate.  Simple to change right there.

I don't know of anything out there that's going to do what you want. 
Everything I know that rips CDs rips them track by track.  You can, 
however, join the files when you're done.  You can even keep a couple of 
seconds of blank audio in a file and insert that between tracks (there 
may be a more elegant way of doing this, but I've spent no time thinking 
about it).

Quite frankly, however, I'm not sure why you'd do this.  The tracks are 
there to help you navigate the piece.  You lose nothing by keeping them 
except when you use "Shuffle" mode, but nobody does that with symphonic 
music anyway.  If you keep the tracks separate and make sure they have 
appropriate track numbers in their ID3 tags, you can listen to them in 
sequence (with appropriate between-track pauses) whenever you like.

Naming them doesn't do diddly.  You need to modify their ID3 tags.  I use 
a combination of the id3v2 and mp3info utilities.  While the latter 
doesn't support version 2 tags, the former has crappy syntax and can be a 
pain to put into scripts.  Essentially, I use id3v2 for writing tags and 
mp3info for reading them in little shell scripts that I write to 
manipulate these things.

I don't use KDE or any QT apps, but nothing in my reading indicates that 
Amarok is anything but a media player.

Again, grip is probably your tool.  It gives full access to the 
configurations of the backend utilities it calls and has a relatively 
straightforward interface.

Again, why do you want/need this?  You lose navigability for what gain?

If you want to do that, you're going to have to rip the tracks and then 
combine them after the fact.  Going that route, you'll probably do a 
two-(three-)step process wherein you rip raw audio, combine the tracks, 
then encode and tag them.

Agreed.  If each track has an alphabetic naming scheme for both filename
and ID3 tag, they'll play in the right order whether you are using
madplay, xmms or the ipod.  There's no great need to glob 'em into one
file.

"One month! No Clinic for you!"

After some discussion, we've decided not to hold a Linux Clinic this 
month. First off, it conflicts with the annual Adult Soapbox Derby. Why 
should we spend time locked in a room with geeks when we could be out 
watching maniacs risk life and limb - plummeting down the side of a (heh) 
volcano? Oh, did I mention they have a beer garden?

Secondly, we're all pretty burnt out. So, rescheduling for a different day 
wouldn't solve all the problems.

The Clinic will be back in September. Now GO OUT AND ENJOY THE WEATHER!

Burning CDs is only one small feature of Amarok. Its primary purpose
is the organization of audio files, which it does spectacularly well.
It certainly puts iTunes to shame. Take a look at the tabs that should
run down the left side of the application window. The second tab from
the bottom is for accessing your "media device". Apparently the only
media device Amarok supports currently is the iPod. (Nobody's
perfect.)

I've looked and haven't been able to find any CD-ripping feature in
K3B (perhaps there's a newer version available than I have installed).
At any rate, there are better options for ripping.

Uh, not quite.  The iPod is going to sort on track number, not any 
alphabetical sort of the titles.

And DAMN, I wish xmms did the same.

Did you RTFM? "man abcde" presents a fairly readable user's guide.

I'm not sure why it neither queried CDDB nor offered you any options
before ripping. Perhaps your distribution has different defaults than
mine. As far as I can tell, you have to explicitly tell it to not
query CDDB.

Create a ".abcde.conf" file in your home directory and paste in the
following:

   OUTPUTTYPE="mp3"
   
   LAMEOPTS="--vbr-new -B 320"
   
   OUTPUTFORMAT='${ARTISTFILE}/${ALBUMFILE}/${TRACKNUM}-${TRACKFILE}'
   VAOUTPUTFORMAT='Compilations/${ALBUMFILE}/${TRACKNUM}-${ARTISTFILE}-${TRACKFILE}'
   PADTRACKS=y
   
   CDDBLOCALDIR=~/.cddb
   CDDBCOPYLOCAL=y
   CDDBUSELOCAL=y
   EJECTCD=y

That'll have it create VBR-encoded MP3s at 320 kbps (and includes a
few other preferred settings).

I'm unaware of any app that will complete the ripping process with the
end result being one giant file. It's certainly possible to do this
"by hand", though. You'll need a ripper (like "cdparanoia"), and an
encoder (like "lame"), but if you've already installed a shiny GUI app
chances are it relies on these very programs and has already installed
them.

1) Determine how many tracks on are the CD:

   cdparanoia -Q

2) Rip the entire audio CD to one giant file (example assumes a disc
with 10 tracks):

   cdparanoia 1-10

3) Encode to MP3 (320 kbps VBR file):

   lame --vbr-new -B 320 cdda.wav happy_fun_file.mp3

It worked on my box, at least.

The documention for the package gives either the ./configure, make, make
install or the rpmbuild -bb instructions but the non-rpmbuild is the only
one that discusses how to change the from the default /usr/local/etc to
/etc.

It is a pretty abreviated spec file and prefix never shows up in it.  
There is a _configuredir but it is never set anywhere that I can find.

Once again I've had a long day and am short on brain power.

>From Maximum RPM[1]:

"The prefix tag is used when a relocatable package is to be built. A relocatable
package can be installed normally or can be installed in a
user-specified directory, by
using RPM's --prefix install-time option. The data specified after the prefix
tag should be the part of the package's path that may be changed
during installation.
For example, if the following prefix line was included in a spec file:

Prefix: /opt

and the following file was specified in the spec file's %files list:

/opt/blather/foonly

then the file foonly would be installed in /opt/blather if the package was
installed normally. It would be installed in /usr/local/blather if the package
was installed with the --prefix /usr/local option."

So, in summary, try adding a Prefix: /blah to the spec file that
matches the prefix of the files in the %files list, then you should be
able to install the package with rpm -ivh --prefix=/ blah.rpm.

My recommendation on SuSE 10.0 beta 1...

Wait for beta 2.

There is just too much not working or wrong in this release.

It does have a lot of promise.

The good:

It has very nice artwork.

The installer is very cool.  (It has a few places that could be
improved, but it is much better than what they had the last time I
looked.

The bad:

It is SLOW on my laptop.  (AMD64 3700+!)

Metacity does not want to come up.

It keeps wanting to autologin to fvwm first before bringing up gdm.

Various gtk apps crash.

There are no update repositories to be found. (All of the listed ones
error out.)

Finding the configure information is a pain.  Took a while to figure out
where it was hidden.  (The fvwm problem wasted a whole lot of time.)

It does look like it will be cool.  It is going to take some work
though...

You know, man pages are a mystery to me. They don't always 
exist. In this case, I didn't man abcde because it didn't occur to 
me. But see below.

Paul,

Thanks for that additional information. I've got it working now. It's 
not perfect, but I can handle the imperfect parts.

First imperfect part is that lame can't handle spaces in the output 
mp3 file. Not a biggie, I just use Nautilus to rename it before adding 
it to the list in gtkpod. It also doesn't get the CDDB information, but 
I can add that with gtkpod from the disk label. Frankly, when I used 
apps that automatically queried the CDDB database online, half the 
time the data was screwed up anyway.

Another weirditude is that cdparanoia runs the CPU at 800 on my 
computer, but when I encode, lame runs it at 2G. As a result it's 
kinda slow on the ripping. A 40-minute symphony encodes in about 
2 minutes, though.

I do have another question unrelated to the rip/encode process. A 
couple times the iPod has suddenly become unmounted. 
Unplugging it and plugging it back in does not remount it. I tried 
mount /media/iPod, but it just said the device didn't exist. It was 
like the USB port was not working. Except that it was, because I 
use a USB mouse, and it never stopped working. Eventually I shut 
down and restarted the computer. That did it. Afterwards it 
mounted automatically when plugged in, as before. And since the 
iPod was unchanged, the problem must have been in the 
computer, not in the iPod.

Shutting down and restarting is a PITA. Is there a "modprobe 
hotplug system" command that I can use to reset the USB ports 
for the next time this happens?

Thanks for the advice about abcde. You may end up converting me 
to a command-line guy. OK, that may take a while. :)

OK, let me explain what I want to do.

Suppose you just got home from shopping at Classical Millennium, 
as I did the other day. I scored a used copy of Beethoven's 9th, the 
awesome version by Bernstein in Berlin right after the wall came 
down. Bernstein, Jewish, gay, parents holocaust escapees to 
America, conducting in Berlin the most impressive piece of music 
Germany ever produced -- and at the end they changed Ode to Joy 
to Ode to Freedom. It was broadcast live, and at the end people 
were pouring out onto the streets bawling.

Now, the first thing I did was pop this into the stereo and sit back 
to listen to it. Note that I did not wish to play just one track. I 
wanted to listen to the whole thing all at once. I will never want to 
listen to just one track of this CD. Or of any other symphony. So if 
I rip one track at a time, then I have to create a zillion playlists, one 
for each symphonic work. It's much easier to have all the tracks as 
one file. I want my iPod to work just like my stereo -- pop in a CD 
and listen to the whole thing.

But having said that, sometimes I might not want to rip the whole 
CD as one file. Lots of times the publisher will put several works on 
one CD. For example, I am currently ripping a CD that has 
Beethoven's 1st, 7th and Leonore #3 -- nine tracks. If I rip this as 
three files, it will work even better than the stereo, because each 
file will be one complete work.

I finally figured out how to do that with gtkpod. Stupidly simple, 
really. Just click twice on the name and it switches the name to 
edit mode -- just like a file in Nautilus or Windows Explorer. Dunno 
why I was so dense not to figure that out. (I was right-clicking on it, 
which does not list a "rename" option.)

I found something that works better than Grip -- abcde with the

On that we totally agree.

I would guess ripping stuff from the CD isn't CPU-bound, but rather I/O
bound by the CD-ROM drive itself.  In such cases, it wouldn't matter if
your CPU were running at 7.1GHz... it would still rip at the same old speed.

Encoding, on the other hand, is CPU-bound most of the time.... so the
extra CPU horsepower helps speed things up significantly.  :-)

As for spaces in filenames, did you try manually escaping the spaces?

A file named:
Big and Rich - Wild West Show.mp3

Would be typed as:
Big\ and\ Rich\ -\ Wild\ West\ Show.mp3

...note the spaces being escaped with backslashes.

Rob

Now that you point that out, I watched the drive light while it was 
ripping and it was on continuously. While encoding it flickered on 
and off, but was off more than on. So your theory makes sense. 

I'm just happy that I'm finally able to rip and encode the way I want 
to. :)

Good tip! I didn't know that! I tried it and it works! It's also better 
than renaming in flaky Nautilus, because some of the "rename" 
buttons in Nautilus don't work.

Yeah, that's fine.  But just because you don't think right now that you're 
ever going to want to listen to just one track you don't have to give up 
the navigability of the track breaks (which are useful for, say, 
illustrating your point to a friend about the way the strings come in 
during the second movement or what have you).

See, that's where you're mistaken.  You don't have to do that.  That 
really would be absurd.

The same is true for pop albums or whatever.  You don't have to create a 
playlist for each album and you can still listen to the tracks in the 
order the publisher intended.

> It's much easier to have all the tracks as one file.

No easier, just less flexible.

It already does.  If you browse your collection by "album" (which doesn't 
exactly apply in this case, but I'll explain how to make it work that 
way), when you select and play the first track of the album, the rest of 
the album will follow in sequence.

Use your ID3 tags!  Here's how I do my symphonic music using only ID3v1 
tags (since the v2 tags that are most useful for symphonic music are not 
read by the iPod).

Let's say I've got the following directory (and I do):

jbrelin at person:~$ ls /usr/local/public/mp3/ipod/Henryk_Gorecki/Symphony_No_3/
Lento_E_Largo__Tranquillissimo.mp3
Lento__Cantabile__Semplice.mp3
Lento__Sostenuto_Tranquillo_Ma_Cantabile.mp3

Then the tracks in this directory have the following ID3 tags:

Title:   Lento - Sostenuto Tranquillo Ma Cantabile
Artist:  Henryk Gorecki
Album:   Symphony No 3
Track: 1
Year:  1976

Title:   Lento E Largo - Tranquillissimo
Artist:  Henryk Gorecki
Album:   Symphony No 3
Track: 2
Year:  1976

Title:   Lento - Cantabile - Semplice
Artist:  Henryk Gorecki
Album:   Symphony No 3
Track: 3
Year:  1976

Note that the filenames are just the titles of the movements.  Doesn't 
matter that they're not alphabetical or anything.  I don't intend to have 
different versions of this particular work ever (this is the one from 1992 
with Dawn Upshaw doing the aria -- amazing), so I didn't bother with a 
special notation in the album or artist field to distinguish it from 
others.

You, however, might do things a little differently.  You might use the 
ID3V2 Composer tag and the regular Artist tag for conductor, for example. 
Your iPod will only list the conductor in that case unless you modify the 
album title.

I'm more inclined to use a scheme where I list some identifying 
information about the piece in the Album field.  For this one, if I ever 
had to deal with a conflict, I might list it as follows:

Album: Symphony No. 3 - London Sinfonietta - 1992

Then when I chose that album on my iPod and played the first listed track 
(which would be the first in the symphony regardless of how the files are 
named), it will play the whole thing straight through.

Rip the tracks, adjust the tags.  Way less work, more flexibile, lose 
nothing.

I do this and I just keep ONE playlist of all my pop songs (including 
country, rock, whatever -- just modern "songs") and use that for shuffle 
mode when I'm out and about.  I can generate this playlist with a script 
that adds everything that doesn't have the genre tag set to one of the 
following:

32: Classical
101: Speech
102: Chanson
103: Opera
104: Chamber Music
105: Sonata
106: Symphony

Right, in gtkpod, you're not renaming the files, you're editting the ID3 
tags.  I find this is easier to do en mass from the command line with 
id3v2.

Curious to see why you think it works better than grip.  The functionality 
is identical, but grip gives you a better interface for randomly modifying 
track names before the rip.

abcde works great in the way that Sean is using it (on a headless ripping 
machine), but when you're working on a desktop, the interface is not 
particularly flexible.

I tried this and went into the flash screen and edited the parameters to ro
root=/dev/hda1.
I received the following message the Kernel panic: No init found.  Try
passing init= option to kernel.
I then tried editing in this line: kernel /vmlinuz-2.4.18-18.8.0 ro
root=/dev/hda1 init = 3
I get the same message of Kernel panic: No init found.  Try passing init=
option to kernel.

What gives here????

Use fdisk -l to see where your partitions are.  Do you have /boot
mounted on its own partition?  You'll have to mount it:

cd /boot
ls -l

If you see 0 entries listed, try this:

cd /
mount /dev/hda1 /boot   # This assumes /dev/hda1 is your /boot partition
cd /boot
ls -l

You should see files now.

On redhat, /boot/grub/grub.conf should be the location of the file.

>From a grub prompt at bootup time, you can manually type in any commands
that one would find in a grub.conf file.  You can try out various
vmlinuz lines from there, without having to get all the way to a place
where you can edit the grub.conf file.  You can get to the prompt by
typing "c" when yu see the grub menu screen.  Try this out for fun at
the grub prompt:

root (hd0,0) # Use the right numbers, of course.  These point to the first
              # partition on the first drive, a good place to put your
              # /boot partition.  It is the equivalent of /dev/hda1.

configfile /grub/grub.conf # This assumes /boot is its own partition.
                            # If /boot is part of your root filesystem,
                            # use the path /boot/grub/grub.conf instead.

These 2 commands at the grub prompt will manually launch the grub menu.
You can also type in commands like the following to boot "manually":

root (hd0,0)
kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.12-gentoo-r4 root=/dev/hda5 ro lang=en vga=791
boot

This is straight out of my menu.lst file (the debian and gentoo name for
grub.conf).  The grub.conf file's entries get executed as-is when you
choose one at bootup time, as if you typed them yourself at the prompt.
As you can see, my root filesystem is on /dev/hda5, the first extended
partition of the disk.  You alluded to a syntax that lets grub figure
out the root filesystem partition for itself (root=LABEL=/).  I suggest
spelling it out explicitly as I have done here.

Do you need an initrd image?  If it's a stock redhat kernel, I would say
it's a certainty.  I have not used an initrd image for a long time, so I
have no known working example to offer you.  But it's not too hard; it
looks like the "kernel" line, except with no params.  Here's a googled
one:

initrd /initrd-2.4.18-0.12.img

You would put this somewhere between the "root" line and the "boot" line.
Again, you can see that "/boot" is not part of the path.  This is
because /boot is its own partition on this machine.  If /boot were part
of the root filesystem, all the paths in grub.conf would have "/boot"
prepended.

With a stock redhat kernel, your kernel will be unable to read your hard
drive without the assistance of the modules in that initrd image.  I'd
bet that is your problem.  No ATA support, no workie.  Add an initrd
line to your grub commands in grub.conf, or type the lines in manually
from the grub prompt.

You can put the filename in quotes and the spaces will be interpreted 
literally as part of one string.  Also, you can escape the quotes as 
follows:

filename\ with\ spaces.mp3

That should be equivalent to "filename with spaces.mp3" to your shell.

If you use grip, you can hit the little pencil button and then edit the 
CDDB information that it queried.  Furthermore, you can resubmit your 
changes so that the rest of us get proper information next time.  It's a 
simple way to give something back.

It depends on how much "paranoia" cdparanoia is using.  There are 
command-line options to modify how this is done.  In grip, there are check 
boxes to disable various levels of paranoia to speed up the process. 
(Disabling paranoia can make the rip less fault tolerant, of course.)

You're doing this via USB?  Weird.  Is it USB 2.0?  I use firewire.

You need the rescan-scsi-bus.sh script.

When it gets flakey, you have to rescan the bus and verify the devices. 
Obviously, rebooting the machine will rescan the bus.

Heh.  I should read the whole thing before replying to pieces.

You'll certainly find that using the command-line is easier for bulk 
renaming and modifying ID3 tags in your MP3s.  But these are processes you 
want to automate for the most part, so scripting makes sense.  For 
ripping, I don't see the advantage (and I'm a VERY command-line kind of 
guy).

Uh, huh?  The cdrom light was on when you were encoding and NOT ripping?

The CDROM drive shouldn't be accessed at all when you're just encoding (no 
lights).  If you're ripping, the light should be more or less constantly 
engaged... even if you're encoding simultaneously.

Quotes use fewer keystrokes and are less likely to cause weird errors 
(like when you forget to escape one of your spaces and it's read as two 
arguments).  It also does wonders for readability.

Consider the following:

id3v2 -t "The Space Between Us (Turns Into Animals)" "Robyn Hitchock & 
The Egyptians - The Space Between Us (Turns Into Animals).mp3"

versus

id3v2 -t The\ Space\ Between\ Us\ \(Turns\ Into Animals\) Robyn\ Hitchock\ 
\&\ The\ Egyptians\ -\ The\ Space\ Between\ Us\ \(Turns\ Into\ 
Animals\).mp3

Which is more readable?  Which is easier to read and distinguish when one 
argument ends and another begins?

Did you notice there's an error in the second one and there is no escape 
on the space before the word "Animals" in the title tag?  I didn't until 
just now.

Ugly.

Personally, I use underscores instead of spaces anyway because I write 
lots of shell scripts and don't want to have to worry about quoting my 
variables all the time.  I also keep directories by artist and album 
subdirectories, then store track information in the ID3 tags.  As a 
result, the above file would be here (for instance):

/usr/local/mp3/ipod/Robyn_Hitchcock_And_The_Egyptians/Globe_Of_Frogs/The_Shapes_Between_Us_Turn_Into_Animals.mp3

When I cd /boot I get no such file or directory.
My fdisk -l lists:

I tried this and got mount: Mounting /dev/hda/1 on /boot failed: No such

Does RH have /boot directory??????  I have typed find boot with the message

The redhat 8 installer program puts you into a GUI fdisk utility.  You
set up the partitions yourself.  There may be an "automatic" option, and
I have no idea what that does exactly.  Judging by the mess of
partitions you have, I'd say you chose this option at install time.

Your fdisk output below does not give Start, End and Blocks for all
entries.  This would be crucial info in deciding which partition is
/boot.  /boot will be a very small partition, usually no more than 100
megabytes.  It will be type 83 (Linux), not 82 (Linux Swap) or f
(Win95).

Why is /dev/hda3 listed twice?  Is something screwy with your hard drive
or MBR?

Since dev/hda1 is marked as the active partition, one would think that
is the /boot partition.  Try mounting it again, and see to it that you
have no typos this time (you typed /dev/hda/1 last time instead of
/dev/hda1).

Carlos,

When i type the config file I get the Grub screen.  It has showing:
root (hd0,0)
kernel /vmlinuz-2.4.18-18.8.0 ro root=LABEL=/ hda =ide-scsi
initrd /initrd-2.4.18-18.8.0.img

I've gone into the edit feature and changed root=/dev/hda1
and then put init =3 and got the stuff at the bottom of this message.

I'm not sure what to do at this point.

Thanks for your help.

Jim

This looks plain broken:

kernel /vmlinuz-2.4.18-18.8.0 ro root=LABEL=/ hda =ide-scsi

The "root=LABEL=/", "hda" and "=ide-scsi" are broken by whitespace that
would appear to render this line syntactically incorrect.

Try this instead:

kernel /vmlinuz-2.4.18-18.8.0 ro root=/dev/hda5

This assumes your root filesystem is on /dev/hda5.

Once you get this to work, you can add back in the scsi support for your
CDROM.  You need to find out which device your CDROM is, of course.
Try either dmesg|less or:

eject /dev/hdb
eject /dev/hdc
eject /dev/hdd

See which one opens your CDROM tray (not sure if eject will work without
scsi support - you may have to read the dmesg output instead).  Once you
find it, modify the kernel line to look like this:

kernel /vmlinuz-2.4.18-18.8.0 ro root=/dev/hda5 /dev/hdc=ide-scsi

This assumes your CDROM is /dev/hdc (which will be the case if it's the
master device on the second IDE cable).

I set it up myself maybe 6 years ago with the number of partitions and size.
with the autmatic part.

I think that /dev/hda1 is the boot.
I filled in all of the entries below

My fdisk -l lists:
Device       Boot   Start      End          Blocks            ID   System
/dev/hda1    *        1         13           104391           83   Linux
/dev/hda2             14       1615        12868065           83   Linux
/dev/hda3           1616       2201         4707045           83   Linux
/dev/hda4           2202       2491         2329425           f    Win95
Ext'd (LBA)
/dev/hda5           2202       2266          522081           83   Linux
/dev/hda6           2267       2396         1044193           83   Linux
/dev/hda7           2397       2491          763056           82 Linux swap

only one /dev/hda3 listed in fdisk -l

Carlos,

Edited root=/dev/hda* using 1-7 since that is what fdisk -l shows as dev.  I
get the following on all of them:

Mounting root filesystem
attempt to access beyond end of device
03:04: rw=0, want=2, limit=1
EXT3-fs: unable to read superblock
mount: error 22 mounting ext3
pivotroot: pivot_root(/sysroot,/sysroot/initrd) failed: 2
umount /initrd/proc failed: 2
Freeing unused kernel memory: 172k freed
Kernel panic: No init found.  Try passing init= option to kernel.

Carlos,

I retired the grub edit and used hda/5, I think and it booted up.  It said
something about swap not initialed and I think that it did that.  It's
working.

What do you recommend at this point??????

Jim

Like Jeme, I don't think it's the best approach, but mp3splt and
mp3wrap are what you're looking for.  You can bundle multiple MP3s
into one playable file with mp3wrap, and if you change your mind,
split them back apart with mp3splt, all without re-encoding or
suchlike.

Sorry, you are right. I stated that backwards. :(

It's not that big a deal. I've been ripping/encoding my collection in 
order. There were 12 CDs for Beethoven. So once I named a file 
Beethoven - Symphony #1.mp3, the next symphony will be #2, so I 
just up-arrow and change the 1 to a 2. I've been doing it for several 
hours today and haven't made an error yet. And if I do, I can always 
rename the file in Nautilus.

Note that I'm doing all the ID3 tag editing in gtkpod, which is 
copy/paste capable. Many of my CDs are by the same conductor 
and orchestra, so I can just paste them in. And gtkpod has no 
problem with spaces -- that problem was only in lame.

As for giving back to CDDB, the tags I want may not be what 
everyone else wants. For example, the Beethoven 9th by Bernstein 
in Berlin that I mentioned earlier today, is labeled in CDDB as 
album Ode to Freedom, artist Bernstein in Berlin, title Symphony 
No. 9. I didn't want Ode to Freedom to be the album name because 
that's actually the title of the fourth movement. And I am 
standardizing by using # instead of No. for the symphony number. 
You'll just have to color me weird, but it's my iPod and I want the 
tags to be what I want them to be, not what the fine folks at 
Deutsche Grammophon decided I'd want. At the same time, I doubt 
anyone would want me overwriting the database with my ideas of 
how the tags should read. So I'll just do it my way.

My iPod came with a USB cable. A firewire cable is an optional 
item I'd have to buy from Apple. And yes, it is 2.0. Apple literature 
says it requires 2.0. But when reformatting it to FAT32 I plugged it 
into a 1.1 port on my Windows 2000 desktop and it worked just 
fine. In any event, I'm doing all the ripping/encoding and stuff on the 
new Compaq laptop with USB 2.0.

OK. Do I assume correctly that my 64-bit Ubuntu 5.04 comes with 
this script, so if I just type rescan-scsi-bus from a command line it 
will do its thing? It hasn't gotten unmounted lately, but I'd like to be 
ready if it happens again.

this is a collosal waste of time.

Given your naming convention, you can do this all at once from the command 
line.

id3v2 -a "Ludwig van Beethoven" ./Beethoven*mp3

So all your artist fields are done.

If you're really into having filenames match ID3 tags, then you can just 
write a little script that parses the filename and fills in the tags.  I 
do that all the time with files I've downloaded that have informative 
filenames, but no ID3 tags.

This will save you HOURS of time.  I ripped two-hundred discs each day 
when I first bought my iPod.  Over that one long weekend (of thankfully 
miserable weather), I got the entire collection stored away and properly 
cataloged.

Type as little as possible.  Your wrists will thank you.  And mousing is 
even worse than typing.

> And I am standardizing by using # instead of No. for the symphony 
> number.

That's fine for the ID3 tags, but I'd recommend against using that for the 
filenames -- just one more thing you have to escape as the octothorp (#) 
is the sign you use to tell the shell to stop reading that line (good for 
adding comments and stuff).

Of course.  There are issues like that all over my collection.  But when 
there are spelling errors or the like, I think we all owe it to freedb to 
submit corrections.

It's not an automated process.

Ah.  I bought my iPod in March when they still had them in stock from 
before the "price reduction" (wherein they dropped the retail price fifty 
bucks and took eighty dollars worth of accessories out of the box).

Hence, mine came with a dock, two cables, and a power adapter.

Yeah, any USB will do.  It's just unpleasantly slow transfering files on 
old USB.  I've done it, too.

Nope.  You can find it on the net.  The fellow who wrote has a suse.de 
address.

Subject: [PLUG] Trouble with bootup of RH 8 box
Message-ID: <NAEMLOHDCGGNKGMHCPFGKEDCCDAA.jimwebb@charter.net>

I'm able to bootup my RH 8 box by editing the grub screen and change
root=LABEL=/ to kernel /vmlinuz-2.4.18-18.8.0 ro root=/dev/hda5.  I have to
edit this everytime in order to bootup.  This allows my box to bootup, but I
notice that when it gets to activating the swap partition in the interactive
startup, I get the following message: swapon: /dev/hda7: no such device or
adress.

Then it activates the swap partition.  What can I do to fix this swap
partition activation as well fix the GRUB so that it will boot up without
editing at the beginning? When I use vi to edit the grub.conf file I see a
different entry for every kernel version that is on the box.  They all say
the following:

title RH Linux (kernel version number)
    root (hdo,0)
    kernel /vmlinuz-2.4.xx-xx.x ro root=LABEL=/ hda=ide-scsi
    initrd /initrd-2.4.xx-xx.x.img

x is the specific number of the kernel version.  Earlier in the file in the
commented portion I see the following:

#    root (hd0,0)
#    kernel /vmlinuz-version ro root=/dev/hde5
#    initrd /intrd-version.img
#boot=/dev/hde

Could the fact that it's mentioning hde be the problem???  But it's
commented out.
The problem with the swap partition will not allow me to upgrade .  Someone
mentioned in a forum that upgrading fixed the grub problem for them.

Jim,

In rescue mode, the distribution is mount on /sysimage/.  So your
grub.conf file is located at /sysimage/boot/grub/grub.conf.

There should have been a message about using chroot to move to
the /sysimage file system.  

The fstab file would be located in /sysimage/etc/fstab.

But, if you chroot /sysimage, then everything is located in their
"proper" places.

When my RH 8 box is booting up, I've noticed that during the interactive
startup, my box fails activating the swap partition.  I receive the
following message: swapon: /dev/hda7: no such device or address.  

/dev/hda7 is what is designated as my swap partition.  Then it activates
it a little later.

Why is this happening and can it be fixed?

Thanks,

I've been ripping and encoding while I do other things for the past 
couple days. Today I had occasion to use mp3wrap for the first 
time. The problem was that the idiots who made the CDs (a 2-CD 
set) put the first three tracks of a piece on CD-1 and the final track 
of the piece on CD-2. Kinda lame, huh?

So I ripped/encoded the first three as Serenade1.mp3 and the final 
track as Serenade2.mp3. Then I used mp3wrap to wrap them 
together as Serenade.mp3. The resulting file came out as 
Serenade_MP3WRAP.mp3. The man page warned against 
removing the MP3WRAP from the filename, so I left it in there. 

But when I tried to place it into the file list in gtkpod it appeared 
that nothing happened. I tried it a second time and this time got an 
error that the file was already listed in gtkpod. So I scrolled through 
and found the file. It seems that gtkpod had taken the filename as 
http://mp3split.sourceforge.net, believe it or not.

Thinking I could fool gtkpod, I deleted it from the list in gtkpod, then 
changed the filename on my computer to Serenade.mp3, deleting 
the MP3WRAP. But no luck. Evidently gtkpod is smarter than me, 
as it still took the filename as the URL. I guess it must look inside 
the file somehow before adding it to the list of files to sync to the 
iPod.

When I click on the URL in gtkpod it shows the Title as "Use 
Mp3split to obtain original tracks" and under Artist it says "File 
wrapped with Mp3wrap."

For further amusement, I decided to try to play it. I started by 
double-clicking on it in Nautilus. Totem is the default, so Totem 
popped up, but then immediately disappeared from the screen. (I've 
never gotten Totem to do any more than that, no matter what I've 
tried to get it to play.) Then I tried xmms. It came up, but did not 
automatically start playing the file. I clicked on the Play button, but 
it still did not play. Worse, it seemed to be locked up. I tried to 
close it, but eventually had to use Kill Process to get rid of it. I also 
tried noatun, but it acted like Totem. Music Player opened, but 
refused to play the file. At least it didn't lock up or immediately 
disappear.

I also tried just copying the tracks onto my hard disk and then 
ripping them all as one file, but the directories on the CDs are 
screwed up. I get fragments of the filenames in what appears to be 
several files.

I guess it was not my destiny to have this piece on my iPod. :(

And no, I do not want to rip/encode as single tracks and then list 
them under Album. I've tried that and I don't care for the results.

But if anyone has any other suggestions besides Mp3wrap, I'd like 
to hear them.

Could you also do an fdisk -l /dev/hda?  This will tell what partition
type your partitions on hda are.

If your swap partition is hda7 (as you mentioned in your email
earlier) then you need to change this line in /etc/fstab to reflect
that (instead of hd*E*7).

Hope that helps,
Jason

I've been ripping and encoding while I do other things for the past 
couple days. Today I had occasion to use mp3wrap for the first 
time. The problem was that the idiots who made the CDs (a 2-CD 
set) put the first three tracks of a piece on CD-1 and the final track 
of the piece on CD-2. Kinda lame, huh? 

So I ripped/encoded the first three as Serenade1.mp3 and the final 
track as Serenade2.mp3. Then I used mp3wrap to wrap them 
together as Serenade.mp3. The resulting file came out as 
Serenade_MP3WRAP.mp3. The man page warned against 
removing the MP3WRAP from the filename, so I left it in there. 

But when I tried to place it into the file list in gtkpod it appeared 
that nothing happened. I tried it a second time and this time got an 
error that the file was already listed in gtkpod. So I scrolled through 
and found the file. It seems that gtkpod had taken the filename as 
http://mp3split.sourceforge.net, believe it or not. 

Thinking I could fool gtkpod, I deleted it from the list in gtkpod, then 
changed the filename on my computer to Serenade.mp3, deleting 
the MP3WRAP. But no luck. Evidently gtkpod is smarter than me, 
as it still took the filename as the URL. I guess it must look inside 
the file somehow before adding it to the list of files to sync to the 
iPod. 


When I click on the URL in gtkpod it shows the Title as "Use 
Mp3split to obtain original tracks" and under Artist it says "File 
wrapped with Mp3wrap." 


For further amusement, I decided to try to play it. I started by 
double-clicking on it in Nautilus. Totem is the default, so Totem 
popped up, but then immediately disappeared from the screen. (I've 
never gotten Totem to do any more than that, no matter what I've 
tried to get it to play.) Then I tried xmms. It came up, but did not 
automatically start playing the file. I clicked on the Play button, but 
it still did not play. Worse, it seemed to be locked up. I tried to 
close it, but eventually had to use Kill Process to get rid of it. I also 
tried noatun, but it acted like Totem. Music Player opened, but 
refused to play the file. At least it didn't lock up or immediately 
disappear. 


I also tried just copying the tracks onto my hard disk and then 
ripping them all as one file, but the directories on the CDs are 
screwed up. I get fragments of the filenames in what appears to be 
several files. 


I guess it was not my destiny to have this piece on my iPod. :( 


And no, I do not want to rip/encode as single tracks and then list 
them under Album. I've tried that and I don't care for the results. 


But if anyone has any other suggestions besides Mp3wrap, I'd like 
to hear them.

OK, you clearly don't understand the concept of an ID3 tag and that could 
be why you're confused about this whole thing.

Part of the MP3 file format is a block of data where "metadata" (or 
"information about the information") is stored.  This metadata has a 
particular format that allows you to embed titles, artists, track names, 
and much more into the data itself.  So it doesn't matter what you NAME 
the file in your filesystem, the file "knows" its "real name".

gtkpod and most other MP3 playing applications read this metadata and 
ignore the filename you've assigned.

One of the fields in this metadata tag is "Track".  This is used to preset 
the order in which the MP3s that share the same "Album" field are ordered 
and played in most MP3 playing systems.  (XMMS doesn't do this by default, 
oddly, but its the only player I use that doesn't.  If anybody knows how 
to make it do it, please share.  Annoying as hell.)

Did you try ripping them as raw PCM audio and then joining those tracks 
and encoding them as a single MP3?  That was my first suggestion to you 
when you insisted on having one big file.  It will most certainly work, 
though you might have to manually insert the desired amount of space 
between tracks if the tracks end abruptly and are not padded.

Exactly what about "the result" do you not "care for"?

More to the point, what behavior do you get that you don't want?  What 
behavior do you want that you don 't get?

I'm SUPER curious about the above, becuase my iPod plays multiple 
symphonic tracks EXACTLY like my CD player plays them and I can't imagine 
being happy with one and not the other.

I've already suggested ripping the audio and concatenating those files, 
then encoding and tagging them.  You lose the titles of the movements and 
the ability to easily navigate through them, but you get one big file of 
the whole piece.

cdparanoia by default rips to a single file. You have to explicitly
pass it the "batch" option to get a separate file for each track. No
post-rip concatenation required.

I forgot about this.  You can also tell it to bundle just a sequence of 
tracks.

But for the case John mentioned wherein the piece is distributed across 
discs, there is one concatenation required.

Also, my previous statement regarding silent space still stands.

Message-ID: <BAY108-F252A232D2F2950BCDE60A8B8B00@phx.gbl>


Hi:

I have been using MythTV to record TV shows.  My capture
card does not have sound input so I rely on my sound card to record sound.
It has been working for several weeks.

Yesterday, I tried to play with the sound quality (by adjusting just the 
loudness).
And then my sound card won't record.
I used the gnome-panel which comes with a sound recorder and volume control.
No matter what I pick/choose to check the "REC" option, no sound is
recorded.  As testing, I am merely using that sound recorder
to see if it works.  Nothing is captured by that sound recorder.
I think my soundcard is working as I can hear my TV when I plug
in the MIC-in or LINE-in feed from my TV.

I believe my sound card is /dev/audio.

Can someone suggest some tips on how I can debug why my sound
card stops recording input?  I have also checked and nothing is on MUTE.

thanks for any tips.

Just a shot in the dark here: Is it possible that some other app is
holding the /dev/audio device open?  I believe (though I'm no expert in
this field) that the sound card can be used by only one app at a time.
When you fiddled with the loudness, you must have used some app to do
so.  Is it still running?

Maybe set up fluxbox or GnuStep as a debugging environment, which
doesn't have all the panel applets and stuff, and will therefore be
less likely to interfere with everything you're trying to do.  Or use 
TWM.

Permissions on the /dev/audio device?  When I first switched from debian
to gentoo, I went through the whole song and dance.  In gentoo, you must
be a member of the audio group to use the sound devices.  I don't
suppose this is your problem, as you made no mention that you just
switched distros.  Still, who knows if some recent package upgrade made
a policy change like this on your machine.

Often, the "device" which your apps point to is actually just a symlink
to a real device.  /dev/audio could easily be a symlink to /dev/audio1,
for example. Is the symlink still present?

Sounds like you're using a fairly sophisticated app to test your sound
card.  Why not remove some variables from the equation by attempting to
record with a more straightforward app?  Use "wavrec" to record sound to
a raw wav file.  It may be called "rec" on some distros.  May need to
get a microphone.  If that works but MythTV doesn't, at least you know
it's not your hardware.

So, 
I have this dell inspiron 1000 laptop, and thought, oh
hey, lets see what loads on it. 

I figured I would load up some stuff and see if I
could find one the wife would be ok with using, and
that I still felt comfortable with. I loaded
Lindows(they charge for GPL'd software!).  Installed
and worked like a champ, but I didnt like having to
pay anything to download a GPL'd piece of software. 
Loaded ubuntu, worked great, wife didnt like it. 
Today I tried Suse.  It looks great up to the point
that it does hardware detection, and then it doesnt
see my hard drive.  The same hard drive that boots
ubuntu, that lindows saw, that windows sees, that
fedora sees.  

I'm hoping to get this installed.  Anyone have any
ideas on how to make Suse see the hard drive? (I'm
still a novice).

Subject: [PLUG] Openoffice special formula...
Message-ID: <1124208303.43020eaf28b43@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I'm trying to do a checkbook in openoffice's spreadsheet, but I can't
figure out how to do the balance column and something special.

You call the bank and get the current balance, but not all of the
transactions are cleared.  I have a column where I put a symbol to
indicate that a transaction is clear.  Is there a way to get around
having to, by hand, make sure that the bank balance matches the 
spreadsheet balance?  Basically, I've copied the standard Washington
Mutual checkbook register with an added two columns that are for
a date and a bank balance ( I ignored the fee column ).  

I'm thinking I need to have the spreadsheet use a program as a formula.
A simple program that can take the necessary columns as say lists and
process them together.  The program must produce a balance to compare
to the bank's and the balance column.  For the balance column I'm
looking at:

     last_row_balance + current_row_deposit - current_row_payment

                                 .
                                 .
                                 .

For comparing to the bank balance I need to do:

     Balance + Deposit - Payment 

with one important gotcha.  Transactions that are not cleared should 
not be included in the calculation.  This is a dual input formula,
yes/no on a row's information and a running sum of what's being
added or subtracted.

One option instead of a flag column is a column where you enter each
transaction as it clears (requires the use of negative numbers) to
do a simple sum on.  I want this to be easy to understand
though and I don't like increasing the amount of typing that has
to be done.  Every time information has to be added to the spreadsheet,
there is greater potential for errors to be introduced.  Accuracy is
very important when you're trying to keep track of a checkbook.

OpenOffice has support for string comparison functions and conditional 
statements.  It's not pretty and you need to read the manual, but you 
can essentially do something like:

   $balance += (($cleared eq "*") ? $transaction : 0);

I know.  Perl makes it look so easy!  The formula's code *will* be 
uglier.

When I did this, I had two date columns and two balance columns.
There was the date I wrote the check and the date the check cleared.
And there was the actual balance and the bank's balance.

The actual balance column worked as you described.  The bank balance
column was also a running total, but equal to last_row_balance if the
clear_date column was null.  I'm sure you can do something similar.

Have you considered using a personal-finance or checkbook program?

Thanks.  I have openoffice running under Windows on the 
system I've been trying to do this on, but that system 
also has Fedora Core 3.  I figure a Windows version 
would be more convenient.  It makes sense for my friend 
to use this program under Linux though because the Linux 
side is not remotely accessible.  If there is a version
of Linux that will run on top of Windows XP to support
this program, that might also be a nice way to go.

I really like this program trying it out on my own Fedora Core 3
system.  Nice find.

Thanks Jason,

I got tired of fooling around with it and went for a simple:

./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --with-vrootdir=/vservers ; 
make ; make check/test ; make install

Sorry about not getting an announcement out.

Many things happening. Getting speakers is not one of them...

We will be having a meeting.  We do not have a confirmed speaker.  It
will probably devolve into a roundtable discussion and/or Linux related
drinking game.

Brian Martin will be running the meeting.  My 20th wedding anniversary
is that night.

I will send out a "formal" announcement in a few minutes.

Subject: [PLUG] data array from a black and white graphics image
Message-ID: <20050817045007.GA1627@gate.kl-ic.com>


Is there any easy-to-use graphics software library with simple
routines that can be pointed at a two-level black-and-white
png/jpg/gif/tif/other? bitmap image, then returns an array of
ones and zeros?  C, C++, or Perl would be acceptable.  

Why?  I am doing a chip design and need to compute the resistance
of a rectangle with a random assortment of odd-shaped holes ( the
electrical equivalent of swiss cheese) with perhaps 10% accuracy.
The source data is unreadable ("GDS format" complex polygons), but
I have a rendering engine that runs under windoze that can draw a
reasonably accurate screen-sized black-and-white image, which I can
then capture with a screen dump.  After transforming the image to
the desired data array, I can throw it at a simple Poisson solver
and let it crank.  A CAD tool that did the whole shebang would be
nice, but I can probably write a simple one-off solver faster than
I could learn to use the tool.

So again, what library can do the image-to-array readin/transform
easily, which routines, and where can I find simple sample code?  
Alternately, which flat, uncompressed image formats are dead
simple to slurp?  I figure some folks here have actual experience
in this.

I dealt with this a few years ago to trace a faxed PCB into my cad. There 
is a type of tiff that is already just ones and zeros. Look at a B&W, 
uncompressed tiff, that is probably it. You just have to get the row width 
right.

As I learned about a year ago (Sept 2004) on this very mailing list:

  $ convert foo.png foo.txt 

will give you something that looks like:

  $ head foo.txt
  # ImageMagick pixel enumeration: 72,77,255,RGB
  0,0: (254,254,254) #FEFEFE
  1,0: (254,254,254) #FEFEFE
  2,0: (254,254,254) #FEFEFE
  3,0: (254,254,254) #FEFEFE

  5,0: (254,254,254) #FEFEFE

  7,0: (254,254,254) #FEFEFE
  8,0: (254,254,254) #FEFEFE

You ought to be able to hack that into whatever format you like pretty
easily.

Every MP3 player has at its heart an MP32WAV utility.  It's just a matter 
of letting the user close to it.

Odds are pretty good that your system has mpg123 (or its sister mpg321) 
installed already.

>From the man page mpg123(1):

   -w file, --wav
       Write output as WAV file. This will cause the MPEG stream to be
       decoded and saved as file file , or standard output if - is used
       as file name. You can also use --au and --cdr  for AU and CDR
       format, respectively.


if you've got a whole directory full of MP3 files that you'd like to make 
into WAV files (and they're currently named whatever.mp3 and you're happy 
with files correspondingly named whatever.wav), you can just do this:

for file in *mp3; do mpg123 -w `basename "$file" mp3`wav "$file"; done

Fancy.

I'm part of a training course that has a game show game in it. We're
using the Jeopardy format. The program we have displays the daily double
question at the same time as the daily double announcement, not just the
fact that it's a daily double. It defeats the wager concept of waiting
for the wager to be placed. The program works great other than this
issue. It only runs under Internet Explorer for me.

I can e-mail the zip file of the program to any volunteers interested in
helping the Boy Scouts.

Subject: [PLUG] GOSCON, State's white paper on Asterisk
Message-ID: <1124295740.11278.15.camel@localhost.localdomain>

The N4N.org tech section's got a couple of articles that might interest
PLUG folks today. The first announces OSU's Government Open Source
Conference coming up in October:

http://www.news4neighbors.net/article.pl?sid=05/08/16/1839225

The second is more technical, detailing the use of Asterisk to run up to
500 hearings a week via audio conferencing. AFAIK the story is the first
public publishing of this State of Oregon white paper:

http://www.news4neighbors.net/article.pl?sid=05/08/16/1923258

I try not to spam this list with too many announcements of this nature,
but thought these merited comment. To read or publish other tech
articles, keep an eye on the tech section - it's VERY open source

Subject: [PLUG] Dual Boot - Two Drives
Message-ID: <430385AC.4050401@comcast.net>

I'm about to try dual booting with separate drives for Win98SE and SuSE 
9.3. I've got SuSE loaded and working on the first drive. I'm about to 
disconnect that drive and install Win98SE on the other drive, so it 
can't try to do anything to the Linux drive. Once finished, I want to be 
able to boot, through Grub, to either OS.

Has anyone done this, and have any "gotcha's" to share?

I assume there are some directions for how to configure Grub and will go 
read those.

Any recommendations on which drive should be the slave and which the 
master on the IDE controller?

Thanks for any advice.

    I have had overwhelming success with having a pre-existing windows 
XP install on one drive, and Linux (used to be Mandrake, now Kubuntu) on 
a completely separate drive.

    As I mentioned, I had the windows install pre-existing. When I 
installed Mandrake, it auto-detected the windows install and created an 
entry for it (in lilo,) automagically. Kunbuntu not so much. Had to 
convert from grub to lilo, which for me was kinda scary. But lilo seems 
to work.

    I think that having the windows side of things pre-existing might 
make your life a little easier; though I don't know the ins and outs of 
a Suse install. Also which ever HDD is gonna have linux on it should 
probably be the primary/master. You might be able to tell your BIOS 
which HDD to boot first however.

    Just my $.02 worth of experience.

Message-ID: <200508172118.31613.michael.harrisdmd@comcast.net>

Hello friends,

   I am trying to get some friends I write software with to use MySql and PHP.  
The only hurdle I am having to get them over is concerning using MySql on a 
windoze box.  They want a GUI to see data in their database like they are 
used to in Access or SQL Server.  Any suggestions?

   Secondly, I have a database on a Linux machine here at home.  When I try to 
move it to the windoze box we are jointly using for our current project, I 
get an error.  I am using mysqldump to create the text file to make the 
database, then I have tried using mysqlimport.exe on the windoze box.  I get 
an error that tells me a table is missing in the database.  The table it is 
looking for is named the name of the text file I am trying to use to create 
the database:

mysqldump -p databasename >~/Desktop/filename.sql

mysqlimport.exe databasename filename.sql

= error: a table (filename) does not exist on the database.

This is not verbatim, but is as close as I can remember.  Any help is 
appreciated.

I haven't played with MySQL on winders, but the thought that comes to 
mind is, "have you tried creating an empty table with the name 
(filename) in the database before you run mysqldump? Maybe a screwy 
idea, but...

I don't know about the second problem, but for the first there's two
really good options I know of, you can use phpMyAdmin
(http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/) for a good web interface to
MySQL, and you can use MySQL Control Center
(http://www.mysql.com/products/mysqlcc/) if you want a
locally-installed interface (which works on Windows).

If they are using Access, why not let them "link" to the MySQL database 
by building an ODBC connection to the MySQL database.  They can connect 
to the database using whatever permissions they've used in the past and 
view it the same way they would from Access.

If they're looking for a tool like "Access" on a client PC, REKALL 
(http://www.rekallrevealed.org/ or http://www.totalrekall.co.uk/) may be 
a valid option...

If that isn't acceptable....can you identify the client pieces and what 
you are trying to achieve?  Reporting from Windows is completely 
different than data-entry/analysis from Windows against a MySQL database 
(even though it shouldn't be!)

Message-ID: <37075.70.57.126.130.1124385987.squirrel@o4.hostbaby.com>

I'm looking for recommendations for IRC server software. I haven't used
IRC in a looong time :)  This would be used by a small group of people,
privately, with only a few channels. No need for file sharing/transfer.

Ease of setup is a big plus. It would be really nice if people could see
at least some history of the conversation that had happened before they
joined, if possible.

This would probably run on a Solaris 9 or 10 box, but possibly Linux.


Thanks,

Rich

I've been using 'ngircd' for light duty IRC purposes (similar to your
requirements) for six months or so, with very few issues (any problems
I've noticed were all fixed in subsequent releases). It's a pretty
simple IRCD. Fairly young, but actively developed. It takes all of
about 20 minutes to compile and configure.

Subject: [PLUG] Any lispers out there?  Newbie needs booster shot
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0508181745160.6330@localhost>

I am a software developer who has, up until now, used pay-dirt
languages exclusively (java, php, perl, other "hot" languages in
today's workaday world).

I have come to the realization that lisp is the only language that
matters.  I'm gobbling it up like a greedy child.  With any luck, I'll
find a way to use it at my paying job.

I have just written my first useful macro.  There is one small problem
with it that I do not have the lisp knowledge to solve.  I need to
know more about symbols vs. strings when used unquoted (preceded by
",") in a macro (or, really, in a backticked list).

Among other tasks, this macro writes a (defclass) and a (defmethod).
The name of the class I am creating is currently passed in as a symbol
(not a string).  Another argument of the macro is a URL (string).

I would like to be able to do away with the class name argument, since
the calling code does not need to know this bit of information.  I
would rather use the URL (a unique string) to derive a class name,
inside the macro definition.

Here's the relevant code (I'm using SBCL):

(defvar *document-root-url* nil
   "This is the public URL of the site.  Example: \"http://localhost:3000\".")
(setf *document-root-url*
       (let ((fqdn #+sbcl(sb-bsd-sockets:host-ent-name
                             (sb-bsd-sockets:get-host-by-name
                             (machine-instance)))
                   #-sbcl (format nil "localhost")))
         (make-url :scheme "http"
                   :host fqdn
                   :port *tcp-port*)))

(defvar *website-url* nil)
(setf *website-url*
       (urlstring
         (merge-url *document-root-url* "/jewelery")))

(defvar *title* "Pippi's Jewelery")

(defun make-absolute-url(url)
   "Prepends *WEBSITE-URL* to the given URL and returns the full URL as
a string."
   (concatenate 'string *website-url* url))

(defmacro publish-page (handler-class-name url &rest body)
   "Macro to do the grunt work of creating and installing a subclass of
HANDLER for each page you wish to publish.

Publishing a page entails 3 actions:
     - defining a class for the page that is a subclass of HANDLER;
     - implementing the handle-request-response method on this class;
     - installing an instance of the handler into the listener.

This macro automates the production of all this code."
   `(progn
      (defclass ,handler-class-name (handler) ())
      (defmethod handle-request-response ((handler ,handler-class-name)
                                           method
                                           request)
        (request-send-headers request)
        (html-stream (request-stream request) , at body))
      (install-handler (http-listener-handler *listener*)
                       (make-instance ',handler-class-name)
                       (make-absolute-url ,url)
                       t)))

(publish-page jewelery-home
               "/home"
               `(html
                 (head (title ,*title*))
                 (body ((h1 :align "center") "Hello Pip"))))


This is part of a simple website page publisher.  It uses araneida as
the web server API.  Please assume that functions like MERGE-URL and
URLSTRING are provided by the API and just work.  *document-root-url*,
by the way, is an object, not a string.  We want a string for the call
to INSTALL-HANDLER.  That part works - I'm worried about something
else in this code.

The code I didn't show you (because it works and has nothing to do
with the problem) supplies an instance of an araneida LISTENER class
in the constant *listener*.  *listener* has a slot to hold a single
DISPATCHING-HANDLER object, which is the container for the collection
of HANDLER instances.  This alist of HANDLER objects is keyed by URL
string.

A HANDLER is nothing more than a class with no slots and a single
method, HANDLE-REQUEST-RESPONSE.  The URL is used at request time to
look up the corresponding subcless of HANDLER, and calling the
HANDLE-REQUEST-RESPONSE method specialized on that subclass gets us to
the right function to render the page.  That is all done by the
araneida API.  To use the API, all we need to do is populate
DISPATCHING-HANDLER with HANDLER subclasses.

Another user-written lisp file is responsible for creating the
*listener* instance and putting the singeton root DISPATCHING-HANDLER
in it.  The code supplied above is what adds the HANDLER instances to
the DISPATCHING-HANDLER using INSTALL-HANDLER.

PUBLISH-PAGE is the macro that automates the writing of the code for
creating and installing a page handler.  It creates a subclass of
HANDLER.  Then it overrides the HANDLE-REQUEST-RESPONSE method, which
will get called by araneida when a request to the matching URL is
made.  Then it calls INSTALL-HANDLER to place the sublassed HANDLER
into the DISPATCHING-HANDLER.  This macro is where I need help.

There are 2 places where I run up against my limited lisp knowledge.
Both involve the class name:

      (defclass ,handler-class-name (handler) ())
      (defmethod handle-request-response ((handler ,handler-class-name)
                                           method
                                           request)

I shouldn't be passing in handler-class-name, since the code outside
this macro has no reason to care about the name of the class.  I
should be generating the class name somehow.  I can use the URL string
for this.  If my goal were to simply make another string that is based
off the URL, that would be easy.  I'm sure it will be the first step
of any solution to my problem.

Ultimately, I need the class name to be a symbol though, not a string.
The places where I put ",handler-class-name" need to be symbols.  That
is why it looks like this when I call the macro:

     (publish-page jewelery-home
                   "/home"
                   `(html
                     (head (title ,*title*))
                     (body ((h1 :align "center") "Hello Pip"))))

jewelery-home is not quoted or stringified.  It must be through some
magic of DEFMACRO argument lists that I am able to use this uninterned
symbol with no value in this way withoug a compiler error.

Is there a way to turn a string into a symbol, or get a symbol
representation of a string?  If so, I could quote jewelery-home and
treat it like a string.  Or better yet, I could transform the URL into
a class name using string handling functions.

I looked at INTERN and FIND-SYMBOL as a way of converting a string to
a symbol and back again.  I'm guessing, however, that there is a
common idiom for what I am trying to do, and I just need it to be
brought to my attention.

The question again, stated clearly this time:

In lisp, how do you convert a string into a symbol and place it,
unquoted, in a quoted list (as in a macro body)?

I'm using miniircd for that.  It's a short (910 line) Python IRC daemon
that's really pretty bare-minimum.  Setup doesn't get much easier
(essentially there is none).

AFAIK, you can't do that with IRC - you might take a look at Jabber?

I haven't looked at your whole problem, but have you tried MACROEXPAND?

That should tell you whether your macro is expanding to what you
expect it to.

Yes indeed, I have used MACROEXPAND-1 to see the fruits of my labors.
That is how I came to realize that I cannot pass in handler-class-name
as a string, because it gets written into the macro output with
quotes.  Maybe I could use PRINC to strip the quotes, but that seems
hacky.  I really want to use the right method, and do it the Lisp Way.
To me, that means avoiding string representations of code whenever
possible.  I do need to deal with handler-class-name as a string when
I'm producing it, but I want it to be a symbol when I apply it to the
DEFCLASS and DEFMETHOD forms.

I may try INTERN.  It looks promising.

Is this useful?

  * (describe 'gensym)

  GENSYM is an external symbol in #<PACKAGE "COMMON-LISP">.
  Function: #<FUNCTION GENSYM>
  Its associated name (as in FUNCTION-LAMBDA-EXPRESSION) is GENSYM.
  The function's arguments are:  (&OPTIONAL (THING G))
  Function documentation:
    Creates a new uninterned symbol whose name is a prefix string (defaults
     to "G"), followed by a decimal number. Thing, when supplied, will
     alter the prefix if it is a string, or be used for the decimal number
     if it is a number, of this symbol. The default value of the number is
     the current value of *gensym-counter* which is incremented each time
     it is used.
  Its declared argument types are:
    (&OPTIONAL (OR (VECTOR CHARACTER) (VECTOR NIL) BASE-STRING UNSIGNED-BYTE))
  Its result type is:
    (VALUES SYMBOL &OPTIONAL)

Message-ID: <200508200230.j7K2UK0j075167@m5p.com>

>From the article http://theinquirer.net/?article=24638 which is talking
about "East Fork" the Intel hardware DRM scheme. From the third
paragraph:

"It replaces the chipsets with Calistoga and ICH7-DHM, not a big change,
and the rest remains the same. How they are going to sell a 64 bit launch
and a quarter later an 'upgrade' to a 32 bit version is beyond me, but it
isn't my idea."

I'm curious, because if that statement is correct, this could be the end
for the Intel DRM. If true this is *so* much more brain-damaged than the
P4 design, I fail to see how they could market such a step backwards.

GENSYM worked for me this time.  I tried it at some earlier point, and
I got a compiler error - it said the symbol was not a valid class
name.  The macro was in poor shape then - it was a symptom of another
problem.

This solution is very lispy, and I thank you.  Short, sweet, no
strings, no need to convert the URL to a class name even.  Just a LET:


(defmacro publish-page (url &rest body)
   (let ((handler-class-name (gensym)))
     `(progn
        (defclass ,handler-class-name (handler) ())
        (defmethod handle-request-response ((handler ,handler-class-name) method request)
          (request-send-headers request)
          (html-stream (request-stream request) , at body))
        (install-handler (http-listener-handler *listener*)
                         (make-instance ',handler-class-name)
                         (make-absolute-url ,url)
                         t))))


Lisp rocks.

That got me started.  The way I ended up going, though, was to use
the text ("P2") form of the .pgm (portable gray map) format.  This
is a simple header, followed by a list of single decimal values for
each grayscale pixel.  I now have a simple program with fixed array
sizes, and I will tweak a bit more on it to use libslack to call
malloc so I can use variable-sized arrays.  

What I wrote is very slow, a simple diffusion-with-acceleration 
Poisson solution, but I let it crank overnight and it makes dandy-
looking field plots (also in pgm).  I didn't have a good way to
make contour lines through the data, so I did "zebra plots" AKA
band contours, where zones of similar value get the same gray level
in alternating bands.  Easy to code, just scale the value of the
pixels by the number of desired bands, truncate to integers, then
AND-out the LSB, scaling the result back to one of the two gray
levels.  Looks like zebra stripes.

In general, I am quite pleased with the results, and entering the
geometry for the shapes I need to study is quite easy using screen
captures from my CAD tools, with some touch-up in gimp.  I think I
shall put the program up on the web and see who can develop it into
a more general tool, or speed up the calculations.

mplayer should do it, if you have the win32codecs.

Just use the pcm output plug-in (mplayer -ao pcm, if I recall).

I have to speak up here.

LISP was a language we used in college, mostly for proof-of-concept.  
The neat thing about LISP is that you can "black box" everything.  If 
you need a routine but don't know how to do that routine, you flowchart 
it as a black box, and then see about getting it to run or better yet 
get someone else to build it.

Eventually we discovered that LISP is more of a theoretical language.  
Its compiled binaries are slow and clunky.

We determined that LISP stood for "Lots of Interesting Silly Parentheses."

If you're using JAVA, php, perl, C(+...), etc., STICK WITH THEM.  They 
will make you money.  LISP is more of an academic language for theories 
and such.

I have to speak up here. Yes, Lisp is indeed a theoretical language. 
However, its compiled binaries aren't necessarily slow and clunky any 
more. GCL, CMUCL and SBCL, all free and open source, by the way, are 
quite efficient, and if you want an even more efficient way, there's Scheme.

There are two application areas where Lisp still reigns supreme. One is 
symbolic mathematics -- Maxima is the best known free package. The other 
is "artificial intelligence".

Isn't AutoCAD also written in lisp?

I do make $$$ writing java struts apps.  I don't intend to quit my day
job.  But I am of the opinion that java sucks.  I think lisp compares
unfavorably to languages like java in today's business world for the
same reason all other business decisions are made - marketing.  Java
sounds cool, while lisp does not.  There is money behind java, pushing
it into our workplace, while lisp is nothing more than a specification
and a handful of kooks who keep it alive with their efforts in
implementing the specification.  God, I love those kooks!

Java is a one-dimensional language.  There is no precompiler and no
macros.  The code you write gets compiled at compile-time and run at
run-time, that's it.

When you add macros to the equation, you get another dimension that
complicates the understanding of how the language compiles and runs,
but provides a powerful means to abstract code.  Abstracting in java
is very different than abstracting in lisp.  I find the lisp way much
easier to develop.  You write the code in a very straightforward
style, and then you write a macro to generate that straightforward
code with as little input as possible.  The macro will then be your
copy-and-paste agent.  Simple but effective, it's amazing how well
macros can shorten and simplify code.  In java, you have to think
abstraction every step of the way, and you have to invent the
abstraction yourself, ending up with large, overblown systems of code
to do simple things.  If you really take java abstraction to the
limit, you often end up with reflection, which is klunky as heck and
difficult to read and debug.

C is better.  At least it does what you tell it to do, and it gives
you the power to do what you need.  You can have an 8-bit unsigned
value in C.  You can shift all 8 bits one place to the left.  Try that
in java.  It's even possible to implement the equivalent of a lisp
multimethod in C, using structs.  Java doesn't even support multile
inheritance.  There are implementations of lisp that get parsed and
rewritten as C, and then compiled.  C doesn't suck like java does.
But it still has certain shortcomings that are inherent in any
language with a rigid syntax that distinguishes between functions and
data.

The main area where lisp reigns supremee is its avoidance of strings.
The best example I can think of is the code I'm currently working on -
HTML generation.  Instead of writing a 50 megabyte library to separate
view and controller (I speak of struts/jsp here), a lisp library like
araneida can allow the HTML and the controller code to be freely
intermixed with no distincion between the two, and it requires only
one small lisp function to implement it.  Araneida's implementation of
an HTML library is very succinct; it does not actually implement
functions for HTML, BODY, etc.  It merely rewrites the list you feed
it as markup, and it doesn't care at all what the symbols mean.  A
library that does implement every HTML tag as a lisp function would
give the added advantage of telling you when you spell "html" wrong.
I think portable aserve and lml do exactly that.  Compile-time
checking of HTML - what a concept!  It is only possible when you don't
treat data and functions as different animals.

A fine example of string abuse is XML.  What is XML?  It is a bunch of
strings with metadata included to help you find the strings.  Struts
is built upon XML.  Can the compiler tell you when you made a typo in
your struts-config.xml file?  I should say not.  So how do you find
out you made a typo?  When you're starting at a blank white screen in
a browser, with no error message of any kind, of course.  XML is
derived from lisp s-expression syntax, but it took a seriously wrong
turn when it stringified the data.

A traditional java servlet puts all the HTML into strings.  Struts/jsp
gets you away from that, but at the price of introducing more huge XML
files into the equation, separation of the code into more files, and
poorer debugging.  And is it really doing anything different than a
lisp macro?  No - the jsp gets parsed and rewritten as a traditional
servlet.  Ironically, that is the smartest thing about using java to
write a webapp.  Of course, it's done in the usual, massively overbown
java style.

They say that the average programmer writes the same number of lines
of code in a day of work, no matter what language they are writing in.
Java, XML and XSL are highly verbose, while lisp is super compact.  I
think I heard somewhere that lisp weighs in at 1/10 the verbosity of
java.

So does the discriminating developer need to use sucky languages like
java 40 hours a week?  Because of human nature and marketing, the
answer is a somber "yes".  But there's no way I'm going to write
personal code in anything but common lisp from now on.

Ok, too late.  Sorry.

The ImageMagick library is great.  You can load pretty much any format, 
reduce it to grayscale or B&W, save in almost any format, etc.

I would be interested in adding support for this to the uber-converter 
or CAD::Drawing if you want to repeat or automate this process and have 
a decent spec.

The canonical response to that perspective is found here:

We even had a guy here in the PLUG community for a while who was CTO
of a company that used Common Lisp very successfully.  It is not
simply an academic or AI language.

I just put a Seagate 5400 RPM 80G drive in my notebook, and it's like a
new computer. OOo starts in 12 seconds; it used to take almost 30.

It was about $130 from newegg.com.

What did you take out and what kind of laptop?  This is way too

Never said it was only for that, I said it was MORE for that.  Please, 
Russell, quote me PROPERLY, do not change my wording.  It is better 
suited to academia than real-life applications for most people.  You 
might be the exception, but I was offering an opinion.  My opinion is 
not incorrect.  You don't have to agree with my opinion, in fact I 
welcome other opinions - diversity is a good thing.

You cannot *correct* my opinion.  It is MY opinion, and therefore valid, 
the same as anyone else's opinion.  You might not agree with it, you 
might not like it, but you cannot *CHANGE* it based upon your improper 
re-phrasing of my wording.

As you appear to think you're the authority on this, if you're going to 
comment, do NOT change my intent with respect to my language.  Flamewars 
have been started on less.  Inaccurate quoting is not appropriate.

I've considered getting a bigger/faster hard drive for my laptop
(Inspiron 2650) so it can last until Apple has x86 iBooks (I want to
upgrade to an iBook, but don't want to obsolete myself *just that fast*).

However, heat is a significant issue with my laptop.  I've fried one
wifi card (literally).  I'd rather not do more damage to the system than
is necessary if it is to last another 24-36 months.

What kind of heat output are you getting with said 5400RPM drive?  Is it
noticably warmer?  Does it suck down the battery faster?  In your speed
comparisons, what kind of drive was your old drive?

On my system, the small amount of RAM (384MB) and slow hard drive are
the two significant bottlenecks, both feeding off each other (reduced
disk caching due to small amount of RAM and slow swapping due to a slow
hard drive)... I can only upgrade my RAM to 512MB, leaving me with only
a faster hard drive to speed things up and last me another few years.

Huh?  I elided some of your post (inserting squared-bracket'd
ellipses to show where) to what I was responding to.  This is SOP.
The "References" header in the message points to your original if
there is any confusion about what you said originally.

You are certainly entitled to your opinion.  I simply added another,
somewhat different one to demonstrate, if nothing else, the lack of
consensus on the subject.

I want to thank you for all of the help that you provided to me last
weekend.  You helped me to fix one of the problems that was plaguing me.

Others on this board beat some things way past death or don't help at
all.  it has always been that way and probably always will.

Thanks again,

My Orinoco Gold cards heat up like crazy, but they did that in my old
Toshiba notebook also.

According to my research, the 5400 RPM drives use power more efficiently
than the 4200 RPM drives. The technology in the older drives hasn't
changed significantly since they switched from 12.5mm to 9.5mm. The 5400
RPM drives, on the other hand, have smarter firmware, bigger caches (so
the heads don't have to move around as much), better bearings (less
power required to maintain rotation), and more efficient electronics.

I haven't noticed any difference in the battery life or heat, and I have
the drive in a more aggressive mode (longer delay before spindown) than
the old drive was using.

What kind of memory do you need? I have a couple of 256M PC2100 cards

I wonder how many others are trying to squeak a little bit more life out
of their current laptops in hopes of decent x86 Macs?  :-)

It wasn't the wifi card that caused the fryage - it was the CPU vent
being blocked for a few minutes while the CPU itself was pegged at 100%.
 The CPU temperature was reported to be 85C.  In reality, it was
probably a bit cooler... but when I caught it at that high temperature,
my wifi card froze, the laptop froze, and the wifi card never worked
fully again.  Drivers recognized it, but it was otherwise worthless.  I
replaced it with a $30 PrismII from Fry's.

Ahhh... very nice.  I suppose that would make a ton of sense as laptop
manufacturers have begun to realize such things are important.
Efficiency over raw speed and all that.

Guess I'll log on to newegg and pick up a new laptop drive.

What kind of hdparm settings are you using?  It's been a long time (a
year and a half?) since I even looked at tweaking the settings here.

256MB PC2100 sticks.  Actually I just need one (two slots, each a max of
256MB, one filled with a 256MB stick, the other with a 128MB stick).
I'll contact you off-list.  :-)

Perhaps early versions in the past, but I highly doubt they're using LISP
today. As far as the hardware requirements go though, part of that is
OS overhead, but a lot of it is working with very large amounts of very
detailed data.

Whatever else you say about Java, they *did* do a very nice job with the
object system. Making inheritance strictly for code reuse and interfaces
for abstraction works quite well and efficiently. Multiple inheritance
in C++ does get insane quickly.

Distinguishing them is a bad thing? Given that most processors being made
now do tend to make data non-executable, this does seem to map quite well
to C's target, low-level hardware. I'll confess that all too often I wish
there was a more advanced preprocessor, but then again M4 is available.

Failing that, that distinction really isn't /that/ strong. Pointers to
functions are like any other data type. I can easily cast random data to
a function pointer and cause it to be executed. The results will almost
certainly be non-useful, but I can do it. I could also cast a function
pointer to something and use it as data, again not too useful in most
cases, but I can do it.

Woah!  Look back a bit, buddy.  You asked "What happened to the vacation 
utility?" and Russ offered his opinion as to why he thinks it's no longer 
part of "the standard distribution" (another of your laments).  The 
request for an alternative was the last sentence of your post.

If you ask what to use, you're going to get opinions that include 
"nothing" (usually with an explanation as to why).  Russ's response was 
completely appropriate for your original post.  No confusion on his part.

On Debian (both stable and unstable -- I tried my mail server as well, I 
get this:

jbrelin at person:~$ apt-cache search vacation
bsdmainutils - collection of more utilities from FreeBSD
gnarwl - Email autoresponder based on LDAP
mailagent - An automatic mail-processing tool and filter.
plan - X/Motif day planner (dynamically compiled with LessTif)
sork-accounts - Account handling framework for horde
sork-vacation - Manage vacation notices in horde
vacation - email autoresponder

There are several alternatives.  The original was removed from 
bsdmainutils and now resides in its own package exactly because it is so 
often abused or misused that it's better to give the administrator the 
option of installing it or not.

I don't know why your system doesn't have it.  Perhaps you need a better 
way to browse available packages.

SSH probably isn't what you want.  You can set the refresh time of the
page and then print the last few log entries, which pretty much a
nearly-realtime tail.  There's also some push stuff with multipart
documents, I think, but I've never really fooled with that.

As Wil mentioned, the refresh header is probably the simplest thing.  If 
you want it to only load new lines from the server (as opposed to the 
whole page), you'll have to do something more AJAXian.

Wil, Eric;

I've thought of this but not too sure how it would work.  At several
thousand to tens of thounds of messages per hour I think I really need (
or the "Powers That Be" will want ) something more _streamy_.

This is why I thought a ssh window in a frame would be good.

Testing will show me whether I'm full of it or not.


Thanks,
Rod

Hello!

Is there any way to configure my syslog server on my debian machine to
place all the remote logs from my router (netgear) into a single file?
At the moment, when I use the "-r" option, all the netgear logs go into
the various different files (auth.log for logins, syslog and messages
for the others).  But, I'd like all of them to go into one file... like,
say, /var/log/netgear.log.

Thanks for any help.

Uhm, at that point it becomes more appropriate to have a script look
at the logfiles for you.  Monitoring streamy things at that rate is
a great way of inducing fatigue and indifference in the operator.

Unsolicited advice:
Think blinky warning things instead.  Also think LogWatch, NAGIOS,
sendpage and other off-the-shelf tools for making your job easier and
your TPS* reports prettier and more action-packed.

My experience with the Java SSH thingy was that I couldn't find a
Winders box with Java installed anyway.

You may just be best off with PuTTY, or with CygWin ssh.

I'd go something AJAXian, myself.  It's not horribly complicated to do
and scores quite high on the "WOW" factor as of late.  :-)

Already happening.  Logwatch and pflogsumm.pl plus some custom scripts 
that page when things don't look right.

The scroll is using colorize so we get lots of color blinky things.  When
a support call comes in or a pager goes off we can look and determine 
quickly if messages are being delivered ( bright green 250 mesages  ) to 
the _actual_ mail server etc.

This is probably true here.  The d**n box is close to needing a reload 
according to the WindersFolks.  

> You may just be best off with PuTTY, or with CygWin ssh.

You're probably right.  But since the logs get rotated once a week I have 
to login again and restart ( select from a menu ) the processes and then 
move them around on the Windows box screen so they are viewable/usable.  

I may end up back at writing a custom watchy-log application that has all 
the bells and whistles wanted and needed.


Thanks for the ideas,
Rod

I don't know that it can keep up with the data flow but I do need it ( or 
some of the ideas ) for another project so this will bear looking into.

Like I said in my other message this may just need to be done with 
specificly designed for this purpose program.

I'm looking at Newegg right now and don't see a Seagate drive in the
80GB size... but do see 60GB drives.  Close enough for me.

However, you stated you did some research before purchase - why'd you go
with the Seagate as opposed to the Toshiba drives which offer a full
16MB of cache at a lower cost?  Is the motor/firmware/whatever in the
Seagate considerably better or is it just Seagate's good name that was
the deciding factor?

I'm looking very hard at the 80GB Toshiba 5400RPM drive with 16MB of
cache right now.  :-)

FWIW, Seagate drives have a 5 year warranty, versus 3 years for the Toshiba.
Of course, you probably saw that already.

Sorry, I got the Hitachi. I was going to get the Seagate, but I wanted
80G and there was one other factor that I can't recall right now. I
remembered the Seagate because it scored the best in the reviews I read.
The Hitachi was not far behind.

I was looking for something that would be faster AND keep the power
requirements about the same (or better). The Toshiba didn't benchmark
significantly better in spite of the cache, and I think it was noisier,
though I can't remember exactly what its shortcomings were. I've had
Toshiba drives fail on me in the past, and while my hardware failure
list is not a statistically significant sample, I have not seen failures
in Seagate or IBM/Hitachi drives.

I also got the Hitachi for about $20 less than the 80G drive that scored
better in the power and speed tests. I guess if I had endless money, I
would have gotten the Seagate 100G drive and an extra battery. #:)

FWIW, I went ahead and got a Hitachi as well.  As my target price was
under $100, I went for the 60gig drive.  Had I noticed the warranty
difference, I'd have been inclined to go with the Seagate, but "oh
well".

Regarding Hitachi (and formerly IBM) HD's, I think the class-action
settlement claims on the Deskstar drives is due in the next week or
so.  I have at least one and possibly two of the buggers.  I might
have to kill my 529+ day uptime (since mid-March 2004) to get one of
them out of a box.  I recall reading each one was worth $100 or
something like that.

I own a Deathstar - I won't buy another IBM/Hitachi.  That's just me,

Do you recall where you found these reviews?  I haven't seen decent
laptop hard drive reviews anywhere out there.. a nice up-to-date
comparison review sure would be nice, though.

The Google guys (who lose 50-70 servers per DAY, mostly to hard drive
failures) say that there is no drive manufacturer that is significantly
better than another (from the big names: IBM, Maxtor, Seagate, WD).
They've got the data to make such statements authoritatively, for 3.5"
IDE drives.

But notebook drives are something else entirely, I think.

There was a good one on Tom's Hardware, and another on a site I can't
recall. Storage Review? The Tom's article was a little dated, but there
was only one comparable drive in the NewEgg catalog that wasn't in the
review at the time I bought.

The review that measured power usage is lost in the neural fog at this
point.  Sorry.

So how'd you go about writing your first AJAX thingy, and would you
recommend others take the same route?

Ruby On Rails is the way all the cool kids are doing it, but after
having a go at PHP, I got tired of learning a new language every time
I write a web-app.

Well, I was time constrained and needed it to deal with a UI issue I
couldn't figure out a sane way of solving otherwise... so I hired a guy
to do it for me.  He pulled it together in a few days and left me with a
framework I was able to relatively easily modify to suit my needs there
and elsewhere.  I haven't taken the time to learn enough Javascript to
really implement it well otherwise.

I wouldn't suggest hiring somebody to do it for you.  :-)

Ditto.  I don't like the look of RoR syntax, either.  It looks too VBish
to me.  I like my curly braces, dammit!

I haven't yet found a decent PHP AJAX framework... and writing AJAX
stuff by hand is quite time consuming when you need to support more than
just IE and Firefox (Opera, Safari, Konqueror, anybody?)...

I'd really like to implement some AJAX on a storefront site I'm writing
(totally from scratch - reinventing a wheel, thankyouverymuch!), but it
just doesn't seem like the necessary browser support is available for it
today.  Oh well..................

Donald Becker, co-founder of the Beowulf project and a user of lots of 3.5" 
IDE, says the same thing. He finds that there is more variation in quality 
between manufacturing lots than between vendors.

Message-ID: <20050824003845.GA3082@subtend.net>

I recently became the owner of a used Auspex NS2000 storage array.  The
system controller is two parts: a Tyan MB dual P3 with 3GB of RAM and a
Solaris/SPARC system on a reiser card.  They were connected to each other
using a Dolphin SCI-to-PCI board which has two high density connectors on
it similar to VHDCI SCSI only shorter. 

I'm gutting the system, putting the Mylex ExtremeRAID 2000 controllers in 
a linux box I have, and connecting the disk shelves up to that.  Hardware 
RAID and lvm are working great so far.

The dolphins are available for anyone who wants them.  I only ask that
you make a small donation to the EFF.

The look like this:

Subject: [PLUG] Setting Up Thunderbird for Usenet
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0508240807320.28158@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I'm having problems setting up a laptop running Thunderbird-1.0.6 for
Usenet access. It works just fine for mail, but something's missing for news
groups.

   The server name, news.aracnet.com, is there and it doesn't matter if SSL is
turned on or off. At one point I was presented with a dialog box in which I
entered the username and the aracnet password. Still, no list of available
newsgroups shows up.

   I know that aracnet wants authentification, which I have for me in
~/.slrnrc, as "nnrpaccess ...". I don't know where to put the equivalent for
Thunderbird.

   Pointers and suggestions greatly appreciated.

TIA,

Rich

   I forgot to mention in the original post that I've read the FAQ and other
docs on www.mozilla.org and have done what they suggest for setting up a news
account. I suspect it's the authentification at aracnet that's missing.

Subject: [PLUG] $100 to install Fedora Core and ZoneMinder in Gresham Today
Message-ID: <1124566284.2504.11.camel@localhost.localdomain>

I'm not sure what my problem is here.  I'm a bit unfamiliar with how
Fecora Core requires me to run rpmbuild *simply* to get at the source
code and headers for compiling stuff.

In any event, I'm receiving compile errors up the butt for both ffmpeg
and zoneminer, and I can't seem to resolve them.  I'm guessing my
problems stem from not understanding how to properly install the header
(.h) files for the various libraries that zoneminder uses.

Additionally, a few days ago when I *did* manage to get zoneminder
installed on FC2, it wouldn't record anything from the camera.  xawtv
was able to get the video though.

Long story short.  I'm on a deadline.  If this doesn't get done today,
then I go to Windows, and some really expensive commercial software.  :P

$100 (obo) to anyone that can come out and get this thing working
for/with me.  I'm open to re-installing any Fedora Core OS or CentOS
from scratch to make the job as quick/painless as possible.

reply off-list for my phone #.

Thanks
Rich

   Well, I put the required servername, username, ans password in her
~/.thunderbird/News/news.aracnet.com (not sure the string's correct, I'm
doing it from memory), and still cannot get a list of available news groups.

Hi Rich,

Are you putting in your entire email address for authentication?
It's a quirk of aracnet. iirc

SSL should be off.
Authenticate with full email address and password.
news.aracnet.com
and if all else fails, call after 2:30pm for tech support.

  Does anyone know of an OpenSource (or not) application that monitors
the software release and configurations of network devices, like
routers, switches, and CSUs.

  We currently use spreadsheets and a collection of vendor tools.  We
use CiscoWorks to handle Cisco devices.  Other vendor seems to have
their own "Enterprise" tool to monitor their own stuff.  I haven't
found anything that works across different platforms.  My managers
(and auditors) want us to do a better job.

  COSI on SourceForge has some nice tools.  CiscoConf and configsafe
are pretty close.  They look like they could be extended with a little
effort, but my management is unfriendly to me writing lots of code. 
They don't like "science projects".

  Is anyone out there doing anything clever to audit the software and
configs in network device?

There is Pancho: http://www.pancho.org/; I haven't used it, but I've
heard a number of people who seem to like it.  If it does not report
software version, you can get this pretty easily via SNMP.

Can you get enough information out of SNMP? 
iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.system.sysDescr (1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1)
tends to give quite a bit of info about most switch software revisions
that I've encountered.  The standard snmpget tool from net-snmp-utils
is pretty scriptable.

Subject: [PLUG] SCSI devices on Mandrake 10.1 and Mandriva LE 2005 (aka 10.2)
Message-ID: <20050824191246.06F23407A@joseph.doink.com>

Howdy folks,

I'm having a heck of a time getting my SCSI devices (2 hard
drives, a DAT tape drive, and a CD-RW drive) to be accessible
on MDK10.1 and MDK10.2.  The two versions are 1 each on two
different machines.  On one machine I'm using a BusLogic SCSI
card.  On the other I'm using an Adaptec SCSI card.  The BIOS
of both machines recognizes the cards and the attached devices.
Linux on both machines recognizes the SCSI cards, but neither
machine will show any attached SCSI devices.  I used to run
MDK10.0 on the machine that is now MDK10.1, and the SCSI hard
drives worked just fine at that time.  I was running a 2.6 kernel
on MDK10.0, and I'm running 2.6 kernels on both machines now.

I've searched web archives and Linux sites for info on this
trouble.  One person said there was an errata, but they weren't
clear on the version, which might have been MDK10.0.  One person
said that they cured their trouble by moving their SCSI card to
a different PCI slot.  I tried my SCSI card in every PCI slot on
one of the machines.  Others are saying that udev could be the
problem.  I'm not versed in udev at all.  Is there anyone out in
PLUG-land that can give me some advice?

Here's a little more info:

On the MDK10.2 machine (Athlon 64-X2, ABIT AV8 motherboard) dmesg shows:

	scsi0: sata_via
	scsc1: sata_via

That seems very strange.  I don't have any SATA drives.  But, there 
is SATA capability on the motherboard.  FWIW, the single processor
and SMP kernels act the same on this machine.



On the MDK10.1 machine (Celeron, Intel D845PESV motherboard) I see this:

OK, that's fine.  But, those devices don't seem to be hooked to any 
hardware, according to the kernel.


I'm really stumped & stuck.  Any thoughts people?  Many thanks....

  You're correct, net-snmp is very scriptable.  I've written a number
of Perl scripts that use SNMP to monitor and manage devices in the
network.  But that was under a different management team.  My current
management is afraid of code.  They don't want this to turn into a
science project

RANCID - http://www.shrubbery.net/rancid/. It's great, simple, and at
this point handles Cisco, Juniper, HP, Kentrox, Bay, Foundry,
Riverstone, Redback, Netscreen, and other devices. Uses a combination of
Perl and Expect to telnet or ssh to devices, and stores their configs in
a CVS repository.

Developers are here in town, even. Works great.

  Thanks, it looks interesting.  The site is a little thin on
documentation.  I'll download it and give it a try.

Scripting this doesn't rise to the level of science project.  Why don't
you whip it up some morning, put a psudonym on it and show management the
nice tool you found on the net?

Harry,

   Yes; I emulated what I have set up for slrn that works just fine. It's the
aracnet username, not the local domain username, too.

   I may have to, Harry. When I click on the "Newsgroups" button on the
extreme left, a dialog box for subscribing can be invoked. I put a word in
the "Show items that contain " widget, put her aracnet password in the popup
dialog box, press all the "OK" buttons, and get a message box, "A News (NNTP)
error occurred. Authentification failed."

   Hmmm-m-m-m.

galen,

   Does this occur with all pdf files?

   I did not see this with 5.0.8, 5.0.9, or the current 5.0.10.

Yes, this appears to be the case.  FWIW, I'm using XFce 4.0.6 under RH9.

   Well! It turns out that when we switched from dialup to DSL in 1999,
Pamela's aracnet account went poof! No wonder I couldn't get her
authenticated on the nntp server there. Thank you, Harry!!

   Now she authenticates using my account and all's well once again.

Whew!

galen,

   I'll be darned! Haven't seen this at all. Xfce is up to 4.2.<something>,
but that shouldn't matter one whit. Try upgrading acroread to 5.0.10.

   Same ThinkPad running Slackware-10.1 as had the NNTP problem. Now I'm
trying to figure out why the GIMP will not include .ico, .hrz, or .jpg in the
list of recognized image file formats. It's the same version (2.2.8) that I
have installed on the workstations and my notebook, and they all load .jpg
files just fine. The ThinkPad doesn't show these formats as available.

   I un-installed the package and re-installed it with a fresh download. No
difference.

   Any ideas?

Just for grins, see if the "~/.gimp-2.2/pluginrc" files differ on the
two systems.

Ali,

   Sonofagun! They are. Wonder how that happened. Guess I'll copy the more
complete one over to that box.

   Well, the laptop is in use now so I'll have to wait to learn if my copy
fixed the problem. I'll send a follow up message as soon as I know.

Thanks,

Rich

   Sigh. Nope. The GIMP didn't like my changing the pluginrc by hand.

   So, how do I get the proper plugins? Do I wipe out ~/.gimp-2.2/, then
re-install the application?

Thanks,

Try first just moving that directory out of the way; GIMP scans for
plugins and whatnot when it starts--reinstalling probably won't help.

Wil,

   Thanks for the suggestion, but it did not fix the problem. After going
through the re-initiation of the directory, the list of recognized formats
still misses everything between GIMP and KISS. Quite strange. I'm not sure
what to do next.

   A google search found a similar problem with freeBSD that was solved by
adding a library (not libjpeg). This made me wonder if that machine was
missing the jpeg libraries, but it isn't. They're all there in /usr/lib, the
same as on a working host.

   Diogenes continues his search for the truth of why the GIMP won't open jpg
files.

Can you open up jpg files in any other gtk-based programs?  Just about
anything that can display or manipulate images and starts with "g" is
likely to be gtk-based.  Try gqview if you have it.  For that matter,
is there ANY other program on the same machine that can display jpg's?

   Sure: display (part of the ImageMagick package).

   I've been trying to search the gimp mail list archives (and subscribe to
the list), but firefox has been unable to load web pages since about 6:45
this morning. Suddenly stopped. Opera seems to be working OK. Different host
from the GIMP problem.

   This problem is fixed: killed firefox and restarted it. I guess it became
constipated and needed help in moving again.

   Actually, I figured out that it was a bad certificate at berkeley.edu that
caused it to hang. There was a modal window hidden behind the firefox window
and everything froze until I told the modal dialog box what I wanted to do
about that certificate.

Subject: [PLUG] Unknown Document File Types
Message-ID: <430DF471.2040500@comcast.net>

I have a set of files from a Mac using friend, who isn't very 
sophisticated around computers. He composed this set of files a number 
of years ago -- well before OS-X -- and doesn't remember what word 
processor he was using at the time. It appears that there are several 
different file types involved, so he probably used different word 
processors at different times.

Is there a Linux tool available that will identify what was used to 
create a document? As I look at them with Konqueror's file browser, some 
of them are described as text files, some are described as troff files, 
and the rest are described as unknown.

The ones identified as text files do open as text files with Kate, but 
the text is obviously not correct. An example is:

W?walke?alon?tree-line?ban? o?th?Ca?Rive?a?sunset

The ones labeled troff files open with Kate and display some text as 
well as some graphic characters, like a rectangular box, sometimes 
solid, sometimes just an outline, etc. Some of the ones described as 
unknown type by Konqueror open with Kate and display normal text for the 
most part, but some display mostly rectangular boxes.

That very much reminds me of the old Word Star format, where the high  
order bit of the last character of each word was set, thereby  
allowing a very rudimentary justification algorithm to just stuff in  
spaces to fill out the line. I /suspect/ that anything capable of  
reading & translating Word Star files could handle this.

But I've been wrong before.

One of the best ways I've found is to use MS Word on Windows - it will 
often retrieve more file types than konq, OO, WP, etc.  I'd try OO first 
though.

Sometimes the "file" command is sufficient to figure it out, have you
tried that?

Subject: [PLUG] Any idea if/when Opteron 246 with stepping E available?
Message-ID: <430DF781.9050207@TemporalArts.com>

I am putting together an Opteron system using the Supermicro H8DCE board.

I planned to use (2) Opteron 246's now and, hopefully, upgrade to 
dual-core Opterons
if/when the prices came down out of the stratosphere.

I have heard, and found it reasonable, to get the E stepping Opterons 
(90nm, 1000Mhz HT, SSE3, cooler, etc.)

I have found, however, that E stepping 246's have been available but 
everyone is currently out-of-stock.

Does anyone know when/where Opteron 244 or 246 E4+ will again be available?

Thanks

That makes sense. I think some of these files date to the 1980's. I used 
to have a copy of Word Star around. I'll have to look and see if it's 
still in the bottom of a drawer, although it's probably on 5-1/4" 
diskettes, and I don't think the last 5-1/4" drive I have is working, 
anymore.

I tried OO. It didn't do any better than Kate. At your recommendation, I 
also tried Word 97, but with the same results. My wife has ConvertPlus, 
which is from Word Perfect 5.1 days. It doesn't recognize the file 
either, and that one I would have expected to be able to see a Word Star 
file.

I didn't know about that program! Thanks for recommending it. 
Unfortunately, it reports that each of those files is a "data" file, so 
it's not all that helpful.

Thanks to all for all the ideas. Looks like Word Star is the best 
possibility at this time. I guess I'll go looking for a Word Star reader 
of some sort.

It'd be interesting to see what "file" says about them.  But I'll bet
they're in MacWrite and/or AppleWorks (same thing?) format.

If my aging memory serves, Mac OS saves the identity of the
application used to create a file, and the actual file type in a
"resource" fork that is essentially a part of the file completely
separate from the data. If you copy a Mac OS file onto a file system
that doesn't understand the HFS "binary" file layout, the resource
fork and all its meta-data are lost. At that point, you'll just have
to use trial and error to figure out which app made the file.

Your best bet would be to find someone with an older Macintosh and an
array of popular Mac OS word processors from back in the old days.
Call up your local elementary school. They're likely to have an old
Mac or two still in service. It's also possible that contemporary OS X
word processing apps might be able to deal with the mystery files.

That's a possibility. I'll ask him if he remembers ever using either of 
them.

Yikes. That prose doesn't read as well as it typed. Trying again:

Mac OS files traditionally have two separate "forks", a data fork, and
a resource fork. The resource fork is used to store meta-data and such
about the file, and this includes a reference to both the application
that created the file (the "creator" resource) and the file's "type"
(word processing document, spreadsheet, etc.). If you copy that Mac OS
file from the native HFS file system to any of the usual Unix/DOS file
systems without taking special precautions, then the resource fork and
all its meta-data will be lost.

Then, I should be able to have my friend look at the files on his Mac 
and figure out that info (assuming he can understand what I'm asking of 
him). He's in Texas, so it's all being done by e-mail.

This is very old knowledge for me, but as I recall I used to use a
package called ResEdit to open up the file and see what type or Creator
Code the file thought it was. It's a bit dangerous, so if he plays with
it, make sure he's working on a backup copy of the file.

He can get ResEdit here:

It might not be that simple. If he doesn't have the original
application installed, the Finder may just show the file as an unknown
type. If memory serves, the "classic" Finder doesn't show the raw
creator and type values. You need a special utility for that. Have him
take a look at FileTyper:

<http://dazuma.freeshell.org/filetyper/>

It's a drag-n-drop app, so it should be straightforward to use. Once
he figures out the creator and type codes, you'll need to determine
what they actually mean. Sometimes it's obvious, but often not (both
codes are only four bytes, so some creativity was occasionally
necessary to maintain uniqueness).

I have learned from my friend that he does indeed know that the files 
were created with WordStar. I've found some useful information at 
http://www.wordstar.org and will have a go with that.

Thanks for all the ideas.

Mark,

   Thank you, that's exactly what it was. How that library went missing on
that box is beyond my knowledge. But, that was the missing file. It did not
fix the missing .hrz or .ico filetypes, but those won't be missed at all.

I think the linux disk editor will do that.  I couldn't get it to do it

I think debugfs will tell you that; it seems to be able to tell you
pretty much everything else you rarely need to know...

Here's how I managed to do it:

 a) I had a list of device sectors from /var/log/messages;

 b) from /sbin/fdisk, changing units to sectors, I got the sector
    offset of /dev/hdc3 and filesystem size in sectors

 c) /sbin/e2fsck -n -v /dev/hdc3 gave me the filesystem size in
    blocks, which let me deduce the block-size, which gave me a way to
    translate from /dev/hdc sector numbers to filesystem block
    numbers;

 d) from /sbin/debugfs, I used the icheck command with the list of
    block numbers, which gave me one consistent inode;

 e) also in /sbin/debugfs I used the ncheck command to list pathnames
    that point at the inode.

Turns out it was a kernel source tarball, which is easily replaced.

Russell:

Most disk forensics programs will do this.  Since the disk is damaged
you'll need to use "dd" with a couple options as described here:

http://www.forensicfocus.com/index.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=29

Summary:

dd if=/dev/broken-disk-device of=broken-disk.img conv=noerror,sync

A good forensics package is The Sleuth Kit:

http://www.sleuthkit.org/

This will operate on the "dd"-ed image of your disk and let you dig
around through the mess to attempt file recovery without putting the
original at risk.

If all you need to do is extract the text, you can try running
"strings" on the file and see if you get anything useful.

Verizon seems to be blocking mail from the list for some reason,
possibly due to a lack of SPF records (and possibly due to being hosted
on a DSL connection).  I'll put SPF records in place and see if that
helps.  In the meantime, anyone want a Gmail invitation?

Is it a static IP?  If so, that puts a damper on my future mailserver 
plans.  I mean, I've heard of blacklisting blocks of dynamic IP's 
but...

Eric,

   I don't know if this information is pertinent, but Verizon is my TelCo, and
I have a DSL connection to them as well as a static IP address for my
domains. I run my own MTA here and have had no problems. A year or so ago I
had my ISP add an SPF record to their DNS servers.

Yes, it is static.  Their rejection notices are quite vague about
exactly why they're blocking it.

Subject: [PLUG] Problems using USB to serial adapter
Message-ID: <20050830174306.GI27745@dalsemi.com>

Normally, when I have hardware problems in Linux, it's because the
device isn't supported.  I seem to have moved on to a new stage.

At work, we use a serial device to communicate with the chips we
design.  Since my laptop doesn't have a serial port, I bought
a USB to serial adapter, based on the Prolific PL2303 chipset.

The USB adapter seems to be dropping bytes.  For example,
when I send this sequence of bytes (character codes):

23,69,91,15,145

I should get back:

22,68,90,0,147

However, through the USB adapter it will usually drop 1 or 2 of
the beginning bytes:

68,90,0,147

90,0,147

This same setup works fine on a box with a dedicated serial port.

I've tried googling, and am searching through the 1004 results,
but so far I haven't come across anything that looks remotely
similar to what I see.

Has anyone on the list used one of these things, or have suggestions
for debugging further?

Thanks,
Colin

I was recently trolling through Mandriva's bug reports looking for 
why my hardware SCSI devices aren't recognized anymore (upgraded 
distribution version) and I found a note that USB2 isn't well 
supported for kernel versions < 2.6.11.  I'm not sure if that's true 
or not.  Just FYI and complete with a $$ back guarantee.  ;-)

Cheers....

P.S.:	Hi Colin.  Go Beav's.

mail is listed in cbl.abuseat.org and that it's an open relay.

It's not like my setup isn't working. Postfix is rejecting over 50% of 
the attempted email deliveries per day. I look through the output of 
postfixlogsum daily, and see hundreds of rejections, including many that 
are rejected using cbl.abuseat.org..

So I'm really confused now.

Any ideas out there?

I probably have no useful information to offer but I did get a Belkin brand 
USB to DB9 cable last week at CompUSA and used it with my Garmin GPS. I had 
to install a driver under WinXP to get it working and it worked fine to allow 
me to upgrade the firmware and internal map using Garmin's update programs.

Under SuSE 9.2 it appears that the cable is supported as the cable was 
detected when I plugged it in to a USB port on my laptop. I changed my GPS to 
output NEMA data and I was able to use "gpsdrive" under Linux and it was able 
to receive the data that my GPS was sending out. The GPS appears to only 
support 4800 bps so I'm not doing any high speed data transfers under Linux.

One thing I do notice is that the "setserial" program doesn't work with 
USB-serial ports so I don't know how I check the speed and flow control under 
Linux with this cable. The cable is mapped to /dev/ttyUSB0.

That should be NMEA (as in "National Marine Electronics Association").
NEMA is something different (apparently "National Electrical
Manufacturers Association").

Subject: [PLUG] 15Mb Access
Message-ID: <20050831184037.54802136AC@mail.silverflash.net>

I'm now the proud user of a fiber optic line to my house providing 15Mb/sec
of Internet wonders and mysteries ... except that I can't get 15Mb out of
it.  The technician only knew Windows, so we tested the line with a Windows
box.  It initially measured out at about 5Mb, which he said is typical for
an untuned system.  We then went to speedguide.net, which through the
miracle of Active-X (as I recall) retuned my TCP stack and the box then
measured out at 15Mb.

But, of course, I don't used a Windows firewall.  When I run tests from my
Linux firewall, it tests out at 5Mb again.  My initial research lead me to
RWIN aka RecvWin apparently aka /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default and
rmem_max.  I set these up to 513920, a number recommended by speedguide.net,
but subsequent tests showed no change.  Speedguide.net still reports RWIN is
5840.  Firefox's bandwidth tester extension confirms that I'm still at
~5Mb/sec.

My question to the collective experience and knowledge of PLUG is: what do I
need to tune on Linux to use the full capability of my line?

Nothing.. you're not using Gigabit..

But how are you testing? Don't use those bandwidth speed sites.. they 
aren't even well enough connected to test 6Mb/s cable..

I'm curious how fast you can download from here: http://unix.schluting.com

How about the DSL-HOWTO from LDP?  They have a section on performance
tuning, since each broadband connection is a little different:

I got (trying to remember) an Adaptec DuoConnect a few (??) years ago.
Works fine, except on really old PCI buses (circa 1995) where the box
wouldn't boot with the thing plugged.

At first glance, I don't see any reason why this connection should be
so slow. Think of it this way: what kind of thruput would you expect from
a 10 Mbit Ethernet connection before tweaking?

But more to your problem, Brian. What's on the other end? Based on your
test with a Winderz box, it doesn't seem likely that the bottleneck's
there -- but it might be some cheap-ass switch that's designed to work
best with that other OS.

What network card are you using with this fiber line? Did the driver
come pre-compiled from your ISP, or did you compile it for your system?
When I did testing at Intel, most of their drivers accepted flags when
insmoded that would tune the performance, & maybe this card needs some
special setting to work with the equipment at the other end. (And I
know that you're bright enough to take this clue & use it in other
obvious ways of troubleshooting. I won't insult your intelligence
by naming them.)

I'd suggest that you try to connect this to an identical card & see
if, with no other changes you can't get 15Mb thruput -- but from the
sounds of things, this might just be some odd specialized (as in
paying lots of money for less benefits) NIC, & there's no sense in
spending that kind of dough just to learn that 5Mb may be all that
the card currently is capable of doing under Linux.

Post any interesting results, & one of us will have more ideas.

Hi:

I have a problem and want to see if anyone on the list has dealt with it 
before.

I have AMD based motherboard that I just noticed there are new BIOS update
available from the manufacturer.  The problem is the update is a Window/DOS
exe file.  So does that mean I won't be able to update my BIOS since I am 
running
Linux on this box?

Thanks for any tip.

I think you were on the right track with the TCP window size tuning,
however only tuning the receive side isn't helpful if you're the one
initiating the TCP connection.

This site offers some excellent advice on tuning the send buffers and
even describes why this is sometimes necessary:

Unless you want to venture into using MTDtools (which varies from easy to 
impossible, depending on MB/bios/kernel/distro), you can just create a 
bootable DOS floppy and use their dos tools and image to do it.

One thing that sometimes needs to be tweaked with broadband connections
it the MTU size; I don't know exactly how this connection is delivered
to you, but that is one variable that might need to be tuned.

.. we're only talking 15Mb/s. Default MTU (btw, MTU doesn't matter.. the 
other end probably won't talk to you past the default size anyways) is 
enough, default Linux TCP windows are enough..
You can transfer > 15Mb/s on your LAN without tweaking right?

The site I mentioned in my earlier E-mail discusses why TCP windows
that work great on a local LAN may not work so well on longer distance
connections.  (see the "bandwidth-delay product" section)

http://web.archive.org/web/20041105011210/http://www.psc.edu/networking/projects/tcptune/

Basically the buffers need to be big enough to contain all the data
"in flight".  The faster the data gets to its destination, the smaller
the buffers can be.  On a local LAN, data gets to its destination
quite fast, so these buffers can be very small without affecting
throughput.

But we're not talking about a LAN; we're talking about broadband that
happens to terminate in some piece of routing or bridging equipment that
offers Ethernet on the customer-facing side.  Broadband tends to get
encapsulated and aggregated at layer 2 using things like PPPoE, ATM,
etc.  I'm not talking tuning the kernel itself for handling high
bandwidth; I'm talking about tuning the kernel to operate as efficiently
with the adjoining layer 2 infrastructure.  Here are some resources:

1) Make sure there are no problems w/ Duplex Mismatch with the NIC on your
firewall and your switch /router.

2) Test Your Firewall Locally against another system on your lan, using
NFS preferably, to verify that you can get that amount of throughput
bi-directionally over ethernet. This little sanity check might save you a
lot of grief.

3) If you can get that amount of throughput on a LAN, but not on the WAN,
I would test against an FTP server on the int4rweb while running tcpdump.

I'm assuming that you're running the tests directly from the firewall, and
not from clients behind the firewall.  If that is not the case, let me
know.

      currently building using UMN MapServer.  Topics will include:

          -  Overview of a few GIS concepts
             Why GIS is different than other graphics.
             Why Web mapping is different than other web applications.

          -  Overview of UMN MapServer
             What it will do and what it won't do.
             Brief discussion of alternative products.

          -  A quick look at the site David Mandel is currently working on.
             It is definitely a work in progress, but already has some
             interesting features.

With DSL/Cable modem, they usually don't like you running
services like sshd, web site etc.. that would allow incoming
traffic.

Is Verizon FIOS also take the same stance?  Or they really
don't care?    Can I run sshd and copy files back home
from work?  (Assuming I will install a proper firewall) Just curious.
