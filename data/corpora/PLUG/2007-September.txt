The Goodwill in Corvallis also has one 678 and one 675, but no power
adapters so you can't even test if they come on. They are $8 each.
If you want I can pick them up for you.

I have a 675 *with* adapter, free for the taking... did they use the  
same power adapters as the 678's?

I  have owned both and I am nearly sure they use the  same power adapter.

I can confirm that they do use the same power adapter.

Subject: [PLUG] swap: when to worry
Message-ID: <46DD2E4B.2080607@subtend.net>

I have a postgres server with 4GB of ram.

Let us begin with the numbers:

             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       4049552    4021932      27620          0      11420    1798880
-/+ buffers/cache:    2211632    1837920
Swap:      4194296    1125168    3069128


This box was built less than 48 hours ago, and is in heavy use.  Over these two
days swap has climbed towards 1GB.

I know panicking over swap usage is not as easy today as 2.6 likes to swap out
idle pages over time.  I'm curious how one decides swap is doing too much,
especially in this case where disk IO is the main bottleneck of a db server.
Data seems to be going into swap, but not out.

Also, what are people's opinion on a ramdisk swap drive?  I know, odd, but some
high-end sites use large ram disk arrays.  I feel running no-swap is dangerous
to the kernel (and OOM risk), so this would allow an all RAM based VM.  I would
probably throw in another 4GB of RAM if I attempted to do this.

Some vmstat (5s intervals):

1. I think you're misinterpreting vmstat. "si" is swap in --
specifically, pages read from swap per second. "so" is swap out -- pages
written to swap per second". The first thing I'd do is make sure you
have the correct versions of the packages "sysstat", "procps" and
"psmisc" for your kernel. By the way, which distro is it?

2. If you look at the "swpd" column, you'll see that it is decreasing.
That's consistent with all swap in and no swap out. What that means is
that at some point, the system *was* writing to swap, but is now reading
back what it wrote.

3. At this point I don't think you have a problem. As far as "in-RAM"
swap, there isn't any need to add swap space of any kind as long as you
are only 1/4 full.

I'd recommend the "Swordfish Book" -- "System Performance Tuning, 2nd
Edition" (O'Reilly System Administration -- Paperback). That will give
you a systematic way of managing Linux resources, and as a bonus, will
give you the same thing for Solaris and other Unix-like systems.

Steve,

I think you are refering to my problems with KDE and KNetMgr.  I have no 
troubles with the wireless in my laptop using Gnome.  The Gnome network 
manager works flawlessly.
On the other hand. I have not enjoyed the same success with KDE.  My 
machine has both environments installed and I was hoping to be able to 
switch back and forth (go ahead and flame me guys...bloatware).  I have 
since discovered that I can install the KDE apps that I wanted and they 
install the dependencies and work just fine under Gnome.  My display is 
doing the Toshiba slow death with the band down the middle of the 
screen, so I am not using it much, and am waiting for finances to 
replace it.

Good luck,

Bruce

I'd agree with Ed's assessment that you are likely OK, as well as his
endorsement of "The swordfish" book. I've only read a small part of it, but
nearly every word has been valuable.

Also, be aware that you can tune the "swappiness" of the 2.6 kernel. It will
likely do little to change the performance on the system, unless you use
really out-there settings which will likely have a negative effect, but it
will likely change the stats so that they look more like what you are
expecting to see. A discussion on swappiness tuning from Kerneltrap can be
seen at http://kerneltrap.org/node/3000 . Again The value of changing this
setting is somewhat debatable. I would think it would have the most value in
"adjusting" the numbers you are seeing in your various statistics programs
and making them more meaningful to you.

A rule of thumb that I use that has served me well is that I only worry
about RAM on a machine if all of the following are true:

1- Free RAM is approaching zero and RAM used as buffer / cache is
approaching zero
2- Swap use is > 25% of physical RAM
3- "Too many" processes are in IO wait. (The value of "too many" varies
widely from machine to machine.)

In your case, only 2 true as far as I can tell, and there is (usually) only
a visible performance hit when 3 becomes true. By that point it becomes
painfully obvious that you need more RAM.

As far as your comment on using RAM disks for swap, I wouldn't recommend it
given my (limited) understanding of how VM management in Linux works
currently. It seems that using the RAM that way would be more expensive than
just using it as RAM cache / buffer space directly. If you are proposing
that out of concern about IO load when swapping, I would think it would pay
larger dividends to put your swap space on a device separate from your
system and data drives. That way swap IO will not get in the way of DB or
system IO. If one were to go down this path, you might consider a device
like Gigabyte's iRAM for creating an inexpensive SSD.

Why not approach a 501c3 with a similar agenda and have them "sponsor"
your booth?  The Swarm Development Group <http://swarm.org> might be
interested.

      Ray has started and ran a number of tech businesses starting
      with Semaphore which he started as a student at MIT in 1984
      and SnapNames which he co-founded in 2000.  Following the
      success of SnapNames, Ray became interested in wiki technology,
      and has started a number of wikis.  The most notable of
      these is aboutus.org which is a wiki about web sites.
      Aboutus.org is quite popular.  Some internet rating services
      put it into the 2000 most hit sites on the Internet.

(Oops. This time the rest of the e-mail...)

Still need a 678?  Have been following this thread and telling myself
I should go find / dust off the one I've had in storage -- somewhere.
Tonight I found it!  Have the original serial cable and power adapter,
too.

Also found some DSL noise filters.  One of them is a hard-to-find
4-wire (if you have two lines coming out of one jack, you'll know why
it's so special).

Have to say, it's going to feel like giving away a favorite, rare book
or something.  Too bad I can't use it any more.  Has been a very
versatile, reliable router.

Well, Ed can have it if he still needs it as he asked first.  But if 
he's already got one I would still like one myself and have been looking 
locally when time permits.

Subject: [PLUG] Victor is going through the book Linux System Administration
Message-ID: <498756ed0709042228l46173e0jecb28bec2b69941b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am going through the book Linux System Administration published by
Oreilly.  It basically holds your hand as you set up DNS, LAMP, et.
al.  The book assumes you have a static IP address.  ( I've already
made use of dynamic DNS option, but I've had to RTFM the internet too
much to try to get it working, so I want to go through the hand
holding Oreilly book.  )

I currently have a residential account with Comcast which comes with a
Dynamic IP address.  They will not sell me, or give me a static IP
address, unless I get a business account.  I can't get DSL in S.E.
Portland where I live.  Comcast, seems to me, my only option.

To get a business account they want to charge me about 50 bucks a
month to get the static ip address, and I have to sign a one year
contract.  I don't know if I will be able to understand this linuxy
stuff, so I don't want to commit to a one year contract, so they said
I would not have to be under contract if I paid 150 bucks a month.
That's bogus, but that's not my main issue.

My high spped internet connection through my residential account with
Comcast works with a D-link cable modem that a friend gave me.  A
technical support guy from the business side of Comcast said I needed
a special modem, a SMC Gateway.  Is that true?  I thought I could just
use my existing modem, get a business account from Comcast, get a
static IP address, modify the appropriate file in Debian, and be on my
way.

Also, the business salesperson from Comcast said that there is a 250
dollar installation fee.  I have sticker shock at that.  Again, is

Victor they are blowing smoke up your proverbial .. well you get the idea.
There should be no need to get a special device other then what you already
have as the service is no different then from you currently get sans the
static IP address and support if something breaks. Your best bet is just to
be armed with knowledge best you can and haggle with a sales drone until you
get what you want.

Best of Luck,

There are other ways to get around the static IP address thing.  noip.com and
dyndns.com both have options to serve up a name to IP address mapping where
the IP address is not constant.

Also, equipment is not an issue.  If you are doing a business account,
they them that
you have your own equipment and IT support people; have them just give
you the details
of IP netmask gateway ip upstream DNS, MX mail relay and any other
info needed to
use the services.  With just the first three pieces of info and
opendns as the upstream
DNS server you should be able to do anything outbound you want.
Checking back in
on the static IP is a little harder as you will need an account
somewhere else to make
the connections.

The ifconfig command will do it for free.  Of course, if you're on the 
internet and somebody else owns that address, they may very well show 
up at your door without any beer.

A routable static IP address will cost you, but if you just want to play 
with Linux and static IP's, setup a couple of computers on an ethernet 
switch.

no, comcast doesn't know how to run their business side and won't 
provision static ip's via docsis or by dhcp with static leases on your 
modem .  they provision it by hand on the physical modem for their 
business service.

you can either get a smc (which the install cost is designed to 
deferrer), or pick up your own cisco ubr modem.

but in general, you don't NEED a static ip address.  even using a 
dynamic address - you can connect into the system.  try typing in your 
address into your address bar, and it should work provided your machine 
is running apache.

using something a-la dyndns (http://www.dyndns.com/services/dns/) might 
be a better option - so you can type in mycomputer101.dyndns.org and 
connect to your machine.  in fact, most dynamic ip address lease times 
for comcast are 1 day, and if your computer/router actively requests it, 
you will probably end up using the same address for more than a few 
months.  some people even think this is a "static" address, alto it is 
subject to change at the whim of their cmts in the headend.

Assuming you've got your IP addresses handed out by your
gateway/router device, you could either set up a reservation by MAC
address so you don't have to worry about your local IP changing, or
set up an alias for the ethernet device.

Easier, assuming you've using a standard ethernet device, setting up
an alias (which just gives you another IP on the same physical NIC) is
as simple as:

  # ifconfig eth0:0 192.x.x.x

Added bonus: neither of these will open your system up to the net more
than "normal", vs. creating a routeable static IP on the box providing
services you're testing.

Looking at it that way.  You are right.  For learning or playing around.
 Just set up your computers on a switch using
your own static IP addresses.  Your router won't care if you don't
talk to it.  Just
don't try to route your chosen static IP addresses out to the Internet.
IP addresses in the 10.x.x.x range should get dropped at the first
router outside of
your network.

If you need to learn about routing then you could still do the same
and learn about NAT
at the same time.

Just work quickly. A dynamic ip is just a static ip that changes
occasionally (well they probably don't let you adjust the reverse DNS PTR
record). Everydns.net  allows you to setup free DNS accounts for dynamic
ips. Then you just run a small script they provide to update the nameserver
whenever comcast changes your ip.

T-1 (and fractional portions thereof) goes everywhere. It's rock  
solid reliable (unlike comcast). This is because it's been regulated,  
and built-out, for stability and reliability, to death (unlike comcast).

It's also spendy.

This is deter heavy traffic users from saturating cable, which is a  
shared-wire network.... a decent hosting company is often much cheaper.

This is to deter fly-by-night spammer operations.

$750 a month (A decent, full, T-1) for guaranteed connectivity is  
pretty reasonable for a business making over a 100K a year. Below  
that, there's fractional T-1, Comcast cable (totally spotty, but fast  
when it works), ISDN (not spotty, but slow and spendy), and of  
course, the dedicated 56K wire.

Or you could just host at a place *designed* to host sites.

Perhaps. Comcast activates and transmits to accounts based on MAC  
addresses, which are vendor (SMC, D-Link, Cisco, etc.) specific....  
*but* if you had a router that could *emulate* the SMC feature set,  
*and* used an SMC MAC address, you might be able to use something else.

Yeahbutno. The internet 10 years ago, yes, but that was before CIDR,  
zombie clusters, ISP proxies-from-hell, and porn/span/torrent traffic  
saturating the links.

> Also, the business salesperson from Comcast said that there is a 250

lol, you must be young-ish. I once paid over 4K for a 10Mb hard  
drive, and at one point in time, had the sublime pleasure of solo  
operating a machine with 100 *thousand* dollars worth of ram, CPU,  
and disk (it had 512Mb of RAM, and dual 486's, and a whole *gigabyte*  
of hard disk!). I still have some of the many video cards on my wall,  
there must have been 20-30 of 'em....

Anyways, in modern terms, yes, basically, for *business grade  
service*, it may take 5-10 people-hours, at 25 dollars an hour... so,  
ten hours to get (and keep) your system working right, so, $250  
sounds decent.

I would like to use my Hyundai Elantra for long haul trucking, can I  
just attach a hitch?
I would like to teach brain surgery, can I just use my boy-scout  
first-aid merit badge?
I would like to run my business through a cheap POS pseudo-router to  
a network that doesn't even do decent BGP, and do I mind having 3-8  
day total outages?

You are not paying, in all actuality, a fee for what you use on  
Comcast. You are paying for them to get (and keep) their shit  
together for reliable service.

A VPS/VDS/(etc.) "server" at a hosting company. Get your own root,  
IP, play away.

I ran into a very strange network problem. I was setting up a wireless
bridge (I don't think the "wireless" part is important), so there is
what I have:

Wireless bridge - 192.168.1.37
Bridge is connected to a switch, into the switch I plug these:
PC - 192.168.1.16
Tivo - 192.168.1.25
Laptop - 192.168.1.241

>From the laptop, I can ping PC, Tivo, and the bridge, so everything on

>From the PC, I can ping laptop and Tivo but not bridge. The difference
seems to be in arp requests. When I ping bridge from laptop, tcpdump
shows this:

arp who-has 192.168.1.37 tell 192.168.1.241
arp reply 192.168.1.37 is-at 00:18:02:74:94:35

When I ping bridge from PC, tcpdump shows repeated who-has line but
the reply never comes.

They are all connected into the same switch (wired), they are all on
the same net, they use the same network and mask
192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0, why one works and one doesn't?

Maybe there is something wrong with the switch between the bridge and the pc
so the bridge is not getting the arp who-has. Try moving things around on
the switch.

I already replaced the switch, makes no difference.

Client bridging over wireless is *screwy*.  It requires various
"tricks" to work.  When I started, I expected wireless bridging to
work like ethernet bridging and couldn't understand why it didn't.
Reality finally taught me.  What it boils down to is, either your
wireless needs to use WDS mode or it needs to do proxyarp (I've never
tried this personally), or your device routes instead of bridges.

The basic reason it doesn't work is that normal master-client mode
802.11 uses three mac addresses when four are required to bridge
completely.  WDS mode uses four.  Proxyarp papers over the problem.

When I need to bridge over wireless, I use WDS and it works fine for me.

I tried switching the wireless bridge into WDS mode, it does not
associate with the access point :( It works fine when it's in "AP
client" mode, but then I get these strange issues that on the wired
segment behind the "AP client" some hosts can't see each other.

That O'Reilly book is very good.  However, you want to track down
a copy of Peter Harrison's "Linux Quick Fix Notebook" from Prentiss
Hall's Bruce Perens series.  This is the re-titled "Linux Home
Networking" book that Peter used to sell online.  There is a lot
of good stuff in there about setting up SOHO networks.  You also
want to have a copy of Carla Schroeder's "Linux Cookbook", which is
great for solving individual problems .  With all three books, and
some experience, you will be ready for many if the issues that arise.

You can buy a new cable modem from anywhere, if it is recent and
on the Comcast approved list.  You don't need their hardware, but
there is no problem using theirs if it is cheap and dumb and
doesn't do too much (== blocks access for something else).

Old laptops (the $100 Craig's list kind) make great firewall
routers.  A >150MHz >100Mb machine is plenty, and cosmetics,
portability, and minor display defects don't matter.  Make sure
that it has either 2 PCMCIA slots, or one slot and built-in 
ethernet, and put one or two ethernet PCMCIA cards in there.
That gives you low power, battery backup, and a display that
runs when the wall power goes away.  Comcast will want to talk
to a single machine with a non-changing MAC address;  I use a
PCMCIA ethernet card so I can move it from machine to machine
if necessary.  In my case, I use the ethernet half of a cheap
old 3Com 3CCFEM556B card, almost any non-cardbus 16 bit PCMCIA
card will work in almost any laptop.

There are two options to get the EQUIVALENT of a static IP address,
without buying the premium Comcast service.

1)  Set up your external DNS with an organization like dyndns.com .
That is designed to issue domain lookups with very short Time To Live
(TTL) information.  On your machine, you run a program (I forget
which, but there are many) which keeps track of the dynamic IP
address assigned to you, and informs the server at dyndns if there
is a change.  I've seen the address change 4 times in as many years,
so there is only a brief time when your IP address is wrong (a
minute or so for the changeover to propagate through the DNS system).
Comcast outages can be hours, and are much more frequent.

The real problem with using a server on Comcast is that they can
(and sometimes do) block ports, and they are entitled to NAT you
and provide you with non-routable IP addresses.  You can still 
surf the web, but you can't run any incoming services, even
bittorrent.  So, after you get everything running with your
firewall router, you want to move to alternative plan B:

2)  Set up an offsite virtual server at a place like Rimuhosting
or Linode .  These cost $20/month, and are on the backbone so
they are plenty fast (I have 100MB/s to mine, the facility is
10GB/s).  This is a virtual machine (behaves much like a limited
but real computer) that runs Linux, has one or more real IP
addresses, and runs your outwards facing web server, mail transport
agent, etc.  You get to it from your home router on Comcast using
a virtual private network;  I use the OpenVPN program for this. 
This way, Comcast could give you a nonroutable IP and block all
inbound ports, and you still have full connectivity up the VPN. 
See the slides for my presentation on offsite virtual servers at
http://www.keithl.com/offsite.html   for more information.  


Servers and outwards facing services are what Linux does best.
It is good to play with this stuff - it helps you understand
a lot of the design decisions that make Linux less optimized
for the desktop (though it is still very good for that).  It
is also the best way to give back to the community that helps
you - share your experiences with the world, and it will be a
little easier for the next person that comes along!

Have fun!

Your specific situation might be different than what I've seen before,
but it boils down to "it wasn't designed to do this" and "the tricks
that allow it to work can result in non-intuitive behavior".

If you do WDS, the access point needs to be in WDS mode too and they
need to "peer" with each other.  That often (but not always) requires
that you configure the BSSID (think macaddr) of the other wireless
device on each end.  Your devices may or may not support WDS in a
mutually compatible way.  

Because of complexities in the way wireless works, wireless
acknowledgements can confuse bridges about where hosts live.  It gets
complex really fast.  I don't know what your specific problem is, but
I have never had satisfactory success with "client bridging".  I have
had success with linux wireless devices (Pebble/Pyramid on x86,
OpenWrt on broadcom, i.e. where I had intimate control of how they
were configured) and WDS.

I second this.  I use Slicehost[1] and they are great.  Their cheapest 
virtual server is $20 a month and you get full root access.  Nice thing 
about most virtual servers is that if you mess them up bad you can 
revert the install and start over.

Back when I had Comcast, my IP wouldn't change for almost 2 years.  Once 
your set up and get your dynamic IP, just assign those setting 
statically and see how long they last.  It might suprise you.  And if 
your internet suddenly doesn't work one day, switch back over to DHCP 
for the new address then assign statically the new info.

Possibly.  What's the biz connection rated at?  I know some Comcast 
connections are beyond 10MB now, and older modems cannot reach some of 
the higher speeds.  There should be no reason you need a special Comcast 
modem, but the speed could be the issue.

I've only worked with one wireless bridge device, so this may not be true in
your case, but the one I worked with did all sorts of weird stuff ARP
related stuff to make "AP client mode" work. As Russell mentioned, I've only
ever gotten satisfactory results out of them when using WDS.

Ok, so the conclusion seems to be that if I put the bridge into "AP
client" mode, I can have only one computer connected to it, not two.
This appears to be consistent with the observations: one of the three
computers on the switch behind the bridge will work, the other two
won't, and if I powercycle the bridge then the different one may start
working (but the other one will stop working).

Try switching the wires around in the ports and see if things change.  You 
might have a damaged switch.

I have mplayer and xine plugins installed in Firefox, and they mostly

If I save this file to disk, both mplayer and xine play it.
about:plugins shows that asf is one of supported extensions. And yet,
Firefox does not even try to open this with a plugin, just renders it

Any ideas why?

Yes.  If the wireless client is something hackable like a Linksys
WRT54GL or the like, you can reflash with OpenWrt or similar and set
it up as a NAT'ing client too.  That will work for more than one
device, but then it isn't bridging (if you really need bridging).  To
do "wireless bridging" for more than one device, you really want WDS,
I think.

For a little more detail, for full-generality bridging you need 4 mac
addresses (they have official names, which i've forgotten and am too
lazy to look up, and also I am doing this from memory and may have
some of it slightly wrong, so bear with me and checkup on the details
if it matters to you):

  SRC
  DEST
  STA
  AP

SRC and DEST are the normal ethernet mac addresses.  STA and AP are
the mac addresses of the wireless devices (STA being the client, AP
being the master-mode device).  In master/client mode only three are
used, SRC and STA being conflated.  So, from the master side, when
someone wants to send a packet back, all it has is the STA mac addr
and not the mac addr on the other side of the client bridge.  It can
work with one device by assuming that the packets are for that device
and passing it along.  In WDS, all four mac addrs are used, so
bridging works.

Heck, 150 MHz is luxury. I just retired an ancient Dell P100 laptop
which had served admirably as my router for several years. Hardware
that old can often be found for free.

Comcast doesn't block anything out here in Hillsboro, and the IP
addresses they assign are perfectly routable.  At least, that's what
I've been told.

it's not as electically light, but I've been buying old sun u1 boxes,
dropping 4 port ethernet cards in them and turning them into
firewall/routers/openvpn servers.

I've picked up u1 for free - $15.00 and the 4 port ethernet cards for $7.50.

These make great routers, with a console port for installation to boot.

Debian supports sparc for the OS.  Shorewall is a very flexible IP
tables tool as well.

I'd guess that the web server is reporting the mime-type incorrectly,
but I'm not sure how to check this.  It seems like wget should have a
--report-mime-type flag, or something, but I don't see such a tool.

Is it possible to configure firefox, or one of the plugins like
mozplugger to go by extension alone and disregard mime-type? The same
page works fine under Windows, so that's probably what IE is doing.

The MIME type is just an HTTP header; there are a number of ways you can
go about getting it from the command line:

lynx -head http://www.atv.ru/video3/0507/dps070507.asf
curl -I http://www.atv.ru/video3/0507/dps070507.asf
wget -O /dev/null -S http://www.atv.ru/video3/0507/dps070507.asf
(CTRL-C immediately to quit downloading)

$ telnet www.atv.ru 80
Trying 194.135.30.97...
Connected to www.atv.ru (194.135.30.97).
Escape character is '^]'.
HEAD /video3/0507/dps070507.asf HTTP/1.1
Host: www.atv.ru
Accept: */*

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 05 Sep 2007 22:41:28 GMT

(netcat 'nc' works also)

If you want to see what a typical HTTP HEAD request looks like, add '-v'
to the curl command above.

Subject: [PLUG] wow, HPLIP scanning is painless
Message-ID: <200709052148.36674.ewilhelm@cpan.org>

On Debian (etch) with an all-in-one HP 3050 laser + scanner, all I had 
to do was click through a few pages in cups and the printer works (of 
course.)

But what really blew me away was how simple the ADF (multi-page) 
scanning was.

  aptitude install hplip sane-utils
  scanimage --batch-count=2

This is awesome given that most ADF scanners are unsupported on Linux 
(or cost an arm+leg and still don't have any linux drivers from the 
manufacturer.)

Go HP!  Wow.  That's all.

Subject: [PLUG] install to external HD, use as internal?
Message-ID: <20070906170457.GD22373@merlot.com>

I want to install Linux (probably Debian, not relevant I think) to an
external disk in my office, then replace the internal drive in a remote
server with this disk (after rsyncing data, of course). 

What do I need to watch out for? If I use labels instead of devices, it
shouldn't matter that the disk is e.g. /dev/sdh as an external (USB)
disk but /dev/sda when it's internal, right? 

I think I've done this before, but I just don't remember all the
mistakes I'm sure I made...

Thanks.

I did this just today, except instead of installing, I was cloning. 
Labels worked great for me.  Three places that needed changing after 
cloning:

- the filesystem(s) -- use tune2fs or e2label
- /etc/fstab
- /boot/grub/menu.lst

Made the changes, installed the drives, worked great.

You can also use UUIDs.  To generate one use uuidgen.

Good luck and let us know how things go.

Aren't those half duplex 10Mb?  I believe the built-in port in the SS10 
I had was.  Anyway, that's a lot of juice for a simple firewall. 
OpenWRT or DDWRT on a linksys router is only ~50.  And you get wireless 
to boot.

Naw they are full duplex 100MB 4port ethernet cards.  This is still cheaper.
Does the linksys offer a remote reboot option through a serial port? 
Can I hook that up to a 56k modem and manage it remotely?  That would be
cool.

Hello Bill,

Sorry for the delay in responding - I've been working.
Yes, please purchase them for me if you can. My son
goes to OSU so I'm there frequently.

No problem with the power adapters - they're clearly
marked and substitutes are easy to get.

I'll take it. I might as well lay in a supply. A few people
I know have intermittent Actiontecs that need replacing.

I have an Actiontec DSL modem and had intermittent DSL access for several
weeks. It turned out not to be the Actiontecs fault  The link would be fine
for several hours at a time, sometimes several days at a time. Then the link
would drop and the modem would try to retrain and would fail or it would
reconnect and drop the link again a few minutes later and would generally
misbehave for several hours at a time. The local phone coop while trying to
locate the problem has replaced almost every connection between the DSL
modem and the remote (which is about 1 mile away). We even changed out the
Actiontec modem for a new Zoom modem which did not fix the problem.
Yesterday I remembered that there was one part of the circuit which had not
been replaced. It was a regular phone line going to another part of the
house which had no phone plugged into it. I had almost no DSL access for
several hours. I plugged a phone into that other line and the DSL synced
immediately and has had no problems for over 8 hours. I log the Signal/Noise
from the modem every minute and it is better than it has been for weeks and
is rock solid. As a test I  unplugged the phone and still everything is
working. So the problem is a bad connection in that seemingly unrelated
phone line. Plugging in the phone just jostled it enough to make it behave.
I will replace that line today, but I am pretty sure that it was the cause
of all my problems.

I had an Actiontec that would drop the circuit about every
48 hours. This happened for about one year. Qwest supplied
the Actiontec when they installed the circuit and they could
not fix the problem. The phone line is a dedicated line; it's
only purpose was for DSL. I personally ran the wire from the
demarc to the Actiontec, so there were no phones and no stray
segments of phone wire hanging off.

Replacing the Actiontec with a Cisco 678 fixed the problem.

I now have a customer with the same problem.

I have a friend who has intermittent DSL problems and he
has an Actiontec but I don't know anything about his phone
line.

So the question is, is there a problem in the circuit that the Cisco 678 is
compensating for, or was the problem actually in the Actiontec. Does the
Cisco 678 show some spike in noise every 48 hours, something which the 678
can handle but which would have disconnected the Actiontec?

If so, it's an event that the Actiontec can't recover from, and I  
can't have that.

Depending on where you live, how old the area is, etc. the "demarc" on your
property may not be the only point that your line is exposed to oddness. For
example, a school I used to work in had a phone closet that was effectively
used as a POP by the phone company. At least a portion of the phone lines
for the neighborhood surrounding the school looped through there, and it was
possible to drop a butt-set on those lines and tap into other people's
lines. Some of these lines were still cross-connected into the cable plant
of the school.

So if you are having problems with your DSL, and there are no stray cables
connected to it on your property, that doesn't guarantee that there are _no_
stray cables connected to it somewhere else.

Also, just for some more data points, I had an Actiontec that was constantly
causing me problems. I too replaced it with a 678, and now everything is
shiny. My housemate works for a local tech consulting company, and they have
at least 30 Actiontecs deployed for customers in Eugene, and very few of
them have had problems. He's of the opinion that the newer Actiontecs
without wireless built in are quite good.

Ok, so the mime-type is "plain text". Is there any way to make Firefox
use extension and ignore mime-type? That's what IE seems to do,

Any image scroller programs out there?

I would like to set up a gnome or KDE window display that
automatically scrolls a strip image vertically (imagine that the
image is many screenfulls high, and designed to stitch at the top
and bottom).  This is called a "hollywood scroll", the way credits
roll smoothly up from the bottom of the frame and off the top. 

This is easy to do with text if you don't mind it being jerky,
just feeding text from a simple program to a properly configured
xterm will do it.  But smooth, with images, is beyond my skills.

Is there anything out there?  Is there a google search term I am missing?

Yes.  There's no documentation on how to do it because it "just works."

If the sata controller supports it, it is just as easy as usb.  Onboard 
controllers may not.  You'll know you got a lemon controller when the 
machine locks up.

>perhaps with some "hdparm" action before and after?

If your controller doesn't hotplug, the 'warmplug' mechanism seems to be 
`scsiadd` -- though you only really get to add it.  I think I managed 
to remove a drive from my junky onboard controller once without the 
machine hanging, but repeated warmplugging seems unstable.

Well, it supports SSH which, IMO, is better then dialing into a device. 
  As for remote reboot, you could reboot it via command line while 
logged in.  But if it's because you're firewall is locking up alot then 
there are bigger problems?

I use late model P3's for firewalls myself.  Like you, but not Sun.  But 
my firewall/gateways generally go beyond basics and into proxy, content 
filtering, and AV scanning.  If I didn't have those needs, the low power 
WRT54G's running OpenWRT or DDWRT would be perfect and inexpensive.

Subject: [PLUG] Resolved: Printing current sheet in OO Calc
Message-ID: <46E36E6F.1070508@comcast.net>

I'm pretty sure I asked this question on this list a couple of months
ago: how do I keep OO-Calc from printing the entire file, instead of the
current sheet?

The answer at the time was to select the sheet, and then print only the
selection (an option in the print dialog).

I learned a better way from the OO mailing list:

> I understand that unless I select an area, the entire file will print
when I click on the printer icon. Is there some way to change this
behavior so that I would have to do something to make the entire file
print? I'd rather have just the page I'm viewing print when I click on
the printer icon. It wastes a lot of paper to print the entire file.

To do this on the fly for a particular case, select the Options.. button
in the Print dialogue box and tick the "Print only selected sheets" box.
 Selected sheets have white, rather than grey, tabs, of course.

But since you seem to want this as your default, go to Tools |
Options... | OpenOffice.org Calc | Print and you will see the same
option.  If you set it here, use the option in the print dialogue to
disable your default in a particular case.

I would like some help getting a couple of things working with VMware. I
have it running Win98SE, but I don't have sound. Sound does work on the
host Linux box (SuSE 10.1).

Also, I have an Epson Perfection 600 scanner that I'd like to get
running, both with Linux tools, and with the Win tools provided with the
scanner. My past experience with this scanner has been that, while I
could get a scan with a Linux tool, I didn't have the level of control
provided by the Win tool.

I haven't been in the DSL world for a while, but it use to be that
Verizon uses a different DSL protocol than Qwest, so a CPE unit for
Qwest won't work for Verizon. The fact that you've got an Actiontech for
CPE, maybe even the same model as the ones for Qwest, doesn't
necessarily mean anything--consider how you can buy the same wireless
phone in flavors for both GSM and CDMA.

It depends on the model and the type of service.  I had to configure one 
by hand once.  There is a way to change the service configuration through 
the console.  It requires knowing what the DSL protocol needs to be set to 
and how to get to the command line on the router.  (I don't know if it can 
be done through the web interface.  It has been a while since I looked at 
that on mine.)  BTW, QWest also uses multiple protocols.  It depends on 
the speed of the service and the type of modem.  (One of the reasons for 
the move to the Actiontecs is that it supported the later protocol and the 
Ciscos did not.)

I think you are referring to the CAP vs DMT distinction in modulation.
The 675 didn't support the newer modulation, but the 678 does.  I have
no experience with DSL in Verizon land though.

Possibly because they don't make Cisco 678's any more.

Yes. And, it has worked with Linux tools in the past on an earlier Linux
machine. The current problem might be the SCSI card, or it might be that
the card just isn't configured right. I have another card, which I will
bring along.

The Epson provided driver allows pre-scanning, and cropping before the
real scan. It also has a number of image adjustments that can be made. I
 haven't had a reason to use those (they are color adjustment tools that
are also available in the GIMP), but I have made good use of the
cropping feature in the past.

Keith is our resident VMware guru, and he is always at the Clinics.
Myself, I discovered Virtualbox by discussion on the Ubuntu forums and
love it. Everything just works. I was originally planning on going with
VMware, but from my experience I have become a devotee of Virtualbox.
Check it out at least.

There are more tools than Sane. I have XSane installed on my Ubuntu
computers, but I usually use Kooka, as it has more options and runs
faster.

Subject: [PLUG] Getting old Y2K fixes...
Message-ID: <20070910151807.besgcpm9s084cowk@web.robinson-west.com>

I know this isn't exactly Linux related, but I've been trying to
get a Y2K update for Windows 95b.  I'm wondering since games
like Warcraft II BNE and perhaps programs like Corel WordPerfect
Suite 8 as well don't work well on Linux via crossover Linux if
there's an open source effort to replace the Microsoft Windows
9x updates that Microsoft doesn't offer to anyone anymore?  XP
is not a natural update because it is soooo slow on anything
under a gigaherz (most computers that ran Windows 9x).

Even Windows 2000 has me worried these days.

I agree with the statement, "Windows 2000 is all you need for
most Windows software."  Unfortunately, when was the last date
update for 2000 released?  How can I get it now, if at all?
It seems ludicrous that all my googling to try and find updates
for old versions of Windows leads me to an, "update to Vista,"
page.  I'm not going to run old Windows software in Windows Vista,
it is neither NT nor 9x based.  Why aren't Y2K sites updating
instead of pointing at Microsoft's, "Upgrade to Vista," page?
How can I search for W95Y2K.exe and actually find it?

Sadly, the ReactOS project never produced a Windows 95 drop
in replacement that will run the same software.  ReactOS, in
general, seems a long ways from being stable after I tried the
last 0.3.3 rel 2 alpha.  Apparently, the whole entire win32
subsystem has to be rewritten before ReactX, or whatever the
ReactOS DirectX replacement will be called, can be implemented.

Installing Corel Wordperfect Suite 8 directly to Windows 2000
seems to hose it as it is not designed for a multiuser system.
For Warcraft II BNE, Windows 2000 is way overkill.  Playing
Warcraft II BNE in XP under emulation as a non administrative
user does not allow me to save; 2000 exhibits the same problem.
The whole point of a multiuser system is not being root.

Seeing Tuesday September 9 2007 in Windows 95B tells me there
is a major date problem.

A question comes to mind, is Cedega worth it for old Windows
9x games?  Does Cedega really require a monthly subscription?

If there were more companies like my game company writing games
for Linux that are competitive with what you can get for Windows
and television consoles, I'd be interested in them ;-)

Subject: [PLUG] Wiki is now online
Message-ID: <20070911003708.GD2488@gate.kl-ic.com>


Wil got the PLUG wiki going this weekend, at www DOT pdxlinux DOT org
SLASH wiki SLASH .  It does not have authentication yet, but I expect
it to in the future.  Until then, I will not post the URL where the
bots can find it. 

The front page is more-or-less the default with a few lines added.
Anybody who wants to redesign the page is the new wiki master.  When
you edit, please set up an account.  Also go to the page PlugMembers
and add yourself.

The underlying technology is Moin and Python.

The library is also up; that is a separate announcement.

Subject: [PLUG] The PLUG Library is now available
Message-ID: <20070911005207.GA2735@gate.kl-ic.com>


The pages are up for the PLUG distributed book library, on the new Wiki.
See [ www DOT pdxlinux DOT org SLASH wiki SLASH PlugLibrary ] and read
the details there.  Expect the rules to evolve, as we encounter and 
circumvent various forms of wickedness .

Right now, the library is three boxes of books in my basement, mostly
publisher donations from OSCON.  Eventually, those will be distributed
out to Library members, and circulated between Library members - there
will be no permanent central repository.  You can become a PLUG Library
member by logging into the wiki, setting up a user page with enough
information to contact you, and by acting like a responsible adult
( this excludes about 5% of the users of the mailing list ).  This is
NOT a perk for PLUG members, but friends sharing books with friends,
so please behave.

If you sign up, and email requests, I will bring books to either the
Clinic on the 16th or the Advanced topics meeting on the 17th.  I can
also give you a book if come to my house in Beaverton, or at the next
general meeting on October 4th.  I consider some of the books "checked
out" to me, but I will try to be done with them by the November 19th
advanced topics meetings.

You can also donate books.  I'm designing some stickers to go in and
on the books;  I will bring some to the meetings.  the image will be
up on the wiki soon, so you can print more.

Again, we are making this up as we go along.  Let's see if we can
invent a new kind of book library.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0709101823480.10343@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   The power supply on my server/workstation died suddenly this morning.
Since the last power supply failure subtly broke the motherboard, I waited
until ENU opened at noon and bought replacement parts. I'd like to thank all
of you for last month's thread on motherboards and CPUs; I bought an ASUS
M2NPV-VM, an Athlon X2 64 4800+, and 2G RAM. And, of course, a replacement
Antec power supply.

   After spending the afternoon rebuilding the system, and getting all those
tiny chassis plugs on the proper pins along the edge of the system board, it
boots just fine. But, there's no AGP slot for the new Radeon I bought to go
with the new monitor (when the old monitor died a couple of weeks ago). So,
I'm using the built-in nVidia GeForce 6150. However, when I change the
device driver to 'nv' in /etc/X11/xorg.conf, the X server still doesn't like
what it sees. I must have an incorrect driver specification, but that's the
only driver in /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/drivers/ that looked likely.

   The errors thrown by X are:

(EE) Failed to load module "TTF" (module does not exist, 0)
(EE) Failed to load module "TrueType" (module does not exist, 0)
(EE) Failed to load module "atmfonts" (module does not exist, 0)
(EE) Failed to load module "local" (module does not exist, 0)
(EE) Failed to load module "culmus" (module does not exist, 0)
(EE) No devices detected.

Fatal server error:
no screens found

   /var/log/Xorg.0.log confirms this. The 'nv' driver apparently supports
every flavor of GeForce except the 6150.

   Please suggest a driver for me to use.

I have the same setup. I don't recall having any problems with the nv
driver. I use Feisty amd64, and it is a snap to install the nVidia
proprietary driver, so that is what I did eventually. I think I used
the Automatix script to install it. No problems at all.

   Well, whatever the reason, X doesn't want to start. Since the monitor and
resolution are the same, I assume the error messages refer to the video
driver.

   I downloaded the nVidia driver from their web site and will install it
tomorrow morning.

Thanks, John,

Most often this type of scenario really means they don't want to 
"support" any additional devices.

IIRC Verizon used  frame dslams back in the  day and now they're using
DSL2  capable gear. FWIW we do have Cisco 877's deployed on the Verizon
network where I work and they function fine.

That shouldn't be necessary. I, too, have a nearly identical setup,
and X.org works just fine with the "stock" open driver. FWIW, I've
attached my xorg.conf. There's nothing special about it--it's what X
created via its '-configure' option.

   That did the trick. X is up and running just fine now.

   Now that the new power supply is installed, the machine is once again
silent. Perhaps now that the CPU is a dual-core (I think that's what the 'X2'
in the name means), I should advertise that the machine runs silent, runs
deep, eh?

Perhaps I should clarify a little.
I am using the Actiontech modem/wireless as a modem these days.  We have 
a D-Link set up doing routing/ wireless.  The Actiontech has suffered 
from the symptoms described early on in this thread...All I really need 
is a quality/affordable, Verizon DSL compatible modem that works.  
Someone said early on that the Actiontech without wireless worked well 
on the systems they were familiar with...

Thanks for the responses.

It really depends on what you want to run.  If you are just running it as 
a stand alone server, then the nv driver will work OK.  (Not great, but it 
runs. Slow, but stable.)  If you expect to run anything that needs 
hardware acceleration (like OpenGL, Beryl/Compiz/Compiz-Fusion, games, 
etc.) then you will want the commercial driver. Also, if you are using the 
absolute current version of X (the one released within the last week), you 
will need to wait until the next release of the commercial driver because 
it does not support the new ABI.

There is an open source driver in the works.  It is pretty beta at the 
moment.  Not something you could run Beryl with yet, but getting there.

   Thank you, Alan, for the insight. There's nothing special I run here, but
X would just not start with the provided 'nv' driver. The commercial one
works, and that's all that matters to me.

Which chipset?  Which distro and version of X?  It may need to be reported 
as a bug.

I also have an Actiontec modem/wireless. It has been working flawlessly for
3 days now that the phone company found where the problem was in the line.
These can be a very difficult things to find. My experience so far is that
DSL troubles are usually caused by defects in the line between the modem and
the phone companies remote. Try to get those fixed first. On the other hand
as Ed has mentioned some problems can be fixed with another modem which
might be a quicker fix than finding trouble in the line.

   The ASUS M2NPV-VM comes with the nVidia GeForce 6150 GPU on the
northbridge and the nVidia nForce 430 MCP on the southbridge.

   Haven't yet upgraded, so it's Slackware-11.0 and
x11-6.9.0-i486-14_slack11.0; the latter upgrade came out a few weeks ago.

It may be that the PCI ID is new enough that the system does not see it 
as an nVIDIA card.  I have encountered that before on really new systems 
and older distros.

Trying to remember how the pci_id->driver is configured...  Need more 
coffee.

If it's running chroot'd, then /var/named/etc/namedb.

If it's a newer version than what comes with the base system,
/usr/local/etc/namedb.

Else, /etc/namedb.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0709111321190.21105@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   When I reassembled the server/workstation yesterday, I plugged in the USB
headset to one of the four ports on the rear of the chassis. Now that's the
only sound output device seen by the system.

   lspci | egrep audio

returns nothing. Looking at /proc/asound/cards shows

  1 [U0x46d0x8ad ]: USB-Audio - USB Device 0x46d:0x8ad
                    USB Device 0x46d:0x8ad at usb-0000:00:0b.0-2, full speed

   The manual tells me the board contains the SoundMAX ADI AD186A 5.1-channel
CODEC, and the sound does come through the headset well enough.

   Running alsaconf also returns nothing. Even manually loding the
snd-intel8x0 module doesn't help; alsamixer will not open:

alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device

   So, my question to Paul, John, and anyone else using this motherboard is,
what sound driver works so that the speakers function?

TIA,

Rich

I'm not sure about plugging into the USB for sound.

But my M2NPV-VM tells me this.

   Slackware doesn't have hwinfo; if it has the equivalent, I don't know what
that is.

   lspci shows me this same device.

   Ah! I have the source for hda_intel, but it's not compiled. This shall be
remedied right away.

Thanks,

I'm using the Intel HDA ("high definition audio") ALSA driver,
"snd-intel-hda". I had to pass it the following options to get it to
work properly:

  position_fix=1 model=3stack

You can do it manually via modprobe, or add it to /etc/modprobe.d/.

   Progress. Built and installed the module, and now see it as a device

[root at salmo ~]# less /proc/asound/cards
  0 [NVidia      ]: HDA-Intel - HDA NVidia
                    HDA NVidia at 0xfe024000 irq 10

                    USB Device 0x46d:0x8ad at usb-0000:00:0b.0-2, full speed

and as a module

snd_hda_intel          14616  0 
snd_hda_codec         151280  1 snd_hda_intel

   Adding the two options above (even changing the position_fix to 0) makes
no difference.

   Where do I learn about options for this module?

   Now alsamixer runs for me as a user, and I have the levels at maximum, but
no sound from the speakers.

   Fixed. All devices were muted by default. Turning them on makes a big
difference.

Thanks all!

There is a good reason that the devices are all muted by default.  A long 
time ago, it used to be max volume by default.

Scared the living crap out of people when I was testing a kernel on the 
bus one morning.

I have a Westell that is not in use and probably won't go back into
use as I have
switched to Vios.  Anyone interested in a cheap DSL modem?

Larry,

I would not mind giving it a try.  I live in Sandy, Or. and am leaving 
for Northern Idaho in the morning.  If you still have it in a couple of 
weeks, or less, when I get back, maybe we could find a way to transfer 
said device to a new home.

Thanks,

Bruce

It's in extended support well into 2010.  So, it's gets them as soon as 
they are available for XP or Vista as long as the are classified as 
critical.

It's totally NT based.  It's NT version 6.0 and says so in the OS.

Subject: [PLUG] Tools for really thrashing a machine,
	and reporting specific errors
Message-ID: <20070912061525.GA9115@gate.kl-ic.com>


I have been having some problems with a flaky laptop lately - it 
stops without warning, sometimes in the middle of typing something,
often all by itself.  Just in case it is memory, I replaced it with
new RAM from ENU ( it turns out that my supposedly 1GB T30 will work
with 2 GB of RAM, so it was worthwhile ).  

Now I want to thrash it and see if there are any bugs remaining.
MEMTEST reports nothing, but it did not before I replaced the RAM.

So I am looking for something that thrashes harder, but like MEMTEST
is small and standalone and easy to diagnose.  The classic "compile
X" kinds of tests may stress the machine, but I would like diagnostics,
too, as specific as possible, not just "it failed".

Any suggestions?

memtest86
or
linux app memtester

But in my experience some of the best memory tests are those that run
enough apps
to cause swapping to occur.  A friend of mine worked on diagnostics
for Tek Logic
analyzers and memory errors were a common failure reported by customers.
The test line diags
didn't find it but one of there techs would start SETI program in
background, run other
diags in another session and then play Doom in the foreground.  This
tech always found
the customer reported memory problems.

There are a number of useful tools in CTCS and LTP.

If it happens again, try to ssh in from another machine. Is it completely
hosed or is it just that the keyboard/mouse are locked up?

I have my doubts you'll be able to get much more info than that.
You can thrash the system with CPUBurn and/or Bonnie++.
More here: http://lbs.sourceforge.net/

I wonder if thrashing the network might reveal something?

Message-ID: <c834ec80709121212v15e8bcb6qc457971e2208076a@mail.gmail.com>

I'm planning to pickup a tv tuner card and add dvr capabilities to my
(kubutu-based) media pc with mythtv.

I'm not really clear on how tuner cards differ, and whether I should
be concerned about driver compatibility, hdmi input, etc.. really, I
just want to be able to record the Women's world cup, and watch it at
a reasonable hour :)

Do any of you have suggestions or warnings?  The Hauppauge
WinTV-PVR-150 MCE PCI Interface 1042 Tuner Card looks like a pretty
good bet (from Newegg for roughly $70), but as I implied, I'd like to
be sure it's the right thing for my needs.

Thanks,
Rogan

I just bought one (a low profile version) and it works flawlessly with
mythtv.  I don't know about hdmi or hdtv, but it works great for me and
my non-hdtv.

My current reading suggests you will be happier with a higher end card. 
   Think of the PVR-150 as a win-modem and the 250/250 as real modems. 
With a hefty/healthy system you could be OK but give up on doing too 
much more while recording or playing back with a lighter end system.

You might also look at making sure your card does HDTV unless you want 
to reinvest in a little over a year.  I understand, but haven't 
researched it, that HDTV will become the _one_ system in Jan or Feb of 2009.

Check out this review (http://www.linux.com/feature/118668) and if 
memory serves me right there are good resources on the MythDora site. 
(I'm a RPM fan so I didn't look at the other sites)

I have a Wintv-pvr 250 that works well also. However, you might want to
consider http://www.pchdtv.com/ , it does HD as well as SD, and was designed
for Linux from the ground up.

Thanks for the pointers -- I just ordered a pvr-250.  The pchdtv
forums and mythtv wiki seemed to indicate a fair number of problems
with that card -- a poll showed less than 50% success :(.  It also
looks like the pchdtv card(s) don't do any hardware encoding, which
seems like the place you'd want assistance.

The 350 seems like overkill, and I'm not hurting for cycles on this
machine (dual-core Athlon 5600), so a bit of software decoding
shouldn't hurt.

I made a similar assessment, and although I haven't used my 250 much, what
little I've done has worked well. The one thing I've discovered about the
350 that would be a meaningful improvement over the 250 for me is that I
like the remote the 350 comes with better than the 250...

I haven't seen anyone mention the Ultimate Boot CD

http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/

This has, of course, memtest86, but it also has processor and disk
stress tests. A word of warning, though -- I really think you should
back up the machine and prepare to buy a new one if new RAM didn't fix
it. If the processor or hard drive is dying, it's probably going to be
harder to get replacement parts, and stress tests could very well break
something that's just badly bent at the moment. Besides, dual-core
Turion64s are just too cool not to have. :)

Found the answer.  Adding (setq vm-imap-save-to-server t) to my .vm
file makes it so the normal save command saves to IMAP folders instead
of local files.

This is logging in to an X session as root?

I would suggest, don't.
If you need root access, use a terminal, and use sudo.  You can run terminal
commands or launch GUI commands with sudo.
For example in some cases you may need a root privileged file explorer
(Konquerer or Nautilus) in order to copy to external mounts, or other such
issues, just launch one with sudo.
     sudo nautilus &

If it complains when trying to launch a GUI app with sudo, first run xhost
+localhost to allow your own machine to connect to the running X session as
root.
This is much preferable to running everything in X as root.
Also, when launching GUI admin tools it will ask for your root password in a
dialog box, and only that app will have root privileges.

It is strongly recommended to do your daily activities, especially running
X, as a regular non-privileged user.

I've been using Blinksale for my invoicing. At the free level, the 3
invoices a month is adequate for what I need. I'm reasonably happy with
it. I have three "main" clients, one doesn't need invoices and one has a
very specific format, in an excel sheet, that I have to set up twice a
month. I have a few "here and there" clients that the blinksale invoices
work "just fine" for.

Now, however, one of my clients wants/needs his invoices in PDF
format.  

I remember the conversation here about how good SQL ledger is. I looked
it and _wow_ it looks like a lot of stuff. Stuff I don't need, stuff I
don't particularily want. 

Is there a good smaller thing that'll output PDF invoices?

Can you print those invoices?

How about a pdf printer driver? I ran into a similar need on my XP
machine and found out about CutePDF. It works for what I need. I figured
that if something like that exists in the Win world, it probably exists
in the Linux world. I Googled:

Linux "pdf printer driver"

and found a number of links talking about CUPS and pdf.

   Ectually, if you can print a document to file from within a linux
application, it's usually in PostScript format. That can be run through the
ps2pdf filter to produce the desired output.

   OO.o produces PDF output as an option.

   SL has extensive capabilities, and we use only a very small sub-set of
them. It provides us with the necessary General Ledger and the usual
journals for Accounts Receivable and Payable. Plus the other accounting
software functions. Our accountant really likes it because we give her all
the information she needs.

I use the 'cups-pdf' package in Ubuntu/Debian to print anything to a 
PDF.  It is super easy setup if you follow this guide:

http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Create_and_Print_to_a_Virtual_PDF_Printer

You are right that SQL Ledger is overkill for such a small company.  I 
use BambooInvoice because it is simple, web based, and can make PDF 
invoices.  It requires the basic LAMP stack.

I wouldn't bother getting something that does only NTSC broadcasts
(non-digital); it's going to be obsolete in within a couple years (well,
that's the /current/ plan, and that's been pushed back a number of years
already). ATSC is the new digitial standard and what you want to look
for; not all local channels are HD but everything on NTSC broadcast is
also on ATSC. For example, 3 of 4 OPB channels are standard definition
(oh yeah, that's another nice thing with ATSC--several more channels).
My pointing this out is somewhat pedantic, since any vendor selling an
ATSC tuner will call it HDTV. ATSC broadcasts are also an MPEG4 stream.

I cannot really make any recommendations since my own purchasing has
been hobbled by me being a cheapskate and not having done all the right
research. I initially bought a Hauppauge WinTV HVR-1600, which does both
NTSC and ATSC; unfortunately, there is no Linux support yet. I traded it
with a friend who had a WinTV Radio 401, which is NTSC-only but has a
supported chipset. Unfortunately, it's only a frame-grabber, unlike the
PVR-150, 250 and 350, which actually encode the stream as MPEG2 and so
requires much less processing by MythTV. (It's fine with a non-DVR
program like tvtime, but MythTV won't do that.) A framegrabber basically
outputs the raw frames in some format that I do not know the name of. My
last purchase was from Craig's List of a HVR-950, which is a USB stick.
It works okay, but it requires downloading and installing a 3rd party
set of drivers, which for some reason the author felt compelled to
license under the Mozilla Public License, so I think chances of it being
included in the mainline kernel are slim.

So, things to look out for:
 o Good mainline kernel support. It can be hard to determine, really,
given the state of V4L2 and IVTV stuff, although I think that has
changed in recent kernels.
 o ATSC receiver.
 o If you want NTSC and don't have a very fast machine, get one that
includes an MPEG2 encoder.
 o Do you need IR/remote control support?

Of course, depending on your intended use, most of this might not
matter.

That's not a slingbox -- that's your email header ;)

I think the HDHomeRun lets you watch tv over a lan -- but you might be
able to route wan traffic to it some how.  (The device appears to hook
into one or two coax cables, so you'd need the signal to be local to
the HDHomeRun one way or another. Full-screen YouTube -> coax video
out -> HDHomeRun, maybe? :)

Comments on here:
http://forums.ruckuswireless.com/forums/6/topics/79
indicate that you'd need bandwith in the vicinity of 8-20Mbps to
stream tv from a device like the HDHomeRun, so hosting a streaming tv
server is probably out of the question for most of us, but it might be
possible to be a client to such a service, if everything was working
perfectly.  Additional compression (presumably lossy) would put things
into a whole new category of "possible", but that would have to be
done externally to the tv capture gadget, unless I'm misunderstanding
how these typically work.

The coax cables are for cable/antennas for the dual tuners. The output
is over IP over Ethernet; I do not know what the application-level
protocol is, but I suspect it's MPEG2 or 4 over something like RTSP.

That sounds about right. So the answer to Sean is, it depends on the
bandwidth of your WAN :)

Yes, what you have described--capturing TV signals and scaling them down
and compressing them is pretty much exactly what a Slingbox does.
(There's a MythTV plug-in that does something similar, if you've got
enough CPU; I suspect my lowly 1GHz PIII doesn't.)

Also, I was mistaken about ATSC broadcast--it's an MPEG2 stream, not
MPEG4.

PLUG Advanced Topics Meeting

September 17th, 2007  7pm

Jax Bar
826 SW 2nd Avenue
Portland, Oregon

Speaker: Eric Wilhelm
          Scratch Computing

Title:  "Parallel Testing with Perl"

Since 1988, Perl (and then CPAN) has used the "Test Anything Protocol"
to relay test results from test files to a test harness.

In 2006, Curtis "Ovid" Poe started the TAP::Harness project, which has
formalized the TAP protocol, cleaned-up the harness code, and made it
possible to do lots of new and exciting things with the Perl test
tools.  As an example, Eric Wilhelm has already implemented a parallel
test harness as a very thin and clean layer on top of TAP::Harness.

TAP has grown up, and is not just for Perl anymore.  TAP producers are
already available for C/C++, Forth, Java, Javascript, Python, PHP,
PL/SQL, and can be easily developed for any language (or process) which
is able to produce plaintext output.

This presentation will cover
   * the simple innards of the TAP protocol
   * running your tests with a harness
   * testing multiple languages
   * testing poultry
   * running tests in parallel
   * resolving parallel resource conflicts
   * moving on: caching and clustering

What I've read on the forum suggests that the amount of tuners available 
on the network is how many computers can watch.  So a two tuner device 
would allow two computers simultaneous viewing (after configuration of 
the driver on each computer to go to the correct tuner on the device). 
If it was RTSP et al,, then it seems the limit would be in the network 
bandwidth and compatibility wouldn't be a few OS's, it would be anything 
that can watch the stream.  Streaming would be awesome though if 
bandwidth were the only limitation here.

With an out-of-the-box unicast client-server setup, then yeah, two
tuners means two computers watching two shows. But my experience with
these things has been with MythTV, so I tend to think of two tuners as
two channels that can be recorded simultaneously. (With a front-end like
MythTV, you only need one tuner for each channel; multiple clients can
watch the same stream then.) And if you could reflect the stream to
multicast, your local bandwidth isn't much of an issue either. (Both
that's only theoretical; I don't know of anything that actually does
this easily, although I am sure it's there.)

Derek Allard, the maintainer, actually just released a new version 
today.  It looks like the next update after this one is going to have 
some new features.

Hopefully they liquidate, Novell can buy UNIX back and GPL it once and
for all.

Or maybe they will continue to survive:

http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=956929

"We examine a sample of 459 firms filing for Chapter 11 during the
period 1991 to 1998 and find that our sample firms experience
significant improvements in their operating performance during Chapter
11. Our evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that Chapter 11, if
anything, provides net benefits to bankrupt firms. In the cross section,
firms with higher debt ratios experience greater improvements in
operating performance, and the complexity of the renegotiation process
negatively affects the improvement. We find no relationship between
Chapter 11 outcome and changes in risk-adjusted firm value in Chapter 11."

They don't have to buy it back.  The court said they own it.

If you look at SCO's filing, it does not include the debt to Novell. 
(About $25 million or so.)  Leaving off large chunks of debt is not viewed 
on favorably by the courts.

  Can IBM and Novell collect their attorney fees from SCO before it goes 
under? ;-)

That's not debt to Novell.  SCO has a bunch of Novell's money.  I imagine
Novell is working very hard to ensure SCO isn't going to try and use their
money to pay SCO's creditors.

Subject: [PLUG] Virtual Machine won't start
Message-ID: <46EEAD28.9090508@comcast.net>

First, thank you, Kieth and Aaron, for all the assistance at the clinic,
yesterday. Sadly, nothing that we did yesterday works, today.

Yesterday we tried to get sound working on the virtual machine (Win98).
We were unable to communicate between the virtual machine and the host
machine, and we assumed it was because of the change in the host
machine's IP address while at the clinic. When I got home, I restored
the host machine's IP address to the one I usually use, and then tried
to start up the virtual machine so I could move the sound driver file to
the virtual file system, and then install it.

I can start VMware Server Console, and I can connect to the host. When I
try to open the virtual machine, I am presented with the list of
possible machines, and select the only one that has ever been there.
Normally, the next thing that happens is that the virtual machine's
window in VMware Server goes black for a moment, and then some boot-up
messages appear. Eventually, the virtual machine boots with Win98.

Now, I only get as far as the black window. The "Power On" button in the
VMware Server Console is grayed out, but the green triangle is blinking.
It appears that it is hung, but I have no idea what to do next.

Ideas?

Subject: [PLUG] Kooka Help
Message-ID: <46EEB9D2.80503@comcast.net>

Yesterday at the clinic (again, thanks for all the help) we got my
scanner working with Kooka. Today, I can't find the buttons that were
there, yesterday. It looks just like it did when we started. I played
around with it awhile, but I don't know what I did that caused the
"Final Scan" and "Preview Scan" buttons to appear. From the Kooka help
doc, it appears that those buttons are part of the Scanner Settings
section of the Preview panel. My Preview panel doesn't have the Scanner
Settings section.

Also, when I click on "Settings" "Select Scan Device", nothing happens.

lsscsi returns:

[0:0:2:0]    scanner EPSON    Perfection600    V2.4  -

I did have to restart the machine to get that, though. Just like
yesterday, the scanner has to be powered up before booting, or the
computer won't see that it's there. And, it has to be powered up fairly
early in the boot process. When I powered up the machine for the first
time after coming home yesterday, I _remembered_ that I needed to power
up the scanner just after hitting the power button on the computer. I
walked around to where I could reach the scanner's power switch, and
turned it on -- elapsed time about 4-5 seconds. I had to reboot in order
for lsscsi to report the presence of the scanner.

Running through the YaST process to add the scanner I select from the list:

Epson Perfection 600: Driver umax (package sane) provides good
functionality. [OK SCSI-ID=EPSON Perfection600]

...and I get...

Driver	Scanner
umax	EPSON Perfection600 at umax:/dev/sg0

One of the YaST buttons, at this point in the process, is "Other". Other
includes "Test", which successfully tests the scanner (I heard the
motor, in addition to seeing the results of the successful test).

But, in spite of all that apparent success, I still can't figure out how
to get Kooka to see the scanner.

It's possible that, after taking your pc back home, you have to
reconfigure kooka, to get it to see your scanner.  Try Settings ->
Configure Kooka -> Startup

There are three check boxes and all are checked:

[x] Query network for available scanners.
[x] Show the scanner selection box on next startup
[x] Load the last image into the viewer on startup

The scanner selection box does not appear when I start the program.

I tried editing the virtual machine settings. I changed Sound Adapter
from Auto detect to Using device /dev/dsp, and the clicked OK. I got a
message about creating a new UUID (I think that was the acronym). The
message said that if I wasn't sure if I needed a new one, go ahead and
create a new one. I did. Then I successfully started the virtual machine.

Still not sure what was wrong, but it works, now.

Subject: [PLUG] Sound in VMware Server
Message-ID: <46EEE018.4010000@comcast.net>

OK. Now that I have the virtual machine running again, I tried
installing the sound driver Aaron found for me yesterday. It is
sp17395.exe. It successfully installed on my virtual Win98. Naturally,
the virtual machine had to be restarted at that point.

When it did, I could detect the startup music. I had the volume level
down on the speakers, so I turned it up and loaded the program I have
that has sound files in it. I tried playing one. It works, but it sounds
lousy. The tempo seems correct, but the pitch varies, and it also sounds
distorted.

Any ideas on what to look at?

I tried reading the Kooka documentation, but didn't find anything
useful. I tried connecting with the KDE forums, but the password they
just sent me doesn't work!

I decided to try loading xsane using YaST. When I try to run it, I get
the following error message:

no devices available

Possible reasons:

...
3. The permissions for the device file do not allow you to use it - try
as root
...

I tried running xsane as root, and it works.

Earlier, I learned that the scanner appears to be associated with
/dev/sg0, which ls -l reports as:

crw-r----- 1 root disk 21, 0 2007-09-17 10:03 sg0

Is there something about those permissions I need to change to allow a
program running as a user to work?

Since you're not root or in the disk group do:
sudo chmod 666 /dev/sg0
Then your UID will have permissions to read and write to the device.

Subject: [PLUG] A Valuable Lesson on Using Proprietary Video Drivers
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0709171603020.11179@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I pulled a really bone-head move while logged in remotely to my
workstation/server from my notebook. After successfully killing the
application that hung hard and prevented me from changing to a console to
kill it, I became distracted by a telephone call and halted the server
rather than the notebook. Not a stellar start to the week.

   But, what rubbed salt into that wound was the disappearance of the nvidia
video driver module. Gone. Kaput. Not to be found. Could not start X, and
modprobe could not find the nvidia driver, either. Fortunately, I saved the
downloaded .run file, but I had to go through the entire installation again,
including having it build all the modules.

   That's rather strange, but it's what happened. As I'm not used to using
such modules, I don't know if this is normal for the genre, or if I was just
lucky to hit the system at the right moment.

Are you sure that it couldn't find module, perhaps it failed to load it? If
you upgrade a kernel without appropriately updating the driver, it will fail
to load. I've often seen this described as "losing" the driver. I've never
seen the driver actually disappear though, unless your package manager did
something weird. What distro are you using?

A trick to get you up and running quickly should this happen again is to
edit your xorg.conf and change the driver line in your video card device
definition to use the OSS driver instead of the proprietary NV one. Instead
of having the driver value be "nvidia", change it to "nv". That will get you
going again, just without 3D acceleration.

   The error message was that the module could not be found. Locate confirmed

   I did not upgrade the kernel between the time I inadvertently halted the
machine and when I rebooted it.

   If the 'nv' driver worked in the first place I would not have downloaded
and installed nVidia's proprietary one. The X Window System would not start
using 'nv'.

Whenever I need to use a video driver that will work in the worst of
conditions, I choose "vesa".  While both vesa and nv require kernel
support, vesa support is more likely to be present in your average
kernel.

Does nv not work for you because it is not present in your kernel, or
for some other weird reason?

Carlos,

   The module 'nv' was loaded, but X would not start; the message was that
there was no device found. Running 'lsmod' showed it loaded right at the top
of the list. Ergo, the answer to your question is "for some other weird
reason" that I do not know.

   There was a thread on this a couple of weeks ago when the power supply on
this host died and I rebuilt the unit with new power supply, motherboard,
CPU, and RAM. The ASUS board has built-in video of the nVidia flavor.

It seems to me that it would be better to change the permission of the
user instead of the device, that way, the next device that he tries
might work without having to track down device permissions, again.

Add yourself to the "disk" group:

adduser richard disk

In this case, I will have to admit that it still might not work because
of the read-only for group (although, a scanner should be a read-only
device), but 660 would still give you some control over access to the
device.

I don't think this is a good solution.  On my machine, the disk group
has write access to all the drive devices in /dev, meaning that any
user in that group could wreak havoc on the filesystems without any OS
protection.  (This machine also has a "scanner" group, although I
don't have a scanner.)

I'd say changing the permissions on the device is a fair bit safer --
I occasionally cat things to devices directly to trouble shoot (eg:
cat a wav to /dev/dsp to determine if sound works, or catting a pdf to
a printer... etc.)  I'd really hate to hose my filesystem to a copy of
Yngwie Malmseem's Concerto for Electric Guitar.

Generally speaking, Derek's suggestion is sound -- but in this case
the group probably shouldn't be "disk".  (Of course, on the machine
with scanner issues "disk" could be a benign group, like "scanner" on
ubuntu... but I doubt it.)

Subject: [PLUG] kbuildsycoca ... why?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0709180641500.2306@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Here's a strange one for which I'd like some understanding and an
explanation.

   Yesterday I upgraded winpdb (the GUI version of the python debugger, pdb)
from 1.0.8 to 1.2.2. When I invoked the debugger, it showed 'kbuildsycoca
running ...' and spewed a huge number of warnings about files in
/usr/share/kde/applications. This puzzled me because I don't do KDE (too
kute for me) or Gnome. It also opened a virtual console, but instead of
using the default terminal here, rxvt, it opened a konsole. Strange stuff,
and different from the earlier version.

   I posted this information on the winpdb sourceforge forum, and the author
responded that winpdb has nothing to do with kbuildsycoca, and perhaps it's
a wxPython issue. Er, no. Shows up only with winpdb and it's command line
sibling, rpdb2. So, I replied to that message just now.

   In the meantime, I used Google to search for kbuildcoca and learned that
it's used to "rebuild the system configuration cache." Which leads me to you
gurus here:

   1) Why would an application -- particularly a code debugger -- want to
rebuild the system configuration cache each time the application is invoked?

   2) Why is a KDE tool being used when KDE is not the desktop/wm in use
here?

   3) For what is the system configuration cache used, and how is it normally
retained and controlled?

   On a higher level, I still haven't figured out how I broke the application
and why what worked before is not working now. That's today's task.

It occurred to me that this might be one of those things that is done
one way by one community, and another way by another community, so I
decided to search the SuSE forums. I found that the issue has come up,
and that both of the recommendations -- adding the user to the disk
group, or changing the permissions of the scanner device -- were put
forth as options. Considering the potential for damage by having myself
a user of the disk group, I'll stick with the changed permissions on the
scanner. I don't think there's too much danger of some errant program
taking over the scanner.

Thanks to both of you for your suggestions.

It would be very difficult to upgrade a kernel then... :D I've seen
countless occasions, particularly on machines where uptime matters, where a
new kernel or some other Very Important piece of software  is installed, but
the machine is not restarted for weeks / months / years. When the machine is
finally restarted, some unexpected thing breaks.

Hm. it surprises me that nv didn't work, particularly for embedded video.
That driver has been very reliable in my experience. Just the other day I
got a machine running with 8400GS card running happily with a year or so old
version of nv. I also have not had problems with it on the 20 or so other
Nvidia based machines I've setup. Sounds like you are either very unlucky or
have a very old version of X installed.

I think the KDE infrastructure does this each time it starts up (and
possibly at various time while it's running.)  KDE makes use of some
fancy interprocess communication "stuff" that I don't know much about,
other than the reason KDE apps seem to integrate well is related to
this infrastructure that starts up whenever you run something that
makes use of certain KDE components.

The warnings *might* be related to stuff like default icon sets not
existing or some similarly benign issue... but without seeing them
it's had to guess.  Either way, at least they're just warnings (and
KDE warnings at that--I'm guessing you don't care if KDE is missing a
font, or can't render everything in the default alpha-blended glory.)

Any application can link to KDE and use it's "stuff".  It sounds like
winpdb used the KDE system config to figure out your default console
(which of course, isn't your default console, since you've never
configured KDE, and it defaults to konsole.)

Running the desktop environment really doesn't have much to do with
the actual applications.  If you *were* running KDE, then all that kde
stuff that pdb started up  would have already been happily running in
the bg.

   That's interesting. winpdb is a GUI built with wxPython wrapping the same
author's Remote Python Debugger (rpdb2), also written in python. He claimed
in his response to my message on the sourceforge forum that winpdb has
nothing to do with kbuildsyscoca. Sigh. Something's calling it, even when I
run the command line rpdb2.

   I think that was it. A lot of the warnings for for <application>.desktop,
whatever those are.

   Correct.

   That's what's so confusing; winpdb is supposedly not dipping its toes in
the KDE waters.

   Thanks very much for the feedback. I'll wait to see what the author writes
in response to my answers to his questions.

Problem resolved...

It seemed that when I restarted named

/usr/sbin/named -u bind

The old process was still running...
So, I killed it by hand and then everything worked great...

I had to verify that my config files were correct first..

Thanks again

everydns.net is free and reliable with plenty of redundancy. The interface
for adding/updating records is straightforward but is not https.

I'm not quite sure what I'm getting into. I'd like to serve files to a few friends, files that are too large to send as file attachments. So it seems to me that an FTP server might be the way to go:

But I'm not quite done yet. The host computer gets an IP address from a router (it's on a LAN), and the router gets its address by DHCP from the ISP. Leases can last a long time; but this probably complicates DNS resolution. Can someone give me advice on how to proceed? Do I need to change the TOPOLOGY?

The first thing you will need to do is tell your router to forward any
traffic going to ftp port 21 to the internal address of the host
computer. On my Linksys router this is called Port Range Forward and
is under Applications and Gaming. Most routers have this ability, but
they all call it something slightly different.

To handle the DNS problem you could use a service like dyndns.com
See http://www.dyndns.com/services/dns/dyndns/ for how to set this up.
There are linux clients for updating the DNS server when your ip
changes ( apt-cache search dyndns).

Running servers on your machine can create security problems. Be careful.

If you want to outsource this to someone else's server you can use
something like

The topology needs to look like this, from the outside in:

- A publically-available interface.  This is your DSL or cable modem.
  I have found that most DSL modems do routing and NAT, while most
  cable modems simply pass through the connection un-routed and
  un-natted.  Whatever the case may be, public access to this device
  must be reliable.  Bill's suggstion of a dynamic dns service applies
  here.  There are internet services available for keeping your
  dynamic IP pinned to a hostname.  Try http://www.no-ip.com/ , or
  consider getting a static IP address - better.  The end result is
  that your DNS name must resolve to a valid IP address, evan if that
  IP address changes once in a while.  Or you could just hand out your
  IP address, but you're hating it if it changes.

- A router.  Since the machine running the FTP service is not directly
  connected to the internet, something has to forward the traffic from
  the external interface to the interface on the FTP machine.  Perhaps
  your DSL modem is also a router, or maybe you have a D-Link or
  Linksys router (or something similar), or maybe you are using a
  linux box with 2 NICs and iptables as your router.  Whatever your
  router may be, you have to configure it to pass TCP ports 20 and 21
  to the FTP machine.  Also, as a separate step, the router has to be
  told to allow WAN traffice from these ports.  It doesn't do any good
  to forward the packets if they are blocked at the front door.

- An FTP machine.  This machine needs to be easily locatable by your
  router, just as your external IP address needs to be easily
  locatable by the people who want to find your FTP server.  If you
  are using an appliance router (DSL modem/router, D-Link, Linksys,
  etc.), there is probably a feature allowing you to give your FTP
  machine a DHCP reservation.  This means that any time a DHCP lease
  request comes form a particular MAC address, it is given the same
  preconfigured IP address.

BTW, I would caution against using sudo for non-trivial root
commands.  sudo does not load root's environment.  You do not have
root's PATH, for example.  Get a real root shell instead.  sudo is
suitable for chown, chmod, and other single-action commands that do

ftp uses passwords in the clear.  sftp in a chroot is a better option.

As for informing them of the current ip address, you can e-mail it to them 
or use one of the dns publication services for dynamic dns.

I use zoneedit ( http://www.zoneedit.com/ ) for personal and
professional DNS hosting. First 5 domains are free. Been with them for
several (at least 5) years without a hitch.

Yeah but for what he's doing it wouldn't matter.  He could upload files 
internally and leave the ftp account anon with read-only access.  Then 
he could just send URL's to the friends and they wouldn't need to have 
anything installed just for him.  You could deny directory listing 
access as well so nosy passer-by's can't see the files.

Subject: [PLUG] SATA hot swap, PATA bridge
Message-ID: <20070920172738.GB20467@gate.kl-ic.com>


I rotate backup drives.  With 2.4 kernels, I could hotswap PATA
(40 pin Parallel ATA IDE) drives directly, using hdparm to tristate
the bus.  2.6 doesn't permit this, so I use USB2 hot swap cages
instead (see http://wiki.dirvish.org/index.cgi?USB2Drives ).

I have been experimenting with SATA hot swap.  I will be keeping my
PATA drives for the next few years, but I can use a SATA to PATA IDE
bridge board (JMicron JM20330 chipset, about $20) to connect the PATA
drive to a SATA cable to a SATA board.  This works at the same speed
as direct connect PATA, 30MB/s, much faster than USB2 at 10 to 20MB/s.

I've been running a "mount-write-read-erase-unmount" loop, 100GB at
a time, about 1 hour per cycle, for the last 3 days with no lockups.
Some USB2 bridge chipsets lock up after 5-50GB of transfer.  I am
confident enough to try making backups through the SATA path.

Many different SATA-PATA bridge boards are available.  Perhaps some
of you would like to try some of the other possibilities.  With all
the different options, I expect some will fail, either immediately
or after a few hours, but it would help to learn what works.

If this does work, I may be ditching a bunch of USB2 hardware.

One piece of hardware meltdown.  (Video card ate itself.  Just after the 
AT talk.  I blame Keith L's talk about hardware wearing out.)

Fedora 7 recovers very well from a replaced video card.  Nothing needed to 
be changed or updated.  Went from a bjorked nVIDIA card to an ATI and back 
to nVIDIA without a single hickup.

Not much else failing at this point.  I expect more when F8 gets released.

Now you've done it!  I just tried to go to http://www.pdxlinux.org and
got a DNS error.  http://pdxlinux.org works OK, though.

Subject: [PLUG] Apache loading default when Virtual host is defined
Message-ID: <20070921002730.GC3536@patch.com>

I have an Apache2 mystery

For testing I define lots of quickie domains:

  kwiki.patch.com
  tblos.patch.com
  foo.patch.com
  mikeraz.patch.com

Which are in DNS as
kwiki   IN  CNAME   tire
foo     IN  CNAME   tire
and so on.

And corresponding VirtualHost definition files in my /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
they all follow this format:

  <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName foo.patch.com
        ServerAdmin mikeraz at patch.com
        DocumentRoot /var/www/foo
        ErrorLog /var/log/www/foo-error.log
        CustomLog /var/log/www/foo-comb.log combined
        # perhaps some other special config
  </VirtualHost>

This works fine in all but one case.  The case that doesn't work is
tire.patch.com

The thing that makes this different from the N other VirtualHosts is
that tire is the acutal machine name.

For all except tire.patch.com apache serves up the content at the DocumentRoot
For tire.patch.com apache serves up the default stuff listed in the 000-Default file

Ideas as to why?  

I only need to fix this for my sanity, I don't really need to serve pages,
even test ones, out of tire.patch.com

I added the "testing" section so I could watch the command execute. It
didn't. If I run the scripts directly, they work. Is there something

Python is supposed to be so easy to learn and use that you don't need a

   The mail list has been suspiciously quiet today ... except for Keith's
SATA/PATA/USB information. I interpret this to mean that no one is having
issues or problems with systems, networks, or applications. That's great!\




Okay, let's try this one. It's easy to configure Ubuntu as an XDMCP terminal server with the command "Administration -> Login Window." However, it presents a 1024x768 display, even if the clients (in this case) are capable of 1280x1024. Is there any way to adjust this?

The commands given in the files may rely on a path environment variable that
doesn't exist in the cron environment.

so if the x10-lights-on.sh says something like:
  br -c A -n 1
you may need to change it to 
 /usr/bin/br -c A -n 1

If that's not the case post a script so we can have more information to work
with.

One thing to do when debugging cron-not-running issues is to tail the
syslog file (or less it and hit shift-f to put less in tail mode), and
watch what happens at the top of the minute after you make a change to
the crontab file.  If cron is running right, you should see a message
indicating that cron was updated.

Is cron actually running?  It is a service in /etc/init.d/.

Hava a look at the /etc/crontab file, just to make sure nothing is
funny there.  It's handy to add a MAILTO variable.  I have:

MAILTO=postmaster at pippiandcarlos.com

This makes cron use the local mail punter (ssmtp) to send the mail to
my mailserver, which delivers my cron mail to me (just as effectively
as postmaster spam reaches my inbox).  Getting the mail is an
important step.

Is the rsteff user in the cron group?  Whether this is necessary
depends upon distro.  In gentoo it is.

Maybe try putting jobs in /etc/cron.hourly to see if that part of cron
is working.

The crontab man page mentions cron.allow and cron.deny files.  Are
either of these present?

I recently had a machine whose vixie-cron would not work, just like
yours.  I ended up uninstalling and reinstalling it.  Then it worked.

If you use gdm as your login manager, you can set up multiple X
displays.  If you have 2, then one would be on CTRL-ALT-F7 and the
other on CTRL-ALT-F8.  You can be logged onto your desktop on one, and
leave the other on the gdm login screen.  From that screen, you can
click on XDMCP chooser and select a remote host.  The resolution you
get will be whatever your local machine supports at full screen.  To
configure gdm, run gdmsetup as root.

I don't use ubuntu, but I'm guessing its clicky-feature uses Xnest.
Xnest supports the general -geometry switch.  Maybe just cook up the
command yourself.  Try something like:

Xnest :2 -query ns.pippiandcarlos.com -geometry 1152x864

Which one? I tried locate syslog and got a long list.

Yes.

----------------------------------------------------------------
rsteff at Moonguide:/etc> cat crontab
SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/lib/news/bin
MAILTO=root
#
# check scripts in cron.hourly, cron.daily, cron.weekly, and cron.monthly
#
-*/15 * * * *   root  test -x /usr/lib/cron/run-crons &&
/usr/lib/cron/run-crons >/dev/null 2>&1
----------------------------------------------------------------

Looks like I should change the MAILTO to something more useful.
/etc/crontab does not include a warning about manually editing, like the
other crontab file. Does this mean that I can manually edit it? If not,
how do I make the change to that file? I.e. crontab -e, but logged in as
whom? root?

> Is the rsteff user in the cron group?  Whether this is necessary

/etc/groups does not have a cron group. This is a SuSE 10.1
distribution. rsteff is a member of only 3 groups, dialout, uucp, and video.

The test lines Michael recommended:

1,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * *
/home/rsteff/ShellScripts/x10-lights-on.sh

3,7,12,17,22,27,32,37,42,47,52,57 * * * *
/home/rsteff/ShellScripts/x10-lights-off.sh

just started working. Maybe it's fixed.

Only cron.deny. It lists only guest and gast.

That would imply it was never broken, or you did something in the meantime.
The idea behind my suggestion was to give lots of opportunity to watch the
event occur.  Your original lines would only trigger a light on/off once a
day.

/etc/crontab is distinct from root's crontab.

The cron daemon monitors this file for changes.  It's the system crontab 
and I don't think there's a way to edit it with crontab command.

Read 'man 5 crontab'.

Dunno why he started on 1 instead of 0.  And if you're using Vixie cron 
like everybody should be, then you can abbreviate that to this:

*/5 * * * * /path/to/script

> just started working. Maybe it's fixed.

Here's what it probably was:  Every crontab entry requires a newline 
character in order to run.  If you don't have one, the command won't run. 
So if that was the last line, you might not have had a blank line at the 
end.

I like 1.

How would you use the */n syntax to get two separate lines to interleave? 
I don't think he can do the abbreviation without a confusion of the two
scripts running separated by a 2-3 minute gap.

The test lines I added at your recommendation probably never were
broken. The lights in question are not in the same room as this
computer. I notice when the living room light goes on because it has a
compact fluorescent bulb in it, and thus has to have an X10 appliance
module instead of a lamp module, and the relay in the appliance module
makes an audible click when it switches. I probably just didn't notice
it while I was concentrating on understanding what I was doing. Once I
did notice it, I noticed that it was working every few minutes.

I suspect Jeme's idea of not having a newline character was the problem
with my first test. I can't prove it now, but I'm pretty sure there
wasn't one until I changed the test to run every few minutes. That makes
more sense than my guess that cron took a few minutes to register the
change, and I had only left one between the time I made the change and
the time it was supposed to take effect.

I guess I'll really know this evening when the lights come on at 6:30.

Thanks to all for you help.

I didn't see anything that said how to edit /etc/crontab. I went ahead
and changed the mailto instruction getting into it with Kate. I guess
I'll have to wait for some odd e-mail to turn up. There's not much going
on in that file, anyway.

What's your NameVirtualHost setting?

If tire can resolve to an address other than that specified with the 
NameVirtualHost directive, it'll be served up by the main server 
settings.

Can anyone recommend an AP for use with dd-wrt that does a good job of
p2p 11a links?  Is configuration as easy with 11a in the GUI (channel
selection, site surveys)?

I'm looking to bridge some buildings together in a heavily used 11g
zone.  dd-wrt on a Bufallo WHR-G125 has exceeded my expectations, but
doesn't do 11a.

Oh, it says in there (at least on Debian) that the cron daemon watches 
that file for changes... so no special editing tool is necessarily to 
update the daemon and tell it to reread the file.

You can always test it.  All standard output from cron goes to the mailto 
recipient (or the user whose crontab requires the action).  You can just 
do something like:
* * * * * echo "This worked, right?"

Or something like that.  The idea is clear, I think.

One thing to remember is that if you have commands with output, you're 
going to want to redirect their output to /dev/null if you're putting it 
in in cron and don't want to see a bunch of email every five minutes or 
whatever.

Yeah, it's buried in one of the man pages, but it'll trip you up when 
adding test lines to the bottom of a crontab.  Best to just leave a blank 
line at the bottom always (or ten).

I don't know specifically about dd-wrt, as I am more of an openwrt
guy.  But, if you can find a supported device with a mini-pci slot,
you can buy a couple atheros cm9 cards that do a/b/g, and then
configure madwifi-ng for WDS.  I have done quite a bit of that.  Note
that I have no experience doing WEP or WPA over such links.

I have used now-EOL'd Netgear WGT634U's for such things.  For a bit
more money, you can use Soekris boards, like the net4826 in an outdoor
enclosure at each end.  Total hardware costs using the Soekris
approach is around $700 (including both ends).  If you can find them,
the WGT634U would save you $200 or so, but probably not be quite as
robust.

It does not.

However, while reading docs I came across the advice to run `apache2 -S` to
see how the config files are being generated and

tire:/etc/apache2/sites-enabled# /usr/sbin/apache2 -S
VirtualHost configuration:
wildcard NameVirtualHosts and _default_ servers:
*:80                   is a NameVirtualHost
         default server tire.patch.com (/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default:2)

         port 80 namevhost wiki.patch.com (/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/wiki.patch.com:2)

So the default is the name associated with the hostname even if you have a separate namehost defined? 
I'll have to try this out on another physical server.

If you have a .forward file in the user's home directory, and it
contains a list of email addresses, cron will deliver to those instead
of (or perhaps in addition to?) the one in the MAILER environment
variable (which is set in /etc/crontab).  This is a handy way to get
the cron mail to multiple recipients.

If you use vim to edit files, it always puts an EOF at the end,
guaranteed.  In fact, I'd like to know how to turn that off.  Is it
possible?

I probably should have spread the word on this talk beforehand,
but I didn't know whether it would be good or Linux oriented.

  Topic:   GPU Parallel Computing 
  Speaker: John Nickolls,  Nvidia
  When:    Thursday, September 20, 2007
  Time:    6:00 PM ~ 8:30 PM  

About 200 people showed up - mostly Intel folk.

It was an amazing talk.  The speaker from Nvidia talked about
the hardware (Ge8800, 128 processing elements, 12,288 simultaneous
threads, 500 Gflops, 170 watts at full speed) and the software (an
extended version of C called CUDA, which works by defining a 
processing thread in a routine, input and output data arrays, then
instructing the CPU/GPU combination to go crunch on it. 

The language is available for free, but I don't think it is open.
There are versions of the tools that run under Linux. 


The slides are not available yet, but I expect them to be linked
to at: http://www.ieee.or.com/pastprograms.html.  The Nvidia
CUDA website is here: http://developer.nvidia.com/CUDA .

Not bad for a $300 mass market video card.  Now if only the hardware
and software was more open ...

How does 128 processing elements translate or compare to the cores we know of
in our primary processors.

And the solution to the problem defined below:

Insert a ServerName directive in the 000-default file with a bogus hostname.
With no ServerName directive Apache uses hostname. (I think. This is not
confirmed.)

Note the documentation says:

  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#namevirtualhost
  Note, that the "main server" and any _default_ servers will never be served
  for a request to a NameVirtualHost IP address (unless for some reason you
  specify NameVirtualHost but then don't define any VirtualHosts for that
  address).

About that hypothesis:

  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/vhosts/name-based.html
  The DocumentRoot from the main server will never be used when an IP address
  matches the NameVirtualHost directive. If you would like to have a special
  configuration for requests that do not match any particular virtual host,
  simply put that configuration in a <VirtualHost>  container and list it
  first in the configuration file.

That VirtualHost block must contain a ServerName directive OR the hostname of
the box will be used. This I have confirmed through experimentation.

I recall this to be the case, yes.  I can't use www.stonehenge.com as a named
virtual host because it also happens to be the "server" name.

It's probably not a good idea to rely on docs for apache 1.3 to
configure apache 2.2.

I just checked a few of our servers, and the main hostname of the
machine was in a virtual host on each.  "HostnameLookups Off" was on
on each, and I'm not sure if that matters.  Something to keep in mind
with apache configuration directories is that the files are loaded in
alphabetical (ASCIIbetical?) order.  The order that configuration
directives are loaded matters.  For example if you have 3 virtual
hosts in this order...

blog.example.com
*.example.com
wiki.example.com

Then blog.example.com will load correctly, and wiki.example.com will
load whatever is setup for *.example.com.

I would look at the default file, and try to comment out anything that
looks like a virtual host if you can as it is getting loaded first.

IIRC,  they are a floating point unit, integer unit, and transcendental
unit (sin/cos/exp/sqrt), very heavily pipelined, running in an SIMD
(Single Instruction Multiple Data) group of 16 processing elements.
No branching, much less any speculative execution, at the group level.
Many data sets are in the pipeline at once; at the system level, it
looks like hundreds of separate pipes.  Higher level organization of
data, branching, etc. is mostly handled by the main CPU.  The data
flow between the units is "fast divided by many" so the effective
clock rate of the threads is in the 10s to 100s of MHz.

Obviously, if the algorithm is inherently sequential, or sparse (like
some kinds of FFT, or some circuit simulators), then this very heavily
parallel computation unit will not be used efficiently.  But most things
aren't that sequential or sparse, and for processing that will map to a
grid (graphics rendering is obvious, but real time fluid dynamics and
medical tomography were two spectacular animations shown).  In
semiconductors, there is a computation process called "Resolution 
Enhancement Technology" which does complex optical modelling and 
optimization on terapixel grids, and this will reduce compute time
enormously, making silicon photolithography cheaper.

The most amazing thing to me is that the Earth Computer is 40 teraflops,
and 80 of these devices (for $25K) could do much the same thing.  Or 24
will do the work of Peter Jacksons two WETA computers (12Tflops) that
rendered Lord of the Rings.  And Nvidia claims to be doubling the
performance per dollar (and per watt) every year.   In October, Nvidia
will release Tesla, 1U rack box with 4 of the Nvidia processors in it;
at 2Teraflop each, one of these racks moves its owner briefly into the
top 500 supercomputer list.

This is going to change things ...

But that's going to forward ALL of your local mail to those recipients. 
Better to just create a local mail alias for the list and set the mailto

Message-ID: <46F5A910.50807@gmail.com>

Hello all,

Are there any scriptable tools for resizing vfat filesystems?

I've used resize2fs and ntfsresize to expand and shrink ext2/3 and NTFS 
filesystems.  However, I have not been able to find a similar tool for 
resizing vfat filesystems.  In days gone by there used to be a program 
called fips:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_%28computer_program%29

But that seems to have fallen out of use.

Yep, things are changing.  I'm a bit biased (since I work there), but
if you haven't already seen Intel's 80-core demo, 1Tflop at 40 watts,
then check it out here:

One of the main challenges now is how to effectively *use* that
computing power in software in a way that benefits the typical end
user.

Message-ID: <e2aeccd60709231551h3473e8bcu3fd2f4f508551f30@mail.gmail.com>

Howdy Pluggers,
I have a Seagate external hard drive I'm trying to troubleshoot. A few
months back the enclosure started having troubles powering up while a friend
was borrowing it. She took it to a shop and they disassembled the enclosure
and claimed that was the issue, that the drive itself is fine. I got the
bare drive back and bought another enclosure and there still seems to be
issues. When I plug the power cable on the drive into the enclosure the
enclosure will not power on at all. If I disconnect the drive power you can
see the lights on the enclosure come back on, plug it in and they turn off.
I have visually inspected the drive and smelled it for any ozone/burning
smell and it seems to be in good order there. I don't have a desktop machine
so I'm unable to test it with a beefier power supply then what comes with
these external enclosures these days so I'm looking for suggestions on what
I might be able to do to test with the enclosure. When everything is plugged
in I put a meter on the wires and probe and all the values appear to be
correct from the specs for both the drive itself and for the enclosure.

Any ideas? I'd really hate to lose the data on the drive. If some kind soul
has a desktop box that I can borrow or come visit and pop in real quick to
test that would be cool, I'd even bring the beer :-)

Cheers,
Drew-

is soaking in warm water as I type.

I believe I left my wireless card.  I have yet to put a label on it and I

That was just a great weekend for basketball :-)

Anyway, *THIS* is the video I was talking about, showing 1Tflop at
just under 40 watts (the link above shows 60 watts from a much earlier
demo).

Like was said before, your googling stinks.

This is the second link down in a search for  "W95Y2K.EXE download"
And I have successfully downloaded it.

What kind is it?  We can look in our own stuff for it;  if it stayed
at free geek, and did not make it into the clinic cablinet, it probably
won't be found, sigh.

That is exciting, though as a chip designer I should caution folks
that it is misleading to compare lab prototype results with delivered
product results.  The Intel chip is not a released product (and given
the die size, it is unlikely to be, as-is) while the Nvidia product
is available for purchase.  If Nvidia's trend line of 2x performance
per year improvement is accurate, then we can expect that they are
evaluating >1Tflop prototypes themselves, right now.

On the other hand, Intel will always have better manufacturing than
Nvidia, so I expect them to develop an advantage if they enter the
desktop supercomputer market.  

On the grippling hand, it is really AMD/ATI versus Intel and Nvidia,
and I would guess that Intel and Nvidia will develop a partnership in
this area .  I hope they agree to use the same parallel programming
source language ( CUDA? ) so that software is portable between products.
The most important message from the Nvidia presentation is that the
CUDA compiler produces object code that works on their entire product
line - no recompiles for low and high end, old and new products. 
While I don't expect Intel and Nvidia to be binary compatable, it
would be nice if they were source-code compatable.

It may be no coincidence that Nvidia gave their presentation at the
same time that Intel is holding big internal meetings about future
direction setting (which is why there were so many Intel folk in
town for that talk, from what I overheard).

Welcome to the Teraflop sweepstakes.  Start your engines ...

Dang.  I didn't see it.  I'd be happy to replace it.

Incidentally, SurplusGizmos has used 802.11B and 802.11A cards for $5 or
so.  They also have USB ones a bit smaller than a pack of playing cards,
with a flip-up antenna and a cable, for $10.  I just tested one with my
Ubuntu 7.04 system and it worked nicely.  One can stick it in the window
and connect to MetroFi from inside your house.

Parted should cover it.  I think it has FAT32/VFAT support built-in.

Here's a bit more detail of what I'm trying to do.  On Ubuntu as root, I 
use the following scripts to demonstrate creating, expanding, and 
resizing filesystems in a file:

# creating, expanding, and shrinking an NTFS image
dd bs=1M count=30 if=/dev/zero of=ntfs.img
loop=$(losetup -f)
losetup $loop ntfs.img
mkfs.ntfs $loop
losetup -d $loop
dd bs=1M count=30 if=/dev/zero >> ntfs.img
ntfsresize -fi ntfs.img             # query
ntfsresize -f ntfs.img              # expand
ntfsresize -fi ntfs.img             # query
yes | ntfsresize -f -s 30M ntfs.img # shrink
ntfsresize -fi ntfs.img             # query


# creating and expanding an ext3 image
dd bs=1M count=30 if=/dev/zero of=ext3.img
mkfs.ext3 -F ext3.img
dd bs=1M count=30 if=/dev/zero >> ext3.img
tune2fs -l ext3.img  | grep -e ^Block -e ^Free  # query
resize2fs ext3.img                              # expand
tune2fs -l ext3.img  | grep -e ^Block -e ^Free  # query
resize2fs ext3.img 30000                        # shrink
tune2fs -l ext3.img  | grep -e ^Block -e ^Free  # query

I'm now looking for an equivalent set of commands for operating on vfat 
filesystems and haven't found anything.  Unfortunately, when I try 
parted, it doesn't work:

dd bs=1M count=30 if=/dev/zero of=vfat.img
mkfs.vfat -F 32 vfat.img
dd bs=1M count=30 if=/dev/zero >> vfat.img
parted vfat.img unit b print        # query
parted vfat.img resize 1 0M 62M     # expand

You found a bug in GNU Parted! Here's what you have to do:

Don't panic! The bug has most likely not affected any of your data.
Help us to fix this bug by doing the following:

Check whether the bug has already been fixed by checking
the last version of GNU Parted that you can find at:

         http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/parted/

Please check this version prior to bug reporting.

If this has not been fixed yet or if you don't know how to check,
please visit the GNU Parted website:

         http://www.gnu.org/software/parted

for further information.

Your report should contain the version of this release (1.7.1)
along with the error message below, the output of

         parted DEVICE unit co print unit s print

and additional information about your setup you consider important.

There are no possible configurations for this FAT type.

Ignore/Cancel?


I'm guessing that parted doesn't understand that a filesystem can be 
smaller than the partition/image containing it.  Or my version is a bit 
too old, given that the current version is 1.8.8.

Regards,
- Robert

Thank you for going and reporting!  I ended up missing that one although
I really wanted to go.  (I felt like it was outside my areas of
interest, but I realize now that power engineers have applications for
parallel computing resources too.)

I'm curious to know what the Itanium guys think of this stuff.

With this and the PlayStation3, it's like Transputer all over again.

I'm gonna guess that programmers, computer scientists and mathematicians
who really get parallelization are becoming a very scarce and valuable
resource, especially in computational chemistry and bioinformatics.

As a follow up to my Apache issue last week I've been corresponding with the
Apache documentation group.  This has lead to the assertion that the default
Apache config in Ubuntu (and presumably Debian) has a bug.

If you run Ubuntu and have a fairly vanilla Apache install could you please run
the following commands and send the output to me?

  grep ServerName /etc/apache2/apache.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default

If you have manually added a ServerName directive to your configuration it no
longer fits the "fairly vanilla" profile I'm looking for.

Thanks...

That's apache2.conf                    ^

That produced no output.
I *think* I had manually added the following, and never removed a
ServerName directive from apache2.conf or 000-default:
grep -c ServerName /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

What are you looking for?

Subject: [PLUG] I need your help
Message-ID: <567076.1190.qm@web511.biz.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

This message is for anyone who wants to help.

My name is Justin Breithaupt and I live in uncharted Linux area known as the Inland Northwest Counsel in Boyscout ease. I'm in South East Washington. The farmers are scared of computer education for some reason. No one will sponsor it. But I just started after 6 years of trying and here is what I've got so far https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WA-Pomeroy . What I really need is someone from a different area who does help sponsor Linux to help me to afford my $600.00 a month expansion plan to move into a large building where I can use all 24 of my computers instead of just 3. Also that $600 covers utilities and rent. If someone wanted to buy it out for me they would need to call 1-509-830-8090. You could also pay him directly for rent and utilities if you want to take the burden off of me to make it look like I'm using the money for unjust causes. and believe me people in this town would love to point the finger at me and say that. I hope we get more members next week. We need someone
 to promote us to Lewiston, Clarkston, Asotin, and other surrounding areas. If I had this building I could operate my personal buisness out of a corner and expand my business enough to where I could stay and teach while my evil minions I mean computer technicians went out and did computer work. I want to convert Lewiston and Clarkston and the surrounding area to Linux. Not only will this benefit my business but it will benefit my community as well. I also want the Boy Scouts to be able to store their stuff in the building because I'm an Assistant Scout Master and Eagle Scout. I want my home troop to store their camping stuff there. This will improve the reputation from the public eye too. That should help keep me in the clear. 

I need two other things. I need non profit status. 

I also need a lawyer to defend me against paypal. I haven't found one who can yet. I have a recording of Paypal admitting they tried to deceive me and the only motive behind that would be for them to get money. I'm out $909+ thanks to them.

Any help appreciated.

I'm of the impression that the Ubuntu install does not place a ServerName
directive in the apache[2].conf or the 000-default files.  I'm looking for
confirmation or refutation.

I think in this case you were either unknowingly relying on a bug in fips,
or fips was changing the format to FAT12 silently. Parted can only handle
volumes as small as 33MB, the lower bounds of FAT16/32. If you increase your
file size, your demo will work. I just tested it replacing "count=30" with
"count=300" and everything was shiny, apart from a warning that the volume
will be converted from FAT32 to FAT16, which for a volume that size is the
"right" thing to do.

That seemed to work.  I didn't even get the message you mention.  Here's 
what I did:

dd bs=1M count=300 if=/dev/zero of=vfat.img
mkfs.vfat -F 32 vfat.img
dd bs=1M count=300 if=/dev/zero >> vfat.img
parted vfat.img unit b print         # query
parted vfat.img resize 1 0M 500M     # expand

Now to spend some time finding the lower limits of what works.  And 
finding an easy way to query the filesystem size and not just the 
partition size, which I know from the image size.

Thanks for your help, Quentin.

Subject: [PLUG] Print from Knoppix live CD
Message-ID: <20070924203643.a6cbbd36.johnxj@comcast.net>

The problem:

I can't scan from Feisty because the recent kernel added USB-suspend,
which broke my USB scanner. The problem supposedly will be fixed in
Gutsy. Since I don't need to scan very often, the simplest solution is
to wait for Gutsy, and if I need to scan now, fire up Knoppix 5.0 and
scan from it. Knoppix is cool because it is easy to mount my regular
drive. 

However, today I needed to scan several dozen pages and I need to print
the scans - basically using the scanner as a copy machine. I could save
all the scans, reboot to my usual Feisty installation, and then print
from there. The problem with this is adjusting the scan in case the
printout is not clear. Having to reboot twice just to try a different
scanner setting would be ridiculous. I tried to print directly from
Knoppix, but something is wrong with CUPS in Knoppix. The error message
is that it can't find some list of printers that it thinks it needs,
therefore Add Printer does not work. I can ping my networked printer
OK, I just can't print to it from Knoppix; i.e., the network is fine. I
also get error messages with lp commands.

The printer in question is an old networked Laserjet 5Si (identical to
the one at Free Geek). Does anyone know how to get a Knoppix live CD to
print to it?

Is anyone interested in a Canon PC 1080F (fax / copier combo) with a
broken roller?  That's really all I know about it.... it's apparently
not worth paying someone to fix, but it did *just* get a new toner
($139), and it doesn't seem to hard to fix, for someone with the
desire and know-how.  If nothing else, it'd be a great parts machine.

If you want it, it's yours -- it's got to be gone by Monday though.
(Either pick-up on Sauvie Island, or I'll put you in contact with my
parents, who need to get rid of it and you can work out a different
place to meet.)  Who wouldn't want to take a drive out to Sauvie
Island this Saturday though? Pick up some locally-grown pumpkins,
corn, winter squash and pet something at the pumpkin patch ;)

Thanks for the Note!!

The copier/fax is Canon PC 1080F and it has a fairly new toner in it as well
($139...grrrrr.)

Let me know -  I suppose I could put it on Craigs list but that is more
bother than I have time.

If it's OK with you,  I could forward this to FreeGeek, and maybe someone
there who
lives out Sauvie Island way could pick it up.

That's fine with me -- although we have a number of other things that
need to either find homes or go to Free Geek, and IIRC, Free Geek
doesn't want the Canon (it's not a printer).

You're right.  They take fax machines, but not copiers;  I  guess the copier
wins out in this case.

Subject: [PLUG] nVIDIA drivers
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0709260655230.11038@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Every time I need to halt the server/workstation with the new motherboard
and built-in nVIDIA video chip, the darned proprietary driver disappears and
I need to re-install it from the downloaded file. Makes no sense to me and
it's a PITA, but that's what's happening.

   I tried the 'nv' module and discovered that the associated i2c module was
not built. So I changed the kernel's .config file to build all the nv helper
modules, ran 'make modules' and 'make modules_install', but it's nowhere to
be found. Given the weird behavior of the disappearing proprietary driver, I
wonder if installing that kills off the competition of the open source
driver.

   Running 'locate nv' returns no driver. I find the source files, but
nothing in /lib/modules/2.6.19.2/drivers/video/.

   I'll need to shut down this box this coming weekend to attach the new
cd-rw and a couple of case ports I missed when installing the new
motherboard. I'd like to have a working X driver when I reboot. Your advice,
suggestions, and recommendations will be helpful.

Message-ID: <46FAC110.2050908@acm.org>

I'm trying to get ssh_pam installed on a new CentOS 5 install and 
getting nowhere fast.  Done the Google searches, checked and added 
_other_ repositories, and posted to the CentOS forums.

Heck I even tried to compile from source but got some errors that I 
haven't  done much towards sorting out ... yet.

I'm hoping this is a path someone else has tread and can give me a 
solution or clue.

I just thought I'd check back in with a quick summary of my mythTV adventure.

The PVR-250 works great, but I would classify setting up mythtv as
"non-trivial".  Since I already have a very functional media pc, I
didn't want to start over with a Myth-specific distribution.  If
you're not comfortable compiling kernel drivers and moving files
around as root, then I'd strongly suggest starting with MythBuntu,
Mythdora, or something similar, and then turning that into a more
general media system.

My only other real nugget of advice is that if you've been watching HD
tv regularly, then spend a good chunk of time looking into the HD
options.  I didn't realize there was such a difference, having watched
very little non-HD in the past. (I've only owned a television since
January, so my experience is biased towards HD.)

There are also apparently no free xmltv listing services any more,
since DataDirect stopped hosting their feed early in September of this
year.  That service became SchedulesDirect -- a non-profit service
that just recently turned profitable (and is scaling down rates to
account for that).  They offer xml listings for $20 / 6-months, and
their goal is $30 / year.  You don't have to have a listing service,
but I highly recommend it.  The alternative is to manually enter all
the start/end recording times, titles, etc.

Setting everything up was a nostalgic pain in the ass ;) it brought
back memories of upgrading glibc by hand on Slackware in '99.
(Thankfully I didn't end up going back to Windows for two weeks this
time.)  The experience made me realize how far linux has come, and how
little I've noticed it's progress.  I expect things to work much
better now, forgetting how much of a pain these things used to be.
Then again, programming a vcr has *never* been straightforward ;)

I've worked with pam quite a bit, and with ssh some, but I'm afraid that
I've never heard of ssh_pam.  Nor did I find much when I did a google
search on it.  What is it, and what does it do?  It's possible that it's an
older package that was never upgraded to the newer distros.  But you
might be able to do whatever it is you need to do with a different package.

That's strange.  When I rebuilt my MythTV backend with a new kubuntu install
all I had to do to get mythtv working was:
aptitude install ivtv
aptitude install mythtv
mythtv-setup

I didn't have to do anything else to use mythtv with my PVR150 card.  On the
other hand the other tuner (cheap bttv card) never seems to work out of the
box with mythtv :-(

I probably should have referred to it as "pam_ssh" not as it is known in 
some of the packages.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/pam-ssh/

http://www.clasohm.com/blog/one-entry?entry_id=12085

I can't really explain it better than the second link does.  I've used 
it before on a Fedora Core 4 system.  Liked it a lot.  I have had to log 
into 10-15 systems in a day and many of them multiple times.  Beats 
typing my pass-phrase each time and I also don't have to leave the 
connection/login open when not working on the system.

Any reason not to use ssh-agent, or set up a kerberos server and use
tickets (TGT's) for this?

   I thought that PLUG-devel was still alive as a mail list; I was wrong
about this. I've also not had any responses on comp.lang.python to my post,
so, with your forebearance, I'm posting it here.

   I'm stymied by what should be a simple Python task: accessing the value of
a variable assigned in one module from within a second module. I wonder if
someone here can help clarify my thinking. I've re-read Chapter 16 (Module
Basics) in Lutz and Ascher's "Learning Python" but it's not working for me.

   In one module (the "source"), variablePage.py, three wxPython widgets
display values that are assigned to variables: curVar, UoDlow, and UoDhigh.
I want to display then in equivalent widgets on a wxPython notebook tab in a
different module, the "importer."

   At the top of the importer module I have:

from variablePage import curVar, UoDlow, UoDhigh

and I try to display the values of those variables in widgets on this page.
But, python complains:

     from variablePage import curVar, UoDlow, UoDhigh
ImportError: cannot import name curVar

   I've also tried

import variablePage as VP

   and referenced the variables as VP.curVar, VP.UoDlow, and VP.UoDhigh, but
python still doesn't like this:

   File "/data1/eikos/fuzSetPage.py", line 364, in loadParVar
     first = VP.curVar
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'curVar'

   Both of these forms are used in the book (pages 260-261) in simple
examples. I also get errors if I try importing using the class name before
the variable name.

   A clue stick would be very helpful since I am not seeing just what I'm
doing incorrectly.

In the "source", how/where are curVar, UoDlow, and UoDhigh defined?
Are they at the top level, or are they scoped in some way (instance
vars of a class, method vars, ...)?

This is used to import modules and their assorted classes, not move
instances of those objects (AKA variables and their contents) around.
Remember that python is fully object-oriented, so your "variable" is an
instance of an object of some kind. In order to look at the value of that
object, the object itself needs to be passed to some other object that was
created with your other module.

How I do things like this is that I have a sort of wrapper script that
imports all the modules I need to work with, and then the various objects
that are created for the program are handed around within that wrapper.
Usually, I create  a new instance of the object I want (a page) with the
object that has the data I want as an argument to that object. For a decent
example for how this works in python look at http://www.evolt.org/node/449

It's possible that there are other ways to do this like what you describe,
but I don't know them. I am a low-grade Python programmer on my best days,
so take this with a grain of salt, but it really sounds to me like you are
misunderstanding the idiom that Python uses here.

The Eugene Lug has a python-oriented mailing list. You can sign up for it at
http://www.euglug.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo . It is very low-traffic, but
several good programmers are on it and I have yet to see a question there go
unanswered.

Alex,

   They are the displayed contents of wxPython widgets in the class modVar().
I also tried importing the class as well as the module, but may not have had
that syntax correct either.

   More specifically, they are defined in variablePage.py, class modVar()'s
__init__() method. For example:

     self.vname = wx.ComboBox(self, wx.ID_ANY, size=wx.Size(175, 25),
                              style=wx.CB_DROPDOWN|wx.CB_SORT|
                              wx.TAB_TRAVERSAL|wx.RAISED_BORDER)

Python is telling you that the variables you're trying to import are
not at the root level of the module. Are they actually contained
within a class? Bear in mind that in Python, a "module" is just
container for source code. All sorts of data structures can live
within a single module.

If 'curVar' is really a class attribute, you'll have to either import
the class:
  from variablePage import happyFunClass
  print happyFunClass.curVar

Or just import the entire module and access the class attribute the
long way:
  import variablePage
  print variablePage.happyFunClass.curVar

Quentin,

   That's just what I was trying to do.

   I have a generic module called 'config' that holds data I want to share
among modules. Today, I tried using it for this purpose when the imports
failed me, but that didn't work, either. I'll look at your example.

   Thank you, I will subscribe. My lack of understanding is related to python
in general, not specifically wxPython, so I did not think my question
appropriate for that mail list.

Paul,

   Hm-m. I _think_ that I tried this but I must not have had it correct.

   Ah, I did not have the full path (module.class.variable) when I tried
this.

   I'll give both a try.

Many thanks,

There's a mailing list, an IRC channel (#pdxpython on freenode), and

These appear to be instance variables, in which case you'll need to
have an instance of the class available before you can acces them.
Somewhere along the line (either in the wxPython code, or yours... I'm
unfamiliar with the workings of wxPython), something like the
following must occur:

  from variablePage import modVar
  foo = modVar( your_init_args_here... )

After that, you should be able to access the variables of
the "foo" instance of modVar, e.g., "print foo.appData.curVar".

Paul,

   They are instance variables. My understanding is that each instance is
created when I load the variables from the database tables. Perhaps they're
not directly available until all variables are loaded, and I don't get that
far before the error is thrown.

Thanks,

Rich

Pam_ssh uses ssh-agent.

I prefer the low hanging fruit to learning how to set up and use kerberos.

Subject: [PLUG] Looking for netboot rescue image
Message-ID: <20070928223702.GY18919@amethyst.spiritone.com>

My home network is set up to net-install Debian onto pxe-bootable
machines.  Unlike CD-based installers, net installers don't seem to
have a rescue mode -- or at least not one that doesn't need external
net access.  I'd like to download, or build, a self-sufficient
net-bootable rescue image.  Any suggested sources?

(Voyage Linux has a live CD that includes a netboot server that will
then serve up a working instance of Voyage -- not just an installer.
I'll try to extract that from the CD if there's no better starting
point.)

Thanks,

--Eric

_A_ way might be to symlink to the newer lib.

# ln -s /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6 /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.5

When doing this YMMV.

I've been following the threads here recently about different storage

bay disk SAN. There is no official linux support, however there is code out
there that works without the need for a new kernel model .. all free code. I
have had no problems formatting a disk as ext3 and copying files to and from
the device and its working well.

Best Buy is selling the device for 60 bucks on sale now.

"yum provides libstdc++.so.5" says:

compat-libstdc++-33

so "yum install compat-libstdc++-33"

WIKI:

The PLUG wiki has been up and stable for a month now;  there have been
excellent additions by Russell Senior and others.  Thanks, Wil, for
setting it up.

Perhaps it is time to link to the wiki from the main page, use it for
meeting announcements, etc.  Let's see what kind of abuse it gets by
making a link that the search engines can find:

http://www.pdxlinux.org/wiki

LIBRARY:

So far, there have been no requests for books in the PLUG library.
Please feel free to request books, or add books:  go to 

http://www.pdxlinux.org/wiki/PlugLibrary

... and learn how to use the library.  The books in my basement
aren't doing any good where they are, so borrow them!  If you are
looking for subjects the library doesn't yet have, add some of your
books to the list and help make the library more attractive to
others.  They might add the books *you* want.

I can bring requested books to the PLUG meeting on Thursday.  Let
me know by Weds. evening.

I have installed the "pxe knife"  ( http://pxeknife.erebor.org/ ) which 
provides some testing/rescue items.  It does not seem to be under active 
development anymore but it does provide a nice base that was pretty easy 
to get up and running. It includes the framework for booting Knoppix as 
well.  I moved the Knoppix booting to the top menu level and then added 
some additional environments to the menu (eg Ubuntu, ...)  I add more as 
what I have proves inadequate for a particular use.

I've discovered another constraint: no nfs.  The debian installer fits
everything it needs into the initrd file served up by the tftp server.
I guess building my rescue netboot image is simply a matter of seeing
how much I can squeeze into that file using mkinitramfs and its config
files.  (Assuming the initrd FS doesn't go away after boot time; still
trying to understand that...)

Thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] Booting Debian on Ebox 2300 with a 4G CF card
Message-ID: <20070930181739.GE18919@amethyst.spiritone.com>

We were talking about the Ebox 2300 a few months back.  I just spent a
bunch of time working around a bug in either grub or its BIOS and
wanted to document it somewhere, either for this group or for others
googling for answers.

The problem: grub and ebox 2300 are incompatible for 4 gig CF cards,
though 1G cards are fine.

What I tried: Debian (Etch) net install onto 1G card gave me a
bootable system every time (single partition filling the card except
for small swap partition which the installer insisted on creating
though it'd allow me later to tell it not to use it.)  Doing the same
install onto a 4G card, *or* dd-ing the contents of the working 1G
card onto the 4G card, gave me grub's error 25 while loading stage 1.5
every time.

So the problem is not that the 2300 refuses to launch grub.  Rather,
grub fails later.  Since it works with >4G cards and drives on other
systems it must be dependent on the bios for something it's not
getting where the card is above some size where 1G < size <= 4G.

The solution: boot off the 1G card and use apt-get to install, then
configure, lilo, replacing grub in the MBR.  dd the 1G image onto the
4G card, then after confirming that it boots mount it via a USB card
reader and use fdisk and resize2fs to allow the root partition to
include the missing 3 gig.

Hoping this helps someone,

--Eric

Interesting; there used to be a PORPIG group, but it never actually
seemed to go anywhere (partly, I think, because they redirected
technical questions to the main Python lists).

I don't have any immediate answers for you, but one of the handiest
tools for figuring out problems like this is the interactive
interpreter. The 'dir()' function and 'pprint.pprint()' can be very
helpful and exploring hierarchical classes and data structures. I would
do something like this:

$ python
...
>>> from pprint import pprint as pp
>>> import variablePage
>>> pp( dir( variablePage ) )

And see if the variables you are looking for are there. If not, you can
then explorer with pp(dir(variablePage.fooBar)) etc., inquire about
types, etc. (You could even use a 'for' loop and be iterate over the
variable names.)

Wil,

   I somehow ended up down the wrong path. When I realized this and backed up
to do it correctly, I fixed the problems. A combination of print stubs and
winpdb works well for me.

   I know the variables are there. What I managed to forget is that to move
variables among modules -- at least within the wxPython UI for the
application -- the use of a "blackboard" module (which I call config.py) is
the answer. I can write and read variables, lists, and other structures
(such as wx.lib.pub messages) and share them among modules.

Thanks for your input,

Rich
