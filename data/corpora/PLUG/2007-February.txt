Tim,

   Several years ago I bought my current notebook from Emperor Linux, and I
would do so again. They put on the distribution I wanted and we compromised
on the partitioning of the hard drive. Their support is excellent and they
have a range of brands and models from the very light (running StrongARM
processors) to desktop replacements that weigh about the same.

   Prior to that I had two Toshibas (a Libretto and a Portege) on which I
installed linux. While the Libretto was too small for me trying to
touch-type on the tiny keyboard, I still have the Portege which I'll use as
a communications device when I don't need a lot of computing power on the
road.

   We also have a 1999 vintage IBM ThinkPad 600E that has run a Debian
variant, Red Hat, and now Slackware. When I have the TFT screen's inverter
replaced, it will be back at work again -- without the external monitor.

Fry's will have this, though maybe not with a Core 2 Duo.  They're evil,
but they will take it back if it doesn't run Linux well enough.

I want one of these IFF virtualization is not disabled, as HP too
often does on consumer-grade machines.

If you buy a Lenovo, stick with the T-series and avoid the R-series.  I
have an old T20 that I bought off eBay that is still working (aside from
a dead battery), while 3 of 4 of the IBM-refurbished R40s we bought died
within two years.  I don't know anything about the other series.

The way it has been set up is creating a nasty problem.  When it is used
to go to the Internet, private services aren't accessible.  When the
original system it is supposed to back up is used, that system doesn't
have the VPN capabilities that this fancy shmancy router does and since
I am developing the original system to a certain degree, reliability is
an issue.

So my natural thought to avoid the issue of grabbing the wrong network
line and putting it to the other system is to set things up differently
so that the choice of system can be made on the host side without
touching patch cables in the server room.  I want to be able to switch
back and forth between these systems in events where an outage is not  
necessarily the reason to do so.  These systems are supposed to be in
parallel and it is hoped that at least one of them will always work.
My headache is, dhcp can't be used by both systems over the same media  
simultaneously, can it?  Putting in a second physical network line and
manual switches host side is a prohibitively expensive solution.  I
want to put an end to people unplugging the mains like yesterday.
This is too error prone, especially with all the patch cables in
the server room being the same color.

What is DMZ and do I want to mess with that on the Netgear router?

What is done in the professional IT world when you want to run routers in
parallel and you want them both to be able to use dhcp to configure the
same hosts on the same media?  I want to be able to choose either  
system regardless of whether or not one of them has failed to some  
degree.

A brutal software approach is to write a replacement for dhcp that
runs on the original system complete with client side software so that a
person can decide whether or not they want to ignore dhcp from the  
Netgear router and favor information from the original system instead.  
  Is this
the way I have to go to get what I'm after?

Tim,

   At the time I bought my Sony Vaio from them I paid $400 more than if I
bought the same model elsewhere and installed linux myself. Depending on how
you value your time, you may decide it's worth the price of having them
install and text linux so the box works when it arrives.

Any time you buy Sony, you are going to pay through the nose (or other 
orifaces).  If you don't overpay for the main system, you will for the 
accessories later.

Yes it can but you cannot have the router/firewalls providing the service.

Normally for redundancy it is setup quite differently than what most
people at home would have.

You have two routers doing something like VRRP where both of them have
share an IP address but also have a private IP address that is
normally out of band
for management.  DHCP and TFTP would be used by the routers to grab
configurations
for startup.

This is an area or range of addresses that bypass the firewall rules such that
any internet traffic can get to these addresses.  The Netgear router
(and most others)
support this but it is easily exploited by bouncing traffic off one of
these DMZ addresses
to other boxes.  This is because these DMZ addresses are on the same network
address range as the rest of your network.

My rule of thumb for Linux Laptops is whatever T series Thinkpad is currently
available for around $500 on eBay.

I have a T21 and a T23.  Both provide trouble free operations.  I did go through a
scare with the T21, but it was a false alarm.  Oh, shucks, now I have two
notebooks.

Wil and others have commented on T series suitability.  Is that price good for you?

As for the tightwad in all of us you may consider Whitebooks. I have been running a Sabio Digital Whitebook for a year or two and it works great! I dual boot Windows and Ubuntu and I have had no problems with it. With the last few releases of Ubuntu everything on the laptop works straight out of the gate. We also purchase another brand of whitebook now called Compal. I have not tried linux on the compals... Nice thing about whitebooks is they tend to cost half or one third the cost of Name Brand.

One other issue to consider - if you're interested in Virtualization - 
VT (Xen, KVM), watch the CPU. Only some "Core Duo", "Core 2 Duo", and
"Pacifica" CPUs support VT. 

And many laptop mfrs disable VT - as I just noted on the Xen list

Many laptop mfrs disable VT, even if the Intel CPU supports it (AMD
VT-capable systems can't have VT disabled). There's a long HP thread on
the topic (which is also covered in /.)
http://forums.itrc.hp.com/service/forums/bizsupport/questionanswer.do?threadId=1051601

There are also interesting Wikis on the topic

I have considered creating a thumb drive based distro that has the sole 
purpose of telling you what hardware is on a machine, cpu features, etc. 
to help people when buying machines or for diagnostics.  It would make it 
much easier to tell what a machine really contains or does at the store 
instead of believing sales people.

Look at the CPU numbers to find which ones support VT:

http://www.intel.com/products/processor_number/index.htm

Many vendors disable VT by default, but allow you to enable it in the
BIOS.  Consider the default disable of VT to be an example of
disabling a service unless you need it, which follows with security
best practices.

I've had a T21 and a T42.  Both were excellent.  At the time I was
running Debian potato on the T21, and Ubuntu Breezy on the T42.
Everything was supported nicely.  Both were paid for by employer.

Purchasing my own, I've had a T30 (P4), and now an HP NC6220.  The T30
was thick compared to other T's.  XVGA+ is a minimum requirement for my
laptops (1440x1050), which makes it a big more difficult to find used
laptops.

When I hit Ebay, I found the NC6220 was a better deal than the IBM T's
(T43's).  They are similar in profile, features and weight, with the HP
having a more standard keyboard layout (CTRL-ALT is normal vs. the IBM..
though the IBM does eliminate that windows keys).  The HP also has the
mouse-nub like an IBM, which I prefer over the touchpad.

Where a T43 used with SXGA+ was fetching $1000-1200 at the time (a year
ago), I've picked up two NC6220's for $700-900 (1GB RAM, 60GB HD, Intel
b/g wireless).

After wading through all the Vista promotional crap at the entrance to
CompUSA yesterday, I did see a T60 on display.  Looks like they are even
thinner and lighter.  It will be a while before they hit the used market. :)

Anyone running Dapper on Turion laptops?  I like AMD, and have been
keeping an eye on Turion gear.

Alan, just asking - 

What would be the advantage of a thumb drive over say a Knoppix
CD/DVD-based OS? I suppose being able to boot from a thumb drive would
make the VT check faster.

I can tell you one strange thing about those IBM Lenova laptops, they are
really temperamental about working with Minicom for serial console
connections (like to Cisco devices).  For that reason I have opted to not
use them as other vendor laptops work no problems with Minicom.  I suppose
its all about what you are going to use it for primarily.

Concerning ThinkPads, the engineers at work have had good luck running 
Linux on a T41 (CentOS), a T60 (Gentoo), and an X31 (Debian). I had an 
older T-series machine back at OGI, but I can't remember the specific 
model number.

That said, I've also had good luck with Linux on a variety of Dell 
Latitudes: D600, D620, D800. Debian and Ubuntu are particularly sweet 
on the Latitudes for some reason.

Installing Linux on *any* of these machines is usually much easier 
than installing Windows XP, which requires a ton of manufacturer's 
drivers to work properly.

I'm not running Dapper but Slackware on a Turion based laptop Acer 5102WLmi
and have had no problems.

A USB->Serial adapter ($9 at newegg.com) and GtkTerm work wonderfully
in those situations ;-)

Some laptops support only USB.

Here's a metaphor for ya:
The current settings for distances between railroad tracks in the US  
don't make sense, by themselves.

Why didn't they ever increase the distance to handle bigger cars?

Because that could require a change to bigger cars, oh, and every  
car, for *many* years, would have to be able to run on both tracks,  
until the "wider track" was done rolling out, with new tunnels,  
changes to paths to handle heavier weights, etc. It would take about  
30-50 years or so.

With computers, there's a smaller timeframe, but what we are seeing  
right now is railroad cars/hard drives that can work in both  
situations. Mostly the legacy support is all about BIOS, and OS's  
(and the occasional rare application) that still live in a world of  
386 communication. If you want to get into the tech details, study up  
on BIOS and how most X86 computers boot.

> Do Apple computers have far less legacy support than PCs in order to
> keep them simple and theoretically produce a more stable platform?

That's a two part question, really....

First part: Tried putting a boot floppy disk into a new Mac lately? :)
Superdrive (floppy): Dead.
Boot from a floppy: Dead.
Boot from motherboard SCSI: Dead.
NuBus (card spec): Dead.
PDS on the LC series (card spec): Dead.
68K OS code support (Past CPU type): Dead.
Early PPC chip support (Past CPU type): Dead.
Localtalk/RS-422 support (Past hardware networking): Dead

Mac OS and hardware shed old standards every few years. Windows/ 
Intel, OTOH, still supports original IDE...<shudder> (Two hard drives  
on a bus should be enough for everybody?)

Second part: While wintel has kept up support and compatibility with  
programs (and viruses) from the early 80's, the mac platform (now  
mactel, they've shifted major CPU architectures 3 times now) has  
always had users who are willing to throw away older programs *and*  
hardware. This does eliminate historical problems, but it adds the  
problem of "how stable is a platform that *can't* run my program"?

In the process, apple has gotten *really* good at hardware porting,  
and at the same time, selling new boxes. Much to the chagrin of, oh,  
Mac users of older equipment, who don't want to change.
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Apple_Macintosh_models>

Is it more stable? I would say yes, in the same sense that buying a  
new car every 5 years leads to more reliable personal transportation,  
and that a 10 year old car may, or may not, be finicky.

 Most likely it is the USB -> Serial Driver. I use the US232R serial -> 
USB device that is made with the FTDI serial chips. I have not found an 
application and device that will not work with the US232R on Mac, Linux or 
Windows as long as the proper driver is installed.

I've used Keyspan serial adapters on the IBM Thinkpad's without issue as
well.

It is 2007.  The problem has been solved for quite a while.

Because they couldn't.  The BIOS runs in 16-bit mode.  The registers
are only 16-bits wide.  For the INT 13 operation, the arguments are
packed into registers.  The cylinder (10 bits) and sector (6 bits) are
in one register.  And the head (8 bits) is in half of another.  The
reason for the 504 MiB limit with physical addressing is that IDE used
16/4/8 bites for C/H/S.  The combination means only 20-bits can be
used.

The solution was to translate from the logical addresses to physical
ones.  The physical geometry were pretty much fiction at that point.
The logical geometry was even more of a fiction.  Unfortunately, there
were multiple different schemes for the logical mapping and I remember
entering The limit there is the 24-bit space for CHS addresses.  That
was the 7.88 GiB barrier.

The 1024 cylinder limit is why grub or other bootloaders needed a boot
partition at the beginning of the disk.  Once the kernel was loaded
and started running in 32-bit mode, it bypasses the BIOS and talks
directly to the disks.  ATA-2 introduced 28-bit logical block
addressing which can address up to 128 GiB.  Later ATA standard went
to 48-bit LBA.

Since the existing operation couldn't be extended any further, they
had to add a new operation.  Instead of using the cylinder-head-sector
fiction, they went to logical block addressing.  I think the INT13
extensions support up to 64-bit sector addresses.  BIOSes and boot
loaders have supported LBA mode for a few years.

You don't need to worry about it anymore.  I haven't had to manually
set the geometry of a drive in the BIOS in a long time.  My impression
is that all modern computers have the BIOS extensions and don't need
to worry about the 1024 cylinder limit for boot partitions.  I think
there is a 32-bit sector limit in the MBR partition table.  That 2 TiB
is a problem for some people.

The issue now is the replacement of BIOS and MBR.  The Intel Macs use
EFI as the firmware instead of BIOS.  They include a BIOS
compatibility layer so that Windows can boot.  EFI uses the GUID
Partition Table (GPT).  There is a legacy MBR which can by synced with
the GPT to have the same partitioning scheme.

My Nokia N800 comes next week so I'm getting tuned up to have some fun. 
  Found a site 2blocksaway.com that has instruction on customizing the 
N800 and it requires dpkg to build the packages ... go figure.

I've done some searching but can't determine if there is a way to get 
dpkg installed on a Fedora Core (6) system so I can do some 
customization and development.

Any ideas, YUM repositories, site with information on using dpkg on 
non-debian systems?

No, it won't break yum, but it might not do what you expect.  Yum and
Apt are tools layered on top of dpkg and rpm; if building or
manipulating debs is what you want, you might instead try virtualization
and run an instance of Debian inside a VM.  Probably the easiest for you
to get going would be the free-beer VMware Server.  (You might even be
able to find a pre-built VM that's a Maemo development environment.)
The closer you can get to developing on the same platform the main
developers are on, the better off you'll be.

There are alternatives to cutting off your neighbors completely.  You
can do traffic shaping instead.  That lets you share without
completely slamming your connection.  Or just get more bandwidth.
Sharing is good and fun and orthogonal to security.

BTW, Personal Telco had one of the NetEquality guys talk at our
January Monthly Meeting last week.  We are hoping to get their
technical guy to talk at a future PTP meeting.

The Meraki networks are based on a technology developed at MIT called
RoofNet.  As of a few years ago, it was running on relatively cheap
wireless access points called a Netgear WGT634U.  I've got a 5-node
neighborhood network running on those right now.  However, the WGTs
were EOL'd about 18 months ago and the supply has dried up.  Meraki
developed some new hardware specifically to support their needs, the
Meraki mini.  It has similar RAM and Flash specs to the WGT, and beta
versions became available last summer.  They are hoping to launch next
month.

NetEquality is focused on bridging the digital divide, but are too
small to help people get trained on using computers.  One of the ideas
floated at the PTP meeting was running some kind of clinic out in the
housing developments where these networks have been deployed to help
the residents work out their technical problems.  The FreeGeek model
(volunteer-at-FreeGeek-to-get-computer) didn't seem to be well-adapted
to this particular need.  PLUG members might be well-suited to help
out.

I'm trying to set up two installations of horde 3 using the same database.

Well, my second installation so far omits the sidebar where I just get a
white patch instead.

I'm getting lost trying to track this issue down by googling.

I'm using CentOS 4.3 that has most likely been updated to 4.4 by now.

I can check to see if the pecl extensions match on both systems.  I
have all the same pear extensions, though there appear to be some
version differences.

Subject: [PLUG] Postgresql on NFS root box...
Message-ID: <20070203192714.muiifw2xwggc4gog@web.robinson-west.com>

Well, I have postgresql-7.14.3 server running on Slackware 10.1
using an init script of all things that came with the source code,
modified of course for everything being stuffed under /opt.

Okay, what happens when the processor on this NFS root system loses
power?  The filesystem, an NFS volume, will most likely stay up.

So what are the cases for what might be happening when the NFS root
box loses power?  How do transactions work and what happens when they
are interrupted?  The filesystem the NFS root box is using should
still be alive.  On the NFS server, I want to be able to restore a
snapshot of the database prior to the last attempted change
automatically, if that is needed.

Should I periodically create a tar bzipped archive of the database
and in the boot process restore the last trusted image?  If so,
how should I go about this?  Bash daemon?

If I have to add a battery to the NFS root box, that kinda defeats
the whole point of not having a hard drive installed.  A battery
though may give me a chance to keep the NFS root box up for a few
minutes in an outage allowing proper shutdown of the database and
other services.  Dansguardian and apache seem to come back just fine
if I hit the reset button on the NFS root box, but I highly suspect
that postgres may not.

Is there a way for postgres to mirror it's changes to another
postgres box running the exact same database?

Runlevel 1 and shutdown/reboot commands need to be replaced
on an NFS root box because you will hang the machine if you down
the network interface.  Anyone know how to replace the standard
shutdown/reboot procedures and runlevel 1?

For those who are about to say google, how could I efficiently google
for relevant information about preparing for power outages on an NFS
root box?

I am happy to see more schools use Linux in their Academic schedule. 
Especially to the point of employing different servers. I have taken the 
Linux Courses at Portland Community College and although excellent 
courses, I was disappointed that there was not much focus on server 
deployment. The classes do give a good basic knowledge of Linux and 
System Administration of Linux, but left most of the details of server 
configurations to finding them with Google Linux or posting on PLUG to 
find answers. Although a good lesson in how to find the information you 
need to locate there is still a lot of information left out concerning 
editing configuration files for servers.

Thanks
Randy

Russell,

This brings into focus a question I have had for some time.  Won't the ISP's 
financial interests urge them to seek ways to limit multi-family access?  My ISP 
gets $18/mo from me and from each of my neighbors.  It is easy to see that 
$18/house goes away with these schemes.

This must have come up already.  Can you point to some discussions?

If you are behind a NATing router/firewall, the ISP will have a
difficult time proving that
you are sharing the resource.  They don't have limits on the number of computers
accessing the resource as long as it is all through one IP address.

Furthermore, there are ISPs that are officially okay with you sharing
your connection.  There are four that come to mind, in no particular
order:

  Easystreet
  Stephouse Networks
  Integra Telecom
  Speakeasy

You might think that it runs counter to their interests (Comcast and
Verizon agree), but:

 a) they might not be able to police the sharing if they wanted to;

 b) having such policies actually drives business to them that might
    go elsewhere.

Not only are some of these ISPs supportive in their sharing-friendly
policies, but some of them (the local ones) go out of their way to be
even more supportive of the Personal Telco Project:

 * Easystreet donates the internet connection for our landmark node,
   at Pioneer Square;

 * Stephouse donates the internet connection for our neighborhood-wide
   Mississippi Avenue project;

 * Integra provides free colocation for one of our servers.

There may well be others that I am not fully aware of.  What goes
around, comes around.  These ISPs certainly have our warm feelings as
a result.

Easier to carry.  I can fit a thumb drive into my pocket much easier than a
CD/DVD.  (Without hearing that snapping/crunching noise.)

Subject: [PLUG] netinstall ubuntu on powerpc?
Message-ID: <45C792FA.3040409@hevanet.com>

I'm trying to figure out network installation for ubuntu.  I'm using Dapper
on a pc as the tftp server, and the target is an iMac G3/350.  The dhcp 
server
is a LinkSys router.  The installation media is a loop mounted 
alternate-powerpc
iso image of feisty/herd3.

I have gotten as far as having the first few steps of the installation 
dialog
succeed, but when it gets to the part about detecting the CD, the dialog 
fails,
because, of course, there is no CD in the drive.   I can skip that step, 
but then
the dialog fails to find the preseed file, and the process goes back 
into a loop
trying to detect the CD.

I'm not sure if this is one problem or two.  I'm pretty sure I have missed
something about specifying that there is no CD, but that the installation
source the tftp host, and I'm not sure whether solving this would affect
the yaboot.conf kernel boot parameter that specifies the preseed file
location.

What I've done so far has been cobbled together from various articles
in forums and wikis, mostly aimed at i386.  iMac netboot is started
successfully from OpenFirmware with "boot enet:<host-ip-address>,yaboot".

Any suggestions?


More detail:
1. tftp host uses xinetd in inetd_compat mode; tftp service is specified in
/etc/inted.conf

2. tftp root is /srv/tftp (tftpd installation provided that)

3. yaboot and yaboot.conf are in /srv/tftp on the host

4. the iso is loop mounted on /srv/tftp/cdrom on the host

5. So /srv/tftp looks like this:
   dr-xr-xr-x 11 root root      2048   2007-02-01    01:08 cdrom
   -r--r--r--       1 root root  153056  2006-07-25    07:02 yaboot
   -rw-r--r--     1 root root       4072 2007-02-05    11:58 yaboot.conf

6.  This yaboot.conf  got me this far.
## This yaboot.conf is for CD booting only, do not use as reference.
## Ubuntu PowerPC (feisty)

default=install


message=cdrom/install/boot.msg

# PowerPC subarch
image=cdrom/install/powerpc/vmlinux
        label=install
        alias=install-powerpc
        initrd=cdrom/install/powerpc/initrd.gz

Thanks Wil.  I hadn't thought of the VMWare option.  My license has 
expired and because the _upgrade_(?) to FC6 nuked my working VMWare 
installation I don't even think on it much.

I joined the maemo-users list and will join the developers if I don't 
find what I'm looking for in user-land.

Again thanks for the great suggestion.

I'm having a hard time finding an answer to what seems to be a simple 
question- what Ethernet switches include monitor ports for sniffing all 
network traffic? I assume that unmanaged switches don't have this, though it 
would be nice to be wrong because they're inexpensive. I've been looking at 
all kinds of managed and 'smart' switches, and I'm not seeing anything in 
their specs that sounds like what I'm looking for. Is there some magic 
buzzword I should be looking for? got any specific models to recommend?

It's sometimes called port mirroring. If the switch isn't "managed",
how would you enable/disable the port mirroring/monitoring function?

I'm sure that to a geek mind that is a reasonable question. But we're not 
dealing with geek minds here, but marketers. :)

you can usually do a mac flood and force the switch to dump the port 
into promiscuous mode - most switches have a 4k/8k mac address table.

http://www.rootsecure.net/content/downloads/pdf/arp_spoofing_intro.pdf

you're better off getting a cheap switch that can do l3 management and 
provide you with a monitor port/port mirror.

Here's a L3 cisco switch

http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?from=R40&satitle=2948G

Depending on the architecture, if you're wanting to monitor all inbound
traffic to the switch from the outside and its one link you could run it
through a linux box with 2 NIC's then going into the uplink on the switch
with clients plugged into the rest of the ports.

In Cisco land, the magic buzzword is "span port" (SPAN == Switch Port 
ANalyzer; note that traffic passed to a span port has gone through IOS 
error checking, so it's not a "raw" stream of packets). 3com switches 
use "Monitor ports."

Other folks like Network Critical (www.criticaltap.com) market "TAP" 
products that sit in front of or behind a router. They essentially 
duplicate the live stream, one branch heads to the router, the other 
to the Intrusion Detection System (or the Bush Administration, if 
you're AT&T).

Oh you funny hippies, always complaining about silly stuff like hand-delivery 
of personal data to Homeloon Secuarity.

Thanks all, this helps. I found a Netgear switch for under $200 that seems to 
do what I want, so I'll bet there are more in that price range.

Work spoiled me for managed switches that support VLANs.  Thank you for pointing
out they're available for under $200.  I want one, I want one.

My understanding (which may be flawed in many ways) is that Netgear's 
"port mirroring" functionality allows you to duplicate the traffic of 
*one* port, not a range of them. That's not a problem, of course, if 
all your uplink traffic passes through a single port.

I'll second Mike's ooh-ing and aah-ing over the features of such an 
inexpensive bit of equipment: not only VLANs, but also IEEE 8023ad 
link aggregation (mode 4 in the Linux kernel's bonding interface). 
Nice for redundancy and failover on a multi-homed machine in a 
multi-switch environment.

WRT54GL?

The Intarweb port on a WRT is just a port in a VLAN.

Only five ports; a pity.

except a broadcast loop on two ports will hang the whole switch even if 
its been properly vlan'd.  i had a vlan to another switch (alteon 180e) 
crash, and created a broadcast loop.  be sure to enable STP if you've 
got vlan's so that it can at least shutdown a loop..  but its completely 
the wrong way to handle this problem.

Or a Buffalo WHR-G54S (an OpenWrt-able WRT clone) for a shade over $40.

I understand these broadcom jobbies don't do 100Mbps with such
alacrity though.  That's hearsay.  I haven't tested/compared them myself.

Actually, unless you are monitoring a port running at a lower speed
than the monitor port (e.g. monitoring a 100Mbps port with a 1Gbps
monitor port), you will have a very good chance of dropping traffic if
you monitor more than one port.  Even a single port of the same speed
cannot be fully monitored if the link is saturated, since most modern
switches run at full duplex.  You would need special tap equipment to
truly monitor a full duplex port, by splitting each direction into two
ports that feed into a machine with two NICs.  You can then use
software such as the Linux channel bonding driver to combine each
direction back into a single stream you could feed to an IDS/IPS, etc.

If you don't do a setup like this, you're banking on the various links
being monitored never being saturated beyond the half-duplex send
buffer of the switch monitor port.  This isn't a great gamble, since
Ethernet traffic (and TCP/IP traffic in general) tends to be fairly
bursty.

If you're monitoring that much traffic and you're not the NSA, do you
really need every packet? Just do sflow/netflow/cflow/*flow.

I went to check it out and was very impressed.
The idea of a self-organizing conference seemed odd to me but it works very
well.
And I finally got to meet Russell Senior face to face! (I'm all agog)
It was a great learning experience.  I'll definitely schedule time to fully

   Perhaps this is not the correct forum for this question, but I'll start
here.

   When I load python modules in emacs, there are two language-specific
menus: IM-Python and Python. The first lets me navigate among classes and
methods in the loaded modules, the second allows me to open an 'execute
buffer,' 'interactive buffer,' and several other operations. But, I don't
see anything that let's me run the application from within emacs. The
'execute buffer' tries to run the loaded/displayed module, but if that's not
the initial one nothing happens.

   Is it possible to run a python application from within emacs as I would
from the command line in a virtual console?

Subject: [PLUG] Grub error 21 on reboot
Message-ID: <20070206175106.GK30127@amethyst.spiritone.com>

Like a child at his birthday party I downloaded the 2.6.20 patch
yesterday and built me a new kernel.  This caused me to reboot my
machine for the first time since 2.6.19 was released, and it won't get
past Grub's stage 1.5.

I'm running Debian Testing on a 4-year-old IBM desktop.  Only one hard
drive.  I haven't messed with Grub or any other config since the last
reboot, but have run 'apt-get upgrade' every other day or so.

I booted off an Ubuntu Live CD (5.10, the latest I have).  'fdisk -l'
has nothing bad to say about my drive.  I mounted / and chrooted to it
then reinstalled Grub (on (hd0,0), hd0 being the only choice it offers
and hda1 being where I have /).  Grub claims success, but the same
error shows up on reboot.  I'm now trying to 'apt-get install lilo'
(still chrooted), but can't get it from the server.  I don't know if
that's because I'm chrooted from a live cd or just the occasional
unavailability I've been seeing from Debian's servers recently.

Can anyone suggest what's wrong here?  Googling for this error suggest
that it normally happens when the stage-1 MBR and later files are on
different HDs and one of 'em's missing.  That's not the case here.  As
far as I can tell all of the files are present and intact.  Clearly
part of the MBR is ok since stage-1 is running off of it.  I don't
know how to test the integrity of my entire MBR.  Grub at least thinks
it's ok when it installs.

Any suggestions how to proceed?

Thanks,

--Eric

The analysis of the costs and benefits for the ISP are a little more  
complex.  Here's a couple issues:

1) ISPs charge for bandwidth.  There's only so many of your neighbors  
that are going to be able to use the connection before you want to  
pay for more bandwidth

2) Fewer subscribers means less equipment, less provisioning, less  
support, less power; lots of costs that go down for them.

Eric,

   You write that you downloaded the patch for .20. Did you use it to patch
the .19 source? If not, you can't build a complete kernel from the patch
file.

> ... but have run 'apt-get upgrade' every other day or so.

   Why?

> Can anyone suggest what's wrong here?

   Two things. First, try building from the full kernel source instead of a
patched file. Second, while it's been a long time since I saw GRUB rather
than LILO, you should be able to boot into the kernel you used before and --
according to Carla's Most Excellent Book -- you can get a command line to
fix boot problems.

Provide more info please. Grub is obviously confused about
where things are.

When you say 'reinstalled grub', what exactly did you do?
Post the / and /boot listings so we can see what kernel stuff is where.
Post the contents of /boot/grub/ and /boot/grub/menu.list

I still don't know what the problem was, but I installed lilo and had
no problems booting.  Maybe there's a bug in Debian Testing's current
grub package.

Hello,

I've recently been asked to share some examples of some scripting 
skills. I thought these might be of interest to you as well--especially 
my geosynchronized photo script.

The first, process_main.sh is one of my favorites. I wanted a system
that would permit me to automatically create geosynchronized satellite
maps with labels depicting the exact location of each photo was taken. 
You may view the script online here:

  http://cooper.stevenson.name/scripts/process_main.txt
 

All the user has to do is simply plug in the camera & GPS and save the
camera's images to a directory. The script will automatically download
the GPS track log, synchronize the data with the image header data, pull
down a sat. map from the Internet, and display the results!

I like to separate my code as much as I can; this makes reading the code
for myself and others much easier. I have included my script performing
the "gruntwork" main task, process_inf_data.rb, as an example.
Process_inf_data.rb, written in Ruby, also serves t estimate to my
talent for writing scripts in various languages. Here's the data 
processing script:

  http://cooper.stevenson.name/scripts/process_inf_data.txt

A picture is worth a thousand words, so here's the output of the image 
geosynchronization scripts here:

  http://cooper.stevenson.name/scripts/geo4589-map.jpg

The second group of scripts, address.ksh & filter_web.sed is are part of
a series of scripts I wrote to automatically filter information from the
online OLMIS database. Later in the series I export and run queries
against the results in an SQL database. These two scripts illustrate my
ability to perform complex data extraction through automation in both
shell and Sed (yes, the Perl guys and girls will "crush" me for using 
Sed). Here they are:

  http://cooper.stevenson.name/scripts/address.txt

 http://cooper.stevenson.name/scripts/filter_web.txt
 
 
The last scripting sample in the series is rather complex; the script
reads exported GIS information and creates a hexagon-based configuration
file. I have included the script, "roads.sh," and the input GIS file,
"roads.txt." Again, this illustrates my ability to extract meaningful
information from complex input streams.

  http://cooper.stevenson.name/scripts/roads.txt

Not trivial work--here's the GIS ASCII input file:

  http://cooper.stevenson.name/scripts/roads_input.txt
 
I have dozens more scripts for things ranging from server monitoring to
complex Ruby on Rails based online GIS applications. I thank the PLUG 
list community for their patience in my posting to the main list; feel 
free to ask me for details or if you would like the source code.

Enjoy!

While the motivation for Cooper's post was his job search the scripts themselves
are useful for all Pluggers.  If I had a GPS I'd be adapting the photo/gps thing
to my own purposes.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0702061740520.19314@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   My server/workstation has 4 USB ports, two on the rear and two that are
front accessible. When I plug in my USB thumb in the front/top port it's
assigned to /dev/sda1.

   Now that all the video conferencing toys ... er, tools are here, I have
the camera plugged in one port at the rear, the scanner on the other rear
port, and the headphone/microphone on the front/top port.

   I cannot determine to what device they've been assigned by looking at
/proc/bus/usb, dmesg, or /var/log/messages. How can I determine where they
are assigned so I can create mount points for them?

   Perhaps I should add that I'm running the 2.6.19.2 kernel on this box. It
has /sys, but I don't see a /udev directory.

Rich,

Udev still uses /dev.  Read up on udev rules.   It is super simple.  Create
a rule like this in /etc/udev/rules.d/10-chris-dawson.rules

BUS=="usb", RUN+="/home/cdawson/bin/usb_load"

Or,

ID_FS_TYPE=="vfat", KERNEL=="sd?1", BUS=="usb",
RUN+="/home/cdawson/bin/usb_load"

Use a perl script for usb_load and Inside of it print the  %ENV hash.
You'll see a ton of stuff in there, mostly symlinks which you can use to
mount a drive to whatever you want.

Make sure you name the file "chris-dawson.rules"  I am not sure if you rule
like I do.

Chris

Better to have stuck to the facts.  Yes, I patched an existing tree.  It
built without error.  The computer's plugged in. :-)

Keeping up with the latest, I guess.  I like Debian, but stable is pretty
stale.

I'm not getting to the point where GRUB presents a cmdline.  It's failing
to load stage 2, or maybe stage 1.5.  The kernel *could* be a patch file
at this point since it never loads it.

* run 'grub' as root

* inside grub, run 'root (hd0,0)' letting it tab-complete to confirm
that there's only on possible boot device

* inside grub, run 'setup'.  The resulting messages claim some non-fatal
failures along the way but eventually success.

* quit grub

Looking over this closely as I copy it into my message I still don't
see anything wrong.  With my machine booting again I did an 'apt-get
upgrade' and note that grub was among the upgraded packages.  I wonder
if there was a problem that's since been fixed.  I'm going to wait a
few weeks before overwriting lilo, however; I like that my machine
boots again.

Thanks!

Message-ID: <45C987AF.7040100@hevanet.com>

For future reference:

The critical part here is the "setup" command.  There are three 
possibilities:
1. "setup (hd0)" installs grub in the MBR of hd0 (or hda, if you prefer)
2. "setup (hd0,0)" installs grub in the boot sector of the first 
partition, which
is NOT the same as the MBR.
3. "setup" with no arguments installs grub in the target specified by the
latest "root" command, which in your case was (hd0,0).

So it looks like you installed grub in the boot sector of the first 
partition
instead of the MBR.  You can still use that grub, but you have to make
special arrangements to chain-load it in the appropriate stanza in menu.lst
or lilo.conf.

I use the command "grub-install /dev/hda", which installs grub in the MBR
of /dev/hda.  I use Ubuntu, so I assume that it is available in Debian.

All of this and more than you could ever wish to know about grub is in the
Grub Manual 
<http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/index.html#Top> .

There was nothing attached, but I wonder what "your site" means here.

Mailman scrubs attachments.  Jason, you should use one of the myriad
image-hosting sites and provide an URL.

Subject: [PLUG] looping over file names in numeric order in bash?
Message-ID: <45CA0EA4.4050405@seitzassoc.com>

Given the following file names, is there an easy way to loop
over them in numeric order?

data1.ps   data11.ps  data3.ps  data5.ps  data7.ps  data9.ps
data10.ps  data2.ps   data4.ps  data6.ps  data8.ps


In other words, how can I modify this:

for i in data*.ps
do 
  echo $i
done


to give this:

data1.ps
data2.ps
data3.ps
data4.ps
data5.ps
data6.ps
data7.ps
data8.ps
data9.ps
data10.ps
data11.ps


thanks,
galen

Galen,

   Is using a two-digit number for all files an option? That works, if it
fits how these file names are generated.

A few points:

1. It's nice to start with comments at the top of script that include
who wrote it, when, a description, etc.  Interestingly, I wrote a
template at one time (that I seem to have forgotten about):

http://haus.nakedape.cc/svn/public/trunk/small-projects/dev-utils/script-template

Here's another script that lets you extract POD from comments of shell
scripts, so you can generate man pages:

http://haus.nakedape.cc/svn/public/trunk/small-projects/dev-utils/unhash2pod2man


2. Er, you do know that 'date' can format dates as you like them,
without resorting to sed/awk?

$ date | awk '{ print $2, $3, $6}' | sed 's/ /./g'
Feb.7.2007

$ date +%b.%-d.%Y
Feb.7.2007

Anyway, since it looks like you're using the date for directory/file
names, it seems to me to use ISO-formatting, so dates sort numerically
in order:

$ date -I
2007-02-07

(If you want portability with non-GNU date(1)s you can use the
appropriate format specifiers.)

3. You seem to switch between variables named with '_dir' and
'_directory'.  Any particular reason?

4. Comments are easier to read if a space immediately follows the hash
character.

5. You have a couple lines longer than 80-characters, one of which is
really long.  Please, think of the kittens.

6. I think it's a good practice when building pathnames in variables to
separate them with '/', even if you plan to always end base paths with
'/'--someone else using or modifying your script might not.  I.e.,

image_mount_dir=${base_directory}08.09.06/images/

vs

image_mount_dir=${base_directory}/08.09.06/images/

(Not to mention comp.unix.shell FAQ about always quoting variables.)

7. You don't need to grep something if you're going to immediately pipe
it to awk; awk has a pattern-matching facility:

grep timediff | awk -F',' '{print $1, $2, $4, $5, $6}' 

awk -F, '/timediff/ {print $1, $2, $4, $5, $6}'

(The comma doesn't need to be quoted either.)

8. "run: command not found"  (You're missing a '#' at the beginning of
the penultimate line.)

9. "perl" not "pearl"

Sorry, I forgot to mention that I don't want to rename the files.  I
understand that data01, data02, etc. would be a better choice, but
I'm not the one creating the files.

Kinda hackish, but...

for i in data?.ps data??.ps; do 
    echo $i
done

(I should note that the filenames being in any order in the first place
is filesystem-dependent.  'echo' the wildcards and pipe through 'sort'
for portability.)

Use 'seq', which generates a sequence (shocking!). It's an
indispensable tool for shell script looping.

for i in $(seq 1 11); do
	echo data${i}.ps
done

---------------------------------------------------------

I suspect Randal can invent a Perl one liner that re-orders the glob.

It is better to generate file names with leading zeros in the number
to prevent this.  However, this comes up in version numbering a lot,
for example, the 2.6.12 kernel should have a higher value than 2.6.5 ,
so it is difficult to anticipate when zeros will be needed.

Some name sequences, like "2.6.12" "2.10.1" have even more tricky
ordering;  just stripping out the nonnumerals and sorting doesn't
cut it.

If the time order of the files is the same as the numeric order, you
might do an "ls -t data*.ps" to present the files in time order.  
That would do for a quick hack, but I would hate to depend on it.

Excellent!  GNU specific, but that's okay.

One more question.   Why $(...) rather than `...` ?

Thanks Tony.  That explains why reinstalling grub didn't work while
installing lilo did, and more importantly how to fix this if it
happens again.  I'll have to live without knowing why it stopped
booting in the first place. :-(

FWIW, I've been using $(...) a lot more recently.  For one thing, they
nest, while backticks don't afaik.

See 'Command Substitution' section in a recent bash(1) man page. I 
think $(command) is the POSIX recommendation, though the "Shell 
Command Language" documents at opengroup.org list both as acceptable.

While shelling out to seq is more portable, bash will also let you do:

  for ((i = 1; i <= 11; i++)); do
  	echo data${i}.ps
  done

Also, seq -w is handy when files have been named "properly" with leading
zeros.

/sbin/lsusb -v will give you a bunch of information, but not quite what you
need.  (Note that you need to have usbutils installed for that to work.)

   Much more than without the verbosity option!

   I did not have snd_usb_audio built. I just built it and installed it. I'm
not sure -- yet -- if that covers the video portion, too, but I need to
install and configure Ekiga before going further, I suppose.

   Of course, I still don't know if I need to define mount points and
identify the devices assigned to the hardware.

Thanks very much, Alan!

Using sort will also take care of any missing values.  For example:

$ echo data{1,10,2,100,20,10}.ps |
  xargs -n1 |
  sort -k 1.5n

Since the original problem was to loop over files called data*.ps:

$ ls data*.ps |
  sort -k 1.5n |
  while read i ; do
    echo $i
  done

Or if one insists on a "for" loop:

$ for i in $(ls data*.ps | sort -k 1.5n ) ; do
    echo $i
  done

I've dealt with this issue several times recently.
I don't know what your definition of "easier on the
system" is, but I'd say that an indexed database is
much better than a linear search through 100,000
firewall rules.

Although, I did once have to use the firewall approach
with about 10,000 rules. I organized the rules in
chains of /8 networks. Thus, no one chain had more than
a few hundred rules. It worked well.

As for indexed databases, I recently ran benchmarks
on Berkeley DB versus Bernstein's CDB. CDB was about
twice as fast.

Another approach is to use your own private DNSBL.

YAR,

   Don't know if this information will be helpful, but my postfix MTA checks
these RBLs on each incoming message: zen.spamhaus.org, bl.spamcop.net,
list.dsbl.org. This lets the RBLs maintain the lists while we check against
them. I'm sure you can use the same approach in sendmail.

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu And Comcast Digital Cable?
Message-ID: <45CB7C5B.2060706@comcast.net>

I recently upgraded to Comcast Digital with Voice.  The new modem, a 
motorola SBV5220 seems to be a problem for interfacing with Ubuntu.  I 
finally got my desktop to interface, but when I swap the ethernet cable, 
recycle the modem and connect my laptop (an HP Pavilion ze4230 with 
Dapper, which had previously had no difficulty interfacing with the 
former modem) absolutely refuses to interface through DHCP.

Does anyone have any experience or insights?

Any help would be much appreciated.

As most of you probably know, Comcast is worthless when it comes to 
Linux support.  Their answer is usually, "You'll have to contact Linux."

Thanks,

  I had a similar problem with a desktop system running Linux.  It
wouldn't pull a DHCP address when it was direct connect to the modem.

  Boot up your laptop and fire up Ethereal (or Wireshark, depending on
your distro).  Set it up to monitor Eth0.  Do a manual "ifdown" and
"ifup" on the interface.  You should be able to see the DHCP requests
going out on the interface.

  I was seeing DHCP responses on the wire.  My Linux box wasn't
recognizing the response packets for some reason.

> Any help would be much appreciated.

  I just installed a hardware firewall behind the cable modem.  I was
planning on putting one in anyway.  The hardware firewall worked fine
with the modem.  My system was able to pull a NAT address from the
firewall without any problems.

I use the level 1 list, but it doesn't seem to be catching significantly
more spam that the level 2 list. I also see about the same number of
false positives. Just a data point; the level 2 list is about 10% as
large as the level 1 list.

The db is going to be extremely fast, and iptables is a kernel module,
with any interrupt protection that may include (I freely admit ignorance
of how interrupts are handled when executing inside a kernel module). 

If iptables really walks a list of rules to find matches for each
packet, that would be far more expensive than a user-space db lookup.

Postfix only processes about 1100 emails per day on my server, and I see
no increase in load between no UCEprotect list and the level 1 list.

I've gotten that error when I've run out of memory before. I admin a couple
IIS servers that have given errors that such and such a library can't be
found even though they are installed and accessible to the application. It
was the same library every time. The version of PerlIS.dll that I had to use
on these servers had a memory leak and the only way to avoid the problem was
to cycle the application pools on a regular basis.

Do you have any other memory hungry processes that run at the same time?

When I was with Comcast I had no problems with OpenBSD as my firewall. 
I once tried out the much less expensive MSN/Qwest package and had the 
same problem you're having.  My research indicated a proprietary 
non-standard from some message board posts.

I would recommend getting a SOHO router or something.  Swapping cables 
and power cycling modems would get old quick.  And I'm sure a Linksys 
router would work fine.

 If you are directly connecting to the modem then you will most likely have issues with comcast. I am not sure what they do but they lock in the mac of the first host that connects and then deny access to other nic cards that connect(if they have different mac addresses). I am sure this is a measure to help them manage one IP per client. Try setting your Ubuntu mac address to match the other box you have connected(I think you can do it via ifconfig. Please correct me if I am wrong.). Another thing that worked for me was to power cycle the modem. Best solution is to get a firewall switch to front all traffic.

I was going to suggest "stab Comcast between the head", but your suggestion 
probably works better.

I can tell you from working for the big C that yes they do track your mac.
The premise is that your only allowed to use one computer unless you
purchase the "home networking" package, and then you can only use 5.
Personally I think it's dumb, really dumb.  But I'm just a peeon in the
corporate world.  Just buy a linksys router and your home free.   Check out
your user agreement.  your not supposed to use your service for anything
more than surfin the net.  Your not supposed to open up ssh tunnels or set
up servers unless you buy a commercial account.   I've never seen them
enforce this but I can tell you that they know exactly how much data your
sending and receiving.

Wouldn't your arms get awfully tired? That's a lot of movement for each 
action -- having to spread your arms multiple times to zoom in on 
something vs. clicking on a "+" with your finger on a mouse.

I suppose it could replace calisthenics in gym class.

Comcast looks for a specific MAC address for one machine on the
customer end.  The technician that installed it wanted to use a
Windoze machine to install, so I obliged with a cheap old laptop
running Win98 with a plugin PCMCIA ethernet card.  That card later
went into the Other Cheap Old Laptop that is acting as my firewall
router.  

If I was doing the same thing today, I would do it with virtual 
machines.  I would use VMWare Player (or other similarly capable
software) to run a Win2K guest and let them install with that,
then use a Linux guest instance (or the host) as the firewall.

One of the advantages of a PCMCIA card as the device with the MAC
address is that it is easy to move around, and ejecting it from the
laptop gives me one-second shutdown on the link if the Bad Guys
come a knockin' on my internet door. 

BTW, one trouble I have had with Comcast is that they occasionally
put me in NAT mode on a non-routable IP (like 192.168.x.x), rather
than assign a routable dynamic IP address.  Since I usually am either
surfing or talking down a VPN link to my offsite server, this is not
much of a restriction, but it can affect the setup of iptables and
other utilities that are cognizant of IP addresses.

I wondered about standing up that long.  I can imagine that for certain
environments, like a command and control room or any place where
monitoring is the main activity or where the main activity is otherwise
spacial it would be really great.

First, there's no reason you'd have to stand.  The thing can be made into 
a drafting table or even just a smaller screen on a desktop (search 
youtube for "multitouch" and see if you can find the drafting table 
video).

Second, standing is probably way better for you than sitting all day.  I 
know loads of people in the computer world who have switched to standing 
workstations and say they won't go back.  Sitting is a prominent cause in 
lower back problems.  I use a balans chair at home, which helps a little, 
but I think a standing station would probably be best.

The graphic design and animation possibilities are amazing.  Also, given 
proper software, some of the mathematical modeling applications could be 
really good.  I particular liked the demo where they appeared to be 
attempting to verify that certain graphs were planar (and on spheres, no 
less!).  The GIS stuff is obvious, I suppose.

Lots of "main activities" could be made spatial, given the right kind of 
interface design.  I don't think it's too hard to see that many people 
have problems with this desktop metaphor and some of the other interface 
quirks that we've been stuck using for the past couple of decades.  A 
spatial interface could be more intuitive and easier to navigate for more 
people.

I'm excited by the idea, but don't really expect change because the ruling 
class (in this case, the geeks) are always too conservative and 
self-righteous to develop anything new.

As Neal Stephenson wrote in "In The Beginning Was The Command Line", if 
the automobile were a new invention today, it would have a trackball and 
pull-down menus for shifting gears.  It would be a nightmare, of course.

Message-ID: <20070208222136.15vgole7msg4ss8o@web.robinson-west.com>

I've run into some suggestions that APC smart UPS'es have temperature sensors
to avoid battery meltdown when one side of the battery drops in voltage.

Well, upsstats.cgi from nut-client is giving me a reading of 34.2 C off of
an SU1000NET unit, that seems awfully cold and makes me wonder if the
temperature sensor is broken.  I'd like to get these in fahrenheit instead
of centigrade.

How is upsset.cgi set up and what is it for?  I simply took it out of the
cgi directory.  I figure there's no risk in letting anyone check the status
of my UPS unit but certainly if upsset.cgi allows manipulating the UPS
itself that is a very different story.  Can apache use more than one cgi
directory?

Is anyone using Moto4Lin (or any other software) to access a Motorola
Razr V3 phone? If so, how well does it work -- access to all the files
on the phone, contact list, ring tones, etc.?

Motorola sells Winders software for the job, and also a cable. The USB
cable I have for my Canon Digital Rebel camera has the right connectors,
so all I need is the software, and of course, I'd rather have Linux

You'll not my serial number is formatted a bit differently from yours.
Keep in mind that the serial is an integer that increases with each

I went through this some months back when I first got my Razr V3 phone.
I don't remember exactly what the problem was, but I couldn't get
Moto4Lin to work. When I plug the phone into a USB port Linux sees that
the phone is connected. But it doesn't automatically see it as a drive,
so I can't get anything on or off of it. If I want a pic from the phone
I have to use the phone to e-mail it to myself. Bluetooth might be
another possibility, but I don't have any computers with bluetooth.

However, I did discover that attaching it to a USB port acts to charge
the phone's battery. So the cable has at least some utility for me.

One of these days I'm going to put Vmware Player on this computer, and
then Windows 2000. Perhaps then I'll be able to use the Motorola
Windows software.

I don't have bluetooth on any of my computers, either. One of these days
I'll look into a USB bluetooth adapter and give that a try.

Has anyone else seen this issue.
Is there another way to force a check of all file systems?

Not too expensive.  I've got a couple D-link DBT-120's and they work
great.  They are class 2 devices (10 meter range), a bit over $30.
I've also got some Linksys USBBT100's that are class 1 (100 meter
range), slightly more expensive around $40.

I have yet to figure out bluetooth file transfers to/from Razr on
Linux.  It did work on Windows, despite what the Cingular lady told me
(she was trying to sell me a data plan), so it is possible.

My work machine is an XP laptop, and most of the phone activity is work
related. I'd really like to be able to use Linux for work, but there are
a lot of Winders specific things done in the land of real estate. The
local multiple listing service is working towards upgrading their web
software so it won't require IE, but that's still some months away. Sigh.

Anyone know what the -words option means for scp? This is from the man page:

scp -words [-1246BCpqrv ] ...

But the man page does not say what '-words' means. Is the official place to 
start cussing when it doesn't work right?

What system is this on.  My "man scp" generates something
substantially different.  That stuff looks like formatting codes.
Here's what mine looks like:


 SCP(1)                    BSD General Commands Manual                   SCP(1)

 NAME
      scp - secure copy (remote file copy program)

 SYNOPSIS
      scp [-1246BCpqrv] [-c cipher] [-F ssh_config] [-i identity_file]
          [-l limit] [-o ssh_option] [-P port] [-S program]
          [[user@]host1:]file1 [...] [[user@]host2:]file2

 DESCRIPTION
      scp copies files between hosts on a network.  It uses ssh(1) for data
      transfer, and uses the same authentication and provides the same security
      as ssh(1).  Unlike rcp(1), scp will ask for passwords or passphrases if
      they are needed for authentication.

Yeah.  Look at the raw man file:

  $ zless /usr/share/man/man1/scp.1.gz

or substitute wherever yours lives:

  [...]
  .Sh NAME
  .Nm scp
  .Nd secure copy (remote file copy program)
  .Sh SYNOPSIS
  .Nm scp
  .Bk -words
  .Op Fl 1246BCpqrv

  .Sm off
  .Oo
  .Op Ar user No @
  .Ar host1 No :
  .Oc Ns Ar file1
  .Sm on
  .Op Ar ...

  [...]

It appears your man is misformatting.

   Something kinky, no doubt.

   From here in Slackware-11.0 land I see this:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ scp
usage: scp [-1246BCpqrv] [-c cipher] [-F ssh_config] [-i identity_file]
            [-l limit] [-o ssh_option] [-P port] [-S program]
            [[user@]host1:]file1 [...] [[user@]host2:]file2

   Perhaps you have the enhanced version?

Oho, it is a Konqueror glitch. man scp in an xterm doesn't show -words.
Darn, I thought I had discovered a sekrit.

Then where are your pointer records?  or to continue with samples:

For subnet 199.88.144.0/24 in named.conf you'd have:
   zone "144.88.199.in-addr.arpa" {
      type master;
      file "199.88.144.in-addr.arpa";
   };

mine, and have found a good way to meet it.  It is now a year since I
moved to Hailey, Idaho, and my abilities as a web developer are
starting to get noticed and demanded.  I now find myself needing a way
to produce invoices for my services, and to keep the data around for
easy reporting.  Does anyone know of a good linux solution (short of
writing a custom app, which is always the best solution, but now it's
too late because I'm busy writing other people's apps)?

gnucash has some support for small business accounting.  I haven't used
the business features myself.

Our business is using gnucash and we're generally pleased with the
invoicing and other results.

So far, sql-ledger and gnuchash have been offered as choices.  Both
wildly exceed my needs, and that is good.  I like the fact that
sql-ledger is a web application.  This centralizes the business logic
and data storage, but lets me access it from anywhere (security issues
aside).  Does gnucash have a client-server architecture, or is it a
pure desktop app?  If it is a pure desktop app, does it at least talk
to a database of the user's choosing?

   The latter.

   No ... at least, not that I've seen.

   Two other factors that may be of use to you: 1) gnucash requires all of
Gnome, which can be a PITA for those of us who have no other
gnome-requiring applications, and 2) SQL-Ledger is a full-fledge accounting
package into which your business will grow.

I have a bluetooth thingy for the PC.  What software do I need to
interface with my Samsung SGH-C417 phone.  Got the Borg earpiece, too.
How do I download my photos to my PC without paying the phone company?

I've done this.. and actually posted a short synopsis of how on the
list some time back (about a year ago). Here's what I found in my
gmail archives (initially posted by me, although I don't recall
anymore than what's below):

"...
 I *do* know
that there is something  wrong with the way moto4lin establishes
connections to the phone.  I've never been able to connect solely
through moto4lin.  IIRC, the proceedure I've used to transfer files
to/from the phone is:  (If this doesn't work, let me know.  I don't
have my usb cable to test and it's been a while.)

1) run p2ktest and establish a connection, then close p2ktest (the
closing part may be optional)
2) start moto4lin, verify the settings are correct (pointing to the
correct tty device, mostly -- and in agreement with anything learned
from p2ktest in #1)
3) Hit the Connect/Disconnect button
4) transfer files very carefully.  The defaults are anything but
intuitive, and the view of the phone filesystem seems to have little
effect on where things go and what paths you need to input manually.
Basically, moto4lin is a serious pain in the ass to use, but I have
been able to get the job done with it.

I don't know that model nor do I have a bluetooth adapter for my PC, but 
my Samsung SPH-A960 (or something like that) came with a USB cable and I 
can just select "Mass Storage" from the phone menu and it becomes a 
generic USB storage device.

I can access most of the memory and move pictures and videos and MP3s and 
the like, but I can't access the ringtone or game area (or any other 
downloaded content, I don't think, though I've never downloaded any).

I've mentioned before that this phone artificially limits you by not 
allowing you to set arbitrary MP3s as ringtones unless you bought them 
through the phone's internet service thingie.  One can get around this, 
however, by using mencoder to just write a video file in the phone's 
format that has no video portion and uses your chosen MP3 as the audio. 
For whatever reason, the phone DOES allow you to set arbitrary videos as 
ringtones.

Baased on what you said I decided to try again. It's been a long time
-- maybe moto4lin works better now. So I installed moto4lin, then
launched it. Looking at it on screen I realized that I had never seen
it before. So then I went to the archives and re-read all that we went
through back in April, 2006. Evidently back then I was unable even to
install moto4lin. However, this time it was listed in Synaptic and
installation went fine. I dimly recall that the problem back then was
that it had to be compiled for amd64, and there was an error in
compiling it.

However, as you said, it could not connect to the phone. So then I
tried p2ktest, only to discover that p2ktest is not installed and it is
not listed in Synaptic. Google tells me that p2ktest is supposed to be
part of moto4lin, but evidently it is not. Apt-get doesn't find it, so
evidently it's not in the repositories -- and I have almost everything
in my sources file. What is it, and where can I get it? Also, google
turned up references to p2kmoto, which I also do not seem to have.

p2ktest is part of p2kmoto which you can find here.
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=132142


I have a Motorola E815 and the corresponding USB cable but I have never used
it because the E815 has a Micro SD slot.  I just remove the Micro SD flash
card, connect it to my USB port and transfer pictures, videos, and music to
and from it as desired. Lately I have been putting Italian lessons on it and
occasionally listening to them.

These posts inspired me to install moto4lin and give it a try.  The only
thing I have been able to do so far is to connect to the phone. It is not
able to do any file transfers or any of the other phonebook management
things etc, you might imagine doing with such software.  The program seems
to be several years old and not maintained.

Does anybody know what protocol/language this phone understands and whether
there is any type of open specification for it anywhere?

Omigod, I just did it!

Didn't need no p2ktest, no p2kmoto, nuthin' at all. Just moto4lin and
the ability to read google.

OK, here's the secret:

Open /home/<username/.qt/moto4linrc. This is what mine says now, but
you can see how I changed the first line:

[device]
#cfgACMdevice=/dev/usb/acm/0
cfgACMdevice=/dev/ttyACM0
cfgATproduct=4902
cfgATvendor=22b8
cfgAutoConnect=0
cfgP2Kproduct=4901
cfgP2Kvendor=22b8

[filemanager]
cfgAutoExpandDirTree=0
cfgAutoUpdateFileList=0
cfgGoLastFolder=0
cfgLoadList=0

Save the file and relaunch moto4lin. Go into Preferences and set the
device to p2k instead of AT. Once the bottom window in moto4lin says
the phone is connected click on the Update List button to see the files
on the phone.

I don't know if it will work to upload files like ringtones, etc. All I
wanted to do was download pics, and that worked fine.

The stupid part is that you should be able to make these changes from
the Preferences window, but when you do the changes are not written to
the moto4linrc file. You have to edit it manually.

Followup:

Moto4lin did not install a launch item in the Applications list, so I
decided to do it myself manually. But when I launched it from my new
listing I could not connect to the phone. After much gnashing of teeth
I discovered that I have to launch it as root to see the phone. OK,
good ol' gksudo did the trick.

But then while fiddling with it suddenly moto4lin could not see the
phone. That is, it said it was connected, but the file browser windows
wouldn't display anything and all I could get was error messages in the
bottom window in moto4lin saying that the search could not be
completed. Eventually I decided to recheck the cable. I picked up the
phone and noticed that the display was black. I opened it up and the
inner display was completely black, like it was turned off. I tried
turning it on, but it was dead.

I was just about to scream curses at moto4lin for killing my phone when
suddenly it came back to life. (Whew!)

Everything seems to be working normally now, but if moto4lin kills your
phone, disconnect it and let it sit for a few minutes.

Message-ID: <20070210195352.15180df9.johnxj@comcast.net>

I swear I am never going to upgrade a kernel again. That's it. Ubuntu
screws up Grub every time. This is the third time in a row and I've had
it!

So I upgraded the kernel to 2.6.17-11 the other day. Today I decided
I'd better reboot to make sure it was working. And sure enough, Grub
says "Error 15: File not found." Grrrr.

So, since I now know a lot about Grub I went back to the boot screen
and hit e for edit. I noticed that it was pointing to (hd0,2) when the
installation that was upgraded is on (hd0,1). (There is another
installation of Dapper on hda3, and Ubuntu thinks that is where it put
the new kernel when, in fact, it correctly put it in the hda2
installation. Lame.) OK, I fixed that error, but it still wouldn't
boot. After much futzing around I noticed that it had changed the
device ID line. It used to say:

kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-generic root=/dev/hda2 ro quiet splash

The upgrade changed it to:

kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-11-generic
root-UUID=big_long-ass_string_o'_numbers ro quiet splash

So I changed the big long-ass string of numbers back to /dev/hda2, and
happily was able to boot again. (These things scare the hell out of
me.) Uname -r says I am now at 2.6.17-11-generic.

Two questions that the extensive Grub documentation I have does not
address: 

1) Although I booted back to my usual installation, the boot screen
went through pages of stuff, including a lot of error messages. It was
too fast to read any of them, but there was a lot. It never used to do
that. 

2) More important, and possibly related to the first question,
apparently the long-ass string of numbers identifies someplace on the
hard disk where Grub is to find the boot folder. (I did copy it down
faithfully so I can put it back if necessary.) But why use something
that humans can't understand when /dev/hda2 works as well. Or does it
work as well?

I tried to upload a random mp3 as a ring tone on my wife's phone with
moto4lin and it uploaded fine and played fine from the MyMedia
section, but despite clearly setting it as my ring tone, it didn't
show up in the list of ring tone selections when I go through the
Settings/Audio/*-Detail/Calls, it doesn't show up.

Or didn't show up, that is, until I busted out the laptop with W2K and
did the OBEX thing over bluetooth.  Then it shows up as the only file
in the Audio directory.  I copy it off the phone to the laptop, then
back onto the phone, and BINGO, it works as a ring tone.

I have no idea why that works but I can report that, as a data point,
it does.

I always wonder why people prefer debian knock-offs to the real McCoy.
With straight-up debian you don't get kernel package management; you
have to download them from www.kernel.org and build them yourself (if
this has changed in the last 2 years since I've moved away from
debian, then my apologies).

Is there no mechanism in apt to protect config files of your choosing,
like gentoo portage has?  In portage, you just add a CONFIG_PROTECT
variable and value to /etc/make.conf.

Debian _does_ do kernel package management now, which is just _fine_ 
with this here wet-behind-the-ears newbie!

By default it appears to set you to a specific kernel, which caused me 
grief when I had to upgrade kernels to match my Ethernet hardware.  It 
does, however, let you choose your kernel and upgrade it as a package, 
which I appreciate.

I keep learning about Linux, and someday I may be to the point where I
can handle that kind of thing. Right now I still need the point and
click stuff that Ubuntu provides.

Having just fixed ndiswrapper again (half an hour this time around), I
remember now why it keeps getting broken with kernel upgrades. The
problem is that I am using amd64 Ubuntu, and I was using ndiswrapper
1.34, the latest version. However, Synaptic lists only 1.18. That's
because 1.34 isn't in my repositories yet. To install 1.34 I had to use
make install. And I think that make-installs it just for your current
kernel. So I had to uninstall it and then reinstall it. I don't know if
a CONFIG_PROTECT variable would help here. If it would, I'm all ears.

Much more annoying is that every kernel upgrade hoses my Grub menu.lst
file. Rendering the computer unbootable is not a nice thing to do to a
user. It's because there is another installation of Ubuntu Dapper on
hda3. So I upgraded the installation on hda2, it installed the new kernel
files on hda2, and then it changed the Grub menu.lst file so that it
will look for those files on hda3. Real bright.

Run the program `dmesg`, that will retrieve those messages. You'll likely
want to pipe it through `more` or `less` in order to view them. Error
messages on startup are generally bad, don't ignore it when your system
screams.

The problem is that device identifiers can change. If a disk is added or
moved, everything can change. While the UUID is supposed to be completely
unique to the filesystem, therefore even if the device moves around you
can still uniquely identify the filesystem.

You can retrieve the UUID with `tune2fs -l` on the device, and ensure the
grub config has the right thing.

That method works with any distribution, but it isn't the Right Way(tm).
With Debian and derivatives the Right Way(tm) is to use the
"kernel-package" script to wrap the kernel build and produce a Debian
package you can install with `dpkg`. This keeps everything nice and tidy,
though a small number of kernels aren't difficult to handle by hand.

John, hopefully you're still reading.

There are three control files for kernel-package. The first is
/etc/kernel-pkg.conf, which can be overridden by a .kernel-pkg.conf file
in your home directory. This controls build-time settings, such as what
config target to use. Then there is /etc/kernel-img.conf, this controls
behavior on installation of the packaged kernel. Such as whether the
bootloader installation program gets rerun, whether the boot loader
config is modified to boot the new kernel, etc.

John, look at the man page for kernel-img.conf to find out all the
wonderful settings you can play with (notably disable). Carlos, the main
program for kernel-package is `make-kpkg`. The key advantage is it gives
you a very nice way to /uninstall/ old kernels.

After I sent that message I looked again at the menu.lst file and
noticed that the root= was on a line following the kernel line. I also
noticed that it still said (hd0,2) even though I thought I had changed
it to (hd0,1). But then I remembered that I had done that with the Grub
editor at the boot menu, not with a text editor. So after fixing things
with a text editor I rebooted and it's back to its normal boot process.

Didn't work. I read the options for tune2fs and still can't get it
right. According to the Help the option is -U, not -l, but it still
doesn't work. I got closest with

jjj at Devil5:~$ sudo tune2fs -U UUID /dev/hda2
tune2fs 1.39 (29-May-2006)
tune2fs: Invalid UUID format

All other attempts just give me the option list.

On the other hand, while I understand that adding a disk can change
everything, this is a laptop and there isn't room for another disk. I
think I'll just stick to /dev/hda2. But having said that, it
was /dev/hda2 before the kernel upgrade, and Ubuntu in its wisdom
changed it to a UUID, and the wrong one at that. So leaving it
at /dev/hda2 probably won't save me any future grief.

Can't find the man page for kernel-img.conf. Is that what it's called?

I believe it'd be handled properly by kernels old and new just so long 
as you have an up-to-date /etc/localtime

If you want to use a Knoppix live CD as a rescue CD you need to be
root, else you can't access the hard drive (this is with 5.10). I
googled all over and found conflicting instructions for how to do this.
But none of the methods work anyway. Maybe Knoppix changed things with
the 5.10 release?

That must be something new since Ver. 5.0.  With 5.0 I can click on the 
icons on the desktop Konqueror pops up showing the contents of the hard 
drive.
Typing sudo bash gets me to root at knoppix without the use of a password.

If you want to use a Knoppix live CD as a rescue CD you need to be root,
else you can't access the hard drive (this is with 5.10). I googled all over

   Thank you, Brent. I had no idea how the system 'knew' when to shift the
current time.

   According to today's "Oregonian" this is a potential problem for airlines
and others whose computer systems may not automagically handle the change.

Yes, we expect it to be a problem of such great magnitude as to be unmatched in this
century.  Pundits agree that such a crisis potential has not existed since
December 31, 1999.

If you want write access to the HD you must umount the partition in question
and mount it again "mount /dev/hda? /media/hda? -o rw"

   Well, Michael, that was a jobs program to keep database administrators,
COBOL coders, and other programmers from having to pick up recyclable cans
and bottles from the streets to survive.

At work, we're having almost daily meetings to check and review the
status of patching various O/Ses, hardware and applications.  Java needs
an update if you're running prior to 1.5.<some_version> and it sounds
like Windows back-end (Exchange, etc.) needs a lot of work and patches
may not be available.  I work on middleware (IBM WebSphere, MQ, etc.)
and fortunuately, that just needs a java patch.

Good luck if you're having to deal with the DST change.

   Oh, my! I had not realized this was such a widespread problem. I assumed
that all OSes picked up the proper time from a national time standard and
that all applications took their time from the OS.

Thanks! That got me a root terminal.

If only we could write a program to drum some sense into

The kernel has nothing to do with it.  The kernel just keeps the clock
in UTC.  Glibc does the timezone translation.  It uses a database,
usually installed in /usr/shared/zoneinfo, which describes all the
timezones.  On Redhat and Debian based distributions, it was split out
into a tzdata package so it could be updated independently.  The most
recent version is 2006p; I think the version with the new US rules was
2005m.

Some software uses its own timezone database.  My impression is that
Java keeps its own database.  Perl's DateTime::TimeZone is based off
the tzdata database but has its own copy.  If you use it, you need
version 0.37 or higher.

The kernel doesn't care about DST, or even what time zone you are in. It
always keeps time in UTC.

It's glibc that takes the UTC time from the kernel and converts it to local
time when some app wants to know the local time. Included with glibc is a
time zone database, usually packaged as tzdata. So as long as you are
up to date with the latest tzdata package for your distro then you should
be okay for March 11.

For older versions of Linux distros that are no longer supported, there are
reports of success installing the tzdata package from a newer version of the
same distro.

For some old distro versions tzdata was not packaged separately but instead
was built in to the main glibc package. Again, there are reports of success
doing a forced installation of a new tzdata package from a newer version of
the same distro over the top of the old glibc.

In some cases simply upgrading tzdata is not enough. You may have to
re-run the system's time-zone selection utility to assure that /etc/localtime
is refreshed from the updated data base.

   If you look at a complete time zone/locale file for the US you'll see that
Indiana, for example, has several locales because large pockets of the state
never switch to daylight savings time. The dairy farmers there discovered a
couple of decades ago that their cows had difficulty adjusting their watches
and became very confused about when to drain their milk. So the time stays
the same for them all year long. Arizona does not have dairy farms, as far
as I know, but they don't switch either.

   However, this is a comparatively benign issue compared with others demands
made for political expediency. Those, of course, are to be discussed on the
plug-talk list.

   Remember: non carborundum illegitimum!

Ian,

   Ah, so that's where it is. I know about that directory, but not how to
determine the installed version. Regardless, I'm sure it's up to date since
I've Slackware-11.0 installed.

   Hm-m-m. Reinvent the wheel and forget Occam's Razor, eh?

   Thanks very much for the insight. I always learn so much from all you

It's the modem's MAC, not the machine behind it.

I have seen cases where a box was plugged directly into the cable
modem, and then we wanted to plug in a wireless router or firewall or
something in between (these were not PTP installs, I hasten to add).
No workie until we used the silly router firmware to pretend to have
the first box's MAC address.  Then it worked.  That sounds like
Comcast looking for the machine's MAC rather than the modem's.

Actually, the configuration file Comcast provides customers' modems tells 
the modem to allow only one MAC address to access the modem. This means the 
first MAC address the modem sees is the only one it will talk to. 

Some modems will offer private addresses (usually in the 192.168.100.0/24 
range) to any other MAC addresses they see. Some modems will offer these 
addresses to any MAC address they see if it hasn't yet received the 
configuration file from Comcast (at bootup or if it loses sync for more than 
120 seconds).

Powercycling the modem should solve this problem, since the modem will 
forget what MAC(s) it has seen and is allowing to access the bridge.

You're misreading the documentation. -U allows you to change the UUID on
the filesystem, not retrieve the current value. Now you may in fact wish
to change the UUID, but that isn't needed to solve the current problem,
and generally isn't recommended. The syntax is simple:

`tune2fs -l /dev/hda2` (as root, meaning in your case you'll use sudo)

This will output a whole bunch of things that are set in the superblock.
The filesystem UUID will be listed near the begining of that.

Might be a good time to get to the bottom of the problem so that you

Alas it is in the package "kernel-package". Really should be separated
out as that control file is useful to users of packaged kernels (all
users of Debian derivatives, since that is the standard way to build
packaged kernels), not just folks packaging their own kernels (the
people who will install the package).

Problem is you have to keep it very small, otherwise it will be smarter
than Congress and the President.

On a more serious note there is something simple that can be done. You
simply need to write to your state senator/representative and ask them to
amend ORS 187.110 and exempt Oregon from 15 U.S.C. 260a.

I'd be continuing to write except I got dragged out of OR.

The almost daily meetings is a bit of overkill, but that's what's been
decided until we know that everything can be fixed.  It's due to the
scope of the impact on our environment - Solaris, AIX, Windows OSes,
lots of network hardware, lots of java (different versions / vendors of
JREs and J2SEs), lots of apps and versions (Exchange 2000 - which is
EOLed - MS wants $4K per server per patch, I've heard).  Our Solaris and
AIX boxes have been patched for a while, our Oracle installs are fine
and our middleware JREs/JSE's will be fine after running the IBM jtzu
updater.  It's mostly the Windows environments / windows-based / network
hardware that is an issue.

This is not just Comcast,  I have the same exact problem with Verizon both on
DSL and again on Fios.  The answer I get back from Verizon is that the
device needs
to do a DHCP release of the address prior to allowing a new one to be assigned.

Most SOHO router/firewalls devices don't allow this type of
interaction so the only
recourse is to leave the device off for the at least the duration of
one DHCP lease cycle
before trying to place a new device on-line.  A pain, yes; but it is
typically simpler than
trying to clone the old mac address forever.

This is true and false.  The CMTS is looking for the MAC of the cable
modem for provisioning purposes.  However some CMTS's have feature sets
beyond this.  Cisco UBR's for example have a command called "cable
source verify" which limits the CPE (your computer) MAC to specific
MAC's the CMTS see's and associates with your Cable modem after it comes
online.  This was an attempt by the Cable industry to "limit" how many
computers that a customer could use in a house.

It's similar to the argument that the cable company wants to install
separate set top boxes for every tv in your house and charge you
accordingly.  They wanted to sell you modems for every computer in your
house.  I have seen cable customers with up to 5 cable modems in one
house online at the same time. It has taken a while for networking
concepts to penetrate the television model.  In the past several years
they have wised up about home networking and don't care so much about
what's behind the router.  Cable labs has been working on a project
called "Cablehome" which was an attempt to manage devices behind a NAT
device.  I think it's largely in the process of being abandoned.

One person in the cable industry's favorite saying was "We shouldn't
work so hard pissing off the customer."

In a previous life I wrote a perl script to log into Cisco CMTSs and
reset this value, so call center people could reset it for irate customers.

This also explains why "MAC cloning" is a feature seen on
firewall/routers that you can by for DSL/DOCSIS networks.

Cable modem config files don't do much MAC level limitations, there is
some basic port, source/destination address filtering available but not
much more.

This is to allow techs (or users) to troubleshoot connectivity issues by
connecting to the modem default address of 192.168.100.1 which should
work for all modems.

My firewall is set up to route this out my outside interface, which
allows me to access my modem webpage even when it's fully functional.

Subject: [PLUG] where can I get a sane KDE?
Message-ID: <200702111716.55294.ewilhelm@cpan.org>

Hi all,

Today I found myself wondering how long it will be before we start 
having desktop environment "distributions" with specific mixes of 
stability, defaults, etc -- the way we have linux distributions now 
(e.g. ubuntu is not for everyone.)

I really like the kde window manager, kmail, konqueror, and quite a few 
other parts of the system.

Unfortunately, when I aptitude upgrade, certain parts seem to come with 
new and improved silliness almost daily (it's more like every 6 months 
-- I don't really want to be thinking about my desktop environment 
daily.)

A couple (few?) years ago, there was a problem with the alt+tab box not 
showing all of the windows (I have about 40 running right now, but 
that's just on the laptop), though it would at least pan to allow you 
to alt+tab to any one of them.  This was fixed by replacing it with a 
vertical stack which now makes any minimized windows completely 
inaccessible via alt+shift+tab (it just truncates the stack.)  Yay.  
That must be the developers telling me that I've got too many irons in 
the fire.

Recently, the very-useful feature of being able to spin through a window 
*group* with the mouse wheel turned into the much-less-useful "spin 
through *all* windows with the mouse wheel".

Today, the particular ridiculousity that prompted me to write a rant is 
discovering that Ctrl+Shift+F5 is a hotkey used by kde for the 
oh-so-frequently-needed "switch to desktop 17" action.  WTF?  I really 
doubt that having this enabled could be considered a "reasonable 
default" given that most people won't be running 17 desktops *and* if 
they were, they could not be expected to guess that hotkey without 
going to look in the config (at which point, they could easily enable 
it.)

This is not a new category of annoyances though, since the "increase 
font" hotkey still (IIRC) defaults to Ctrl+"Plus", which literally 
means Ctrl+Shift+= because the plus is the shifted character on that 
key (though, maybe not in every country.)  Similarly, the default 
"Alt+Click to drag a window" can get in the way until you realize that 
it is yet another overly-helpy default to be disabled.

Of course, I'm not switching to gnome.  I could point out about 20 major  
issues there that would make me pull way more hair than the few weird 
nits I have with kde.  I've messed with several of the other wm's, but 
I typically end up being dissappointed with something major (like the 
ability to build hierarchical multi-key shortcut sequences.)

So, am I alone in that I use kde, have 100+ windows open at a time (no, 
I don't like multiple desktops, I prefer layers and the grouped 
taskbar) and don't want perfectly useful and reasonable features to get 
phased-out in favor of increasingly less useful and reasonable ones?

Most of the issues I have are in the window manager, so suggestions of 
how to get or setup a reasonably powerful and configurable replacement 
are welcome.  It just needs to support xinerama, 100+ open windows, 
hierarchical hotkeys, grouped applications, and a decent system tray.  
It helps if I don't need to spend an entire day figuring out how to 
configure it.

Is there a better solution than building from source and maintaining a 
custom set of patches?  Maybe "Joe's KDE sane-ification release" or 
something?  I've tried bug reports, but typically get answers like 
"just use multiple desktops" or "what's wrong with Ctrl++ ?" and it 
seems they generally don't take you seriously unless you compiled trunk 
this morning.  I really do like kde, but the nits seem to be 
accumulating and/or regressing to the point that I think I have to do 
something or else freeze everything at Sarge (!) until I find a better 
answer.

Thanks,
Eric

umm, Eric.  Well, 100+ simultaneous windows in a single desktop is ...
extreme.

Have you considered volunteering as an edge case test subject?

Since then:

1. I have tamed WindowMaker GNUStep and it is now my desktop on all of 
my Linux boxes. I can also get it to come up over VNC, so I'm not "stuck 
with" twm on a VNC connection any more.
2. XFCE 4.4 has gone stable. I've loaded it and brought it up a couple 
of times, but haven't attempted to customize it.
3. I've loaded KDE 3.5.6 and then deleted it, but I've also loaded the 
whole KDE development chain to get some IDE tools for Ruby development. 
So while I don't actually *use* KDE, pretty much the whole code base for 
it is installed.

I'd say your choices are (in increasing complexity):

1. FluxBox or ICEWm if your eyesight can handle the tiny print or if you 
can figure out how to make the fonts bigger,
2. WindowMaker/GNUStep
3. Afterstep if you can figure out how to make it work
4. XFCE 4.4
5. Gnome -- it's actually fairly lightweight these days relative to KDE, 
and you can do *everything* with Gnome.

But I'm sticking with WindowMaker/GNUStep until I get some projects done 
and have some free time to play with XFCE 4.4

IIRC, I think I've tried windowmaker.  Unfortunately, they don't include 
kwin in their feature comparison.  Does it support "vertical maximize" 
via double-click on the title bar?  How about via keyboard shortcut?  
Also, I don't see a screenshot of their switcher with 100+ applications 
(just counted, and my workstation has 168 open windows.)  And, it looks 
like their dock doesn't really act as a taskbar. (Does it?  If so, does 
it do grouping?)

Debian manages the kernel with apt, or can if you want it to.  But it
doesn't schedule your current kernel for removal on your next boot when
you install a new one, you have to do that manually.  Thus if something
goes horribly wrong with the newly installed kernel, you always have
your previous kernel to fall back on and boot into.

I'm not sure about a mechanism to protect config files.  Arch Linux's
pacman has such a mechanism, similar to Gentoo's portage.  With Debian,
apt will always ask before overwriting any config files if it detects
that you or your system have altered them, and give you the option of
keeping your current config or replacing it with the maintainer's
version.  But I'm 90% sure it does not do this for grub's menu.lst,
which Debian generates automagically:

# Put static boot stanzas before and/or after AUTOMAGIC KERNEL LIST

### BEGIN AUTOMAGIC KERNELS LIST
## lines between the AUTOMAGIC KERNELS LIST markers will be modified
## by the debian update-grub script except for the default options below

Actually I think Debian's method is pretty sweet because it's easy and
flexible.  If you want always to have apt keep the kernel updated you
can install:

linux-image-2.6-k7

That way, you'll always get the latest image for Linux kernel 2.6 for
32-bit AMD machines.  If, on the other hand, you want a specific image,
you can install:

linux-image-2.6.18-3-k7

That way, apt won't try to upgrade your kernel when a newer image is
available.

Anyway, works for me, but I'm not really into kernel compiling. :-)  All
this does remind me, however, that I have some pretty old kernels laying
around I should purge.

I have much less stringent needs than you do, apparently. On my 
desktops, the upper left corner has a gizmo known as the Clip. To this 
clip, you can attach icons for the applications you use the most. By 
default they're invisible until you mouse over them. That's what I use 
to start graphic applications like Thunderbird.

I can't personally think of a realistic situation where I would have 
more than five windows open at a time. But I have a small (17 inch ... 
1152x864) screen, and if I *do* by some chance need lots of windows, 
I'll just fire up another desktop.

In my list, I failed to mention Enlightenment. Now that one is, I think, 
very cool. You have an icon box, a little gizmo with all of your 
desktops, up to 64 desktops eight wide by eight deep, and just about 
every possible keyboard, mouse and menu shortcut (and I think some 
impossible ones). I used to use it all the time, but for some reason, 
when I tossed out KDE, it seemed distinctly inferior to the others. I 
think if you like a huge wide and deep workspace, Enlightenment may be a 
good choice.

Then there's Compiz. I haven't been able to get it up and running, but 
I've heard great things about it. Enlightenment is just about the limit 
in terms of eye candy that I can stand, however. :)

Hi Guys!
I finally decided to delve into the darkside and use Fedora Core (I'm a
hardcore slackware guy usually) .. and I'm interested in using Xen or VM
Ware to install a guest or two so I can play around with virtualization. Can
anyone point me to some docs or good reading on virtualization in general
and installation off either Xen or VM Ware?


Thanks!

I mis-counted. I just brought up Enlightenment and it's still eight wide 
but it's now 32 deep! Essentially you have 32 layers, each layer being 
eight screens wide. I usually set it eight wide by only one deep, 
however. Check out the window decorations on the Ganymede theme. :) :)

Check out http://www.vmware.com/products/free_virtualization.html

Download vmware server and vmware server console, and you'll be all
set!  Be sure to click on "Register for your free serial number(s)"
when you download vmware server.  The serial numbers are free, and
you'll need them to run the product.  You can get up to 100 serial
numbers per request.  Get all 100 so you won't have to deal with it
again.

If you run gentoo, you can get both products via portage.  You still
need to go to the download page and get the serial numbers.

Xen is better for running linux on linux.  I've never messed with it
personally, so I can't give any more details.  I've only used guests
that were set up by someone else.  For instance, I don't know if you
install a guest linux OS of your choice in the guest vm, or if you
simply tell xen to punch out a new copy of the host OS.  I would tend
to think the latter is true.  If xen meets your needs, it will perform
way better than vmware, since it allows the guests to talk much more
directly with key hardware (like the hard drive).

Thanks Carlos! Thats what I needed to know. I'm going to give VM Ware a spin
and then try out Xen.

Comcast only cares about the MAC of the modem for provisioning of the 
service.  This is what I replied to.  You guys are bringing up a 
separate issue now.  What happens behind the modem is solved by power 
cycling it with a new machine being plugged in.  This is just crappy 
policy on their firmware (if you're correct), which most people will 
never see, as most people aren't switching computers like that.

No, this is not possible as your computers MAC addresses are not seen 
outside your router.  Only your routers MAC will be seen by the next 
upstream router and so on.  Computers behind a NAT box are counted using 
the id field in the IP header.  On Open/FreeBSD, this field is 
randomized and thus looks like thousands or millions of computers to the 
ISP attempting to track machines using this method.  Maybe Linux does 
this too, I don't know.

If you throw a router in there we can only see you routers MAC.  But if you
disconnect your computer and connect another with out powering down you
modem...service no workee (That would be the no router, directly to the
computer set up).  I can only see the first MAC on the other side of the
modem.  But if you buy the home networking package (and you have to use the
Comcast branded linksys routers for the home networking package) I can see
all 5 mac addresses on the other side of that router.

Take a look at FVWM -- it is by far the most customizable WM I've run
into (and I've been actively looking for 7+ years).  It plays well
with kde, so you can run a kicker (the kde panel) and various other
things as you may want, and it's been able to do a super set of
everything I've ever wanted to do with Enlightenment, gnome, kde,
windowmaker, metacity, sawfish, blackbox, openbox, fvwm, and others,
with one exception -- compiz / beryl are the only WMs that I've found
that will let me desaturate inactive windows so they appear in black &
white.

I have *not* tried to set up a systray with FVWM, but I've seen pages
that talk about it, and #fvwm on freenode has many very helpful
people.

Don't be scared of by the first screeshots of fvwm you see either..
since it is incredibly configurable, you'll probably *hate* 80% of the
configs you see.  It can look like anything you want, but it may take
some searching / tweaking to get it there.

Feel free to ping me off-list with questions -- I can try to help,
although I'm no expert, and my usage patterns don't exactly jive with
yours (eg: I really like multiple desktops, and I'm currently using
beryl / kde)

No, this is incorrect, at least for Comcast as delivered in eastern
Beaverton with a Linksys (mumble-mumble) modem purchased from a store.
The modem passes through the MAC address of the computer, it does
not rewrite the packets, and Comcast ignores any packets originating
from a different MAC address.

That is for a modem.  If you have a combination modem/firewall/router
(one of those devices with multiple ports at the user end), then the
device is typically programmed to do NAT, and the packets that Comcast
sees are rewritten to come from one MAC address.  I don't have one of
these - I do my own firewalling, with DNS and Openvpn and all sorts
of other things I can't get with an off-the-shelf combo box.  I could
use one of the combo boxes, and they are a good bet for a newbie, but
many folks have just the modem and that is what I thought we were
discussing.  If you are talking about a combo modem/firewall/router,
you should be more precise in your terminology.

I beat my head against the single MAC address issue for a little
while, and the original poster sounds like they encountered a similar
issue, and we are trying to help them.  Please do not confuse them.

The behavior tying the service to one user MAC address is observed,
and is confirmed by the install tech, phone support, and their
on-line documentation - it might be different in your neighborhood
or on your planet, but I doubt it.

I don't believe this is a kernel function.  I believe that is handled by 
the timezone files in /etc.

It is going to be a big pain for anyone who has to manage systems that 
need an accurate time stamp.  Far more money will be spent dealing with 
the problem than would be saved by the change.

That's the first of many things Wil.

For those of you who have weighed in on this topic what about a meeting presentation?

  !KDE*  !Gnome* - Alternate desktop how and why for your computing pleasure

  * Or so heavily modified you won't recognize it.

I sanguinely run a nearly stock KDE[1] but would be interested in why others do
different.

Yeah ... excellent idea for discussion. I've already posted twice on my 
blog about it, but hey, I'd love to hear other folks' opinions. For 
example,

* Is XFCE 4.4 too bloated? :)
* What *can't* you do in twm? :)
* How do you change fonts in IceWM and FluxBox?
* Is there any more bizarre scheme of window decorations than the 
Enlightenment Ganymede theme? :)
* Do "3D" desktops boost productivity, or do they just make work less 
boring? :)
* Is the Linux desktop the ultimate IDE?

   Perhaps ... if you load all the applets. The only Xfce applet I've tried
to us is the battery status indicator, on my notebook, and it has not worked
yet. Real Soon Now I'll upgrade to -4.4 from -4.2 and see if that makes a
difference.

I often hear this (I'm the xfce.org operator and general mish-mash xfce guy) 
from people who use xfce and yearn for the twm days.

people tend to forget that xfwm4 can run great by itself and do all the things 
that twm etc. does great (render windows) and that that kind of modularity makes 
it so good. Just chop out xfdesktop and the other fluff out of xfce4 and it will 
run fine.

it's silly to blame Xfce4 (or any other desktop) for being bloated on the basis 
of (memory footprint, disk space, resources used) when you run it in its full 
configuration (all fluff enabled, all sub-apps started etc).

That's like driving a honda civic with 200lbs of speakers and amplifiers *and* 3 
spoilers. Of course it's bloated. Duh!

KDE itself has only very limited options of being shrunk down by the user. Gnome 
is arguably a lot better.

but the way Xfce is setup certainly beats all of it. You can run xfwm4 as the 
gnome window manager for instance. Or skip using the panels alltogether in 
xfce4, remove the desktop icons...


bottom line: xfwm4 + aterm's are great, light footprint and can handle a 
gazillion of them gracefully, even on low-memory systems. Sure twm is good, but 
doesn't have multiple desktop support. Do you really want to handle 100+ 
terminals with it? I wouldn't

Cheers,

Auke

it should work fine in 4.2... does 'acpitool' output anything useful on your system?

So you'd like to think.  The old IDE drivers are being replaced by
libata-based drivers, which is a newly-engineered infrastructure.
Currently in 2.6.19/.20, the new subsystem is still marked experimental,
but it looks like Fedora 7 might ship with it in April.  One side-effect
of the change is that all the devices appear to be SCSI devices, so your
hda2 will become sda2 (although I wouldn't be surprised if some
translation ends up happening in the new few releases to make the
transition smoother).  That's almost certainly the reason Ubuntu has
started using the filesystem UUID for the boot parameter for the root
filesystem.  (Personally, I use LVM, so my friendly-device names are
independent of the physical volumes.)

This has more information:

Russell,

   I would be happy to do so, but I don't have a /proc/acpi/battery
directory. Perhaps that's why the applet fails, too.

   There is /proc/acpi/power_resource/, but it's empty.

   Is there a magic incantation to create the battery/ directory? This is on
a Sony Vaio PGC-V505BC.

Thanks,

Rich

Nice, and in all the right ways: command-line invocation of X 
application with seldom-used option, a unix sequence that reads like a 
sentence ("watch cat"), and something involving /proc. My inner geek

also, if you love your battery you'd at least add a timeout that's more sane 
that 2secs to this command. There's no need to monitor stuff like this every 2 
seconds. A minute sounds more reasonable to me.

   All it needs is a built-in conversion from mAH to hr:min.

The biggest problem with Cryptography under Windows is that you are not
considered the owner of your machine.  (Especially Vista.)  Given the
actions the OS takes to avoid "unauthorized actions" by the user of the
system, you cannot be certain that the OS is acting in the interests of
another person.

Currently there is file level Cryptography available to business-level users
of Vista, but not home users.  Since it is closed source, it is difficult to
determine if this file system encryption scheme is backdoored for the
benefit of someone else.  If they can't trust you with being allowed to
watch the movies you buy or the music you listen to, what makes you think
they are going to trust you with non-backdoored encrypted file system?  You
might hide pirated movies there!


The other unknowns are the quality of the random number generators, the
algorythms used in the cryptography, and how the information is exposed once
you are logged on.  If the system allows system wide access once the volume
is unencrypted, then you have a problem.  (Linux and Mac have similar
issues, BTW.)  The advantage is that with open systems you can always code
around the weak parts.  With closed systems you have chunks that you
cannot.  And with the new DRM systems, there is code to prevent you from
overriding the OS.

One of the main reasons that I do not use Windows is that the OS is designed
to not allow me to do the things I need to do without getting permission
from Microsoft.  If I get a new motherboard, or need to reinstall, or change
too many bits of hardware, or want to run in a virtual system, or whatever
-- Microsoft gets to stick their nose in and allow or deny those decisions.

In the early days of NT (and it may still be true), you could get around
encrypted content by changing the region to "France".  (Where, at the time,
encryption was illegal.)

There are tools that will allow you to encrypt Windows and can actually do
it right.  I don't know if any of them will work in Vista.  I doubt if they
work now.  I expect they will be made to work by exploiting holes in the
design of Vista.  At least until Vista 2.0.

Russell respondes to the criticism:

a) I don't love my battery, I reserve that emotion for living things;

b) (completely ignorant) is this hurting the battery somehow? if so,
   please explain;

c) but... i want to see how machine activity affects power consumption
   and finer granularity is better for that; and 

d) it's easier to type everytime without that option. ;-)

I used it  about 3 years ago and did a clone of a machine and it took
_forever_  and this was across a 100Mbps switched LAN.  It might be quicker
to boot with a LiveCD and mount another machine as NFS and just dd the
target drive to the NFS server for backup purposes but I haven't tried it
yet :-)

That is really true for shops running Solaris.  Sun's supported patches for
the DST changes modify libc and require a reboot.  My group has expended
more than 4000 man hours since July '06 for this change I am pretty sure the
cost of making this change is a lot higher than any savings.

Right, but Vista is just another step in the long-running story of users 
refusing to take responsibility for their own security and privacy.  m$ 
will (of course) happily help with that blissful ignorance.

However, Linux is not bulletproof, just transparent.  Mac might be 
better than windows, but they are definitely moving away from 
transparent at a rapid rate (and, what's it take to get sudo privileges 
on a Mac anyway?  Just a dialog box (heh. "Web 2.0: get rooted with 
javascript?"))  In short, all the user data on the computer is only as 
secure as root/sudo, which means "as secure as your laziest priveleged 
user."  What distinguishes windows here is that there is practically no 
root, but if m$ is root, so is apple, sun, adobe, nvidia, and red hat 
for that matter.  In short, anything for which you cannot get the 
source should not be run as root.  Otherwise, the only answer to the 
"are we secure?" question has to be shrugging your shoulders and saying 
"maybe."  Might as well just drop what you're doing right now and 
e-mail all of your keys and passwords to the above vendors for safe 
keeping.  (Note, I trust RH more than MS, but I'm not about to mail 
either of them anything.)

Why are users so complacent about computer privacy/security?  There is 
nothing analogous.

How careful are you with the keys to your house?  Ok, but what if you 
lose your keys and have to break into your house?  Most people don't 
rig their house to explode on forced entry, but given strong 
cryptography, a lost key means lost data.  I wager this is unacceptable 
for many users and they will therefore keep a hide-a-key rock somewhere 
(a while back, I was at a mid-sized local retail chain and noticed 
about 3-4 banking and etc username/passwords in plain view on a 
laminated card next to every customer service terminal.)

Most law enforcement is predicated on the idea of recovering stolen 
goods or otherwise punishing the infraction.  Doesn't work so well for 
stolen data, does it?

I just laid my hands on a new (to me) laptop, on which I immediately

I get a text console to use the entire screen.  In the past, for other

With the proliferation of SATA drives, and platforms with both SATA and PATA
drives,  and the growing popularity of bootable USB sticks and external hard
drives for laptops and backups and such,  drive assignment order (which one
is actually hda, which one is sda, which one is the 'first' or boot device)
got seriously hosed, at least in Debian/Ubuntu.  The introduction of UUID in
fstab, ugly as it looks, was, partially at least, to address those issues.
I don't know much about the technical issues involved. "All I know is what I
read in the papers [read 'forums' for 'papers'].

I'm interested in this too.  My work computer, over which I have no
control of the hardware spec, has an ATI video card.  I have yet to
figure out how to get a bigger, better VGA resolution.  Also, I had to
disable the kernel framebuffer support and use the proprietary ATI
driver (in gentoo portage: x11-drivers/ati-drivers) to get any openGL
acceleration.

I have not yet tried the vesafb-style VGA settings.  Perhaps this is
the ticket?  There's always "vga=ask", though it seems you always get
a plethora of crappy choices with that.

Another thing I cannot seem to do with my ATI video card: run multiple
X displays.  Again, I haven't checked this in a while.

The proprietary ATI driver is in a module called fglrx.  The card
looks like this in lspci:

01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc RV370 5B60 [Radeon X300 (PCIE)]

The file that describes the vesafb values is
Documentation/fb/vesafb.txt in the kernel sources.  There's a chart in
there that describes the values and what they mean (1024x768x16bit =
0x317 = 791 decimal).  The vesafb features available to you depend
entirely on the capabilities of the BIOS.

There are alternate framebuffer drivers available, but I have never
had any success with them.

Good stuff.  Thanks!  Once I install the radeon driver, I can check
the vga and multiple-X-display things.  The sample xorg.conf will be
fun to try.

Looks like the package is called x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati in
gentoo.

The vesafb stuff has nothing to do with the X drivers, with the
possible exception that they occasionally conflict with each other
when both trying to access the video hardware.

Just hoping to keep you from going too far down the wrong path :-)

Thanks.  I realize now that I meant to say "vesafb-tng" before.  Now I
actually know what that means.  In the README, "modedb format" is
mentioned:

"If you are running a 32-bit x86 system and you decide to use
vesafb-tng, you can either compile the driver into the kernel or use
it as a module.  The graphics mode you want to use is in both cases
specified using the standard modedb format."

>From Documentation/fb/modedb.txt:

"Valid mode specifiers (mode_option argument):

     <xres>x<yres>[M][R][-<bpp>][@<refresh>][i][m]
     <name>[-<bpp>][@<refresh>]

with <xres>, <yres>, <bpp> and <refresh> decimal numbers and <name> a
string.  Things between square brackets are optional."

This is the format I was trying to refer to.  I've seen
"vga=1024x768 at 85" work where "vga=791" does not.  I should look at the
kernel config on one such box and see if it's using vesafb-tng.

Good call.  I think that using the xorg ati driver (instead of the
proprietary one) will help as long as I am able to re-enable the
kernel framebuffer support.  What you said (namely, that X and VGA are
seperate entities) makes me think this will be the case.  The
proprietary ATI driver, then, must be an X driver and a VGA driver,
for it takes over both roles.

Red Hat has *zero* closed-source components?  I thought they were 
holding a couple of their "enterprise" components (config and update 
tools?) under the vest.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe they were at one point 
and aren't now.

I could have said "and even debian for that matter."  Even if everything 
is open, if you're running their binaries, you're trusting them to play 
nice (as root.)  How do you know it is the same source without exactly 
replicating their build process and checking the resultant binary?

I've been running with a bash prompt that displays the current state
of the battery:

|rogue on escher |charged| @ 18:45:16 ~/bin|

.....
|rogue on escher |77%| @ 18:48:02 ~/bin|
.....
|rogue on escher |AC 89%| @ 19:05:21 ~/bin|
etc..

Here are the scripts to make it work:

bat_mon.sh    http://www.ciscavate.org/data/bat_mon.sh

Then set up your prompt to call the script in your .bashrc:

if [ $TERM = "dumb" ]; then
    PS1="-(\t)-(\u@\h)-(\w)-\n-(\$) "
else
    PS1=" |\u on \h |\$($HOME/bin/bat_mon.sh)| @ \t \w|\n $DEFAULT"
fi
export PS1

It runs once every time your prompt is displayed, and works in a VT ;)
  (with colors!)

There's lots of trust conferred even if you are compiling source
yourself. You're trusting the authors of the source (I sure don't read
every line of the few things I do compile), the host of the source
(did you check the hash on that tarball?), the compiler (
http://www.acm.org/classics/sep95/ ), etc.

Certainly.  My original point was that responsibility for security comes 
down to the user.  I suppose I should have said something about a 
"spectrum of trust" or what-not.  In the m$ and apple case, you're 
placing ultimate trust on the vendor, so you might as well just mail 
them the keys now.

>if m$ is root, so is apple, sun, adobe, nvidia, and red hat^W^Wdebian 
>for that matter.  ...  Otherwise, the only answer to the 
>"are we secure?" question has to be shrugging your shoulders and saying 
>"maybe."

Sure, it's not exactly practical to answer definitively, but it is much 
easier to trust a completely open-source vendor than a completely 
closed-source one.  The irony is that the amount you are required to 
trust them is the inverse of the amount that you should.

Typically I get this error if an update was interrupted (`apt-get
update`, or `aptitude update` was killed).  Of course you could get this
if you use 3rd party repositories.

Try and `aptitude update` to see if this fixes the issue.  The "-28"
kernel was a fix for the latest consolidated round of local exploits.

I have a dv5040us that I just love. I have Mandriva 2007 on it, and 
everything works.

The magic incantation you want it vga=ask. This will prompt you for a 
value, and give you the options with a keystroke.

I know Mandriva set mine up with vga=788 in lilo.

Computer security:

Super encryption, and super paranoia, is a little hard to justify
unless you live in a bunker with 12 inch steel walls.  My computers
can be compromised with a few weeks of supercomputer time, or thirty
seconds with a glass cutter.  I could increase my security more by
putting bars on the windows than by checking my compiler sources
line by line. 

The cool thing about open source is that many other people ARE
checking those compiler sources line by line, and most of them are
honest.  Can you imagine how famous the discoverer of a compiler
trojan would be?

Laptops are another issue though.  If you have personal info on the 
laptop, you should encrypt.

People have tried to put backdoors in open source before.  (Usually by 
hacking the server where the source resides.)  They were actually 
discovered in most cases because the tarballs had not been properly 
signed.  (Another use for cryptography that goes underused.)

Message-ID: <20070212151557.9v2qicuhc8g40sck@web.robinson-west.com>

I just picked one up off of EBay for $35.  What kind of ATX power supply
and case does this board need?

I figured this board would be a nice migration path for a friend's
Trinity S1584 motherboard that tops out at a 750 mhz slot 1 PIII.
Currently, my friend's system has 3 256 meg PC100 DIMMS and his
processor is a PIII 450.

My friend wants to stick with Windows 2000 professional, though I
figure with this board and a pair of say 800 mhz PIII's that 2000
can be moved into a vmware sandbox.  With this approach, I can
teach my friend to do snapshots and Windows cleanup will get
easier.

I'm shooting for less than $100 total.  The parts on his existing
system being moved to this one.

The ebay seller recommended an Intel and it takes about a management
feature, etcetera.  Unfortunately, I'm have a hard time getting all
the manuals downloaded.  Why doesn't Intel release a single ISO
image when it EOLs a product that contains all relevant documentation,
updates, drivers...

  Lesson Summary

  The three little wolves build several houses out of different
  materials, but the big bad pig uses different tools to destroy each
  one. Finally, the house they build out of flowers appeals to the
  pig, and they all live happily ever after.

Subject: [PLUG] CUPS Problem
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0702131111000.14812@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Printing the internal configuration report for the H-P LaserJet 5 produced
a double-sided, single page output. So, the printing problem is with CUPS
and not the physical hardware.

   I thought that I had a good understanding of CUPS and could fix all the
problems I encountered because I had in the past. This one has me completely
stumped.

   Printer default is duplex mode. /etc/cups/printer.conf definition for this
printer is:

<DefaultPrinter laser5_duplex>
Info Double-sided printing
Location office
DeviceURI socket://lj5:9100/
State Idle
Accepting Yes
JobSheets none none
QuotaPeriod 0
PageLimit 0
KLimit 0
</Printer>

   Regardless of the application I use to send a job to the printer (OO.o,
acroread, xpdf, lpr), even including the printer specification on the
command line, it comes out with each page printed on only one side, but each
page travels through the duplex unit.

   As root running /usr/sbin/printers I cannot delete that printer definition
and recreate it.

   This is distracting and frustrating. If anyone has ideas or a known
solution, please pass it on to me.

TIA,

Rich

Hail!

We're doing a large rsync operation and need to use the checksum mode,
because files' dates are often changing, but not their contents.  I believe
we're just using the rsh-type interface, and it's taking longtemps.  Can
anyone tell me whether running rsync in deamon mode on one end would speed
things up at all?

My theory is that the rsh-mode operation needs to read each file from the
remote machine in order to compare it locally.  If rsyncd could checksum the
files remotely in parallel with the local rsync command, then it should mean
a lot less network I/O.

But enquiring minds want to know:  is that how rsyncd actually works?

one suggestion might be to use lvm snapshots and rsyncing from the

I doubt what I have to say will help you, but I have enountered the
same problem with a Laserjet 5Si. However, it always duplexed in the
past just fine -- upgrading from Ubuntu Dapper amd4 to Edgy amd64 is
what broke it. And I have a Laserjet 8000DN, which is physically the
same printer but with different electronics, and the upgrade did *not*
break duplexing on it.

Other than saying "me too" I'm afraid I have nothing to add. But if you
figure it out, please don't keep it a secret.

   Someone on alt.os.linux.slackware also had a 'me, too' with a Canon
printer.

   I've isolated the problem to CUPS; it's not the hardware itself. When I
print the printer configuration using the panel controls it comes out on
both sides of a single sheet.

   When I run 'lpoptions -l' I see:

Resolution/Resolution: 300fast *600fast 600dpi
Duplex/Duplex: None *DuplexNoTumble DuplexTumble
PageSize/Media Size: *Letter Legal A4 Env10 EnvDL
InputSlot/Media Source: *Default Manual Upper Lower LargeCapacity Envelope
Auto
PageRegion/PageRegion: Letter Legal A4 Env10 EnvDL
Option1/Duplexer: *True False
Option3/Envelope Feeder: True *False
Option2/Lower Cassette: True *False

   Notice line #2: Duplex: None.

   But, when I run 'lpotions' I see:

job-sheets=none,none Duplex=yes _kde-filters=true kde-colormode=GrayScale
kde-margin-bottom=72 kde-margin-left=72 kde-margin-right=72
kde-margin-top=72 kde-orientation=Portrait kde-pagesize=2

   This shows Duplex=yes.

   Then I run 'lpoptions -d laser5_duplex' and see the same as above.

   /etc/cups/loptions contains:

Dest colorp
Dest laser5 penwidth=0 prettyprint=true cpi=12
Default laser5_duplex Duplex=yes

   The trick is to find out why 1) the '-l' option shows no duplex and the
rest do, and 2) why it still won't print on both sides of the paper.

IIRC...

Adding the checksum is not going to speed anything up.  It causes
rsync to bypass what would otherwise be a shortcut, i.e., rsync takes
the "longcut".

I must not have been very clear.  I need to use the checksum feature, but
I'm looking for a way to make that work faster.  The question is, given that
I need to use -c in any case, would it be any faster to use an rsync daemon
and connect to it with the "::" syntax, rather than using the normal
connection mode.

Thanks,

IIRC, rsync will do it's full deal if any of the files metadata
differ: time stamps, size, permissions, etc.  So if your data files
time stamps are changing, then you don't need to use -c.  The -c will
force a full checksum for every file, so assuming that your rsync
includes unchanged (in any way) files, dropping the -c will make it go
faster.

As for comparative performance with rsync daemon, you could have
probably answered that question for yourself by now by testing on a
sample.  I don't know the answer.  My unconfirmed intuition is that it
won't be significantly different.

I'm not sure about that.  I have the suspicion that if the timestamps
differ, rsync will go into its block-by-block checksum comparison.
OTOH, if you use the -c option, it does a whole-file checksum to
determine if they files are in fact different, and only if they are then
it does the block differential algorithm.

If that is the case, then the question is whether there is a net gain or
loss based on:
  1. The cost of unnecessarily doing the block differential when only 
     timestamps change.
  2. The cost of always doing whole-file checksums to avoid frequently 
     doing the block differential.

I'd guess that doing the checksums is still more expensive, because even
in a small percentage of cases where the mtimes do not differ, you're
not having to read a whole file and compute its checksum.  One might
expect the block differential to be "chattier" than whole-file, but it
isn't.  From the rsync tech report:

        The algorithm also only requires one round trip, which minimises
        the impact of the link latency.

It would only make a difference if the server cached checksums and
timestamps and was run in daemon mode (i.e., not out of {x,}inetd), but
I don't think it does.

Well, it would make a difference if the server could produce the checksums
on its own end, for comparison with the client's.  Not only the two be done
in parallel, it would save reading the file over the network.

Unfortunately, I don't have access to this server.  I was just hoping to be
able to tell the IT guy doing this, "say, if you run the daemon, it'll be
faster".  
Guess I'll let him figger it out.

Subject: [PLUG] Crossover office...
Message-ID: <20070214003725.g8tf9un68c4w44k4@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

In the interest of not having to own a copy of Windows to run Office 2003,
this looks interesting.

Apparently Outlook support is weak, but I ignore that part of the
suite anyways and I generally uninstall Outlook when I set Windows
up anyways.

The idea that you have to run the separate applications in separate
containers has me a little concerned.  After all, Excel and Word
probably need to interoperate to work correctly.

At $40-$80, this is a lot cheaper than paying for a vmware workstation
license plus a fully licensed copy of Windows.

Especially if you use Windows update, it's hard to deal with updates
in the Windows world long term.  I've been trying to grab the last
updates to 98SE and 2000, but I am running into trouble.  One of the
updates for 98SE doesn't seem to exist anymore on a Microsoft corporate
support web site.  Why Microsoft didn't release a service pack for 98SE
is totally beyond me with the number of updates there were.

I think crossover office long term is a better approach than vmware,
at least until ReactOS or something similar matures.

Does anyone have experience with this product?  Concerning updates,
if I buy a copy of crossover office today and it substantially improves,
can I trade up?  To just run Word and Excel from the Office 2003 suite,
is crossover office or vmware the best choice?  How about TurboTax
and Quicken?  How about Corel Wordperfect Suite 8?  I've been looking
at 2000 Pro on top of say CentOS, but maybe crossover office will work
and ease migration by removing the need for a copy of Windows.

Well, another concern I have about crossover office is that I don't
want it to make my Linux system as vulnerable as Windows to: worms,
spyware, trojans, and viruses.

Here's what the manpage says:

       -c, --checksum

              This forces the sender to checksum every regular file
              using a 128-bit MD4 checksum.  It does this during the
              initial file-system scan as it builds the list of all
              available files.  The receiver then checksums its
              version of each file (if it exists and it has the same
              size as its sender-side counterpart) in order to decide
              which files need to be updated: files with either a
                                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
              changed size or a changed checksum are selected for
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
              transfer.  Since this whole-file checksumming of all
              ^^^^^^^^
              files on both sides of the connection occurs in addition
              to the automatic checksum verifications that occur
              during a file's transfer, this option can be quite
              slow. [...]

So it looks like I was recalling incorrectly (thanks Wil, for forcing
me to read the manpage!).  The -c avoids the block differential
algorithm in the cases Jason is worried about (timestamp changed,
contents not changed), so it could be faster.

However, if your rsync included bystander files that had unchanged
size, modification timestamps and content, then -c would force a full
checksum where it wasn't needed, and overall the process could be
expected to be slower.

I have been using Crossover Office Pro 5.something for several months
now on Ubuntu Dapper (now Edgy) amd64. The reason I paid the price for
Crossover Office instead of just using Wine is that installing Wine on
64-bit Linux is a PITA -- you just about have to put it in a 32-bit
chroot. 

The way it works is that you create "bottles" to run things in. Each
bottle is a Windows environment, and you can specify whether you want
the bottle to be a Windows 98 environment or a Windows 2000
environment. I installed MS Access 2000 Pro in a Windows 2000 bottle
and it works fine. However, I have long used OpenOffice, even on my
Windows desktop, so I had no desire to install the rest of the Office
2000 suite. As I recall, it not only wanted to install the whole suite
in the same bottle at the same time, but I had a hell of a time getting
it to install *just* Access.

I paid $58 educational price for Crossover Office Pro. The non-pro
version is cheaper, but I decided if I'm going to buy a gun to keep
Microsoft at bay, it better be the biggest gun I can buy.

I have the following installed in Crossover Office: MS Access 2000,
Quickbooks 2000, Internet Explorer 2000, Quicktime (which found Firefox
and Opera, Linux versions, and installed the plugins for them), and
Photoshop 7.0. I also installed CorelDRAW 9.0, but it won't launch.
Installation went without error, but I can't figure out why it won't
launch. And I installed Illustrator 10 and it works fine, except all
the icons in the toolbar do not appear, nor do the little balloon help
thingies. All I get is little black boxes, which makes it pretty hard
to select a tool.

I also installed Adobe Reader 7.0, Windows version. I have Adobe Reader
7.08 Linux version installed, but I cannot get it to print using all
the features of my printers. Sadly, after installing Adobe Reader 7.0
in Crossover Office, I discovered that applications installed in
Crossover Office go through CUPS for printing, so I didn't gain
anything.

There is just one thing left that I need from the Windows world --
Adobe InDesign CS. There are reports of people getting 2.0 to work, but
I have lots of files I need to work on occasionally, and all were
created in CS. (Versions were 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, CS, CS2.) It installed,
but won't launch. And that is the reason I am thinking of going to
VMware Player. Luckily I have a spare Windows XP license that I am not
using.

I'm far from an expert on such things, but Crossover Office is Wine on
steroids. Basically Codeweavers contributes to the Wine project, and
uses Wine as the base for Crossover Office. What you get with Crossover
Office is easier installation and greater ease of use than Wine. And,
while Codeweavers is a commercial for-profit organization, they do
contribute to the Wine project, so you know at least part of what you
are paying is supporting the Linux community. And since it is Wine, it
is not an installation of Windows, therefore I can't imagine how it
could increase vulnerability to attack. You might, however, contract an
Office macro virus. But it could only affect Office, not Linux.

This month...

Haskell as "The New Black" in Open Source
Bart Massey
Assoc. Prof. Computer Science
Portland State University
<bart at cs.pdx.edu>

As an application development language, C has definite
issues; many folks would like to see it replaced.  One
candidate replacement is the Haskell programming language,
perhaps the most usable pure functional language to date.
The Glorious Haskell Compiler (GHC) is a top-notch open
source implementation of Haskell, producing optimized
stand-alone executables in a UNIX/Linux environment.  More
and more, open source is quietly being produced in Haskell.
In this talk, I'll give yet another introduction to
Haskell/GHC, and to its programming and build environment.
I will show off some of the features of Haskell for
application programming, and talk about a few of the success
and failure indicators.

Bart Massey is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at
Portland State University, where he works in open
technology, software engineering, artificial intelligence,
and a few other areas.  Keith Packard's and his Nickle
programming language has been in development for the past
20+ years.  Bart is not a fluent Haskell programmer, but he
is down the hall from many of the inventors of the language
and their advisors, and hopes some of that has rubbed off.

Usual meeting rules apply.

Wine *can* expose you to Windows vulnerabilities, for example the WMF
vulnerability from 2005:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Metafile_vulnerability

Notice the part in that article that talks about Wine.  In this case
Wine implemented their own graphics library but followed the WMF
implementation from MS so closely that they ended up being vulnerable
too.  This is even more true when Wine uses a native DLL.

The typical Linux use case involves running as a non-privileged user
(unlike the Windows use case), but there's still a whole heck of a lot
a compromised non-privileged user process can do that you might not
want it to (like delete your files, run an IRC bot, and spam all your
relatives).

   Whatever happened to Linux From Scratch? That was popular a few years ago
and let people bootstrap their entire installation from souce code.

Trust, of course.  Did I sound like I was really advocating that we all 
start with our own raw machine code and build up from there?

My point was simply that you have to understand who you are trusting to 
have any idea about how secure your systems are.

Say you gave one key to your house to a group of 100 open source hackers 
(assume it is hanging on a hook accessible to any of the 100 but always 
visible to no fewer than 20.)

And, you give another to one random m$ employee that you've never met 
and you don't even know his/her name.

How well are you sleeping?

I am running Kubuntu Edgy and have an audigy-2 sound card.  Since upgrading the 
kernel I get no sound output.  Recording works, but seems at low level.  I have 
raised all sliders in kmix and turned on all switches to no avail.

I ran an older kubuntu live CD to prove the hardware works--system sounds come

I found one report of a similar problem on the ubuntu forum, but no answers.

Anybody have suggestions of where to look for information along the path to a 
solution?

Both ends compute block-level checksums and never does the entire file
get transferred over the network (unless it's missing from the client
side).  See the description from the tech report:

http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/tech_report/node2.html

It does, however, seem like the checksums on each end are not
necessarily done in parallel, but I think due to the pipelining they
will at least be both working, even if one is behind the other.

My two bits... I am writing to you from an xp installation running in vmplayer. I have run crossover office quite a bit in the past. Personally I prefer the vmware client. I admit the crossover office I used was from about a year ago so I can't speak to the current one but it often seemed clunky and you were limited to xp versions of office etc. All in all I would say it is a good product. I am just a little nit-picky! And I like the latest and greatest...

You don't?

Gentoo used to be there for those that wanted to build from source.  It has
become so easy that you don't learn much by installing it any more.

Linux from Scratch is still around. http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/  I have
not worked with it in a few years.

Thanks, Wil.  What seems implicit in these documents (and what I'm now
trying to determine) is that that algorithm only applies when connecting to
an rsync daemon on the remote side.  The man page says rsync can connect
"using a remote-shell program as the transport (such as ssh or rsh) or
contacting an rsync daemon directly via TCP."  I may still not understand
the basic operation, but it seems like if there's no daemon involved, then
the client rsync would have to read the files over the network to generate
the checksum (which differs from the remote host doing it).

Huh?  Each side computes its own checksum.  Then the checksums are compared.

When connecting via rsh or ssh, the remote shell basically starts rsync 
on the other end (think of it as your own private daemon.)  It's my 
understanding that once you get that far, algorithmically the operation 
is identical. The difference is simply that the communication is 
running (on pipes?) through rsh/ssh vs direct TCP.

If you want to learn more about the innards, lookup how to use your 
authorized_keys files and the SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND variable to 
intercept the remote shell command, then figure out how to strace rsync 
on the remote end for extra propeller beanie points.

I imagine there is some overhead to the tunnel, but since the data being 
communicated is "these changed, these did not" sort of stuff, I would 
guess you would only see a noticeable difference when you *benchmark* a 
sync that is pushing a lot of changed data (e.g. full tree to an empty 
one or other significant changeset.)  That really depends on the rsync 
TCP protocol vs ssh, but I believe you're paying for encryption over 
ssh and that may be worth the price.

My understanding is as follows. Please correct me if I have this wrong.

When you run rsync by itself and sync a file with another system, rsync
forks the shell on the
other system and starts an rsync server.   At that point rsync is running on
both sides of the
transfer.

With rsync running as a daemon, you save yourself the step of starting rsync
on the server machine, because
it has already been started.

After the connection has been made, both ways of running will behave pretty
much identically, and therefore
neither one of them will be significantly faster than the other.

You can use ssh transport with the rsync deamon also.

I also think the ssh overhead would be worth the price unless you are
syncing totally public data.

Thank you, Mr. Wilhelm.  That helps.  I didn't realize rsync was started
automatically on the remote end, so I was guessing the files had to be read
over the network by the client.  But your description makes more sense.

It's making life rough for the group I work in. I'm a developer but we have 
numerous development, QA, and production boxes that all run Solaris and so 
it's been a hassle for some time now. We have an SA group that does all of 
the patches and they've been scheduling DST patches for days now. I think the 
only guarantee we have as to when DST patches are done are on production 
servers is that they're done at night. For the rest of our boxes they're 
scheduled to be patched sometime during the work week.

I think we'll be done patching by the end of February.

For Tony and every other person working at a place where this has been a problem.

Don't your admins have regularly scheduled maintenance?  At my workplace (US Bank)
there is a large population of Solaris boxes, and AIX, mainframes, MSWin servers. 
This daylight savings time has largely been a non event - almost all the required
patching has been done during scheduled maintenance periods.

For the Solarias systems I'm most dependent on, this is during the quarterly DR
exercise when we take systems off line for 24 hours to ensure the recover plans
work and side effects are flushed out.

Now this looks spiffy!  Database backend, invoicing, bug tracking,
decent documentation, etc.  It's definitely not a bookkeeping system,
but I'm no bookkeeper.  I'm going to give this one and sql-ledger a

Subject: [PLUG] open files...
Message-ID: <20070214163146.ap4s9qg99ck84s4w@web.robinson-west.com>

How about a bash daemon that wakes up every 10 minutes and backs up
my postgresql database.  What about open files?  I don't want to shut the
database down every 10 minutes.

If postgres is being accesssed and a file is being written at the same time
I am trying to copy that file for backup purposes, is the result defined?

Instead of trying to make a backup every 10 minutes, another approach
is to watch for file access and if the operations on the files being
accessed don't complete, roll them back.  Requires you have a copy of
the specific pre modified files to roll back to.

The database program is running on a machine that is diskless and
not power protected.  The database file system is an NFS volume
that is power protected.  Am I going to be forced to throw a cheap
battery backup unit onto the diskless machine to prevent
corruption?

What might work is a network file system that works differently than
NFS.  When the database wants to change file X, it can't overwrite it
directly.  Instead, this file system would let the database change
a copy of file X that is elsewhere and on success of that operation,
modify the actual file safely.  For this to work right, I think
that further access to that file has to be prevented until the
current transaction is complete.

A last option that comes to mind is running the database on a
ram drive so that essentially I start with a copy that works on
every reboot.  I might change some user's horde preferences.
Perhaps email attachments could be lost that are stored in the
database but not the initial image.

Subject: [PLUG] Ruminations on rsync
Message-ID: <20070215135850.17bcd108.johnxj@comcast.net>

Yesterday I was trying to fix OpenOffice.org and in the process I
stumbled across Grsync in Synaptic. It's a Gnome GUI front end for
rsync. I installed it to check it out. It didn't make a launch item in
Applications, so I launched it from the command line. Didn't seem like
a bad little app, so I decided to take it for a spin. I mounted my USB
procket drive, made a new folder on it, then told it to rsync ~/ to the
new folder, excluding one 14 GB folder that I didn't need backed up
(mp3s, that I have copies of elsewhere). The total to back up came to
9.8 GB. The USB dirve had about 40 GB free space. 

Rsync sent the CPU to 100% while it was working. It got to about 12%
and hung with the CPU at 100%. Actually, the command line said "core
dump," and then I saw that rsync was no longer copying files and that
the CPU was pegged at 100%. I waited awhile to see if the CPU would go
back to normal, but after ten minutes it was still at 100%. The red
light on the USB drive was still on also, so I unmounted it. After a
couple more minutes the red light went back to green and I pulled out
the plug. The CPU stayed at 100%. I ran top and couldn't see anything
running that shouldn't be. I also looked in System > Administration >
System Monitor, and didn't see any processes that shouldn't be there --
e.g., no zombie copies of rsync. I had started this right after
rebooting and had nothing else launched other than system stuff, so I
just shut the computer down and restarted. After restarting I remounted
the USB drive and noted that rsync had copied things to it -- there
were files in the new folder.

Now, I have been vexed for ages with rsync hanging or failing in the
middle of a job. I can copy the whole 9.8 GB in ~/ to the USB drive
with the cp command. And tar seems to work OK too. But rsync is flaky.
It will also hang if I try to rsync to a USB drive hanging on a Windows
2000 desktop over the ethernet.

A couple weeks ago I subscribed to an e-list for rsync. I note constant
posts from people about rsync hanging. I am slowly arriving at the
conclusion that rsync is not to be trusted, at least the version I have
available in Synaptic for Ubuntu amd64. At first I thought the problem
was in USB 2.0 on Ubuntu amd64, but the fact that it also hangs going
over ethernet tells me that that assumption is unwarranted. And the
fact that cp and tar work but rsync hangs tells me that the problem
must be in rsync.

Has anyone else enountered flakiness with rsync? Do my conclusions seem
logical? And if rsync is not usable for me, can anyone else think of a
simple backup solution for someone who needs to back up a laptop on an
irregular as-needed basis?

Better to stick to just the second part of that conclusion.  It seems to 
me that sync has been very trustworthy for everyone else.

Agreed.  There may be local factors that are coming into play.  For
instance, I have been struggling with evolution for months now, for it
kept crashing every time I selected the "inbox" folder.  Turned out
that all I had to do was delete the ~/.evolution directory and restart
the app.  I am guessing that there was some metadata in that directory
that was created under an old version of evolution, and the newer
version(s) didn't like it.  Perhaps you should uninstall rsync, delete
EVERY file that has anything to do with the utility, and reinstall.

Not typically.  The only flakiness I've found is trying to mirror from
mirrors.kernel.org, but that's a well-known problem[1].

I note that I have version 2.6.8.

That's a good suggestion! 

However, just went to do a "complete removal" via Synaptic, which I
think is pretty much the same as --purge, and I discovered that
Synaptic will also delete Grsync, Dirvish and Ubuntu-Standard. The
first two I can just reinstall, but Ubuntu-Standard says:

The Ubuntu standard system
This package depends on all of the packages in the Ubuntu standard
system. This set of packages provides a comfortable command-line
Unix-like environment.
It is also used to help ensure proper upgrades, so it is recommended
that it not be removed.

So before I render my system unusable I better research what
Ubuntu-Standard does.

When you are trying to track hardlinks (which is a useful thing to do)
and you are rsync'ing a large tree, it does tend to use a lot of
memory.  (This was my experience as of a year ago or so).

I'm unsure how or whether it is possible with the higher-level
front-ends, however with dpkg: `dpkg --purge --force-depends rsync`

Most likely it is simply a meta-package that depends on other packages,
forcing them to be installed. So removing it shouldn't break anything,
but better safe than sorry. See the above. You can also force the
reinstall of the package simply by telling `dpkg` to install it.

   Which explains why Perl is so obtuse and requires a priesthood (with tech

A multitude of visuals from Life of Brian, involving the shrieking of

dispossession of large rocks flash through my consciousness at the
mention of Perl in that context.

But then the calming mellifluous certitude of Lisp returns and I

Note from Ubuntu forum:

ATTENTION:

Due to an unavoidable ABI change the Ubuntu 6.06 and Ubuntu
6.10 kernel updates have been given a new version number, which
requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules
you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you
have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the
new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard
kernel metapackages (linux-386, linux-powerpc, linux-amd64-generic), a
standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.

Is emu10k1 third party?  To what does the pronoun "this" in the last sentence refer?


Any offerings are most welcome.

-Denis

Message-ID: <20070216184532.GF30127@amethyst.spiritone.com>

Wrong place to ask?  I don't think so.  From a Linux user's
perspective, which should I buy?

I'm about to buy a new computer.  My first act will be to repartition
and install Debian or Ubuntu.  But since I'm paying the M$ tax, I
might as well think for a second about which of the currently
available OSes I'd rather have for my ~$90.

I'm leaning toward XP because it's easier to run virtualized (I'm not
considering one of the higher-cost Vistas) and because I expect it'll
spy on me less.  It's the devil I know.  But Vista has a better chance
of still being useful toward the end of this machine's life -- about 4
years I expect.

Thoughts and sage advice?  Snide remarks? :-)

Thanks!

If you're after a platform that's stable and in reasonably good 
working condition now, go with XP. I suspect Microsoft will still be 
supporting it several years from now. If you're looking for next 
year's best gaming platform, I'd bet on Vista.

In fact, the only reasons I'd go with Vista now is for platform 
testing and future gaming support.

Current gaming support on Vista is sub-par for anything that demands 
video.  The drivers are about 10% slower on Vista (mostly due to all the 
DRM crap).

If you want virtualization, you want XP.  If you want games to work today, 
you want XP.  If you want to watch movies or play CDs without the OS 
trying to degrade your unauthorized experience, you want XP. (Or Linux 
with xine and win32 codec support.)

I know of no good reason to get Vista at this point.  Microsoft will soon 
make it so you have no choice in the matter, but until that day, avoid it 
if you can.

Subject: [PLUG] Compiling Qt4
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0702161315530.32408@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I need to replace the distribution-standard qt-3.3.7 with qt-4.2.2 so that
I can build the development version of an application. I need a feature of
that application that's only in the subversion trunk.

   When I follow the Trolltech instructions (configure; make; make install),
specifying --prefix=/usr/local and --no-stl (because Slackware does not
support the STL), it builds and installs just fine. There are libQt* in
/usr/local/lib.

   Then I 'export QTPATH=/usr/local/lib' and specify to the application's
configuration '--with-frontend=qt4'. However, there is no 'qt4' to be found.

   I've asked on the application's developer list what they suggest, and I'm
also asking here to see if you folks can help me. I need to build the new
version of the app ASAP, particularly before the end of the weekend so I can
use it to produce work that must be delivered by Monday morning.

I am embarrassed to say the whole problem was with the mixer settings.  They do 
not make any sense to me, and what is required for function is different than it 
was before the update. (two particular switches, Audigy Analog/Digital and the 
IEC958 Optical Raw, both on caused it to not work)

Don't feel bad.  No one else understands them either (at least I
don't).  When I encounter problems, I go in, unmute and crank every
knob up as far as it will go until I observe some change, then fine
tune from there.

Message-ID: <20070216175938.906cef6f.johnxj@comcast.net>

I'm having bizarro things going on with OpenOffice.org 2.0.4 on Edgy amd64. Because of problems with OOo after upgrading from Dapper to Edgy, which also upgraded OOo 2.0.2 to 2.0.4, I did a complete uninstall of 2.0.4 with Synaptic, then used dpkg to install some debs I found for OOo 2.1 (2.1 is not in the Ubuntu amd64 repositories yet). The install went fine, but OOo 2.1 is awful. And the upgrade didn't fix the problems I had with 2.0.4. So I uninstalled 2.1 (with Synaptic) and then reinstalled 2.0.4 (again, with Synaptic). And now I have even more problems with 2.0.4.

I have done a complete uninstall of 2.0.4 with Synaptic ("complete uninstall" is supposed to remove all configuration files as well), and renamed the ~/.openoffice2 folder which holds my personal settings, then reinstalled. And doing so didn't fix a thing. Same broken installation. (Lots of stuff not working that has worked since I started with OOo several years ago.)

So just now I did dpkg -l to find a list of everything installed, which showed that openoffice.org-core02 was listed as "rc." This package is from 2.1, not 2.0.4, so I decided to nuke it for sure. (OOo 2.0.4 uses just one file named -core; OOo 2.1 uses -core01 to -core09.) I did the following:

Note that dpkg -l shows it as "rc," but the man page doesn't exactly say what that means except that it means "remove" and "config files." Does "remove" mean it is installed and should be removed? Or that it has been removed? Or what? Anyway, I tried to purge it, but I guess it ain't there.

I have done a complete uninstall of 2.0.4 via Synaptic, followed by a reinstall of just the base program (none of the optional goodies), but something is still screwing it up. It worked before installing OOo 2.1, so 2.1 left something behind or messed up something else. I want to nuke both installations so I can be sure that all remnants of both are gone, then reinstall. Can anyone suggest a way to be absolutely sure everything from both 2.0.4 and 2.1 is gone?

Yeah.. why pay the tax at all, if you don't want to use either? I
understand that many people don't want to mess with building their own
desktops, but there *are* vendors[1] out there that'll sell you a box
without any OS.

Get a white box from a local vendor (Enu? Pacific Solutions? End PC Noise) and
don't pay the tax.

Wow.  I can only hope that the number of irate windows users will be a 
fraction of what he suggests.  Vista may indeed be the suicide note.

The Home Editions of Vista cannot be virtualized as per the EULA.  You 
will want to get Vista Business, which isn't much more $$$.  It's about 
the same as XP Pro on the OEM ticket.

Your latter comment is the direction I take.  XP's mainstream support 
will end 1Q of '09.  That means only critical patches will get released. 
  What MS thinks is critical vs the public is up for debate.  On a 
Windows list I'm on, the DST changes coming up are causing big headaches 
for some as Win2K is not getting publicly available patches.  There are 
methods from MS for updating 2K, but no nifty little patch.  So, go for 
the one that's supported longer.

The DRM crap in the drivers is eating resources even if there is no 
need for DRM. Happy gaming!

The Dell 'n' series ships with FreeDOS, to be sure (and I just love 
getting a printed copy of the GPL from Dell in the box!), but the 
machines aren't really any less expensive than those shipping with the 
bottom-rung version of whatever Windows release Dell is hawking at the 
moment.

It's nice that you don't have to dump more XP Home (or whatever) 
rubbish in the trash, but it won't save you any money, at least not 
from Dell.

Is this because windows is basically free beer for them?  We all know 
the OEM's don't pay retail for Windows, but how much is it?  $5?

What difference does that cost make?  It's shared by all OEMs and doesn't
present a competative disadvantage.  It's a pass through to the next purchaser
and an element in determining cost of goods when calculating gross margins.

Every release of Windows has shown lower performance gaming benchmarks 
than the previous as driver support in general gets caught up.  So I'm 
not sure how you conclude DRM is the source for it this time.  I would

He came to the conclusion by paying attention to news stories on Vista.

Maybe you could help me out a little bit more.  From the article:

"This burden extends beyond DRM'd music into games as well. For example 
the content-protected version of the game Flatout 2 runs 15% slower than 
the same game without content protection)."

The article links to the content protection StarForce:
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarForce

The wiki and the article do not indicate DRM+Vista=bad gaming 
performance.  I interpret this as comparing DRM's overhead in Vista, 
where it applies, to that of content protection in video games, where 
used.  I don't see him saying that Vista is the culprit of your claims.

Additionally, I see several gaming sites that show benchmarks between XP 
and Vista with most games showing single digit differences in FPS.  This 
is what I was alluding too.  With better driver support for the new OS, 
these benchmarks will get closer.

You are right, DRM is the symptom. The source is the MS philosophy of 
adding value for MS, not the customer. DRM is just the latest 
contributor to bloatware as Bill makes his play to own the channel 
for high definition entertainment content.

 From http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/vista_cost.html

/snip/
As part of the bus-protection scheme, devices are required to 
implement AES-128 encryption in order to receive content from Vista. 
This has to be done via a hardware decryption engine on the graphics 
chip, which would typically be implemented by throwing away a GPU

Hey, this is great - you posted the follow up with enough information that 
someone doing a search in the future will quickly find a great lead in checking 
out their own sound problems.

Good post.

Well that is what I did, and it failed!  Why? Because those two particular

Thanks to both of you for the kind words and sound advice :).

I'm not sure that this is all Bill.  The encryption used in DVD's and 
newer HD content (et al) isn't free.  Everything I've read says Linux 
users have to pay money to get the tech to play in their OS's.  Maybe 
Bill is more than happy to accommodate them, but that's another

I read that EMI is considering releasing their entire music collection

compete with iTunes.  Whatever, I say.  Just do it. :)

Linux Clinic!
Sunday February 18  (third Sunday)
1PM at Free Geek
1731 SE 10th Avenue  (southeast door)
Portland, OR

Bring your Linux machine and we will help you fix it, or install
that new app, or...  We have monitors, keyboards, meece, network
connections, wireless, and some install disks.   No classes, no
instruction, just pure neighborly tweaking and debugging.  We
might not get it all done, but we will have a good time.

And if you know it all already, bring your machine and show 
others how it is done.  

And if that does not convince you, John often brings cookies.

Even on gentoo, you would have to actually inspect the code in all
those source tarballs.  It simply isn't feasible.  You just have to
trust.  The kernel would be a nightmare to audit.  Such low-level code
can have bugs that are virtually inpossible to detect, especially in
assembly routines.

There's always the "if you can't beat them, join them" philosophy.
The most paranoid OS I can think of is Red Flag Linux.  You could just
run that.  You'd want to make sure you're getting a real Chinese copy,
not something they've adulterated to infect the rest of the world
with.

If I am able to make it. Would someone be able to help me setup vmplayer?
I have the Dell distribution CDs for WinXP that I currently dual-boot to.
Besides the PC, what else should I bring, (mouse, keyboard, monitor?)?

There was some discussion about dedicating a Clinic to vmplayer. In
fact, at the last Clinic I was going to engage Keith (our resident
vmplayer guru) in holding my hand while I installed Player on my Edgy
computer. Unfortunately other problems prevented that from happening.
Maybe this time we can get to it. 

So yes, bring your computer and stuff. If your monitor is heavy we can
borrow one from Free Geek, but definitely bring the rest.

Just thought I'd mention that VMPlayer will not help you to install a
new guest OS from scratch.  You'll be dependent upon someone with
VMWare Server or Workstation.  VMWare Server is a free product, and it
allows you to play as well as install.  If one were to ask me for
advice, I'd say "forget VMPlayer; get VMWare Server instead".

VMPlayer does have its uses, for example in a lab setting.  But using
it to play an already-existing guest OS is ludicrously simple, and I
don't think it's what you're after anyway.  I say this based on the
fact that you were wondering which OS install CD to bring to create a
new guest OS.

Subject: [PLUG] Problems Installing Debian Sarge On Laptop
Message-ID: <45D8B7FB.8020203@comcast.net>

Perhaps some wise soul can help.  I am attempting to install Debian 
3.14r on my HP Pavilion ze4230.  The process hangs on the select 
language screen, when the setup stops responding to keyboard commands.

In the past, I have successfully installed both Mandriva and Ubuntu on 
this laptop.  The keyboard is a ps2, as this old laptop's original 
keyboard is kaput.

I am assuming that the hangup is caused by some hardware interface 
problem, being as it occurs so early in the installation process.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I've always wanted to configure a debian box, as this is some sort of 
rite of passage.  However, I'm not off to a promising start.

Thanks,

Terry

I currently tri-boot WinXP Pro, or one of two linux partitions.
What I'd like to do, is always boot into my stable (ist) Linux 
partition, then bring up my already existing partitions as guest OS's. 
I'll probably have to increase my RAM before this will be practical, but 
I'd like to understand the setup better.

Install-time problems are always tough.  One thing to try: turn off
acpi and local apic at boot time.  If you can adjust your kernel
command line at the boot prompt, add "pci=noacpi nolapic".  I usually
use "nolapic" to get a machine with and ATI video card to make it
through an X11 installer like redhat.

To the potential clinic attendee who asked about VMware installs
at the clinic, sorry, I had left by 11.  I was busy helping other
folks all day, so I might not have had time to work on VMware 
anyway.  Perhaps we need to schedule an alternate time for VMware
installs.  Does someone want to organize this, and find a venue?

This is obsolete information.  While I have experimented with Server
and Workstation, I did not need either product to create the vmdk
and vmx files necessary to create fully functional vmplayer guest
instances.  I just used easyvmx.com. which generates them for 
download after filling in a web form.  There are half a dozen sites
like easyvmx.com that offer similar services, and some might be
better, but I've done about 10 guests with easyvmx and I'll stick
with what works . I don't know whether they use a vmware product to
generate these files, but I could easily imagine a simple script
could do it.

It does help to have a copy of vmware tools, which does not come
with vmplayer, but you can get the tools from one of the demo
install disks for the spendy products, or download it from some
places on the net, or get it from a friend.  It is mostly a few
megabytes of better drivers for the vmware virtual peripherals.

In my experience, the beta versions of the products are crippleware,
which is why I don't use them.  They are instrumented with all sorts
of debug stuff, and are very slow compared to VMplayer.  YMMV.

The biggest problem with vmware so far is that the installer wants
to set you up with the wrong kind of networking.  VMware offers 
three kinds of networking, NAT, host-only, and bridged.  IMHO,
the best for most applications is host-only with NAT, but the
installer has a strong bias to build bridged networks.  That is
true (so far) of Server, Workstation, and VMWare player. 

When designing a Windoze guest, it is better to use a small vmdk
virtual disk, and to keep as much of the Windoze data and programs
in the Linux file system, and let Samba share them with Windoze.
That keeps the vmdk files small.  This means setting up Samba
fairly early in the guest install process.   However, when you 
are done, many Windoze programs will install entirely in the
mounted share, which means multiple guests can share the same
programs and data.  With enough memory and CPU for the host, it is
possible to run a "Windows Server" that supports perhaps 10 or 20
Windows guests, each run over X from other physical computers 
on the LAN, all using the same copy of a program.  If the program
is old enough, the program's EULA may not forbid this kind of
multiple simultaneous access.

I have VMWare experience I use it all the time. If you want to have me help out I probably could. I have never attended one of your physical meetings. I am Justin Breithaupt from Pomeroy WA 99347. Tell me what you need and where you need me to be and when. My main experience is installing Linux and Microsoft products in VMWare on Linux and Windows systems. I have used VMWare player as well but VMWare server is my cup of tea. I have not used the networking feature to connect to another user's VMWare machine over a network. I have never needed to. I have used VMWare for Remote Assistance to connect to regular computers. I have also found that VISTA runs much better in VMWare than on an actual computer. Same with XP and 98. I can explain why in person. It's a little complicated.

This is obsolete information.  While I have experimented with Server
and Workstation, I did not need either product to create the vmdk
and vmx files necessary to create fully functional vmplayer guest
instances.  I just used easyvmx.com. which generates them for 
download after filling in a web form.  There are half a dozen sites
like easyvmx.com that offer similar services, and some might be
better, but I've done about 10 guests with easyvmx and I'll stick
with what works . I don't know whether they use a vmware product to
generate these files, but I could easily imagine a simple script
could do it.

It does help to have a copy of vmware tools, which does not come
with vmplayer, but you can get the tools from one of the demo
install disks for the spendy products, or download it from some
places on the net, or get it from a friend.  It is mostly a few
megabytes of better drivers for the vmware virtual peripherals.

In my experience, the beta versions of the products are crippleware,
which is why I don't use them.  They are instrumented with all sorts
of debug stuff, and are very slow compared to VMplayer.  YMMV.

The biggest problem with vmware so far is that the installer wants
to set you up with the wrong kind of networking.  VMware offers 
three kinds of networking, NAT, host-only, and bridged.  IMHO,
the best for most applications is host-only with NAT, but the
installer has a strong bias to build bridged networks.  That is
true (so far) of Server, Workstation, and VMWare player. 

When designing a Windoze guest, it is better to use a small vmdk
virtual disk, and to keep as much of the Windoze data and programs
in the Linux file system, and let Samba share them with Windoze.
That keeps the vmdk files small.  This means setting up Samba
fairly early in the guest install process.   However, when you 
are done, many Windoze programs will install entirely in the
mounted share, which means multiple guests can share the same
programs and data.  With enough memory and CPU for the host, it is
possible to run a "Windows Server" that supports perhaps 10 or 20
Windows guests, each run over X from other physical computers 
on the LAN, all using the same copy of a program.  If the program
is old enough, the program's EULA may not forbid this kind of
multiple simultaneous access.

Yeah ... don't use the beta versions for anything except finding out if

VMware Server is OK -- it's essentially a cleaned-up version of VMware 
GSX. But GSX itself is a stripped version of Workstation, with some 
"server-like" features. The guest is essentially a parasite -- it runs 
as "root" and all of the guest's user or system time clocks to the 
host's *system* time!! You get what you pay for.

My advice: buy ESX or download Xen. GSX or VMware Server is more trouble 
than it's worth. I have a Windows-host Workstation 5.5 license, which I 
am not planning to upgrade to 6.0.

First, to our esteemed member from Washington, the rest of us are in
Portland and that is where we would want to meet. Considering your zip
code, that would be a fair hike, unless you are planning on being in
the area anyway. In other words, you are more than welcome and your
expertise would be of great benefit, but the vmware installation
session will likely just be for a couple of us, not a major shindig.

And to Keith and Mel, I'm game anytime. I'd suggest we meet at PSU
in SMSU on the second floor where we have our monthly meetings, but if
we're going to have desktop computers there it might get a bit
cumbersome. I wonder if we could prevail on Free Geek for an evening
time. There wouldn't be as many of us as for our regular clinic and we
wouldn't need to set up and take down stuff.

Anyone else is also welcome, even those who just want to watch me
screw up my computer again. Really, it should be a good show. I can
swear fluently in three languages.

I have production vmware server installations humming along just fine.
As you can see they run as the "vmware" user.  The trick is chown'ing
the directory where your vm's will live to the user, and logging into
the server console as that user.  New guests will be created and run as
that user.  You can even chown different guests to different users who
can manage them separately through the console.

One installation has an uptime of 134 days (two guests: one
debian/sarge, one Windows 2003 Server).  No issues.

I was ready to go with vmware infrastructure for a new deployment to
give it a try.   I backed out quickly when I found out VI3 could only be
fully managed using a Windows-only application (the web interface is not
full management).  Ooo this boiled my blood.  If you need it,
VirtualCenter looks like it requires production Windows servers to be
maintained.

So for an Ubuntu/Debian-only guest environment I need redundant Windows
server infrastructure and the talent (and finger crossing) to maintain
it?  Pass.

Another small irritation is VI3 forces an OS on you (RedHat).

XenEnterprise does this too (forcing a RedHat variant as underlying OS).
 Yes, yes, tuned environment, support, etc, etc.

Vmware server runs great on dapper and sarge, though it is not FOSS.
Eventually once KVM is baked and part of Ubuntu, I'll start testing.  I
have 2216 model Opteron's waiting for a stable KVM installation.  I
thought about compiling KVM for dapper, but I'm not convinced it's baked
yet, and the latest dapper misses VT extension detection by one version
(>=2.6.16.. dapper=2.6.15).

Oh, if you use LV's for you vmware guests like I do, be sure to allocate
enough disk space for the flat disk file *and* for a file equal to the
memory you allocate.  I got burned by the generation of a 2G .vmem file
equal to the 2G of RAM I gave the guest.

   Not necessarily a recommendation (because I don't know what you need or
want), but I've been using XAS Visitor Tracking
                       <http://www.xav.com/scripts/axs/>
since last year and I'm satisfied with what it tells me.

   The recommendation came from Charles at Aracnet, and he helped me to
configure it properly (the instructions are not completely accurate for all
installations).

   It is quite configurable on the fly. That is, I have a default set of
items to view, and a default time (since I last looked). But, I can select
other options using the checkboxes and that's what will be presented for
viewing.

YMMV,

Rich

Ok I have the latest VISTA BETA Ultimate which can still be installed on a 64 bit processor in 32 bit form. Unlike it's off the shelf counter part. You must install the 64 bit version of VISTA on a 64 bit computer if you buy the final version. Thats what I have been told by numerous people that can't get 32 bit versions to work. In VMWare not only can you run the 32 bit version in 32 bit mode but because VISTA, XP Home, and older versions of Windows can't fully access the true speed of a 128 bit chip or 64 bit chip and Linux can it actually runs faster, with better compatibility (once VMWare tools are installed), and with hardly any to zero freezes or crashes. I have never experienced a BSOD In VMWare with Vista. I am not a big Windows fan but since I have 50 free licenses of Vista Ultimate to go around I thought it would be nice to use them. 
I installed Vista Ultimate on my computer on it's own and XP Home before I switched completely to Linux. They did not run super fast. They took about 45 - 55 seconds to boot at their best. Under VMWare I got Vista and XP Home to boot right around 20 seconds. And in XP Home the little slider bar that goes across the screen during boot up moves very very fast which is weird.

I like server because I have never needed more. I can bridge my Server directly to the outside and have a field day with it. I really can't justify moving to Workstation for my personal needs. I have only used Server and Player but they both seem to work just fine.

Hey Keith I want to ask you and the others. How come no one got back to me when I asked about a video editor for Linux? I've been asking if anyone knows of any video editor with the abilities of Windows Movie Maker to add text at the beginning and end and during the film. No one seems to be able to help me. Also can anyone use Yahoo's Web page builder under WINE ? It seems that the JAVA plugin is not installed or can't be installed.

This is obsolete information.  While I have experimented with Server
and Workstation, I did not need either product to create the vmdk
and vmx files necessary to create fully functional vmplayer guest
instances.  I just used easyvmx.com. which generates them for 
download after filling in a web form.  There are half a dozen sites
like easyvmx.com that offer similar services, and some might be
better, but I've done about 10 guests with easyvmx and I'll stick
with what works . I don't know whether they use a vmware product to
generate these files, but I could easily imagine a simple script
could do it.

It does help to have a copy of vmware tools, which does not come
with vmplayer, but you can get the tools from one of the demo
install disks for the spendy products, or download it from some
places on the net, or get it from a friend.  It is mostly a few
megabytes of better drivers for the vmware virtual peripherals.

In my experience, the beta versions of the products are crippleware,
which is why I don't use them.  They are instrumented with all sorts
of debug stuff, and are very slow compared to VMplayer.  YMMV.

The biggest problem with vmware so far is that the installer wants
to set you up with the wrong kind of networking.  VMware offers 
three kinds of networking, NAT, host-only, and bridged.  IMHO,
the best for most applications is host-only with NAT, but the
installer has a strong bias to build bridged networks.  That is
true (so far) of Server, Workstation, and VMWare player. 

When designing a Windoze guest, it is better to use a small vmdk
virtual disk, and to keep as much of the Windoze data and programs
in the Linux file system, and let Samba share them with Windoze.
That keeps the vmdk files small.  This means setting up Samba
fairly early in the guest install process.   However, when you 
are done, many Windoze programs will install entirely in the
mounted share, which means multiple guests can share the same
programs and data.  With enough memory and CPU for the host, it is
possible to run a "Windows Server" that supports perhaps 10 or 20
Windows guests, each run over X from other physical computers 
on the LAN, all using the same copy of a program.  If the program
is old enough, the program's EULA may not forbid this kind of
multiple simultaneous access.

I use Server to construct VMWare instances and then run them with the 
runtime version.  Seems to work much smoother.  (Server acts like it is 
trying to funnel everything through a socket connection.)

If you use VMWare server to run your VMs, and you run the VMs on one
machine while connecting to them from another machine, you get two
huge wins:

1. The VMs will stay running even if you disconnect the console
client.

2. The massive overhead of rendering the X display is offloaded to the
client machine, thereby making the VM run a LOT faster.

In suse linux my free version of VMWare Server does not shut down the VMachine just because I close VMWare. It only closes it if I hit the STOP button or shutdown the OS in the VM. If I power my computer down then it also shuts off du. lol

That site sends my CPU into max overload mode and never finishes

Dell managed to create a site that could do that, but they did and I

That's because you're not running a brand new, mega-spendy dell with
the most expensive warranty they offer, which you'll need when all the
big caps on the motherboard melt!

I have the same experience from here. So, I tried it on the windoze 
laptop, where it come up just fine. The irony is that it is promoting 
Dell PCs preloaded with Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSuse, WinXP, or Vista, with 
multi-boot options.

I just tried it again here (SimplyMepis 2.6.15-23-386) dropping the

No offence but Dell cares about Dell and getting money out of people's pockets. They useto care about good customer support and helping people but now they only care about competing with other companies. You must pay $2,000 to even get a good Dell that would only cost you $600 to build. Pluss a lot of Dells are defective because of bad quality control. Now if you buy the insurance on a Dell Laptop some suggest the best thing to do is wait a year and run it over with your car and get a new one. Many of my customers call me about Dells. HP and Compaq are worse but at least Gateway builds good computers. E-machine does not and they are owned by Gateway as far as I know.

When I installed CrossOver Office about six months ago I used it to
install Internet Explorer. But I never actually launched IE until the
other day at the Clinic when I fired it up to show it to someone. So I
tried it just now. You're right, the page works in IE. But then I
decided to see if IE could handle youtube.com. Just loading the
starting page crashes it 100% of the time. I never got the opportunity
to see if it would play flash things. Guess I was wise to spend the
time I did fiddling to get flash 9 working in 64-bit Firefox.

I had a bit of time to experiment tonight and I've been thinking of
installing Epiphany just to see what it was all about. I installed it
and then went to the Dell site. The page loaded OK, but the minute I
clicked on a link Gnome went down and I was staring at a command line.
But I noticed the hard disk was running and a few moments later it
brought me back to a login screen. Still, killing gdm is not cool.

I think I'll stick to Firefox. But I'd like to figure out how to wrap
it in armor so places like that Dell site can't get to it. 

As for the Dell computers, I wouldn't want one anyway. From what I read
the newer ones fall apart. My Compaq gave me a lot of stuff for the
money, but now that I've had it for a year and a half I am not pleased
with the physical quality. I'm soon going to have to replace the
keyboard again. The hard disk connector is soldered to the underside of
the motherboard and is flaky. And I subscribe to an e-list of other
owners of Compaq R-3000 owners running Linux and there are lots and
lots of complaints about hardware falling apart. Next time I am going to
research durability as well as support for Linux.

I found a website (http://www.easyvmx.com/index.shtml) that creates the 
needed pieces (.vmx and virtual disk) to allow you to install from CD's 
into player.

After the creation process, you download, unarchive into a directory, 
and run vmplayer with the created vmx. If the cd or iso is mounted, the 
vm boots from it, and off you go.

Okay, this has nothing to do with Linux, per se, but I've received
some fortuitous assistance here from the mathematically gifted, so
I'll try again.  

I want to randomly select points with a uniform probability over the
surface of an an ellipsoid (the WGS84 ellipsoid representing the
earth, to be concrete about it).  I know how to do it for spheres, but
I have yet to find anything equally comprehensible for an ellipsoid.

Any clues?  Pointers?

Subject: [PLUG] A Strange Gnucash Error
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0702200600210.23154@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   While Gnucash has always been a fragile, easily-broken application for me,
there is no alternative that works as easily and well ... when gnucash's
working.

   The distribution upgrade to Slackware-11.0 caused the application to cease
working; upgrading to Freerock Gnome 'current' provided some of the pieces,
but I still had to re-install a couple of earlier versions of libraries and
yesterday built the last missing one (libgsf) from source. Now gnucash-2.0.5
configures, builds and installs without error.

   However, when I invoke it from the command line, the splash screen and
small working window open up, then the application hangs. The message
displayed on the command line is 'freeing NULL pointer.' On the gnucash mail
list, one developer responded that he never saw this situation either
personally or on the list.

   I'm really stymied. I've not before seen an application configure and
build without error that refused to run, especially when 'ldd gnucash-bin'
confirms there are no missing libraries.

   If anyone has a thought about what might be happening, please share it
with me. If there are alternatives, I'm open to suggestions. However, I did
try KMymoney2 the last time gnucash broke (when the distributions moved to
gtk2 and gnucash still required gtk1), and found it buggy, difficult to use
well, and downright ugly.

   All fixed. In configure I specified '-prefix /usr/lib/qt-4.2.2' and that's
where it went. Works well, so does LyX-1.5.0svn that requires it, and the
rest of the Qt applications still happily link with -3.3.7.

The files were likely split into pieces using 'split'.  They can be joined 
using 'cat'.

There might be something built into R for that -- there are quite a few 
geospatial contributed packages. My recollection is that the Earth is 
"close enough" to a sphere that your sphere technique might work anyway. :)

How do you do it for a sphere? If it's based on angles from the center, 
you might just have to adjust the distance from the center -- on a 
sphere they're constant but not on the ellipsoid.

Subject: [PLUG] Turning off cups broadcast
Message-ID: <20070220163109.GA3516@gate.kl-ic.com>


Cups has a neat feature called autodiscovery, which allows computers
to share printers by default.  This feature is turned on by default,
no doubt so things "just work" for newbies.

In my case, I don't want to advertise my printer queues from my
machines, especially my laptop while roaming.  There are some lines
in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Browsing: whether or not to broadcast and/or listen for CUPS printer
# information on the network.  Enabled by default.
#

#Browsing On

----------------------------------------------------------------------

One would think that adding the line:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Browsing Off
----------------------------------------------------------------------

... would turn off the feature, but NO.   It keeps on spewing discovery
packets on port 631 to the broadcast address.  I finally turned this off
with the line:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
BrowseInterval  0
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Perhaps this will cause something odd to fail, like the guest printers
on my vmware host-only network.   But it is annoying sometimes;  I find
the damnedest printers popping up in /var/log/cups/error_log from while
roaming, no doubt from all the other laptops on the wireless broadcasting
their printers to the world.  At Linux clinic on Sunday, somebody was
broadcasting  store_4000  and  monkeyhouse,  for example.  Perhaps I
should have sent them a ransom note that would print when they got home.

On my home network,  I have iptables cranked up to high paranoia with
logging, and I was annoyed to see the broadcast packets from the laptop.
It took a while to figure out where they were coming from.   Hence this
message, for all the rest of you wondering where the ipp (port 631)
packets are coming from.

Any reason why you're trying to install Sarge and not Etch?  I ask only
because the release of Etch is imminent and the upgrade from Sarge to
Etch can be tricky (hotplug => udev, monolithic xf86 => modular xorg,
etc.).  Etch is very stable at this point and has been for quite awhile
-- it's in feature freeze, so the only updates are fixing RC bugs.  The
Etch RC1 installer released in November [1] breaks because of key
expiry, except for the full installation CDs and DVDs, but you can use
one of the [2] daily built images if you want to do a net install.  The
last time I tried it, the graphical mode didn't work for me (it hung
somewhere, I forget where), but the text (ncurses) mode worked just
fine.  The Etch RC2 installer should be out any day now.

If you can install Etch, you could save yourself some potential upgrade
trouble.  And at this point I don't think the Debian devs are interested
in Sarge installer bugs -- all the emphasis is on getting Etch released.

I have actually installed a new OS using VMPlayer.  I built the raw HD
image with
qemu and a vmx file that was configured for a boot CD/DVD.  After running the
install from the CD/DVD.  I changed the configuration file to not look
for the iso file and
things just booted from the HD image.  I installed FC4 this way using
minimum boot iso
doing a net install and Ubuntu,Freespire, OpenSuse and Slax  with a
LiveCD install.
These worked and then I was able to run the update tools from within
and get the
updates to that image.

Let me second the suggestion that you consider Etch over Sarge. I've 
found Etch to be easier to install, esp. on laptops, and fairly up to 
date. Sarge, otoh, doesn't jibe as well with newer hardware and its 
package list, of course, is more outdated.

It may be "close enough", but I don't want people to be able to
challenge the validity of a random sample, so I am trying to go the
extra mile.

  double ra1 = drand48();

   There is a good discussion of geoid, ellipsoids, and various datums in
USGS Professional Paper 1395[1]. Pages 11-19 cover the subject
comprehensively and include many formulae.

   Useful points: in many commercial atlases it may be assumed that the Earth
is a sphere, but it is more nearly an oblate ellipsoid.

   The geoid is the name given to the shape that the Earth would assume if it
were all measured at mean sea level. Elevations and contour lines on the
Earth are reported relative to the geoid, not the ellipsoid. Latitude,
longitude, and all plane coordinate systems, on the other hand, are
determined with respect to the ellipsoid.

   The GRS 80 ellipsoid has an equatorial radius (a) of 6,378,137 meters, a
polar radius (b) of 6,356,752.3 meters, and a flattening (f) of 1/298.257.

   The WGS 72 ellipsoid as a = 6,378,135, b = 6,356,750.5, and f = 1/298.26.

   The PSU library probably has a copy.

Yeah, but my GPS device and google maps and pretty much everything

I have been sliding disks in and out of a ViPower Ultra-ATA disk
rack daily for about three years now and it has only needed
replacement once.  They do wear out;  get a spare.  Unless you 
can get something with thick gold plating on the connectors, it
will wear out.

OTOH, the big issue is a version of Linux that supports PATA hot
swap.  That was in the later 2.4.xx kernels, but it was removed
from 2.6.xx for at least a while.  It might be back in.  Perhaps
SATA is better supported.  I don't know whether the carriers for
SATA are reliable.

Hello Charles,

I've been using the InClose Mobile Dock system in one of my systems for 
2 or 3 years now with no problems. I have 3 plugin trays: 1 win98 for 
card games and 2 for trying out various distros. They are (or were) 
available at Frys - haven't checked lately. Hope this is what you had in 
mind.

USB or plug in tray?

The advantage to USB is that it is a hot plug device.  (You don't have to 
shut down to remove it.)

I have not had problems with either as long as you don't buy the extra 
cheap versions.  (Those tend to cut corners and have problems -- 
sometimes.)

The only other issue is if you reboot with a usb drive plugged in, it may 
try to boot off of that disc.  The easiest way to fix that is to configure 
the boot order with the USB device plugged in in the BIOS.  (If it is not 
plugged in, some bioses will not give you the option to change the boot 
order for USB devices.)

Hope that helps.

Hi,

Are there any reasonably priced options for hot pluggable carriers, 
SATA preferred?

Thanks,

Pacific Solutions had/has some nice heavy aluminium ones.  Don't remember

I opted to go the external USB 2.0 route and got the Seagate 160GB 7200
rpm drive. I rsync...
/home
/var/spool/mail
/etc
/var/www
/var/log/httpd
/usr/local/bin
...and the 'My Documents' folder mounted on my XP box nightly (with
rotating hard links to provide historical backups sets).

Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sdb1             147G   60G   81G  43% /media/usbdisk
//sandy/docs          299G   43G  256G  15% /windocs

The drive was recognized instantly on my RHEL (soon to be CentOS)
web/mail server (IBM x206) and formatted easily as ext3. It's been a
trouble-free solution for me.

Not PATA up to 2.6.18 kernels.  Probably USB.  Maybe SATA.  The
relevant phrase above is "I don't know", so you will have to 
research it and let us know.

On 2.4.22 (FC1), you can remove a disk with "hdparm -b 0 /dev/hdc".  
With 2.6.9 (RHEL4) and 2.6.18 (RHEL5beta) you get the error message:

   HDIO_SET_BUSSTATE failed: Operation not supported

Now you know what I do.  Please find out more and share with us.  I
am especially interested in whether SATA will hotswap properly;  SATA
disks are cheap and big, and the Wave Of The Future according to some.

I decided to take 64-bit Debian Etch for a spin. I have a spare 9 GB partition on my hard drive that currently has bare-bones Dapper on it, installed some time ago to use as a rescue installation. That's where I want to install it.

The question is what to download. The debian.org site is sparse on information regarding the myriad of images available. As far as I can tell the latest stable is debian-31r4-ia64. I wanted the DVD image, and I found it on the Open Source Lab at OSU, but there are three files there, debian-31r4-ia64-binary-1.iso and -2.iso and -3.iso, of 4.4 GB, 4.4 GB and 261 MB. Does the whole thing need 9.1 GB? Sheesh! I didn't plan on downloading the whole internet. Some advice would be helpful.

You don't want *-ia64.  You want *-amd64.  And you don't want
Debian-3.1r4-* -- that's Sarge (stable), soon to be "old stable."

You want Etch (testing), soon to be stable.  Follow the link Terry
supplied and click on the netinst CD image for amd64.

The naming convention is a bit off, but reminds me of rar archives. 
Make sure that's actually a video file and not still an archive.

But doesn't the netinst CD image require me to be connected to the
internet during the install? Surely that image is way too small to
contain the whole OS. How long will it take me to install over the
internet when my connection during the day sometimes drops to well
below 100K/s? Add the fact that the server I am downloading from may be
popular and not well supplied with bandwidth due to funding issues.

Those are the reasons I decided I wanted to download the full image,
which I can do overnight. Not only will the bandwidth be much better,
but if it takes all night I don't care. I'll be asleep, dreaming of the
joys of running Debian.

But thanks for pointing out that I want amd64. My main experience with
distros is Ubuntu, and they have just one 64-bit image that works for
either Intel or AMD 64-bit CPUs. I didn't realize other distros made a
distinction.

I tried to find the image for amd64 on the Debian site. The DVD link
was empty. The CD link had 22 CD images, about 14 GB in all. So I went
back to the OSU ftp directory and searched all over without finding
anything that looked like a CD or DVD iso image of Etch.

ia64 == itanium

amd64 == x86_64 == both amd 64-bit x86 plus intel 'em64t' 64-bit x86


I personally find the term 'amd64' very confusing, x86_64 says exactly what it 
is - x86 with 64bit extension. I wish more people would use it :)

A netinst install is not necessarily a slow thing.  I installed debian
(recently) on a VMWare guest with a netinst CD.  The entire install,
including a kernel download and compile (I never use distro kernels)
took an hour.  This included google time, as my custom kernel did not
boot until I figured out which SCSI driver to use for disk access
(BusLogic in my case).  My internet access was throttled to 800K/s
download speed; compare that to the 1M/s I get at home on my cable
modem.  I would not call this a long install by any means (of course,
I'm accustomed to gentoo; a slow install in my book is one that takes
more than 4 days).  A proper debian install is minimal anyway - you
are not downloading a whole lot.  The sources.list file you get at
install time is spartan; you won't even be able to get much cool stuff
until you replace it with your favorite sources.  You'll spend a lot
more time in apt-get later than during the install.  Plus there's the
up-to-date-ness factor.  Netinst will get you the latest packages.  If
you use an even slightly out-of-date bloater CD, how many of those
packages are you going to reinstall right out of the chute, as soon as
you do your first "apt-get dist-upgrade"?

Carlos is right -- if you were to download a dated full CD or DVD image
and install a lot of packages from it, you'd have a lot of updating to
do, which would be painful over a slow connection.  The fastest way to
go is download a netinst .iso and do a minimal installation (no xorg, no
DEs or WMs).  Downloading packages won't take very long at all, because
you're only downloading a relatively small number.  Configure, reboot,
then start adding packages as needed.  The problem with choosing
"Desktop Environment" from the installer is that it downloads both KDE
and Gnome.  That takes quite a while, even with a fast broadband, and
it's probably more than you want.

Once you've rebooted, fire up aptitude and look at the "Tasks" options.
>From there you can select *either* Gnome *or* KDE (or XFCE), if you want
a full desktop environment.  It takes much less time to download one or
the other than it does to download both.

Or, even better, issue one of:

~$ aptitude install xorg gnome-desktop-environment
~$ aptitude install xorg kde
~$ aptitude install xorg xfce4

If you don't want a DE, you can just install xorg and whatever window
manager strikes your fancy.  (You probably also want a terminal, like
xterm or aterm, not to mention a graphical web browser.  The minimal
install includes w3m.)  That will be fairly quick.  It has taken me
roughly 45 minutes to download xorg & gnome-desktop-environment at about
160kB/s.  Obviously, just downloading xorg & [flux/open/black]box or
icewm, plus a terminal, graphical web browser, and assorted apps will be
faster.

I'm not sure what you mean about the server being popular.  I just use
the generic "deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ etch main non-free
contrib" in my sources.list and I always get a fast mirror -- that is,
one that maxes out my download capacity.  Security downloads are equally
as fast.

The "amd64" image is for 64-bit Intel and AMD CPUs.  There's no separate
image for Intel.  Debian calls it "amd64" because AMD was first to
market with 64-bit.  (Debian also call the 32-bit installer "i386" even
though it runs on AMD 32-bit CPUs.)  Some distros refer to the
architecture as "x86_64," but it's all the same.  Personally, I think
the "x86_64" moniker is kind of a slight to AMD.  After all, "x86"
orginally denoted processors developed by Intel.  So AMD comes along and
develops a 64-bit extension, and Intel's terminology sticks?  Not fair.

But I don't loose any sleep over the issue.  :-)

1. There may be more AMD 64-bit machines running
64-bit Linux than Intel. Does anyone have stats
on this?

2. Why shouldn't we give credit to the creator of
the technology? Using "x86" in the name gives credit
to Intel. I surveyed my students one day about this.
In a class of about 20, _everyone_ said that Intel
created the x86_64 64-bit technology.

3. I think we need to go out of our way to make it
clear when technologies are NOT created by market
leaders, such as Intel, and monopolists, such as
Microsoft. Sort of an affirmative action program.
Far too often, people give Microsoft credit for
technologies developed by others. In another survey,
most of my students said that Microsoft created SQL.
Only one gave a different answer with a smile that
suggested that the other students were dummies and
he knew the answer; he said Oracle.

Kind of odd that they don't say what graphics hardware you get with the
desktops, and there's no configuration option for graphics.  Unless I'm
missing something.

I don't think I'd feel comfortable buying from any company that doesn't
disclose its physical address in the real world.  Who are these people?
Where are they?

You can borrow mine; I work at Intel JF3 and live by 82nd and Powell,

Intel should be given 'credit' for the 8086 architecture
at every opportunity.  After all, where would we be without

As an assembly language programmer, I hear you. Intel's
early machines were ridiculous - I was using the Motorola
and TI processors when IBM chose the Intel crap for the
PC. What a mistake. I can only imagine what would have
happened if IBM chose the TI 9900 processor instead. We
would have benefited from its fast context switching and
probably had VM technology in small computer operating
systems decades earlier.

I'm considering a desktop replacement and have just recently begun to 
consider a laptop.

I think I would like to set up a home workstation with my new fancy 
widescreen display working in tandem with a laptop display (with my laptop 
in something like a book holder) and external USB keyboard and mouse. 
Then, if necessary, I can take the whole shebang to go.

My desktop machine isn't a really heavy number cruncher (at the moment), 
so I can get away with probably the most minimal thing that will do the 
dual display (at native resolution for both the LCDs).  I don't really do 
anything more intensive than video playback and audio editting on this 
machine.

If I go the laptop route, I will probably want some REALLY cheap little 
machine that I can load with drives to be a home-based network storage 
device.

Some people have mentioned getting really cheap laptops on Ebay.  How many 
generations old are the good, cheap ones?  (i.e., where's the sweet spot 
for price/performance?)

I recently built a machine for someone and was upset to find that there 
was no SATA support for Linux and had to return the HD and get a PATA one. 
Is this common?  What about SATA external enclosures?

I'm hoping that my home fileserver will do both NFS (for my desktop 
machine) and SMB (for the XBox).  The machine I'm using for that purpose 
now is just totally unsuitable given my requirements for disk space.

have SATA drives in two machines here.

Subject: [PLUG] Learned something new ... dpkg, aptitude
Message-ID: <1172103948.30978.20.camel@localhost>

So I followed a tip I read to generate a list of all packages I have
installed:

$ dpkg --get-selections >> installed.packages.list.txt

In looking over the list, I saw several entries for packages with a
status of "deinstall" -- but it certainly didn't list everything I had
installed then uninstalled.  This was puzzling.

Then I read another tip, about using aptitude's package tree limit with
the search pattern ~c.  This will show you all the packages for which
you have configuration files hanging around, even though the package is
no longer installed.

And whaddya know, it matches the entries in my installed packages list
that show a status of "deinstall."

Now I realize what these are:  they are packages that aptitude removed
in the course of upgrades, stuff like gstreamer0.8-flac.  Normally, when
I uninstall something I use the "purge" option, which removes
configuration files, but when aptitude removes something in the course
of an upgrade, it leaves the configs.

One small step on the road leading out of Newbieville.  :-)

Your right about the thinkpads. Of course dells are cheaper. They always work with Linux but don't last as long for some reason. New Acers are not Linux friendly but work with Fedora Core 6 and SUSE 10.2 if you like those distros. It also works with a variety of the most common Linux distros. Ubuntu does not like Acers.

Oh, no.  This was a PARTICULAR SATA controller that is not yet supported.

I understand that many are.  So I want to make sure that what I get is.

I have no idea how well they do or don't work (should arrive on Friday), 
but it looks promising, and at $30 its worth a shot to get my hands on a 
500GB+ hot-swap setup for pretty darn cheaply.

Laptops with dual-VGA and docking stations are indeed lovely things.
Just be careful what video chipset the lappie uses so you can make sure
you get dual-head support in X.

NAS appliances are quite inexpensive these days.

That depends entirely on what you want.  Make a wishlist, set a budget,
buy carefully.  You can get brand-new lappies for $500-$1000, and there
may still be some good pre-Vista ones floating around at bargain prices.
If you want a little cheaper, you can get used IBM T-series lapdogs from
local retailers for $300-$600.

My own wishlist is: 
* Built-in Mini-PCI WiFi (replace w/a Senao?)
* Dualhead supported under X
* Docking station
* Batteries and power supplies commonly available
* No bigger than 10"x12"x1.5"
* TrackPoint
* Kernel VM support (Intel VT or AMD SVM)
* 512+ MB RAM

Currently, I'm looking at ~$1,200 for most of what I want.  Since I have
an adequate laptop right now, my money has more important things to do,
mostly involving motorcycles and/or financial stability.

Newer Linux distros have good native SATA support.  If your distro
doesn't support your motherboard's SATA controller, you can usually go
into BIOS setup and configure the controller to operate in "compatible"
mode.  This makes the SATA controller look like a PATA controller.

Huh.  Can you elaborate on that?  You could get a TeraStation, NSLU2 or
something.  Or just buy a $25 Linux box at FreeGeek and stuff drives in.

   A discussion with a very helpful young woman at Easy Software provided me
with the solution to the non-duplex printing. It required an upgrade (free,

   Also, in case anyone else uses the PrintPro PPD drivers, they work only
with CUPS-1.1.x. While the cups developers rush forward (they're up to
-1.2.28 now), the PrintPro developers are lagging behind.

   Anyway, it woiks now and I'm happy to drop this off the fixit list.

   Printers. The HP LaserJet 5 (which is well supported by gutenprint and
foomatic, too) and the HP Professional Series 2500C which is supported for
color and 600 dpi _only_ by the PrintPro drivers. That's why I bought them
in the first place.

Well you may want to consider the HPLIP project for HP printers.

http://hplip.sourceforge.net/

It's free, and developed by HP. (I'm biased thought I work on the team) :)

All the best,

   Thanks, Aaron. I'll save this information.

   Since I first bought the PrintPro license about 1999 it's worked great --
until the kernel version upgrade. Since they're providing free upgrades that
work I will stick with them.

   Hope the firmware upgrades for the 2500C can now be installed from linux.
For the longest time one had to have a winduhs box to do this, and running
from within VMware did not work. Boise tech support told me that users of
HP-UX boxes couldn't upgrade the printer's firmware, either.

I've been reading this thread because I have a similar problem. I
haven't said anything because I have no solution.

I have a Laserjet 5SiMx (identical to the one at Free Geek) and a
Laserjet 8000DN (physically the same printer, but HP changed all the
electronics). Both have duplexers. Duplexing always worked fine with
both until after the upgrade from Dapper to Edgy. Now I can still
duplex to the 8000DN, but the 5SiMx is broken. I've tried everything
available, PostScript, gutenprint, CUPS, command line with lp and lpr,
HPLIP, but no joy. Duplexing is set on the printer control panel as the
default and it is also set as the default in CUPS. And I select it in
the application print dialog box as well. But it still prints single
sided.

So if you work on the HPLIP team and know anything about this, please
share!

Happy Thursday Pluggers!
Its about time to go out and get a printer again. I'd really like to get an
All-In-One but I don't want to make the same mistake I did last time
(Lexmark blah) so does anyone have suggestions with kit that's been tested
in the field and works well?

Thanks,

Hmm. My old Lexmark Optra worked great with Linux. 

I just bought a Brother 7820N, and everything works fine. Brother
provides RPMs and debs for the drivers. It's fast as hell too. The print
quality for graphics isn't as nice as for text, but it works for me.

I just tested a LaserJet 5SiM and the duplex worked correctly.

Although in cups I changed:

Duplex Unit (for 2-Sided Printing): to Installed

and

2-Sided Printing: to Short Edge Binding.

I printed from openoffice with no problems. What application are you
printing from?

Thanks Aaron I was planning on HP anyways ;-)

Kurt- I had an X5150 and it would refuse to operate even though there were
some supposed "linux" drivers supplied from lexmark when downloaded turned
out to be Macintosh Disk Images .. yea so awesome ... so no more lexmark for
me :-)

   Does it also work with Long Edge Binding? That's the way we're used to
seeing pages.

Hey! It's working now!

I have no idea why. I spent hours the other day trying to get it to
print duplexed from several different apps, and nothing worked. I
didn't make any changes just now either.

<rant mode: On>
Part of the problem (in Windows also) is that there are three places to
change settings: 

- the printer's control panel
- CUPS properties for the printer
- the application print dialog box

And most applications offer a button to change the options for the
printer as well. This button should change the options temporarily in
CUPS, but it does not open the CUPS properties window. So God only
knows what that button really changes.

In theory, settings in the printer's control panel should be overridden
by the settings in CUPS, and settings in CUPS should be overridable in
the application print dialog box. In reality, that theory is regularly
ignored and violated by just about every application. And often the
same option is available in different places in the application print
dialog box, and one setting counters the other. Either that or the
option just doesn't work.

For example, in the OpenOffice.org main print dialog box there is a
Properties button next to the printer drop-down box. With the Laserjet
5SiMx PostScript printer selected, when you click on the Properties
button you get a dialog box which has an option for Paper Tray, which
is set to 3 for my Laserjet 5SiMx. The main dialog box also has a
button labeled Options, which pops up a different dialog box that has a
checkbox for Paper Tray from Printer Settings. Meantime, I always have
the printer's control panel set to use whatever paper tray has paper in
it (Automatic setting in the printer control panel). 

So if I check the Paper Tray from Printer Settings from the printer
Options dialog box it will always try to pull from the manual feed
tray, which is always empty because I never use it, thus the print job
hangs until I walk over and hit the Select button to make it pull
from another tray. The Paper Tray option on the other printer
Properties popup window says Tray 3. I cannot change it to Automatic
because that option is not listed. I can change it to 1, 2, 3 or 4. But
whatever I set it to doesn't matter. As soon as I close that popup
window and reopen it the setting is back to Tray 3.

It has often been repeated that printing is one of the weak parts of
Linux, and its true. What we need is for apps to be forced to strict
compliance with CUPS. No fair trying to go around CUPS and change
printer settings directly. And where CUPS has an option for a printer
the application print dialog box should display the same option using
the same terminology and with the same options. At least that way if
there is a problem with a printer the CUPS people can fix it once and
it will be fixed for everything. 
<rant mode: Off> ... Well, until this computer does something else to
piss me off. :)

to do to get it working was to download the right ppd file from hp.

My first all-in-one was a Lexmark. I was never able to get it to work 
with Linux.
I am very happy with my HP PSC2510. Epson is also one of the more linux

great suggestion Aaron!  That page combined with an online search from Favored
Store (for something like this, Best Buy in my case) and within 10 minutes one
can figure out the price/feature balance that works.

My wife has been asking for one of these.

Subject: [PLUG] VM Ware Fedora Core 6 problems
Message-ID: <e2aeccd60702231201la45ebc1keca15fe65948b1f8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Pluggers,
I started a thread about virtualization awhile back and got some great
information. After attempting to install VM Ware server on my Fedora Core 6
installation I keep running into a problem that Google has yet to solve for
me. I can install the rpm that VM Ware provides just fine. However when I
try and run vmware-config.pl it is unable to find my kernel headers which
are indeed installed (in my case in /usr/src/kernels/<kernel-ver> when I
point to that directory the config tool spews back that the header files are
not from my running kernel yet they are or at least they should be according
to the documentation I've read.

I have the following packages installed.

kernel-2.6.19-1.2895.fc6-i686
kernel-devel-2.6.19-1.2895.fc6-i686
kernel-headers-2.6.19-1.2895.fc6-i686

I have tried updating to the latest kernel from the update repo with no
success (same error message).

The one forum I found this specific issue on listed the problem as having to
do with the arch conflicting between the header/devel packages and the
kernel package but I've verified repeatedly that they match.


Anyone have any pointers/debugging tips?

Thanks,
Drew-

Infoworld -- Virtualization overview article a couple of days ago.

Neil McAllister said, "I came away from InfoWorld's Virtualization Executive
Forum last week with two conclusions. First, server virtualization is
definitely a big deal. This time last year, customers and ISVs still seemed
to be struggling to come to terms with this new approach to deploying and
managing servers; today it's full speed ahead. And, second, nowhere is
virtualization hotter than in the Linux market..."

I set up one of these recently.

It feels like a quality part, and works fine. I'm not using it for
backup disks, though.

what does uname -r say on your box?  Are you booting(running) into an

Subject: [PLUG] PKG_CONFIG_PATH
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0702231440250.12684@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   libgnomecups-1.0.so.1.0.0 is in /usr/local/lib/. When I try to configure
libgnomeprint it aborts with this message:

checking for CUPS libraries version >= 1.1.20... Found version 1.1.23
checking for LIBGNOMECUPS... configure: error: Package requirements
(libgnomecups-1.0 >= 0.2.0) were not met.
Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

Alternatively you may set the LIBGNOMECUPS_CFLAGS and LIBGNOMECUPS_LIBS
environment variables
to avoid the need to call pkg-config.  See the pkg-config man page for
more details.

   So, I created /usr/local/pkgconfig/libgnomecups-1.0.pc and adjusted the
contents to suit.

   Then I ran 'export
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH'
before running './config --prefix=/usr' but I still get the error.

   The pkg-config man page probably has the answer, but I don't know what I'm
looking for in there. Guidance from more experienced folks would be much
appreciated.

I had a couple off-list suggestions which didn't work =( Here's the error

The directory of kernel headers (version @@VMWARE@@ UTS_RELEASE) does not
match
your running kernel (version 2.6.19-1.2895.fc6).  Even if the module were to

compile successfully, it would not load into the running kernel

the kernel, kernel-devel and kernel-headers packages match the running
kernel so I'm at a loss here. I'm almost wondering if its because its a dual
core box? It shows SMP in uname -a but that shouldn't matter I wouldn't
think. Guess its time to download the sources and do my own kernel compile
heh.

   Don't know if it's applicable, Drew, but when I upgrade the kernel on my
box VMware Workstation needs to have its vmware-config.pl script run.

Subject: [PLUG] CD/DVD Burning and Cataloging
Message-ID: <200702241244.59736.aaron@madebyai.com>

Hi all,

I have a tree on a filesystem I want to prune, but I'd like to save it to DVD 
or CD recordable media before doing so in case I need it in the future. I 
would then like to have a printed listing of files for "offline searching."

What I'd like to accomplish is burning a number of discs labelled 1-N and then 
have a printable (plaintext is fine) tree of which files are on which disc. 
Hopefully whatever software can do this would gracefully handle stuffing as 
many files as possible on each disc so I don't have to do this myself. I've 
tried, it's a PITA and I'm talking about 700+GB.

I gave google the usual chance but I may not know how to describe what I'm 
trying to find. Various permutations of linux burning and cataloging returned 
little of relevance.

Does anyone know of software like this or have any similar suggestions I might 
try?

Congratulations, Randal! One good thing came out of that for me- I was a 
relative Linux noob back then, and that particular escapade taught me that 
geek gossip is no better than normal people gossip, and getting the facts 
isn't as easy as it could be, and there are a lot of folks who don't really 
want to be annoyed by facts in any case because it interferes with expressing 
and vigorously defending opinions.

Have a great party! I shall hoist a toast in your honor.

I'm not sure I understand exactly what you're after, but did you check
[1] GTKtalog?

It won't auto-fill the discs for you, you'll have to find something else
for that.  But it will catalog every file on your discs in directory
tree fashion and provide a mechanism for browsing/searching through the
discs quickly.  Also has a less robust ncurses option, freeing you from
always needing X and GTK+.

I'm not sure if you can print directly from GTKtalog, but:

[2] "You can display file information with GTKtalog internal viewer or
with any other viewer you choose (mozilla, xemacs ..)."

So you can display it through something else that you can print from.

Thanks for the suggetion, GTKtalog looks like it might produce the catalog I 
need after the discs are burned.

The part I see as more important is something which can, given a media size 
(650MB, 700MB, 4.7GB, etc.) split the tree of files up so it can be burned 
onto individual discs. I don't care if it creates ISOs, makes a bunch of 
numbered directories with a subset of the files in them, or even burns 
directly.

I just hit this after rebooting into a 2.6.19 kernel in Friday, but it
sounds like you've find the solution.  Here are a couple of general
pointers:

 o VMWare has self-support forums which are usually quite helpful.
 o A VMWare employee name Petr releases an unofficial set of patches
that usually handle this kind of thing.  His
'vmware-any-any-updateXXX.tar.gz' can be found here:

I have an HP OfficeJet 6210 that works well for me.  It's not a
heavy-duty printer (I have ones at work if I need that), but it works
well with CUPS/Sane/etc.

Why the hell is that?  We've finally gotten a sound subsystem that
people seem to be mostly happy with--ALSA--but mixing is still a total
mess.  My motherboard only has 3 ports--line in, line out and microphone
in (I think), so I'm not sure what all several dozen sliders are for.
(Well, that's the CD audio port too.)  While I know roughly what PCM is,
I don't understand why there is a separate slider for it, in addition to
"master" and "headphone."  The curses-based ALSA mixer is nearly
unusable in its unfriendliness and the graphical one actually hung
several times when I tried to use it (not to mention that it behaves
strangely at times, like the fact that the channels are unlocked by
default, instead of locked).  xfce4-mixer isn't much better;
gnome-volume-control kinda works.  Sometimes they even seem to control
different things, too.  I had to use Skype a few weeks ago for a
conference call and it took me *forever* to figure out how to turn up
the microphone input levels so it would actually record.  I'm still
kinda vague about what I actually did to change it.

Amen. It's more a documentation problem than anything else. I don't
know what PCM means either. That is, I remember reading a wiki or
something about it once and I know I read what it stands for, but I
have since forgotten. Of course, if I was a toon kiddie I'm sure I
would remember. But all I want is something with an on-off switch and a
volume knob. And if the controls are necessary, then there should be
a Help button right on the dialog box that says more than "to use the
PCM sliders, drag them up and down with the mouse." It should explain
what PCM stands for, what it does, and why I should care.

Any of these sound promising?:

(1)  http://cdbkup.sourceforge.net/ 

CDBKUP is a professional-grade open-source package for backing up
filesystems onto CD-Rs or CD-RWs. 
Features
      * Supports full or incremental backups.
      * Results are stored as GNU tarballs on ISO 9660 filesystems.
      * Excellent support for multi-session CDs.
      * Large backups can be split between multiple CDs.
      * Supports gzip, bzip2 or no compression.

Backup is a shell script that makes use of standard unix utilities such
as find, sed, and cpio, plus a small file-splitter called fsplit (#)
(source and Linux x86 executable included) to create a cpio backup
archive of your system. The archive is created on your hard drive in the
form of a series of files which can then be burned onto separate CDs or
DVDs.

The default fragment size is still currently set to around 640 Mb so
they can fit onto normal CDs, but as of version 4.20, this can be
changed via "-s " to suit common DVDs (eg: -s 4.7). The chunk files are
automatically named by backup by appending 000, 001 etc onto a
date-derived file name base.

Introduction 
I wanted to backup my entire Linux system. I wanted to do it by making
direct copies of the files (no archiving or compression), so if I just
wanted to look at one of the files on one of the CDs, I could. This also
makes it very easy to restore from backups. Backing up my entire Linux
system takes more than one CD, so I was running the du command on a
bunch of directories to see what would fit on which CD. This was very
tedious and time consuming, so I wrote multicd to do this work for me.


Description 
multicd has a fairly large number of options. It can be configured to
run in a variety of ways. Here are some of the more interesting
features:

multicd can run in an interactive or non-interactive mode.

      * Interactive mode assumes that you will be burning more than one
        disc. You tell multicd which files to backup, and it will prompt
        you to insert a disc each time it is ready to burn a new one.
      * Non-interactive mode copies the files to an image file, and then
        burns just a single CD. It assumes you have left a CD in your
        burner. This is useful if you want to call multicd from a script
        or a cron job.

Boy, it does my newbie heart good to hear you experienced chaps complaining 
about the mixer.  I am used to Linux things being obscure, so at least in this 
one instance I am not alone.

It would help if the sound card documentation had hardware descriptions in the 
form of a block diagram, with nomenclature which matched the mixer.

kmix?

I know, it sucks because it starts with a k rather than being named like 
a common lisp library function, right?

My comment applies to kmix. Do you have a way to change it from having 23 
universal output sliders and 10 input sliders and 7 switches?  My experience is 
that only 3 or 4 have any effect with my card (audigy 2 value). Do you have a 
way to get the mixer panel to fit within the width of the screen?

I've recommended System76 to clients, and have been fairly happy with
them.  We ordered 60 Pangolin laptops and a few needed to have parts
reseated due to shipping.  They are made by Asus, and they look like the
Echo from Shafetech.

I tend to recommend Penguin Computing or IBM for servers.  Though I'm
having issues installing Dapper or Etch on a Penguin Computing Altus
1600 with a hardware SAS RAID controller.  Pre-installed FC6 seems to
boot fine though.

      Although many organizations have disaster recovery plans,
      an actual disaster can present a number of unexpected problems.
      From transportation difficulties to incorrect public information

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0702280615310.8243@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Pine comes up in read-only mode. It says there's another process that has
a lock on it. But, 'ps ax | grep pine' reveals only a single process, and no
one other than my one instance uses pine. This started only last evening.

   What might be the cause of this? More importantly, how do I get normal
operations back?

   Let me clarify this a bit: it's only my inbox that's READONLY. The other
files are just fine.

First, close pine and then see if any other processes have opened your 
mail spool:

    sudo lsof | grep /var/spool/mail

You may need to kill an errant process to regain a lock on your inbox.

If that turns up nada, look for /var/spool/mail/rshepard.lock or any 
file that looks and/or smells like a lock file -- and delete it.

NB: These examples assume your inbox is located in /var/spool/mail; 
adjust as necessary.

Paul,

   Ran lsof as root. Nothing showed up and the cursor sat there until I
pressed ctrl-c.

> You may need to kill an errant process to regain a lock on your inbox.

   That's what puzzles me. I could not see anything in the process list for
pine.

   The only files in /var/spool/mail are those of users. No lock files or
anything else that looks different.

   What I do see when I look at /var/spool/mail/rshepard is this header:

has been around for almost 10 years now, I wonder what might have generated
a new header like this, and how it became read only.

   Is there a way to regenerate the file correctly?

   Thanks for the prompt reply -- the first round is on me.

Subject: [PLUG] Another Post-Reboot Issue: PostgreSQL
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0702280706520.11941@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   In addition to the pine inbox issue, I've one with postgresql.

   The postmaster is running:

9959 pts/1    S      0:00 /usr/bin/postmaster -D /var/lib/pgsql/data

and the socket is present:

srwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 2007-02-28 05:20 /tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432=

   But I cannot connect to the database for SQL-Ledger nor from the command
line:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ psql
psql: could not connect to server: Connection refused
         Is the server running locally and accepting
         connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432"?

   The server is running locally. How can I test whether it's accepting
connections on the socket?

Thanks,

Rich

Umm, that sounds bad to me. I've never had lsof not return cleanly, at 
least not that I can remember. Even on a fairly loaded system here at 
work lsof takes less than 1.5 seconds to complete.

Are you sure that lsof isn't exiting without sending SIGINT?

Can you check to see if your hard drive is getting full. Something's 
not right here.

I wasn't expecting pine to be in the process table; I was thinking 
more along the lines of a stubborn MTA (you use postfix, right?) or 
perhaps POP/IMAP process.

Status: RO is pretty standard for the 'FOLDER INTERNAL DATA' message; 
I wouldn't worry about it.

Paul,

   I, too, have not seen it just sit there.

   No. There's a \n and then nothing.

   Plenty of room. /var is 71% used, but has 300M available.

   I've stopped and restarted postfix. I looked for a lock in /var/spool/mail
as well as for something running that's visible from the process list.

   OK.

   Should I copy the messages I want to save from INBOX to another file,
delete /var/spool/postfix/rshepard (with postfix not running), then 'touch'
the file and restart postfix?

   All other files are fine. It's only my inbox that's locked. Very puzzling.

Use lsof and see if something has locked your mail spool.

Subject: [PLUG] postfix content_filter AFTER recipient_restrictions?
Message-ID: <20070228192929.GI11914@merlot.com>

I recently added amavis to my postfix configuration, and followed some
'filter ALL mail' instructions simply because I had a deadline and they
were handy.

Now I see that I really want to have more control over where in the
list of restrictions the content_filter falls. E.g. I want to check my
sender exceptions and rfc822 stuff, THEN apply the content_filter, then
check the rest of my restrictions.

Is this possible? Hints will be greatly appreciated...

Thanks.

Kurt,

   Yes. The order in which the restrictions are listed are the order in which
they are checked. And, that makes a _very_ big difference.

   When I tried greylisting, I had the call to the greylist tool high in the
check list. _Every_ message was sent off. Then I moved it to the very end,
and only those that made it past all the other checks were greylisted. (Then
I removed it because it was more of a bother than a help. :-) )

   The general idea, IIRC, is to do all your acceptances first (e.g.,
permit_mynetworks), then apply the other filters. I also learned recently
that there are advantages of separating check_client_restrictions prior to
check_sender_restrictions. Even without the greylisting, I'm back down to
perhaps 4 spam per day that plop into my INBOX.

   My UCE filters are these; I don't use avavis, but you know where to insert
it in the queue:

smtpd_client_restrictions =
         check_client_access hash:/etc/postfix/internal_network,
         permit_mynetworks,
         #check_sender_access hash:/etc/postfix/sender_no_greylist,
         check_client_access hash:/etc/postfix/badaddr,
         reject_rbl_client zen.spamhaus.org,
         reject_rbl_client bl.spamcop.net,
         reject_rbl_client list.dsbl.org,
         reject_rhsbl_sender dsn.rfc-ignorant.org,
         reject_unknown_reverse_client_hostname,
         check_sender_mx_access cidr:/etc/postfix/bogus_mx,
         check_sender_access hash:/etc/postfix/rhsbl_sender_exceptions,
         check_sender_access hash:/etc/postfix/common_spam_senderdomains,
         check_sender_access hash:/etc/postfix/badaddr,
         permit

smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
         permit_mynetworks,
         reject_unauth_destination,
         check_recipient_access hash:/etc/postfix/roleaccount_exceptions,
         check_recipient_access hash:/etc/postfix/recipients,
         check_helo_access pcre:/etc/postfix/helo_checks,
         reject_non_fqdn_recipient,
         reject_non_fqdn_sender,
         reject_unknown_sender_domain,
         reject_non_fqdn_hostname,
         reject_invalid_hostname,
         permit

smtp_data_restrictions =
         reject_multi_recipient_bounce

HTH,

Can content_filter be part of a X_restrictions line? I have not seen
any example of that. It's not like greylisting, which is a policy filter
that returns a status; it is a filter that can alter the content.

Thanks.

In case you don't read LWN.

Securing Linux by breaking it with Damn Vulnerable Linux

Damn Vulnerable Linux (DVL) is everything a good Linux distribution isn't. Its
developers have spent hours stuffing it with broken, ill-configured, outdated, and
exploitable software that makes it vulnerable to attacks. DVL isn't built to run
on your desktop -- it's a learning tool for security students.


DVL is a live CD available as a 150MB ISO. It's based on the popular mini-Linux
distribution Damn Small Linux (DSL), not only for its minimal size, but also for
the fact that DSL uses a 2.4 kernel, which makes it easier to offer vulnerable
elements that might not work under the 2.6 kernel. It contains older, easily
breakable versions of Apache, MySQL, PHP, and FTP and SSH daemons, as well as
several tools available to help you compile, debug, and break applications running
on these services, including GCC, GDB, NASM, strace, ELF Shell, DDD, LDasm, LIDa,
and more.

   And here I thought that the punch line was a reference to various flavors
of Windows.

It's a classroom example to use while teaching.

Did your math professors start you off on current mathematical theory and research?
No, there was a progression that worked it's way through geometery, algebra,
calculus and onward.

   Actually, Michael, when I learned math the concept of zero was quite new
and we used sticks on clay tablets for notepaper. Couldn't count past 20 (or
21) unless all students were lined up in a single row.

That seems kinda stupid to me, I would imagine the amount of relevant knowledge to be gained by people breaking into worn aged software is much smaller than the insight that would be gained by a 2.6 kernel with lots of software not too old running on it.

It's like saying there's tons to be gained by watching people hack windows 95. Your also much more likely to get a "false" positive (script kiddy, automatic scanning script, botnet script, whatever) with something thats such old news.

Actually there is a lot to be gained.  Understanding an exploit anh ow it 
works is not as easy as some people seem to believe.  Being able to write 
a heap exploit, getting it to work on a known piece of code, and then 
understanding why it worked is quite valuable.  You can then extend that 
knowledge to something that has not been rooted.

Not everything is a buffer overflow.

Learning from the mistakes of the past is a good thing.

                What went wrong with my disaster recovery plan

                                      by

                                 Brian Martin
                         <Brian at martinconsulting.com>


      Although many organizations have disaster recovery plans,
      an actual disaster can present a number of unexpected problems.
      From transportation difficulties to incorrect public information
      to clueless vendors, Brian Martin will share the realities he
      experienced during an actual disaster in the aftermath of the
      1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
      This non-technical presentation will be suitable to anyone
      involved in or even thinking about disaster recovery.

      *******************************************************************

          Agenda:

              7:00 - 7:30  Business
                   We will discuss the status of our ongoing projects

Subject: [PLUG] Command line to get list of all hardware/drivers?
Message-ID: <20070228201012.d425eee7.johnxj@comcast.net>

Problem: There is something in this computer that is boogering up Edgy
amd64 so that certain features of OpenOffice.org are not working. Only
OOo is affected. I have tried the live/install CD for Edgy amd64 and
OOo still has exactly the same problems. I also tried the 32-bit Edgy
live/install CD and the problems went away. It has to be a hardware
conflict of some sort in 64-bit Edgy.

I have e-mail addresses for half a dozen other Edgy amd64 users who
have exactly the same set of problems. (We are rare.) I want to query
them and ask them to run a command that will generate a list of all
their hardware. I will also ask some Edgy amd64 users who do not have
the problem to do the same. Then I will compare the lists to see what
the commonalities are.

It doesn't have to be done at the command line, but I'm guessing that
would be simpler, faster and easier. I've looked at command line
documentation online for the past hour and have not found what I need.
But in Linux the command line is suppoed to be able to make you live
longer, be more attractive and get you more sex. Surely what I need is
a piece of cake. Can someone suggest something?

lspci, lsusb, lsscsi, lsmod (the last one is especially meaningful on
a distro kernel with lots of kernel features compiled as modules).

there's a debian package called `discover` that collects pci, usb, pcmcia device 
ID's and appropriate drivers (mostly kernel modules, but also x.org driver name).

should be available through apt I think. `discover` and `discover-data`

Cheers,

I found it in Synaptic, where the current version seems to be discover
1 and discover1-data. Both were already installed. I tried running it
from the command line but it didn't work:

jjj at Devil5:~$ discover
open_sock(): Operation not permitted
jjj at Devil5:~$ sudo discover
Password:
jjj at Devil5:~$ sudo discover1
sudo: discover1: command not found
jjj at Devil5:~$ sudo discover
jjj at Devil5:~$ 

I googled and discovered that it doesn't really "work." It is used to
detect hardware during bootup. So it doesn't create a report or
anything I could put into a text document.
