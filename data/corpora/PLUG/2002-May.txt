Subject: [PLUG] Keyboard query
Message-ID: <1020236856.25302.242.camel@Dustpuppy>

Hi all,

  I've gotten a query from a friend of mine that I'm just not sure how
to address.  The initial problem was that his backspace key wasn't
deleting the character to the left of the cursor until after he logged
in - if he mis-typed his login name, he was unable to correct it (the
"famous" ^H problem).  I was pretty sure I recognized that, & pointed
him to this page 

  http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard.html

which helped, but  then he replied saying that his break key wasn't
working the way that he'd grown to expect when using WinDoze.  His
distro is RH, but I'm not certain of the version - probably 7.x (I'd
know more, but he's about 1500 miles away).

In any case, his description of the problem is below.  I've been
looking in the "Keyboard and Console HOWTO" (as well as the man pages
for toe, tic, terminfo & tset) but I'm now getting a bit sleepy & I've
not yet seen it...  Will tackle it again in the morning...

Many thanks for any enlightenment...

T.

Well, a few things led me to keep it simmering on the to-do list: 

  a) I was honestly interested in the answer to your question (I hate
     "industry standards" that you can't look up easily);

  b) the first thing I came across when I went to look, those many
     months ago, was the "jargon file" answer that I posted before;

  c) I was afraid that my initial joking reply might have squelched a
     legitimate reply someone else might have offered and I felt bad
     about that; and

  d) my wife is a reference librarian who happened to have a slow day
     recently and dug it up for me.

  BINGO! We have a winner!

  Postfix would not install because the hostname was 'salmo' and the MTA
insisted on a FQDN. I read the hostname man page and figured out how to
change it so I could install postfix (a step not mentioned in either the FAQ
or the HOWTO). I completely forgot about this.

  This just goes to show how little I *really* understand about X. I'll be
at tomorrow's meeting to try to dent that ignorance a bit more.

Many thanks for the insight, Paul,

Rich

  I've searched the postfix web site and the docs I can find without seeing
an answer to this question: how can I specify either a specific IP address
or a block of IP addresses to be rejected by postfix? The corollary is where
to put them: header_checks?

The Apache documentation, available in your source tarball and online, 
includes two docs worth reading:

* Security Tips for Server Configuration
  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/security_tips.html

* Authentication, Authorization, and Access Control
  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/howto/auth.html

What's your configuration of your network in terms of laptop versus the DHCP
server? In order to get your laptop's hostname assigned, you'll probably
need your laptop's MAC address and you'll need to add that to the
configuration files on the DHCP server. Someone else on the list may be able
to help you with the specifics of setting up the files for.

Getting the default domain name set is pretty trivial. I think there's a
config file in /etc/ for it. Others on the list can help out here -- it's
been many moons since I set this up.

This is only a slightly better solution:

1.  Tell the OS to shut down.
2.  Wait for the hard drive to stop writing and the OS to be finished
with whatever shutdown stuff it does.
3.  Hold the power button down for a few seconds (could be as long as 10
seconds) until the system powers off and the keyboard lights go out.

OR you might try:

1.  Tell the OS to restart.
2.  When you get the video card splash screen or at the start of the
e-machine splash screen when it is doing the memory test, press the
power button.

:( rebooted my home server yesterday, will only boot to "LI". read the

I am confused.
I want to learn how to fix it with out re-installing, but i want my system 
back up now.

any suggestions on what files to look at and or what i should run?
i tried running lilo from the /etc/.
I compared my lilo.conf with my other systems lilo.conf it looked ok.

I will post this and read some more. any web-link suggestions?

Exactly the same way you do it in sendmail. :)

Add the IP with REJECT after it in the access database.

For instance, I have the following in my /etc/postfix/access file:

4.19.93.150                     REJECT
emarkethost.net                 REJECT
kjmqrrr.com                     REJECT
networkpride.net                REJECT
lakecity.cc.fl.us               REJECT
150.176.96.2                    550 We don't accept mail infected with SirCam

(Among others)

Once you have the entries you want in there, execute the command postmap 
/etc/postfix/access to make the db file.

The man page for the access file is here: http://www.postfix.org/access.5.html

Subject: [PLUG] Have your friends hack into your Windows XP computer!
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20020501093441.01f174e8@localhost>

I was just doing some research for my boss on Windows XP, and found this in 
"Tips and Tricks" on the MS website:

Provide Personal Support It never fails: when friends, co-workers, or 
family members discover that you're a Windows expert, you get pressed into 
service as an unpaid support technician. If the party asking for help is 
running any edition of Windows XP and has an active Internet connection, 
your job is much easier. Have the other person send you a Remote Assistance 
request; when you accept the request, you connect directly to their 
computer and can edit Registry settings, fix file associations, set System 
options, and perform just about any other troubleshooting or repair task, 
just as if you were sitting at the other person's desk.


SO, you can ask your friends to let you in, and then you have full control! 
What fun!

  Thanks, Paul.

  I see, too, that there are packages for apache-1.3.x but tarballs for
httpd-2.0.35. I've downloaded a couple of tarballs for the latter (one's
supposed to be specific to RH 7.2 so I probably won't use it).

  Well, here's more for my to-do list. :-)

Yes, I've seen this 'feature' on my wife's laptop with XP.  The only reason 
I'd enable it is to mess with her from my desktop. >:D  I'm still trying to 
convince her to use 2k instead (XP is such a DOG) but she likes it because 
it's *pretty*.

One thing I DID notice about XP just the other night is that they added 
virtual desktops!  Something that *nix/X11 has been doing since, what...the 
mid-80's?  Bleeding-edge technology, folks!

Hello linux folkz,
I'm apologize for a such stupid question, but my dept. manager didn't
approve additional spendings for firewall hardware even el-cheapo
pentium PC.
He insists to run firewall on the same box with Web, DB, NFS and Mail
servers to cut our department costs.
So,I need to show him justification why it's dangerouse practice.
His position on this issue is that using iptables you can separate
Internet NIC from Intranet NIC, setup NAT and masquerading and put all
unnessesary ports on Internet interface in stealth mode.
All nessesary services for internal network will be provided on the
Intranet NIC separately from Internet NIC.
If a hacker breaks through the firewall into DMZ (Web, DB, Mail)
server will become volnureable in any way. 
So he doesn't see a point to separate firewall from other servers.

Could somebody please provide an explanation about this issue or point
to the source of information, so I can show it to my staborn manager.
Thank you very much in advance.

Alex

If a hacker breaks into the firewall, you're vulnerable from the very second 
he gets access.

If you have a second box that runs the services, he at the very *least* has to 
crack that box as well.  This will give you some time - and with the right 
intrusion detection software running on the firewall, that little bit of time 
might save your data AND your ass.

To be fair, I'll admit that I have my home systems setup the way your manager 
suggests.  A lot of my data is stored on my firewall - but this was mainly 
because at tht time I set it up, I didn't HAVE another box to use.  I do now, 
but I'm loathe to tear it all down since it works so wonderfully.  :)

However, a cheap, yet reliable pentium or even 486 box for a firewall 
shouldn't put you back any more than $100, and that's if you eBay it.

But, it's your data...

Occasionally I do that, but for the most part, it's not an option.  We still 
have to receive phone calls, and as my workstation is upstairs, I cannot hear 
the modem dial from the floor below.

Anyway, it was just something fun that I did, and I thought it would be nice 
to share with the rest of the PLUGger's.

  In my floppyfw's firewall.ini, I re-ordered some protocol rules so all the
accepts came before the denys. After rebooting the box, I saw that the rules
were listed by protocol (TCP or UDP), the origin (generally 'anywhere'), the
destination ('salmo.appl-ecosys.com') and the action (ACCEPT or DENY).

  The listed hostname for ssh (port 22) and postfix (port 25) are fine. But,
I want to install apache on a different host here ('caddis' rather than
'salmo'). I grepped all the files in the floppyfw without finding a
reference to 'salmo' that I could change to 'caddis'.

  Will someone please explain to me from where floppyfw gets that hostname
as a destination? I want the hppt server on another box because it has much
more hard drive space and is very lightly used. Besides, it's actually a
faster box than my main server/workstation (it's newer).

Thanks,

Rich

Ideally, DMZ != internal network. If they are on separate systems, then
if the web server is cracked it's still isolated from the rest of the
network, and the firewall is still secure. If the firewall is also the
web/mail/etc server, then compromising these also compromises the
firewall, at which point trojan utilities, and hacked services can 
replace the original secure ones and your firewall suddenly becomes
wide open and useless.

If the web server is on the internal network, then if it gets cracked
the firewall (which is still secure) may still be effective in limiting
connections between the compromised system and the outside world.

Has anyone else seen this?

Win2k on a P4
Exceed X server
Cygwin OpenSSH
Linux (Mandrake 8.1) machine I'm administering remotely

I give the following command (from my Cygwin bash windough):

ssh -f linuxbox gkrellm -wm

and presto, up pops gkrellm, the little lights all flashing, on my X11
Window System desktop.

Sometimes, but not always, I get the following error at the bash prompt:

401 Too many FTP users. Please try again later.
Login incorrect.


What gives? Is there something that gkrellm does with FTP that I don't know
about? There's also the defunct GrabWeather process associated with each
gkrellm process that never does a thing. I see GKrellWeather in the
configuration window but none of the plugins are activated.

Rich,

I think you would need to put caddis in the hosts file so that you could 
reference it by name in your firewall scripts and have it resolve. Or, you 
might just have to hardcode caddis' IP in your rules.

Since you are using a different host then you are going to be 
portforwarding the packets on port 80 to port 80 on caddis.

HTH,
Keith

The peninsula has no cable or dsl, or .... If we can get 10 customers
interested in $60/month, they'll give us wireless for free for getting
the project started. I'm thinking of getting frac-T1 brought in, and
setting up my own pop for those same 10 customers. But until that
happens, I'm stuck with dialup on a long wire; probably limiting
myself to something significantly less than 56K.

What he says is true.

This, however, is my ideal situation.

The firewall box has zero remote access. No ssh, telnet, rsh, or any other 
service running on it. It's simply a smart router that inspects packets (at 
least on the way in) and either passes or rejects them. Fewer services 
means fewer chances for a vulnerability to be found and exploited.

The firewall forwards requests for services to the appropriate box. Port 
80/443 goes to the webserver, etc. If these services are running on the 
firewall, then if  a vulnerability is found, and exploited, other ports may 
then be able to be opened, and the hacker gains access to the box. If you 
have a seperate machine doing the firewall, then this particular method is 
much more difficult, nearing impossibility. Take for instance if there's a 
possibility to hack apache and get it to drop to a shell. Most hackers then 
want to install other programs, and make the box work for them. If it's the 
firewall too, no problem. Just run the services, modify the firewall rules 
and they work. If it's not the firewall, then they still haven't cracked 
the firewall, and getting services out through that firewall are much more 
difficult. This assumes the firewall checks outbound packets too.

What is going to be on this webserver/SQL database? If it's doing 
ecommerce, then maybe the corporate lawyer should be talking to your boss 
about putting the assets of the company at risk. If it's just static pages, 
with no proprietary info on them, then it becomes a question of how much 
exposure to ridicule can the company stand.

Keith,

  /etc/hosts on all three boxes has all the hostnames. I find no hostname
references in the floppyfw files, that's why I asked.

  You've confused me here. I have three boxes connected to the switch (plus
a couple of portables that are not always wired in). The three boxes are
'router1', 'salmo' and 'caddis'. AFAIK, the latter two are equivalant when
seen from the firewall/router. Port forwarding occurs on router1 between the
two NICs and is mediated by floppyfw. No?

Thanks,

Rich

I wasn't too clear. :-). I meant the hosts file on the floppy firewall. I 
use the 1.9 version that has iptables support in it but I just downloaded 
the current ipchains version and there is a hosts file on that image as 
well.

If this is your layout:


Internet------router1(floppyfw box)------hub----salmo,caddis,etc

then:
Your floppyfw machine "router1" has two nics, one external and one 
internal. Web traffic that is coming in from the Internet has a 
destination of router1.appl-ecosys.com (or more precisely, the Internet IP 
assigned to that box). router1 either has to have the service listening on 
port 80 for web traffic OR it has to forward all the traffic destined for 
that port to another machine (port forwarding).

Hello,

	I've got my qmail server finally set up, but with one problem: I want
to be able to relay mail through my server from within my local network.
I have read everything I can get my hands on about relaying in Qmail and
they all say basically the same thing: make a file such as /etc/tcp.smtp
with these lines:
127.0.0.1:allow,RELAYCLIENT=""
192.168.0.:allow,RELAYCLIENT=""

Then, make a .cdb file using: qmailctl cdb
Okay, great. Problem is, I still get messages saying: "Recipient is not
in my list of rcpthosts" and won't deliver it.

Does anyone here have any idea what the problem might be? I've looked
over and over at all my config files, which I pretty much copied from
Life with Qmail, with the additional references of Running Qmail, DJB's
qmail pages, etc. It looks like it should be good to go. Is there a way
to fix this or should I maybe ditch the program and move to something
easier? (Any suggestions on what would be easier?)

After trying to get the RH7.1 update working  Monday, I used the system normally, then did a clean log out of the system.
I booted it up today and got the following:

Filesystem contains large files, but lacks LARGE_FILE flag in superblock.
/: UNEXPECTED INCONSISTENCY; RUN fsck MANUALLY.

I ran e2fsck -b 8193 /dev/hda   to change the location of the superblock since it looks like the one at block 1 has been corrupted. Even tried hda1 but still have the same problem.

Any ideas or should I just fdisk and start all over :-{  ?

Thanks, 
Steve Coffman

Hello,
Thank you for your reply.

In our situation firewall box should provide access for trusted remote
hosts to our Eng. Database over ssh, password protected user ftp
directory and user web server directories and may be telnet connection
(although it's not secure).

I wouldn't let them ssh into the firewall box. Port forward 22 to a box 
inside that they log into.

You can measure a programmer's perspective by noting his attitude on

I occasionally poke around the sites listed on the Red Hat mirrors 
page looking for rsync servers I can use for the care and feeding of 
my own mirror. The current version of the script I use and today's 
output (edited to remove unresponsive servers) follow.

Why? Just because I thought you'd like to know where you can get stuff 
via rsync :-)

If the length of this message bothers anyone (because of, say, a slow 
modem connection), let me know. I'll stop. Promise.

Alex,

  Doesn't matter. The bits will flow through the firewall/router as easily
as stopping there. I access my network from outside via ssh; you'd need only
to define the users allowed to use it. ftp can be set up for anonymous
access and so that only those knowing specific file names can 'get' them.

Yes. "Windows" is a registered trademark owned by the Beast of Redmond
(wonder what the folks at the trademark office were smoking that day...)
It's also not the proper name for X.

That said, I just want to emphasize that - despite his entanglement in
Randal's clue filter - Geoff has put a lot of work into this presentation
and he does know what he's talking about. The presentation is aimed at
beginning to intermediate users who want to be able to customize their X

Even if in a different part of Oregon, I encourage people to join the
mailing list if they can help us get things going, and provide some
technical expertise.  There are likely to be a number of fellow OIT
College students with no experience at all in anything but Windows,
though there are some who like to tweak with one distro or another.
 
I kick myself now for not making it to a PLUG meeting when I lived
there, maybe I will be able to arange a Portland visit on the first
Thursday of a month 'fore long.
 
We'll have to figure out meeting time, locations, what kind of pizza
everyone likes, etc.

I admit I have my firewall for my home network setup this way. One big 
difference is that I'm not letting any outside systems connect to any 
of the running services on my firewall. I'm not sure I would want to do 
what your manager wants since the box could be comprised through one of 
the running services that you're making publicly available.

I think it better to have the firewall port forward to other systems 
that reside in a DMZ. Systems within the DMZ have no connection with 
your internal network and so nothing really bad can happen if a system 
in the DMZ is compromised. If a system is brought in from the DMZ it 
should be considered suspect such that it is flattened and a complete 
reinstall of all software is performed.

I've seen some places that use two firewalls such that the DMZ resides 
between the firewalls. The back firewall safeguards the internal 
network. 

All I can say is that it won't matter how you have the iptable rules 
setup for each NIC since once the firewall has been compromised the 
intruder can then from from the Internet into your Intranet. The amount 
of time and cost in terms of lost work and productivity by yourself and 
other personnel within the company will exceed the cost of a couple of 
old Pentium systems by a very large factor.

This also protects the DMZ from the users on the internal network. In some 
recent studies, 80% of all hacks occurred from inside the firewall.

FWIW, I saw a story that a judge in California had questioned the
legitimacy of the trademark.  Sorry I don't remember any details.  It
might have involved Lindows.  Not sure.  Ah, here is something on it:

$100/month rent explains a lot.  Have you considered satellite?  It's a
little more costly than cable or DSL, but significantly less than a
fractional T1.  I think it's about 256K of bandwidth.  The uplink and
downlink time could make latency an issue for delay sensitive apps (internet
games, voice etc.).  Just a thought.

I checked into it for my house, but I have too many trees blocking the
southern sky.  I couldn't get wireless either.

Good luck,

CurtisE

The peninsula has no cable or dsl, or .... If we can get 10 customers
interested in $60/month, they'll give us wireless for free for getting
the project started. I'm thinking of getting frac-T1 brought in, and
setting up my own pop for those same 10 customers. But until that
happens, I'm stuck with dialup on a long wire; probably limiting
myself to something significantly less than 56K.

Sorry, I think I got that wrong.  Looks like the federal judge is in
Seattle, which the last time I checked wasn't in California.  Oops.

So how does this work.  Say I'm offering htppd over 80, I can see how they 
can crash apache, but how do they get it to run ssh, telnet or whatever to 
offer a shell across a network.

Maybe you could plop it on your website and just post the link next
time? 

I don't have a slow modem or anything, it's the principle of the
thing, sending a fairly lengthy message to all 318 current
subscribers.  Next thing you know, people are going to start using the
mailing list to test whether their email is working...

In these cases, a typical ploy is to cause the app to buffer overflow, and 
it drops to a shell. Unfortunately, the shell provides the prompt over the 
already established tcp/ip link on port 80. This is also why it's common 
practice to not use a privileged user to run daemons.

Hi,
Thank you for your explanations.
If I right undestood, firewall box should work as a packet filter and 
a router for internal servers.
If service request comes to the firewall port 80 it should forward it
to web server port 80 behind the firewall and respectfully the same
deal for mail server on port 25.
How in this case firewall will handle remote ssh database connections
if exchanged data is encapsulated within ssh protocol?   

Alex

The same as with any other ssh connection. The encrypted data is 
encapsulated within the tcp/ip packet.

GKrellWeather gets it's info from a .gov ftp server. I figured that out
when I started using it and all of a sudden my firewall at home was
getting hammered from this .gov site.. needless to say I thought I was

Anyhoo.. this is just a display message you're getting from firing it
off from the command line.

You might try configuring it again and then turning it off if you don't
really want to use it.

  Other than defining the root directory as /usr/local/apache, and the
target as i686, are there other apache configuration options I should
enable/disable before building? I've no idea if the defaults are optimal or
not. All new to me.

That depends heavily on what you want to do with the server.....
If you want to mess with PHP I would definitely recommend the additional 
switch to ./configure:

--enable-module=so

that way you can build and install DSO's (loadable modules for Apache) and 
install additional stuff without having to rebuild Apache every time....

I'm guessing you're building 1.3.X please forgive me if I'm mistaken

Brian,

  I'm building 2.0.35 (why not use the newest?). I don't anticipate doing
anything with PHP. What's driving this is the need for a web interface for
MailMan.

  There are a couple of groups of which I am a member and we want a way to
communicate among ourselves. So, I offered to set up a listserv and mailman
won the toss. Since I need to install apache for mailman, I might as well
bring my small web site inside the firewall from its current place at my
ISP. And, it may be that the two groups want a web site each, too.

  I've seen PHP mentioned, but I've no idea for what I'd use it. One thing I
do know is that I'm not going to spend more than the absolute mininum amount
of time futzing with the httpd. Screw it down tightly, keep up with security
patches, and ignore it (except for reviewing logs).

  Regardless, your recommendation to enable modules (is that as shared
object libraries?) makes eminent sense. I'll do it. And that's exactly the
kind of advice I'm seeking.

Many thanks,

Rich

If you really want to spend the least amount of time, why not go with
the RedHat RPMs? (assuming you do RPMs :-) One command and a few minutes
and your up, and on to the real job of configuring mailman. Of course
you'll have to create/move a website to the docroot.

If there are security issues with the latest ones of those I'd certainly
like to know about it ;-)

Keith,

  Only because the only packages I found are 1.3.x. I suppose that for my
purposes it doesn't matter which version I'm using and I could always
upgrade when someone creates a .src.rpm for me to rebuild.

  OK.

2.0 is still pretty bleeding edge.  It's released as stable now,
but a number of 3rd party modules are just being ported to work
with it (for example, PHP4).  For your purposes, I don't see much
reason to not use 1.3.  It's been pretty rock-solid for some time.

Wil,

  Works for me. Because I've not followed anything about web servers it just
seemed reasonable to go for the latest edition.

  Tomorrow I'll grab the package.

Many thanks,

You probably have relaying setup correctly. The qmailctl script threw me for a
loop as I have never encountered it before. So the problem is probably in
receiving mail, not sending.


http://www.lifewithqmail.org/lwq.html#multiple-hostnames
==========================================
3.3. Multiple host names
If your system is known by more than one name, e.g., all addresses of the form
user at host1.example.com can also be written as user at example.com or
user at mail.example.com, then you need to tell qmail this so it'll know which
addresses it should deliver locally and which messages it should accept from
remote systems.
To do this, just add all of the names to two control files:
rcpthosts, which tells qmail-smtpd to accept mail addressed to these hosts, and
locals, which tells qmail-send that addresses on these hosts are to be
delivered locally.
===========================================

I don't think I can say it better than this. 


Thank you
Russell

Since you have linear in your lilo.conf you may want to confirm the BIOS is
also setting the disk to LBA.

Does the output of e2label match the labels in your fstab file?


Thank you

Once booted what does mount give as output? 

Where does linux rescue mount your drives? chroot to the mount point of your /
and then mount	/home on / for your home directories. If the linux rescue
doesn't mount your rive for you mount your / at /mnt and then do a chroot /mnt/
A telinit 3 should start all your services. This will get you back to a working
server, I think, and give you time to figure out what's wrong.

Thank you
Russell

Yeah, yeah...  {chuckle}  Guess I *am* a bit distracted at the moment...

I'm still likely to miss the meeting, just because I have so much to do.
Ah well, given the choice, I'd rather it work out this way anyway.

Thanks,

I did once, but at the time, they weren't supporting linux; in fact,
the web page went to great lenghts to emphasize that linux was not to
be used.

My concern with many of these tools is that they're windoze based, and
if you aren't running that os, then you can't connect. I'm not sure
how well wine or vmware support these products.

Subject: [PLUG] font selection method forgotten
Message-ID: <20020501233918.D11294@defiant>

I feel nuts. A few weeks ago, I asked how to change the default fonts.
Someone gave good instructions, and it worked. Now I'm on a different
server, and I want to do the same thing, but I can't find that email.
I'm sure it's buried somewhere on this laptop, but I'm sure not
finding it.

I tried gfontsel, and it gives me a nice display, but it doesn't
change the fonts. I think there was another step, but it appears that
I need a memory jogger.

TIA!

I understand your concern.  I could even understand abstaining from using
these services on the principle that they lack Linux (or anything other than
Windoz) support.  However, when you run thin on affordable broadband
options, sometimes principles can become secondary considerations.

I can't say for sure with regard to wireless or satellite, but just because
they don't support Linux doesn't necessarily mean it will not work.  For
example, I have AT&T cable and their web page lists Windoz (several flavors)
as a "system requirement" which in my mind is a bit stronger verbiage than
"not supported".  I have a Linux box, a Solaris box, a PDA, a Cisco router,
a Bay switch and a Novell server (on a wireless network) and yes, a couple
flavors of Windoz boxes all hanging off of this connection and accessing the
internet just fine.  The reason they say Windoz is a requirement is because
they have some lame utilities on a CD that one of their less than network
savvy technicians can use to configure your machine and the utilities are
only written for Windoz.  The utilities are not needed and I wouldn't trust
their techs or software within 10 feet of my systems anyway.  It's also a
cost savings measure, as they don't have to staff their call center with
Linux/UNIX/Mac savvy people.

Seems to me, if their equipment has an Ethernet interface and their network
supports IP, it's a big stretch to say Linux (or anything else with an
Ethernet interface and running IP) won't work.  Even if their equipment has
a serial or USB interface, it could be made to work with a bit more effort.
I'm not aware of any ISPs that don't support IP...

I'll shut my pie hole now.  I'm new here and don't want to be annoying.  I'm
just trying to help you save some $.

I thot maybe this would be simpler. But to get the file, you first
have to be a member of SourceForge. SO, I joined, but that took a
while to get the mail from the end of my huge backlog of spam (Not
fixing that in this message). Then I got the file (crypt-0.03.zip),
and opened it up. It's pretty small. I changed an option in the
CFLAGS: -mpentium got removed. I couldn't find any documentation in
gcc about it, but decided that since it's running on a 486, that flag
was best deleted.

Then I ran make. But there's no Install target in the makefile, so I'm
not sure where to put the file so that the other build(s) will find it.

*Use it wisely.* That's interesting. Why would you say that? What should
I be aware of?

1. right. But they weren't there.
2. verified it with telnet (the isp supports it, but I generally don't
use it. and I still get email every 30 minutes with it [thru fetchmail].)
3. interesting thot, but I'm not sure it's appropriate yet.
Particularly since Pacifier doesn't support linux.
4. I like that idea, but I've found on my laptop, that network
connections have to be run as root. And this article suggests that as
well. but all my other 'user' stuff is run as brucek. OTOH, maybe pppd
is using user ROOT instead of user BRUCEK, even tho that is what is in
the pap script. I'll try that tomorrow.

This sure looks like a username password problem. Is the syntax of
your /etc/ppp/pap-secrets 
brucek     *         yourpassword

Also, you called it pap_secrets in your message. It should be pap-secrets.
maybe that was just a typo, or maybe that is the problem.

For doing things like serving up static pages and supporting the 
Mailman scripts, Apache 2.0 will work just fine. Here's a brief 
configure invocation that'd probably do the trick:

  CC=gcc CFLAGS='-O2' \
  ./configure \
    --prefix=/usr/local/apache \
    --enable-mods-shared='most' \
    --enable-auth-digest \
    --enable-ssl \
    --enable-cgi \
    --enable-so

If you won't be using the Mailman web interface from off-site (or if 
you'll only be using it via something like an ssh tunnel), then the 
auth-digest and ssl options aren't really needed.

If you'd like to have your logs stored in /var rather than /usr, then
just put $localstatedir somewhere else, e.g.,

  --localstatedir=/var/local/apache

I've been testing Apache 2.0 in a couple locations for a while now:  
one is setup with mod_perl and AxKit, the other with SSL, DAV, and PHP
4.2 (including MySQL, Postgres, and XSLT supprt). Neither site has 
experienced any hiccups.

  Taking the advice offered by several of you, I downloaded
apache-1.3.22-0.6.i386.rpm for RH 6.2 (what we're running) rather than the
source for the 7.2 rpm. They're the same apache version, it's only the
package version that appears to differ.

  For those of you running apache-1.3.22 on a Red Hat system, are there
security or other differences among these flavors of which I should be
aware?

Thanks,

Rich

All;

Correction--I wrote, "Saturday, April 5th" for our Install fest. I should have written, "Saturday, April 4th!"

All the flavors of satellite internet now require Windows. I 
investigated this thoroughly 6 months or so ago. Starband was
the only one that didn't and they changed with the "improved"
modem change towards the end of last year.

The reason is that the connection utilizes a proprietary protocol
and data compression scheme. Starband used to implement it in hardware,
but now all the services provide it as a Windows driver, essentially
turning the modem into something similar to a Winmodem. I've heard
that a Linux version of the software exists, but Earthlink, Starband,
et. al. won't provide it and the developer that they license it from
won't license it to end users.

Without the special Windows software the connection works, but the
throughput is no better than ISDN.

There are several newsgroups available if you want to research it on
your own:
  alt.satellite.internet
  alt.satellite.starband
  alt.satellite.direcpc

And DSLReports has several forums that discuss it as well.

Wireless works fine. I'm running a link over a pair of Cisco 802.11b
bridges with a Linux box at my end.

It gets pretty cool when you figure out that *you* are in control. That *you* get to flip the switches in the configuration files. It's also comforting to know that you can restore your machine to it's *exact* state with a good backup without re-installing!

Check the spelling of the directory carefully. If Emacs finds that it does not exist, Emacs will want to create it.

No worries. Linux will give you plenty to fill up your plate, I guarantee it. Over time you will begin to understand the underpinnings of the system. The skills you learn to configure Apache, for example, will carry over when you want to configure say Samba (a file sharing background process, or 'daemon' that allows Windows computers to attach to your computer through the 'Network Neighborhood') or the X Window System.

Oh, I almost forgot..... I believe that because of where this special
software sits in the protocol stack that it doesn't work with the
standard M$ Internet Connection Sharing. But I don't know enough
about M$ networking to be able to say for certain. The newsgroups
and forums will have much more information.

Hey I was wondering if anyone has jpegs of their desktop posted. It
probably sounds funny, but I think its cool to check out what can be done
with different window managers, themes, and generally see what other
people's workspaces are like. Displays of the desktop under X were what
initially led me to try linux... (Wow! Its not just like CDE!)

I posted some jpegs below, enlightenment's the window manager (no gnome or
kde).

Ah, so!  So whatever a 'link' is technically speaking, once establised, 
almost any unix program can converse over it. Wow!

Some other desktop themes I'm really partial to:

http://darkalloy.catarsys.net/image.php?image=themes/ClockworkCobalt.jpg

This also enlightenment, the theme was made by darkalloy.

http://www.engr.orst.edu/~dagit/desktop.jpg

This one is Slate I think, also running under enlightenment. The
desktops I posted earlier were under the default theme (Brushed-metal).

Btw, if you're running X you can do a screenshot with the "import
<filename>" command.

Enjoy!

  If you believe that beauty is more than skin deep (pun intended), try to

At the time (several years ago) we were only worrying about the 
possibility of an attacker getting into the DMZ and protecting the 
internal network. Sadly you're correct that now the back firewall must 
be able withstand an attack from either side.

hmmmm

the *NIX mantra is as follows:

"Everything is a file"

(this includes files, devices, sockets, etc)

file descriptors, 0,1,and 2 are stdin,stdout, and stderr...
The trick with web servers on *NIX systems, is that ports < 1024 are 
'protected' which means only root can open them....so the way apache 
basically works is it starts as root, opens port 80 and accepts connections 
as a non-priviledged user (apache, www, nobody, etc.) otherwise, could you 
imagine a server running CGI scripts as root? (That would be phun to play 
with.)

Programmatically, you can close standard input, output, and error and 
redirect them to wherever..files, INET sockets, or UNIX domain sockets .. 
even devices if your a sadist to some extent.

Hello,
I was in Fry's yesterday and the only available 4 port 
cable-dsl-router on sale is SMC7004ABR at $69.99.
Their salesman confirmed that they didn't have any of these devices on
sale at $39 price tag.
Where did you get that $39 deal? In your dreams?
The next logical question: What's better to use as a firewall, that
neat appliance or an old pentium PC with two NICs?

Thanks.
Alex

if you are running X you can also get a screenshot using 'xwd -root'

this is a neat little way to see what people are doing on a box you don't 
have console on....especially those that set their X access with 'xhost +'

Well, as much as I hate to recommend that anyone buy anything from
Fry's, that's a good price on a nice piece of equipment.  I have some
experience with that unit (My brother in law has one & I've tinkered
with it, helped set it up) and it's a pretty versatile unit, especially
for the price.  

It works well w/ Linux, has a little internal web server so that you can
manage it through a browser, & it even has an internal print server so
you can hang a parallel-port printer off of it.  It's also gotten rave
reviews from about 3 or 4 of the sites that I looked at.

I'm sure that an older PC w/ 2 NICs can be a lot more versatile, but on
the other hand, you don't hear of any exploits being written for the
micro-OS that the SMC unit runs (I don't recall what it is now...).

I *love* Linux, but I'd suggest that you give that SMC box serious
consideration.  If nothing else, it only takes a few minutes to set up,
& then you can use the rest of your time to put out other fires...

Just my $.02...

Message-ID: <NJEJLCMFPMMBDMEBIPKOCEBECAAA.mboynay@silverliningdev.com>

I work for a small company that uses a cluster of windows boxes. We have 3
printers that we want to share from one box.  We want to start integrating
Linux into our network for an application server, floppy-fw, and web server.

I wanted to know if anyone could recommend or give insight on what could be
done to set up a print server on a Linux box.  I also need to understand the
hardware portion of running 3 printers off one box as well.  Is there some
interface that would connect all three together?

Thanks in advance,

You'll get lots of suggestions from this crowd :-) I'd suggest looking

My mistake, I double-checked this ad (reverse side of sunday oregonian's
sports section) and its actually advertising for the linksys 5-port
switch, which looks a lot like the router. I knew it was too good to be
true. :P

You can hang all 3 printers from separate parallel ports on the linux 
machine. I have configured a three printer system using the two parallel ports 
supported by the motherboard plus a parallel port on an extension card.
I currently only used the printers from the machine they are connected to so the 
the software configuration would not be useful to you. 
I have not used it yet, but I am planning to move to 
Cups http://www.cups.org/  It uses IPP, the internet printing protocol 
(modeled on http) for network printing,  and its configuration/security is
modeled on apache.

1. Well look at the printers .

If the printers are nice postscript printers, life is good. 
There for any old box will do, with 3 lpr ports.

If the printers are kind of dumb, then the cpu will do the rendering of
the page via ghost script, gnu postscript. 

I have seen that that one in a while , that ghostscript fails to print
pages on my Apollo printer, cheap HP Deskjet re branded

If it were me I would look in to the new samba.  

New samba can be used as NT 4.0 PDC. 

Also one can use PAM, Pluggable Authentication  Modules, to have the NT
PDC allow you to login to a linux box. 

http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/modules.html

I fixed it. Turns out that in addition to using tcpserver to field all
smtp calls, there was a qmail entry in xinetd also that was conflicting.

In using Samba for sharing printers on a Linux server, I use "raw" 
printers with no input or output filters on them. I have my Samba 
configuration setup to specify what Windows printer driver a given 
"raw" printer needs to so when a Windows client sets up a remote 
printer, the driver is usually automatically installed by Windows. 

For Linux clients I have ghostscript install since one of my laser 
printers is PCL only. The postscript output from Linux programs needs 
to be filtered into something a non-postscript LaserJet 4 understands.

My setup is pretty simple and I just use the BSD print spooler system 
on my Linux servers.

Absolutely. The Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) is very good. It supports printing over the router using IPP/IP (printing to a remote sight, for example), Web-based administration interface, and the ability for Windows clients to connect to the printer with the "Add Printer" function through the "Network Neighborhood."

You can get it here:

    www.cups.org

I have installed it on several machines, and it is very good. 

BTW: IPP/IP is supported by HP, Microsoft, e.t.c.

The real question depends on what you mean by better.

Is it better to dump the old pentium in the landfill, or find a useful
purpose for it?  There is no need to spend any money, people are giving
away those old boxes that don't run the latest bloat from up north.

Is it better to have a micro-os that is limited and almost impossible to
upgrade or add software to, or to have a lot of choices about what
distribution and what software will do the job at hand?  When an exploit
for the micro-os's is found, how will you be able to patch it?

Is it better to have all the hardware proprietary, or to have a box that
can be replaced in part or in whole for almost no cost at all?

Is it better to have an easy configuration, with limited options, or a
more difficult configuration that can be fine tuned to your needs?

Anyway, I prefer the flexibility (and cost) of the old pentium.

Good Luck

Derek Loree

I'd like to know what the M$ definition of a "machine" is.

Seems like if you took donations for motherboards, cases, video cards,
NIC's, etc. none of the pieces could be called a "machine".  The only
thing that would be questionable would be storage, if the OS comes on
the harddrive, it may have to stay there (legally).

On the other hand, by not running that other OS, you are not agreeing to
the license agreement, as per the agreement, and, as per the agreement,
you must uninstall all software that you don't agree with and destroy
any backup copies (which is just the way we want it).  Nowhere does it
mention that you have to take the machine back to the retailer.

In fact, doesn't the license agreement give you the _right_ (as in
privilege) to run the software, as long as you agree to the terms.  It
has been a while since I have read through the entire agreement, but I
don't recall it stating that I _must_ run the software, it has always
been, you _may_ run this software if you agree to these terms.

Ok, I know I'm rambling, but where does M$ get this sh*t?

Thanks for letting me vent.

What models of printers do you have working with CUPS?  Does it still use 
ghostscript on the back end?  I have three printers in my house, and at 
least 4 or 5 machines to printer from, and I've gotten pretty irritated 
with the existing RedHat gimp-print stuff.  I'd like to have all the 
"processing" of the printing offloaded to the actual print SERVER, rather 
than done on each of the clients.  Figuring out what has gone wrong when 
something won't print is making me pull my hair out.

That's an addictive app.  It's nice to see visually when you've got a

And it chats on the network every minute. Couldn't someone rewrite it to use

The license only states that the software must stay with the machine. It
does not say that the machine must stay with the software. There is a big
difference.

Hehe, yeah, as long as you don't install that *particular* license code on any 
*other* machine, you're good.  Installing another OS over it or instead of it 
isn't specifically mentioned, although I'm sure that's what they were trying 
to prevent by that verbage.

Is it just me or does everyone else hate 'lawyerese' as well?

    I finally started looking at all of my old mail to build a more
complete PLUG archive.  This will take a bit longer, but so far I
have found:

             Year               Number of Messages
             1994                     100
             1995                     300
             1996                    1000
             1997                    2400
             1998                    7400
             1999                   11100

             2002 thru April         4000

   Just thought people might be curious.  It really doesn't mean much
since the list has moved a number of times and more recently we have
started moving activity to other lists, but still ....

    In any case, I just want people to know that I'm working on the
main PLUG list.  Once I'm done with it, I will probably put up archives
of a few other lists - especially the Mid-Valley group's list and

Hello,
I don't have any available old pentium PC and my budged is tight.
I have to make a choice between an old PC which is more flexible but 
prone to physical failure or a new proprietary box with firewall
hardware and software with MTBF enough to forget about.
Which poison should I choose?

  Yup.

  I've been running CUPS for ... two years? I don't recall. Maybe 1.5 years.
Anyway, there have been absolutely no problems setting it up or getting
print jobs out. When I need to print maps from my virtual win98, they print
just fine, too.

Alex,
I would say just get the easy box for now.  I have a linksys at home (work
bought) and it is fine.  Sure you can't setup advanced fire walling rules or
that kind of cool stuff but it will port forward and allows you to setup a
DMZ server.  If you would like to go the other route I have a P60 with 12mb
ram, a 500mb hd and one 3c509 ISA nic, yours for a few select dollars or
trade for something I need.  Just find yourself another NIC and you are good
to go.

Hm.  I'm running two HPs (1100A, and IIPplus) and an Epson Photo 820.  The 
Epson has given me the most problems (due to color inaccuracy).

See, my problem has been with really weird stuff, like PDFs from the US
tax site that ghostscript just totally barfs on (but xpdf can save it to a
sane .ps file), etc.  Does CUPS have a sane error reporting facility?

What distributions do you have CUPS running on?

I think I get it, this means that you have to throw away the software,
instead of installing it on another machine.  In which case, the
donation instructions (from the M$ site) are only valid if the
organization will be using any M$ OS on the donated machine.  So the
organization can accept the donation without the original OS docs and
disks, as long as the organization agrees to never run an M$ OS on the
donated machine.

This actually sounds reasonable, from a linux advocate point of view,
anyway.

Am I missing something in this translation?

Keep PLUGing.

There are three drivers, or "modules" included free with CUPS: a generic printer, an HP Laserjet, and an Epson. 

Does it still use ghostscript on the back end? 

Check this out (with CUPS):

lp -Pmyprinter document.ps

It automatically detects it as a Postscript document, "plugs in" the correct filter, and prints it correctly! It works!

  Have you checked the linux printer site for the Epson's compatability?
Also, Easy Software (the manufacturers of CUPS) sells their own printer
drivers that are outstanding. I bought the package so that I could get the
maximum from my 2500C. I'm highly pleased with the results.

  Two things going on here: gs prior to 6.0 were terrible for pdf (at least,
the ps2pdf tool was garbage) so be sure you have a current gs installed.
Second, what happens when you try to print from acroread? I've not had
results from xpdf that are as good as those from acroread. Regardless, I can
write the file to disk from either (as a .ps file) then send it to the
printer with the lpr command.

Yeah, the gimp-print stuff works pretty well.  The colors don't match to 
real life very well, though.  So be it.  :)

Yup, after finding some of the errors in the spool directory, I 
double-checked my gs, and it was the most recent.

It was actually the failure of acroread to print it that helped me figure 
out what was going on.  xpdf actually worked (it usually so-so, like you 
said).  I couldn't get acroread's .ps export to print either.  really odd.

Ah, cool.  I'm starting to think I just have bad luck with printers.  :)

  FWIW, I'm running ESP Print-Pro v.4.2. And it does do the ps -> pcl
conversion without intervention. Given how well it works, I couldn't justify
the extra cost of a postscript printer.

  I just finished speaking with my insurance agent. He hates Bill Gates,
Microsoft and Windows with a passion. Unfortunately, all the insurance
software runs only on Windows. At the office he's running w2k and it's been
stable for him. At home, they run XP and I would not quote him here, for
children might be reading this list. XP apparently crashes regularly, wipes
out files and creates great anger and misery in the family.

  He's heard of linux and wishes us well in displacing Microsoft on the
desktop. He also is hoping that the states prevail in their lawsuit because,
in his words, the settlement of the federal case was a bigger capitulation
than was running out of Viet Nam for the US government.

I recently had an interesting experience with XP.  A club that is part of a
national organization asked me to help them get their accounting system
working.  The accounting package would not work with XP.  The company that
make it said it would be about a year before they would have a version that
would.  They had to use this software package because the national
organization requires it.  They had baught a new PC and it had XP.  They had
a new copy of ME.  Me would not install because it did not know what to make
of XP.  I tried to format the drive and there was just a small partition
that was the C drive.  It would not format the other partitions.  I tried to
use fdisk to remove the other partitions and it refused to do it.  Finally,
I want home and made a Linux boot disk.  I used the Linux version of fdisk
to remove the partitions and made a new partition that I could then format
and install ME on.  It seemed like they had made it as hard as possible to
get XP off of that PC.

Message-ID: <B14FD9A4BE25D31188A400508B2CBB6FC24EE0@mailsrvnt04.enet.sharplabs.com>

Sisters and Brothers,

Last night, while attempting for the second time to compile the 2.4.8 kernel
on my new P4, I couldn't get the modules to compile.

make xconfig: checked and unchecked the appropriate boxes. All fine.
make deps bzImage modules modules-install: goes through deps and bzImage but
dies on the modules.

It looked like the error message came from missing source code. But if the
kernel compiled does that not imply that at least most of the code is
around?

I'd have posted the error message but....

That's what the next email/call for help is about....

  Not all printers are equally supported under linux. If it's really
important to you, the cost of Print-Pro (assuming it supports your printers)
may be worth it.

how about this one:

make clean dep bzImage modules modules_install

There are no targets "dep" and "modules-install" in a kernel makefile.. so it's
not making the dependencies that it needs, that's why it looks like it's
missing some source or something.

....so,

after I tried to get my kernel compiled and failed, I figured, "Heck, ask
the PLUGGERS!"

Lawdy, lawdy, ain't nutt'n but trubba!

I couldn't get the NIC to do anything. ifconfig says its up and has an IP
but the MAC came up as FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. The NIC is an Intel 10/100 built
in on the AX4T. I could ping it from the neighboring machine. It obviously
got an IP address from DHCP. What gives?

<whine>
But it works fine in Windows!
</whine>

I also noticed from dmesg that the NIC was not terribly happy about its
configuration. I'll try again this evening to grab the error message and
plunk it on a floppy. (Pray de lawd fo' sneakuh net! AMEN, bruthuh!)

Clues greatly appreciated. Flames, too, as long as they are off the list!

Don't get too nit picky. I'm doing this from memory so if I left off or
added a letter/character, that's not the problem. I got the compile to go
(as I said) and the exact make target was correct, I just didn't produce the
exact one in my message.

The question's still about why the modules didn't compile. That's where it
died.

Does it matter what distro I'm using (mdk 8.1)? I'd imagine all the kernel
Makefiles are pretty similar.

Hehe... OK.

Did you grab the sources directly from kernel.org.  Or, more directly, where
did the source come from?  You might try getting fresh sources from a reliable
location.

The distro shouldn't matter, as long as all the libraries are installed.  If
you can get all the other parts going, then it shouldn't be a problem.

Did you try "make mrproper"?  Try that and then the other line (make clean dep
bzImage modules modules_install).

Also, try configuring it with "make menuconfig" at a console/xterm and see if
the options you're using are still selected.  Basically, what you're trying to
do is see if "make xconfig" did something wrong.

Not to re-awaken an old, dead thread, but I happened across the email I
sent to Dave about this class this afternoon.

I figured the ``X Windows" term came from me: I have this habit of adding
an ``s" to the end of certain nouns (e.g. Nordstrom's). And calling the
GUI interface found on most UNIX boxes ``X windows" is a bad habit I
sometimes laspe into. However, in the email I clearly said the topic of
the talk was ``Configuring X".

I guess this means Dave won't be working for Stonehenge Consulting in the
near future.

See all of you tonight.

OK. Thanks, Mike. I'll try that. I got the sources from the ISO image, I
guess. I d/l'd them, burnt the CD's and loaded the whole ball o' wax on. All
I was doing was making a custom kernel -- I don't need GigaBit Enet or
Bluetooth, etc.

I read about the mrproper target. I didn't read it until after I had done
the compile initially. So should I just rewind, and do that first, before I
do the clean dep bzImage....?

I personally can't fathom trusting something as important as printing
to any closed-source software.  Ironically, printing is the
_canonical_ example that Stallman uses, the thing that caused him to
start the Free Software Foundation.

I've had this happen myself. Sometime's I'll simply 'rm -rf' the /usr/src/linux directory and start from scratch:

   cd /usr/src
   tar xvfz linux-kernel-tarball.tar.gz
   cd linux
   make xconfig
   make dep
   make bzImage
   make modules
   make modules_install

Subject: [PLUG] samba mount problem
Message-ID: <20020502233600.8597210E055@pons.enet.sharplabs.com>

I've just set up samba (by the seat of my pants) on my Linux machine
(stock Mandrake 8.2) and I'm noticing some strange behaviour.

As with nearly everything having to do with Linux networking, I'm a
novice, so go easy please.
Explanations are welcome, however.  I love to learn.

The Story

After mucking around in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file I seem to have gotten
samba to mount remote "shares" from Windows machines w/in our lab
(which is all I care about; I don't want to share anything off the Linux
box just now).

Then I tried mounting a "share" on a colleague's w2k machine which I
don't apparently have permission to get into.

I did:

   smbmount //<machine name>/user ~/mnt

(where I have a dir called `mnt' in my home directory).

It mounted just fine (after I entered my M$ Domain password) and
I can see it mounted in the output of `mount'.

But when I try to

   smbumount ~/mnt

I get

   Could not open /home/deanm/mnt:  Permission denied.

I also get

   ls:  mnt: Permission denied

which I do `ls -l'  (but not when I do `ls').

So what's the matter and how can I unmount the thing---short of re-booting?

I've also tried stopping the smb and nmb daemons, restarting them,
killing the `smbmount' command that was showing up in `ps ax'.
Nothing seems to work.

I just had to figure out how to mount a samba share here at work.  The
things I ran into were:

I couldn't run smbmount as my user, so I had to do it as root.
I didn't want to login into the other server as root so I had to add
this flag: -o username=rob
Then, it shows up in 'df' and in 'mount'.  But I couldn't write to the
share b/c it was owned by root, so I added 'uid=rob'.  

My final command was this:
smbmount //homer/projects /mnt/samba/homer -o username=rob,uid=rob

Maybe that's the reason for your permission errors?

BTW, I don't think you need smbd and nmbd running to connect to
another machine via smb, just when other machines are connecting to
you.  (Correct me if I'm wrong)

Subject: [PLUG] Hollywood Theatre rental information (re: Revolution OS)
Message-ID: <86offyrtzu.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

I said I was going to investigate this a few months ago, and someone
brought it up at the last monthly meeting, so to avoid total
embarrassment this time, I actually got off my "otherwise engaged"
butt and called up the Hollywood Theatre just now.  I had emails off
to the Hollywood and the film distributor people, but neither got
replies.  Still haven't contacted the latter.

Here's the dope:

  For a non-profit fundraiser-type event (e.g. FreeGeek??), they
  charge $300/$400 for weeknight/weekend, respectively.  That includes
  setup and tear down and some promotion (announced on the theatre's
  website and a 1600 member mailing list).  That is for either of
  their auditoriums (one seats 480 and the other 180, if I got that
  correctly).

I guess I should renew my efforts to contact the revolution-os.com
people.

mrproper will nuke your .config file.  It basically tries to recreate the 
initial virgin state of the source tree.  You may want to move your .config 
to a safe place before you do this, then move it back.

Running up2date -u today to get updated on a few new packages like
sudo I get this message and only headers are downloaded:


[...]
  Testing package set / solving RPM inter-dependencies...
  There was a package dependency problem.  The message was:

  ==Unresolvable chain of dependencies:
  perl-Perl-RPM  0.291-2                   requires librpm.so.0
  perl-Perl-RPM  0.291-2                   requires librpmio.so.0

I don't understand what this is trying to tell me.  Looks like it
means that I'm missing some libraries required for 
perl-Perl-RPM 0.291-2 

But I have both the files mentioned:
  root # rpm -ql rpm-4.0.2-8|grep librpm
  /usr/lib/librpm.so.0
  /usr/lib/librpm.so.0.0.0
  /usr/lib/librpmbuild.so.0
  /usr/lib/librpmbuild.so.0.0.0
  /usr/lib/librpmio.so.0
  /usr/lib/librpmio.so.0.0.0

So first, why is this failing?
Second: 
After trying to get the RH7.1 update working  , I used the system normally, then did a clean log out of the system.
I booted it up today and got the following:

Filesystem contains large files, but lacks LARGE_FILE flag in superblock.
/: UNEXPECTED INCONSISTENCY; RUN fsck MANUALLY.

I ran e2fsck -b 8193 /dev/hda   to change the location of the superblock since it looks like the one at block 1 has been corrupted. Even tried hda1 but still have the same problem.

Any ideas or should I just fdisk and start all over :-{  ?
Any help would be appreciated before I reload.
Thanks,


Steve Coffman

Firstly, make sure you are using the newest up2date.  It came out a few 
weeks ago and fixed many problems.

Never seen that particular message, someone else can help there.  But there 
are 4? superblocks--did you try all of them.  And yes, you need to specify 
a partition to e2fsck, not just `hda`.

While I have ruined a few installations in the early days and resorted to 
re-installing, it is seldom really necessary.  You learn a lot more by 
repairing the damage.  Now whether learning an os from the bloddy hands 
perspective is fun to *you* is another matter.

It has a dash. I tried to verify your previous question with an

No worries. Once you get the hang of Samba it makes sense but setting it up in some environments is not obvious.

Would you send the output of the following command:

    smbclient -L [remote machine]

If it asks you for a password (it uses your username by default) and it does not accept it then let us know that too.

Also a quick (and insecure method) for getting it to work. If the following works then we're definitely zeroing in on the problem:

  mount -t smbfs -o mode 0777 //remote_machine/share ~/mnt

If not then try the above without the '-t smbfs' option.

Finally, check out www.samba.org, especially the "Troubleshooting Techniques" PDF under the "Documentation" section.

Message-ID: <20020503034436.74541.qmail@web9601.mail.yahoo.com>

I tend to feel that questions about WINE are
under-represented on this list, but in any case, I
have one. If an application runs under WINE, of
course, the interface looks exactly as it would under
Windows, and that includes the printing menu. So I
suppose if you can print under WINE, there must be a
new printer driver in the pull-down menu that
activates Linux printing. I haven't seen it yet,
however.

The documentation I have seen on this subject seems
inadequate and confusing to me, but perhaps mainly
because I am not familiar enough with it.
Nevertheless, I would appreciate advice on this
subject, especially from those who have succeeded at
printing under WINE. I have a number of Windows
applications that are useful on Linux, but they would
be even more so with printing capabilities.

Subject: [PLUG] undelete on a vfat filesystem?
Message-ID: <86r8ktprq8.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

Okay, here's a problem for you: how does one "undelete" files on a
mounted vfat filesystem under GNU/Linux?  I deleted the files from
GNU/Linux also, from a SmartMedia card, via a USB media reader,
mounted on /dev/sda1.  I have copies of the files, but I'd kind of
like to have the timestamps too, which I neglected to grab before.

Back in the dark ages, I used to have Norton (or god knows whose)
tools to undelete files from FAT files systems.  Is there such a thing
that runs under GNU/Linux?  Is there something somewhat reliable for
doing it manually?

Thanks!

Is there an easy way to parse an apache log file and automatically add
hosts running certain scripts to my /etc/hosts.deny file? I keep getting
enormous logs that look exactly alike and are really getting on my
nerves

It's coming from everybody on your cable network.  What I would do is allow your default gateway and whatever boxen
you want to access apache from your subnet, and then deny everything else from your subnet.

If its not ext2fs, you can always grep for the file, a la:

grep -a -B[size before] -A[size after] 'identifying string' /dev/sda1

I'm not sure if you can get the timestamps this way though. More info:
http://recover.sourceforge.net/unix/

Note: if you are using ext2, 'recover' is reliable, I think it even has a
gtk frontend now.

Don't forget to do a make oldconfig when you move the file back into
place. Especially if you are moving from one version to another so it
will pick up any new options that might be in the new version.

Also. The original email said the kernel version that was trying to be
built was 2.4.8... Why don't you pull down the latest since you're
building a custom kernel anyway. 2.4.18 is so much nicer than the 2.4
kernel when it was that young.

I ended up going to Salem because my father-in-law had Klez and his system 
was hosed.  While I was there I found out he also had W32 and some JS viruses.

the family friend who had set up the virus system did not set it up to download
new dat files.  My father-in-law also thought that it would do the virus scan even 
if the computer was turned off.

oh well.

Anyway if slides from last night are on-line, please post the URL.

You're not blind, getting to know a new place takes some time.

Yup, but I love every bit of it.  :)

Grew up on the north side of the city, and after college tried to find 
places that had trees and kept moving north until I was almost in 
Wisconsin.  And then finally gave up and moved somewhere I knew I'd get 
trees.  ;)

Do you know the Chicago area?

I don't think Apache can be compiled with libwrap (the library that

  I'm trying to rebuild the .src.rpm for openssl-0.9.6b. At the very end,
when it's cleaning up after iteself, it bails out with the following error:

+ rename so.0.9.6 so.0.9.6b /var/tmp/openssl-0.9.6b-root/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.6 /var/tmp/openssl-0.9.6b-root/lib/libssl.so.0.9.6
/var/tmp/rpm-tmp.35281: rename: command not found
error: Bad exit status from /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.35281 (%install)

RPM build errors:
    Bad exit status from /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.35281 (%install)

  Obviously, I do not have 'rename' on my RH 6.2 system; locate cannot find
it. A search of rpmfind for 'rename' turns up nothing. Checking what
binutils provides, I see no mention of 'rename'. Since it's not installed
here, using the rpm query option cannot tell me in which package it would be
found.

  I'd greatly appreciate a pointer to the package containing rename so I can
get past this sticking point.

Thanks,

I just set up a server yesterday, with samba configured to share home
directories.  As user derek, I was able to

smbmount //server/derek /home/derek/mnt -o username=derek

I am also able to mount shares from a Win2k server as derek.  Of course
this user has administrator privileges on the M$ server.

The problems I ran into where mostly related to who owns which
directories, you can't mount to something you don't own (I have a nasty
habit of creating directories as root, even in a users directory).

At this point in time, I have 3 different smbmounts (to 3 different
machines), all mounted by the user derek.

Did this happen for the root user?  Did you have something open, or cd'd
into mnt (though this should have been a resource busy error)?

kill -9 #pid# should take just about anything down.

Let me know if you want to see the smb.conf file for the box I set up
yesterday.

Kyle,
Thanks for the help. I'm trying to get the new update now.
I got an answer to my superblock problem on the redhat-list: I used "fsck /" and that prompted me to fix the superblock area for large files.

Seems like mv would do this job, how about creating a symlink called
rename (placed somewhere in your path, like /usr/local/bin) and point it
to mv?

Just another $0.02

yeah, this won't work.  The way rename works is it takes 
<what you want to change> <what to change it to> <list of files...>
so linking it to mv won't work

Derek,

  If you look at the wrapped lines you'll see that the rename command works
on multiple files rather than a single file. It would take multiple calls to
mv to do the same job.

Thanks,

And beware of the openssl package.  It uses the rename command without
a complete path.  If you have your own version of a rename command in
your path, it probably won't work as expected.  Guess who this happened to.

Subject: [PLUG] Help with 'talk'
Message-ID: <20020503182947.17115745B6@john.meissen.org>

This is driving me nuts, and I don't know what to look at or who to
complain to.....

My friends and I like to take advantage of the standard Unix 'talk'
application. They log into my system, type 'talk john', it gets my
attention and we chat away. It works great when we're (literally)
oceans apart and we need to communicate.

However, I was so far behind in security upgrades on my old Slackware
system I decided the best approach was to do a clean install of a recent
distribution. So I "upgraded" my systems to Mandrake 8.0, and then 8.1,
running kernel 2.4.8. (various patch levels).

Now 'talk' doesn't work anymore. Sort of.

It works fine between vc's. It works fine between vc's and pts'. It
works fine between pts' UNLESS one of them is associated with an
xterm-like application. I can initiate FROM an xterm and talk to a
pts associated with a console or telnet login. But I CAN'T initiate
from a console/telnet login to a pts associated with an xterm.

Yes, I know about 'mesg'.

<insert expression of extreme frustration here>

Any clues or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Here is a simple perl script for those lacking the "rename" command (i.e.
you're running a redhat older than 7)

  I know this is silly, but I'll do my best by considering it a learning
opportunity. Working my way back in the dependencies I need to upgrade or
install before I can build apache, I was pushed back to 'texinfo'. No big
deal, I thought. Well, when I try to rebuild the .src.rpm, this is what I
see:

  And I have no idea (again) what to do about it. bash-2.x is installed;
so's /bin/sh. I've no idea why these files aren't found. But, I'd sure like
to learn. I seem to be taking 5 steps back for each step forward I try.

Thanks,

By doesn't work, you mean it just hangs while waiting for an invitation on
the recipient's machine? or does it deny you permission to initiate the
request.

Are you using the old unix 'talk' or 'ytalk', which uses the same
framework as talk but permits multiple connections? If you're not using
ytalk you might want to install it and see if that solves the problem. (it
probably won't since they use they same daemons, but I know there issues
with talk vs. ytalk, ie from the ytalk info file:

	For any particular host, YTalk will
       attempt  to  communicate  with  a talk daemon the caller's
       host also supports.  If the two hosts have  no  daemon  in
       common,  then  UNIX  talk  will not function at all, but a
       connection is possible through (and only through) YTalk.

If you are using ytalk I think there are configuration
options in /etc/ytalkrc and .ytalkrc, you might want to play with those,
though I've no idea what to look for and how this relates to xterm. You
can always contact the project maintainer;
roger.espel.llima at pobox.com.

If multiple connections aren't important, you can always revert to
'write'. Its much less nice than talk but permits chatting, the only
caveat is that the other user must type 'write <you> <terminal>'
immediately after the first time you write them to make the session
interactive.

Another solution is to install 'irc' or something.

Hope this helps...

Shahms,

  Looks good, thank you very much. Do I put it any particular place? And, do
I have to rummage in the openssl.spec file to find where it's called so I
can change to the path and add the '.pl'?

Subject: [PLUG] Report: Updating from SuSE 7.2 to 8.0
Message-ID: <20020503190708.ISTS4412.rwcrmhc52.attbi.com@there>

I received my SuSE 8.0 update yesterday and thought I'd report my 
results from a dry run I did which entailed updating my backup 
workstation which was running SuSE 7.2. I saw some bad reports on 
Slashdot.org about configuration problems when trying to update from 
SuSE 7.x to 8.0 because the configuration setup has changed very 
drastically from prior versions of SuSE Linux.

A few things to note before I let YaST2 commence with the 
install/update:

1) I restored a very recent backup of my home directory from my primary 
workstation on this backup station so I could gauge how many problems I 
would have with the transition from KDE2 to KDE3.

2) YaST2 looks at all of the installed packages on the system and one 
thing I did was select to have all of the unmaintained packages removed 
from the system.

3) I only had one package that required manual intervention which was 
the "sudo" fix that came out not too long ago. I just had YaST2 
overwrite it and I can get new stuff later through the online update
feature in YaST2.

The install itself took quite some time as there were 501 packages to 
update on this system. The "sacrificial" system had the standard SuSE 
"Office" install on it so it's not surprising there were so many 
packages to update. My backup workstation is a PPro 200 which isn't 
really very fast unpacking all those RPMs so I just let it run and came 
back every so often to see if it was asking for a different CD or not.

It appears that the basic configuration stuff from 7.2 was carried over 
to the new scheme pretty well: X,  sound, and networking were all 
working. The only problem I had was that the two remote printers I had 
originally setup didn't work and YaST2 wouldn't let me touch them since 
it "thought" it hadn't created those printers. I created them through 
the text-based interface in YaST2 only a few days ago under 7.2. I just 
deleted the printers and created them again and my remote printers are 
now working. 

My real test was to fire up KDE3 and see what happens since I had a 
working KDE2 for more than a year now. KDE3 detected I had settings 
from KDE2 and I had it use those settings. KDE3 chugged along for a 
while and finally came up with the desktop. Things were mostly OK 
although there were a few problems:

1) I had lots of duplicate icons on the desktop for some reason which 
wasn't a serious problem. I just deleted the duplicates items from 
the desktop. 

2) I also happened to have one virtual desktop that had a "KDE2" 
background on it that didn't exist anymore so the background was white. 
I fixed this problem by running the KDE control center and changing the 
background for that desktop.

3) I did have a few problems with my session being restored when I 
logged in at first. To solve this problem I closed all of my apps and 
then logged out from KDE3. That appeared to wipe out any session 
information KDE was saving. Upon logging back in I started up my apps 
and then logged out again. The next time logged in my session was 
properly restored.

All of my bookmarks and mail client settings were intact in KDE3 which 
was probably my biggest concern with this upgrade. It's not a big deal 
changing/fixing basic Look+Feel stuff with the conversion but 
bookmarks, email and address book settings are much more work to setup 
again if they aren't carried over.

My only real gripe is that I'm not sure I really like the look of the 
anti-aliased fonts or not. They are turned on by default but I guess 
I'll run with them on for a while and see if I get used to them. I can 
always turn them off if I find I can't stand them.

Hopefully this information is helpful for anyone considering updating a 
SuSE 7.x system to 8.0. Fairly smooth update for the most part but 
there could be some problems with some configuration settings not being 
migrated over properly from SuSE's old configuration scheme. I only had 
a few problems but more compilicated systems may be more 
problimatic...YMMV. 

Now the real work beings when I actually update my primary workstation. 
Should be a quicker update since my primary workstation has a much 
faster CPU, CDROM, and hard drives.

  This in not intended to start a debate over which scripting language is
"best". Since so many basic utilities seem to be based on S-Lang I wonder
why it's not more commonly used as a scripting language.

  We find references to tcl, perl, python, ruby, scheme, guile, and so on.
But, there are apparently few advocates for S-Lang.

  Any of you old time *nix users have any insights on this?

Thanks,

Put it anywhere in your path, and mv it to just 'rename', dropping the .pl.

My problem occured because I had a different rename command ahead of the
rename command that the spec file wanted.  Because the spec file doesn't
use an explicit path, it found mine first instead of the one it wanted.
I just moved my rename comand to a different name to fix the problem.

Message-ID: <1020454277.3582.35.camel@traveller.home.com>

I installed Gentoo over the last few days and I thought I'd give a small
review.

First of all, check out the gentoo site: http://gentoo.org it's a very
nicely done.  Well organized.  Docs are clearly written.

I was interested in trying Gentoo because of an installation review I
read at Slashdot a few weeks back.  Gentoo seemed to offer another
alternative (the other being Debian) to RPM dependency hell.  It does
this by using the BSD portage system.  All packages are downloaded as
source and then compiled automatically. For example, if you want KDE you
simply type:
emerge kde

The emerge script then goes off and figures out which packages to
download, downloads them and compiles them in order of dependency. 
After it's done, you've got KDE.

Another advantage is that since you're compiling binaries from source
you get optimized binaries for your architecture ( = greater speed).
So, while it does take quite a lot longer to install gentoo than most
other distros, you'll generally get better performance especially on
newer processors.

I started by downloading the 16MB minimal install iso from the gentoo
site and burned it on a CDR.  I followed the x86 install instructions
from the Gentoo site.  I still have a dial-up connection, so this all
took a couple of DAYS. I also followed their desktop configuration
instructions but installed GNOME instead of KDE.  In both cases their
instructions were clear, accurate and seemed to be up to date. 
Alternatives were offered for many things - for example you could choose
your own logging package and three were offered (I went with metalog).

When all was finished I ended up with a couple of problems:
1) I couldn't su to root from a user account.  I found that I needed to
add the user to the 'wheel' group and all was well after that.
2) I installed on a laptop so I wanted APM (advanced power management)
to work, but it didn't work initially.  I found that I forgot to add
'apm' to the modules.autoload file.  All was well after doing that.

I've been installing a lot of apps using emerge in the last couple of
days (I'm typing this on Evolution on the gentoo'ed laptop) and it's all
worked flawlessly.

Bottom line:
1) You should have a fast connection to install Gentoo since it needs to
download pretty much everything (including the kernel sources- which you
have to configure and compile a kernel during the install)
2) It's not for newbies.  This is not a Mandrake or Lycoris install
(Lycoris would probably be at the opposite polarity from Gentoo - I've
installed it as well, and I think that pretty much ANYONE could install
it.  Lycoris actually brings up a Solitaire game as it installs.), but
if you're yearning for the old days when you had complete control over a
Linux install then you'll appreciate Gentoo.
3) It's kind of subjective, but I do think there is a noticeable
performance boost on my laptop (previously I had Mandrake 7.1 on it).
I'm sure it's partially due to the fact that gentoo didn't install a lot
of daemons I don't need and partially due to the optimized binaries.
4) The portage system is very nice and it's probably even a bit simpler
to use than Debian's apt.

I'd give it 4 out of 5 stars (****_ ;-)

  OK. I had moved it to /usr/lib/rpm but left the .pl on there. Then I
modified the spec file.
 
  Now I just saw this:

Use of uninitialized value at /usr/lib/rpm/rename.pl line 3.
/usr/lib/rpm/rename.pl <from> <to> <files...>
error: Bad exit status from /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.50130 (%install)

  So I have to go fix it and try again.

Just like fishing ... keep casting and hope that something bites.

  I don't see the source of the error, perl gurus.

  This is the line calling the 'rename' script:

/usr/lib/rpm/rename.pl so.%{solibbase} so.%{version} $RPM_BUILD_ROOT/lib/*.so.%{solibbase}

and here is the first few lines of the script that generates the error:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

if ( $ARGC < 3 ) {
        usage();
        exit(1);
}

  The error message cits the usage text:

sub usage
{
        print "$0 <from> <to> <files...>\n";
}

  Looks to me like three arguments. Could it be the globbing that causes the
problem?

Thanks,

Rich

All;

I use aterm in Window maker for my terminals. I like to use the Vi sequences when I am editing on the command line.

This works when I am in a virtual terminal thanks to a line in /etc/profile as follows:

  set -o vi

When I use 'aterm,' though, it's like the terminal completely spaces off /etc/profile.

The 'set -o vi' line in /etc/profile is totaly independent of any if statements, eg:

  if [[ $TERM = aterm ]]
   blow_off_profile_settings();
  fi

I don't recall $ARGC being automatically defined and filled in with perl...
because $ARGV[0] in perl is equivalent to argv[1] in C (if you call it that 
which you should, I guess)

is $ARGC defined as ++$#ARGV (or some other less sloppy construct)?

the if() conditional appears to be failing because of $ARGC, but I haven't 
seen the whole script so I can't be sure..

Yeah, you're right, I fudged the script, doh, but you can change $ARGC
to $#ARGV and it should work.

actually you may want to increment $#ARGV by 1, hence the ++$#ARGV
because of some perl-weirdness.  To make it clean, i would recommend adding 
the following line to the script  before the if() block:

$ARGC = ++$#ARGV;

you could also use:

$ARGC = ($#ARGV +1);

or:
$ARGC = length scalar @ARGV;

Arrays in perl are nifty things....

I may be completely wrong about this, but I believe that S-Lang is a
text mode UI library like ncurses, and not a scripting language itself.

The 'talk' client says:
 [Your party is refusing messages]

I turned on debugging, and the talkd daemon reports:

 find_request: ANNOUNCE: id 4294967295, l_user john, r_user john, r_tty pts/0
 process_request: ANNOUNCE <-- PERMISSION_DENIED, id 2

Unfortunately, this appears to be a catch-all for a number of problems
including if the open() call fails for any reason.

OK, now I'm going nuts. I'm sure I tried specifying the tty, because
I was changing permissions and ownership on some of devices and trying 
it. But now it works, if I specify the tty. :-( Guess I'll keep an eye 
on it and see if it's me or the system ;-)

One thing I have noticed.... with the older version(s) (from
Sun, Pyramid/Siemens, older Slackware, etc) it seemed to me that
the talk request was broadcast on each tty owned by you. This
version picks the first one it finds in utmp. If that one happens
to have 'mesg n' then the request fails regardless of the state of
any other tty's. Even if it's set right, you may never see the
request if the window is obscured.

Wonder if anyone is maintaining it these days?

I tried Gentoo a few months back and I couldn't get an install.  Went to
Sorcerer Gnu Linux and it worked well outa the box so to speak.  Then
that project fell apart.  I went to both of its branches and then just
got tired of the disorganisation there.  Still have SGL on one box. 
Went back to Gentoo and havn't looked back.  It is on my main server
doing ltsp and internal services.  Just recently put it on my laptop. 
It just works.  This 266 laptop is a bit slow to compile, but once
compiled it is a rocket. ;-)

These distros really teach one about the OS though.  From the ground up.
 I now have a really good handle on pcmcia and wireless cards.   If you
really want to learn Linux, I think these source distros are the way to
go.

And like you said, everything works flawlessly.  I never knew full
screen multimedia could be so seamless on a 600 mgz processor..

Have fun.

Couldn't you just build SSH from source?  Seems like a lot of these issues
would go away...  or maybe I'm missing something.

  That would fit. It's described as a scripting language on rpmfind. But, I
suppose as a TUI creator that would be just another way of explaining it.

Cooper,

The /etc/profile only gets read on login shells. You'll be hard pressed to
get it to run from X spawns. Actually, it's a common problem. You'll need to
place it in your $ENV file for it to fire each time the shell is forked. And
it doesn't work in .profile or .bash_profile either because like
/etc/profile, those only get parsed once per login.

Thus:

/home/longman
miswelux01> echo $ENV
/home/longman/.functions
/home/longman
miswelux01> cat .functions
alias ..="cd .."

function lx {
  ls -Cp $*
}

function by {
  clear
  exit
}

function ll {
  ls -l $*
}

function la {
  ls -la $*
}

set -o emacs
PS1='$PWD
$HOST> '
/home/longman
miswelux01> 

(I've switched from vi to emacs....-)

Doesn't $HOME/.bashrc get executed everytime you start a new bash shell?
Whether its a login shell or not? $HOME/.bash_profile would be for login 
shells, but .bashrc would be executed on startup....

No, .bashrc only runs in interactive shells that are not login shells. See
the bash man page for full details, especially the first several paragraphs
of the INVOCATION section.

ok, wouldn't this alleviate the issue of a non-login/interactive aterm bash 
shell?

Yes, that's exactly the place to put it...for bash. I use bash and ksh, so I
have to use the ENV scenario because most of my boxes use ksh, not bash. The
behaviour is the same in both shells.

Ah soo... I guess I've always "felt" this but you put it into tangible terms. Thanks.

This is where the knife cuts both directions. I need to use the ENV idiom of
the Korn shell to keep the carpal tunnel syndrome at bay, yet I use it to
set the emacs behaviour of bash (and Cisco IOS, and Cabletron and ....).

I hear ya, I used to use ksh all the time and i got hooked on the 'fc' 
function in bash.....but then as I started using more *BSD systems...I gave 
it all up for tcsh...

I wonder if there is a 'fc' for tcsh....hmmm

Hello,

Does anyone know of a decent predictive dialer system that can interface

My server stopped responding a while back and I was locked out of the box.
All services were gone.  Since I was unable to go to the box I had it
rebooted and all is fine.

What I would like to do now is find out why.

I have gone through all the log files I thought would tell me something
and the best I find is that right before it stopped responding someone was
getting mail.  pop3.

Is there some place other then messses/security/maillog/boot.log
that I could look that could help me understand why all services stopped?
I was told the power was on to the box but it wasn't responding.

Thanks.

Josh

P.S.  It is a RH 7.0 Machine if that helps. Kernel 2.2.19-7.0-12.  I know
there is an update to -16 but that will be this weekend.

  To close this thread, replacing *both* calls to rename in openssl.spec

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205040800400.30625-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  As a new user of postfix I don't know how to interpret the problems that
are showing up in /var/log/maillog. For some reason, postfix stopped working
last evening. This morning, /etc/rc.d/init.d/postfix restart killed both
instances of postfix/master, but the start failed. An explicit 'start'
command worked.

  Is there someone knowledgeable here to whom I could mail a copy of the
maillot for interpretation and assistance in fixing the problems it exposes?
There seem to be a number of postfix components that are now not working, or
not working properly. I fixed (I think!) a couple of regex typos in
header_checks and body_checks that I took from the web site. But, I see
errors writing to /var/log/procmail and a bunch of postfix errors including
several thousand notices that the processes was killed by a signal 11 (and,
occasionally, a signal 15).

Thanks,

Hello,

	I just looked at the output of top today and it says that I only have about 400k of free physical memory (no swap is being used).  Now, in and of itself that doesn't seem too weird, however, I have 128 MB RAM in the box and it isn't under any type of load.  Also, a couple of days ago, top said I have greater than 20 MB of physical memory free.  And nothing has changed on the box between then and now.  So, I was wondering if there is a way to get a break down of all the memory being used in the system.  Something that would tell me exactly how much memory each process is using.  Also, I don't run X on the box, so a console based utility is essential.  Thanks for any bright ideas.

If you look at the other things that "top" shows you, you'll see that 
besides processes using physical memory, Linux itself uses some of 
physical memory for buffers and filesystem cache. I guess I really 
wouldn't be worried unless your system is thrashing the hard drive 
swapping pages in and out of the system swap space(s).

If you do have processe(s) that may be leaking memory, press the "M" 
key when "top" is running so it sorts all processes by their memory 
usage. The process that is using the most memory will be on the top of 
the list. You can take a few notes and observe over time how much 
memory any suspect processes are using.

Linux doesn't attempt to free up memory until it's needed
by some other process, so having lots of memory in use
is good, not bad.

Tools:  top (like you are using), cat /proc/meminfo,
	cat /proc/slabinfo, Als-SysRq-M (if enabled)

Also, for each process, /proc/<process_number/statm prints:
		       size, resident, share, trs, lrs, drs, dt
where:
	size = number of total pages
	resident = number of resident pages
	share = number shared
	trs = number of text (code) pages
	lrs = number of library pages
	drs = number of stack/data pages
	dt = number dirty

And you can use 'h' in top to see how to
customize its field output, then use 'f' or 'F' to add or
delete fields (columns).

There's also 'vmstat', but it doesn't help very much on a
per-process basis.

My belief -- which may or may not be correct! -- is that the way Linux works, the system will try to load as much of the 600MB or so of the distro (whatever the size happens to be) as it can into memory based on some algorythm that tries to predict which tools, apps, etc. it thinks you might use next.  So if you were to bump your ram up to 256, you'd still see that most of it is "not free,"  but that as you begin running applications, Linux will begin removing certain tools, apps, etc. from memory to make room for the things you are firing up.

Subject: [PLUG] Hard drive benchmarking for Linux?
Message-ID: <20020504170241.C2122@sparky>

So a friend told me to add the following bit to my grub.conf file to 
"enable" ATA66 or ATA100 speeds on my ATA100 drives:

ide0=ata66

Apparently "ata66" is sufficient to get even ata100 speeds, as I 
understand this parameter.

1)  Is passing this arg to the kernel truly necessary for the drive to 
operate at ATA100 speeds?

2)  Can anyone recommend a good disk throughput benchmarking utility so 
that I can test with & without?  I am probably imagining it, but it 
actually seems slower when I use the parameter than without.

To further complicate things, I have a Highpoint 370 ATA100 RAID 
controller onboard (had to specially compile that support into my 
kernel).  Any special considerations regarding #1 above?

Thanks!

I have a client with a dell server that does the same.  It is because
these guys keep the machine running 98% on both procs 24/7.  It has to
finally die.  By that point all logging is stopped.  The best I can do
is keep top running 24/7 from home and show them the screenshot when it
dies.  We are upgrading the box so hopeflly the problem will go away
too.   It took about three screenshots of top to finally convince them
it was working too hard.   This box is still up too, just no services
work including keyboard attached.  I showed them the nice command and it
seems to be well for the moment.  Are you working yours too hard too?

The ATA driver (according to its comments, if they can be
trusted, which is debatable) uses this "ata66" parameter for
what it calls "quirky" chipsets that are ATA-66 compliant but
the driver [developer] can't find a method to determine
the presence of an 80-pin cable.  (It also should be max.
15" [or 18" ???] long.  Longer is often a problem.)
For lots of chipsets, the driver can determine this information
without needing the ata66 parameter.

For ATA drives (not SCSI), use 'hdparm'.  man hdparm

There's lot of ata66 and ata100 code in
linux/drivers/ide/hpt366.c (which handles the HPT 370).
I don't know the answer to your question offhand and can't
look it up right now.  Sorry about that.

There are also lists of drives that have problems with
ATA66 or ATA100 in hpt366.c (blacklisted drives),
so the driver may not support higher speeds with all
drives.

You should take a look at the output from the "free" command:

# free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        387740     287252     100488      44888     194432      37244
-/+ buffers/cache:      55576     332164
Swap:       102308          0     102308

You see in the first row, the above shows 100488 free (appx. 100 Megabytes)
but the actual free RAM is what is shown in the second row under free,
332164 (332 Megabytes) this is the amount of memory available if Linux
discounts the amount of space it is using for caching data from disk (not
just programs, any data).

Linux uses all available free memory as disk cache, so if you have 200 Meg
free, over time this will all get filled with data from various accesses
to the disk.  Whenever this memory is needed to load a program, Linux will
simply free some of this cache memory and use it to load your program
while retaining the rest of the cache so that it doesn't need to go to the
disk for the data that it still has room to keep in memory.

How does putting a full load on your cpu endanger the system? Do you
mean the hardware will physically degrade from too much use, or do the
additional context switches and io bring out operating system bugs to
cause race conditions and so forth?

Don't ask me.  Like I said there is nothing in the log files.  The
machine runs months on end as long as the cpu utilization stays below
90% most of the time.  a 24 hour period above 95% constantly and it
dies.  Top always shows 99% on both when it flakes.  At first I
suspected the percraid card. and it still may be, but the box has no
raid being used.  mem is not all used and swap is not usually being
used, so it is not a mem leak.  I kinda suspect the dell server just
won't deal with it.  I have never thought Dell made good servers.  That
was backed up by a visit to dell in which I was shown that Dell itself
runs on Compaq and Sun servers.  ROFLMAO.

Have fun.

"hdparm -tT /dev/hda" will do a test on your drive.  You'll get different
results if you have an IO load on your machine.  You can also change some
settings with hdparm.  Mandrake used to use hdparm as an initscript when
you booted if you selected the "Use hard drive optimizations" install
option.

A good hdparm optimization line looks like this: "/sbin/hdparm -c1 -d1
-m16 /dev/hda"  Your mileage may vary.

severe as to keep my users down to 50 or less, and
kill active chat clients.  can anyone help me with

Clock skew means the clock on the nfs server is different from the
clock on the local machine. It can be detected if the results of the
make have a date/time significantly different from the local machine,
say, in the future.

To fix it set the clocks the same. Run ntpdate periodically, or run
NTP on your machines.

  I think it means I really need to install ntp because the clocks on the
workstations are not synchronized.

  Kludge (until above is done): build logged into the other workstation, not
across the nfs mounted filesystem.

  This is getting rediculous. I try rebuilding the ntp-4.1.0-4.src.rpm and
it tells me I need libcap-devel-1.10.0 or greater. So, I grab the .src.rpm
for that and try to build it. But, it fails with this error:

Processing files: libcap-devel-1.10-5
error: File not found by glob: /var/tmp/libcap-1.10-root/usr/man/man2/*
error: File not found by glob: /var/tmp/libcap-1.10-root/usr/man/man3/*
Requires: libcap = 1.10-5


RPM build errors:
    File not found by glob: /var/tmp/libcap-1.10-root/usr/man/man2/*
    File not found by glob: /var/tmp/libcap-1.10-root/usr/man/man3/*

  Now, it seems to me that the man2 and man3 directories should be created
by the package. They're not there. There is no man/ directory.

  Does this mean I hae a corrupted package? The file size appears correct.
All of a sudden I'm getting errors rebuilding packages. Doesn't make a lot
of sense to me.

Thoughts welcome,

I don't think the computer is being used that hard.  It is mostly a
webserver and email server for a variety of people.  But the CPU usage is
very small.  Only durning a few high times does it go up.  Or when I"m
compiling. :-)

But I have now setup up netsaint on my other linux box to monitor the
server with the problem.  I did this so I could see what is happening and
if the server goes down.

So, if I don't see anything in the logs I will have a problem starting to
figure it out?  I has ran fine for over a year.  It is a 2.2 kernal and
may go to the 2.4 for other reason.  Don't see how that would affect it.
I have most updates on all my programs so feel good there.

Maybe it got too hot.  I don't know.  Does linux have a CPU temp. gague?

Rich,

Have you tried creating the directory structure?
/var/tmp/libcap-1.10-root/usr/man/man2 and
/var/tmp/libcap-1.10-root/usr/man/man3

Then rerunning your make.

About timing.  We discovered at work that if the system clock and the
hardware clock were out of synch, ssh would work intermittently.

You could set up your salmo as your ntp server for you workstations.  Have
it go to some standard places.
server  bogart.cse.ogi.edu
server  caesar.cs.wisc.edu
server  cs.wisc.edu

Then have your workstations have
peer salmo.appl-ecosys.com

Use hwclock to synchronize your system clock to your hardware clock:
/sbin/hwclock --systohc --localtime
The localtime option ensures that hardware clock is localtime and not UTC.

lm-sensors will do this. If lm-sensors is already set up, gkrellm
should detect it and display the information. If you don't use gkrellm
there are other frontends for it, ie:

$ apt-cache search lm-sensors
i2c-source - sources for drivers for the i2c bus
ksensors - lm-sensors frontend for KDE
libsensors-dev - Lm-sensors development kit
libsensors1 - Library to read temperature/voltage/fan sensors
lm-sensors - Utilities to read temperature/voltage/fan sensors
lm-sensors-source - Kernel drivers to read temperature/voltage/fan sensors
(source)
sensord - Hardware sensor information logging daemon
wmsensors - WindowMaker dock applet for lmsensors

Subject: [PLUG] Why do some services not start?
Message-ID: <1020643463.11056.243.camel@lana.manymoons.net>

I have a standard RH7.2 system with the usual culprits in my /etc/init.d
file.  However, upon startup at least three of the script fail to
execute but run fine when started manually as root.  The scripts are for
httpd, named, and ntpd.  There may be others, but I am not sure.  Some
scripts in this directory do run upon startup, so I know that the
directory is not the problem.

Does anyone know what causes this and how to correct it?

Do any of these sensor daemons allow you do set them up so in the case 
of a high temperature a log entry is made to the syslog and then the 
system is shutdown to protect against any damage. This would be really 
useful in the event of a fan failure and a subsequent overheat 
condition.

Since all of the sensor stuff can be gotten as text data from the 
"/proc/sys/dev/sensors" directory, I've toyed with both a shell script 
and C program which monitors the temperature values by polling at a 
specified interval. I know some of the vendors refuse to release any 
specs for their monitor hardware and so the lm_sensors team can only do 
a "best effort" on getting some of these values. I don't like 
reinventing the wheel and so if there's some sort of monitoring daemon 
that can handle an automatic shutdown on an fan and/or overheat failure 
I would be interested.

What runlevel are you running?

(Type runlevel at a prompt to find out)

Is there a link to the scripts that don't run in the /etc/rc#.d directory, 
where # is the runlevel you are running at?

If not, the links need to be created.

Run ntsysv on a redhat or redhat-alike system and make sure those services 
have an asterisk by them.

The "sensord" package does some of that:

 "This package contains a daemon that logs hardware health status to the
 system log with optional warnings on potential system problems."

Maybe it has an option which will also shut the system down, or this
could be configured manually. Sounds like a cool idea; but if there was a
bug, the system might keep shutting itself down, and this might prove
difficult to fix. :)

Description: Hardware sensor information logging daemon
 Lm-sensors is a hardware health monitoring package for Linux. It allows you
 to access information from temperature, voltage, and fan speed sensors. It
 works with most newer systems.
 .
 This package contains a daemon that logs hardware health status to the
 system log with optional warnings on potential system problems.
 .
 You will need lm-sensors and i2c kernel modules to use this package.

Russ, you get the big star :)

The files has links in the rc#.d directory, but they did not have
astericks in ntsysv.  I changed that and it worked as I wanted.

Now the question: what exactly does netsysv do?  Does it changed a
particular file or files and if so, which ones?

On systems that use sysv type startup scripts, it creates the proper links 
to the start up scripts in /etc/init.d.

As far as I know, it doesn't do much else.

My 166MMX is happily running Mandrake Security.  It has been a long time since 
it has run anything else.  I would like to hear from anyone with personal 
experience running a new distro on an old Pentium.  Is KDE 3.0 going to be 
possible?  Anyone like any lighter desktop?  I would particularly like to 
hear from people who use both a modern machine and an older one.  I remember 
being fairly well satisfied with SuSE 6.4 on the box, but after using a 600 
for a while that 166 has become painful.

Mainly I'm interested in browsers, email and basic document handling, but the 
key is mom and dad level ease of use and reliability, so pine and lynx won't 
cut it.  Before I blow my firewall's uptime by testing a bunch of configs and 
distros with it, I thought someone here might have some experience and point 
me in the right direction.  By the way, Spanish language support would be 
nice.

Thank you,

I don't know if you saw my earlier post but I did a test update of a 
SuSE 7.2 system to SuSE 8.0 on a Pentium Pro 200 system with 128MB of 
memory. I'm not sure I would recommend trying to use KDE3 on a 166 
system. I found KDE3 very slow starting up on the PPro 200 system. My 
primary workstation is a 900MHZ Athlon and so I guess I'm used to 
better performance now and have forgotten how slow that PPro 200 system 
is when I used it as my primary workstation.

If you stick to a light weight window manager it is certainly possible 
to run an X-based Linux system on rather meager hardware. I used to run 
Slackware on a 486/33 with 32MB of memory. I used the OpenLook Virtual 
Window Manager "olvwm" and the system had sufficient resources to run 
both Netscape and XEmacs simultaneously and performance wasn't real 
bad. It did take some time to load those large apps but once they were 
running performance was quite acceptable.

YMMV,

Tony

The ROX desktop might be appropriate for this. It has very little overhead
and the file manager is easy to use. It's very attractive and unique as
far as desktops go.

http://rox.sourceforge.net/

You could also try running a light window manager: ctwm, fvwm2, afterstep,
blackbox, maybe sawfish, on its own without a desktop (my preference) or
alongside ROX. ROX also supports most of the European languages (spanish
included) as well as english.

With respect to the distribution, something like gentoo might be most
efficient, although I imagine any distro would be efficient if you
compiled selectively. Debian or redhat would work.

I run debian potato on a pentium-90 with 40 Mbs and I don't notice any
performance difference between it and woody on my faster system
(Celeron800 w/128 mbs) for most tasks.

> Mainly I'm interested in browsers, email and basic document handling, but the

The browser is the area where you'll notice differences with respect to
performance. Its hard to find an efficient browser that supports the
latest stylesheets and such. Galeon is nice but its really only
lightweight if you're already running Gnome. You might want to try
SkipStone, a pure gtk+ browser:

http://www.muhri.net/skipstone/

I don't know what graphical email clients/word processors are appropriate
for this system, but I'm sure they're around. Its amazing how much mileage
you can get out of old hardware via linux. :) I could almost give up my
faster desktop system for the pentium-90 and be okay, except for watching
movies.

It works well for a single database (or multiple databases with the same

One project you may want to check out is RULE -- Run Up-to-date Linux
Everywhere. You can read about it at:

http://www.rule-project.org/rule/

The folks have been hacking out a couple of utilities -- miniconda & slinky --
that allow you to install the latest RH distro on machines with limited
memory or hard drive space.

I've been using it to install RH 7.2 on my old 486 with 16MB of memory, &
the install went smoothly (although very slowly -- it took about 4 hours to
load a basic configuration). Slinky 0.2.1 also allows you to install the
basic X rpms, & to select between ext2 & ext3 filesystems. (ext3 is overkill
for the small, <=1GB hard drives on older machines.)

I haven't played around with finding out how well slinky works with Mandrake;
maybe after I have finished mucking around with the current image, & am
ready to test the latest slinky release.

This leaked letter to Microsoft from a Peruvian congressman who's
sponsoring a bill mandating the use of free software in Peru's public 
sector made my morning.

  http://www.theregus.com/content/4/24858.html

The context is that a Microsoft rep. sent the congressman a letter 
supposedly detailing the dangers of mandating free software. Some of 
the best bits in the reply deal with point 4 in the Microsoft letter:

  Your letter continues: "4. The bill imposes the use of open source 
  software without considering the dangers that this can bring from 
  the point of view of security, guarantee, and possible violation of
  the intellectual property rights of third parties." ....

  In respect of the guarantee:

  As you know perfectly well, or could find out by reading the "End 
  User License Agreement" of the products you license, in the great
  majority of cases the guarantees are limited to replacement of the
  storage medium in case of defects, but in no case is compensation
  given for direct or indirect damages, loss of profits, etc....

  On Intellectual Property:

  ...The inclusion of the intellectual property of others in works
  claimed as one's own is not a practice that has been noted in the
  free software community; whereas, unfortunately, it has been in the
  area of proprietry software. As an example, the condemnation by the
  Commercial Court of Nanterre, France, on 27th September 2001 of
  Microsoft Corp. to a penalty of 3 million francs in damages and
  interest, for violation of intellectual property (piracy, to use the
  unfortunate term that your firm commonly uses in its publicity).

In general, however, the whole thing is great. Long, but great.

Dear Dr. Nunez -

I just wanted to express my admiration for your legislative activities
with regard to Free Software. Your presentation of the technical and economic
issues surrounding software and licensure are firm and insightful [1]. In
this response, I also enjoyed the acuity with which you separated
unrelated but commonly confused issues.

I have to agree with comments that: "The letter... is by far one of
the most informed, logical arguments for "free" software I've ever seen."
and "I wish our government believed in democracy as much as Peru." [2]

If you find time to visit the United States I would enjoy hearing you
speak on this subject. Your statements will guide legislators elsewhere in
passing similar laws.

I read the letter and I think it must be a hoax, or perhaps an AI.  This guy 
has an awesome command of the issues and the letter is just brilliantly 
written. Can you imagine Blumenthal writing a letter like that? Or maybe a 
Peruvian Congressman is equivalent to a US Senator, but then I can't see 
Wyden or Smith writing a letter like this either.  Thanks for the heads up, 
after it gets slashdotted we won't be able to access the site.

I'm running KDE 2.2.2 on my laptop, which is a P90 w/40MB memory.
It's a little slow, but it runs.  Konqueror is pretty good on it.
(I run KDE because it has a nice low-color theme, that doesn't
waste precious color slots on the 8-bit display.)

Message-ID: <200205061627.g46GRct26766@smtp.easystreet.com>

So I've got DSL from Qwest running on a Windows machine and I'd like to 
switch, slowly and carefully, to floppyfw.

The way I understand it, DSL is like a lan and the modem provides a telco 
connection on one side an a lan connection on the other. 

What would happen if I took out the windows cable and put in one from a  
linux machine?  On a lan it would eventually adapt to the new MAC. What 
happens in the DSL context?

What if I have a dual boot and I start the DSL connection under Windows, and 
reboot to floppyfw.  Would that work?

Don't know of any ways to do this within the .my.cnf file, but
you could create multiple .my.cnf-dbaseN files, and then use
a wrapper script which does something like:

  #!/bin/sh
  if [ "$1" ]
  then
    MYCNF="$HOME/.my.cnf-$1"
  else
    MYCNF="$HOME/.my.cnf"
  fi
  mysql --defaults-file=$MYCNF $*

I've got an older fujitsu laptop with Pentium MMX 200 chip and 96 MB RAM (all it
will take).  I have no problem running the helix stuff and mozilla.

I think the trick is to cram as much RAM as you can into the box.  Linux will
work on slower processors, but there's no substitute for RAM.

Another trick is to apply the preemtive kernel patch.  I'm running it now on the
laptop, and I'm very pleased with it.

I think the best resource you can have is the linux laptop howto.  It's got a ton
of tips on running linux on small, resource-limited machines.

Depends. Many DSL services use DHCP to assign your IP and/or require that
you run a PPPoE client to make the connection.  At a minimum, you might
need to release/renew an IP from the DSL provider's DHCP.  I would expect
you might also need to re-connect with the PPPoE client.  Requirements can
vary, even within Qwest's DSL services.

Though I can't say I've actually tried.  :-)

It probably won't maintain the same session, if that's what you're asking.
 But you could launch the PPPoE connection during the startup phase of each
boot, which might produce the outcome you're looking for.

Ok, there are 2 types of DSL: ppp over ethernet (PPPOE) and bridging.

In bridging, you have a "real" IP address and you just connect via your cisco
router.  Basically, the telephone line handles the physical layer of your
connection.  No problem since this is looking exactly like a normal LAN.  You
can disconnect your box, put a firewall in between your internal LAN and the
world, tell the firewall that it's got your IP address and gateway, and then
turn on NAT for the internal LAN.

With PPPOE, there is a ppp connection made via the ethernet link.  That way,
the ISP can make you verify your username and password.  That's why they like
it... from their point of view, it's easier to manage.  Unfortunately, most
ISP's use this.  There is software for PPPOE on linux, but I've never played
with it.  The physical setup is the same as for bridging mode, but you still
have to negotiate the ppp link, and that's where the problem is.

The easiest/best way is to just pick an ISP that lets you do bridging.  Failing
that, it's off to a web search for "PPPOE DSL linux".

There are probably a few different factors at work here...  Now, as I don't 
recall the specifics of your posts, I'm making generalizations.

Some people might have your free email host (yahoo.com) blocked in their 
spam-protection scripts.  Not anything against you personally, but a LOT of 
spam DOES come from yahoo.

Your post could have been vague.  The more specific, the better.  You'll often 
see people asking for log files rather than a description of the problem.  The 
less questions *WE* have to ask to get to the root of *YOUR* problem, the 
easier it is in the long run for all of us.

Your post might have simply come at the wrong time.  I know sometimes people 
are in different "help" moods, and depending on the state of that mood, they 
can reply or not.  Try again, make sure you're more specific in your query, 
and see what happens.

Most of all, around here - patience is a virtue.

Hope that helps,

-Richard

Although I haven't had a chance to fully read all the links, ROX, RULE and the

Message-ID: <3CD6C29E.4546222@yahoo.com>

The preemptive patch works as follows:

Normally multitasking is done by time slicing.  Processes wait in a que and are
dealth with in order (generally).  What the preemptive kernel patch does is if a
process needs attention right now, it sends a little preempt (like a hangup
signal) and the kernel attends to its needs.

It's like Joe at home with his Significant Other (SO).  Joe has all the things
that he needs to do for himself, such as reading the perl documentation and
building his relational database on his personal mysql server.  So he's working
away.  His SO needs the trash taken out.  She sends a preempt, making Joe quit
working immediately so that he can take out the trash.  Joe takes out the trash.
Joe then returns to processing his own job que as he sees fit.

The cool part about it is that the processes that usually send the preempts are
either processes that are part of user interaction (mouse and keyboard drivers)
or IO activities (buffering MP3's to play so they don't skip).  You get a small
speed increase usually with the preemptive kernel, but your MP3's don't skip, and
your mouse is more responsive.

The patch has been folded into the 2.5 series of kernels so in the future you
won't need to patch.

A little OT but as long as we're asking for CD's, does anyone have a working
copy of Solaris 9 Sparc edition?  I am not having any luck getting it to
burn in a way that my Ultra 10's will read.  I have my own license and
everything from Sun I just need media for testing.  I will of course offer
the same double CDR's deal Dragos is offering.

send you 4 blank.

Last I looked there are 5 iso images?   And in 7.3 bata it
took 3 cds to install.  Only 2 programs on the 3rd cd.  I
have had some problems with RH 7.3 bata:
1. Installed OK then run up2date.  Most of the programs
    stooped working correctly?
2. Installed it a second time. I thought the same way as the
    first time but some of the programs where different (not
    there or did not work, mainly for novel connections and
    printing?)

Decided to wait until the production version was released.

 Thanks to both guys. I should have mentioned that I run in bridged mode

The Windows version uses a program to manage the Cisco 678, so I thought 
maybe it might need one under Linux. So if I want to run floppyfw all I have 
to do is plug it in? And boot.

You can connect to the cisco router via a rj45<->serial cable that should have
come with it.  Use minicom to connect to the serial port.  I think it's 9600
8N1, but the bitrate might be different.  Then you're talking directly to the
CBOS.  Check online for a reference for CBOS commands.  The cisco will do some
crazy stuff--builtin NAT, tftp server.

I always heard that when you got a Bachelor of Science degree is when
you got your degree in BS. The MS degree was More of the Same, and the
Ph.D. was Piled Higher and Deeper.

Nope.  Sorry.  I haven't been on DSL for about 9 months, so I can't help there.

When you are ready to run the script supplied as an argument, It should look like this:

  . $config <-- Note the period

A dot script is a script that runs in the parent's environment. In other words, unlike a regular script, a dot script is *not* a child of the caller. The dot script inherits all of the caller's environment, including variables that haven't been exported.

It's very limited in its capabilities.  I think it can have
a maximum of 10 rules, with no stateful inspection, no special
protocol handling in NAT, etc.

I thought linux did that already.  Perhaps I am confusing something else.  I 
thought I read something about preemptive multitasking vs cooperative 
multitasking with respect to Macs.  Don't Macintosh and Windows operating 
systems currently support pre-emptive multitasking?

Is 2.4.x cooperative multitasking?

Is there more to this?

I've been bragging about this feature for over a year now, and your telling me 
I've been full of sh*t?  Crap!  I'm going to get a ribbing over this.  My Mac 
addicted friend (ironically named Joe) will find out that I really don't know 
what I'm talking about.  My faked "savvy user" status will evaporate!   :-o

At any rate, this sounds like a feature I want.  Thanks again for the tip.

In most situations dsl is just as described.  a lan on
one end, telco on the other.  there are many types of
dsl provisioning, tho, and some provisioning is done
at the noc and contains info like the mac address of
the adapter on the other side of the cpe.  if the noc
keeps this record, you will either need to have them
switch it, or use the same nic.  other cpe's keep a
flash ram record of the mac addy, and need a power
cycle sometimes up to 3 minutes to forget that info. 
yet others dont care at all.  just hook up and go.  I
dont know about the cisco on qwest, but I think it

let me know if this helps.

Anyone read this?

http://slashdot.org/articles/02/05/06/1739244.shtml?tid=109

Could this be the template for an initiative in our fair state to help the 
state cut costs and lock-in and prevent audit threats?

I believe he said that he was connected via bridging mode in another message.

Bill, AFAIK, in bridging mode none of the 678 features like NAT are available.
It is as if you had an ethernet cable running all the way from your ISP to
your house.  Did you also say that you have a static IP?

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20020506121734.00aae040@mail.netsailer2.com>

As a newbie, can somebody tell me if can and or where to find HOW TO's for 
the following scenario.

hardware;
P200 mhz
up-to 196mb EDO Ram
CD-Rom
floppy
modem
nic
2mb video +/-

What I want;		bottom line I want to be my own ISP.

To dial in from remote location's to my home office and have the system 
route me out through my LAN and over my DSL  line.
I am assuming that I will be able to do this with an office frame 
connection also.

I am a little short on small hard drives, but i have a couple of old P200 & 
P133 sitting around doing nothing.

3Com has a little device that will do this with a 4 port hub, for about 
$250 retail. But who really needs to spend the money :)

I've been told by a Novell guy that Novell should have GroupWise
available for Linux.  I've found a press release indicating that
it would be available for Linux and Solaris, but the GroupWise 6
site lists only NetWare and NT.  Anyone keep up with these things?

Yes, that's correct.  The IP features aren't available in bridging
mode, because the packets never make it that high in the networking
stack.

Well, Linux is pre-emptive in running user programs (as UNIX has
been for a very long time), but not in the kernel portion of things.
What the pre-empt patch does is allow the kernel to prempt itself
at times, particularly while in device drivers that may be "slow"
to respond or complete their operations.  Some of the kernel guys
could give you a more precise explanation; there's also an article
in the latest LJ, I believe.

Yea the auto shutdown thing needs to be tested very well before turning 
it loose on a critical system. Even with my own little programs I wrote 
I saw a case where once in while the /proc/sys/dev/sensors would report 
a high temperature at one time and then the next time the temperature 
was checked it was OK. 

I had to change my monitor to detect 3 high temperatures before it would 
go off. I'm always a bit suspicious since I have a Asus A7V133 mobo 
with the AS99127F chip. Asus won't release any specs on the thing and 
so it's a "best effort" on these values. I've compared what I get from 
the "sensors" program with what the CMOS setup shows me and the values 
are very similar. The CPU temperature in the CMOS shows about a 2 
degree Celsius difference from what "sensors" reports. That pretty 
close IMHO.

Last I checked, Solaris 9 was Sparq only. They were considering an Intel 
port due to overwhelming demand, but no Intel port had been created.

Solaris 8 is/was to be the last version that provided an Intel version.

There is no Intel version yet.  There is some documentation starting to pop
up though so it looks like there are some plans for it, but it is not yet
announced.  I would like to get ahold of those discs though.  What else
would take for a copy?

Don,
  Thanks for the solution, that works well enough for my purposes - I
was just hoping that mysql supported a less hackish way to do it.

thanks,

During my lunch break at work I read my mail using Pine and SSH to my
server.  i have never clicked on a URL in Pine because I did not know how
it would work.  Well today I did and it started Netscape real slow.  i
suspected that it was running from my server via SSH but I'm not sure.  I
tested my companies M$ web mail address using the external URL and it
worked.

When I'm using SSH remotely and start a browser from Pine is the
connection secure?

Actually, in newer versions of ntsysv (RH 7.x era) it also manages
services for xinetd as well.

Yup.  That's likely what happened.

It's secure between you and your home machine, but not necessarily secure
between your home machine and the rest of the world.

If Netscape was running VERY slowly, scren updates taking a long time
etc, I believe it was running on your home box - and all your X
connections should've been forwarded through the SSH connection, making
all netscape interaction from your work desktop to your home machine
secure from packet sniffing as well.

Cooperative multitasking means that the OS gives control to an app and waits
for the app to give it back, then gives control to the next app.  Preemtive
multitasking means the OS gives the app control (lets it execute code) for a
set amount of time then takes control away.  The advantage is that if an app
is "bad" and keeps control, the machine locks up and has to be rebooted.  Or
if one app keeps control for a long time, other apps just have to wait.

I don't think that it can be done within the my.conf file. As far as I
know you can only do it throught the mysql db

I'm not Jeme, but I know where to look. :)


Here's an excellent starting point for sound/audio apps.

http://www.bright.net/~dlphilp/linuxsound/

There is a "music notation" category, stuffed full.

Rosegarden is one of the more well known, but there are lots of others.

I have an old laser printer that, after serving me faithfully for 10
years, has finally failed mechanically. The cost to repair way 
exceeds the cost for a new one.

Being somewhat  conscientious I would like to dispose of it in an
environmentally responsible way.

Any suggestions?

Thanks, Jeremy. It's just what I had in mind, a place to start with a

  For too many it stands for Piled Higher and Deeper. For the rest of us

Again thanks  to all.
I have static IP, bridged mode. So we can forget about using 678 as firewall.
I think what'll do is make the Windows machine the DSL is connected to into a 
dual boot: Windows and floppyfw.  That way if I have trouble, I can get back 
on the net without moving nics.  This way it'll be the same MAC, and I may 
not have to deal with ISP reboots, or whatever they do.  Once I get 
everything working, I've  got an old Pentium, I can use.

This is a shot in the dark, but maybe there's a guru hiding here that can
answer this.

I have a custom 64 bit wide PCI card installed in a 64 bit slot.  The card has 
an 8 MB prefetchable memory window available via BAR 0.  Memory accesses work 
(/dev/mem and mmap), but I'm not seeing 64 bit wide transfers (req64, ack64 
aren't toggling).  How can I get the host/northbridge to generate 64 bit wide 
transfers?

thanks,

I am not exactly sure how this works, I've never (or so long ago that
I forgot) investigated, but if I have a Mozilla running locally and I
click on a URL in a ssh-piped emacs running on a remote host, the URL
gets forwarded to my local host's Mozilla and it loads locally.  Works
a lot faster than loading and fowarding the display of a remote
Mozilla.  I know it isn't specific to Mozilla because it worked on
Netscape and maybe even Mosaic before that.

  I must have accidently removed a library that WordPerfect/8 needs because
it will not load today. What's interesting is that the splash screen comes
up, the process list shows

18233 ttyp1    R     13:08 /usr1/wp8/wpbin/xwp

but the program doesn't finish loading.

  I tried running it through /usr/bin/strace, but it scrolled off the
screen. Trial-and-error hasn't lead me to the proper syntax to send the
output to a file for examination.

  Here's where it's hanging:

times({tms_utime=30, tms_stime=116, tms_cutime=0, tms_cstime=0}) = -2136175216
times({tms_utime=30, tms_stime=116, tms_cutime=0, tms_cstime=0}) = -2136175216
times({tms_utime=30, tms_stime=116, tms_cutime=0, tms_cstime=0}) = -2136175216

  Of course, this has been running a few seconds.

  Can anyone suggest how I can determine what I broke so I can fix it? I
have project and administrative documents in WordPerfect that I must get out
tomorrow.

Many thanks,

Galen,

  This is Oregon where bridge designs are 50 years out of date. Your
data bridge has a weight restriction on it place by ODOT. You have to take a
detour or carry only 32 bit packets until there is sufficient money to fix
the problem.

  Follow up: I found the redirection command I needed in my bash book. Now I
have output in a file. Is there someone knowledgeable here to whom I can
e-mail the file for examination? I find one reference to:

stat("/etc/ld.so.preload", 0xbffff840)  = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

but I don't know if this is the problem.

  Over the weekend, I installed openssl and updated both libssl* and
libcrypto*. I then ran /usr/sbin/ldconfig. Since I was doing all this stuff,
WP8 decided to not work properly.

Thanks,

Rich

My guess is that when you ran ldconfig, it forgot the location of some necessary shared libraries for word perfect.  What those libraries are? Can't help you there.  But that might be a starting place.

John,

  I don't understand how this could happen, but looking at the log file I
see references to libraries in /opt/qt/lib/ that aren't there. I didn't even
know that WP depended on qt libraries! And, to make the mystery deeper,
/opt/qt/lib/ is not listed in /etc/ld.so.conf and never has been.

  Strange, eh?

John,

  I found the source of the problem, but I'm not yet sure how to fix it.
Reading the strace output log really helps!

  When I installed postfix it insisted on a fully qualified host name, so I
ran hostname and changed the box from salmo to salmo.appl-ecosys.com. That
broke something else, too.

  Well, now I see that wp's a bit confused. There's a /tmp/wpc-salmo/ and a
/tmp/wpc-salmo.appl-ecosys.com/. I think this must have something to do with
the confused application. So, I guess my next step is to rename both
directories to something else and see if wp recreates the one it wants.

Thanks,

Rich

  Thank you, Russell. The command line I used was:

How are you telling Linux to do a 64bit PCI access (I am guessing that
you are writing your own custom driver, right?)

What kind of host machine are you running this card in?  A ia64, i386,
or something else processor?

If it is pppoe, i would recommend Coyote linux firewall.  It is a single
floppy with pppoe and a web based config after install to open ports in
the firewall.  Close em too i guess.

i have been using it since i got pppoe/dsl.

~Ok, there are 2 types of DSL: ppp over ethernet (PPPOE) and bridging.
~
~In bridging, you have a "real" IP address and you just connect via your

Sort of. You really want the -f argument to strace, as that tells strace
to follow any children processes that xwp forks off. 

You might also try doing "ldd /usr1/wp8/wpbin/xwp" to see if any shared
libraries xwp wants can't be identified.

It's been sometime since I used WP8 but I recall I broke it when I 
migrated my workstation to glibc from the older libc5. Make sure you 
have the old libc5 in your system.

Can you use the "ldd" command and see what libraries the WP8 executable 
expects?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205061823290.18426-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I've looked through the strace output trying to start WordPerfect and I
don't see the problem.

  There are some files that are not found, but the processing goes past them
with no apparent ill effect. The last 10 lines of the logfile are:

getpid()                                = 18722
access("/tmp/wpc-salmo.appl-ecosys.com/excmsg8", W_OK) = 0
open("/tmp/wpc-salmo.appl-ecosys.com/_WP__0000018722a_", O_RDWR) = 6
write(5, "\0\0\0\0\1\0\0\0\"I\0\0\364\1\0\0a\364\1\0\0\0\0\32\0\0"..., 516)

getpid()                                = 18722

times({tms_utime=7, tms_stime=6, tms_cutime=0, tms_cstime=0}) = -2135429356
times({tms_utime=7, tms_stime=6, tms_cutime=0, tms_cstime=0}) = -2135429356

  I'd greatly appreciate help interpreting the output. I feel that it must
have something to do with the hostname change, but I cannot see why. And, of
course, I don't know what to do to fix the problem.

Many thanks,

In late March, I posted to PLUG a copy of the message I sent to Sens. 
Wyden and Smith and Rep. Hooley concerning Sen. Hollings' Consumer 
Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act, the successor to the 
SSSCA.

In the mail today (U.S. Mail, not e-mail) there was a letter from Sen.
Wyden's office. Here are the relevant bits:

  The issue of digital content protection has raised significant 
  questions about our copyright regime as we struggle to determine 
  whether and how existing intellectual property laws can adapt to the 
  changing environment in this digital age. It seems clear to me that 
  the distribution of media over the Internet is an exciting 
  development that we cannot and should not try to block. At the same 
  time, we do need to make sure that the legitimate rights of those
  who create such media are protected.

  Technological solutions may be needed to provide such protections. 
  However, like you, I am wary of having government dictate specific 
  technology standards, becasue there is a risk of locking in an 
  inflexible, one-size-fits-all approach. I am also concerned about 
  the possibility that new protections could erode or undermine
  existing consumer rights to fair use. I believe that to create a
  more secure environment for the dissemination of digital content, a
  solution can best be achieved through cooperative discussions among
  all affected parties to develop creative and balanced technological
  approaches, rather than having a government mandated approach.

It sounds like he gets part of it: inflexibility in terms of standards 
and lack of fair-use protections. At the same time, he doesn't mention 
free software's place in this cooperative vision, nor does provide a 
hint as to who belongs in the "all affected parties" category (e.g., 
students and teachers, open-source collaborations that are quite 
likely to be international in nature, etc.).

Still, it sounds as if he's leaning away from the bill for at least 
some of the right reasons. That can't be all bad :-)

  I have both on the system. And I know to save libc5 when I upgrade

  Did this, Tony. They're all there.

  I keep thinking it has something to do with the hostname difference. It's
just that I don't know how to change it in the wpdest.def file because
that's a binary file.

Because he wants it *now*!

Actually I will be downloading it tonight.  When the box sets appear, i
will be buying it as well.  (There are things in the commercial version
that are not in the downloadable version that are well worth the $70.)

Waffles anyone?  It'd be interesting to gather responses from various 
senators & congressmen across the country to compare their verbage--I'm 
guessing boilerplate.  What does Hollings send out?

As quoted:
"I believe that to create a more secure environment for the dissemination 
of digital content, a solution can best be achieved through cooperative 
discussions among all affected parties to develop creative and balanced 
technological approaches..."

And I believe in Hobbits.  He must have in mind a pretty big table to sit 
the RIAA on one end and the rest of the world on the other.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205070656130.20777-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  Well, I'm totally stumped. Grepping all the files in the wp8/ directory
tree for instances of the hostname, I find only one (and a backup). I modify
that file, rename it, delete the /tmp/ directory and so on and WordPerfect
still won't load. Sigh.

  Because I have so much of my business documents in that format (and 18
years experience with the program) I guess I need to find someone here in
town selling whatever latest version there is and upgrade what I have.
Applying all I've learned about linux to figure out what's broken leaves me
no more enlightened than before. Viewing the strace log I see that the
application consistently gets to one point then I start getting the time
messages and that's where it hangs.

  Wish I could have fixed the problem. I'm virtually certain that it's
related to the change in hostname. Somehow, somewhere.

Thanks all,

Rich

Have you tried searching www.dejanews.com for something like, "Wordperfect for Linux won't load?"

This might generate some ideas on where to go from here as well as save you the cost of an upgrade!

Here's what I found:


    DO NOT INSTALL Corel WordPerfect 8 for Linux as ?root?.
    
    Explanation of the problem:
    
    When Corel WordPerfect 8 for Linux loads, it creates a directory called
    /tmp/wpc-<hostname> (where <hostname> is the host name of your computer)
    that has the UMASK 777.
    
    Some necessary temporary files are stored in this folder, all containing the
    UMASK 666. When Corel WordPerfect 8 for Linux loads, it checks to see that
    these files exist, and if so, it will overwrite them.
    
    However, Corel WordPerfect 8 for Linux doesn't check to see if these files
    have been replaced with sym-links of the same name. If this has been done
    (perhaps to compromise system security), Corel WordPerfect 8 for Linux will
    follow those sym-links and, if it has the rights to do so (which it will if
    you install the application as ?root?), it will overwrite the file pointed
    to by the sym-link. This problem could be used to exploit a system.
    
    Procedure to eliminate the problem:
    
    If you have not installed Corel WordPerfect 8 for Linux yet, simply follow
    the instructions under ?Installation Procedures?.
    
    If you have already installed Corel WordPerfect, we strongly recommend that
    you delete that installation and re-install the application. To delete a
    current installation of Corel WordPerfect 8 for Linux, execute the following
    instructions:
    
    rm -r <path to Corel WordPerfect 8 for Linux Installation> (answer yes to
    the prompts)
    rm -rf ~/.wprc
    rm /etc/magic
    
    Installation Procedures:
    
    If you already have another user account setup on your system, then simply
    login under that user account, and run the installation program as you
    normally would.
    
    NOTE: On most systems, you can only mount the CD-ROM drive as root, so you
    should do this before you login as a non-root user.
    
    If you do not have a ?non-root? user account setup on your system, the
    following will set that up (for RedHat Linux only):
    
    Login as root
    
    
    Type: adduser <username>
    where <username> can be any name you wish, but should be something short
    and easy to remember
    
    
    Next type: passwd <username>
    where <username> is the same as what you chose for the previous step
    
    
    You will be prompted for a password for that user, and then asked to confirm
    that password
    
    
    If all went well, you will receive a message similar to the following:
       "passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully"
    To enact a fix to Corel WordPerfect 8 for Linux without re-installing the
    software (this should only be attempted by advanced Linux users ? Corel
    recommends deleting the software and reinstalling using the previous
    method).
    
    This procedure will change the installation of Corel WordPerfect 8 for Linux
    so that it can't be used to exploit the host system. This procedure must be
    executed as root, and is recommended for advanced users only.
    
    Command list:
    
    cd <path to Corel WordPerfect 8 for Linux Installation>/..
    chown <non-root user>: chown <non-root user>: rm -rf /tmp/wpc*
    
    
    EXAMPLE:
    
    cd /usr/local/wp8/..
    chown johnd:johnd wp8 -R
    chown johnd:johnd /etc/magic
    rm -rf /tmp/wpc*

Usually when I see something not obviously failing and doing something
time related, I assume that its waiting for something else, which is why
I really want to see "strace -f" output, to eliminate a failing child
process as a possibility.

Beyond that, I would then grep through your strace logs for your
hostname to see if it is being used inconsistently.

Steve,

  I deleted most of the repetitive time lines from the log. If it's OK with
everyone, I'll either attache it (all 106K) to a message or mail it to
someone who can better interpret it.

Thanks,

Rich

Can you put it on a webpage? If not, mail it to me privately, and I'll
put it on my webserver... No sense spamming the list with it.

Caldera is the most GNOMophobic of all Linux
distributions. I like KDE, but some programs need
GNOME or run better if its libraries are installed.
Anyhow, Caldera does have GNOME src.rpm's on its FTP
site, with no explanation as to why they're there or
whether GNOME can be activated by installing them.

There are about 40 of them. I would appreciate a
comment on the likelihood of success before I try to
install all of them in the correct order.

Have you tried the obvious to confirm this assumption, changing the host
name back and trying to run WP?  Also, if I remember your previous
postings correctly, you really shouldn't be including the domain name in
your local computer's actual hostname when you set it, as this may cause
more problems than it solves (such as ending up with the domain name
attached twice when referencing the computer and causing DNS lookup
failures).

I put it on my webserver here:

One thing I noticed was that it failed to open
/home/rshepard/.Xdefaults-salmo.appl-ecosys.com, but I don't see how
that would fail to keep it from running. Also, is there anything
hostname specific in /home/rshepard/.wprc/?

regarding digital TV.

The file is pretty big, interview begins at about 18 minutes into the show.  
It runs about 9 minutes. (Excellent interview with Justin Huggler of The

I don't know if anyone here is going to know how to do this, other
than perhaps Alan, but it's worth a shot.  When I get a cert from
Thawte, one of the formats offered is supposedly able to be used for
signing other certs.  The idea being, I've got a cert signed by a
recognized CA and am able to extend my trust to a customer's cert, so
instead of my customers having to go to Verisign or Thawte (now the
same company), they can go directly to us.  From my understanding,
this should be possible, but I've never quite figured out how to
do it.  Anyone know?

  I noticed the .Xdefaults, too. So I made a symlink from
.Xdefaults-salmo.appl-ecosys.com to .Xdefaults but that made no difference.

  There are no hostname-specific references in any of the files in .wprc/.
There is a file there called rshepard.hst, but the only 'salmo' that shows
up is in the string 'salmon'.

  As I write, I'd doing a forced restore from the weekly backup of two
Fridays ago. That was when it was working OK. I need to force the restore
because all files in /usr1/wp8/ are as new or newer than those on tape. Of
course.

  OK. I just confirmed that it *is* something host-name specific! I logged
in on the other workstation with a different user name and was able to
invoke WordPerfect with no problem. So, if we cannot find where it's looking
for a host name of 'salmo' and finding 'salmo.appl-ecosys.com', I'll
probably have to reinstall it from the cdrom. Wonder if I can just install
over what's there without removing everything first.

Many thanks,

Rich

Shannon,

  No, I didn't do this. I had to change the hostname so postfix would
install and run. If I change it back I lose mail service.

  Again, postfix insists on a fully-qualified host name before it will
install. However, as I just responded to Steve's message, I logged on to the
other workstation with a different username and was able to invoke
WordPerfect. This should confirm that it is a hostname-specific problem.

Many thanks,

Rich

You should just be able to set myhostname in /etc/postfix/main.cf.
Some installs run 'newaliases' and fail if the myhostname isn't
set or the system hostname isn't good.

Maybe I missed this in an earlier post but have you tried reinstalling 
WordPerfect on the system in question? I haven't used WP8 in years but 
I found my copy of the free version of 8.0 I got nearly 3 1/2 years 
ago. I installed the libc5 libraries on my 2.4.18 system and WP8 
installed very quickly. I tested it on a few WP documents I still have 
laying around and it appears to run OK.

  Thanks, Wil. I didn't know that I could change it back once postfix was up
and running. Just did so.

  So far, no difference in WordPerfect, though.

Wil,

The OpenSSL stuff often ships with a CA.sh or CA.pl script.  
Eye-grepping it will be instructive. Red Hat 7.1 even includes a man
page for the Perl version of the CA script.

In general, you'd want to create your own Certificate Authority (CA). 
Then have your client generate a key (specific to the host on which 
it'll operate) and a cert request based on that key. Your CA would 
then create a new cert based on the client's request. Ship the new 
cert back to your client, install it wherever, point the client's SSL 
apps at it, et voila.

Tony,

  Actually, I tried re-installing but it didn't work for some reason. It's
been more than four years since I bought this version (for the network) and
I've misplaced the specific installation instrucutions.

  Anyway, two important points:

  1) The installation is on a filesystem that's exported to the network and
it's accessible from the other workstation as well as this one.

  2) The problem is unique to this workstation. I can log on to the other
workstation -- in my username -- and WP comes right up. So, it's something I
changed on this one box and I've no idea what it might be!

I am pretty sure you can't do this from userspace like you are trying
to, but you just asked this on lkml, which is the proper place for it.
Someone there will be able to give you a better answer.

  I've done a lot of testing and I'm more puzzled than ever. There's nothing
wrong with the installation of WP or the hostname of this box. Here's what
I've found:

  Username			Host			Results

  rshepard			salmo			hangs when loading
  rshepard			caddis			runs
  pamela			salmo			runs
  pamela			caddis			runs

  I moved the ~/.wprc directory to ~/WPRC but it makes no difference. There
must be something in my home directory -- or in a WP startup/config file --
that's causing the app to hang when loading *only* when I'm trying to start
it on this one host.

  Any ideas?

Thanks,

Rich

Try removing /tmp/wpc-* (esp. where * == your old hostname).

Call your vendor?

Or maybe strace a working version and the non-working version and diff
the strace logs.

I doubt I'm going to get an answer from lkml.  It looks like they are
pretty busy discussing more important matters.  I'm glad you said that
lklm was the right place for the question, though. 

If this were being done from kernel space, how would the code be written
to get 64 bit transfers to happen?

See if there are any config files for Wine and/or Corel hanging about. 
They might be the problem.  (Corel uses a very odd version of Wine.)

They have stopped supporting Word Perfect.

Paul,

 I've tried this. Removing all instances of /tmp/wpc-* allows for the
creation of a new /tmp/wpc-salmo the next time I try to invoke the program.
(I've changed the hostname back to salmo.)

  What's interesting is that no matter how much or how little I have in
~/.wprc (or, if there's nothing there at all), WP will load when I am logged
in on the other workstation.

  What files might be unique to a particular user AND a particular host?
It's the combination that's preventing WP from loading. I know this is
puzzling, but it seems to be a more generic linux question now rather than a
WordPerfect/linux question.

  Perhaps I need to try the Redmond fix: reboot the box. Well, it's been 250
days so it can't hurt, right? :-)

Alan -- and everyone,

  The Redmond solution did the trick. Must have been a bone stuck in memory
somewhere and it took a reboot to cough it out. I am amused that I never
think of rebooting to solve a problem until I've spent 1.5 days trying
everything possible to find the cause. :-) While it's almost like giving up
to reboot the box (it had an uptime of 250 days), it got me back into
production. Whew!

  They never did support it. Until they disbanded their WP/linux team, I was
in regular communications with the head of that team and he was equally
frustrated at corporate's attitude toward the product.

  Thank you all very much for your cards and letters of encouragment and the
help offered. I always learn valuable lessons and I gain tremendous insight
working to resolve these problems and benefiting from all the expertise
here. But, ... reboot? Who thinks of that, eh?

Rich,

One thing I do notice after I exit WordPerfect is that there is a 
process named "wpexc" that hangs around all of the time unless I kill 
it.

What doesn't work about them?  What kind (make and model) are they?

Some modules have a hard time loading twice, but that is model specific.

More information is needed to really help you out, tell us what you have
tried, and what happened when you tried it.  The output from dmesg might
help too.

Subject: [PLUG] help with filter rules for sftp
Message-ID: <20020507230340.IUVA25294.rwcrmhc52.attbi.com@rwcrwbc57>

Hiya.

I have a netopia 9100 router (hey don't go away yet)
sitting between the DSL line and the hub in the wiring
closet, and I'm setting it up with some firewall rules
and port forwarding. 

I can successfully make it so that one computer on the
outside can use lynx and connect to the router's port 80
and see an internal computer's web page.  Thus, I know
that the firewalling and the portforwarding is working.

However, the Boss needs to securely FTP through the box
to somewhere else, that also uses a NAT setup.  I have
his computer (a Mac) running NetFinder with an OpenSSLLib
library with it (as the service he's trying to use
demands).  I have these rules in the netopia:

dest_ip:source_ip:protocol:src_port:dest_port:active:allow
(testexternal):0.0.0.0:TCP:ALL:80:Yes:Yes
(serviceip):0.0.0.0:TCP:ALL:>=1024:Yes:Yes
(serviceip):0.0.0.0:UDP:ALL:>=1024:Yes:Yes
(internaladdresses):(anywhere):(any protocol):::Yes:Yes

The Service uses port 10021 for "secure ftp command" and
10020 for "secure ftp data". However, it's unclear to me
from their documentation if it will be connecting to that
port or from that port to "a random port above 1023". 
The rules above allow all that stuff (I want it to work,
then I'll narrow it down).  I'm forwarding all contact
for ports 10021 and 10020 from the netopia to the boss's
computer (which requires, of course that the Service is
trying to reach that port, but I don't see "forward all
ports over 1023 to the boss's computer" as ... a good
solution.  I've tried it both with and without the port
forwarding and it does not work either way.

Here's what happens... 
He can log in fine (more or less); there's no error for
password or anything. However, he cannot get a directory
listing, and recieves a "Data Error (425)" from the
NetFinder application, which leads me to believe that
there's something wrong with the (wait for it) data
channel firewall rules.  Obviously I misunderstand
something of how that all works, in regard to a double
channel connection (ie ftp versus http, which I actually
made to work).

um help?

Thanks :)

what kind of ethernet cards ??

ISA or PCI ??

I have seen some ISA card that one must 1st flash the bios on the card
to set the IRQ, so that they can be happy.

Netgear dec tulip cards seem to be happy at the same IRQ. 

more info on the cards. 

but a rule of thumb is to have 2 different brands of ether net cards. 

dec tulip, 3com etc.

I'm trying to get printing working on my laptop which gets its address
from a DHCP server.  

Whenever I do an 'lpr' I get:

Get_local_host: hostname 'traveller.home.com' bad

My hosts file on the laptop looks like:

127.0.0.1       localhost.home.com   localhost 
192.168.0.1     jed.home.com jed
192.168.0.2     zeph.home.com zeph


If I change it to:

127.0.0.1       localhost.home.com   localhost 
127.0.0.1      traveller.home.com    traveller
192.168.0.1     jed.home.com jed
192.168.0.2     zeph.home.com zeph

I don't get the error message from lpr, but somehow I don't think it's a
good idea.

So, since I'm getting my ip address via DHCP on the laptop, what should
I put in /etc/hosts to identify 'traveller' with an ip address?

BTW: I'm using lprng and sending print jobs to a remote printserver.

You can't directly do a 64bit read/write (from what I can tell.)  Take a
look at the file Documentaion/DMA-mapping.txt for how to get PCI DMA to
happen properly from within a kernel driver.  It explains all sorts of
64bit access stuff.

Hope this helps,

Put both the traveller and localhost lines on one:

127.0.0.1   localhost.home.com localhost traveller.home.com traveller

Just out of curiosity, how were you changing the hostname?

Below are the gory details.
The system was working fine on both nets when running Solaris.
Linux recognize the cards but is having trouble using them.
The cards are 3Com EtherLink XL - PCI - 3C900-TPO
any insights would be appreciated.

  AFAIK, it sticks.

What type of system is this (motherboard chipset, processor, etc)? Those
errors look like they may be irq sharing problems.  Is it possible to
change the slots that the cards are in?  Is the BIOS assigning an irq to
each card during POST?  Is your BIOS set to "Plug-n-Play OS"?

Good luck

Thanks for the feedback.  I finally got it working, albeit in one direction.
I enabled an MTRR to do write combining over the memory space of my PCI
card.  Now when I do 'memset(pmem, 0, size[function][i])', I see activity
on req64 and ack64.  I still don't know how to get the bridge to do 64
bit reads, but at least I know my board will respond as a 64 bit target.

thanks for your help,
galen

This seems to be a heavily discussed issue with the driver
for this card. You can find one thread here
http://www.tux.org/hypermail/linux-vortex/2001-Jun/0022.html
The suggestion was to pass the kernel the noapic option 
when booting. Another thing that might work is to use the
bios to force each ethernet card to have a separate IRQ.

AFAIK, it doesn't stick unless you edit the file /etc/sysconfig/network. At 
least with RH and RH alike systems.

This is what I ran into when I used the GUI version of this tool.
Neither Apache nor HTTPD show up.  Does that mean I did something wrong
when installing, or is there another service I should be looking for.

Russ,

  You're probably correct. To install postfix I had to change the name.
Today I changed it back. No reboots between these times.

  The hostname man page indicates that it can be used to set the hostname,
too. It says nothing about how permanent the change is.

Thanks,

Rich

I just installed 2.0.35 and have to start it with "apachectl startssl". 
There must be a better way to do it.  I just put it in rc.local and it
starts right up.  leave off the ssl if ya don't need that.

Hmmm. Did you install w/ an RPM? Typically, the apache rpm should create
all of your /etc/rc.d/init.d stuff for httpd. Kinda sounds like that
didn't happen.

I seen anyone mention OpenOffice 1.0. I remember a few 1.0s that got a lot of
press a few years back. Have times changed or is an office suite mundane?

I am not certain if it is in the release version of 7.3. I will check
when I am done downloading it.  

I currently have the docs disc, the two source RPM discs and most of the
first install disc downloaded. I expect I will have the rest by morning.
I am making two copies. One for me and one for whoever wants a copy and
can actually get it from me first.

If you built from source, then you'll need to create your own startup
script and drop it in /etc/init.d/ then make a symlink to it in your
favorite runlevel.  Here's a simple one to get you going:

#!/bin/sh

case "$1" in
start)
	/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start
	;;
stop)
	/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl stop
	;;
*)
	echo $"*** Usage: $prog {start|stop}"
	exit 1
esac

exit $?

Nope, no OpenOffice in RH7.3.

I have (some-what-tested) RPMs available here:

ftp://k12linux.mesd.k12.or.us/pub/distributions/testing/K12LTSP-2.1.0-beta/RPM/OpenOffice-suite-1.0-2.i386.rp
ftp://k12linux.mesd.k12.or.us/pub/distributions/testing/K12LTSP-2.1.0-beta/RPM/OpenOffice-suite-configs-1.0-2.noarch.rpm

I swipped the idea that Ximian had for StarOffice 5.2, these packages have a
wrapper script named "office" that will auto-magically configure OpenOffice
for each user the first time they run it.

Well this is very cool.  Nothing I like better than punching through a Win2k corporate network with a Linux box in the bone yard.  I have a web server up and running on a throw away computer, and the Linux fix gets me through the day.

AFAIK there is no rpm for 2.0.35.  Did you put the full path?  mine is
/usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl ? there is also a httpd in there too.

This seems kind of silly to me.

Why wouldn't you just symlink apachectl into /etc/init.d?

That's what I always do.

If you built from source, then you'll need to create your own startup
script and drop it in /etc/init.d/ then make a symlink to it in your
favorite runlevel.  Here's a simple one to get you going:

#!/bin/sh

I have RH7.3 (valhalla) and its a 3 cd set now. If thats not what you
are downloading its probably not right. It did prompt me for all 3 cds
in the install so it is required ( although it was only 3 apps on the
3rd cd) Havent gotten around to testing yet, but I had a up to date
patched 7.2 box so Im not sure how many things will be noticeable.It
does include KDE 3.0 ( which made me switch back from the Gnome camp
especially with High performance liquid) I did do a fresh install on my
work machine so maybe that will look somewhat different.

I don't use KDE 3.0 any more.  I found the environment a bit too
controlling.  (Cut and paste always brought up a pop up asking me what I
wanted to do with the selection. It tends to eat control and shift key
press information, which makes certain games difficult. Looks nice
though.)

Currently my main desktop machine is running Redhat 7.2 with Ximian
Gnome. Works pretty well. (I need to change how window focuses work, but
that is minor.)

After the problems I have had with the Mandrake developers, it is nice
to go back to something I know will work correctly.

Subject: [PLUG] Help with secure ftp and ip ruleset?
Message-ID: <20020508172604.RTNV25765.rwcrmhc54.attbi.com@rwcrwbc58>

How does Secure FTP differ from HTTP and SSH; ie how does
the double channel thing work?  I ask because I can make
our firewall forward SSH and HTTP from the outside world
to my internal computer (internal on the LAN, that is)
but I can't make my boss's computer SFTP to a remote site
(that apparently works for everyone else).

My rule set looks like:

The netopia router is configured like this:
1) it forwards port 22 to my workstation, and I can log
in via ssh from my home computer.  It used to forward
port 80 to my workstation and I could browse the little
web pages I have running on that computer from outside
our LAN. 
2) it forwards ports 10020 and ports 10021 to the Boss's
computer.
3) it has an out bound rule set (out from the LAN to the
WAN) that allows everything.
4) it has an inbound rule set (in from the WAN to the
LAN) that ...
  a) allows connection to port 22 for any address (ssh
for my computer)
  b) allows connections from ftp.server.com to any port
greater than 1023 to any address.

When the Boss goes to connect, he gets "logged in" (no
error message there) but an error pops up that he cannot
get a data transfer. Which implies to me something wrong
with port 10020 communications, but if the server
(ftp.server.com) tries to connect to that port, it'll get
accepted (port 10020 is greater than port 1023) and it'll
get forwarded to the Boss's computer.  

I don't really want to forward *all* connections to a
high end port to the Boss's computer, do I? That seems...
excessively dangerous.  

Any education I can acquire would be .. helpful. :)

I hope someone can point out the obvious mistake I am doing that prevents me
from using my docking station network card.
Every OS SEEs the dock NIC but there is NO connection.
When it was new, (11/2000), RedHat 6.2 worked flawlessly. about a year ago I
lost all dock network capability.

system; Dell Latitude CPxJ I600, 128, 20G
Dock	C/dock2  with embedded 3Com 3C920 NIC and Adaptec SCSI.
OS; Redmond linux, Win2k 
eth0; 3c920
RAM; 128MB
HD; 20Gb
PCMCIA;	works with every NIC 
BIOS; A014 latest

The network cable has been swapped with the computer next to it and both
function perfectly.
The NIC link light goes ON when I plug the network cable in. The hub link
also lights.

eg. assign IP address to NIC, eth0 up, ping 127.0.0.1 OK,
ping default GW by number, Negative results
ping any other number results in a negative ping response.

Any PCMCIA NIC works fine. 


Dell has replaced the motherboard and the dock 2X and is now eyeing me with
great suspicion. I am starting to doubt my "geek" status.

I had a similar problem during debian install process.  The NIC would come up, 
drivers will load, I could assign IPs manually, but -any- traffic passing over 
the NIC was summarily ignored (tcpdump confirmed this).  

I solved it by using an install image (and kernel image) that had the driver 
compiled directly in.  And it was a 3com NIC, too.  The netgear worked fine, I 
might add.

  Is anyone else here using WordPerfect and CUPS? I have everything working
again except the printing. (And it was broken printing that started my
problems the past couple of days.)

  When things worked, I was able to create a printer destination of 'ljraw'.
Now I cannot. The default lpr printer is $PRINTER with the destination
option of 'ljraw', but it's not working. If I select a WPApp destination
(other than disk), the printer control dialog box pops up and says there's a
problem with /var/spool/cups/. I cannot find the problem so I cannot clear
it up.

  Easy Software now wants $250 for 90 days of support. Hoo-ha! Perhaps a
large organization with dozens of workstations and printers may need that
level of support, but I just want to get WP working again with CUPS. The
newsgroup is useless; no one responds to my posts.

  PITA though it is, I can print a letter to disk and then to the printer.
But, I cannot do envelopes the same way. I'm not a happy camper.

  Has anyone built abiword-1.0.1 with the pspell option enabled? I tried
this and make found errors for this module.

  Just wondering if it's reportable.

  Also, does anyone know if abiword 1) does mail merge 2) can translate
WordPerfect files and 3) can work with templates (about the same as mail
merge).

Thanks,

No.  Not, at least, the ones my former partner brought home from her old

If you look at the script Matt posted, all it does is pass a start to
apachectl when you pass a start to the script and pass a stop to
apachectl when you pass a stop to the script.

I don't see the purpose of the intervening script there.

Also, the apachectrl script takes other arguments common to init scripts
like restart.

  Nuts. I'll have to see what formats it *will* accept. Perhaps I can get a

Have you tried OpenOffice.org?  1.0 seems pretty nice; much
faster and less memory-hungry than SO 5.2.

OpenOffice 1.0 will not read Word Perfect files

Using a script to call apachectl is an extra and unnecessary step, so feel
free to use the script I posted as a template for starting and stopping
other services.  For example, to start and stop sshd, you might have:

#!/bin/sh

case "$1" in
start)
	/usr/local/sbin/sshd
	;;

stop)
	killall sshd
	;;

restart)
	killall sshd
	/usr/local/sbin/sshd
	;;

*)
	echo $"*** Usage: $prog {start|stop|restart}"
	exit 1
esac

exit $?

It's better to use to the PID file of the parent process if
available.  If you just use 'killall sshd', you'll also kill your
login shell if you're logged in via ssh, which can be a PITA.

Hi Rich,
I do not have Satroffice 5.2 but in Openoffice 1.0 to
print an envelope is under "Insert, Envelope".

Wil,

  I haven't. As I need only word processing I thought AbiWord might be the
way to go. I guess that WordPerfect has finally worn out and needs to be
replaced. I have about 70-80 templates I use for various things and those
need to be recreated in whatever new software I adopt here.

  AbiWord must have a facility to add additional Type1 fonts but I've not
yet found it.

  Have you any idea how OpenOffice's word processing capabilities compare
with AbiWord's?

Thanks,

Rich

I heard about this while waiting outside of Breck's office (OIT

I understand TiVO also runs on a Linux OS, though I don't have the

Ah, excellent point.  So instead of 'killall sshd', try using:

cat /var/run/sshd.pid | xargs kill

Well, I can open some class assignments that have some set notation
in them that wouldn't display with AbiWord 0.7.14.  Also, only
Star/OpenOffice will generate PostScript my ancient Apple LaserWriter
Plus can handle; Kword and AbiWord wouldn't.

  Abiword installed itself ('make install') in /usr/local/share/AbiSuite/.
Does this mean that I must install it on each workstation in order to have
access to it from more than one workstation?

  I'd like to have it on a nfs-exported/mounted filesystem so it's available
to every workstation.

Thanks,

During the build stage, will abiword let you specify where to install
it?  If it uses configure, the answer is almost surely yes and reading
through the equivalent of the INSTALL file will tell you what switches
to throw to make it do that.

The GNU configure default is:
  ./configure --prefix=/your/very/own/path

  Thanks, Colin. I read the top of configure to get the available options.
Forgot about the --prefix one. I'll rebuild and re-install.

What caught my eye was the OLED(organic light emitting diode) display.  This
is the technology that is going to make laptop batteries last several times
longer and make huge monitors able to be folded up and put in your pocket.
Really cool stuff.

Subject: [PLUG] evolution woes in redhat 7.3
Message-ID: <1020899783.29913.5.camel@brain>

I am trying to find out is my box screwed or is redhat 7.3 version of 
evolution screwed. 

I had ximian and life was good, then I did the upgraded. 

Redhat 7.3 Evolution would not allow me to read my mail, nice hang when
trying to fetch the mail from the local machine,  nice hang to  lock the
window mangers focus. 

After downloading the source rpm, I found that new evolution will not
build on rh 7.3 environment. It requires the old sleepy cat db3 3.1.17
version to build. 


Redhat gets around this by rebuilding db3 3.1.17 in evolution build dir.

But I think that there is a bug, also debugging evolution with it 10 or
so process does not look like fun. 

Has anyone been able to pull down their mail in a redhat 7.3 box with
pop, and been able to read mail ??

This last one was 128 KB. It's sent to me at my old school e-mail

doesn't use his school address at all. The only thought I've had about
it is that it is an Outlook related thing and that one of my classmates
who uses Outlook got bit by it and it is sending stuff to the addresses

  Sonofagun!

  Well, I'm rebuilding abiword so I can properly install it in a shared
filesystem, and I'm downloading OO (from Iceland, no less, because it's
faster than SF or NY).

  Guess I'll post a comparison of the two if no one else has experience with
them.

I sent a similar message to the same three. I received a snail mail
response from Senator Smith. Unlike your letter from Senator Wyden, this
one doesn't give me any hint as to what Senator Smith thinks on the
subject. Actually, now that I read it over, it sounds like he hadn't
heard of the issue before getting our letters.

Au contraire, mine intrepid Linux explorer. File -> Page Setup -> Paper Size. 
Nice WYSIWYG envelope that lets you type any darn where you please on it, 
even insert a picture. Much more flexible than Brand X. I like Abiword a 
whole heck of a lot, it is my main word processor. It handles Word docs quite 
well. With AbiWord and Gnumeric, I have achieved happiness.

  Oh. Thanks, Carla. I've been busy this afternoon building and installing
the two programs. I greatly appreciate the pointer. Will it take the address
from a letter that's open?

  Anyway, that's good to know. OpenOffice takes forever (like So and, I
presume, winWord) to open. And the source code is 69M! Whew! I'd rather work
with AbiWord as it appears that after 18 years of use, WordPerfect has
reached the end of its useful life. One last question about AbiWord for you:
can I select single- or double-sided printing from within the application?
Let me explain.

  My CUPS system is set for double-sided printing. But, within WordPerfect,
letters, invoices and so on are to be printed single-sided. WP would default
to single-sided printing, but I could set it for duplex on a
document-specific level. How does abiword do with this?

  I'm delighted with XessSE as a spreadsheet and I've found that Magicpoint
does all *I* need to do for presentations.

Many thanks,

Rich

Not like anybody really cares what I think, but that disappointed me.

Isn't Wyden on a technology committee??  Anybody know this?

Looks like a form letter. Change the words "digital rights" (which you 
probably included in your email) to any other issue, and that form will fit 
for anything. Most likely, The Honorable Mr. Smith didn't read you email, 
and some flunky working in his office got to choose what your letter was 
about, type it in, and produce the letter you got.

I am currently using WordPerfect 8 and CUPS.  Your problem is most likely
WordPerfect, I have had nothing but problems with it and printing for all
the years I have been using it under Linux.  From what you wrote I kind of
get the impression you have a different version of WP than I do, so I am
not sure if any of this will help or even applies to you.

   1 - My experience with my version of WP is that if it isn't in the
       /etc/printcap file WP can't deal with it (yes I know that CUPS
       doesn't use the printcap).
   2 - If it is in the /etc/printcap file, the definition must all be
       on one line, no continuations/multi-line definitions.
   3 - WP only understands the first name of each printer in the
       printcap file, all the others in the printer definition are
       ignored.
   4 - WP gets upset if the printer name is longer than two characters
       (possibly if it is shorter as well, I never tried it).

With these four issues as a given, I configured CUPS with a two character
printer name for the printer and added a single line description of the
printer to my printcap:

   st|StylusC80|Remote printer Epson Stylus C80:lp=:rm=nashapur.deatech.com:rp=StylusC80:sd=/var/spool/lpd/remote:mx#0:sh:

most of this is probably unnecessary since WP will just pass the data to
lpr, but if I ever use a non-cups printing program, it will probably be
useful (I only converted to CUPS one or two months ago).  Then in WP I
added a printer definition using the passthru postscript driver and
referencing this printer.

I don't know which distribution you are using, but under Debian, I needed
a separate package "cupsys-bsd" to get the old style lpr command for WP
to use when printing.  My experience with error messages from WP when the
printing failed was that they were completely useless and gave no actual
clue as to the problem which was actually occuring.  Instead I used the
printer logs and CUPS status commands to see if any attempt was actually
made to queue a job, and if so, why it failed to print.

FWIW.

No, must copy & paste. Must choose-  more clicks, or fatter code. ;-)

I don't know about duplex printing, it's not mentioned anywhere in the docs, 
and it's not on the menu. I have version .99.3, a couple steps behind the 
latest n greatest. Open/Star Office duplexes.
 
Winword is pretty fast, on a fast machine. It's quite sophisticated, I've 
built large complex documents with all sorts of intricate page-numbering 
schemes, and Byzantine page layouts. The main reasons I have to not like it 
are it won't run on Linux, and the deliberate and ever-evolving file format 
incompatibilities. And Visual Basic- barf me a river. Abiword supports 
plugins and scripting, in REAL languages. (I believe most Linux word 
processors offer some degree of nice Unix-y functions and extensions.)

I'll have a look at them. I like Star Office and Open Office, they have a lot 
of nice features. But I keep wandering back to AbiWord. It has a feature I've 
not seen anywhere else- "Paste unformatted". I use that a lot. My needs are 
pretty basic- page numbering, headers/footers, a bit of autotext, and word 
count. If I really want to go nuts, it has vi and Emacs key bindings. 
Combined with Klipper, the nicest clipboard tool I know of, I can crank out a 
1500-word article in record time. Klipper actually lets you see what is on 
it, unlike Brand MS, which holds up to 12 items identified only by the app 
they were made in. How useless can you get.

Subject: [PLUG] es1371 sound card
Message-ID: <20020508204735.B2389@plato.usc.edu>

Hello List,

I tried to subscribe to the list but I received an error from the WWW server:

The requested URL /mailing_list/mailing_list.cgi was not found on this server.

I am having troubles with my sound card es1371. After I play a sound my
computer freezes for a couple of minutes. I am running RH7.2 with kernel
2.4.7-10.

I am using a scsi adapter ADAPTEC AIC-7896. The scsi is using irq 10 and the
sound card irq 11:

[root at plato rapela]# cat /proc/interrupts

NMI:          0 
ERR:          0

Finally, the sndconfig utility adds the following lines to /etc/modules.conf:

alias sound-slot-0 es1371
post-install sound-slot-0 /bin/aumix-minimal -f /etc/.aumixrc -L >/dev/null 2>&1
|| :
pre-remove sound-slot-0 /bin/aumix-minimal -f /etc/.aumixrc -S >/dev/null 2>&1
|| :  

Do you know what could be the cause of the problem. It seems an interrupt
conflict with the scsi card (altough they are using different irq).

Any help will be greatly appreciated, Joaquin

Dear Linux Gurus:

I am having trouble one of my Linux boxes running SuSE
6.4.   The problem seems to have started with abrupt
shutdown of the box.  I did get Toms Rescue Disk and
ran e2fsck and the file system seems O.K.  However, on
a normal boot, it gives me the following boot message:

"auto: auto: No such file or directory"

If you can point me in the right direction I would be
thankful.  

Regards,

Seth Pinsky

The most widely-used compiler for Linux is free.
Metrowerks, however, claims that their commercial IDE
product is very popular. Would someone who is familiar
with it care to offer an opinion as to whether it is
worth the money ($149)?

This is the Klez worm.  I have been getting at least 5-10 of these a
day. (From all over the world.) Turns out there are a whole bunch of
variants of this virus.  Some are pretty nasty. Some actually disable
other viruses. Some take out anti-virus software and install new
viruses.  One variant is believed to have been the result of the virus
payload being infected by another virus.

One of the main reasons I am glad I use Linux.

It looks like your system believes you have two scsi cards installed on
the same IRQ.

It this an on-board es1371 or is it on a card? 

Check /proc/dma and see if the soundcard is fighting for dma with
something else. (I have had that problem and it caused similar weird
problems with my scsi card.)

I have an older version and I never use it.  There are a number of free
IDEs out there.  Most of them seem to work better.

The biggest problem is that it was very difficult to create
distributable code.  It did not generate make files that were useful. 
(No autoconf support and a proprietary project file format.)  Unless
that has changed, it is not really worth it.  

What language do you need to work in?  Kdevelop looked promising I tend
to use a standard text editor any more.

You might try this in your aliases file (if you do not have devices using irq 15 (usually secondary IDE devices):

 alias sound-slot-0 es1371 io=0x300 irq=15

Or another free irq in your system.

Subject: [PLUG] Dialup Server on network with Linksys DSL/Cablemodem router
Message-ID: <00dd01c1f721$b02523d0$6401a8c0@endeavor>

I found a quick how-to at:

http://www.redhat.com/support/resources/tips/Dialup-Tips/ppp_server_tips
-1.html


My questions, before I begin are: will this allow me to interface with
the router, and other on the LAN?  Essentially what I am trying to do is
setup a dialup server so that when away on the road, I can dial in and
have internet access, along with access to the other computers on our
LAN.  We have a Linksys BEFSR41 Cable/DSL router, though there sometimes
arises the need to do a DHCP release and refresh from "inside".  It's
imperative that the dialup server allows me to do this by connecting to
the router internally on 192.168.1.1.

I guess my main question is:  Since there is only one modem/phone line,
should I configure it to just hand out a static IP?  The other systems
on the network have dynamic IP's in the range of 192.168.1.100 through
.149 (potentially, though only 100 through 105 are used).  I was
imagining that say, 192.168.1.150 would work for the one dialup user.

If anyone else has experience doing this sort of thing, I could use a
tip or two on pitfalls to watch out for.

The system is a i386 (1ghz Duron/256mb RAM, gobs of IDE HD space)
running a fairly stock RedHat 7.2 install.  I have no plans to upgrade
any of the packages to Redhat 7.3 at this time - why fix something
that's not broken.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205082318440.16966-100000@antares.mpcu.com>

I've been searching the archives and haven't found a reference yet.  I've 
also posted on the freeswan list three and only received one answer so 
far.  That was from a plug list member suggesting I post here.  And here 
it goes.



I'm compiling 1.97 on a RedHat 7.2/7.3 with the latest updates.  Using 
"make xrpm"  the process will die with an error of:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, I'm not too sharp at using make.  It seems a simple fix, 
but I'm not sure why 
/usr//src/freeswan-1.97/tmp.rpmbuild/lib/modules/ipsec  doesn't get 
created in the first place.  I have tried this on clean installs of Redhat 
7.2 and 7.3 with updates using both 1.96 and 1.97.

Hopefully somebody will have an idea on how to resolve this.  Thanks

If you only need a command-line interface, the other way to do this 
would be to have a modem setup so you can dial-in and get a "login" 
prompt using "mgetty" on the server. You can use a simple terminal 
program that supports a VT100 or other simple text-based terminal 
program to dial into the server. I've never configured a Linksys router 
and so if it requires a web-brower then "mgetty" may not work unless 
the router configuration setup works with a text-based browser.

I need to work in a language that allows the
development of X applications. I checked KDevelop,
which came with my KDE installation, and am going to
try that instead of purchasing Code Warrior.

"Developing Linux Applications: KDE Edition" is
available to support KDevelop (from Powell's) for
those who prefer printed books. You'll still have
something left over from the $149.

I am using KDE 2.2 because that's what comes with
Caldera 3.1, no binary version of KDE 3.0 being yet
available for Caldera. I think KDE 3.0 could be
compiled from source for this purpose. Would it be a
good idea to try?

I don't remember ever seeing (in the GPL) anything about how code is
written (which IDE) or what programming language is used.   I think the
question would be for the experts on the VB EULA: does it say anything
about what license the code is distributed under?  And you'd probably
have to look at the license for the Microsoft code that you are using
(all those GUI widgets and stuff).  But I don't try to be an expert at
anything M$ related... ;)

Ya know, I used to be opposed to those form letters that some groups try
to get tons of web site readers to send in to their elected officials
(me thinking that hand written letters were more effective).  
Now I'm thinking that if the officials themselves respond to our hand
written letters with form letters, then why should we bother with hand
written stuff they won't even read?  It would be interesting to talk to
the "flunky working in [someone's] office", and ask him/her what is most
effective regarding letter writing - a few personal letters or a lot of
form letters?  Or neither?  

I don't suppose anyone knows how to contact our elected officials' hired
flunkies?  ;)

OK, this ought to be a simple chron-type question:

I am about to leave my office to head off to a customer site job (like 10 
min. from now.) I decide to check e-mail one more time before I leave.
KDE says somebody has sent me about 5956 kB of data, probably 1 or 2 e-mail 
messages with MONGO MS-Office attachments.*

OK, so I live out in rural Columbia County, and connect at 28.8 on a GREAT 
day, 26.4 most o' the time, and sometimes about half that. This usually means 
6 to 8 minutes of download time per MB.

Rather than leave now and have the modem idly connected for hours, is there a 
chron thingie I can type in that says "(Nicely) disconnect me from my ISP 55 
mintues from now?"

I am running Mandrake 8.2

  In the handy-dandy postfix book I bought last weekend I find the SMTP
action codes most commonly associated with rejected spam in the access.db.
There is a slight difference between 450 and 550, and they seem to be the
most commonly used.

  Is there a reason (standard, or whatever) for selecting one over the
other? Might it be worth while to bounce the message back with a request to
forward future mail to /dev/null?

Thanks,

Look at the man page for 'at'.  There's quite a bit of flexibility there.
Also, I believe the current pppd has the ability to automatically bring
the line up and down based on traffic.

You didn't mention how you are setting up your connection or what email client
you are using. If you are using a graphical connection client you need to look
at how it is calling up the connection. If it is calling up a script, then
there is probably a script it calls to disconnect. Calling the disconnect
script after some time period via cron would be a not so good way to do it. If
you are using a non-graphical setup then it should be easy to find the
corresponding down script.

Having your email client controlling the connection would be the better way to
do this. You are after all interested in getting all your email, not what can
get there in 10 minutes. Your email client may have on demand checking where it
can start the connection and stop the connection based on it's own needs. This
implies the email client and you dialer have some interconnection.

Using on demand dialing would be the most eloquent way to solve the problem. On
demand, either via pppd, wdiald, or diald would setup or connection when there
are packets to be sent and would time out after a set time limit of inactivity.
this too would insure you get all you mail.


Thank you
Russell

Isn't there the VB runtime thing involved? I would assume that would be the

I disagree.  The license (whether GPL or otherwise)
applies only to the code that you write.  Even though
you used the work of others to write and test it.  The
original poster's scenario is really no different from
running emacs (GPL'd software) on Windoze (a
proprietary platform).

Look at JBoss, or any of the Apache Java
projects--they all run on a proprietary runtime
environment (the Java Development Kit (JDK) or Java
Runtime Environment (JRE)).

The only time a problem would arise is if M$ decides
to modify their EULA to specifically prohibit the use
of their tools for creating software that is licensed
in a certain way (they have already started doing
similar things).  If they do decide to do this, simply
use a tool that was released before M$ took the GPL
seriously.  Also, this raises some interesting legal
questions (such as, "Can a vendor tell you how you
what you can and can't do with your work, just because
you used their tools?")

I need full PPP access, I tried accessing the router interface with Lynx
and it's messy.

Plus, we want to be able to have "normal" internet access when we can't
find/borrow a local ISP

If you only need a command-line interface, the other way to do this 
would be to have a modem setup so you can dial-in and get a "login" 
prompt using "mgetty" on the server. You can use a simple terminal 
program that supports a VT100 or other simple text-based terminal 
program to dial into the server. I've never configured a Linksys router 
and so if it requires a web-brower then "mgetty" may not work unless 
the router configuration setup works with a text-based browser.

Make Your Workstations Fit With Aptus
By Eric Foster-Johnson

Linux on the desktop has been a question for some time. Is Linux truly fit
for desktop usage? A few years ago, you could clearly answer no. Linux was
not yet ready for general desktop usage but with continuing advances in the
GNOME and KDE desktops, along with a host of Linux applications such as
AbiWord or StarOffice, Linux can now claim that that it is indeed ready for
the desktop.

The main problem remains convincing businesses to move from Windows, though.
In an interesting spin, Hong Kong-based ShaoLin Microsystems has come up
with a system they feel will take Linux into corporate desktops, in a
different form than most of us are used to.

ShaoLin's Aptus ( http://itw.itworld.com/GoNow/a14724a57948a76073993a9 )
provides a client-server system to manage Linux desktops with very little
administrative effort. ShaoLin believes this is one way where Linux can
succeed on the desktop, by focusing entirely on business value for IT
managers.

The Aptus product fits in the middle between the traditional "fat" client
desktop, a full-powered PC usually running Windows, and a traditional thin
client workstation such as the X Window terminals that used to be popular.
ShaoLin calls their solution a "fit" client, one with more power like a
desktop workstation but with the thin client advantages for administrators.

The Aptus fit client server is a Linux server running Aptus software. It
manages fit client workstations, which are Linux workstations running
special software to connect to the Aptus server. In addition, the clients
can be less powerful boxes since the data and applications are stored on the
server.

You can download a trial version of the Aptus Server from
http://itw.itworld.com/GoNow/a14724a57948a76073993a7 . The demo allows you
to try the software for 45 days with two clients.
 
ShaoLin has their work cut out for them in trying to sell Linux on the
desktop. Their clear focus, though, on business IT cost structures, should
allow ShaoLin to go farther than most efforts in this arena.

Does the "procmail" file exist in /var/log and does it have write access 
set on it? If the file doesn't exist you can create an empty file using 
the "touch" command.

Generally, if memory serves, 400 codes are temporary
failures and 500 are permanent.  For spam you probably want
to use 550.

found "Anjuta" to be a fairly decent (and free) IDE
for building and maintaining projects.  Its pretty
flexible as far as what you can use for make files and
autoconf.  I haven't used KDevelop at all, so I can't
really compare them.  Anyone??

Wil,

  That's what I've seen in the access file here. According to my book,

450	Requested mail action not taken: mailbox unavailable

550	Requested action not taken: mailbox unavailable

  Nothing in the text regarding temporary or permanent.

  Really doesn't matter to me, I'm just curious as I build my own list of IP
addresses and blocks to bounce.

Thanks,

Rich

I've played with KDevelop a little bit and it's pretty good.  There's even
a nice tutorial that steps you through creating your first GUI app.  You
create your widgets in Qt Designer, which are then saved as XML and
imported into KDevelop.

However, I do remember reading articles (on slashdot maybe?) that talked 
about IDE and compiler vendors imposing specific licensing on code 
developed in their products. I thought MS was one of those that did this.

Of course, the preceding is all theory, and none of it has been 
substantiated in any way.

Matt,

  Sigh. No. It's running as user postfix. No wonder it can't write to a file
owned by root. D'oh! And the log file is writable only by the owner, not the
other members of the group 'mail'.

Danke!

But did you configure it to use SSL?  Try checking out your

And procmail runs SGID mail (at least, it /should/ be), so
since the file is already group mail, just chmod g+w.

Just to be pedantic, I don't think those are covered by the GNU GPL.
I am too lazy to check though, so I hope I am correct on that.  It is
so embarrassing to be pedantic if you turn out to be wrong.

Anjuta rocks....

I've used Kdevelop also...

They are both good for Console C/C++ editing, and each is good with their 
respective GUI heritage (KDevelop->Qt/KDE && Anjuta->Gnome/GTK/etc.)

I have also found Jedit [http://www.jedit.org] to be very cool, when coding 
in languages other than C/C++, there are numerous plugins available, 
including a Jython interpreter (Pure Java implementation of Python), XML 
utilities, etc...completely Open Source Java...too....

but then again there is always Gvim :-)

Wow, thats cool.  This is the sort of thing that would work well at my 
high school (Merlo Station) which doesn't want to use the thin client
architecture (since we have lots of high powered workstations already),
but doesn't want to do fat client architecture either (not w/ Linux
anyway, because that would require configuration of Linux on tons of
machines).  Too bad K12LTSP didn't have an option to work like this.

Rich,

>From RFC 1893 which defined the error codes:

 The class sub-code provides a broad classification of the status.
   The enumerated values the class are defined as:

    2.X.X   Success

       Success specifies that the DSN is reporting a positive delivery
       action.  Detail sub-codes may provide notification of
       transformations required for delivery.

    4.X.X   Persistent Transient Failure

       A persistent transient failure is one in which the message as
       sent is valid, but some temporary event prevents the successful
       sending of the message.  Sending in the future may be successful.

    5.X.X   Permanent Failure

       A permanent failure is one which is not likely to be resolved by
       resending the message in the current form.  Some change to the
       message or the destination must be made for successful delivery.

This may be covered in an appendix of the book you have.

Oops.  The Apache stuff is, in fact, not GPL'd. 
JBoss, however, is under the LGPL, which I believe is
similar enough to the GPL for this thread.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205091001040.14084-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I know we have some X Window System gurus here. As I read how to install
Type1 fonts within AbiWord, I discover that I have Type1 fonts in three
different directories here:

	/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1
	/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/ISO8859-2/Type1
	/usr/share/fonts/default/Type1

  The first one is the one listed as one of the fontpaths in
/etc/X11/XF86config.

  My questions, guru(s) are these:

	1) Why might there be three different directories used?

	2) Is it practical to combine all the Type1 fonts in the first
	directory only and eliminate the others? It seem rather wasteful to
	me to have the same fonts -- or different ones for that matter --
	splayed out in different places.

Thanks,

Rich

  I guess that I'm really confused. Aren't all the virii running around the
'Net and within sites exclusively affecting Microsoft OSes and applications?
And aren't they all written with Microsoft development tools? If one were to
argue this in a court, it should be easily provable that the open source
names they cite in the EULA don't contain, propagate or nurture virii.
However, ... Microsoft is regularly infested; consider the "odd spam" thread
of the past couple of days.

  Just like Alice in Wonderland, we've entered a place where logic and
rationality are suspended and words mean only what Microsoft says they mean.

The first is there because that's where the X install puts them.

The other two are there because the folks building packages for your
package management system had different ideas about where they belong.

Personally, I'd symlink 'em.  No reason to modify paths that might be
hardcoded somewhere.

Microsoft started using this terminology awhile back, presumably because
of the negative conotations of "virus".  Their stated meaning when using
this type of reference is that the "license" of your software has been
"infected" by the use of any GPL like software in your code, because of
course once you use GPL'd stuff in your code, you can't use a more
restrictive license for the software until you remove the GPL stuff.
When all else fails, confuse the heck out of people!

Well, not like anybody really cares what I think, but I strongly supported
that decision.  That so-called anti-spam bill was so broadly written, it
could (and presumably would) have been used to strike down all kinds of
private, non-commercial speech and still would have allowed certain big
companies to do what they please.

As with most attempts to violate first amendment rights, the real target
was labor organization and political dissidents.

Subject: [PLUG] RH 7.2 Question on rc.local
Message-ID: <3CDAB8FC.DA1DA4EF@computer-arts.net>

Running Red Hat 7.2. 
Starting up virual interfaces in rc.local
When named comes up, it's random whether it's listening to all the
interfaces or not. I end up needing to restart named after I reboot
to get it to listen on all of them.

Named is turned on at run levels: 3, 4, and 5
chkconfig --list named
named    0:off   1:off   2:off   3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off

I'm a little unclear about how to determine the correct run levels.
I was just following an example in the book :-)

Do I have the wrong run levels set for named?  Or, is rc.local the
wrong place to add virtual interfaces?

-Mike

I'm waiting for a Redhat 7.3 channel on Ximian to come up before I
upgrade to 7.3; it's inevitable and probably coming soon.  FWIW If I
were you, I'd probably use a different mail client under 7.3 (like
mozilla) until the Ximian channel update, then use evolution again.

I had ximian and life was good, then I did the upgraded. 

Redhat 7.3 Evolution would not allow me to read my mail, nice hang when
trying to fetch the mail from the local machine,  nice hang to  lock the
window mangers focus. 

After downloading the source rpm, I found that new evolution will not
build on rh 7.3 environment. It requires the old sleepy cat db3 3.1.17
version to build. 


Redhat gets around this by rebuilding db3 3.1.17 in evolution build dir.

But I think that there is a bug, also debugging evolution with it 10 or
so process does not look like fun. 

Has anyone been able to pull down their mail in a redhat 7.3 box with
pop, and been able to read mail ??

I'm sure there are other places to find this, but one convenient place is
the configure help for the kernel (/usr/src/linux/Documentation/Configure.help)
.

nls iso8859-9
CONFIG_NLS_ISO8859_9
  If you want to display filenames with native language characters
  from the Microsoft fat filesystem family or from JOLIET CDROMs
  correctly on the screen, you need to include the appropriate
  input/output character sets. Say Y here for the Latin 5 character
  set, and it replaces the rarely needed Icelandic letters in Latin 1
  with the Turkish ones. Useful in Turkey.

  Oh. Well, it's been so long since I last spoke (or read) either Icelandic

Hmmm.  thanks.

Also these boxes do not really have a registered fqdn yet.  Could that be
causing probs too.

Apache2 has a httpd.conf and an ssl.conf  .  I am still trying to wrap
myself around this concept.  I find no mention of ssl.conf in any docs.

More fun.

I think we should all start modifying our licenses to define
"Analicious and Coprophagous" software to mean "proprietary" or
"non-free" or, ahem, "closed-source" software.  If you can just
make up terms and define them in legal documents for marketing
purposes, we should do it too, just for fun.  Oh, and we should
define "Ooogly Ooogly Orgasmic" software to mean free software.
Doesn't that sound fun?

Wil,

  Your first term does have a certain retentive sense to it, but your second
term is a valid one. Coprophagy is exhibited by rabbits, marine worms and
many freshwater aquatic insects. I know because my doctoral dissertation was
on "The Role of Aquatic Insect Feces on Stream Ecosystem Energetics". Known
among the denizens of the lab as the "feces thesis". And, yes, I heard all
the puns -- many times. :-)

  I guess it was this work that prepared me to deal with regulators and
politicians so well.

Yes, I know.  A synonym is 'stercophagous'.  Another word I'm fond
of is 'stercoriculous' (I think I spelled it correctly), meaning
"living in dung".  Did you ever burn your thesis?  The smell of
burning theses is horrible...

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205091649170.20710-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  The reason I could not rebuild the src.rpm for gtk+-1.2.10 was that
gtk+-1.2 will not build with the newest versions of automake. Really. I had
to force the downgrade from automake-1.6.1 to automake-1.4 in order to
rebuild the package.

  Has anyone else experienced such a situation? I thought all development
tools were backwards compatible.

Attached is the httpd.conf from "drizzle.pdxlinux.org".  Perhaps it will
prove to be instructional.


-------------- next part --------------
## -*- apache -*-

##
## httpd.conf -- Apache HTTP server configuration file
##

#
# Based upon the NCSA server configuration files originally by Rob McCool.
#
# This is the main Apache server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See <URL:http://www.apache.org/docs/> for detailed information about
# the directives.
#
# Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
# what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
# consult the online docs. You have been warned.  
#
# After this file is processed, the server will look for and process
# /etc/apache/srm.conf and then /etc/apache/access.conf
# unless you have overridden these with ResourceConfig and/or
# AccessConfig directives here.
#
# The configuration directives are grouped into three basic sections:
#  1. Directives that control the operation of the Apache server process as a
#     whole (the 'global environment').
#  2. Directives that define the parameters of the 'main' or 'default' server,
#     which responds to requests that aren't handled by a virtual host.
#     These directives also provide default values for the settings
#     of all virtual hosts.
#  3. Settings for virtual hosts, which allow Web requests to be sent to
#     different IP addresses or hostnames and have them handled by the
#     same Apache server process.
#
# Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many
# of the server's control files begin with "/" (or "drive:/" for Win32), the
# server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin
# with "/", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so "logs/foo.log"
# with ServerRoot set to "/usr/local/apache" will be interpreted by the
# server as "/usr/local/apache/logs/foo.log".
#

### Section 1: Global Environment
#
# The directives in this section affect the overall operation of Apache,
# such as the number of concurrent requests it can handle or where it
# can find its configuration files.
#

#
# ServerType is either inetd, or standalone.  Inetd mode is only supported on
# Unix platforms.
#
ServerType standalone

#
# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
# configuration, error, and log files are kept, unless they are specified
# with an absolute path.
#
# NOTE!  If you intend to place this on an NFS (or otherwise network)
# mounted filesystem then please read the LockFile documentation
# (available at <URL:http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#lockfile>);
# you will save yourself a lot of trouble.
#
# Do NOT add a slash at the end of the directory path.
#
ServerRoot /etc/apache

#
# The LockFile directive sets the path to the lockfile used when Apache
# is compiled with either USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT or
# USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT. This directive should normally be left at
# its default value. The main reason for changing it is if the logs
# directory is NFS mounted, since the lockfile MUST BE STORED ON A LOCAL
# DISK. The PID of the main server process is automatically appended to
# the filename. 
#
LockFile /var/lock/apache.lock

#
# PidFile: The file in which the server should record its process
# identification number when it starts.
#
PidFile /var/run/apache.pid

#
# ScoreBoardFile: File used to store internal server process information.
# Not all architectures require this.  But if yours does (you'll know because
# this file will be  created when you run Apache) then you *must* ensure that
# no two invocations of Apache share the same scoreboard file.
#
ScoreBoardFile /var/run/apache.scoreboard

#
# In the standard configuration, the server will process this file,
# srm.conf, and access.conf in that order.  The latter two files are
# now distributed empty, as it is recommended that all directives
# be kept in a single file for simplicity.  The commented-out values
# below are the built-in defaults.  You can have the server ignore
# these files altogether by using "/dev/null" (for Unix) or
# "nul" (for Win32) for the arguments to the directives.
#
#ResourceConfig /etc/apache/srm.conf
#AccessConfig /etc/apache/access.conf

#
# Timeout: The number of seconds before receives and sends time out.
#
Timeout 300

#
# KeepAlive: Whether or not to allow persistent connections (more than
# one request per connection). Set to "Off" to deactivate.
#
KeepAlive On

#
# MaxKeepAliveRequests: The maximum number of requests to allow
# during a persistent connection. Set to 0 to allow an unlimited amount.
# We recommend you leave this number high, for maximum performance.
#
MaxKeepAliveRequests 100

#
# KeepAliveTimeout: Number of seconds to wait for the next request from the
# same client on the same connection.
#
KeepAliveTimeout 15

#
# Server-pool size regulation.  Rather than making you guess how many
# server processes you need, Apache dynamically adapts to the load it
# sees --- that is, it tries to maintain enough server processes to
# handle the current load, plus a few spare servers to handle transient
# load spikes (e.g., multiple simultaneous requests from a single
# Netscape browser).
#
# It does this by periodically checking how many servers are waiting
# for a request.  If there are fewer than MinSpareServers, it creates
# a new spare.  If there are more than MaxSpareServers, some of the
# spares die off.  The default values are probably OK for most sites.
#
MinSpareServers 5
MaxSpareServers 10

#
# Number of servers to start initially --- should be a reasonable ballpark
# figure.
#
StartServers 5

#
# Limit on total number of servers running, i.e., limit on the number
# of clients who can simultaneously connect --- if this limit is ever
# reached, clients will be LOCKED OUT, so it should NOT BE SET TOO LOW.
# It is intended mainly as a brake to keep a runaway server from taking
# the system with it as it spirals down...
#
MaxClients 150

#
# MaxRequestsPerChild: the number of requests each child process is
# allowed to process before the child dies.  The child will exit so
# as to avoid problems after prolonged use when Apache (and maybe the
# libraries it uses) leak memory or other resources.  On most systems, this
# isn't really needed, but a few (such as Solaris) do have notable leaks
# in the libraries. For these platforms, set to something like 10000
# or so; a setting of 0 means unlimited.
#
# NOTE: This value does not include keepalive requests after the initial
#       request per connection. For example, if a child process handles
#       an initial request and 10 subsequent "keptalive" requests, it
#       would only count as 1 request towards this limit.
#
MaxRequestsPerChild 100

#
# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
# ports, in addition to the default. See also the <VirtualHost>
# directive.
#
#Listen 3000
#Listen 12.34.56.78:80

#
# BindAddress: You can support virtual hosts with this option. This directive
# is used to tell the server which IP address to listen to. It can either
# contain "*", an IP address, or a fully qualified Internet domain name.
# See also the <VirtualHost> and Listen directives.

### Section 2: 'Main' server configuration
#
# The directives in this section set up the values used by the 'main'
# server, which responds to any requests that aren't handled by a
# <VirtualHost> definition.  These values also provide defaults for
# any <VirtualHost> containers you may define later in the file.
#
# All of these directives may appear inside <VirtualHost> containers,
# in which case these default settings will be overridden for the
# virtual host being defined.
#

#
# If your ServerType directive (set earlier in the 'Global Environment'
# section) is set to "inetd", the next few directives don't have any
# effect since their settings are defined by the inetd configuration.
# Skip ahead to the ServerAdmin directive.
#

#
# Port: The port to which the standalone server listens. For
# ports < 1023, you will need apache to be run as root initially.
#
Port 80

#
# If you wish apache to run as a different user or group, you must run
# apacheas root initially and it will switch.  
#
# User/Group: The name (or #number) of the user/group to run apache as.
#  . On SCO (ODT 3) use "User nouser" and "Group nogroup".
#  . On HPUX you may not be able to use shared memory as nobody, and the
#    suggested workaround is to create a user www and use that user.
#  NOTE that some kernels refuse to setgid(Group) or semctl(IPC_SET)
#  when the value of (unsigned)Group is above 60000; 
#  don't use Group nobody on these systems!
#
User www-data
Group www-data

# ServerAdmin: Your address, where problems with the server should be
# e-mailed.  This address appears on some server-generated pages, such
# as error documents.
#
ServerAdmin webmaster at pdxlinux.org

#
# ServerName: allows you to set a host name which is sent back to clients for
# your server if it's different than the one the program would get (i.e., use
# "www" instead of the host's real name).
#
# Note: You cannot just invent host names and hope they work. The name you 
# define here must be a valid DNS name for your host. If you don't understand
# this, ask your network administrator.
# If your host doesn't have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.
# You will have to access it by its address (e.g., http://123.45.67.89/)

  Thanks, Karl. I just built and installed apache-2.0.35 and I'm rather
overwhelmed by the documentation and what I need to know. So, while I'm
starting with the Laurie^2 ORA book ("Apache - The Definitive Guide") the

I've considered attempting this with my Linksys BEFSR41 Cable/DSL Router as 
well.  I haven't spent the time to do it, for a few reasons - I have one 
dynamic IP address that AT&T's cable internet service seems to think needs to 
be changed every week, because "assigning static IP addresses has become 
increasingly cumbersome."

Here are a few problems to consider while attempting this.

1)	En route, other routers will NOT pass private-use IP addresses (i.e, 
192.168.x.y).  They will immediately be dropped, unless you drag a LONG cable 
along with you connected directly to your router.   You really need a minimum 
of two static public IP addresses to do this with standard ppp - one for the 
client and one for the host.  PPTP might be something to look into, but I'm 
unsure if the Linksys router supports this, nor have I had the time to muddle 
through PPTP.  I'm sure Cisco's support it ($$).

> My questions, before I begin are: will this allow me to interface with

You need to be explicit with packet forwarding in the Linksys router to meet 
your particular network., otherwise you'll just be interfacing with the 
router.

You won't be able to do this.  You will only be able to refresh the DHCP 
client (your router) locally, not remotely.  It sounds like you've got 
cable-modem access that delivers your router a dynamic IP address 
periodically.  This is not desirable for a ppp host.

Absolutely!  It'd be a waste of memory to run DHCP for a single client.

I think the original poster was planning on setting up a dialup PPP 
server which sits inside the private network. When a client dials in, 
it is assigned a valid, private, IP address through PPP and is then 
part of the internal 192.168.x.x network. Once the client has an IP 
address that is part of the private network it can access the router at 
192.168.1.1. 

There are no routing issues with private IP addresses and a second 
public IP address isn't needed since the client system will be routing 
packets directly to the PPP dialup server.

It costs money. Linux nerds are cheap, and would rather endlessly tweak a 
hunk of funky free software than pay for something that works. I'm sure I'm 
not the only one who has observed right here on the PLUG list the lengthy 
discussions of returning some defective widget to Fry's eleventy-nine times 
because it was a buck cheaper. And still feeling happy at saving that buck.

If anyone is seriously using Kylix, I'd like to know. It's a lovely product. 
What happened to Borland, anyway? In my estimable opinion, they've always 
produced superior IDEs and RADs. They should rule the developer world.

I have had to return crap to Fry's before too.  Gotta be careful what
you buy there.  NEVER buy generic RAM there.

I bet it's not uncommon to spend $5 additional gas with a couple trips
plus all the time spent to "save" money.

I heard it was good, I guess since I haven't considered buying it
really, I have never priced it.  It's probably only applicable to the
company that is going to develop a Win/Linux suite.  My friend Mike
loves Delphi.

  After they bought Wizard C in 1986 and turned it into Turbo C in 1987 to
join Turbo Pascal they went downhill. They changed their name, tried to
re-invent themselves, got lost in the tall grass and then tried to jump on
the linux bandwagon. I think they missed and fell under the wheels.

Subject: [PLUG] Partitioning advice for development Linux database server
Message-ID: <01C1F7D6.4EF055C0.jorgens@coho.net>

Hi all,

I've just finished my manual hardware inventory on the box I want to use 
for my database server, and now it's time to install Linux.  I'll be 
running several database server services on it (not usually all running at 
once), but the primary concern for now is Oracle.  I'm planning to keep the 
box light on UI, probably no X at all.

Before I start installing the OS, I'd like to get some input on the best 
way to partition the drives for this system.  It's a development and 
learning system, not a production system, so I'll want to lean towards 
flexibility and ease of management, but still pay still some basic 
attention to performance issues, if for no other reason than to learn more 
about what they are.

The box in question has
	one 9GB, 10,000 RPM, 8.2 ms avg. seek, fast/wide SCSI-2 drive (and 
fast/wide SCSI controller)
	and one 1.75GB, 5400 RPM, 10ms avg. seek IDE drive.

Specific questions:
1. In what path do most database server packages normally put data files by 
default?  Obviously, I'll want that to be fairly big and choose the 
partition's filesystem carefully.
2. What are some other considerations on what and how many partitions to 
use on this box and what filesystems to use on each?  I'm leaning toward a 
journaling filesystem, and I guess EXT3 is an obvious choice, but is it 
considered well tested and trustworthy yet?
3. Are there any other questions I might be forgetting to ask before I 
install Linux on this box?

Hey there...

For homework, I had to come up with a Marketing Spec for a product
(which I also had to think up).  If anyone has knowledge of Marketing
Specs or Anti-Virus stuff, would you mind taking a look at this and
telling me what ya think?  (Its both my first marketing spec and
antivirus project).  BTW, if it isn't obvious very quickly... this is
supposed to be more humorous than realistic. ;)

oh and thanks, Wil, for the word "Coprophagous". ;)

Here it is:

<------------------ marketing spec ------------------>

The GNU Anti Virus: Marketing Spec.

With this computer application, users of the GNU/Linux system will have
a fully featured Anti Virus system, capable of detecting,
incapacitating, quarantining, and removing dangerous viruses from the
computer system.

Usability Features include:

* Intuitive graphical user interface.
* Ability to handle all known viruses effecting the Linux OS!
        It can:
        * Detect all known viruses.
        * Incapacitate any viruses found.
        * Quarantine the virus for further (safe) examination.
        * Remove the viruses.
        * Repair virus infected files to their pre-virus state.
* Ability to download current virus definitions over the internet.
* Ability to detect and deal with the "Coprophagous" family of viruses
from 3.1 to XP, which were once thought untreatable!
 

Design (Advanced) Features include:

* Extensible design allows for new Anti-Virus logic to be added on the
fly.
* Modular design allows the program to change how it works over time,
   which means that it can be adapted to handle new kinds of viruses.
* Secure design ensures that the GNU Anti-Virus will not itself be
   infested by viruses, but if it is, it still will not harm the system
   (since it doesn't run as root).
* GNU Anti-Virus is Open Source, which means advanced users can inspect
how Anti-Virus works and see that it isn't a virus itself! ;)

Josh,

  I believe that this is a problem with nfs, and I've had the same problem
for a while now, too. When I reboot one of my machines it does not
automatically mount the three exported file systems from the other
workstation.

  After I get a prompt, I log in as root, mount the filesystmes via nfs (by
simply typing 'mount /mnt/usrx' where the x is 2, 3, and 4. Then I log out
and log back in as a user. For as little as I reboot, it works. Oh, another
thing: on the rebooted server I have to explicitly stop then start nfs to
enable the other workstation to communicate with its nfs-mounted filesystems
exported by the rebooted workstation. Yes, nfs supposedly was invoked during
the boot process, but ....

HTH,

Rich

I'm considering purchasing an Apple iBook M8577LL/C running OS X and am
curious if anyone has experience with Apple's OS X cohabiting with Linux.
I've been exclusively a Slackware user for several years now, and will
install Slackware or other Linux as an alternate OS. Since OS X is billed
as being BSD based, does this mean I'm likely to have a reasonably
trouble-free install of Linux on the same hardware? Would another distro
of Linux be more at home? (Please, no distro-wars.) Can the two systems be

Subject: [PLUG] Bit by the AbiWord fonts gotcha!
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205100638400.12958-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I know this thread has come up before, but I cannot find the mail list
archives from the web site.

  Installed AbiWord-1.0.1. Moved all its fonts to
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1 and made a symlink fron the directory where
AbiWord put them. Now, I like everyone else who's installed AbiWord, find a
difficult-to-read, san-serif font in mozilla-0.9.7.

  IIRC, the solution was to "remove the AbiWord fonts". But, what does this
do to AbiWord, then? I've not yet figured out how to make the other Type1
fonts I have visible/usable in AbiWord, but I would like to be able, once
again, to easily read web pages.

  What have others done to allow the two apps to co-exist?

Thanks,

Rich

You can debug a lot of this kind of thing using the openssl binary. 
Assuming that your https port is 443, try

  openssl s_client -connect localhost:443

You should get back lots of ascii letting you know what's happening.

/var.  Here's the layout from a db server I just built that has a
pair of 4G disks, configured as RAID1 with Red Hat 7.2:

$ df -h
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/md2              288M  154M  119M  57% /
/dev/md4               23M   13M  9.3M  57% /boot
/dev/md3              190M   20M  160M  11% /home
/dev/md1              1.4G  457M  943M  33% /usr
/dev/md0              1.8G  106M  1.6G   6% /var

/usr could probably have been smaller, but I didn't want to give
myself problems upgrading in the future.  In other recent builds
I've done, I've made /tmp a pair of separate 32MB partitions,
configured as RAID0 (stripe), so it's 64MB (mine ext3 journal).

Pretty much so.

You might ask yourself why the hell you're putting an IDE drive

I think you'd have a hard time getting Slackware to go. You probably ought
to look first at Yellowdog. I've been busting my butt getting it to install
on an old Powerbook but seeing as I'm such a Mac novice, I'm having a hard
time. You'd probably fare better since I bet it's real easy to get an iBook
to boot off the CD.

I don't know about co-habitation. I'm sure you can do it, but, again, I'm a
real Mac greenie and I don't know at all how to partition the drives to get
one or the other to boot.

I've no direct experience, but I do recall a recent O'Reilly Net article
by Edd Dumbill outlining his experience installing Debian alongside OS X
on his new iBook. Apparently it was a pretty painless process.

IIRC, this is no longer the case. The modem now appears to be the
standard "win-modem" style.

I've heard that automake-1.6 isn't suitable for the

be something wrong with it.

As far as the modem, "analog" refers to its non-digital nature, and every 
true modem is analog. DSL, ISDN and Cable "modems" are not true modems. 
They speak in digital.

WinModems are just as analog as non-WinModems.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205101055320.13469-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  Yesterday I configured built and intstalled apache-2.0.35. I placed the
source code on another host, but worked across the network to the
nfs-mounted filesystem. I mistakenly thought that the executables and
associated files would be installed on that host. Instead, they are
installed on the machine where I work.

  In httpd.conf I see a reference to taking care with lockfiles if the data
are stored on a nfs-mounted filesystem but the processes are running
locally. Based on your experience, is this much of a hassle to configure and
run or would I be better off removing the binaries and support files from
this box and re-installing directly from the other box.

  Because that host has much more room on the hard drives, that's where I
want the sites to be located.

TIA,

Rich

Hmm, I tried those but it didn't work. The nfs server hasn't been
rebooted, I just had to unmount the filesystem and remount it somewhere
else. Since it's telling me that the address is already in use, it makes
me think that I need to convince the nfs server that my client is not
already connected. 
Strangely enough, when I use Mandrake's tool, diskdrake, it mounts and
unmounts just fine. The problem here is that the client is a Red Hat
machine with totally different tools. Red Hat's disk configurator tool
(whatever the hell it's called - I found it in the gnome menu) doesn't
do the trick. Maybe Mandrake's tool uses a different command than mount
-a or maybe gives another command before mounting? I can't find the
source for it and strace didn't give me anything I could use.

I just found the following internet sight: 
http://basic.wirehub.nl/spamstats.html

They offer a list (2 megs in size!) of known spammers. They appear to have 
some intelligence to this, and make it available via rsync, wget, and 
fetch. It's updated (they say) 48 times a day.

Has anyone used this? If so, is it effective?

I just put a script together to update my access.db for postfix. First, 
copy your existing plain text copy of /etc/postfix/access to 
/etc/postfix/access.local. Then run the following script:

#!/bin/sh
#
# Download spamlist from http://basic.wirehub.nl/spamlist-extended.txt
# Cat local list and spamlist into /etc/postfix/access
# update /etc/postfix/access.db

cd /etc/postfix

         wget http://basic.wirehub.nl/spamlist-extended.txt

         echo "Something is wrong. spamlist-extended.txt exists in the

I noticed that I already had five domains listed that they had. These throw

  I wonder if something's stuck in memory. I've sometimes had to restart the
network and nfs on the 'client' machine to make things work, too. NFS is
apparently a rather fragile system that's easily spooked by the tides.

  Got me there. I run only Red Hat so I'm unfamiliar with all other
distributions.

If you want to run NFS reliably, you need to be running current tools.
Check out nfs.sourceforge.net.

Quick Setup Guide:

   1. Get a current distro of linux
   2. Get the 2.2.19 or any 2.4 kernel source file; Earlier 2.2 sources will 
require patching.
   3. Unarchive the sources
   4. If using 2.2.18 or less, apply the dhiggin_merge kernel patches which 
can be found here or here.
   5. Build Kernel with NFS support, including NFS Version 3 server support
   6. Install the latest nfs-utils, available as a tar ball from the same 
sites as the kernel patches.
      (you can make them as an rpm with rpm -ta nfs-utils.tar.gz)
   7. If using 2.2.18 or less, you must replace or rebuild the mount command; 
The latest rpm is available here, but if you use earlier sources you must 
patch them with the fixes found here
   8. Disable/erase any old nfs startup utilities

Russ,

  That's every half-hour; impressive.

  I've a few addresses in /etc/postfix/access.db, mainly those from Asia who
persistently spam. In the past few days since I got postfix running my spam
level has dropped almost to zero. The ones coming through are single users
(probably dialup) spoofing the domain name but coming through aol.com,
yahoo.com and hotmail.com.

  I thought that the header_checks and body_checks would take care of these
one-off types of spammers. That is, that the key words they tend to use
would be trapped by one or the other of those lists.

  What is the advantage of regularly updating access.db versus tuning the
*_checks files?

Thanks,

Rich

Because it's good to have more than one physical drive, and that's a drive 
I have.  If this were a production server, I would have a budget to set up 
a SCSI RAID system that would have no use for IDE, but I have no budget now 
for this at-home study system.  Valid reasoning?

I was planning to use the IDE drive primarily as archival storage space 
(compressed image of a recent stable system state before I mess it up doing 
something stupid), and possibly for the swap partition as well, since that 
would reduce thrashing on the other drive if swapping occurs.

Thanks very much for your help, Wil!

That's not true. DSL and ISDN operate over analog telephone circuits.
Remove the little filter(s) that come with your DSL modem and you'll
probably be able to hear the carrier. Cable modems use an RF carrier,
still analog. Theory of operation and carrier frequencies are
definitely different from your standard modem, but they're still
analog.

That's like calling ethernet analog because it operates over copper. The 
equipment at either end (the DSL transceiver and DSLAM) are sending digital 
signals to each other. They share the wire that analog signals traverse, 
but they ignore those signals as out of band noise.

I'm not as familiar with cable as DSL, but I was under the impression that 
it operates in much the same way, which is why you needed to be upgraded to 
the new (digital) head end at the cable company to be able to get either 
digital cable, cable phone, or cable modem.

Russ,

  I was getting more spam/day before I set up postfix here and had a
lower-number MX record inserted into the ISPs dns servers. Neither procmail
recipes nor spamassassin worked well; the latter I did not get properly
running. Spam here comes in quanta: some days none, some days a bunch.

  /var/log/maillog makes interesting reading. I don't see a message saying
"reject" or "bounce", but I see connections opened and closed with no action
in between.
 
> Hmm, I just found a header_check.txt file on the net that looks to be up to

  On the postfix web site there are three or four example files that were
contributed. I combined those as the base of my files.
 
> Looks like they do very similar jobs. Probably not to bad of an idea to

  After reading through some of the extended list I understand the
advantages of both. I just used rsync to grab the spamlist-extended and
incorporated it with my base list. We'll see what happens now.

Thanks,

Rich

If you're planning on using RedHat 7.3, you might want to read:

   http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2002-085.html

"Kernel panic on SMP systems with ext3 file systems ..."

(I didn't notice what system board/processor setup you're using, 
it sounds like uni-processor systems are not at risk.)

The purpose of the DSLAM is to aggregate the DSL circuits and transfer
the digital content to a frame-relay setup inside the phone company.
The data is then delivered to the ISP over standard T-1 or better.
Standard voice circuits use bandpass filters to eliminate anything
over 2Khz. DSL takes advantage of that by using carriers at higher
frequencies.

You can run your own DSL circuit without a DSLAM by getting a dry
pair (like an alarm circuit) between two locations and putting a
DSL modem at each end. Bob Cringley described such a setup in one
of his columns. <http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20010823.html>

Regular modems are sending digital data to each other, too. It's just
modulated on top of an audio carrier. In fact, that's what "mo-dem"
is from - modulator/demodulator.

I'm not familiar enough with ethernet to say for certain, but I thought
ethernet line drivers directly drove the wires with the digital signal,
rather than encoding it onto a carrier.

That's the point. There isn't a "carrier" with DSL. It's all signal. And 
digital to boot. What you "hear" when you remove the filter is the signal, 
not a carrier. The DSL "modem" isn't modulating or demodulating. It's 
converting one digital signal (the DSL signal) into another (ethernet 
frames) and vice versa.

It was an example. The original argument seemed to say, "It's on voice 
lines, so it must be analog". I extended this to include the fact that 
voice lines are also (usually) copper.

Thanks.  The system will be single processor, and SuSE 7.3, so should be safe.

Thanks, I'm in the process of going through it right now, it looks like
it should work OK to get to the router.  That is the main goal.  That
way if Charter goes out for a little while and doesn't come back up, I
can hit the router "internally" and do a DHCP release/renew.  I imagine
that unless I set the box as a gateway, it will not let me access the
internet since the router is not going to hand out another IP - it's a
basic router, not bad for the price and what you get, but basic.

I'll report back on how this goes.

I will need to limit logons for only members of a certain group, but I
imagine that's documented.  That way only myself, and a couple other
guys can zap in to reset things should the need arise.  This is hardly a
professional application of all this, but we just want to make the most
reliable setup out of what we have.

I think the original poster was planning on setting up a dialup PPP 
server which sits inside the private network. When a client dials in, 
it is assigned a valid, private, IP address through PPP and is then 
part of the internal 192.168.x.x network. Once the client has an IP 
address that is part of the private network it can access the router at 
192.168.1.1. 

There are no routing issues with private IP addresses and a second 
public IP address isn't needed since the client system will be routing 
packets directly to the PPP dialup server.

I think you want to ground yourself.  I frequently walk back into my
office and zap myself *on the desk*, not electrically in contact with
the mouse or anything attached to the computer at all, and my mouse
stops working.  I just Ctrl-Alt-F1, Ctrl-Alt-F7 and I am golden
again.  During the winter, when I become zap-shy from repeated
discharges, I make a point of discharging to a door frame before I get
near my desk.  And, actually, I've found particle board seems to have
good electrical properties for draining away voltage accumulations
without the spark.

Dick,
  I'm no expert on static, but I've always found that grounding myself
rather than the equipment is more effective - as you're the thing that's
all charged up and it's you discharging when you feel that shock.  (that
and the computer case is probably already grounded if your outlets are
up to code).  When I have static problems I'd always touch somthing
that's grounded and not near a computer.

  Some years ago now the shoes that I'd often wear to work would act
like highly efficient Van de Graf (sp?) generators when I walked across
the office carpet.  Spraying a little "anti-static spray" that I found
in the storeroom on the soles of my shoes one day practicly turned them
into grounded ESD mats.  I have no idea what that stuff was actually
meant for, I doubt it was for the soles of shoes but it turned out to be
well suited for the task.  And it was quite durable too: despite walking
around the office all day (I was the errand boy) and to and from the
bus, I only needed a spritz or two every week.

When the computer resets, is it only because you touched the mouse or the 
desk?  Does your keyboard have a metal chassis?  (Old IBM's do).

Make sure your outlet is properly grounded.  A plug-in tester is available 
in any hardware store.  (3-prong plug with 3 neon lamps inside).  If that 
checks out, the computer chassis is grounded as well.  I'm guessing that 
it's grounded just fine--that's why you're discharging through the 
computer's power supply.

There's anti-static spray you could use on the carpet, but it might be bad 
for pets and/or humans.  You could put an anti-static mat under your 
keyboard (should connect to the outlet ground w/a wire) and touch that first.

Dick,

  Back in the early- to mid-1980s a lot of keyboards and systems were fried
by static electricity. During that period I bought a grounding mat that sits
under the keyboard, and I always touched that before touching any part of a
computer. Now that mat is in front of the monitor, but the keyboard is on a
pull-out support in front of the desk. I still touch either that mat or the
metal file cabinet next to the desk whenever I return to the desk and before
I touch the keyboard, trackball or anything else. After 20 years it's just
reflex.

  To directly answer your question: yes. Ground everything. And make it a
practice to touch a grounded metal table leg when you sit down. Also, buy
some Downy fabric softener, dilute it 1:4 or 1:5 with water, then spray it
on the carpet. Prevents static buildup. We used to do this in the office
until the early 1990s.

  Steelcase chairs are worth every dollar! I have one from 1985 and another
that I bought in 1995. I can sit in them for 12 or more hours a day without
pain or tiredness. They're great!

The issue at hand is bonding. Grounding and bonding are closely related, 
but different. Grounding is more about power, bonding keeps everything at 
the same potential, eliminating static discharges. Static discharges can be 
fatal for hardware at levels you can't even feel.

I'd run a wire from the computer case to any metal surfaces handy, then to 
a touch strip, like a metal edge on anything that's in your entry path to 
the area. Sprays work, but they wear off. It only takes one good zap to do 
hardware in. You might look for an ESD chair mat. I'll have to look for a 
picture I have of the plastic blown "clean off" the substrate of a 14 pin 
chip from static.

Subject: [PLUG] Plug For Education Meeting - Saturday 5/18
Message-ID: <1021094615.28453.30.camel@homepc>

Hello Folks,

It seems like a long time ago now that the first Plug for Education
meetings happened. I think we've done a lot since then. Plug members
have been an active part of the monthly GNU/Linux Install Clinics and
have played an active role on the K12Linux listservs answering questions
and helping to promote free software in schools.

If you've been following recent Slashdot posts for the last month or so
you'll know that PNW schools are being audited by Microsoft and that
many are now very interested in using open source software. Now more
than ever we have a chance to help schools provide reliable technologies
for classrooms at a reasonable cost.

I'd like to float an idea out to the list and suggest that we discuss it
on-line and meet for a session or two as well.

Here's the idea: July 4th - Software Freedom Day - All over the USA

I'd like to see us help LUGs in cities all over the country establish
supportive relationships with schools like the one our schools enjoy.
I'd like to celebrate the collaboration with an open house type of event
on the morning of July 4th. The basic idea is to get LUGs to plan an
event with the help of interested school/s to demonstrate the successes
of using GPL software in schools.

Outcomes would be improved relationships between LUGs and schools where
they don't exist right now, good PR for both groups and an increased
support base both locally and on-line for schools migrating towards open
source software.

The event would be for a couple of hours on the morning of July 4th and
be over in time for people to still enjoy other traditional activities.

Frankly, I think PLUG has its act together more than most LUGs and we'd
be good ones to pull this off. We'd need to do up the PR and provide
"event kits" that other LUGs and schools could download and use. I think
we can do it. What do you think?

Let's toss out some limited discussion on the list and then I'd suggest
meeting for a brown bag lunch at the next Linux Clinic which is next
weekend on the 18th. I am sensitive to the list traffic this might
generate so feel free to email me directly or bring your ideas to the
12:00 meeting on Sat. May 18.

I run djbdns on my personal server and implemented it at the company I
consult for.  I like it a lot.  Small, quick, simple...  different.

try this:

http://www.lifewithdjbdns.org

Let me know if you need a bit of help with something.  The djbdns list
can be very harsh and "RTFM" on newbies if you ask an unresearched question.

If all else fails, I could consult to set it up for you if you want.

I don't have experience with the Linksys router (I wish I did) and so 
whether or not you can access the internet through the router would 
depend on how it does NAT? If you can set it up so that it does NAT for 
your entire private subset e.g. 192.168.1.x then that would allow the 
PPP connected client to access the internet through the router as well.

Message-ID: <001f01c1f900$9b01fec0$6801a8c0@endeavor>

I think you're describing the basic function of these routers.  I think
about ALL they do is NAT.  We have one IP adddress, and all the boxes
connected to the router have their own 192.168.1.xxx address.  I can
route up to 10 specific incoming ports to different boxes. There is also
a DMZ host option which will send all incoming ports (unless otherwise
routed) to a single box.

So....I think this will work.  I *THINK* I set everythig up OK last
night, grabbed the cel phone, gave myself a jingle, and the USR hardware
PCI modem on ttys4 picked up and started squealing. Most of my local
friends are OIT college students, and are pretty busy on Friday nights,
so I could not recruit anyone who had a modem (most are on a LAN
connection) to test it for me.  8am on  saturday is still too early to
wake anyone up.    I'll head out in awhile to a friend's with my laptop
and try it then.

---------
One thing I am unclear on is the options.ttyS4 file (S4 in my case).
Section 1.8 of the walkthrough I mentioned in my original message
suggests:

	To set a specific IP for a client and server for each tty,
update the /etc/ppp/options.ttyname file for each tty: 


   		 serverIP:clientIP

I set mine up to be:

192.168.1.102:192.168.1.140

Note that I assigned the .140 for the dialup client.

Does this sound OK?

  OK. This weekend I need to replace a failing hard drive on my main
workstation/server, replace the floor covering and commode in one of the
bathrooms and get some weeds out of the yards. And, take some time for fun
by shooting a couple of rolls of film. So, it may not be until next week
that I get to this.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205110917110.22150-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I've developed the habit of scanning the tail of /var/log/messages every
day. Occasionally I see a message from sshd that someone attempted to crack
the network that way, but was rejected.

  This morning, however, I see this:

May 11 08:25:20 salmo PAM_pwdb[15537]: check pass; user unknown
May 11 08:25:21 salmo login[15537]: FAILED LOGIN 1 FROM (null) FOR 202.166.28.209, 
User not known to the underlying authentication module

  A quick check with whois.apnic.net reveals that this IP address is
assigned to:

inetnum:     202.166.0.0 - 202.166.31.255
netname:     MAGIX
descr:       Magix Broadband Network
descr:       Singapore Telecommunications LTD
country:     SG

which I find interesting because I received two UCE spams relayed through
them yesterday. I reported both spams to abuse at magix.com.sg. Now this.

  I have two questions. First, how did the cracker attempt to login? Telnet?
It's not the usual sshd rejection method. Second, is there a method,
analagous to the MTA's access.db, that permits me to block certain IP
addresses or IP address blocks from trying to gain access. In four years of
operation, this is the first instance of such an entry in the log.

  If anyone has suggestions to strengthen security here, please share them
with me.

Thanks,

Rich

Log rotation for maillog is probably being handled by logrotate (man
logrotate).  Your /etc/logrotate.conf and /etc/logrotate.d/ should have
more info for you.  /etc/logrotate.d/syslog should contain an entry for
rotating your maillog.  Is crond still running on your system?
/etc/cron.daily should contain a script that calls logrotate.

So it looks like you have the login service running. It listens on port 
515 and is accessed through the "rlogin" command from a remote client. 
I use is internally on my private network but I have it blocked on the 
external interface of my network with firewall rules. 

If you're not sure what services you have running externally, have a 
friend or someone that you trust that also runs Linux or BSD, etc ran 
an "nmap" scan against your external system. Sounds like you use SSH 
and that you don't have any need to have the "login" service running. 

If you have tcpd wrapper then the /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny 
files can be used. When I used these files I would deny all hosts and 
then put the hosts I wanted to allow in the /etc/hosts.allow file. 

You can also use the "netstat" command to see what ports have a state of 
"LISTEN" on them. As root, run the command "netstat -avpen". You'll see 
the port numbers as well as what program is doing the listening.

Darn I can't type today...The login service uses port 513...515 is the 
print daemon.

I'd like to supplement the file storage provided by my isp.  The idea is to 
allow incoming port 80 requests to one of my own firewalled servers by 
clicking a link on a hidden page on my isp web space.

Is this at all secure?  I don't see how anyone could possibly learn of a 
webpage that is not referenced anywhere on the `public` site, but what do I 
know.

Will incoming requests look like they are coming from pacifier.com (so I 
can allow only that host), or will they be unique to the visitor?

I have been reading all these right-ups and it dose not seam to be what i 
am looking for.

my server is:
mydomian.com

I want all mail from:
anybody at mydomain.com
to go to one user at mydomain.com, with out setting up a user for all the 
other names. I developed a
bad habt of using different user names for different venders and services, 
i.i.e.. ebay at mydomain.com, msn at mydomain.com, ect..
this was a attempt to track spam list leaks.. (who is leak my address).

the virtual domain file seams to only address if i was hosting a virtual 
domain,
and the Canonical mapping dose not sound like what i am looking for either.
Am I missing something or just being stupid?

No, the virtual domain stuff lets you map an entire domain, aside
from more specific addresses in the file, to a single account.

Matt,

  I checked logrotate.conf and it has nothing specific to a log. logrotate.d
has no mention of maillog; perhaps that's the problem. That directory has
scripts for cron, mars-nwe.log, named, samba, squid, junkbuster, mgetty,
named.old, sendfax, and syslog. No maillog. If there's supposed to be a
script there, could you (or someone) please mail a copy to me?

> /etc/logrotate.d/syslog should contain an entry for rotating your maillog.

  It does.

> Is crond still running on your system?

  Yes.

> /etc/cron.daily should contain a script that calls logrotate.

  It does.

  Seems to me that /etc/logrotate.d/ lost the script for maillog. Is this a
reasonable conclusion?

Thanks,

Rich

Well from your subject line I assume you are asking if a bot would know that
the page existed.  The answer is that no spider would, but if someone was
running a bot that picked a page and then tried every possible sequence then
yeah it would.  What are the chances of someone doing this?  How paranoid
are you?

As for general security, this is going to decrease your overall security and
should technically be served by a DMZ box, but as long as permissions are
set correctly and proper security measures taken there should be no problem.

What I used to do if I wanted a web location to access my files from is use
a 64-bit key for the url.  That would keep a bot busy enough that you would
see plenty of log before they ever got in.

Yes, the accesses will be unique to the visitor.  To make them come from
pacifier you would have to get them to set up forwarding.

Tony,

  If it's running it is not intentional. Neither "rlogin" nor "login" show
up in the process list, and port 515 is not explicitly mentioned in the
floppyfw rules. The only ports listed there are 22 and 25 (ACCEPT) and 80
(currently DENY). This is why I'm puzzled about the attempt.

  Good idea. I've not had this done since I upgraded floppyfw.

  /etc/hosts.deny has ALL in there. /etc/hosts.allow has only the local
network workstations and ssh permits access only from my ISP (the sshd rules
permit only me to log in that way).

  I ran this and grepped for login. Only my login on this box is shown.

  Other than the external scan ('cause running it here against my external
IP address shows nothing: nmap cannot find an awake host), have you any
other suggestions?

Many thanks,

Rich

Grep for port 513 instead of looking for "login". I think you'll see 
that "inetd" is the process doing the actual listening. Again to really 
see what ports have a listener on them run netstat and grep for the 
word "LISTEN".

I haven't really been following this thread, but is "inetd" (or one
of it's replacements) running and is any flavor of remote shell/telnet
daemon defined in /etc/inetd.conf (rshd, rexecd, rlogind, telnetd, etc.)?

Okay, I won't worry about that then.  I did notice that everyone's 
public_html/ is world readable, so anyone with a shell account can snoop 
around.  Doesn't Apache allow for somewhat tighter permissions?  The 
default creation group is `user`.  `apache` is also a member of this group. 
  Hmm

Yes they are defined in the /etc/inetd.conf file. You can disable 
services by commenting out those lines for services you don't want. 
Likewise you can uncomment lines for those services you want to enable. 
You can then force "inetd" to reread its configuration file by sending 
it a SIGHUP signal.

If I were you, I'd generate a self-signed certificate and only
allow SSL connections, and then password-protect the site.

Also, you should be able to set perms to 0711 and have Apache still
serve requests.

Well here's the entry I have for my maillog. 

/var/log/maillog {
    compress
    dateext
    maxage 365
    rotate 99
    size=+1024k
    notifempty
    missingok
    copytruncate
}

Create a new file called "maillog" in your /etc/logrotate.d directory or 
add it to an existing file in that directory. I'm assuming that your 
/etc/logrotate.conf has an include directive like so:

include /etc/logrotate.d

This causes logrotate to read all of the files in the /etc/logrotate.d 
directory. The man page for "logrotate" defines all the configuration 
values if you're unsure about any of the options.

'netstat -l' will give you all the listening ports.  'netstat-ln' for just
the numerical values.

Is there an entry for maillog in /etc/logrotate.d/syslog ?
If not, here's what's in mine:

/var/log/maillog {
	postrotate
		/bin/kill -HUP `cat /var/run/syslogd.pid 2> /dev/null` 2> /dev/null || true
	endscript
}

This would then use the default rotate options defined in
/etc/logrotate.conf, such as:

weekly
rotate 5
errors root
create
compress

Rich is running floppyfw, which doesn't even have rlogin and friends.  Unless
he has intentionally forwarded the rlogin port to an internal machine, 
which is unlikely, I don't think we are seeing an attempt on this port.
My guess is someone attempted to come in via ssh, perhaps using password
authentication.  Rich, could you post your log entry again and sshd version.
Also, you might want to feed it into google to see if you can find an 
explanation.

Uh... you mean you're going to put a link on a page for which you've built
no references that goes to your home webserver?

Well, security through obscurity is no security at all.

There's nothing from stopping anyone at all from creating a link to your
"hidden" page or even directly to your webserver.

And you'd be amazed at what spiders can find.

The RIGHT way to do this really depends on your true goal and intent.

> Will incoming requests look like they are coming from pacifier.com (so
> I can allow only that host), or will they be unique to the visitor?

No, the request is still coming from the browser.  But you can configure
apache to deny serving pages based on HTTP_REFERER, which would be the
pacifier webserver if the browser followed that link to reach your page.

Of course, that can be spoofed easily.  It's just plaintext http.

Again, hiding something doesn't improve its security really.

What are you trying to do?

  As I posted before, ports 22 and 25 are ACCEPTED and 80 is DENYed until I
get httpd configured and secure.

  Turns out that inetd *is* running, with ftp, telnet, shell and login
enabled. But, I thought those were not visible externally.

May 11 08:25:20 salmo PAM_pwdb[15537]: check pass; user unknown
May 11 08:25:21 salmo login[15537]: FAILED LOGIN 1 FROM (null) FOR 202.166.28.209, 
User not known to the underlying authentication module

and  openssh-2.3.0p1-1 is what's running now

  Searching /var/log/messages from the top for the string, "FAILED LOGIN",
reveals not only my typos as I log in, but other entries such as this one:

Mar 13 06:17:38 salmo login: FAILED LOGIN 1 FROM (null) FOR  , User not
known to the underlying authentication module

  That's the only reference; nothing before or following to explain the
context.

  Here're more:

User not known to the underlying authentication module

Apr 28 19:36:34 salmo login[14672]: FAILED LOGIN 1 FROM (null) FOR pine,

  Then nothing until today's.

  Google finds 374 entries for "check pass; user unknown". Some of the
references showing from (null) are to telnetd.

Thanks,

I need to say that I'm deeply offended by this characterization -- not
because it depicts us (I'm self-identifying with the dubious term "Linux
nerds" here) as frugal (or falsely frugal, as the example of driving all
over to save a dollar shows), but because it implies, to me, that the
appeal of Free Software is its (entirely incidental) free-as-in-beer
quality and ignores the fact that Kylix may have failed for its lack of a
free-as-in-freedom quality.

The fact that Free Software is available at no cost is due entirely to
relatively low-cost storage media and high-bandwidth peer-to-peer network
connectivity.  Remember, the FSF supported itself for years selling tapes
of GNU Emacs for over a hundred dollars each.

Free Software exists because of the human drive to share with his fellow
man and improve the general condition of all people.  Proprietary software
exists to exploit relative advantage and create inequity (as much as
possible, as I understand the theory).

Perhaps, Carla, just perhaps, some people have concerns other than their
pocketbooks.

  Back in 1987-1990 I used it (peripherally) to run a real-time, telemetry
data collection system. It worked just fine for the task. My impression is
that instrument control, especially in real time, is its niche. I may well
be wrong.

  Thanks, Tony. Looking at all the files in /etc/logrotate.d I see a wide
range of options being used.

  So, tomorrow morning I should see a new maillog, I suppose.

Not me, but a friend who swears by it.  Like Rich said, in an industrial 
control environment.  I can't remember the details, but it uses a very 
interesting borg-like topology.  A network of micro-kernels?

Think they have a free download version, too.

Maybe it's just me, but "rotate 99" seems a bit excessive.  ;-)

As a long time Linux user, and one who has paid literally tens of
thousands of dollars for software over the years, I have to say that the
reason that I and many other Linux user's I know generally avoid buying
commerical software products these days is not that it isn't "free", but
rather that so much of it is junk as to not be worth the time to even try
it out.  Sure, there are times when using free software that I have had to
tweak it endlessly, but that is also often the case for commercial
software that I have bought as well, so what's the point of buying
commercial, particularly when it takes a lot less time to "tweak" the
software when you have the source code.  To address the Borland/Inprise
example (they changed their name for a while to Inprise and recently
changed it back), I was a long time user of their products from about 1986
through 1998, and while it was initially great software, towards the end
of this time I was using their C++ compiler and it eventually reached the
point where each minor bugfix update introduced more bugs than it fixed,
and I would have to spend endless time in newsgroups trying to figure out
what the problem was (support was virtually non-existant even when you
paid for it), determine if I could work around it or have to downgrade
the compiler and live with the bugs in the older version, etc.  At least
with free software you have a real support option (do it yourself), and it
would have taken me less time to find and fix the compiler bugs than I
wasted dealing with their proprietary junk.  I have never looked at Kylix,
it might be great, but my last couple years experience with Borland were
so bad that I can't see wasting my time dealing with them again.  The
same kind of experiences and reasoning applies to Microsoft and many
other companies, and none of this even covers the problem that many
commercial software vendors will abandon a product line with little or no
notice, leaving you without any prospects for future upgrades/bug fixes,
and ultimately forcing you to switch to a new vendor, learn their
product's peculiarities and the proper way to "tweak" their software.
Ultimately, no matter how much time I spend "tweaking" Linux, it has been
my experience that in most cases I will have to spend more time "tweaking"
the commercial stuff over the long haul.

QNX is very cool, *most* GNU tools have been ported to it...The GCC 
implementation works very well....It is used in a number of large scale 
security systems, and from what I hear it is used extensively at some nuclear 
power plants.  They have (or at least used to) a demo that fits on a 
floppy...neat stuff...

  The most bothersome example of this is WordPerfect for linux/UNIX. It's a
darned shame, but the product is functionally dead.

  These messages tweak little memories from a long time ago. I think that
QNX's claim to fame has always been extremely fast response to real time
events. I don't recall how they did/do it, but it was always rock solid at
responding to inputs in micro- or milliseconds. Perhaps modern linux/*BSD
systems can do this (I imagine that embedded linux can), but we're talking
about the mid-1980s when QNX was the only OS with this capability. And it
ran on XTs and ATs, too.

  Probably the OS in Furbys, too. :-)

I used QNX for a summer in 1996, writing a report generation program for
NOAA.  It ran on a QNX box and querried their homebuilt weather data
aquisition program.  As I recall we used the Watcom C compiler (are they
still around?), all of the standard "unix-y" libraries were available,
as well as a bunch of QNX specific C libraries to access all the
realtime and threading stuff QNX is capable of.

Although we never used it, one of the coolest things about the box was
that it could transparently bond IO devices into a single virtual device
- stick 5 network cards each in two QNX boxes that "trust" each other
and QNX will use all 5 to move data between the two.  Also from what I
remember it had easy to use clustering capability with transparent
memory sharing accross machines.

I was rather impressed with its very low memory usage, a highly
functional system could fit within a couple hundred Kb of ram - and if
you needed it to fit into less, because of it's very modular kernal you
were able to throw out parts of the system at will - say if you didn't
need the "fat" and feature-rich process scheduler that QNX ships with
and just need a wee one that you've writen.

Another nice thing was the access you got to people in the QNX company -
at a time when that was rare (well, it still I suppose).  The engineers
within QNX were active on public mailing lists and newsgroups about the
OS, freely giving advice and honest opinions about their products - so
very refeshing.

It seemed stable too, although nothing we did really stressed out the
box any - though I do remember grinning at their magazine ads that had
headlines like "This is Bill.  He hasn't rebooted since 1993."

Since it's some 6 years later now, I'm not sure how much of that
information is still correct.  It's niche is definitely real-time
control and data aquisition, although I could imagine one could make a
nice professional audio application or two for it.

Well, I meant it as a loving but true jest. It is indisputable that a large part 
of Linux's appeal is that it, and other open source /free apps, can be 
legally obtained for no or very little cost. It is rather naive to believe 
otherwise. 

It is also naive to believe that Open Source/Free automatically = Good, and 
that commercial/proprietary = Evil. That's just plain silly. There's stars 
and stinkers in both worlds.

I've read the GPL, which is a work of genius, and nowhere does it say 
software should not cost money, or that programmers should not be paid for 
their efforts.

Well, I'll agree that "Open Source" is not necessarily Good and commercial
is not necessarily Evil, but I would say that Free is automatically Good
and proprietary is automatically Evil.

Just as there are more important things than our pocket books, there are
more important things than functionality.

I don't believe anyone ever asserted that it did.

So it's not anti-commercial, but it's clearly anti-property.

To be successful in any business you have to be profitable at some
point. However, becoming a Good business might be better achieved by
being open and supportive of the community and the world to better
yourself and your fellow Humans.

The things that brings me to Open Source software and Linux in
particular is my belief and trust of it's Openness not because it's
usually Free. It allows me to be an individual and gives me to freedom
and access to become whatever my heart and mind desire.

Actually, when one says "Free" with the capital 'F', they usually are
talking about the same kind of *freedom* that the Free Software
Foundation stands for - which says that the code must be Open *AND* must
be freely redistributable to users.  This is much better than just Open
is because Microsoft can release "Open source" code which has so many
restrictions that it is useless (see: "Shared Source").

To get back to the original poster's question about Kylix:

I've downloaded it and tried it out, both the 1.0 and 2.0 releases.
Here's my impressions:

	- the product is aimed at developers who currently use Delphi
	  (which is an excellent product in itself) on Windows, not
	  existing Linux programmers.
	- it looks and feels just like Delphi (this can be a good or bad
	  thing, depending on how much you liked Delphi's user interface
	  :)
	- it allows you to write code that compiles natively for both
	  Windows and Linux.  This is a very good thing for companies
	  that have a lot of internally created Delphi code (quite
	  common, as Delphi is very good at creating Database front
	  ends).
	- The database bindings look very nice, but I never wrote those
	  kinds of programs, so I can't tell you how well the Linux
	  interface to them work.
	- I dug up some old Delphi programs that I had written, and they
	  built just fine, once I removed the Windows specific portions
	  of the code.
	- The latest release is a lot better than the 1.0 release.  If
	  you originally looked at that one, spend the time to download
	  the 2.0 version.

In short, I'm not giving up gtk+ for writing Linux applications, but
Kylix isn't aimed at people like me.  And I do like the "GPL only"
free version, it shows that Borland understands Linux's roots.

Now when C++ Builder is released for Linux, that might be a different
story, I _love_ that compiler for Windows work...

  Reading /var/log/maillog is turning out to be quite interesting. I'm

  In none of these do I see a REJECT or 550 line or a reference to

  So, are these rejected messages?

Hey everyone:

I'll take 2 32's or 4 16's for the 64mb DIMM... ALTHOUGH - if anyone has
a surplus of 32mb SIMMS:  I'll swap a 128mb PC100 DIMM for 4 of them.

building a starter computer for my neighbor and it sees the 64mb DIMM as
a mere 16mb.

PORLAND people: I'll be in Portland Friday evening (May 17th)

Might as well hook them up, currently it has 32mb.  They're a young

Subject: [PLUG] postfix, slypheed and majordomo problems
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205121604080.425-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  For some reason, when my fiancee tries sending me an e-mail from the other
workstation it's going up to aracnet before coming back and it's being
rejected because the originating domain has that hostname prepended to the
domain name and it's not recognized as valid. I've no idea where this comes
from because when I log into that host and type 'hostname' only 'caddis' is
returned, not 'caddis.appl-ecosys.com'.

  In sylpheed (0.6.4), under configuration | send is the external program,
'/usr/sbin/sendmail -t'. I know that postfix uses this for compatibility with
other apps. My question is whether this command should be there since
postfix is locally installed and the primary mail server for both incoming
and outgoing messages. Perhaps this should be removed? Might this be related
to the first problem?

  Finally, I decided to use majordomo rather than mailman for the mail list
I've been asked to set up. I have two reasons for this: 1) majordomo does
not require me to set up, configure, secure and administer a web server and
2) I have detailed instructions in Richard Blum's "Postfix" book for
integrating the two. I have two majordomo issues, however. Perhaps someone
here can help me with them. (I did send a message to the majordomo-users
list, too). 1) Nothing goes in the log file. That's owned by majordom.daemon
with permissions 664. 2) I was able to subscribe myself, change the
configuration file and get a response to the 'lists' and 'who' commands, but
each message has an error message appended:

>>> Sorry, an error has occurred while processing your request
>>> The caretaker of Majordomo ( Majordomo-Owner at appl-ecosys.com ) has been notified
>>> of the problem.

  Unfortunately, I as the majordomo-owner, have not been notified of the
problem -- other than there is a problem.

  Any and all help appreciated, as usual.

Thanks,

Rich

  I unchecked the box in the 'send' tab and that seemed to fix the problem.
She can now send mail and it actually goes through postfix and gets
delivered.

Subject: [PLUG] Mirroring and backup - recommendations?
Message-ID: <001801c1fa39$44c42670$6801a8c0@endeavor>

After a recent scare with having to run e2fsck manually on our server
after a unclean unmount, I started thinking more seriously about
mirroring and automatic scheduled backups, and other such redundancy.

Our server runs a fairly stock Redhat 7.2 on a 1ghz AMD Duron 256mb
system with a 60gb IDE HD available. At my disposal is a Intel Pentium
233 system with 128mb RAM and a 10gb UDE HD.  the 10gb drive should be
plenty to essentially mirror the main system, with the exception of a
sizable chunk of  files that have been made available for FTP transfer
that would not have to be mirrored as they are easily replaceable.

I realize that not ALL files should be mirrored as the hardware is
different (although both can run i386 Redhat)

SO....my basic question is, what utilites are available and recommended
for this sort of mirroring?

Although I do not have a tape backup, it would be nice to periodically
take a snapshot of the system (except for the sizable file transfer
library) and split that into 700mb chunks for manually burning to CD

Thanks,

Greg Long

:-)

I think your question is "how do I do cheap backups" ;-)

Frankly I think you should at least think about tape.  You can get
used 4mm DAT drives that are 12MB uncompressed for about $250 used.
Unlike hard drives tapes don't crash.  Also the most valuable part
of backup (I've found) is when someone needs a file that was backed
up months ago.

I realize 4mm tape drives aren't 100% reliable but if your regularly
backing up then the occasional messed up tape won't matter.

But if you can't afford tape then what I'd recommend is instead of
trying to create a backup server and guessing what you need, I'd take
that P233 and a sheet of paper and attempt to build a server on the
233 that duplicates exactly the 1Ghz AMD system.  As you are building
this server, everytime you find yourself referring back to the
original server for some piece of information, write it down on the
paper.  Once the new server is exactly identical to the old one then
you will have a list on the paper of what you need to backup.  Then
if you want to do it real time you can set up a script with scp
statements in it.  (ie: rcp except encrypted)

Not to sound snippy, but I don't think you're at all qualified to tell me
how my ideals are "better stated".

Now, if you meant that you would rather say the above, that's fine.  But
it's not an improvement on my statement as long as I'm the "I".

Why limit yourself to the narrow confines of "business" and it's
one-sided, destructive notions of success?

Again, I say we should really start looking at alternatives to business
for valid means of social interaction.

I'm having trouble understanding your capital Free here.  The sentence
implies to me that you're only considering the free-as-in-beer quality.

But without the free-as-in-freedom quality, merely "open" software might
still (and often does) allow one to restrict the freedom of whole classes
of others in a perverse interpretation of personal freedom.  Free Software
prevents that kind of clearly anti-social behavior.

I see from Aaron's response to this message that he didn't have a clear
idea of the distinction between Free and Open in this context.

I apologize for any harsh tone I used.

I'm pretty fucked-up on painkillers right now, so forgive me if you are
capable.  I flipped my bike on Halsey yesterday, hyper-extended my left
elbow and did a chin plant into the asphalt.

By the way, when you're checking to see if cars are coming, also check to
see if there are any dividers in the road.

I'm aching too much to type more tonight.

Does it mean that you're unemployed and looking for a job or it's just
a form of your own advertisement?

In this case, may I start to post my own ads about Linux High Tech
company which performs exactly what you've described below and more?

Finally we can turn PLUG list into a free Linux/UNIX consultant ads
agency. Do you really want this?

Lets keep your private business matters off this list.

First, this list is not the place for this.  Please send an apology to
the list and don't let it happen again.

That being said, send me your resume.  There is a strong possibility
that I may be needing a linux person next month (or July).

Firewalls can be spoofed or bypassed.  I know that having those
services are a convenience, but they are a hole.

You may want to upgrade.  I've been seeing attempts to long in via ssh
with various users (oracle, test) on my server and with school getting
out it may be script kiddie time again.  Of course, in my logs they
were clearly tagged as coming from sshd so my life was simpler.

Good luck,

----------------------  <-- Plastic mat: You need to ground this

Dick,

You have a huge capacitor under your feet, that's the problem. Those mats
are great to stop the wear on the carpet but it loves to keep the charge
from grounding. I had the same trouble so I solved it easily by grounding
the mat with one of those stick-on disposable wrist straps. I stuck the
strap to the mat and the other end to my desk (also a Steelcase). My desk is
already grounded but you may be able to just screw a wire from the frame to
the outlet coverplate screw (assuming it's mettalic).

The other thing I did was spray the mat with anti static spray. My chair has
a little piece of chain hanging from the central post that slides on the
floor to discharge the static. Once I step on the pad, I usually feel the
juice disappear. I used to charge myself up just by getting out of the chair
but no longer.

HTH.

Subject: [PLUG] A Good Linux Book for Novices
Message-ID: <20020513171711.EBE15352D3@ados.com>

I'd like to recommend the following book for newbies & novices (like me.)
(I have no business interest in the sale of this book, btw.)

Title "Linux! I didn't know you could do that..."
Author: Nicholas D. Wells
Publ: Sybex
ISBN 0-7821-2935-8
Price: $21.95 (Fry's)

The organization of this book overcomes a great gulf many if us novices have 
in learning to use Linux 'around the house:'

1) We can formulate an intent in English, like: "How do I play mp3's in 
Linux?" 
2) The answer is out there in the form of 3 to 5 commands or a simple slick 
install.

The problem is that it might take you 5 days or internet searching and FAQ 
reading, tweaking, etc, to find what WOULD have and SHOULD have been a couple 
of minutes' job.

Pounding through O'Reilly books is like using a dictionary to learn how to 
spell a word - you'll discover some neat words along the way that weren't 
part of your search, and a lot of useful and accurate information, but you 
still have to know how to spell the word in order to find out how to spell it.

OTOH, this book organizes its chapters around 38 basic intents, and provides 
steps proceeding from "OK is your system ready for this?" to basic tools, 
saving the most complex applications for last. (For the above, the steps 
proceed from setting up a soundcard using sndconfig, then using kscd, gtcd, 
and xmms, and a few suggestions like OpenSoundSystem. Then it's on to 
accessing CDDB, and more advanced programs like xrdb and Xwave) So, you get 
in at whereever your level of understanding is, and you can get out at the 
level where -you- decide you've learned enough for now.

Lastly, the book attempts to make each chapter as stand-alone as possible, 
for example by -NOT- assuming you already know how 'tar' works, and NOT 
sticking it in only ONE chapter (this would force a nested search: How do I 
install this? You have to unpack it. How do I unpack it? Go figure where THAT 
chapter is, then come back here and continue solving THIS problem.) 

Instead the book presents (for example)

# tar xvzf [program].tgz
# cd [directory made by program]
# make install
# [program name]

in MANY places, so you can stay focused on your current intent.
The book comes with a CD including rpm's of just about everything it talks 
about, so if you're stuck and the book says you need a diagnostic tool, you 
won't lose an hour or more looking all over for it.

For those of us who come from Windows expect to run something by clicking on 
it and watching it 'go,' this is a BIG help.

Er, we have allowed such postings in the past (both job postings and
requests for employment). The list is meant to be a resource for local
Linux/Unix people - not limited to pure technical matters. Mutual support
between geeks is a good thing.

Please retract your demand for an apology and apologize to everyone for
posting it! :):):)

OK,
Lets define, what is a job posting, job search and just a simple free
advertisement on Linux/UNIX consulting.

Job posting is a message about Linux/UNIX open positions in your
company or business.I haven't seen a lot of these messages for the
last five years.

Job search is when you're desperately searching for a Linux/UNIX job
because you have to pay the bills and feed your family. 
It's understandable, and tolerable but PLUG list is not an employment
agency in any way.

Free advertisement on Linux/UNIX consulting is when you already have
you business and in eager to increase your profit, you're publishing
your adds with all these stupid marketing words for free. 
Why PLUG should be turned into free adds agency? You can publish such
things in Computer Bits and other magazines for a monthly fee.
If you want to get more money and attention, you'll have to pay for
your adds.

One of the great things about this list is getting several replies with
different information. The combination of all those ideas often leads to
a better solution than using just one of them. I usually try to reply to
replies fairly quickly, but for some reason, couldn't bring myself to do
it this weekend. Then, this morning, I find one more idea that, combined
with the rest of the information, gives me what I hope will be a good
solution.

I'll be finding a way to bond the legs of the two tables and the chair
mat to each other (at one point) and then connect that bond point to the
house ground by way of the screw on one of the outlets. I'll also try
the anti-static spray ideas, but I think that providing a path for the
charge to follow from the floor mat to the house ground will be the most
productive.

Thanks to all for your ideas.

Actually, it's hard to say. It usually happens before I touch any part
of the computer. Sometimes it's touching the table. Sometimes it's
touching the chair. Sometimes it's just stepping onto the mat.

I just ran the wire for this circuit, and I used one of those 3-led
testers before plugging anything else in. In my house there is one
15-amp circuit serving the entire top floor, which includes the master
bedroom and bath, and my office. When we had the walls open for the
plumbing project a couple of months ago, I ran a piece of #12 ROMEX from
the basement to the attic. I finally got around to hooking it up at each
end. Now I have an additional six outlets in my office on a 20-amp
circuit, and have plugged all the computer equipment in my office into
them.

When I was Facility Manager at Prime Computer and later at Apollo
Computer, I was in charge of buying furniture for engineers. Steelcase
was the manufacturer of choice for most of the office furniture. That's
when I discovered these chairs. There's a used office equipment store
down on Macadam near Memory Time. I found my current chair there. I
agree, they are the most comfortable chair I have had the pleasure of
sitting in for long periods at a desk.

We have on occasion run a humidifier. The last couple of years, it
hasn't been dry enough in the house to call for it. We keep the
temperature down around 65; if we were running up near 70, that would
dry things out and we would have to use the humidifier.

This makes a lot of sense. I've understood grounding for a few years,
but hadn't thought about the difference between it and bonding.

If I were to crimp an eye-shaped lug to some wire and bolt that to the
mat, do you think that would work? I recall seeing mats with a ground
wire bolted to them. Otherwise, who carries the disposable wrist straps?

Spraying the mat instead of my shoes sounds good. That way I don't have
to spray several different pairs of shoes!

Good idea. That shouldn't be hard to do at all.

Colin,

  I turned off the services. Should I also kill inetd? If this process is
used only to run remote connections (login, telnet and the r* series), and
none of those services are to be used externally, I should be able to shut
it down without harm. Correct?

  Open-ssh was just upgraded a month or so ago, but I've no objection to
doing so again.

All the mats that I've seen with this feature are ESD mats, I'm guessing
that a standard office carpet mat isn't ESD safe but is rather
non-conductive.  While it wouldn't hurt, it might not help.

Yes, if you're not using any of the services listed in inetd.conf, then
you can turn it off.

Thanks, I wish I had this book 6 months ago.  Even so, I'll check it
out.

Subject: [PLUG] A Good Linux Book for Novices

I'd like to recommend the following book for newbies & novices (like
me.)
(I have no business interest in the sale of this book, btw.)

Title "Linux! I didn't know you could do that..."
Author: Nicholas D. Wells
Publ: Sybex
ISBN 0-7821-2935-8
Price: $21.95 (Fry's)

The organization of this book overcomes a great gulf many if us novices
have 
in learning to use Linux 'around the house:'

1) We can formulate an intent in English, like: "How do I play mp3's in 
Linux?" 
2) The answer is out there in the form of 3 to 5 commands or a simple
slick 
install.

The problem is that it might take you 5 days or internet searching and
FAQ 
reading, tweaking, etc, to find what WOULD have and SHOULD have been a
couple 
of minutes' job.

Pounding through O'Reilly books is like using a dictionary to learn how
to 
spell a word - you'll discover some neat words along the way that
weren't 
part of your search, and a lot of useful and accurate information, but
you 
still have to know how to spell the word in order to find out how to
spell it.

OTOH, this book organizes its chapters around 38 basic intents, and
provides 
steps proceeding from "OK is your system ready for this?" to basic
tools, 
saving the most complex applications for last. (For the above, the steps

proceed from setting up a soundcard using sndconfig, then using kscd,
gtcd, 
and xmms, and a few suggestions like OpenSoundSystem. Then it's on to 
accessing CDDB, and more advanced programs like xrdb and Xwave) So, you
get 
in at whereever your level of understanding is, and you can get out at
the 
level where -you- decide you've learned enough for now.

Lastly, the book attempts to make each chapter as stand-alone as
possible, 
for example by -NOT- assuming you already know how 'tar' works, and NOT 
sticking it in only ONE chapter (this would force a nested search: How
do I 
install this? You have to unpack it. How do I unpack it? Go figure where
THAT 
chapter is, then come back here and continue solving THIS problem.) 

Instead the book presents (for example)

# tar xvzf [program].tgz
# cd [directory made by program]
# make install
# [program name]

in MANY places, so you can stay focused on your current intent.
The book comes with a CD including rpm's of just about everything it
talks 
about, so if you're stuck and the book says you need a diagnostic tool,
you 
won't lose an hour or more looking all over for it.

For those of us who come from Windows expect to run something by
clicking on 
it and watching it 'go,' this is a BIG help.

I guess I'll give it a try. If it doesn't work, I'll go looking for an
ESD mat.

If at all possible, you should put a high value resistor between the 
house ground and your mat/table/chair.  A 100 kiloohm to 1 megaohm 1/4 Watt
resistor would be appropriate.  This is to prevent your body from becoming
a low resistance path to ground should you happen to accidentally contact
the AC mains.  You should be able to find a suitable resistor at Radio
Shack or Norvac.

I believe that there are multiple virii (?) that do this. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe this is how they exploited IE and Outlook because IE mishandled the audio/x-midi and executed the attachment automatically with out checking what kind of file it was.  I think that nimda is one of the ones that does this.  I'm not sure of all of the different ones that use this method however.  Try going to www.mcaffee.com and take a look at their virus database.

	Based upon your recommendation, I went to Powell's Technical
	Bookstore and purchased a used copy of the book for 17.50.
	I have only had a few minutes to glance through the book but
	 have already recognized ways in which the book will be useful.

> The organization of this book overcomes a great gulf many if us novices

	I agreee, the organization of the book is very helpful.
	There are four or five projects that I have an interest
	in working on and that via my brief overview, believe that
	the instructions will assist me.



Thanks for the recommendation.

A long time ago I saw a series of comic book stories (online) about Tux

Unfortunatly, I didn't bookmark the site.  Does anyone know the URL of
the website?  I'd *really* appreciate it.  

In case it helps, I'm attaching the one picture that I saved from that

Yeah, although I think they involved already having an account on the
machine?  Linux Weekly News (www.lwn.net) is a great place to stay
current on that kind of stuff, although their search engine leaves a
lot to be desired.

Hmmm....

"Versions of OpenSSH prior to 2.9.9 have a vulnerability that can allow
logins from hosts which have been explicitly denied access."

This too:

1. Systems affected:

        All versions of OpenSSH between 2.0 and 3.0.2 contain
        an off-by-one error in the channel code.

        OpenSSH 3.1 and later are not affected.

2. Impact:

        This bug can be exploited locally by an authenticated user
        logging into a vulnerable OpenSSH server or by a malicious
        SSH server attacking a vulnerable OpenSSH client.

  The mail list I set up for a group of which I am a member is filled with
the ditally challenged (not in the sense of missing fingers). They're all
running either Windows of some flavor or some Mac OS (which I guarantee is
not OS X), and their MUA is set to send html-formatted mail. Majordomo
cannot read it any more easily than can I using pine.

  Is there a place I can learn what menu sequence will allow those users to
turn off html in their mail? I've no idea what version of Windows any of
them use, what Microsoft foists off as a MUA, or where to tell them to go
within the software to change to ASCII text.

  Some of you have family members using Windows, others work in an
OS-diverse workplace. I'd be grateful for some information that I can pass
on to these users when they write to me for help.

Thanks,

Most who use Outlook (aka Lookout!) can change the format of the current
message with Format -> Plain Text. They can set this as their default under
Tools -> Options -> Mail Format and changing the first field (Send in this

Hey, 

If I donate a couple Linux disrobution box sets to my old high school,
would anyone mind if i said it was from "Me and PLUG"?  

I wouldn't think so, but just wanting to make sure... ;)

Unfortunately, many sites enable HTML-mail on their Exchange server, so
even if the user composes in plain text, it's still sent out as HTML.

These are definitely kids comic book style.

I was hoping for something humorous with more of a Bloom County /
Dilbert flavor.  Any one know of anything like this? If not, are there
any cartoonists out there with talent AND a wry sense of humor? :)

  Thanks, Bill. I never used a Microsoft MUA so I'm completely ignorant and

  What a shame! But, the folks with whom I'm dealing are individuals at

I'm haven't read any Bloom County or much Dilbert, so I don't know if it
is in the same style, but I think its funny (most of the time):

And I just got the attached. No virus, but it is SPAM. It didn't quite fly

Do subscriptions to the list require approval? If not, perhaps they should.

Count my employer as one *sigh*. I admin the company's linux mail list, and
have LARTed those who post HTML attachments - only to find out that even
when they set their preferences correctly for plain/text, $exchange server
still mutilates it. Freakin' abominations, .bat man.

Subject: [PLUG] moving north ...
Message-ID: <20020513160837.A1515@defiant>

It's been fun!

By the end of this month, I'll be firmly established on a farm 30
miles north of Bremerton; with my internet connection at the end of a
very long dialup - meaning that a 26k connection is likely to be the
best I can do for the short term.

As a result, I don't wanna have to deal with the bottle neck that this
wonderful forum provides with it's 50 messages a day. So until I can
evolve into a permanent full time connection thru said dialup, I'm
gonna have to disconnect from this list for awhile. I'm on a number of
other lists, which don't have the traffic this one does, so I'll stay
on them until they get too noisy. If you've got an event, post it on
the announce list, and maybe I can come down for a visit.

I plan to attend the ALT this week, but the next morning I'm taking
the first load north, and after that, I'll miss our interactions.

It would be really cool if there was a way I could post questions to
this list, but only get answers to my questions - rather than all the
rest of the traffic. That would be a really great interim solution.
Anybody got any ideas on how that might be accomplished?

In the meantime, have a great summer! I'll keep in touch....

Most nix mail clients support HTML mail OK, but I guess you have diverse
group.

Outlook can be configured to send plain text by default, though I
beleive Matt is correct - Exchange Server can override this.

My biggest annoyance is that HTML mail sent through our KLUG mailman
list sends HTML just fine, but it ARCHIVES in plain text - so even
though there is a web interface to view the archives - the tags are
still displayed.

I think this starts to fall under the "can't we all just get along"
category. :)

Unfortunately, many sites enable HTML-mail on their Exchange server, so
even if the user composes in plain text, it's still sent out as HTML. ~M

Bloom County was really an 80's thing, which featured as its main
character - a PENGUIN (named Opus). Berke Brethed (sp?) poked a lot of
fun at politics and life in general.

No way! HTML mail is enabled by default but the Exchange server never
reformats the message. There isn't even a way to set this on the server. And
all these messages are in plain text with HTML enabled on my servers.

'fore long it's likely KLUG will be going more "public" and trying to at
least welcome the high school kids here in the area.  Is anyone aware of
any evidence anywhere that MS is putting such a stupulation squelching
Linux on the table to any schools?  I can only imagine that any sort of

You might just connect though the news server.  Point your news reader

His name is Berkeley Breathed (breth-ed, btw) and about a year ago he got
interviewed (albeit not very willingly, from the sound of it) and you can
read it here:

http://www.pvponline.com/rants_breathed.php3

I'm sorry to be off topic, but I thought I'd share this since Bill and Opus
were my favorites. I still have all my books and the flexi disc of Billy And
The Boingers and someplace I have a box with my Opus & Bill for President
shirt. He also has written a few childrens books too, and they aren't bad. I
thought I'd share, for those who have the same conversations I do, "yeah,
that was awesome! Whatever happened to...?"

Message-ID: <1021333811.9594.162.camel@kat.zotnet.com>

After receiving no commitments for 3 months, and having no speaker for
this week, unless I here by tomorrow (Tues) noon, I am going to cancel
Advanced Topics due to lack of speakers.

While they have been well attended, I do not have the time currently, or
budget (which has nice for flying people in) to get people to talk. 
This is a bit odd, as plenty of people have said they would like to
talk, but they never follow through.

So if you want to keep Advanced Topics, email me directly (not to the
list), or if someone else wants to take over co-ordinating the talks,
that would be great.

I would like to thank Bruce for getting the space, and Galen for keeping
that end of things up and running.

Galen,

  I downloaded the .src.rpm and tried to rebuild it. Now I need to get the
packages for XFree86-devel and gnome-libs-devel in order to rebuild the
OpenSSH utility. How strange! Why does a background utility such as openssh
require GUI anything?

I have seen this too.

The trick seems to be "mozilla running before"  This may be a gnome, or

I built OpenSSH myself and I only needed the OpenSSL library. I don't 
even have any X stuff on my firewall system. I guess it must be some 
sort of forced dependency in the RPM. I downloaded the source in a tar 
ball from the OpenSSH.org website directly. Same for the OpenSSL 
library source which I got at www.openssl.org.

Bzzzzt.  Which version of Exchange Server are you running?  I don't know
about previous versions, but Exchange Server 2000 most definitely does
this (I've had mild arguments with our Windows admin about this and he
prefers the HTML setting).

Not Gnome or KDE, as I run neither.  I think it has something to do
with the "Common Client Interface".  See:

  <http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/XMosaic/CCI/cci-spec.html>

And yes, it is necessary that the local browser be running first or
the browser gets launched at the remote end instead.

Rich, Rich, Rich...  Why not just download the source and build it?  :-)
If you're on a recent Linux distro that uses PAM, you'll need to include
the --with-pam option when you configure OpenSSH.

./configure --with-pam

Here is your culprit.
  openssh-askpass-gnome-3.1p1-1
If you can prevent the rpm from trying to build that, your X and gnome
dependencies should go away.

I am a little surprised you don't have the XFree86-devel installed, given
how often you are rebuilding things.

Message-ID: <20020514012016.96432.qmail@web9607.mail.yahoo.com>

I just upgraded Caldera, and I'm having a problem. I
suspect that it's in one of the KDE configuration
files.

My home directory is mapped by Samba, but it's a
generic [homes] share. Before the upgrade, I could get
to it, but not any more.

I just created a specific share in smb.conf with the
path explicitly given 

[webpages]
comment = test
path = /homes/rtk/webpages
username = rtk
       ...

and this share CAN be reached. In fact, after it was
created it popped up in the Network Neighborhood as
soon as Samba reset itself. Can anyone tell me what
the problem is?

Reminder Portion of this email:
Our May Meeting will be on Wednesday the 15th at 7:00PM. Randal will be
speaking on his adventures with template toolkit and how he used it to
create the new www.stonehenge.com.

The Technical Meeting: ONSITE! Technology, 333 SE 3rd St. at 7:00 PM.
The Social Meeting: Read Below

New Info Portion of this email (IOW: Please read):
Curtis will not be able to coordinate this meeting due to other obligations
so I have the rare privilege to taking it over for a month :).

As an experiment (since Produce Row seems a little cramped), we will try
another close venue, the Rose and Raindrop. To coordinate with the Rose &
Raindrop, I would like an approximate headcount. So, if plan to attend
please try and send and email to grep at onsitetech.com, this is not a RSVP so
no one will be excluded if he/she changes his/her mind later.

The social meeting will run from approx 6:00pm to 6:45pm.

Maybe to a small extent...  Problems with Win2K rollouts that I heard of
were mostly because of administrator's unfamiliarity with Active Directory
and no compelling business reason to upgrade.  Also, most companies don't
like to upgrade their Windows servers because it's usually fairly
disruptive to any installed software.  With Linux we can upgrade whichever
specific part we feel the need to upgrade, so system upgrades aren't quite
as daunting to us.

Userfriendly is one of the few truly funny computer-related cartoons out
there. Well, one of two: the only other one I've found is Sluggy Freelance
at http://www.sluggy.com. (SF & UF had a brief crossover a couple of years
ago.)

The only other ones that could possibly fall into this group is Dilbert
(which, IMHO has lost its edge since Scott Adams left his day job), &
Foxtrot when its focussing on youngest son Jason's antics. (At a time when
most newspaper cartoonists still don't know the difference between a
Macinstosh & Winders PC -- let alone even heard of Linux -- the guy who
writes Foxtrot is amazingly clued into the latest nerd/geek fads.)

Just a small warning for anybody who likes comics and decides to look at
sluggy: make sure you don't have anything better to do for a while, and
start at the begining.  By the time you're ready to take a break it will
be many hours later and you will not have realized it. I made the
mistake of reading it the first time the night before I had a paper due
(just a little distraction, need to take a short break . . . yeah,
right), needless to say, getting that paper done was quite a monumental
task.

run X 4.2.0. The new sis driver in 4.2.0 is much much better for sis
(also trident).

RH 7.3.0 has it.  I recompiled the rawhide RPMS for 7.2, and it
complains about a kernel-drm error, but it works.

4.0.1 is pretty old, perhpas you meant 4.1.0?

One "bad" thing about X is you often need to upgrade the whole X tree to
upgrade drivers. It is royal pain.

*nod* I really like Pete's cartooning. He bounces back and forth 
between low comedy (dig the recent "chick magnet" :-) and some fairly 
dark themes (Oasis is a sick, twisted reminder of the horrors that 
occur when people methodically use others for their own ends).

But Shahms' warning should be heeded: the first go-round through the

Subject: [PLUG] Inconsistent MD5SUM results on ISO files
Message-ID: <20020513214256.A4892@mentorg.com>

Hi,

After repeated errors installing RedHat 7.3 on another box using some
freshly-burned ISOs, I decided to check if my originals had the right MD5SUMs.
With three ISOs to check, I tried

% md5sum valhalla-i386-disc*

The value returned for disc1 was correct, but not for disks 2 and 3.  For some
reason I tried it again, and this time I got three incorrect sums.  Repeated
attempts on a single ISO show ever-changing values:

% md5sum valhalla-i386-disc1.iso
59ea7973386287fe95152b0dff1f37e7  valhalla-i386-disc1.iso
% md5sum valhalla-i386-disc1.iso
60e1d3f990eed0d3fe2622c917ec1a82  valhalla-i386-disc1.iso
% md5sum valhalla-i386-disc1.iso
cd1cad8642579dc58ff63288fe5c404f  valhalla-i386-disc1.iso
% md5sum valhalla-i386-disc1.iso
2f59a52896c10b9f39a5588b8bebc387  valhalla-i386-disc1.iso

I am running RedHat 7.1 with my own 2.4.18 kernel.  The FS is ext2 and the disk
is an IBM 45 GB Deskstar 75GXP.  I see no (other) indications the disk is
having any problems.

Any thoughts what might be going wrong?

Thanks,

Marc

Unfortunately, this sounds like bad hardware, I had similar problems
myself, back with 7.2, only I managed to get it installed occasionally
only to have it compeletely hose itself after a random amount of time. 
Really frustrating.  There are a couple of possibilities, what other
hardware are you using? It *COULD* be the harddrive, but it might also
be motherboard, processor or RAM.  I ended up replacing all of those
trying to track down the problem, and the only conclusion I managed to
come to was that it wasn't the RAM.  The harddrive was failing (same
model as yours), but I think that was unrelated coincident failing,
seeing as I replaced it and things kept not working.  I had been using
an AMD Athlon proc. with a Via chipset motherboard, both of which got
replaced at the same time, and almost immediately afterwards I heard
about the issues with the Athlons (can't remember exactly what they were
right now) and I had previously heard reports of problems with the Via
chipsets, so I'm convinced my problems were in one of those areas.

Hopefully I'm just jumping to conclusions and it turns out to be
something simple though...

Hi Shahms,

Thanks for the good information.  In the meantime I rebooted into a 2.4.11
kernel and reran 'md5sum' three times on all three ISOs -- I got the correct
value all nine times.  So, either my 2.4.18 kernel is not quite right, or some
other rot had developed that somehow got cleared by rebooting.  Now that I have
a "test" to run, I can try it periodically to see if the problem returns.

You don't know much about Microsoft's power of suppression of news
articles, do you? :-)

For example, read the following:

http://www.pcworldmalta.com/specials/MSPiracy/

The facts in this are true.  Now, tell me why it is that the US PC news never
ran this story.

Microsoft has also routinely put in illegal/unsupportable things into it's
contracts.  see:

http://www.advogato.org/article/453.html

and

http://www.gnu.org/press/2002-04-11-ms-patent.html

and

http://news.com.com/2100-1001-868413.html

Note in that last one that the dollar prices were gagged - and this is
court evidence!!

Anyway, to get more serious about the disclosure thing, read the following
and I hope it's not too arcane.  I've seen some really gnarly contracts.

In theory, any contract that a government agency like the school
district signs sould be available for any requestor.  But contracts
are documents that are interpreted.  It's perfectly possible for
Microsoft to write a contract that contains language that a Linux advocate
could interpret to mean that Linux is permitted, but a Microsoft
advocate could interpret to mean Linux wasn't permitted.  Then if
Microsoft's reps "explain" their interpretation to the school administrator
in a meeting, it's unlikely that such a meeting is going to be
recorded for your inspection.  Your left depending on the school
admin having some balls to reinterpret the contract favorable to
Linux and then just sign it anyway and go against was he was verbally
told.

And, of course, Microsoft could always insert a "donation" clause, in
short something to the effect that if the school runs more than 90%
Windows OS that they are elegible for "extra" money or software licenses -
for example they could say:

"in consideration for the difficulty encountered certifying an exact
number of computer systems running Microsoft OS at any given time,
Microsoft will permit a variance of 20% off the total OS count, if
the organization counts more than 80% of it's computers as running
Microsoft Windows"

In short, what they are saying there is that if the school has 2,000
PC's and claims that over 1600 of them are running Windows then
Microsoft will allow them to run an actual number of up to 1920 computers
with Windows even though they are only declaring and paying for 1600.
But if the school says that only 1599 computers are running Windows,
then they can only run an actual number of 1599.

Another trick is stepping settings - in short they
arrainge the discount curve so that the school declares, say 1-1000
Windows systems, that the per-unit cost is $100 and if they declare 1001-1800
Windows systems then the unit cost starts dropping on a curve until
at 1800 installs it hits $55.  In short:

1-1000   unit cost $100
1001-1100  unit cost $90
1101-1200  unit cost $83
.
.
1701-1800  unit cost $55

(obviously in actual practice the above is expressed in a formula,
this is the same trick the US Government does with deductions in
the tax laws, BTW)

Now get out your calculator and guess what - for any system counts
between 1000 and 1800, surprise, you pay THE SAME THING: ie: roughly around
$100,000! :-) The price doesen't start rising until after 1800 and if you
combine it with the slop trick, why then your really not forced to pay more
than that $100,000 until you get to 2160

As a result, if your a district with 2000 PC systems all running Windows, then
if you start switching over to Linux, you save NOTHING until you get
at least 1000 systems converted

Clauses like the above are not illegal and not obviously anti-Linux.
But they effectively serve to pressure network administrators to
deemphasize use of Linux - unless they are willing to go whole-hog
and switch the whole bloody site to Linux.  And this is my premise all
along - that no government school district has the balls to actually
switch over because to do it means sweeping out EVERYTHING that's
attached to Microsoft - trying to pussyfoot won't work.

You can say what you want about "controlled introduction" but that's
a cop-out.  Microsoft is going to set things up so that the schools
won't see a dime of savings until they are really honestly willing to
kiss 80% of their existing Windows installs goodbye.

One way would be for one of us to agree to receive messages from you,
post them to the list, and forward the responses to you. Or, you could
see the answers via the web archives at: http://plug.skylab.org/.
Unfortunately, the archives seem to be a bit behind. The page organizes

The new archive location is contained in the mail header.

This is the MailMan version which picks up where skylab left off.  Some day

This sounds like your outlet might not be grounded very well.  Your
computer case is a very good Faraday shield (especially with the covers
on), and any static that hits the case should be dissipated to the earth
long before the electric potential of the ground plane on your
motherboard raises high enough to cause a reset.

However, your ground wire could be capacitively coupled to the earth. 
This coupling will still allow the small AC current required to light up
a tester, but static is not AC, and the coupling may be able to allow
the potential of the case to get high enough to cause the reset. 

HTH

Derek Loree

Please note that I use the word potential (short for electric potential)
where most people would use the word voltage (volts is the unit for
electric potential).  The terms voltage and amperage are not very good
terms for describing the concepts of electric potential and electric
current

I still have to run it, but not on as many machines as I would be if
there was no Linux. :-)

I wondered about that. Thanks for pointing it out. I don't usually look
at the full header so I'd never seen that before.

Subject: [PLUG] Printing in Linux
Message-ID: <002b01c1fb63$2a83cf60$3c010b0a@assi.bigrocksports.com>

I recently replace a Windows NT server with a Red hat 7.1 server. I set up
the printers and everything appeared to be fine, except when printing
graphic files to a HP LaserJet 4100 M. When graphics are printed to this
printer, it takes about 14 minutes to print a job where the same job sent to
another printer (HP laser jet 4000) prints in 3 minutes. The only difference
between these two printers setup is is that the one that prints quickly is
set to print to a local file (/usr/share/printconf/jetdirectprint) and the
one that prints slow is set to print direct to TCP connection. I changed
(using the WebAdmin tool) the slow one to print to a local file
(/usr/share/printconf/jetdirectprint) and then try printing to it. When I
print to it the first time, it says the permissions are incorrect. So I ran
checkpc -f and it corrected the permissions. I think printed to it again and
it just keeps aborting the print jobs.

Any suggestions as to what may be wrong?

Thanks in advance!!

As the giver of the Ruby talk a few months ago, I'd say that Ken asked
intelligent questions ;-)

I would definately like to go to this (Small)talk, when will it be and

My newest project is a closed circut tv for a customer.

The goal is to get a relatively real-time view outside of the building from at least a couple of locations 
inside the building.

We've got a RH 7.2 server 20 foot away fromt he proposed camera location. The office is full of Win 
clients (for a little while yet.) I can use a USB camera into the server, but I've got no idea what to do 
with the images once they're on the server. Does anybody have experience with this type of application?

I have a couple of cameras in my home office. The software takes a
snapshot every couple of seconds and dumps it in a fixed location
that the Web server can get to. I have a Web page that uploads
the images continuously at a fixed interval using a perl CGI
script and a mime type of  multipart/x-mixed-replace. This
works fine for Netscape, but doesn't work with IE clients.
For that I have an ActiveX applet I got from Axis (www.axis.com)

wednesday evening at "It's A Beautiful Pizza", 3341 SE Belmont in
Portland (in the same block as the Zupan's grocery.  It is in the
downstairs room (ask at the counter if you have trouble finding the
door).  I found a map to the venue at:

Sounds like a job for canserv.  It will stream 30 fps to the internet on whichever port you choose.   I have
been using it for a year with good results.  One can lower the fps or have a frame every 30 secs if ya want.

Subject: [PLUG] Connecting Linux users to Windows shares
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.33.0205141234580.16192-100000@lukem.com>

I have several Linux users that need to connect to a Windows file server
(until some day in the future when we replace it with Linux).  Anyway, I'm
able to mount the shares on the Windows file server on my local system as
root, but I'd like those shares to be mounted with the permissions of a
local user.  Make sense?  For example, if user julie has an account on her
Linux workstation, I want her to be able to access a share on the Windows
file server with the access permissions defined for her on the Windows
server.  Ideally, I would have a directory in their home directory that
would be the share on the Windows server.

Suggestions?  Pointers to a good how-to?
Thanks,
~M

Axis?  No pc required, runs it's own web server, embedded Linux.  What's 
not to love?

get_zeroed_page() will allocate a page of memory and clear it out. It must
be deallocated with free_page(). Otherwise yes, you can use memset().

Subject: [PLUG] samba issue, racked my brain
In-Reply-To: <20020319164250.GA9067@einstein.seansdomain.org>
Message-ID: <20020514202744.13876.qmail@web21206.mail.yahoo.com>

Hey all,

Was hoping someone here might be able to point me
where to look to resolve the samba pdc issue I'm
having.

I upgraded my samba package from 2.2.3a to 2.2.4 about
a week after it came out. Everything seemed to go fine
except i was having this strange printer issue. The
only user that was able to print was me. Which was
very odd considering the printer is shared
peer-to-peer from a windows machine. So I did some
snooping using ethereal and figured out that the
machine accounts were not working correctly, the pdc
was returning 'user unknown errors' when machines were
logging in. Yet I was still able to log on to the
domain, I'm assuming thats because of a windows bug I
found referenced in the samba mailing list archives.
Apparently the windows box will still log on users who
have previously logged on to the domain, but no new
ones. So anyway, I'm not sure what to do about this
now. I tried re-adding my machine accounts to no
avail. Anyone got any ideas where to go next?

Thanks much for your time,

Ken

Message-ID: <86n0v2s8dm.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

I've been having a little trouble with a backup process.  This morning
an 'mt' hung on me in a "D N" state, which according to "man ps"
decodes as Wing Attack Plan R, R for Robert ... Oops!  No, sorry.
Those weren't today's codes.  It decodes as D = "uninterruptible sleep
(usually IO)" and N = "low-priority task".  A "kill -9 <pid>" doesn't
work.  The tape wasn't moving, I ejected the tape and reinserted it,
but mt is still stuck.  Do I have to reboot the sucker?  Or is there
some incantation like: "Peace on Earth" or "Purity of Essense" to fix
it?

Thanks!

There will be an advanced topic talk tomorrow (Wed) on Squeak Smalltalk.

For those of you who think you know Object Oriented Programming, but
have never used SmallTalk, this a a good intro.

For those who wonder what the biggest deal is about OOP, this is also a
good intro.

For those who know more than Ken, and want to challenge him, you have to
wait 15 minutes....

The talk will be all demo -- no slides!

Squeak is a Smalltalk development system which is free and runs on most 
computers.  Ken Dickey will give a live demo of the Squeak system,
starting at the 20,000 foot view (cool eToys) then getting into how
Smalltalk development works and down into the 1 foot level (like what
happens when you drop into the debugger).

Ken spend 5 years at Tektronix, 7 years at Apple, and more recently was
CTO of a startup in Sydney Australia

         Zupan's, on the North side of the street. (They may be on
         the south side of the street; they are moving, but have
         promised that there will be space for us to meet in.)

I've been assuming that the static is somehow travelling through the
mouse, which is sitting on a mouse pad that is sitting on the leather
topped metal table. Wouldn't that bypass the case?

Interesting. Do you know of a way to test the ground that doesn't
involve AC?

I used to get these years ago during tape backups (including the failure
of the kill -9), it turned out to be a kernel bug/race condition that
would happen on rare occasions, but as far as I can recall, it only
happened to me on pre 2.2 kernels.  The only possible cure for my problem
when I tracked down the cause was in fact a reboot, because (if I remember
correctly), the kernel code that was doing the I/O where it locked up was
coded incorrectly and did not allow for any kills in the loop where it
was waiting for an I/O event that would never come because of the race
condition.  What kernel version are you running?

I'll second this question as I'm having a similar problem w/ a stuck mt 
process. Same story, I can get the tape out, but mt lives on. Subsequent 
  mt stuff says /dev/nst0 is busy/unavailable. Shoot, a guy could have a 
pretty good time in Vegas if he knew how to kill a rogue mt process.

Thanks,

A big thanks to Russel for this.  Ken is booked, announcement is out,
and two more speakers are tentatively lined up:

For June 19:
 I penciled Chris Wright <chris at wirex.com> doing Linux Security Modules
(LSM)

For July 17:

Phil Tomson has offered to talk about an open source, object oriented,
task distribution framework he calls TaskMaster.  TaskMaster allows
users to easily create their own runnable Task objects that can be
distributed to multiple machines on a network (which are running a slave
program).

Here's the funny thing, Phil's email end;s with "Would this make a good
topic?"

People if you have projects like this, AT is the place to bring them. 
You do not need polished refined projects.

AT Talks can

1)  Require knowledge before asking questions, thus allowing you to dive
in deeper on issues.

2)  Have unanswer(ed|able) questions because are still working on it.

3)  Be a "position" piece, like Jeme's belief that all systems should
compile their software and we should do away with distributions, or mine
that you need verifiable software in the field, or Wil's that you should
make your own, or anything Karl believes.....

4)  Be half a talk that you are prepping.  Sometimes the room can help
you along.

5)  Be a talk you want to see done, but can only do half.

Also a big thanks to Bruce for finding the Space, and Galen maintaining
it!

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205141543070.23065-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  Can someone point me to detailed information on using OpenOffice's word
mangler? I'm trying to recreate my letterhead in the program and it insists
on underlining the e-mail address. The software doesn't know what I want to
do, but apparently I can no longer put an e-mail address in without it being
underlined.

  If there's a way to turn off the underlining, I'd greatly appreciate
knowing about it. I couldn't find it anywhere in the Format menu. Can I see
the codes the program inserts in a document, like I could with WordPerfect?

Thanks,

Rich

I'm pretty sure that the plastic mouse body would keep static from
"traveling" anywhere, it is a terrible conductor.  Computers are
designed to be fairly immune to static, once they are assembled and
hooked up correctly.  Most of the wires going into the machine have a
conducting foil layer just under the insulation, effectively extending
the Faraday shield to include the device.  I also tend to think that the
chipset controlling the mouse would not like the static hit at all. 
Does your mouse still work?

The best way to check it is with a load from the hot side to the ground
that is large enough to trip the breaker, but DON'T do this by just
sticking a hunk of wire between the hot leg and ground, that is very
dangerous and hard on other equipment in your house. A proper load box
can be made with a variable resistor (so you can bring on the load a
little slower than an instantaneous short), but finding one capable of
drawing 20 amps at 120 volts is really tough.  If physical inspection
doesn't convince you (a proper ground is made by driving a 12 foot
copper rod into the ground, water pipes should never be used as the
ground for a house -- water is a terrible conductor, the supply line
from the street is not deep enough and is probably made of plastic), you
could try making a test fixture with a 60 watt light bulb.

Un-click URL recognition.

BTW Open Office has help, it seems like all figures are missing for me,
but the text is there.  The index works.

New people must buy beer for all the people who have been there before.

Now there's a pyramid scheme!

No fee, its free as in beer (for me) and speech (for me).

But I will let you on a discounted version of our new .plug

I do not have an AutoFormat (I seem to remember it though, is that a
Star Office difference?).

"uname" says 2.4.16.  Oddly, about 5 minutes after I sent the message,
the process went away and I could at least "mt status" the drive.
But, when I tried to rewind, it hung again.  I am getting messages in
the logs that indicate some kind of failure (either communication or
hardware, not sure yet).  They look like:

   May 14 14:57:41 coulee kernel: scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 13945266, scsi0, channel 0, id 5, lun 0 Rezero Unit 00 00 00 00 00

I am thinking a nice gentle reboot at this point might clear it up.

No fee, ne RSVP pas, just show up.

Buying some food/beverages helps out with continuing to secure the
venue in the longer term ... we aren't paying them anything directly
for the space, so as long as we make it worth their while, it'll be
worth their while to let us use it.  At least, that's how I understand
the arrangement.

  I did this, Matt, before writing for help. Makes no difference! Also, the
date is underlined when I print the letterhead. ARRGGGHHH-H-H-H!!

  I've never used winWord so I have absolutely no idea how to turn off
things I don't want. In WordPerfect, I'd just reveal the codes and correct
as I pleased. Now I'm flying blind.

  What I want to do is:

  1) Turn off underlining for URLs, e-mail addresses and date fields that
are automatically updated when the document is opened.

  2) Tell OpenOffice that a specific printer is the default. No, I cannot
find a menu option under "preferences" that allows me to do that. Each time
I go to print, "generic printer" is selected.

  I suppose that some day I'll learn how to use this software and I can then
be productive. In the meantime, I've spent an hour trying to generate my
letterhead and I just keep going around in circles. Guess this means that
I'm a Big Wheel.

Thanks,

Rich

I'm able to do mt status on my drive, but anything else (mt rewind, mt

I've noticed that if it's already underlined an email address, turning off
AutoCorrect for URLs won't change previous text, but new email addresses
will not be underlined.  So try going back and removing the old and retype
it in.

Interesting,

Its the difference between Presentor and Word(?).

And setting in one, does not effect the setting in the other (kinda
cool,I like it in word, but not in presentations.

the two boxes are Modify and New.  (In word).

  Did that, Zot. Makes no difference.

  Do I have to close the document, then reopen it for the change to take
effect?

---------

What format was the document to start?  I noticed in 1.0 if I open with
a MS doc, it does not do spell checking.  Save it as a OO and it
does.....

Sometimes this has become a "field" and there is no quick way to get the
info.

One way I have done in MS Office, is cut and paste the info into another
type of program (notepad) and it results in text.

Paste Special can achieve similar results.

  Aha! Got it!

  I had to close the document, then re-open it. When I did, I was then able
to click the "U" button and turn off the underlining for both the e-mail
address and the date. That option wasn't available to me when I unclicked
the two Option boxes.

  Strange.

Thanks all!

Hello Linux folkz,
Does somebody know if there any graphical applications for Linux which
allow to create Perl CGI web interfaces a'la WYSWYG.
I'm programming CGI/FCGI web interfaces just by hand using plain vi.
It takes a considerable amount of time to write checkboxes, forms,
tables and other web interface elements.
I'm looking for something which allows to draw tables, forms e.t.c.
visually on the screen with possibility to convert them into Perl CGI
script.
Thank you in advance for any hints or sources of information.

Alex

This sounds like a problem with your SCSI bus.  Some controllers and/or
tape drives are very picky about the signal quality, cabling, what else is
on the bus and even what they will talk to.  I have a DDS-3 tape drive
which will not run reliably if any other SCSI device is on the bus with
it, so I finally just bought a separate SCSI controller for it which got
rid of the problems.  My experience with SCSI has been always buy name
brand controllers (preferably adaptec), use high quality cables, and avoid
anything from Seagate or any of the companies they bought out.

If you built your SCSI drivers as modules and you don't have any critical
hard drives connected to the controller, you can simply unload and reload
the SCSI driver to clear up any driver/kernel related issues, though if
you have hardware bus problems this won't really help for the long haul.

Matt,

  I tried that, too. As I discovered, only closing the document and
re-opening it would let me turn off the underlining.

  Now I'm working my way through setting up a mail merge database and
setting up the fields in the form letters.

Thanks for the help!

Subject: [PLUG] Linux Clinic this Saturday
Message-ID: <1021422743.2417.46.camel@dasher.riverdale.k12.or.us>

Hello Folks,

I'm sending out our usual announcement for our monthly Linux Clinic. I'm
also posting to a wider audience in hopes of sharing a bit of how our
local user group has helped us.

Our school plays host to the clinic every month on the 3rd. Saturday. We
invite Linux experts from the PLUG (Portland Linux/Unix User Group) to
come and help with software installs and configurations for local
schools, teachers, kids and the public at large.
http://www.riverdale.k12.or.us/~danh

We meet from 1:00 to 4:00 and there are always plenty of folks who come.
Everyone helps everyone. We often have goodies to pass out and after a
new Linux release it's not uncommon to have several CD-Rom burners going
full speed all afternoon.

We have our own workstations that boot into Linux from our terminal
server for people to play with and folks bring in their own hardware to
configure.

Let me think about this for just a minute, do I want Linux experts to
come to my school every month to help me use free, stable software to
provide cool technologies for my students? They won't charge me anything
and they enjoy providing support for our schools through our local
listserv on a 24x7 basis...  Duh... It doesn't take much to realize how
well this works! It's fun for the experts too though!

For those of you in the Portland area, come and join us. If you've never
used Linux before or just want to see what the fuss is all about, you
are welcome here.

If you're a school and you want to take your first steps this would be a
good time to come by. This Saturday we have a special going... We'll
configure your hardware to be an Appleshare server and toss in a web
server for free! ;-^)

My hope is that other LUGs out there would start hosting clinics. If you
are from a school, contact your local user group and offer to host a
clinic!

Linux Journal has a great LUG locater at:
http://www.ssc.com:8080/glue/groups along with all kinds of other good
LUG stuff.

Red Hat hosts another site with lots of links too!
http://www.redhat.com/apps/community/LUG/

If you are hosting clinics with your LUGs please let us know or post
your info on the K12OS.org site.

Lastly, I want to extend a big thank you to all the Linux users who have
helped us so much over the years. Your work and generosity really has
huge impact in our classrooms. I think we're just now starting to see
that in big ways. Helping a local school may seem like a small thing to
do but it sure makes a big difference.

Thanks!

;-) Paul

REMINDER!!! If you want to discuss the July 4th, Software Freedom Day,
come at 12:00 with your lunch.

Don't count on this, mice, keyboards, etc. are being designed and built
very cheaply these days, cutting corners wherever possible (I have seen
keyboard and mouse combinations for under $4).  Over the years I have
encountered a number of cheap mice and keyboards that I would regularly
arc to whenever I went to use them (customer equipment, I don't buy this
kind of junk), and on many occasions computer reset ensued.  Usually the
arcing would go between the mouse buttons or keys on the keyboard.  Also,
if there is more than one connection of the shielded components to the
protective shield (which is pretty much always the case with computers),
an alternate pathway for the current has been established - through - the
computer, and while the bulk of the discharge will follow the shield, for
a high voltage discharge, you can easily get enough of a potential across
internal components to cause problems through the alternate path.  The
only real protection in most office environments is to bleed off the
charge before it has the chance to do anything.  Anti-static sprays on
floors/carpeting, humidifiers, grounded desks and chairs all help a great
deal, though what made the biggest difference for me was a different pair
of shoes.

  Thanks to Shannon's experience with majordomo I learned that the error
messages and lack of logging was due to restrictive write permissions to
/var/log/. I wondered about this as I set up majordomo, then I forgot to ask
for advice. Foolish me!

  I changed permissions on /var/log/ to 757. Now user 'majordom' can write
to the logfile and the notice of error messages has gone. But, ... is this
the correct way to handle writing a log file by an application that does not
run suid or sgid 'root'?

Thanks,

This may be an easy question. When I want unformatted
output of a text file

$lpr textfile

the left margin is so narrow that about 2mm of the
text is cut off to the left. By the way, the printing
from my Linux box goes to a remote Samba printer. Is
there an easy way to adjust this?

YMMV, but I have found that something like this works great for text
files.

cat textfile | enscript | lpr

  Check out 'man enscript'.

  It doesn't have explicit margin settings, but it seems to use reasonable
margins by default. pine uses enscript when printing messages and I've fed
regular text files through it to get readable output.

Hello Folks,

So if a local writer asked you for some facts and success stories of how
Linux is growing and who's using it... What would you say?

Are there any local stories of businesses that have migrated to Linux.
Are you able to offer up some facts and figures?

If you were to make a "Who's Who?" list of business and important
projects running Linux, who would be on it?

I'm searching for articles on-line on a wider scale as well. Links would
be appreciated.

Last question, does anyone know of any other public agencies in Oregon
that have been audited by MS? I understand that this may not be a
favorite subject for the agency involved but I'd like to know about it.

Thanks,

;-) Paul

Other than schools? Well, there's one. The audit is ongoing, if I recall 
correctly. The Tech Cadre, part of Milwaukie High, is being audited, as 
part of the school system. It's not part of the school system, it's an 
external business funded with $0 from the school itself; except for the 
faculty advisor who helps keep things legal. But, anyway. If you want 
more information, said faculty advisor would be the one to talk to.. if 
you want more information, email me personally. (sstaples at

pr can do lots of nice things to plain text files including margins
paginating, headers, page numbers and making columns etc.

pr
Print formatting filter. This will paginate files (or stdout) into sections
suitable for hard copy printing or viewing on screen. Various options permit
row and column manipulation, joining lines, setting margins, numbering
lines, adding page headers, and merging files, among other things. The pr
command combines much of the functionality of nl, paste, fold, column, and
expand.

pr -o 5 --width=65 fileZZZ | more gives a nice paginated listing to screen
of fileZZZ with margins set at 5 and 65.

A particularly useful option is -d, forcing double-spacing (same effect as
sed -G).

I just wrote, and then deleted an overly long explanation of my house's
ground system. Since this subject is already fairly OT, I decided it
would be better if I just said that I'm confident that my ground is
good.

This sort of thing can drive an old unix CLI freak crazy.  The "cat"
in this instance is unnecessary.  Why not just:

   enscript < textfile | lpr

or better still, learn the "usage" of enscript ("enscript --help" or
"man enscript") and use that to your advantage:

   enscript textfile 

Because I don't like to waste paper, I always generate in intermediate
file and inspect it first with "gv".  But since I don't mind wasting
paper if it looks cool, I use fancy headers:

   enscript --fancy-header=emacs -o /tmp/test.ps textfile
   gv /tmp/test.ps
   lpr /tmp/test.ps

I see folks post advice like this on this list all the time.

I don't know about you folk, but my copy of enscript will take a filename
on the command line as well as standard input and it automatically invokes
lpr.

So to achieve the same as above, I just type:
enscript textfile

Just so you know.  Save you a few keystrokes.

If you bond everything to the case of your PC, there won't be a difference of 
potential between anything and your computer. As described by others, it's the 
differences in potential that kill hardware.

I wouldn't give much consideration to your house wiring is, unless you're trying 
to bond your house (which is impractical :-P)

Depending on what kind printer you have and what print spooling package
you use, it's possible that lpr is calling an input filter and doing some
formatting for the printer before the printer sees the thing.  I'd
recommend tracking down this info in your printer package and determining
where the page definition information is stored.

Folks here often recommend enscript and it's really nice, but out of habit
I still often use a2ps for printing plain text.  The page layout info for
that package is contained in /etc/a2ps.cfg or /etc/a2ps-site.cfg.

By the way, can someone tell me how to make enscript print 4-up like this:

When I try 4-up with enscript I get four pages equally divided across a
landscaped page.  Ugh.

Whittier Wood Products in Eugene, I've been told, is a great Linux shop.
And there's a credit union in Tillamook that is a known Linux shop
(Tillamook Bank, perhaps??).

I would think that many of the larger companies in the area have some
degree if Linux success in their IT shops, particularly any of the ISPs.
Linux plays a key roll at my ISP, PCs Made Easy.

Speaking of the land of cheese, I heard that Tillamook Bay Community
College is building an integrated MIS/Financial system with Linux.  I
haven't heard any updates on how it's going, but I'd like to find out...

Subject: [PLUG] APM resume & mouse problem
Message-ID: <15585.62698.409295.385463@soggy.deldotd.com>

When you are in X and suspend the machine all goes well.  When you
resume the mouse takes on a Mr. Hyde personality and does not do
anything sane.  It jumps all over the place and creates random button
presses.  Works flawlessly until you resume.

If you ctrl-alt-backspace X and then start again, everything is fine.

gpm is not even installed (can't believe how long gpm/X interaction
has remained broken in Debian) so I know that's not the problem.

I don't have a clue as to what's going on and a lot of searching on
google-groups didn't turn up anything useful - other than have apm
kill X and then restart it - which is not a solution.

Just to add insult to injury it's in that "it used to work category".

Help ?

Watch out for the newer ibmcams as the compression isn't supported.
Some of the Kensington cameras were good (800x600) but are now discontinued.

I don't have a "why" for you, but one possible work around.  I do alot of
things that screw up the mouse drivers in X, and I have found that
switching to a different virtual console using <ctl-alt-F1> and then back
again often clears up the problem without having to kill the X session.
As far as gpm and X under Debian, I haven't noticed any problems for a
couple years, though I don't really use the mouse on the console, gpm
just sits there idling.

Update.

If I use imps/2 protocol things don't work on resume.

If I use ps/2, they do.

^%!@#$^@%$#!!

Of course, the whole reason I'm using imps/2 is so that the wheel will
work, which it won't under ps/2.

Aaaargh.

Last time I checked, which was within the last 6 mos, it was broken.
It was the subject of some bitterness on the Debian mailing list.

So I solved the problem.  I installed the mouse as a USB device.
Wheel works.  Suspend/resume works.

Bizarre.

Great - thanks Ross !

Now you would have thought that I was clever enough to look at the usb
web-site.

I was just there to install the usb-mouse to fix my resume/mouse/X problem.

Just goes to show you that google is not always the answer - thought
it is the other 99% of the time :-)

Paul,

   This addresses something SEUL/edu has talked about for over a year
(although we haven't had the resources to do anything about it).  I hope
that through Schoolforge we can bring enough people and energy to bear to
develop this further.

   What I'm talking about is support materials for LUGs that want to do for
their local schools what PLUG is doing for the Portland schools.  Obviously,
they will have some preliminary work to do to get into their schools in the
first place; you had already done that bit.  But if we can develop useful
procedures for them to follow in contacting and communicating with the
school administrations and suggested ways in which they can help the schools
with their Linux installations, I think we can make Linux seem more like a
community-supported solution to a problem rather than a risky, eccentric
change to the standard operating procedure that it probably like to many
non-technical educators.

   Could you possibly collect, or ask someone else to collect, the materials
you use for your LUG/school interactions?  We may be able to use them as
templates for developing material useful to a wide range of circumstances.
Thanks!

There are a couple things you could do:

1. If you end up giving everyone permissions to write to /var/log 
   (realizing, of course, that "everyone" in your situation means only 
   you and your fiancee), then you might consider

   chmod 1777 /var/log

   The extra 1 on the beginning of the chmod string prevents "users 
   from removing or renaming a file in a directory unless they own the
   file or the directory; this is called the 'restriction deletion
   flag' for the directory." [From fileutils.info.]

   BTW. Having a world-writeable /var/log wouldn't be my first choice.

2. There may be a variable or run-time flag you can set that'll direct 
   majordomo to log into a different directory. If so, then you could 
   point it at, say, /var/log/majordomo and do something like

   mkdir /var/log/majordomo
   chown majordom /var/log/majordomo

Paul,

I don't remember the name of the corporation, but they are the parent 
to about 80 percent of the hotels and motels in the US. If you have 
stayed in a motel or booked reservations for one in the last couple of 
years, you have done so through a Linux system. There was an article 
about their changeover in Linux Today a couple of years ago. (2-3 ? 
gawd how time flies).  Also alot of the "point of sale" systems in 
restruants, and stores are switching over to a Linux base many of 
which believe it or not were still running CPM or DOS.

  For the past week I've seen multiple instances of this entry in
/var/log/maillog:

May 15 06:45:25 salmo postfix/smtpd[28861]: reject: RCPT from localhost.localdomain[127.0.0.1

  Sometimes the spam is addressed to me. The postfix header/body_checks are
working well, but I'm curious if anyone else is seeing this site in the mail
log. I'm not sure how to go about tracing the origin as I have a domain name
in Italy, not an IP address I can run through whois.ripe.net.

  It's a bandwidth waster, that's all.

  Check out <http://www.linas.org/linux/>.

  For a start, from the "linux in business" section:

* Linux in Business - Case Studies provides a rich set of stories of Linux
deployment in large and small companies, including examples from
Southwestern Bell, the Burlington Coat Factory, special effects for the
Academy-Award-winning movie Titanic and the US Post Office.
* Linux for Business provides examples and references to case studies for
the use Linux in business settings.
* M-Tech maintains a listing of companies using Linux on its Linux Business
Applications page.
* Linux en Enterprise (en fran?ais), a list of French companies that use
Linux in their business. Includes contacts.

Happy hunting!

Sounds like they were simply following the "don't fix what ain't broke"

Subject: [PLUG] Printing Problem
Message-ID: <006501c1fc18$4ab9f4c0$3c010b0a@assi.bigrocksports.com>

I am having a print spooler problem. I just took down our NT server and
replaced it with a Red Hat 7.1 Server. We have a HP Laser Jet 4100N printer.
I set the printer up using Webmin and there are no Red Hat drivers for the
4100N so I used the drivers for the 4000. I set the print destination to
|/usr/share/printconf/jetdirectprint
In the printcap file, the printer is set up as:
hp4100:sd=/var/spool/lpd/hp4100:sh;mx#0:ml#0:lp=|/usr/share/printconf/jetdir
ectprint:if=/usr/share/printconf/mf_wrapper:

When text documents are sent to the printer, they print off write away. When
any FrameMaker graphic documents are sent to the printer, one page is
printed and then it waits about 1 minute and then prints another page. The
graphics employee said that when we used NT the pages printed one right
after the other.

They also have a hp4000 printer. I had her print to that printer and the job
took 3 minutes to print, whereas when she printed to the hp4100, it took 14
minutes.

Any ideas as to what changes I need to make?

Thanks!

Mary

I heard something about a good local source for laptop

There's also Burlington Coat Factory and Google.  I know there's a site or
two out there that lists companies using Linux, but I can't seem to find
it right now...

Regarding Ray's comment about Linux POS systems, I've tossed around the
idea in my head of marketing Linux POS systems to businesses...  Are there
any businesses currently specializing in Linux POS systems?  Seems like it
wouldn't be to hard to do...  Maybe another pursuit of the PLUG Business
idea that was being tossed around a couple months ago?

  Perhaps I've not had enough caffine this morning, but I don't quite follow
this. However, I think it might work to have the log written to /tmp rather
than /var/log. Is there a flaw to doing this of which I am naive?

What's the name of the logfile that it's actually writing to?  If it's
something like "majordomo", then you could have 755 permissions on
/var/log and chown the majordomo logfile to whatever user majordomo is
running as.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205150955480.28708-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I've spent the past hour in the OpenOffice help system trying to learn how
I can set up an addressbook so I can generate form letters by mail merge. I
got to the point of finding where I can create an addressbook database type
(both collected and personal), and I've defined the fields, but I just
cannot find a hieroglyph or menu item that allows me to enter data into that
table. I've rummaged back and forth through the help system links, starting
with 'mail merge', and I cannot find the 'edit' icon to which they refer.

  Has anyone done this? Are there other docs available to supplement the
on-line help system? I don't think I'm really so dumb that I cannot
understand what I read, but I'm certainly missing something here.

Thanks,

Rich

/tmp usually gets emptied upon reboot.  If you want consistent logs of your 
activities, the best place to put them would be /var/log - where all of the 
other log files go.

I'm not so sure that the pursuit of stability is all that far OT.  

Maybe Shannon has a point about the lack of quality of parts these
days.  I have been working with computers for a few years, and have yet
to have a system reset because of a static hit, but the costumers
usually would bring in the systems without mice, keyboard and monitor. 
I personally think (given that your grounding is good) that you should
pursue this as a hardware problem (try changing the mouse or get an
anti-static pad for the mouse), not an environmental condition that
needs to be dealt with on a daily basis.

I hope that you will keep us updated on this issue.

Yes.

Principally, that /tmp traditionally gets wiped on a reboot.  

As others have suggested, just create a subdirectory of /var/log that
is owned by whatever user owns the process that is creating it.

Matt,

  The file is:

-rw--w--w-   1 majordom daemon        276 May 14 21:28 majordomo.log

  My problem has been that /var/log/ itself is writable only by root. I
*think* that I need o+w on the directory so that majordomo can write to the
log file. Read and execute permissions weren't sufficient. That's why there
were no log entries and majordomo was returning an error message at the
bottom of each response it sent.

Thanks,

Rich

Looks like a fairly common spammer return address domain:
http://groups.google.com/groups?q=virgilio+group:news.admin.net-abuse.*&hl=e
n&scoring=d

It looks like www.virgilio.it is a Yahoo-like portal so I bet they have free
email that spammers use as dropboxes.

chown majordomo /var/log/majordomo.log
chmod 600 /var/log/majordomo.log

Majordomo will be able to write to the log, but since it doesn't have
write access to /var/log, it won't be able to delete it (which should be
fine).  You can use logrotate just like you did for your maillog to rotate
the majordomo.log.

Plus, it wouldn't surprise me at all to see future versions of Linux 
distributions mount /tmp as a tmpfs volume, meaning that it'd live in 
memory/swap rather than in the root filesystem.

Linux Clinic every 3rd Saturday. check it out on the 
plug home page.

I loaded SuSE 8.0 on my server over the weekend.  Went 
fairly smoothly except for a mistake I made with my 
vidio card, but recovered nicely.  The new YAST seems 
fairly streamlined and KDE 3.0 does seem a little 
zippier.  I still need to fix a couple configuration 
issues, but nothing has bit me yet that wasn't easy to 
fix.  The biggest pain was, I kept running into 
everything thinking I wanted A4 paper size.

As a side note, I was inspired last night and installed 
up to stage 3 of the Gentoo Distribution onto my Sony 
Vaio laptop.  Pretty slick and easy to install if you 
follow the instructions.  I'll be more descriptive once 
I get the machine tweaked to my preferences and have a 
little time to get a feel for it.

The nice thing about KDE 3.0.x is that when you change the paper size 
and "Save" it from within the printer properties dialog, it actually 
gets saved now. With KDE 2.x I would change the paper size from A4 to 
US Letter and save it but the next time I brought up a program to print 
something, the paper size was back to A4 again.

Everything is fine here...they're reporting it as a 4.3 on NWCN just
west of the city

It was pretty tame...Power, phone and Charter cablemodem do not seem to
have been affected, our KLUG server didn't protest.

I doubt my upcoming CST test will be postponed. :)

This will probably be old news by the time most read this, but it looks

I know at least two companies using linux for POS.  Both have been SCO shops for
years and are now almost fully converted.  All new installs are Linux.  I have
not asked them if I could tell anyone though.  If I get clearance I will let you
know their names.  They are still SCO VARs, so It may not be quite the right

Sorry. Didn't mean that system stability wasn't a suitable topic for

Can't say for sure about the mouse. I got it with my laptop as part of
the equipment we got at school. It's a Mitsumi PS2 scroll mouse. It
doesn't have a wheel, but has a knob that acts like a wheel. The click
noise isn't too loud, either. The only thing I don't like about it is
that fuzz collects on the shafts of the slotted disks that turn inside
in response to the movement of the ball. Every so often I have to take
it apart and use tweezers or an Xacto knife to carefully extract the
fuzz. I also have a Logitech wheel mouse. I like everything about it
except the noise of the click, which is loud.

The machine itself is cheap. I got it a couple of years ago at Bi-Mart.
Carries the name, V-Box, and was distributed by Avatar Technology.
Unfortunately, as often happens with going the cheap route, support is
no longer available for this machine. Next time, I'll visit one of the
local shops that builds machines. I'll spend a little more, but there
will be someone to take the machine to if something needs work.

All that to say that the machine may have a lot of cut corner in the
construction department. However, it still works reasonably, other than
the occasional static reset.

Tony.

  Probably.

  I'm just starting to feel my way around in the program so I read a lot of
the help files and try to understand what they're telling me.

  I was hoping to use a link to jpilot, but cannot find a way of doing so.
Alternatively, I could export the jpilot AdressbookDB.pdb, except that this
function is not working currently :-( I have a message in to Judd about
this. (The only database that jpilot can export -- at least, in our
installations here -- is the datebook. None of the others work.)

Thanks,

I've upgraded several SuSE 7.2 systems to 8.0 a little over a week ago 
and the upgrades were pretty smooth. I had a couple of minor issues 
with printers not working and some weirdness in the KDE migration from 
KDE 2.x to 3.x. A bit of time spent configuring KDE3 fixed the KDE  
problems. 

To fix my printing problems I deleted and recreated the printers through 
YaST2. I guess SuSE 8.0 handles printing a bit differently than what 
7.2 did.

I do know that some SuSE users are quite upset about /etc/rc.config file 
not being used store the system configuration stuff anymore. Some users 
got used to editing the file directly. The new configuration scheme 
seems better with configuration settings stored off in an 
/etc/sysconfig directory structure. Should be easier to maintain rather 
than having a single, large configuration file like SuSE of old has.

Yast is VERY nice. And hardware configuration is a dream compared to past
Linux distros.

I'll email you in a bit. I might try to make the clinic. Not sure what you
mean by detecting PNP? It detects hardware very well. I know that. I had
no problems whatsoever with any sound or video card on the 3 computers
I've loaded it on thus far, except my little brother's ESS 1869 sound card
and that was easily manually configured.

Check out www.aaxnet.com/design/linux2.html.  They have a short list.

Also, our company uses Linux for a POS system for the Auto Lube
industry.  Shops like Texaco XPress Lube, Oil Can Henry's etc.. 

We are also looking into using LTSP internally for our Support Staff.

How's that for a confusing subject line?

Anyway, the real question is:

Who wants to see Star Wars: Rout^H^H^H^HAttack of the Clones at Lloyd
Cinemas tonight at midnight after the ALT meeting?

I figure we'll leave after the meeting and rotate through standing in line
or hang out together for a while and then go in and see if the movie is
anything like enjoyable.

If you want to do this, let me know and I can get tickets.  I'll probably
pick up tickets at 4ish... so let me know before then.

Some many months ago I added a drive to my Linux machine. During the
process a directory was created called lost+found. I assume it happened
as part of some script that I was told to run. It is currently empty.
Does it serve some purpose such that if I deleted it I would mess
something up?

Is there a standard way to use an rpm but send it the options I would
want it to compile the binary with.

I like being able to query the rpm database to see what is installed and
the ease of uninstalling which is why I like RPM, but I need to install
something now that I want to compile using non-standard options.  (To be
specific, it is aspell).  Is there a way to do that?

Ironically, tomorrow morning at 6am my better half and our 4yo are

You could always build from the tarball, then make a binary rpm.

Richard;

This directory is created anytime you create a new filesystem on a drive
with 'mkfs.' This was one of the commands your script executed to create
the new filesystem.

The ext2fs filesystem creates this directory automatically. Linux
(specifically fsck) uses this directory to place fragments of files that
it cannot correctly place back into the filesystem. A hard system crash
can cause this to happen. Sometimes (though not usually), the filesystem
"looses" the file's logical placement on the disk.

With e2fsck, it's generally up to the administrator to find out where
these go and repair the damage. The "Filesystems HOWTO" at
http://www.linuxdocs.org/HOWTOs/Filesystems-HOWTO.html for details.

At the practical level you can safely ignore this directory it's there
"just in case."

It's also a good thing to look for if you want to know if the directory
is a mount point.

This is just a guess, but here goes.  Perhaps FrameMaker is generating
postscript output, and your redhat box is running ghostscript to convert
it to hp pcl, then sending it to the printer.  That sort of configuration
could definitely slow things down.  I would try ensure that no rendering
is being done by the server, though I can't tell you specifically how to
do this.  Perhaps someone else can jump in with some assistance.

Step one to find the rpm 
	rpmfind `rpm -qi aspell| grep Source | awk -F: '{print $3}'`

	This should give you a source rpm, or goto

wget 
ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/7.3/en/os/i386/SRPMS/aspell-0.33.7.1-9.src.rpm

Step 2: Install source rpm rpm -U aspell-0.33.7.1-9.src.rpm

cd /usr/src/redhat/SPEC

vim/pico/emacs aspell.spec

find the line with \|/ From %configure
To %configure --enable the configure options you want

Step 3: pray to the rpm god that it will build

Step 4: Build your rpm
rpm -ba /usr/src/redhat/SPEC/aspell.spec

Just clarifying, while you can ignore it, DO NOT DELETE IT.  If it should
be accidentally removed, don't create it by using mkdir, use mklost+found.
Basically this is a directory pre-initialized to be large enough to hold a
significant number of "lost" files.  If your system crashes and the file
system is full (not uncommon, since full file systems often caused system
crashes though I haven't seen this problem under Linux for many years),
then there would be no way for the fsck to save the lost files, since it
would need to create a directory to put them in on a file system which
doesn't have any room to create them.

NOTE: Not all file system types need or use a lost+found directory.

  Yes.

  Every filesystem has a lost+found/ directory. And, I suppose, we all asked
this question at some point. It needs to stay there and it doesn't take up
much room.

  If your system crashed, unidentified pieces of files would be put in this
directory. You then have the opportunity to rummage through the bits and see
if you can put them back into usable form.

  I hope you never see any contents in any of them!

In general, the procedure would be

1. Grab the source rpm (e.g., aspell-0.33.7.1-9.src.rpm).

2. "Install" the source rpm: rpm -i blah.src.rpm. I put "install" in 
   quotes because installing a source rpm doesn't put any binaries in 
   your system. Instead, on a Red Hat system, it puts some files in 
   the /usr/src/redhat directory tree:

   /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES -- source files and any patches
   /usr/src/redhat/SPECS   -- the .spec file

   Unless you've run chown or chgrp against /usr/src/redhat, you'll 
   need to be root to do this. On my systems, I add myself to the 
   'wheel' group (gid 10) and then, as root, do

   chgrp -R wheel /usr/src/redhat/*
   chmod -R g+w   /usr/src/redhat/*

   That way, I can build RPMs as me. (You can also reach this goal by
   redefining %_topdir in a custom $HOME/.rpmmacros file.)

3. Edit the appropriate .spec file in /usr/src/redhat/SPECS. In your 
   case, it looks as if you'd want to focus on the stuff in the %build 
   section of the .spec file, which is where the ./configure step is
   typically executed.

   Also, you might want to increment or modify the "Release:" line 
   near the top of the .spec file. If it said "Release: 9", you might 
   consider editing it to read "Release: 9jj". That way, rpm will 
   think you're installing a later version of the package (and it'll 
   be easier to find your local mods since you can do something like 
   "rpm -qa | grep jj").

   I suggest that you edit the .spec file as little as possible to 
   accomplish your goals. The folks at Red Hat (and, presumably, SuSE 
   and the other rpm-based distros) do some pretty subtle things that 
   might break as an unintended consequence of your edits.

4. Rebuild the rpm:

   rpm -ba blah.spec                 # for i386 binary packages
   rpm -ba --target i686 blah.spec   # for i686 packagess
   rpm -ba --target athlon blah.spec # for athlon packages

   The binary packages will end up in the appropriate directory in the 
   /usr/src/redhat/RPMS tree. The new source package, including your 
   modified spec file, will end up in /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS.

5. Install the new rpm:

   rpm -Fvh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/<arch>/blah-<version>.<arch>.rpm

Let us know if you have troubles...

Thanks for the info. Sounds like I ought to keep lost+found around. I
came up with a work around for my purposes. I installed the drive (60gb)
for storing mp3 files. The plan is to have the music organized by
directory, Classical, Jazz, Popular, etc. I've worked up a php script to
display directories in one column of a table, and files in another. For
the juke box application, the lost+found directory has no meaning, so I
just test for it and don't display it.

Maybe the problem is in the testing/unstable version (particularly with
the new version of X)?  I normally only run stable, though I have just
started installing testing in anticipation of the next release.

  Get the .src.rpm and install it ('rpm -ivh <package>.src.rpm'). cd to
/usr/src/redhat/SPECS/ and run 'rpm -ba --<options_here> <package>.spec'.
Rather than just rebuilding the package, the "build all" option works from
the spec file and will accept the same options as could be fed to
./configure.

Hi.

I'm about to take a kind of plunge.

In an effort to avoid actually practicing becoming a better programmer,
I'm going to attempt to build, configure, and leanr to use emacs under the
guise that it will make programming easier when and if I ever work harder
to actually improve my skills.  (I'm also kind of looking forward to using
a truly GPL mail reader that does everything I want it to do, but that's a
maybe right now.)

So, I'm just putting out feelers to find out if there is anything I need
to know before building emacs from source.  Is there some option that
needs to be compiled in to allow me to use particular modules, extensions,
or scripts?  Roughly how big is an emacs installation?  Should I create a
special /usr/local/emacs to hold all the emacs-specific stuff?  How many
of the add-ons need to be rebuilt when emacs is rebuilt?

My intent is to build GNU Emacs.  I am, of course, generally more
concerned with the social, legal, and political aspects of the software
than the technical merits, but I will consider particular comparisons and
contrasts to other Emacs streams to help inform my decision.

Anyway, this is an open call.  What can y'all tell me that'll help my
transition?

I've got a book (O'Reilly's Learning GNU Emacs -- the gnu book).  I don't
really have money for another.  I can look at the FSF's manual online, of
course.

But building the thing is another story.  So, if you've got something to
say, I'd like to hear it.

J.

  Many thanks, Zot. I figured it all out; at least, a way that works for me.

  I export my jpilot addressbook in CVS format, then I told OO where it was
to be found. I figured out how to specify the proper external database and
OO read the available fields properly. Then I specified the appropriate
addressbook field for each OO merge field and all's well.

  So, after 18 years of using WordPerfect to process words, it's now
relegated to standby status for when I need to access one of the many, many
documents produced there. The templates I'll convert by exporting them from
WP as rtf files and bringing them into OO that way. It'll take a while to
get used to the slow loading and MS-Word paradigm, but I'm sure that I'll
find a lot to like about it.

Thanks all,

Rich

I've never built emacs on Linux--only on HP-UX and Solaris.  It's just
too easy (on Debian) to type in "apt-get install emacs21".  It's pretty
straightforward, IIRC, but using your system's package manager is likely to
make it less painful.

Legal:  Gotta love the GPL!  For most purposes, you can just start using
emacs, so you don't have to worry about running afoul of the license.

Social:  I'm afraid I am unfamiliar with this term :-).  But seriously,
most people cannot tell that I use emacs (although this will change as I
subject more people to HTML files (written manually with emacs'
excellent HTML mode) and PDF (generated from my latex files)).

Political:  I have found that many developers prefer working with IDEs.
Unfortunately, these tools impose their own proprietary organizational
stuff which make it potentially messy (and sometimes impossible) to work
outside that tool.  I have not found a compelling argument against "Well,
(xxx IDE) has a built-in debugger".  Also, I have yet to meet a manager
who was impressed that I know emacs.

As for actually learning how to use emacs, I started out with a hard
copy of the FSF's manual, and now I go googling or ask my emacs-using
friends whenever I have a question.

Generally, I have been using emacs for 3.5 years (since 19.x), and have
grown to love it.  I use it for writing documents (when I can get away
with it) and writing code.  I don't wish to start a religious war, but I
would say that very few applications are as powerful and extensible as
this one.

Now if you will excuse me, I have some Tetris to play on emacs v21...

I use GNU Emacs.

It is trivial.  Build-wise, you needn't worry about a thing.
configure ; make ; make install.  I usually add
--prefix=/packages/emacs/emacs21 to configure, but that is local
seasoning.  You used to need to say --with-pop in order to use pop3 to
get mail into Gnus, but I think as of GNU Emacs 21, that configure
requirement went away.

I've got that book too.  I haven't cracked it in about 8 years.

Jeme> I can look at the FSF's manual online, of course.

There is a tutorial built in to Emacs as well. "C-h t"

The other thing you'll want (at least until you've trained your
fingers) is the "GNU Emacs Reference Card".  It'll be located in
etc/refcard.ps

On your box, building will go very quickly, so don't worry, just jump
in, the water is fine.  If you screw something up (very unlikely) just
rm -rf the "prefix" directory and try again.

What _can_ get hairy is your .emacs file, but it doesn't have to.
Just add things as you need them.  I've got sort of a useful
"gnus-select-persona" that I hacked myself that lets me easily switch
who I want to appear to be in Gnus.  

You'll eventually have to learn a little emacs lisp, but that's a
*GOOD* thing.

Jeme,

GNU emacs is one of the most well-behaved software packages on the 
face of the planet. It'll install itself and run from just about any 
directory structure you desire. Running "./configure --help" will list 
all the options. Here's what I used when I built 21.1 for the 
developers at my last job:

./configure \
  --prefix=/usr/local/emacs-21.1 \
  --with-x-toolkit=lucid \
  --with-xpm \
  --with-jpeg \
  --with-tiff \
  --with-gif \
  --with-png \
  --with-x

But there are lots of other options, too. In general, its build 
process is incredibly sane and well thought-out.

My system doesn't have a package manager.  I've never built one.

Well, there's no EULA at all.  The GPL is a distribution license.

However, Stallman is absolutely right in that the distribution license of
XEmacs is VERY difficult to enforce, since there are numerous copyright
holders and many undocumented authors.  Hence, a person can use XEmacs
code in violation of the GPL (i.e. through redistribution of modified code
or simple code theft in a distribution not bound by the GPL) and it would
be almost impossible to redress that particular violation.

If we are weak, we will be toppled.

I can't tell if you're trying to be glib or flip or what.  By social, I,
of course, mean the social implications of the Free Software movement and
the spirit of cooperation and mutual aid that it fosters.

Well, again, I was refering to the politics of Free Software, but your
point is well-taken on its own merits.

Yeah, I'd like to buy that book, but I don't have any money right now.

Right.  I definitely understand the advantages and am sold on the idea of
at least giving it a shot.

I'm really looking for any information folks might have about building
Emacs from source and hearing any particular arguments against GNU Emacs
that might be compelling for their technical merit.

Thanks again.  Your note is helpful.

Right.  That's the sort of thing I was hoping to hear -- build options and
so on.

I think I'll probably go ahead and create a separate emacs tree somewhere.

I'm concerned about these add-ons and things like Gnus.  I assume that
that one, in particular, comes standard in the GNU Emacs source tree, but
what about all these modes that Karl references constantly?  Are they
standard?  And if not, how are they installed?  I assume they're just lisp
files that get dropped in some standard place, but should they be kept
separate from the version-specific emacs tree for easy upgrade of the main
program or must they be updated with the new version anyway, making a
version-independent tree moot?

I really have no idea what I'm writing about here.

Well, I have the second edition... it's about 6 years old.  Heh.

Helpful.  Thanks.

I'll print that.  But I also have the Quick Reference Card from the back
of the O'Reilly book.  Did O'Reilly ever make a GNU Emacs Pocket
Reference?  I find the perl and CVS books quite helpful.

Likely that'll be tomorrow.  Thanks.

I read somewhere that bracket matching wasn't inherently supported in the
usual programming modes of GNU Emacs.  Is that still true?

That's probably the primary feature that isn't supported (easily) in the
usual GPL MUAs.

I hope so.

Thanks, as always.

I think that it's a safe assumption that any company of sufficient size
(e.g., with a dedicated IS staff) will have at least one Linux box
somewhere in the system. (Unless it's a *BSD box.)

My reasoning is simple: there are enough network services (DHCP, file
sharing, DNS, firewalls, etc.) that while fragile if implimented using
Microsoft technology are simple & reliable if a techie with a clue
takes an old box, installs her/his favorite *nix variant on it, performs
the necessary configuration, & thus can count on some small corner of
the network to stay stable, while lying to the PTB that yes, they have a
100% MS environment. (And if the PTB don't need to be lied to, they
don't care about the details of how the techies do their work -- & the
techie is free to adopt Linux/BSD as she/he sees fit.)

My wife reports that Linux is used at her current employer, Rentrak.
(She recognized it on a IT workstation.) I had a temp job earlier this
year where the head of IT admitted their firewall are a pair of Linux
boxes. When I worked at Quality Logic, the firewall for the local office
ran on Slackware Linux.

Yes, this is all anecdotal evidence. But I'm willing to bet that if
you asked any head IT guy if they ran Linux in their office, he'd admit
that there's a Linux box or two somewhere in the organization.

As far as I can tell, all supercomputing research is done on clusters
of Linux boxes, using Beowulf technology; projects using specialized
Cray, SGI or high-end Suns have dwindled in numbers to nothing, due
to the cost benefits of Linux on commodity hardware.

All computer-generated animation for movies & television are now done
on Linux boxes. Titanic & Lord of the Rings have acknowledged using
Linux technology; I expect there are more examples out there. (If any
major movie used CGI done on Win2K or NT boxes, would you expect MS
to have NOT blared their horn long & hard about it?)

There is usually a "site-lisp" directory, where you put non-built-in
packages.  Of course, you can put them anywhere and just point at them
by modifying the load-path variable, e.g.:

  (setq load-path (append load-path '("/common/share/emacs/site-lisp/ESS-5.1.21"))

Non-standard packages typically come with installation instructions,
which ought to help.

That's probably about as good.

It works in mine, but my .emacs is Rather Extensive and hasn't been

Here's the guts of it:

   (defun gnus-select-persona (&optional key)
     (interactive)
     (when (null key)
       (setq key (completing-read "Gnus Persona: "
                                  gnus-persona-alist
                                  nil t)))
     (setq gnus-active-persona key)
     (let ((persona-info (cdr (assoc key gnus-persona-alist))))
       (while persona-info
         (set (car persona-info) (cadr persona-info))
         (setq persona-info (cddr persona-info)))
       key))

The variable, gnus-persona-alist, looks like this:

   (setq gnus-persona-alist
         '(("aracnet" 
            user-full-name "Russell Senior"
            user-mail-address "seniorr at aracnet.com"
            message-user-organization "As much as seems appropriate"
            message-signature-file "~/.sig-aracnet")
           (...)
           (...)
           (...)))

The only real shortcoming in this is that the message-signature-file
gets inserted when you start a message, so that if you change your
mind about which persona is sending it after you start, you need to
change the signature manually.

I've had to wrestle with gpm (that protocol didn't work lets try this

I suspect this is ancient history at this point, but I can tell you that
it used to be quite interesting porting emacs to a new architecture.  During
the build process, a minimal version of emacs would be run after it had
been linked.  At that point, the core lisp code would get loaded into
memory.  This lisp code would be located in the data or bss section
(my memory is a bit fuzzy here).  Then emacs would play some very tricky
games by calling a function named 'unexec'.  This would alter the section
boundaries such that the just loaded lisp code would be merged into the 
text section.  Then the image was written to disk to create your new
emacs executable.

I did this for one of the original Tektronix NS32000 boxes.  I certainly
learned much from the exercise.

So much for the good old days.  With the current autoconf build process,
I doubt you will have much trouble at all.  After installing, you will
probably end up with directories like /usr/share/emacs, or 
/usr/local/share/emacs.  This is where all of the elisp code ends up.
site-lisp is a directory that holds site specific elisp.  It typically
holds elisp code that is acquired outside of the regular emacs build.

If you are just starting out with emacs, I'm certain there are plenty of
people here who can answer questions.

This looks more like a kernel-hardware problem.  What kind of harddrive
controller are you running?  What version is your kernel and who
compiled it?

I've seen similar errors while installing on an ABIT BE6 with the
onboard HotPoint controller.  Basic disk access is provided by the
controllers BIOS, so that OS's can see the drives without any drivers
loaded, but full functionality is not realized until the drivers for the
controller are loaded.

Are you using Samba since you say you replaced a NT server? One thing I 
do with Samba is to set it up so that any shared printers that are 
accessible from Samba go to "raw" printer queues. The "raw" printer 
queue does no input or output filtering as it is assumed that the print 
data is already in a format the printer can handle. The Windows-based 
clients use the appropriate Windows-based printer driver to produce the 
output the printer can handle. 

To make things even easier it is possible to specify the name of the 
print driver a remote printer in Samba uses so Windows will 
automatically install and use the appropriate printer driver when the 
printer is setup on a Windows client.

I know FrameMaker runs on Macs and Unix as well so I may be solving the 
wrong problem here. I apologize if my response doesn't answer your 
question.

Unexec is still used as far as I can tell.  See for example the Emacs
function dump-emacs.  C-h f tells me this:

   dump-emacs is a built-in function.
   (dump-emacs FILENAME SYMFILE)

   Dump current state of Emacs into executable file FILENAME.
   Take symbols from SYMFILE (presumably the file you executed to run Emacs).
   This is used in the file `loadup.el' when building Emacs.

   You must run Emacs in batch mode in order to dump it.

I think several other common programs use this technique.  I am pretty
sure Perl at least used to be one of them.

I don't have a favorite IRC client. I have RedHat 7.2 on a laptop

that configuration, that runs without alot of tweaking on my part?

Learning emacs is part of improving your programming skills.  It will
make you a better and more productive programmer.  Learn to use "etags"
("make TAGS") to find your way around in code, to use "pcl-cvs" ("M-x
cvs-examine") and "ediff", and you'll be a lot farther along than most
of those obstinate fools who still insist on using "vi" in xterms for
everything.

Ah, feelers are beginning to appear.  The metamorphosis has begun!

As always, my advice is to "apt-get source emacs21", and see what they
did.

:-)  The "social, legal and political" aspects are not what define the
real differences between GNU Emacs and XEmacs.  It's the differences in
how they are implemented that matter, to those who care to read the
code.

I like them both.  Lately, I've been using GNU Emacs 21.  It's a little
faster, the font-locking works better than XEmacs, etags works better,

There's an nice Emacs Lisp tutorial that's worth getting and reading. 
It's really a very good language.

That depends on what you mean by "alot of tweaking."  BitchX does

Since he's got Red Hat 7.2, ircII is the text-mode client installed. 
Run it like this:

Message-ID: <1021517314.15696.21.camel@summanulla.clueserver.org>

Office Despot had 7.3 in stock today, so I picked up a copy.

I won't get into install issues.  (It does not like my daughter's
machine at all, but that may be DMA problems.)

The box comes with a registration card with serial number, a quick guide
to redhat network, and a thin 140 page manual.  There are eight cdroms
included in the package.

3 install discs (The ones you can download)
2 source discs (Also downloadable)
A documentation disc (which is downloadable and only ~50 megs)
A disc of applications (not downloadable, except on warez sites.)
Star Office 5.2

I was kind of disappointed that they did not ship OpenOffice 1.0 or Star
Office 6.0. I am not certain why they chose to go that route.

As for the applications disc... It contains:

AC3D 3.x
Adobe Acroread 4.05
Alladin Stuffit 5.1.6
Beacon Fax2SendComplete 2.1
Datan dataplore 2.0
A bunch of fonts from Larabie
Photodex Compupic 5.1
Sun Forte
Sun Java JRE and SDK 1.3.1 (In bin format, not rpm packages)
VariCAD 8.1.0

The Star Office disc also has bin install files and not rpms.

As far as I can tell, there are no printed instructions on installing
the Star Office disc or the applications disc.  They have autorun files,
but I have not tested them.

I will have more information when I get it installed on a system.  My
current system has too much Ximian Gnome components on it.  It does not
like my daughter's machine.  I have a system running Redhat 7.3 beta 2.
It will probably get installed on that.

[Another interesting note.  "Ximian" is not in the spell checker used by
Evolution, which is made by Ximian.]

More when I have a chance to play with it...

Maybe these reasons:

SO 6.0 is for sale by Sun.

Subject: [PLUG] Network monitoring tool?
Message-ID: <20020516042642.45C257468A@john.meissen.org>

I have a Linux gateway configured at a friend's house. It runs
DHCP and provides NAT services for the internal network. The
internal network consists of three or four Macs, several Windows
desktops and notebooks and an occasional Linux machine.

I'm running MRTG on it so we can monitor the state of the external
connection (an 802.11b link with a pair of Cisco bridges). Sometimes,
late at night when there should be no one up, I see significant
increases in both inbound and outbound traffic. The last episode
started at 10PM and ran at a pretty steady rate until almost
exactly noon the next day (a school day, no one should have been
home).

I'm monitoring both NICs, so I can see that the traffic is flowing
through the Linux machine to/from someplace on the LAN. What I
need to do is isolate which machine is doing it.

Is there any tool that can give me NAT statistics, so I can monitor
traffic flow based on the internal IP addresses? I've found a
lot of tools that will do state monitoring of systems, but so
far nothing that will give me what I need.

What kind of machines are on the internal network? Could you install snmp 
on them and monitor what's going on there?

Alternatively, snort may do what you wish, although the setup time would be 
a considerable investment.

As I said, mostly a mix of Macs and various Windows machines. I can't
easily get to any of them, since I'm not local to the machines.

What I need is a combination of kernel statistics and some reporting
facility. The data may already be there, I don't know enough about
the current IP Masq procedure to know.

Star Office 6.0 is available on Mandrake 8.2 which was released a few

Subject: [PLUG] Lilo Warning: Int 0x13 function
Message-ID: <51AE6EA505FCD111AB5600805F653ACB010AA11D@EXCHANGE>

Is it possible to send your kernel/lilo versions and partition information
(or best guess) to the list?  If so, do so.

Hard drive 1 Partition 1 (/dev/hda1) = x MB
Hard drive 1 Partition 2 (/dev/hda2) = x MB
Hard drive 1 Partition 3 (/dev/hda3) = x MB
Hard drive 2 Partition 1 (/dev/hdb1) = x MB

Or something like that is good for a hint.  Output from fdisk or other
partition tool would be best, but maybe not simple to get at unless you have
a boot disk (with those tools) handy.

I know you can get something like that error if the boot image resides past
a certain cylinder (1024 sounds familiar) on your drive with some older
kernel/bootloader combos.  The fact that yours is on hda3 makes me want to
eliminate that possibility first.

Perhaps that isn't the problem, but the info is still good for a starting
point.


Also... is this a new install, or was it working before?  And if it was
working before, what did you do to it? :)

How much do you want to pry?

http://www.ntop.org
Very intrusive, as in nothing private,	logger. You can know where everyone has
been and when.

http://cebu.mozcom.com/riker/iptraf/
IPtraf in IP Traffic Monitor mode might also work. Shows connections.

http://www.tcpdump.org/
The, I think, most likely to be install packet capture utility.

http://www.ethereal.com/
Another packet capture, one of my favorite programs to show how good Linux is.
mostly I talking with network types. 


http://www.snort.org/ 
snort in logger mode. Less likely to fill you disk.  

http://netfilter.samba.org/
I can log all traffic via iptables on my gateway. In SuSEFirewall2 this is very
easy to set up. Maybe whatever you are using has the same capabilities via its
configuration file. 

There are other packet loggers. These are only the ones I have personally used.


Thank you
Russell

Hi Kyle,

A week or so ago Frye's was advertising an Epson 1250 for <$100, IIRC.
However, according to this page, 

    http://www.khk.net/sane

the 1250 is not supported by the SANE Epson backend.  This printer does
apparently work somewhat with the Plustek and HP Scanjet 2200c backends.   

Good luck,

Marc

See where the kernel is on /dev/hda3?

Older versions of LILO had problems loading the kernel past cylinder
1024. 
This tells me that this is probably a dual-boot machine. 

Try installing LILO to a boot floppy and see what happens like this:

Wondering if any has had this problem or can guess how I can fix it.

I was trying to upgrade Evolution (and Ximian in general) today, but it
failed saying:

Unmet dependency: libgtkhtml.so.9

Which may be all fine and good, but libgtkhtml.so.9 exists on my system
and is in /usr/lib where you would expect it.  Is there a path someplace
I should check or what?

Hello all,

I'm looking for the key directories to backup on a system.  I have the
following that I backed up.

Are there any that I MUST HAVE as an all important back?
Or others that maybe I should.

Mostly just for system backup.  Not many users actually keep things on the
machine.

/etc           Can't go anywhere w/o this.
/var/log       Just b/c I wanted the logs
/home/*        Some here. not all.
/root          I store some things here (rpms and such)
/boot          figured good to have


If I missed anything please let me know.  I think I'll be upgrading my
server this weekend and would like to know I had my ducks lined up before
I knock them all down.

Thanks.

Josh

The applications list I looked at, which was for the server version, I
think, contained demos of a lot of proprietary apps, which were time or
use limited.  I looked at the sites for a number of them, and they had
basically the same downloadable demos.

But, as I recall, it was only available to their silver and gold

Normally, I would say look at /etc/ld.so.conf and make sure /usr/lib is 
listed, but I'm guessing it doesn't need to be since it's such a common 
location.

So, perhaps you've recently added this library, but the system doesn't know 
it yet.  Run `ldconfig` as root.  This will rescan common lib locations and 
those listed in ld.so.conf and will update /etc/ld.so.cache

Depends where you've put stuff.  I use /usr/local a lot as do many 
packages.  According to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard 
http://www.pathname.com/fhs/
that dir should be off-limits for new installation routines, but you never 
can tell, until it's to late, that is.

I saw that, too.  That's the right price, but I'd prefer better support 
than "somewhat".

Maybe I just need to hit the bins for something older.  The type of

Message-ID: <3CE36046.1000908@zaramyth.net>

OK, I'll admit I'm not an expert on VPN.  I have convinced two of the 
AIX system administrators to run Linux on company laptops.  They asked 
me if I knew how to VPN into the company network from Linux.  I said I 
would ask the PLUG list.

Has anyone been able to VPN from a Linux box into a Window$ network?  I 
can do it from home using my Win2k partition on my laptop using a modem. 
 I can not do it using Win2k and DSL through my Linux firewall server 
even though I have the port open.  I thought it was just me until I had 
the AIX guy tell me he was having problems as well.  He said that M$ 
uses a different protocal for VPN.

Anyway if there is a Howto around or personal experience let me know.

I don't think that you can say "all" cg animation for movies is done on
Linux, but certainly a growing (and large) part of it...

The first movie to be almost 100% linux (rendering farms and artist
workstations) is "Stallion: Spirit of the Cimarron" from DreamWorks. (HP
helped get a lot of workstation software for Linux, but they couldn't
convince Adobe to port Photoshop, so some of that work was done on Macs
- still, not M$.).
http://news.com.com/2100-1001-825967.html?tag=cd_mh

If people haven't heard of "Stallion", surely they've heard of The
Muppets! ;)
http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104-895203.html

And this is probably just the tip of the iceberg.

I just got my Micritek SlimScan C6 working.

$25 dollars at a junk table.

The USB was a little weird to setup.

http://www.mostang.com/sane/sane-backends.html


You need to make sure to load the usb, drivers , then mount the file 
system.

1st.  Make the device. 	MAKEDEV sg0 sga

2nd load the modules. 	Here are the modules that I needed to load. 
	scsi_mod              108608   2  [sg microtek]
	usbcore                73216   1  [ipaq usbserial scanner usb-uhci 
microtek]
	usb-uhci               24452   0  (unused)
	microtek                7032   0

3rd  load the usb file system

  	I added this to the /etc/fstab
	none                    /proc/bus/usb           usbdevfs 
defaults       0 0

4th         then one should run the cmd sane-find-scanner.


5th xsane should work as root.

6th add your self to the scanner group & chown the scanner to the same 
group.

Actually, I uninstalled the rpm associated with it, and it all went

  What about Hollerith cards? We all spent many happy hours putting a deck

Don't go knocking cards. I've still got a card reader if you still

Alex;

Yesterday I wrote that putting LILO to a floppy would be a good idea. I
thought about it more since then.

That isn't going to work.

Today I worked on it a little more. I found this:


    This is a warning about possible trouble.  Your BIOS is returning
    inconsistent
    information about the disk geometry:  Cylinders:Heads:Sectors for
    drive 0x80.
    
    If you are using "lba32" addressing (default in LILO version 22),
    you have
    nothing to worry about.  The fact that int 0x13, function 0x48 is
    supported
    means that your BIOS supports the extended disk calls required to
    support
    direct 32-bit addressing of sectors.  Hence, the boot loader never
    has to
    worry about translating disk addresses to C:H:S, with the
    consequential 1024
    cylinder limit.
    
    This disk likely will not boot if you use "geometric" or "linear"
    addressing.
    If you system boots okay, leave things alone, and live with the
    Warning.

Subject: [PLUG] Drum machines
Message-ID: <51AE6EA505FCD111AB5600805F653ACB010AA11F@EXCHANGE>

First, here's where to find lots of linux sound apps:
http://www.bright.net/~dlphilp/linuxsound/


I've tried every one (drum machine) I could get my hands on and ended up
liking only one.  It has some issues, but is definitely usable.  (But my
needs may differ from yours, so don't take that as gospel or anything.)


The one I ended up using is called Trommler.  Get it here:
http://muth.org/Robert/Trommler/ 

It's a sample-based machine, so if you don't have any already there are some
good freebies here: http://hem.passagen.se/lej97/kalava/index.html .  It
does come with a basic set, so you don't have to grab more unless you need
to though.

Another sample set I use sometimes is here:
http://www.airwindows.com/studio/index.html



Someone else just mentioned it, but didn't know if it was good. So...

Here's my best shot at a review:

Trommler isn't majorly advanced (no tempo changes, limited ability to do
time/sig change) but it is fairly easy to knock something out with.  Basic
interface... sounds are in rows and beats are in columns.  Patterns are
(sortof) numbered sheets.  (Up to 64 patterns per song, I think.)  You set
up a song by punching in all of your patterns, and organizing the patterns
(by number) across the bottom of the screen.  Pretty standard layout for the
most part.

There's a couple very interesting (and useful) things about Trommler:

1.  The data format a song is stored in is plain text, and simple enough to
understand that after setting up the patterns you could just use a text
editor to lay everything out.  Very quickly.  (And even change a beat or two
in the patterns.  It's very clean.) 

2.  Another guy has written some tools that work with Trommler song files.
One converts midi songs to Trommler files.
http://www.geocities.com/eric_brunel/midi2trommler.en.html

3.  The other is a converter that reads a Trommler song file, lets you set
stereo position/room size/reverb level for each sound, and translates the
whole thing into a VSpace script.  (VSpace is a language/processor that
takes sounds and plays them back in a virtual accoustic space.)  Then you
run the script and get a really nice sounding wav file of the whole song.
  http://www.geocities.com/eric_brunel/TromVSpacer.en.html
Note:  On this website the author states that it doesn't work with the newer
versions of Trommler... that isn't exactly true.  It works on version 1 song
files, but not newer ones.  But it's extremely easy to remove the part that
makes it choke by hand in the text file.  I told him, but he's on a new
project now, and some of the features in the newer Trommler have removed his
itch.  Not mine... it still sounds better after running through VSpace.  If
you know Python and agree, he'd probably let you adopt it as the new
maintainer. :)


Back to Trommler... and a few things that suck about it:

1.  It can be a little sluggish.
2.  Playback can skip a beat here and there.  (Probably related to 1)
3.  Uses raw samples, so you have to convert wavs.  (Which is how most
samples seem to be distributed.  Instructions and script for converting is
provided.)
4.  Last time I checked exporting to a soundfile sucked.  But that's OK
because I always used VSpace to render files anyway.
5.  If using VSpace, it is fairly intensive.  Can take an hour (maybe more)
to render a wav file.  Of course that is on my old K6-2 350, so base your
estimate on that. :)
6.  16 bit 44.1KHz only.  But the majority of linux (and windows) sound apps
have that same limitation.  Good enough for most, but not considered current
professional level processing if that's what you're after.  (Though probably
still fine... don't process or bounce it around too and you should be OK.)



Now, there's onother option: Midi.  Compose on the computer and pipe it out
to a real drum machine or sound module.  Jazz is supposed to be a pretty
decent Midi sequencer.  http://www.jazzware.com/cgi-bin/Zope.cgi/jazzware/
I don't remember if it has a good rhythm editor section, though.

Not to mention you could still render a decent sounding wav file by using
midi2trommler AND trom2vspace.



Right now, I'm using a freeware Windows midi editor with a nice rhythm part
editor (http://www.anvilstudio.com/) for knocking out drum parts.  It works
pretty good.

OK, OK.  Why on earth am I using it and windows when I was working perfectly
fine under linux?  Mainly because I never found a good multitrack recorder
that I could figure out how to use well on linux.  Many were easy to use,
but sucked.  The ones that looked promising usually left me stumped.
(Ecasound, etc.)  SLab came close, I'm going to give it another go soon.
And see what has popped up since I quit.  What I'm really waiting for is
Ardour... that is going to totally rock and blow away even my windows stuff.
But till then...

Oh, FWIW, that machine is dual-boot w/Debian.  And all of the other machines
in the house are Debian too, so no knocking my single windows use!  :)



Dirk, if you want to hear samples of drum parts put together that way
(Trommer + samples from Kalava + rendered through VSpace) I can dig some up
and get them your way.  I think I also have some that didn't go through
VSpace, and at least one that was done in Midi.  (Didn't use Jazz, but Jazz
could still do it I think.)  Probably off list would be best.



And after all of that verbage on drum machines, I still think NOTHING can
ever replace a real drummer!  But even if you do have one, drum machines and
Midi (drums only for me) are pretty handy for composing/layout of tunes and
having something practice along with that won't bug the neighbors.

Check out my backup write-up here:

http://coopnkass.com/back/index.html

While it doesn't answer the question of exactly *what* to backup, it
does provide a good short overview of Linux/Unix backups. Pay special
attention to the section about the "hostdump" script. It's a pretty
slick script that I got from O'Reilly's "Unix Backup & Recovery" Gator
book.

Here's the documentation:

Hope this helps!

I created an rpm of the hostdump script.  It contains a few minor patches

Subject: [PLUG] postfix/procmail problem
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205161116090.3198-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  This morning I decided to test the new mail list I set up by sending a
message to the eight of us who are subscribed so far. This is what
/var/log/maillog shows about the transactions:

May 16 06:35:23 salmo postfix/local[2783]: D298A77B0: 
to=<genesis at appl-ecosys.com>, relay=local, delay=1, status=sent ("|/usr/local/majordomo/wrapper resend -l genesis genesis-list")
May 16 06:35:23 salmo postfix/cleanup[2782]: EB92377AD:
message-id=<Pine.LNX.4.44.0205160632360.2730-100000 at salmo.appl-ecosys.com>
May 16 06:35:23 salmo postfix/qmgr[2702]: EB92377AD:
from=<owner-genesis at appl-ecosys.com>, size=1395, nrcpt=8 (queue active)
May 16 06:35:24 salmo postfix/local[2783]: CE20977B3:
to=<genesis-list at appl-ecosys.com>, relay=local, delay=1, status=sent (forwarded as EB92377AD)
May 16 06:35:24 salmo postfix/local[2783]: EB92377AD:
to=<pamela at appl-ecosys.com>, relay=local, delay=1, status=sent ("|/usr/bin/procmail")
May 16 06:35:24 salmo postfix/local[2794]: EB92377AD:
to=<rshepard at appl-ecosys.com>, relay=local, delay=1, status=sent ("|/usr/bin/procmail")

 Majordomo received the message and passed it on. The last two couplets show
that the message was forwarded to the two of us here. Pamela received her
copy, I did not receive mine.

  According to /var/log/procmail, it never got here:

>From owner-genesis at appl-ecosys.com  Thu May 16 06:35:24 2002
 Subject: genesis Yes, the list is alive, but sleeping
  Folder: /var/spool/mail/pamela                                     1501

  There was no equivalent entry for my copy. Can someone suggest how I go
about debugging this problem? I also see entries in /var/log/maillog that
suggest to me that messages are being rejected when they should be accepted.
No detailed explanation is offered so I'm not sure what's going on. But, I'd
certainly like to get this all straightened out right away so I can stop
futzing with it.

Thanks,

Rich

Yes, though I'm running Gentoo Linux and believe in building from source
whenever possible ;-) I think I'll resort to downloading a binary and
save time.

I did trace the problem to another script that configure calls called
mkMake, in case anyone wants to search further....

  Can I please get some off-list help from someone who knows postfix and
procmail well? Messages to me from three maillists (sylpheed, openoffice and
my own) are shown as delivered in /var/log/maillog, but they never show up
in my inbox.

  I've no idea where to begin tracking down the source of the problem.

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20020516115608.01f55008@localhost>

Something weird on my box. When I do a hard or soft boot, the system comes 
up in single user mode. I checked /etc/inittab, and have the following line 
in it:

is:3:initdefault:

So, it should be booting to runlevel 3.

If I type "init 3" at the single user mode prompt, it switches to runlevel 
3, and things proceed normally.

I've looked in the logfiles, and don't see anything out of the ordinary.

What else can cause the system to only boot to single user mode?

Thanks in advance!

On my machine it is:
    
    id:3:initdefault:

i.e. 'd' instead of 's' for the runlevel id.

I'd grep recursively through /etc looking for references to init or 
telinit. If you've got GNU grep, it'd be

  egrep -sr '/(tel)?init ' /etc/*

My hunch is that some startup script is doing 'init s' or something 
similar.

My home email server has been getting hammered with so many spam emails lately... Is there something that helps check the emails before they make it through to the email account?

I've looked but havent come across anything that appears to be easy enough to set up and maintain. 

any help or advice would be great. :-)

Robby,

  You can use the same 'access.db' as is used by sendmail. In there you can
put IP addresses and domain names. The access file is built with your
favorite text editor then translated to a binary format with:
	/usr/sbin/postmap hash:/etc/postfix/access
when you're done, reload postfix:
	/usr/sbin/postfix reload
and you'll be on your way.

  Another trick I learned yesterday from Ed is to use the
smtpd_recipient_restrictions in /etc/postfix/main.cf. Mine now looks like
this:

smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
        check_client_access hash:/etc/postfix/badip,
        check_client_access hash:/etc/postfix/badaddr,
        permit_mynetworks,
        check_relay_domains

  The 'badip' and 'badaddr' files contain IP addresses and domain names,
respectively. They, too, are converted to binary with the postmap command.

HTH,

Rich

I thought of that, so I checked inittab on a Tru64 machine that's working. 
It has exactly the same line in there that I quoted below.

Must be a difference between Tru64 and Linux...

Thanks!

Hmm, the egrep on these systems doesn't do -r... I can't put gnu stuff on 
there, because it's a test system, and we need lowest common denominator...

I'm thinking the same thing, but an egrep with no -r didn't say 
anything  at all.

Did the system crash recently?  If it did and was unable to save the dump
file it will only boot to single-user mode.  Type:

# rcmgr set SAVECORE_FLAGS M

and that should allow it to boot normally.  I don't remember if rcmgr is in
$PATH, so if it's not do a find.

Please turn off html.

Thanks.

Take a look at my messages from last week. I put a script in here that 
downloads a list of known spammers, and updates the access file to reject 
them.

I had postfix set to reject mail servers that didn't reverse resolve, but I 
found I was losing too much legitimate email by doing that.

You can also add black hole relay checks.

In your /etc/postfix/main.cf, you add the following:

smtpd_client_restrictions = hash:/etc/postfix/access,reject_maps_rbl
smtpd_sender_restrictions = reject_maps_rbl
maps_rbl_reject_code = 554
maps_rbl_domains = 
west1.mail-abuse.org,ns1-relays.osirusoft.com,relays.ordb.org

I now use, balsa + procmail.

here is the scripts that I use.

The procmailrc is setup for plug,

Add this to the end of the procmailrc file
:0
  * ^Subject:.*Flame
        /dev/null

Or this
:0
  * ^From:.*spamer
        /dev/null


Or you could use evolution, which is more WYSIWYG. As far as flitering, 
calendering etc.

Not surprising, since it didn't recurse. Try...

    cd /etc
    find . -type f -print | xargs grep -E '/(tel)?init '

I use iptraf on my lrp boxes, it pairs up the NAT portion of the
connection with the internet portion of the connection, and it is text
based, so it fits on the one floppy with the rest of the router.

Good Luck

Has anyone tried upgrading to Ximian Redhat 7.3 over an existing 7.2 system?  I'm afraid of it completely frazzing my system, and would rather not do a super extensive back-up of my hard-disk data.

Has anyone tried postfix + spamassassin?  I've got spamassassin
installed, but haven't yet tackled editing the master.cf file to tell
Postfix about it.

I just upgraded yesterday and I have rh7.2.  I don't know if the upgrade
is the same for 7.3 and 7.2.  How would I know for sure?

Everything seems to work fine.

you'd still want to upgrade from Redhat 7.2 to 7.3 like normal (with a CD), then when you enter links -sourcehttp:go-gnome.com/| the appropriate Ximian should install (or allow you to specify).

I found that and just tried the rest of what I hadn't done already.
Note that I'm not doing the Anomy Sanitizer, and found another
filter.sh script with spamassassin only.

When I ran postfix reload and send myself an email, I get this in my
logs:

May 16 14:29:26 saaz postfix/qmgr[21506]: 7B0E51A1DF: from=<rhudson at NoOrScPaAsMinc.com>, size=806, nrcpt=1 (queue active)

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Rob

I landed at Rentrak after HyperLINq/Avalon closed its doors. There is
lots of Linux here. There's Apache on Linux, Oracle on Linux, desktops
on Linux, firewalls on Linux and FTP servers on Linux.

One of the cool things about coming here was that they didn't even blink
when I said I'd need a Linux workstation.

Did the system crash recently?  If it did and was unable to save the dump
file it will only boot to single-user mode.  Type:

# rcmgr set SAVECORE_FLAGS M

and that should allow it to boot normally.  I don't remember if rcmgr is in
$PATH, so if it's not do a find.

BUGGY !!!!!

SAY AT 7.2.

stock redhat 7.3  stuff all works, but evolution.

Shipped by redhat does not work for me.

I tried the updated  package , for evolution no joy :( 
Ximian Redhat 7.3, does not work right.

They are trying to use the same rpm for 7.0,1,2,3.

It does not work right.

The installer died so I did the install by hand.

I think I shot my self in the foot.

I resolved one problem -- the transport unavailable problem... typo in
my master.cf file.

Now, when a mail comes in, it relays to the filter like it should.
I've got the filter directory like the webpage mentions.  I
temporarily commented out the deletion of the in and out files for
testing.

When I run the shell script from the command line, it works good.
However, when I turn on the filtering in postfix and send a test
message, the message shows up as being from "Postfix Filter" (the
user) and has an empty body and empty subject.

When I look at the /var/spool/filter directory, the in.xxx file is
fine, but the matching out.xxx file is empty.  But my tests from the
command line are OK.

If you want to see if that's due to the string not being there, or being
there and not being found, replace the string with one you know exists.

  Could be one of two things either your boot flags are set to S for single
  user mode, or your default run level in /etc/inittab is set to s.
  If hitting Ctrl-D works then I would guess that it is the console boot flags.

I'm not familiar with Tru64, so I can't tell you where the boot
flags are set. But it's something to check.

I guess my mileage is varying, then.  

Just finished a Ximian install over the top of a fresh (but completely
updated) RH 7.3.  Evolution's always the first app I check out once I've
got gpilotd talking to my Visor, and I can't complain about any of it so
far.  Is there something I should be looking for?

My one kvetch is the inevitable Ximian vs. Red Hat's errata: Ximian
wants its slightly older build of Mozilla (0.99-3) while RH has just
released a patched Mozilla (0.99-12).  No big deal either way with the
exception of scuffling over assorted secondary package dependencies
(like Galeon). That's a problem the two have traditionally had, though,
and doesn't recommend much against an upgrade of both if you're so
inclined anyhow.

Ximian has also not released a StarOffice or experimental channel for RH
7.3, so if you really like SO5.2 as packaged by Ximian or enjoyed the
new GNOME control center and assorted themes they introduced and can't
imagine installing them yourself, it's still one to avoid.

What is broken with Evolution in 7.3?  I'm using it right now.  It's a
little buggy, but pretty stable.

According to the Borland Web site, the only Linux
releases certified to work with JB6 are Red Hat 6.2
and 7.1. I've installed it on Caldera 3.1.1 and
haven't had any trouble with it, although I haven't
yet used it much. Anyhow, perhaps Linux users with
other distributions than those recommended by Borland
would do well to attempt to install it, since
apparently it might work.

To reply to my own problem, I figured out that the spamassassin binary
was trying to create a directory "/.spamassassin".  Maybe this
happened b/c I added the user with no home directory.

I found the above out by su-ing to the user, and executing the shell
script.  I ended changing line 151 of spamassassin (v 2.20) and adding
the line (configuration option):     
  'dont_copy_prefs' => 1,

Now things are looking good.

This got me going in the right direction.

What I found was the boot_osflags in SRM was blank. I set it to "A" and 
Tru64 now boots to multi-user, GUI mode.

Major pain in the butt, and just *SO* intuitive. :)

I was a Dumb user. 

I had gnome2 rpms pre-rawhide from redhat that were causing all sorts of
issues when I upgraded. 

Only evolution was effected. 

I am back to evolution bliss. 

I am sorry if I confused anyone. 

I was very confused my self. 

It was weird that every thing work in 7.2, but evolution died in 7.3. 



The lesson is be ware that rpms installed 5 months ago can bite back.  

At upgraded time.

Yes, it serves a purpose.  Should the disk ever become corrupted,
and the fsck(8) utility find allocated, but unconnected, data blocks,
it will re-connect them to the directory tree by created directory
entries in "/lost+found".  (It's analogous to the Microsoft DOS
tools which litter C:\ with FILEnnnn.CHK files -- just a bit tidier,
is all.)

Subject: [PLUG] system call in php
Message-ID: <3CE46F0F.44A45716@attbi.com>

I have the following line in a php file:

system("/usr/bin/mpg123 $fileList &");

$fileList is the name of the selected option in a select box that lists
all the .mp3 files in a particular directory.

This does what I expect it to do, mostly. The php file is on the Linux
machine in my office. The output of that machine's sound card is
connected to the stereo in the living room. Using a laptop in the living
room, I connect to the php file on the machine in the office and
successfully start music file playing with mpg123. That's the part works
the way I expect it to.

With the "&" after the "mpg123 $fileList" I expect the php file to
complete loading. It doesn't. I thought that the "&" was the thing to
use to have a process start up "in the background" and let you continue
doing other things. This does work if I run mpg123 from the command
line. Is there something I should be doing differently with php to get
the same effect?

Also, is there a way for php to receive information about what the pid
is for the process it just caused to be launched? I'd like to build in a
way to stop the music other than logging in, su'ing, running ps -ax, and
then killing the process.

Thanks in advance.

Look at the difference between:
http://www.php.net/system
http://www.php.net/exec

I think exec doesn't wait for a response unless you pass it an array,
but you still need to redirect output to a file (/dev/null?) so PHP
knows it's not supposed to wait.  The '&' is good in that it kicks up a
child process.

Try instead:

system("sh -c \"/usr/bin/mpg123 $fileList &\"") ;

The background '&' is a shell operation and the PHP system call might or
might not exec a shell.

I downloaded Valhalla from limestone.uoregon.edu, and
sustained the highest possible transfer rate the
entire time, even during business hours. I live in
Portland, so this may partly explain it. 

I think it's reprehensible that Red Hat does not
provide the locations of mirror sites on its homepage.

I have a computer with both Linux and Windows
installed, using GRUB as the boot loader. Now I'd like
to install Red Hat along with the others. I would
prefer to use the GRUB boot loader now installed to
boot any of the three, adding the Red Hat installation
to the present boot menu. 

Red Hat allows one to install a boot loader or not. If
it is installed, it can go into the MBR or the first
sector of the root partition. I know that it shouldn't
be installed into the MBR, but should it be installed
on the first sector of the root partition instead of
not at all? I think so, but is this a correct belief?
(I always have a boot disk handy, in case I am
mistaken about such things.)

There are some problems with the JRE and glibc you'll have to contend 
with. I've included the SuSE Oracle install URLs below. These 
instructions helped me get Oracle installed last year on my SuSE 7.1 
system. Since I installed Oracle I've upgraded my system to SuSE 7.2 
and now to 8.0 and my Oracle installation still appears functional. 

The JRE issue is noted in the common issues link for Oracle 8:

http://www.suse.com/en/support/oracle/db/81x_common.html

Here's the main Oracle 8.1.7 link from SuSE's website:

Good Luck,

Hmm. I know Adobe was developing a port of Photoshop for Linux that they
put on hold. I wonder if they will reconsider now that Linux is becoming so
well established in that niche.

(And I've heard of that movie -- you can't avoid the trailers for it on

Definitely.

I just saw a series on the web today (courtesy of LinuxToday) about Linux's
growing use in industry by a rabidly pro-Free Software group called
``Business Week":

http://www.businessweek.com/technology/tc_special/linux.htm

Provides a lot of meat to my earlier article -- which was admittedly based
on my gut feelings.

Thanks for the links!  I had not yet found that first one.

Currently, the Oracle installer, supposedly installs the JRE it wants from 
its own CD, and I decided to avoid confusion by not installing -any- JRE 
beforehand.  Thus, I'm presuming that mine is not the common JRE problem. 
 It sounds, though, like I probably -would- have the glibc 2.2 problem also 
referred to in the common issues link you provided, so I'll try the fix for 
that, and see what happens.

Thanks again for the pointer.

Well, I have never done three OS's, but I have done dual boots, and the MBR 
always works fine for me, and Grub lists both OS's automagically, while with 
LILO I used to have to add Windows by editing (that may have changed with the 
newer LILO).  I always thought adding the boot sector was only necessary when 
the OS was beyond the 1025 cyl limit, which I don't think is an issue with 
newer hardware and OS's.

SETI at home?

NRST/SST (part of Merlo Station High School in Beaverton) has a mosix
cluster up too and was working on putting SETI at home on it.  

You could have a riverdale seti team, or if you don't want to bother
with the hassle of setting up a team, you could always join the NRST
team. ;)  http://sharky.dyndns.org/nrst/

Oh if your school uses Blender (www.blender.nl is the site, but they are
down now - you can still "apt-get install blender" on Debian though) you
can make a "render server" just like they use in hollywood.  However,
the Blender renderer is meant for networks of workstations, not mosix
(its called "renderd" I think?).

I don't think you should need a boot loader.  However, you will probably
have to boot into the your current version of Linux installed and edit
your /etc/grub.conf (unless the RedHat install lets you tweak the
existing /etc/grub.conf) to add the new RedHat option. 

Actually, in the past i've installed the RedHat grub boot loader in the
MBR and had the options "Redhat", "Win2k" and "Debian", and the debian
listing would point to a certain partition (where Debian was installed)
which would then have lilo on it, so that I could choose between kernel
versions in Debian. 

Sorry I'm not more familiar w/ Grub... hope this helps... ;)

Attention MetroWest.pm Members --- Manning Publications announces the
release of:

Web Development with Apache and Perl
By Theo Petersen

To learn more about this book and find out how to get a free copy for your
group, please read ...

Greenwich, Connecticut, May 2002 -- Web Development with Apache and Perl
teaches web developers how to easily build a site with features like message
forums, chat, session management, custom preferences and other features.
More than a programming book, it covers a wide spectrum of practical issues
and how to handle them such as when to use a database, what information
needs to be secure (and how to secure it), and how to keep traffic from
crippling a website. It teaches the empowering use of ready-made modules so
developers do not have to reinvent the wheel. It even teaches how to
successfully advocate the use of Open Source tools in the corporate
environment.

What's Inside Web Development with Apache and Perl
* CGI and mod_perl programming
* mod_ssl, mod_rewrite and other Apache modules
* Using DBI with databases
* HTML::Mason and Template Toolkit for embedded scripting
* User login and session management
* Performance and system monitoring tools
* Growth planning and disaster recovery
* Sample layouts for community, corporate and e-commerce sites.

About the Author
A web developer committed to Open Source tools, Theo Petersen has spent many
years collecting experiences from other developers and evaluating web
development languages, add-ons and techniques to create a best-of-breed
toolkit for web applications. This book is the result. Theo lives in Denver,
Colorado.

Didn't make any difference.

exec worked the same way as system. However, while reading the info at
php.net I came across this note.

  Note: If you start a program using this function and want to leave it
  running in the background, you have to make sure that the output of
  that program is redirected to a file or some other output stream or
  else PHP will hang until the execution of the program ends. 

I included redirection in my system call and got what I was looking for. 

system("/usr/bin/mpg123 1>outputfile 2>errorfile $fileList &");

Thanks for the suggestion of where to look.

Heck, I get it pinging the local machine.  It's a bug in iputils, I
think, but I never quite found out what.  It seems to be fixed in 7.3.

This is not unusual.  When a vendor says that their product works on
certain distributions, it usually means that they are only willing to
support their product on those distributions--if you use another, you
may or may not have any problems, but you're your own.  This is
understandable given the cost of supporting proprietary software.

You are feeling the pain of oracle, I have been playing with oracle
since 7*, 8.0.5 ,9I today. 

You should never try to make oracle think it is on a platform that it
not designed for. 

Why is there this much pain ??

Well oracle on linux 8.0.5 - 9i makes undocumented libc calls, the
undocumented libc calls can change when the libc guys want to try some
thing new. 

You want the pain to do oracle tricks, on your new distro. 

ASK YOUR SELF WHY ???

ARE YOU GLUTTON FOR PUNISHMENT ??

THIS IS NOT PRODUCTION , RIGHT ?? 

Plan A. 
	You need to do the chroot /mnt/oldsystem. 
	Have a fullly installed old setup. 
        Aka a new / . 

        When I need to build/debug C oracle front end I end up doing
	chroot. 

Plan B. 
	Or seting up vmware.

Not only support, but it's probably only been tested on that distribution 
as well.

While we like to think that all Linux distributions will run anything 
compiled for "Linux", that's not always the case, what with many variations 
of libraries, CPUs, etc.

Each distribution requires a testing effort to ensure proper functionality 
and graceful exiting on errors. In other words, each distribution *SHOULD* 
have the same suite of tests run on it as OSes as different as Redhat 7.2 
and Solaris 7.0. Otherwise, the vendor may be opening themselves up to 
major cost overruns in support and services.

This can be argued away with open source arguments, but I'm not interested 
in that. Many businesses (evil and not) choose to NOT release their 
software source code, as is their right. You have the right to use the 
software or not.

Rich,

This begs the question, "where is $DEFAULT getting whacked?" The, er,
default value for $DEFAULT is $ORGMAIL, which has a default value of
/var/spool/mail/$LOGNAME.

Sandy,

  In ~/.procmailrc. I must have done something to that file in the middle of
February because it read:

#diagnostic:
DEFAULT=default

  I never saw that. So, it happily created a file called mail/default and
has put 2500+ messages there since then. No wonder I didn't get mail I
expected from individuals and mail lists!

  Sheesh! That's what I get for not looking carefully at sample files I use.
Now, of course, DEFAULT=/var/spool/mail/rshepard and all's well.

Hello Linux folkz,
I need your advise on SQL DB layout.
What is better in terms of performance and speed to install database
on a single RAID0-1 array or split data directories between separate
single hard drives?
Thank you in advance for any ideas or recommendations.

INCOMING!!!!! FLAME WAR ALERT!!!!!

Well, <standard reply>it depends.</standard reply>

If your data base is write intensive, it's best spread across as many
spindles as you can get. If it's read intensive, get lots of RAM and speedy
spindles.

<bill's personal preference>
I like mirrors. You can just pause the db, break the mirror, do your stuff
and bring it back up and let it sync. Lots of things you can do with
mirrors, and best of all, your butt's still pretty well covered.

RAID 1 might be good, but if it is at all possible, you should try a RAID 5 
(If you have at least a third disk).  RAID 0 has no real fault tolerance.  
Which database is this for? can you use some sort of LVM? or will you be 
using segments? ALSO...You are putting your logs on separate disk devices, 
right?

Alot of the decision making for this is also decided upon by what the 
database's main use is going to be.  OLTP? Generic Data Storage?

With small Sybase installs, a long chain of single disks is very fast, with 
the backup server using DIFFERENT disk devices....for pete's sake..

what kind of uptime/IO/other requirements does this proposed database need?

Hello Brian,
Thanks for your response.
This MySQL with InnoDB tables database is intended for collecting real
time test/process data from the running equipment log files and
providing raw data for data analysis software to display results over
the FCGI web interface. Web server, data analysis software and
database should be residing on the same box to reduce network traffic.

We have two el'cheapo SideBus soft Raid0 EIDE controllers and four
ATA100 EIDE 40GB hard drives. Sorry we can't afford SCSI. Budget is
tight.

There are two possible solutions: 
We can set up two Raid0 arrays and mirror one another simultaneously
or syncronizing them once a day.
Or we can just leave these hard drives where they are and spread data
directories across all four of them.

My major question is which method is better for best performance and
what FS (EXT2, EXT3, ReiserFS, JFS) is better to use for this task.

Thank you in advance for any thoughts or sources of information.
Alex

Another thing to consider is your table layout:

1) How normalized will your data structure be?
2) Can you avoid 15-table joins for a general SELECT statement?

There are alot of things in addition to disk placement that can utilize or 
inhibit a database's response...

Interesting. It seems to me that instead of depending upon (as you said) 'el 
cheapo' RAID Controllers you may want to go with using the disks themselves...
(a box is only as strong as the weakest joint)  If you are to do this, I 
would definitely recommend using EXT3, I have never used ReiserFS knowingly 
but I have become a definite believer in EXT3's Journaling stuff...

>From the InnoDB documentation, its good to see that MySQL is using 
transactions, and has better dump capabilities and recoverability.  This with 
the goodies from EXT3 will definitely be a help.

With a small RAID0 array, I don't think you'll get the performance 
improvement/reliability you're looking for.

As far as backups, logs, etc...Depending on what kind of space you need for 
pertinent data, you might want to consider the following:

scenario #1::
first 2 disks: database devices MIRRORED (active/online/whatever you want to 
call them)
third disk: DB dump archive disk (cron-jobbie-job dump and possibly gzip)
fourth disk: add'l db disk for testing/recovering dumps....

scenario #2::
[if data is super-important -- kinda wasteful]
software raid 5 (you need 3 of the disks -- fourth for dumps, etc)

un-scenario #3::
Have you considered Sybase?
(not trying to start a flame war, but I'm personally a Sybase junkie...and it 
works VERY well on linux.

Also, if response time via a web server is an issue, rather than FCGI, (which 
I have seen get sick many times onder a heavy load) have you considered PHP?
similar to perl, no additional process creation, and it's buzzword 
compliant....syntax is also similar to perl in some regards.

Another reason to try to pimp sybase out is the creation of functions that 
are stored in the database....without needing to write C/C++ code -- you can 
use standard SQL-T/SQL (similar with PostgreSQL, but without the T/SQL 
stuff....)

Sybase 11.9.2 is free for linux for use in development systems...I can send 
or point you to the RPMs...

The creation of PROCS (stored procedures) is a great thing because the query 
is already compiled. 

I apologize if I am attempting to steer you away from your original plan...

Thanks for the advise.  I'll look into all the files and try the hostdump
script program.  I have a better idea of other directories and that will
help me get started.

Brian,

We already have our modules written in Perl which resemble subselects,
triggers, stored functions and other features MySQL doesn't have. 
At least for for now.

I assume that Sybase is free to use in development systems, but what
about using it in commercial applications? How much It'll cost and
what is its lisence schema? 
We just don't want to have additional head aches with commercial EULA
and other greedy needy stuff.

By the way, you've mentioned that Perl FCGI is dieing under a heavy
load. Did you mention FCG not FCGI? CGI is prone to consume a lot of
system resources because Perl script must be interpreted, compiled and
executed upon every user request.  
In case with FCGI the script is interpreted, compiled and executed
only once. After this it runs persistently servicing multiple users
requests. If there are too many users for one process, web server
spawns second third and so on process untill bandwidth is saturated.
Generally properly written Perl FCGI script runs faster than PHP.

Alex,

The FCGI that I have seen die was standard Perl/DBI stuff...I'm pretty sure 
alot of it was sloppy coding....

Sybase Licensing is a tricky thing....If this is going to be a commercially 
distributed project, perhaps MySQL would be a bit better (at least less 
costly)  MySQL's licensing (from what I understand) is a bit less in 
price/headache/etc...

Having never used/written for FCGI personally, I guess I put my head on the 
chopping block with that statement.

The issue I was raising as far as stored procs, triggers, etc.  is that in a 
database such as Sybase (for example) the actual query is stored with a query 
plan which is good for non ad hoc queries, in that the SQL doesn't have to be 
compiled and a query plan doesn't have to be generated every time the query 
is executed.  Like by an external entity (Perl) the query plans would be 
freshened whenever an 'update statistics' is run or if a table is modified, 
by dropping and re-creating the proc.  This is, of course unless you are 
using Perl to tie directly into the DB engine....which would be phun....

Brian,

MySQL costs nothing ether you use it for yourself or bind it to
commercial products. It's Open Source and all GPLed.

Perl as a part of database engine. This is exactly what we're using
Perl for. It provides better flexibility and functionality compare to
heavily featured commercial SQL DBs with its own proprietary
programming languages.

Very cool.

It was my understanding that (apparently MySQL changed their licensing) you 
had to license MySQL for commercial purposes.

Finally got a reply from those folks.  The short answer was $2k for
the print rental, which seems a bit steep for the purposes of a
fund-raiser.  That is, unless some deep pocketed underwriter magically
steps forward.  I just sent a reply back explaining the idea for a
FreeGeek fund-raiser.  Maybe they can cut us a special price, or maybe
not.  Will keep the list advised of anything I hear.

MySQL, is not the greatest database. 

It does not pass Mr Dodd ACID Test.

Look into postgres, in some cases it was faster then MySql. 

MySQL has the habbit of not gracefully failing.

EXT3 or XFS. 

I know the Redhat developers they swore by EXT3. but they pay for the
development of ext3. Aka the own dogfood theory. Steven Tweedy of Tweedy
disk farm, works for the hat. but I would look into.

I love ext3 for my home box, I have 2 40G /home. So Fdisk is nice and
fast. 

I used to work for IBM setting up Linux for benchmarking SAP/Oracle. 

We found that we got higher threw-put via software raid, on 4-8 ways
Zeons. And 4 way PPros.

Working at IBM we had all the nice raid cards and they were always
slower. Then software RAID. Buy a nice SMP motherboard, will out
preform, UNI motherboard with the raid controller that money could by.
If the drives remain the same, and the # of channels in the raid array. 

XFS. 

IMHO is the best journaling file system for linux. 

It has been design from the ground up to be a true journaling file
system. 

EXT3 is a hack, to ext2 to add journaling. 

JFS is not the JFS on AIX. 

It is from the source tree of Stale OS/2 JFS. So the development is not
the to the same level as the enterprise level as IBM AIX. 

http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/features.html

2^63 = 9 x 1018 = 9 exabytes.  or 9000 Terabytes I think :) 
That is alot of MP3. 

POSIX Access Control Lists (ACLs)

The Linux XFS filesystem supports the ACL semantics and interfaces
described in the draft POSIX 1003.1e standard.

Maximum File Size

For Linux 2.4, the maximum accessible file offset is 16TB on 4K page
size and 64TB on 16K page size. As Linux moves to 64 bit on block
devices layer, file size limit will increase to 9 million terabytes (or
the system drive limits).



Hardware 

I would buy a new MPX Athlon with a dual 2, load up the ram. 

Buy a few Promise ATA 133 cards. 

For Best performance, no chaining the ide. aka 1 drive per each ide
cable.  

Loadup the ide, there is a new Wester Digital Driver with 2 or 4 megs of
cache. I think. 

Also I would do a nice raid 5. 

The hardware above is what I priced out for myself. 

was around 2,000 for 1/4 Terabyte. 


Also you want to see if the LVM, stuff works now. Aka not buggy.

SGI's XFS rocks!

For a while MySQL was steering towards not being much more than an indexed 
*NIX-like filesystem.

an interesting fact about postgres is that their license is so forgiving, 
both Postgres and RedHat are offering commercial versions of the same 
database.

I'm glad that since Postgres 7.1 they have finally got some realistic dump 
and restore functions.

I saw it.  It wasn't that great.  There are interviews with people like
Torvalds and Stallman, there's coverage of a couple events like Linux
World and the Microsoft refund day, there's lots of coverage of happy
Linux companies making Big Bucks during the DotCom boom, and then it ends
with white letters on a black background showing RedHat's and VA's current
stock price, followed by some bad college band playing Stallman's Free
Software song.

Hi

Total novice here, setting up linux on your basic Athlon box;  problem is that when I "ls" large directories the beginning of the list scrolls off the display.  
"ls -r" still misses some entries in the middle of the list.  Tried "stty rows 24", no fix.  Anything like "more" or "less" that works for directories rather than files?

Probably a stupid question, but can anybody point me in the right direction?  I'm setting up a system from zero, no Xfree86 or GUI yet, just command line, and 
this rows problem is getting to be a pain to work around.

Thanks

Oh, someone more novice than me.  What a rare find. ;)

You can use the pipe symbol (|) (shift - backslash) to send the output of
your ls command to either less or more.  less is nicer than more, because
you can use your arrow keys to scroll back up.  So, the command would look
like this;

ls |less

or, if you want a long listing (shows files details);

ls -l |less

Note: In linux and some UNIX flavors, ll is a shortcut for ls -l.
So, ll |more would give you the same output as ls -l |more.

Hope this helps.
Good luck.

OK, I got through the problem in which those of us using glibc 2.2 must

before getting another error.

My current status is as follows:

The installer window says
	Install Successful
	Linking Oracle 8i Enterprise
	Edition 8.1.7.0.1
	(meter says) 65%

The error window says

Any ideas how to get past this?

ls -alF >/tmp/bob;

pico /tmp/bob 

Pico is for the newbie. 

also mc = Midnight commander . A Norten Clone. 

As I tread lightly on the religious zeal of the Editor wars. 

VI VS Emacs. 

Or you could go down the path of Emacs. 

Where you never have to leave your editor.

Surf the web, read mail, news , all from emacs. 

You can talk to emacs DR program to help you relax.  

It did it own window system before the X-windows. 

The download for emacs is 80~120 Megs I think. 

Think of emacs as the air craft carrier of the editors, with thermo
nuclear weapons on board. 

VI 

Is a product of Joy, bill joy of sun. 

It is a sniper rifle of editors. Small but powerful. 

BOTH CAN SLAY ANY PROBLEM 

If it was me I would do the following .

ls -alF >/tmp/bob; vim /tmp/bob

Since Andrew's suggestion of mc was buried in a longer list, let me 
reiterate it.

Midnight Commander is sort of a file-manager shell program. It lets 
you copy, move, rename, examine, and even ftp files from the command 
line. If you want to peek inside tar files, gzip files, or other file 
sets (.deb, .rpm, etc.), it knows how to do that, too.

Oh, one other suggestion: Try the key combo 'Ctrl + PageUp' after 
you've run ls. Some console terminals will keep a buffer and let you 
scroll back through it.

I had the same thing, and it was the usual "AbiWord's god-awful
knock-off truetype" issue.

You can:

a.) Remove AbiWord if you don't use it

b.) Remove the entry for the AbiWord fonts in /etc/X11/fs/config by
commenting out this line:

/usr/share/AbiSuite/fonts

Which will at least keep them out of your way until you use AbiWord and
it goes ahead and adds them to your path anyhow

c.) Get the real Times New Roman, Arial, and a few others that AbiWord
fakes and put them in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TTF since Red Hat has at
least jimmied the aliases on AbiWord's fonts so they'll be used after
the real ones if it can find them. If you must use AbiWord, this is your
best solution.

Between antiword for catting out the .doc's I get to a text file and
OpenOffice for reading .rtf's and others, AbiWord has found its way off
my machine.  Too bad, since it's a passable WordPad substitute, but the
entire font situation (two years in the making, and stubbornly stuck to
despite consistently being the most voted-on bug) will keep it off my
machines until they get around to introducing proper freetype support.

The bug report itself on this particular issue makes for some
interesting reading:

http://bugzilla.abisource.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1030

I sympathize with the developers, who aren't running Burger King
regardless of the gifts they bring to the table, but the entire debate
feels a little mule-headed nonetheless.

  I found the IANA web site that lists all Class A (CIDR /8) address
assignments. Is there a site that lists IP address block assignments in more
detail?

  Also, is there a way in a MTA access file (or equivalent) to indicate a
range of IP address blocks, other than listing each component individually?
For example, rather than listing 61.72, 61.73, 61.74. 61.75, 61.76, 61.77
each on its own line, can the range be validly listed on a single line?
Would something like 61.72-61.77 work?

Thanks,

Rich

I checked on Oracle's support site, and found a few relevant hits:

- Make sure `make' is in the PATH of the installation environment.  Modify PATH and rerun the installation if it doesn't.

- LD_LIBRARY_PATH should include $ORACLE_HOME/lib .  In your case, /u01/app/oracle/product/8.1.7/lib .

- Check whether the precompilers and samples are installed properly inside $ORACLE_HOME/bin and $ORACLE_HOME/precomp/demo/ .  If they are installed properly you may have recieved these errors due to insufficient temp space and swap space.

- The log file resides in $ORACLE_HOME/install/make.log .

- You can manually relink your precompilers any time by using the makefile, $ORACLE_HOME/precomp/lib/ins_precomp.mk. The make command uses the following convention:

     $ make -f ins_precomp.mk relink EXENAME=executable
     (where executable = proc or procob , profor etc.)


Good luck.

Subject: [PLUG] DLink DSL100 - it's there but can't connect to the 'net
Message-ID: <200205181632.g4IGWvc17189@web06.bigbiz.com>

I installed Linux (Lycoris - easy for the Linux newbie) on my brother and sister-in-laws computer this week. They have a DLink DSL100D internal dsl 'modem'
I got the driver module and instructions from the manufactures web site. 
Before I installed the module, of course it was invisible to the OS. After the module is loaded, it's detected  (MAC address, the whole nine yards).
 My dsl provider and my bro and s-i-l DSL provider is Opusnet (we live in Scappoose). 
Under Windows they connected via PPPoE. From my understanding, that brings up a 'dial up' window, with '1' as the phone number and they connect.
Now, I have the external router, so I surf and go. It  raises the question, is their connection truly a PPPoE connection?
How do I get them to be able to surf? 1/2 the battle was won with the driver module install.
Anybody out there have experience with the DSL100D and/or Opusnet?
I have Roaring Penguin's RP-PPPoE software  (*wonderful* software, IMNSHO) installed for them - I preferred trying to connect them by using the CLI :)
Any pointers, experiences, www links (though I found the info on the DSL100 through my own searching already), would be greatly appreciated.

On a side note, my sister in law loves linux already - she's using it to print her photos (the first thing we did was a short course in The GIMP to crop and print), write letters with KOffice and sync her Palm pilot -everything she did under Windbloze.
My brother is a little more hesitant...he likes his Outlook - but that is what Evolution is for, and has some windows CAD programs he wants to use so he can telecommute (Win4Lin, here we come) - baby steps- he's addicted to the Solitare game already :)

Thanks in advance, 
Greg

Subject: [PLUG] discovering how much tape consumed on a DDS drive with compression?
Message-ID: <86y9eh5rq9.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

For a long time I have wondered how I could know how much remaining
capacity I have on a tape cartridge when the drive has built in
hardware compression.  I've had this question on DDS-2 and DDS-3
drives.  Does any clever person on this here mailing list know the
answer?  

I can do an "mt tell" to get the block number, but I find that is the
block number of the uncompressed data.  E.g., on a DDS-3 (12 gig
native capacity), with blocksize set to 32768 bytes:

  $ tar -b 64 -clf /dev/nst0 . 

  $ mt -f /dev/nst0 tell
  At block 405606.

  $ tar -b 64 -clf - . | wc
  98016073 949999497 13290897408
 
The byte count is consistent with the blocksize and block count, but
it is obviously greater than the native capacity, so we are talking
about the uncompressed figure, whereas I am really interested in the
fraction of the tape left (which would give me a way of estimating the
data holding capacity remaining).  Since the tape mechanism is hidden
inside a box, I can't just look at the reels to get an idea.

Clues?

Are you sure? On all my systems it's shift + PageUP/Down. Works
with all the terminal windows and the text consoles. Of course,
with the terminal windows there's usually a scroll bar...

You're right. Sorry for the error. Shift + PageUp it is. (Shows you

I tried with both Net::Whois and Net::XWhois with poor results.  I got
false negatives on domains I knew we still had and inconsistent
results.  I even put a sleep in after each query, because I seem to
recall the WHOIS servers limiting connections to prevent
spammer-harvesting.  We've got a lot of domains, some of which are no
longer registered to host with us, so I was trying to find an automated
way of verifying them.  So far, 'bwwhois' and some grep/awk filters seem
to work best.

Attached are the two scripts I wrote (to use the respective modules); if
anyone sees anything obviously wrong with them let me know.

For some reason on my system, the color escape codes aren't turned off
when ls is piped to less, so I have to add '-r' to less to make it
interpret the escape codes.  'ls -l|less -r'

That is because one of your startup scripts contains "alias" statements
that create that.  You can read about "alias" in the Bash, Zsh, or Ash
manuals.

alias ll='ls -l '

Look for an "alias" for "ls" that sets it up to use the "--color"
option, and see that it's using "--color=auto" so that it detects
whether or not it's running on a TTY, and if the TERM supports color.

What is the best webmail program to use for stability and compatibility?  Traditionally I tried to use IMP on my Redhat 6.2 box but it generated a lot of errors when accessed by IE or Netscape clients and occasionally didn't work at all.  To some degree Opera is available on most machines on my lan but Opera isn't an option on my Redhat 6.2 pc164 Alpha box.  Is there any way to keep mozilla/netscape from being slow and crash prone?
I am not subscribed to the list right now because the volume is too high for my ISP and I don't have our mail server set up yet ( including necessary spam and duplicate filtering ).  Please send response to robinsom at opusnet.com.

  Yes, I use the whois databases at arin, apnic and ripe. But, that's now
what I asked. Is there a listing somewhere of, for example, all block
assignments with 66.0.0.0? Or, within 208/8?

  Second, when I have a block of addresses I want to add to my postfix
reject list, is there a way to specify the entire block as a range rather
than one per line?

Thanks,

I've been using --color=if-tty, but now that I man ls, I see that the
three listed options are "never", "always", and "auto".

Oddly, "if-tty" still works (assuming it's deprecated) and didn't, last I
checked, work exactly the same as "auto".

My arm hurts.

  Here's an interesting situation for which I'd like some suggestions.

  On my main workstation /dev/ttySO was owned by rshepard.uucp with 600
permissions. I could sync the Palm Pilot and download photos from my digital
camera without problems on that port. Based on a thread on another list, I
realized that this was not the way to have the port set up.

  I added myself to the group "uucp" then changed permissions to 660. Now I
cannot get jpilot talking to that port. I also added myself to the group
"wheel", changed the port's group to that, but find the same results. The
only way it works is when the device is owned by me.

  What am I doing wrong here?

Thanks,

I do seem to remember a database looking critter when installing Star

One thing I've heard mentioned on RedHat's mailling list is something 
called "mondo".  Created by Hugo Rabsom, I think.  Sorry, don't have the 
web site handy.

Cooper,

  I don't know. I forgot to mention that when I changed the permissions and
added myself to the group, uucp, I changed the port ownership back to root.
I also forget how to SUID or SGID on a file.

Thanks,

Rich

  AFAIK, StarOffice still licenses AdabasD. It's not included in OpenOffice.

When you add yourself to a group, you may have to log out
and log in again for it take effect.  group membership, like
user-id, is a per-process attribute and gets inherited by
child processes, and is normally only set once by "login".

The command "groups" will tell you what groups your current
shell are in.

You can also use the command "newgrp" to create a subprocess
with different group membership.

The form needs to have enctype="multipart/form" is my guess.

<form method="post" action="upload.php" enctype="multipart/form">

  Mondo was written up in Linux Journal last year. It's a very good tool
that creates a snapshot of your entire system -- boot image and all -- on a
cdrom. I played with it a little but got distracted by business.

Try having the die message print out the name of the file and make sure
that looks right and that it does exist.

Still, I am sure you need the multipart/form section there.

The uploaded temporary file name is given by:

Here's how I usually handle file uploads...

Note, you do need the form encoding type to be multipart/form-data...

The example below is from the form element:
<form type=file name=img>

// Check if there was anything in the img form element...
if ($img != '' && $img != "none") {
  // Check for correct type
  if (($img_type != 'image/jpeg') && ($img_type != 'image/pjpeg')) {
    echo "Not the right file type.  Image must be in jpeg format.";
    exit();
  }
  // Check for limited size
  if ($img_size > 81920) {
    echo "Thumbnail image is too large.";
    exit();
  }
  // Read in the binary
  $img_bin = fread(fopen($img, "r"), filesize($img));
  // Write it to where we want it
  if (fwrite(fopen($file, "w"), $img_bin, filesize($img))) {
    echo "<p align=center><b class=red>Thumbnail image uploaded successfully. (" . filesize($img) . " bytes)</b></p>\n";
  } else {
    echo "Upload error.";
  }
}

The thing to note is that PHP automatically adds the:
 _type and _size 
for you.  There may be more efficient ways, but this is from working code.

Hope it helps,
Rob

It should be:

OK, I put a phpinfo() at the top of my script and it shows this:

_FILES["file"] Array
(
    [name] => somefile.txt
	 [type] => text/plain
	 [tmp_name] => /tmp/phpQl537A
	 [size] => 56
)

Soooooo...  It looks like PHP knows about the file I uploaded, but for
some reason my script doesn't see it.  When I print the $file and
$file_name variables, I don't get anything.  And /tmp/phpQ1537A doesn't
exist when I look in /tmp.
Thanks for your help.

Did you try getting the temporary file name using:
  $tmp_file= $HTTP_POST_FILES[ 'file'][ 'tmp_name'];
?

Your form should also have a MAX_FILE_SIZE hidden variable:
<input type="hidden" name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value="100000"/>

Value is the maximum upload file size in bytes. I have read that the
maximum maximum is 2 Megabytes.

The temporary file is automatically deleted when the script completes.

Thanks to all that helped me on this.  It's working now.  Here's the PHP
code I'm using:

<?
if ($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'] != "") {
	copy($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], "/tmp/" . $_FILES['file']['name'])
		or die("Couldn't copy file.");
}
else {
	die("No file specified.");
}
?>

Global vars are disabled in newer releases of PHP, so that's why I
couldn't use the $file_name and $file_size type variables.

If the rules of PLUG have changed and this "stuff I want to

apologize, not let it happen again, etc., etc.  (I've been
away from PLUG for a couple months, so I dunno...)

I have a 2-user "not for resale" NetWare 4.1 which includes a
software developer kit that I never used.  Does anyone
want this?  If you need more info, let me know; I'll try
to tell you what you need.  Since it is "not for resale", 
I'm _not_ selling it--I'll give this one away.  I may even 
deliver it if I'm in your neighborhood soon.  (I live in
Salem.) 

Second item I have is a 4-bay SCSI CDROM tower with 4 4x
CDROMs in it.  I'm asking $75.  Pictures of the unit are
here:

One other thing...  You must have this line:

<input type="hidden" name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value="200000">

Otherwise the upload won't work (with no obvious explanation as to what
went wrong).  The value can be changed to what you want (within the limits
of the php.ini file, of course), but this line must be present in the HTML
file.

The guys I know at redhat, swore at reiser, this was 6 months or so. 


I will ask around what are the issues. 

The jist I got was there were data integrity issues with Reiser.

My understanding is that, although ReiserFS is working very well now and is 
a fine journaling file system, it is significantly slower than EXT3 and 
others.  The big advantage of ReiserFS is compact storage (with the tail 
option on - the default, I think) and rapid opening/closing of large 
numbers of small files, but this is no help with large, single-file 
databases.

I'm told that ReiserFS speeds up kernel builds significantly, and it's 
great for news servers because you can efficiently store message as files 
and use grep, etc.

No, I talked to people who had to switch databases, due to MySQL
shortcomings. 

What I think it boils down to is MySQL rocks to snarf web logs, where
each item new entry into table. And mostly Reads. Where MySQL is MS
Access light. 80/20 rule, Where MySQL team only made fast what occurs
80% of the time, threw out the rest. 

WOW  UNION is implemented in MySQL 4.0.0.
Wait , dev tree is only on 4.0.1. 

Postgres Rocks where you have many people playing with the same dataset
issuing updates. Think of postgres as oracleGPL for the people.

ReiserFS if memory severed rocked at itty bity files. 

Have you looked at the # of patches that come out for ReiserFS ?? 
http://www.namesys.com/download.html

These types of messages do not give me warm fuzzy, when it comes to my
data. 
----------------------------------------------------------
CAUTION
WARNING
1. Don't use linux kernel 2.4.16 or earlier for reiserfs operations, as
many of those releases contain critical bugs, some of the most serious
of which are not in reiserfs but affect reiserfs. 2.4.16, 2.4.9, and
2.4.3 are especially bad. The SuSE release of 2.4.16 is ok, it contains
some needed patches. 2.4.18 is the latest release at the time of
writing, and it said to be solid and reliable.
2. For linux kernel 2.5.6 or 2.5.7 you need an additional patch that
will allow the use of reiserfs: 01-revert_broken_alviro_cleanup.diff
----------------------------------------------------------

Here are some bonie runs :)

I think that this is what you want, 
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=5841

your best bet is to setup a testenv , and play around with things :)

I would set up some win 98 boxes to pound on your linux box. 
And a NT/w2k/xp box to run the benchmark. 

Mysql, Postgres have MS ODBC drivers. 

You might want to setup some boxes, to pound your database. 

Your co-worker boxes, yes use the extra cycles.

How come? 
Their published benchmarks shows completely opposite picture

According to what you've wrote ReiserFS is suitable for web and news server 
applications with a bunch of small static files or CGI/FCGI scripts.
EXT3 or may be XFS are suitable for dealing with large files and databases.

It means that if you want to combine web and database server in one box you 
have to put all your web content on ReiserFS partition and  locate your DB 
data directories on EXT3 or XFS partition.
Did I make a right assumption?

Speaking of non-PDX job opps, there was a small article in the Oregonian about
Symantec corporation.

I don't supponse anyone recalls, but several years ago Symantec corporation
(makers of Peter Norton's PC Anywhere, Norton Antivirus and others) got a
series of special tax breaks and a shitpile of lottery money to locate a
tech support center down in the old BonMarche shopping mall in Eugene that
employed up to 300 people I think it was.

I remember going down there once when I was still working for Symantec and
getting a kick out of seeing the old escalator in the building - first office
building I ever saw with an escalator.  It was cheaper to just leave it in
there instead of taking it out.

Well anyway Symantec is cutting loose all the customer support and tech
support positions to an outsourcer.  What the article didn't explain was
that usually how this happens is that Symantic terminates all employees
across the board.  Then the incoming outsourcing company
reads through the personell files and any managers that are making less
than some arbitrary amount they instantly hire, then they take those guys
and run through the rest of the personnel list and line out the
non-performers,
and the folks making a lot of money who have been there for a long time.
Then they offer the remaining employees new jobs at the same pay rate, but
less benefits.  Then they go out and hire the remaining people that they
need to fill the empty positions.

If you know anyone who has zero professional computer experience but wants
to break into the industry, let them know about this, the outsourcer is
Spectrum Contact Services, of Dallas TX.  Doing desktop support for these
kinds of products is a killer, and I guarentee that the benefits and pay
will be worse for the employees that get fired from Symantec and rehired by
these people, so your going to see a lot of disgruntled employees quit over
the next year.  It's not a fun kind of job.  But, it's one of the best ways
to gain experience and having a year of support work on your resume is a
lot better than nothing.  Also the location is close to the University of
Oregon.

The article did take the space to mention that doing this disqualifies the
company for any economic development tax breaks.  No word on if they have
to pay back the lottery money.  I suppose I could make a mention here about
the uselessness of having government officials wasting taxpayer dollars on
boondoggles like getting corporations that run sweatshops to locate in their
cities but I suppose I'll just keep quiet. ;-)

On the plus side, it's still jobs for the area. Eugene needs all they can
get their hands on... the no-growth stance makes for a great living city
but a horrible working city.

Wasn't it back in february that oregon had the nation's highest
unemployment rate?

Back in February? I thought I heard that we were still #1, or perhaps we've
slipped to second place now.

Incidentally, a McJob such as the Symantec outsourcing <coughdebaclecough>
is in fact a good way to get into support if that's what you want to do.

I was looking for something in Freshmeat when I came across the entry for
Worker. The entry is dated 1999, Pretty old for Linux software to me, but I
like trying "new to me" software and grabbed it. 

I normally use gentoo for a two window file manager but now that I have worked
with worker for the past week, it will be replacing gentoo.

Gentoo is prettier, but worker seems to do more for me.

Thanks for those links, I'll try them.

I can't live without FileRunner, which also hasn't been maintained in 
awhile, but works great.  (One big bug:  it will let you overwrite an 
existing file during a rename operation.)  It's written in tcl/tk so there 
must be someone who could fix that.

Its configuration file is plain text and easy to tweak.  Added bonus is its 
built-in ftp client with anonymous and proxy support.

Does anyone know if Worker or Gentoo will display a highlighted diff (ala 
tkdiff) of two dirs?  (Not that FileRunner does, but it would be a nice 
thing to have.)

Cheers,
Kyle Accardi

That's just how mv works.  I wouldn't consider that a bug.

I know.  But since it has a button for "move" and one for "rename" it would 
be nice to be able to turn on some idiot protection if you want it.

Just trying out gentoo and it is very cool.

worker's `configure` script wasn't happy with me.

Don't know about those.  However, there is "dirdiff":
    ftp://samba.org/pub/paulus/dirdiff-1.5.tar.gz

There's a desription of it at:
  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=101703946418410&w=2

It does colored dir diff-ing.  I haven't looked yet, but I
suspect that it's a text mode app, not a GUI.

Galen,

  That's what I have:

crw-rw----   1 root     uucp       4,  64 May 13 10:04 /dev/ttyS0

 and,

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ groups
rshepard daemon wheel uucp users vmwin98

  But, when I try to sync the Palm, it just sits there; nothing happens and
no error message shows up in the jpilot window.

  Is there a way for me to test the device or start debugging this problem?

Many thanks,

Rich

  I don't know why this is happening, but I don't think it should.

  When I'm logged in as me -- the user -- and I ask 'ls -l /dev/ttyS0' I
see:
crw-------    rshepard   uucp   /dev/ttyS0

and I see this when I su to root, too.

  But, when I log in as root, and I ask 'ls -l /dev/ttyS0' I see:
crw-rw----    root       uucp   /dev/ttyS0

which is what it should be.

  Also, the itime is updated each time I see the improper ownership and
permissions, su to root, and make the change.

  Doesn't matter how often I log out and log back in, I see the same results
of 'list'.

  What might be happening here?

Thanks,

Rich

I was down there at the time. I got tired of watching the local city government
people falling all over themselves as they described in gushing detail how
much of a positive impact Symantec was going to have on the downtown mall.

The city had this great idea about blocking the downtown off from auto
traffic. And then they were puzzled when everyone drove to gateway mall
to do their shopping.

Businesses began deserting the downtown like rats from a sinking ship.

I applied there (Symantec in Eugene) once, just to get an idea of
what was on the questionaires.

I passed info back to my friend who was a CC instructor. He wanted to
get an idea of what skills his retrained-logger students would need to
get into tech support.

The questions centered around what happens in DOS before Windows starts.

I lived in Eugene from 1990-1994.  The city government with its politics
and philosophies on community and economic development are indeed really
messed up.

I was down there at the time. I got tired of watching the local city
government people falling all over themselves as they described in
gushing detail how much of a positive impact Symantec was going to have
on the downtown mall.

The city had this great idea about blocking the downtown off from auto
traffic. And then they were puzzled when everyone drove to gateway mall
to do their shopping.

Businesses began deserting the downtown like rats from a sinking ship.

I applied there (Symantec in Eugene) once, just to get an idea of what
was on the questionaires.

I passed info back to my friend who was a CC instructor. He wanted to
get an idea of what skills his retrained-logger students would need to
get into tech support.

The questions centered around what happens in DOS before Windows starts.

Look in /etc/security. Check for a file called console.perms.

Wish I understood where this came from, and why. It wreaks all sorts
of havoc with my system. In my opinion this sort of thing doesn't
belong on a multi-user system.

It connects, but no TCP/IP - just dialup command-line access.  What
could I be forgetting?

router / options.ttySx file


I think you're describing the basic function of these routers.  I think
about ALL they do is NAT.  We have one IP adddress, and all the boxes
connected to the router have their own 192.168.1.xxx address.  I can
route up to 10 specific incoming ports to different boxes. There is also
a DMZ host option which will send all incoming ports (unless otherwise
routed) to a single box.

So....I think this will work.  I *THINK* I set everythig up OK last
night, grabbed the cel phone, gave myself a jingle, and the USR hardware
PCI modem on ttys4 picked up and started squealing. Most of my local
friends are OIT college students, and are pretty busy on Friday nights,
so I could not recruit anyone who had a modem (most are on a LAN
connection) to test it for me.  8am on  saturday is still too early to
wake anyone up.    I'll head out in awhile to a friend's with my laptop
and try it then.

---------
One thing I am unclear on is the options.ttyS4 file (S4 in my case).
Section 1.8 of the walkthrough I mentioned in my original message
suggests:

	To set a specific IP for a client and server for each tty,
update the /etc/ppp/options.ttyname file for each tty: 


   		 serverIP:clientIP

I set mine up to be:

192.168.1.102:192.168.1.140

Note that I assigned the .140 for the dialup client.

Does this sound OK?

I don't have experience with the Linksys router (I wish I did) and so 
whether or not you can access the internet through the router would 
depend on how it does NAT. If you can set it up so that it does NAT for 
your entire private subset e.g. 192.168.1.x then that would allow the 
PPP connected client to access the internet through the router as well.

Are you starting up pppd? For a user dialing in they would login and 
only have a shell prompt until "pppd" is started. Did you look at the 
PPP-HOWTO? It shows a useful "ppp" alias that will overlay the user's 
shell process with a running PPP daemon.

Well, that got me through another hurdle, and on to the next.

Rather than ask you to go out of your way to RTFM for me again, could you 
tell me how you are finding the info?  I did set up an account with Oracle 
to download it in the first place, but I'm not finding how to find answers

Subject: [PLUG] Printing music (TeX, but not MusiXTeX)
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0205192250190.16568-100000@shaft.bitmine.net>

Quite a bit to cover, I guess.

So, I've used denemo <URL:http://www.gnu.org/software/denemo/denemo.html >
to input some music for print-out and to maybe play it back on my PC to
make sure it sounds roughly correct, but it neither plays back nor prints.

Denemo is a graphical front-end to Lilypond
<URL: http://www.gnu.org/software/lilypond/lilypond.html >.

First, printing:

Lilypond produces TeX output for printing.  Lilypond installed a whole
bunch of tex, metafont, and scheme stuff in /usr/share/lilypond.  But when
I try to print the tex output, it says it can't find 'lilyponddefs'.

jbrelin at person:~$ locate lilyponddefs
/usr/share/lilypond/ps/lilyponddefs.ps
/usr/share/lilypond/tex/lilyponddefs.tex

So, there's that.  Then I do this:

jbrelin at person:~$ locate defs.tex
/usr/share/lilypond/tex/lily-pdf-defs.tex
/usr/share/lilypond/tex/lily-ps-defs.tex
/usr/share/lilypond/tex/lilyponddefs.tex
/usr/share/lilypond/tex/titledefs.tex
/usr/share/texmf/tex/cyrplain/base/txxdefs.tex
/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/cyrillic/lcydefs.tex

So I symlinked /usr/share/lilypond/tex to /usr/share/texmf/tex/lilypond.

And that seemed to solve that.

But now I do this:

jbrelin at person:~$ lilypond agplez.ly 
GNU LilyPond 1.4.9

Interpreting music...[8][9]
Preprocessing elements... 
Calculating column positions... [3][6]
paper output to `agplez.tex'...

The parse error makes me think there's something wrong with denemo and the
way it creates the mudela input.  But lilypond still creates TeX output as
well as MIDI.

But when I try to interpret the TeX, I get this:

jbrelin at person:~$ texi2pdf ./agplez.tex

What gives with all those curly brace errors?

And the fonts aren't found.  OK.  The fonts appear to be located in one of

/usr/share/lilypond/tfm/feta16.tfm

So which do I add where?

Anyway, that's enough to start.

And it hangs for quite a while then exits.  I assume it thinks it's

I also tried, by the way, the TiMiDiTy plug-in for XMMS and got
nothing... that is, xmms doesn't even recognize the midi file as something
it might even want to try to play even though the plug-in is present and
enabled in the input plug-in browser.

Any other methods I'm not trying here?

Hi, all.

As you might know if you read my last two messages, I'm working on
putting some music together and would like to be able to edit and print it
nicely.

Lilypond came with an Emacs major mode and I copied it here:

/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/lilypond-mode.el

Yet, when I'm in Emacs and do M-x lilypond, it says [No match].

What's wrong here?

I'm full of 'em tonight.

So, I'm trying to make mine Gnus for mail.

I was happy to find that I'm familiar with most of the navigation
keybindings in emacs from using pico with pine.

However, for code and most other editting, I've been using vi for
years.

I went through the Tutorial document and got much of the basics of
manipulating windows and files and navigating, but the search info left
something to be desired.

Particularly, I am used to and comfortable with the regular expression
search and replace stuff in vi.  Is there something like that in
emacs?  Particular, I like the idea of specifying ranges of lines to which
one can apply a given regular expression.

Am I just out of luck, there?

And I'd like to use Gnus for mail reading.

Can someone point me to documentation that will help me get Gnus
configured to read my existing mboxen and use gpg?

Thanks.

Hmm, you see this 
http://www.lilypond.org/wiki/?LilyPondInstall

 Is there an emacs mode?

Yes. It is included with the source archive as `lilypond-mode.el'. If
you have an RPM it is in `/usr/doc/lilypond-<VERSION>/'. You have to
install it yourself:

Move lilypond-mode.el into a suitable directory (in this example:
~/usr/share/emacs/ ), and put the following into your emacs startup file
(typically this is ~/.emacs)

(setq auto-mode-alist
	      (append '(("\\.ly$" . lilypond-mode)
			)
		      auto-mode-alist))

(autoload 'lilypond-mode "~/usr/share/emacs/lilypond-mode"
	 "Lilypond editing mode." t)

I have a little saying 

Think of emacs as the air craft carrier of the editors, with thermo
nuclear weapons on board. 

vim is a sniper rifle of editors. Small but powerful.

Not to start something here, really, but if you want to edit text files and 
not
do dishes or remember Klingon, Nedit may be for you.  Regexp search, () & 
{} matching,
spelling, syntax highlighting, macros, <ctrl>s to save, etc.

It's to give the person sitting at a PC access to devices
that they're supposed to be able to use, like audio devices,
mouse devices, display devices, etc.  Generally, on a
multi-user system you don't want everybody to have access to
/dev/audio or whatever, cuz then a remote user can fuck
things up for the person sitting at the console.

The old method was to make these devices owned by root or
some non-root system uid or gid, and any programs that
needed to play with sound or whatever would need to be
set-id, or else talk to a daemon with the right privileges
that enforced access control.  This method is prone to
stupid security holes.

The new method is to have login give ownership of these
devices to the person who logs in on the console, which
isolates the treacherous security code to just one place.

viper mode provides incremental levels of vi keybinding behavior for Emacs.
It ships with Emacs 21.

M-x viper-mode

But it has some unfortunate side effects. If I telnet/ssh into my
machine and I'm not logged into the console I get
  "Couldnt get a file descriptor referring to the console"
because /dev/console is 600 root. This prevents job control by the
shell. It took me a while to figure out that's also what was preventing
friends from logging in and playing sounds to get my attention. :-)

Maybe I wasn't clear.

I don't really want vi keybindings in emacs... if I want vi keybindings,
I'll use vim.

I want to use emacs, but I want to apply regular expressions to lines as I
edit a file.

Is that available in default mode emacs?

As I read this, I understood it to mean this autoloads the lilypond mode
when I edit a file ending in .ly.  That's all well and good, but I want to
enter lilypond mode from an empty buffer.

I can't imagine that I need to edit my .emacs file for that capability.

  Jeme> Is that available in default mode emacs?

regular expression searching is available as both a search and an
incremental search.

use "ctrl-h a regexp" to get a list of commands which use regexp.

meta-ctrl-s is isearch-forward-regexp

search-forward-regexp is not assigned to a key by default.

ctrl-h f search-forward-regexp

The only way I know of to apply a regexp search to a given set of
lines is to "narrow" the file.

All of this is also available from within the info file for emacs.

You have stumbled across the biggest problem with emacs - finding the
name of a command for something you are just sure should exist.  At
this point in human history - if you think that you should be able to
do something in emacs then someone has already written a routine to do
it.  You have no choice but to read the documentation.  The info file
is best.

Generally you can enter a mode by doing:

M-x name-of-the-mode-mode

So for this lilypond thing, you should be able to say:

M-x lilypond-mode

and the buffer should be in lilypond-mode.

Right.  You must have missed my original message.

I tried that and got [No match].

So what am I doing wrong?

Thanks, I'm usually more clear than in my last post...but the thread has
most of the details.  People have a habit here of including only part of
previous posts when replying, so I see it is not included below.   I
used a different how-to at:

http://www.redhat.com/support/resources/tips/Dialup-Tips/ppp_server_tips
.html

I set up /etc/ppp/options - but I think you hit the nail on the head:
pppd is still not starting.  Looking at the service configuration
utility of Redhat - pppd is not even *LISTED* -- checked or unchecked --
for runlevels 3, 4, or 5. (3 is what we want I beleive).

I will check your how-to and see what it says about getting pppd to go.

if dmesg displays the first part of the boot log, there must be a
command to display the rest - where the drives are mounted and the
services started with the clear-as-a-bell "[OK]" printed on each line?

Are you starting up pppd? For a user dialing in they would login and 
only have a shell prompt until "pppd" is started. Did you look at the 
PPP-HOWTO? It shows a useful "ppp" alias that will overlay the user's 
shell process with a running PPP daemon.

Probably since that is proper email etiquette. Its pretty rude to expect
people to read through a whole thread of irrelevant stuff to get to the
point you are replying to. This is also why companies like mine spend
huge amounts of money backing up email that is pretty much the same
information over and over again. The proper way to respond is to edit
out all but what you are responding to and then put your response
underneath. Some bad email clients like Outlook ..the one you use) make
this harder by  putting the cursor and signature on top.

It always seemed like selective quoting, often taking things out of
context - like the press does.  Plus, with the entire message quoted,
you have a chronological record going down the line, which people can
selectively read.

but that's just my $.02.  It does increase the size of the email over
time of course.

Based on the reviews and recommendations at http://practicallynetworked.com/
I got the SMC 7004AWBR Barricade Wireless Broadband Router and ORiNOCO PC
Card (Gold). I've been quite happy with them. My home LAN consists of my
Linux box (web server) connected via CAT5, my Windoze box (W2K) connected

and my daughter's eMachine (WinME) connected via the USB version of the
ORiNOCO PC Card (Gold).

First off, are you sure that you have a midi enabled sound card?
You might want to try running timidity from the command line on
your midi file to see if it does anything.  Or playmidi -f might
work as well.

Right.  I guess I should have been more clear.

I tried M-x lilypond<tab> and M-x lilypond-mode.  Both yielded [No match].

Did you run 'texhash' after that new stuff was installed?  I'm relatively
new to TeX/LaTeX, but the TeX processor will not see any definitions,
etc. that are not in its database, which is updated by texhash.

Emacs doesn't automatically scan or load the files in
/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp, so it doesn't know where to find the function
called lilypond-mode.  Try adding this line to your .emacs.

(autoload 'lilypond-mode "lilypond-mode" "LilyPond major mode." t)

This will cause emacs to load lilypond-mode.el or .elc when the 
lilypond-mode function is executed.  Once the file is loaded, all of the
emacs lilypond functions will be available.

Alternatively, you add this to /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-start.el.
This eliminates the need to modify the individual ~/.emacs files.

You will probably still want to add a line like this:

(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.ly$" . lilypond-mode) auto-mode-alist))

If you add the autoload line from above, you will be able to enter
lilypond-mode from an empty buffer by typing M-x lilypond-mode.  However,
I would suggest a slightly different approach.  I rarely if ever start
editing in an empty buffer.  I usually do a C-x C-f to start editing a
new file.  By doing it this way the buffer is automatically put into
the mode indicated by the filename extension.  For instance, if I do
C-x C-f new.c, I get a new buffer named new.c that is in C-mode.  If
you changed your mind about the file name, you can just write the buffer
out to a different name with C-x C-w.

Well, if you ever see that happen, it's pretty easy to just call someone
on it.  I find it's rare that a person is even motivated to do such a
thing [as choose selected quotes that are misleading out of context], but
it has happened and never stands up to public scrutiny.  Remember, this is
an interactive medium.  It's nothing like the press.

We work in an electronic (and therefore maleable) medium therefore we have
an added responsibility to maintain accurate records for posterity.  Once
there was a request from the users of a mailing list I administered to
modify the archives to remove data that "shouldn't have gone to the list".  
I refused and all hell broke loose.  I tried to explain that the archives
existed as the objective collective memory of the list and tampering with
them destroys any concept of reality we might entertain.  A person will go
back to the archives to verify a memory.  If the information is not in the
archive, the memory failes to be validated and, in some kinds of reasoning
where one expects the archive to be accurate and complete, often
INVALIDATED.  Surely we can't fuck with people's memories like that.  
[The compromise was to modify the post with big red warnings all
throughout that post saying that the information had been compromised and
modified and should not be considered an accurate record.  I then
immediately resigned as administrator and forced the list to be hosted
elsewhere.]

> Plus, with the entire message quoted, you have a chronological record

And yet, it causes a person to spend three times as long reading a post of
any complexity because we read from top down.  A person reads the reply at
the top, needs context and hence reads the body of the message quoted
below, then goes back to the top to try to re-interpret the reply in light
of the refreshed memory/new information provided by the original
post.  Repeat for each post in the thread.

We have a chronological record going back down the line for each thread
that people can selectively read.  They're called the archives.  We don't
need it in every freakin' post.

If I understand what you want, you are looking for M-C-%
which is emacs' regexp search and replace function.

Do:   C-h C-k M-C-%
to get you into the on-line Emacs Manual entry for this command.

If you have some really complicated application it is very easy to
write a "keyboard macro" to do it for you.  Very briefly, C-x ( puts
Emacs into "record keyboard macro" mode. (I'm using "mode" here in
its colloquial, not its Emacs, sense).  Emacs will now remember nearly
any sequence of keystrokes, including multiple M-C-% with changing
arguments, &c.  Close the macro with C-x ).  Now every time you hit
C-x e, the entire sequence is run.  I've done some wonderfully
complicated things this way.  There's much more to this.
Hit C-h C-k C-x ( u to begin learning.

Finally, I hope you have a proper Meta (or Alt) key defined and are
not having to use the ESC-ESC trick. I recently put someone onto
Emacs here in the lab and after a month checked back in on him.
He was using ESC-ESC for all the M- commands (but _still_ using
Emacs, nonetheless---which is a testimony either to his
stupidity or The Power of Emacs). 


Dean

P.S.  There are also ways to apply Unix commands like `sed'
      to individual lines (or regions) if you like, but I think
      M-C-% may be what you are looking for.

P.P.S.  Pay no attention to the riff-raff who try to steer you
        from Emacs to lesser editors :-)

Well, I ran texconfig and selected REHASH.  If that's the same thing, then
yes, I did that.

It appears to be the fonts that aren't found now.  I'm not sure where to
symlink them in.

Message-ID: <3CE91AEE.9060509@sun.com>

Probably the easiest way to do this would be to get a standalone AP (Access 
Point) and a PCMCIA card for your laptop.  Linksys seems to make a good 
product, I believe they support 128-bit encryption (although WEP isn't exactly 
'good' encryption).  I'm using a Dell-branded Orinoco/Lucent RG-1000 and 
Silver 802.11b PCMCIA card in a Inspiron 8100.  I've also got a Linksys PCI 
card in my workstation upstairs.

Another option might be to purchase a PCI card (or PCI/PCMCIA Adapter card and 
a PCMCIA Card) that you can install into your Linux box to act as an AP.  The 
PersonalTelco website has lots of information on this. 
(http://www.personaltelco.net)

Although, you'll probably be just fine grabbing something off-the-shelf from 
whatever Big Electronics Store (tm) that complies with the 802.11b standard. 
I'd personally stay with brands you know, but others may know of better 
solutions for more reasonable prices.

Hope that helps,

-Richard

Awesome, Galen.  Thanks.  Not only did you answer the question with enough
information to make sense, you anticipated my next question (about
site-wide configuration) and answered that, too.

Thanks heaps.

This approach made sense to me as soon as I opened emacs and wanted a new,
empty buffer.  After following the tutorial, the only way I knew to do
such a thing was to create a new, empty file.

Understand that my initial reluctance to just follow the information given
in the instructions that came with lilypond was based entirely on the fact
that it meant changing only my local .emacs file and didn't help with
site-wide configuration.

Thanks heaps.

Hello Linux folkz,

I'm trying to solve this technical problem in our Eng. Dept:
Imagine two identical SQL databases residing on separate Linux boxes.
One of these two boxes has temporary dial up internet access. The
second one is permanently hooked up on Internet with static IP.
When something has been removed/updated/inserted in one of these
databases, the same operations with data in another database should be
performed to syncronize both databases untill the next connection.
It's not a case where I can setup distributed database on two separate
Linux boxes.

Thank you in advance for any ideas or sources of information.
Alex

I grew up in Eugene. I lived there from 1964 through 1999. I also worked 
for Symantec for 5 years in Eugene. I must say that Symantec was (haven't 
been there in three years) a wonderful place to work for. Excellent pay and 
benefits. Trouble was, I couldn't go *UP* anymore without taking a 
management (yech!) position or relocating. I'm a techy geek, and I don't 
like managing people much. I don't like California much (don't look at my 
left hand, with the Ca. birth cert. in it.)...

Yup. Symantec refit the Bon building to have more telephone switching power 
than many of the telephone companies that operate in Oregon.

And actually, it DID have a very positive impact. With 600 addn'l jobs on 
the west end of the mall, it increased the non-retail job count in downtown 
quite a bit. Several restaurants were able to continue to do business 
and/or open due to Symantec locating downtown.

Um, Gateway Mall wasn't anywhere on the drawing boards when the Mall was 
built in 1969. In fact, what is now Gateway Mall was farmland.

Over the last 15 years, more streets have been opened than closed in 
downtown Eugene. Willamette, Olive, Broadway has been talked about, 10th.

The Downtown Mall was built to counter Valley River Center. The Downtown 
Mall's biggest failure was that it wasn't covered like the big malls are. 
An open air mall in the Willamette Valley just doesn't make sense.

It was also the first escalator in Eugene. I believe it's considered 
historic by the city, and they couldn't take it out. Same for the Elevator 
in that building. Slower than molasses in January, but it's the first one 
in Eugene.

Which makes sense. In 1994, Windows 3.1 was the dominant platform, and you 
had to know how DOS and Windows worked to toubleshoot Norton Utilities.

 From what I understand from my friends that work there, only the consumer 
products are doing this. I'd find it hard to believe that Symantec would 
walk away from the multi-million dollar building they just built in the

Oh, why did Symantec move out of downtown? The people of Eugene outlawed 
tax incentives to businesses. It seems they felt that Symantec and Hyundai 
got too much of a break for coming in, generating living wage jobs, and 
generally doing good things for the economy of a town STILL mostly 
dependant on resource intensive businesses.

What kernel do you have?  I don't know if this is anything similiar to what
you have, but I just get noise from my sound card right now.  I use RH 7.2
(I know you don't) and the kernel version I have installed (2.4.10 I think)
broke the driver for my sound card (I'm at work and I can't remember the
name of the driver).  The sound driver worked before I upgraded to 7.2.  I
am going to upgrade to 7.3 soon and hope this will fix it.

Message-ID: <319FB8934F09BF48A3F3228370882667385F57@wsimail.worksystems.org>

Thanks for the help.  I fixed the problem.  I mistakenly installed the
75 dpi fonts in addition to the 100 dpi fonts.  When I took out the 75,
everything works fine.  Fortunately, I don't install abiword because of
the font problem it has.  Has anyone noticed any improvement in font
appearance when installing Crossover's true type fonts?

I had the same thing, and it was the usual "AbiWord's god-awful
knock-off truetype" issue.

You can:

a.) Remove AbiWord if you don't use it

b.) Remove the entry for the AbiWord fonts in /etc/X11/fs/config by
commenting out this line:

/usr/share/AbiSuite/fonts

Which will at least keep them out of your way until you use AbiWord and
it goes ahead and adds them to your path anyhow

c.) Get the real Times New Roman, Arial, and a few others that AbiWord
fakes and put them in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TTF since Red Hat has at
least jimmied the aliases on AbiWord's fonts so they'll be used after
the real ones if it can find them. If you must use AbiWord, this is your
best solution.

Between antiword for catting out the .doc's I get to a text file and
OpenOffice for reading .rtf's and others, AbiWord has found its way off
my machine.  Too bad, since it's a passable WordPad substitute, but the
entire font situation (two years in the making, and stubbornly stuck to
despite consistently being the most voted-on bug) will keep it off my
machines until they get around to introducing proper freetype support.

The bug report itself on this particular issue makes for some
interesting reading:

http://bugzilla.abisource.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1030

I sympathize with the developers, who aren't running Burger King
regardless of the gifts they bring to the table, but the entire debate
feels a little mule-headed nonetheless.

Subject: [PLUG] postfix + spamassassin
Message-ID: <20020520095847.C37217@cogit8.org>

I got spamassassin working on Postfix (using the spamd/spamc combo).
It works well.  For now, I'm only adding the words [SPAM] to the
subject, so I can filter it at my email client.

If later I just want to drop all those emails, or even reject them,
does anyone know if the filter comes before the header_checks?

My thought was to add a header_check for /^Subject: [SPAM]/ or one of
the spam headers.

Or does spamassassin have another way to just reject the mails marked
as spam?

Thanks,
Rob

Do you accept mail for the domain "manymoons.net"?

If you do, then this is a normal message that sendmail has accepted a 
message, but doesn't know who the user is (which you say is correct).

The relay is most likely (you don't give us the "Connect" line, so I can't 
be sure) the system that delivered the message to your mail server, but, as 
Sendmail said, it may be forged.

Yes, it's probably spam. mail.com is a known spamhouse.

No, it doesn't look like they are trying to relay through you. At least, 
not from what you have above.

I can't remember if I got midi working on that card under linux or not
(debian).  I think I did... I might check later.  I remember it being a
pain, though.  Probably due to debian package age. :)  (Although there is
supposedly a "debian music distro" project that I may try one of these
days... http://www.demudi.org )

What I do remember is resorting to compiling and using the latest ALSA
drivers most of the time.   Sounds like you're using the included OSS Free
ones.  If you keep running into dead ends there, perhaps you could give ALSA
a try?

Message-ID: <3CE9599F.308B9B77@attbi.com>

Where do I go (on the Internet) to look up who uses a particular IP
address? I just got an automated e-mail from e-bay regarding a forgotten
password. It's connected to an old e-mail address of mine that I haven't
used for several years. Now that I think about it, I did make a short
try at using e-bay way back then, but didn't pursue it. Since I started
with @home, and now attbi, I've received occasional promotional e-mails
from e-bay sent to that old account. (I asked the old ISP to forward my
e-mail back before I dropped the account. They must have left the
forward flag set because I still get the odd e-mail from that old
account.)

Anyway, it appears that someone was trying to get at my old e-bay
account by requesting a password reminder. I'm just curious enough to do
a little looking at who might have made that request. The password
reminder e-mail from e-bay includes the IP address and the ISP host from
where the request was made.

  whois.

  There are three whois servers:

   whois xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx at whois.arin.net		North America
   whois xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx at whois.ripe.net		Europe
   whois xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx at whois.apnic.net	Asia & Pacific Rim

  If that doesn't give you enough informaiton, try the 'host' command (which
does essentially the same thing) but, better yet,
http://www.betterwhois.com.

  nslookup has been deprecated.

Aha! I was trying to do it by going to whois.net with a browser. That
works if you're looking up a name, but didn't give me anything useful
(in my first attempt, anyway) for an IP address. Didn't occur to me that
whois was also a command.

Looks like someone in Cincinnati tried to get at my old e-bay account.
Thanks, Rich.

Yes, emacs is to "text editing" what Perl is to "scripting".

What's even more amazing is you can embed a Perl interpreter into an
Emacs process, and pass Emacs data to Perl and Perl objects to Emacs
rather cleanly.  And you can invoke it in command-line mode (to use
Emacs Lisp as a subsystem of Perl) or window mode (to use Perl code as
a subsystem of Emacs).

The mind boggles.

Hello Linux folkz,

I've got two different hard drives fast SCSI and slow IDE.
My Linux distro installed on that slow IDE HD.
If I move only DB and web content directories to faster HD will it
improve or decrease performance of the whole system?

I assume that database and web server daemons are running in the
system memory space. They need to be red from slow IDE partition just
once during start up. The rest of the time they will happily read and
write information to faster partition on SCSI HD without hindering
system performance.
Please correct me if my assumption wrong.
Thank you in advance for any responses.
Alex

My CD-RW plays music CD's and reads files from them
when the CD is not mounted. However, when a CD is
mounted (even as root) it gives the message: "No

problem? My kernel version is 2.4.13, if that gives

Some Web hosts offer a shared certificate, like my fave host that you are 
probably bored with me plugging,  http://www.affordablehost.com/hosting.shtml 
Shared is $25/yr, not shared is $125. Don't know how useful this is for you, 
as your site must be hosted with them to get the cheap deal. Doubtless there 
other vendors of shared SSL certificates, Affordable Host is the only one I 
have personal experience with. A Google search for 'shared ssl' returns lotsa 
hits.

Alex,

It is possible to gain performance this way, but you first have to consider 
the disk IO model/characteristics for the machine...

if you have your web stuff on a separate partition that would be good to 
mount on the faster drive.  the general / partition things are *usually* low 
in IO intensity, /etc, /lib, /boot, etc.

What I normally do (dependent upon the machine and its use) is allocate a 
disk (or volume) specifically for web/net services usually including a 
sandbox for most services as well. (SIDE NOTE: if you run bind, please do so 
in a chroot() sandbox....very easy to do with bind9 but preferrably not on a 
web server). 

I do this because apache/Zope/other goodies can be VERY IO INTENSIVE,
and you don't want a heavily pounded web site to slow down normal system 
resources.

If you have a small apache document root directory, and cgi-bin, etc, 
etc...and you have ALOT of ram, you might want to consider testing a 
ramdisk...basically a mmap()'ed directory so that HTML files are delivered 
from memory rather than disk....much faster...

Brian,
Thank you for your response.
In other words non IO intensive partition can be located on a slower
hardware without hindering system performance.

I'm not quite understood what kind of send box you mentioned here.
Is this a swap space or a temporary data storage for running process?

Is Apache server IO intensive just itself or when if it accompanied by
the third party modules and applications?

I'm running perl script in FCGI mode as a persistent process.
It doesn't have to be interpreted/compiled/executed upon each and
every user request. I believe it's not IO intensive.

It maybe not an option in my case. 
I'm quite short on memory just 512MB for everything.

things should be faster.

I would recommend having your swap partition shared over as many drives
as you can.

Alex,

ok....here goes....

What I'm referring to as IO intensive is when there is a disk seek and read 
or disk seek and write, for example opening a HTML page spitting it out to a 
client and closing it....standard webserver stuff...if you have stuff that is 
accessing disk files, standard HTML pages, etc. OR doing alot of logging 
(writing to a log file) -- these are IO procedures....something that is 
pre-compiled, or already loaded into resident memory would not necessarily 
create alot of disk IO, however if such a process is opening a standard file, 
like a template or an include file of some sort, this is where the majority 
of the IO traffic comes into play...you should be able to watch this with 
'top'. --The FreeBSD version (as well as Solaris version) gives IO stats...(I 
screwed up my linux 'top' because I was rebuilding my linux emulator and 
decided to get creative--wrong move) .

The sandbox I was referring to is kindof a BSD-ish jargon term for running a 
process in a jailed environment.  For example: say i have an insecure server 
running on port 65534 called 'hack_me_d' and through the latest in script 
kiddie code, someone causes my horrible server to fall back into a 
shell..boom! they're in...
If the process is running in a sandbox or chroot() jail they would do 
something like:
user at insecure ~ $ cd /
user at insecure / $

when in actuality their REAL position in the filesystem would be something 
like:
/sandbox/insecure/hack_me_d/

((man chroot))

they cannot get outside of the /sandbox/insecure/hack_me_d/ directory tree.

this takes some playing around with source code sometimes but there are alot 
of HOWTOs on this stuff....

If you're running a database on the same box, I would stay away from the 
ramdisk, but they are pretty fast and fun to play with....

A note of caution:
Be very careful what you move around on different partitions....don't put 
/bin on its own partition, same with /lib and /etc...these all have to be 
under / so the machine can boot and recover if necessary..../tmp can be 
linked to /var/tmp if /tmp fills up fast and /var is a big phat 
slice...(Linux systems tend to have bigger / partitions than BSD systems but 
that is a matter of personal preference)

Hope this helps...
-Brian

Due to the fact that I am under-employed and bored and a tweaker....
I am writing a small system for people who manage a number of domains, 
whether they are an opensrs reseller or just have a bunch of domains parked 
pointing at an apache server of theirs...

If your interested, please contact me offlist with suggestions, wishlists, 
etc....so I can build this stuff into it -- and you can have a free landing 
page/logging system....

TIA,

Man, tweakers are bad news.  Stay off the crys, man.

I read a recent report that says they're the number one perpetrators of

A small, usually insulated, screwdriver is called a tweaker, too. It's for 
adjusting RF coils and X-Ray machines.

Subject: [PLUG] More Oracle install troubles
Message-ID: <01C20046.80F29F10.jorgens@coho.net>

Thank you Wally,

I would have thought that if Oracle is offering to let people try Oracle 
for free, they would wan them to have answers to install problems for free, 
too.  Strange.

Anyway, here's my latest hurdle:

Install:
	Installing Apache Web Server Files1.3.1.2.0.0a
	Link pending

	Copying server key
	(meter) 30%

Error window:
	Error writing to file
	/u01/app/oracle/product/8.1.7/Apache/Apache/conf/ssl.key/server.key
	[Help] [Retry] [Ignore] [Cancel]

I very much appreciate your help.

Reply to self:

Postfix does do header checks _after_ spamassassin filtering.  I added
the following header check:

 /^X-Spam-Flag: YES/     REJECT

And it rejects e-mails with that header, which spamassassin adds if it
attains the required hits (points).

Gah!

OK.  First, to restate yesterday's question in a real-world example:

Somebody sent me a text file that is english prose.  The beginning of each
paragraph started with many spaces.  I wanted to quickly convert all the
spaces at the beginning of a line that began with more than three spaces
into a single tab.

I ended up using vi and typing the familiar:
%s/   */^I/
and that did the trick nicely.

How would this be done in emacs?

Second, I'm having trouble finding a mode that does what I expect it to do
with english prose.

For example, this same file has newlines only at the ends of paragraphs
and between sections (where you'll find two or more consecutive newlines,
one delimiting the paragraph, the next the section).  The wrapping in
text-mode is not using word breaks as the wrap point.  So I type M-q to
try and reset the paragraph using the current line break setting of 70
characters and I get the entire section indented one tab and lines broken
on less-than-70-char word breaks with a complete loss of paragraph
delineation.

Is there a mode for english prose or, more specifically, fiction?

Lastly, if someone could actually point me in the right direction to begin
using Gnus with my existing mbox files and gpg, that'd be fantastic.  I'm
really interested to use that thing.

Thanks again.
Jeme.

C-M-% or M-x query-replace-regexp

M-x info and then read up on the slightly differente emacs regexps.

esc %

to access search and replace

3 spaces

then use 

ctrl-Q tab

to enter the tab character.  ctrl-q is the "literal" prefix.  Use it
to enter in control characters.

That should do it.

Does the paragraph begin with indentation ? If it does then emacs is
using that indentation for the whole paragraph.  I'm not actually sure
how you would preserve indentation on the first line only.  As a
matter of fact I looked at the INFO FILE FOR EMACS, and found that, in
theory, it should be possible using the text properties indent.  You
did know that emacs allows text properties, didn't you ?

If it's not filling @ character 70, be sure that the variable
"fill-column" is really truly set to 70.  I know this works because I
use it ALL the time.

ctrl-h v fill-column

Can't help you.  I find gnus to be a bit of a pain to use.  I suspect
I use approx .0001% of its potential functionality.

gnus has its very own info file and it is BIG.

Could you just have a database front end that asks what the user wants
to do, and then does it on both databases?

Not many places carry them anymore.  Just about everyone buys a tower.  Not 
sure where abouts in the area you are located, but out on the west side you 
can try Enu (http://www.enuinc.com) - also in PDX, PC Heidens 
(http://www.pcheiden.com) or Pace Computers (http://www.pacecomputers.com).

They might have one or two to choose from.  Might.  As I said, not many people 
buy desktop machines anymore.  Your best bet might be to troll for them on eBay.

Audio CD's are the only ones that work, because they
do not have to be mounted. CD's which have to be
mounted do not work.

Have you tried a different cd-rom on the same machine?  What about burned 
media vs commercial (pressed) media?  Since mount isn't giving the 'fs type 
not supported' message, it sounds like the cdrom just isn't able to read the 
media inserted.

The cd's are clean and smudge-free, correct?  :)

Sorry, I misunderstood the problem.
but now I don't have a clue...
Anyone else?

Do you have more than one CD drive and you are putting the
media into the other drive?

Subject: [PLUG] Where to buy SSL certs?
References: <3CE91AA3.12035.10C8C276@localhost>
Message-ID: <3CEA82F4.168FDFE5@yahoo.com>

The problem with SSL certs is that a browser has a list of Certification
Authorities (CA's) that it allows to sign the certs.  What that means is
that there only is a limited number of organizations out there that sell
them, so they can charge whatever they want.  It's like domain registration
used to be when NSI was the only registrar.

You can self-sign your ssl certificate, but dumb browsers (*cough* IE) will
basically say that your site is a fraudulent site and that your cert
shouldn't be trusted.  Other browsers such as mozilla just make you review
the details of the certificate and then say "OK" to it.  If your
organization are going to be the only ones using this cert, then it isn't a
big deal, and you can sign it yourself.  It won't work for an E-commerce
site or a site intended for the general public because the warnings will
scare them off.

When I was working with the OpenSRS DNS registry system, they were starting
to sell SSL certs.  I would take a look at opensrs.org and check out the
resellers links to see if anybody is offering them currently.

Is it an ATAPI or a SCSI drive?  How are you mounting it, as an IDE
device (/dev/hd?) or as a SCSI device (/dev/sg?)?  I've has some luck
reading data from a CDR by mounting it as /dev/hd?.  YMMV.

Good Luck

Randy;

Would you please provide us with your ``mount'' command and the output of ``dmesg?'' This will help us determine your hardware and get your CD mounted. It may be the case that you are doing something like this:

    mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom

That should be fine except ``/dev/cdrom'' points to a device that does not exist.

You can get a copy of dmesg by performing the following:

  dmesg > dmesg.txt

This will re-direct the output of the dmesg command to a file for later inclusion to your email.

Subject: [PLUG] Extracting the pid from ps -ax
Message-ID: <3CEA8BF4.A5998052@attbi.com>

The next thing I want to do with my php juke box is to allow for
shutting down a playing mp3 file. I can send a ps -ax command to find
out what the pid is, but I'm having trouble extracting just that number.
I want to use the number so I can create a button that will send kill
(pid).

Can someone suggest a single line command that will extract the pid of
the process that is actually running mpg123 and ignore the processes
related to finding mpg123 in the output of ps?

Here's what I've tried:

ps -ax | grep mpg123

This returns:

 2365 ?        S      0:01 /usr/bin/mpg123
/home/mp3/Classical/BestOfEliotFisk.m
 2369 ?        S      0:00 sh -c ps -ax | grep mpg123
 2371 ?        S      0:00 grep mpg123

Next, I tried:

ps -ax | grep mpg123 | cut -f1

which returns the same thing:

 2365 ?        S      0:01 /usr/bin/mpg123
/home/mp3/Classical/BestOfEliotFisk.m
 2369 ?        S      0:00 sh -c ps -ax | grep mpg123
 2371 ?        S      0:00 grep mpg123

So then I tried:

ps -ax | grep mpg123 | cut -f1 -d' '

which returns nothing, or maybe it returns a space.

Trying:

ps -ax | grep mpg123 | tr -s ' ' ' ' | cut -f1 -d' '

doesn't change anything.

I use
  pid=`ps -C $target -o pid=`
to get PID of $target in a bash script.

You could try:

ps ax | grep mpg123 | awk '{print $1}'


or to exclude the grep line itself:

ps ax | grep [m]pg123 | awk '{print $1}'


There's a better way to do my second try, but I can't remember it.

M-x replace-regexp

I don't quite parse your description.  It sounds like you are saying
there are single new-lines between paragraphs and double new-lines
between sections.  If so, you'll probably want to replace single
new-lines with double new-lines.  Maybe something like:

  M-x replace-string
  at the "Replace string:' prompt, type C-q C-j
  at the "with:" prompt, type C-q C-j C-q C-j

That will provide the necessary spacing for M-q to do its work.

BTW, I wasn't aware that "english prose" had a standard format, beyond
text-mode, such that a special mode could be designed for it.  You
don't say what you intend to do with the material.  Does it need to go
back into that format before it goes back to your friend?

There is a section in the Gnus info document (well hidden) that
describes the steps to go through.  I'll see if I can dig it up.

Is it Mandrake?  I had a similar problem with Mandrake 8.2
I found that the automounter was calling my cdrom0, cdrom3 and creating a 
link in /dev  from /dev/cdrom to dev/cdroms/cdrom3.  I had to hack around it, 
though perhaps I should have just turned off the automounting.

So, if I put:

exec(ps -C mpg123 -o pid=)

in my php it works.

Both of these work, too.

As does this. This one seems the cleanest, too. As with many things in
Linux, there is often more than one way to get something done.

Thanks to all.

Just let awk do the match:

ps ax| awk '/[m]pg123/ {print $1}'

Trying to rebuild a new, whiz-bang kernel (version 2.4).  I
recompiled the thing and was under the impression that I'd have a
newly compiled kernel named "bzImage" waiting for me
/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot.  It never showed up.  All I have
in there is:  bootsect.S   compressed   install.sh   Makefile

The tools  and compressed are directories, and they don't have my
kernel either.  I didn't get any error messages when I
recompiled, at least not that I can tell.

I don't think there's a 'make bzImage' target for the 2.4 series.  
(Right?) I think you'll end up using the vmlinux in the root of your
build directory.

Here at work we are looking at replacing a real-time
SCADA system which currently runs on Unix.
Unfortunately some non-technical types are pushing for
a windows based system. Some of us REALLY don't like
this idea and need to come up with some ammunition to
defend our position. Can someone please point me to
web sites or other places where I can find info on:
server up-time comparisons, total cost of ownership,
number of support staff required for NT/2000 as
opposed to Unix, and any other information that might
help our cause.
Thanks for your help with this.

You can also do this:

ps -e -o pid -o command | grep -v grep | grep mpg123

Experiment with the `-o' switch; you will find it to be a good switch
for filtering process lines.

The `grep -v grep' part strips out the grep process. Here's an example I
ran using Netscape as an argument for grep without the -v switch:

 628 netscape
 1356 grep netscape

When I added ``grep -v grep,' I get this, the correct answer:

 628 netscape

Here's an addendum to my previous post. The following will strip out the
name of the process leaving only the process number. This is capable of
running in a heterogeneous environment:

ps -e -o pid -o command | grep -v grep | grep mpg123 | awk `{ print $1
}'

Pay special attention to the direction of the ticks.

Subject: [PLUG] SB Audigy Experiences ?
Message-ID: <51AE6EA505FCD111AB5600805F653ACB010AA12C@EXCHANGE>

Don't have an audigy, but I do have an SBLive Platinum.  Works fine (of
course) but I REALLY wish I'd done more research before I bought it, because
there are a ton of cards that would have been better for what I need.

What do you intend to use the card for?  Playing music?  Games?  Do you plan
on using it for any recording or midi work?

The SB Live and Audigy are great for playing music, games, sampling, and
midi.  But not as great for recording.  (Even the Audigy is limited to
recording at 48khz 16bit. Don't be misled by the 24/96 playback specs. :)
I'm currently debating whether to get a Midiman Delta series or bite the
bullet for an RME Multiface.  (Overkill for most, but would have been a
better use of my money in the long run.)

Anyway, I just wanted to point out that if you just need a standard card for
regular things, the SB cards are great.  Get one.  In particular the OEM
version is the best deal.

But... if you intend on doing any recording and are thinking about shelling
out bigger bucks for the Platinum, DON'T.  Look around first, because you'll
get more for your money with something else, like a Midiman or even an
ST-Audio product.  (Most of them have good linux drivers, at least in ALSA.
There are others, too.)

Here's a review I just found, that says it better than I can.

Yes, the bzImage file should be in arch/i386/boot/,
but 'make clean' should remove it too.

Terry,

  I've no idea where you are located, but the Portland "Oregonian" had
another column today by Steve Duin on Microsoft's heavy-handed tactics with
schools across the country. Many systems (including one in Iowa) are saving
hundreds of thousands of dollars by moving to linux from Windows.

  IDG's linux report had a link to an article on the increasing costs of
Microsoft licenses. They say it will only get worse.

  Uptime and stability ought to be secondary issues; they are probably not
as intuitively important to digitally impaired decision makers. Talk about
the cost of purchase -- er, annual rent -- and the costs of lost time and
productivity caused by Microsoft virii and worms. One of the articles I
scanned this week had a rough total cost of ownership comparison that was
greater than 50%.

Good luck,

Rich

For some reason, that doesn't work on my system. It's a minor variant on
one of the things I mention in my original post. I just had the -f1
before the -d' '. I tried your version just now, but all I get back is a
blank line. Not sure if I'm getting an empty line or a space on a line,
but it's not the pid.

Interesting. I probably heard that in a class last year, but since I
haven't had a reason to use it have forgotten it. Thanks.

On my RH 7.0 system it's in /sbin. That's the solution I'm using for my

When I bought this system a few months ago, the plan was to include a 
high-end card tbd.  As time went by, money dwindled, and I've had no 
luck getting the on-board sound working.  Been using a cheaper SB in 
the mp3 fileserver, but a PII-333 takes forever to rip a 2Gb wav 
(24hrs, to be precise).  The new system did the same job in 2hrs.

Right now, all I am doing is occasional recording of radio broadcasts, 
which is fairly lo-fi.  I don't need mic pre-amps either (a Mackie 
mixer does that very well.)  Soon will be transferring lps to cd so 
recording fidelity is ultimately important.

I know the Live! card has been out for awhile and is fairly well 
supported, and the oem price may be enough to tempt me until more 
money shows up.

Cheers,
Kyle

good condition for prices ranging from free to $10.  I got 10 free desktop

Yup. We heard about this problem this morning from our security dude... he
said there were over 10000 scans to port 1433 this morning. Glad all our sa
passwords exist. The "exciting" thing is that SQL by default is installed
with NO PASSWORD so you have to remember to create one! Can you say security

  I've not seen this in /var/log/messages, but I had a run on another
Microsoft worm over the weekend and yesterday (must have been a 3-day sale).
No message body, different subjects, but each had both audio and video
attachments that I couldn't even save to disk. Probably Microsoft
executables that just ran without being saved.

Also, though I haven't used it, there is something the FAQ points at

In response to your post I downloaded and started playing around with
it.  It does come up quite fast, but it cored on me when I tried to
visit http://java.sun.com.  Before that, I pointed it to slashdot, and
it seemed to render it OK.

It seems nice, fast and light.  I have version 0.6.  I may have to

Subject: [PLUG] Iptraf on my gateway is showing port 137 and 139 traffic across extrenal
 interface...
Message-ID: <3CEAB99E.A01FBB0E@opusnet.com>

Michael Robinson

Isn't that Windows networking which shouldn't cross?  The /etc/services
file lists it as netbios-ns and netbios-dg.  Samba is installed on the
machine which probably requires netbios, but I
don't think there is any service loss if Windows networking stops at the
gateway box.  How do I modify my ipchains scripts on this Redhat 6.2
server to stop Windows networking from
extending out onto the Internet through masquerading, output chain, or
however else it's getting out?

Second question, how do I get ip accounting for kernels from
www.kernel.org, it seems to be missing from source trees gathered from
that source.  Is there a patch?

Third question, what can I remove from the default upgraded version of
Apache from Redhat direct for 6.2 if I am only needing it to support
horde webmail imp ?  What's security concerns are there with the
upgraded release ?   I wanted to install squirrelmail but couldn't
because that requires upgrading shared libraries and I am uncertain how
to do that let alone back up if it broke
things.

If anyone is familiar with Securing and Optimizing Redhat Linux v1.3
Final Mail_Server_Firewall unmodified how do I modify it to allow the
use of samba on the mail box to allow file shares for network backup
without allowing dangerous access to the internals of that server such
as the mailspool, root filesystem, etc ?  I'd like to be able to create
a mirror image of an OS installation and shove it out to the mail server
for later retrieval...  it would be cool to have an OS generic bootdisk
to do unattended restore from implementing something like RAID except
with the partitions on two different machines on a local network.  I
also want to have a seperate shares for temporary data backups where one
would burn them to a cd.  Does anyone know a way to burn directly from a
samba exported filesystem under Windows, I tried it ( even slowed the
write speed to 1x under easy cd-cdreator ) but access stopped and the
burn failed.  It would be really nice to not have to copy a file locally
to burn it.  My Windows system is 98SE and another person uses a 2000
system as well that also has a burner.  What would be ideal would be a
GPL replacement for Windows 98SE's networking code that implements  the
functionality well enough to fool any standard 98SE box without the
bugs.

Fourth question:  Samba problem, it works great as long as I'm using
Windows...  When I try to access samba fileshares from Linux I have to
mount them as root and all the files belong to root.
This doesn't work when the desire is to use the network filesystem
transparently as an extension of one's drive space.  How do I get a
samba mount under Linux where local workstation user owns the network
mounted directory even if NIS is not used ?  How do I fix samba mounting
so that I don't have to be root ?  If I have to use NIS to synchonize
permissions on files and ownership could someone point me to a good
resource, I have to be careful implementing NFS and NIS on a gateway
machine, these are network protocols that I think samba is supposed to
replace.

Fifth question:  I get a lot of what look like RIP packets from the ISP
opus where the servers they run are NT servers of some kind, aren't
these eating bandwidth and should I have a routing
protocol installed to answer them?  We are bridged static ip DSL
customers set up on the robinson-west.com domain.

Since I'm not subscribed to the plug list because the volume overwhelms
my only Internet visible private email account from Opus please send
response to: robinsom at opusnet.com.
Soon as I fix our Linux mail server and have filtering in place to
combat spam, I'll of course resubscribe to the list.

There's probably other reasons as well, but IE is partially loaded all the 
time Windows is running. Since IE uses many of the same dlls that Explorer 
(the windows window manager) uses, it doesn't have to load everything from 
disk, much of it is already in memory.

Assuming you are talking about Mozilla on Windoze, I can think of a
couple of reasons.  Internet Explorer is integrated with Winschmoes
(although you will never convince it is inextricably so), and it is
designed to run only on Winblows.

Mozilla, on the other hand, uses a widget framework (the name eludes
me) that is designed more for cross-platform compatibility than
performance.

In other words, IE sacrifices cross-platform compatibility for speed,
and Mozilla vice-versa, although it has improved performance by leaps
and bounds.

I think you should be able to do something like this.

Which would work ... unless you don't care if string1 comes before
_or_ _after_ the others.  That would make the necessary regexp a bit
hairier.

My guess:  because MS Internet Explorer is tightly integrated with the core,
there are probably dll's or something similar resident in memory whenever
you use it, thus not requiring them to be loaded.

I once freaked out a girlfriend with this integration.  Netscape kept
crashing, but she insisted that she didn't have IE on her computer.  I
opened up Windows Explorer, typed in the URL for Yahoo!, et voila!, it
morphed into IE.

Dhruva,

  Since it doesn't yet support frames or java I'm not surprised it floated
to the surface on the Sun site.

  Thanks for the input.

That is exactly it. Basically, when you start Windows, 80% of IE is
already loaded -- everything except the executable. That's why Mozilla
gives the option of "partially" loading on login: so that it can load as
fast on-demand as IE does.

Either pidof or pgrep will do what you'd like, but the CLEANEST way to
handle this sort of thing is to capture the pid when you exec mpg123 in
the first place and store it for later use.

Another point: Windows' kernel prioritizes graphics rendering over all 
other processes so that it *appears* to be faster and more responsive than 
other OS's that give low-level and background processes higher priority 
for the CPU.

Russell's note on whether or not string1 should come before, after, or
either is important when designing a SINGLE regexp to match this.

Yes.

There's probably also a BEST way, but the BETTER way that leaps
immediately to mind is:

grep string1 logfile|grep "string2|string3"

That way, you're not doing the OR for every line when you are going to
discard the ones that don't match string1 anyway.  Of course, I can
imagine that with a very complext string1, you'll get better performance
the other way.  So yymv, I suppose.

Actually you can. But.......
You have to have adobe creator as well as the reader. 
I don't know if its available for linux. Creator lets you edit, print, and

Changes can then be done on the ps file in a text editor :-)

I don't see anything in such documentation as I have that tells me how
either exec or mpg123 would return the pid. At this point, I redirect
output of mpg123 to /dev/null so that php can continue loading the page.
If I don't, php waits until the mp3 file has finished playing before
continuing to load the page.

But, since this whole thing is intended to be a learning experience
(along with providing a way to send mp3 music to my stereo), how would I
capture the pid when I exec mpg123?

Quite. :)

An SBLive is probably just fine for that... considering that it a one-time
transfer of an existing recording (rather than a live source that is going
to see a lot of manipulation).  An Audigy wouldn't buy you any benefit over
the Live for that, really.  But the SBLive would do the trick.  If you add
better interface later, it can still do midi/sampling duty.  (And system
sounds, and games and whatever else the pro card won't do.)

They ARE fairly cheap (<$40), and if you record at 16/48 it isn't that bad,
quality wise. That's what I've been using so far, and it's fine for that.  I
wish I'd gone OEM instead of the Platinum, though. It's not worth the extra
dough.  (BTW the advertised "24/96 DAC performance" of the Audigy drives me
nuts... it's DA only! Not AD! Just a tad misleading!)

To upgrade from that level takes semi-pro gear and can cost a pretty penny.
(Though some are actually less than the Platinum versions of SB stuff.)
Here's a few I know off the top of my head, to give an idea of the market,
from entry to pro-level.  (Prices pulled from bayviewproaudio.com)  Hope
this isn't overkill or OT, but I've been looking at this stuff a LOT just
the last few weeks.

I'm listing mainly 3 brands because I've looked into them before and they
have linux drivers.  (Many pro/semi-pro cards don't.)  ST Audio is the
cheapest, but not as good sound quality as the others.  RME is pretty
serious high-end gear.  M-Audio is a nice in-between.  Both M-Audio and RME
alsa appear to be pretty supportive of linux drivers, and advertise (and
link to ALSA) from their websites.


16/48 Stereo (SB's weren't listed at bayview.  Prices from bestbuy.com...
could do much better.)
-----------------------
$70	SB Live
$100	SB Audigy
$200	SB Audigy Platinum


24/96 Stereo
-----------------------
$175	ST Audio DSP24 Value
$179	M-Audio Audiophile 2496
$189	TerraTec EWX 24/96


24/96 Multiple Channel
-------------------------
$199  Midiman Delta 410 (4in/10out - sortof... 2 analog inputs, 2 digital)
$229	ST Audio DSP24 MKII (2in/out - upgradeable, see below)
$229	Midiman Delta 44 (4in/4out - all analog on breakout box)
$289	ST Audio DS2000 (8in/out breakout box - requires DSP24 MKII)
$299	Midiman Delta 66 (6in/out - 4 analog on same breakout box as 44, 2
digital)
$379	Midiman Delta 1010LT (10in/out - 8 analog)
$439	ST Audio DSP2000 CPort (8in/out - DSP24 + DS2000)
$599	Midiman Delta 1010 (10in/out - 8 analog all on 19" rackmount
breakout).
  |-- I see these brand new from Ebay retailers for $500-520 all the time.
$260	RME Hammerfall DSP Interface (PCI card, requires Multiface or
Digiface)
$315	RME Hammerfall DSP Interface (Cardbus for laptops, requires
Multiface or Digiface)
$575	RME Digiface (3 ADAT, 1 SPDIF on breakout - requires PCI or Cardbus
interface)
$725	RME Multiface (8in/out analog, 1 ADAT, 1 SPDIF on breakout -
requires PCI or Cardbus interface)
$985	RME Multiface Package (Multiface + Hammerfall DSP - PCI version)

... and up.  (Say, a complete RME Digiface system plus $thousands for
standalone AD/DA converters or a digital mixer, and so on.  If you're at
this level you're probably spending more than that on fancy microphones and
preamps anyway! :)

rmmod e100 (If you network module is e100)

Of course doing this while using the card is not a good

I guess I should have pointed out that this particular system uses

Message-ID: <20020522020258.92368.qmail@web14405.mail.yahoo.com>

Help! I'm having a hard time grasping regular expressions.

Given an example like this:

(^|)(one|two|three|four)?

"one" is not a match, but "one two" or "three four" are.

Why does it only match 2 or more combinations of the second atom?

The way I read it, the first atom translates as:

Null character representing the beginning of a string (Where the
following word in the next atom would count as 1 string) and/or null

The second atom translates simply as:

string "one" and/or string "two" and/or string "three" and/or string
"four" with a modifier meaning return true only if zero or one
matches .

And how would I get it to match only 3 or more combinations?

I'm trying for a plain english translation so my poor old brain can
understand the logic behind the madness...or should I reverse that
last statement? AHHG!

The cheapest I know of is Thawte at about $100.00 a year.
They are now owned by Verisign, so if someone insists on

Subject: [PLUG] No system.map?
Message-ID: <3CEB0135.80102@involved.com>

Hi All,

I just got adventurous and complied the 2.4.18 kernel. Everything 
seemed to go well, but I don't have a system.map file in 
/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot
isn't this where system.map is suppose to be, or did I forget a set?

Here's the steps I followed:
# make mrproper
# make config (for some reason it says I don't have Ncurses installed, 
I think I do)
# make dep
# make clean
# make bzImage
# make modules
# make modules_install

zImage is in the proper directory, but system.map isn't there. The 
directions I followed are at 
http://jgo.local.net/LinuxGuide/linux-kernel.html
and don't mention system.map, but the last time I complied a kernel 
(2.2.something) the new kernel wouldn't boot without the new system.map.

Any clues on what I did?

Thanks,
Kyle

We are currently using Thawte on our web site.  The
set up was pretty easy, their live web based customer
support was very helpful (once found, kind of hard to
find on their web page).

But I do think I saw an ad on Netcraft or somewhere
else for a cheaper service offered by a company in
England.

In a shell $! is the PID of the last backgrounded process.
So a shell script wrapper that background mpg123 and saves $! might
work.

example:
#!/bin/bash

mpg123 $* &
echo $!

It's probably right where it should be in the root of the source tree.

Is there a reason you're hand installing instead of using make install?

What regex engine did you use for testing? Perl? sed? [e]grep? In
Perl, that regex would match any single string or line in a file; same
with egrep and sed, though the latter wouldn't be able to comprehend
it unless you escaped the metacharacters.

In every case, it should match the beginning of the line/string. Since 
the second group is entirely optional -- and since you don't rule out 
duplicate strings by anchoring the end of the string -- there are no 
disqualifying strings.

Can you post the file/stdin that you passed to the regex engine and 
the exact invocation of the utility you used to match it?

Help me understand what you are saying.  How is a capture from an lp 
less subject to post-processing than a live signal?  I'm likely to 
manipulate either depending on need: de-pop, reverb, etc.  Which, as 
far as I know, is done in software and with no regard to the 
soundcard's capabilities, no?  (or are you talking about bouncing to 
out-board effects processors?)

What about pro-level cards makes them unsuitable for gaming?  I'm not 
a gamer and don't follow the hardware that closely.  Is it because pro 
cards forego the 5.1 stuff and only provide stereo out?

That's good to know.  I should've mentioned that I've been meaning to 
construct a hard-disk recorder system for years.

Not overkill or OT.  This is the sort of stuff I've been looking for. 
  I do have a few pretty pennies, but they are only pennies...  I did 
build a system for a friend a while back using the SB Live! Platinum. 
  It is nice to have the drive bay jack panel, but for what he needs 
(mic in), that could have been accomplished for a lot less.  For Linux 
users, the oem offering is the way to go; otherwise you're paying for 
software you can't use or gimicky hardware extensions.

Thanks for the list.  If you don't mind, what means Multiface & 
Digiface?  (Software, hardware?)

Even considering the current recession, which is perhaps at its worst in
the IT field, I still see (just as an example) a lot of kids buying PS2

There will surely still be the need for a lot of custom and other

Thank the GPL.  Folks at big companies that adopt GNU/Linux have a 
legal obligation (and most of them know it) to contribute back.  They 
pay good money for  highly-skilled (and some not-so-skilled) 
programmers to develop products that make use of OSS.

The big companies that "get it" use this to leverage hipness, not to 
mention shareholder-happiness.  Some lawyers are not so comfortable 
with the GPL and if they work for a large enough company, create 
variations of the license which are generally acceptable.

Considering the alternatives, OSS is an automatic win for many 
companies.  Bottom line: they need people that know Linux.

Does anyone know of a way to install OpenOffice (or StarOffice - from
now on i'll just say OpenOffice, but this applies to both) on a computer
in such a way that all users automatically have icons in their menu's
which will open the program (and preferably so the 2 MB ~/OpenOffice
directory from "Workstation Install" is not needed)?

This is for school computers, which have lots of users (who are K-8) -
so having each user run the install is out of the question IMHO. 


I thought about just doing the "workstation install" for one user and
then moving the ~/OpenOffice directory which was created to say, /opt/,
and then making a symlink from each users ~/OpenOffice/ to
/opt/OpenOffice/, but it seems that the username is repeated quite often
in files within ~/OpenOffice.  And it seems that OpenOffice checks for
~/OpenOffice and starts the installer if that directory isn't found.

Any ideas on this?


Thanks, 

~Peter

This recipe won't show dotfiles (e.g., .mozilla or .kde) unless you 
also pass the '-a' option to ls.

This one only works if the '-F' option is passed to ls somehow (i.e.,
in an alias).

Or you could use find, which arguably is more suited to this sort of 
task. All of the recipes below could also be piped into less:

# show the names of directories occuring in the current directory
find . -type d -maxdepth 1
# show 'ls -l' info about them
find . -type d -maxdepth 1 -exec ls -ld {} \;
# find all directories in current directory or below
find . -type d
# show 'ls -l' info about all of 'em
find . -type d -exec ls -ld {} \;

Figure out what OpenOffice installs.   Then copy all that to the /etc/skel.

When a new account is made this is the stuff that is copied into the new home 
directory.

  I'll tell you what I did here and you can decide if it will work for you.

  I installed OO-1.0.1 in an nfs-shared filesystem, /usr1/. The installation
routine (I *think* it was workstation that I selected) placed the startup
script in:

/usr1/open-office/OpenOffice.org1.0/program/soffice

  Then I created a soft link on each workstation that pointed to this file;
e.g.,

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ ls -l /usr/local/bin/soffice 
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           51 May  8 18:14 /usr/local/bin/soffice ->
/usr1/open-office/OpenOffice.org1.0/program/soffice*

  Finally, I pointed the appropriate icon for each user's copy of xfce to
'soffice'. Because /usr/local/bin/ is in each user's $PATH, it's found and
another instance of OO is opened.

  I've no idea if this is the "right" way, the "best" way or anything other
than it works. And, I have OO in a single directory where upgrades will be
easy to manage.

HTH,

Rich

After OpenOffice has been installed, it is possible for other users to 
install the necessary files in their home directory by running the 
"soffice" shell script. Users only need to do a "Workstation 
Installation" which installs something like 2.1 MB worth of files to 
their home directory. You don't want them doing a local install since 
that takes something like 210MB of disk space. 

As far as I can tell, the OpenOffice installation program only runs from 
the "soffice" command if no "OpenOffice.org1.0 directory is found 
within a user's home directory.

If only Windows people knew what was *possible* on a Linux machine.
Leaves you free as a bird. If only they knew what I would have
sacrificed by keeping Windows XP and not installing Linux (Klez.h??? -
it goes into the bit bucket, every time, for example). Or the Canadian
software developer who sshed and scped right onto my notebook out of
Canada 2 days ago, to re-install my modem software). Magic.

I think it's a case of poor wording. I'm certain the intent is to have you
select either single CPU or multiple CPUs by deselecting or selecting
"Symmetric multi-processing support" in the ``Processor type and features''
section.

  I think I did a network installation. IIRC, when each user first invoked
the OO hieroglyphic on the desktop it launced an "installation" routine.
Exactly what it did I don't know, but it all works -- well, as well as it
can work, eh? :-)

I'd like to thank everyone who responded for their
helpful comments. My HP7950 has two optical drives, as
many newer computers do. When I checked /etc/fstab, it
became evident that the DVD drive was linked to
/dev/cdrom, and the CD-RW did not appear at all. When
I placed a disk in the tray of the CD-RW, the computer
didn't find anything there because it was looking in
the other tray.

It is possible to use the CD-RW for conventional
reads, although it is unnecessary to do so, by
referencing it by its real name:

mount -t iso9660 /dev/sr0 /mnt/cdrom

assuming, of course, that the DVD drive is not mounted
there already!

The construction of the fstab file seems to be
somewhat capricious, varying from one distribution to
the next. It is a good idea to examine it carefully.

I have a Penguin Computing system with an AIC 796 SCSI BIOS v2.20S1B1 
Adaptec AIC7XX EISA/VLB/ card.

Redhat 7.3 installs fine, but doesn't run after install. I get the 
following error:

kmod: failed to exec /sbin/modprobe -s -k scsi _hostadapter, errno =2

I see the module I think is the driver for the card loaded. Is this a 
problem where I need the scsi module built into the kernel (i.e. not as a 
module)?

If that's the case, how would I go about doing that, when the system won't 
boot after install?

Thanks in advance!

Never test for an error condition you don't know how to handle.

be exactly what I see from the production Mandrake 8.1 servers using

(^|[-.\?+=/_0-9])(four|five|six)?(seven|eight|nine?|ten|el?ven)s?(twelve|thirteen|fourteen)?([-.\?+=/_0-9]|$)

Sample input:
http://groups.google.com/groups?q=one+two+three&ie=UTF8&oe=UTF8&hl=en&btnG=Google+Search
http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF8&oe=UTF8&q=nineteen+ten+eleven&btnG=Google+Search
http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF8&oe=UTF8&q=one+ten+twelve&btnG=Google+Search

Observed behavior:
A URL with any single pattern matching the first line will always
match.
A URL with any two matches from seven through el?ven on the second
line will always match.
Four through six don't seem to match anything.
Twelve through fourteen I have not verified as matching anything
either.

Hmm, I always thought it was sorta silly, because I'm NOT on there. I've 
been around the net, with my picture published in various locations for at 
least 10 years, and none of the 13 pages that come up with my name have a 
picture of me. I also search for my alias, and get zero hits. At the same 
time, the baseball player and The Professor from Gilligan's Island come up. 
Yes, the professors real-life name is Russell Johnson. :) His characters 
name was Roy "The Professor" Hinkley Jr., Ph.D.

On the other hand, you can find a zillion hits if you search for my 
symantec.com email address on groups.google.com.

You know, I saw this error message on a 7.3-installed kernel myself, but
it boots just fine.  I haven't been following the valhalla-list enough
to know if this is common or not.  Few if any modules actually need to
be built into the kernel to work, so I doubt it.  If you see that it
loads and initializes the SCSI controller, then that's likely not your
problem.  Is that the last kernel message you see?

I don't use RedHat but I believe that scsi_hostadapter is an alias in 
the /etc/modules.conf file. 

The first thing I notice is that you have "scsi _hostadapter". Did you 
type the error message into your email or did your cut and paste it? 
The correct name is "scsi_hostadapter with no space between "scsi" and 
the underscore. If you did cut and paste then it appears that perhaps 
the alias name is wrong in the /etc/modules.conf file. Remove the extra 
space and then run "depmod -a" to update the modules.dep file.

Another possible fix:

If you find that the AIC7xxx kernel module is being loaded correctly, 
try adding the following line in your /etc/modules.conf file:

alias scsi_hostadapter off

Once you've updated the /etc/modules.conf file run the command:
"depmod -a". Note that you'll need to be logged in as "root" to perform 
both of these steps. By aliasing the scsi_hostadapter to be off kmod 
will not attempt to load the module and the error will go away. I have 
this alias line in my /etc/modules.conf file and my system still 
manages to load the AIC7xxx module for my Adaptec controller.

With all the reports of that SQL Server script the kiddiez are using 
these days -- and the continued Code Red scans that hit my box -- I'd 
thought I'd whip up a couple little tools to give me some stats.

1. Produce list of all hosts that send me packets I don't want, sorted 
   by frequency of unwanted packets, useful for spotting the worst 
   individual hosts:

   #!/bin/sh

   grep 'SRC=' /var/log/messages* | \
   sed 's!.*SRC=\(.*\) DST=.*!\1!' | \
   sort | \
   uniq -c | \
   sort -nr

2. Same list, sorted by ip address, useful to see if certain nets are 
   esp. bad:

   #!/bin/sh

   grep 'SRC=' /var/log/messages* | \
   sed 's!.*SRC=\(.*\) DST=.*!\1!' | \
   sort  -n -t. -k 1,1 -k 2,2 -k 3,3 -k 4,4 | \
   uniq -c

3. Sorta sorted list of those hosts, this time with per-port 
   statistics, useful for spotting scans. Run this perl script against 
   /var/log/messages*:

   #!/usr/bin/perl -w

   while ( <> ) {
     my ( $host, $port ) = /^.+ SRC=([^\s]+) DST=.+ DPT=(\d+) \w.*$/;
     next unless $host and $port;
     $list{$host}{$port}++;
   }

   foreach my $host ( sort keys %list ) {
     print qq/$host: /;
     print join( ', ', map { "$_ ($list{$host}{$_})" }
                           sort keys %{ $list{$host} }
           );
     print "\n";
   }

  When I tried this, the local mailer-daemon rejects the message (the

don't understand why I get this bounce.

  The bounced mail starts:

Looks to me like qwest added you to their local rejection list. salmo is 
unable to establish a connection, so it's letting you know.

The usual default in bash is that "*" does not match on file names with
a leading ".", you have to play with the settings of "dotglob" and "GLOBIGNORE"
in your shell environment to change this behaviour.  I prefer a different
approach to this problem:

   find . -maxdepth 1 -type d

and if you want something similar to the "ls -l" output, the "-ls" option to
find will give a somewhat more verbose version of it, or alternatively,
the "-printf" options used with it's format modifiers can be used to give
exactly the output you want without spawning a bunch of sub-processes or
playing with regular expressions.

I don't know what sort of setup you have Rich so this may not help you 
at all...

Does the system "salmo" have a public DNS entry? It may be that Qwest 
considers the message to be from an unknown host or domain and rejects 
it as spam. I remember going through something similar with rejected 
emails with sendmail long ago. 

At the time my system's sendmail process couldn't send anything directly 
to some other domain since my local system, which was on a dialup PPP 
connection, didn't have any sort of public hostname and domain 
available via DNS. In the end I had to setup my sendmail configuration 
so my local sendmail process would relay through my ISP's mail server. 
This fixed my problem since my ISP's mail server recognized my system 
and my ISP's mail server was publicly recognized.

  That could be, Russ, we're Verizon customers. :-)

  Anyway, I suspected it was trapped by either headers_check or body_check.
So I tested my theory (as all good scientists do). Commented out the calls
to those two files and reloaded postfix. The spam reports went out (one to
qwest, the other a new and also bounced spam to icgcom.com).

  Which modifies my first question to this: if the subject or body content
was identified as spam as I tried to report the spam, why wasn't it caught
on its way in? I suspect this has to do with the sequence of checks in
/etc/postfix/main.cf:

smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
        check_client_access hash:/etc/postfix/badip,
        check_client_access hash:/etc/postfix/badaddr,
        permit_mynetworks,
        check_relay_domains
#header_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/header_checks
#body_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/body_checks

  As a tyro mail administrator I may be clueless how to get all the checks
and traps to work properly.

Thanks,

For one thing, you should move permit_mynetworks above the
check_client_access lines.  None of your outgoing mail will ever be
caught by them then, and you can selectively allow mail in from
RBL-listed hosts (if you're using something like ORDB).  

Perhaps it was missed on the way in because you've got something in
body_checks that wasn't in header_checks; when you forwarded the message
(with full headers, I hope), you moved something from headers to body.

  Yes, it does. The primary MX points here and the A record points to our

  Long ago, I inadvertently was sending outbound mail through our ISP. When
I learned of this I fixed it so sendmail went directly out. Now, postfix
does, too. I've not yet set up our own DNS server, but that's on my list of
things to do.

  It's got something to do with the sequence of spam checks in main.cf. When
I comment out header_ and body_checks, the mail goes out. When I don't
comment them out, it bounces. Ergo, it should be fixable. But, I don't know
how to fix it.

Subject: [PLUG] evolution configuration q's
Message-ID: <1022096015.2481.27.camel@mikado>

Hi All,

I've got a couple quick questions about Evolution I'm hoping someone
here knows the answers to. 

First, my environment:
 - Mandrake 8.2
 - Using Postfix to deliver to ~user/Maildir/
 - Running Evolution on top of Enlightenment

Now, the issues:
First: When I set up Evolution, I gave it the full path to my Maildir. 
It retieves the mail OK, but created a separate mailbox for it... the
mail isn't going into the Inbox.  That's an issue b/c I'd like to
automatically apply filters to sort the mail and those only seem to
apply when e-mail hits the default Inbox.

It ocurred to me to symlink ~user/Maildir/ to
~user/evolution/local/Inbox or to set up Postfix to deliver to
~user/evolution/local/Inbox, but it also seems like I must be missing
something if these are the best answers I can come up with.

Also in Evolution, does anyone know how to change the browser that's
called by hyperlinks?  I'm running Opera, and Evolution seems to
expect/demand Mozilla.  My apologies in advance if either of these
questions is covered by the Evolution help or FAQ functions... accessing
either of these resources also seem to depend on the user running
Mozilla.

Thanks in advance for any pointers,

Dylan

  Thanks, Wil. I wondered about this but neither the Postfix book nor docs I
found had anything specific about this. I did learn from Ed to put
check_relay_domains last. :-)

  Excellent! Of course what was "headers" in the incoming message becomes
"body" in the outgoing message. Could be.

  Getting postfix running initially was relatively simple. Tuning it to run
properly is like turning an old car into a race-winning performer. Careful
attention to fine-tuning details is required in every component.

  I've made the change and we'll see what happens now. :-)

Again, thanks,

  Has anyone here used a w2k-word template, particularly in

  The OO docs on line have nothing about working with templates. I suppose

  Yes, it's the Blum book. Only one out, AFAIK.

  I caught the small print at Powell's Tech Books: "For Intermediate and
Advanced Users" so I expected that. It's actually for beginners and you can
totally skip the first chapter ("What is electronic mail?") and go on from
there. That said, I find it a useful reference.

  There were aspects of setting up postfix and majordomo that were well
explained in the book and either cryptic or missing in the application docs.
So, all in all it was a good investment that saved me a lot of time. I still
refer to it for reminders of how to do things.

YMMV,

Rich

If you are running GNOME, try going to:
Settings > Document Handlers > Default Applications 
and in there go to the "Web Browser" tab and it lets you tell it which
browser to use as the default GNOME one (which i think is what Evolution
uses).  If you for some reason don't have that menu or something, the
actual program that it runs is "default-application-properties-capplet".

(And hopefully a REAL audio person or DSP programmer doesn't scream at me if

Well, I was going under the assumption (whoops) that you wouldn't be doing
much post-processing.  Pulling out clicks and pops isn't much, because it
isn't really altering the overall signal... that's basically just trimmming
out spikes and peaks in the waveform.  But reverb definitely changes the
signal, and uses lots of heavy math.  (As do most effects: chorus,
compression, distortion, phasing/filters, eq, etc.)  I guess it sort of
depends on what you want the recording for.


CASE 1:  You want to archive your albums or do a somewhat permanent transfer
to CD.

I would definitely de-pop, but consider skipping the reverb or anything
else.  At least for one master copy of each.  Why?

1.  That part is going to take a loooong time.  You won't want to have to do
it again if you change your mind. :)  If you make a clean master, you can
use it the same way any other CD.  (Rip to disk, add effects, convert to mp3
or burn a copy for listening, etc.  If you change your mind, you just work
with the master again, without waiting 1hour or so for another A/D
conversion.

2.  CDR's are dirt cheap.  Make clean masters, and just keep them stored
with the albums.

3.  Different sound systems (everything in consumer range) can sound WAY
different from each other.  Be aware of that, and careful when deciding to
"remaster" anything unless you have flat-response speakers or studio
monitors to eliminate that possibility.  (I guarantee the person who
mastered it originally did, and they aren't cheap.)  You can play around all
you want with copies, and have something to fall back on when the mix that
sounds beatiful on the computer (and maybe even the home stereo) sounds like
crap in your car.  Or your friend's house.

--This whole part (3) maybe isn't quite as important for your album
transfers... but it is extremely important when you start doing any
hard-disk recording.  Just a heads up, there.  You CAN do it without real
monitors (sortof) but it is hard.  You need a ton of practice in recognizing
the way your own "monitors" color the sound, which means taking a mix you've
made and trying it out in everthing else you can get your hands on and
noting the differences.  In fact even engineers with real monitors sometimes
do the same thing with other monitors and even consumer systems just to make
sure. :)


CASE 2:  You're not that interested in archival/permanent transfer/high
quality for your album transfer.  You just want a darned copy on CD that
sounds good on your equipment (really all most people want).

Rip away, and don't worry about any of that crap I just went on about!  An
exccelent program for doing exactly that (ripping lp albums to disk) in
linux is gramofile.  It'll record and automatically split tracks out and can
do filtering to get rid of pops and hiss.  (Works good on tapes, too.)  The
only possible drawback is that it is limited to 16 bit recording.  (But not
a big deal if all you're not doing any effects or other processing.)  I'm
not sure if it can do higher than 44.1KHz, either... which would be
preferrable on an SBLive or Audigy card.  (For 44.1 the chip actually
captures at 48, but it gets dithered down to 44.1 INSIDE the card before the
OS gets it.  It's a much better idea to just grab it at 48 if possible, then
let your software/CPU render it down to 44.1 when you need to.)



Now, for what the soundcard capabilities have to do with it:

Basically, any change you make to a waveform in software introduces rounding
errors.  You can only be so precise when trying to represent curves, and
mathmatically altering them in ways that simulate the effects of analog
equipment.  So the higher the resolution, the more precise the calculation,
the less effect the rounding errors will have on the result.  The more
changes you plan on introducing in software to a sound file, the higher
resolution you want to work with.  (In order to carry out the math as
accurately as possible with the least rounding errors and whatnot.)  Sort of
the same way a graphics person will work with extremely high resolutions for
an original piece, and only render down a copy at the intended "published
size" when finished.  (TIFF vs. JPG for example.)

In essence, if you understand the difference in the abilities of scanners
(16bit/480x600 vs. 42bit/1600x3200 or whatever) and why you want the latter
(even if the end result is supposed to be 16bit/480x600)... then you've got
it.

The reason live recording is much more intensive (and A/D sample quality is
more critical) is that you are trying to produce an actual original master
of the highest quality possible.  (In the case of an lp, that was already
done by the studio.  Which was used to mass produce copies for sale.)  But
there's a catch... at the same time you may be doing TONS of manipulation to
try to create it.  Potentially introducing those rounding errors at ever
iteration.  An extremely over-simplified example:

1.  Scanning in lots of original copies
	(miked individual drums, vocals, horns, amp speakers, room;
direct-in keys, bass, samples)
2.  Altering some or all of them individually in various ways
	(reverb, eq, comp)
3.  Mixing some of them together into submixes
	(drumkit, non-solo horns, bg vocals)
4.  Altering some or all submixes individually in various ways
	(reverb, eq, comp)
5.  Mixing submixes and single tracks into a final mix.
	(self-exp)
6.  Altering the final mix in various ways
	(eq, comp)

So by the time you reach the end, not a single part has gone through
untweaked.  And the majority have gone through a lot more than that.

I'll try to represent it in a psuedo formula of sorts... lets say the
original sound quality = 1 (perfect) and each digital tweak (DSP, not
copying) degrades the original signal by a factor of the sample quality.
And our sample quality is 2.  And the whole shebang is multiplied by how
many tracks we're starting out with.

Now take 2 guitars, 1 bass, 1 lead vocal, 2 background vocals, 1 keyboard,
and 4 mikes on a drumkit (bass, snare/hihat, and two overheads for
toms/cymbals) for a total of 11 tracks.  Go through the process exactly as
described so that each track has been tweaked 3 times. 

The end quality is 66 (2cubed x 11tracks) it in comparison to hearing it
live in the studio (1).  Add another tweak to each and you're at 176.  An
untweaked 2track (stereo) recording off an lp once has a much better score:
4. (The original sample quality of 2, by 2 tracks.  Tweak it once, and have
4x2 and a score of 8.  Still a lot better than 66.)  Also notice that by
increasing the quality of the sample (approaching a factor of "1") that the
scores get way better.


Note, that whole excercise was for pure comparitive purposes and has no
basis in real numbers or math!  :)

(I'm also completely ignoring that even with correct math it is still wrong
because the effect on a single track is going to be different than the same
track within a submix, and again within a stereo mix.)

Something like that.  At least under windows.  Pro cards will have different
sorts of drivers, and may not provide the ability to do regular system
functions.  In linux (ALSA) this is probably a little different.  I don't
know many details here, but know it can be an issue.  Maybe this is the next
thing I should look into. :)  I believe some can and some can't in windows.
I'm curious now, and thinking it might not matter at all with ALSA.  Now I
wanna know.

But maybe it's sort of like comparing a pure 8-track (no mixer) tape to a
stereo tape deck.

 - Channels don't line up (heads and track alignment, channels to channels)
 - Different bandwidth (1" to 1/4" width, 24 bit to 16)
 - Different speed (5 inches per second to 1, 96KHz to 44.1KHz.)

Or something like that.

Yeah... I rarely ever use it.  If I didn't have a mixing console, I might
more, but not sure how much.  I thought I would.  Oh, well. :)

And the software, that reminds me... when I decided to start trying to
record digital (instead of the old trusty 4-track) I built a Win2K drive
(ick) for my main machine to try out the copy of Cubasis that came with it.
(No previous experience with this type of software, and SLab left me stumped
on where to start.  And Aurdor isn't near done.  Time to learn on windows,
and move back later. :)  Anyway after all that time, turns out that it isn't
even a real version of Cubasis.  Not supported by Steinberg OR Creative
Labs.  It wouldn't install on Win2K and they refused to replace it with
something that would.  (The box never said anything about being compatible
with it either.)

I was pretty ticked.  Till I found N-Track, which is free to try (has some
limitations but is still totally usable) and $40 to buy.  I bought it.
It'll do just fine till Aurdor is finished, or I try to learn SLab.  (I
actually just found out that someone has N-Track working under wine, too.
So I might look into that.  Though I have found out how nice Cygwin is to
have on windows. :)

> Thanks for the list.  If you don't mind, what means Multiface & 
> Digiface?  (Software, hardware?)

They are both breakout boxes that are part of the RME Hammerfall DSP system.
A working system consists of an interface card (PCI or Cardbus) connected to
one of these breakout boxes.  (I'm unsure whether you can run more than one
box at once, and intend to find out.)  The connection is via firewire
connectors and cables, but the protocol is proprietary.  (In the sense that
it isn't IEEE 1394, it's their own thing.  They tested with firewire and say
it didn't measure up to their needs, so they built their own card.  And
released specs so ALSA could write drivers for it. :)

The Multiface is the box that focuses on providing analog inputs and outputs
and built-in A/D-D/A conversion.  (Which isn't quite as pristine as their
standalone converters, but close and way better than most.)  Here's what it
has:

8 x analog line I/O, 96 kHz/24 bit, SNR 105 dBA, 1/4" TRS jacks
1 x ADAT digital I/O
1 x SPDIF digital I/O
1 x ADAT Sync In (9-pin D-type)
1 x Word clock I/O (BNC)
1 x analog line/headphone output, separate output for independent submix
1 x MIDI I/O (16 channels)

The Digiface is for those that don't need the analog inputs because they're
already in the digital domain before they get to the machine.  (Via
standalone DA/AD converters, ADAT decks, digital mixers and other equipment
that can speak on ADAT channels, and so on.)  So instead of a bunch of
analog jacks you get more ADAT channels, and another midi:

3 x ADAT digital I/O, based on RME's reliable Bitclock PLL
1 x SPDIF digital I/O, based on RME's reliable DIGI96 technology
1 x ADAT Sync In (9-pin D-type) for sample accurate transfers
1 x Word clock I/O (BNC)
1 x analog Line/headphone output, separate output for independent submix
2 x MIDI I/O (32 channels)


On the other hand, once you start getting picky (and think about spending
this much money) on stuff it's probably best to sit back first and think
about it... are your mics/preamps/monitors/space good enough to justify it
or even use it to its' potential, or would that money be better put into
those other things first.  (Especially since those things don't improve
quite as fast as computer tech.)

Yet another good counter-argument to "Because we can."

I think we've pretty well established that we CAN do whatever our
ingenious little minds devise.  It's probably time to spend more time
thinking about what we SHOULD do.  [Make that, what we should NOT do.  
Defining behavioral guidelines in the positive is too restrictive.]

That entirely depends on what you want.  Onboard lan/video?  Intel or AMD? 
Dual procs?  ATA-100/133?  SCSI?  Small as in dimensional size or more along 
usage load?  Too many variables there to give a good answer to such a vague 
question.

Even so, I'd say anything in your price range by Abit, Asus, Intel, Tyan, MSI 
would be a good bet.  I've always been a fan of Abit, and my latest Asus 
motherboards haven't let me down.

YMMV.

The md5 checksum is a pretty reliable way of checking for errors.

Anyone know of a cross-platform (Linux/Unix/Win32) utlity that will read
in a BATCH of files (specified ideally by a wildcard) and output to the
console (or a file if redirected) a summary of md5 checksums?

Win32 is needed as unfortuntately most of my friends don't have running
Linux/Unix boxes handy on their home LAN's :)

Use Perl.

Either the Digest::MD5 module (if you have a C compiler available on
each host) or Digest::MD5::Perl if you don't.

I'll file this one for future reference. Someday I may need to apply the
technique in another project. I don't see how is makes things simpler
for this project. However,

"Kenneth G. Stephens" wrote:

this one really does make things simple. For the purposes of my
exercise, there would only be one process running mpg123 so I wouldn't
be concerned with shutting down others along with the one I want, and it
means that I don't have to invoke the step that figures out the pid.
That seems the cleanest to me.

Thanks again to all.

That's true if you know that the c flag is supported on each of your

So you can't configure Evolution unless Gnome is installed?

Sounds like that might be my problem(s).

Also, are you looking for maximum stability/reliability?  This would
imply support for ECC memory, and many motherboards either don't support
ECC, or have bogus support for it -- some have a BIOS option for
enabling ECC (assuming you install ECC memory modules) but the hardware is
not actually capable of supporting it regardless of how you set the BIOS.

For maximum stability/reliability, check the motherboard overclocking web
sites, the further you can push a motherboard with overclocking, the more
stable it will be running at it's rated speed, and it also implies a
better overall design.  It should be noted that some very good
motherboards don't really support overclocking very well, but should not
necessarily be ruled out.

I have read in a number of different places that Tyan is the preferred
manufacturer for many people/companies who build alot of servers.

It's quite good and has some very useful info about connecting Postfix

Off the top of my head... same way you can do it on a linux box.

1.  Install cygwin.  (Including MD5 tools).
2.  Write a batch file that feeds the appropriate commands (or script file)
to the bash shell.

Maybe have it all written to a text file that is pops open in notepad for
them to look at.

I've done stuff like that with cygwin... it works pretty well.

Subject: [PLUG] VP6/PC Heidens runaround ... replacement suggestions?
Message-ID: <86k7pvprjl.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

Well, after waiting for two weeks for a "fixed" VP6 motherboard to
cycle back to Abit from PC Heidens, I just got around to trying to
recombobulate the machine today.  Won't go past the old "Verifying DMI
Pool Data .........." message.  I've disconnected everything but the
video card, keyboard and floppy, reset the CMOS, everything I can
think of, but no help.

So, I guess it is another hour-plus trip out to PC Heidens to drop it
off again.  Then another hour-plus trip (probably in another two
weeks) to collect the repair/replacement... again.

Near as I can tell, the VP6 is history as a product.  Problem is, I
have a substantial investment in PIII's, associated memory, and a
stack of IDE drives that used to fit into the VP6's feature set (dual
socket 370 with a HighPoint HPT 370 IDE RAID controller) rather
nicely.  

Assuming I can get my cash back from Heidens (or even if I can't), can
anyone suggest a replacement motherboard or motherboard/controller
combo that'll take dual 1GHz PIII's, a gig of PC133 SDRAM and 5
ATA/100 devices?

Thanks!

I'm not actually sure (I've just always had GNOME). 
I wonder now how Evolution actually works... do you by any chance find
you have the "gnome-moz-remote" program installed?  I looked at my files
in ~/.gnome while I tried changing default browser, and noticed that the
~/.gnome/gnome-moz-remote file changes according to my changes (i'm not
sure if any other files are changing though). 

If you do have gnome-moz-remote (the program) and that is what Evolution
is using to start up the browser, you might try editing your
~/.gnome/gnome-moz-remote file by hand.
Here's what it looks like:
filename=/usr/local/mozilla/mozilla 
NEEDS_TERM=false
NREMOTE=true

the first line is the path to the browser, the second is whether it'll
start the browser in a terminal, and the third is whether the browser
supports the Netscape Remote Control protocol.

anyway... ;)

Today, IBM announced the largest deployment of Linux in the retail
industry.

Sherwin-Williams Paint Stores, the $5 billion manufacturer, distributor
and retailer of paint, coatings and related products with over 2,500
stores and 25,000 employees announced that it has turned to IBM to
provide technology and services to support Sherwin- Williams' customers
in a multi-store environment, improve customer service and create an
innovative, flexible front-end system and user-friendly  experience.

The company worked with a Linux services team from IBM Global Services
to design and integrate an in-store network that will consist of  9700
IBM NetVista personal computers for all 2500-plus stores, all running
Linux.

One desktop PC will serve as an in-store server and another as a
manager's workstation, improving customer service by enabling
accessibility to both servers and their respective applications from any
workstation in the store. The Sherwin-Williams Point of Sale and
inventory applications will run in the Linux environment. In addition,
all peripherals such as printers, scanners, cash drawers and switches
will be Linux compatible, offering a flexible, open architecture that is
easily adaptable with inventory and sales applications running on the
Linux platform at workstations throughout the Sherwin-Williams chain.
The bottom line:  IBM provided Sherwin-Williams with reduced costs, a
single source vendor for hardware,software and services;  utlimately,
making the move from SCO UNIX to Linux.....painless.

I don't have that file, but when I started poking around in ~/.gnome, I
found my answer buried in a different file.  Thus I ran:

/usr/bin/default-applications-properties

which launched a applet for configuring default terminal, help viewer,
and browser.  Solved!

Thanks for your help!

The args of ps vary SOOO MUCH that trying to write a "portable" thing

Subject: [PLUG] CUPS configuration--Red Hat 7.3
Message-ID: <20020523180558.80177.qmail@web9603.mail.yahoo.com>

I decided to install Red Hat, and it must be
configured to work with a remote printer. I had little
trouble setting up Samba services, and once this was
done I used printconf to configure the BJC-610. The
test page looked pretty ugly, however. The quality of
the print is adequate for program listings, but little
else.

I then turned to CUPS as a possible way to get better
print quality. But apparently it takes a Ph. D. to set
it up, despite what you hear. "Guess a URI..." (What's
a URI?) 

Mandrake and Caldera both use CUPS as a default, but
they have better methods to configure it.I thought I'd
take a configuration file from Caldera, and it would
solve everything (smb://MSHOME/REMOTEHOST/PRINTER).
But no way! ("Client error?" What does that tell me?)

Well, it looks as if I'm going to have to get the book
and read it from cover to cover. Maybe there will be
SPECIFIC EXAMPLES there for typical configurations,
and mine is very typical. There are none in the
documentation I hsve read thus far. Of course, they
provide ipp://foo.bar.com/printers/LaserJet. But who's
foo? And who's bar? And I know I don't have a
LaserJet.

Anyhow,if anyone on this list has endured this ordeal
before--and I consider it very likely--I could use
some advice.

Otherwise perhaps I can get some print drivers
elsewhere that support LPD with this printer and
aren't too tacky. I'm certainly not hooked on CUPS, if
there's another way.

Robert,

  Do you have /usr/sbin/printers? Also, you should have files in

Given that Micro$oft has already admitted that if they were to reveal the
source for Windows that it could compromise national security because of
the bugs that lurk there (see this weeks LWN: http://lwn.net and follow
link to eweek article), it seems that the Pentagon should be doing
everything possible to stop using Windows.  It's a matter of national
security - Micro$oft said so.  By their own admission, Windows shouldn't
be used for purposes where it might endanger national security.

I think the last paragraph is interesting where it says "Stenbit said 
that the debate is academic and that what matters is how secure a given 
piece of software is. To that end, the Defense Department is now 
prohibited from purchasing any software that has not undergone security 
testing by the NSA. Stenbit said he is unaware of any open-source software 
that has been tested."

So, does that mean that the NSA has done a security audit on all Microsoft
software or they aren't purchasing any more Microsoft products?

Couple that with Microsoft's Allchin saying in court that "some Microsoft
code was so flawed it could not be safely disclosed"(1) and you have a 
serious concern as to whether the DOD should run ANY Microsoft software.

I'm definitely not suprised about the report from the Mitre Corp - I met
one of their guys at SANS one year, and he made them seem like a very
cool, very unix-heavy organization.

But what about all of the Linux distributions that are Free (as in beer)? 
They wouldn't be purchasing it then, now would they?  ;)

I realize that they probably meant 'implementing' rather than 'purchasing'. 
It's still a point to consider though.

Hi all,
I have just installed/upgraded to RH7.3.  When I was on RH 7.2 I installed
ncpfs software to login to a novel server.  The commands were placed in
the /etc/rc.local file.
ipx_configure --auto_interface=on --auto_primary=on
ipx_interface add eth0 802.3

ncpmount -m -S xx -V (the rest of the command)

It is as though the rc.local file is not being used.  As su I can do type in
the
ipx_ commands with no errors. Then as a user I can type in the ncpmount
command and all is working.  Any ideas as why rc.local file is not being
used?

The key word here is not testing. The key word is "purchasing". Since most 
OSS is free, there's no purchasing to it.

CUPS was straightforward to set up for a local printer on Redhat 7.3,
but I wouldn't know how to tackle a remote printer.  I like the new
LPR/CUPS switching utility they packaged with the distro.  If I were
you, I'd first try to get it working on a local printer to eliminate
variables and make sure CUPS itself is functional, then tackle the
remote printer "guess an IPP or URL address" stuff for remote printing.

You should see a symlink named S99local in /etc/rc{2,3,4,5}.d/. If 
it's not there, just do

  su
  cd /etc
  [ -L rc.local ] || ln -s rc.d/rc.local .
  for n in 2 3 4 5
  do
    cd /etc/rc${n}.d
    ln -s ../rc.local S99local
  done

In answer to this question, a URI is a Uniform Resource Identifier. This 
may or may not be different from a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), as 
outlined in the RFC covering URIs.

Extracted from RFC 2396 (Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax):

1.2. URI, URL, and URN

    A URI can be further classified as a locator, a name, or both.  The
    term "Uniform Resource Locator" (URL) refers to the subset of URI
    that identify resources via a representation of their primary access
    mechanism (e.g., their network "location"), rather than identifying
    the resource by name or by some other attribute(s) of that resource.
    The term "Uniform Resource Name" (URN) refers to the subset of URI
    that are required to remain globally unique and persistent even when
    the resource ceases to exist or becomes unavailable.

The whole RFC is here: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt

No. Evidently if you have RH 7.3 it is not provided by
default, or the installation went wrong. (The reason
this point is worth lingering over is that Red Hat has
about half the total Linux market, at least in the
US.)

I have Caldera installed on the same computer, and do
not there have similar problems with print quality.
And their CUPS utility is easy to use. According to
what I've heard, Caldera is not continuing, at least
with Linux. But without the printing problem solved, I
am not now prepared to "migrate" to RH.

Hi there, I am sort of a newbie to Linux and new to this list.  One of the topics I have been researching is enabling NTFS support on my RedHat 7.3 install (dual boot w/ XP).  Most of the info I have found says this should already be compiled in my kernel, but I can't seem to use it.  I also read that the driver has corrupted data before, has anyone has this happen?

I did go ahead and set up a FAT partition on my drive to exchange MP3's etc between the 2, but I am still curious about getting NTFS to work,

On the flipside, has anyone used the ext2fsnt driver with windows?  I was wondering if this will work with ext3 fs as well.

Thanks for your advice

  You can go get a copy of CUPS for free at <http://www.easysw.com>. I
bought their PrintPro package for the drivers, particularly the driver for
my HP DeskJet 2500C. I've no complaints, but after 90 days they charge a
bundle of money for any sort of support at all. Including e-mail. That's the
only drawback to the company from my perspective.

  I like CUPS for it solved a network printing problem we had. Their drivers
allow the LaserJet 5 and DeskJet 2500C to print as well in linux as they
could under Windows. But, paying $250 for support when WordPerfect decided
it didn't want to recognize the printers any longer removes any endorsements
I might have made for them in the future.

others or removal later on:

"A lot of people has asked me how can they remove from their boxes a program
they compiled and installed from source. Some times -very few- the program's
author adds an uninstall rule to their Makefile, but that's not usually the
case. This is my primary reason to write CheckInstall. After you
./configure; make your program, CheckInstall will run make install (or
whatever you tell it to run) and keep track of every file modified by this
installation, using the excelent installwatch utility written by Pancrazio

When make install is done, CheckInstall will create a Slackware, RPM or
Debian compatible package and install it with Slackware's installpkg, "rpm

pkgtool ("rpm -ql" for RPM users or "dpkg -l" for Debian) or remove it with
removepkg ("rpm -e"|"dpkg -r"). Aditionally, this script will leave you a
copy of the installed package in the source directory so you can install it
wherever you want, which is my second motivation: I don't have to compile
the same software again and again every time I need to install it on another
box :-)."

Usually you install it with :
make install
and uninstall it with 
make uninstall

Varies with each package, though.

Nay, lass of the media variety.

You are solely at the mercy of the programmer.  If they be thorough,
then you may find that:

make uninstall

works.  Otherwise, a lengthy and painful process of grokking the
output of

make -n install

ensues.  I've read of methods that alter the install program to keep
a log of what it installs and where, but again, if you're doing this
after the fact you're back to the grok.

If you still have the original source tree where you did the build, 
sometimes you can do a "make uninstall" from there.

If that doesn't work then you have to do a little detective work.
Usually I try to find one file that I know belongs to the package,
and then find all other files on the system with a creation date
around the same time. Usually they're all within a few seconds of each 
other.

Somewhere on the net there's an install-watcher utility that is a wrapper 
around "make install." It monitors the installation process and then 
provides a means to undo it, not unlike InstallShield for Windows. For 
things that are already installed it wouldn't help.

  I've searched for the obvious names and removed those, but I've never
known what detritus I've left behind.

  I suppose that if there's a package available for your source tarball you
could check rpmfind and read what it provides, then go delete all those
files.

Well the last that I checked, NTFS was read only. in the stock linux
kernel tree. 

You need to build your own, and enable the experimental support for read
/write NTFS. 

There was talk of killing off the driver due to lack of developer
interested.

I used to use it, but I went back to vfat for my windows stuff, due to
that driver not building in the experimental kernels.  

vfat is nasty, but it is also the least common detonator, so it is
guaranty to always work.

Debian can be painfully behind on some things sometimes... but the package

haven't built many programs that didn't have an uninstall, but it's a major

I prefer to just install to a local prefix.  Then uninstall really is
just an `rm -rf' and the price is just a tiny bit of $PATH
maintenance.  Don't have to worry about filename clashes that way,
either.  Don't need no steenking "make uninstall".

This was a bit of a question that's been clanking around up top. Is that the
typical way to get a source rpm to install into my directory of choice. In
other words, what's the rpm equivalent of "tar xvf filename" when "filename"
is a, say, kernel source rpm?

Personally, I would be afraid to install something with make install that
came from a programmer that was so sloppy that he didn't include this
option.  I would wonder what else was done sloppy.  Or it could be one of
the big ego programmers that think everyone must want my program forever!  I
keep having to "fix" windows PC's that start up with more than a dozen apps
running something because every time you install a program, it put something
into the start up process without asking first.  I wonder if the reason for
this is to load a dll at startup so that it looks like the app comes up fast
when you start it.

Thanks Michael, that sounds great. I like making the computer do the work. I 
certainly don't want to follow the Windows model of leaving large messy 
piles of detritus behind every time there's a little change. Clean removal = 
happy computer with no conflicts.

It isn't a matter of sloppy, it is a matter of the build source not

the /src/foo and /build/foo.  The /build/foo would contain the

Good point.  How do you force it to install into the directory you want?
What if it has libraries, or something else wierd that it installs in a
different place?

Heheh, sure, the two terms are hereby GPL'd ;)

I guess I first took a disliking to those little libs when I wanted to install gaim or some other gtk application (back when I was using an RPM based distro), and it required gnome-libs or kdelibs when I had chosen a 'no-gnome, no-kde' install option during the OS install process..and  I was thinking to myself, 'why? for 1 application?'..since then I'd downloaded source tarballs, learned to read and understand the why's and wherefores of config files, libs, etc, and then one day, along came Gentoo - source, control and user-education.

  Most packages are non-relocatable according to the information about them.
However, if you really want to, why not grab the src.rpm and install that.
Then you can edit the spec file and change --prefix= to whatever you want
before rebuilding the package.

Subject: [PLUG] Q: System Backup
Message-ID: <20020523184150.1bbb8458.jason@vancleve.com>

G'day,

I've been chipping away at yet another Linux install, this time an LFS
system.  Having gotten things working pretty well--all the way down to
the antialiased fonts, I want to make sure things don't go worng for me
again, so I'm ready to back up my system.  Good idea, huh?

It should be simple enough, but I need a recommendation on how to do it.
The whole system is basically in one partition (except for a swap
partition and some mounts which belong to other OSes), and I have space
for the backup in another ext2 partition (where I installed Mandrake
prior to building LFS).  Ideally, I'd like a procedure that would only
copy changes to my system on subsequent runs, and which would preserve
both permissions and symlinks, so if my kernel panics again and I can't
recover, I can just boot to my old Mandrake install and recopy
everything.

Obviously I'm rather new to any real system administration, so what can
you all recommend?

Thanks, gentlefolk,

--Jason Van Cleve


P.S. Congratulations, Eric and Paul, on having surpassed, (from the
LinuxPlanet article) "any work that Linus and Alan have achieved thus
far"!  :)

  I'm sure that I ran into this problem a few weeks ago when I replaced
sendmail with postfix, but I cannot find an answer in my mail archives and
the list's archives are as recent as March of this year. I just hit it again
trying to upgrade from 1.1.5 to 1.1.10.

  Installing from Simon Mudd's src.rpm (which he built on a 7.2 system), my
attempt fails because the package is looking for /etc/init.d. On my system
it's /etc/rc.d/init.d. I don't recall if I used the 'nodeps' option or
tweaked something in the spec file to make it install and work properly.

  Has anyone else encountered this? What's the fix?

Thanks,

Rich

  Fixed it myself. Went into the spec file, found the reference to
/etc/init.d and changed it to /etc/rc.d/init.d. Guess that's a difference
between RH 6.x and 7.x.

  Anyway, it's built, installed and working.

On my laptop I use DHCP to get the IP address for eth0 upon bootup.
However when I'm booting up somewhere and not connected to my network or
another one with a DHCP server, I have to wait a couple of minutes for
the network setup script to timeout before it realizes that it's not
gonna get an address.  It seems that I recall that there is some way to
skip a something like network setup while booting - some conrol-key
sequence or other - how is it done?

With any autoconf'd package, it is just a matter of specifying
--prefix to configure.  If it has libraries that are going to need to
be dynamically linked from other packages (which I find to be only
occasionally), then it is a matter of adding the path to
/etc/ld.so.conf and running ldconfig.

If you are in Redhat, you can press 'i' right as when it starts loading
services and stuff (when you see "Starting foo ....   OK" instead of
kernel messages).  Then it'll ask you if you want to start each thing,
and you say 'y' up until it asks about "eth0", at which point you say
'n'.  At the next question you can say 'c' to continue with everything
else i think (and it won't keep asking you to confirm). 

HTH.

Does anyone know if there is a way to tell the Redhat dhcp client to
only wait for say 30 seconds until it gives up?  I imagine 30 seconds is
really a fine amount of time to wait in all but the slowest networks,
no?

TIA.

1. Create a $HOME/.rpmmacros file that defines the _topdir variable, 
   e.g.,

   %_topdir         /var/tmp/redhat

2. Create the appropriate subdirectories in %_topdir:

   #!/bin/bash

   topdir=$(grep ^%_topdir $HOME/.rpmmacros | awk '{print $2}')
   expr "$topdir" : '/' > /dev/null || {
     "$topdir looks funny";
     exit 1; }

   do
     if [ -n "$topdir" -a ! -d $topdir/$d ]; then
       install -dv $topdir/$d
     fi
   done

3. Install the source rpm: rpm -i blah-version.src.rpm.

The source tarball(s) and patches will end up in %{_topdir}/SOURCES. 
Good luck.

I'm not sure what question you're asking:

1. How do I compile a package so that its final resting place will be 
   somewhere other than /usr/local?

2. How do compile a package so that it'll install into /tmp/package
   even though it'll eventually end up in /usr/local?

As many people have suggested, the answer to #1 is typically to set 
the --prefix variable when running the configure script, e.g.,

  ./configure --prefix=/opt/package --sysconfdir=/opt/etc ...
  make 
  make install

The answer to #2 varies a bit, and usually the only way to know for 
sure is to look in the Makefile that configure builds. Let's say that 
you're building a package that will reside in

  /etc/
  /usr/
    - bin/
    - lib/
    - sbin/
    - share/

but you want to have it install itself into

  /tmp/package-build/
     - etc/
     - usr/
       - bin/
       - lib/
       - sbin/
       - share/

Using a fake buildroot is a trick that most package managers use, and 
a good way to get an idea of what any given <package> is going to 
install into your filesystem. Let's assume that you set the prefix and 
sysconfdir correctly at build time:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
  make

Then what? Well, it depends. Here are the two most common tricks:

  make install \
    prefix=/tmp/package-build/usr \
    sysconfdir=/tmp/package-build/etc

or

  make DESTDIR=/tmp/package-build install

I usually grep a package's Makefiles looking for DESTDIR first of all.
If I get lots of return values, that's the easiest path to take. Other
package maintainers, however, use other environment variables for
accomplishing the same thing, so it's usually a good thing to read the
README and INSTALL files :-)

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205240824270.6977-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I'd appreciate some ideas for the appropriate venue in which to ask a
question about font rendering (both on screen and on paper).

  As I migrate from the now obsolete WordPerfect-8 to OpenOffice I have
found that while all the Type1 typefaces I have installed are available for
use, not all the attributes are. Specifically, the company's logotype is the
name in a specific typeface and in small caps. OpenOffice does not -- AFAIK
-- let me select 'small caps' as an attribute; only 'bold', 'italic' (which
is probably slanted, not italic in any case) and 'underline'. No 'small
caps', 'outline', 'shadow' or other options.

  I am curious whether or not such font rendering is possible as an add-on
to OO or if I need to generate my own font based on the upper- and
lower-case glyphs.

  What say you all for the appropriate place to ask this question?

Thanks,

Rich

/usr/bin/mozilla is a shell script, not the mozilla binary itself. Why 
the developers would hard-code test to be /bin/test is beyond me. 
There are two fixes available to you:

1. Edit /usr/bin/mozilla, changing references to /bin/test to either 
   /usr/bin/test or simply test.

2. Put a symlink to /usr/bin/test in /bin.

Your call.

Well, I changed the /usr/bin/mozilla file as you suggested but now I get
no message and no mozilla either.  It does not start at all.

Maybe its just me, but that doesn't seem right ;)

Until I converted to Gentoo (It's an amazing piece of work!).

I used a tool called checkinstall that I would run in place of make
install after I had made from source.

It would create and RPM for me and then install it from my custom build.
I only found a couple of things it couldn't handle (I can't remember
what they were, and I believe it must have been due to a broken autoconf
configuration). It can also create Slack and Debian packages. I still
use it on all my RH boxes that I have not had the time to convert to
Gentoo.

OK. From within an xterm, try 

  bash -o xtrace /usr/bin/mozilla

You'll get lots of flotsam from your .profile or .bashrc file, but 
eventually you should see what commands get executed by the mozilla 
wrapper script. That might provide some insight. Otherwise, you might 
try launching the binary directly, typically

  /usr/lib/mozilla/mozilla-bin

Some shells like bash have a built-in "test" command which used to have
some differences from the command line version (and may still have
differences).  Maybe they were trying to force the use of the external
version by giving the path, in which case if you changed the
/usr/bin/mozilla reference to just "test", it might now be using the

internal version with:

   enable -n test

or you can just give the explicit path to where test actually resides.

You might try going to http://www.openoffice.org/project_issues.html and
see if this is filed as a bug yet in there database, and file one if it
not.

  I'm conserving electrons by combining two subjects in a single message.

  1) Fonts. I discovered that hidden deep in the bowels of OpenOffice is a
way to turn on all sorts of font attributes, including small caps. I'm a
happy camper now and will continue migrating documents from WordPerfect to
OpenOffice. As an aside, I guess WP is officially dead now. Not even Amazon
is selling copies of it in any form. Oh well.

  2) Gentoo (say it out loud and people think you're sneezing). I looked at
the description on freshmeat and have a few questions about it. What are
"ports" -- a la BSD -- and why are they a Good Thing (R)? Why is gentoo
marketed to developers and network administrators rather than to end users?
Other than the apparently neat installation and packaging capabilities, what
else of value does it offer? I'm curious.

Thanks,

Rich

Gentoo rocks because of their Portage system which is sort of a super
BSD Ports system.

Basically what Portage allows you to do is to create the system you
want, not what the packagers think you want.

One small example. When I first installed Gentoo on my notebook, I
immediately needed Vim (Gentoo's default is Nano and I can just barely
tolerate it). So, the first thing I installed after zsh was Vim. The
default Vim build that comes with Gentoo also builds gVim. So, Portage
downloaded and built X v4.2, downloaded and built GTK, and when I was
done with building Vim I actually had a working X configuration as well.

Gentoo also uses non-standard runlevels. Basically you can create any
runlevels you want. services are started and stopped based on
dependencies. My network card can't be started until PCMCIA services
start, and my RC scripts are smart enough to "know" that. So, while I
was quite capable of tweaking the SXXpcmcia SYYnetwork startup scripts,
it was much easier (once I figured out how it works!) to tell the
network scripts that it depended on PCMCIA.

Message-ID: <1022262727.10704.3.camel@summanulla.clueserver.org>

Anyone know of any place locally carrying StarOffice 6.0?

I have checked a few of the usual suspects and have not found it yet. 
(Not wanting to mail order it if i have to.)

When I asked about it at a couple of software places the reply I got was
"Oh, that is only for Linux. We don't carry Linux stuff any more."  Very
annoying on more than one level.  (StarOffice 6.0 supports Windows,
Linux and Solaris.)  

Sounds like the Microsoft sales people have new FUD for StarOffice,
since that was the reply I got at two different chain stores!

The only way I know of is to get a "power pack" or above copy of Mandrake 8.2.
(which I think is around $70).  Mandrake made a special deal with Sun to
bundle it with their more expensive versions.  The lower end version only
has Open Office.

You can also download StarOffice 6.0 from the Mandrake "club" site if you
become a silver level member (about $120).

Not local but Amazon has it and it took about four business days from order
to receipt.  The discount covers the freight.

Hmm. Everything looks OK. My two remaining questions are

1. Is /etc/rc.d/rc.local executable?

2. Are the ipx_* and ncpmount utilities in root's default $PATH?

Otherwise, I'd be interested to see what happens if you put a bunch of 
echo statements at the end of your rc.local file, e.g.,

echo +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
echo completed executation of rc.local
echo +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
sleep 3 # so you can see this stuff before the console clears

If rc.local is being executed at boot time, you'll be able to see that 
spewage on the console.

That's fine, I'll get used to it just as I got used to the GUI WP rather

  Why SO, Alan, when OO has all of the important components.

  From what I read in the diff output, the AdabasD database isn't in the

I have yet to find a way to make this work the way (I was led to believe) it
should. I am hoping that someone here has some insight they can share.

Here goes!
Machine 1 is an iMac running OS X (guts=Darwin=bsd mutation)
Machine 2 is a wintendo running win2k Professional.

Machines are connected via Linksys EtherFast Cable/DSL Router with 4 port
switch-BEFSR41 to be exact. Then, the Linksys is connected to a Motorola
Surfboard that gets me out to all of you.

Recently I was able to configure samba server on my iMac so that my files
(who am I kidding? I'm talking mp3s here) are accessible by the wintendo,
with a separate account (meaning not me). That account can play files
remotely, add, and also delete files. However, this account cannot rename
files, getting the error: Cannot rename <file>. There has been a sharing
violation: The source or destination may be in use. (it's an mp3, and it
isn't being played)

Both accounts are members of group admin.

I hope I covered everything, but can anyone here shed light on the problem?
I thought it was ownership, I thought it was Samba, I have tried everything
I know how to try, and I can't find any way to make this happen the way it
should. Is it even possible? Is there a better way to do this than samba?

I'd appreciate any assistance any of you can give me with this. I'm tired of
being hassled by my husband over my non-windows OS, and the fact that this
isn't working properly doesn't help much.

Thanks in advance,

I never thought of putting a sleep statement in the rc.local file.
Also add echo $PATH   and guess what?
The path is not setup??  As soon as I fully qualified where the
program is at  it worked just fine.  How strange that it stopped
working when I upgraded from rh 7.2 to rh 7.3.

Thanks Paul Heinlein for all your help.

PS  I will be gone all next week  so if you write back it will
be a Jun 3 before I will see the message.
Thanks again.

If you are forced to do an uninstall by hand, there is a hard way to do
it completely -- use the -n switch for make with the install switch as
so: ``make -n install". What will do is print out (not execute) all of the
commands make install generates, & allows you to a clue to track down
all of the places make has placed files.

Best if the maintainer added the uninstall target to the makefile, though.
By far the best.

hello,

I know that Linux/Unix will not release the memory for an application after
it has be exited until some other apps needs the memory.

However I need to test the speed of the loading of an application and would
like to know if there is a command on UNIX/Linux that will allow me to
force the OS to not look in existing memory location to load the
application again.

I have to do this on HP/SUN/LINUX/AIX.  I was hoping for a common command.

This is just to verify that the loading speed of an application is
improving.

Thanks,

Josh

Did you try turning up the debugging level on samba to see what it says ?

Also, if your husband continues to hassle you, get a new one who can
help you debug ;-)

As you described your problem, I see two solutions:

1) Learn & implement a backup utility like dump or Amanda. Dump is a UNIX
tool, & might even exist in your LFS distribution, having been built while
you built another package -- ar as part of one. Amanda, meanwhile, is a
GPL backup utility available from http://www.amanda.org, & would require
downloading & building. Both of these packages support full & incremental
backups.

Now what you need to do before you get too carried away with this plan is
to plan out how you are going to alternate between full & incremental
backups -- & at which levels. And verify that these backups are correct.
(You will also want to perform periodic full backups, instead of a number
of incrementals diff'ed from the original backup.) Take a look at Curtis
Preston's _UNIX Backup & Recovery_ for ideas of how to design this.

2) Do you have a CD burner attached to this computer? It may be simpler
to burn an image of your /bin, /sbin, /usr/sbin & /etc directories to a CD
each night while you sleep, & with the cost of CD media so low it would
be less of a cost than it first appears.

dumpe2fs is part of the e2fsprogs package.  Is there a dumpreiserfs?  It's
not in reiserfsprogs.

None of these. Just plain _dump_. Man dumpe2fs & man dump to see the
difference. IIRC, it's a command that originated in BSD. Paired with
restore.

Ah.  Well, dump isn't installed by any required package to run a desktop
system.  Just so you know.  I don't have one.

"alot of tweaking" means that the setup is non-trivial, and getting
help is difficult, or documentation is out of step with the product.

I'll look for BitchX, but the X indicates to me that it runs in a
console window on a GUI. I don't have that on the laptop. I have 6
console terminals that I switch around between using ALT-F#.

No, BitchX has a totally workable console mode.

ircii works dandily as well.

In fact, BitchX works fine out of the box (as they say).  No tweaking
necessary for full usability.  It's just quite flexible and so tweaking
can make you a power user.

It's not tough at all.

(By the way, when are you going to come by and get that dial-up working?)

I see that I failed to install that gem, but I'll get to that soon. I
did test the process on another system, and see that it can help. I
did notice that there is a llllooooonnnggg message at the front which
scrolls off the top, and which I don't get any further access to. But
there 's probably some feature I can't read on how to do it.

Thanx!

I have been using dhcpcd for a few years and have never used pump. If dhcpcd
doesn't get a lease it backgrounds. I have to wait about 10 sec at boot for it
to get an address or not. The link is a howto not dhcpcd.

Thank you
Russell

What are the advantages of running these Intel PIII Xeon CPU's vs.
Pentium IV OR AMD Athalon CPU's in a K12LTSP server?

It seems the biggest need of these servers is RAM and fast HD, not CPU.

I see where you joined for a couple minutes and left.  Nah, those are

Intel Xeon CPUs are server CPUs.  The biggest difference
that I recall from the (Intel) mainstream desktop CPUs
is larger on-chip cache.

P-III goes up to 1.2 GHz IIRC.  Don't know about P-III Xeons.
P4's go begin at 1.3 (?) or 1.5 GHz and now go up to 2.6 GHz.
P4 Xeons don't have as much speed variety (i.e., there are
a smaller number of P4's that are built and qualified as
Xeons) since it takes a separate design, manufacture, and
test for each one, and they don't expect to sell quite as
many Xeon (server) chips as desktop chips.

Anyway, for a (what, 30-node) server in this environment,
I'd expect the lower-cost P-III's [Xeons or not] or Athlons
(MPs) to be sufficient.

Phil,

There is an option for dhcpcd that sets timeout.  Do a man on dhcpcd (Nice
way to say RTFM).  Then edit your /sbin/ifup to include that option.  You
want 30 seconds, then the option would be -t 30.  Find in the ifup script
where it invokes dhcpcd and add that option in there.  BTW
www.google.com/linux is your friend when learning Linux.  Almost any
question can be answered searching with this engine.  Of course the biggest
problem then becomes "how to phrase the question".

Thus far, the debugging in samba hasn't been useful, it appears as though

Dump is not on my system, either.  (Jeme, yours is LFS too, no?)  The
man page for dumpe2fs says it "prints the super block and blocks group
information", so it doesn't look like a file backup tool, more like a
filesystem restoration utility.

And actually, I'm trying not to get carried away at all.  Preston's
book and even the "Linux Complete Backup and Recovery HOWTO" seem like
overkill.  I'm hoping learning to use dump or even just tar will be
sufficient for this machine.  Amanda may be more than I need.

(I don't need complete disaster recovery here.  In the unlikely event of
a tornado in downtown Portland, I have a complete set of notes I can use
to reinstall everything, and important things like my sourcecode and
personal stuff are backed up elsewhere.  But Linux has fubar'ed my root
partition on two occasions now, and it's for that contingency in
particular that I would be prepared.)

Full & incremental backups?  At which levels?  Well, my plan was just to
copy all of /, sans the mounts, /proc, etc., to another drive initially.
Then, every night, I'd just like to update that copy with any changes
made.  Oversimplified?  Shortsighted?  Well, probably, but I don't care
about restoring to a given date or anything like that.  This is just my
workstation, and I'm just planning for what seems most threatening,
trying to learn this stuff bite by bite--the only way I know how to eat
an elephant.  But if you can explain how I'm going about this the wrong
way, please do.  For now I'll just read up on those simpler tools in
hopes that they will do the job.

Yes, dumpe2fs and dump are very different applications.  Try
http://dump.sf.net for the dump and restore utilities.

You might also look into rsync, while it's primarily designed for
synchronizing disks / directory trees between computers, it also works
well between local hard drives and includes nice capabilities for
excluding specific files and directories from the transfers.

Hmm, thanks, Shannon.  I thought of rsync, but as no one had recommended
it, I wasn't sure was a viable option.  I guess I'll look into it more.  I
don't want to waste harddrive space with incremental backups, so I was
hoping dump could be configured to overwrite changes.  But maybe rsync
is really what I'm after.

Any thoughts on this?  Will rsync preserve symlinks, permissions,
ownership, and all that?

Current versions of rsync if given the appropriate options will
copy and preserve: ownership, permissions, modification date/time, soft
links, hard links, named pipes, devices, and probably other things I
haven't thought of.  It only transfers what is necessary, though it does
have to scan both source and destination directory trees before it
starts (which can take quite a while on a large drive).  It also has
options which allow it to make backup copies of any changed files before
replacing them with the new version.  I have been using it for a number
of years for all backups in my office, all computers are mirrored to one
very large drive on the server each night, then an incremental backup of
that drive to tape is performed.  If it misses any detail in the
transfers, I haven't noticed it, and I have on more than one occasion
wiped the main drive of a computer and re-initialized it from the rsync
backup on the server.  The biggest difficulty I have had with it was
getting my script files for it configured correctly, because in giving
it the names of directories to transfer and directories to exclude,
including or excluding the trailing slash in the name has different
results, also I've messed up the wild cards more than once trying to
get all the exclusions right -- there are files and directories that may
be scattered through the file system that I try not to backup: core
files, cache directories for web browsers, swapfiles, etc..
Once I got it configured right, I haven't had any problems since.
To make sure it is backing up everything I want, I did a "find" on the
root directory that was being backed up, and again on the backup
directory, and then did a diff on the output from both finds.  This
allowed me to relatively quickly tell if anything was being missed that I
wanted backed up.

Hey thanks for the suggestions, Ken.  
I was actually the one that asked about making the delay only 30 seconds
etc, so it's me that needs to RTFM. ;)  (and i usually do RTFM, but was
lazy and forgetful there - my apologies).

Hey folks...

In case you haven't checked mozilla.org lately, there is going to be a
party when Mozilla 1.0 comes out.  The party will be happening in
various places, the closest location currently in San Francisco. 

There might be a Seattle party if someone up there organizes it, or else
if there are lots of Portlanders wanting to go we could have one here.

Here are some links:

too)

p.s. - we could all split the cost of a bus (or small jet) to
seattle/san francisco. ;)

Message-ID: <3CF10B17.9BE58317@attbi.com>

Is there a Linux tool that will allow me to combine several mp3 files
into one mp3 file, with a suitable, short pause between each file?

I know how to rip a CD into a single file, and have done that for most
of my collection of CD's. I have a few that I ripped into separate track
files and would like to combine them. Also, when I finally get around to
recording my LP's, I will have 2 files to combine, one for each side.

Dick,

The suggestion before was to create a small quiet file you combine in
between the tracks you are collecting so that
file1+quiet-zone-file+file2+quite-zone-file+ . . . .  Just record a few
seconds of sound input with no input turned on.

I am looking for a low cost per page with a low cost, I want easy to
refill ink cartages. 

I would like to print photos, too. 

I have a Apollo-2200 which works great, but the pain of trying to refill
the printer cartage are a pain. I have spilled ink on my self one too
many times. 

The Z35 from Lexmark, @ Walmart & Target for $70 does 2400 x 1200 dpi. 

Which is better then some photo printers. 

Lexmark has the little Penguin on the box, binary only. 

I looked at the Epson photo, also at wall mart for $90 ~ $100. 

2880 x 720 dpi, the color are separated, so one can refill each color. 

The Epson it looks, one can not change the printer head, must send back
to the factory if the head gets messed up :(. 

I like the canon 300,
http://consumer.usa.canon.com/printers/s300/index.html#specs

Has a driver for it.

Ideas ??

Keep these things in mind when buying a color printer.

Does the printer have one cartridge or one for each color?  A printer
with just one big cartridge will be more expensive and wasteful because
you never use colors at the same rate.

Is the ink water soluble? Some are and some are not.  If you are
printing things that are going to be handled a lot, you will want inks
that will not rub off or bleed when handled.

How much are cartridges?  Sometimes the printer is cheap but the
cartridges are very expensive.  (As much as the printer sometimes!)

Can the cartridges by refilled?  Is it worth refilling them?  Some
printers have cartridges that cannot be refilled. They either won't work
after being refilled or even disable the printer if you use a refilled
cartridge.

Most printers are supported by Linux. Sometimes you have to update
gimp-print or the cups drivers.

I don't do a lot of color printing, but I have one here.  I have yet to
find one that is very cheap. The Cannon 660 costs about $16 for the
black cartridges. Not certain about the color ones. i will know soon as
I need to buy more.  They sure get burned up MUCH faster than my HP 4p
laser printer.  I can go through many reams per print cartridge.  I
doubt if I could go through more than one with a color printer.

For printing photos, I would highly recommend the six color Epson Stylus
Photo series... particularly the 1270, 1280, and 1290.

For these printers, you can get a continuous inking system that brings the
cost per page WAY down.  I know several people who have implemented the
system available at:

Good luck.

Now that you mention it, I remember that recommendation. That answers
the question of how to put a gap between songs, but how do you combine
several files into one file? I'm assuming that simple concatenation
won't work due to the presence of a header in each file. What I'd like
is something that would work like cat, but would build a new header for
the finished file. Something like:

mp3cat file1.mp3 gap.mp3 file2.mp3 gap.mp3 file3.mp3 > newfile.mp3

I'm not aware of such a utility, but I've never looked for one.

In reading the lame man page, there's a special switch for "gapless
encoding" which makes me think that the default mode is to include gaps
for contiguous files.  If that's the case, you can simply experiment with
dumping giving lame a string of raw PCM or PCM with WAV file headers and
letting it handle the gaps.

I also might just do something LIKE this:

for song in *.mp3; do
	mpg123 -s $song >>longsong.raw
	mpg123 -s blank.mp3 >> longsong.raw
done
# Of course, this adds some blank to the END of the album, but you can
# figure out your way around that.
lame -m s -r -s 44.1 longsong.raw album.mp3

But those are just some suggestions.  You'll have to play with the
options.

Thanks. I'll have to give that a try.

For the time being, I've added the -@ feature of mpg123 to my php code
to let me create playlist files for those CD's I've converted as
separate tracks.

I've never tried it, but mp3asm supposedly can concatenate mp3 files.

I think you can just 'cat' them together if they're encoded at the same
bitrate and such.  I don't think there's a considerable amount of
information in the header; imagine "tuning in" to a live MP3 stream--you
don't necessarily start from the beginning.  And it works with .mpg
video.

And in the case where the bitrates are different or where a simple cat
doesn't give you the expected results, most command-line and GUI mp3
players will ouput WAV to a file, which you can then convert.

mpg321(1):

       -s, --stdout
                 Use standard output instead of an  audio  device
                 for  output.  Output  is  in 16-bit PCM, little-
                 endian.

       -w N, --wav N
                 Write to wav file N instead of using  the  audio
                 device.  This  option will be preferred if --cdr
                 or --au are specified too. Specifying '-' for  N
                 will  cause  the  file to be written to standard
                 output.

       --cdr N   Write to cdr file N instead of using  the  audio
                 device. Specifying '-' for N will cause the file
                 to be written to standard output.

       --au N    Write to au file N instead of  using  the  audio
                 device. Specifying '-' for N will cause the file
                 to be written to standard output.

Hi guys,

  I'm dropping out of the "Unemployed SIG" & taking a position that's a
really nice step up for me.  Since doing so requires me to move, I'm
also getting rid of some stuff.  I have a fair bit of ISA-based hardware
(mobos, CPUs, cases, video cards, memory, etc.) that I'm willing to give
away for anyone who wants to come & get it.  I also have a near-complete
set of Netware (3.x & 4.x) books/manuals/documentation which again are
free for anyone who wants them.  I live just slightly N. of Vancouver,
which may impact some who read this.

(Just for the record, I'm also having a moving/garage sale, but since
that's a bit OT, I won't go into that...)

If anyone's interested, please write for directions.  The stuff will be
available through Monday evening, after that it becomes part of the
"dump run" that I'm making shortly thereafter.  

Thanks,

T

Yes, that is my understanding, too.

On the other hand, a simple concatenation of OGG files is in fact a
valid OGG file.

I think this answers someone else's earlier question. Anyway, if the
other techniques don't work, this would let me use some other audio
editing tool to connect one wave file to another.

I assumed wrong. I just tested concatenating two small files and then
listened to them. Sure enough, mgp123 plays the combined file with no
problem. There's even a short pause between the two, although I don't
really know if that's because of a pause at the end of the first file or
the beginning of the second file or if there's some other reason (say
mpg123 finding another header?) for the pause.

Thanks to all for the ideas.

Actually the header for an mp3 file contains a lot of really important info.
That's were the player program gets the data rate, stereo and file size, etc.
The only reason that cat works is that it does. It really shouldn't. The player
program, mpg123 probebly is _playing_ the second header. That's only a few
bytes but it's not mp3 encodeing. I don't think you'd be able to hear it. You
might be hearing silence at the begining and end of the audio tracks. The only
real way to join two or more mp3 files is to either rewrite the header after
joining the files and remove the second files' header or you could cat wave
files and then encode them or find a program that does this. I don't know of
one but it wouldn't be hard to write. The header for wave files also has some
important info: samples per second, stereo, file size, 8/16 bit samples, etc.
If you can dump sound as raw pcm data and cat, rip that it would work just
fine. I guess all I'm really saying is that...  I'm glad it works for you. If
you join two mp3s with different data rates it won't sound very good. I'm
pretty sure that most player programs won't be looking for header info at
arbitrary points in the file. They'll just play through it and it sounds like
mpg123 doesn't care if the file size in the header is wrong. Some programs like
baudline will refuse to deal with sound files with bad header data. There is
also id3 tag info, title artist etc. That would get lost, listened to, as well.
Baudline by the way is a really amazing but not open source signal analysis
program for linux.

Message-ID: <3CF1A87D.6030901@pacifier.com>

As long as we're talking mp3's and such, thought I'd ask what folks 
are using to capture audio.  Audacity (0.98) was working okay, but 
lately has been seg faulting after recording for 3 mins or so.  (It 
has a command line option for self-diagnostics, which it fails now). 
It's a steaming pile of poo.

Editing would be nice, but usually Linux waveform editors are too 
convoluted and/or just don't work.  (Audacity barely worked in this 
regard, but it used to be enough to do very basic editing.) If I can 
capture 2 hours to a .wav, I'd be happy.  CoolEdit 2000 is the only 
reason I still have a Windows box.

That's really to bad. Audacity had been the best program that I was able to
find, and I looked hard. It never did very good buffering. Maybe that's what
they're trying to fix that's making it dump. I haven't used it in a while. Hope
they fix it. At one point I had cooledit kind of working with wine. Kind of,
but that was a while ago. There's always the C programing language. That's what
I've been using lately. I don't think I've written anything that anyone but me
would actually want to use though.

First, let me make it clear, I am not the person who asked the question.  But 
I did notice once before that there was no /dev/modem on my RedHat 7.2 
/etc/ppp contains most of the info entered from the GUI setups though.

I don't really know what Bob is missing, as I am running Gnome and used the 
RH ppp Dialer.  However, I think the KDE "internet dialer" had a "setup" 
button that takes you to a couple of tabbed pages for setup, and there is a 
place there under devices to point it to the correct serial port, ttyS0 
(first) or ttyS1(second).

More info on what he has configured in the setup would help.

of surplus, and engineering samples from Intel. We even got some "big

I've been trying to convince my girlfriend to write me a sound editor 
that doesn't suck, but she insists that's too high level for her 
interests, she writes drivers.

Dunno what happened stability-wise, but she says that's the way bad 
memory allocation works: it'll be fine one day and dump core the next. 
  Audacity has improved and I am using the latest version afaik, but 
I've always had to cross my fingers.

I'll have to audition the current crop of stuff again and see what 
looks promising.

Cheers,

Yeah, the donations to schools helps. In addition to the extra cache, XEONs
require a good motherboard which can make a significant difference over an
el-cheapo desktop board.

Terminal services is a numbers game, most machines are idle most of the time.
For example, if every user is idle 90% of the time and the 10% of non-idle
time is spread out evenly, you can have 10 people use a single machine at
full speed without their even knowing that they only really have 10% of the
resources available. If you have users who hit the cpu, ram, or disk hard
for extended periods of time, it is best to give them a stand-alone desktop.

Even when users are idle, they are chewing up ram... so that is the most
critical item. Excessive swapping will lead to a quick death-spiral.

After a listening test some months ago, I decided to do all the
conversions at 256, so I'll always be dealing with the same data rate.
Some day, I'll look into writing a program to write a new header based
on the data found in the files I'm combining. Until then, I'll get along
with mpg123 working on slightly corrupted files.

Thanks for the insight.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.33.0205262247550.27466-100000@lukem.com>

I've got quite a few users running off a Linux terminal server.  They use
Outlook Webmail to access the Exchange server.  When I setup their
accounts on the Linux server, I told them to set their password to the
same as they used on their previous Windows machine.  Then I disabled
password expiration on the Windows domain controller for their account so
the password wouldn't expire on the DC and lock them out of Webmail.

I currently use Samba to allow them to access the Windows file and print
servers, but I'd like to find a way to synchronize their Linux passwords
with their passwords on the Windows DC.  So, if they change their Linux
password, I'd like it to update their password on the Windows DC so they
can login to Outlook Webmail (and access Windows file servers) with their
new password.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Check out rdiff-backup as well.
http://www.stanford.edu/~bescoto/rdiff-backup/
This could be overkill or otherwise inappropriate, but neat nevertheless.
It is written in python, using rdiff to create an rsync-like copy of
current data w/ a configurable number of rolling incrementals.

I believe you are looking for the windbind stuff in Samba that allows you
to authenicate against a Windows domain controller. Some of this might be
out of date but its a place to start:

I'm using rsync to copy files from a file server to a backup server.  I
have several rather large data files (1 to 2 gigs) that are being copied.

Question 1:  If a data file is only slightly changed, does rsync only copy
over that small change and then insert it properly into the data file on
the backup server?

Question 2:  If the data file is being written to when I run rsync, do I
run the risk of ending up with a corrupted data file on the backup server?

Thanks!

I think only the different parts of the file are transferred.  There is
a page on the site describing the algorithm
(http://rsync.samba.org/tech_report/node2.html), which states:

"The end result is that $\beta$ gets a copy of A, but only the pieces of
A that are not found in B (plus a small amount of data for checksums and
block indexes) are sent over the link."

Whether a copy is made at the destination I can't say, but maybe you can
divine that from the algorithm I linked.  There is an
option "W", as well, by which you can bypass that algorithm and copy
"whole files".  This is actually the default when rsync is copying
locally.

I'm not sure about this one, but I would sure like to be!  I hope with
crossed fingers that it waits to copy any file that is write-locked, at
least.

It depends on the options you give it, the default is to only transfer
small blocks of data containing the areas of the file that have changed,
but there is an option to do only whole file transfers.  In my office, I
generally do whole file transfers for any computer on the 100 Megabit
network which can use rsh as the default login shell for the transfers
because it seems to be the fastest approach.  For lower speed links such
as the old 10 Megabit network or modem links I use the default option
which just transfers what is needed.  It is particularly important to use
the default "only transfer what you need" mode if you are connecting to
the remote computer with rsync using ssh, even on a high speed link,
because everything has to be encrypted/decrypted which has enormous
overhead on large file transfers.

Absolutely, but this is the case with any backup system that doesn't get a
lock on the file before transfering it.  The only way to be completely
safe is to stop all processes that might modify the files before doing
the backup, or alternatively, if the programs accessing the critical files
allow it, to generate a backup copy of the data on the local system before
it is transfered to the remote computer.  Databases generally will allow
you to dump the data to an external file in a manner that preserves it's
integrity, other programs sometimes have similar facilities.  Ultimately,
you have to evaluate each file that is likely to be modified during the
backups for risk of data loss and how serious that loss would be to you,
then act accordingly.  In my case, the backups are run at a time of day
when I am rarely using the computers, so my working data generally won't
be modified during the backups.  Other files that are likely to be
modified while the backups are running are primarily log files, incoming
email storage, and the database, so the database is dumped each night just
before the backup, who cares about lost log files, and most of my incoming
email at that time of night is spam so no great loss :-)

Just to kinda throw a wrench in, but why not use the Ogg/Vorbis
compression?  mp3 is still proprietary.

have fun.

I have a usb scanner I have been trying to get to work.  It is a

am sooo close. I am running RH7.3

1. I have a new scanner.c & scanner.h file I downloaded that supports my 
scanner(where do these go?)

2. I have inserted the scanner module with my vendor and product ID

3. usbview shows the scanner attached, kernelcfg show the module is loaded

Xsane still doesn't recognize it, any help on my next move would be 
greatly appriciated

We're not a pure Linux household. The intent of my project is to allow
the music collection to be listened to either on the stereo in the
living room, or on any of the computers connected to the house network.
Most of those are still Windoze machines. I'm assuming here that
Ogg/Vorbis isn't supported by Windows Media Player or Real Player or
some other Windows audio player.

Of course, I'm wrong in that assumption! Since Google is my friend, I
went looking for Ogg/Vorbis and found Vorbis.com. On their home page is
the following:

  WinAmp 2.80 with Ogg Vorbis support!
  added on 2002-05-01 22:31:14.11
  According to the Nullsoft website, the current version of WinAmp,
2.80, 
  is now supporting Ogg Vorbis for Standard and Full installs. Thanks,
guys! 

I shall have to reconsider.

The other reason I'm still using mp3 is that I have yet to figure out
how to set up Lame, and am still using Cakewalk Pyro on my Windows
machine for mp3 encoding. I suppose I should look into Ogg/Vorbis before
going too much further. I haven't started converting my LP's and have
only ripped a couple of dozen CD's, so the time investment isn't too
great, yet.

Subject: [PLUG] Kernels: 2.2 vs. 2.4?
Message-ID: <20020527094049.A2026@nellump.net>

What's to be gained by having kernel 2.4 running on an ancient P166
laptop, as opposed to kernel 2.2? My old Gateway was running fine
(mostly) with Red Hat 7.0 (which installed kernel 2.2), but lost all
PCMCIA functionality when I upgraded to RH 7.2 (kernel 2.4).

I've since learned that the 2.4 kernel which ships with RH 7.2 uses the
new built-in PCMCIA driver software, which has no support for PCI-based
PCMCIA bridges (like the Cirrus bridge in my Gateway). I attempted a
custom kernel/pcmcia-cs (modular PCMCIA support) compile yesterday, but
had no luck getting the damned thing to work properly. The core PCMCIA
modules load just fine, but it won't recognize any PC cards as other than
"anonymous memory" types. This apparently is related to some timing issue
that could be rectified by the use of an appropriate config parameter,
but I certainly couldn't track it down.

I could beat my head against the wall some more attempting to get
this working with kernel 2.4, but I'm tempted to just downgrade to the
combination I knew worked. Will I encounter any problems trying to run
a RH 7.2 install with the older (2.2) kernel?


Thanks,

Paul

I've just spend about a 1/2 hour at the site getting a little familiar
with OGG/Vorbis. Sounds promising. I just might invest the time to
convert. Thanks for the nudge.

I went there the same thing with my microtek usb C6 

make sure that you have mounted the usbfile system

mount -t usbdevfs /proc/bus/usb 

then you should be going with gas.

Message-ID: <1022529349.25593.10.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Has anyone found a way to specify what user directory the local user
files should be stored?  Prior to OO 1.0, there was a wizard that asked
each new user (within a network installation) where the install folder
should be and where the JDK is located.  Now all that's gone and it's
trying to put two of my users' info in a directory called
$HOME".openoffice1.0", yet a third user is getting info put in a
directory named $HOME"OpenOffice.org1.0".  I'd like them all to be in
$HOME".openoffice.1.0".  I've also noticed that spell-check doesn't work
for the user with the $HOME"OpenOffice.org1.0" directory.  Oddness. 
What really bothers me about this issue is that it used to work just
fine and now they've automated the user setup so that breaks itself
automatically.

Hey, all.

Still trying to print sheet music with lilypond.

lilypond runs without errors on my mudela file and outputs a .tex and a
.midi.  I can't get midi to play, but I haven't tried very hard.

As for the TeX file, I'm trying to print it, but I'd like to preview it
first.  So I'm using texi2pdf with no switches.

texi2pdf music-file.tex

Heaps of crap displays on the screen and I get a ? prompt at the
bottom.  I ^C to exit and read the music-file.log file that was generated:

I used to get different errors and then I added an assload of symlinks in

Any help would be appreciated.

OK, what's wrong with my system?

When I run `mkisofs -r -o cd_image /path/to/directory`, my system slows to
a standstill and other processes bog down and I cannot be productive until
it's done.

I have a dual P-III 800 system with 1GB RAM and a single 7200 rpm 40GB
udma/100 IBM drive.  My homedirs are nfs mounted, but neither the cd_image
destination nor the cd image path are on that filesystem.

I assume I'm IO bound, but shouldn't this just be a single read and a
single write process?

I'm SURE I've got other reading and writing going on all the time.  This
is just absurd.

Anyone know what I can check?

Hmmm.  That really shouldn't have been necessary and could still be
contributing to your problem, i.e. maybe it's not your source file.
It's been a while since I added an "external" latex package in, but
when I did putting it in the right place seemed to do the job.

Have you read the docs for lilypond and looked for installation advice ?

I'm in the same boat.  Got an Epson Perfection 1650.  Kernel says:

kernel: usb.c: USB device 33 (vend/prod 0x4b8/0x110) is not claimed by 
any active driver.
kernel: scanner.c: open_scanner(0): Unable to access minor data
modprobe: modprobe: Can't locate module char-major-81

Dunno why it's looking for video4linux (char) or an I2O harddisk 
(block).

/proc/bus/usb/devices indicates an Epson scanner.

Modules `scanner` and `usbcore` are loaded.

usbdevfs is mounted.

/dev/usbscanner -> /dev/usbscanner0


Setting the debug envars as per docs and running

$ scanimage -d epson:/dev/usbscanner >t.pnm

yields, in part,

[epson] SANE Epson Backend v0.2.08 - 2001-06-09

I think SANE is for Scanner Access Not Easy

Yup, and I like that moniker -- "intellect", much better than "unemployed".
Hardware was the hardest hit.  All gone.  No more IBM hardware development
in Beaverton.  The Linux Technology Center was not immune, as I am living
proof.  I have to believe that there's a place in this area for an
experienced UNIX/Linux software developer.  Onward and upward...

The chief difference you will most likely notice is that the latest
rpms for XFree have been compiled against 2.4, & not against 2.2 --
or so the documentation I have read states.

As for your lost PCMCIA functionality, this may be due to a bug in
kernel 2.4.9 -- which I believe ships with RH 7.2. Check the kernel
release notes, & see if there is mention of a patch for this.

I can't speak to your mkisofs problem specifically, but the behavior you
describe is pretty much what I would expect.  mkisofs by itself should be
a completely I/O bound process which is constantly seeking the disk to
alternately read then write data, any other process that wants disk access
is  going to be competing with the constant seeking for the reads and
writes of mkisofs which will only make the problem much worse.  The best
thing I can suggest is stick a "nice -20" in front of your mkisofs
command which will then at least give your other processes higher
priority and make them somewhat more responsive.  One other thing that
may help a little (if you haven't done it already) is to add the
"noatime" option to the mount command for your file system(s) which
should also cut down on the amount of disk seeking required by all of
your processes which do disk I/O.

RH 7.2 (at least the earliest ISO images) shipped with 2.4.7-10. My
latest trials were with 2.4.17 and pcmcia-cs 3.1.33.

If it is 2.4.9, you may want to switch kernels, it had quite a few
problems as I recall, and the current stable kernel is 2.4.18 (unless
2.4.19 came out while I wasn't paying attention) which by all accounts I
have heard it is the most stable so far in the 2.4 kernel series.

Haven't yet.

I guess I'm mostly wondering if this is aberrant behavior or expected.

Well, then I'm a big dummy.

`tex music-file.tex` yields a music-file.dvi, but `xdvi music-file.dvi`
claims "xdvi.bin: Can't find font feta16.600pk".

I have the same missing font issue with dvipdf.

jbrelin at person:~$ locate feta16
/usr/share/lilypond/afm/feta16.afm
/usr/share/lilypond/mf/feta16.mf
/usr/share/lilypond/pfa/feta16.pfa
/usr/share/lilypond/tex/feta16.tex
/usr/share/lilypond/tfm/feta16.tfm

I also have a symlink ot /usr/share/lilypond/afm in
/usr/share/texmf/fonts/afm.

What gives?

Other option is to use LVM or other snapshot capable volume manager and 
then back up the snapshot.

Absolutely. This is the route I would take. The latest Samba daemon is
capable of authenticating against your primary domain server and
creating translated Linux users "on the fly" based on the PDC's
authentication response.

This avoids your having to constantly update user accounts, passwords,
e.t.c.--Samba and the PDC do that work for you.

Interesting, I wasn't aware of this feature of LVM.  Unfortunately this is
only a partial cure for the problem, it nicely prevents on-going
operations from causing inconsistencies/corruption during the backup, but
it does not deal with the problem of data which is in an inconsistent
state at the time the snapshot occurs.  Some databases in particular, and
probably other programs as well would need to be momentarily paused with
their files in a consistent state before taking the snapshot in order to
insure a completely clean backup.  In theory, a properly implemented
database system will always keep it's files in a consistent state at
any given instant, and should be fine to backup live using the snapshot
feature (no need to pause), but experience says never trust that any
implementation is what it "should" be.

But the nice thing about a snapshot is that it can be taken very
quickly, so you can shutdown your databases, take the snapshot, then
bring the DBs back up--in considerably less time than if you shut them
down and then backed up, and only brought them back up after they'd been
updated.  Or, you can dump your databases to text files (assuming you
don't have too much data) and ignore the state of the db files
themselves.

My wife broke a key on her laptop -- an Acer Travelmate 512T. Examining
the pieces, it appears that the key was affixed to the backing by
some kind of clip-on method. Which, if true, means that I should be
able to buy a new key & simply replace it.

Is this the case, or should I track down the local Acer repair shop
& hope they can fix the computer in a few days, or less?

The Red Hat 2.4.9 kernel is heavily patched. I haven't used it on a
laptop recently, so I can't speak to pcmcia support, but the RH kernel
has proven very stable on the dozen-plus machines on which I support
it.

2.4.18, otoh, appears pretty stable, but there's a known nfs race

   Postfix mails a statistical summary and details for all mail it
processes. I don't understand all the categories and I haven't yet figured
out why, when postfix addresses it to 'postmaster', it also bounces it as
spam. I've not had any responses from my post to the mail help list so I'm
asking here.

  It may be better to do this in two parts: first, why the mail is bounced,
but gets to me in a roundabout way and second, what all the stats are
telling me.

  Would this be better done off the list?

Thanks,

Rich

It is tricky but easy to replace the keys IF you can find a replacement key.
That is the hard part.  If you can find one then by all means do it
yourself, otherwise just take it in.

Subject: [PLUG] Your Resume
Message-ID: <MDB21ju2iDL6e5f6WVY00004b39@toon.fws.net>

Dear Candidate,

My research assistant submitted your resume to me a few days ago that he found 
posted on the Internet.  Your skills and experiences are impressive.  I would 
like to keep in contact with you for future opportunities that might be a better 
fit than any of our current assignments.

Just for your reference, you can view a few of the non-confidential job listings 
listed on our web site http://www.wagl.com.  Our company specializes in helping 
advanced/middle management professionals into positions with outstanding growth 
potential.  Most of the jobs we work on are 100% confidential.  We also, on occasion, 
represent our clients with other types of positions that are normally outside 
this focus.

If you have been searching for your next opportunity for a few weeks or longer, 
you should find the following information useful.  This simple newsletter has 
helped a few of the candidates we couldn't work with directly.   We have outlined 
the benefits and weaknesses of various Internet job-seeking resources.  I find 
that too many job seekers limit their search to just one or two job sites.  This 
strategy is extremely limiting.  There are a lot of opportunities on the Internet 
but they will not be found with limited research. 

Most of the best jobs are not advertised; those jobs are only found through networking 
or by reaching out to new recruiters in your field of expertise, on a large scale, 
before they recommend candidates to their clients.  Even in today's economy, 
the independent recruitment business is alive and well.  Recruiters are responsible 
for placing 50% of jobs between $50,000 and $90,000 per year and 85% of jobs 
over $100,000 per year.  Love us or hate us, we are still in business.  If this 
is your target salary, we need each other for our mutual success.

JOB SEARCHING -- You can search for jobs at no charge on virtually every job 
site.  These sites make money by charging recruiters and employers to post jobs. 
The drawback is that the best jobs are not posted here or anywhere.  Here are 
a few well-known examples.
http://www.Monster.com  (for general jobs)	http://www.dice.com  (tech jobs)
http://www.vault.com (general and various jobs)
http://www.RecruiterConnection.com  (for middle/upper management jobs)
http://www.HeadHunter.net  (lots of tech jobs, as well as many general ones)

RESUME POSTING -- Posting your resume is also free most everywhere.  The drawback 
is, in order to be effectively 'found', there are a few hundred places where 
you need to post your resume.   All 'top level' job sites (the ones with television 
ads) charge large sums of money to search that resume database.  This pricing 
model virtually guarantees that most employers and recruiters will not find your 
resume.  Posting your resume to lesser-known job sites is often more effective 
because most have a larger recruiter and employer user base (those sites charge 
little or nothing to search for resumes).  There are a few online services that 
take the pain out of posting your resume to 30 or 40 effective job sites.  Each 
site charges a nominal fee for the time they save finding and posting to that 
many job sites.  Here are a few examples.
http://www.resumevalet.com
http://www.careerexpress.com 

CAREER COUNSELORS -- Realizing a need for career marketing services a few companies 
are successfully assisting executives with a personal direct marketing campaign. 
Their services include resume writing, counseling, and resume distribution via 
regular mail.  This type of marketing effort will uncover the hidden job market 
for the few professionals smart enough to recognize the benefit.  The personal 
attention they offer is great but you will spend as much as $8,000 with no guarantee 
of a job.   Here are two established firms that help many people.
http://www.wsacorp.com  and http://www.job-hunting.com 

TARGETED RESUME DISTRIBUTION -- For proactive job seekers who earn between $40k 
and $260k and want an intelligent connection to the executive recruiters that 
serve their industry, profession, and location, this is the best answer.  This 
service focuses solely on the distribution of your resume, via email, to over 
10,000+ executive recruiters.
It is much better than being lost in a database and putting your life on hold 
while waiting to be found.

We see job seekers succeed with this approach on a daily basis.  This approach 
builds an instant network for the job seekers who have been too busy to cultivate 
one while they were working.  This instant network helps find rewarding jobs

If you find out that they can rename files remotely via samba, let me know

Take a look at pflogsumm.pl here:

http://jimsun.linxnet.com/postfix_contrib.html

It does a nice summary of postfix logs, including bounced messages, etc. 
This may not be verbose enough for your needs but I've been waiting for

nscd is part of newer glibc releases; it "handles passwd and group
lookups for running programs and caches the results for the next
query. You should install this package only if you use slow Services
like LDAP, NIS or NIS+." [1]

The socket file you mention is opened so that basic system calls 
(getpwnam, getpwuid, etc.) can communicate with the daemon -- as 
opposed, say, to communicating with it via a tcp/udp port.

Basically, if you rely only on DNS and local files for host/user/group
lookups, nscd probably isn't helping you -- and may be cacheing
outdated stuff. The nscd(8) and nscd.conf(5) man pages are helpful.

  Thank you, Dan, I'll take a look at it. Regardless of how the numbers are
summarized (and I can follow what's been mailed to me), I have questions
about what the categories/numbers represent. I suspect that the perl script
won't tell me that.

How can I run this, and mail the results from the command line?  I'd
like to run this as a cron job every night.

I just created an /etc/cron.daily script with the log summary command in 
it. I have the system set up to email cron results to me, so that was 
automatic.

I named the script 0postlog so it would run before logrotate.

 From the LVM Howto:

A wonderful facility provided by LVM is 'snapshots'. This allows the 
administrator to create a new block device which is an exact copy of a 
logical volume, frozen at some point in time. Typically this would be 
used when some batch processing, a backup for instance, needs to be 
performed on the logical volume, but you don't want to halt a live 
system that is changing the data. When the snapshot device has been 
finished with the system administrator can just remove the device. This 
facility does require that the snapshot be made at a time when the data 
on the logical volume is in a consistent state, later sections of this 
document give some examples of this.

It runs right before midnight, giving the statistics for today, so I can 
read them first thing tomorrow morning. As long as you are getting 
root's mail on that server, the results will go to you. If not, edit 
/etc/aliases appropriately.

I've been playing with running multiple concurrent sessions on one machine. 
It is easy and fun, at least in console mode. (RH 7.2) I can open six, 
Alt+F1- F6, any combination of users I want. but when I try to open an x 
session it crashes as soon as I switch away.

For example, at Alt+F6 I'll fire up KDE. Works fine until I switch to one of 
the others, for example Ctrl+Alt+F1. when I come back it is crashed. Same for 
Gnome and XFCE. Should be plenty of hardware resources, Duron 800/256 RAM.

Should it not be possible to do this? All of my personalities must find 
simultaneous expression. Red hat docs are unhelpful.

thanks,
Carla

  This must have been installed with Mudd's distribution for that's what I'm
seeing when it's mailed to me each day.

  I also inadvertently blew away today's message, so I'll need to wait for
tomorrow's version.

  What I need to understand is why so many messages appear as received, sent
and relayed. Even going back a couple of weeks, the received/sent numbers
appear very large, and I don't understand why there are any being relayed
(except for a few from the other workstation here).

  Reading the web page taught me why there are times for some of the daily
stats: they're the average and total times connected by the originating IP
or domain name.

  Does the rpm 'build-package-from-tarball' work on the tarball as received,
or does one need to create a spec file within the source?

Thanks,

I may well rejoin the list when I get setlled, but I am usually well
involved with whatever LUG is in the area I live and between the high
traffic of their lists plus the 120+ mails I get from various security
lists, plus keeping up with the BBSs I frequent it gets overwhelming.
Depending on the activity of the local LUG I may resubscribe, but if it is
fairly active it would just be too much to keep both.  You may see me again!

By the way, you guys are absolutely correct about this being one of the
better lists.  I have seen more insightful comment on here than any other
LUG list I've been on in my 6 years of reading them.

It works fine for me. If you want to grab the tarball 
(linux-505.tar.gz) for yourself, I've updated my .spec file that'll 
turn it into an RPM for you:

  http://www.madboa.com/geek/specs/acroread.spec.txt

Easy steps:

#!/bin/sh

# season to taste
rpmroot="/usr/src/redhat"
srcfile="linux-505.tar.gz"

# grab the requisite files
cd /var/tmp
wget http://www.madboa.com/geek/specs/acroread.spec.txt \
  --output-document=acroread.spec
ncftpget ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/acrobatreader/unix/5.x/$srcfile

# the following may have to be done as root
ln -s $srcfile ${rpmroot}/SOURCES
rpm -bb acroread.spec
# the following most certainly will have to be done as root

Well, that's why I suggested the Portland Unix/GNU/Linux User's Group,
which is the much more affable PUGLUG.

I had a problem with crashes or lock-ups when switching between X and
consoles some time ago.

I'm pretty sure it was related to a hardware problem wherein the wrong
size resistor was installed between the two CPUs on the mainboard
(combined with a particular kernel, X revision, and video driver).

To answer your question, it not only SHOULD be possible to do what you
describe, but I believe many of us do it many times every day.

So, I would suggest taking a look at your software revisions across the
board, video drivers, and any hardware errata that might exist.  Running
memtest probably isn't a bad idea, either.  In other words, you have a
problem and need to do some deep troubleshooting.

All file systems are resierfs 3.6 mounted with noatime. kernel 2.4.18 with SuSE
patches. mkisofs version 1.15a21

Running `mkisofs -r -o /tmp/cd_image /usr` 

The average CPU was 8% with a few spikes to 45%. Mem usage was about 43M with a
few plunges. I have a hardware ATAraid on the drives using raid 0, one bigger
disk from two smaller. 

Doing the test over using one IDE drive and writing to the hardware ATAraid
drive, the CPU utilization is always around 25%. Memory usage is topped at 10M. 

I'm writing this as file is being created, the cd_image file up to 9.9G, The
windows manager commands (PWM) seem sluggish when using key shortcuts and terms
are slow to load. I have Pronto 2.4, Opera 6, amd gaim with all the plugins
running.  Sound is choppy and annoying, kernel AC97.  

The system is workable.  

I have been making cds with xcdroast, (uses mkisofs) on p166s for years but
never was doing much else on the box when I was doing the burns. The GUI to
xcdroast always worked, no sluggishness, so I think you have an issue. 

Recompile of the latest cdrecord tools

Look at your hdpram settings. bonnie++ and dbench are, in my opinion, better
tools to measure the effects of the settings than using the -tT options on
hdpram.

Maybe the file system? I haven't played with any of other new file systems. New
means anything other than ext2 for me. 

Is the file system a local resource or mounted remote file system? NFS or Samba
mount? I've never tried that. 

Thank you
Russell

Does anybody know of an Xterminal for Gnome that supports multiple
sessions like Konsole does (in KDE)?

To curb some responses:

1) I already know about screen.
2) I want to stop using KDE altogether so running KDE and GNOME apps
simultaneously won't work. (my laptop is maxed out of memory at 154 Mb
and the two have eaten up all my memory)
3) Running other window managers like IceWM, NextStep, XFCE is not an
option.

Thanks,

If the tabbed interface is what you're after, there's:

* multignometerm - a patched version of the basic gnome-terminal program
http://multignometerm.sourceforge.net/

* powershell - which has been doing this for a while but looks like it might
be stalled and never was particulary outstanding
http://powershell.sourceforge.net/

* dzt - which was launched to address stability issues with powershell
http://dzt.sourceforge.net/

fwiw and btw, the generic gnome-terminal uses a factory-server, so the
memory footprint of multiple open windows/sessions is less than it might be
otherwise.

I use the gnome multi-terminal and I'm very happy with it.  It's exactly
like the gnome terminal only you have tabs for each terminal.  That helps
me keep life simpler than with 8+ different windows.

I had a similar problem with my new NVidia card, it turned out to be an
issue with framebuffers being enabled in the kernel.  As soon as I
recompiled the kernel without framebuffers, I could switch to any
console without lockup.  I can now start multiple X sessions (each as a
different user), and switch between them.

Good Luck

Oh, sorry that was poor wording.  I get 120+ emails a day from 6 or 7
security lists.  As for the business, I don't prefer to talk about the
details just yet!  My wife is opening a tourist related business and I will
have my own business as well, neither of which will make us rich but should
allow us to live quite comfortably.  For the first time since I've been
working the focus will be on enjoying life a little instead of making money,
which I've discovered to be the only way to live.

Unfortunately, I have another 6-8 months of hard work before I can even move
to VI, so the fun doesn't start just yet.  Right now my wife is heading to
Pennsylvania and I am heading down to LA and then Chicago.

Subject: [PLUG] Sound Capture ?
Message-ID: <51AE6EA505FCD111AB5600805F653ACB010AA14E@EXCHANGE>

On linux I use gramofile.  I've used it to record practice tapes (45min a
side) many many times, and it's stable as a rock.

The interface is simple.  It does a decent job of de-hiss and de-pop if you
want it to.  And it it can automatically split the tracks for you if you
like, as well.

I never had any luck at all with Audacity... flakey as hell.

Agreed, most linux wav editors suck.  One that is stable and OK to use is
Studio.  (http://studio.sourceforge.net) But it can be really slow when
performing operations, or at least was the last time I used it.  The most
powerful one is mxv.  (Mixviews.)

It is very stable and has more features than you can shake a stick at.
BUT... it might very well fall under your definition of "convoluted".  It's
pretty hard to use without reading how to get started with the interface.
The manual isn't with it, which makes it worse.  But it is on the website.
(Hint: go to the "selecting edit points" chapter to get started.)

I probably should have mentioned that this is a reiserfs as well.  But I
don't use noatime.

Right... sorry.  It's rare that the system isn't at all workable.  It's
just quite unresponsive and ONCE mkisofs segfaulted and the system locked
(pingable, but not responsive).

Well, cdrecord always works fine.  It's just kind of a ridiculous slowdown
when I run mkisofs.  It's not terrible.

I did.  I would say that, as a matter of maintenance, I rebuild just about
everything every couple of months (not intentionally, just through normal
rotation of packages and rebuilding when dependencies are updated and so
on).

I definitely will look at hdparm.  I've installed it (quite recently), but
haven't configured it to be run in any runlevel.  I've confirmed that the
disk is in the appropriate dma mode.

As I said, it's local for both read and write.  There are NFS mounts, but
I'm not working in those trees.

Anyway, I'm thinking that we're seeing the same behavior but I'm finding
it more startling than you are.

Subject: [PLUG] Postfix has taken an evil turn
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205281311440.5818-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  One of my mail list subscribers has the domain aol.com. While there were
no problems before, now his attempts to post are being rejected as spam by
postfix. What's even worse is that my replies to him are also being rejected
and never make it out of my system here.

  I've no idea where the problem is located.

  In /etc/postfix/access I've commented out all *@aol.com users, and rebuilt
the hashed database before reloading postfix. The message I get from postfix
doesn't tell me what generated the error, only that it occurred.

  This is the same problem I see when mail from root to postmaster is
redirected to me.

  I'd greatly appreciate some guidance here on how to track this down and
fix it. There are no aol IP addresses in my badip file and no aol.com's in
my badaddr file. I'm completely stymied here.

Thanks,

Rich

Looks like we are under a spam attack again.
Is there any possibility to f**k up these spammers by tracing their
computers, breaking in and format their hard drives?
I assume that most of these crooks are using Winblows.

  I do now. If a message -- incoming or outgoing -- includes the phrase "to
be r-e-m-o-v-e-d" (without the hyphens, of course) it's stabbed in the heart
and instantly killed.

  Well, that filter works without question. :-)

  Two points:

  1) With the size of the unemployed SIG subscribed here I wondered if
anyone would complain. :-)

  2) I'm having excellent luck getting the originating ISPs to shut them
down when I report the spam to them. Because this came via a mail list I

Your reply gave me an idea to create PLUG members resume database.
What if we have some directory/database on PLUG server to store
PLUGers resumes who were laid off and desperate to find a new job.
This directory should be accessible by everybody over TCP/FTP.
So PLUG membership could serve as some kind of reference for potential
employers and benefit unemployed PLUG members.

administer/moderate it?

You know this is a real opportunity for alot of people.  I know several
people I used to work with at Nortel did this.  A couple of guys who were
laid off organized alot of other guys who were laid off and they started an
employee owned company stealing Nortel's customers.  Anyone who wanted to
put money into the company got a partial ownership and if you didn't have
any money you could work there and accrue stock by by taking a lower salary
than usual.  If you weren't willing to do either then you couldn't get a job
there.  The company has been in business for two years now and everyone is
back to making the same money or more than they did at Nortel.  Some people
are making a lot more.

Point is if someone could get these people together and come up with a
reasonable business idea something could really come of this.  Something
better than what everyone had in the first place.

Something to think about guys.

  The next step, of course, is to publicize it. One way to start might be to
let newspaper columnists know of the database vis-a-vis the K12 licensing
situation.

This brings about a type of irony for me.  Sequent itself was created from
30+ people leaving Intel all at once and starting their own company.  It

then I do for the gnome-terminal

Could somebody tell me what is wrong with this proftpd.conf file
or at least show me what the bear minimum  I need in this file to make
it work. I am totally stumped on this it should be something very simple to do.

When I try to log on the server I get this error

Connecting to 216.65.131.167:21
Connected to 216.65.131.167:21 in 0.020, Waiting for Server Response

331 Password required for tester.

530 Login incorrect.

 What is a 530 error?
 Does it have anything to do with the way the permissions are set
 
 This is what the group looks like in the group file
 site60:x:572:
 
 This is what the username looks like in the passwd file
 tester:x:549:572::/usr/sites/www.testcompany.com:/bin/bash


 This is what the permissions are set two at the top of the directory
 tree for this site
 drwxr-xr-x 6 apache   site60       4096 May 28 10:59 www.testcompany.com

 This is how the permissions are set in the site directory

I spoke with the Enterprise Business Center this morning. They are an
incubator in this area for small businesses.

For the last ten years I have created IT infrastructures for businesses
large and small. From this experience I have taken with me a firm grasp
of the requirements necessary for an effective business network.

Now it's time to raise the bar.

Here is a link covering the major points of my business plan. There are
some areas that need work. Even the name, for example needs work; we
found out that our target market thought `MetaSource' sounded like a
pharmaceuticals company. I am certain, however, that I will be
successful.

     www.metasource.us

I want to pamper my customers. I want my customers to feel like they've
just stepped into the IT equivalent of a Hilton Luxury Suite. No
worries, no hassles, the systems simply work. From the customer's point
of view it's as if there are little unseen technicians humming away
making things run smoothly.

...And I'm going to do it running Linux.

In short, I want them to forget about us in a way because ``the trains
are arriving on time.''

It may be a month before I am ready to take on contractors, but who
knows what could happen in the mean-time? 

Give me your input. Give me your resumes. I am working hard for this and
I hope to provide contracts in the near future. Basically I will simply
do the best I can.

Finally, I need to be perfectly clear: it is my intention to generate
income for myself and the open source community. This is not an
advertisement; it is a Request For Comment.

Cooper Stevenson

Have you tried explicitly setting AuthPAM?

AuthPAM                         on
AuthPAMAuthoritative            on

I don't know what method proftpd will default to if you don't give it
an authorization method.

Hello Colin,
Ok I tried adding  AuthPAM  AuthPAMAuthoritative  and that did not
make any difference. I thought the default for authorization was set to us
the shadow password file.

Hi:

The only thing I feel it is wrong is the user and
group  in the proftpd.conf file, you set as "apache"
for both name. In your passwd file, the name is
"tester", "site60", but not "apache". Try to change
the user name and group name as the same as the name
in your proftpd.conf file.

Hello Lynn,
That would be nice if I could do that but there will be more than one
user and group using this ftp access so the username and group name can
not be unique

Okay, with a little playing around I found that 530 login failed can
be due to:

1) User not being in the password file.
2) A valid user sending an incorrect password.

Are you sure that you're using the correct password?

What do the proftpd and system logs say after you try to log in?

Colin

Hello Colin,

Yes I am sure I am using the correct password. I even
created a new user and it would still not work.
It is not showing up in the system log

While businesses like these can bring work to a few or maybe more than a
few, they don't even begin to touch on the talent pool now available in
Oregon.  There is enough laid off talent to start a major corporation with a
major product or service line.  If I didn't have a U-Haul truck sitting in
my driveway I would get things started.

There are alot of people here who like to succeed and they just need the
chance.  The first step to take would be to find someone familiar with the
layoffs at some of these companies and find out who the executives were that
lost their jobs.  They have the business sense needed to get something like
this off the ground.  Talk to them and try to enlist their help.  They would
also know alot of the better technical people who got laid off and could
contact them.  There are plenty of executives, managers, customer support,
PR and technical people out there to staff something big and if enough of
them came onboard there would be enough money to make it work.

Or, since I am not going to be here and therefore don't really count, nobody
could do anything and let a rare, rare, golden opportunity slip away...

I spoke with the Enterprise Business Center this morning. They are an
incubator in this area for small businesses.

For the last ten years I have created IT infrastructures for businesses
large and small. From this experience I have taken with me a firm grasp
of the requirements necessary for an effective business network.

Now it's time to raise the bar.

Here is a link covering the major points of my business plan. There are
some areas that need work. Even the name, for example needs work; we
found out that our target market thought `MetaSource' sounded like a
pharmaceuticals company. I am certain, however, that I will be
successful.

     www.metasource.us

I want to pamper my customers. I want my customers to feel like they've
just stepped into the IT equivalent of a Hilton Luxury Suite. No
worries, no hassles, the systems simply work. From the customer's point
of view it's as if there are little unseen technicians humming away
making things run smoothly.

...And I'm going to do it running Linux.

In short, I want them to forget about us in a way because ``the trains
are arriving on time.''

It may be a month before I am ready to take on contractors, but who
knows what could happen in the mean-time?

Give me your input. Give me your resumes. I am working hard for this and
I hope to provide contracts in the near future. Basically I will simply
do the best I can.

Finally, I need to be perfectly clear: it is my intention to generate
income for myself and the open source community. This is not an
advertisement; it is a Request For Comment.

Cooper Stevenson

Subject: [PLUG] I need some help with proftpd
In-Reply-To: <52626070031.20020528160837@starband.net>

Hi 

In my proftpd.conf file the setting is like this:

# Set the user and group that the server normally runs
at
user            nobody
group           nobody

# A basic anonymous configuration no upload
directories
User            mmm
group           mmm

# We want clients to be able to login with
"anonymous"as well as "mmm"
user Alias            anonymous mmm

for example: I ftp to www.redhat.com
I type in " ftp ftp.redhat.com" then using "anonymous"
as my login name, then it ask for password, I just use
one of my e-mail address. Of course you need to start
the proftpd first.

Subject: [PLUG] Your Resume
In-Reply-To: <200205282113.g4SLD2A11136@gate.daniloff.com>
References: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205281343480.6883-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com> <200205282113.g4SLD2A11136@gate.daniloff.com>
Message-ID: <20020528235210.GD10956@dr.mobizinc.com>

I recently had a related idea of my own.

There are a lot of HR folks (and most headhunters) who insist on
receiving resumes as an M$ Word document.  This annoys me for several
reasons.  In addition to the obvious, I've recently found using a word
processor messy and tedious (especially since I discovered LaTeX :-)

Also, many organizations are switching to web based job applications.
If you have ever used one of these, you know what a PITA it is to cut
and paste your resume to fit their form.

Anyway, my idea is to come up with a format (open, of course!)
specifically for resumes, based on XML (called, say, CVML--Curriculum
Vitae Markup Language).  The point of this is to separate the content
from the formatting. 

My vision includes a desktop application that takes the content and
formats it however desired (HTML, LaTeX, RTF, even *shudder*...a Word
document).  This application would also let the user edit the content,
without worrying about the formatting.  Since the candidate would have
access to the same application, they could format the resume themselves,
if appropriate..."Here's my resume, both in CVML and Postscript"...

If successful, this would have the following benefits:
	-Resume content would be standardized to an open format.
	-You come up with the format for a resume exactly once.  Once
	you get it right, you can change the content without ever having
	to fiddle with the formatting again.
	-The standardization opens up all kinds of possibilities in
	information exchange and archival.
	-The obvious--freedom from M$'s stranglehold.

What would you folks think of this concept, and of using this
directory/database as a launching pad for it?

Hello Lynn,
I have changed  user and group to nobody but it still gives me the
same error.

I am not trying to do any anonymous configuration

Greetings,

Starting a business without adequate funding is (in my
opinion and experience - just ask my wife!) crazy!

But, if there are the right technical people (willing
to work night and day,executives (eager to be very
frugal in spending) with leadership plus money
connections, and marketing/sales people (willing to
pay low cost economy airline seats all the time), then
this sounds like an excellent opportunity.

Finally, product also has to be realistic and again
everyone involved has to work harder than they ever
had  in their life.

Hope some of you could get a project like this off the
ground, the rewards are great - so are the sacrifices.

Writing out of experience.

Lynn

Executives...   business sense...

Sorry, as a tech boom skeptic who prayed nightly for people to come to
their senses ever since the Dow crossed 7,000, I don't have much good to
say about most executives. If executives actually cared about getting
business done and not about stock value and making themselves wealthier,
we wouldn't be in a situation where thousands of people needed jobs in the
first place.

It sounds like a nice idea to start a new company that focuses on the
customers, but as someone else already pointed out, the reason this is
even a discussion is because of what happened to Sequent. So apparantly
the cycle is always going to be that technologists and those who LOVE to
do good work will always come up with good ideas and will poor sweat and
blood into getting something off the ground and then the suits will step
in to ruin the entire operation by focusing primarily on making middle to
upper management rich.

I don't see this cycle ever ending.

Well, the Supermicro P3TDDE came with today's FedEx truck, and I was
even able to confirm with the semi-english speaking support person
that it would indeed work with my P3's (Coppermine is okay, but
Tualatin's with only 256k cache won't do SMP, apparently).  Started
stuffing the motherboard into my ATX case, only to discover that it is
an inch deeper than the VP6 and my CDROM will no longer fit into the
box.  Two words sprung immediately to mind.

Can anyone recommend a place locally that sells a decent ATX case with
5 external 5.25-inch bays.  Probably need to be a full-height tower.
I've had a couple AOpen HX08's at the office for several years and
they would work.

Thanks!

I've had the same idea for a year or two, & looked hard at the DocBook
DTD as a prototype. Unfortunately, one can't print from XML so I've fallen
back on LaTeX to at least start producing a prototype that could be
later ported to an XML DTD.

So far my exploration with resumes & LaTeX have uncovered four different
packages written for resumes or curriculum vitas[*], & of the three I've
tired, none do exactly what I want to: one I couldn't get to work without
error messages; one defines the attributes of the occupational & skill
classes nicely, but it doesn't allow for a simple title class; & the
third defines the classes nicely yet I don't like how it formats the
information.

Sending a resume in ascii text to a job shop should be good enough.
After all, they are going to enter it into their database, massage it
to their standards -- all of which far too often occurs after the print
the thing out & then scan it back in. (Yes, I was told this happened
once -- which is still one time too often.) And Word will open ascii
text files.
</rant>

On the other hand, I seem to remember MS Word being able to import
LaTeX format documents. Am I confusing MS Word with another word
processing program?

It makes sense: I have heard the factoid that the average resume is
read in 10 seconds or less; the hiring manager wants to know what
skills a potential interviewee has, & gain a clue just how strong
those skills are. Such a structured means of presentation would
improve efficiency all around: we could write better resumes, &
hiring managers could read these resumes faster.

Unfortunately, because it's such a good idea I doubt it would work.
Job shops & HR departments would balk at adoption because they
couldn't import the XML resume into MS Word. And if MS adopted
the proposed CVML DTD, I'd bet money they make changes to it that
either break other implimentations, or add features that annoy
the hiring managers (e.g., the ability to embed animation in a
resume).

Having said all of that, I would be interested in working on such
a project. Who knows -- maybe we can create something that proves MS
chases more taillights than the volunteer software camp?

OK, everyone suggests a hardware issue. I don't think so. I'm starting from 
the console- no X sessions running at all. F1-F6 are available, which I think 
is normal behavior. I gleaned this nugget from another place: run

startx -- :1

from any of the consoles. This starts X on F7. I have KDE going there, happy 
as a lark. I can switch back n forth just fine. There must be more to this.

For schools, it's Microsoft's way or the free way 

05/21/02


M icrosoft has beaten a retreat -- albeit a rumblin', bumblin',
stumblin' retreat -- from its proposed audit of the 24 largest school
districts in Washington and Oregon, but the battle between the software
company and Linux is only heating up. 
     
Stung by furious criticism after targeting those districts with a
"random" audit to "certify licensing compliance," Microsoft has backed
off while going out of its way not to reveal its fallback position. 

While it is still trying to peddle school agreements that require
"institutionwide commitments" and costly upgrades, Microsoft is no
longer using the threat of imminent audits as a sales tool. 

"Microsoft has put the inventory request on hold," said Catherine
Brooker, a company spokesman. "Microsoft realized it wasn't as sensitive
as it could have been with the timing of its request." 

How long the hold is on, however, is unclear. Steve Carlson, the
associate superintendent for information and technology for Beaverton
schools, said Microsoft has put nothing in writing: "We don't know what
to believe." 

What became clear after I wrote about the audits April 21 was that
Microsoft wasn't simply picking on cash-strapped school districts in the
Northwest. Terry Hippenhammer of Puget Sound ESD, said schools in 35
states have been audited. Annoyed tech coordinators in Iowa, Arkansas,
Utah and Philadelphia suggested that Microsoft's licensing tactics were
pushing them toward Linux and free, open-source software. 

In February, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said he considered the "Linux
phenomenon" the top threat to Microsoft's plans for world domination. 

No wonder Doug Miller, Microsoft's group product manager for competitive
strategies, immediately trashed it. "There really isn't much value in
free," Miller told Wired.com. "Free does not sustain a business. . . .
We have yet to see a business model in the Linux world that has any
chance of long-term success." 

Tell that to Amazon.com, which claimed in a recent SEC filing that it
saved $17 million in technology expenses by switching to Linux. 

Tell that to Randy Baker, tech coordinator for 16 school districts and
12,000 users in central Iowa, who said he "completely dumped Microsoft
last summer and migrated everything to Linux." 

Tell that to Portland Public Schools. 

B y September, Portland schools will have opened 16 new Linux-terminal
computer labs at a cost of $240,000, half of what those labs would cost
if outfitted with the usual Microsoft trappings. 

"We're very serious about Linux," said Scott Robinson, the district's
chief tech officer. "We're down to the last few dollars from the 1995
technology bond. For me to refresh the school's computer system, we have
to look at open-source software and a different server." 

Multnomah ESD is saving $190,000 a year in licensing, maintenance and
staffing by using Linux. In Iowa, Baker said the migration was motivated
by tight budgets and Microsoft's "well-publicized security problems." 

And if savings and security aren't reason enough to consider open-source
software, there's always Microsoft's attitude. That attitude was
exemplified in a notation on a Microsoft Web page titled "A Guide to
Accepting Donated Computers for Your Schools" that read, "It is a legal
requirement that pre-installed operating systems remain with a machine
for the life of the machine." 

That's not true. "It was very poorly worded," Brooker agreed. "Microsoft
has fixed it." 

While Red Hat is offering open-source software and free technical
support to all schools in North Carolina and Apple, Carlson said, has
worked overtime "to understand the culture of schools," Microsoft has
long been a royal pain. 

"Microsoft feels schools have no viable alternative," Robinson said,
"which isn't the case anymore. I find it ironic that Microsoft doesn't
seem to be interested in working flexibly with schools to make sure
their operating system is the first one those kids experience." 

In 16 (and counting) computer labs this fall, it won't be.

Hello,
I think that the simplest way to store resumes on a server is to put them 
into SQL database in a plain text format.
Since all resumes have common parts like heading, body and footing they can 
be put in separate columns in the table.
Upon potential employer request queried resume data can be formatted and 
securely uploaded onto his/her PC in any available format. 
I've done this thing at my work place for Document Control  Dept. already

Another idea is to automatically convert all resumes into common .PDF format 
and store them in DB

Does anyone have a suggestion for a good MP3 ripper for Linux.  I am
interested in turning my CD collection into an MP3 collection.  I run
Red Hat 7.2.

Thanks,
Robbert van Andel

If you can do without an RPM, abcde is pretty slick. All command-line, as
it should be, IMHO. GUIs are overkill for something like an MP3/OGG
ripper/encoder. It does OGG by default, but once you have lame set up, it
will do MP3s as well.

That's many peoples' fine idea too:
 http://www.xml.org/xml/industrySectorList.jsp?CATEGORY=30
 http://www.hr-xml.org/channels/home.htm
 http://xmlresume.sourceforge.net/
 http://www.isomedia.com/homes/mjohns/xml-index.htm

unfortunatly I've not found a single employer/headhunter that supports
resumes in any portable/flexible format.

I'll have to second this motion. abcde is great. Just pop in a cd and
type abcde at the command prompt and it goes.

You might want to take a look at these URL's (the first one has a link to
the second one):

   http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/resumeLibrary.html
   http://xmlresume.sourceforge.net/

they already have an XML DTD for resumes and some XSL style sheets for
formating (though I didn't seem one for Word), they list HTML, PDF and
plain text output formats.

Some things to try/check:

  1 - Have you tried to connect locally (do ftp from the machine proftp is
      installed on).
  2 - Make sure the user's login name is NOT in /etc/ftpusers
  3 - Run proftpd with the debug option turned on.  If set to a high
      enough level, it should tell you something about what is going on.
  4 - The proftpd.conf file caused me a few headaches getting it setup
      correctly, you may have some permission setting(s) wrong or missing.

You can get the lame rpm from freshrpms.net

The rest I just had to work through. I agree that its non-trivial if your
not of the Debian persuasion, but those seem to be the breaks. They can
just apt-get abcde, or whatever, ;-). Hmm, maybe it's time for me to take
woody for a test-drive...

You might also try grip. It's probably already on your machine and a fair
bit easier.
Ogg-as-default vs. lame/mp3 stuff still applies, IIRC.

: Hat, not Debian.  Any suggestions?
:

I'd like to chime in on this as well. I use Mandrake. I wouldn't mind a 
command-line interface, but I too visited the website, and saw what I feared: 
a recursive install:

You want A.
You need B to get A to run ...
You need C to get B to run ...
You need D to get C to find B ...
You need to upgrade to run D ...

Any advice on a three-resursions or less, not-so-painful install?

I think you are have a good point about the executives and the recent stock
market fiasco, but remember the companies that caused the collapse were
primarily run by a lot of idiots with no business sense who had no business
plan and got venture capital just by saying they were a high tech startup.
Granted executives are generally idiots, alot of them do know business.

And this conversation was started because of the sequent layoffs, but that
is onloy a fraction of the high tech layoffs n the region.  There are
thousands and thousands more.  The advantage to having an employee only
owned business is that the lower management and grunts are on the board.
Upper and middle management is fighting for them as well by definition.

Besides, you CANNOT have a large corporation without competent executives.
Techs can be businessmen but only by exception not rule.

Executives...   business sense...

Sorry, as a tech boom skeptic who prayed nightly for people to come to
their senses ever since the Dow crossed 7,000, I don't have much good to
say about most executives. If executives actually cared about getting
business done and not about stock value and making themselves wealthier,
we wouldn't be in a situation where thousands of people needed jobs in the
first place.

It sounds like a nice idea to start a new company that focuses on the
customers, but as someone else already pointed out, the reason this is
even a discussion is because of what happened to Sequent. So apparantly
the cycle is always going to be that technologists and those who LOVE to
do good work will always come up with good ideas and will poor sweat and
blood into getting something off the ground and then the suits will step
in to ruin the entire operation by focusing primarily on making middle to
upper management rich.

I don't see this cycle ever ending.

Someone on the list should have a copy of Word.  Someone could convert a
text resume to a word document, then convert the word document to a web page
and post it to their web site for review.  When everyone is pleased with the
resume the someone could send the word document to the one who sent the text
resume.

Someone could/might make a few bucks doing this.

Ken, not someone, nor everyone.

I might be needing an international spy for some ultra-secret operations

"To begin X, from the console, enter:

Alt+F8 to move back in the second X session, Alt+F9 for the third, and

To begin a second X session, enter:

startx -- :1

It's a 1, because startx is short for: startx -- :0

In all you can likely have four X sessions running simultaneously (depending 
on memory). To begin a third, enter:

startx -- :2

...and for a fourth, enter:

startx -- :3"

All peachy fine n dandy, except when I try to start a 2nd X session it horks

There isn't actually much to it even in the Debian version, it provides
two command line tools:

    abcde, cddb-tool

I think the problem is you need a bunch of other programs in order to
use it:

  1 - An encoder (one of these): lame, gogo, bladeenc, or l3enc
  2 - id3
  3 - cdparanoia
  4 - cdda2wav
  5 - wget
  6 - cd-discid
  7 - vorbis-tools
  8 - eject
  9 - distmp3

Some of these are optional depending on what you want to do, I don't have
distmp3 installed, don't use vorbis (yet) or eject so these could
presumably be left out.  These are all command line tools and I don't
think any of them require any configuration, just stick them on your
path.  Once you have them all installed and on your default path, you
just need a  configuration file in your home directory:

   .abcde.conf

see below for my configuration - you will need to adjust it for your
needs, particularly to match the encoder you are using (I use bladeenc).
Once it's all installed, just pop in a CD and enter the command:

 abcde

With my configuration file and a computer with access to the internet (for
looking up the album titles and track names) it will automatically rip the
tracks, encode them, and place them in a directory structure like this:

   /home/music/<group_name>/<album_name>/<cd tracks>

with each track given the appropriate name for the song.  A play list
file will also be generated in the same directory with the tracks in the
correct order.

It may be a pain for non-Debian users to install, but I think it gives
you the ultimate in flexibility.

If it helps, my config file is below.

Are you starting them as different users?  If not, you are probably going
to have file collisions between different instances of the same window
manager running from the same directories and files.  I've never tried
to start multiple sessions this way, generally I configure xdm to startup
multiple X login screens, and then login on each of them, though not as
the same user on the same computer.

Okay,  I'll admit to owning Word. Actually several copies.

I'll reformat a resume, make it sexy and infect it with any macro virus you 
choose so you can submit it to your fav human resources department. There's no 
extra charge for the virus, and it's optional. I'll post them at

Fry's probably has the best selection.  I'm very happy with my Antec 
chassis, but it only has 4) 5.25" bays, which isn't a problem for me.  Not 
that you're weird or anything...should be able to find something in all the 
mess there.  If you go, don't give up until you look for the pallets (can't

Anyway, Antec cases are good.

If you are using postgresql, the woody upgrade has a bit of a problem, the
old 6.5.3 version dump writes out the user information in a format that is
incompatible with the 7.2 version's input format.  Basically, you have to
replace the "copy pg_shadow from stdin;" and all of the inline database
user information which follows (don't forget the trailing "\.") with a
series of "create user XXXX with YYYY:" lines which give the user names
(XXXX) and their capabilities (YYYY).  There is also some config file
tweaking required due to some incompatible options.

I just finished sorting this out an hour ago.

Spoken like the typical educator with an overly puffed up view of
the importance of what he's doing.  This quote speaks volumes.

Why the heck do people like Scott Robinson give a crap about what
Microsoft thinks?  If they are so fired up about Linux, rather than
spouting sour grapes like they are doing, they would have nothing
whatsover to say about Microsoft and would spend their quoting time
talking up how great Linux is.

The fact is that people like Scott aren't moving to Linux and other
open source software because of it's superior technical merits.  They are
moving to it because:

1) They are mad Microsoft has stopped giving away software to them for free
and they feel that going to what Microsoft hates is a revenge tactic.

2) They still think the world (including Microsoft) thinks that schools
are a perfect advertising venue for products and will do anything to
get them placed, and that when they roar about what they are doing, the
world trembles.

3) They think that "getting serious" about Linux is going to give them
some sort of club they can use to beat pricing lower with Microsoft.

In short, the quote above is a perfect example of someone still clinging
to that Microsoft pacifier.  He may not be sucking on it every day of
his life anymore but he's very unhappy as all get out that he can't.

Just look at the wording in the article:

"...We don't know what to believe...."

Um, why do they care?  Just embrace Open Source and you don't have to pay
attention to Microsoft or worry about figuring them out.

"...suggested that Microsoft's licensing tactics were pushing them toward
Linux..."

So Linux is something that you have to be pushed towards?!?!

"...we have to look at open-source software..."

So, Open Source is something that you _have_ to look at rather than _want_ to
look at?  Sounds like an unwelcome homework assignment to me.

Hell, the title of the article is in this same vein.  Why wasn't it
titled:  "Schools finding Linux is better and cheaper than Windows"

Wow this is just what I've been looking for, I recently installed a cdrom in 
my file server with the desire to insert a cdrom and just have it ripped, 
tagged and encoded.  Anyone have any ideas how to create  a abcded (daemon)

I want it running all the time waiting for me to insert a cdrom.

Subject: [PLUG] Dumb Build Question - libpng
Message-ID: <20020528232922.1e0ab2ff.jason@vancleve.com>

Pluggers,

This one's been nagging me.  What's the best way to include headers
which have been installed in peculiar places?  libpng is the package I'm
thinking of here.  For some reason it puts its headers in
<prefix>/include/libpng12 (and then links that as include/libpng, as if
that helps somehow).  So nothing that needs this very central library
will compile without special attention.  So I've been adding "-I
/usr/include/libpng12" to my compile flags as needed, but obviously this
is not ideal.

What should I be doing?  For one thing, could I have tweaked the libpng
makefile initially to prevent this?  I could mv those headers up into
the include directory, but I'm afraid I'd forget if I ever reinstalled
libpng, or maybe they're actually in libpng12/ for a reason?  What
would be considered best practice here?

Thanks,

--Jason V. C.

I just finished installing an SB Live! Audigy soundcard into my

I'm not sure I understand the problem, if it is putting the file in:
/usr/include/libpng12 and is creating a link to it from:
/usr/include/libpng, then you should be referencing it as:

  #include <libpng.h>

(I am assuming here the .h even though you didn't list any extensions) and
you should not need to do anything else, since by default /usr/include
should be on your header file search path.

Am I missing something?

You got me curious, so I started looking around and found absolutely
nothing useful online, so either I'm not thinking like the people out
there who posted on the subject of detecting CD changes, or Linux doesn't
have any real support for this.

Anyway, not being willing to let lack of information stop me, I did some
poking around and found that for my IDE CDROM drive, /proc/ide/hdb/capacity
(the CDROM being hdb) returns the capacity (using the cat command) of the
currently inserted CDROM, and zero if there is no CD currently inserted.
This being the case, a fairly simple script could be written to check the
capacity of the CDROM drive every five or ten seconds, and if it is
non-zero run abcde (with the eject option enabled and eject command
installed).  This would result in disk conversion starting within five to
ten seconds after insertion.  Something like this should do the trick:

   #!/bin/sh
   CDROM=/proc/ide/hdb
   DELAY=10
   RIP="abcde -x"

   while true; do
      sleep $DELAY
      CAPACITY=`cat $CDROM/capacity`
      if [ $CAPACITY -gt 0 ]; then
         $RIP
      fi
   done

Unfortunately, I no longer use SCSI drives, so I am not able to determine
if there is a comparable means of detecting for SCSI.

One side effect of this which may be either positive or negative depending
on your perspective.  You must have it eject after the CD is complete,
otherwise it will detect the CD and start the process over again.  On the
up side, this means the tray will pop out to let you know it's ready for
another disk, on the down side, these trays are generally rather fragile
and if you aren't keeping an eye on it, children or pets may damage it
while it is sticking out and you're not around.

Anyone know a better/less clunky way to detect CD disk change under Linux?

As a general rule, one should avoid extrapolating a single quote in a
news article into a whole theory.

First, Scott's new on the job, he comes from the corporate world.
I know he has a very clear view of "the importance of what he's doing".
At the very minimum, the label "typical educator" is way off mark.

PPS had made *MAJOR* investments into Linux long before this whole audit
fiasco. They can use Linux as a serious hammer because they KNOW that
it is a serious hammer. 

Linux is the *ONLY* rational option in many cases right now. Only one choice
is often bad news, even if it is Linux. As the saying goes, all software
stinks (some stinks less than others). No single piece of software fits all
needs nor teaches all concepts.

>1) They are mad Microsoft has stopped giving away software to them for free
>and they feel that going to what Microsoft hates is a revenge tactic.

MS never gave schools software for free. MS has historically, and currently
still does, give big discounts to schools. They seem to trying hard to change
that, but that is not the primary issue.

>2) They still think the world (including Microsoft) thinks that schools
>are a perfect advertising venue for products and will do anything to

>world trembles.

Nope, the "advertising" piece is a secondary issue at best. Apple made huge
inroads by giving away software/hardware to schools. Red Hat is kicking 
around doing the same right now. It makes long-term sense.

The primary issues are that 1) current MS software will not run on 90% of
the computers in schools, 2) it is not currently possible to buy new 
computers, and 3) the licensing requirements change over time and are never
clearly defined, making it almost impossible for most schools to PROVE that
they are 100% compliant no matter how hard they try.

There is simply a huge disconnect between what MS demands and what the
schools are capable of dealing with. This is driving MS out of the school
market, which is the jist of the whole thing, for better or worse.

>3) They think that "getting serious" about Linux is going to give them
>some sort of club they can use to beat pricing lower with Microsoft.

Nope, even if MS "gave" us all the software we wanted, it still wouldn't
fix the problems. The driving force behind the Linux in Schools projects
has never been licensing costs. That is a big benefit, but it is not the
driving force. The problems I see are:

1) As noted earlier, most school's PCs are ancient. They won't run the latest-
   n-greatest MS software. There is NO HOPE of replacing these machines in 
   the near future. We have to live with what we have. What we have to live
   with is no longer supported by MS.

2) Schools are almost always cross-platform, and MS software STINKS at
   cross-platform compatibility. This causes a huge amount of headaches for
   the schools, just dealing with different versions of Word documents can be
   a nightmare

3) Windows desktops take a lot more manpower to keep running than anything
   else. Walk into any lab and 9 times out of 10 a machine with a "out of 
   order" sign on it will be a windows machine - even in predominatly Mac
   schools. The folks responsible for maintaining the labs are SICK of 
   dealing with windows problems and are often quite excited to use ANYTHING
   ELSE.

4) Every major disruption we've seen in the last two or three years has
   been due to MS bugs/security flaws.

5) Everytime we come up with a way to mitigate one of the above problems,
   MS comes up with a new way to license their software to make the "fix"
   financially impractical. Wanting TWO licenses for machines with imaged
   (such as Ghost) drives, for example. MS's licensing for their Terminal
   Services is the #1 reason I hear for failed and/or aborted deployment
   attempts.

With the exception of the last one, licensing is not a factor. Licensing is
just the straw that broke the camel's back. The fundemental problems run
much deeper.

>In short, the quote above is a perfect example of someone still clinging
>to that Microsoft pacifier.  He may not be sucking on it every day of

I don't quite get this one, it seems like grasping at straws to me,
so I'll just skip it.

>Just look at the wording in the article:
>
>"...We don't know what to believe...."

As I noted above, "we don't know what to believe". The licensing terms are
variable and murky. How does one PROVE that an ancient version of MS Works
on a donated Mac is legit? Schools are generally "open" networks, kids 
sometimes use their own laptops... how is a school to account for that?
We never get the same answer twice, assuming we ever do get an answer.
"we don't know what to believe". I've asked Microsoft executives to provide
us with PRECISE instructions on how to conduct these audits and prove 100%
whether or not compliency has been acheived. I give it a near 0% chance they
will actually provide this to us. MS uses licensing as a hammer, it's probably
in their best interest to keep it as variable and murky as possible.

>Um, why do they care?  Just embrace Open Source and you don't have to pay
>attention to Microsoft or worry about figuring them out.

We care because we have to. My whole goal in life, and the K12Linux project
in specific, is to not care. Note that the "mascot" of K12LTSP is a toaster:
http://www.riverdale.k12.or.us/linux/toaster/ ... do you really care what
brand of toaster you have? Do you have to worry about what type of plug your
toaster has or what brand of bread it is compatible with? 

Software should be a commodity. Currently it is not, but we're working like
mad to make it so. As it is today, we all have to care about Windows. In 
schools in particular, we have to care about the Mac as well. I'd much rather
not have to care about any particular product, I just want the software to
do its job at the lowest possible cost. Linux is currently the best bet to
reach this goal.

>"...suggested that Microsoft's licensing tactics were pushing them toward

>
>So Linux is something that you have to be pushed towards?!?!

Push from one side, pull from the other. One could summarize this as "we
have been implementing Linux because it solves big problems for us. Now
MS has made a couple really stupid moves which have pushed us to accelerate
our Linux efforts". Is that bad?

>"...we have to look at open-source software..."
>

Only welcome homework is worth doing? I remember most homework assignments
as being unwelcomed...

Is Linux better and cheaper than Windows? I and a large number of the
schools here in Portland and around the world are working hard on making
this true.

grip has options for both "Auto-rip on insert" and "Auto-eject after rip".  

That combination will make it so that you can just swap disks until your
whole collection is done.

Headers in unusual places are best included with custom -I flags added to
the compiler options.  You can do this by modifying the CFLAGS (or
CXXFLAGS) variable at make time.

That's actually kind of odd.  My png.h is in /usr/include directly and my
libpng.so is in /usr/lib.

I believe this is libpng-1.0.12.  I haven't updated graphical stuff in a
while, though, so no idea how old this might be.

You sure about that?  I mean, I have just over 100 packages that have
created subdirectories under /usr/include and I don't think I use special
include statements for them.

I mean, sometimes I'll have a missing header and things go nuts, but it's
just a matter of modifying a source file so that instead of a line like:
#include <header.h>

It reads:
#include <dir/header.h>

Pretty straightforward.  Have you grepped the source files for the png.h
reference?

Nah, seems silly.  Autoconfigure should be making some attempt to figure
out where your ping headers are located.

Where'd you get your libpng anyway?

Yup -- both in aumix, and KMix (I'm using KDE as my GUI), the digital
out in question is at 95% max volume -- the thing that clued me in that
it was running off the analog out is that KSCD(the KDE cdplayer)'s
volume control directly changed the analog cd volume in the mixer...

Um, the other 3 quotes plus the article title all fit the tone of this
one.

ie: comes from the Microsoft world.  OK that answers where he got his
initial bias from, why is he still keeping it?

Then Scott's quotes are even more strange.  He's been exposed to Linux, he's
seen it's usefulness.  Yet he had not one good thing to say about it in the
article.

Of course, I'll allow that it very well may have been that 95% of what
Scott said to Steve Duin was in praise of Linux and 5% was condemming
Microsoft, and Steve simply scrapped the 95%.  That is, of course, why
Steve was cc'd on this.

>Linux is the *ONLY* rational option in many cases right now. Only one choice

I've never disputed this assumption.  What I see is a situation where
clearly Open Source is superior than Windows in almost every way for most
everything.  Remember I did write a book with this very premise.  Yet,
despite this clearly demonstrated FACT, there's still a ton of foot-dragging
among the majority of corporate, government, and educational users.  And worse
is a lot of Linux supporters ignoring this and pretending that all Linux
adoptors are running full speed to Linux like it's the greatest thing since
sliced bread.  According to this article they aren't, they are being forced
and dragged kicking and screaming.

>is often bad news, even if it is Linux.

More Linux blinders.  All open source is not Linux, there's the BSDs,
remember.
Also there's freely available Solaris licenses too (or used to be although I
think that program finally went away)

There's a lot of other options besides Windows and Linux, but they are
lumped in the "It's not Windows" category.  Are you saying that if a
school district dumps Windows that all they have left is a single choice?

Microsoft never gave anything away free, not officially.  But unofficially is
a totally different story.  All DOS versions were effectively designed
to propagate themselves through pirate copies.  They even gave you the
software
and instructions to do it in the manual.  Even Win 3.1 was like
this.  They didn't even bother making a logical serial number a requirement
until Win95.  And they could have easily serialized NT and tied it into the
MAC address of the NIC card, like Sun does with it's license manager and
the MAC address for sparcstations, because there's no point to running NT
without a network.  (except for modded embedded copies would of course
would have serialization modded)

There's many, many little tricks that Microsoft could have done over the
years that would have made piracy of it's products a lot harder (not
impossible, just harder) but they did nothing until XP.  It's not surprising
that licensing is now a big hairy issue, coincidential to Windows Product
Activation.

Until the AntiTrust trial, Microsoft followed a policy that greately
encouraged
piracy of it's OS.  You may disagree but this is the same thing as giving
away copies for free.  Post-AntiTrust Microsoft suddenly realized that it
would be a good idea to make some people not run Windows anymore so the
OS market would no longer be monopolized.  Those illigitimate copies all the
sudden became a huge liability.  It's no coincidence that WPA came out AFTER
Microsoft lost the Anti-Trust trial.

For 2 decades Apple followed the "as the bough is bent so the tree grows"
logic
hoping that schools would graduate hordes of rabid Mac users that would
rise up and smash the corporate Windows dominance and create an All Mac
corporate world.  Heck they even made a commercial about it.

It never happened.

There is no proof that shoving your product down school kids throats will
result in
greater sales long term.  Ask Apple who finally had to turn to the Open Source
UNIX crowd to make sales, a-la MacOS X.

So what.  Is there now a virus that renders all Win95/MS Word 95 installs

software into nonfunctionality?

Which is a great argument for turning your back on all Microsoft software and

What is driving Microsoft out of the school market is that Linux
and FreeBSD and Open Source are simply BETTER.

Disguise it how you like to make others feel better but there's nothing that
Microsoft sales is doing that is causing this to happen.

It's Microsoft development.  To put it simply the newer and newer versions of
Microsoft software products are piggy, buggy, and offer no additional
functionality of any consequence that the older versions have.

Everyone else has recognized that Microsoft hit the area of diminishing
returns
in the Windows architecture with Win98 and Win2K.  That is why Costco has
4 piles of Win98 and 1 pile of WinXP for sale.

If current Windows was so spectacularly better than current Linux then we
wouldn't be having this discussion, instead the schools wouldn't be using
Linux at all.  At some level even the school admins recognize that Microsoft
software is legacy garbage that's holding them back, they just are too
afraid or scared or whatever to say that they are switching to Linux because
it's
lightyears better than Windows, rather than this disgusting "Microsoft is
driving me to Linux" handwringing.  Ugh, it's enough to make me throw up.

This is the heart of your problem.  Re-read your 5 reasons.  Not one is
a Linux positive, EVEN THOUGH they could be rewritten as such.  All are
sour-grapes Microsoft negatives.  Even reason 3, you use the euphamisim of
"anything else" instead of just saying "Linux" even though we all know that
MacOS Classic is a has-been that 99% of your students over age 12 probably
can't
stand.  But I guess you got to say "anything else" to not upset the retrograde
Macophiles that would come out of the woodwork and drown you with lattes
and run over you with their New Bugs if they thought you wern't including
their
precious baby.

You know, NetBSD is there for you, I've got it running on a Mac right here.
And I even heard a little voice out of that Mac saying "Thank you" when I
booted it for the first time.  Heresay I know.

You are just hating letting go of Windows aren't you!  Admit it to yourself
and the truth will set you free.  Linux is simply better than Windows.  Come
on, you can say it, see it's not that bad. ;-)

Don't you see what you are doing here?

You are simply saying that not having to care about Windows is a goal, meaning
that your not there now.  Well with this attitude you are simply
self-reinforcing
yourself that you aren't there.

YOU ARE ALREADY THERE NOW!  YOU DON'T HAVE TO CARE!!

If every single Windows system in the school district save the ones that
the kids owned were to be switched off tomorrow, would anybody die?  NOOOOOO!

All it takes is switching them off.

Say the word and I'll show up tomorrow morning and start deleting
Windows partitions on every school district owned system you have.  In
a week I will have permanently fixed your Windows licensing problem - you
simply won't have one anymore.

You can't make an omlette without breaking eggs.  You can make the fanciest
long-term gradual transition plan you want, people will still complain.  It's
like ripping the bandage off quickly or slowly.  Your trying to rip it off
a millimeter at a time and the patient is screaming to death.  Just pull the
thing off all at once and the whiners will all have to take a number to
get to you, and by the time that their turn is up, time will have made their
problem irrelevant.

People find ways to cope with any change.  Your under the mistake impression
that you are somehow morally obligated to be there for all your poor Windows
users when their toy gets taken away, and you don't realize your letting the
biggest chance in the world get away from you.  You also don't realize that if
you be there for them that they will consume all your time with their
problems.

Your chance is simple: tell all users that as of August 1st, no school
district
in Oregon will have licensing permission to run Windows.  It will be close
enough
to the truth for government work, and if YOU can't understand the Microsoft
licensing, do you think anyone else can and know the truth?

Anyway, all the politicos out there that might be a problem in an election
year are too busy with the
material given to them by the Oregonian on PERS to bother going after you
guys,
so all your going to have to deal with is the internal users that go
ballistic.
And you can brush those guys off easy by telling them that if they want to
complain then the licensing fee for the software can come out of their
budgets.
Then just transition the major stuff over which you can do over the summer.
The rest of the chicken scratch will either go away permanently, or
people in the schools (like parents) will show up to help you move things over
to Linux.  You could be finished by the end of the year.

Don't forget the lesson of Y2K.  Y2K came just the same whether you were
prepared
for it or not.  Most people wern't totally prepared for it and a lot of people
had some problems, but the Moon didn't eclipse the Sun and time didn't stand
still.
People survived.  You will too.

First sentence was what you need to be doing, too bad you wrecked it with

How about:

"we have been implementing Linux because it solves problems that Microsoft
software has never been able to solve.  We have some new problems coming up
this fall that Linux software is even better equipped to deal with so we
are accellerating our efforts to complete the transition to it."

Right, like Enron.

Don't blame startups for the stock market fiasco, blame the stock market
itself, the failure of late market capitalism to properly link profits to
productivity and employment, and the pervasive deregulation and
privatization of the public trust.

No argument there.  Management is rightly a servant class; managing
business affairs that aren't directly related to productivity.  
Unfortunately, many people in management believe they manage the
production or workers.  They exist to prevent the truly productive
employees from being distracted from the truly productive work by
unproductive processes (like time and expense reporting).

A better model than the "publicly" held corporation used today is a worker
held syndicate where decisions are made collectively on information from
designated advisors and researchers and what is today called
"management" is either eliminated or simply reclassified as "business
administration"... the generic, non-industry-specific tasks common to
whole classes of production.

> executives. Techs can be businessmen but only by exception not rule.

What is an executive?  One who executes the will of the masters?  In an
employee held company, the masters are all of the employees and they
execute their own will.  And certainly it cannot be said that a CEO is
more responsible for the execution of productive work than the men on the
factory floor.

The modern corporation is a sick creature.  It is a collective
intelligence constructed poorly and operating contrary to its own purpose.  
It is, in short, selfish and insane.

Going "public" (that is, selling your company to the same rich few that
own every other company) is nothing short of abandoning your former
business and entering the business of selling stock.  Your former industry
is now simply one asset to be taken or left at the will or whim of the
careless and thoughtless exhorbitantly wealthy.

Use your imagination, sir.  We break the cycle by stepping outside of it
and simply working.

Direct employee control (a democratized workplace; which includes and
requires a debt-free organization) resolves all of the problems of
exploitation by the wealthy.

OK, that's a bit pie-in-the-sky.  I mean, I definitely see the real
probability that the rich and powerful will find a way to destroy that
organization and anyone who uses such a model and that they have
constructed an entire economic and social system based on usury and
bribery in order to prevent such an organization from finding a foot-hold.

That's why I go back and forth between trying to help the system evolve
and advocating its wholesale destruction to make way for a new society of
freedom and democracy.

While it is true that many start-ups lacked a viable business plan, I
believe it is a big stretch to go from there to saying that executives are
"generally idiots" and it is also a contradition to then say that "a lot
of them do know business". If they know business then they are not idiots;
they simply have a profession that is different from yours and focus their
knowledge on different things than you. But I think you recognize that
overbroad generalizations such as "generally idiots is usually not a good
thing. :-)

There are pie-in-the-sky business executives who are completely
impractical and terrible managers -- and their are down-to-earth excellent
managers who really know what they are doing. I have worked for both (in
the form of small company CEOs/owners). I think most of us have worked for both.

Being a techie and being an executive require different skill sets but I
will qualify this by saying that potentially the best executives are those
who spent some time in trenches of their industry as it were. They know
how the product/service works. It seems there are two types of executives:
the pure MBA types whose speciality seems to be management and the techie
types who rose up through the ranks or have an entrepreneurial streak and
started a business.

And they manage the production of workers. A good manager makes sure that
workers are working on the *right* things in addition to being productive.
That is, he or she sets priorities that align with business/organizational
goals.

I've seen productive, hard working, talented people off working
on something they find personally interesting or satisfying rather than
what is best for the organization and its goals.

And you and anyone else who are interested in this sort of arrangement can
organize a business around these principles, right?

I think a fair number of businesses are organized around different
principles. For example, REI is a cooperative. There are food cooperatives
and community supported agricultural in many communities. There are a
number of employee owned businesses out there and people are free to set
them up as they wish.

When I lived in Olympia I volunteered at the local food coop making carrot
juice for about 4 horus per week; in return I got 25% food which was a
nice deal for good quality food. That is an example of a business model
where the customers kind of own the business and contribute to its
operation.

Can some improvements be made? Of course. That said, it is worth pointing
out that humans live better than they ever have in history of human
history. Would you trade places with any other era? If so which one and
why? If you go back in time to that era I hope you get your shots first.

Again, you and others with whom you organize, are free to setup such a
company and prove how well it works. You can choose a debt free
organization but, of couse, you should not impose that on others. Debt is
not always a bad thing. In fact, debt for investment in plant and
equipment is a good thing. For the individual, debt in order to increase
assets is usually a good thing (e.g., debt to own a home). Debt for mere
consumption of non durable goods or services is usually a bad thing. But
that should be up to the individual or business!

That is just an excuse to talk about what you think the ideal society
would be like, and not actually trying some of these models out for
yourself. The idea that one can or should transform society through
politics is a destructive notion and one that usually results in more harm
than good. It is someone having an idelogy that he or she thinks is right
and then trying to impose this ideology on everyone whether they share
this ideology or not.

You have latched on this to this idea that debt is bad and because YOU
think debt is bad, nobody should be able to lend or borrow. You want to
impose your ideas on everyone even though a vast majority of people want
the option of borrowing.

Imposing idealogy and shoe horning a new system onto society. That is the
domain of tyrants.

By far, history's worst murderers and oppressors were those who thought
that way: Stalin, Hitler, Mao, etc., etc., etc., etc.

I think the problem is that the file in question is
/usr/include/libpng/png.h, which in any rational system ought to be
/usr/include/png.h.

As our anarcho-syndicalist comrade asked, "Where did you get this

However, couldn't you just put a symlink from /usr/include to
/usr/include/libpng12:

cd /usr/include
ln -s /usr/include/libpng12/png.h png.h

Startups aren't the problem. That's what everyone is going to blame,
because it puts the blame elsewhere, makes it look like an abberation. The
problem is the system. It's the market itself, that is the problem. Once
you go public you've put yourself into a dog and pony show where the only
thing that's really important is image and often that image is determined
by the unqualified and often corrupt recommendation of analysts. And
there's so much free money at stake that everyone gets tainted with greed,
from the executives at established companies like IBM who'd rather
layoff 250 average workers than cut CEO salaries to the tech-minded
founders of the startups who took the money, knowing what would be the
real end result.

I haven't seen many competent executives in my life. Seriously. They
mostly just schmooze at meetings with other executives and get in the way
of the grunts by forcing us to spend 5 hours a week keeping detailed track
of the actual work we did.

Bingo! I've joked with my boss the last few weeks (who DIDN'T recently
institute the policy, but has to support it, of keeping track of detailed
time) that I needed them to hire an intern to look over my shoulder. I
just do too much stuff at once to accurately keep track of everything over
the course of the day. I'll spend more time tracking time than actually
working.

They seem to think they are. And many people have bought into this lie. I
don't know how many times I've had this argument with people. "The CEO is
worth 5 million, because few people can do his job." First thing, is he so
rare that he's worth THAT many times more the worker doing the actual
work? Second thing, he probably couldn't actually DO work, just talk about
it, that's why he's an executive.

No, the spirit of Godwin's law states that one must invoke a comparison
*not* merely the mention of Hitler. For example, if I said Jeme is like
Hitler because he wants to do x, y and z, then you would be justified in
invoking Godwin's law and I would take my punishment: fifty lashings with
the unabridged version of _Stranger in a Strange Land_.

Um... can I put in for the position?  I've got 8 years in military

NSA.  My TS/SCI is expired but it should be trivial to get it reinstated.

Additionally, I have the tech skills to stay alive, and I've been living in
secrecy from my so-called former friends since August when they started a
big push to get me committed.

Sadly, though, I don't believe in assassinations/violence, so you'll have to
hire somebody else to do that part.  You usually can get some local meathead
to do it for dirt cheap.

That's not what I've seen in most cases. In most cases if you've hired
professionals, then they'll be professionals.

Isn't there something in between murderous tyrants and unfettered,
screw-the-little-guy capitalism? I mean, look around you? With all the
trouble we're having in the middle east and elsewhere it should be clear
that the entire world doesn't agree with you that we live in the best
time ever. Maybe that's because they're the WORKERS and the workers get
paid pennies, especially overseas while the executives get paid millions
to make brilliant decisions like moving factories to foreign nations
where they don't have to pay a living wage or live up to environmental
standards similar to what they'd have to in the US. Capitalism is a sick
destructive beast in its own right. It's the best system humans have
devised thus far, but without protections against abuse by the wealthy
it's as bad for some people as the systems run by the tyrants you've
mentioned. It may be good for us in the US. I'm glad you're comfortabl,
but there are kids without limbs in Sierra Leone who might disagree with
your assesment.

So, once again, I ask, putting your inflammatory rhetoric aside, is it
possible to envision a system somewhere between Hitler and Stalin and
the win-at-all-costs system we have today? I'd like to think so. Problem
is, human nature and greed will always prevent us from finding it, I
fear. There's a reason the rich are rich and they aim to stay that way.
And part of the way they stay that way is by convincing the Sheeple that
anything less than unfettered capitalism puts us on the slippery slope
towards genocidal tyranny.

The education system is no place for dogma for open source nor for
proprietary software.

When I graduated from college in the early nineties, Macintoshes dominated
the education system. I used a Macintosh every day. When I went into the
work world -- well after travelling around for awhile :-) -- I found that
PCs running Microsoft DOS/Windows were dominant in the
business/orginization world. I don't think it was a good idea to have one
OS so dominant in the schools -- while at the same time another OS
was completely dominant in the business/organization world.

Part of the purpose of schools is to prepare students for the real world.
In the real world Microsoft OS's and software play a very important role
in business and you are doing a disservice to kids if
they do not get at least some exposure to Microsoft software in school. Of
course, it would be ideal if the specific OS and software were irrelevant
and kids just learned the principles but the reality is that many jobs do
require specific software knowledge.

An accountant might be required to know Quickbooks, Access, Excel, and
Word; an editor might be required to know a specific page layout package;
a clerk might be required to have a working knowledge of Windows and all
the Office software packages.

The point is that schools should provide a heterogeneous learning
environment. Yes, there should be plenty of open source software. But also
there should be some proprietary software available as well. It should be
somewhat like what is available in the real world. Students should come
out of school having learned on both open source and proprietary systems.

We, as responsible citizens, should not say to the schools, "thou shalt
use only open source" any more than we should say, "thou shalt use
proprietary software". The schools should strive to create the best
computing environment that they can with the resources they have
available, which is what I think they are doing. They have dedicated
people like Paul Nelson and Eric Harrison working on the problem. :-)

TFF... the encoding is unreadable for me... I'm sitting at an Imac, not sure how

And yes, transliteration sucks, but it's using a latin characterset, so it's
viewable.  It does mess up my brain a bit to work in it though.

Sounds like we should make an Espionage SIG or something comparable.  That way we
could all get together to discuss spy stuff in private, exchange contacts, talk
about dead letter drops, complain about Victor Suvorov.

Remember, the first rule of the Espionage SIG is that nobody talks about the
Espionage SIG.  Oh wait....

I've looked at Fry's before, in an unfocused way, and didn't see much

I have a server in my home that has no keyboard and mouse.  It has been up 
for almost a year and has survied my tile work on the floor.   It has a 
UPS and I move it when I have too.

I admin the thing using telnet and Webmin.  It serves DNS and email for my 
family.  I've nerver had a box up for more than a year so I'm  sad to have 
to re-boot this thing.

My question is there anything else that I can try to revive it?  I can not 
ping it or telnet into in since this morning.  Last night I was doing DNS 
updates using Webmin and all seemed well.

Message-ID: <005501c20727$5f7fb880$7cf397d0@imarkpdx.com>

I just set up a new machine..and assumed that SSHd would be working just
fine when I left the machine and went home. Now I am trying to access the
machine through SSHd and its refusing the connection. I only have access to
webmin right now... and was wondering if anyone knew what I could do through
webmin to help me get somewhere with this.

It's a mandrake 8.2 box. I have the mandrake security on the highest
setting, so that might be causing this. Is there anything in the .92 vers of
webmin that should help me fix this issue? Or do I need to go back to the
machine and change the security level?

from /var/log/messages:
May 29 08:31:18 penguin sshd[21358]: refused connect from

I can ftp/pop3/etc from the same machine..not sure why SSH isnt even
prompting me for a password. Putty closes before it even shows anything...

I have to respond quickly to say as a returning student in his early
30's at OIT Klamath Falls, I think Neil hits the nail pretty much head
on here.

We're *JUST* starting KLUG in our spare time. We haven't even officially
announced it at OIT yet (it is independent of OIT, though we will form a
Linux-Unix "Club" in the fall if all goes well).  Part of what we are
hoping to acheive is a middle ground, bridging the gap between the
Microsoft bashing and Microsoft dominance.  OIT's main focus uses
Microsoft technology - and for good reason since the curriculum focus is
hands-on skills useful in today's market.  Microsoft, regardless of
whether they are some evil empire or not, employs a lot of very talented
people that produce a lot of good software, albeit not without security,
bloat, and other numerous issues as discussed in many forums.  I *would*
like to see more Linux/Unix exposure and even a class on MacOS X - since
I hear they still very much rock as a multimedia machine - they sure
have a dedicated following.

My gut feeling is projects such as at www.k12ltsp.org which I'm starting
to get involved with, would stretch a given school budget allowing labs
with more low-cost workstations to give more kids exposure to the basics
of simply using a computer/gui, the concept of a directory tree and
saving a file, etc.  With the money saved, a hypothetical school could
afford a few more proprietary OS workstations, plus a handful of really
high end boxes, or something along those lines.

Subject: RE: [PLUG] RE: Steve Duin's column of 5/21/02



The education system is no place for dogma for open source nor for
proprietary software.

When I graduated from college in the early nineties, Macintoshes
dominated the education system. I used a Macintosh every day. When I
went into the work world -- well after travelling around for awhile :-)
-- I found that PCs running Microsoft DOS/Windows were dominant in the
business/orginization world. I don't think it was a good idea to have
one OS so dominant in the schools -- while at the same time another OS
was completely dominant in the business/organization world.

Part of the purpose of schools is to prepare students for the real
world. In the real world Microsoft OS's and software play a very
important role in business and you are doing a disservice to kids if
they do not get at least some exposure to Microsoft software in school.
Of course, it would be ideal if the specific OS and software were
irrelevant and kids just learned the principles but the reality is that
many jobs do require specific software knowledge.

An accountant might be required to know Quickbooks, Access, Excel, and
Word; an editor might be required to know a specific page layout
package; a clerk might be required to have a working knowledge of
Windows and all the Office software packages.

The point is that schools should provide a heterogeneous learning
environment. Yes, there should be plenty of open source software. But
also there should be some proprietary software available as well. It
should be somewhat like what is available in the real world. Students
should come out of school having learned on both open source and
proprietary systems.

We, as responsible citizens, should not say to the schools, "thou shalt
use only open source" any more than we should say, "thou shalt use
proprietary software". The schools should strive to create the best
computing environment that they can with the resources they have
available, which is what I think they are doing. They have dedicated
people like Paul Nelson and Eric Harrison working on the problem. :-)

Ah yes, that was one problem. The initial trouble was starting from console 
with no X running at all. Fixed that, then trying to start Gnome with 
gnome-session, for some reason it doesn't want to do that. Then that goobered 
things up until I logged out/ in on the screen I tried to start Gnome from. 
Now everything works. 

Now I must come up with another fun work avoidance manuever.

Are you running secure web server?  If so you can do a lot just using 
webmin.  Try using the java telnet application from webmin and then you 
can start SSH or install it from a local RPM.

Not to sound like a broken record, but the dependency issue below here 
is *exactly* why I went to Debian from RH in the first place.

apt-get install abcde

would get me every package that was required for actually being able to 
*use* abcde, and then install it.  Of course, my reasons for doing so 
were more due to hardware limitations (no cd-rom) than anything else, 
but I wouldn't dream of installing anything else on any new boxes.

But that's neither here nor there.  :)  Just my thoughts.

It's already installed... and if I run NMAP, it shows that it is running on
that machine.
Just not allowing connections.

Yes, but the managers job is to figure out and define the goals of the 
organizatation and then get everyone working toward those goals. The 
professional, occupying a sometimes narrow nitch, cannot always be 
expected to see or understand the larger picture. That is the job of the 
manager.

Are there a lot of good managers? Well, the popularity of Dilbert 
demonstrates that no there are not a lot of good managers. But when you 
get a good manager it makes all the difference in the world -- it can 
transform a business or organization dramatically for the better.

I have to call bullshit on that. If everyone who wants to make the world a 
better place took some practical steps to make it a better place, it would 
become a better place. The endless conspiracy theories and complaining 
does not make the world a better place but, in fact, makes it a worse 
place. BTW, I don't know you well enough to say whether you are someone 
who endlessly complains about the system but does not lift a finger to 
make an improvement to something that is right in front of them.

There are numerous, numerous, examples of small businesses, alternative 
businesses, cooperatives, employee owned businesses, etc., that are 
operaing and succeeding.

Yes, personally I believe that we should buy from local businesses and 
farms (through local businesses) whenever possible and build local 
community whenever possible. The difference is I believe that this can be 
achieved through making individual choices, AND the recognition that 
regardless of your political ideology you do not know what is best for 
everyone else. I do not know what is best for everyone else. In fact, 
NOBODY knows what is best for everyone! To say otherwise is the height of 
hubris! (Not that you are neccesarely saying that).

Here is a basic axiom: No individual knows what is best for society as a 
whole. Yes, yes, people routinely think they know what is best for 
everyone with their grand theories and pronouncements but they are wrong.

You can't blame the system for all the world's troubles and violence, 
which is clearly what you are doing. Some of the worst violence and 
degradation occured in the former soviet union and eastern block. Go to 
Eastern Europe and compare the pollution levels with Western Europe. The 
pollution and environmental degradation under communism was orders of 
magnitude worse than anything in the West.

Yes, it is possible to envision such a world. I myself envision such a 
world and I try to live my life according to some simple principles. But I 
would greatly resist the temptation that you seem to have that you are the 
fount of wisdom if only the ignorant sheep would listen to you tell them 
what is best for them. If I were you I would resist the temptation to 
think that way with all of your effort.

And that's not always what they do. If a manager's job is to manage, why
are they always looking for people who can "work independently without

There are numerous examples of these succeeding, I agree. And I do think
individual choices can make a difference. That's why I cycle to work,
partly why I'm vegetarian, why I shop local at New Seasons and farmers
markets and try to buy local produce. I'm all for small, local business. I
even volunteer on the side and have offered to volunteer for the schools
(although I haven't gotten a sense of how I can help yet) even though my
wife and I have chosen not to have children, knowing the world already has
enough.

So believe me, I get it. I try to live it. I don't always succeed, but I
try.

That said, I'm a pessimist. Most people don't even understand the damage
large companies are doing to the planet and to the fabric of society and I
don't think they ever will. They're too busy watching TV. Thus they don't
lift a finger or do anything when a large company bullies a smaller
company and they definitely don't shop local if it means paying a couple
extra bucks.

I'm not saying I know what's best for everyone else, but I do have eyes. I
can see what's going on and I know problems when I see them.

I didn't blame the system for ALL the world's problems, but you must be
joking if you don't think there's a connection. Once again, the
instability in the Middle East alone should be proof. Our inability to
conserve energy or to be willing to pay the price for alternative energy
has led this nation to support a number of dictators and criminals in the
Middle East. We're still supporting them now, in fact. This is just one
example and it's a huge one with rippling ramifications all across the
globe and it could probably be solved, in part, if the American people had
the willpower and the imagination to conserve or to change the way they
live their lives, but they don't. And the companies involved in the game,
the oil companies, the auto companies have a vested interest in seeing
that nothing changes, and thus, in the name of profit they push forward.

So no, I don't believe our system is the worst. But it's the dominant
system right now and it's unfettered amoral nature is pushing mankind to
the limits on many fronts. This is a fact.

I'm not the fount of wisdom, but at least I see there's a problem. At
least I have an understanding of what it is. At least I have the moral
capacity to see that keeping a large portion of the world impoverished is
wrong at best and suicidal at worst. And the fact that a majority of the
population doesn't see this or doesn't care does make them ignorant, in my
opinion.

Try this one for your second session (after the startx).  The

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205291005330.11046-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  Something changed here in the past couple of weeks, and I've no idea what
nor how to go about finding the source of the problem.

  Symptom: I cannot access digital data on the State's GIS data server. In
mozilla the attempt keeps up until I kill it. When I try going directly to
the ftp server (with ncftp or ftp) I get different results depending on how
I go about the process. Briefly,

  -- invoking ncftp then trying to 'open' the connection to the server fails
bacause the name cannot be resolved to the IP address. Same with ftp.
Invoking with the IP address works.

  -- invoking ncftp with the full path to the directory with the data I want
connects to the server and proper directory. Attempts to 'ls', 'dir' or
'get' silently kill the connection. Same with ftp.

  -- invoking ncftpget works.

  -- running 'nslookup' or 'host', today, on the domain name returns the IP
address. Didn't work yesterday.

  -- telnet to aracnet.com and log into my shell account. ncftp works like a
charm from there regardless of what approach I take to connect, cd to the
proper directory and list the files there.

  -- locally, /etc/resolve.conf hasn't changed in a very long time:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ less /etc/resolv.conf
search appl-ecosys.com aracnet.com
nameserver 216.99.193.2
nameserver 216.99.193.19

  -- I have had no problems with ncftp accessing rpmfind.net and getting
files from there, or from freshmeat.net.

  -- The firewall configuration (floppyfw) hasn't changed in the past couple
of weeks.

  I'm completely puzzled and would greatly appreciate the collective wisdom
of the group applied to this problem.

TIA,

It looks like Aracnet has two official DNS servers:

dns1.aracnet.com: 216.99.193.81
dns2.aracnet.com: 216.99.193.19

I don't know about the 216.99.193.2 host (alpha.aracnet.com). Is it a 
listed DNS server?

It sounds like DNS woes to me. What I'd do is

a. Make sure resolv.conf points to official Aracnet name servers
b. Kill all mozilla-bin processes
c. Try again

According to this page (http://www.aracnet.com/support/sysinf.html), .19
is the primary, and .2 is the secondary.  Paul, where did you come up with
.81?

Rich, the problem with ls and get failing sounds like active ftp connections
are being blocked.  Try forcing passive mode.

Webmin includes a file manager, with an editor, in the "Others" heading.

That's assuming you are running a recent version of Webmin.

that way: Stalin, Hitler, Mao, etc., etc., etc., etc."

In this case "that way" is referring to the way one party sees the other
party thinking.  Sort of implying that they think the same way as the listed
persons.


I'm not so sure that a somewhat indirect comparison of ways of thinking,
i.e. "you think like Hitler", is beyond the scope or spirit of Godwin.
Maybe, maybe not.  If it is, it's awful darn close.  Perhaps we need an
"Interpretation of Godwin" thread.  :)

  Aha! I must be out of date. I have the .2 in both /etc/resolv.conf and the
floppyfw config.

  Yeah, me too. Guess it's time to install tinyDNS here. Wonder if I can do
that this evening without messing up too badly. :-)

  Thanks, Paul.

  I'm off to get the keyboard and monitor for the firewall box so I can

IIRC, Aracnet USED to have .18 and .9 as DNS servers.  I could be wrong

I did "host <ip addr>" on both of the addresses Rich had in his 
resolv.conf file. One of them showed up as dns2.aracnet.com, so I 
thought, "Is there a dns1 or dns3, too?" Executing "host

Many of us belong to the unemployed SIG. We didn't choose to join, but
since we are unemployed, we are by default members of the unemployed
SIG. We don't have meetings, and we don't have a special mailing list
just for us. Instead we spend our days trying to get out of the
unemployed SIG. And we also spend (probably way too much) time following
this list.

With reference to the above comment:

Since there are so many of us on the unemployed SIG, brief notices of
work available are not considered SPAM. However, it stretches the
patience of the members of the list when a headhunter abuses the list
with too much detail and not enough real possibility of work. Better to
simply say, "I represent companies who need skill set x, y, z. Folks
interested should contact me at ImAHeadhunter at GetYouAJob.com."

It's possible they have separate hosts for their recursive/caching DNS
servers and for their authoritative ones, which is a security measure to
prevent cache-poisoning.  But more likely they're just fux0red.

Galen,

  Well, this is interesting. I had been using .19 and .2 (in that order)
since I upgraded floppyfw this past February. I just changed to .81 and .19
and I can now resolve the IP address from the domain name with ncftp. So,
for whatever reason, Paul's suggestion fixed that problem. However, ...
 
> Rich, the problem with ls and get failing sounds like active ftp connections

  I learned this a couple of years ago when I first got DSL and set up
floppyfw. I just checked, and ~/.ncftp/prefs_v3 has

passive=on

where the previous prefs had passive=optional.

  Passive mode is on. But, while I can now get directly to the
server/directory, I still cannot list files or get anything without silently
killing the connection.

  You two have helped tremendously so far, I eagerly await more insight.

Many thanks,

Rich

  To add more information in the hopes that it leads to clarity, I killed
all mozilla-bin processes, restarted the browser and was able to immediately
navigate to the right server/data directory. But, still no download on the
file. So, http and ftp get me there but won't allow the download or (in the
latter protocol) a directory listing.

Thanks,

  I get the same thing when I 'dig appl-ecosys.com any'. Plus, I find a MX
record pointing to mail.appl-ecosys.com but no IP address listed for that.
As a matter of fact, our static IP address isn't in the record at all. I
wonder why.

That's odd. I've seen ftp trees set up so that you can't get a file 
listing, but I don't recall that setting ever killing a connection.

Realizing you're busy, I wonder if you've tried to contact the admin 
of the site in question to see if that's a deliberate policy.

Not other than scanning the entire directory tree.  (And then you won't
catch the symlinks on NFS clients.)  Like hyperlinks in HTML, they're
one-way links.

The only thing I can think of would be to use find, searching for the text 
string of the file location in file contents.

I can't remember the syntax of the command line you'd want for that, but 
I'm sure "man find" remembers.

You can do something like

   find / -type l -printf '%p -> %l\n'

Paul,

  When I telnet'd to my aracnet shell account and invoked ncftp I could
both log in to the proper site and directory and get a listing of the files.
Just like I used to be able to do here. :-)

  Yes. We spent more than a half-hour on the phone yesterday. Couldn't

Thanks,

Emu Tools
The driver also comes with user-land tools to configure the card more
appropriately for your setup. type make tools followed by(as root) make install
to compile and install the tools.
The tools consist of 2 command-line tools: emu-config and emu-dspmgr.
emu-config is used to control special features, like setTing the card in
digital mode. emu-dspmgr is used to route inputs to outputs, or load special
audio effects.
There's also a script included which can be used to automate the configuration
without using the two programs directly, simply edit
/usr/local/etc/emu10k1-conf and set variables appropriately. Then, add the
following line to /etc/module.conf (this script will also save/restore mixer
volume settings) :

    #!/usr/bin/perl

    use File::Find;

    my ($target_dev, $target_ino) = stat shift or die "Cannot stat";
    @ARGV = qw(/) unless @ARGV;
    find sub {
      return unless my ($dev, $ino) = stat;
      return unless $dev == $target_dev and $ino == $target_ino;
      print $File::Find::name, "\n";
    }, @ARGV;

There ya go.  First arg is the file to be located. But it'll be slow,
because you have to look at EVERY file.  If you wanna narrow down the
search, add a second argument.

Rich,   it really only matters what DNS servers are specified in the
floppyfw config when you are resolving IP's from within the console of
floppyfw box.
You don't really need to bother with the peripherals/configuration until a
bigger reason comes along,  I think.

That could potentially work.  

But beyond the current crisis, I am interested in where people like to
go locally for cases.  

I am leaning towards another AOpen HX08 at the moment.  I am staring
at the guts of one right now (my "work" machine).  I might even swap
out another one of the office machines (drawback being that our
firewall is currently in the box, so it would mean some network
downtime while I get it into the other box).

  Oh. Sigh. This is an area I do not know well. Do you mean that what is in
/etc/resolv.conf here on my main server/workstation is doing all the work?
The DNS IP addresses in the floppyfw's config file are there just for the
heck of it?

> You don't really need to bother with the peripherals/configuration until a

  OK. Actually, I think I was looking for an excuse to reboot the floppyfw
box anyway. I wanted to add the line, SYSLOG_FLAGS="-m 0", so
/var/log/messages isn't filled with --- MARK --- entries from the firewall.

Many thanks,

Rich

I'd trade it for a hard drive or something,  if you should decide you're

Looks like around 13 1/4 x 13 1/2 inches of room for the motherboard.

When I was using floppyfw I was using it as a dhcp server as well and it 
would hand out the DNS servers to clients.  A while back, Pacifier changed 
their dns servers without telling me and the old ones worked for a few weeks 
until they didn't.  That sucked.  Point is, clients usually look to the 
gateway/firewall for their dns server, so it's good to have accurate info there.

For your situation, having correct DNS server IP's on your floppyfw is
just a convenience.  It's sometimes nice to see names when using ping,
traceroute, etc.

That is a good point,  and would definitetly fall under the "bigger reason"

You're reading way too much into this. The schools are addressing
Microsoft and it's short comings because they *have* to.  John Q. Public
thinks that Microsoft is the wellspring of all modern technology. Unless
the schools demonstrate publicly that Redmond's technology is inferior and
their demands unreasonable, the taxpayers and politicians will assume that
their money is being misspent.

Think of it as due diligence. He knows Microsoft can't make the cut, but
he has to give them the chance.

of a mail server here at my new job. Currently, the mail
gets put in a mailbox at our ISP (all addresses sent to
one address via a line in a virtusers file) and then the
IT guys fire up a Mac (MailAdmin) package that downloads
and disburses the email. 
I'll be setting up a email server here that'll handle the
stuff in a more modern fashion.

So, I've looked at sendmail (ick), qmail (ack!) and
postfix (ook) and I think postfix meets my needs the
best; it's fairly straightforward to set up and maintain,
it won't break anything obvious, I can use my vast
/etc/aliases knowledge to make ... aliases, et cetera.
Basically balancing "not-sendmail" with
"not-going-to-look-like-a-nidjit-when-i-biff-qmail" . 

I configured my box to use it in about an hour or so. Is
there anything not-obvious I"m going to be needing for
the setup?  I want to set up spam-assassin as well as
amavis, both of those seem to have instructions and the
like.  

Tips welcomed :)

  Thanks, Galen. I suppose I need to buy and read the ORA "BIND" book to
fill in this big gap in my knowledge.

  I did a bit more changing and exploring but to no avail. In
/etc/resolv.conf I put in all three aracnet name servers, in order: ns, ns2,
ns3. Then I tested.

  With both ncftp and ftp, I can get to ftp.sscgis.state.or.us and cd to
/pub/data/statewide/k24/, but that's it. Can't do anything else. With ftp I
see

ftp> ls
200 PORT command successful.

and there it sits.

  Passive mode is on in both ncftp and ftp.

  So, what do I test now to try to isolate the problem? All this happened in
the past couple of weeks and I've not made major system changes between then
and now. Not deliberately, anyway. :-)

Thanks,

Rich

Works for me with /usr/bin/ftp in non-passive and passive mode on two
systems from behind different firewalls.  This doesn't look like a DNS
problem to me.

  A few thoughts.

  The Postfix book is a useful reference. I found it both helpful and
informative -- once past the first chapter on "What is electronic mail?".

  Did you get caught by postfix wanting a fully-qualified host name to
install, but other tools wanting only the hostname? Before installing
postfix run 'hostname <fq.h.n>', then install. After postfix is up and
running, run 'hostname <host>' and put it back to normal.

  If you're running on a Red Hat or similar system, Simon Mudd's rpms are
the way to go. Not only does it make installation easy, but it puts all the
init files where they need to be.

  The main.cf contains a place holder for 'smtpd_sender_restrictions='.
Replace that with 'smtpd_recipient_restrictions='; Ed told me it's the
preferred way to go. Also, be aware of the order of filters there. Here's
mine:

smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
        permit_mynetworks,
        check_client_access hash:/etc/postfix/badip,
        check_client_access hash:/etc/postfix/badaddr,
        check_relay_domains
header_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/header_checks
body_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/body_checks

  The key points are: 'permit_mynetworks' must come first and
'check_relay_domains' must come last. As you can see, I apportion spam
checking across four files here (plus the access.db):

	badip 		All the IP addresses I want rejected.
	badaddr		All the domain names I want rejected.
	header_checks	Key words and phrases found in spam headers.
	body_checks	Key words and phrases found in spam message bodies.
The access file is a huge regex list (~2M) of spoofed addresses and other
known spam indicators as collected in real time by a site in The
Netherlands. I download a new one every few weeks and hash it into
access.db.

  Every time you make a change to the mail filters or config files, remember
to run '/usr/sbin/postfix reload'.

  Some place I saw that someone had put together instructions for attaching
spamassassin under postfix, so it's out there to be found again. :-)

HTH,

Rich

Hey,
You've got it completely wrong.

The description of this is similar to a problem I occasionally have.
My firewall is only configured to pass one of the two FTP protocols
(passive or active, I can't remember which), and whenever I connect to
a server that only supports the protocol which my firewall blocks, it
successfully logs in, but transfers just hang until they time out.
Maybe your problem is related?

Shannon,

  Could be. In this case, however, I do believe that passive mode is
required. What I learned at the ncftp web site when I installed the DSL and
firewall a few years ago is that I need to use passive mode so my client can
dictate the ports to use so my firewall won't block them.

  The tech at the State's site in Salem also asked me to ensure that passive
mode was on. Now, I discover that I cannot get to ftp.redhat.com to download
files, either.

  It was suggested to me a couple of weeks ago that I take out inetd because
I'm not running any of the r* tools. I'm wondering if this has something to
do with the problem.

  The last time I faced this it was an active/passive mode issue and setting
passive=on in ~/.ncftp/prefs_v3 solved that problem.

  I'm reading the ORA TCP/IP book now to learn how to use tcpdump (thanks,
Galen!). I'll see what that does.

Thanks,

Rich

While I recognize and respect the invocation of Godwin, I do need to clear
up two tiny points.

On Wed, 29 May 2002, Neil Anuskiewicz wrote:

You're conflating two things that have nothing at all to do with one
another, though they are linked in the typical (and broken) structures
seen in commerce today; management and prioritization.

Certainly a manager is a person that helps focus the production of
workers, but there is absolutely no reason why that same person should be
deciding where that focus should be.  The priorities of the organization
should rightly be set by the organization as a whole.

And what follows is a sequence from Neil that I'll subtitle "variations on
a theme":

Just so y'all who might be critical readers can note, Neil pulled this
allegation of imposing ideals and restricting the freedom of others from
thin air.  You'll find no such proposition in my message.

Paranoia can be a really good thing, but you should know when you're
fighting the enemy and when you're just tilting and windmills.

Message-ID: <200205300116.g4U1GCm19334@paper-wolf-solo.tigerfood.org>

If you do a find by symlink referent then you'll also have
to worry about indirect links: X is a symlink to Y is a
symlink to Z.

One way of handling this is to let the OS do the equivalency
testing for you:

    find / -type l -print0 |
      perl -0ne '
        BEGIN {
          ($dev, $ino) = stat ("targetfile");
        }
        ($d, $i) = stat ($_);
        if ($d == $dev && $i == $ino) {
          print $_, "\n";
        }
     '

I didn't test that; there's probably two bugs in it.  This
is quick to program, but slow to run, because stat is a
relatively expensive operation.

Faster to run but slower to program (and debug) is to do
pathname manipulation yourself.  readlink the result of
find, figure out the real no-symlink pathname, and do a
string compare.  This is also less portable; some Unix-y
variants have magic symlink names that get expanded
specially by the kernel.

I think it's because they're multi-threaded. Linux displays threads as 
processes and I think if you look at the process sizes I think you'll 
see they're all identical in size. "top" is a good tool to see the 
process size information.

  Ah, Jeff! You took the question right out of my fingers. :)

  In one v.t. I ran:  /usr/sbin/tcpdump -a host salmo > dump.log. In another
v.t. I ran an ncftp session; first connecting to ftp.sscgis.state.or.us,
then cd'ing to /pub/data/statewide/k24/, then asking for a listing (ls).

  Since you asked, the gzipped dump.log is attached (it's 73.2K naked). I
cannot interpret it, but someone more guru than I can, I'm sure.

Thanks,

Tony,

  Well, that makes sense. Not being familiar with threaded applications I
would have thought that threads would be created as needed, not initially.

Thank you very much,

If your ISP is handling DNS for your domain, you'll need to coordinate
with them so at the appropriate time they'll change the DNS MX record
for your domain to point at your new mail server.

Before that happens, it helps to know how to talk to mailer daemons via
a telnet session to test things out:

The other packages to which I refer are just looking for png.h, which is
proper.  Shannon, I mislead you.  My png header is in
/usr/include/libpng12/, and that _directory_ is linked as
/usr/include/libpng/.  I'm not sure why that is.  This is version 1.2.2,
which I believe I downloaded from libpng.org.  The .so is in /usr/lib,
where it should be.  Only the header is misplaced, but that link is just
funky enough to make me think there's some reason for it all. . . .

But Jeme, didn't you just suggest I do that?  On the other hand, Mr.
Fleck suggests just symlinking the deviant header in /usr/include.  This
is why I'm asking what's the best practice:  should I add the symlink or
maybe add that compiler flag in my profile, so I don't have to keep
doing it?

That wasn't an optimal format for analysis.  Try:

instead.  Or even:

  tcpdump host ftp.sscgis.state.or.us -s 1500 -w /tmp/dump.log

I had already seen this, and the relevant line from emu10k1-conf is:

Hmm - well as Linux is free and the taxpayers and politicians are not giving
money to the schools anymore, I don't see as though the taxpayers and
politicians have any control left here.

You heard what the man said - PPS is working off the very last of it's 1995
bond money.  After that's spent, there ain't no more, and from that point on,
the schools can do what they want and the public has no control anymore.
What are they going to do?  Tell the schools they won't pay for new
Linux installs?  Haw Haw Haw!

>Think of it as due diligence. He knows Microsoft can't make the cut, but

Sorry no he doesen't.  Microsoft had their chance and demonstrated that they
can't do it.  The districts aren't answerable to the taxpayers anymore in
this area because the taxpayers have stopped paying for software.

It's like when the taxpayers stopped paying for music education.  Years back
when they still paid for elementary school music, if a taxpayer decided they
wanted a change in music education, they could tell the school to change it
and the school had to do it.

Today, the kids get music education paid for by their parents, and no taxpayer
has any ability to change any other kid's music education one iota.

When you stop paying for things you give up control over them.  The Oregon
taxpayers haven't yet stopped patting themselves on the back over how much
money they have shortchanged the schools to realize this yet.  But they will.

The point was already made by Eric Harrison that there isn't any money
left to save.  They won't have any money to spend on high end boxes,
because there's no money.  Either they get the Linux lab you described
or they get nothing at all.

It has never bothered the schools in the past that they don't prepare the
students for the real world, why change now?  In fact one of the basic
tenants of a Liberal Arts education is that the individual is taught
how to teach themselves and be flexible for any new situation.

And the corporations that need these skills can pay people to learn
them.  Why make the majority of students learn all this when they won't end
up using it?

Or perhaps neither.

Part of the problem of setting the schools up to mimic the "real world" is
that the "real world" is so varied.  Plus that, there's a lot of professions
that people work in which might not be particularly "accepted" in an
academic environment.

For example, let's say we accept your premise that the schools should teach
students to go to work in jobs.  Now, the question is, what jobs?

If you limit the "accepted" jobs to "office environment" type jobs the problem
is that the majority of jobs in the world don't happen to be office jobs.
Surprise Surprise!

So let's say your going to be fair and not discriminate and say "all jobs"

Well, acting is a profession - are you going to argue that actors need to
know how to use an operating system?  Yeah right.  How about porno stars?
Some of those bright faced kiddies that graduate every year are going to end
up doing that for a living - there's nothing illegal about that, but are you
going to discriminate against that?

And hoo-boy, what about religion?!?!  What about all those kiddies that are
going to graduate and go on to become ministers and priests?!?  Well we can't
have any of THAT in the public schools, so strike another profession!!

Surely you can see that this premise is impossible.  We can no more demand
that students be brought up with a knowledge of operating systems than
we can demand that they be brought up with a knowledge of internal combustion
engines.  They are going to use the internal combustion engine as much
or more than the computer.

>We, as responsible citizens, should not say to the schools, "thou shalt
>use only open source" any more than we should say, "thou shalt use
>proprietary software".

But as Eric has pointed out, we are doing just that.  By starving the schools
of cash, we are "forcing" them to go to Open Source.  That's the entire
premise of Steve Duin's articles I think.

So, I guess your a Kitzhaber supporter then?  Shall we raise the state income
tax to give the schools the funding to be able to choose what OS's to run?

Yes, but not fast enough.  The schools need a solution NOW now 3-6 years
from now.

That won't work too well. Years ago I remember a general manager who had a 
desk plaque with a phrase which he made sure all applicants/interviewees saw:

"You don't get trained here, you get here trained."

Otherwise I (mech. engr.) could pound on doors and say 'I wanna learn to be a

I have your root password so I can play & learn?'

   Hey, Eric and Paul Nelson put uncalculable amount of man-hours into
   Linuxising Portland schools and doing this was not easy. I don't
   think that thair primary motives were ego driven and me thinks they
   and whoever helped them are fine people.  It brings Alternative OS
   and Open Source great exposure in some ways.  My hat is off.

   As for the propaganda arguments many of them are arguable.
   Like the one that infiltrating schools by Apple or RedHat products
   is benefitiary for the vendours in the long rung. Apple's cause is
   lost at the moment, so it's a poor argument that simply backfires.
   I am not going to expand on what pile of crap Mac OS has become :).
   Even that beautiful candy wrapper can not hide this.
   How many car owners know exactly how their valves are timed or how
   the fuel injectors are controlled? All they care about is the looks
   and price and sometimes functionality. Image rules in this culture.

   I for one can not figure out why they decided to switch MSFT
   dependecy to RHAT: one company is no better than another, with all
   the version control and continuity issues I'd think Debian would do
   better. But I am sure thay had their reasons.
   OTOH they need to fill summer with something<g>.
   They may even go as far as including an experimental FreeBSD

It's not that there is no money, its that there is less money and it matters
how the money is allocated.

For all of the schools I work with, hardware and software come out of the
general fund. The vast majority of the general fund goes to teachers salaries.
The net effect is that for every ~$50K/yr more spend on technology means one
less teacher.

It would be nice if it was as simple as "use Linux" or "nothing", but that's
not the reality. Converting between technologies is expensive, it takes techs
to do the work, it takes training. All of which cost money and divert resources
from other areas, such as teaching kids. In the short-term, if we can hold
tight with existing infrastructure, we do. In the long-run, it is obviously
in our best interest to move away from the mess that we are in today.

Heh, it just works, drop a music cd in, and it starts rippin', when it's 
ready to encode it sends it to my dual proc machine, and puts in all in the 
right places, very kewl.

I daemonized abcde on my file server and daemonized distmp3host on my dual 
proc box.

If anyone is interested let me know.


Now I just need a bigger hd for mp3's

Well the reason that I liked this option is because my mp3 ripper is a 
headless machine, that's also my file server.  So running a gui (even 
remotely) wasn't something I wanted to do.

Well it all works now except that the files are owned by root and not
readable by anyone, I'll have to figure out a fix for that.

But it seems that either way the kids are going to get screwed, at least
this year's students.  On one hand you got enormous licensing cost increases
if you stick with Microsoft.  On the other hand, you got enormous conversion
costs if you just go ahead and do it.

If I were you I'd be scared to death of this apparent "lull in the war" that
seems to be Microsoft backing off from a conflict by shitcanning the audits.
You know that company just never lets up.  They haven't forgotten their
bloody nose over this, they have just crawled back under their rock and are
brewing up some new devilry that's ten times worse than the audits.  A year
from now if you don't dump MS software now, your going to be wishing you
had never fought them on the auditing, because they will be eating you alive.
And the next time they come back after you, they won't be sending in the
amateurs.

>In the short-term, if we can hold

But you can't.  Microsoft is going to let you think you can and get
complacent,
then just when you start breathing easier they are going to come back and
SPLAT your going to be bugkill on the MS windshield.

Get off the .NET now, while you still can get out alive!!

In part this is true, but only in part. Ted, you seem to consistantly 
ignore the other parts of the equation. The K12Linux project has been
going strong now for many years, the origin of these efforts were not
related to funding. Now that we are in a funding crunch, efforts have
been accerating. Now that the Total Cost of Ownership of "competing"
software is rising rapidly, compounding the funding crunch, things are
moving as fast as possible. All of this is built on the solid foundation
laid down years ago.

Steve Duin's articles do focus on specific aspects of the over-all issue.
But that's not the whole story and it's not the sole factor in the decisions
being made.

The worse thing I can imagine is trying to cram in a "solution" NOW.
It would be a disaster beyond my comprehension.

One of the strong influences from the "liberal arts" portion of my education
was a speech given by Francis Sparshott (a Canadian philosopher) titled
"Nothing to Say" (I've never found it online, you might find it at the
library ;-). The jist of speech was that it is foolish at best to argue
why something is wrong unless you first understand why it is right. From
my notes I have this quote:

   "Karl Marx once said that philosophers had sought to understand the
    world this way or that, but the point is, he said, to change it. Many
    people quote this remark with approval, so there are obviously a lot of 
    people around who think it is a good idea to change things without
    understanding them. The history of revolutions and their aftermaths in
    this century provides bitter food for thought here"


I'd prefer that the aftermath of our revolution is not classified as "bitter".

You might want to read up more on the subject. There is no "lull in the war".
We, meaning both schools and business in this case, can probably survive
about two years or so on current investments in MS software. We can buy
into the "software assurance" or "school agreement" or what ever they want
to call it, or we can use those two years to get rid of MS software in an
orderly fashion. Surveys and the press seem to indicate that a large percentage
of businesses are opting for the later. I can verify that many school are
opting for the later.

Complacent? "we'll let our existing bits rot while we do the development,
infrastructure, and training to get rid of it" is not complacency.

We have many years of hard work into this. We have a very good understanding
of where we are at and where we are going.

Figured out the missing piece was to supply vendor and model to the modprobe 
command ie,
	modprobe scanner vendor=0x04b8 product=0x0110

I had been under the assumption that scanner.o would magically know what 
scanner was attached.

Andrew, did you get your setup working?  If you really need the new 
scanner.c and scanner.h files you mentioned, they replace those of the same 
names in your kernel source tree (drivers/usb/).  Of course, you'll need to 
recompile your kernel.  Well, since you only need the scanner.o module, I 
think you might be able to get away with

	make oldconfig && make modules && make modules_install

But perhaps not, if you're using RH's OEM kernel-source rpm you might have 
to start from the beginning.

Night and day difference between MSFT & RHAT. In the latest-greatest
build of the K12Linux distro, we've almost completely seperated our changes 
from the core distribution. In need to double check, but I'm pretty sure
that everything we've added is now GPL (maybe some Artistic and/or BSD).

I could port everything to Debian or FreeBSD in a couple of hours. I've
encouraged ports, but no one's done it yet. It's more work than you'd 
expect.

The big trick is in getting everything to work smoothly by default. I found
that for the conflicting objectives we needed to achieve, Red Hat was the
closest. From our testing, teachers have a really hard time installing 
Debian - it's just too geeky for them.

Plus, we begged and pleaded all of the different vendors to help us. Red Hat
has been giving us support since 1997. No other vendor has helped in a 
significant fashion. Things were starting to roll at Mandrake, then they
fired everyone I knew that worked there :-(

One upon a time Microsoft software WAS right.  The PC revolution would
never have gotten off the ground if it wern't for it.

But it stopped being right years ago because as the old saying goes,
absolute power corrupts absolutely.  It's been far too long since any
of Microsoft's products have been sculpted by the knife of competition.

I knew this a decade ago and as far back as 1994 I have a published article
on OS/2 that stats flat out that it's superior to Windows.  I've a mind
to ask you what you were doing in the industry then?  Had you even heard
of the UNIX detoxification program and were you aware of what the
Open Source community was striving for even then?

I've been implementing Open Source long before most people knew what it was,
and long before the term was coined.

"Our Revolution" is an apt description. But when have you ever read of
a revolution in which someone wasn't hurt?  Your kidding yourself if you
think that you can go gradually so as to leave no bitterness.

No, actually it didn't - until now.  Metadiscussions are pointless.

over the next few years, heh heh heh.

I'm really fuckin' sick of this tired old assertion.  Hell, we could say
that the civil rights movement never would have gotten off the ground
without the Holocaust.  It's all just so much hooey and retrospective
rationalization.

Things would have been DIFFERENT without Microsoft, but not in any
particular way that you can say with certainty.

And it's been even longer since the value and quality of human life and
experience has been increased by the ever full larder of cooperation.

"Open Source" can bite me.  If it's not Free Software, it might as well be
a license to steal and exploit.

I cannot get over how many people have bought this BS.  Microsoft/Intel
has stifled computing for almost 20 years.

In 83 I had a complete computer in a keyboard.  Vic-20  The form factors
would have gotten so small by now if not for Wintel computing would be
totally pervasive.  We would not even be talking about this.  We would
be way beyond it.

Subject: [PLUG] Judge tell MS to pound sand re Lindows
Message-ID: <20020530144942.3133434B52@ados.com>

A fun read:

http://www.net2.com/lindows/

The more detailed story:

http://www.net2.com/Reconsideration_Denied.pdf

Selected fun bits:

"Microsoft's argument also ignores its own analysis of the Defendant's 
evidence, which shows repeated references to the composite terms 'window 
manager,' 'windowing environment,' 'windows programs' and several others."

"Through its own use of the evidence, Microsoft essentially admits that these 
terms refer to the genus of computer software products that have windowing 
capability."

Let's see - YOUR text uses 'windows' as a generic, but you're trying to tell 
OTHER people they can't?

Also:

"While the court agrees that the Windows mark has acquired secondary meaning, 
no degree of secondary meaning will save a generic mark... no matter how much 
money or effort it pours into promoting the sale of the merchandise ... 
otherwise a manufacturer could remove a common descriptive word from the 
public domain..."

Approximately 50% of Oregon's state budget goes to education! It is the 
single largest item in the budget. You could look at any state in the 
union and education will be the largest budget item and will be more or 
less 50% of the budget.

As Eric pointed out, each $50,000 spent on IT is one less teacher. Since 
study after study has shown that class size directly affects learning, 
taking away a teacher to spend money on IT is a big deal.

Eric and others recognize this tradeoff and the need to stretch their IT 
dollars. They recognize that open source will be a big part of the 
solution to this dilemna. In fact, they are taking the ball and running 
with it: http://www.k12ltsp.org/

This is what school districts will end up saying to Microsoft: "We are 
sorry but we cannot afford to give up 10 teachers to pay your licensing 
fees. Our mandate is to educate children." The public relations 
and political fallout from that conversation -- and the realization that 
they are losing market share in schools to open source -- will cause 
Microsoft to backpeddle on aggressive licensing schemes.

The next thing you will hear will be Bill Gates announcing a new 
initiative: Microsoft will donate software and hardware to public schools 
and schools will not have to pay any licensing fees.

> So, I guess your a Kitzhaber supporter then?  Shall we raise the state income

Education is a HUGE political issue and I bet that it will be front and 
center in the coming governor's race.

Well, if you've got one mozilla window open, it's likely that there is a 
thread for network activity, one thread for rendering, and one thread for 
handling your typing/clicking.  I'm sure there are more.  :)

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL & URGENT.

I am Mr, Joseph Edward a native of Cape Town in
South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with
the
South Africa MINISTRY OF MINERAL RESOURCES AND ENERGY 
First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to
reach you for a transaction/business of this
magnitude, but this is due to
Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this
medium. 

I have decided to seek a confidential
co-operation with you in the execution of the deal
described Hereunder for the benefit of all parties
and
hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the
nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources
where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the
cooperation of four other top officials, we have in
our possession as overdue payment bills totaling
Twenty - One Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S.
Dollars ($21,500,000.) which we want to transfer
abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a
foreign company/individual to receive the said fund
on
our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account
to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in
the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service
Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore
account hence your importance in the whole
transaction.
This amount $21.5m represents the balance of the
total
contract value executed on behalf of my Department by
a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials
over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual
contract
cost have been paid to the original contractor,
leaving the balance in the Tune of the said amount
which we have in principles gotten approval to remit
by Key tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any
foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an
application through the Justice Ministry here in
South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of
the former contractor to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to
propose that should you be willing to assist us in
the
transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the
$21.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and
miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100%
safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of
specialization is not a hindrance to the successful
execution of this transaction. I have reposed my
confidence in you and hope that you will not
disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately my
e-mail address whether or not you are
interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout
for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want
to assure you that my partners and myself are in a
position to make the payment of this claim possible
provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and
guarantee that our share will be secured and please
remember to treat this matter as very confidential
matter, because we will not comprehend with any form
of exposure as we are still in active Government
Service and remember once again that time is of the
essence in this business.
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Yours faithfully,
JOSEPH EDWARD

  Thank you, Kees. I've never written a threaded application so while I

  Woo-hoo! So much for mailman and confirmed subsciptions eliminating mail
list spam.

  This scam has been going around for years and I've seen at least a
half-dozen varieties in the past fortnight.

  It's rather reassuring to know that PT Barnum's dictum still holds in the
21st Century.

I wonder if PLUG can use this money proposed by this f***ing spammer.

	I want to go off here... I took a Mac OSX Admin Basics training
class last week. And OH MY GOD... I am in love! That is the slickest OS
I've ever seen. The only real problem I see, and this is more my
prefrence, is that while based on BSD, it still like learning a new Unix
system, some things I'm used to doing aren't available, like I can't get
vipw to work. Some of the device nodes are non-existant in single-user
mode, so you can't mount a CDRom. Just little things. Now... I just need
to figure out how to afford a Mac. :)

I don't think it's entirely necessary to get on people so hard for not 
editing a single message, Russell.

Some of us are at work, have other things on our mind, forget, etc etc 
etc.  Maybe a little nicer approach - or maybe less *public* reminder - 
would suffice, hmm?

Since I'm using an internal web site for access to my mp3's, I've been
setting the ownership of my ripped files to nobody. I haven't automated
the process, but if I created a script to do the ripping and encoding, I
could just add chown to the end of the script. Would something like that
help in your situation?

Hmmm, since I can post from an address that isn't on the subscribed 
members list, mayhaps we have a list configuration error?  That would 
definitely be why we're getting spammed from outside sources.

Yeah, unfortunately, it's also why we've managed to have conversations

On the old list setup, people forwarded and cc:ed for people not on the

Subject: [PLUG] What is on-topic
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0205300955490.23695-100000@localhost.localdomain>


The current discussion titled "Steve Duin's column of 
5/21/02" is definately *on* topic. While the discussion ranges beyond just 
Linux, it is largely a discussion of Open Source (including Linux) vs. 
priorietary software in the schools and the economics and politics thereof.

My feeling is that discussions like this are exactly what makes this list 
interesting! There are obviously a number of others who agree with me. I 
don't think we need a cadre of self-elected list enforcers who think it is 
their duty to complain about any thread in which they are not interested 
or is not about Linux without context.

That said, I do think that a thread that is *completely* un-related to 
Linux or open source is fair game for complaints. Threads will drift and 
when they cross the line into territory that is completely unrelated to 
open source, then the courtious thing to do is to end the discussion. 
Threads purely about politics clearly fit this criteria.

But, that said, I think that some thread drift is acceptable as long as 
either the thread returns to an on-topic status or ends fairly soon after 
it drifts off topic.

Pulleeze. What a load of crap. This might work on the BSD list but
it takes courage to try to peddle it here. Some of here were already
grownups in the early 80s and we lived it first hand. The revolution
was well under way. If it wasn't Microsoft it would have been
someone else. We had IBM, Digital Research, the UCSD folks, and on
and on.

Absolutely. The Microsoft and Intel monopolies have killed off
technologies that would have put us so much further ahead.
Microsoft and Intel didn't lead the revolution. They shackled it.

Remember 100VG AnyLAN? Better in every important way than Fast Ethernet.
Intel killed it. Of course, HP's lackluster marketing didn't help.

The Motorola processors were _so much_ better in the 1980s than the
Intel CPU with its silly segmented memory architecture. It took
Intel about 10 years to catch up. I recall a line from that era: "There
are two kinds of programmers: those that hate segmented memory
architecture and liars."

PC architecture is >20 years old and it shows. Anyone who has to
deal with the limitations of the Master Boot Record knows this.
This antique architecture is only kept alive by marketplace
enthusiasm created by the current monopoly.

We could have been George Jetson by now by Microsoft keeps us closer
to Fred Flintstone.

Message-ID: <51AE6EA505FCD111AB5600805F653ACB010AA154@EXCHANGE>

OK, here's my summary of this argument, as far as I can tell:


Eric (and others) are working hard on a project that can help migrate
schools from MS solutions.  Which isn't exactly a small task.

Ted thinks it isn't happening fast enough for various reasons, and wants a
mass migration done NOW.  And feels quite strongly about it.


Solution:

Eric keeps working at what he is good at.

Ted appears to be good at debate, and arguing for major changes.


So quit arguing with Eric already, and go talk to certain persons up for
elections, where it might actually do some good.  (Arguing here just takes
time away from someone who is already working on it, whether it be quick
enough for you or not.)

Tell these candidates how they can propose helping out school budgets.  (And
if you actually want anything to happen, talk to BOTH parties, whether you
like them or not.  So you don't get screwed if the one you talked to
looses.)

Show up at some board meetings and bring it up.  Even if it doesn't go
anywhere, it'll put ideas (and questions) in the heads of people that
weren't there before.

Heck, try to get a meeting with the state superintendent.  Say the magic
words "I think my idea can save our schools a lot of money."  And have a
dollar figure ready, if you can.  If you get snubbed, tell Mr. Duin about
it, and see if he wants to write another article. :)

In other words, rather than complain about what others are doing about it,
do something.  Use your talents towards the goal, rather than debate with
other players about their own chosen strategy.


Ted, I'm not meaning to attack your ideas or anything.  (In fact quite the
contrary.)  I just think it would be more valuable applied in a different
direction.

The problem is that Ted says different things in different forums.
He was very critical and insulting of those of us who organized
Linux demonstrations for educators last month. He called us idiots.
When we tried to respond to his criticisms in the forum that he
apparently controls, he censored our comments.

I think the only truly good ideas are Ted's ideas - in his mind
anyway.

The thread in question had very little to do with philosophy. It was about
open source vs. proprietary software (including Linux) in the schools. It
was on topic and an interesting and timely topic as important to Linux and
the future of Linux as anything else discussed here.

With all due respect Carla, the list is not just for what you came to
talk about it is also about what interests others. I routinely delete those
emails that don't interest me and read the ones that do interest me. I
recommend that you do the same.

Carla isn't the only one who's been wondering when this will die or move off the 
main list. 

Could it be that a topic is far enough off-topic when that is suggested by other 
list readers?

It's been too philosophical for me, too. It helps that I filter list traffice by

OpenOffice.org Hits the Big 1.0
By Eric Foster-Johnson

In announcing OpenOffice.org 1.0 (http://itw.itworld.com/GoNow/a14724a59108a76073993a14 Linux
gains another production-quality open source office suite. Reaching the
1.0 release is a big event, even if the OpenOffice.org version 1.0
corresponds to Sun's StarOffice 6.0. OpenOffice.org provides a totally
free office suite on par with Microsoft Office that runs on Linux.

The entire suite includes a word processor, spreadsheet, drawing
program, presentation program, and a whole lot more. The suite is
available for Linux on Intel, Linux on PowerPC, Solaris, and Windows --
a MacOS X port is also in the works. The wide array of available
platforms constitutes one of the OpenOffice.org software's great
appeals, providing a starting point for migrating Windows users to open
source software. Once your users run the OpenOffice.org suite, you can
then discuss migrating user desktops to Linux if appropriate for your
site.

The OpenOffice.org suite has been around for some time and forms the
base for Sun's StarOffice suite. StarOffice
(http://itw.itworld.com/GoNow/a14724a59108a76073993a12 adds some features beyond the free,
open source OpenOffice.org suite, including fee-based support and a
database module. You can download the free OpenOffice.org suite from
http://itw.itworld.com/GoNow/a14724a59108a76073993a2

The project site has a press section on their Web page, which even
includes a Flash presentation, indicates a serious effort to promote
OpenOffice.org 1.0. OpenOffice.org's public relations effort describes
the suite as a near drop-in replacement for Microsoft Office.
OpenOffice.org does a reasonable but not perfect job at loading and
saving Microsoft Office document file formats.

Much of the promotional effort demonstrates OpenOffice.org's lower total
cost of ownership (TCO) over Microsoft Office, highlighted by
OpenOffice.org's free distribution. Being free eliminates the costly
licenses and upgrade costs.

A Gartner Group estimate claims that StarOffice (and presumable
OpenOffice.org) can wrest up to 10 percent of the Microsoft Office
market share. Gartner's estimate is an incredible amount of market
share, but also indicates Microsoft's dominance of this market. In part,
this estimate stems from the fact that Sun plans to charge for
StarOffice 6.0 on Linux and Windows. The assumption is that businesses
would prefer to pay for software and the new fees will increase
StarOffice's usage.

If you are not using OpenOffice.org or StarOffice, you really should
take a look at these suites. They are not perfect and require a good bit
of RAM, but on the whole are great products. Questions about
OpenOffice.org can be answered by the slew of frequently-asked-questions
(FAQ) lists at http://itw.itworld.com/GoNow/a14724a59108a76073993a11

I, too, feel that some topics get beat to death on the
main PLUG list.  But, as a thread descends into good/evil,
debian/redhat, or (heaven forbid!) vi/emacs, it can be
difficult to know when to migrate it to PLUG-TALK.  
It's not hard to change the "To:" address to add the
5 additional "-talk" characters -- and usually, once 
one party in the midst of a thread does it, the move
sets in pretty well.

The one's that tend to peeve me ... are messages posted to
the main list with "Off-Topic" right there in the subject. 

My $.02.

And a number of people enjoyed reading and participating in the thread.
You happened not to like it. So what?

So any individual can decide when a topic is off-topic just by saying so?

You are making the same argument as Carla: I did not like the thread
therefore it is off topic.

I am denfending this thread because I believe that the politics,
economics, and yes, even philosophy around open source is on-topic here.
Discussion even passionate disagreement about these matters is good.

Yours and others argument that this is off-topic amount to your personal
tastes and interests. You want to focus on narrow technical issues which
is fine, while others want to talk about broader issues from time to time.
So what?

But Neil, when I subscribed to plug, it was because this was the technical
list. I did not sign up, nor have I, for the plug-talk list because I don't
have the time to wade through messages that are of no relevance to me or to
which I cannot contribute. None of the last of this thread engaged either of
those two facets for me. It was off-topic. It should have moved to plug-talk
long ago.

Several very good contributors have left this list because of the declining
return on investment. And that's due to the degrading signal to noise ratio
of diatribe exactly like this. Let's keep this the tech list and just keep
the OT stuff to a minimum. Sure it's gonna happen again but we really need
to police ourselves and move the OT threads on our own.

At the risk of prolonging this off-topic thread, I'd like to focus on
this popular opinion -- & note that it falls into the catagory of beliefs
that are ``not proven". That is, not necessarily true, but not necessarily
false either. No one has ever done the research & written a detailed
history of the minicomputer/personal computer industry after, say, 1981.

Freiberger & Swane's _Fire in the Valley_ effectively ends with Apple's
launch of the Macintosh; the second edition does add material taking the
narrative up to the late 1990's, but it's not as rich as detail as the
earlier chapters. And the anti-Microsoft bias of the book (MS is only
mentioned when the authors could not avoid it: there is no account of
how MS bought up smaller companies in the 1980's, nor much of what Gates &
Allen did thru the 1970's; all we hear about is their selling a BASIC
interpreter to the makers of the Altair, & selling QDOS -- later MSDOS --
to IBM) hampers us from understanding just how Microsoft got to be the
largest software company. And sorry, but stating that MS ``broke the
law" doesn't explain it to me in sufficient detail. Nor does saying
``the other companies weren't as efficient."

When students look to the history of the PC industry, it is after
Microsoft consolidated its hold. Randall Stross's book, _The Microsoft
Way_, is a fascinating look at the MS corporate culture, but he
intentionally begins his narrative after Windows 3.1 was released. This
book is a true business history, & offers much substantive detail,
unlike books like Jim Clark's _Netscape Time_ or Kara Swisher's _aol.com_.

We all have our opinions about how the PC industry got from, say, the
advent of IBM into a small, niche market in 1981 to Microsoft's undeniable
deathgrip on a major industry in 1995. But I have found few facts
explaining about exactly what happened. I wish a forum like
alt.computer.folklore still existed in a viable fashion, where such
an issue might be hashed out in an informed manner.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205301118020.1408-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  The plot thickens, or is it sickens?

  Galen looked at a raw output file of an attempt last night and saw that
requests from here to open a data port were not returned. So, I telneted to
another host here and tried from there. It worked flawlessly!

  So, mystery lovers, the problem is not on the firewall (most likely), but
on this one host. Rebooting didn't clear the problem.

  The next step, I have been advised, is to set up a hub between my firewall
and the dsl router/modem then hook my notebook to that hub and watch packets
using ethereal. The analytical protocol is to use both ncftp and ftp from
both my non-ftp-functioning workstation and the ftp-functioning workstation.
That will provide a sample size of 4 to compare. This is all well and good,
but ... I'm far over my head on this.

  Is there someone who knows network analyses and packet sniffing tools who
would be willing to work with me Saturday on running these tests and
interpreting the results? I'll download a copy of ethereal and, in my
"copious free time" (he-he!) try to learn and understand it.

  This is certainly a non-trivial challange at this point. At least it is
for me. :-)

TIA,

Rich

In the past I have asked for some positive statement of what is
on-topic.  The answer I've received has more-or-less uniformily been
that on-topic is whatever people don't complain about.  I personally
don't find this satisfying.

I have suggested that we have a plug-technical list for strictly
technical discussion (which I think would do more to help separate out
the philosophy stuff than anything else), plug-anti-spam for
discussions of what to do about spam (which isn't really
Linux/Unix/GNU specific).  Maybe a plug-my-free-help-desk for the
folks with persistent problems.  The consensus response has seemed to
be "let's not go there", i.e., let's not get so rigid.

So they could subscribe to a list where it's more appropriate. Probably
they already do.

If it will help, I'll add my $.02. Take it somewhere else. I don't want
to have to start filtering PLUG mail through my spam filter just to
get back to a reasonable traffic level.

Although MacOS uses the FreeBSD userland it's still quite a different
beast under the hood than *BSD.  I haven't poked at it too much but I
don't think it uses anything like a simple /etc/passwd file for user
information.

Spamcop focuses on UCE (Unsolicited Commercial E-mail).  I don't know if they handle passing scam message info on to law enforcement.

The alternative is to continue to beat this dead horse about once every two 
months, with everyone eventually agreeing they we will police ourselves... 
again... That is, until some other thread gets going that continues ad 
nauseam. Then we repeat.

Suffice it to say the we are all individuals (thank goodness!) and what 
interests some will undoubtedly be off topic to others. I believe maybe a 
system where one person can suggest (move) to move the discussion to 
plug-talk, and another seconds it, it gets moved. If you want to continue 
the discussion, join plug-talk.

On the other hand, everyone needs to remember that we are all people here, 
and as such, we aren't perfect. We weren't designed that way, and we won't 
become that way due to ranting, raving, or foul language. Gentle reminders 
work far better (at least on me) than any of the former. In fact, I've been 
known to ignore rants, just due to the fact that they *ARE* rants.

We have one of the best LUG lists on the net. Let's figure out how to keep 
it that way.

I think the term "on-topic" is rather abused and perhaps not
what is literally meant by some.  There are plenty of on-topic
discussions that no one wants to see repeated ad nauseum: vi
vs emacs, Red Hat vs Debian, Perl vs Python, LISP vs the world,
on-topic vs off-topic, etc.  It isn't the actual content of these
arguments that makes them unacceptable; it's the fact that they all
eventually turn into a flame-fest.  And generally, it isn't until
it turns into a flame-fest that people start to complain.  That is
what has happened to the discussion that started this discussion,
and that's why it's end is being called for.

More like:

 > and that's why it's MOVE to PLUG-TALK is being called for.

The discussion isn't necessarily wrong/bad/offtopic, but perhaps not 
entirely ON-topic for most of the people on the list.  Regardless, 
that's what PLUG-TALK is for.  When you sense that a topic is getting 
out of the bounds of more or less on-topicness (is that a word?  ;) it's 
probably a good time to just cc: or move completely to PLUG-TALK.

When someone who isn't involved in the discussion requests it, that's 
the PERFECT time.

	The file exists, even root couldn't edit it though. All I can
think is that the system users are get there in a non-changeable file,
while all the actual users are kept in a seperate file/database. 
	From a user land stand point you have all the basic utils you
need, CD, MV, etc, etc. But the locate database wouldn't update for
me. I've also seen other's run Xfree instead of Aqua.
	What I'd really like to see is the port collection. I'd love to be
able to install those programs, in addition to the Mac software. On the
other hand, the iTools.com website has graphic front ends for a lot of
stuff you might need. BUT, corporate users are going to have to be
careful, some of those programs could be security risks, if the users
aren't locked down.

uh, that part is what will make it FAR slower than a simple stat()

a symlink path in shorter time than the kernel can do it in kernel space?

:-)

Remember, "ln -s /fred/barney/betty dino"
gives you /fred/barney/betty for readlink("dino"), but if /fred
itself is a symlink, you have to expand *that* as well.

My personal experience is that when lists are rigidly defined, that new
postings asking about the same old questions, are ignored. Newbie posters leave
the list because they don't get any value from the list. If the list members
that stay, post "off topic",  the old experts leave the list. The people that
stay always end up posting off topic because they are frustrated at being
ignored or told to RTFM. The practically is that the experts never pass on
their lower level experience to anyone and the list stagnates.

One of values Plug adds to the community, is that postings asking about the
same old questions, are answered by newly crowned experts. When those experts
grow tired of answering the old questions ,they become silent and the new
experts that they helped along, answer in their place.	This happens at all
levels of technical knowledge. 

It is often inspiring to see the depth of knowledge in this list, the
willingness to help, and the respect shown by the members to each other. 

Thank you

Not that I'm a list deity, but I do know that `mailman' can be configured to
allow only members to post -and- be set up to not require approval by the
list owner for new subscriptions...

subscribe_policy Option 
subscribe_policy (privacy): What steps are required for subscription?

confirm (*) - email confirmation required 
require approval - require list administrator approval for subscriptions 
confirm+approval - both confirm and approve

(*) when someone requests a subscription, mailman sends them a notice with a
unique subscription request number that they must reply to in order to
subscribe. This prevents mischievous (or malicious) people from creating
subscriptions for others without their consent.


I should think that would suffice to keep spambots at bay but allow friendly
aliens easy access.

I'm sorry for a lengthy post.
Just got this press release.
I'm very optimistic to say: 
United we stand against Micro$oft terrorism. Please read below. 

Caldera, Conectiva, SuSE, Turbolinux Partner To Create UnitedLinux,
And Produce A Uniform Version Of Linux For Business
	Majority of enterprise system and software vendors including AMD,
Borland 
Software Corporation, Computer Associates, Fujitsu Siemens, Fujitsu
Japan, 
Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, NEC, Progress Software, and SAP, support
effort 
to create standard Linux platform

LINDON, Utah, CURITIBA, Brazil, NUREMBERG, Germany, and BRISBANE,
Calif. -May 
30, 2002- Linux Industry leaders Caldera International, Inc. (Nasdaq:
CALD), 
Conectiva S.A., SuSE Linux AG, and Turbolinux, Inc., today announced
the 
organization of UnitedLinux, a new initiative that will streamline
Linux 
development and certification around a global, uniform distribution of
Linux 
designed for business.  UnitedLinux addresses enterprise customers'
need for 
a standard, business-focused Linux distribution that is certified to
work 
across hardware and software platforms, accelerating the adoption of
Linux in 
the enterprise. Under terms of the agreement, the four companies will 
collaborate on the development of one common core Linux operating 
environment, called UnitedLinux software.  The four partners will each
bundle 
value added products and services with the UnitedLinux operating
system and 
the resulting offering will be marketed and sold by each of the four
partners 
under their own brands. 
 Nearly every vendor supplying a piece of the technology
infrastructure used 
by businesses has expressed support for UnitedLinux, including systems
and 
software vendors AMD, Borland Software Corporation, Computer
Associates, 
Fujitsu Siemens, Fujitsu Japan, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, NEC,
Progress 
Software, and SAP.  Independent hardware and software vendors spend 
considerable effort certifying their products and services on
individual 
Linux distributions to ensure product compatibility for their
customers. 
UnitedLinux will significantly diminish the number of distributions
that 
vendors are asked to certify and will provide a true standards-based
Linux 
operating environment
..  

Customers Benefit Through Unity
According to research firm IDC, a 2001 survey of 800 North American
and 
Western European companies found that 40% of the respondents were
either 
using or testing Linux in their organizations.  UnitedLinux will help
further 
speed enterprise adoption of Linux by providing businesses with a
greater 
choice in the number of applications and hardware certified to work on
the 
uniform version of Linux. Customers will also benefit from the global
sales, 
localization, education, support and services that all four
UnitedLinux 
vendors will collectively provide.
The collaboration of the four leading Linux companies will result in
an 
enterprise Linux offering, which is truly global by virtue of the
companies' 
ability to provide local language support, training and professional 
services, in addition to the support of strategic partners.
UnitedLinux will 
provide one unified Linux code base for IBM's complete eServer product
line, 
AMD's current 32-bit and forthcoming 64-bit AMD Athlon and AMD Opteron

processor-based platforms, and Intel's x86 32-bit and Itanium
processor 
family platforms. UnitedLinux supports LSB, Li18nux, and GB18030
standards, 
as well as enabling installations in English, German, French, Italian,

Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Simplified Chinese and
Traditional 
Chinese languages.
In addition UnitedLinux unleashes a massive research and development 
organization for Linux in the enterprise. Effectively, the four
companies 
involved in this process will shift dollars and resources once
allocated to 
creating and maintaining custom Linux operating environments and
divert them 
to new R&D on Linux enterprise software.  UnitedLinux is dedicated to 
bolstering the enterprise readiness of the platform, but in the same 
collaborative spirit from which Linux was founded and continues to
flourish.

Participation and Availability
While today's announcement outlines the founding members of
UnitedLinux, the 
initiative is open for additional Linux companies to participate.  The
four 
partners currently plan to each offer their own server products based
on 
UnitedLinux by the end of 2002.  For additional information on
UnitedLinux, 
contact Caldera, Conectiva, SuSE or Turbolinux or go to
www.unitedlinux.com.

# # #

ADDENDUM

AMD
AMD looks forward to working with UnitedLinux. Innovating within open 
standards is a basic tenet at both AMD and UnitedLinux.  The
combination of 
an enterprise-ready standard Linux, and high-volume, industry standard
32-bit 
and 64-bit server platforms from AMD will provide shared customers
with a 
high-performance platform for enterprise computing.
-- Rich Heye, Vice President Platform and Infrastructure, AMD

Borland
As a leading provider of Linux development environments, Borland
supports the 
efforts around UnitedLinux. This organization should help in making it
easier 
for Borland to offer our technology running on Linux from more vendors
and 
help to open up new opportunities and channels for Borland.
-- Simon Thornhill, VP and General Manager of rapid application
solutions at 
Borland

Caldera
Caldera sees the formation of UnitedLinux as a tremendous benefit to
the 
industry, to our customers, to our 16,000-member reseller channel, and
to our 
IHV and ISV partners. Linux and Open Source have already changed the
way 
software is developed in the new online world. UnitedLinux now offers
a 
viable business model and creates a unified environment that will
attract 
many more global business solutions to Linux enabling far greater
adoption 
and use. Caldera plans to make Linux not just an alternative OS, but
the 
dominant choice for businesses worldwide who are wanting to take
advantage of 
the benefits of online services.
-- Ransom Love, Chairman and CEO, Caldera International

Computer Associates
As a company that has demonstrated unmatched commitment to Linux as an

enterprise- computing platform, CA is extremely supportive of the
UnitedLinux 
initiative. We believe that this broad-based cooperative effort will
further 
accelerate the embrace of Linux by customers across all market
segments and 
will enable them to realize the significant technical and business
benefits 
that Linux offers in their distributed and mainframe implementations.
-- John Pincomb, VP of Marketing at Computer Associates

Conectiva
UnitedLinux represents the addition of the best qualification of each
of these 
companies. As they are in different places, they can add
qualifications that 
each one has developed in order to answer to the challenges of the
local 
markets, creating a product that increases the number of answers to
the 
technical demand. It would be very difficult an individual company to
get 
such a wide coverage in so many aspects.  In addition, the
organization model 
we are adopting, an alliance with cooperation and contribution of best

practices, is in accordance with the cooperative spirit Linux has
wrought. 
-- Jaques Rosenzvaig, CEO of Conectiva

Free Standards Group
UnitedLinux?s commitment to LSB certification is a natural. I look
forward to 
the further growth of the Linux market acceptance of open source 
methodologies and wider certification of Linux products.
  -- Scott McNeil, Executive Director of the Free Standards Group

Fujitsu
Linux is one of the most important strategic platforms for Fujitsu,
and we 
have been actively developing hardware and software products, services
and 
solutions based on Linux. We welcome UnitedLinux and commend its
efforts to 
create a common and stable Linux distribution environment for system
vendors 
like Fujitsu and business customers as well. Fujitsu is pleased to
lend its 
fullest support to UnitedLinux's activities.
-- Masaharu Kitaoka, General Manager of Linux Division, Fujitsu
Limited.

Fujitsu Siemens Computers
UnitedLinux transforms Linux into a business operating system par
excellence. 
The level of performance, scalability and availability will be
extraordinary. 
Combined with our PRIMERGY servers, UnitedLinux will provide a
platform for 
business-critical computing solutions.
-- Dr. Joseph Reger, Chief Technology Officer Fujitsu Siemens
Computers

HP
As the #1 vendor of Linux solutions and the leading proponent of 
standards-based computing, HP believes UnitedLinux represents an
important 
milestone that will accelerate the use of Linux by enterprises around
the 
world.  Businesses of all sizes that are deploying Linux now have the 
additional benefit of this unified platform.
-- Martin Fink, general manager, HP Linux Systems Division

IBM
The formation of UnitedLinux offers multiple benefits to the industry,
proving 
yet again that cooperation on standards simplifies application
development 
and deployment for vendors thereby providing our mutual customers with
new 
applications more quickly. Ultimately, UnitedLinux will accelerate
Linux 
adoption in the industry.
-- Steve Solazzo, General Manager, Linux, IBM.

Linux International
Open Source licensing leads to each vendor having the same
functionality in 
the base system over time.   This effort shows forethought in making
that 
effort a planned, cooperative event.  Rather than spend their money 
re-engineering the basic underlying functionalities of reliability, 
scalability and availability, these vendors will be able to build a
common 
platform with which to innovate new features that their customers
desire.  I 
wish the old Unix vendors had learned that lesson.   

"For many years the analysts have been saying that the marketplace can
not 
support so many distributions of Linux, hinting that only one or two
might 
survive.  Once again the Linux community has come back with a unique
answer 
which may prove the analysts both right and wrong.   This bold step
should 
give
a strong base distribution that will satisfy the needs of the software
vendor 
for consistency and the hardware vendor for support, yet allow 
differentiation at the upper levels to meet the needs of diverse
customers." 
Jon "maddog" Hall, Executive Director of Linux International.







Open Forum Europe
OpenForum Europe was formed to accelerate and broaden the use of Linux
and 
Open Source Software in business, breaking down the perceived business

blockers that our research has shown may slow down its adoption by
business. 
The announcement of United Linux is very welcome, tackling potential 
duplication of effort and via the partner collaboration will boost
confidence 
of CIOs in selecting Linux. UnitedLinux is a future-oriented step that
has 
the full support of OpenForum Europe.
-- Graham Taylor, Programme Director, OpenForum Europe

NEC
NEC believes that any activities of the UnitedLinux will be useful for
all of 
us -- Linux users, developers and system integrators -- related to the

enterprise systems. NEC welcomes such activities and will contribute 
development of future Linux market for enterprise.
-- Chieko Takahashi, Senior Manager of Open Source Software Solution
Center, 
NEC Solutions, NEC

Progress Software
We are encouraged by the announcement of a UnitedLinux Operating
System and 
look forward to its first release. We see the collaboration between
Caldera, 
SuSE, Turbolinux and Conectiva as being a most effective way of
integrating 
several Linux distributions into one standard based Linux Operating
System 
that is specifically targeted for business implementations.  This is
an 
essential step in the evolution of the Linux OS, which will provide
notable 
economical and technological benefits to business customers
and software companies like Progress.
-- Maggie Alexander, Vice President of Product Planning at Progress
Software
SAP
UnitedLinux will assist SAP in extending our Linux reach while
maintaining the 
clear and simple structure of the distributions and databases
supported by 
SAP solutions.  Throughout the world, UnitedLinux will help to make
SAP 
solutions on Linux an even more compelling offering with respect to
service, 
support, reliability and performance to price ratio.
-- SAP AG, Karl-Heinz Hess, Member of the Extended Executive Board

SuSE Linux AG
UnitedLinux provides our customers a business Linux that can truly be
called 
the 'best of the best'. Global accounts will especially welcome the
worldwide 
availability of one unified product combined with a set of services
delivered 
either by a local Linux player or an international acting partner like
IBM 
Global Services.
-- Gerhard Burtscher, CEO SuSE Linux AG

Turbolinux
Asia Pacific is one of the fastest growing markets for Linux and
UnitedLinux 
will only accelerate that rapid growth.  Turbolinux has market
leadership in 
Asia Pacific with major enterprise customers, hardware and software
partners 
throughout the region, as well as aiding in China's massive
undertaking to 
select a technology infrastructure for the entire country. 
UnitedLinux will 
benefit these customers, especially those in the largest enterprises
that use 
Linux across their global infrastructures. With today's announcement,
there 
are no credible arguments left against Linux in the enterprise. Linux
will 
take its deserved place alongside every other enterprise operating 
environment. 
-- Ly-Huong Pham, CEO of Turbolinux

Right.  But you still avoid doing the final inode fetch that
a stat would require.

Consider, you want to find all symlinks that point to /a,
and there are ten million symlinks in /tmp that point at
/b/something, where /b happens to be on a server on mars.

The stat solution will be much, much slower than doing the
symlink expand and strcmp.

Just to clarify: when I say I don't find it satisfying, I mean to say
that if "on-topic" means the list is principally for technical
questions and discussion, then we ought to say that.  Some people seem
to assume that, but others think there is a much broader definition of
on-topic.  People refer to the need for list participants to be
"reasonable" and get annoyed when participants, in their estimation,
are not.  To hold someone to a "reasonable" standard, to be fair, you
need to provide something on which to base the "reason".

I am not _for_ rigidity.  I am for giving people a basis for acting
reasonably, as a way of minimizing wasteful friction.  That's all.

Please elucidate this subject.  Why did they choose a segmented memory

	/etc/passwd does exist and (like any other file) can be modified
by root (or at least, it should be possible - unless something is wrong
with the setup/install...).  The catch is that root is not enabled by
default and cannot log in at all (this can be changed).  However, the file
is not consulted unless the machine is booted into single user mode.  For
most things, the netinfo database is used.  There are a lot of command
line things you can do with netinfo, and a graphical editor for it - but
its a huge database of configuration (users, groups, hosts, mount points,
services, etc.) that is not well documented just yet.

	Hm... don't know about the locate database.  Works for me, but at
this point, I can't remember if I had any trouble with it at first.  As
for Xfree, I have it running sometimes along Aqua - kind of nice that way.
There are some good utilities (ie: ethereal) that will only run that way
right now.

	This whole thing may be a little off topic, but I wanted to post
to it, since I started out a Mac user and started moving to linux since it
seemed more powerfull/customizable and easier to work with to learn some
programming.  Now, my Mac has the best of both worlds, I think.  I have
perl, PHP, apache and a GUI that I like more than KDE or Gnome (each to
his own, right?).
	Of course, I still have a linux box sitting in the corner that
does a fair amount of work as well.  :)

Does it mean "very"?  "really"?  "extremely"?  Or some other meaning

How about moving both over to Talk?

I agree totally that it was interesting and timely.  But if it didn't fall
under the umbrella of the Talk list, I don't know what does.

True, but if others start requesting it to be moved, why not?  It can't be
that hard.  (I'll raise my hand as a contributor to that one, but can make a
mental note to look for stuff appearing in Talk if people ask for it to be
moved.)

I reccomend subscribing to Talk, which is where everyone is suggesting this

Again, including THIS thread.

(What is the use of me subscribing to Talk, if this stuff ISN'T in there.
Maybe I WANT to see this kind of stuff sometimes, without wading through the

The difficulty is introduced by rsync's notion of server-side 
"modules," which provide an arbitrary mapping from a string (the 
module name) to the filesystem.

IOW, it's impossible to predict how/if an rsync module name will 
relate to the ftp filespace.

The early architectures were 8/12/16 bit. A 16-bit address space only
gets you 64K of addressable memory. To address a larger space some 
manufacturers used a segmented architecture, where a segment register
would indicate the base of addressable memory, and other references
would index 8/12/16 bits off that based on some arithmetic. 

The method could give you some interesting ways to handle context
switching and other issues, but with the Wintel platform there evolved
two programming "models" - small/large. Small memory models were
for programs that could exist in 64KB, and pointers consisted of the
offset register. Large models addressed all of memory, and pointers
consisted of the segment/offset pair. Pointer arithmetic became
really interesting, especially since there was a shift involved
(if I recall, 16+16=24 bits).

Motorola used a flat address space and 32-bit registers.

I'm surprised you don't know what this refurs to.  Maybe it's because the
32-bit operating systems have pretty much solved the problem.  Back in the
DOS days, if you wrote assembly language programs, you cursed this daily.
Memory locations were made of 2 16-bit numbers, the segment and the offset.
This meant that there were were 6 "memory models" for a program.  In C, you
just had to tell your compiler which to use, but it was a big hassle if you
wanted to link in assembly modules to your C code.  You had the tiny memory
model, which used 1 16-bit addess for all code and all data, for example.
This means your entire program had to fit into 1 64K segment as well as your
variables.  Executable files the have the extension .com are this way.  Then
you had Small, one segment for code and another for data.  You can
extrapolate the rest from here.  To make things even worse, there eas the
640K barrier.  All the memory locations above this point were resurved by
the operating system.  So that's all the memory you get for your
applications programs.  Deal with it.  Then along came extended and expanded
RAM.  Two different ways to do the same thing, have access to more memory.
The only problem was that it was a major hassle to work with.  It is amazing
that PC's became so huge when they were designed so poorly.  Fortunate, only
programmers had to deal with this and Joe user had no idea.

Actually, there are a lot of things solved by doing them the *nix way.
That's the nice thing about 90% of the OS, you can CLI if you want to, or
you can GUI if you want to. It's fantastic in that way.

I don't know why Intel chose the architecture. Maybe because they
didn't yet know how to design processors that could address a large
memory space. Or perhaps, each successive processor design was evolving
from the early 4004/8008 design.

Elucidate? OK, but I'm hardly the expert on this. I was an assembly
language programmer at the time. Any program could directly address
a memory space of 64 KB. If you needed more than that for program,
data, or stack space, you had to point to another 64 KB region of
memory by setting a "segment register". Then you had to keep track
of what region of memory you were pointing to. This is similar to
the bank switching memory technique used by EMS in the 80s.

Compilers made it easier by relieving the programmer of the burden of
segment register management, but you still had to be aware of it if,
for no other reason, to decide whether you wanted a tiny, small,
large, huge, etc. memory model. Eventually, Intel's processors could
directly address all of physical memory but that was years later.

Programmers of course had to do the most work, but there were extensive
support needs generated by Joe User who didn't understand why his (then
high end) 32mb system didn't have enough [conventional] memory to run an
old DOS app that installed from a single floppy disk.

I'm glad I didn't deal with segment:offset any more than was recently
necessary for the x86 Assembly Language Course at OIT.

I assume the "given meaning of the word as you know it" would be related
to coitus ["My boyfriend and I were so embarrassed when my dad caught us
fucking."], the physical act of love, motions evocative of said act ["That
Volkswagen is fucking my bumper."], or symbolic and figurative actions
representing brutal acts of rape or "rough sex" ["You should read my
contract.  They're totally fucking me."].  Would that be correct?

That is usually (and I can't think of an exception at the moment) correct
when "fucking" is used a gerund or present participle.  The same meanings
can be used with other forms of the root as well.

> Does it mean "very"?  "really"?  "extremely"?  Or some other meaning
> that escapes me entirely?

No, that's quite good work, Karl.  You'll make a fine linguistic
detective.

When "fucking" is used as an adverb, it is an intensifier such as "very",
"really", or "extremely".  Unlike those other words, however, it carries a
subjective feeling of distaste or exasperation that a simple intensifier
does not provide.  Because of this added nuance, "fucking" isn't the same
kind of "unnecessary word" in the Strunk & White sense.  Of course,
overuse of any modifier is poor writing.

I leave as homework the task of identifying and defining usage of the
following forms of the word "fuck" in non-sexual context:
Fuck!
fucked or fucked-up
fucking off/around
as fuck
fucking with

I'm sure if you look and listen carefully, you'll find many other uses for
this versatile word.

Enjoy.
Jeme.

And the squeeze on conventional memory was often exacerbated by
loading networking drivers, like TCP/IP and LANMAN or PC/NFS.  I used
to have different boot options set up so that the user could decide to
run application X _or_ have access to the network shares, but not both.

Hello,
If you're willing to participate in unemployed PLUGers resume DB
project please give me a call 503-547-2204 during normal business
hours. 

There is another PLUG member Dave with whom we're going to meet in my
house this Saturday to discuss this task and set up priorities in this
project development.
We'll plug you in.  

Regards.

Well, that's the sexual (however symbolic or figurative) use of the word
mentioned earlier.  In this instance, it is a verb.

I'm sure if you look and listen carefully, you'll find it is a left jab.

Either I've just missed your humorous intent, or you misunderstood what
I meant. If you are unemployed, you are, by default, already a member of
the unemployed SIG. It is simply a way of conveying your current
employment status to the others on the list.

So, you're already a member of the unemployed SIG. However, if you are
referring to Alex's resume DB project, that's different -- related, but
different.

Hi,

Sorry about a relatively on-topic post...

In konqueror (web browser), the font in the "Location" window
is so small that it is almost unreadable (for my eyes).

I've tried changing this in Settings/Configure Konqueror to no
avail.  I've tried changing it (KDE 2.2.1) Configure Desktop/Appearance,
to no avail.

Where can I change it?

Thanks,

Another book that covers the origins of several aspects of today's
computing is _Dealers of Lightning, Xerox PARC and the Dawn of the
Computer Age_ by Michael Hiltzik. In addition to documenting the
beginnings of the mouse, overlapping windows, and laptop computers, Mr.
Hiltzik tracks the career paths of several individuals who ended up at
Apple and Microsoft. The projects they worked on at PARC laid the
foundations for MS Word, and MS Windows, and a good part of the Mac user
interface.

"Special Interest Group" Groups that are more organized than we
have them for special topics; we only joke about having them.
(I'm a member of the "beer SIG.")  The Portland PC Users Group has
a Linux SIG, I believe.

Things were much simpler back in my days of coding 8080 and Z80 assembly 
language under CP/M. With 16 bit addressing and no segments things were 
really straight forward. Later on when I got into doing some X86 work I 
never really felt comfortable with the concept of Intel's 
segment:offset crap. 

I also managed to avoid much x86 work in college as about the only class 
that used any sort of microprocessor assembly language was an operating 
system pragmatics class I took as a senior. I was relieved to find that 
our target platform for the class was a Motorola 68010 based system 
with an MMU. We did have to take an assembly language class as well but 
at the time it was IBM 360/370 assembly. It was an amazing thing to see 
IBM's assembler and our assembled programs run on our school's CDC 
Cyber mainframe which had a 360/370 emulator that was written in 
Minnesota Pascal on it.

In the spirit of the grand and hallowed "me too" post, I would just like
to say that, of all the laughter this list has caused me today, this one
was the hardest and best.

Subject: [PLUG] directory... file path question for postgresql
Message-ID: <IJEOKPPKNHMOOPGFFHHBKEFCCEAA.mboynay@silverliningdev.com>

Hello All,

I have a general question about differences in creating directories for
postgresql.  I found a helpful how-to from yolinux.com that takes you
through setting up postgresql on a linux box.

In the set up it talks about the user "postgres" having a home directory of
/var/lib/pgsql.
I just got a copy of the wrox beginning databases with postgresql and it
talks setting up and initializing the database using /usr/local/pgsql/data.

I am in the learning process so bare with me if this is a simple question.
What is the difference between the two directory scheme's?  Will any user's
that I add have the same path as the "postgres"?

The reason why I am wanting to find out is because I have a couple of
domains that I am going to host and will use a db backend for dynamic
content and I am just trying to learn as I go.

thanks in advance,

Mike

I invited my administrator to learn more about Linux and the Open Source
environment by reading the posts to this list.  While I knew that much of
what would be read would be beyond her knowledge, I wanted her to
recognize the level of support/expertise that is available and would
hopefully encourage our agency to take a serious look at an alternative
system.

Unfortunately, today was the first day that she really paid attention to
the posts.  You can perhaps imagine my embarrassment when she presented me
with printer copies of this thread!

While I am sold on Linux, I may never get my management to look at an
alternative operating system seriously.  One may reason that they should
not be so shallow and judge everyone in open source/Linux by the
actions/words of a few....but, now I have a much larger mountain to climb.


Perhaps this is reason enough to move topics that lurk on the
fringes of appropriateness to another list.

Brian,

How are you?

Unfortunately, today's postings were enough to put them off a bit.  As you
know, we have two linux servers.  I have been attempting to introduce them
to using linux on the desktop.  They are not aware of the fact that I only
use linux/even for my desktop.

The messages that were printed were those that included the use 'f...' and
the definitions, explanations, etc.  You know how conservative we
are...so, this was just horrible timing.

Perhaps it was a mistake to share the posts...I really thought that it
would be helpful.

	I am certain that it was the seeming lack of professionalism, the
language and the discussion back and forth about whether the post was OT
or not, what constitutes OT...
	It is sometimes difficult to explain how helpful and supportive
the list has been.  Our agency is relatively conservative and not one to
take plunges that contradict business norms.  So far, MS products have
been proven stable etc., etc., etc.
	I have been planting seeds here and there for about two years and
have been getting a bit closer.  Again, perhaps I made in error with the
invitation in the first place...?

	Yes, she read other threads.  I certainly pointed them out as well
as presenting copies of information that I have kept in the past.
However, she just was not prepared to read the back and forth/seemingly
going no where discussion.  It was as much about the time spent tossing
the 'insults' back and forth as it was the use of the language.
	I think it was a shock to her.  Certainly most of us have heard
and perhaps used language worse than that used in this thread.  Our
culture in this agency is not very internet focused.  i.e., chat rooms,
bulletin boards, etc. are viewed as activities that should not take place
in the work.  My presentation of the list was that of a very technically
oriented support resource.
	My initial post was just after having left her office, so I was
still feeling her disdain and apprehension.

I am certain that over time, this will not matter.  The timing was just
unfortunate.

I can only say that there are a couple names on the list that she may want
to ignore if she is understandably upset by profanity.  (Mine would not be
one of them.)  I have received excellent help on several occations from this
list.  I have also had the experiance of contacting "help desks" for
software companies that are paid for as part of a license agreement.  I can
only say that this list has been much more helpful to me.

Hmmm, so how'd you manage it? <grin>

BTW, I manually tried (with FTP) other mirror sites (e.g.
limestone.uoregon.edu).  They all look nearly a week out

Is RedHat trying to promote RHN and software subsriptions

This makes my point from a few months back regarding professionalism and 
how the "linux" crowd is perceived. At the time I was publicly pummeled by 
several on this list for "stepping on their free speech". Maybe so, but 
folks won't hire you if you insist on spouting vulgarities at every turn.

On top of that, this list is archived in public. What or how you say things 
today may come back to haunt you tomorrow.

Agreed.  With the many school districts and businesses beginning to
experiment with Linux, it would be a good idea if we all upped our
professionalism on this list.  Many new people are listening to see what
Linux is all about and how they might apply it to their needs, so we
really should strive to give them the best possible impression.  Plug-talk
or IRC are more appropriate venues for any "informal" discussions.
Whether we want it to or not, what we write on this list reflects on
"Linux" and people's perceptions of it.

Well, my post was an attempt to point out that the word was NOT used in a
vulgar manner.

I can certainly understand a person getting upset at the use of that term
to describe their sacred act of coupling, mating, making love, or whatever
it is to them.

It's VULGAR because it's profaning the sacred.  But I was using the word
in a sense that has nothing to do with that act and, hence, it wasn't
vulgar.

Anyway, that was the whole point.

As for "how the linux crowd is perceived", I think it's absurd to cater to
those who choose to stereotype and fail to judge individuals without
lumping them into castes and disparaging by association.

> On top of that, this list is archived in public. What or how you say

Well, hopefully the hypocrisy of our modern age will be lifted in the near
future and we will be able to publicly recognize our private actions.

Because you know what?  We pretty much all masturbate, swear, think nasty
thoughts, and even lie a fair amount.  To claim anything else is not only
hypocrisy, but self-denial and self-hatred.

I've recently started using rsync with distro.ibiblio.org, which
is usually pretty up-to-date.  Try 'rsync ::distro.ibiblio.org'
and you'll get a listing of modules.

This may be the best argument yet for setting up a separate "Linux help"

How about filtering main list mail, then sending the non-professional mail that 
contains a published list of words to the plug-NC17 list?

That way, if you want to be assulted when things get out of hand, you can 
subscribe to the special NC-17 version.

After looking the word up in Merriam-Webster, it appears that ANY use of 
that word is obscene and/or vulgar. In fact, they specifically call out 
your use of the word, say that it's obscene, and also say in the same 
definition that it refers to coitus.

For my examples, obscene == vulgar == profane == unprofessional.

I personally do not believe that it's possible to use that word in a 
non-vulgar manner. There are hundreds of words that a less vulgar, that 
imply the same meaning.

IMNSHO, the word was used to express the feelings of the author, and was 
used for shock value. Nothing more, nothing less.

This is my opinion, YMMV.

Where it is installed should be irrelevant to the users, since they will
be accessing the database via a socket connection to a server process, and
should not have any knowledge of or ability to directly access any of the
data files.  As far as where it is best to install it, if you are using a
package that comes with your Linux distribution it should default to a
reasonable location, if not, the binary files in the distribution should
be placed somewhere under the "/usr/local" directory tree, and the data
files for the database should be placed somewhere under "/var/local" the
reason for this is that if you install a package which is not part of your
Linux distribution elsewhere under "/usr" or "/var" there is a potential
for collision with other packages using the same name, where the
"/usr/local" and "/var/local" directory trees are for local
customizations.  The reason for splitting it and putting the data in one
place and the executable files in another, is that by convention the
"/var" heirarchy is for data which changes regularly, and the "/usr"
heirarchy is generally for files which are constant, only changing during
upgrades.  Their are several advantages to this separation, including
allowing quick backups of only parts of the file system which are getting
modified constantly, protecting your executable files from hackers by
putting them on read-only file systems and/or media, or making it
easier to configure a system to run from a CD.

Censorship = Not Good
Filtering Messages = Censorship

Is that something everyone wants to teach in school, that you can't
speak freely?  Seems that is the ideas that are pushed in school
already...  we ought to just push right along and teach the same thing!

Sarcasm = off

Just my 2 cents.

It's not a question of what's clean and what's not.

Would you tell your boss ANYTHING with the word f*** in it? Would you speak 
to customers that way?

Those are rhetorical questions. If you say you would, I don't believe you. 
At least, not while trying to keep your job. :)

All I am suggesting is that we assume that we're all professionals here, 
and act accordingly. The list is a great resource, with or without the 
cussing. It's a better customer resource without.

I'm always amazed at the number of times I'll be looking something up on 
the net, and the plug list archives are at the top of the list. What we say 
here is seen by *LOTS* of people.

We all talk about promoting linux in schools, in the workplace, at home, 
everywhere. If Joe CEO gets to looking around, and everywhere he looks he's 
assaulted by words that many consider offensive, he's not going to consider 
linux as a serious alternative. Mostly because what he sees looks like a 
bunch of middle school kids trying to sound older than they are.

It most definitely does *NOT* look like professionals trying to promote a 
better computing system.

Again, this is my opinion, ymmv.

  Earlier today, I managed to download a copy of an ethereal source package:

 4938174 Apr 16 21:19 ethereal-0.9.3-3.src.rpm

But, when I tried (as root) to install it I saw this:

error: ethereal-0.9.3-3.src.rpm cannot be installed

  Turns out that not all of it came down the pipe. The file size reported on
rpmfind.net is 5130292. Sigh.

  This is rather a conundrum. My ftp capability has broken and I cannot get
a tool needed to watch the packets and try to figure out what's going on.

  If anyone has a copy of the source rpm of ethereal, or a rpm that will
install and run on a RH 6.2 system, please mail it directly to me.

TIA,

Rich

I think there's quite a difference between gratuitous offensive language intended 
to insult and offend and a ?clean? list.

I certainly did not intend to offend _you_.

I?m asking for responsible use of language that helps us meet our stated goal.

I?m not intending to dictate the language of people actually providing help on

This isn't much more than legend, but the way I heard it was that the
only software engineer on the 8086 development team came from DEC and
its PDP-11 segmented architecture (16-bit registers, 18-bit addresses).
Apparently the project leader later regretted the decision, but they
were stuck with it.

  Because the link for the Red Hat packages takes one directly to
rpmfind.net (as noted in the table on their site). And, rpmfind uses ftp to

So the wife mentions to me that she's going to take 5 July off work.
``Hmm," I think, ``that must mean that 4 July falls on a Thursday."
And indeed it does: the first Thursday of July. Which my Palm Pilot
tells me is also the date for the July PLUG meeting.

So does that mean I have to forgo the July meeting in order to
watch fireworks (as will a number of folks), or is the meeting
going to be pushed back to the following Thursday -- 11 July?

  Update.

  I decided to grabe the source tarball and build it here. Just for giggles
I went to the RPMS directory, and there is a .src.rpm for 0.9.4! I was able
to download it via http.

  Yipee!

Do they claim that EVERY use of a word using that root is a reference to
coitus?  That's demonstrably false.

Also, you should check their definition of "obscene" and see if they do
not acknowledge that it's application is always subjective.  To use such a
subjective term in a supposedly objective reference work is totally
irresponsible.

...unless you'd like to go ahead and let some publishing company be the

Well, for someone that thinks "obscene", "vulgar", "profane", and
"unprofessional" all mean the same thing, that might be true.  But for
those of us that appreciate the differences between the meanings of words,
it doesn't fly.

Can you name an adverb that is an intensifier that expresses distaste?

All slang exists to make up for a lack in the academic language.

Well, YNSHO is wrong.  As the author, I can say that shock value was not a
consideration.  It WAS used to express the feelings of the author (which I
stated very clearly in my first response), but I hope you realize that
EVERY word written on this list is an expression of the feelings or
beliefs of the author.

Would your boss ever tell you ANYTHING with the word FUCK in it?  Mine
have done it in every so-called "professional" position I've ever held.

In fact, nobody has used that word more frequently in a single sitting
than the CEO of my former employer... and that includes the Swearing
Sailor, my nickname for an Alaskan fisherman with whom I shared a
Greyhound aisle from Sacramento to Yreka, California.

But your boss can use it to you because he has power and you don't.  So
it's language that is reserved for those with power.  Fuck that.

I think Wil nailed this one right on the head.  I'm a professional on this
list as soon as you pay me to be on this list and the same is true for
each and every one of you.

Then he's an idiot.  Do you think that's the act of a rational person?

"I'm offended by the language of soem people who use this software.  
Clearly the software cannot meet my needs."

I mean, I know we just had a little thread about how stupid management can
be, but this is the greatest insult I've heard yet.

Really?  That's what I think when I hear folks promoting censorship as a

problem.

Nope, we're not professionals trying to promote a better computing system.

Exactly right. Notice how the loudest cries for "free speech" come from the 
obnoxious ones. Never about using that freedom to behave in a civil manner. 

Your point about what you say may come back to haunt you is 100% right on. 
When I refer out, I don't refer my good customers to cranky rude people. 

As you said, it's a mistake to think of this as a private clubhouse. There's

With my customers, I maintain a protocol, whereby I don't curse
until they do, which usually doesn't take long.  And most of my
bosses have cursed more than I or Jeme do.  In fact, as far as I
can remember, everyone I've known who works with computers curses
like this.  It comes with the job and the usual level of frustration.

But it's not a "customer resource".  It's a mailing list, an
informal, social organization.  It's not anyone's unpaid tech
support helpdesk.  IBM or Linuxcare or Caldera will gladly provide
you one for $125-$250/hr.  If you want a "professional" helpdesk,
then hire one.  Don't ask people to share knowledge for free
(as in beer) and be an ass about how they do it.  I get irritated
with people who can't remember the difference between "their" and
"they're", but I don't bitch about it.

Welcome to the Internet.  If they're going to get scared off by
reading one or two uses of "fuck" a week, they'll run screaming
if they ever read even only a few messages posted by Linus or look
for firewalling help from Rusty Russell.

Like Linus said, when it stops being fun, I'll stop doing it.

You haven't been around Linux long enough, apparantly, if you think this
is a good idea in the first place. Any process that is democratic and
open is bound to have warts and outbursts like this. It shouldn't color
the good or take away from the overall outcome and what benefits it
offers. If it does, then maybe you just chose the wrong way to present
the Linux community.

Damned right.   So-called "free speech" is just an excuse used by the
obnoxious to make trouble for decent people.

You know, I read that as "When I reefer out" the first time through.  Now
I've never heard that expression, but I still thought it was kind of
funny.

Did someone imply that it WAS a private clubhouse?  I've read lots of
messages asserting that it ISN'T, but I don't think anyone claimed it was.

I think you people that made such comments should stop and think about why
you feel you have to act differently when others are watching.

No, it's always the people with sticks up their asses who bitch
about it that draw attention to it in the first place.

No one bothered to bitch at Felix Lee on "Mon, 20 May 2002 00:19:54

strangeness" when he said "Generally, on a multi-user system you
don't want everybody to have access to /dev/audio or whatever,
cuz then a remote user can fuck things up for the person sitting

when he said "Learn to fucking edit!"  (rlangis complained about

That's pretty much a tautology.  You don't _need_ "freedom" to say the
socially conforming thing.  You only need it when you want to violate
conformity.  If you aren't free to be non-conforming, then you aren't
free.

For myself, I want people to be free, and I find that I can live with
a little "color" in the language people use.

Well, my better half gets on me for use of "colorful metaphors" from

would hardly use that kind of language in shcools, even though many kids

If you don't have a disconnect between your public and private personae,
then why do you bother to point out that this isn't a private
forum?  Should we behave differently if it were?

The only possible reason I could attribute was that you might think that
some words are reserved for the "private clubhouse".

Actually I would argue that there are times when you *should* use that
sort of language in schools.

Like instructing them on how they should treat others.  "Don't be an
asshole!" is advice more of these little brats need to hear.

The language is not offensive to the kids, in most cases, it is
offensive to overprotective parents.

There are far too many parents that want to keep their little sprogs in
a protective cocoon until they leave home.  (And then wonder why they
crash and burn when they get away from Mommy and Daddy.)  Parents are
supposed to be preparing them for the real world, not extending playtime
indefinitely.

Sorry for the rant, but I get sick of people trying to "protect" kids
just because *they* find it offensive.

Not to comment on the same subject...

But I hope none of you ever truly think that the public education can
provide a "real" education for the masses.  A private institution such
as those that exist are the only things that will ever provide real
education.  The only way anyone in this country ends up with an
education is through self determination, and public school is more of a
desecration of individualism and self determination than anything...  on
top of that schools DO NOT set industry standards and DO NOT provide the
economy of the United States a real workforce of truly educated
individuals, it generally creates lemmings.

If the Linux community really wants to make an impact forget the
schools, push toward true capitalistic business, without a business
model Linux will not break any standard at present.  IBM can possibly
break the mold, maybe another big company.  But the open source
community and schools will not do much to break it.  Hell, Mac's owned
the school system for years, UNIX owned the internet for years, but look
at where we are at now.  The capitalistic entity of Microsoft rules the
roost, quality, maybe not, but it obviously provided more value to those
that went with it.  It's made millions and lives for more than Linux or
UNIX ever has.

Excuse me for the rant, but I get sick and tired of people putting so
much weight in the crappy school system that never will be worth the
money that is spent on it.  This country wasn't founded on "public"
schools and "public" functionality and "public" government.  It was
built on little government, complete freedom, and total individualism.
It's not what we seem to be heading toward, and it would be the
annihilation of the country along with anything such as Linux,
Microsoft, and the rest of America's software industry.  The idea that
any support (using Linux or Microsoft) of the public schools, the public
transit (which was cheaper, more efficient, and better serving when it
was privately created), or any type of welfare system is beneficial to
the American society is folly.  Capitalism has proved itself, but rarely
gets it's due for giving the developed world what it has.

Rant off.

I do support Linux as a technology, I don't mind it being free, but I
totally support Capitalistic entities making money off of software.
Public Schools are just not the place to teach this.  They provide
nothing but mediocrity.

You haven't been around Linux long enough, apparantly, if you think this
is a good idea in the first place. Any process that is democratic and
open is bound to have warts and outbursts like this. It shouldn't color
the good or take away from the overall outcome and what benefits it
offers. If it does, then maybe you just chose the wrong way to present
the Linux community.

- Must comment.

I communicate with my boss regularly with vulgarities.
No I do not communicate with customers with vulgarities unless they are
so free and open with me also.  I conduct business with friends, some of
who aren't all anal about vulgarities.  As you notice though I rarely
post or converse with vulgarities unless the crowd is comfortable with
such trivial adjectives and the like.

Just to note.  Linux is used in the workplace I am in.  We have 2
Penguin Systems running web sites.  We have a Debian box (on some
Gateway junk system) running a mail server because the dual processor P3
w/ 1.5GB RAM that has Exchange on it can't seem to run correctly or work
right.

Then of course we have an internal Database (SQL Server 2000) w/ a front
end developed with Office Visual Basic for Applications, and now moving
to VB.NET and ASP.NET... the reason being that it takes too long and
gets more complicated for all involved to develop and maintain the same
thing for a user base.  Not to mention that it is far to complicated to
manage desktop system with Linux on them vs. Windows 2K Pro boxes.  5
minutes for a Win2K box, about the same for a Linux box, everyone can
use Win2K, no one can use Linux.

The summary of my two little real life examples is this.  Real bosses
make smart moves and use what WORKS and can make money.  In most
situations Windows will make someone more money.  Even with the crashes
because of it's controlled development, lifecycle, blagh blagh blagh.
In many situations Linux can make one money and save a lot of money.  It
just happens that Windows can do this more readily, and is designed and
implemented as such.  Linux revolves around geeks like myself getting
off on cool technological tools, and creating things themselves.  It's
all good but to fight MS & Windows one has to create something with
Linux that the Linux community doesn't particularly want.  Someone that
is accountable to blame, a single source of contact, too many choices is
bad, a central binding development platform that is available in various
but extremely simple IDEs.  The list goes on.

----

Again, please excuse my rant, most of the time I'll just ask or give
technical knowledge.  It just seems there are a lot of good arguments
going on right now in the list and I can't seem to help myself.  :)

It's not a question of what's clean and what's not.

Would you tell your boss ANYTHING with the word f*** in it? Would you
speak 
to customers that way?

Those are rhetorical questions. If you say you would, I don't believe
you. 
At least, not while trying to keep your job. :)

All I am suggesting is that we assume that we're all professionals here,

and act accordingly. The list is a great resource, with or without the 
cussing. It's a better customer resource without.

I'm always amazed at the number of times I'll be looking something up on

the net, and the plug list archives are at the top of the list. What we
say 
here is seen by *LOTS* of people.

We all talk about promoting linux in schools, in the workplace, at home,

everywhere. If Joe CEO gets to looking around, and everywhere he looks
he's 
assaulted by words that many consider offensive, he's not going to
consider 
linux as a serious alternative. Mostly because what he sees looks like a

bunch of middle school kids trying to sound older than they are.

It most definitely does *NOT* look like professionals trying to promote
a 
better computing system.

Again, this is my opinion, ymmv.

Color me a sucker, I guess, because I think it could if parents took the
time to truly be involved in their schools and demand that schools
functioned more efficiently, spent money on teachers and books and not
$500,000 superintedents and principals, that public schools could provide

Do most companies want a "real" workforce? They're paying barely livable
wages in most cases, with little to no job security and trying to move
jobs overseas as quickly as possible. Something tells me most companies
prefer their workers to be more lemming-like.

It wasn't founded on it, but public schools certainly have their place in
the developmental history of this nation.

For me personally, I would be nothing without public schools. Reason being
that my parents were dirt-poor when I was growing up. The only reason I
got lunch was because of the free lunch program. And I definitely wouldn't
have been in private school had public school not been an option. I'd have
grown up to be a farmer.  Now I'm a computer programmer, supporting a
wife, mortgage and helping support my two younger brothers. So I don't
really agree with your premise. But I guess you have the problem solved,
so stick with it if it makes you feel better.

Capitalism is better than socialism. I believe that sincerely. We've tried
both and clearly capitalism inspires more ingenuity and it gives people
the incentive to strive beyond their station in life. However, to insist
that our present system of capitalism mixed with public funding is worse
than pure unfettered capitalism is absurd. Many parts of the public sector
have recently been deregulated and unleashed to the forces of capitalism
and pure capitalism has failied miserably.

Corruption, greed, lying, cheating, stealing, polluting, these are the
hallmarks of boundless capitalism. It's funny that you're going on this
rant in a time when the relatively unfettered capitalism of the 90s has
disintegrated into mess of deceit and greed and a collosal loss of
capital. Stock analysts lying about stocks to make more money for larger
clients, CEOs building company revenue by evading taxes and hiding losses
in shell companies, these are just a couple examples of what's being
uncovered as we speak. If this is your Utopia, then you can keep it.

> I do support Linux as a technology, I don't mind it being free, but I

Don't "mind" it being free? How big of you. I'll bet Linus will be glad to
hear he's won your approval. Point is, it IS fre, whether you mind or not.
The people who contribute to it want it to be free. Who are you to mind
what people want to do with software THEY produce and give back to the
community at large? It's a pretty ridiculous position to take to say that
you love the technology and are basically "putting up" with the fact that
it's free. Part of the reason why the technology is what it is is because
it's free.

> totally support Capitalistic entities making money off of software.
> Public Schools are just not the place to teach this.  They provide

Did you go to a public school? If so, then I'd agree with your last
sentence, given the fact that you can't seem to separate the ideal
of capitalism from the reality.

Linux (I use Linux mostly as a server, not as a client as much as I'd

Private schools provide far far far far... I could continue... education

This depends on what business you are in.  If I were building cars and
didn't need intelligent workers, just someone to watch a
computer/machine put together parts, sure I'd want lemmings.  Point is
that "public" schools are part of the problem, not the solution.

It wasn't founded on it, but public schools certainly have their place
in
the developmental history of this nation.

Maybe in the last 50 years.  Along with the separation of money from the
gold standard, the decreased standards of education, the devolving state
of average standards of living in the country, the horrible state of
transportation, the wonderful pollution committed by subsidized, welfare
enabled industry (aka government manipulation)...  yeah the public
school system has helped significantly in the development of these
things.

For me personally, I would be nothing without public schools. Reason
being
that my parents were dirt-poor when I was growing up. The only reason I
got lunch was because of the free lunch program. And I definitely
wouldn't
have been in private school had public school not been an option. I'd
have
grown up to be a farmer.  Now I'm a computer programmer, supporting a
wife, mortgage and helping support my two younger brothers. So I don't
really agree with your premise. But I guess you have the problem solved,
so stick with it if it makes you feel better.

I don't bring personal statement into arguments such as this, I'd
probably call you a friend, but you probably wouldn't if I brought
personal stories into play because then you would attack mine, and I
would attack yours.

We as a country support more and more government intrusion in our

Capitalism is better than socialism. I believe that sincerely. We've
tried
both and clearly capitalism inspires more ingenuity and it gives people
the incentive to strive beyond their station in life. However, to insist
that our present system of capitalism mixed with public funding is worse
than pure unfettered capitalism is absurd. Many parts of the public
sector
have recently been deregulated and unleashed to the forces of capitalism
and pure capitalism has failied miserably.

Pure capitalism built the country.  If you think unfettered capitalism
created a bad environment check your premises.  It was usually a few
people who traded pull at the top levels of government, pushed and
pulled favors and allowed certain companies/corporations to overtake and
destroy competition.  Check your history and you would see.  Capitalism
could be argued quit effectively to have done MORE for this country than
the democratic government.  Capitalism, "unfettered" capitalism is what
gave the US the ability to utilize the mind, and our natural resources
better than any country in the world, democratic or not.

Corruption, greed, lying, cheating, stealing, polluting, these are the
hallmarks of boundless capitalism. It's funny that you're going on this
rant in a time when the relatively unfettered capitalism of the 90s has
disintegrated into mess of deceit and greed and a collosal loss of
capital. Stock analysts lying about stocks to make more money for larger
clients, CEOs building company revenue by evading taxes and hiding
losses
in shell companies, these are just a couple examples of what's being
uncovered as we speak. If this is your Utopia, then you can keep it.

This would be very incorrect.  Most business is done on good faith,
without lies, deceipt, polluting, stealing, cheating, or lying.  These
things are generally introduced only when Government and Politics are
introduced into an industry.  I've been in many business'.  All traded
mutual value for mutual value.  The only one that ever changed was when
it began to be "regulated" for the sake of the "people".  Eventually it
got regulated to death, 5 people became unemployed, and all value was
lost.  Because it was theoretically better for the people.

Evading taxes is a good thing if you think of it this way... A company
spends 50k dollars, employs a good person who can then provide for
themselves, or if so chosen a family and even others.  The government
spends 50k dollars a employs 1/10th of a person who is generally about
1/3rd to 1/4th as productive as a private sector employee.  -Yeah this
could be verified with research.

> I do support Linux as a technology, I don't mind it being free, but I

Don't "mind" it being free? How big of you. I'll bet Linus will be glad
to
hear he's won your approval. Point is, it IS fre, whether you mind or
not.
The people who contribute to it want it to be free. Who are you to mind
what people want to do with software THEY produce and give back to the
community at large? It's a pretty ridiculous position to take to say
that
you love the technology and are basically "putting up" with the fact
that
it's free. Part of the reason why the technology is what it is is
because
it's free.

I don't mind it being free...  But I generally "buy" distributions from
some company because I find "value" in the software.  If I pay for it I
am supporting it, if I download it for free I am indirectly saying "This
software is worthless to me, if it cost money it is nothing."  But this
isn't my take, so generally I spend my own money, and companies money on
centrally controlled distributions.

> totally support Capitalistic entities making money off of software.
> Public Schools are just not the place to teach this.  They provide
> nothing but mediocrity.

Did you go to a public school? If so, then I'd agree with your last
sentence, given the fact that you can't seem to separate the ideal
of capitalism from the reality.

I went to 6 years of public school, realized it was a waste of time and
moved on.  Went to a public college, realized that if one is
individualistic and has self determination they do not need to waste
their time waiting for the public education system to "allow" them to
proceed in life.  I took it upon myself and now am in a much better
position than 90% of the people in the United States because I didn't
follow some sorry for myself socialistic attitude about life and expect
a mediocre system to provide me a real education.

If it did provide a good education for you Preston, and you had nothing
to do with your learning, everything you got was totally from the public
school, and everything the government tells you has benefited you and is
true and honest... then you have succeded greatly.  If you only garnered
what you needed, and generally attained your education with your derived
skills and analysis of life you should check your premises and realize,
the school didn't give it to you, "you" did.  You can claim school
provided it for you, even think it did.  But if the premise is truth,
then the greater chance lies in the possibility you provided yourself
90% of what you had and have.

-- --  Now I am truly done with this conversation as it is diverging
onto philosophy and one's attitude of life.  My point was that providing
a free ride for the school system that probably won't help the Linux
cause is a waste of energy.  It would be better infiltrating MS user
bases within businesses.

  Wasn't the purpose of the Linux Stanard Base (or File System Hierarchy,

Rich,

go to linuxandmain.net (?) or to Linuxtoday.com to get there. There are 
some articles about UL. It has been discussed heavilly on another list 
that I am on. Seems to be mostly another of Ransom Loves lousy 
business ideas where he is also conned some others into taking the 
fall with him. Who knows tho.  But it is definitly NOT going to be

Hello,

>   Wasn't the purpose of the Linux Stanard Base (or File System
Hierarchy,
> IIRC) to do exactly what UL is proposing? 

LSB was created as an effort to standardize locations for libraries,
conf files and init files. 
Every Linux vendor may voluntary obey or disobey LSB compliance. It
wasn't a mandatory requirement.

United Linux consortium put certain mandatory LSB restrains and
standards to follow for the each member of UL. Therefore all UL
participants will work together to create UL distribution and in the
same time produce their own distros totally compatible between each
other. It will be easier for hardware vendors to produce UL compatible
hardware. 

There is another purpose of UL to topple RH dominancy. 
Just an example:
Nowdays many commercial HW vendors put on their boxes "Works with Red
Hat Linux" as a sign of compatibility with Linux. 
But there are at least 60 other Linux versions in America, Europe and
around the globe. What about them? What's an ignorance!  
Haven't you noticed that for a lot of people,especially in US,
Linux=RH? It is not a true and for me it sounds very obsessive.
Kicking RH out of dominance will prevent it from becoming another fat
and bloated a'la M$ Linux software giant.

One question I have is how they can charge per seat licensing. Maybe my
understanding of the GPL isn't very good, so could someone fill me

There is a time and place for everything.  I saw the humor in your post, but
it wasn't the appropriate place for it.  Plug-talk would have been much
better.  I know that you and Russell like to write persuasive arguments and
you are both good at it, but you don't realize how much you destroy that
persuasiveness when you use profanity.  A much higher percentage of people
than you think are turned off by it.  You can write a very good argument and
completely lose any effect by adding one word because the person reading it
will stop reading.

I don't care if my customers cuss or not. It's unprofessional to cuss (with 
or not, in frustration or not) in the presence or your customers.

I can't remember a single boss I've had, since working in a gas station, 
that cussed on the job. Now, at social functions is another matter 
entirely. Now, maybe I've got the wrong idea, and this list isn't about 
forwarding the Linux ideals and the OS. If not, then it's purely social, so 
cuss away.

AH, but it IS a customer resource. We made it one by archiving the list in 
public. Do a search for most anything linux on google, and you'll get hits 
from the plug list archives. That makes it a resource, for customers and 
otherwise. Wether you want it that way or not, your customers can find it. 
If they find it, they will use it. If they use it, they will see our behavior.

Besides, what I'm paying for if I do as you suggest is a one on one 
relationship to get that problem fixed. Yes, I'm also paying for 
professionalism, but how hard is it to be professional all the time? Do you 
HAVE to cuss when your not being professional?

>Like Linus said, when it stops being fun, I'll stop doing it.

So you have to cuss to be having fun? How sad. :)

I think the reason they can charge for a per seat licencing is due to 
their propriatary software included with the distro.

The LSB ideally has a lot of merit. However practically, I think it has 
turned out to be a waste of time. I don't know of any single distro that 
actually adheres to it unfortunately. The only distro that I know of that 
has even stuck with the same file structure throughout various 
incarnations is Debian. Even the spinoffs keep the same filestructure 
so as to be compatible. 

To me this is one of the big failings of Linux. Not adhering to some 
standard file structure by the various distros so that the packaging 
systems would all work across the distros. It is also one of the 
reasons why I think that Linux will NOT make general desktop 
distribution throughout the masses. If Joe Blow wants to install a 
program to his Linux machine he should not have to care if its a 
specific RPM for his particular distro. Any RPM should load on any 
distro without errors.

Thats my rant. Like it or leave it.

That's just it. *I* don't. Everyone I knows can count the number of cuss 
words that have come out of my mouth on one hand. As far as I'm concerned, 
everyone I meet is a potential client, and as such, I present the best I 
can, always.

I'm not censoring myself, or acting different, or some such nonsense. I 
simply have different ways of expressing myself, and don't feel the need to 
utter explicatives when frustrated. To do so, and blame it on the 
environment is a cop out. Even my grandfather knew that cussing to express 
yourself was a cop out. There are so many other ways to express yourself, 
and/or vent your frustration.

thought out, and articulate argument instead of a rant with cuss words 
every other word.

Not to mention that I find that the number of cuss words in a statement is 
inversely proportional to the validity of the argument.

We all laugh at this when it's a redneck talking about how the minority 
they hate should be wiped from the face of the earth, but when it's us, we 
get all defensive and cuss more.

In other words, the "color" isn't needed, and MORE people will listen to 
the speech without the color.

While Freedom of speech is probably the best of the Freedoms we have, it is
not absolute.  There are restrictions on it.  Murder can be a strong
expression and make a load statement, but that doesn't make it protected
free speech.  For some reason, a lot of people in this country have decided
that pornography and profanity is protected free speech.  They is not.  Your
argument is too simplistic to have any meaning and I can't take anything
seriously from someone who is hiding their name.

If the "brats" were treated with respect, and taught "Do unto others as you 
would like them to do unto you" (exactly the same idea, without any 
cussing) then maybe they wouldn't be brats. Cussing at someone is showing 
that person disrespect.

We're about 2 generations into letting the schools teach behavior. Since 
the schools don't have time, and many of the parents don't take the time, 
our kids tend to be more free and wild than their parents.

Subject: [PLUG] "Phantom" telnet processes (?)
Message-ID: <1022863378.21113.51.camel@Dustpuppy>

Hi all,

  One of the servers that I've recently taken over has developed an
interesting quirk: It *appears* that it's not releasing telnet
connections after the user disconnects.  It may help if I give a little
bit more information...

  This company is using a terminal program on Windows 98/2000
workstations that access this server in order to run a proprietary,
Pick-based in-house application.  When the user initiates a disconnect,
even if we go so far as to reboot the workstation, the telnet process
that they initiated appears to not be released.  Eventually (after about
6 days or so), they run out of available telnet connections, so they've
been re-booting the server at night.  Now for the "stunner": This isn't
Linux, it's an AIX 4.3 system!

  I am just starting this job, so I don't know a lot of the history
involved here, although I have worked (a little bit) with AIX 4 before.
I know that almost everyone on this list is a lot more familiar with
Linux/BSD, but can anyone perhaps offer up some tips or pointers of
possible "likely culprits"?

Many thanks,

T.

I've been using OSX for a while on my PowerBook G4 and although it was a
little weird to get used to I'm finding my UNIX utilities to be available
for the most part. Aqua has a bit of work left but I'd rather be using it
than a lot of window managers I've seen/used. On my FreeBSD box I
religiously use OpenMotif.

With Apple keeping themselves onboard with the FreeBSD community and getting
Hubbard on deck they've begun work on getting OSX closer to the UNIX
development community without stepping on so may toes. If you'll also notice
may *BSD sites are carrying OSX sections and a lot of OpenSource developers
are getting their source to recognize OSX/Darwin. Take for example the
latest version of ntop, it has an aquafied interface and compiles fine on
OSX.

As long as I had a bungee-cord looped about my waist and/or feet, I'd 
jump.  Hell, I'd probably go first.

Wil's point was that NOBODY gave a rat's ass.  There wasn't a big 
uproar.  And there usually isn't - unless someone happens to have a 
problem with the PERSON who says it.  In this particular case, Jeme.  I 
didn't see ANY difference between what Jeme said and what others have 
said in the past, as Wil pointed out.  However, Jeme was called on it 
for some unknown reason, and he happened to go off.

If you don't object to anyone ELSE'S use of particular words, you 
shouldn't object to ANYONE'S use of those same words.

What terminal program is being used?  I would try logging in using

I'd like to put in a word for Mr. Dealy, for he made a constructive
suggestion (albeit a familiar one) that we create a plug-help list in
addition to this one; but I'm afraid the idea was drowned out by the din
of that vulgarity debate (which at that point amounted to a futile melee
over our right to say "fuck" without starting a flame war).

Disregarding that dispute, I think Shannon's suggestion has merit
without its unfortunate context, for it seems to me the contents of this
list can well be divided into two main categories:  technical
cooperation and political debate.  Both seem important to PLUG members,
and both are generally considered to be on topic.  Putting on my
engineer hat for a moment, this seems like a clear and natural
bifurcation for this list, though I know there are other types of posts
than these two.  While I occasionally enjoy our intellectual pissing
contests, the primary reason I read PLUG is to learn how to use
GNU/Linux, to ask how-to type questions of my own and to learn from
those of others.  So usually I just find these (occasional?) political
uproars to be distracting--interesting, but distracting.  (And who
knows, maybe some people just read PLUG for the politics and are
distracted by all the technical stuff.)

The plug-help (or plug-tech) notion has failed in the past because, I
guess, people like the idea of this one central, general-purpose
discussion list.  Well, I admit I am among them (it's a "community"
thing!), but I think the idea of trying to divert some of the technical
questions to another list is not necessarily incompatible with that
fancy.

Here's an example for the OO programmers out there (indulge me, for I
like to pretend I am a great master of analogy).  Say you're coding a
singleton class, and your source file gets to be 2000 lines long.  What would
you do?  Well, I for one would try to extract some of its functionality
into a helper class.  (See the parallel there?  HELPer class? 
plug-HELP?)  You haven't really changed the design, you've just pulled
things apart a little so that you can focus on them more easily.

Coming back to the real world as I know it, this separate list may also
serve to placate those who would rather PLUG were a mere resource, pure
and "professional", for I expect a plug-help list, where even
Linux-related political banter would be discouraged, would naturally be
a cleaner forum.  (Or more sterile, if you prefer.  I personally don't
mind the "profanity" at all, but I'm trying to be practical here.) 
Probably we would find it harder to get people to ask technical
questions on the new list than to keep the flame wars out of it.

And yes, we have about a dozen PLUG lists already (most of which enjoy
very little traffic), but does that really matter?  I suggest a
plug-help-or-tech-or-something-like-that list, considering the confused
burden this one bears, would probably serve us well.

The terminal program is Accuterm, but I'll definitely try both of these
others out to see if that makes any difference.  And thanks for the

How about this:

This list and its current sub-faction lists arte fine and work fine.

If you're in the situation of introducing Linux to a new and possibly 
interested party, why not condition that person's expectations first?

Ex: "It's a great forum to get help and encouragement, and to keep up with 
new things people are trying and succeeding at with Linux. Some participants 
are Linux professionals but on the whole, list members come from all walks of 
life. It's pretty much un-censored, so along with great technical tidbits, 
you likely encounter a wide variety of opinions and social mores. But that 
diversity is part of what gives Linux such a wide appeal."

Anyways.

For the record, I can have a pretty foul mouth.  But I use it pretty
selectively, determined by circumstances.  (Rarely written... to me it just
lacks the punch of the spoken variety, so I don't bother unless it really
fits the situation perfectly.)

I usually don't get offended by language, and don't think it needs
censoring... but think over-reliance on certain words to be borderline
silly, and lacking in creative communicative ability.  (FWIW, I thought your
conversation the other day was hilarious, but am not suprised that some took
offense.  But calling them "stupid"... aren't they allowed to think
differently, without being insulted as well?)

And don't forget... over-use of intensifiers can degrade the intensifying
effect.  (In music, if half the song is played fortissimo, you've lost half
of the communicative effect of dynamics.  Likewise sending email with the
caps-lock on.  A memo with 30% of the text in bold.  The boy that cried
wolf.  And so on.)


> Can you name an adverb that is an intensifier that expresses distaste?

That's way too easy.  How about something as bland and generic as
"scum-sucking"?  You could probably think of up 20 without even getting
interesting.

To me, that question is a cop-out.  That's not even the work of a *good*
cusser.  Good cussers are outstanding communicators, and convey LOTS of
meaning packed with LOTS of emotion.  Sometimes WITHOUT relying heavily on
what people consider "cusswords".


Some examples in media that you can listen to:

Best cusser on the planet:  Mel Blank, as Yosemite Sam.

You always knew exactly what he meant.  Even though he was speaking complete
nonsense, there were no doubts as to what he was communicating.  All the
while making up a new language on the spot, to suit his needs.  And pulling
it off beautifully, in front of kids no less... in a way that doesn't offend
the notoriously picky "protect my kids from all evil" types of parents.  All
I can say is "Wow, that's good".

Runner up:	R. Lee Ermey as Gunny Hartman (Full Metal Jacket)

Did he use language that most would consider obscene?  Hell, yeah he did.
But did he just sit there and rattle off 4 letter words like any idiot
could, hoping that would make his point?  Heck no.  He actually used them
very specifically (almost sparingly) in combinations with other phrases,
like a healthy shot of tabasco right in the middle of a big salad.  The
result could sear the paint off a battleship.  Absolutely brutal.


I'm sure there are more.  But that's good for a start.


> All slang exists to make up for a lack in the academic language.

My point... why rely on academic language at all?  Why rely on any
predefined words, including slang?

String a bunch of words and sounds together your own way, combining
meanings, in phrases.  Make them work for you, to say exactly what you want.


That's the *nix way of doing things anyway, isn't it? :]

That's bologna.  Jeme was singled out because he went way over the top.  He
used the f-word over and over again in a single post as well as other words.
It was his actions that caused him to be singled out, not who he is.

The point that I was trying to make is not that we should censor him, but
that he is hurting himself.  He is losing credibility by doing this.

	Thanks for the sample text.  I wish that I would have
thought to preface my comments to my adminstrator in the manner
you have suggested. Once things settle a bit I will have another
conversation that includes the selling points related to Linux as opposed
to using the mailing list as an example of the collegial support and
assistance that is available.
	If I would have exercised more thought and careful consideration
I could have prevented her shock as well as the resulting posts to the
list.  Thanks to all who have offered suggestions and been understanding
about the position that I admittedly brought upon myself.

You plan on kicking your kids out of the house at age 7?

I have met parents who want their kids to stay at age 7 no matter how
old they get.  (Usually for religious reasons.)

The "kinky sex" analogy has *nothing* to do with the language
discussions here.  It is a straw man distraction, it has little to do
with the discussion at hand.

Would I teach my kid about "kinky sex" at seven? Depends on if she was
exposed to people like that at that age.  I guess it depends on who your
friends are.  (Or what kind of scene your kid just walked in on. "Mommy!
What are you doing to Daddy!")  Teaching them to knock first is even
better.

"Profanity is the first language of the programmer."

Is profanity "profesional"?  Depends on your definition of "profesional"
I guess.

This argument went on for months on the Linux kernel list.  Some people
objected to the language used in the kernel comments.  (Comments were
things like "this hardware model is really fucked up".)  The swearing
was not gratuitous, but described the frustration the programmer had
with that section of code.

It is *not* unusual to find those comments in professional source code. 
Netscape had lots of them.  (One of the big delays on release of the
source code was removing all the profane comments sprinkeled throughout
the code.)  Having looked at the early code, I understand why they were
there.

It is a very common practice by profesionals.  It occurs regularly in
source and on the job.  It is only when you start dealing with
management types that it becomes "unacceptable". 

In my experience, when some one cries "that is not profesional
behaviour", they see or hear something that they don't like.  Either it
is someone using a word that they do not like, or making a joke that
they do not like, or just having a little bit too much fun. It is a term
used to control.  To keep people in line.  It has little to do with what
really goes on when work is done.  It is a term used by people who
prefer nice words over blunt honesty.

Does profesional behaviour apply here?  It does when you start paying
for my services.  Since I know what a cheap lot of bastards PLUG members
are, I know that will never happen and tailor my comments accordingly.

People choose this forum because we give good advice, not because we sit
still with out hands folded in our laps.

If they don't like it, then they can pay $150/hr for advice from people
who may or may not know what they are doing, but wear the right suit and
tell you what you want to hear.

There's a PDF poster you can download, print out, and hang up at work or

Does anyone have a preferred place for laser printer repair?  My TI
Microlaser jams every time it tries to pull paper from the tray.  The

It's probably just an aging pickup roller. When the roller rubber gets
old and hard and brittle it loses its ability to grip a sheet of paper
as it's fed from the tray.

I've been thrilled to hear of Apple's efforts to make OSX part of the
unix and open-source community as much as they have.  It's to the
point where I'm retooling my conversion kits to use OSX instead of
Net/OpenBSD for Mac hardware when people want Mac BSD servers.  I can
see that as OSX matures within the unix community, more and more people
will come up with methods for tuning the OS.  My only hope is that
Apple will realize the real opportunity they have and just how much
they will gain if they mature OSX in a way that will provide the unix
community the means to tweak OSX into a "master of one" tuned server.
I, for one, am tired of the mediocre performance Net and OpenBSD give
on Mac hardware that, specwise, should give better performance than PC
hardware.

I'll second the pickup roller diagnosis. Rubbing alcohol on the rubber
will do wonders for its grip.

Subject: [PLUG] Returned mail: see transcript for details (fwd)
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205311613450.2505-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I have a very puzzling mail problem here that started only when I
installed postfix and had the DNS MX record pointed here first.

  Each day, 'root' sends a summary of mail activities to
'postmaster at salmo.appl-ecosys.com'. Notice the hostname as part of the
domain name in the address.

  As you'll see in the headers below, smtpd sends the message from root up
to mail3.aracnet.com where it gets messed up with too many hops. (So,
apparently, too many hops mess up mail systems as well as human systems.)
Why isn't the mail delivered locally by postfix?

  If I log in as root and try sending a message to
postmaster at appl-ecosys.com, postfix refuses to send it. It's rejected,
probably as spam, although I cannot read the full message in pine.

  This is the only message that gets this treatment. It is definitely a flaw
in my system and I'd really like to clear it up. A couple of folks on the
mailhelp mailing list are helping, too, but the more minds applied to the
problem the greater the liklihood that I'll resolve this quickly.

  At some time in the Real Soon Now future, Aracnet's outstanding SysAdmin
(said seriously, not sarcastically) will change our DNS record so the IP
address points to appl-ecosys.com rather than salmo.appl-ecosys.com. I've no
idea if this has anything to do with my problem.

Grasping at straws,

Rich

The docs don't say so, but is it possible to configure winbindd to 
use a default domain?  And create the user's home directory on the fly?

Actually, I remember being told (by an HP tech) that while rubbing alcohol
will work fine, it can actually dry out the roller and get it crumbling
faster over time.

Now if I could only remember what it was (some other common, cheap
household-type chemical) she recommended using instead.

Subject: [PLUG] Serial console with grub
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205311754580.4272-100000@billings.heinlein.net>

I finally got the time to experiment with having a grub-loaded kernel 
use a serial port as its main console (very handy for remote 
administration!). What follows is part of the documentation I prepared 
on the subject for work...

--Paul Heinlein <heinlein at cse.ogi.edu>

...

This is a short cookbook-style document. A much better and more
complete discussion of this issue can be found in the Linux
Documentation Project's "Remote Serial Console HOWTO."

Red Hat's 2.2.x and 2.4.x kernels are all capable of using a
serial port as their default console. If you're building a custom
kernel, make sure you set CONFIG_SERIAL_CONSOLE=y during the
configuration process.

Note: In the directives provided below, I assume that the serial
console will always be connected to ttyS0 (COM1). You'll have to
season things to taste should you connect it to a different serial
port.

Once you've got a Linux host booting with grub, the recipe for letting
it use a serial console is pretty basic:

1. Edit /etc/grub.conf (=> /boot/grub/grub.conf). See the grub info
   page for the details about the directives listed below. The grub
   configuration file is line-oriented, and I think that directives
   can NOT be continued between lines. IOW, each directive needs a
   line to itself, and cannot be continued on the next line.

   a. In the opening section, add 'serial' and 'terminal' definitions,
      e.g.,

      serial --unit=0 --speed=9600 --word=8 --parity=no --stop=1
      terminal --timeout=5 serial console

   b. Remove or comment out any 'splashimage' directives. Failure to
      do so will mean you won't have access to the grub boot menu at
      boot time.

   c. Add 'console' parameters to each 'kernel' directive. Say, for
      example, that the default kernel directive as installed by Red
      Hat looks like this:

      kernel /vmlinuz ro root=/dev/hda1

      Your edited version will specify two consoles, one a normal tty,
      the other a serial port:

      kernel /vmlinuz ro root=/dev/hda1 console=tty0 console=ttyS0

      The console specified last is used when you open /dev/console,
      so in my example serial port ttyS0 would be the default
      console. See Documentation/serial-console.txt in the Linux
      kernel sources for a more complete discussion of the 'console='
      flags that get passed to the kernel.

      You can append the console flags at kickstart time by appending
      them to the bootloader directive:

      bootloader --append "console=tty0 console=ttyS0"

2. Edit /etc/inittab so that a getty is spawned on ttyS0 in all
   working runlevels, e.g.,

   # serial console
   con:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty ttyS0 9600 vt100

   See the inittab(8) and agetty(8) man pages for more details.

3. Edit /etc/securetty to ensure root can login via a serial
   port. This merely involves adding a line for your tty at the end of
   the file, e.g.,

   ttyS0

4. Finally, delete /etc/ioctl.save and reboot.

Thanks to everyone for their suggestions.  I went to www.fixyourownprinter.com
and asked for help.  From the response I received, it sounds like I need a new
pickup assembly.  Alas, parts for my printer are no longer available.  I
gave it my best shot cleaning the rollers with some Teac rubber cleaner.
It didn't help.  I may try calling The Printer Place tomorrow, but I suspect
that I'll be shopping for a new printer.

>From what I could tell, www.fixyourownprinter.com is a very useful site.  If
you are having printer problems, it is definitely worth checking out.

thanks again,

And I just saw a fantastic crash course in Applescript from Apple

from Applescript from GUIs.  Amazing.

It's not FreeBSD.  It never has been.  It's the Mach kernel, with many
BSD tools for userspace, mostly grabbed from the freebsd heritage.
But that's like saying "Linux is GNU".  It's not.  It has a unique
kernel, and userspace tools are drawn from the GNU project.

That crazy rumor keeps going around.   It needs to die soon.

<cool stuff snipped>

Okay, I was raised on windows and missed out on all this cool oldtimey stuff. 
What do you do with this? How does the remote part work, is it connected by a 
serial cable to another PC? Is this meant to replace a NIC?

thanks,
Carla

Some of us still have dumb terminals, modems, line driver units, etc.

Why do this for a new system, in this day and age?  Not all computers

just workhorses, why pay for video cards on each when you won't use
them?

I assume by "hibernate" that you mean "suspend" where the computer keeps
everything in ram but shuts down the screen, hard drive, CPU, etc., so you
can quickly power-up and pickup where you left off.  I have done this
successfully on my old laptop, but haven't used the feature with the
latest upgrades or gnome (I don't use this laptop much these days).  As
far as what you need, it requires APM (advanced power management) be
compiled into the kernel or a kernel module.  There are also some options
to look at which are specific to some poorly behaved laptops when you
select the APM option.  Aside from the kernel option(s), you need the
program "apmd" which provides the interface to the power management system
and does things like reset the Linux time when the system powers back up
and other power management related stuff.  This setup worked fine for me
using fvwm and ice window managers (never tried Gnome or KDE).

I'm working from memory of an older configuration, so there may be some
differences with the latest stuff, perhaps someone else on the list has
done this more recently.

I've maintained my own cassette decks and was a audio repair tech for years. 
      All I've ever used was 92% Isopropol alcohol on pinch rollers (some 
cost over $300).  I've heard the same warnings about drying, but never 
experienced it.  Note that common rubbing alcohol has many 
impurities/additives and is *not* what you should use.  (But it probably 
wouldn't matter in a printer if you did.)

There are rubber reconditioners that contain TCE, but I only used that nasty 
stuff to confirm the rubber needed replacing.
