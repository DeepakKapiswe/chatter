The best way to copy from one usb device to another is to get a usb 
device crossover cable with an inductive serial tap.  Attach one of the 
devices to reversed-polarity AC current to initiate the peer-to-peer 
mode.  Then attach the receiving end of the IST to your serial port and 
connect to it with your favorite terminal emulator.  Follow the 
on-screen instructions.

Of course, you might not be able to get all of the needed hardware until 
April 2nd.  By then the technology will have moved on and this 
procedure won't work anymore.  Should you find yourself in such a 
situation, there's always 'man dd', though you'll only get half of the 
transfer rate that way.

                              Disaster Recovery
                                     with
                  Linux disk imaging and bare-metal restore

                                           Acronis Inc.

      Last month Brian Martin from Martin Consulting discussed his
      personal experience with disaster recovery in a real world
      situation.  This month Jerome Boutaud and Stephan Lawton
      will be discussing and demonstrating the nuts and bolts
      of disaster recovery with different Linux distributions.
      They will also discuss the differences between image-based
      backup and file-based backup, why the distinction is so
      important in the recovery phase of a disaster, and the
      advantages and disadvantages of each.

      *******************************************************************

          Agenda:

              7:00 - 7:30  Business
                   We will discuss the status of our ongoing projects
                   including PLUG's monthly Advanced Topics meetings,
                   PLUG's monthly hands on clinics, PLUG for Education,
                   etc.

                   Also, there are changes coming for LinuxFund.
                   I will spend a few minutes discussing these.

Just wondering if you could associate the .sh to an xterm -c $0 so that
it would open a terminal window and you could see what it is doing.
Also see any errors you may be getting.

As the simplest way to reply to all that offered suggestions I'm just 
replying to my own post.  First of all thanks.

Well the Lobby wireless was a pay for service and all their instructions 
were for "Windows".  I'm not yet familiar enough with the N800 to figure 
out the Linux-Way to do a pay-as-you-go hot spot.  So I went to my son's 
house and used his wireless when  I really needed to.

Well it seems Linksys has both a WRT54GS and a WTR54GS.  I saw the 
characters but didn't catch the different ordering in the responses from 
Google.com.  The WTR54GS is what I'll look into some more.  I couldn't 
find one in Couer d'Alene and was leaving Thursday afternoon so I now 
have more time to research.
    I am hoping that a dd-wrt kernel can be installed.  It offers some 
_very_ nice features over the stock kernel.

Again thanks for the suggestions.

If you go with a Linksys, these days you'll need the WRT54GL in order
to flash alternate firmware (like dd-wrt or openwrt).  The Meraki runs
linux under the covers too, and is supported these days by OpenWrt's
development branch, I think.

Message-ID: <20070402104810.9d6sskvcgo8ooc4k@web.robinson-west.com>

Well, I spend most of my time in Fedora Bordeaux.

I have XP Home, but we all know how much of a pain reinstalling that can
be.  I don't fancy Windows and I have decided to avoid Vista.

Sure, maybe I should kick up to Zod or switch to Ubuntu.

The question is, what is this Insight debugger Michael wants me to use and
what is the equivalent for a true Linux environment?

Should I run Cygwin under a vmware player installation of Windows XP?

The course is CS200 at PCC, online version.  I checked out PSU, but they
don't seem to be offering 200 and I want to avoid grade averaging.

I'm a little bummed that Michael is a part time instructor, that means he
will be tough to reach.

Any idea why professor Trigoboff recommends using Cygwin as the only
option he will support?  I wonder if I am missing something.  At Cygwin's
site, the whole why cygwin question doesn't seem to be in the FAQ.

Message-ID: <20070402170125.lzxwc4v808w40g08@web.robinson-west.com>

RFC 821                                                      August 1982
                                            Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

    3.5.  OPENING AND CLOSING

       At the time the transmission channel is opened there is an
       exchange to ensure that the hosts are communicating with the hosts
       they think they are.

       The following two commands are used in transmission channel
       opening and closing:

          HELO <SP> <domain> <CRLF>

          QUIT <CRLF>

       In the HELO command the host sending the command identifies
       itself; the command may be interpreted as saying "Hello, I am
       <domain>".

Okay, but a lot of people seem to think that helo checking is futile and
more trouble than it's worth.  I run a postfix relay on my firewall  
perimeter where I wonder what the best practice is in this day and  
age.  I asked Opus
and got a completely worthless answer back of, "you can do whatever you want."
By domain in this excerpt, there is not enough context to know what is being
referred to specifically.  Is it a DNS domain name or could it be some other
kind?  How about rejecting a helo of localhost, friend, of the domain name
of my own server?

If one drops to just using spamassassin to tag spam, the problem with
this approach is that spam isn't left on the spammer's server.  Even
if you have procmail shove suspected spam into a spam folder, it is
still on your system.  The beauty of accept and classify is that you
still receive if the tests are wrong, but I have yet to see
spamassassin be wrong.

What is EHLO compared to HELO?

What's the big deal about this anyways?

I see there is an effort to add it to gcc, though I am not certain why.

I guess Win32 is based on SEH.  The ReactOS project is pursuing it
where I tried to look at a linked Microsoft article on it, but I
quickly got bogged down and gave up.

Who wants to implement Microsoft style SEH if it's hidden in Windows
and Visual Studio?  Is SEH responsible for those incredibly informative
blue screens of death in Windows?

I guess Alex Ionescu interviewed with Microsoft for an internship only
to give up because they told him he'd have to forever halt his work on
ReactOS and TinyKrnl.  He made some comment in a blog that NDA's, non
disclosure agreements, are usually not permanent.

Insight is a GUI front end to gdb written by RedHat.  It is okay, but
seemed kinda buggy to me the last time I tried it.  As far as Cygwin
versus Linux for Insight, you should be able to run it on Linux just
fine.

I don't have the knowledge of how stuff works to offer much
conversation here, but I do have a Realtek gigabit. It's an RTL-8169SC
on an Abit NF-M2S motherboard. Luckily I can disable it in the BIOS and
substitute a 10/100 card from Free Geek. If I enable it in the BIOS the
boot process locks up with a kernel panic over the IRQ. There may be
some boot options I could use that would help the situation, but I
haven't had time to do any experimenting. Maybe the cause of the
problem is because the RTL-8169 is on the motherboard instead of being
in a PCI slot. But hell, I don't even know what an IRQ is. Probably
some obscure alternate acronym for PITA.

I always thought Realtek was well supported on Linux. So when I saw
that the gigabit on the NF-M2S was Realtek I just assumed I would be
OK. My laptop has Realtek ethernet too, and it always works perfectly
regardless of what distro I try. There's a lot of chatter on the net
about the RTL-8169 and Linux. Some people have gotten it working, but
their fixes didn't work for me. I note also that it doesn't work any
better with 32-bit distros.

Should Linux be made to ignore problems like this and boot anyway? It
would be some help, but it doesn't solve the real problem.

I tried to be strict about HELO, and got too many false positives for spam.

The only thing I check for now for rejecting are people trying to say they are
me.  "HELO stonehenge.com" - I don't think so!  I also reject my own IP
address.

Thanks, I did some more reading on the subject and will get the rEFIt

Well I reinstalled MAC OS.  Installed rEFIt.  Installed SLES10.  It had

You can:
Verify the IP/DNS reported is valid.
Check if the supposed source has <various> anti-spam DNS entries.
Check (roughly) if the supposed sending IP actually *matches* the IP

I'm taking the class, but haven't had a chance to register yet, so I  
don't have a syllabus and such. Is this the Insight you're talking  
about: http://sourceware.org/insight/index.php ?

 From the looks of it, it's just a TCL/TK GUI for GDB and from Red  
Hat and Cygnus. It should work just fine for you in Fedora. According  
to aptitude, there's a package available for Ubuntu Feisty also  
(although it's 6.5, and the Insight site says 6.6 came out Feb 8.... : 
( )

I'd imagine that in the worst case Insight's entirely optional and  
that straight GDB would be sufficient.

And, sadly, there doesn't seem to be a MacPorts port for it. For  
whatever that's worth.

I'd guess because most of the class will be running Windows, and  
those of us running LInux can hopefully sort out to develop on it.

You can do all those, and you'll reject good email.  Trust me, been there,

This is one of the better guides I have found to this [1].  There a
quite a few things that get checked for depending on the server.  The
nice thing about rejecting mail immediately instead of down the line
with spamassassin is that the sender always gets feedback instead of
just a "why didn't you respond to my mail you jerk on the phone a week
later".  I find myself having to tweak, and retweak  the mail, and DNS
servers frequently to satisfy the receiving servers requirements.

goal is to put the hard drive contents on a bootable cd or dvd once we
get our fax server operating.  Secondly, a recommendation for a backup

Subject: [PLUG] usb keypad attachment to a shell??
Message-ID: <86k5ws11wb.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


I am working on an embedded platform (a single-board computer from an
access point running OpenWrt with a 2.6 kernel).  I want to add a usb
keypad for an input device, but I am not sure how to attach the input
to a shell.  The device gets recognized when I insmod the usbhid.ko
module.  I can "mknod c event0 13 64" and then read what I assume are
struct event out of the device.  

So, I suppose I could write a program to read input in userspace and
do the right thing, but I'd rather not do that from scratch if I
don't have to.

When I plug the keypad into my desktop, it seems to just get attached
to the console.  It works from a tty and in X.  I am ignorant of how
this attachment is taking place (so that I could duplicate it on the
OpenWrt device).  Can someone give me clues/pointers please?

Thanks!

Using sendmail -- which I realize isn't as fashionable these days as 
Postfix et al. -- SpamAssassin can be run as a milter. Its tests are 
run during the SMTP transaction and spam can be rejected with an SMTP 
550 message. The sending MTA, not the sending user, is notified of the 
rejection.

Assuming the MTA is legit, and not merely a zombie bot, the right 
person will be told that the message wasn't delivered because it looks 
and smells like spam.

If the MTA is actually a bot, it might decide to try again, or it 
might just continue on its merry (?) way like a telemarketer after a 
hang-up.

Subject: [PLUG] Linux on HP Slimline s7700n; Fry's returns
Message-ID: <20070404183606.GD2770@amethyst.spiritone.com>

In what I hoped would be the final step in my search for a small,
quiet, 64-bit, dual-core, VT-enabled (whew) machine, I bought an
s7700n at Fry's on Sunday.  I knew I might be returning it since it's
advertised as having an nvidea video subsystem.  We have a bunch of
Dells at work with nvidea chips, some of which work beautifully with
the FOSS drivers and some of which suck.

The s7700n sucked, even with the nvidia-supplied binary drivers in
Ubuntu.  It turned out that there's a bunch of other nvidea stuff on
there as well: sound, memory controller, ethernet, etc.  (Shoulda
saved the output of lspci.  Duh!)  Ethernet worked fine, as did memory
(obviously).  Sound did not work at all.  A few years back I'd have
spent hours or days updating drivers and tweaking kernel compile
options attempting to make the thing work, but I decided to return it
and to give my money to manufacturers that use Linux-friendly parts.
I'll get a Dell with Intel chips, more-n-likely.

A couple of days ago googling for 'linux HP slimline s7700n' didn't
turn anything up.  I hope this post helps with that a bit.

Anyway, returning the thing to Fry's was painless, but made me think
they haven't quite figured out Vista yet.  The machine came without
any media, but you're allowed to make a single set of "recovery" CDs
or DVDs.  One set, and that will work only on your machine.  After
you've made the set, even if you reinstall from that set, you can't
make another.  Since I was reformatting the drive to install Linux I
made the set, and used it to restore the drive before returning it.
But Fry's, after verifying that the machine was fine and reformatting
from the recovery partition, reboxed it with a discount price and
will, I assume, sell it to somebody who will eventually try to make
recovery disks.  I wonder how long it'll take folks to figure out
what's wrong.

(HP will sell you a set of disks for about $15 shipped.  Let's hope
Fry's discount on the box is more than that. :-)

If you mean you'd like to make a backup of your FAX server's hard drive,
Mondo Rescue can take care of that, making a bootable CD or DVD that can
restore the HDD from bare-metal.

If you're using a modern distro, you should be able to use
yum/apt-get/urpmi/whatever to install "mondo" or "mondorescue".

Subject: [PLUG] remote X diagnostics
Message-ID: <63280.170.135.112.12.1175716997.squirrel@mail.patch.com>

I run an X server, Exceed, on my desktop PC at work.  This is needed for some
programs that use an X based interface.  Occasionally I'll pop up the odd gvim
session for editing too.

So I know the X server setup is correct and will accept connections from numerous
hosts in our network.

Except for one.  I launch the X based program from it, nhiConsole, and the program
runs and reports to the terminal window that soon the X session will start.  Then
it doesn't.  PS shows the program running, I'm just not having the session pop up
on my PC.  I double, triple check the DISPLAY environment variable on the client
computer and it's fine.

Meanwhile the guy in the next cube is using the same software stack and getting a
session on his PC with no problem.  I'm also going to a different server and
running the same command and everything works fine.

What's the next thing to do in trouble shooting this problem?

My exceed log doesn't show anything.

Can you run xclock correctly on that machine? How are you connecting
to that host? Is your coworker using nhiConsole off the same server,
and using the same remote connection method? (iirc, ssh servers have
to be configured to do X redirection, if that's what you're doing --
it could be setup incorrectly on that host, or you may have a personal
setting in your home dir on that machine that disables X
redirection--I'm not sure that last thing is possible, but it might
be.)

If all that checks out, nhiConsole may be a script that tries to do
something smart and set a dynamic DISPLAY variable, or --DISPLAY param
based on your environment.  If this is buggy it could be returning the
wrong display.

This is almost certainly *not* the problem, but the app _is_ called
nhiConsole -- is there a nhiGui that may be more reliable?

      They will also discuss the differences between image-based
      backup and file-based backup, why the distinction is so
      important in the recovery phase of a disaster, and the
      advantages and disadvantages of each.

Hi David,
   
  I tried to contact Terry Lyne about some MDIS Realityx manuals he had way back 2003.  Is he still a member and if so how do I contact him?

Subject: [PLUG] DMZ and iptables
Message-ID: <200704041749.23121.carla@bratgrrl.com>

I've gone all wacko and insecure over my iptables rules, which I do on a 
regular basis. Here's the deal: a 3-port router with:

WAN - 22.33.44.55
LAN - 192.168.1.0/24
DMZ - 192.168.2.0/24

I want tight controls on traffic between the LAN and DMZ. So I need two 
FORWARD rules, then INPUT rules for specific services, correct? Like this 
example for a Web server in the DMZ. What I want to do is allow LAN clients to 
access the HTTP server in the DMZ, and nothing else:

$ipt -A FORWARD -i $LAN_IFACE -o $DMZ_IFACE -m state --state 
NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

$ipt -A FORWARD -i $DMZ_IFACE -o $LAN_IFACE -m state --state 
ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

$ipt -A INPUT -p tcp -i $DMZ_IFACE -s 192.168.1.0/24 --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

Or am I making a big hash of things?

This allows any type of traffic. You want to allow ssh, telnet, ftp, ... to
the Web server?

Yes, that fits your verbal description.

So you can get at the web server from the firewall?

Frank,

   If not locally, there's a place in Reno that sells them. I forget the name
off-hand, but will look it up for you if you wish.

Rich,
I probably don't need the Reno place as the adapter is pretty much
everywhere on the "internets" if I decide to go that way.  Thanks for the
offer though.  I would like to get one locally so I can test it first.

I guess I don't see the point of doing this -- driving down to Fry's, 
buying a machine about which you have no clue on Linux compatibility, 
attempting to bring Linux up on it, failing, and bringing it back. 
What's in it for you, when you can go out on the web and probably find 
something for sale that works at least better than what you got? I'm 
really curious -- I can't imagine myself doing that. There are plenty of 
other things that work almost 100 percent but need a little tweaking, 
and I'm in the mood for some serious driver/hardware hacking, there's 
Gumstix or other inexpensive toys.

I'd recommend checking out freegeek's thrift shop.  I picked up a
spare thinkpad ac adapter there for reasonable.

Surplus Gizmos in North Plains may have one.  Mike has a few laptop
adapters for random machines, and they are sorted and organized.

Free Geek probably has one, but it will be close to impossible to find
one in the chaos.

Ebay is where I get my spare adapters.  I always have spares scattered
around, they take a fraction of a watt and it is easier to leave them
plugged in then climb furniture to get at them.  It is also a good place
to research which adapters work, since the sellers usually list the
machines that a particular adapter works with.

Not Linux, but some of us are working with cross-platform apps.

Apparently, Vista will not run apps compiled with GCC which use more
than 32MB of data.  Yikes!

Keith,

   From the little I've read, it may be that your version of Vista has been
deliberately throttled. But, you can probably buy an upgrade that will allow
your hardware to work at its full capacity.

On this note, I bought a HP DV6253 (Costco special in February) and ran
into similar problems installing OpenSuSE (10.2 and 10.3 Alpha), Debian
(both Sarge and Etch) and Ubuntu (6.10 and 7.04 Beta).

My problems included: No Wireless, Reading SD cards from the SD slot was
touchy depending on the distro, Screen Resolution (it's a 15.4
Widescreen), and a few others.  The wireless may be traced to the fact
that I have 2Gb of RAM and I saw a post about the wireless chipset (I'm at
work so I don't have the info in front of me) with more than 1Gb RAM (and
possibly 64 bit AMDs) on the kernel list.

It looks like, in general, HP is using drivers and chipsets that aren't
fully supported.  (We had similar problems with a brand new HP at work,
which was also a 64-bit AMD, that I spent some time troubleshooting.)

Oh, and don't go to HP for support!  I've spent almost 4 hours dealing
with HP to fix a "simple" problem with a bad haddrive (on another warranty
system).  All I wanted was a replacement after I gave them the error
message.  Instead the marked the problem as closed/resolved.  <sigh> 
Finally got support through email, since the VOIP to India sucked (not to
mention both the language barrier and my hearing problem) and no one
responded through their "vaunted" web support.</rant>

Anyway, I'm off-topic (and probably modded down as a troll), but it looks
like the efforts by HP (and some other unnamed vendors) to roll out new
technology / latest versions is impacting the FOSS community.

In the meantime, I'm going to patiently wait for fixes to some of the FOSS
software (kernel and a few other things) before I rebuild my new laptop
again.

I am disappointed that HP and Intel want to hide stuff and lack the shutzpah
to release a direct open source competitor to Microsoft's .NET framework.

This mono project sounds interesting, except for the closed libraries part.

Microsoft's the GPL is bad rhetoric because, "you can't have trade secrets,"
seems to miss a major strength of the license.  Secrecy means that the
potential customer can't have the software effectively evaluated by
a third party.  Well written source code is probably easier to study than
machine code any day.

What does .NET have over the alternatives anyways?  Is it true that 1 job
offer in Portland will ask for Linux and another 9 or so will request .NET?
It came up on a discussion list from a student defending the Microsoft
centricity of a course I'm taking online.  Maybe I'll be dropping this
architecture course.

What is the feasibility of truly open frameworks that mimic the functionality
of .NET becoming available?

Subject: [PLUG] PDF file, xpdf, and acroread
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0704050908030.26201@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   This is a new one on me: a pdf file created under Windows that is vieable
with xpdf except for the last page. Every time I try to view the final page,
it seg faults and shuts down the application. However, there's no problem
with the final page when viewed with acroread.

   Has anyone seen this behavior before? I find it very puzzling.

Hey, now.  They *do* have 'em all in one box.  And when you pick one
out, all the rest come with it in the tangle of wires.

FreeGeek thrift store, open 11-7 Tue-Sat, on SE 10th, 3 blocks south of

I've been looking for a year for a desktop machine that meets all my
criteria: small and quiet; 64-bit; supports virualization; dual core.
Looking a lot.  I haven't found any vendor, or retailer, that can tell
me if their system supports Linux.  I can't find blogs or newsgroups
where anybody discusses having tried running Linux on any of these
systems.  I can't even find that information on motherboards I want to
buy, from high-end retailers.  They don't actually stock any of this
stuff, and so they don't know any more about it (Linux support, or
even if the bios enables VMX) than I can get from the manu's website.

So the only thing to do is research as best I can, then for the
remaining systems try to find a retailer that will let me return it if
it doesn't work.  At Fry's, BTW, you ask them if it runs Linux and
they just tell you to bring it back if it doesn't.  Their return
policy substitutes for sales people having a clue.

If you know of a very small, quiet, 64-bit, dual-core system that
works "almost 100 percent" with Linux and doesn't disable the VMX bit,
please let me know where to order it and I will.

(I think Dell's smallest "Optiplex 745" fills the bill, but it's $400
more than the HP, so the HP was worth a try.)

Oh, and to another reponse about HP using unsupported parts: I think
that may apply less to their business-grade machines.  With those they
seem aware that Linux support is a good thing.

Dunno about all your requirements, but I bought one of these several
months ago

http://www.linuxtechtoys.com/ltt/product_info.php/cPath/24_27/products_id/237

To use as a mythtv box and it's been great, replaced red hat with
debian, and it's very, very quiet and does 64bit.  There are processor
upgrades available, but as to dual core or VMX, idunno....  Did I
mention it's quite.....

The Mono class libraries are licensed under the MIT X11 license.  That
is open source. The compiler is GPL.  The runtime libraries are LGPL.
The class libraries used to be LGPL before they were relicensed.  The
reasoning what that there is some question how "derived works" is
defined for object-oriented dynamic languages.  They want to allow
people to write closed-source applications in Mono which link
dynamically with the class libraries.

The MIT X11 license does allow people to not release their
modifications but that doesn't seem to be a major danger with a
project where the rest of the code is under the GPL or LGPL.  And
where there is a strong open developer community which will keep the
open-source version moving faster than any proprietary fork.  Other
BSD licensed projects, like BSD, PostgreSQL, or X11 have had
proprietary forks which have been outdone by the open-source version.

Quite what? :)

Wow, those look pretty nice.  Maybe if I can get my @#%#$ remote to work
and get the system accepted into the household, this would be a good
upgrade from the Frankenstein's monster I've got not.  What does
your /proc/cpuinfo say?  Does it have 'vt'?

Why get your @#%#$ remote to work with it?  It comes with a remote of its own that
has mouse functionality.   Scroll down the page.

I'm using a slightly older (but cooler looking, IHMO) version of this:
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16811204014

... with a P4 for mythtv. There's a few really nice cases like this, if
you'd rather use existing hardware. Now if I can just hurry up and move,
so I can have comcast instead of directv, life would be so much better.

MythTV simply rocks, save the extreme crappiness of lirc. Gawd. I'm very
tempted to just buy a new remote (people report that certain lirc
modules work fine with 2.6.20).

FWIW, Dell has mailing lists for Linux users:
http://lists.us.dell.com/mailman/listinfo

They also seem to understand the need for hardware to have drivers in
the mainline kernel:

I've heard it's fine in FC6/RHEL5. I guess if you're not willing to
pay for what you want, you better want what you're willing to pay for.

speaking about that, there are several USB-driven remote receivers (Philips, 
ATI) that have in-kernel drivers and act as input devices. Has anyone actually 
found these and (if so) do they get rid of the lirc cruft?

(yes, I've never been able to get lirc working decently with *any* remote, and 
I'm dying for a non-lirc method where the IR is just a native input device)

Auke

PS, 599 seems awfully expensive, especially since you're paying for the gfx card 
(sure it's a good one but do you need that for the video display???). I've been 
looking at ich8 onboard's gfx card (oss drivers!) and they're extremely decent 
for video playback. And you can get a core 2 system up for about the same 
money... if you decide to plug in a celeron you can shave 150$ off of the price 
and it would still perform great for mythtv's purposes.

who needs vtx in a tivo anyway?!

... because the latter part of the sentence is incumbent on it: "... and
get the system accepted into the household ..."  Right now it's just a
giant mess of cables and boxes and parts spread about over the living
room; I don't intend to spend any more on upgrades or replacements until
I'm sure it's really worth the trouble.

Err, humph...

Uh yeah, quiet, it's quiet! I was in the same boat as you with a older
not so nice system.  It had a hauppauge card that I got the remote
working fine.  I moved it into the garage and connected it up to cable
and now it works as a seamless secondary server.  This HTPC box comes
with a working serial IR port built into the front.  I set it up to work
with the hauppauge remote that I already had working and it's worked
ever sense.

I have a Sejin IR keyboard that I'd really like to get working with the
IR port, but I'm not patient enough to go through and map every key and
combination key stroke that would be necessary.

Well you can also do that easily on a Pentium 4 piece-o-crap. Especially
if you have a hardware MPEG encoder (PVR-150, etc) and Xv/XvMC
extensions enabled in xorg for your MPEG-2 hardware decoding video card.
In fact, that'd work on a PIII.

"....Executable images created for the DOS/Wintel environment, using

How useful is a windows-hosted program that doesn't link to the Win32
API? (This is a serious question... I've only done windows programming
with VM languages like java and c#, so I really don't know.)  It seems
like some aspect of the Win32 API would be needed for just about any
I/O.

I made the trip to FreeGeek and sure enough, in the bottom of the box I
found not one, but three adapters meeting my specs.  After about 1/2 hour
untangling the wires I gave FG $20, came home and the laptop is now up and
running.  FreeGeek to the rescue again!

We are just getting started using this but it is typically a system
hardware support
option.  There is a BMC which can be included on the board or may be part of the
card cage that the boards plug into.

If the hardware you already have doesn't support it then it is not
worth the effort unless
you are planning major upgrades.

This is mainly for racks of headless systems.  We have an six slot
ATCA chassis that
has two shelf managers which support IPMI 1.5 with some form of serial
re-direct but
does not support Serial over LAN.

Here is a link I googled a few minutes ago.

The machines in question, mostly from Penguin Computing, have BMCs 
with their own (unswitched) connections to the power supplies and 
ethernet jacks.

Right. The docs I've been able to find online seem to warn against 
using the (mostly busted) serial support in IPMI 1.5. Supposedly, 
things are better in 2.0, but HOWTOs are in short supply.

> Here is a link I googled a few minutes ago.

That was one of the first documents I read. It's pretty specific to a 
certain chipset.

I've installed the OpenIPMI stuff and have been able to poll the 
hardware monitors with ipmitool, e.g.,

   [root]# ipmitool sdr type Temperature
   CPU 1 TEMP       | 22h | ok  |  3.0 | 48 degrees C
   CPU 2 TEMP       | 23h | ok  |  3.1 | 49 degrees C
   MEM TEMP         | 24h | ok  |  7.0 | 27 degrees C
   PWR CONN TEMP    | 25h | ok  |  7.0 | 33 degrees C

I've even been able to locate the proper LAN channels on the machines 
in question (oddly, one does lan on channel 6, while others on are 
channel 2).

I'm more interested in how folks use IPMI as a console interface for 
rebooting, altering BIOS settings, and getting to the boot loader.

Have you tried using the kernel event interface instead of the default?
I ran lircd with '-H dev/input -d /dev/input/eventX' and was able to run
'irw' without making lircd die a painful death, and made a test config
with a few keys with 'irrecord'.  (Well, actually, 'irw' doesn't
actually record anything when lircd is run this way, but 'irrecord'
does.)

The funny thing, though, is that when I run lircd w/o options or without
it running, the arrows, "ok" and number pad works, but none of the
others do.  My vague understanding is that it's using the (new-ish)
kernel input interface (which is what /dev/input/* stuff is), so the
remote acts like a keyboard, but a bunch of keys that aren't actually
mapped.  I can actually run xev and--even stranger--*most* of the keys
generate X events.

Wow, I didn't realize that lirc was such a pain, I mapped the keys into
the /etc/lirc/lircd.conf file, and then set them up in the lircrc file
and it's been great so far, I've remapped some keys for what I want,
pip, etc.

It took a while to figure out how to access the slideshow feature in
mythgallery but that works now.  Once I mapped all the mplayer keys for
video playback it's been great!

What type of remote, lirc and kernel versions do you have?

Hm... I'm using the one that shipped with my Hauppauge WinTV 401 (it's
an NTSC framegrabber and radio tuner); I wonder if this isn't the
solution to my problem:

I'm using the

# model no. of remote control: Hauppauge A415-HPG
# devices being controlled by this remote: PVR-350

But I'm using it now with a saa7134 video card.  As it's all serial to
it, it doesn't matter.....

I'm using the default lircd.conf file that comes with lirc for this
remote, I think I've tweaked a couple of button names.

ChangeLog: Linux Fund loses its funding source


Thursday April 05, 2007 (01:54 PM GMT)

By: Linux.com staff

Linux Fund <http://www.linuxfund.org/> , an organization founded to fund
open source projects through financing from affinity credit cards, is losing
its affinity card provider. Linux Fund cardholders received official notice
from the Bank of America recently that the program is being discontinued.
According to the letter, "the provider of your Linux Fund credit card and
Linux Fund recently agreed to discontinue the existing credit card program
effective June 30, 2007." 

David Mandel, executive director of LinuxFund.org, says, "Linux Fund and
Bank of America (formerly MBNA) agreed to terminate the Linux Fund card a
few months ago, but we could not say anything because of non-disclosure
agreements we signed with MBNA.

"Many people have asked if Linux Fund is going to offer a card through
another bank or if I know of an alternative to the Linux Fund credit card
that funds FOSS. I cannot say anything about Linux Fund's future with any
other bank; and I do not know of any alternative to the Linux Fund credit
card. I suspect there aren't any. I can say that the banking industry has
changed and it is much more difficult to set up a program like the Linux
Fund card than it was in 1999 when we started the program."

LinuxFund was born in 1999 and hyped at the 2000 LinuxWorld in New York
City. After falling into a period of disarray and neglect, it was
revitalized <http://business.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/07/22/1553240>
in 2005, and channeled funds into important FOSS projects such as Blender,
Debian Linux, Gentoo, and OpenSSH <http://www.linuxfund.org/1/projects.php>
.

"Linux Fund will continue to exist, although it will look very different
than it does today," Mandel says. "Linux Fund is hoping to be able to
provide the open source community with the information and tools they need
to intelligently channel funds and other resources to open source projects."

Thanks for the update William.  I was getting ready to ask on this since 
I got my "letter" last week.  Looks like I'll be switching my credit 
card provider.  I wonder how much business they were getting because 
people like me would use it knowing we were helping a little.  Not a big 
fan of Bank of America and now I have no reason to keep using the card.

Rod,

   Bank of America had a small credit card business. They bought MBNA because
that company was the largest credit card issuer in the country. I read how
many different brands of VISA and MasterCard they issued, but forget the
number. It was very large.

   BoA is one of the huge corporations that will cut all small pieces that
appear to cost more to maintain then they produce in revenues. What a group
like Linux Fund needs is a small bank -- local or regional -- that can see
the benefits of sponsoring such a branded card.

In fact, a corporation like BofA will cut a piece of business that is 
certainly producing more revenue than it costs to maintain if that piece 
of business does not have a high enough profit margin.  Moreover, the 
corporation would be doing its shareholders a disservice if it failed to 
cut those pieces of business (and potentially opens itself up to lawsuits 
from its own shareholders for such failures).  The system rewards high 
profit MARGINS, not high profits.  A business that's making plenty of 
money can still be seen as worthless to the stock market if it does so on 
low margins, no matter how consistently.

People who play games are way smarter than people who make games (because 
there are so many MORE of them).  The rules might be set up with the 
intention of promoting a certain type of behavior, but people will find 
what behavior is actually rewarded and act that way.

Subject: [PLUG] Upgrading a video driver
Message-ID: <461A8A01.8060500@comcast.net>

What do I need to save when I upgrade a video driver so that if the
upgrade is worse than the original I can revert to the original?

I recall trying to upgrade my video driver at one point some months ago,
only to find that the upgrade didn't work very well. I don't remember
how I finally got back to the old driver, but I figure there must be a
"correct" way to approach the process so I can easily undo it, if it
turns out not to work.

My installation is SuSE 10.1, and my video card is nVidia GeForce2 MX/MX
400. I've found SuSE specific instructions at the nVidia site, and will
continue to follow those, but it isn't immediately clear which version
to use. That reinforces my desire to know what I did months ago so I can
always revert to the driver I'm using now.

You are going to have problems with the current 97xx drivers.  (It will 
probably error out and claim that chipset is no longer supported.)  Look 
in nvidia's software archive for the last of the 96xx series driver for 
your architecture.

My router is dying. It's a Linksys 10/100 without a firewall. For a
replacement I'd like gigabit and a firewall. I just got back from Fry's
where I bought a Linksys RVS400 for $129 that turned out to be DOA.
Since my dying router is also Linksys I am currently not impressed with
Linksys quality. Any other suggestions? Or might I get a 10/100 cheap at
Free Geek to tide me over for a while? Would Free Geek have such a
thing?

FG would have such a thing.  Boxes thereof, in fact, waiting to be
tested.  The ones without Wi-Fi aren't valued much, really.

I found support from Linksys to be problematic. They are tied to a 
windows based script, and insist on using the GUI.
After three iterations, of warranty based support calls, I bought a 
Belkin. Not necessarily cheap, but been happier ever since.

I've  had both Linksys and Belkin's at points in time and I prefer the
Belkin as well. I'm running a Linksys right now running customer firmware
from here http://www.sveasoft.com/ and its worked out pretty well.

A WRT54GL with the wireless turned off and reloaded with openwrt or
DD-WRT would work well.  I have a WRT54G(v5) w/ the micro version of
DD-WRT and it works well.  No
problems, even with the wireless.

I also have had good experince with Netgear as routers but not
wireless AP's.  The Netgears have been solid for me (2.5 years of no
re-boots except when the
DSL itself went out and I had to troubleshoot it).

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3869753.stm
 Sunspots reaching 1,000-year high
By Dr David Whitehouse
BBC News Online science editor

A new analysis shows that the Sun is more active now than it has been at
anytime in the previous 1,000 years.

Scientists based at the Institute for Astronomy in Zurich used ice cores
from Greenland to construct a picture of our star's activity in the past.

They say that over the last century the number of sunspots rose at the same
time that the Earth's climate became steadily warmer.

This trend is being amplified by gases from fossil fuel burning, they argue.

'Little Ice Age'

Sunspots have been monitored on the Sun since 1610, shortly after the
invention of the telescope. They provide the longest-running direct
measurement of our star's activity.

The variation in sunspot numbers has revealed the Sun's 11-year cycle of
activity as well as other, longer-term changes.

In particular, it has been noted that between about 1645 and 1715, few
sunspots were seen on the Sun's surface.

This period is called the Maunder Minimum after the English astronomer who
studied it.

It coincided with a spell of prolonged cold weather often referred to as the
"Little Ice Age". Solar scientists strongly suspect there is a link between
the two events - but the exact mechanism remains elusive.

Over the past few thousand years there is evidence of earlier Maunder-like
coolings in the Earth's climate - indicated by tree-ring measurements that
show slow growth due to prolonged cold.

In an attempt to determine what happened to sunspots during these other cold
periods, Dr Sami Solanki and colleagues have looked at concentrations of a
form, or isotope, of beryllium in ice cores from Greenland.

The isotope is created by cosmic rays - high-energy particles from the
depths of the galaxy.

The flux of cosmic rays reaching the Earth's surface is modulated by the
strength of the solar wind, the charged particles that stream away from the
Sun's surface.

And since the strength of the solar wind varies over the sunspot cycle, the
amount of beryllium in the ice at a time in the past can therefore be used
to infer the state of the Sun and, roughly, the number of sunspots.

Latest warming

Dr Solanki is presenting a paper on the reconstruction of past solar
activity at Cool Stars, Stellar Systems And The Sun, a conference in
Hamburg, Germany.

He says that the reconstruction shows the Maunder Minimum and the other
minima that are known in the past thousand years.

But the most striking feature, he says, is that looking at the past 1,150
years the Sun has never been as active as it has been during the past 60
years.

Over the past few hundred years, there has been a steady increase in the
numbers of sunspots, a trend that has accelerated in the past century, just
at the time when the Earth has been getting warmer.

The data suggests that changing solar activity is influencing in some way
the global climate causing the world to get warmer.

Over the past 20 years, however, the number of sunspots has remained roughly
constant, yet the average temperature of the Earth has continued to
increase.

This is put down to a human-produced greenhouse effect caused by the
combustion of fossil fuels.

This latest analysis shows that the Sun has had a considerable indirect
influence on the global climate in the past, causing the Earth to warm or
chill, and that mankind is amplifying the Sun's latest attempt to warm the
Earth.

Here is a set of procmail recipes I've developed:

------------------------------------------------

I'm trying to use procmail to set up a filter that will only
accept email to a specific alias that has a specific subject
from specific sources.  How do my recipes look so far?

I want to require that the body contain a single string that is
a fully qualified domain name, but I don't think procmail can
check that for me.

I'm trying to experiment with sending messages between servers
via email that ultimately should be acted on in an automated
way.  I'm looking at use of my local email system as a possible
alternative to using EasyTCP for specialized intraserver
communication.  The smtp protocol is well defined, it's capable
of retrying if the first attempt to send a message fails,
etcetera.

One application I'm considering is special email addresses
on a backup email server that it only accept messages to from the
primary email server.  The primary and backup server could synchronise:
grey lists, white lists, etcetera through this special, not available
to the public, email address.  Another thought of mine is simply
keeping track of whether or not my partner smtp server is alive
so that I can soft reject messages for it when it is still up
and running.

Out of curiosity, is there any way to comment procmail files?

In general these days, is the standard across the Net to interpret
multiple MX records as a load balancing mechanism instead of as a
linear list by weight of servers to try in a specific order?

Thanks for the warning. I downloaded NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-9631-pkg1.run,
which appears to be that latest 96xx version.

I went out on the openSuSE forum and found detailed instructions for
installing the driver on a SuSE system. It worked as advertised.

What started all this was trying to install and run Google Earth. They
now have a Linux version. I got a bunch of error messages when I tried
to run it. Their help site said it was probably related to the video
driver. Naturally, the first thing I tried after installing the new
driver was Google Earth. It works great, and looks better on this system
than the version I run on my XP laptop.

It took the better part of today, but I am back online. 

The first thing I did was go to Free Geek to get a new plain 10/100
router. Unfortunately, I arrove too early and they weren't open yet, so
I killed some time going to City Liqudators and a couple other places
checking out storage cabinets for the clinic. (Disappointing results.)
Finally at Free Geek I bought a D-Link and a Linksys for $15 each.

When I got them home I couldn't get either one to work. I spent at
least an hour poking at them with every trick I knew of, but no way
could I get on the internet. When my frustration level got too high I
packed them up and took them back to Free Geek, along with my laptop. A
kind soul from the back room got the configuration page up on each one
in Firefox, and also showed me how to use a paper clip to reset them to
factory defaults, in case I got the router so goobered up that it
wouldn't even respond to a ping. Another gentleman was watching and
added the suggestion that Comcast likes to block routers by locking a
router's MAC address into the modem so the modem won't let traffic
through from any other device. (This sounded a bit phony to me, but
what do I know?)

So back at home I tried the Linksys first. While it worked at Free
Geek, back at home I couldn't even get the configuration page up on the
browser. Eventually I hooked my Ubuntu laptop directly to the cable
modem so I could at least get on the net, then went to linksys.com and
found a tech support number. The call to tech support was taken by a
young lady whose English pronunciation was terrible. Add that the phone
connection was spitting static on every word, and I ended up having to
ask her to repeat every sentence, sometimes two or three times. Finally
she insisted that she could not help unless I was running Windows, so I
booted my Windows 2000 desktop. She asked me to type ipconfig at a
command line, which gave an ip address of 169.something. It was an
address I had never seen before. I tried to get her to explain what it
meant, but the communication problem made it impossible for me to
understand her. After a few more minutes she asked for the serial
number of the router. When I gave it to her she said it was "past its
expired of warranty out," but that she could give me a number for their
Premium Support Service, which would cost me only $29.50 for the first
five minutes and $5 a minute thereafter. I hung up on her. Anyone need
a Linksys router?

At that point I plugged in the D-Link. Again, no matter what I did, I
could not get on the net. Finally I called Comcast to see if the second
gentleman's opinion was correct. A helpful fellow (native English
speaker with a good phone connection!) spent 15 minutes with me, but
couldn't get it working. He did say that the only MAC address Comcast
looks at is the modem's MAC address and that, unless I changed the
modem, there should be no problem. Just in case, I got him to give me
the MAC address of my modem, which I now have taped to the side of its
plastic housing.

After hanging up with him I shut down the Windows 2000 desktop, took
the cables for the three computers off the separate 8-port switch where
they normally live and put them directly on the router, then went to my
Ubuntu laptop. On the laptop I was finally able to get the
configuration page up in Firefox for the D-Link, although I still
couldn't go anywhere on the internet. I poked and poked and then,
suddenly, it worked!! Unfortunately, I have no idea why it suddenly
decided to work. That is bad, because I like to document which specific
poke fixed something for next time I break it. 

Now I need to put the cables back on the 8-port switch because the
router has only four ports + modem, and I have three computers and four
laser printers. But I'll tackle that later. For now I'm just happy to
have a router that works.

PLUG Advanced Topics Meeting 
April 16th 2007 at 7pm

Location:

Jax Bar and Grill
826 SW 2nd Avenue 
Portland, Oregon

Speaker:  Josh Triplett <josh at freedesktop.org>

At the April 16th Advanced Topics meeting, Josh will discuss Sparse,
static analysis, and its application to synchronization techniques, with
an emphasis on Read-Copy Update (RCU).  I will also give a brief history
of how I ended up maintaining Sparse.

About Josh Triplett:

I study at Portland State University, in the second year of the CS PhD
program.  My research relates to advanced synchronization techniques
based on "relativistic programming", which avoids the expensive illusion
of an absolute view of memory across multiple processors.  I hack on
various Free and Open Source projects for fun, study, and profit.  I
participate in the Debian project, in freedesktop.org, in the Linux
kernel community, and in the Portland State Aerospace Society.  As of
2006, I maintain the Sparse static analysis tool for C, originally
written by Linus Torvalds.

Usual meeting rules apply.  Happy Hour menu for the first hour for food.

If Comcast is anything like Verizon, DHCP will only assign one address
per port.  The only
way to get things to allow something else to start up is either do a
DHCP release from
the equipment with the MAC address that was issued the IP address or
wait until 2X the
DHCP lease time before trying to connect something else.  Had the same
issue with
Verizon when I was upgrading my router.  After the third tech call
about the same problem
I ended up with either a second or third level support person or
someone at first level that
really should be at second or third level that told me how the system worked.
Since my router didn't have the release function, I left it off for an
hour and then
everything connected up.

So the guy at FG was probably right about Comcast.

Fedora works fine.  I have had little or no problems with it.

I am currently using the Geforce FX5500. However, when I experienced it on SuSE 10.0, I was using the Radeon 9250. (Perhaps I should check the error messages when X fails to launch as a non-root user; it refers to xorg.conf. This never happens as root.)

Debian 4.0 was released today.

There is a log file for X in /var/log/.  Take a look and see what is 
erroring out.

I use the commercial NVIDIA driver.  It sounds like a device permissions 
problem though.

Are you using AppArmor?

Subject: [PLUG] DNS mystery...
Message-ID: <20070410180943.9esoa0bg0swk4kko@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

The mail server for sophistasis.com is supposed to be the backup exchanger
for robinson-west.com.  Apparently, my brother got a message meant for me
and should have been able to check my name server for my server's address,
but he got the ip for sophistasis instead.

Okay, what happened I wonder???


   /-------------\                  /--------\
   | sophistasis |-----Internet-----| xerxes |
   \-------------/                  \--------/

* Did a spammer send the message and simultaneously manage to
poison the DNS server on web?

* Is a renegade gateway responsible, possibly inside Opus?

* Is there a weakness in the iBook my brother isn't aware
of which allows a remote site to change dns response
packets?

I've noticed that I can't get register.com to accept ns1.sophistasis.com
as a valid name server for robinson-west.com.  I don't know why that
is.  I remember a dns test suggested that Opus is running a vulnerable
release of bind where I am using Opus's servers as a tertiary option.
Oddly and irritatingly, the register.com domain tools show the Opus
server as the first server in my DNS list.

Most routers or modems don't work immediately after plugging them in.  I
have noticed delays of 10-15 minutes sometimes.  I think it relates to
how often the wan responds or polls the routers.

I have also noticed that I often have to restart my networking after
connecting to a router, so it will request and receive an address from
the router, before I can connect to the configuration page.

The mystery with the Linksys was solved. Once I had the Belkin up and 
running, I tossed it into a closet and forgot about it for awhile. 
Later, my son-in-law started working for Comcast, and I gave it to him. 
My problem was that the wireless would work, but the gateway failed to 
connect us to the internet. Linksys support sent me two replacements and 
couldn't get them to work. Alex, opened up a command prompt, instead of 
using the GUI.
With an ipconfig /release; ipconfig /renew - all was working normally. 
Of course, I wondered why I hadn't thought of that myself. But then, 
neither did advanced tech support at Linksys. There was no need to clone 
a MAC address either.

Message-ID: <461D51C3.2000104@comcast.net>

The original question was, how do I get a shell script to execute when I
click on it in the Konqueror file browser. It turns out that it does
execute, but it assumes you want it to refer to files and directories
that are in your home directory, not the directory in which the script
is located.

I joined the KDE forum and got a lead on the answer. It is a bit of a
kludge, but here's how to create a click-able entry in a directory that
will execute a shell script in that directory on files in that directory:

Create a shell script, such as MyShellScript.
In Konqueror, create a link to the shell script:
    Right click on the empty space in the Konqueror folder contents
    pane and select Create New > Link to Application...
    Give the link an appropriate name such as "Link to MyShellScript"
    At the Application tab of the Link Properties window find the line
      labeled Command:, click "Browse" and, once you've browsed to it,
      select MyShellScript.
    At the line labeled Work Path: click on the "Open file dialog" icon,
      make sure the dialog has the correct directory highlighted, and
      click OK.
    Finally, click OK on the Link Properties window.

As an additional feature, if you are having trouble debugging your shell
script, you can click on Advanced Options on the Link Properties window,
check the boxes, "Run in terminal" and "Do not close when command exits".

It's possible to solve this in the script by having the script
determine it's own location and then cd'ing to it.

  #!/bin/sh
  self=`which $0`
  mydir=${self%/*}
  cd $mydir

That'll only work if which finds $0 in the current $PATH, right? How 
about this instead:

   cd $(dirname $0)

No, 'which' still figures it out, even if $0 contains a full or
relative path.

But dirname works too.

Subject: [PLUG] Linux Clinic this Sunday
Message-ID: <20070412192621.GL1010@syrinxpc.com>

Well, it's been an exciting few weeks since the last Linux Clinic.

Debian 4.0 was released.
Ubuntu 7.04 went Beta, and the Release Candidate should be out today.
Fedora 7 Test3 is out.

If you want help installing or configuring these new shiny! distros,
bring a computer to the Linux Clinic.  We'll have CDs and DVDs handy.

It's this Sunday, April 15, from 1PM to 5PM, at Free Geek.
They're at 1731 SE 10th Ave, 2 blocks south of Hawthorne.

There's bus info and links to maps at: http://www.freegeek.org/map.php

Come on by, look for the signs, walk right in the South door, have some
coffee and cookies if you like.

NOTE: Free Geek will be closed that day.  We will have some spare parts
on hand, but if you want to buy hardware to try Linux with, come by the
store today, Friday or Saturday.

Think globally and act neighborly,
  Aaron

Glad that worked.  I ran into the problem on my laptop.  One day I tried the
new version and it claimed that my chipset was no longer supported.  Nothing
in the README about it either.

I'm downloading (via torrents) the CentOS 5.0 and the Debian Etch DVDs
right now (one CentOS DVD from cat.pdx.edu and three Debian DVDs from
some Debian mirror). But I'm only interested in amd64 versions, so
that's all I'm downloading for now.

The Ubuntu Feisty release candidate is not yet listed on the website:

http://www.ubuntu.com/testing

I already have the beta, amd64 live/install CD. I'll keep watching the
website for the release candidate.

If someone who has a slow connection wants a 32-bit version of
something, let me know and I'll add it to Ktorrent. I also have several
other CDs and DVDs -- OpenSUSE 10.2 (32- and 64-bit DVDs),
Mandriva-free-2007, SimplyMepis 6.5 rc2, Gentoo 2006.1, and various
Fedora ones including Fedora 7 test2 (if you install the automatic
updates it becomes test3).

Good, because I'm getting the i386 versions.

And in the process spend more time writing the script that said nerd
would have spent "hitting reload every once in a while".

Since this thread is in danger of being hijacked by frivolous Perl,
and since I haven't been to a Clinic for a while (new house), I'll
mention I plan to be there with my new toy, running FC6 under
Parallels, so if anyone feels like informal chat about virtualization
stop on by.  I may also take the opportunity to install one or two
other distros under Parallels, leading to the inevitable configuration
of networking, resource distribution, file sharing, etc. under a
virtualized environment.

Subject: [PLUG] Routers again <sigh>
Message-ID: <20070412182409.93927b2c.johnxj@comcast.net>

To recap old history, my Linksys router died. I replaced it with a
D-Link from Free Geek. The Linksys had five ports on the back, one
labeled Modem, and the others numbered 1-4. The new D-Link is the same,
except that the one marked Modem on the Linksys is marked WAN on the
D-Link. The cable modem is in the WAN port on the new D-Link. There is
also a cable going from 1 on the router to a separate 8-port switch.
Cables from the switch go to my three computers and two laser
printers. This is also how my Linksys was cabled, and everything always
worked.

Now, with the new D-Link all three computers can go to the internet
without a problem. But none of the computers can talk to either laser
printer. 

The laser printers are 192.168.1.4 and 192.168.1.24. When I turn each
one on the corresponding light on the front of the switch lights up. So
the wiring is still connected.

If I try to print to either one the print job just sits in the queue in
CUPS. Ditto for trying to print a test page. If I ping the printers
from the Edgy laptop I get:

jjj at Devil5:~$ ping 192.168.1.4
PING 192.168.1.4 (192.168.1.4) 56(84) bytes of data.
>From 192.168.1.3 icmp_seq=2 Destination Host Unreachable

>From the Fedora 7 test2 desktop I get

[jjj at localhost -]$ ping 192.168.1.4
PING 192.168.1.4 (192.168.1.4) 56(84) bytes of data.
	and then the ping command just hangs

While testing I have Firestarter on the laptop and the firewall and
SELinux on the Fedora desktop all disabled.

My first question is, what does this line mean?

>From 192.168.1.3 icmp_seq=2 Destination Host Unreachable

And consider that 192.168.1.3 is the Windows 2000 desktop. It is turned
off, as it usually is. However, with the cable connecting its ethernet
card to the switch plugged in, the light on the switch is on. How can
that be if the computer is turned off? And I can ping the Windows
deslktop  from the Ubuntu laptop and get a response, even if the
Windows desktop is turned off, but from the Fedora 7 desktop the ping
just hangs.

Summary: The D-Link is wired exactly the same as the old Linksys was
wired. With the Linksys any computer could print to either printer
whether it was the only computer turned on or if all the computers were
running. Now nothing can talk to the printers. The only thing that is
different in the mix is the D-Link router. Therefore, that is where the
problem must lie. But what could it be?

The computer with the nic connection on when the computer is off has remote
power on enabled in the BIOS to allow remote admin update.  This is a
feature that
most motherboards have now.

Were the printers configured for DHCP?  The new router might have
re-assigned them.
Have you checked the router page for known hosts/MACs?
Can you ping the other computers?
Have you tried
ping -b 192.168.1.0 from one of your Linux boxes?

That means that that host IP is unreachable from the current subnet that the
computer is connected to. If you run /sbin/ifconfig on either the fedora or
edgy laptop what do you get back for an IP?

This is what I got:

root at Devil5:/home/jjj# ping -b 192.168.1.4
PING 192.168.1.4 (192.168.1.4) 56(84) bytes of data.
ping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted
ping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted

However, then I disabled Firestarter, which gave me:

root at Devil5:/home/jjj# ping -b 192.168.1.4
PING 192.168.1.4 (192.168.1.4) 56(84) bytes of data.
>From 192.168.1.3 icmp_seq=2 Destination Host Unreachable

Note that I did sudo su to become a real root first. But also note the
results of the command after disabling Firestarter on the laptop. What
I don't understand is why it says "from 192.168.1.3 ..."  That is the
Windows 2000 desktop, which is turned off except for the echo I am
getting from its network card.

After the above I decided to take the laptop over to the Laserjet and
use a patch cord to connect it directly to the printer. Again, print
jobs just stalled and went nowhere; the lights on the printer did not
start blinking. When I pinged it I got the same "operation not
permitted." Thus it is now clear that the router has nothing to do with
it. Something on this laptop is causing the problem.

So then I decided to try the new Fedora 7 test2 desktop computer. I
tried using it to ping 192.168.1.4 and the ping command just hung,
instead of giving me the "operation not permitted" error message. The
printer was turned on and connected to the network, but I had not set
up this printer yet in CUPS on the new desktop, so I went ahead and did
so. I tried everything, but I could not get it to print a test page.

I had already set up the other laser printer in the new desktop
computer, so I fiddled with it a bit, but was also unable to get a test
page out of it. Nor could I ping it -- like the first laser printer,
the ping command just hung.

However, I noticed one thing on the new desktop computer -- when I told
the GUI to print a test page for either printer a little window popped
up and said "printing test page as job 7," or some other job number.
Now, if there is a job that is hung I am not going to get any output
from the printer until I clear the hung job. Unfortunately, I poked all
over Fedora 7 and absolutely cannot find any way to bring up the CUPS
GUI where I can open a print jobs dialog box. CUPS is definitely
installed and running, but perhaps F7 test2 does not install the CUPS
GUI. If there is a command line way to find out what jobs are currently
in the queue, I don't know what it is. If there are any Fedora users
here, maybe someone can tell me where they hid the button to launch the
GUI.

And anyway, even if there are jobs hung in the queue, I should still
get a ping response.

Another fact is that I remember installing an upgrade for CUPS a few
days ago.

So far all I know for sure is that the problem cannot be in the router
because connecting the computer directly to the printer doesn't work
either. Otherwise I am stumped.

I have a homework I needed to print out for class tomorrow morning, but
I can print it out at the university computer lab before class.
Nevertheless, getting my printers working is a high priority.

The router is set to 192.168.0.1.

Omigod, I just got it. The "0" in the router address is the subnet. I
just now went into CUPS on the laptop and changed the IP connection
addresses for the printers from 19.168.1.4 and 192.168.1.24 to
192.168.0.4 and 192.168.0.24. And now they both print! Yay!

Some day I may actually understand this stuff.

Thanks!

you missed the point
ping -b 192.168.1.0
is a broadcast ping to the network.  You don't  send it to an address normally.
This should respond back with everything on the network that understands
ping. Lots of duplicates.

I see from the other messages that your new router changed the network
and so you
are up and running.

Not everything.  Some IP stacks, on Windows for example, don't respond to
broadcast pings.

Nor should they, given the DDoS amplification potential of broadcast
pings (Smurf attack).  If you need to diagnose between two devices,
use a unicast (standard) ping.  If you need to discover devices on a
subnet, use nmap or some other tool that can automate pinging through
a list of IP addresses.

Linux allows broadcast ping response to be configured through the
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts sysctl, or via the equivalent
/proc/sys/net entry.  The default is to ignore (1).

...or maybe auto-mounting confusion.

I have two distros installed, Debian Etch and Arch Linux.  Each has its
own ext3 root and home partitions (boot is managed from Etch on its own
partition).  I don't want the other OS's partitions to be mounted
automatically, so I use 'user, noauto' options in the fstab entries for
the second OS.  (In other words, my Etch fstab lists the two partitions
for Arch Linux with the options 'user, noauto' and my Arch fstab does
the same for the two Etch partitions.)

But it's not working.  The partitions are being mounted whenever I boot
into one or the other.  What am I doing wrong?

It might be default now but not too many kernel versions ago it was 0
and would respond.
However, most networking equipment and devices like networked
printers/print servers
will respond.  It is a tool. Useful in some situations.

Looks like the default was changed to disallow broadcast echos in late 2005:

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=7ce312467edc270fcbd8a699efabb37ce1802b98

It is a tool.  As I pointed out in my earlier mail, there are
alternatives that rely on the tool itself to generate unicast
echo-requests, instead of broadcasting to everyone.  For example, you
can do an nmap ping scan with the -sP option:

nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24

The advantage here, is that unlike a broadcast ping, this method
requires the requester to generate 254 individual icmp-echo-request
packets, with the expectation of getting up to 254 icmp-echo-reply
packets back.  With a broadcast ping, the requester sends 1
icmp-echo-request packet and gets up to n icmp-echo-replies, where n
is 254/65534/16777214 for a class C/B/A network respectively.  This
was the smurf technique used to bring down even the largest ISP
backbones from a single dial-up connection.

Could script it too

#generate a class C list of IP's
for i < 255; echo 192.168.x.$i; done
#export your IP list and then fping it
for i $iplist; do fping $i; done

Nothing obviously wrong.  What happens if you comment out the fstab
lines from the other distro?

Subject: [PLUG] Copying CD/DVD with two drives
Message-ID: <20070413174816.8b2b539a.johnxj@comcast.net>

My new Fedora 7 test3 amd64 desktop has two identical LG DVD+-RW dual
layer drives. I did this deliberately thinking that it would be more
efficient when copying CDs and DVDs. But I am having a terrible time.
K3b recognizes both drives, but is unwilling to copy from one and write
to the other at the same time. It insists that it must write to the
same drive that it copies from, so it must copy to the hard drive,
eject the first media, wait for a new blank disk to be inserted, then
write to the new blank disk. If this is the best Linux software can
accomplish, then the $50 spent on the second drive was wasted.

Gnomebaker is even worse. It can see only /dev/scd0. It is unaware
that /dev/scd1 exists.

I need software that can copy from one directly to the other. Does such
exist for Linux? Or is there a way to make K3b or Gnomebaker wake up
and realize that it is possible to copy a CD or DVD without first
writing it to the hard disk?

I googled for you and came up with this ..

http://www.togaware.com/linux/survivor/Direct_Copy.html

I had to remove my Linux install on my laptop so I can burn a factory CD
from the hidden partition (thanks acer!) .. so I can tell you the viability
of this method but its worth a shot just exchange the /dev/cdrom for the
second burner and maybe check out "man cdrecord" of which K3B is just a
front end.

The values in there are the public keys of the known hosts, not
hashes.  What are you trying to get out of it?

I had the HashKnownHosts option set to "yes", apparently it's an Ubuntu 
default, so the host names are a hash according to the documentation.  A 
server I talk to has changed its host key so I'd like to update the 
known hosts file but I can't tell what line it is in my known_hosts file.

When I select "Tools->Copy CD", K3b shows a dialog that contains,
among other widgets, two pull-downs labeled "CD Reader Device" and
"Burning Device". I'd test it out, but I don't have two drives.
It doesn't work as expected?

No (or at least, if implemented correctly, it shouldn't be). However,
you can use "ssh-keygen -R [hostname]" to remove a hashed host from your
known_hosts file (it keeps a backup of your known_hosts file). You can
also use "ssh-keygen -F [hostname]" to query for a given host's key.

The hashing is done to prevent the spread of worms that compromise weak
accounts and then use the known_hosts file to determine the next hosts
to attempt the weak passwords on (as the user would likely have used
the same weak password).

I tried that suggestion on my Arch Linux fstab, and the Debian
partitions were no longer mounted.  But in the course of doing that, I
also deleted an extra directory entry under /mnt -- something I had
created some time ago, didn't use anymore, and had forgotten about.  It
wasn't listed in either fstab and AFAIK wasn't being mounted in either
OS.  When I booted back into Debian, the Arch partitions were no longer
mounted, even though I had not commented them out of the Etch fstab.
Then I put the entries back into my Arch fstab and rebooted it.  The
Etch partitions were no longer mounted.  Go figure.

This all started a few days ago, after I resized the partitions on sda1,
using the gParted Live-CD.  That's all I did -- resize.  I didn't edit
the fstabs or change the mount options.  I wonder if the presence of an
unmounted, unlisted directory under /mnt somehow confused HAL or 'mount'
or something.

Anyway, it works like I want it to now.  Thanks for the help.

No, it does not work as expected.

I was trying to create a copy of a Knoppix 5.1 live/install CD, as a
test. I launched K3b and then put the Knoppix CD in scd0 and a blank CD
in Scd1, closed the drawers, and waited until the lights on the drives
went out. In K3b I clicked on Tools > Copy CD. The dialog box showed
two drop down boxes. The top one said Source Medium and showed the
Knoppix CD. The lower one said Burn Medium and showed Empty CD Rom.
When I clicked on Start it proceeded to copy the Knoppix CD to /tmp.
The light on scd1 remained off. When it finished copying the Knoppix CD
to /tmp it paused and asked me to click on Continue. When I did it then
copied the contents of /tmp to scd1. The result is that it takes twice
as long to copy the CD because of the separate copy/write processes,
plus it litters the hard drive. It does delete the file from /tmp when
it is finishes. But my point is that it should be able to copy directly
from one drive to the other without using the hard drive as an
intermediary. I can do this on my Windows 2000 desktop where I also
have two optical drives, and I'm sure it can be done on Linux. I just
need to figure out which CD copy utility to use.

I recently tried Brasero. It works better; that is, it appears to be
willing to copy directly from one drive to the other. However, when I
start the copy process it errors out. The error message says the burn
medium is not mounted. Yet it is definitely mounted. It is obviously a
bug. 

Maybe there is another utility out there to try -- that is other than
K3b, GnomeBaker and Brasero.

Interesting.  Learn something new every day.  If I was a worm, I'd aim
for your command history next.

Has this sort of worm been a problem, or is this more of a preemptive
strike?  I know there have been some brute-force ssh attacks.

... John can't use both CDROM drives ...

I have two CDROM drives, and can read from one and write to the
other, both by device name ( /dev/cdrom and /dev/cdrom1 ) in
command line scripts,  and using gui apps such as K3B .

However, my drives are two different models.  The gui apps you
are using might be getting confused if both devices are exactly
the same type.  Maybe.

More likely is that both drives are not getting seen for some
reason - BIOS configuration, for example.  On the command line
in a shell window, type "dmesg | less" and see whether both
drives are seen during bootup, and what devices they are assigned
to.  There is a lot more debugging beyond that, but the dmesg
information will split the problem up.

Subject: [PLUG] Secret message web page
Message-ID: <20070414175852.GA17471@gate.kl-ic.com>


I set up a "secret message to Keith webpage".  I think.  As I am
not a security guru, I could use some help checking my logic.

PGP is too hard for most people to figure out.  About every 6 months
or so, some random computer-illiterate semistranger needs to send
me a short secret message, say to send a password or encryption key.
These are not high grade defense-level secrets, but a little more 
than I want to trust to clear-text email.

Hence the webpage.  It is a simple form, accessable through port 443
(SSL https web service) on my server:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"><html><head>
<meta name="description" content="Send Keith a Message form">
<title>Send Keith a Message</title>
</head><body>
<FORM METHOD=POST ACTION="https://www.keithl.com/cgibin/XXXXXXXXX.cgi">
   <INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="FORMVERSION" VALUE="XXXXXXXX.html 2007Apr14 KHL">
   Enter text to send to Keith Lofstrom in this text box
   <INPUT TYPE="submit" NAME="EXECUTE_OPTION" VALUE="Send page to Keith">
   <br><TEXTAREA ROWS=20 COLS=90 NAME="TEXT53"></TEXTAREA>
</FORM></body></html>
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The POST data is sent to the XXXXXXXX.cgi script (name obscured) on
my server, which sends back a confirmation page (https of course)
and emails me (internally, over a VPN link) the information and 
some environment information such as the date, the script and form
names, the IP address of the remote browser, and whether HTTPS is
turned on.

This is not bulletproof;  it is a self-signed cert, for example, so
it is somewhat vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack.  But hey,
if Eve works that hard to access the information, she would be more
interesting to talk to, anyway.  :-)

Is this an acceptable approach, or it it too weak to bother with?

Keith

I'm not sure what you want to do is advisable, honestly.  Most CD-ROM
copying apps default to copying files to a temporary directory on the
hard drive first because it's much safer.  Copying directly from CD-ROM
to CD-ROM introduces all sorts of possibilities for errors -- jitter
errors, uneven read/write speeds, I/O errors, etc.  All of the advice I
ever saw about copying CD-ROMs on usenet, in a Yahoo group I used to
belong to devoted to CDR issues, recommended not trying to make a direct
CD-to-CDR copy.  Your chances of ending up with coasters are much
greater.

See [1] here what the Feurio FAQ has to say about it.  Quote: "So
'on-the-Fly' copy should only be used if e.g. there is no room on the
harddisk for an image. Making a copy via an image file is always much,
much safer!"

More likely it is I who is confused. They both appear, but I can't
always tell which one the app is referring to. That's because the apps
label them "HL-DT-ST-DVD-RAM GSA-H22L (/dev/scd0)" and "-scd1)," but
the last parts of the label are truncated because the little window
where they appear is too small. You can't enlarge it or scroll it.

They are definitely both seen and both available. In K3b they both
appear. In fact, I can tell which is which in K3b once I have inserted
a disk because K3b then labels the little window with the name of the
disk or with "Empty CD-R medium." GnomeBaker is not so clever and I'm
not sure it actually sees them both. But I discovered a long time ago
that GnomeBaker is not as good as K3b so I generally don't even try it.
Late last night I also installed Bonfire (Brasero) and it works even
better for copying than K3b, but still can't do what I want to do.

The problem is that if I insert, say, a live/install CD for Fedora 7
test2 in the top drive (scd0, I assume, because the top drive is the
master), and a blank CD in the bottom drive (scd1), both are shown in
the little windows in K3b. When I go to copy from the top drive to the
bottom drive the popup window correctly shows two windows, the top one
(labeled Source Medium) says "Fedora 7 test2 ..." and the bottom one
(labeled Burn Medium) says "Empty CD-R medium." Both little windows are
drop-down boxes, and the bottom one offers the option of "Use the same
device for burning." 

Let's suppose I leave the bottom window on "Empty CD-R medium" and hit
the Start button. K3b goes out to scd0 and starts reading the Fedora 7
test2 CD. I expect any moment for the light on the bottom drive to
light up as K3b starts writing to it. But the drive light stays off. I
look at the progress details in K3b and note that it is copying the
contents of scd0 to the hard disk. When it finishes writing it to the
hard disk it proceeds to write it to scd1, completing the copy. In
other words, it works. The part that I am complaining about is that it
takes twice as long as it needs to because it uses the hard disk as an
intermediary.

After I installed Bonfire last night I tried the same thing. At first I
thought it was going to do the copy without needing the hard disk.
Indeed, it did not start copying the contents of scd0 to the hard disk.
Instead it errored out with a message that it was unable to mount scd1
(although it was mounted because an icon for the blank CD appeared on
the desktop). So Bonfire is close to doing what I want, but too buggy
to get the job done yet. 

Note that this is on Fedora 7 test3 (actually test2 updated to test3).

I'm not bitching because it doesn't work; Im bitching because it
doesn't work the way it supposeds to.

This provides you with no real security, since a MITM attacker can
intercept the initial connection and provide their own self-signed
certificate to the browser, simultaneously establishing a connection
to your server.  They can then decrypt and re-encrypt the session.
Since your cert is self-signed, the user has no way to determine
whether your cert or the MITM cert is legit.

If you can provide the cert signature to the person ahead of time,
they could verify it when the self-signed warning pops up.

Also, I assume you have considered the fact that *you* have no way of
verifying the identity of the sender?  If the interface is open it
could be subject to spam.

I think the Phillips VOIP 841 phone looks like a solid, possibly Linux
based, Skype phone that doesn't even require a separate computer to run
Skype.  Strangely, I can't find any ads for it that aren't trying to
charge pounds or some other non U.S. currency.  If it is a $150 phone,
that is another concern.  Another downside, the screen won't support
video conferencing.

I'm wondering if I should get another Yealink USB-P1K phone for a friend.
Thing is, von-phone.com doesn't seem to even provide the Fedora Core 3
driver for it anymore.  I have XP Home running under vmware player on my
friend's box and on my laptop as well ( because it's Fedora Core 5 based. )
Did the non-gnu project to develop an OSS driver for the Yealink USB-P1K
phone that works with the 2.6 kernel ever succeed?

Why are there so few Linux compatible Skype phones on the market?

I'll second the issues of the self-signed cert.  You really do need the 
"I am who I say I am" bit for this whole thing to work.  (Whatever 
happened to the freegeek semi-monthly keysigning anyway?)

My thoughts exactly.  Anything resembling a POSTable form anywhere on 
your website will be immediately pelted by bots (as soon as they find 
it) looking for naive e-mail scripts that don't protect the header from 
being appended by the form content.  If you're not careful, the page 
could even be sending spam to *elsewhere* without you knowing it 
(unless you're watching the server log.)

You want to be sure you don't have *that* sort of cgi script.

You probably also want to make it a password-protected page.  Hand-out a 
one-time password to your visitor over the phone (or e-mail if you 
must, since the risk is greatly reduced by the expiry window.)

It would be helpful to get a little surrounding context.  One might
assume that at least part of the kernel is loaded by the time you see
this message.  Google brings up some ubuntu-related hits, for example:

http://www.mail-archive.com/ubuntu-bugs at lists.ubuntu.com/msg156648.html

If your error is the same as this one, then it's a faulty init script.

Subject: [PLUG] CentOS 5 is cool, but ...
Message-ID: <20070414195307.194a3706.johnxj@comcast.net>

I installed CentOS 5 amd64 on my new desktop this morning and spent
some time playing with it. Pretty cool. It found and autoconfigured
everything. I like it a lot.

There was one problem with the installation. When anaconda got to the
partitioning part I told it to create a RAID 1 partition of 20 GB to
install itself on (md2). My intention was not to disturb the Fedora 7
installation on md1. It created the partition without incident, but as
I finished the partitioning it insisted that it had to install Grub on
md2. The only other option was not to install a boot loader. I knew
what would happen if I continued and let it install Grub on md2, but I
continued anyway and, sure enough, it set up the new Grub as the one to
boot to. I think I should have told it not to install a boot loader and
then add it to the boot loader on md1. Oh well. I can fix that later.
My complaint is twofold -- 1) anaconda should have detected the
installation of Fedora 7 on md1, realized it probably had a boot
loader, and offered to add CentOS to that menu.lst and, 2) the option
not to install a boot loader should have some text with it to describe
why one might choose this option. 

So now it is running and I have it configured and stuff. It uses
2.6.18-8, which will cause the gigabit Realtek on the motherboard to
cause a kernel panic if I don't leave the Realtek disabled in the BIOS.
Fedora 7 test2 updated itself the other day to 2.6.20-something. And I
also note that CentOS 5 comes with OpenOffice.org 2.0.4, where Fedora 7
and Feisty come with 2.2. 

It also failed to mount the Fedora 7 partition, but I was able to do so
manually. However, I added a line to /etc/fstab to make it mount md1 on
boot, but the line doesn't work. 

In the process of playing with it I managed to upgooberize yum. It
won't launch. From the command line I get:

There was a problem importing one of the python modules required to run
yum. The error leading to this problem was: 
No module named cElementTree
Please install a package which provides this module or verify that the
module is installed properly. It's possible that the above module
doesn't match the current version of Python, which is: 
2.4.3 (#1 March 14, 2007, 19:01:42) 
(GCC 4.1.1 20070105 (Red hat 4.1.1-52))

Well, gosh. I'd really like to install the module that yum needs except
that it seems that yum doesn't work so I can't install anything. Does
this thing come with a backup-yum or something? And does anyone have
any idea what I need to install to get yum working again? Assuming I
can figure out how to install things, should I just reinstall yum?

Thank you, Carlos.  It very likely is the same bug.  The context is that the 
half-screen of messages (after the grub menu) ends with the lines I quoted.  I 
did not write down the lines before the word "boot".  If it happens again I will 
do so.  (I assumed that you experienced folks would know what routine generates 
the word "boot".  I have no clue.)

It seems strange that this problem first appeared a few days ago, yet I have 
been running Kubuntu 6.10 Edgy Eft for some months.  A recent update must have 
broken it.  Maybe it is way to get people to switch to Feisty (7.04).  (Damn, I 
wish we could stick to just the numbers.)  But I want to wait a bit.  I can live 
with this bug for a while.  Better the devil you know than the devil you don't.

Thanks again.

It occurred to me that I focused on the negatives of your approach,
and missed one positive.  With the self-signed certificate, you do
ensure that the message cannot be read by a *passive* attacker (i.e.
someone just sniffing and capturing the traffic).  In order to read it
the attacker must actively perform a MITM attack.  So you are in a
sense providing a bit more security.

Everyone is always uppidy about MITM attacks. The truth is, nobody can
MITM you out on the big bad internet. That'd require compromising an
ISP's core router, and mirroring a port to a compromised box. Oh, and
the ability to inject packets, so said compromised box would have to be
attached to the same router. It's very unlikely to find such an environment.

Just like "IP addresses are easy to spoof." They aren't, once you cross
out onto the Internet. I guarantee (almost) that your ISP won't send
packets that aren't sourced from their address space. And your ISP's ISP
will most certainly drop packets that aren't sourced appropriately. (See
BCP38 - yes, people do it)

So MITM attacks will happen on your local internal network, or on the
other person's. The local subnet is always the most insecure. Now, if
your remote friend does get compromised, and an attacker does happen to
be camped on their router (not likely), they'd never know it. They'd be
used to arriving at your form and getting a cert error, so they'd just
continue as normal. You could have them "install" the cert and tell
their browser to always accept it, but then you get back to that ease of
use issue.

If this will be used by many people, I'd suggest password protecting it
first of all. Buying a $20 SSL cert from godaddy is also a good idea.
(Yes, their CA cert is in everyone's browser)

Self-signed certificates are not necessarily more vulnerable
to MITM attacks than certificates signed by the Certificate
Authorities that Web browsers know about. Just get these
people to import your CA certificate into their browsers.
Of course, the problem here is how do they know if they're
importing a legitimate certificate for your CA. You can
provide this assurance to them by having your Web site
protected by a certificate issued by a CA that is already
known to their browser.

You can further reduce the risk of MITM (and other attacks)
by having them use browser-side certificates (so your Web
server knows the client is genuine). You can issue these
certificates to them using your own CA.

Then you have the problem of ensuring your CGI script is secure.

I favor not using browsers and Web servers when you have
to move sensitive data. Take it "out of band". Provide them
a program that knows how to send the data to you over a
secure, authenticated channel that's independent of the rest
of the world. If they're running Windows, you're a bit
limited but there's Putty that can be wrapped up in a bit of
Python, tclkit, Java WebStart, etc.

The truth is Keith's use for this isn't worth the effort of setting up a MITM.

He has described a system that makes the cost of compromise higher than the reward
of compromising.  That's good security.

I guess you could try installing the rpm directly that contains that
module.  I believe it would be the "python-elementtree" rpm:
http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/centos/5.0/os/x86_64/CentOS/python-elementtree-1.2.6-5.x86_64.rpm

As for the detection and updating of grub for other distros (in your case
FC7), I don't think it's a very wise idea for one distro to try to update
another distro's grub configuration.  Some distros may do some pretty funky
stuff and if CentOS were to go an try to update them, it may just end up
hosing the configuration completely.  A better solution is to offer to
install it's own version of grub and add entries for the other OS, or leave
everything alone and make the user set things up.  Which is sort of what it
sounds like CentOS did, although I agree that some descriptive text
describing these options would be nice.

You're right about being uppity about MITM attacks--they're fairly hard 
to pull off and whatever Keith is exchanging is probably not worth a 
cracker's time.

It's not impossible, though--if you were, for example, a federal agent 
granted powers of warrantless wire-tapping or just cozy with compliant 
megacoms.

With certs available so cheaply, it's probably worthwhile if for no 
other reason than to not have to repeatedly explain to people that they 
just need to accept the cert and move on.

Message-ID: <8fcf3b560704161021u62b4423am2e4b5fe76154000a@mail.gmail.com>

All,
    We have a Samba FS with about 500GB worth of data and are looking to
develop a plan for disaster recovery that would allow for as little downtime
as possible.  First off I was wondering if people had suggestions on
measuring the amount of change to the FS on a daily/weekly basis so I can
get an idea of space and bandwidth needs.  Secondly, beyond the more
traditional approach of doing backups to tape/disk, I was wondering if
people had thoughts/experience with doing some kind of live offsite
mirror/replica of the FS.  This has the advantage of if the main FS/site
goes down, people could just VPN to the offsite location and continue
working as normal, albiet somewhat more slowly.  Is it feasible?  (The FS is
connected via Comcast Business Cable - 8MB down/1MB up)  I guess this will
depend on how much change takes place.  Any recommended tools to do this?
Obviously regular rsync's would do it, but a quick google search turns up
interesting results like tsyncd, csync2, drbd, openafs.  Any thoughts or
advice on the topic are appreciated.

Not to mention it probably isn't a good idea to train your
non-security-aware acquaintances to automatically accept those warning
dialogs.

You're right, it is much more likely to have a rogue administrator in
that ISP.  Or a rogue government placing illegal wiretaps everywhere.

I agree with you, that it is unlikely someone with MITM Keith's
connections, which is why I sent my second message.  But he should be
aware of what could happen, if someone wanted that information bad
enough.

That is true... now.  If that had always been true, then smurf attacks
never would have been an issue.

And there's the cure-all (assuming Keith has a dedicated IP for his
server).  I'm not sure I'd go with godaddy, since they seem to be a
bit spineless on their customer's legal rights
(http://seclists.org/nmap-hackers/2007/0000.html), but in general
getting a cert is not that expensive and would solve this issue.

I don't know of any "easy" semi-automated way to do this. One way to do this
would be to run rdiff-backup to another on-site machine. If you examine the
size of the diff after your second backup, it should show you the volume of
the data change. Repeat that a couple times and you can get an idea of the
rate of change.

I've only seen this done in practice on Windows with XOSoft WanSync (now
owned by CA), which is very spendy ($2200+ per machine, so $4500+ minimum to
get started). According to the guy I spoke with who actually ran some
machines that used it, it worked well and for his business it was money well
spent. I'd love to hear what you manage to come up with for Linux machines.
I'm working on getting our backup regimen re-done right now as well and this
sort of solution is interesting to me.

I agree with this sentiment entirely. However, looking at the problem from
this angle, is the information sensitive enough to warrant the amount of
work required to intercept the plaintext email that would have been sent
normally? Only Keith can really answer that, but as mentioned previously
with regards to MITM attacks, I'd wager that the effort required to
intercept that mail is pretty substantial already, corrupt ISP admins aside.

Other than that, this approach has a couple of other effects. It heightens
awareness of security amongst people who wouldn't really think about it
otherwise (good), but it does so in a non-standard way (bad) that isn't
likely to be usable when working with someone other than Keith (bad) but it
is something that they can grasp (good).

Personally, my solution to this problem is to either get this sort of
information over the phone or in person when possible. When that is not
possible I change the password immediately if it allows access to sensitive
information. For most stuff though, the value of my secrets are so low that
anyone going to the trouble of intercepting them is in for a net loss on the
project, so I don't worry about it much.

That is an excellent suggestion.  While this page won't be used by
many people, I may set up something that is, and those little popup
warnings are annoying.  In the past, certs usually cost hundreds of
dollars a year, and I put up with a little annoyance to avoid that
cost.  But $20/year is quite affordable.

I use dyndns for all my other registration and DNS needs.  They don't
offer certs yet, but perhaps they will in the future, so I will check
with them first.  I don't know how long it takes for a CA cert to 
become available to people's browsers, or what the process involves,
but if this happens quickly I will try to go with one provider.

I use multi-site dirvish backups, and it works great.  The only challenge is
setting it up - and adjusting the disaster recovery path to point to the
latest snapshot.  

Otherwise, I'd look at this software (not FOSS), but seems to do what you

You have to generate a private key and a certificate-signing request 
(CSR), then send or upload the CSR to the provider.  The provider 
generates a certificate which you then download and point your web 
server at.  Sometimes there is an intermediate certificate that you need 
to install; basically it is another certificate from your provider 
signed by a bigger provider, because the actual provider's cert wasn't 
in the standard keystore.  I've had to do this with one of the cheap 
cert providers; it's generally one additional line of configuration and 
the end users do not notice.

Another benefit, of course, is that if you have other services on the 
host that you want protected you can use it for them also--just as long 
as the hostname in use matches.  If you had a server called 
'home.kl-ic.com' that you were going to host this web app and also 
provided SMTPS and IMAPS so you could access your e-mail remotely, you 
can use this same cert with all the servers.

I have heard all sorts of nasty things about GoDaddy from different 
sources, so I won't use them.

There used to be a free SSL cert group that used a web of trust scheme to 
verify certs.  I can't remember the name at the moment.  There are ways to 
generate self-signed certs, as well as create your own root CA.

godaddy.com has really hurt me, they know nothing about the .net framework and can't keep their servers up and running very well. I can tell you geocities works very well but the people there can't help you much so you are on your own. And as for the Java web page editor it only works in Windows.

I have heard all sorts of nasty things about GoDaddy from different 
sources, so I won't use them.

There used to be a free SSL cert group that used a web of trust scheme to 
verify certs.  I can't remember the name at the moment.  There are ways to 
generate self-signed certs, as well as create your own root CA.

Subject: [PLUG] when to blackhole routes?
Message-ID: <200704161721.57675.carla@bratgrrl.com>

Under what circumstances does it make sense to blackhole routes? Assume you 
are using the null0 interface in Quagga. An obvious example is blocking 
spammers or other pests, like out-of-control web spiders. What about blocking 
RFC 1918 addresses entering or leaving your network with routing commands 
instead of iptables rules? Isn't that more efficient?

Isn't blackholing an invitation to a syn flood attack anyway? Can you use the 
ip command's 'unreachable' rule option, which sends a 'Network is 
unreachable' error?

Subject: [PLUG] - CentOS 5, + Debian Etch
Message-ID: <20070417000927.3e7a7f01.johnxj@comcast.net>

This evening I decided to wipe out CentOS 5 and try Debian Etch amd64
(final) on my new computer. Installation went without issue, although
the installer is not graphical. The installer worked, albeit parts were
a bit confusing. 

Before installing it I removed the Intel 10/100 PCI card that I got
from Free Geek, then went into the BIOS and enabled the onboard Realtek
8169 gigabit. With other distros the Realtek was either ignored or it
would cause a kernel panic, so I had left it disabled. The first bit of
good news is that Debian Etch is the first distro that not only found
it but autconfigured it without so much as a hiccup. Yay!

The bad news is that it failed to find the onboard sound. This is the
first distro that failed to find the sound chip. However, I have a
guess -- the sound is also Realtek, and the sound and the gigabit are
the only Realtek items. 

More bad news is that it failed to detect the nVidia GeForce 6100 and
the Viewsonics G90f monitor. Fedora 7 and CentOS both found them and
autoconfigured them. However, Feisty Beta also failed to find them.
Maybe it's a Debian v. RPM thing.

I also had to add "noapic acpi=off" to keep the mouse click from dying
and to make the clock correctly. But I've had to do that with every
distro so far.

It installed IceWeasel instead of straight Firefox, and the default
browser is Epiphany. Java works, but no flash out of the box.
OpenOffice.org is only 2.02, but everything works. I put a movie in the
drive and Totem popped up and played it fine (but sans sound).

Now off to fix stuff and play with it.

The Debian User list is pretty helpful with issues like that.  The
subscription page for all official Debian lists (there are lots of
them!) is here:

http://www.debian.org/MailingLists/subscribe

You probably want the plain ol' 'debian-user,' unless you want to test
out your Catalan, Icelandic, or Ukranian language skills. :-)

The officially unofficial repository for all evil proprietary stuff is
here:

http://www.debian-multimedia.org/

If you're sticking with Etch, you'll want to add the following to
your /etc/apt/sources.list:

deb http://www.debian-multimedia.org etch main

That will get you access to flash, the packages you need to play back
commercial DVDs, w32codecs, and other stuff.

But maybe you knew that already.

IMO, Debian testing is the sweet spot for desktop usage.  The new
testing repository is "Lenny."  I have been using Etch for a least the
past year, while it was testing, and experienced almost no problems.
It's more stable than many distro's releases, tends to have fewer bugs
and fewer uninstallable packages than Ubuntu's releases.  At the same
time, it generally stays pretty current, often bordering on
bleeding-edge.  Big packages, like new versions of DEs, will take a few
months to migrate to testing from Sid (unstable), but most packages move
from Sid to testing in a matter of days.  The gutsy go ahead and run
Sid.  Sid, however, is almost guaranteed to have some breakage once in a
while, so you have to be prepared to deal with that.  From my POV, Sid
usually acts as a nice buffer for catching and solving the bigger
problems before they hit testing.  That's not to say testing is always
bug free, but they tend to be niggly rather than show-stopping bugs.

But I wouldn't upgrade to testing just yet.  There will probably be a
period of instabilty as packages that have been held back (while Debian
was focussed on releasing Etch) flood into unstable and then into
testing.  I figure on waiting a month or two and monitoring the mailing
lists to find the appropriate time to make the jump.

Good idea. Done. I gather there are no forums?

Having used Ubuntu for some time I am familiar with adding
repositories. I note that Etch does not have System > Administration >
Software Sources, a handy little GUI tool for managing repositories
that Edgy has. However, I knew I could do it in Synaptic as well.
Unfortunately, I need the key and my attempt to retrieve it with wget
failed with a 404:

wget http://www.debian-multimedia.org | sudo apt-key add -

But it's not critical. Synaptic lists 17,504 packages, so I probably
have most stuff already. 

> IMO, Debian testing is the sweet spot for desktop usage. 

After having fiddled over the past couple of weeks with various
distros, including several RPM based distros, I think I have to agree
in general about Debian. Nothing in the RPM world comes close to the
ease of package management on Debian. I take back all the kvetches I
voiced in the past about Synaptic. However, I think I'll stick with
Etch for now. The purpose of the new computer is 1) to give me an
alternate way to get on the net when I hose my laptop again (a regular
occurrence) and, 2) to function as a network storage place for backups.

I'm not ready to commit fully to straight Debian Etch for the new
computer. I plan to try out Feisty as soon as it is final, then I'll
settle on something. Maybe I'll just use both as a dual boot.

Speaking of backups, my laptop has not been seriously backed up for
some time. All I have is temp backups to my thumb drive. So this
morning I got NFS working so the new computer can see the laptop.
(Thanks to William at the Clinic for teaching me how to get that
going). However, I still need to create the partition for the backups
on the new computer. There are 232 GB free on each of the two drives
and I want to create a RAID 1 partition. I opened gparted in Etch, but
it does not seem to be able to create a RAID. It can see existing RAID
partitions, and it can create new regular partitions, but there is no
way to tell it to create the new partition for a RAID. I searched in
Synaptic on "raid" but nothing showed up that said it could create a
RAID partition. I could boot to the install DVD and use its partition
tool, but is there some other tool in Etch that will create a RAID
partition on unused space?

We have scheduled the WGT hacking workshop for Noon until about 4pm
this coming Sunday, April 22, 2007 at the Urban Grind (where we have
our monthly meetings).  We'll have some WGT634U's there to play with.
I'll have a couple serial console cables.  I'll be happy to share
anything I know about them.  Hopefully, Jason McArthur will come too
and share his OpenWGT and/or OLSR know-how (and/or, and/or).

What to bring: yourself, your interest, your gear, a laptop if you've
got one, USB hubs, USB devices, a few lengths of cat5 might come in
handy, and anything else moderately interesting or related.  If you've
got a non-WGT634U AP that is OpenWrt'able (or otherwise custom
firmware reflashable) that's fair game too, though I'll warn you I
have less experience with those.

If you have questions, comments either post them here or email me.  If
you are interested, but can't make this particular one, please let me
know.  If there's enough interest, we can try again later.

See:

There are some around, but I'm not sure if any of them are sponsored by
Debian.  I'm not partial to web forums myself, I much prefer mailing
lists and usenet.  (Note that all the Debian mailing lists can be
accessed via gmane if you prefer nntp to email; also, I think you can
get to them via Google Groups.)  Debian is definitely mailing-list
centric.

Here are some Debian-specific rss feeds I'm subbed to, that I find
helpful:

http://www.debianadmin.com/
http://debaday.debian.net/
http://www.debian-administration.org/
http://planet.debian.org/

Another good feed, not Debian-specific, but often has excellent Debian
(and Ubuntu) and general Linux content:

http://linuxhelp.blogspot.com/index.html

And some helpful websites:

http://www.debianhelp.org/
http://www.debianhelp.co.uk/index.php
http://newbiedoc.berlios.de/wiki/Main_Page

And the official wiki:

I've only ever edited my /etc/apt/sources.list by hand.  I'm not sure
why the apt-key failed.  There used to be explicit instructions on how
to install the GPG key on the debian-multimedia website (in the [1]
FAQ), but now all it says is:

   apt GPG key : 
   Install the debian-multimedia-keyring package.

So maybe that's all you need to do.

I'm a very big fan of aptitude (vs. synaptic or apt-get & related).  It
does everything, is copiously documented, and works with or without X
running.  Maybe I'm overly cautious, but I prefer doing the
update/upgrade thing without X running.  Sometimes there will be various
library upgrades that will end up requiring a restart of X anyway or
bork things up if you don't, so I just got in the habit of doing it from
a virtual terminal.  Aptitude's ncurses interface is as easy to use as a
GUI interface once you play with it a bit.

Yeah, I've come to the conclusion that for me it's worth setting aside
some gigabytes for something I *know* will work.  Gives me peace of
mind.  If all else fails, I can always boot into Etch.  And another
route to check out, as an alternative to upgrading to testing, is
backports:

http://www.backports.org/dokuwiki/doku.php

It's pretty useless right now because Etch was just released, but it'll
get back up to speed soon enough.  It's a painless way to get new
versions of popular packages into Etch.

Don't use RAID here.  Search the mailing list archives, or ask on the
list.

And we can already request free CDs for Feisty:

I just ordered the three-pack, two i386 and one amd64. That's the max
you can get free. If others would order some as well we'd have enough
for the Clinic. It's nice to have the pretty Ubuntu artwork on the CD
and jacket.

Is the artwork for the CD available, too?  If so, then one could print
it on CD labels to self-create "pretty" CDs.

Have you tried Memory Time?  They are downtown.  They have been very good

At one time the artwork was available somewhere on ubuntu.com -- I even
downloaded it, intending to use my new Lightscribe drive to put the
image on the CDs. However, as far as I can find, the only artwork
currently available is Dapper:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DIYMarketing

When the Feisty artwork becomes available I might try burning it onto
the media, but I think the Lightscribe driver for Linux only does black
and white so far. I don't know that for sure. I bought some Lightscribe
media at Fry's, but haven't tried to use it yet. 

I should also note that one of the download sites is
mirror.cat.pdx.edu. I bet if I took my laptop there with an ethernet
cable I could get all the ISOs pretty fast.

Heh as long as its not throttled. Reminds me when I once plugged into an agg
switch at Pacifier back in the day - was a field tech for them at the time -
and downloaded Redhat 7.2 in something like 8 minutes or something insane
like that .. lots of bandwidth good :)

It's there! It's there! Ubuntu's main page now says it is released! Yay!

But the download page won't load and mirrors.cat.pdx.edu isn't coming
up either. Oh I want it so bad! Hurry! Hurry, before I wet my pants!

Awww.

Well, it's not there. All they were doing was changing the web site so
it said "countdown to" instead of "release tomorrow." So here I sit,

 Let us know how it stacks up you've become PLUG's own distro watch and I
mean that in a good way :) I haven't used Ubuntu in nearly 2 years and it
wasn't really Ubuntu
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/01/31/google_goes_desktop_linux/ it was a
custom version we used at Google.

My gripes at the time were that the installer absolutely sucked, I'm used to
bare bones ncurses installers ala Slackware but this thing made Slackware's
look like it had just been on an episode of "Pimp my installer". My other
beef was lack of package selection during install .. you got what they gave
you then had to go from there ... I'm a type A personality .. I don't want
to have to spend hours/days/weeks removing packages along with their
dependencies that I didn't want installed in the first place.

I admit I haven't tried Debian in something like 5 or 6 years because when I
attempted an install the media would boot and hang at a black screen on my
hardware and I was just too lazy to figure out what the problem was :) But I
am proud to say I have downloaded Etch and am going to give it a spin along
with something called KateOS which is basically Slackware with a graphical
installer and an up to date kernel ;-)

Cheers,

"download?" huh?

For the last many months, you could simply edit /etc/apt/sources.list
and replace "edgy" with "feisty." Then run 'apt-get dist-upgrade' and
reboot. Works every time.
Either way :)

mirrors.cat.pdx.edu is back up now, btw.

(And it does exist on the mirrors, if you know where to look...)

Yes, but I want to install clean on a new partition on my new computer,
not an upgrade.

Not the Feisty final. All that I can find is the beta or the latest
daily build. I wouldn't mind installing those, but we're so close to
release of the final that I'd rather have the final of Feisty.

Subject: [PLUG] incoming fax receiving services
Message-ID: <20070419145609.GB30610@gate.kl-ic.com>


For the last 15 years, I have maintained an incoming fax/modem line.
I get only about 5 legitimate faxes a year now (almost none are local),
and about 10 spam faxes a week.  I no longer use the modem for anything.  
Time to ditch the fax line and save some money.

There are online services that will receive faxes;  some are $10/mo,
some are free.  They email TIFFs or sometimes a special format.  They
usually receive on a dedicated number.  Any suggestions for a Linux
friendly, open format service?

Also, I don't think the senders would object to dialing into an
extension, if the sending fax machine permits it.  Is this feasable?
An extension would weed out most of the spam faxes, and might save
money for the receiving service.  Ideas?

Keith

It's not throttled - to most of the Internet (long story).

Current bandwidth utilization 707.27 Mbit/s

There's a little bandwidth meter at the bottom of the main page.

John:

Thanks for the pointer!  I did some research, and came across this:

  http://www.atpm.com/5.06/efax.shtml

In which some of the respondents claim that jconnect is the same company
as eFax.  eFax has become very slimy (channelling junk faxes and charging
the customers page fees on it, selling email addresses to spammers, etc.)
j2 itself is slimy, and anti-FOSS, see:

 http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=2005080914234645

One of the alternatives suggested by one of the commenters on atpm is
this service:

  http://www.maxemail.com/

MaxEmail Lite is $24/year plus $10 signup for up to 500 inbound pages
per month.  Pages can be emailed as PDFs or TIFFs, and can be stored on
their server and retrieved with SSL.  They claim to never sell their
list to spammers, and actively fight it with some measures to detect
likely junk faxes.  That sounds good, I will learn more ...

I also found these comparison lists:

  http://faxing-service-review.toptenreviews.com/
  http://www.faxbeep.com/internet-fax-forum/
  http://www.faxprices.com/

So, I may decide on MaxEmail.  However, it was researching jconnect that
got me going on this, so your experience with that service has led me
indirectly to a service we both may be using soon.  Funny how that works.

Keith,

   With such a low volume, is it worth any money to have someone else capture
all the faxes and e-mail them to you?

   Reading this thread suggests to me that my current solution of keeping the
fax machine from automatically answering that line is the simplest,
cheapest, and most effective. At least, for me.

I've used eFax for a couple of years...it's definitely a little cheesy,
the old Windows eFax client that will run happily under WINE is hard to
find, and the company does spam me.

But...it's free, took almost no time to set up, and
SpamAssassin/Thunderbird seem to handle the spam well enough.

I'd probably use one of the other listed suggestions if not for inertia,
but I figured my tale of eFax might be useful to someone with an
immediate need, not a lot of time, and low standards.  ;0

Cheers,
Will

Subject: [PLUG] Broken root!
Message-ID: <20070419145617.0aeeaeaf.johnxj@comcast.net>

I installed the final of Feisty amd64 Desktop on my new computer this
morning. Then I used the new computer to back up my Edgy amd64 laptop,
preparatory to doing an apt-get dist-upgrade on the laptop. Everything
was going fine on the new computer until I decided I wanted to install
more software. I clicked on System > Administration > Synaptic Package
Manager, expecting the little window for my root password to pop up.
Instead I got a window that said:

Failed to run /usr/sbin/synaptic as user root.
Unable to copy the user's Xauthorization file.

What happened? Root password was working before because I did the
backup as root with the cp command after mounting the laptop via nfs. I
copied everything to a folder I created on the new computer, ~/backups.
I can't understand how it would be possible, but could the backup have
goobered up the root account?

open a terminal and see if you can sudo to root ... if you can then as your

It's likely your hostname change, and your X auth became invalid. 
Log out of your X session, restart X (typically Ctrl+Alt+Bksp), and 
login again.

That didn't work because I couldn't sudo to root. :(

So next I tried Paul's suggestion. I did Ctrl-Alt-Bkspc and got a login
prompt except that the screen was jiggling and the Ubuntu login
drumbeat was continous. I concluded that this was not a good sign. :) 

I tried Ctrl-Alt-Bkspc again, but got the same results. The login
screen does have an Options menu, and one of its options was Restart.
So I restarted, and when the login screen came up I got:

"GDM could not write to your authorization file. This could mean that
you are out of disk space or that your home directory could not be
opened for writing. In any event, it's not possible to log in. Please
contact your system administrator."

Great. Unfortunately, I guess the system administrator is me.

However, when I read that error message I remembered that the backup
was almost complete when suddenly I got about 20-30 messages that it
could not continue because it was out of disk space. Aha! Except that I
could swear that I later went in and deleted a Linux ISO that I really
didn't need. Except maybe I thought I did and really didn't. Oh well, no
problem, I'll just free up some disk space so I'm sure there is lots of
room.

But how to do that? Well, I started with a Knoppix CD, and it
automounted the partitions. Except it didn't really. It did not see the
RAID 1 partition that Feisty is installed on. It did see the underlying
partitions on each disk. So I thought I would just delete the same
thing -- something big -- off of each disk. But that failed because,
while Knoppix wasn't smart enough to see the RAID 1 partition, it *was*
smart enough not to let me muck around in the individual ext3
partitions, even if I did so as root. So now I'm sitting here trying to
think of a live CD to use that would understand RAID partitions. 

Anyone need a computer mucked up? Call JJJ's professional computer
screwup service. I'll make sure it won't even boot! Guaranteed!

I haven't done anything with the Feisty installation other than make
the backup, so push come to shove I can just start over. But if anyone
has any idea how to delete something off the RAID 1 partition when I
can't log in, please share. :)

IIRC, Knoppix mounts existing partitions in read-only mode, so you
just need to remount them read/write.  I quick google search should
turn up examples -- I don't have any handy, and I'm a bit short on
time at the moment :(

This is the crux of why I never plan to use software raid again -- I
prefer external backups for various reasons  (if it's not *in* the
broken computer, you can probably get to it, regardless of what
happened to the broken computer) and Raiding for performance is just a
pain when something breaks.

Hardware raid, on the other hand, works just like a really nice drive,
regardless of what the OS thinks.

I did unmount and remount them. And Knoppix seemed to let me delete
files, but each time when I clicked on OK to delete the file I got an
error message about dcop, and then the delete command failed.

The motherboard does have hardware RAID 0 and RAID 1. I started out
using that, but there were problems (which I can't remember). In
further discussion here everyone convinced me that Linux software RAID
was much better than the fakeraid on the motherboard.

As for the problem, I think I'm just going to start over. I need to
delete the Debian Etch partition too. And I want to make the rest of
the disk RAID 1 for the backups. Then I won't run out of room. This
morning I did the backup just to the Feisty partition because I was in
a hurry to get the laptop backed up so I could apt-get dist-upgrade it.

After I reinstall I'm going to experiment by disconnecting one of the
drives to see if the computer will boot with just one. After all, the
purpose of RAID 1 is disaster recovery, and it only make sense to test
the recovery plan to see if it actually works.

Never mind. Booting to recovery mode worked. Since I was automatically
root in recovery mode I was able to delete a bunch of stuff, then
rebooted. Normal login again. All is well. 

For some reason Feisty did not install gparted. I'm trying to install
it right now, but Synaptic is failing to fetch the files. Firefox goes
places, so network is up. Must be the Feisty repos are being hit too
hard. Which reminds me of something else -- while on
mirrors.cat.pdx.edu this morning I noticed that PSU is a mirror for the
Ubuntu repos. I wonder how Synaptic decides where to go to get things.

Message-ID: <1008052944.1177037807156.JavaMail.root@fepweb07>

Has anyone seen something like this ...

I just installed Suse 10.2. I configured Evolution just like I had with Ubuntu. Mail for a while did not work. I fussed, changed nothing really and then it started to work but I alwasy got this error message.

"RCPT TO <my_comcast_address> failed. Requested action not taken. mailbox unavailable"

I'd get a window popup with that message three time (one popup; the message was repeated in it three times. The mail still worked and was sent.

Now, the popup does not appear. Mail appears to be working. I called comcast twice but of course had to be uising windows and Outlook Express on another machine when I called. Outlook Express worked fine. Comcast will not talk to me if I mention I am using Linux or Evolution of even Outlook. It must be Outlook Express.

But honestly I made no config changes between when it worked and when it didn't. I did reboot a few times. But the working was not linked with one reboot. I don't see why multiple reboots would make mail start working.

So much of what I said here sounds like nonsense (to me too). My question is has anyone seen that error message I quoted above and if so, what does it mean.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <20070419211722.e4d834b7.johnxj@comcast.net>

I just discovered something while playing with my new installation of
Feisty. If you go into System > Administration > Software Sources you
can change the mirror to download from. I set it to
mirrors.cat.pdx.edu, but then I had only about 1500 packages. When I
went back into Software Sources I noticed that you can also specify
http or ftp. It was set to http so I changed it to ftp. After reloading
I had more packages available than before -- 21,115. More important,
using the Ubuntu server for the United States (the default) the
download rate was around 20K/s. Now I get 4-500K/s. 

This tip doesn't work on Edgy because Software Sources only gives you
two choices.

This is just mucking with /etc/apt/sources.list by the way. You can find
whatever mirror you want and put it there. mirrors.cat.pdx.edu, of
course, is good :)

I can't explain the http/ftp weirdness you saw. Perhaps universe and
multiverse repositories weren't enabled..

I tried out the MaxEmail demo, and it works fine, so I signed up.
The default process receives faxes at a dedicated phone number in
the Chicago suburbs (local or toll-free numbers available for an
additional fee) and sents them as PDFs to the email addresses
associated with the account (up to five).  I changed the service
to just send notifications, storing the fax messages on their
server (accessable as PDFs with any SSL-secured web browser). 
Someday I will set up procmail so emails from MaxEmail will kick
off a secure wget or something similar.

The MaxEmail web interface is nonintuitive.  A redesign would help,
and thumbnails for the stored faxes would be nice.  But for $2/month,
I can jump through a hoop or two.

BTW, I also learned today that MyFax, another highly recommended (??)
alternative, is owned by Protus, one of the biggest fax spammers in
North America, broadcasting spam into the US from Ontario.  Now that
I am signed up with MaxEmail, I will probably learn something nasty
about MaxEmail, sigh.

Message-ID: <af070b010704200710i6274f534l20626cc28acd05e8@mail.gmail.com>

I have a wrt54g wireless router in which I have installed openwrt in client
mode. So for instance in a motel room I can put the wrt54g in a position
that has a stronger signal and then run a wire to my laptop sitting
somewhere else in the room. Right now it has the antennas it came with but
often I am still getting pretty weak signals so I am interested in getting
an antenna with a little better  gain.  9dbi or better would be nice. The
requirements are that it be easy to transport, that it have the correct
RP-TNC connector, and it should be less than $100.  Does anybody have any
suggestions or experience with such antennas?

Thanks,
Bill Barry

Ted,

You may have a different version of evolution from the previous distro.
Try deleting the meta data for you local mail box.  Delete the *cmeta,
*ev-summary *ibex* files in the ~/.evolution/mail/local directory.

Do you want an omni or a directional?  You've got lots of options,
none of them are likely to be perfect.  

I got a cheapo magmount 7 dBi with an RP-TNC connector (circa $15-$20),
but it fell apart pretty quickly in the rain on my car roof.  It would
probably do better inside.  Two of those would give you diversity.
Like this one:

  <http://sharper-concepts.com/product/YSC-RE07U>

You could get a window-mount 9dBi direction for pretty cheap.  One
practical problem with a directional is figuring out which way to
point it.  There is a package (wl, i think) for the WRT radio that
will report RSSI (relative signal strength indicator) and can help you
determine the optimal direction.  These are lightweight, good for
transport.

  <https://shop.invictusnetworks.com/detail.php?id=16075>

Or you could get a nice 13 dBi directional, the practical problem
being a way to point it persistently.  They are flat, but meant to be
mounted on a mast or something.  You'd need to cobble together a way
to mount it.  You'd also need an appropriate pigtail (approximately $15).

Invictus is located here in town (Lake Oswego, near I5, actually).
Rick Lindahl.  He might have that cheapo magmount too.

I think directional will give me better gain. Usually it will not be moving
so I will have some
time to aim it.

This is just what I was looking for, window mount and all.

Do you know if they have a real walk-in retail store or should I order from

Here's another option:

  <http://sharper-concepts.com/c=ADNr0jKRPrWyCc3fZiPO8ZVri/product/YSC-RE11DS>

... has spatial diversity and 11 dBi all in one package.  I have no

Yep, that one looks nice also and only $19.95. It has a separate connector
for vertical and horizontal polarity. I wonder what the wrt54g would think
if I hooked up the vertical polarity connector to one antenna port and the
horizontal polarity connector to the other port. That should allow the
router to decide where the best signal is coming from.

There is one with just spatial diversity and a different one with polarity
diversity.  You probably want the spatial diversity one (you can
always turn it on its side to fix polarity problems).

No suction cup though! ;-)

Linksys makes an antenna kit for that router.  The antenna's are 7dBi 
and I have used them several times, all with much success.

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833124155

If the hotel has RJ45 connections you could hook the router up to that 
in the wall then use your routers wireless for yourself.

Rick operates it out of his rather prodigious house.  If you call
ahead, he can show you what he has in stock.  He's got more stuff that
shows on his website, and what he doesn't have in stock, he can get.

Right in town, Pacific Solutions has several different

Sounds like a fun place to shop. I will stop by there the next time I am in
Portland. In the mean time I ordered a  9dbi antenna from Invictus Networks
. It can be mounted with a suction cup and then oriented. It can also be
used free standing and comes with a nice amount of cable. I will report back
on how well it works. I have some other good uses for wifi antennas, so I
will keep these other ideas in mind.

Thanks everyone for your suggestions,

Bill Barry

Hi all.


    I know that this question is a bit off-topic for this mailing list,
but a friend of mine wants me to setup his new computer for him and
wants all his stuff from his old system too exactly as is. My question
is: is Windows (XP) smart enough to not croak and die if it finds itself
running on another computer?


    If not, then what would an EASY way to figure out what stuff is
installed on his current system so I can manually do the honors (when I
say easy, I mean something along the lines of running 'apt-get
--get-selections > someFile' on a Debian-based system)?


    TIA.

Unless it's the same hardware, it'll croak. First thing you'll have to 
do is install all the drivers for any hardware that's different. Video 
card, hard disk controller, ACPI, etc... You'll want to have the drivers 
before you start, or another computer than you can download them on, as 
most likely the network won't work either.

There is a way to do this, assuming he has his
original xp cd, or one of the same version and vendor.


1. Image the system over to the new drive, using
whatever method you prefer. 

2. Boot and see if it will redo drivers(you will have
to re-activate windows most likely). 

3. Failing a successful boot, insert the cd, and do a
"repair installation". This is done by going past the
first prompt for opening the recovery console(skip it
as though you were going to do a fresh install).  The
installer should then search for other installations
of windows, find the one you have on the disk, and ask
you if you would like to do an automated repair on it.


This should get it to reinstall the drivers, and get
you running.  You'll still have to reactivate your OS,
but you should have everything that was on the old
drive as it was. 
There are plenty of instructions on the repair install
on this google search:
http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=windows+xp+repair+install&sourceid=opera&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8

Barring that method, best thing is to make a list of
installed software, and use the files and settings
xfer wizard to make a backup of the things he wants to
keep.  for whatever reason the file and settings xfer
wizard doesnt grab the outlook or outlook express pst
files, so copy those manually.  Then you should be
good to go.  

Good luck!

Jeff,

My understanding of XP is that it will only tolerate a limited amount of HW
changes.
Putting the disk in to a new system will likely have it complaining.
You might be able to call the MS activation folks for a solution at that
point.

I strongly suggest that you download and run the Belarc Advisor
http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html
This will scan the entire HW and SW for the XP system and give you a listing
of:
	Hardware present
	Software present (including product keys) and MS updates.
I use this to document (hard copy) all of my Windows based systems.

If you are forced into loading a new copy of XP, 
it would be best to apply all the current patches BEFORE connecting to the
internet.
How to do that?
I suggest that you create your own service pack.  Download the DIY Service
pack (assumes SP2)
http://www.heise.de/ct/ftp/projekte/offlineupdate/
Download version 3.04

Instructions in English found at
http://www.heise-security.co.uk/articles/80682
[Note: the download pointer from this page does version 3.02 which has a
problem.]

You should then be able to burn the .iso file(s) CD or DVD with all the MS
patches.
The CD/DVD should autostart into a process that will apply the patches.
This process will go through several reboots.

Then you should have a fully patch XP prior to plugging into the internet.
[Note: this process also works for W2K which will migrate to a new system
with some fiddling]

Hope this helps

On a system with IDE drives, switching back to the base microsoft IDE
drivers will be the
first thing to do.  Then doing a copy from one drive to another with
something like
bootitNG.

The other option is to use the transfer wizard to move programs and
files between
machines. This only works if you have enough space on the system.

John gave the best response if your friend insists on trying it this 
way.  But you're far better off to install Windows on the new machine, 
and simple copy over the personal files.  For most normal users' 
profiles this is pretty easy.  I think this method is much cleaner as 
well and better for performance after words.

I just wanted to say "me too" to William's fine advice; Belarc looks
like a nifty tool that I hope I won't have to use, but probably will.

As for Winders in general, I'd STRONGLY recommend you plan on doing a
fresh install on the new box and copy the data over.  Just as the gods
need blood sacrifices every once in a while, Windows needs a good
wipe-and-reinstall every 6-18 months.

Allocate 5-8 hours for the OS install, OS patching, SW install and SW
patching.  Then another 2 hours to get the data and the settings in the
right places.  Finally, save another hour for handholding and
getting-acquainted, because things will NOT be the same as before, and
that will be frightening for the user.

If that sounds like as much work as a Linux conversion, it is, sorta,
except that Ubuntu 7.04 will do it all in less than half the time.

And I suspect Wine runs Windows apps better than Vista does,
  Aaron

I don't know of any recommended reading. There are only a few points
you really need to worry about:

1) What interfaces the enclosure supports (both to the hard drive and
to the host system). More interfaces, more money.

2) What capacity of hard drive the enclosure's chip set supports.
ENU's web site states this in the details for each enclosure.

3) Quality, reliability, etc. are all important, but a little more
difficult to determine short of gathering up personal recommendations.

As for personal recommendations, I bought this CoolMax-branded
IDE/USB 2.0 enclosure from ENU several months ago:
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817146066

I'm pretty sure it's what ENU calls an "OEM" enclosure:
http://www.enuinc.com/encl-oem-002-black.html

It has a steel case with plastic end caps, made to vaguely resemble a
book; includes a plastic stand that the enclosure slides into; odd
graphical decorations on the sides. Feels pretty sturdy, and works
just fine.

Like Paul, I don't know of any reading.  But another thing to consider
is heat dissipation.  I once got an enclosure that worked great as long
as you left the drive exposed.  If I assembled the entire enclosure, the
drive would overheat and then fail.

For a bit of an out-of-the-box idea, if you don't need an enclosure, you
could use a USB drive adapter.  This one takes SATA, 3.5" PATA, and
laptop drives and converts to USB 2.0:

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HJ99DI

We've got them at work and they've been great for backups, restores,
transferring large files, etc.  The largest drive we've tried has been
250 GB and it worked just fine.

Too bad they don't come in FireWire or dual USB2/FW.

Regards,
- Robert

It may exit with a temp_fail. It may deliver to a strange mailbox (not
likely). Mail logs should say - and you may want to enable logging in
your .procmailrc too.

Just vi the file and delete all the ^M's :)

You've got a few significant dependencies (likely updated with your
distro) that could be the cause.  Your MySQL, PHP, rrdtool, and apache
installs at first glance may have been altered.

My suggestion to buffer your services from distro changes is to build
and use packages from source for anything you need un-altered.  That
can become unwieldy, and may not be the right choice for ya though.

Even if I let it go wild, it doesn't finish running for about 40 mins on
~100 hosts. That's not so good for monitoring..

Some things should just not be interpreted.. (in the programming

I went and bought an HP 3150.  My system has been locking up lately.
She reboots just fine, but after a couple of hours, she locks up.

The /var/log/messages file has the following:
Apr 23 20:11:53 atlas kernel: usb 4-5: reset high speed USB device using
ehci_hcd and address 4
Apr 23 20:12:58 atlas last message repeated 2 times

Apr 23 20:18:24 atlas last message repeated 4 times
Apr 23 20:18:52 atlas last message repeated 2 times

I unplugged the plotter, then:

Apr 23 20:18:56 atlas kernel: drivers/usb/class/usblp.c: usblp0: removed

Why so much activity?  Could this be the cause of lockups?

I've got >20,000 service checks against several thousand hosts every
hour with Nagios, and cacti monitoring a a few hundred
switches/routers across the world.

That being said, I can't whole-heartedly recommend either one as I
have my BEEFs with both :)  I would suggest looking at ZenOSS and then
maybe Zabbix if you're wanting to try something new.  I'll be
migrating from the existing setup I built integrating multiple OSS
tools (nagios, ganglia, cacti, cfengine) likely onto ZenOSS once I get
the time to re-work it all...

Take that for what you will.

As it turns out, now more than ever, comments are your friend!
   DEFAULT=$MAILDIR/read   #completely optional
Since the ^M at line end was commented out all of the mail that with foobared
rules ended up in my $MAILDIR/read - I didn't lose a thing.   
I got lucky twice, once with actually defining the default, and then with
having a comment on the same line that filtered the end of line corruption.

If you set up a system for someone who also uses Windows or MAC you might
consider inserting a DEFAULT definition with a comment just in case.

Ah! I did, though it wasn't helpful.

Well, I needed to figure that out to get your message.

I actually used dos2unix to recover from the mangling editor (have a Sparc on
my desk too) and sent that across.

Further moral:  don't trust wsftppro (pro? HA!) to do the right thing with
"auto" detecting ASCII vs Binary files.

Hi all,

Just wanted to mention that my business partner Jen and I will be giving 
some presentations at next weekend's Linuxfest, up in Bellingham, for 
those of you that are going. I am presenting Python for Mere Mortals, 
while Jen is presenting two: Cat to Cat Herder, on moving from techie to 
  tech mgmt.); and So Secure I Can't Log In, discussing the balance 
between security and usability on Linux. Hope to see you there!

Secondly, we have just gone live with a new website, 
http://bandradar.com . It is of course running Linux (Ubuntu), and is 
using PostgreSQL 8.1 and the TurboGears python web framework. If anyone 
has spare cycles to check it out and poke it a bit, we'd love to hear 
about any comments or issues discovered.

Thanks! -- Regards -- Andy

Subject: [PLUG] Borked Edgy > Feisty Upgrade
Message-ID: <20070423221814.7e93a7bf@Devil6.hsd1.or.comcast.net>

This afternoon was the big day. I used Update Manager on my Edgy amd64
laptop to upgrade it to Feisty. All was well until it hung at
"installing new version of config file: /etc/apt/apt.conf.d01ubuntu..."
The mouse and keyboard were dead. Eventually I had to hit the power
button. Of course, it wouldn't reboot. It hangs just before it scans
the hard disk -- way before it gets to X. if I leave it sit for a few
minutes it pops up a BusyBox message:

/bin/sh: cant access tray; job control turned off
(initramfs)

Typing help gives me a list of commands that I can run from the
initramfs prompt, but none of them looked very useful. 

I found someone else with a similar problem on Ubuntu forums.
Suggestions included using a live CD, then mounting the filesystem for
the broken installation, then chrooting to it, then trying commands
like 

apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
apt-get dist-upgrade
apt-get -f install
dpkg --configure -a

Dpkg --reconfigure -a ran for a bit and did a bunch of things, but the
system still won't boot. I know the new kernel is 2.6.20-15-generic,
and 2.6.17-11-generic is what was listed in Grub's old menu.lst, so I
changed it to the new one, but that was even worse -- Grub wouldn't
even start -- file not found. Recovery mode also fails, as does the
earlier kernel listed in menu.lst.

I do have a full backup of ~/ and most of the rest of the installation
made last night. But reformatting and reinstalling will take 8-12 hours
just to get all the apps installed and configured. I'm pretty sure I
can get the system fixed if I can just get it to boot. Whatever fixes
have to be command line, because I can't launch any GUI apps while
chrooted to the filesystem -- the live CD is using the video.

Does anyone have any additional suggestions?

I still recommend Cacti. I've set it up in environments with 100+ 
switches, and countless servers. It does have some scaling issues 
depending on how quickly the hosts you monitor respond to the SNMP 
query. That is mostly solveable by using CactiD, the dedicated poller 
for Cacti that is much faster and efficient than the PHP poller.

I am also setting up a Zabbix monitoring station to see how well it 
scales and reports. It seems promising, but with only a few hosts 
monitored by it so far, I will reserve judgement.

As for the fragility of Cacti. It really depends on what you've updated. 
If you want to provide more details about your round of updates, which 
versions you changed to, etc.
I know for a fact that if you are running an older version of Cacti, and 
then update RRDTool, Cacti will complain. But you can change the version 
of RRTool that Cacti expects in the configuration.

I've been testing out HyperIC ... www.hyperic.com they have both paid and
OSS versions ... I'm running the OSS version and it seems to be running just
fine and there are extenders so you can monitor additional services.

I had a broken feisty upgrde due to my computer hanging in the middle of it
(I have a hardware gremlin somewhere on this box) which I was able to fix
via the bootcd / chroot trick. One thing to be aware of is that you need to
bind mount /dev /and /proc from the running system inside your chroot or
else a large number of package configurations will fail. Once I was in there
I ran "dpkg --configure -a" a few times in a row until it stopped looking
like it was working, and then I did an "aptitude upgrade" followed by an
"aptitude dist-upgrade". As I recall there was also a specific package I had
to explicitly either remove/install/ or configure because it was blocking
the dep finding algorithm in aptitude. Anyway,  I've found that process to
be a bit more stable than jumping right into the -dist. "upgrade" seems to
be less agreessive with what it updates, making the process shorter, and
hitting only core components. Once that is happy I move on with the dist- to
get everything else.

Hope this helps!

Did these lockups start right after you purchased the HP 3150?


Did you make any other changes to your system lately?

Two possibilities.

The system is still up from when I unplugged the printer.

I am using vmware to run an instance of Windows 2000 Pro.  The problems
started sometime after I loaded the printer drivers on to that instance.

I am going to plug in the printer without running vmware and see if it
stays up without vmware running.

The second possibility is that the Printer/USB bridge combination is
lethal.

That makes a lot of sense. I note that a lot of the errors when I run
the upgrade commands while chrooted to hda2 involve trying to display
things on the GUI, but hda2's GUI is not the one that is running.

However, I am unfamiliar with how to "bind mount /dev /and /proc from
the running system inside your chroot." Reading man mount I find

mount --bind olddir newdir

But I am not sure how to use that command in this case. I think I need
to get the hda2 installation that I am chrooted into to use the /dev
and /proc from the live CD, right? So it would be

sudo mount --bind /media/hda2/dev /dev
sudo mount --bind /media/hda2/proc /proc

Right? But then what happens to the contents of /dev and /proc on the
live CD?

Sorry I wasn't clear. I forget sometimes that not everyone has lived with
Gentoo for extended periods. As an aside, doing that (living with Gentoo) is
awesome for buffing up your troubleshooting and recovery skills, you have to
muck with a lot of internals that usually are hidden. But I digress...

The syntax I use is:

sudo mount -o bind /dev /media/hda2/dev
sudo mount -o bind /proc /media/hda2/proc

This must be done _before_ chrooting into the installation on your hard
disk. As far as /dev and /proc on the liveCD, they just keep chugging along.
The bind mount just makes them appear in another place, and they provide
enough information to the chrooted installation for it to complete it's
tasks. Some of what will appear there will not be 100% accurate, but it's
accurate enough for our purposes.

Hope this helps you get going!

Subject: [PLUG] laptop comparisons?
Message-ID: <20070424175645.GO17848@merlot.com>

I'm going to buy a new laptop in 6 months or so, and I'm looking for a
site that allows me to compare detailed hardware specs, like HD
interface (I want SATA), # of USB2 ports, memory capacity, screen
resolution, mobo chipset, etc. The mfr's sites don't show more than a
tiny bit of fluff without some serious digging, and they certainly don't
have any way for me to do a query by features (that I've found, anyway).

I have a Dell C640 that has been great for almost 4 years, but the last
2 summers the LCD backlight has died near the end of the summer (which
coincidentally is also near the end of the warranty). I expect it to die
again in August or September, and once again Dell will replace it with a
refurb. I want to replace the whole laptop shortly after that.

Dell has been fine (thanks to the extended warranty!), but I'd be happy
to switch to another major brand. After schlepping this thing around on
my back for the last month, weight is an issue. Battery life is a big
deal sometimes and not an issue at all at other times; this is really
another side of the weight issue. My Dell allows me to put a second
battery in the CD slot, and then I get over 5 hours of use (and I don't
have to carry the power brick if that's enough time, a big weight
savings).

Suggestions? Sites to use for comparison data across brands? Ideally
with Ubuntu compatibility info also?

TIA.

In the Linux world, we have md5sum, sha1sum, and

of downloaded software. These programs are supplied
with Linux distributions so users don't have to
deal with the chicken-and-egg problem of downloading
them and checking them for authenticity.

Similar programs are not shipped with most versions
of Windows, thus creating the chicken-and-egg problem
of downloading them. Has Vista changed this?
Does Vista ship with an authenticity checker?

Omigod it booted!!! Yaaaaaaaay!!!!!!

After doing as you said I did apt-get install -f and then dpkg
--configure -a and each seemed to fix everything except at the end it
said it couldn't fix acpi-support, powermanagement-interface,
gnome-power-manager, and gnome-session. I tried to remove them and then
reinstall, but stopped after the first one. That is, I successfully
rremoved acpi-support, but then couldn't reinstall it. After that I
decided to leave well enough alone and try to boot.

When I rebooted it came up to a command line with error messages.
Reading the errors I had a hunch the problem was that damn Grub
menu.lst file (I have NEVER had an upgrade fix that thing properly). So
after doing nano /boot/grub/menu.lst I quickly realized that the UUID
might be wrong. I changed it to /dev/hda2, wrote out the file, and
suddenly the boot process continued. I didn't even have to restart. And
then there was my beloved Ubuntu desktop!!!! Happy dance! Happy dance!
Happy dance!!!

There are a few glitches yet to run down. Gnome announced that some of
the gdesklets couldn't be launched. And uname -a says I am running
2.6.17-11-generic #2 SMP. That is wrong -- for one thing this is a
single-core CPU. But more importantly, the new kernel for Feisty is
2.6.20-15-generic, so I must have still booted to the old kernel. Maybe
it's really there and the menu.lst file wasn't updated to show it (it's
not in the list). Yet I launched OpenOffice.org and found that it is
2.2, which means that I must be running Feisty. I can fix these things,
now that it's finally running.

Now I have to go post how to do this on the Ubuntu forums, because
there are about a hundred posts there about hung upgrades. A thousand
thanks!!!

I usually use nagios.  But can you give any details on the breakage?

Message-ID: <8975a95f0704241417q621e3b8anc4a8a0ce13a1d5b9@mail.gmail.com>

I'm shopping for some new machines for work, and I just discovered that an
Optiplex 740 costs $270 less than the HP 5750 machines we've been getting.
Both of these machines are custom configured to be as comparable as
possible. The biggest difference is that the Dell uses NVidia Quadro NVS
210S for it's onboard video, and the HP uses an ATI R300. Both only work
properly with proprietary drivers, and the NVidia is likely to work
substantially better than the ATI. Anyone have any real-world experience
with the 740 and Linux? I'm also considering the 745, which is the Intel
Core brother to the 740, but I would prefer to reward Dell for finally
offering AMD...

That SMP only means that the kernel is SMP _capable_, not that it thinks
there are multiple procs. The best way to see how many cores linux sees is
"cat /proc/cpuinfo". It will have a group of information for each
"processor" linux sees. Note that on multi-core systems this will refer to
cores and neccesarily discreet processors, and on Hyper-threaded systems,
multiple processors will appear, even though there is only one that is just
pretending...

But more importantly, the new kernel for Feisty is

The "correct" way to update grub entries is to run "update-grub" as root.
Note that if you have done much in the way of manual bootloader / kernel
tweaking it may not work perfectly, or at all. However, odds are good that
it will help you out. It actually sounds like you might benefit from
re-installing or reconfiguring grub, as that _should_ get your partition
UIDs in there correctly and should get the auto-magic menu.lst updating
sorted.

   These just showed up today and I've failed to fix them myself. All on
Slackware-11.0.

   1.) I can no longer display PostScript files using gv. When I try, I get a
message box telling me, "Unknown device: x11" and "Error: PostScript
interpreter failed in main window."

   I upgraded gv, libXaw3d, and related tools but this makes no difference.

   2.) When I send a print job (.ps or .pdf) to my network-connected LaserJet
5, the display reads the usual "Processing Job", but that almost instantly
disappears and the "Ready" message returns. Nothing is printed. Nothing in
the print queue, either.

   Both new, both need to be fixed ASAP, and both are resisting my solo
efforts to find the causes.

Help greatly appreciated,

Rich

1. When was the last time the system worked correctly?
2. What has been done to the system between then and when it broke?
3. What have you done since then that did not fix things?
4. Do other, similar systems exhibit these same symptoms?

Note re: 3: "I upgraded x, y, z" is not a lot of information.

BTW, does anyone else here run Slackware?  It'd be cool to know...

   Last week.

   Nothing deliberate by me.

> 3. What have you done since then that did not fix things?

   I upgraded gs, gv, and libXaw3d. Used the packages from Slackware-current.
For viewing PostScript, I ran the pertinent files through ps2pdf and viewed
them in xpdf.

   For printing, I stopped and restarted CUPS. When I look at
/usr/sbin/printers (available since I use the Easy Software drivers), there
are no waiting jobs and all printers are idle and waiting for data.

> 4. Do other, similar systems exhibit these same symptoms?

   For viewing PostScript files with gv, no. I don't have my notebook set up

Does anyone here have experience scaling beyond that threshold?

At work we poll 50,000 "elements", IP interfaces, every five minutes.

I'm not overly enamored of the tool we use, Concord eHealth.

Have you tried OpenNMS? It scales way big. Free beer, GPL, plus paid support 
options.

It has taken me all day, but I now have it functioning almost normally.
Had to nuke the nVidia proprietary drivers in the process. Also, there
were 46 packages listed in Synaptic that were "Installed - local or
obsolete" and should be removed. But just looking at them I knew
something was seriously wrong. Most of them were things I knew were
supposed to be there -- e.g., Gnomebaker, yet there was no newer
version listed. Eventually I deleted batches at a time and then
reinstalled from the "All" menu if the package was still there. The
only ones left now are:

linux-headers-2.6.17-11.37
linux-headers-2.6.17-11.37-generic
linux-image-2.6.17-11.37-generic
linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-11.37-generic

I noted previously that it was booting Feisty with the 2.6.17-11
kernel. I found the 2.6.20-5 kernel in the Upgrade list and installed
it. After fixing /boot/grub/menu.lst (for the umpteenth time today) it
now boots to the new kernel, and the old one is listed as the second
choice. Interesting that feisty will run just fine on the older kernel. 

Side comment: Every time a kernel is upgraded or *anything* goes near
that menu.lst file, /some-effing-thing/ rewrites the root partition as
(hd0,2), which is hda3. There is no such partition on this computer. Of
course, it won't boot, and I have to go in and change it back again. I
have had to do so at least a dozen times today. If anyone knows who is
responsible for this, please let me know. I have friends with Sicilian
surnames, if you get my drift.

So is it safe to remove the headers and image packages above?

Another problem that has me stumped is that every time Synapic does
something it ends with this error message:

E: acpid: subprocess post-installation script returned error exit
	status 1 E: acpi-support: dependency problems - leaving unconfigured
E: powermanagement-interface: dependency problems - leaving unconfigured
E: gnome-power-manager: dependency problems - leaving unconfigured
E: gnome-session: dependency problems - leaving unconfigured

I looked at the relevant packages, and all seem to be fine. I removed
and reinstalled them all, but the error message persists.Does anyone
have a clue about other places I could poke at to see if I can fix it?

A possibly related problem is that System > Quit and the panel shutdown
icon both no longer work. Instead of popping up the window with
shutdown/logout options they just log me out and present me with a new
login screen. The login screen has an Options menu in the corner and
the choices include Shutdown and Restart, both of which still work. Any
ideas?

I do love the new Feisty -- lots better than Edgy. Now if I can just
finish fixing it!

Why are you using a USB bridge here between your printer and your

http://www.nagios.org/userprofiles/viewprofile.php?profile_id=1813

Nagios scales like NT: get another JAWB, and mirror the darned thing.  
(Just Another White Box).

Where nagios *doesn't* scale well at all is things like "oh, we added  
a new class C block, can you please monitor the five servers we put  
at random, changing, IP addies", and "oh, hey, Janice in accounting  
in the Michigan office generates an Excel report on her laptop that  
is business-critical to the enterprise, can you monitor it? Oh, and  
BTW, she's dial-up through AOL..."

Point being: nagios scales just dandy for predictable changes, and  
very poorly for binvironments that fluctuate by the second, or  
minute. For that kind of monitoring, you'd need a traffic profiling  
tool that monitored all traffic, expected traffic, and unexpected  
traffic loss, on all devices, and ports... which BTW, would also be a  
great security detection tool.....

It does.

But my point about Munin/Cacti is that they are quite different from Nagios.
I use nagios for monitoring, but for "host stats" (rrd graphs of NFS
traffic, RAM/swap usage, etc) nagios isn't the answer. And the other
apps don't really do what nagios does.

Zenoss seems to be trying to combine the two feature sets, but I haven't
 tried it yet. OpenNMS is trying to replace HPOV and the like, and it
does fine - as long as you don't want network maps.

99% of what makes a distro a distor doesn't care about the kernel, so long
as the kernel can support the hardware you are using. There are some notable
exceptions to this (the mainstreaming of more aggresive preemption comes to
mind) but for the most part you could be running any kernel and Feisty would
still feel like Feisty.

Heh. I think you're misinterpreting the Grub view of the world. My
understanding is that  (hd0,0) is the whole first drive (effectively the MBR
as far as Grub is concerned), (hd0,1) is the first partition, and 0,2 is the
second. So (hd0,2) should correspond to hda2. I could be wrong though, I
haven't had to look at grub internals in some time.

So is it safe to remove the headers and image packages above?


Only if you are not using them. Once you are satisfied that the new kernel
is working, removing those will free up some space, but otherwise having
them around isn't hurting anything.

Try running aptitude, it might spit out more information. Alternatively, and
probably a better choice, run synaptic and use the "Broken" filter to
quickly find the broken packages (anything that is being left unconfigured
due to missing deps will be condsidered "broken") and then you ought to be
able to get more information about why the deps aren't being met. Often you
need to remove a package that is blocking a dependency to make it happen.
Sometimes it's a version conflict, or a package has changed names. Usually
those packages come from thrid party repos, so if you have any of those in
your sources.list, it might be wise to remove at least until this is sorted
out.

if your acpi and power management stuff isn't installed correctly, those
functions will surely fail.

I've been looking at Zenoss as well, and I hope to get  an test installation
done in the next couple of weeks, or maybe just download their virtual
appliance to get a feel for it. In any case, I'll be happy to share my
experiences once I have some...

I've been a TG fan for a long time, nice to see it getting used more and
more for real sites! The site looks good. Something I might find useful
even!

I've got a couple of comments on layout / interface:

1- Are you totally married to the color scheme? Generally it's ok, but the
red borders on the nav elements make me sad, though it looks good on the
banner. True to form, I don't have good suggestions for alternatives
though... Well, maybe add the beveled look that the banner has to nav boxes.
That might help.
2- Consider adding the ability to look at a category broken down
alphabetically. Something along the lines of having hte alphabet at the top
o the page, and when one click on "M" you see all the "M" items, that sort
of thing. I'm sure there's a real name for it... But in any case it would
help the mile-long scrollbar syndrome, which will only get worse as the site
matures.

That would be, for example, Arbor.  They sell themselves as a security detection
tool.  Our capacity planning folks get more use out of the tool to answer
questions like why bandwidth usage is spiking at a location.  Any tool that
monitors IOS Netflows is good for that.  Scary amounts of detail though.

I wish I could claim that the title was my idea, but our extremely witty

Well, I managed to recover about 80% of it, and it was partly my fault
as it turns out.  The debian upgrade installed apache2 (cacti had been
running on apache 1.3).  Also, our cacti was (heh) installed from
source, so installing the debian cacti package on top busted it
(causing the /etc/cacti/apache.conf to point to the wrong place).
Reversing those two errors, it is mostly working again.  However, the
20% that is still broken is arguably the most important part, the
top-level graphs.  All I get is a text-link to a series of graphs at
various time-scales (those work).  There is some unresolved
speculation that the mysql upgrade (from v4 -> v5) might be
responsible.  The thing that led me to upgrade at all was an inability
to create an interface traffic graph for a new host (all the old ones
were working), but the rrd creation was failing for some unexplained
reason.

If you forward it to your manager, make sure the log is gone from your 
own eye before tackling his/her splinter/log:

  * treat your manager as a resource, not an enemy

  * admit to your manager and customers when you are stuck on a project
    and don't know the next step

  * support your manager when in the company of your colleagues

  * defend your current projects and the trade-offs necessary to
    implement them in business terms, not merely technical terms

  * never, ever close a ticket or project until you get unambiguous
    assent that the customer is 100% happy with your solution or
    workaround; let your manager handle sociopathic customers who
    refuse to be satisfied no matter what.

  * let your manager know the kind of projects you actually enjoy
    doing -- proactively -- so s/he can try to get you some time
    in those areas

  * make sure your manager is never surprised by significant problems,
    human or technical (except acts of nature), so s/he can defend the
    trade-offs you've made to the rest of the company

  * admit at all times that computers and the software that runs on
    them are tools, not objects of veneration, and that different
    tasks sometimes require tools you don't normally recommend (or
    even like to use)

I believe you have anticipated next week's installment!

Charlie is a gentlemen, so it won't include the exciting bits of random 
violence that I would insert. But it will be a good and valuable article 
anyway.

Bill,

   Yes, first thing. /usr/sbin/printers shows all printers as idle and
waiting for jobs. Bits go down the pipe to the printer so that it displays
"Processing Job" for a couple of seconds before returning to Ready status.

   Printer self-test works. I can ping it from my server/workstation.

   Cannot successfully print from any host.

   Logs available via wget as a tarball:

Likely you're either having problems with:

rrd file creation, which you can start diagnosing by running the
poller directly or checking the logs with then enabled in debug mode
(Settings->General->Poller Specific Logging).

or improper/corrupt entries in an RRD, you can turn on debug output
for graph creation in Graph Management.  Pick one you're having
problems with and then select "Turn On Graph Debug Mode" at the top;
you'll get cmdline rrdtool details and the resulting exit code as well
as (hopefully) a graph if it's working...

Drop a line if you find something indicated that you need help with.

No, that is one thing I am sure of. In Grub-ese hd0 is the first hard
disk and the partitions are numbered starting with 0. So hda1 would be
(hd0,0). Trust me -- I am most experienced at fixing this. :(

OK, good advice. I'll leave them around for a while. There is a Grub
boot menu entry for the 2.6.17-11-37 kernel. However, what Synaptic
lists as removable are the headers, images and restricted-modules
files, nothing with the word "kernel" in it. My problem is that I don't
understand what each of these things does. As long as the computer will
still boot from the Grub menu entry without the headers, images and
restricted-modules, then I suppose it would keep Synaptic tidy to get
rid of them I need to study up on what each of these things does.

I fixed the Synaptic error messages. Once I re-read the error messages
after a night's sleep I realized that the whole thing was hanging on
acpid. The others were failing because they depended on acpid. I had
already tried reinstalling all of them, but that didn't help. This time
I did a *complete* removal, then reinstalled them. That did it, no more
error messages.

However, the Exit-Shutdown problem remains, so evidently the acpid
issue was not part of it. I probably need to reinstall whatever module
does that. Unfortunately, Alacarte doesn't display the System > Quit
entry, so I can't just right-click on it to see what package it calls.
It's not critical, but it's worrisome. Maybe it's part of some deeper
problem that is going to rise up and bite me in the butt an hour before
a term paper is due. Computers know when you are desperate.

I'll keep poking around until I figure out the Shutdown problem. Thanks
for the help. :)

in Ubuntu-land:

image = kernel
headers = kernel header files (generally only needed for compiling kernel
modules)
restricted-modules = modules that are not part of the mainline kernel and
may have some freedom issues (nvidia, ATI, some wireless, etc...)

Hm. Interesting. Perhaps try re-installing "ubuntu-desktop". That is the
meta-package that depends on all of the components of a standard desktop
setup. If there are any packages missing that ought to be in there,
re-installing that should pull them in. Don't have any suggestions beyond
that off the top of my head...

OK, then all I need to keep is the image. I just need to be able to
boot to it, just in case. Besides, if I delete the image I know
Synaptic will muck with the menu.lst file again. :(

It fixed itself. Iwas by accident. I was trying to fix OpenOffice.org
by uninstalling, reinstalling, swearing, *completely* uninstalling,
reinstalling, swearing, "locate openoffice," then a lot of "sudo rm"
and "sudo rmdir" in order to get things wiped out in order to start
over clean. Gawd that program puts stuff in places where there aren't
places. I love it, but *damn.*

In the process, to simplify things, I did sudo su, and suddenly the
desktop changed from jjj's desktop to root's desktop. Oops. I finished
the deleting, and then closed the terminal window. But when I tried the
shutdown/logout button it worked! In other words, it was broken only
for me. So I decided to just restart the computer. And when it came
back the shutdown/logout buttons were working normally. So evidently my
acpid stuff fixed it, it just needed the desktop reset to take effect. 

Now all I have left is fixing OpenOffice and getting the nVidia drivers
back. I'm sure glad Ubuntu comes out with a new version only every six
months. :)

PS. Check the Ubuntu Installation/Upgrade forum. The electrons are
flying at hyperlightspeed in there.

Subject: [PLUG] how to obtain a java vm stack dump
Message-ID: <2137430109.1177548338321.JavaMail.root@fepweb05>

I have a simple question . and yes, I've googled and tried some things, but I dont have enough experience to evaluate whether I'm doing the right stuff and would appreciate some guidance. I want to obtain a java vm stack dump.

Here's what I tried . is this the right thing to do?
jstack -m 5037
where 5037 is the pid of my java program.

I'm running on Suse 10.2 and -m and -h seem to be the only jstack options that man jstack gives me; but docs on Internet list many other convenient options.  My java is Sun's 1.5.0.0_011 JDK.

My java program hangs and I'm trying to find out why. Interesting that it does not hang on other Linux distros using the same JDK.

Thanks.

Subject: [PLUG] Detecting Drive in USB IDE Enclosure
Message-ID: <462FF69F.1000706@comcast.net>

I bought an Nspire OT352 at ENU. It was $3 more than the generic one
discussed yesterday, but has ventilation slots, which the $27 unit did
not have. It's simple to install the hardware. Now, how do I make Linux
use it?

I connected it to my SuSE 10.1 box hoping to have some automagical thing
happen and I'd be able to see the drive. Sadly, nothing appeared to
happen. I tried two other drives with similar results. I found a web
site discussing using a similar device on a SuSE system. It recommended
looking at dmesg for hints as to where the drive is in the system.

As they are rather lengthy (for e-mail, anyway) the results for each of
the three drives are found here:

Seagate ST313021A, 13 GB
  http://home.comcast.net/~rsteff/USB-drive/seagate.html

Maxtor 84320D4, 4.3 GB
  http://home.comcast.net/~rsteff/USB-drive/maxtor.html

Western Digital 26400, 6.4 GB
  http://home.comcast.net/~rsteff/USB-drive/wd.html

The steps used in collecting the data were as follows:

1. Install the hardware and connect power and USB cables.
2. Turn on USB enclosure power.
3. Run dmesg -c > (a suitable filename)
4. Turn off USB enclosure power.
5. Run dmesg -c > (another suitable filename)

Note that the dmesg pages for the Seagate and Maxtor drives were
obtained after powering up the USB drive enclosure, step 3. Step 5
returned an empty page. However, the opposite was true for the Western
Digital: an empty page was returned in step 3, and the page given in the
link, above, was returned in step 5.

I have connected the USB enclosure with the Maxtor drive to my XP
laptop, and can see the three partitions of the old Win98 file system
installed on it.

XP sees the Seagate drive and properly identifies the model, but doesn't
recognize the two partitions on it, Linux swap and a Slackware 11.0
installation.

XP doesn't see the Western Digital drive, but the USB enclosure's pilot
light blinks about once every 30 seconds, which it does not do with
either of the other drives installed.

What do I need to know about to troubleshoot this?

I took a quick look at your output files and it looks like the usb/IDE
converter board is resetting over and over. Are the hard drives set to
Master or Single? It would surprise me if this were the case and XP is able
to see the drives. Not much in the way of ideas other than that. Every one
of these I've bought lately has "just worked". I did have one a couple years
ago that would only work if it were powered on and the drive spun up
_before_ plugging it into the computer...

There has been a patch on the Cacti website that resolves the graph 
preview display issue.
http://www.cacti.net/download_patches.php

Problems Displaying RRDtool Graph Thumbnails   	 2007/02/02
This patch resolves an issue where Graph Thumbnails do not display 
properly due to an empty comment tag.

Apply the patch, and your graph previews should function properly.

Hi All-
I've decided I want to take debian [etch] for a ride and see what it has to
offer but I need a little advice from some of the more sagely users of
debian. I see 3 DVD ISO's available for the i386 arch [I'm actually using a
AMD64 proc] but the arch doesn't matter much to me, i386 will still boot
just fine ... ps and less just won't be optimized to my hardware ;-) ..
anyways I'm sure I'll need DVD 1 but what about DVD's 2 and 3? I have
downloaded 1 and 2 already but I want to know if 3 is necessary or if I can
live without it? I didn't see a doc pointing out whats contained on each DVD
so pointers to where that documentation lives is definitely appreciated.


Thanks!

Drew-

On the topic of patches there was a pretty nasty vulnerability linked to
Cacti recently IIRC, it caused quite a bit of chatter on the Nanog mailing
list that I subscribe too. There was a patch out pretty quickly for it but
if I remember the details off the top of my head it was pretty serious.

you could run "strace $yourapp" which will give you a full stack trace. You

It should have been automagical.  Here's what I did in script form:

true ; ( set -x
sudo dmesg -c >& /dev/null
# connect USB cable from powered drive to computer
sleep 20
sudo dmesg -c
fdisk -l
# disconnect USB cable from computer
sleep 20
sudo dmesg -c
) 2>&1 | tee output.txt

Here's what output.txt looks like:

This was done using Ubuntu 6.06.

If you don't get any output from the fdisk command, then try changing
the drive's jumper settings, e.g. from Master to Slave or from Slave to
Cable Select or even removing the jumper completely.

Good luck and let us know how things go.

Subject: [PLUG] Error exit status 127 (package manager)
Message-ID: <20070425214403.8f4546ae.johnxj@comcast.net>

I've spent the past two hours trying to fix a broken installation of
OpenOffice.org. I could use some suggestions.

The problem:
OpenOffice.org was badly broken in Edgy. I upgraded to Feisty, which
also upgraded OOo. However the new version was still slightly broken. I
decided to uninstall and reinstall. The removal in Synaptic was no
problem. I cleaned up the residuals and made sure it was a complete and
thorough removal. Then I reinstalled. About half way through the
reinstall the computer locked up. (Ubuntu forums have a number of
complaints about Synaptic locking up the computer on Feisty.)

After I rebooted I opened Synaptic. Whole bunches of messed up stuff. I
thought I had it all cleaned up and I tried to restart the
installation. This time it completed, but gave me a list or errors --
all missing dependencies pointing a openoffice.org-hyphenation. I have
managed to remove all the other packages, but I cannot get rid of the
hypenation package. Everything gives me the error:

 subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 127

I have tried dpkg --remove, apt-get --purge, but neither got the job
done. Someone on a web site said he solved that problem by editing the
reference to the offending package in a "status" file from
"half-installed" to "not-installed." That did make Synaptic stop seeing
it as a residual package, but the minute I try to install OOo again I
get the same error message again.

I need a serious industrial strength package fixer. Any suggestions?

The usual advice is skip the big install images thing, just get the
small net-install CD image and install the packages you want or need
as you need them.  Then never "install" again, just update in place.

Russell;
What version of RRDTool are you using, and is Cacti set to use the 
correct one?
Also, you may need to manually set the RRDTool font path.

Russell, Robert

Thanks for the advice. I wasn't sure how mature the net install option was.
The last time I tried a net install was 2002 and didn't have much success,
was not debian however.

try installing OOo dictionaries-common and then see if you can remove the
hyphenation package. I've found several bug reports relating to the exact
same issue on debian based distros.

If you've got broadband, just download the network install CD (it used
to fit on four floppies but it may be bigger now) and install over the
Internet. There's no need to even make DVDs unless you want to give them
to friends without broadband.

For seeing what is going on inside a JVM at runtime, the most complete
solution is a profiler.  When I get a chance later today, I will
explain exactly how to set up a JVM to run under a free, open source
one.

   Interesting lesson here. Although a bug in espgs-8.15.3svn185 has been
fixed in -8.15.4, and the latter is available in Slackware-current, it won't
work in Slackware-11.0. There must be some dependency other than xaw3d that
needs to be upgraded, too, and I did not do that.

   Removing the newer version and re-installing the older version corrected
both problems.

-current is undergoing a _really_ huge re-work and almost nothing is going
to be backwards compatible with 11.0 but Pat has said he is going to keep
11.0 up to date as much as possible for those who want to stick with a
2.4kernel which won't be offered in what is to become Slackware
12.0 per the changelog. You might check the /patches directory for 11.0 and
see if the update is hiding in there too if you haven't already checked :-)

Anyone else experiencing Comcast connections going up and down this

e-mail I saw the lights on the cable modem not blinking as they usually
do. I power cycled the modem and saw it return to normal. I tried
getting e-mail again and experienced the same problem, looked at the
modem and saw it going through the cycle it does when it is establishing
a connection. That happened another time or two before I was able to get
e-mail. Since then, it seems OK.

Everything has been OK just north of Oregon City in Gladstone.

The net install has always worked well for me, except when I was having
IPv6-related problems back when I was trying to install Debian and/or
Ubuntu on my iMac.

As a matter of personal preference, I think it works much better to
install a minimal system, which would mean unselecting "Desktop" from
the task list (you get there pretty near the end of the installation).
Then after you reboot, install exactly what you want instead of all the
packages Debian would otherwise pre-select for you.

Debian has some handy meta-packages that make it pretty simple to do
this.  For example, 

xorg - provides everything you need for X, except a window manager (take
your pick)
gnome - provides a complete GNOME
gnome-desktop-environment - provides a standard GNOME
gnome-core - provides a minimal GNOME
kde - provides a standard KDE
kde-core - provides a minimal KDE
kde-devel - provides KDE modules for developers
xfce4 - provides a standard XFCE
xfce4-goodies - provides lots of XFCE plug-ins

...and so on.  

One of the advantages of doing it this way is that aptitude (presuming
you use it) will keep track of everything you explicitly install from
the very beginning.  Packages that you don't explicitly install
(packages pulled in as dependencies) will then be removed automagically
when you remove the only thing it said packages depend on.  Just helps
keep your system leaner.

I keep meaning to use aptitude instead of apt-get, but I just can't
retrain my fingers after 7+ years of debian.. is there any reason not
to alias apt-get to aptitude? (iirc, aptitude supports most, if not
all, of the apt-get command params).

Drew,

   Two of three hosts here run a 2.6 kernel; the third can but doesn't need
it. So, it will when we upgrade to 12.0. The espgs issue surprised me since
-8.15.4 was released by Easy Software as a bug fix.

   One of the major reasons I prefer Slackware to other distributions is that
I don't have to futz with upgrades other than the security patches that come
out now and then. Let's me use the machine for work rather than spending
time on the machine itself.

Thats the same reason I use it :)  It looks like upgrades are  going to get
nasty going forward from 11.0 -> 12.0 because of the changes  but I think
it'll settle back in  to /patches mode once 12.0 is released  or atleast I
hope so

Drew,

   Well, the upgrade from 10.2 -> 11.0 was much more hairy than were the
upgrades from 8.0 through 10.2. Pat split things up (six disks! Yuck!) and
we had to install everything, then remove what we don't want rather than
upgrading existing packages. Went from a half-hour upgrade (on our slowest
machine) to a 2+ hour task.

   Guess I'll have to gird my loins for 12.0. They way you write this, there
won't be minor versions in 11. Oh, well.

Rich

Nope no minor versions ... and from the looks of the changelog updates he's
moving away from the BSD style layout he's used since the beginning and
going more mainstream sysv ala redhat, debian et al. Someone who's working
with Pat has developed a PXE installer and USB installers now though :) I
think he's tired of being seen as a niche distro.

   That's too bad. After a couple of weeks getting used to the change when I
moved from RH-7.3 to Slackware-8.0, I found the BSD style init scripts to
make a lot more sense, be easier to understand, and easier to modify and
use. Oh, well.

> Someone who's working with Pat has developed a PXE installer and USB

   USB I know, but PXE I don't. What they have to do with installing the
distribution is beyond my understanding.

> I think he's tired of being seen as a niche distro.

   Perhaps that perception is due to the lack of advertising, spin, buzz, and
other cliches and efforts. If these don't change, then the perception won't,
either. Init scripts and layouts have nothing to do with the reality of
"Slackware: The Silent Distribution." Think of it as a tool preferred by
elitists. :-)

Creating a PXE installer instantly gets them the ability to be accepted into
the business market. Consider something like Rack Space, they need to
re-image 1000 machines at once and they have hypothetically chosen to use
Slackware. Now all they need to do in order to quickly and efficiently image
those machines is turn them on and PXE boot, catch a standardized install
image thats automated and they're good to go.

   A-ha! Similar to Red Hat's cfengine, I guess? (Paul will certainly correct
me if my recollection is hazy.) But, what does this have to do with the init
script style? I don't get it.

> Thats how I've always viewed myself =-p

   :-) I think we're pragmatic, and view the computer as a means to an end,
not an end in itself. At least, that's the way it is for me: I don't make my
living as a SysAdmin, Network Admin, support coolie, or other computer
techie position.

   Thanks for the insight, Drew.

I'll take that lead to offer two corrections:

1. cfengine isn't meant for installing or imaging systems; it's for
    defining and maintaining "normalcy" on systems already up and
    running.

2. cfengine runs on Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, *BSD, and probably
    several other *nix operating environments. It has no ties to
    Red Hat; I know there are no official cfengine packages in Red Hat
    Enterprise Linux (3, 4, or 5), nor do I recall ever seeing any in
    Fedora Core.

CFEngine is a configuration manager, not a boot manager.  The PXE boot
is a network boot where the system to be built wakes up and gets a
default DNS address then interrogates for a PXE server.  This is a
special packet that tells the PXE server to send the first stage boot.
The server determines which first stage to send via the MAC address in a
table the admin has already configured.  An alternative is to just send
a default first stage.  Once the system is booted on the first stage,
which contains the information where the second stage is, the boot/build
process proceeds as anyother build.

That'd be DHCP, not DNS.

I think Kickstart is what people are trying to talk about from RedHat
here, which works nicely in combination with the PXE boot image to do
automated installs.

Very useful, someone already pointed out you get a DHCP not DNS address
though. I've been involved in using an installer/PXE install environment
where we would install 300-500 machines at a time with using only one single
"golden" image so as soon as they are done installing they are ready to be
put into production.

I can think a practical application as an end user being that you do a clean
install, get everything setup just the way you want and then create an image
of this machine and store it on another machine. Something breaks, you get
exploited, whatever ... simply choose PXE as the first boot device in the
BIOS make sure your other server is setup to serve DHCP and boot up and
you're good to go in minutes instead of spending hours/days/weeks
re-tweaking an install.

Good question.  I can't recall anyone mentioning doing that, but I'm not
sure what kind of problems it might create.  You might search the
debian-user mailing list just to see if anyone's discussed that.  The
command-line options that are probably most frequently used seem to be
the same, but there are some options exclusive to apt-get and some to
aptitude.  So I guess it depends upon how you use apt-get; i.e., how
often (if at all) you use any of the options that are different or don't
exist in aptitude.

One thing you might want to do first is look through your installed
packages using aptitude's ncurses interface and make sure everything you
know you want to keep is marked as installed ("i") vs. automatically
installed ("i" "A"), just so aptitude doesn't try to remove something
you don't want it to.

The various command line tools and their options might be a good topic

_Unix_Power_Tools_, (Peek, O'Reilly, and Loukides) is a good book for
command-line tips and tricks. ISBN: 1-56592-260-3.  It's easy to pick
up (well, it's a huge book, but figuratively) and read a couple
paragraphs at random--you're bound to lean something, and the
information density is very high.  (eg: This is how you use X, and if
X doesn't do exactly what you want, you can use Y and Z to make it
behave in your specific situation...)

The tools are generally "old school" and some of the content (at least
in the second edition) is becoming dated, but I still find it valuable
to have around.

I already have a couple such books and I have learned from them. What I
was thinking of was a training session, not a "here, go read about it"
session. Both have their place, but one thing I know about learning is
that some of us learn much better by doing it than by being told about
it. One thing I always try to do when helping someone at the Clinics is
to have them enter the command, click on the icon, launch the program,
etc. It sticks a lot better when they do it themselves. 

The reason I thought of package tools as a topic is because I have just
in the past few days been needing them *a lot* with the Feisty upgrade.
I found that I needed to know the options, especially things like
--purge and --force. (If you are reading between the lines, you have
probably gathered that the upgrade did not go smoothly.) 

However, there are a number of other command line topics that would be
useful, e.g., file management. And the absolute beginners could use
things like auto-completion, arrow keys, and such. 

At one time I had the idea of an interactive web site where people
could practice command line tools. I.e., if they entered the wrong
command the web site would give them instant feedback and explanation.
Unfortunately, I concluded that I will never have the time to do it
myself, and I doubt anyone else here does either. Might be a good
project for a high school kid who knows and likes Linux.

Enough rambling. Bedtime.

Optiplex's and Dimensions share the exact same motherboard in many cases 
(no pun intended).  Bad capacitors can happen anywhere, but were 
extremely common 6 or 7 years ago and effected many manufacturers, not 
just Dell.  I would be more concerned about being required to buy simple 
things such as proprietary power supplies and case fans from Dell than 
bad caps.  Gateway uses off the shelf parts throughout their desktop 
systems btw.

Because my friend's new system had Windows Vista installed on it, I
ended up using the transfer files and settings wizard, or trying to at
least. Vista's "easy" files and setting transfer program complained that
my friend's version of the generated image was "out of date" and I had
to resort to manually restoring everything.


    I appreciate everyone's helpful advice. Thank you all.

Here's how things went.

It turns out that the cable that comes with the Nspire doesn't work on
my Linux machine, but a generic USB cable that I use with my Epson
Stylus PHOTO R220 does work with it.

After about 100 lines of error messages, and less than 1/2 way through
the set of messages, this helpful line appears:

hub 4-0:1.0: Cannot enable port 5.  Maybe the USB cable is bad?

Based on knowing that my printer cable works and the one that came with
the USB IDE enclosure doesn't, I assumed that the cable provided with
the enclosure was bad and returned the whole thing to ENU for a
replacement. When I got it home I had the same problem -- the provided
cable does not work, but my printer cable does.

I'll just go with the printer cable. I won't be using the enclosure a
lot, so it won't be that big a hassle to switch the cable.

Have you tried the provided cable in a different USB port on your
Linux system?  Maybe the port is bad.

Or you've found a bad batch of USB cables.

I tried the cable in the upper and lower USB jacks on the front of my
Linux machine, but not on the rear ones. The printer cable I'm using
works on the front ones. I'll have to try the supplied cable on the rear
jacks.

The supplied cable does work on my XP laptop.

Subject: [PLUG] Bad Controller?
Message-ID: <4634B676.6080301@comcast.net>

Now that I have a convenient way to examine 3.5" hard drives I've taken
the apparently not working 40 GB drive out of my vintage 1995 NEC
machine and found that the drive is working. It's a Seagate ST340810A.
It sounds a little noisy sitting on the desk with no cover on the USB
IDE enclosure, and the word "stalled" shows up when first connecting to
it with Konqueror.

When the drive is installed in the old machine, that machine doesn't see
it. Is it likely the controller is bad, or is the drive failing in a way
that the USB IDE controller can still see it, but the old machine's IDE
interface can't?

(I'm currently copying the contents to another drive.)

Apparently not. The directory structure was copied, but none of the
files. When I look at a directory with ls -l I get this:

Moonguide:/Classical # ls -l
/bin/ls: Beethoven: Input/output error
/bin/ls: Petroucha: Input/output error
...

I'm thinking that the drive has failed, but let me see just a bit of it
before it went. I opened another terminal window and navigated to where
it is mounted and get this:

rsteff at Moonguide:~> cd /media/NEC40GB/
rsteff at Moonguide:/media/NEC40GB> ls
rsteff at Moonguide:/media/NEC40GB> ls -l
total 0
rsteff at Moonguide:/media/NEC40GB>

I can still look at the structure of what used to be there with the
terminal window that I opened earlier, so I guess it must cache things
somewhere. fdisk -l no longer shows /dev/sda, which it did show 20
minutes ago.

If you're determined to try to save it, download a copy the Ultimate Boot
Disk and run the MHDD tool that it has on the drive. It will have to be on a
"real" IDE controller for it to work, not a USB enclosure, but if you run
the surface scan and remap (if it can run) it might be able to let you
salvage some data. I've used MHDD to bring a number of drives back from the
brink. In fact, I have a formerly "bad" HDD running in my laptop right now.
Did a forced remap of a few sectors and it's been rock solid for over a
year.

This java profiler is very simple to use, and very effective.  I
cannot access the user's guide right now due to technical difficulties
with the website, and my emacs JDE prj.el file that contained my
config got overwritten with a "cleaned up" version, which leaves me
unable to provide detailed instructions here.  Perhaps you'll have
better luck with the website.  If I remember correctly, I only needed
to add "-Xrunjmp" to my java command line to make jmp fire up.

jmp is available in the gentoo portage tree.  Perhaps other distros
include it in their package sets as well.  It's always nice to use
package-managed solutions whenever possible.

Subject: [PLUG] Mounting RAID partition with live CD
Message-ID: <20070429191128.6f5d6b44.johnxj@comcast.net>

My new desktop has two 320 GB drives. I set up three RAID 1 partitions,
two when I installed Etch amd64 from the Alternate CD and one more when
I installed Feisty, leaving 249 GB as free space in which to store
backups. Currently md0 is swap, md1 is Feisty, md3 has an aborted
version of Etch and I will just leave it there in case I want to
install a trial version of something else some day. All was well,
except I wanted to create the backup storage partition as RAID 1 also
(249 GB). I have asked and searched everywhere for a tool that can
create partitions and set up a Linux software RAID 1, but have come up
empty. Gparted can see RAID partitions, but cannot create or delete
them.

So today I decided the only way to create the new partition was with an
install CD. I used the Feisty amd64 Alternate CD. It refused to set up
the partition unless I gave it a mount point, so I did. After it
formatted the new 249 GB RAID 1 partition with ext3 I aborted the
installation. But when I rebooted I discovered that it had messed up
something on md1 -- got an intramfs prompt with the error message that
it couldn't find tty. Note that is is not a command line; Linux did not
finish booting, so all the intramfs prompt gives me is a very limited
list of commands.

I was assuming that md1 was intact and all I need to do is get into it
so I can edit the Grub menu.lst file. I booted Aaron's rescue CD and
mounted md1. However, looking at the files in /boot/grub, all are
unchanged. So the problem is not in menu.lst. In fact, thinking about
it, I now realize that the Ubuntu start splash screen started to come
up.

There is nothing that I cannot rebuild on the installation of Ubuntu on
md1, although it would take half a day of configurations to get back
where I was. I considered that doing so might be the simplest solution,
but there are two other considerations: 1) Doing so I would not learn
how to fix a messed up installation and, 2) If I reinstall, I don't
think the partition editor can create any more RAID 1 partitions than a
swap and a root partition. You must specify a mount point or it won't
create the partition. In other words, I'll still need some way to
create the third RAID 1 partition. (And I'm not sure that what I did
today actually created it.)

Any suggestions?

Generally in this case, you need to create them by hand. The tool to do this
with by default in Ubuntu is "mdadm". doing a "man mdadm" will give you the
gory details, and there are numerous tutorials online that can give concrete
examples. Most new-ish software raid howto's should talk about mdadm at some
point.

It sounds like the bootloader is able to load the kernel, but the kernel
can't see the root partition. I have seen this before when the initramfs for
the kernel you are running does not have the proper raid configuration
and/or tools on it. Given your description of your installation and the
process you went through either is possible. One way to solve this is to
chroot into your installation and fix it from there:

1- Boot an Ubuntu Live CD
2- Get your root partition mounted somewhere (say, /mnt/my_root)
3- mount your boot partition in the appropriate place (say,
/mnt/my_root/boot)
4- mount /proc and /dev in an appropriate place ("mount -o bind /dev
/mnt/my_root/dev" and "mount proc proc /mnt/my_root/proc")
5- change root (chroot) into your installation ( "chroot /mnt/my_root
/bin/bash")
6- issue the command that updates the initramfs ("sudo update-initramfs")
7- hit ctrl-d to get out the chroot environment and then unmount and reboot
the system.
8- Get a tasty beverage and enjoy your freshly fixed system.

Hopefully this helps. If you have problems, the Gentoo installation
documents are a good resource for this kind of thing. Check them out and
refer to the sections that talk about "chrooting into the install
environment" or something similar. Oh, and double-check my syntax in the
above commands, I'm just pulling them from memory...

I couldn't quite get it to work, but not because of the commands. 

I started with a Feisty live CD. Turns out Ubuntu left out the mount
command from the live CD. On to the next distro.

Tried Aaron's rescue CD (sort of stripped down Gentoo, command line
only). It mounted md1 and /proc and /dev OK, but I couldn't chroot to
md1. I don't understand enough about shells to have any idea if what I
am saying now is correct, but the error message was "no such directory
as zsh." I think the CD is expecting a different shell than Ubuntu
uses. Or something. This may be fixable if I knew more about shells.

Next I tried Knoppix 5.1. It had a mount command, but it couldn't find
md1.

Ditto for Gentoo.

I'm out of live CD distros to try. :(

I'll go check out Gentoo documentation to see if something useful pops
up.

Hi List,
Let me start by saying I'm a perl newb  :-)

I'm trying to write a small DNS monitoring script using the Net::DNS perl
module. I'm running into trouble when I use Net::DNS::Resolver and define
nameservers($) .. I can loop through them and then using Net::DNS::Packet I
can send a query however it appears that its only sending the packet to the
first DNS server in my list and reporting the return object for both servers
which is not what I want. I've tried getting the objects to return as an
associative array but that isn't working either because its not possible or
I'm doing something wrong. I can post my script if that will help make more
sense of what I'm trying to accomplish. The docs for the module don't
specify either way if they methods can be used in an array context or not.

Drew-

Never mind.

In the process of trying things, during one of the reboots I didn't get
the CD tray open in time and it tried to boot my regular install of
Feisty on md1. But instead of giving me the intramfs prompt, this time
it started fsck. And when it was done it said there were too many
errors. After I finished fixing it manually Feisty booted normally. :)

Now, off to figure out mdadm.

No way...  I can't believe they left that out... I haven't actaully tried
that on a Feisty liveCD, but leaving out "mount" strikes me as being highly
unlikely. had you changed to a root user beofre trying it? "sudo -i" or
"sudo bash"?

Sounds like Arron's might use zsh, which might monkey with things that refer
to /bin/bash. Try the chroot command with that on the end, it might "just
work". (ie - "chroot /mnt/my_root")

Next I tried Knoppix 5.1. It had a mount command, but it couldn't find

You can probably load the software raid kernel modules and then run a
command like "raidstart" or something similar to get it going. I seem to
remember needing to do that with Knoppix.

Ditto for Gentoo.


Same thing applies here as it does for Knoppix...

Perl questions are probably better answered in a place for Perl questions,
such as perlmonks.org (very fast responses) and beginners at perl.org (subscribe
at lists.perl.org).

I don't have any experience with Net::DNS, or I might have answered you. :)

A code snip would be very useful.

example) $res->searchlist to array of one server to contact, do your query, set
$res->searchlist to next server, repeat query, loop as needed.


The module is set up for generalized DNS use.  To do special operations, like
testing, you need to take special actions.

The docs do specify either scalar or array return value.
It's really safe to assume that if not stated otherwise, the return value shown in
the example is what you get.  If it shows a scalar, you won't get an array, or
even a reference to an array.

Subject: [PLUG] Changing CD drive to DVD drive
Message-ID: <46362A7F.3090508@comcast.net>

This morning I swapped out a CD-ROM drive for a DVD-ROM drive in my
machine. I must need to do something else, because nothing happens when
I pop in a DVD. It used to be that when I popped a CD into the CD-ROM
drive, a Konqueror window opened showing the contents of that CD. The OS
is SuSE 10.1. The drive does not appear in the Disk Information section
of "My Computer". Come to think of it, I don't recall the CD-ROM drive
showing up there, either. There is an entry for "Floppy Drive" showing
the filesystem as auto, along with three hard drive partitions.

The drive does show up in the Hardware Information section of YaST2. It
is listed in the CD-ROM category as: DVD-ROM SD-604 (the Samsung model
number) and under the dev_names section shows the drive as:

/dev/hdc
/dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:11.1-ide-1:0
/dev/dvd
/dev/cdrom

Do I need an entry in fstab? There isn't one for the old CD-ROM drive.
Here's my fstab:

/dev/hda2       /       reiserfs        acl,user_xattr 1 1
/dev/hda3       /home   reiserfs        acl,user_xattr 1 2
/dev/hda1       swap    swap    defaults 0 0
/dev/hdb1       /home/rsteff/2ndDrive   reiserfs   acl,user_xattr 1 2
proc    /proc   proc    defaults 0 0
sysfs   /sys    sysfs   noauto 0 0
debugfs /sys/kernel/debug       debugfs noauto 0 0
usbfs   /proc/bus/usb   usbfs   noauto 0 0
devpts  /dev/pts        devpts  mode=0620,gid=5 0 0
/dev/fd0        /media/floppy   auto    noauto,user,sync 0 0

If I need an entry in fstab, should it look similar to /dev/fd0, like
this (I understand I'll need to create a directory /media/dvd):

/dev/hdc	/media/dvd	auto	noauto,user,sync 0 0

Or, is there some other thing I need to do?

TIA.

I believe you want a seperate resolver object per server.  I wrote a
script recently
that did zone transfers on a list of domains to check for IP addresses
that needed to be changed.  The search list is ment to be a
reliability feature of DNS, such that if you don't get a prompt
response from one server it will try the next.  I used Data::Dumper a
lot when working with this to figure out the data structures, and what
information was actually there.

Thanks to all who replied. I figured Randal would chime in heh. The last
time I tried getting any type of perl help was about 6 years ago and got
flamed pretty badly for it. But it sounds like perlmonks is the place to go
as long as you're not asking someone else to do your work for you as someone
else mentioned.

Thats the ticket right there.  Net::DNS::Packet -> new  will let you return
an array but the list is the problem. Thanks for pointing that out. I'll
give it a shot.

Subject: [PLUG] "Disabling IRQ 7"
Message-ID: <20070430172149.e2f9e53c.johnxj@comcast.net>

On my new computer, which works just fine, when I have a terminal
window open I am getting messages about every five minutes:

Message from syslog at Devil6 at Mon Apr 30 [time]
Devil6 kernel: | 261.040846| Disabling IRQ 7

OK, fine. So if it disabled IRQ 7 and it told me about it, why does it
have to keep telling me every five minutes? Like I care in the first
place. The annoying thing is that I only have a terminal window open if
I am typing a command, right? So the message interrups, wipes out what
I was typing, and leaves me with no prompt until I do Ctrl-c. 

1) Is this important? Is the computer going to blow up? Will this
	remove all possibility of passing on my DNA?
2) Assuming (1) is negative, can I tell Ubuntu to STFU?

Actually, no.  What you were typing is still what you were typing, it is 
just less readable.  Ctrl+L should get you back to a clean screen, 
though that makes the scrollback a bit sparse.  Maybe you can find a 
better shortcut in info:bash.

IRQ 7 is traditionally assigned to the first parallel port, do you
have anything plugged into that (or do you even have one)?  What does
"cat /proc/interrupts" tell you that IRQ is assigned to?

If you really don't care you should be able to change the loglevel
that syslog broadcasts, though I can't remember the exact steps to do
that off the top of my head.  Try man klogd.

Subject: [PLUG] Mount can't make up its mind
Message-ID: <20070430183858.89a260bd.johnxj@comcast.net>

Due to an over-playful cat, the power plug was slightly loose. I didn't
realize it until the screen went black. I rebooted, and a few minutes
later it happened again. Then I discovered and corrected the problem.
However, on rebooting again Feisty can't find the filesystem, which is
on /dev/md1, a RAID 1 device.

Ubuntu does boot, but dumps me to a command line as root. I need to do
fsck /dev/md1, but mount is giving me fits. Here is the output:

umount /dev/md1
umount: /dev/md1 is not mounted
umount: /dev/md1 is not mounted

fsck /dev/md1
fsck 1.40-WP
e2fsck 1.40-WIP
/dev/md1 is mounted
WARNING Running e2fsck on a mounted filesystem 
	may cause SEVERE filesystem damage.
Do you really want to continue (y/n) no
check aborted

mount
/dev/md1 on / type ext3 (rw,errors=remount-ro)
[+ other stuff]

umount
umount: /dev/md1 is not mounted
umount: /dev/md1 is not mounted

I could do this all night, but that seems pointless. Is it mounted or
is it ain't mounted?

Generally if something gets remounted RO due to errors, the mount stuff gets
somewhat wonked. Fixing it from there may end up being an exercise in
futility, and I suggest side-stepping that problem entirely.

It sounds like your RAID and/or the FS hosted on it have gotten
inconsistent. I'd suggest booting with a live CD, starting raid and checking
what the status of it is (cat /proc/mdstat). If it's not totally consistent,
it will start rebuilding, and the output from mdstat will indicate how far
it's gone. Once the array is consistent, run fsck on the partition from
within the livecd. Once it passes cleanly, reboot, and hopefully you'll be
back to life.

Yes, a GUI terminal window.

Thanks. I think I'll work on Jason's suggestion and get it to stop
blabbering about it. Assuming Jason is right and IRQ 7 is the parallel
port, who cares? I've never used the parallel port and I probably never
will. That is, I'll do that right after I fix the filesystem so I can
boot. :(

Subject: [PLUG] Modifying a FreeBSD disk image
Message-ID: <20070501021836.GW2770@amethyst.spiritone.com>

I have a 128 meg. slimmed-down FreeBSD (6.1) image (called pfSense)
that's meant to be installed on a CF card via 'dd of=/dev/hda'.  If I
install it that way it works fine.

But I want to install it on the CF card with other images, some Linux,
and to pick among them using grub.  I think I need to modify the
pfSense image so I can use 'dd of=/dev/hda3' to install it.

Does anybody know how to do this?

I have no prior *BSD experience, but installed FreeBSD 6.2 into a free
partition on my desktop, both to have access to tools for modifying
UFS images and to confirm that grub works with it and Linux.  (It
does.)

I tried just installing all but the MBR (the first 512 bytes) of the
pfSense image into /dev/hda3.  That didn't work: grub didn't like the
partition.  In trying to understand why I noted that the geometry of
my CF card and of the image are very different.  Does that make sense
as an explanation?

I haven't been able to change the image geometry (fdisk on FreeBSD
refuses; it's a known problem) but think I can create a new empty
image with geometry matching the CF card's, make a FreeBSD partition
on it, and copy the files into it from the existing pfSense image.
Does that sound like a reasonable strategy?  Learning a new set of
tools will take some time but can be fun if things start working.

Any other ideas of avenues to try?

Thanks,

--Eric

>From what you describe, it seems as though the image (pfSense) has the
partition table and all partitions.  Using some version of Linux, can
you post the contents of output.txt after running the following script:

true ; ( set -x

) >& output.txt

parted will tell us the geometry, the label, and the partition layout.

                            The Eclipse Foundation

      Agile methods such as Extreme Programming (XP) rely on a
      readily repeated suite of tests to give developers the courage
      they need to continuously improve their code.

      In this talk XP pioneer Ward Cunningham will dissect the agile
      testing strategy and framework that the Portland Eclipse
      Foundation team created while developing the recently deployed
      MyFoundation Portal, a LAMP application.

      The testing framework is notable for two reasons. One, it has
      been deployed into production with the application and serves
      as "open and transparent" documentation. Two, it integrates
      with the application in such a way to make it both simple and
      powerful at the small expense of some test coverage.

      Part 3 of Ward's blog series on the portal includes more
      explanation, screen shots, and a link to the live test site.

Subject: [PLUG] dnscache suddenly stoped working
Message-ID: <4636CD94.2020302@acm.org>

Well it appears it stopped working suddenly.  These dnscache servers 
have been running for a really long time.  Suddenly this week-end it 
appears they stopped replying to (or answering) queries.  In fact I 
can't even get DNS services while logged in to the hosts.

I set up the servers several years ago but now only provide support on a 
part-time/as-needed basis so I only have the story second hand.

We're using dnscache because it's small, fast and lets us provide access 
to 'The Inclusive Internet'.

I checked /etc/dnsroots.global and though they differ from the results 
of a  "dig @m.root-servers.net. ns ." there are enough common IPs to 
make the look-ups work I would think.

Any suggestions?  Ed Sawicki?  :-)


TIA,
Rod

Thanks. 

I tried several live CDs, but either they didn't have mdadm on them or
they couldn't see the arrays. Finally I tried Aaron's rescue CD and it
allowed me to use cat /proc/mdstat. Turns out all looked fine except
the new one that I just created for the backups, which was missing one
of its two drives. Since that one was expendable (nothing on it) I
decided to go ahead and delete it and start over. Suddenly I was
staring at a black screen again, and no cat in sight. Two more
subsequent power failures followed by poking around revealed the real
source of the problem -- a flaky power cord or power supply connector.
That'll teach me to buy the cheapest box in Fry's.

Meantime, after securing the cord the best I could I tried rebooting
Feisty. It failed to mount the swap partition, and it forced a fsck on
dev/md1 (which is its root partition), but when fsck was finished it
found that /dev/md1 was clean. That's the only one that is important --
the others are empty or swap. However, it won't proceed past
declaring /dev/md1 to be clean.

Booting to recovery mode revealed that it goes into a continuous
attempt to load /dev/md3, even though it was deleted. It doesn't show
up in cat /proc/mdstat, anyway. So I used the rescue cd again, and
decided to reformat the partitions that had been used for /dev/md3. As
it was running along, suddenly a black screen again. And again, over
and over. Every time I try to format a partition I get a power failure.
Now I'm wondering if the 380 watt power supply is adequate. At least
one thing is sure -- there is no point in trying to fix the partitions
until I get the power supply stable.

<snip remainder of efforts>

FYI, a live-CD distro you might want to consider adding to your
collection is [1] grml.  It's based off Debian Sid and comes in two
versions -- a small version that contains the essentials and a full
version (under 700MB, fits on one CD-R) that has loads of tools, mostly
command-line based but it includes X and a few WMs (wmi, fluxbox ...
can't remember if there are any others).  As the devs note, it provides
more than 800 packages not found on Knoppix, primarily geared to
sysadmin stuff, data recovery, troubleshooting, network & security
tools, etc.

I downloaded it (the full version) using bittorrent a few weeks ago and
so far have only played around with it a couple of times, but it seems
damn useful.  I thought I might use it as a practice environment, so I
don't screw up my installed OSes; but I think it makes an excellent
rescue tool, especially if you are already familiar with Debian-based
OSes.
