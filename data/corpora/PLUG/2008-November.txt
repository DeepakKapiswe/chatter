Anyone using SpiritOne or Aracnet here will currently be unable to get 
to any site hosted on Sprint's network, and anyone on their network will 
be unable to get to us (Cognet). I have one customer that can't get to 
me. This sucks.

I'm thinking the problem is more Cogent.

SpiritOne/Aracnet get their IP from Cogent. Try going to Sprint.com. I 
have relatives in Molalla that can't check their email on my server 
here. Molalla.net goes through Sprint. It's a frigg'n mess. The internet 
just got sliced up.

Subject: [PLUG] Network card stops...
Message-ID: <1225665054.12149.5.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I have a network card in my server that keeps stopping cold.  If I
unplug the network cable to this FA311 Netgear card and plug it back
in, the link stays up for a while.  The only errors I see so far in
the syslog are bind error messages that the link is down.  The
mobo has an AMI bios and is a VIA Aspen II I believe.  The 
processor is an Athlon 800.  I can't plug/unplug the cable all the
time to get it back up.  Anyone know of a specific issue for this
motherboard?  I looked in the bios to see if I can reassign the
interrupt etcetera, but there were no options to do that.

Does it come back up on a card shutdown?

If so just write a cron/script to shutdown and restart the card every so
often..

Or can you just replace the card??

Subject: [PLUG] Linguistics again
Message-ID: <20081102185228.e8e0cf4f.johnxj@comcast.net>

At the risk of making everyone sick of me, I need to ask for a small
favor.

I am taking a class this term where I have been given a project to
survey random Portlanders for their opinion of how Portlanders talk.
This is just an opinion survey; there are no right or wrong answers. I
am after the opinions of anyone who lives in Portland metro, or used
to. There are three simple questions, to be answered yes or no. (The
data needs to be binary.) You are free to make additional comments
about the questions, as long as you come to a "yes" or a "no." This
might mean you have to decide which predominates. 

This survey is actually expanding a study I did in January, 2007. So
if, by chance, these questions look familiar I may already have your
opinions, in which case please do not respond again.

Here are the questions:

1) Is there a way of talking in Portland that's different from other
areas in the US?

2) Do you think people in Portland speak correctly?

3) Do you like the way people in Portland speak?

Plus I need a small amount of demographic data:

What is your first language?
What is your gender?
What city did you go to high school in?*
What is your year of birth?
What is your ethnicity (e.g., Asian-American, European-American etc.)?
What is your occupation ("computer tech" is adequate).

*If more than one city, list the one in which you spent the most time. 

And since your answers are a bit personal, you should respond off-list,
because anything on the list is archived and available to anyone on the
net. All responses will be converted to anonymous data records and the
e-mails will be deleted. 

I need to collect about 80 responses, so if there are other adults in
your presence as you reply, feel free to add their comments and
demographics as well. 

Thanks in advance!

And apparently hitting "reply" doesn't reply to the sender these days.... :(
I guess I should look in the address bar before sending.
Carry on.

Don't even bother answering.  It seems that rename-buffer is the
ticket.

Subject: [PLUG] $5 USB to wired ethernet adapter at Frys
Message-ID: <20081104054144.GA25800@gate.kl-ic.com>


In a remarkable lapse of judgement, combined with undeserved luck,
I purchased an Airlink ASOHOUSB USB2 to Ethernet adapter at Fry's
today for $5.  It uses the ASIX 88772 chip, USB ID 0b95:7720 . 
After patching the asix.ko kernel driver in my 2.6.18 kernel,
it works!


Months ago, I added a 3rd ethernet port to the old laptop that
I use for a firewall by adding a 3Com 3C460B 10/100 Ethernet to
USB adapter.  That turned out to be plug-and-play ... or almost,
I wanted to enforce a particular eth0/eth1/eth2 order, so some
tweaking was required.

Then I found a couple of used Farallon USB to Ethernet adapters
in the "random USB cables" box at Free Geek.  Those work, too.
Fascinating.  With a USB hub, I can add LOTS of USB/Ethernet
addresses to my firewall.

So when I saw the Airlink $15 device on sale for $5, I thought
I would buy it and try it.  It didn't work the first time. 
The driver loaded automagically, but no packets.  After finding 
patch instructions for my pre 2.6.20 kernel:

http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0701.0/1458.html

... and recompiling that module, it works!

So at least one impulse buy at Frys turned out ok.  A not-so-lucky
buy in my next posting ...

Message-ID: <20081104061003.GB25800@gate.kl-ic.com>


My second impulse buy today at Frys was a Netgear/Zetera SC101
Network Storage enclosure, on sale for $20.  Not so successful
this time, but if somebody brings a Win2K or WinVista laptop
(dual boot?) to the clinic in December, we might be able to
configure it for Linux use.

It is a nice little toaster-sized box. It holds two IDE 3.5 inch
drives.  With the right software on one or two of our laptops,
we could use it to serve distros at the Clinic.

Sadly, it will only configure and partition with Windoze software
(why not a web interface?  twits!) I can load the Netgear
configuration software onto the Win2K VMware image on my laptop,
but the software will only find storage on the same LAN segment.
My VMware image is configured for host-only bridged networking,
on a separate virtual LAN segment from the physical LAN segment
that the SC101 is on.  Hence, the Netgear install software can't
find the SC101 to configure it.

I suppose I could build a second VMware image to use the other kind
of networking (where it makes a virtual connection to the outside
LAN), but instead I'll just wait for the December Clinic ( I will
be out of town during the November 16 Clinic ) and perhaps someone
will bring a dual-boot machine and we can set up the SC101 with that.

If we can get the SC101 configured, we can use this software:

http://code.google.com/p/sc101-nbd/

... which is a user-space driver that will connect to the SC101 .
With two of the $100 750GB Seagate drives installed and formatted, 
any laptop with the driver will be able to pull files off the SC101
over the ethernet.  Thus, we will not be dependent on one particular
laptop to act as a repository mirror.

So that may have been a poor use of $20, but hey, all the other NAS
and SAN enclosures were $200 and probably would work no better.  If
someone else wants to borrow this box and set it up before December,
let me know and I will bring it to one of the meetings this month.

Or perhaps I should find that unused Win2K hard drive that shipped
with this laptop and swap it in and configure the drive that way.
Naahh, that would leave me (and my laptop) feeling *unclean.*  Icky.

I have this exact enclosure Keith. If you upgrade the firmware to gain
Vista support you won't be able to use the open source driver anymore
as it was firmware dependent.

FWIW the transfer rate is not very good for large files. Smaller files
it doesn't have so much trouble with.

You have to rename the "buffer" the shell is in.
You can do this by writing the buffer to a file ^x^s .
Name is something like "shellone".
You should then be able to open a new eshell (M-x shell).

I found an even easier way, one that does not involve writing a file.
I open the first eshell, then use M-x rename-buffer, and give the
buffer a new name.  I tend to use *eshell-1*.  Then I can open another
eshell with M-x eshell like normal.  Your approach is similar; you are
causing the buffer to be renamed, which is the critical piece.

But I might check out some more elegant approaches, like this one,
which supports having multiple eshells on a ring:

I frequently use M-x rename-uniquely for this sort of stuff.

Subject: [PLUG] I broke sudo
Message-ID: <20081105084439.62978654.johnxj@comcast.net>

Hardy x86_64, more or less up to date.

This morning Update Manager launched fine and displayed 10 updates. I
clicked on the button to install the upgrades. Normally this pops up a
window asking for the root password. This time it did not. Update
Manager searched for a bit, then did nothing.

I can also do updates with Synaptic, so I closed Update Manager and
launched Synaptic. That is, I tried to launch it, but nothing happened.
It would not launch. Now, Update Manager uses code in common with
Synaptic, so clearly whatever was wrong with Update Manager is also
affecting Synaptic.

Being a clever little Linux dude I opened a terminal and typed
"sudo synaptic" to see what kind of error messages I got. And sure
enough, I got an error message:

jjj at Devil7:~$ sudo synaptic
sudo: must be setuid root
jjj at Devil7:~$ sudo su
sudo: must be setuid root

So I googled on "must be setuid root" and found a thread in the Ubuntu
forums:

http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=219767

It turns out that the problem listed in the thread is exactly what
happened. A few days ago I needed a graphic located in /usr and I
couldn't get it into the Gimp in anything but read-only mode. The
graphic came as part of the openclipart package that I installed a long
time ago with Synaptic. I have no idea why the package installed the
graphics into /usr with root ownership instead of into ~/. 

The part I did wrong was that I took ownership of the whole /usr folder
instead of just the /usr/share/openclipart folder. That broke sudo.
Fortunately I am not the first Ubuntuoid to do this, and the forum
thread gives instructions for how to fix it. However, the instructions
are not working:

jjj at Devil7:~$ ls -l /usr/bin/sudo
-rwxr-xr-x 2 jjj jjj 122688 2008-09-10 12:42 /usr/bin/sudo
jjj at Devil7:~$ chown root:root /usr/bin/sudo
chown: changing ownership of `/usr/bin/sudo': Operation not permitted
jjj at Devil7:~$ chmod 4755 /usr/bin/sudo  #note that this operation worked
jjj at Devil7:~$ sudo su
sudo: must be setuid root
jjj at Devil7:~$ chown root:root /usr/bin/sudo
chown: changing ownership of `/usr/bin/sudo': Operation not permitted
jjj at Devil7:~$ chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers
chmod: changing permissions of `/etc/sudoers': Operation not permitted
jjj at Devil7:~$ sudo su
sudo: must be setuid root
jjj at Devil7:~$ chmod 4755 /bin/su
chmod: changing permissions of `/bin/su': Operation not permitted

OK, not such a clever little Linux dude after all. 

The computer continues to run just fine, but I have no access to sudo.
Before I mess things up even more I thought I'd ask here for help from
someone who understands permissions and ownership better than me.

If you have the root password, try just running "su" by itself and enter
that password. Then the chown root:root /usr/bin/sudo should work and you're
back in business.

John,

I can't offer any help, but I do want to say thanks. As a user of ubuntu who
has enough knowledge to be dangerous, I can put this down in my book of

At this point, you're going to have to

a) boot from a rescue disk

b) mount the partition on your hard disk that contains /usr

c) chown -R root:root /mnt/tmp/usr (or whatever your path is)

d) chmod 4755 /mnt/tmp/usr/bin/sudo. (I think Ubuntu uses 4755 on
    sudo. CentOS/RHEL use 4111. Either should work.)

e) boot back into your system and test sudo.

After that, you're going to have to find a healthy Ubuntu system and 
figure out if the massive chown you did in step (c) needs to be 
tweaked in various subdirectories of /usr.

Thanks for the suggestion. I do have the root password. Sadly, it did
not work:

jjj at Devil7:~$ su

There were a couple posts in the Ubuntu thread suggesting that Ubuntu
ought to pop up a warning for this type of thing. I just looked at the
folder and said to myself "why, it says 'usr' - that's me!" I mean it's
mine, all mine. Clearly I ought to own it!

If you have a root password, just log out and get to a terminal to login as 
root. If you are at gdm and can't get to a plain text login, use 
ctrl+shift+backspace to kill X a few times and it will quit restarting. Then 
you can log in as root with the root password and fix the required files.

I'm betting you're actually using your own account's password with sudo,
which means you do not in fact have the root password. Ubuntu is set up this
way so that it's theoretically harder for people to hose their systems like
you have so cleverly discovered how to do :)

You'll have to follow the steps Paul Heinlein outlined for you. This might
make a good clinic project.

it will?  methinks not always.  much easier to hit control-alt-f1 and
get to a text terminal the reasonable way =)  control-alt-f7 will take
you back to X-ville.

Packages are (almost?) always installed system-wide, so any user can
access them.  If the content was installed into your home directory,
that would restrict the access to only you.  (and you install things
as root -- how would it know which user's home dir to put the files
in?)

> The part I did wrong was that I took ownership of the whole /usr folder

As a general rule of thumb: you should (almost) never change the
permissions of something under /usr (or really under anything other
than your home directory).  You don't have write access to those
things for very good reasons :).  The notable exception is if you're
following a tutorial you trust, or really, really know what you're
doing.  (For what it's worth, changing permissions is more common in
/var than /usr.  /usr is fairly static -- some systems even mount it
read-only, so not even *root* can make changes.)

The "right" way to do this is to copy the clipart you want to modify
into your home directory, then if you need to put a modified copy back
in to /usr/share/openclipart you can use sudo to do so.  Keep in mind,
when you update openclipart, you may very well loose your
modifications.

My apologies for harping on how you should never touch permissions in
/usr, but it really *is* important :).

To get direct administrative access on Hardy - boot into recovery mode
(Press Esc within 5 seconds of the boot process starting to get to the
GRUB Menu. Then select (probably ) the second option in the GRUB menu -
it should be labeled as "Recovery Mode". 

When you get to a blue screen with three or four options, select
something like (I'm trying to remember) "Drop to Root Shell Prompt".

Then, you'll have direct access as the root administrative user - and
should then be able to execute the commands you've described from the
noted thread.

Mike

The folder in question is the folder that OOo looks in for clipart that
it displays in its Gallery. The clipart in that folder in /usr is
available to all users. But the user is not allowed to alter the file
or do a save as or a save a copy from within OOo. Besides, I would
prefer to save the copy in the same folder so that the copy would also
appear in the Gallery. If any user can use the files in the folder,
then any user should be able to alter the images and place the altered
images back in the same folder - so the altered images would be
available to all users. Making root the owner of this particular folder
was unnecessary from a security standpoint - it's just clipart. And
making root the owner of the folder thwarts users who want to save
images to the Gallery.

Of course you are absolutely correct that I should not have taken
ownership of the entire /usr folder. So evidently I need to take a
course in computer security systems before being allowed to use a Linux
box. :(

But what if a user (accidentally or maliciously) deleted all the
files, or replaced them with pornographic content?  This probably is
not the case for apps like OpenOffice, but some apps just store the
location of images, and then load them again when you open the file --
it could be quite a surprise when you go to give a presentation ;) (ok
-- so the porn example is unlikely on your laptop, but the point that
mistakes happen remains.)

There is a ~/.openoffice.org2/user/gallery directory on my ubuntu box
-- I bet you can put images in there without any additional
permissions, no risk, and no penalty on a single-user box.

Booting to recovery mode seemed easier to me than Paul's idea of a
recovery disk, although that would probably have worked as well. And
fortunately I did get a root prompt. I followed the instructions on the
Ubuntu forum, that is:

chown root:root /usr/bin/sudo
chmod 4755 /usr/bin/sudo
reboot

After it came back up I was able to use sudo commands again. I applied
the updates in Update Manager to verify that sudo is working.

All seems well again, except I need to figure out now what else is
messed up. 

And I also just now set a root password so next time I need to be root
I can do so. Except now I have another damn password to try to
remember. I know - I'll just print it on an Avery label and stick it on
the front of the computer. :)

Thanks to all for the suggestions and help.

I don't understand the question. What do you mean by "write over a
jpeg"? Can you say what you are trying to do and explain step by step
what you are doing to accomplish it?

Try using OpenOffice Draw. That should work.

He probably means putting the image in the background and text in the 
foreground.

Sorry, I wasn't clear..

I want some text over a jpeg.

So I create the text...

Then I import picture and past it over text..

Well, then text runs around picture..  So I select  send picture to back
and text through..  And it just doesn't work for me..
And I did this YEARS ago..  So I know it works.. Just doing something
wrong..

Thanks

Anyone here use SLED 10? I run a Dell Optiplex 160L with a Intel i845 video
and I'm having trouble getting the resolution to set at 1440x900 for a
Samsung Syncmaster 953BW monitor. I got it to 1024x768 but it's still not
sharp. Every time I tried to set it to 1440x900 the whole screen would flip
out or go black.

Any clues?

The video modes you have to work with are a function of the video

which modes your video card claims to support.  Mine looks like this:

I need to amend my earlier post slightly.  The available modes are a
function of your video card DRIVER.  Sometimes you can choose among a
small set of drivers, which might give different results.  The vesa
driver, for instance, can be used with virtually any video card, but
it is the worst choice - a lowest common denominator.  Is the usual
intel driver the i810?  That's probably as good as it gets for your
card.

I don't believe this is correct.  If the default configuration(s) 
isn't working, it should be possible to create a custom modeline that 
will properly drive the monitor.  Prior to the emergence of the DDC 
standard, this was a very common thing to do.  Today the data provided 
by the monitor over DDC normally eliminates the need to create modelines.

David, have you rebooted since hooking up the monitor?  Be sure you 
are not bitten like I was:
   http://lists.pdxlinux.org/pipermail/plug/2008-March/058576.html
Once you've ruled that out, I suggest looking at the X log file 
(/var/log Xorg.0.log on my CentOS system) and looking for the DDC 
info.  You should see your desired resolution in one of the mode 
lists.  Here's an example from my system:

First ensure the picture is anchored to a paragraph or page or
something, not as a character.  (This can be changed through the right
click menu.)  Then, right click on the picture and select "Picture...".
Go to the "Wrap" tab and select "Through" and check the "in background"
checkbox.

This is on OO 2.4.1.

Another approach.  

Create a table (1x1 if you really just want text).  From within the
cell, click "Table->Table Properties" at the top menu.  Go to the
"Background" tab and select "Graphic" in the "As" dropdown.  Then add
your graphic file and decide if you want it tiled or not.

Then, you can just type into that cell to get text over the top of it.
Tables are a very handy formatting tool if you know how to use them.
Don't like those table borders?  Just remove them in the borders tab,
along with the border spacing, and no one will be able to tell you even
have a table there if you export to PDF or print it.

good luck,
tim

I added 1440x900 to other Xorg files. Can't I just add that to the file?

   This works on all versions. Regardless, if the desire is to put labels on
an image the better way is to load the image in the GIMP and use a second
layer for the text. Relative positions remain the same this way while they
may shift with over written text on a background image.

Text over an image in OpenOffice ...
    Click the "Show Draw Functions" icon on the tool bar
    Select the "Text" icon in the Draw Functions tool bar

More about the SC101 -

I was able to configure VMWare/Win2K to use "bridged networking" so
the drive was on the same local segment as the Windoze configuration
software.  Note, I turned off iptables on my laptop (on the internal
network!) so the software could use whatever ports the network
interface uses.  

The enclosure only works with ATA-6 parallel drives.  Nothing older
than about 2004 will work.

Drew is right, the enclosure is  slow.  7.14MB/sec or about 26GB
per hour with a 7200rpm 250GB Hitachi drive.  In comparison, an
7200rpm drive directly on an ATA-133 controller runs around
31MB/sec, and that drive on an external USB2 controller may run
as fast as 19 MB/sec .

I appreciate Drew's warning about firmware - the enclosure came with
4.22.13 firmware, the same as sc101-nbd works with.  The Windoze
configuration app wants to upgrade the firmware to the latest version,
and needs to be configured NOT to.  

All in all, an interesting toy to play with, but not very suitable
for use at the Clinic as I had hoped.  Too many things will need
changing on most machines to access it.  Moving John's USB drive
around will be easier.

Yes.  I don't recall the make/model, but it came from Office Depot.  I
plugged it into the USB port, and it just worked.

   But it probably will work all right as a paperweight or door stop.

The OpenMoko is pretty immature at the moment; to me, it seems like
more of a geeky toy than a useful tool. It has nice specs, even in
comparison to the iPhone's hardware, but there are things missing,
like 3G support. Maybe in a year or so, there will be more and better
applications written for it, as well as a superior hardware platform.
Note that this perspective doesn't come from my experience, just from
reading.

I'll be getting a G1 on Friday for work, so I'll be sure to post
something here about that. It really does seem that a lot of
developers are excited about developing for Android, so there will
probably be some really nice apps for it.

Personally, I will wait another year or two before choosing a
smartphone for myself. The iPhone has clearly started some serious
competition, and by then some of it should be mature (my bet is on
Android phones for the successful competitors). It's the iPod all over
again, except with phones.

The biggest disappointment I've had with the G1 is that there isn't
really any way to close applications -- they just get cleaned up when
the OS thinks it should.  As a result, you can have some apps running
for a very, very long time (and performance seriously goes south at
times).  The garbage collection penalty is fairly high and unexpected.

Actually, it's probably a great example of why you *don't* want a
garbage collector on a real-time OS :).  Practically speaking, this
isn't a big deal on the G1, but it is an annoyance.

(The gmail app also forces you to top-post... <grrrr....>)

That is pretty weird. Seems like your time server may be off by an hour. I
would try updating the time manually, or use a different time server.

A theory:
1. Your Linux system is configure to set your hardware clock to local time,
not UCT.
2. Your computer had been up and running since the change to standard time.
3. So your hardware clock had never been synced to standard time, because the
hardware clock is normally synced to the system clock during shutdown. But
since you had an unclean shutdown this syncing never happend.
4. When it booted back up, the system clock was synced to the hardware clock
under the assumption that the hardware clock was set to standard time when in
reality it was still set to daylight time.

Use the 'hwclock' utility to set/check the hardware clock. See the hwclock(8)
man page.

Generally with Linux you should configure the system to set the hardware clock
to UCT. Then you don't run in to these sorts of problems. The exception is
when you are dual-booting with Windows. In that case it usually works out
better to configure Linux to set the hardware clock to local time to match
how Windows does it.

Subject: [PLUG] Intrepid hoses X
Message-ID: <20081113214054.fda4051b.johnxj@comcast.net>

My laptop is my main computer and I refuse to upgrade to Intrepid for a
while yet. But I did decide to upgrade my desktop to Intrepid just to
see what would happen.

The desktop uses an nVidia GeForce 6150 on the motherboard connected to
a Samsung SyncMaster 206BW monitor. It worked fine with the
nvidia-glx-new driver under Hardy at 1680 x 1050. After the upgrade X
would not start. By editing the xorg.conf file and replacing "nvidia"
with "nv" I got X to start, but it is VESA 1024 x 768. I've tried
several things to no avail. The Ubuntu forums are replete with video
problems after the upgrade to Intrepid. Unfortunately, none of the
suggested fixes have worked, although there are so many posts that I
have not read them all yet.

Somewhere I read that Intrepid uses some new deal with X, but I cannot
find where I read it to report exactly what changes were made. I can
say with certainty that the changes were not necessarily a good idea. 

If anyone has any suggestions, I'm all ears. Meantime, warnings to
those considering the upgrade to Intrepid. Double check your video
issues before doing it.

Maybe I'll bring the desktop to the Clinic on Sunday and people can
poke at it as an exercise in how not to do an upgrade. :)

CentOS to CentOS works no problemo for ftp.  It's when I try ReactOS 
0.3.7 running under vmware workstation 6 that there's a problem.  I keep 
getting a 421 error and then a message that the server has 
disconnected.  It may be the fault of ReactOS's ftp.exe program which I 
figured would be fixed by svn 37350.

I have tried both bridged networking and nat networking.  I unloaded the 
firewall on the host and even tried loading ip_conntrack_ftp.

Thunderbird sort of works in ReactOS.  The icons get screwed up, but 
besides that it works fine.  I'm using thunderbird under ReactOS 0.3.7

NOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooo......

Okay, I guess I'm too late.

There are new drivers, driver settings, kernel modules, xorg configs,  
(etc.) to consider with Intrepid. There are release notes, README's,  
open and closed drivers to weigh, and a large number of forum posts,  
listserv posts, and blogs to read.

Long story short: If you have a (one, single) fairly new-ish (at  
least 6 months old, though) nVidia card, *and* one monitor, *and*  
that monitor is running in 1024x768 in landscape mode, *and* you  
don't want to use your card's effects/GPU/RAM, you're just about golden.

If, OTOH, you have multiple video cards, or custom screen resolutions  
or orientations, or need maximum stability and performance, there's  
some homework to be done ahead of time.

From: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/810

"nVidia "legacy" video support

The 71 and 96 series of proprietary nVidia drivers, as provided by  
the nvidia-glx-legacy and nvidia-glx packages in Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, are  
not compatible with the X.Org included in Ubuntu 8.10. Users with the  
nVidia TNT, TNT2, TNT Ultra, GeForce, GeForce2, GeForce3, and  
GeForce4 chipsets are affected and will be transitioned on upgrade to  
the free nv driver instead. This driver does not support 3D  
acceleration.

Users of other nVidia chipsets that are supported by the 173 or 177  
driver series will be transitioned to the nvidia-glx-173 or nvidia- 
glx-177 package instead. However, unlike drivers 96 and 71, drivers  
173 and 177 are only compatible with CPUs that support SSE (e.g.  
Intel Pentium III, AMD Athlon XP or higher). Systems with older CPUs  
will also be transitioned to the nv driver on upgrade. "

....Yeah, it's a mess.

Fro further reading in the Ubuntu forums several have had luck by
uninstalling all the nvidia proprietary things via synaptic. I had
already edited xorg.conf to set the driver to "nv" so I uninstalled
anything proprietary. Having done that I am worse off - no keyboard and
no mouse. Both are USB (and no, I have no other kinds of mice or
keyboards easily available to try), but I suspect that it is not the
USB that is the problem - uninstalling all the proprietary stuff hosed
enough of X that I no longer have mouse or keyboard. The keyboard does
still work in recovery mode.

My xorg.conf file does list resolutions up to 1680 x 1024. Before I
hosed the mouse and keyboard the only resolutions available in the GUI
were a max of 1024 x 768 in spite of the higher resolutions available
in xorg.conf. Of course, I can no longer log in with the GUI.

In recovery mode I tried Repair Broken Packages and Try to Fix X
Server, but neither did anything. I can drop to a root command prompt.

And when the screensaver comes on in recovery mode I have to reboot
because without a mouse or a keyboard I cannot restore the desktop.

I may have to reinstall. And if I do it sure won't be Intrepid.
Intrepid itself may be OK, but the latest version of X.org that comes
with it was not ready.

Thanks for the comments. :)

Upgrades always cause problems. I found that with Feisty and Hardy. Back up
files and do a clean install. Less headaches.

Message-ID: <20081114195116.5f0ef06b.johnxj@comcast.net>

I'm still trying to fix my broken Hardy > Intrepid update on my desktop. At the moment I can get it to boot in graphics mode at 800 x 600, but the mouse and keyboard are dead. Or I can boot into Recovery mode which gives me a screen from which I can boot to a root command line, and the keyboard at least is then working. However, I just discovered that the network is also dead. That is, my router is 192.168.0.1 and if I ping it I just get "network is not available." Ifconfig shows only lo. Lsmod does not display anything that sounds like a driver for the ethernet, which is:

0:.14.0 Bridge: nVidia Corporation MCP51 Ethernet Controller (rev a3)

Reinstalling from scratch is not a good option. It would take a couple of days to reinstall all the software that is installed on the computer. Therefore I'd rather fix the broken Intrepid. Besides, fixing stuff is always a learning experience.

One thing that would be a big help would be to be able to view what is happening when it boots into Recovery mode. However, the screen flashes by so fast that it is impossible to read the boot messages. Does anyone know if there is a magic key combination that will pause the boot process so I can read the screen?

There is a very good chance that parts of the networking
infrastructure are intentionally disabled during recovery mode.

See if you can start it up manually, something like:

/etc/init.d/networking restart

(run as root) might do it.

'dmesg' will also show you the majority, if not all, of the things
that flash by during a boot (along with other logging-like things).

Message-ID: <ff01ea180811142059xe2ee5a0x65d89a43bff9999a@mail.gmail.com>

  A friend of mine recently picked up a cheap little IBM T40 laptop
with a missing hard drive.  I found out why it was cheap when I tried
to insert a drive and install Linux.  The hard disk driver on the
motherboard is kaput.  Everything else on the machine appears to work
fine.

  It looks like a replacement motherboard on eBay runs around
$100-150.  I was thinking about forgetting the new motherboard and
hard drive and go to a USB flash based distro instead.  A 8-Gig flash
and a small USB hub is only $20-30.  I installed Damn Small Linux
(DSL) on a 512Mb USB flash thumb drive last night.  The T40 booted on
DSL and seemed to run OK.

  Is anyone else running a machine off a USB flash drive?  Would it be
a stable method to operate a laptop?  The T40 will only see moderate
use.  She does most of her computing on a more powerful desktop
system.

Best tool ever. It'll write pretty much anyt .iso to a USB stick or a
SD card, I'm having fun using it to distro-surf on the eee I got.

Sounds like you already have a laptop drive.  
You could get one of those small laptop drive enclosures for about $20 that
plug into USB.
There would be a lot more space that the USB key.

I got the full install of the Fedora 10 beta and Ubuntu 8.10 to run on
the eee, it's one of the ones they're selling at Target. Bought some
extra RAM at Pacific Solutions and it's pretty happy. They come with a
4GB drive and 512MB of RAM, bumped the RAM to 2GB. It's a fun toy to
play with and the reactions people have to it are the best. "That's a
LAPTOP? How much did it cost?" "$300 at Target, it gets online and you
can use office software on it!" ".... I so could afford one of those."
This is from some of the employees at the KFC on 99W in Tigard

  The drive is mine...  It's the Linux drive for my M$ laptop.  It's
usually a Linux machine.  I only swap drives when I want to run a
couple of MS-only CAD programs.

OK, I have been researching and trying to fix this thing. Here's what is currently wrong:

If I boot to the normal option X comes up with the wrong resolution, but it does come up. However, the mouse is completely dead and the keyboard works with Alt-Control-Fn keys only. I cannot log in with the GUI because I cannot enter keystrokes in the login window. All I can do is shell to a command line with Alt-Ctrl-F1. In the shell the keyboard does work. Or I can just boot to Recovery mode and then to the root shell, at which time the keyboard works also. The other options on the Recovery window do not help (Repair X server, Repair broken packages).

The network is also down. 

Lspci tells me that these are the video and ethernet devices:

00:14.0 Bridge: nVidia Corporation MCP51 Ethernet Controller (rev ad)
00:05.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation C51PV [GeForce 6150] (rev a2)

There is no wireless device in this computer. If I do ifconfig all it shows is lo. If I ping my router it says "the network is unreachable."

I have learned that keyboard and mouse are no longer controlled by /etc/X11/xorg.conf. They are controlled now by HAL, and the old sections in the xorg.conf file have been commented out. 

I learned that you can fix your keyboard with dpkg-reconfigure console-setup. This appeared to work and it even detected the keyboard (LogiEX115). But after saving the settings I still have no keyboard in the GUI.

I haven't found an equivalent command for fixing the mouse, which is a Logitech wireless USB mouse.

The following made no difference:
o swapping the mouse and keyboard for old wired ones.
o uncommenting the old keyboard and mouse settings in xorg.conf
o running sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
o adding the busid to the section describing the GeForce 6150

At this point it seems to me that the most important thing to fix is the network. I can't install new things without a network. So my immediate need is to figure out the module that the ethernet uses. Lsmod did not reveal anything that sounded like an ethernet module. Of course, that is because it is not loaded. If I knew the name of the module I could poke at it and maybe wake it up.

I could reinstall, but there are a ton of programs installed on this computer, and even more in Windows 2000 running in Virtualbox. It would take many hours of work to reinstall everything. Besides, fixing stuff is educational, if exasperating.

I suspect this computer is going to be at the Clinic tomorrow. :(

2 days to reinstall giving you a clean system vs. the 2 days you've

working, somewhat not, all kinds of other weirdness under the hood yet

I would learn nothing from reinstalling. Learning how to fix things is much more profitable.

Forgot to add that the problem appears to be that the upgrade to X.org hoses video drivers a lot. So a clean install would likely result in a broken system as well.

I think I have found the source of all my troubles, except I don't know
how to fix it.

I ran lsmod and found a module that I suspected might not be running
properly. So I did a modprobe, only to be told that there was no
modules file in the folder for 2.6.24-19. Sure enough, the file was not
there. But there sure was a dandy modules file in the folder for
2.6.27-7. A quick "uname -a" revealed that I had booted to 2.6.24-19.
Looking in /boot/grub/menu.lst reveals no such boot option. The
menu.lst file correctly shows the new kernel for Intrepid (2.6.27-7).
So then I rebooted and hit esc to get the menu. The menu on the screen
lists only 2.6.24-19. The menu.lst file says only 2.6.27-7. WTF?

All my woes - ethernet not working, keyboard not working, mouse not
working - are probably due to the fact that I am running the wrong
kernel for the drivers installed by Intrepid.

(Side comment: I renamed /etc/X11/xorg.conf to xorg.conf.jjj and
rebooted. X still came up (sans keyboard or mouse) as before. No new
xorg.conf file was generated. Evidently you really can run Intrepid
without an xorg.conf file.)

I did "locate vmlinuz" and it found /vmlinuz
and /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.27-7-generic. There are no other vmlinuz* files
on the machine. 

I ran sudo update-grub, but it made no difference. The menu.lst file is
the same (2.6.27-7) and the menu on screen still shows 2.6.24-19.

Intrepid x86_64 (updated from Hardy) is the only OS installed on the
computer. 

I have a passing familiarity with grub, but this has me flummoxed. The
ghost of 2.6.24-19 refuses to leave. I'm about to call in a priest. Any
suggestions?

Oh, I think the tedium of reinstalling would help reinforce the
undesireability of deleting random files (if I recall your story
correctly) from your machine. ;-)

I have avoided nvidia-based boards because I don't like relying on
disinterested companies providing needed drivers, so I don't really
know what your problem is, but it sounds a lot like you deleted
drivers for the various hardware that stopped working.  If you have a
record of what you deleted (perhaps in your shell history?) or can
remember, and can find the originals somewhere, you might be able to
re-extract the fat from the fire.  Sounds like a lot of fun! ;-)

I'm guessing that you accidentally created a new /boot and installed the
new grub to to your new /boot partition instead of the MBR.

If that is the case, the following should fix your system:

sudo grub-install /dev/sda

WARNING! This will replace the boot loader in your MBR. If you have
multiple operating systems installed, you might not be able to boot the
others without modifying your grub config.

It's not that hard to juggle boot loaders, but I'm too lazy to go into
detail since I doubt you're doing it.

I'm coming into this thread late, so I may have missed some critical
info, but nevertheless this may be worth pointing out:

/boot is generally mouted to a partition of its own.  If /boot is
mounted properly, then when you do an ls -l /boot you are seeing the
contents of that partition.  If you umount /boot and then do an ls -l
/boot, you see stuff under /boot that is on the root filesystem's
partition.  Mounting /boot masks whatever may be in /boot on the root
filesystem.

Try this:

- umount /boot

- touch /boot/helloworld.txt

- ls -l /boot/

       you should see helloworld.txt

- mount /boot

- ls -l /boot/

       you should NOT see helloworld.txt

- umount /boot

- ls -l /boot/

       you should see helloworld.txt again

Agreed.  The knowledge required to do a file-by-file reconstruction of
the system goes well beyond any one person's abilities.  The really
smart linux guru would recognize this immediately, and restore from
backup.

Start over and do a clean install. You can only take so much frustration.

Thanks for the idea. But I still haven't got it fixed.

First, *I* didn't create a new boot, but the Hardy > Intrepid upgrade may have. Is there a way to find out where the MBR is?

Second, the boot partition is a RAID partition (dev/md1). From man grub-install it says 

 INSTALL_DEVICE can be a GRUB device name or a system device filename.

So I did "sudo grub-install /dev/md1." It appeared to work, but when I rebooted I still got only the 2.6.24-19 option.

Here is what the menu.lst file says in the automagic section:

title		Ubuntu 8.10, kernel 2.6.27-7-generic
root		(hd0,0)
kernel	/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.27-7-generic root=/dev/md1 ro quiet splash
initrd	/boot/initrd.img-2.6.27-7-generic

And then there is a recovery mode for the same kernel, followed by memtest86+, and that's all.

When I look at the boot menu during the boot process (hitting esc when the grub menu comes up) I see that the boot option is also set to (hd0,0) and root is dev/md1.

Still confused.

There's your problem. Grub can't boot from a software RAID device. (And
don't get any fancy ideas about RAID 1, that way lies madness if you
have to perform a recovery.)

BTW, if you'd bothered to check wikipedia to find out what an MBR is,
you'd understand that question makes no sense.

Sometimes it is easier to ask..

This net is suppose to be for helping out with problems.

MBR is a well know location on the beginning of the hard drive..

And now for the life of me..  I can't remember how I used to read it..

Ok now it comes back



dd if=/dev/hda of=mbrcontent bs=1 count=512

Then I had to download hexedit to read it....

Anyway

HTH

Message-ID: <1226820469.25204.9.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

There used to be fedora-legacy.  Are there any post release projects
left for fedora?  By post release, I mean updates for say Fedora Core 9
when Fedora Core 10 comes out.  I'm interested in a less bleeding edge
than the latest version of fedora distro without losing compatibility
with fedora.  Just curious.  It seems if you want to update fedora core
1 these days because say you don't know how to get Exult to work on any
other release of fedora that you are out of luck.  One thing I'd like to
see is a fedora-lite project that takes the latest version of Fedora and
streamlines it to work on older hardware.  A k6-2 500 for example or a
Pentium 200 mmx for that matter are pretty low end machines now where
freedos isn't appropriate for say a file server and all the bloat of
current gnome implementations will bring these machines to their knees.
A lot of people say go buy an NAS box, but then what do you do with your
old machines?  I run some older releases of Linux such as Slackware 10
and fedora core 1 on low end servers.  I'd like to replace those systems
with something more up to date which is just as light.  I'd like to see
significant work done on getting Linux distributions as a whole lighter.

The boot loader needs to be loaded into the MBR of the drive that the
BIOS initializes, 99.99% of the time this is the "Primary" hard drive.
Your RAID device is not the device that the BIOS tries to start, in fact
your RAID device is only a virtual device composed of several real
devices.  One of those devices is the device that the motherboard
starts.  Usually this would be /dev/sda unless it is old school and then
it would most likely be /dev/hda.  Notice that neither of these devices
are partitions, so even though GRUB will install on a partition, or a
hard drive, only a hard drive will be given the boot-up signal by the
motherboard.

Try running "sudo grub-install --root-directory=/dev/md1 /dev/sda"
or  "sudo grub-install --root-directory=/dev/md1 /dev/hda"; one of these
should place GRUB in the MBR of the primary hard drive.

Fedora support the current and previous release. So F9 & F10 will both
be supported when F10 comes out in a little more than a week.

BTW, starting with Fedora 7 it isn't called Fedora Core anymore.

sudo grub-install --root-directory=/dev/md1 /dev/sda

gave me an error that /dev/md1 was not a directory. I changed to just /
and the command worked. That is, now I get the proper kernel in the
boot menu, but when I try to boot I get Error 15: File not found. I
tried editing the line on the fly by changing root=/, root=/boot and
root=/dev/md1, but still no joy.

The problem may be that it is a sofware raid that doesn't exist until
some point later in the boot process. But I found other instructions in
the Grub manual suggesting that I should have said /boot instead of
just /. 

Even though it won't boot at all now, I feel this is progress. At least
I managed to change the instructions in the MBR.

There are instructions on the Ubuntu forums for using a live CD to fix
Grub. I'll poke at it some more in the morning.

Does it have a CF slot?  If so, is that working?  (Maybe not, since 
AFAICT it ties into the IDE controller on the motherboard.)

Nope, the T40 doesn't have a CF slot.

Every visit to the inlaws, there is some computer or other that
needs attention.  Usually running XP.  Gag.

This time, the crippled beast is an Emachines 5312 laptop.  There
was a RAM error - I replaced the SIMM.  The hard disk was corrupted -
I replaced that and (forgive me!) reinstalled XP from the restore
disks.  I can still mount the old disk and pull files from it, so
I did not want to write over the user data on it.

And now the laptop ... is ... incredibly ... slow .  30 minutes to
boot.  5 minutes to open IE.  And if you aren't there watching it,
it suspends, requiring 20 minutes to get back to a desktop.  At
least I had a good book to read while tending the machine.

Fortunately, I always carry a few Ubuntu Heron CDs with me.  The
laptop boots Ubuntu Live in the normal amount of time, and runs
applications fine.  I can also dd the NTFS hard drive to /dev/null
at a reasonable rate for a laptop - 20MB/sec - and work fast over
the ethernet.  I have a compelling argument for running Linux on
this machine at least - it would have to be discarded/recycled
otherwise. 

I suspect the fundamental problem is a corrupted BIOS - since Linux
only uses the system BIOS for the first (and second?) stage boot
loaders, it doesn't slow down much if most of the BIOS is corrupted.
AFAIKS, reflashing the (Phoenix) BIOS isn't supported by Emachines,
and third party sites charge $$$$ for the image.  I'm not familiar
with the behavior of boot viruses;  I am told they are rare, but 
my inlaws seem to collect a copy of most other viruses.  It is more
likely that the problem is that Emachines are cheap garbage ...

Anyway, Ubuntu is cheaper. Perhaps the inlaws will like it after using
it for a while.

Now all I have to do is keep my M$-only brother-in-law from attempting
yet another install of XP on it and re-breaking it.

So my immediate need is to figure out the module that the ethernet uses. Lsmod did not reveal anything that sounded like an ethernet module. Of course, that is because it is not loaded. If I knew the name of the module I could poke at it and maybe wake it up.

i upgraded my employer-supplied Dell D620 laptop from Hardy to Intrepid 
two weeks ago - the upgrade went fine, except for networking. i could 
boot from the LiveCD and have access to the net, so i did some digging 
and found that this wasn't an uncommon problem (fwiw, under Hardy i was 
configured for a static ip and had set up a bridge interface on my only 
nic for VirtualBox to use).

a simple apt-get -remove network-manager and then reinstalling it did 
the trick. The new NetworkManager is a bit better, but this glitch cost 
me 2 hours.

i did a clean install of Intrepid on my personal machine (bye-bye- Vista 
partition, WinXP under VirtualBox is just fine). i have a ~1-yr old 
Nvidia card and all is well, although a few upgraded apps seem a tad 
less stable than before. Good luck with your input devices.

Keith,

   Perhaps he'll switch to Vista just to give you something different to fix.

I would love to know what you did to make the display work. That has the 
same ATI Radeon Mobility IGP320 chip my HP laptop has. The video hasn't 
worked since 7.04. I have to use vesa most of the time to get X to start 
at 1024x768 and with no acceleration. The display is native 1400x1050.

Well, it took five different rescue CDs and several hours of my time,
not to mention y'all folks in PLUG-land who had to read my questions,
but I finally did it. The video is still not correct, but I can fix
that later. The important thing is that Intrepid is now booting to the
GUI and the mouse, keyboard and network are all working perfectly.

And for those who are curious about what happened, it seems that the
Hardy > Intrepid upgrade updated the /boot files, but only on sda1, not
on sdb1. I had those two in a RAID1 array as MD1. Even after I used
Derek's hint and got the 2.6.27-7 kernel into the MBR, it could not
find the files it needed to boot.

I finally discovered that the correct files were on sdb1 but not on
sda1 when I tried a Knoppix 5.01 live CD. This version of Knoppix
automatically mounts all devices, except it does not understand RAID,
so it mounted them as individual file systems. Looking at them both
side by side I quickly realized where the 2.6.24-19 kernel was coming
from - sda1. All the boot files on sda1 were the old Hardy files.

Knoppix mounts the partitions read-only and, even as root, I couldn't
seem to change that, so I shuffled through various other rescue CDs
until I found one that would mount both devices and let me read/write
to them. I used the scary command line to delete all the files in
sda1's /boot folder, then copied them over from sdb1's boot folder. On
rebooting (with fingers tightly crossed) Ubuntu Intrepid came up and
all is well again.

Knoppix will mount the partitions any way you tell them to, just like
any linux system.  If you use the fstab file, you'll get what is in
there.  If you bypass the fstab file, you'll get whatever you specify
in your mount command.

This command uses the fstab file:

    mount /dev/hda1

This one does not use fstab:

    mount /dev/hda1 /boot

The difference is that the first one does not specify both device and
mount point.  Therefore mount has to consult fstab to find a match.
If one is found, the options in the fstab line are used.  The second
one specifies both the device and mount point, therefore fstab is not
consulted, and you get default options (unless you specify some on the
command line).

This very same thing once burned me when I tried to mount /boot and
run grub-install while booted from knoppix.  When I mounted using
fstab, I had the same problems you just had.

Next time you are booted into Knoppix, have a peek at the fstab file.
I'll bet you'll see exactly why you were getting hosed.

Knoppix defaults to mounting any partition as READ-ONLY.  Right clicking
on the partition after it's mounted there's an option to change (toggle)
the mount status between READ-WRITE and READ-ONLY.

Thanks to Tim and Carlos for that information. Knoppix generally makes
a good rescue CD, but when I couldn't do it (for lack of knowing how) I
just used some of my other rescue CDs. One of my favorites is GRML, but
it could mount only sda1. Try as I might I could not get it to mount
sdb1. Might have had something to do with the fact that they are parts
of a RAID1 array. Eventually I succeeded with the Emergency and Cool
Linux CD (Gentoo based). 

Now I have to go post what happened and how I finally fixed it on the
Ubuntu forums. Perhaps I should file a bug report too. The upgrade to
Hardy worked fine, but something is seriously wrong with Intrepid when
it updates Grub on only one side of a RAID1 array.

I'm of two minds - the FreeGeek Store will be open that day, allowing
important gifts to be bought.  On the other hand, that will result in
a lot of transient appearances, possibly by people wanting to do their
christmas shopping sans cash.

Given that some of our neediest/helpingist/loneliest people are still
likely to show up, I say go for it - with the proviso that I might be
in Maryland AGAIN.  Typically, though, I like to travel on Christmas
day - the planes are relatively empty, the fares are cheap, and 
atheist pilots might be more careful, if less inspired.  So I can 
plan on being at the Clinic for once.

This has gone unanswered for a while. ReactOS is an interesting concept, but it is still too buggy to diagnose problems easily: you're apparently supposed to be thankful for whatever functionality you have. Perhaps you should subscribe to their forum to solve such problems.

CentOS to CentOS works no problemo for ftp.  It's when I try ReactOS 
0.3.7 running under vmware workstation 6 that there's a problem.  I keep 
getting a 421 error and then a message that the server has 
disconnected.  It may be the fault of ReactOS's ftp.exe program which I 
figured would be fixed by svn 37350.

I have tried both bridged networking and nat networking.  I unloaded the 
firewall on the host and even tried loading ip_conntrack_ftp.

Thunderbird sort of works in ReactOS.  The icons get screwed up, but 
besides that it works fine.  I'm using thunderbird under ReactOS 0.3.7 
to type this email.

Once upon a time using the loki demo I played simcity on a Redhat 9

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0811190618270.28306@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Firefox gets flaky now and then and becomes distracting and annoying in
its misbehavior. Two issues that I cannot resolve and for which I ask for
your thoughts.

   1.) Since the upgrade to 2.0.0.18 many web pages display a bar at the top
telling me I need more plugins to see all the wonderful eye-candy the page
creator threw in. I fell for this the first time or two and it turns out the
missing plugin is the flash player. But, that's already installed in the
correct version for this firefox release. Where do I go to turn off this
annoying message that moves the page display down to show me the bar? The
display won't stay away when I close it, but repeats like oninons on a bad
hamburger.

   2.) There is a recipe page that I try to print to a file, but only the top
portion of the web page actually makes it to the PostScript file. The file
is 4 pages long, but the first, third, and fourth pages are blank. I've not
had this happen with any other web page, and it's been happening with the
current and past versions of firefox. I've no idea why it is messed up, nor
do I have a clue what, if anything, can be done. Do you?

The CentOS 5 libxml2-devel package includes xml2-config, which is the 
next revision of xml-config. You might need to alter the configure 
script or put a xml-config -> xml2-config symlink in your filesystem.

Does your friend ahve the ability/budget to write a custom cart within
the website?  If so, paypal is always an easy option.

If not, Google Cart is used by some big players, like Sierra Trading
Post.

If a custom cart is desired, but expertise is needed to create it, I
am always available.  Gotta put a plug (no pun intended) in there
whenever the opportunity presents itself.

Try using the "forcedeth" driver.

modprobe forcedeth

What kernel version are you using?

Actually, the only time I deleted files was several years ago when I
deleted my /bin folder. Recently, however, I took ownership of /usr as
jjj, which caused problems. Hey, nobody ever told me not to!

I wish you had asked that question several days ago, because the
problem turned out to be exactly that - using the wrong kernel. I
figured it out eventually, but it took several hours of poking around
before I discovered what happened and even longer to figure out how to
fix it.

With Hardy I was using 2.6.24-19-generic. The upgrade to Intrepid
installed 2.6.27-7-generic. Intrepid also installed new drivers and
stuff that required the 2.6.27-7 kernel. By chance I stumbled upon the
fact that my broken Intrepid was using 2.6.24-19.

Then I spent a few hours trying to figure out why I was booting to
2.6.24-19. I tried reinstalling Grub to no avail. Eventually Derek here
suggested adding "--root-directory=/dev/md1 /dev/sda" to the
grub-install command. That got the boot menu to offer 2.6.27-7, but
then I got Error 15 - unable to locate boot files. A couple more hours
of poking around and I discovered that my RAID1 array had not been
updated correctly by the Intrepid dist-upgrade process. There are two
disks in the array and one had been updated but the other still had
the Hardy boot stuff. You can't do grub-install to a RAID array; the
only option is to do it to the MBR on the individual disks. The one
that I had grub-install'ed was the one with the Hardy files. so Grub
couldn't find the 2.6.27-7 kernel. So I fixed matters by using rescue
CDs to mount both disks individually and then deleted all the /boot
files from the one that had the Hardy files on it, followed by copying
the files from the good disk so they would match. (There's probably a
slicker way to do this with mdadm, but I knew I could do it just as
effectively with a rescue CD.)

Once I got the /boot folders on both disks the same I could boot to
2.6.27-7-generic. And when Intrepid came up all my problems were
resolved - the keyboard worked, the mouse worked, and the ethernet
worked. It took a couple more minutes to install the new nvidia-177
driver and set the resolution correctly, and all was back to normal.

It was an interesting trip, though, and I learned a lot. Per aspera ad
astra.

This is my output from ntpq -p...

But, delay and offset are both 0.000  I am guessing this is just dummy
out and it really didn't do anything..  I am not on line all the time..

Do I need to force it..

TIA

Since FF2 is going to be going to be out of support soon. Should 
probably put your time into getting FF3 working.

   Pat has that version in Slackware-current. Eventually it will make it to
the default version.

The .INIT. means that it hasn't yet established a connection. You can 
try restarting ntpd. If that fails, you might want to make sure that 
firewall rules on your end of things are blocking blocking port 123.

I'm guessing you need to force it since you don't have a persistent
connection (if it hasn't sync'd since you posted).

Here are two things to check first...

(1) make certain ntpd is running
    on CentOS, `service ntpd status'
(2) the logs
    on CentOS, `grep ntp /var/log/messages'

ymmv, depending on your distro.

You can force a sync with `ntpdate <server_name>'.

hth,
Sandy

- You cannot run ntpdate while ntpd is running.  You must stop ntpd,
   run ntpdate, and start ntpd.

- ntpd will not set the clock if it too far askew.  It is imperative
   to use ntpdate to get the clock set correctly before starting ntpd.
   Gentoo handles this by having two init scripts - one to run ntpdate,
   and another to start ntpd.  You could easily create your own ntpdate
   initscript, and schedule it to run before ntpd (but after the
   network is up).

- You should make sure your hardware clock is correct by ensuring that
   the motherboard battery isn't dead, and by using hwclock to set it
   (once you have used ntpdate to set the software clock correctly, of
   course).  Then when you boot your box you might stand some chance of
   getting a reasonably accurate time, one that is close enough for
   ntpd to use.

I hope one of the things learned is that software-raid is a royal pain
in the ass with relatively little benefit.  If you *need* raid, do it
in hardware so the OS doesn't get this sort of option to muck things
up.

Hard disks just don't fail that dramatically, that often.  (If you
have corruption, that corruption will just be mirrored to the other
drive unless you happen to notice *and* prevent the mirroring in
time.)

Do you know what to do to make use of your raid? (How will you know
when you need to do something? What are you *gaining* by having that
raid?)

Not entirely true; you just have to use the '-u' option w/ntpdate.

Also not entirely true. The -g option to ntpd will allow it to set the
clock without skew limitations, but only once.

For some reason, the ntp.org ntpd developers want to retire the ntpdate
program, so the current recommendation is to run ntpd in one-shot mode:
'ntpd -gq'.

wow, i totally disagree.  i use software raid to great success in many
situations, and have had no trouble evicting dead disks and inserting
new disks.  i guess i don't "need" raid anywhere i use software
raid--i could just be without computer for awhile.  but in my two
sub-$400 home computers, adding a raid card (not even possible, since
neither have spare slots, both being small-form-factor) would add
significant expense.  in my work computer, well, they aren't buying
and neither am i paying for hardware to use at the office.

furthermore, i've had some nightmares with hardware raid--take for
example the PERC cards in dell servers.  the only reasonable way to
monitor them remotely when using non-redhat/suse pay distros is to
hackishly install tools not intended for debian, etc, and write a
script to poll that software (which is poorly documented at best and
was quite a pain to track down--go ahead, see if you can find the
latest version of MegaCLI from an official download site).  and the
best part?  i came onboard at my current company post-install on one
of these servers where the installer and installed kernel (ubuntu
7.something i think--since been upgraded and fixed) saw the hardware
raid as 3 separate disks--sda, sdb, sdc.  sdc happened to be the
raid-1 mirror of sda and sdb.  whoever did the install didn't notice,
and assumed the install and the OS were using the mirror, when
actually, it was constantly *corrupting* the mirror by writing to the
individual device rather than the virtual mirror.  imagine the
hilarity when i installed a new kernel, rebooted, and got the old
kernel.  lather, rinse, repeat, and eventually i managed to corrupt
both disks by finally writing to /dev/sdc with grub.  yay!  i'll grant
you there was user error combined with software error there (newer
kernels do not expose the two individual disks), but it cost me a
sleepless night spent at the data center and 8 months worth of
webserver statistics (which are now being backed up..)

hmm, i've had 2 disks fail in the 8 or so s/w raids i've setup.  these
are consumer-level disks, not server level, but i'm going with my
personal observed statistics.

i gain some peace of mind and instant automatic recovery without

Hardware RAID is usually hard to manage and monitor, even if there are 
would-be drivers for Redhat, CentOS, et al. I nearly always choose software 
RAID for deployments.

I'd much rather have Nagios warn me of a disk going bad, so we can fix it 
before I come in to find out that the answer to "why's the server not 
talking any more?" is because that one too many of those informative little 
LEDs I can't see from 4 miles away has gone red.

Now back to figuring out how to disable the XO@#! hardware RAID in an IBM 
x8350, so I can JBOD the disks into a software RAID...

Subject: [PLUG] Routing Question
Message-ID: <6.2.1.2.2.20081120132809.044e0eb0@landongxi>

We have an OpenVPN server at a colo, with each site connecting via DSL. One 
of our site routers (call it "X") is multihomed, and connects to two 
different DSL modems. One DSL is supposedly dedicated to our OpenVPN 
connection (and any other ancillary traffic to the same IP range as the 
OpenVPN server external address), and one to all other traffic. But there's 
some routing weirdness in how I've (apparently incorrectly) implemented it.

         Routing from X to the colo, whether VPN or no, works.
         Routing from X to other outside addresses works.
         Routing from a machine behind X to the colo via the VPN works.
         Routing from a machine behind X to the colo, NOT on VPN fails.
                 (i.e., to the other public IP addresses there)
         Routing from a machine behind X to anything elsewhere
                 (i.e., on the other path) works

Three letters: N. A. T.

I didn't see enough information to know for sure, but NAT combined
with multihoming can make things like TCP connections get very
confused.

   We'll see. I guess that this weekend I really should devote time to
upgrading my main server/workstation. I've put it off because Xfce has made
major changes that require hand tuning to restore to the form I want. Sigh.
Oh, well. Time to bite the bullet and do it.

Thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] WRT54GL on sale at Fry's
Message-ID: <20081121182109.GA26028@gate.kl-ic.com>


No doubt reacting to Russell's splendid talk about OpenWRT at the
Advanced Topics meeting, Fry's has a sale on the Linksys WRT54GL
B/G Access point for $49.99 ( SKU 4703979 ), advertised in the
Friday Oregonian as a "Linux Router".

This is the version of the Linksys that is easily re-flashed with
OpenWRT and other flash-optimized Linux distros.  

I suggest replacing the wall wart power supply that comes with
12V/1A Linksys units with a more efficient and trustworthy 
switching power supply.  If your wall power is not rock solid
(a furnace or refrigerator motor startup can sag the voltage)
then you may brick one of these units while flashing it. 

One possible replacement is the $9.95 Netgate PS-15V-1.25A-18W :

http://www.netgate.com/product_info.php?cPath=24_55&products_id=666

This unit produces 15V - the Linksys will do fine with up to 20V
or so.  It will ride out temporary wall power upsets better than
"dumb" wall warts.  It would be nice if a retailer carried these
locally.

Keith, are you sure this is necessary?  The last WRT54GL I bought had a 
wall wart that was significantly different in appearance compared to 
earlier versions.  I suspect the new adapter is a switching power 
supply, probably due to new CA regulation requiring higher efficiency. 
Of course that doesn't mean the new adapter will be any better at 
handling line dropouts.

Wonderful news!  If they are switchers, I imagine they have enough
capacitor storage to ride out a cycle or two of line sag, otherwise
the efficiency would suffer.  The old transformer bricks were marginal
anyway.

In any case, it should be easy enough to tell by weighing the wall
wart in your hand.  Transformer iron is HEAVY.  I wonder how much
Linksys saves on shipping costs, if nothing else?  With the price
of metal rising, and slack demand lowering the price of some 
electronics, I wonder if the total cost of a switcher has dropped
below the cost of a dumb transformer unit yet?

Subject: [PLUG] Airlink USB Wireless Adapter AWLL3055 works
Message-ID: <20081122174438.GA29839@gate.kl-ic.com>


On Friday Nov 21 2008, Fry's least expensive 802.11a/b/g adapter
was the Airlink AWLL3055, "802.11G USB Adapter with +10dBi Antenna",
costing $19.90 (they may sometimes have cheaper devices, but they
were out of stock).  I bought one, to see what kind of grief we
can expect at the next clinic.  Not much from this one, it turns out.

The 3055 is not small, because it is built with a 10dB patch
antenna and has a 6 foot USB cable on it.  The whole package is
2x4x3 inches or so .  The antenna increases the range considerably.
I get "4 bars" to my access point 30 feet and two walls away.  
It claims to be 40mW (16dBm) on the box.  No FCC ID (!!).

The higher gain antenna means that you are not spraying RF in all
directions.  That increases security by reducing eavesdropping,
reduces multipath interference, and is also more neighborly,
though you need to know where the access point is.

The USB2 connection means less interface incompatability - this
should work with most 5 year or younger machines, getting around
the paucity of CardExpress incompatabilities, for example.  And
because it unplugs quickly from a laptop, it provides "air gap"
security - yank it out and you are isolated.  I don't trust
builtin Wifi, mediated by potentially vulnerable software, to 
always tell the truth about being disconnected.

The Airlink contains a ZyDas zd1211b chip, USBID 0ace:1215, which
is moderately well supported by the Linux ZD1211 driver.  It doesn't
report link quality, but the adapter is otherwise plug-and-play in
Hardy Heron, and works with my older RHEL 5 distro.

At the clinic, we keep encountering wireless cards with unsupported
chipsets, often purchased cheap at Frys.  For the next few months,
on of the cheapest adapters you can buy may be one of the better ones.
Please don't buy unsupported wireless gear.

Does it have kernel WPA support (I'm guessing this means mac80211)?
I've been struggling with that one.  I should probably start a new
helpme! thread on this subject.  wpa_supplicant has been a nightmare,
at least with my atheros 52xx built-in wireless.  It keeps dropping
the connection, and signal strength is in the toilet.

I have been poking around the 2.6.25.19 kernel source looking for
mac80211 support in various wifi drivers.  Correct me if I'm wrong -
the orinoco_cs card has no such support, right?

Subject: [PLUG] MD RAID and DBUS issue...
Message-ID: <0016364c5a638f5df6045c540867@google.com>

I just recently installed a 3-disk RAID5 array in a server of mine, running  
FC9. Upon reboot, occasionally one of the drives drops out, and is  
allocated as a spare. I suspect there is some sort of issue where DBUS  
re-arranges the drive-to-device maps between boots, but I am not sure...  
Just kind of annoying to have to stop and re-add a drive every boot, and  
wait the couple hours for the array to rebuild the 3rd disk. Any thoughts?  
Anyone else encountered such an issue before? What should I be looking for?  
I'm new to the world of RAID, so any information you can give may be  
helpful.

Regards,
-Eitan-

That probably depends on the driver - I recall seeing the verbiage
that implies that it is there.   Perhaps you can come to the clinic
and experiment with the Zydas cards, and see if the WPA feature 
works correctly.

I just finished looking for an open-source shopping cart.  The most 
interesting ones I found were Magento (http://www.magentocommerce.com), 
Ubercart (http://www.ubercart.org), and Satchmo 
(http://www.satchmoproject.com).  Magento is in PHP and XML and is OSL 
(http://www.opensource.org/licenses/osl-3.0.php).  Ubercart (which is a 
Drupal module) is in PHP and is GPL.  Satchmo (which is a Django 
application) is in Python and is Modified BSD 
(http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php).

Magento seems to be the most powerful and can even give some of the 
major commercial carts a run for their money, but customization is 
likely to be expensive.  Ubercart and Satchmo are designed to be highly 
flexible and seem well-suited to small sites.  All three are somewhat 
difficult to install and would probably require a developer.  The 
mid-range is currently dominated by osCommerce 
(http://www.oscommerce.org) and various offshoots such as Zen Cart 
(http://www.zencart.com) and osCMax (http://www.oscmax.com); they're 
easy to install and maintain (no developer needed), but difficult to 
customize.  As Magento becomes more user-friendly and Ubercart and 
Satchmo become more powerful, they'll probably squeeze out the middle.

These are just my impressions from reading websites and reviews; I 
didn't look at the code.

We are still discussing that - we have the space for Sunday
December 21, and I'm in favor of having a clinic that day.  The
FreeGeek Store will be open, which may mean we've got to "watch our
stuff" more closely.  But if it this a chance to meet some of our
more distant friends, then I'm even more eager to do the clinic.

Remember this coco 2 game?  Well, I found a Linux port and tried it 
out.  It uses SDL.  It seems a bit harder than I remember it being on 
the coco, I'm wondering if the port has some changes from the original.

Finally survived the first level only to be wiped out by a knight on the 
second.  Typing seems a bit slow, that's my only real complaint.

It would be nice if I could get the original coco version in a dsk image 
that I can load into drivewire to play on my actual color computer.  The 
whole game is only 8k.

There is a windows port as well, apparently that came first.

The other classic I miss is Downland, a coco 2 game that had problems 
running on the coco 3.  I don't
know if anyone has ported it to the PC let alone Linux.

Out of curiosity, what would a 6809 redesigned to run at say 2.4 Ghz 
with additional 16 bit sound hardware built in be like to work with?  
I've heard a lot of talk that PC machine language is just plain gross

modern PC.  There
is talk from some coco enthusiasts of a COCO 4, but I doubt that will 
ever happen.  At least it won't
happen until the hardware gets old enough.  The coco3 had disk basic, 
what would a modern coco
look like?  I suppose memory protection would have to be considered and 
the ability to access data using more than 8 bits, although a 
compatability mode would make sense.  I think the Coco 3 was the first 
coco in the coco line to have compatability issues.  For one thing, 
every pmode 4 game you play on an RGB monitor on a COCO 3 is in black 
and white.  I guess what would be most interesting is taking the best of 
all the computers that were popular in 1980 and making a modern 
variant.  Imagine a COCO 4 having the sprite technology of the Commodore 64.

Michael 

I did some assembly level development on the 6809.
Rumor is that we ended up with 8086's in the PC because Intel lied to IBM
about their then capacity to supply chips.
The assembly language was very nicely formed as are most Motorola
instruction sets.
What is SDL??

Being in Portland on the 21st is a possibility.  It gives me a reason
to take the entire week of the 21st off from work.  I could call it
"professional development".  Perhaps if there are any skiers among
you, I might enjoy your company on Mount Hood earlier in the day.
Tele-ho!

And of course there's my WPA situation to consider.

That's interesting. The version of the rumor that I heard was a little
different. What I heard was that IBM went to Motorola and asked for a good
deal on their processors. Motorola responded, "Why should we give you a
deal?"

Then they went to Intel, which responded, "Sure, how many do you want?"

This leaves plenty of room for people to do things like lie about how many
they can supply. I'm sure the actual correspondence would be very
interesting to see today.

And the rest is history.

Carlos,

   Are you a telemark skier? I skied down Galena Pass into the Stanley Basin
one winter in the late 1970s. Haven't done it since I left Idaho in the late
1980s.

I sure am.  I ski in that area all the time.  It would have been neat
to see you back then in your vintage backcountry gear.

And that reminds me.  The access point at Free Geek is, of course,
open, and thus we cannot practice connecting to WPA with that.  
Ideally, if you brought in your own access point and we plugged
it into the wired ethernet at Free Geek, we could try practicing
from your computer to that.  If for some reason that is not 
possible, then please engineer an alternative - bringing a second
access point, or arranging with somebody in Portland to bring a
WPA-capable access point to the clinic.

All my access points are too old to run WPA, IIRC.

A friend of mine living in Saint Helens (town in Columbia County,
gateway to Goble, not the mountain) expressed interest in making
arrangements for a one-time additional Linux Clinic in a community
center up there.  That is extremely tentative, no time set, and
probably won't happen anyway.  If by some miracle it does, and
the timing works out, is there anybody interested in travelling
up there to help make it happen?

Subject: [PLUG] Program written in R
Message-ID: <20081124110506.2e419c9c.johnxj@comcast.net>

Once a long time ago I attempted to learn programming. I used a
tutorial where the first instruction was to get the program to display
"hello world" on the screen. I failed. I abandoned the effort. 

Today I need to run a program called R-Varb, written in R:

http://ella.slis.indiana.edu/~paolillo/projects/varbrul/rvarb/

I have downloaded the program, which is a .bin file. Supposedly R
programs can be run on any platform. Whether that is true for Hardy
x86_64 is beyond my ken. A ".bin" file smells a lot of Windows. But
what do I know? Until today I had never heard of the R programming
language. 

I do have Windows 2000 running under Virtualbox, so that is a backup
solution. It's just nasty to use Windows if I can get it running in
Linux.

Any suggestions and comments welcome.

I don't see any bin files on that site.  Have you tried the instructions here:

http://ella.slis.indiana.edu/~paolillo/projects/varbrul/rvarb/rvarb.html
 (note the slight differences in the url)

I think this is the file you need to download:

http://ella.slis.indiana.edu/~paolillo/projects/varbrul/rvarb/RVarb_0.2.r

You'll also need to install R (it should be in synaptic).

On Debian-esque systems, try installing the r-base package.

   R is a statistical programming language that has apparently been extended
and applied to many applications other than mathematical statistics. R runs
natively on linux. The parent was the S programming language developed at
AT&T's Bell Labs, and there's a commercial Microsoft-specific version called
S-Plus.

Oh, that is what I already downloaded. The download popup in Firefox
said it is a bin file, but in fact, it does not have the .bin
extension. My bad.

Done. 

Now all I need is to figure out is how R-Varb works. If there are any
Vulcans in here who know statistics, can we do a quick mind-meld?

I have an account with dyndns.com for mailhop outbound. I have configured postfix to use outbound.mailhop.org:2525 as the relayhost. however when I send emails I get:

I can and will attend, as long as it is not on or before December 12
(last final exam). The offer of carpooling is gratefully accepted. I am
in N Portland and could meet at, say, the St. Johns bridge, St. Johns
side where there is parking.

Message-ID: <20081125031420.GA2885@gate.kl-ic.com>


We are entering a time of low employment for technical folk.  I
am a self-employed chip-slinger, so I am spending a lot of time
preparing sales pitches and working on new products to find more
business.  But I wonder what the software people are doing.

So, two questions for those of you that sometime participate in
open source software projects:

If you lost your job, and had time on your hands, would you be
more or less likely to contribute to open source projects?  Do you
see open source as a good advertising method and resume filler, or
do you see it as a distraction from job searches, desperate min-wage
fill-in work, daytime TV, and getting drunk in your trailer?

If you wanted to do more open source in your newly expanded spare
time, what would help you do so?

More likely.  If only because I would have time to do it.

All of the above.  Well, maybe not getting drunk in my trailer.
Actually, during the last downturn when I had time on my hands, I did get
involved in an open source project, but more from a desire to learn a hot
new technology than to flesh out my resume.  But that work, or rather that
learning, did lead to a new contract and about a year's worth of work for me.

Keith,

   This is true for many industries other than computer hardware and
software. The mining industry has been hit very hard, with new mines being
put on care and maintenance with most of the staff let go and head office
staff trimmed. The front-desk staff at my local gym have had their hours cut
to almost nothing, and they cannot live on the meager pay they now get.

   It's unhappy times for almost everyone. And all of us self-employed types
are focused on new markets, new products or services, and finding those who
still have the need and means to buy them.

This might be in January or later.  First, the guy (named Guy, btw)

Gang,

I recently found out that there is support for generating bootable
"persistent" Ubuntu USB media.
There is a good write-up on how to do it at http://www.pendrivelinux.com/
under 
"Ubuntu 8.10 built in USB flash drive installer"

There are also instructions on how to create USB bootable media for other
distributions of Linux.

With enough advanced notice and barring overriding family
considerations, I'm willing to participate.  There was once a PTP node
in St Helens that I intended to check out a couple years ago as part
of our node audit (to see who is up/down, offer assistance, etc), but
never made it up there.

Despite it being a "binary" file, it nevertheless loads with the

saved it with my browser and loaded it with the full pathname, thusly:

I don't know R-Varb, but I do have some familiarity with R.  I suggest
reading that html and letting us/me know what you want/need to do.
Some thumbnail sketch of wtf VARBRUL is might help as well, though I
guess this could serve as an introduction:

You probably need to include the math library ( -lm ) in the link 
arguments.

Greetings,

I am trying to write a small app that will update a database remotely using a barcode scanner and some keyboard input. I am building a client-server app that will be on Linux both as the client and want it to run via a web interface.

Anyone know of a good site with info on how to accomplish this? It doesn't seem like it would be all that hard to do.

Thanks in advance,

If you're using a web interface, why bother with creating a client?

Hi Ron,

Are you talking about using the browser as the interface or simply 
communicating via a web API (e.g. RESTful/etc)?  If the client is 
any-old-browser, I think you're going to have a hard time treating the 
barcode scanner as anything other than "the keyboard" (that is, the 
correct field would have to have keyboard focus when the barcode is 
scanned.)  For something which specifically handles the scanner input, 
you need to be able to claim the input device away from the kernel/X.

A straightforward form application in wxPerl would be a pretty trivial 
client where you could attach to the barcode scanner via libusb.

  http://search.cpan.org/dist/Linux-USBKeyboard/

That also includes a sample wxWidgets application meant for a ten-key 
pad, but another sort of select loop might be more appropriate for 
barcode-only input.

Whenever I write software, the goal is to streamline business
processes.  This results in savings.  Usually these savings can be
realized in well under a year.  I use this as the main selling point
with clients.  I may start by writing a website, but it doesn't take
long before I notice the way they enter the same data into 3 different
systems, all manually, with no checks for consistency.  For every
application I've written that has a user interface, I've written a
dozen jobs that are invisible, with the purpose to tie two disparate
systems together, usually to perform automatic data migration.  In
fact, most of the visible apps I've written fulfill similar purposes.
Upload a csv file, push a button, done!

If I lost my job, I would certainly work on open source projects more.
I always want to; but I rarely have time.  I want to contribute to
those projects which I have used heavily in my professional work, like
JDEE and slime.  I wish I could be a steady contributor in the gentoo
lisp herd.

The #1 factor in failing to devote myself entirely to open source work
is money.  If I were to win the lottery, I would immediately start an
open souce campaign (and quit my job, of course).

Although my wish to work on the above mentioned projects comes from a
desire to give back to a community that has given so much to me, I
have to admit that working on certain projects can really help a
resume when looking for certain jobs.  But I don't want to work for an
employer in a typical corporate environment any more, so that's not a
big motivator.  (There are rare exceptions; I have had one or two
really great bosses.  Their greatness compared against the average
middle manager proves the rule.)  There are relatively few employers
who would even take notice of open souce project participation.  These
employers would be more intrigued by Oracle experience or J2EE
certification.  But those jobs where it would count are the best jobs.

There are probably a lot of different answers to this question.  My
answer is to never use the default apache DocumentRoot directly.
Instead, I always make VirtualHost directives that point to
DocumentRoots that lie deeper than /var/www.  For instance, here is my
"default" web location on my workstation:

<VirtualHost *:80>
     ServerName sphinktoo.pippiandcarlos.com
     ServerAdmin ckonstanski at pippiandcarlos.com
     DocumentRoot "/var/www/html/site/sphinktoo.pippiandcarlos.com"
     <Directory "/var/www/html/site/sphinktoo.pippiandcarlos.com">
         Options Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI
         AllowOverride Limit
         Allow from all
         Order allow,deny
     </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

In gentoo, you get /var/www/html for free.  I built the rest of the
path.  /var/www/html is still owned by root on my system.  So is
/var/www/html/site.  (There is a /var/www/html/users that gentoo
provided for UserDir, but I have that disabled.  I created the site/
directory so that this directory level would remain uncluttered.)
/var/www/html/site/sphinktoo.pippiandcarlos.com is the first directory
in this tree that is owned by a normal user.

I like this aproach because you might want to put other things in
/var/www/html (or the equivalent on your system), like a cgi-bin
directory, a webdav permissions directory, or a subversion repo.  I
would keep this from being browseable.

There are a couple different reasons why I'd wholeheartedly agree with 
Carlos' advice:

1. setting up virtual hosts from the get-go means that you can have
    a staging or testing server to which to push changes before they
    go live.

2. if you want to cut down on a *lot* of mischievous web traffic
    -- assuming this web server is addressable via the Internet,
    which might not be the case -- set the default (first)
    virtualhost to deny all traffic. that way IP-based scanners
    won't plague your site, only name-based HTTP 1.1 requests will
    get through.

3. setting up virtual hosts with DocumentRoot directives pointing
    to directories that are not maintained by the packaging system,
    allows you to set permissions you know a package will never
    overwrite. my new favorite is in /srv, which is the LSB-blessed
    location for "site-specific data which is served by the system."

Does that replace the <VirtualHost *> in /etc/apache2/sites-available, 
or is it added to that file?

You're the one!

Honestly though, I don't know why use of /srv hasn't taken off [1],
given how overloaded /var is.

[1] At least in the straw poll of people to whom I talk.

I'm not familiar with ubuntu, so I can't say for sure what their
default VirtualHosts entry looks like.  But I'd guess that you want to
replace it with one like my example.  For the example I gave is my
"default" VirtualHost; I have many others on my machine, but this is
the one that answers to the "raw" hostname of my box (or "localhost",
for that matter).

OK.

(I'm also trying to merge the information from other responses to see 
what ultimately makes sense for my situation.)

Thanks for the ideas.

Currntly downloading all versions for the Clinic USB drive. Sadly, Ktorrent says the x86_64 DVD will take roughly 62 years to finish. :(  The others will be done within the day, however.

Hmm interesting.  I already finished downloading i686 LiveCD, and the x86_64
DVD torrent is downloading nicely, be done in less than half an hour, total
time about 4.5 hours.  I'm using Azureus.  Perhaps you want to re-update the
tracker or something, or maybe just give it more time it will even out.
I'm showing about 700 seeds and 2400 peers in the x86_64 DVD swarm.

Very interesting, indeed.

It did pick up and I now have someone in China who is feeding me,
albeit slowly. Ktorrent says it is now down to only five days. I was
starting to plan for how I was going to last 62 years to get it all. :)

More interesting is that I currently show only ten seeders. The tracker
is http://torrent/fedoraproject.org:696/announce. How can you show 700
seeders and I see only ten? I mean, if Ktorrent is that bad, surely
someone would have kvetched loudly long before now. Maybe there is a
setting I need to tweak in Ktorrent?

Wait, when I look at the Trackers window it does show 732 seeders. It's
in the Peers window where I see only ten. Hmmm.

Yeah, "bittorrent" gave me similar dire predictions of ETA. Maybe  
Comcast is playing games again. I went to  
http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/10/ and grabbed things  
with wget. :)

I've got it downloaded and running in a 32-bit VMware (WS 6.5) virtual  
machine. So far I'm not terribly impressed, although I don't know how  
many of the issues are VMware-related and how many are Fedora. I've  
also got openSUSE 11.1 Beta 5 running on my laptop, and aside from  
some kind of Synaptics TouchPad configuration issue I haven't had time  
to troubleshoot, it's stable and does everything I want. The touchpad  
runs fine as "just a mouse", but it doesn't do the Synaptics  
"extensions" right. So I think I'm going to pass on Fedora 10 and stay  
with openSUSE 11.x on the laptop, and stay with Gentoo on the desktop.

When "Lenny" goes stable, that might change. Aside from the rather  
bizarre way Debian handles Ruby packaging (called "broken", "FUBAR",  
etc. by many in the Ruby community), I don't see any reason not to run  
Debian on "all" of my machines.

Note that I am talking about *available* seeds and *available* peers, not
how many I'm actually connected to.
I don't have that big of a pipe ;)

Well if you like SuSE and Gentoo and Debian more power to ya.

I think though to be fair and give Fedora an honest evaluation on *your*
actual hardware you should give it a go with a LiveCD (or Live USB) instead
of just running it in VMWare and giving up on it.

Care to elaborate on what didn't impress you with Fedora, that you see
present in OpenSuSE or Gentoo?

Note I am a Fedora Ambassador so I may be a little biased, but I have used
and continue to use other distros (Ubuntu and Debian, along with Fedora,
currently).  I've been a RedHat/Fedora user a lot longer than Ambassador
though.

OK, that's what I don't understand. I see 732 presumably available, but
in the peers window I see only ten or a dozen. Assuming I understand
what you are saying, the ten or a dozen are the ones I am connected to.
But I have cable and pretty decent bandwith, yet Ktorrent says my
overall download speed from all ten or a dozen is only 50-60 KB/s. Why
am I not getting a feed from the others up to the amount of bandwidth I
have available?

I've been using it since the beta, my wireless card needs the newer
kernel and my basic laziness wins over compiling my own. Tried to get
the card going in Ubuntu 8.04 and even with NDIS wrapper I couldn't
get it to work. I'm fairly sure it works in 8.10, I just got settled
with this install and have low motivation to go futzing with it now
that it works.

I got the .iso from the OSU site in about 4 hours, the torrent that
going is working on 12 hours and less than 85%. I'm leaving it going
mostly to seed.

It's mostly that there don't seem to be *more* packages in Fedora 10 
than there are in OpenSuSE 11.0 / 11.1. The short history is that I have 
two machines, a 4 GB Athlon64 X2 desktop running Gentoo and an ancient 
Compaq Presario dual-booted XP and some random version of Linux. The 
laptop used to be Gentoo, but I left it powered off for a couple of 
months and by the time I brought it back up, I was looking at days of 
compiles in a 512 MB 1.6 GHz machine to make it current.

So I started testing binary distros on it. First Etch and then I settled 
on Fedora 9. It ran Fedora 9 for a while, but I had some problems with 
LCD projectors and my wireless USB gizmo didn't work. When openSUSE 11.0 
came out, I tried it, and the wireless worked out of the box. So the 
laptop was on openSUSE 11.0 until 11.1 beta 4 came out, at which point I 
switched. It's stable and I don't plan to change it until at least 
mid-December.

The desktop is still on Gentoo, but I am strongly considering moving it 
to a binary distro as well. Again, nothing is going to happen until 
mid-December, but in the end I will probably rebuild both the laptop and 
the desktop to the same OS, either openSUSE 11.1 or Debian Lenny. Ubuntu 
is not a candidate.

I used to be a Gentoo advocate, as most of the denizens of this list 
know. There's nothing wrong with Gentoo once you get it all set up, but 
they've let their release engineering process essentially collapse, so 
the installer is just as bad as it was a year ago, they cancelled 2008.1 
and the 2008.0 LiveCD didn't even boot on my laptop.

My Gentoo desktop is about as solid as you can expect for someone who 
runs "testing" level with a couple of overlays. But there's a lot of 
software out there that's not in Portage but is in Debian. And having 
two different distros on the desktop and the laptop isn't an ideal way 
to live. So I am guessing when all is said and done, both machines will 
be running Lenny, with R and Ruby built from source rather than from the 
  Debian packages.

That worked...  but there's a new problem trying to configure loki_setup
to compile it...

checking for libglade-config...

I yum searched for the package that provides libglade-config
and didn't get an answer back.  I am on a CentOS 5 system.

More likely, mostly because there is very little chance of getting a new

/srv is well populated on the machines I maintain:

   /srv/svn -- Subversion repos
   /srv/git -- Git repos
   /srv/trac -- Trac instances
   /srv/www -- virtual hosts

Etc.

Plus, you can back up /srv as a whole, while /var needs to be 
dissected for what should (lib) and shouldn't (tmp, lock, run) be 
backed up.

i believe it is failing to find scp on the remote host.  ssh/scp
(sometimes, at least) do some tricks with calling themselves on the
remote side after sshd accepts the connection.

Michael,

   Perhaps not.

   Wouldn't this be the same scp regardless of which remote server you're
accessing?

   If you provide the fully-qualified domain name to the transfer from
server-b do you still see the same error?

You are onto something.  There is a great opportunity here.   How many
of you would be willing to trade coding labor for doctor labor?  How
many of you would be willing to re-educate yourselves,  replacing bad
health ideas with good ones, in return for helping doctors replace
bad I.T. ideas with good ones, and use automation and the Internet to
multiply medical effectiveness?

Start with the amazing (but true) idea that 90% of your health outcomes
are dependent on your own efforts, independent of medical procedures.  
There are some powerful interests that are infantilizing you, filling
you with fear (and junk food and physical passivity) while fostering an
unhealthy dependency on professional-provided services.  Kinda like the
way M$ and others spread the FUD that individuals can't do software,
only big companies can.  

In both cases, individuals are disempowered.  The solution in both cases
is individual re-empowerment.  Health care is easier.  It is easier to
learn good health habits than learn to write world class software.  It
is easier to help a sick friend than to de-virus a computer.  In most
cases, bad computer outcomes can be minimized through user training
and proper programming.  The same is true with health.

Doctors aren't completely unnecessary, but most of what they can do for
you is diagnostic ("stop worrying, it's XXX, and you will heal naturally
in a week or two") and patient training ("Twinkies are not health
food").  The latter is difficult - Hostess spends billions training us
to eat Twinkies - but we own the Internet, and we can use it for our
own training.  A lot of the training is outside the talent set of INTJ
borderline-Asperger technologists, but there are a lot of non-techies
available to help.  The really good news is that most of the solution
is informational, and we are really good at slinging information.

Let's talk specifics.  There are a lot of really bad clinical
infosystems - so bad that they kill people and drive clinics out of
business.  The coders that wrote them may mean well (or not), but they
arrogantly assume that 100+ years of medical practice developed by some
really smart and talented people can be replaced by a few fill-in forms,
and that the subject matter of medicine ( the incredibly complex human
body ) can be reduced to a few simple algorithms.  It's like expecting
to find the complete schematic of an Intel processor on a postit note.  

But not all infosystems are like that - the Veteran Administration's
"VistA" software is an example of a fairly successful evolving system
constructed on open source principles, a collaboration between doctors
and coders.  While there is a closed source fake derivative called
"Open Vista", the real open effort is "World VistA", which is being
developed mostly overseas (with a few coders in the US).  VistA is
written in the "M" language, and VistA needs to be re-written in more
commonly used languages.  VistA needs small clinic capabilities.  It
needs better HIPAA compliance.  It needs better patient communication. 
But it is a great start. 

Somebody is going to figure out how to exchange coding effort on World
VistA for doctor services.  In economic downturns, doctors struggle for
money, too.  Perhaps there are some open-source projects out there that
demonstrate a way to structure these exchanges, so that both doctors
and coders can help each other outside of institutions and without a
lot of money shuffling.

No, such exchanges won't pay for a pacemaker, but they might lead to
less need for pacemakers.  And if we can design and build open source
graphics cards, why not pacemakers, someday?

Most importantly, the entire medical process can be refocused on
teaching individuals to maintain their own health, make their own
informed decisions regards procedures, etc.  There is a huge
opportunity for open source software here, working in collaboration
with individual doctors and scientists (and educators and marketers
and exercise trainers and ... ) to build the software systems that
we can use to reprogram our mental systems and escape the cycle of
fear and helplessness that train us to damage ourselves.  That 
damage is only partially fixable by expensive medical procedures -
it is better to avoid it.

And guess what?  Developing these systems will make us excellently
prepared for great vocations in the future.  More importantly, it
will help free all people from dependence on employer/government
provided medical insurance, and from most of the diseases that we
fear, the fear which drives us to that dependence.  Competent and
expensive medical care will still be needed in some situations, but
open source software can help us make those situations a lot rarer.  

Saving your life, saving the world, and maybe getting rich.  Not
a bad way to spend your unemployed time.

Well ... I can come up with a whole list of cynical reasons why this  
can't possibly work, so it must be a fantastic idea! :) But seriously,  
the high costs of poor quality in medical IT haven't escaped the  
pundits on the subject, and in the presence of a sane global  
macro-economic environment, fixing them would have been on the short  
list of projects for the Obama-Clinton administration.

To start the ball rolling, perhaps you could post this on your blog  
... or if you don't have a blog, I can post it on mine

I wasn't aware that those two were either doctors or programmers. 
Seriously, I propose actions that creative individuals can perform by
themselves, starting right now, without pundits or federal funding
or giant corporations.  That is the whole idea of individual
empowerment - you don't need an OK from the boss.  Power is not
something granted to you - it is all around you, and you /seize/ it.
Grab enough to share, and you can multiply the power you have.

Taking care of health isn't macro - it is as personal, direct, and
immediate as eating an apple instead of a cookie or bag of potato
chips.  There is only a 10% chance of rain tomorrow (Thanksgiving).
Take a walk rather than a second helping of mashed potatoes.  If
you notice that this makes you feel good, blog about that.

I am involved in open source software because it is the best means
available this decade for empowering individuals.  I am a mediocre
programmer, but combined with the talents of thousands of others,
even my feeble contributions are amplified into something world-
changing.  Individuals are either the subject or the object of
their sentences.  I prefer to live on the healthy side of the verb.

I'm not convinced this isn't an error in the configure script
itself--it looks to be trying to run your $PATH for some reason (and
did the first time you wrote in, too).  Does a fresh virgin download
of the script exhibit the same errors?

Keith,

   There are many ways of contributing to the open source industry. Some of
us do so by actively helping users of F/OSS applications who write to mail
lists for help. That takes the load off the application developers. Of
course, if the questions involve the application on some flavor of Microsoft

DNS servers or web servers? When you set  up DNS to do round robin to load
balance. Otherwise you'll need to update DNS to point at another server if
it's for web services.

I didn't make that clear did I????

I want to have a second web server standing by in the event the primary
web server goes down.. Like now...  My primary web server is down.. Loss
of power....And power won't be back for another two days..
But, I have  perfectly good, rsynced web server at an alternate location
with another IP...

How do I get that to come on line.. Now that the primary is down?

Thanks

linux-yug..

Update your primary and or secondary name servers (assuming primary is on
the dead box) to point to the web server that is still alive.

In the future you could automate this with a script and some simple search

Agreed. What libglade2-devel probably installed on your system was 
something like:

[dcf at grond ~]$ rpm -ql libglade2-devel-2.6.2-20
[...output snipped...]
/usr/lib/pkgconfig/libglade-2.0.pc

which is the file that has the pkg-config information in it.  Your 
configure script appears to be using your $PATH variable to search for the 
.pc file, which is wrong.  You will probably have to delve into the 
configure script to try to find out why it is using that variable.

I've run into this problem with configure scripts before; those scripts 
were apparently generated on systems where the running user's $PATH did 
happen to contain the pkg-config directory.  

On the whole, I've found that configure and pkg-config are just about as 
much trouble as the processes they are intended to replace, but that's a 
rant for another time.

You might want to do a 'man pkg-config' for more information about the 
whole scheme.

Wait...

How does it know to go to ns2???

Right now I have

ns1  xxx.yyy.zzz.aaa
ns2  xxx.yyy.zzz.aaa

If I change to 

ns1 xxx.yyy.zzz.aaa
ns2 bbb.ccc.eee.fff


How does it know to use ns2  cause ns1 is down???

IT checks???

The dns server actually check to see if ns1 is up ..
and if not checks  ns2????

Each person that browses to your site does an nslookup for your domain,
which eventually reaches one of your name servers (ns1 or ns2). If the first
one it tries doesn't respond, it tries the next one. Only problem is, there
is no way to guarantee that everyone will try ns1 first. It all depends on
the resolver, and in most cases we have no control over it, or even know
what software is being used. That being said, I would guess around 80% of
the time they go to ns1 first.

However, if you have no reason not to have your site up in both places at
once, then using ns1 to point to one and ns2 to point to the other is just
fine. This just gets a little messy when you do things like dynamic
content.. you have to keep databases synchronized and such.

Is there a way to get bind to log the results of its queries? I found this:
http://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/ch7/logging.html and I got it to log just
about everything, except the actual answer to the query. Even with logging
everything on debug level 100.

If no one here knows offhand, I'll go digging through the source. If there
really is no way to do it, I'll hack up something with tcpdump or tcpflows.

Any suggestions?

P.S.: Release Candidate 1 was just posted. The US mirrors don't seem to 
have it yet, but I got it from

http://ftp5.gwdg.de/pub/opensuse/distribution/11.1-RC1/iso/openSUSE-11.1-RC1-GNOME-LiveCD-i686.iso

with no problems ... MD5 and SHA1 sums are there too.

I'm taking Karla Fant's CS202 this term, no I am not a massachist ;-)

I'm having difficulty setting up eclipse.  I'm on a CentOS 5.2 box.
I've noticed that it is available through yum, but when I try
yum install eclipse I get a request to install a TON of stuff.
I'm not developing java server pages, just plain java programs.
I don't want gcc java, but the yum route seems to grab that.

Okay, I had the brilliant idea of heading over to eclipse.org.
Oops, which eclipse do I download?  I chose classic which comes
up as ganymede.  I assume that installation is simply a matter
of untarring the download.  Two problems are noticeable already,
I don't have an eclipse icon ( okay this is minor ).  I don't have
the welcome page with tutorials, etcetera
( this is a bit more bothersome ).

Well, once I get this straightened out there's the problem of coming
up with a realistic interpretation of "write a program that converts
C++ code to java code..."  Never mind that I'm supposed to be a
novice Java programmer and that I haven't touched Java in I don't
know how long.

Pass or fail, I'll be glad when this term is over.

Ganymede is, afaik, just a name for the 3.4 release of Eclipse -- the
different downloads are just different collections of various plugins
(OSGi bundles).  The Classic version is a good choice for what you're
doing.  The install is just a matter of untarring -- I put it in
~/myapps/eclipse  (so ~/myapps/eclipse/eclipse starts the app.)  You
will want your user to have write access to the eclipse directory, so
don't put it in a system-wide location unless you really want to dig
into the multi-user configurations.

> Two problems are noticeable already,

Since CentOS doesn't know about it, you'll have to set up any menu
entries / etc. on your own.

> the welcome page with tutorials, etcetera
> ( this is a bit more bothersome ).

I'm not sure what you mean here -- you may want to ensure that you
have a clean workspace (usually ~/workspace) and also make sure that
you aren't using some version of eclipse that may have been installed
by CentOS.  (`which eclipse` works well).

Heh, good luck with that... I seriously hope there are some additional
restrictions.  C++ syntax are semantics are absurdly complex (it's not
even context free!).

Well, I went with the yum install and whatever it wanted, and I added
java support.  Now then, the actual assignment...

Limit yourself to: loops, functions, conditionals, basic data types,
and basic I/O.  Pick 5 syntax areas and output the corresponding java
code.  Make sure the solution is object oriented.

No friendly or public fields.

No friendly methods.

Limited use of static functions.

Use an inheritance hierarchy using "extends"

Make client classes for your application

Create at least one abstract base class.

Implement at least one constructor with arguments.

Okay, this probably isn't enough, but that's Karla for you.  I shouldn't
have talked myself into taking this class.  I think expecting us to use
Java at it's full potential when we aren't supposed to know it already
is ridiculous.

I would NOT install eclipse with any package system.  Installing
eclipse as root is not a great idea.  Instead, install it as a normal
user in a home directory.  Believe me, this will save on aspirin.

If you already installed eclipse with yum, I'd clean it out entirely,
and then start fresh with the ganymede tarball.  Also, I'd delete any
~/workspace directory that might have already been created.  That's
probably why you didn't get your tutorials screen - you already had a
workspace with that page closed.

Do you know which version of java you are supposed to use?  It's OK to
install that with yum.  I regularly run java 1.4.2 on an x86_64 box
without problems, even though it's a 32-bit java.  Just throwing that
in here so you'll know not to worry about that aspect.

Another reason to clean out the yum-installed eclipse.  Get it out of
there!

Just to add my $0.02 about java versions...

GCJ (gcc's java) is *not* the same as Sun's java.  The java community
in general will not help you with GCJ issues, and they are legion.

December 18 is the official release date. I've been running 11.1 on my  
laptop with only minor glitches since beta 4. After my failed attempt  
to make a Fedora 10 virtual machine do what I wanted it to do with  
Compiz, I built a Debian Lenny virtual machine. Lenny is still running  
2.6.26, and openSUSE 11.1 is 2.6.27, so I think I'm staying with  
openSUSE on the laptop.

I didn't try the torrents at all -- when Beta 5 came out, the torrents  
weren't giving me the kind of bandwidth I could get from the OSU OSL  
mirror down in Corvallis. But I'll probably fire one up now just to be  
a seeder. :)

Well ... "bittorrent" bad -- Vuze good. :) I started the downloads  
using "Bittorrent" and it was getting puny transfer rates and  
projecting days to completion. So I installed Vuze (formerly azureus).  
Took off like a scalded duck -- I'm getting 10 mbits/second download  
now.

I was having painfully slow downloads with Ktorrent the other day, but
it was a new version for KDE 4.1 that came with the upgrade to
Intrepid. When I launched it all it knew was the list of torrents that
it had downloaded/seeded previously - all other settings were at the
default. Eventually I discovered that it was set to allow only ten
connections per torrent. I raised that to 500, and a short while later
I went from two or three seeders to over a hundred. Download was still
kind of slow, but acceptable - it took only a day to finish the Fedora
DVDs. Unfortunately, that many connections killed my bandwidth for
other things. In the future I will use a Ktorrent plugin that allows
scheduling. I can set it to run only at night. I also noticed a pause
button on the new Ktorrent, so maybe I'll just use that. After the
downloads completed and my share ratio was over 2.00 ('cause I like to
do the right thing) I closed down Ktorrent. The instant I stopped all
the torrent activity my bandwidth returned to normal.

Vuze sounds interesting. A long time ago I tried Azureus but I couldn't
get it to run without crashing every few minutes. Eventually I gave up
on it. I'm happy with Ktorrent, but perhaps I can give Vuze a try. On
the other hand, I question that Bittorrent gives lousy results and Vuze
gives great results on the same torrent. If the same people are seeding
at the same rate and your net connection is the same, it has to be the
settings in the client, not the client itself, right?

The problem was that I couldn't *find* any settings in "Bittorrent"! 
Azureus, on the other hand, has thousands of them. :) Maybe something in 
between, like KTorrent, is the answer.

Subject: [PLUG] remote support tool for firewalled clients
Message-ID: <200811281231.55495.scratchcomputing@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm looking for something which would be similar to an ssh server, but 
would like it to be dead-simple for the user to setup on windows or 
linux without root privileges behind a firewall.  I'm guessing that it 
could simply send commands and outputs over an SSL encrypted socket.

  Me:   download the link from this e-mail and double-click it
  Mom:  ok, it says "password" and "server"
  Me:   q94j8x2 and remote.example.com
  Mom:  ok.
  Me:   yay, I'm in.

Or something like that.  That is, the momputer is firewalled, and one is 
still Win98 while the other is a linux box (which was configured to ssh 
out, but that's a long story.)

I've found the UltraVNC SC utility, which looks like it might be worth 
trying.  Any other suggestions?

Thanks,
Eric

ultravnc is pretty much the universal standard for what you're trying to do.
If both sides are behind a firewall, look into setting up a repeater on a
machine that doesn't have that problem.

If you specifically want something command-line based, you can use putty
with all the tunneling options saved for the user on their desktop. then
create a shortcut pointing to putt.exe -load [session-name] and it all pops
up automagically. The disadvantage here is that someone has to do the
initial setup, since all the settings are stored in the registry. I don't
much like the hack someone put out to store them in a file. It just doesn't
work well enough for me. But it does exist, if you wanted to go that route.

This all assumes you don't have access to the firewall. If you did, you
could configure it to forward port 22 to the linux box, then use ssh port
forwarding to connect to the machines inside from there.

Well, Fedora Core 3 isn't supported anymore and I don't think it is possible
to grab all the updates for it.  I tried to upgrade glibc and ended up  
hosing it.  Yikes!  Some quick thinking and I've temporarily got the  
machine back up.  I installed Fedora Core 3 again on the backup  
partition minimal installation and wholesale copied /lib and /usr/lib.

I'm debating on how to upgrade this machine and I probably should because
it is in a sorry state.  There are so many customizations though.  What
is the best way to migrate logs and email?  I'm thinking of going to
Fedora 9/10 or CentOS 5.  I have network root servers running off of
this box, so I have a lot of stuff to replace when I upgrade.

Concerning updates, they are a real nightmare considering that Linux is so
stable in general that I may go for years between major upgrades.  Has anyone
created their own local yum repository seeded from all the repositories that
are typically used?  Dependencies become problematic when you do upgrades.
I had an upgraded glibc and couldn't get flash installed.  Turns out, I needed
the upgraded glibc and a few other upgrades I don't have.

Keeping older Linux distributions makes sense considering that Linux  
in general has been getting more memory and resource intensive over  
time.  For how much longer will a Pentium III be adequate for Linux?   
Are the days of the 486 mail
server past now?  There should be some focus on tailoring future Linux
distributions to be only as fancy and resource intensive as the computer they
are installed on can handle.  Should Linux need more powerful hardware  
from one
year to the next?  Gnome and KDE seem pretty mature, how about cutting their
resource use in half without significant feature loss? Just because  
today's computers have more memory and processing power, there is no  
need to waste it.

I need to figure out how to migrate this major server to a supported Linux
distribution that is more current.  I've been dreading this.

tar or rsync for the files you need to keep. I've used tar a few times to
back up an entire qmail install and it worked without issue, just remember
to use the p switch to preserve permissions on what you're backing up.

I don't use yum/apt etc since I use Slackware (Rich and I are sinners
right?) I build everything from source that doesn't come with the stoack
install or if I do any customization and then create a script to do the
download/build foo and keep a package handy in a subversion repo for future
upgrades or what have you.


Cheers,

Well ... where to begin?? :)

1. What's your budget?

2. What's the tradeoff between buying a whole new machine, installing 
something stable like CentOS or Scientific Linux 5.x on it and migrating 
the applications versus your time attempting to rescue your current 
setup again and again and again?

3. How long is this hardware going to live in the physical sense?

I just installed openSUSE 11.1 RC1 on my ancient (Compaq Presario 
2110US) laptop and I noted with some joy that most of it is *i586*, not 
i386! Frankly, I wish it had been i686 -- I don't see why the Linux 
community thinks it should support machines that won't even run Windows 
ME! The LiveCDs are i686, though, which is a good thing.

As far as desktops are concerned, I think Gnome has become a lot leaner 
and more modular in recent years. I haven't touched KDE in a long time, 
so I can't speak for sure about it. XFCE 4.4 is lighter than Gnome 
without giving up a lot of functionality, and XFCE 4.2 was even lighter 
if you can still get it.

I personally run WindowMaker on my 4 GB desktop and Gnome on my 512 MB 
laptop, but that's mostly because Gentoo testing has a bizarre mix of 
Gnome 2.22 and 2.24 pieces that I haven't been willing to put the time 
into troubleshooting. :)

Subject: [PLUG] Standard for Contacting Web Sites
Message-ID: <49317D43.9010407@comcast.net>

Over the years I've seen occasional mention on this list of e-mail 
addresses that are standard "requirements" for web sites to monitor. 
Where does one find a list of those e-mail names and other things a 
"real" web site should be doing?

This week I registered a domain, dicksteffens.com, and am building some 
web pages for it. (It only has a very brief "under construction" page 
for now.) Now that I'm putting up a more serious site than the ones I've 
done for my Comcast account I figure I should at least make the attempt 
do abide by the standards. My thanks to this list for the breadth of 
subjects covered that taught me that such standards exist.

You have a few choices.  I know this does not apply for all Distros
but rpm based one
it will.
You have two choices.
1) Grab the RPMs you need to keep from someplace like rpmfind
and create you own repository.
2) Use a package like mock or mach and build your own package.  The
nice thing about
these tools is that you get to control the environment (at least
somewhat) from a config file.
Use these packages and stick them in a repository.

Best bet is to create a repository from your install CD/DVD as a base
and then add packages
to the repository to upgrade individual pieces.

I do this on RHEL5/CentOS5 now except I have my custom packages in a separate
repository.

See:  http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2142.txt

There may be newer RFCs with updates to this list, but this should get
you started.  For the most part, if you're running a mail server and a
web server, having "postmaster", "webmaster", "info", and "abuse" are
probably sufficient.  Note that these addresses will probably receive
quite a bit of spam, so be prepared.

HTH,

I don't mean to get all religious, but perhaps your issue is that you're
not using the right distribution for the job?

Debian has always been dedicated to releasing very stable versions.
This also means it releases very infrequently.  If you set up a box on
a new stable release, you can go 3+ years without upgrading and still
get updates.  This is in contrast to Fedora's release schedule which
obsoletes a release after what, about 18 months?

Of course this very long release cycle has always irked a lot of people,
especially those who install on desktops and are too scared to run
testing or unstable.  That's one of the main reasons Ubuntu came along.
They just track Debian unstable, add a bit of special sauce for
desktops, and release on a regular basis.  They also periodically
release long-term support versions which you should look into.

Remember, the original reason for the Fedora project was to:

A. Keep the old non-paying users of RedHat from getting really pissed
   off when it went for-money-only.

B. Give RedHat a group of lab rats to test stuff on before it goes into
   RHEL.

I'm sure things have changed with Fedora over the last few years, but it
wasn't really designed to do what you're trying to do with it.

You should be perfectly fine on a P3 or other processors of that
vintage.  A 486 is pushing it, but you could pull it off.  The key is,
*you shouldn't be installing X on a server!*.  I know quite a few people
are saying "what???".  But I really mean it.  There's no reason for X on
a server unless you're forced to install some lame third party
application that can only be configured via an X program.  In that case,
just don't run X except when that's needed.  DEFINITELY don't install
KDE or Gnome, since these are rediculously resource intensive.  You
really can run X without them; just fine a lightweight window manager
like blackbox or it's many derivatives.

So without X, you can run really old hardware for a long time with a
decently configured box.  For one, you can start with a decent
lightweight mail server like qmail which hasn't had a major update in 10
years, yet still runs fine out of the box with a handful of patches on
at least a dozen UNIX platforms.  (See netqmail for an easy way to manage
these patches.)  If you can manage compile your services against
dietlibc or uClibc, you can save lots of memory that recent versions of
glibc hogs.  Compile your kernel yourself with only the options you need
and you'll save a meg or two of memory.

That is my plan. I've been practicing with _More Eric Meyer on CSS_ on 
some pages at home. I'm getting used to the way CSS works vs. what I 
used to do. I've also been working with a committee on a web site for my 
church. One of the members is a graphic artist who comes up with 
interesting layouts. My first challenge was to try to figure out a way 
to have different background colors at different levels. Her design 
floats the part with information out in the middle of a grayish 
background. The background of the part with information is white, but 
there are boxes of different sizes. I discovered that I had to include 
all of those inside a container with a height property set larger than 
the total needed in order to have its background white and not parts 
white and the unused part gray!

Good point. I'd forgotten about the w3c logo. Now that you mention it, I 
recall that there is some way to point a compliance agent at the site to 
find out what it thinks of it. I'll have to go to the w3c site and poke 
around a bit for it.

I'll give that a try. At this point I'm still in the very formative 
stages. I have a notion of some of what wants to go on the site, but not 
all of it, yet. When I collect more stuff that "really has to be there" 
I'll start thinking about how to present it. Checking out some templates 
is a good idea.

Thanks!

It seems there is extreme prejudice in the ReactOS community regarding
GNU's C++ compiler, anyone know why?  I suggested that object oriented
programming might be appropriate and that temporary fixes might be
worthwhile only to be shot down and told that gcc c++ is a
"hell of a mess."  Well, does gcc c++ 4 deserve that reputation?
I will say that I haven't experienced any trouble with it.

I wouldn't say there's anything wrong with the GCC implementation of C++
so much as there are things wrong with the C++ language itself. GCC is
damn near perfect, especially when you take into account the number of
languages it translates, the quality of executables it produces and the
huge layer of tools built around it.

There are compilers that are better for some purposes -- the Intel
compilers and libraries do a *slightly* better job at optimizing
number-crunching code to Intel processors, for example. But on the
whole, I'd say that the Gnu Compiler Collection is one of the finest
pieces of software engineering in existence today.

You didn't say what distro you are using.

The problem with Fedora is that you should use the updates and another

to download the DVD and all the updates and put them on a local server.	

Another related question, how do I install Fedora Core 10 if all I have

OK, the Manage Print Jobs GUI applet was added after 6.06. If I recall
correctly (it's been a long time since Dapper) you find the print jobs
from somewhere on the printers dialog box. 

I still think you have an old print job that is hung up. Removing a
printer does not remove the print jobs that are already in the queue.
So they just sit there and keep trying to access the printer - a
printer that the print job will never find because it has been deleted.

See tip #7. In short, float the containing div.

A related question, can I build a Fedora 10 yum repository without using
a Fedora 10 installation?  I'm thinking I want to grab all the updates

That could very well be....

As I remember I didn't  have much luck getting that printer to print....

Ok..I will keep searching..

LiveCD will install a full update-able system just as if you had run a
DVD anaconda
install.

Get the URL's and use reposync. Yum repo's can be on any platform that can
provide ftp, http (install-only repo nfs).

Waiting until EOL to use it could put you well behind the curve of
knowing other repo's
that you might want to pull resources from for your local repo's.

Why you would want to wait to EOL is beyond me... But Fedora is "marketed"
as an 'Unstable development branch for Redhat Enterprise Linux'. That should
explain why things change so rapidly, and why it's more difficult to keep
up.

On servers that I want stability, I use CentOS. It's RHEL, without the
proprietary stuff.

There are plenty of documents on how to make a local yum repository. I
googled for 'local yum repository' and got 286,000 hits. Here are some
examples:

   1. For Fedora: http://fedoranews.org/alex/tutorial/yum/
   2. For Redhat: http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-7228
   3. For CentOS:
   http://www.howtoforge.com/creating_a_local_yum_repository_centos

You can host the repository on any system you choose. It just has to be
available to the systems you need it on via some network protocol. e.g. nfs,
ftp, scp, etc.

As far as installing without a DVD, use a network install, assuming you will
have the local yum repo up before the next install. The documents for that
are also available in mass quantities.

If you have Internet connectivity, you don't need a local repository.
Every major distro and a lot of other open source projects are mirrored
at OSU OSL. Point your browser at http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub and go down
the tree till you find something that matches the strings on the right
hand side.
