Elliott,

   Well, I'm now thoroughly confused. Here are the pertinent lines from 'less
/proc/mounts':

/dev/hda13 /data2 reiserfs rw 0 0
none /data2/winstuff smbfs rw,nosuid,nodev,file_mode=0755,dir_mode=0755 0 0

   I can access every other directory on /dev/hda13, or /data2, other than the
winstuff/ directory. Part of what puzzles me is how that one directory was
changed from reiserfs to smbfs while in runlevel 3 and with vmware running as
a user, not as root.

Thanks,

Rich

The directory was not changed.  e.g. if the /data2/winstuff directory is 
on the /dev/hda13 filesystem, then the filesystem is still reiserfs.

Did you by any chance mount the directory on top of itself as a samba 
share?

e.g.
  mount -t smbfs -o... //localhost/winstuff /data2/winstuff

While the output of 'mount' looks different for me when I do that, I 
can't say what else may have happened on your machine.  In any case, 
you are allowed to do something like this, but then you can't even list 
the contents of the mountpoint directory.

I don't think you have a filesystem problem, I think you've just gotten 
something mounted in a bad way.  If you can't umount it, you may have 
to reboot in order to kick the smbfs driver out of the kernel (looks 
like that's what I'm going to have to do now.)

  # mount
  /dev/hde8 on /home type ext3 (rw)
  ...
  //localhost/bob on /home/bob type smbfs (rw)
  # umount /home/bob
  umount: /home/bob: device is busy
  umount: /home/bob: device is busy

This isn't going to answer your question, but you might find it useful
anyway.  I learned Lisp and Algol in my first programming class.  ~20
years later, the class has changed a bit.  Imagine that!  The class now uses
Scheme.  Nonetheless, you might find it useful to peruse the course
materials.  You can find them here:

   This should be of particular interest to Russell and Harry, both of whom
want desktop clusters. Well, here you have a 96-processor desktop cluster
that runs FC2 (tweaked) with the 2.6.6 kernel:

           <http://www.theregister.com/2005/05/02/orions_ships_96/>

   However, you'll need to return a lot of empty beer containers for the
deposit money to buy this one: $100,000 ... plus shipping.

You'd think for a hundred grand they'd spring for the shipping.

It's only two million beer cans, too.... we could probably do it if we
worked hard.

The old college formula was something like 3+(n) beers, where n = the total number of (cheap) beers to be consumed,
plus three quality beers. After the first three, the quality of the remaining beers doesn't matter much. :-)

   Perhaps they do. You can always ask.

   For this group, it would not be hard work to go through that much microbrew
... or cans of Jolt.

Sadly, the shipping on large cluster systems is exorbitantly
expensive.  At a firm I used to have a contract with, the shipping
CRATE just for one rack reached nearly $1000 per chassis.  The cost to
ship it full was a number in the thousands... and that was just for a
single 64-node rack.

Anyhow, just about everyone will work with edu/nonprofits for some
type of discounts, provided you act as a "showpiece" reference (and it
sounds good :).

   These are desktop systems. The article noted that the whole company turned
out to watch the FedEx driver load the carton in the truck.

They have reinvented FORTRAN, although I'm not sure WATFOR, since the Earth is 
just a big computer crunching onward towards 42.

Evan,

   That was a while ago. Turns out that the database was fixed for mysql and
the code had all sorts of errors. Whole thing's being re-written. Author
never responded to my e-mail, either.

Subject: [PLUG] finding out who manages a domain
Message-ID: <4277DDC9.6050707@mpcu.com>


I'm trying to find out which company manages the dns zones for the domain 
nami-clark.com.  The domain has been lost due to employee loss and also loss 
of tribal knowledge.

whois tells me that

     NS.RSLRS3-SERVER.COM   66.49.209.176
     NS2.RSLRS3-SERVER.COM   66.49.209.177

are the authoritative name servers, and that

canaca.com may own those name servers.  A call to canaca.com informed that 
they say they don't host that domain.

My goal is to just update a mx and a record and not move dns hosting to 
another vendor.

Also the admin and technical contacts for the zone have been contacted and 
they either don't know about the domain or they don't have any technical 
expertise to know.

Sounds like there's some confusion, because the root servers claim that 
canaca.com does host at least the dns records.

Which is my conclusion also.  Now I'm trying to get somebody from that 
domain (canaca.com) to figure out that they host the dns records.

Actually I've got access to the domain management (at a registrar level) for 
this domain.  But they do not host the dns zones.  I also confirmed this via 
a phone call to web.com

Why don't you just move the DNS over to something you do have access to?

OK, so you just edit the domain record to change the name servers to
ones you control.  You'll want two of 'em, and you'll enter in
hostnames and IP addresses for both.

You'll find the "support" page helpful in answering any questions you
have about this.  See, in particular:
http://support.web.com/index.php?x=&mod_id=2&id=97#q5

I don't know if web.com provides name services (DNS).  They probably
do, since they offer mail forwarding (which is a dandy service in itself.)

If that's your domain and you have documentation that the name belongs 
to you (trademark, DBA, etc), go get a lawyer then check out ICANN's 
FAQ about this situation:

http://www.icann.org/faq/#udrp

Good luck!

I'm sure there is a GUI for it somewhere, but if you just want it
done, edit /etc/sysconfig/desktop and change DESKTOP="GNOME" to
DESKTOP="KDE".
If you think you're smart enough not to get confused if you get both
username and password prompts at the same time on the login screen,
instead of one by one, you can change DISPLAYMANAGER to "KDE" as well,
this will start kdm instead of gdm.

Tried the changing the setting in /etc/sysconfig/desktop as specified.
Note that there was not an entry for DISPLAYMANAGER in the file.
Adding one had the described effect.  
One issue though.  I could not log in as root. I had to switch to a text
console to login as root.

I do not find an entry "switchdesk" under "Applications->Preferences->More
Preferences"  The FC3 load selection was for workstation.

The GUI for switching an individual user account to a different desktop is
"switchdesk" on FC3.  The rpm is named the same. 
Applications->Preferences->More Preferences->Desktop Switching Tool
should get you the same thing.

If you want to change it system-wide you'll have to follow Fedor's 
suggestion (change /etc/sysconfig/desktop).

Bah! As a recovering FORTRAN programmer, I can only say that what
high-performance computing exactly *doesn't* need is another language!
Programming languages are like human languages -- they change, evolve,
grow or die by being used to communicate, with machines and with other
programmers. Just about every language I've ever worked in, including
Lisp, Forth, C, Fortran, Perl, Java and R, whether originally intended
to be used that way or not, can be or has been extended to facilitate
high-performance floating point computation on SIMD or MIMD machines.

That said, I'm also a big fan of programming language research, because
that's where ideas come from. My own personal favorite right now is R
(http://cran.us.r-project.org) for a variety of reasons. The way R (and
its commercial cousin S-Plus and ancestor S) does object-oriented
programming is unique, but just about everything else there looks a lot
like most of the Algol descendants we use today: C/C++, Pascal, Ada,
Perl ...

Ed,

   Much as we might wish for Fortran to go away, it's still alive and well in
the ecological modeling world. A very powerful basin model (that integrates
very well with GRASS) is the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) created
and under continual development by the USDA's Ag. Research Station in Temple,
TX. SWAT is one of the few EPA-approved basin models that does hydrology,
erosion, sediment transport and all sorts of other useful stuff. And, it's
still written in Fortran.

   A lot of the US Geological Survey code is still Fortran (and still without
comments) and so are geodetic models.

   They all build nicely with gcc.

Yeah ... I know ... I've spent more of my programming time over the
years working in FORTRAN than any other language. I used to refer to it
as the Listerine of programming languages -- "I hate it but I use it". I
spent ten years at Floating Point Systems -- how could I *not* love
FORTRAN? :)

Have you looked at R? You can call FORTRAN, C and C++ code from R (and
vice versa, IIRC) and nearly every piece of useful numerical and
statistical knowledge exists as a package. There is a GRASS interface
and I believe there is also a map database. I use it where I work to
analyze computer performance statistics. It's also widely used in
biology and finance. I even know someone (me) who is using it in
algorithmic composition and synthesis of music.

A few years ago, I was looking for an open source math package to
integrate into a computer performance analysis package. I looked at Perl
Data Language (PDL), XLisp-Stat, Octave (a Matlab look-alike), SciLab
(another Matlab look-alike) and R. R won, hands down, and that was when
R was quite young -- I believe the release was 1.2 or maybe earlier. R
is now at 2.1, and I don't think any of my other choices have evolved
much at all since then. I think I bet on the right horse. :)

This discussion in various forms shows up all over the Open Source
community -- start something new and really cool, or contribute to
something that's useful but already exists? The short answer, I think,
is that we need both. I've clearly cast my lot in the second camp, as
the Gentoo and R mailing lists will show.

   Yup. It's how I do all my statistics; well, that and fragstat. It's also
tighly integrated with GRASS so one can run all sorts of statistical analyses
from GRASS maps.

   Yes, R is the language of choice for statistical analyses. However, I use
octave to calculate eigenvectors and eigenvalues of symmetrical matrices.
SciLab will do the same job, but I wrote the three line code in octave so it
does the job.

   For plotting of scientific data, I use Gri. It's a replacement for gnuplot
that is much better documented. I've used it to draw river cross-sections
from bathymetry data. I'm just starting to learn pstricks, too, which is a
powerful use of the PostScript language that produces pdf files and provides
the highest possible quality of graphics to be included in LaTeX docs.

   There is a plethora of tools for scientific computing in the F/OSS world.
As far as I can determine (based on my needs and those of others with whom
I've discussed -- or vented about -- the issue) the two great holes in F/OSS
are industrial-strength (no pun intended) project managment (a la Symantec's
TimeLine for DOS) and prospecting/sales management software.

   Project management is more than drawing Gantt charts. It's also CPM
(critical path method), PERT, resource leveling, conflict resolution
(reschedule tasks and resources to minimize delay in the overall schedule
when one tasks slips) and so on. What I find today are either toys or
designed for software development projects.

   You've already read my comments on a contact management system for
prospecting and sales tracking. 'Nuff written on that.

Ah Algol, loved it in the late 60's early 70's. I smile when
people talk about languages and never mention Algol.

I worked at Burroughs where the O/S was written in Algol,
the hardware was stack based, etc. etc.

In fact you and to a very very special customer to have
access to an assembler.

Sorry I digress .. back to the present

I am familiar with R.  I've been using it (off and on) since about
v0.5.  Its object model is Lisp-inspired (a la CLOS) with generic
functions, methods and slots.  R's vector abstraction is kind of nice.
Historically it has been a little bit limited in the way it deals with
memory.  Used to be the whole problem needed to fit into memory.  Not
sure how that's doing these days.

   I'm trying to view a web-hosted application by opening the index.php in
firefox. It links to other .php files in the same directory and .html and
image files in parallel directories or sub-directories of those.

   Is there a standard way of referencing these other pages and files when the
forward slash (for document root) doesn't work? It's not installed on the
local web server, I want to look at the pages to understand the UI.

Thanks,

Rich

php is interpreted by the web server before being transmitted to the 
browser. You'll need to look at them through the web server to see the 
resulting html.

Russ,

   Ah! Nuts. I guess I just need to look at the files and figure out what
they're trying to do, then. And build the Qt interface based on that.

Listerine, eh?  So, C and other languages of choice would be what,

No.  You need to learn to configure an apache (or two (or three)) with 
php (IIRC, debian does this out-of-the-box.)

For one apache, look at the virtual host setup, add another ip address 
to your nic, or even just a name (you can just go to localhost instead 
of $HOSTNAME and have that be a different site.)

If you're running more than one apache, you can run them on different 
ports (I use 80 for apache2 and 8080 for apache1.)

It's very flexible, so if you don't have a computer to dedicate to 
testing, you can (but I don't recommend it) use your main server and 
still not have your playground exposed to the outside world.

Eric,

   It is configured for it and webcollab runs just fine. This other
application, however, is so screwed up that the full day I wasted on it last
week was enough for me.

   I'm building the UI using the Qt Designer; I'll rummage in the php files to
figure out what should be on each form and how it fits together. The former
will go on Qt forms and the latter will be translated to python.

   No, thanks. One's enough here for sql-ledger and webcollab. I let my ISP
host the business web site.

   It ain't. I try to never expose myself in public. Intentionally, at least.

IIRC R carries an eigenvalue/eigenvector routine as well. It has to be
able to do them internally to do principal component analysis, etc. In
fact, they may be carrying all of LAPACK, since they've deprecated
linking with external LAPACK libraries. They still link to external BLAS
by default and detect Atlas if it's installed.

Speaking of LaTeX docs, have you discovered TeXmacs and LyX yet? :)

Amen to that!! There's a third hole, at least for me. It's called
MindManager -- it's a MindMapping/Project Managment tool that links to
Microsoft Project, Outlook, Word and PowerPoint. It's the only reason I
still have a Windows partition on one of my machines. "MrProject" or
"Planner" or whatever it's called these days is so lame I don't know why
Red Hat ships it as part of their desktop. Well, maybe OpenOffice 3.0
will have an MS Project lookalike -- they seem to have done a reasonable
job capturing the MS Access interface.

Incidentally, that line I used in a previous email about people wanting
to go off and build their own tools rather than contributing to existing
ones came from a project management tool site -- I forget which. But
it's a *lot* of work moving from Planner to MS Project, or from FreeMind
to MindManager X5. How do you manage that scale of project without open
source project management tools? <ducking>

They've cleaned up their memory management and made some humongous
performance improvements in stuff I use every day, which is reading
moderate-sized CSV files into memory. R 2.0.0 was a major turning point!
They have a couple of object models now.

   Wrote my book in LyX and use it for all my reports, article, and white

Springer's warehouse last week, but it won't be there until the 17th. I get a
couple of advance copies sent overnight so they're here on the 12th.)

   Given that OO.o has gone java big time, and Sun's climbed into bed with
Microsoft quite willingly, I am extremely cautious about the future of both
OO.o and Java.

   Hey! When I was a kid there was no automation at all. Heck, we didn't even
have water unless we spent hours each day smashing together oxygen and
hydrogen atoms. That was part of our after-school chores.

No need to duck :)

Saw a couple Jovial programs, and sadly never did see a 709 up
front. I began in the transitor/SLT era 360s and B5000's

But did get a tour of a SAGE site, 55,000 tubes and a 99.8%
uptime. Still hard to believe. BTW that tour was in the 1980's !!

Subject: [PLUG] Suse 9.3 from Fry's
Message-ID: <42795128.11699.E98A65BF@localhost>

OK, I mentioned earlier that I bought Suse 9.3 from Fry's at a sale 
price of $69.99, which is less than I can get it academic. So 
tonight I had some free time and I opened the box. There is a 
CD/DVD case that contains the CDs and DVD. A tape across the 
opening says "by breaking the seal you accept the Novell Upgrade 
Protection Terms at www.suse.de.maintenance/agb_int.

So I browse my way to www.suse.de.maintenance/agb_int, only to 
find a multipage legal document. After reading it I find that it 
disclaims all the benefits described on the package. E.g., the 
outside of the box says I am entitled to 90 days of free installation 
support. The legal document says I am entitled to no support of 
any kind. Yeah, yeah, I could sue them under some consumer 
protection law and claim that the advertised benefit takes 
precedence over the legal document. Horse pucky. Maybe so, but 
life is too short to deal with that kind of BS.

So later I will return the box to Fry's for a refund. If I can't count on 
support from Suse, then I might as well just download the free 
version.

  Geeze!  You had atoms?  All we had were clouds of cold quarks.  We
had to heat them up and sort them by color and spin before we could
build our particles, atoms, and *finally* make water molecules. 
Sometimes it took all night to make enough H2O to wash our hands and
faces for school the next day.

You know, that reminds me of a story. A few years ago, the scientists
somewhere (Bell Labs, I think) discovered some unusual radio waves
buried in the typical background noise that affects communications. So
they analyzed it and came to the conclusion that it was, in fact, the
echoes of the Big Bang that created the Universe as we know it. IIRC
they got a Nobel prize for this.

They took the waveforms back to the lab and wrote a program to simulate
the equations of the Big Bang to verify their conjecture. When they ran
the simulation, the radio signals they had detected were indeed present.
Then one scientist got the idea, "What if we run the simulation

Well, she talks about Recipe 24.18 which makes three files and then 
refers to four other config files which <as far as I could tell> she 
hasn't talked about..


So I am trying to contact her directly...   She has very good 
instructions..  I  just missed something...  So I think I can ping her 
it will clear itself up.  I n the mean time....

I will give the bind user list a ping and see what happens..   I didn't

As long as you don't mind not having bootable CD's.

Unless SuSE (Novell) changed their policy, the only legal way to get any 
CD other than the bootable live evaluation CD is to purchase their boxed 
sets.

You can do a network install from their FTP site, but that's just never 
seemed enough to me.

Did everyone  see Novell ads on Linuxtoday?  It was a "flash banner" 
that covered the page fro 10 sec each time the page was loaded.  Since 
then I stopped going to Linuxtoday and I wrote emails to Novell. 
I expect Novell will be big in enterprise desktop, but for the 
grassroots, don't expect anything.  These are the same people who 
sold/sell Netware, they bought SUSE Linux, not grew with it.  They see 
Linux as $$, not freedom.

Hi John,

There is  no official membership roster for PLUG. You are a member if you

Well there are lots of other SuSE users out there and even if you couldn't get 
any help someone from the online community could probably help. SuSE has 
always had had install support though. IIRC the 90 day clock doesn't even 
start ticking until you log your first support issue.

I've never used their install support myself and I say this as someone that's 
used every version of SuSE since 5.2. I can generally get the help I need 
from looking at online support forums.

In fact I just went through this in the last few days trying to get a Dell 
Inspiron 6000 lap with the and Integrated Intel 915GM graphics adapter and 
Centrino 2915 WIFI setup under SuSE 9.2. It was a bit of work but I'm happy 
to report SuSE 9.2 is running like a champ on the laptop. 

If anyone's interest I can post the gory details in a separate posting.

Tony

If you're traveling and want to send your e-mail out through your own
server (bypassing or avoiding whatever local SMTP server--if there is
one), you'll need to set up SASL and SMTP AUTH.  (And also SMTPS (over
SSL) and probably also 'submission', which handily allows you to avoid
restrictions from local firewalls on outbound mail.)

   You're a member if you want to be a member. There's no form to be filled
in, no dues, no secret decoder ring. Heck, we don't even have official
T-shirts! PLUG is the most laid-back, unstructured, sorta' functioning
collection of individuals since ... state legislatures were created.

A friend of mine who's a long-time SuSE user alleges that this is not
actually the case, although, aside from a discussion with him, I have no
further evidence to corroborate that assertion.

If they are available somewhere, I'd like to know where. I've been 
looking for quite some time.

What really ticked me off was when SuSE (pre-Novell) stopped giving NFR 
copies. We're a developer of software that runs on Linux... We'd like to 
test our product on your distribution... Nope... not without paying for it.

 From what I can see, that hasn't changed either.

Having no idea what recipe 24.18 is, we're still in the dark as to what
your problem is.

"DNS & BIND" from O'Reilly is the de facto standard for learning about

Wil,

   That's a very clear description.

   When I travel I ssh into my network and send e-mail from there. Which
confirms that sasl is still not necessary for me.

Many thanks -- I knew you'd have the answer,

Rich

Ouch, that hurts comparing PLUG members to state legislatures.  We all 
know that PLUG members get things done with less BS and lots less money 
involved.  :-)

Well, I've seen them available on BitTorrent sites, but that's obviously
no indicationg of legitimacy.  I don't think SuSE/Novell themselves make
the ISOs available; his assertion was that they could legitimately be
redistributed--via BitTorrent, FTP, CD copies at clincs, etc.  I guess I
should check with him; I'll let you know what I can turn up.

You're right about the money, but I'm not so sure about the BS 
quotient. That's why there's plug-talk, after all... :-)

They changed their policy a while ago. You are allowed to make copies 
and give it to people, but only for free. You only get support with the 
boxed set.

I have written the script below and am puzzled by the fact that the shell
variable TMPFILE is not global in nature.
According to all documentation I can find, it is explicitly stated that with
regard to function, all variables are global unless the "local" keyword is
used.
I am not seeing a global effect when the script below is run on White Box
Linux (Bash 2.05) or Fedora Core 3 (Bash 3.05).  Is there a setting I may
have wrong someplace?

==============================
#!/bin/bash
# Script to get unique number using files in a temp directory
#

set -x

TMPDIR=~/tmp

function GetNumber
{
  set -xv
  for n in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
  do
    TMPFILE=$TMPDIR/TagFile$n
    if [ -f $TMPFILE ]
    then
      continue
    else
      touch $TMPFILE
      echo $n
      trap "rm -f $TMPFILE" INT TERM
      exit
    fi
  done
}

TMPFILE=None
Num=`GetNumber`

So at least one person must purchase a copy, and then altruistically 
give away what they've paid for.

Doesn't seem like something many people would do.

Subject: E-mail timestamps

I think this is a common problem, but I haven't had to deal with it before.
Some e-mail clients are receiving e-mail with incorrect date/time stamps.
In a recent example, the e-mail was dated Jan. 15, 1904.  In another case
the e-mail was actually generated by a form on a webpage.  In all cases,
the Received: headers have reasonable dates and times, telling me that
all the intervening servers are OK.  The dates are off by weeks or more,
so it's not just a timezone thing.

I've been concluding that it's a problem on the individual user's PCs, but
it only started happening (or at least being reported) after I installed a
new e-mail server.  I've never seen this on any of my other e-mail servers,
and they all run Postfix.  I see the incorrect "Date" lines in the spool
file, so it isn't a problem on the receiving user's MUA.

Is this really a problem with the sender's MUA, or am I missing something?

While I can't speak directly to your question, I have noticed the same sort of 
odd date/time in e-mail every so often over several years. I generally 
chuckle over it, and ignore it.

Hi all,

If anyone's interested in Prolog, at the next Perl Mongers' meeting I
will be giving a *brief* introduction to Prolog and a couple of
strategies on embedding it in Perl.  Info, as usual, is at
http://pdx.pm.org/kwiki/

I've managed to write a stunningly boring description of it.

Cheers,
Ovid

The "holy grail" of computing, for many, is simply telling the computer
what you want and have it figure out how to do it. Prolog is a step in
this direction.

And are you proud of your refactoring in Perl? Do you worship DRY?
(Don't repeat yourself?) Have you ever cringed when you had to reverse
map a hash to lookup something by value? This and other "forced
duplication" hacks are often unecessary in Prolog. By the time the talk
is done, programmers will understand why Prolog is code reuse on
steroids.

And despite all of that, it's probably one of the easiest languages to
learn (though it can be rather hard to master.)

Hi,

I called their US sales office last year and was told the same thing.  I 
can give copies to students as long as there is no promotion of the 
software as a benefit of the class, "pay for the class, get the software" 
is not allowed.

Also, as of 9.2, none of the download .iso images include all the software 
in the boxed set.  You can download an .iso that will boot, establish an 
ftp connection to a mirror and complete an install. Or you can download the 
full tree and then install from that.  You can download the .iso files for 
the Novel Linux Desktop, a modified Suse 9.0 Pro.

Cheers,
Mike

Two things:
1. Read this: http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

2. Please remember that folks on this list are very nice, knowledgable
human beings, many of whom can be paid decent amounts of money for the
info they take the time and trouble to give away here for free.

Take the time to ask good questions and be gracious about the answers
you receive.  It keeps the knowledge flowing.

Thanks,
  Aaron

Perhaps the old server had been setup to remove "Date:" headers that were
placed by the MUA and replace them with its own, and so there was a
problem that was hidden. Or perhaps it was a known issue and it had to be
deliberately set that way.

This (and the subject line, of course) reminds me of The Final Message:
-----
They rounded the foot of the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains, and there was 
the Message written in blazing letters along the crest of the Mountain. 
There was a little observation vantage point with a rail built along 
the top of a large rock facing it, from which you could get a good 
view. It had a little pay-telescope for looking at the letters in 
detail, but no one would ever use it because the letters burned with 
the divine brilliance of the heavens and would, if seen through a 
telescope, have severely damaged the retina and optic nerve.

They gazed at God's Final Message in wonderment, and were slowly and 
ineffably filled with a great sense of peace, and of final and complete 
understanding.

Fenchurch sighed. "Yes," she said, "that was it."

They had been staring at it for fully ten minutes before they became 
aware that Marvin, hanging between their shoulders, was in 
difficulties. The robot could no longer lift his head, had not read the 
message. They lifted his head, but he complained that his vision 
circuits had almost gone.

They found a coin and helped him to the telescope. He complained and 
insulted them, but they helped him look at each individual letter in 
turn, The first letter was a "w", the second an "e". Then there was a 
gap. An "a" followed, then a "p", an "o" and an "l".

Marvin paused for a rest.

After a few moments they resumed and let him see the "o", the "g", the 
"i", the "s" and the "e".

The next two words were "for" and "the". The last one was a long one, 
and Marvin needed another rest before he could tackle it.

It started with an "i", then "n" then a "c". Next came an "o" and an 
"n", followed by a "v", an "e", another "n" and an "i".

After a final pause, Marvin gathered his strength for the last stretch.

He read the "e", the "n", the "c" and at last the final "e", and 
staggered back into their arms.

"I think," he murmured at last, from deep within his corroding rattling 
thorax, "I feel good about it."

The lights went out in his eyes for absolutely the very last time ever.

Luckily, there was a stall nearby where you could rent scooters from 
guys with green wings.

The backtick (command substitution) operator generates it's own 
environment (I think).  You'll have to export TMPDIR to mark it for the 
environment passed to the child process.

Of course, it's late, and my processor has gone to sleep (S5?).

BTW, since I was too tired to mention it in the last email, changing

   Num=`GetNumber`

to

   Num=$(GetNumber)

will also solve your problem, this time without exporting TMPDIR.

Great meeting. Very interesting. I knew nothing about VOIP before.

Sorry I had to leave a bit early, lest I miss my bus. I wanted to

Thanks for the reply

I did that...

On page 516 is the  /etc/bind/named.conf

I have that file constructed and it is fine.

I put named.root in /var/named

I created the zone files on page 517!!!!


So on the bottom of page 517 Carla says "Stuff all these files into 
/var/named and restart BIND"

Well, I didn't do that I went  on to page  518  where it says do Recipe 
24.17

Which puts me at the failure

I don't remember  making db.zone.net.mydomain???

What did I miss??

Subject: [PLUG] iptables where INPUT and OUTPUT...
Message-ID: <1115161821.427804dd9446d@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

have to have a default policy of ACCEPT on them.

I want to add an interface to my mail server and firewall it so 
that it can only talk smtp with the outside world.  So far, I've 
come up with: 

NOTE that 209.210.202.172 is the outside address I'm using on this new
          interface I'm adding.

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -d 209.210.202.172 --destination-port 0:24 -j DROP
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -d 209.210.202.172 --destination-port 26:1023 -j DROP

and the same for udp as well.

Using nmap I'm seeing sometimes rpc-3 on some high port, 
32770 I think, isn't this port unpriviledged?  What 
rules do I need to seal X and nfs in?  Do I need to block 
port 3305 used by nuts?  I hope NFS isn't just totally
random in it's use of the unpriviledged port range.
Do I even need to have 1024:65535 open for an smtp only
server?  

Since I intend for this to be an outgoing only mail server, I'm 
wondering if I should run it on port 24 instead of port 25?

I wish iptables would allow me to have different INPUT, OUTPUT, and
FORWARD policies on different interfaces.  I guess my other option
is figuring out how to permit NFS, LTSP, etc. with a default policy
of DROP.

I contact remote client's port 25 from my server, do I need 
to use an unpriviledged port?  Can I deny remote clients 
connection requests to my unpriviledged ports without 
breaking smtp?  How does postfix use the unpriveledged 
port range?

Subject: [PLUG] My anti spam approach...
Message-ID: <1115232144.427917906fbf1@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

At http://web.robinson-west.com there's a link to show the 
listing of an iptables chain containing the addresses of mail 
servers that have gotten a 5xx smtp error trying to access
my servers.

It's part of my anti spam campaign beyond simple filtering.

So far, my script can block a site permanently simply because
someone at that site is repeatedly trying to email a nonexistent
user.  I'm thinking I should refine this by recording the reason
for blocking an ip.  

Blocking sites that reverse resolve to something
strangle like DSL...xx-yy-zz-qq... where xx,yy,zz,and qq are
numbers, I wonder how often I will block legitimate email 
sources?  Is it wise to block sites that don't reverse dns
resolve at all?  Anyone know of a legitimate Internet
connected smtp email source that doesn't have a PTR record?

At this point, I'm considering a manual override feature for
my users.  After all, mail.hotmail.com probably shouldn't be on
my block list.  Being able to implement hold and notify would 
be awfully nice for hotmail.com, but I don't know how to use
postfix's hold feature.  What I'd like to do is
implement a softer blocking approach that holds anything
from hotmail.com and sends a notification.  I want this
blocking approach to be variably applied though.  If soft
blocking is being used and one of my users doesn't want 
to be notified that there are messages from hotmail.com,
I want to accomodate that user.

I've been working on my blocking script trying to get the bugs
out.  In addition to keeping my ISP from being blocked, I've 
added the mypcc.edu email server and servers from 
http://dnsreport.com/, a site I use to test my nameservers.  
I had a blocking notification script, but I've 
stopped using it concerned that it's causing more problems 
than it's solving.

I've asked my ISP, opusnet.com, to do mail forwarding 
when my dsl fails.  I have imap accounts open for that.  
Unfortunately, Opus doesn't seem to have it's Imail 
server configured properly.  Mail for my domain will
spool at Opus's server, but it won't deposit in the 
imap boxes there.  Five hours is a long time to
wait to see if Opus has set things up right, especially
considering how much mail can be lost in that five hour
period if the mail Opus is spooling for me simply 
bounces.  I don't want to be locked in to Opus's domain 
name for email.  Using my own domain name, I can have 
more than six email addresses and I'm ISP neutral.  
It's my aliases that Opus seems to be the most upset 
with when it comes to setting up mail forwarding for 
my site.  It's easy to set a relay that supports many
aliases with postfix, but I guess that Imail is 
configured via a clumsy web interface.

I could push Opus, but my ISP is treating mail forwarding
as a favor and it hasn't named a price to make it work
right.  The email boxes were free, part of our service,
but having Opus deposit email in them addressed to a 
different domain is supposedly extra.  Is there some good 
reason to use Imail instead of Postfix, Qmail, or Sendmail?  
Maybe I should set up my tertiary mail server at a friends 
house and simply forward any messages that arrive there to 
the email boxes at Opus.

Has anyone gotten their ISP to do mail forwarding for them?

If anyone wants to see my Bash scripts, let me know.  I think
they are becoming reasonably useful now.

Subject: [PLUG] Postfix error logging...
Message-ID: <1115393124.427b8c64c038e@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I don't support email addresses like:

12.3.22.1.camel at robinson-west.com

Is there any way I can have postfix 
suppress logging of intended 
recipients following forms that I 
neither use nor allow?

What are the rules for email addresses?
What characters are legal?  How long 
can they be?

I think I'm using a sledgehammer to put 
a tack into a corkboard blocking 
the ip address of certain email sources.  
I block the ip address so that my logs
won't flood with garbage.  So far, the
lowest rejection rate I can achieve for
a single day is somewhere in the 30-40% 
range.  I don't know if greylisted email
is considered rejected by Jim Sun's
pflogsumm.pl script.

There aren't always reverse dns records
for legitimate smtp clients and I have
also noticed that a some mail servers
behind MS NAT don't connect to me with
their external Internet address.

If I have an email address that I decide to 
discontinue, I want to be able to watch 
for attempts to email that specific address.  
However, I don't want to be flooded with 
random garbage addresses.

Is it common to use dynamic ip and hostname 
addressing on Internet connected mail servers?  
If it is, checking the helo and the hostname
may be completely ambiguous.

If I can't trust the address of the connecting 
smtp server as a reliable filtering criteria, 
I'm at a loss on what to do.  It seems like the 
Internet needs a more secure host addressing 
scheme.

You should set it up to drop everything and then put in rules to accept
those connections that you want to allow.
And, yes, you can have different rules for different interfaces. That's the
way I have my firewalls set up.
I could be more specific if you sent a copy of your setup script.

have to have a default policy of ACCEPT on them.

I want to add an interface to my mail server and firewall it so 
that it can only talk smtp with the outside world.  So far, I've 
come up with: 

NOTE that 209.210.202.172 is the outside address I'm using on this new
          interface I'm adding.

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -d 209.210.202.172 --destination-port 0:24 -j DROP
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -d 209.210.202.172 --destination-port 26:1023 -j
DROP

and the same for udp as well.

Using nmap I'm seeing sometimes rpc-3 on some high port, 
32770 I think, isn't this port unpriviledged?  What 
rules do I need to seal X and nfs in?  Do I need to block 
port 3305 used by nuts?  I hope NFS isn't just totally
random in it's use of the unpriviledged port range.
Do I even need to have 1024:65535 open for an smtp only
server?  

Since I intend for this to be an outgoing only mail server, I'm 
wondering if I should run it on port 24 instead of port 25?

I wish iptables would allow me to have different INPUT, OUTPUT, and
FORWARD policies on different interfaces.  I guess my other option
is figuring out how to permit NFS, LTSP, etc. with a default policy
of DROP.

I contact remote client's port 25 from my server, do I need 
to use an unpriviledged port?  Can I deny remote clients 
connection requests to my unpriviledged ports without 
breaking smtp?  How does postfix use the unpriveledged 
port range?

The script that I set my firewall with prior to saving it and my 
netstat -nlptu output is attached.

I'm not sure how to properly allow nfs, tftp, X, etc. if I go to
a default policy of DROP on INPUT, OUTPUT, and FORWARD.

I see what you mean.  This behavior is clearly at odds with the man page.
The man page states that all variables can be seen by both the function and
the calling script.

"Variables local to the function may be declared with the "local" builtin
command.  Ordinarily, variables and their values are shared between the
function and its caller."

This looks like a clear case of a bug to me...

The script that I set my firewall with prior to saving it and my

I'm not sure how to properly allow nfs, tftp, X, etc. if I go to

You'll get small, hobbyist sites that can't afford a less chintzy ISP 
and smaller companies.  Just because they have a PTR doesn't mean 
they have control over it's accuracy...

It's generally safe to block sites that don't have a PTR.

Paul> It's generally safe to block sites that don't have a PTR.

I tried that for a while.  Had to turn it off.  Can't remember why.

Here's what I'm blocking right now, and it brings insane mail to
a sane level:

"high mx trap" - my best indicator of bogosity - if they deliver
to spamtrap.stonehenge.com instead of blue.stonehenge.com, they be
bad.  This trips about half of the incoming, and I've never yet
seen a false positive here.

"HELO $me" - If they HELO as my IP or my name, BAD BOY.

"envelope-from with no mailable domain" - If I can't bounce
a message to them (no A or MX), then they don't get to write
to me.

"no such $user at stonehenge.com" - If they're writing to someone
I don't know, bad.  This stops dictionary attacks.

"amavis/spamassasin" - If amavis says the payload is a microsoft exe,
or spamassasin with a pretty high threshold says "no", then bye bye.
(Note that I am *not* using any RBLs at all.)

If anybody trips any of the above alarms, their IP address is blocked
from me for an hour.

This is a conservative list, but it's good enough for me.  It reduces
my email load to about 10% of the original.  I still get about 500 ugly
messages a day, but that's better than the 5000 or more I was getting before.

For fun, join #threatnet at irc.freenode.net.  My bot "Rubble"
is spitting out realtime displays of these alarms.  Beware - it can
be fascinating, like a train wreck.

We have a number of RHES 3 systems in our office and for setting up printing I 
just run "redhat-config-printer" while logged in as root. Newer Linux systems 
tend to use CUPS and it's a whole lot easier to have an easy to use GUI hide 
the nasty details of configuring CUPS. It's quite flexible and can handle 
locally connect printers, and/or remote printers using a variety of protocols 
including: LPD, SMB, DirectJet or another CUPS server.

Make sure cups-bsd is installed.  That makes CUPS act like lpr.  By
default, it'll make all the CUPS print queues available as lpr queues,
which makes things pretty easy.  You can also set up aliases, I think.

By default, CUPS figures out the format of the print job and processes
it accordingly.  That means you can send it PostScript, JPEG, text,
PDF, and maybe TIFF and/or PCL stuff.  If some clients are expecting
to send raw-format stuff (e.g. PCL, Epson, DEC) straight to the
printer, you can set up raw queues.

Good luck,
  Aaron

I am a little surprised they didn't get rousted by Campus Security.
Five hours worth of twitching headlamps in the middle of the Quad

they had created a diversion by means of some drunken football players
sodomizing a farm animal.  It has worked before!

The problem is, I've got about 100 printers (and all their aliases)
already defined in the Tru64 printcap file.  I really don't want to
recreate each printer in cups and locate each printer to determine
which make/model it is.  So I was hoping for a way to have cups
process the printcap file directly.
Any suggestions?
Thanks,
~M

I disagree... although I realize in the war on spam, there will be some
innocent bystanders killed.

A mail server I've recently finished setting up for some semi high
traffic stuff (for me, anyway, probably nothing compared to what some of
the big boys run) still doesn't have a PTR record... getting the colo
provider to edit their zone files seems to be like pulling teeth.  :-)

Not sure quite what you are doing, but "uniq" needs its input to be
sorted.  At least to do what I think you are trying to do.  Another
strategy might be to pump your input into an associative array
(i.e. hash table) and then dump the contents at the end.

Assuming that the list looks like:

username	tire.patch.com
uname2	berry.patch.com
userthree	patch.com


#!/usr/bin/perl -w

if the data comes from a list of email addresses then change

If there's a way to import BSD printcaps into CUPS, I've never heard
of it.  So don't use CUPS.  Sounds like you want to just do a straight
migration with no change in functionality, and your best bet is to use
the same sort of print server you used to use, e.g. BSD LPR.  (I don't
think LPR-NG can use the old printcap files.)

If you find yourself wanting CUPS features (IPP, good inkjet support
etc.) you could set up a CUPS daemon and have it feed jobs to the BSD
LPR queues.  You could do the same thing with Samba.

  I don't use AWK any more.  I had a tragic AWK experience in my early
Unix career.  How about in shell script?

I had a 3Ghz hyper threaded processor using SpamAssassin to filter mail.
The processor(s) were pegged and falling behind.  Some good mail was being
delivered up to 4 hours late.  I made two changes.  First, I began using
spamhaus.org (sbl+xbl) as a blacklist.  In Postfix this is a one-line entry.

Second, I implemented greylisting, using nothing more than the sample on
postfix.org (http://www.postfix.org/SMTPD_POLICY_README.html).

Note that I didn't disable SpamAssassin, but these other two changes
automatically happen first, so SpamAssassin only processes stuff that gets
by them.

My CPU utilization dropped to less than 2%.  I've had no false positives,
and until recently the e-mails SpamAssassin was flagging were in the single
digits per day.  In the last week or so that's jumped to about 15, so it
must be time to upgrade SpamAssassin again.

I don't know what the effect would have been of implementing just one of the
two additional approaches, but I think there's probably a good amount of
overlap between the two.  That is, if I blocked 1000 spams with both of
them, I suspect I would have blocked something like 700 with either one
individually, but that's speculation.

Good luck.

                                -B.

Well this and the script sort of worked. They woked in that they did 
something, but not the expected outcome.

See, I can get rid of the usernames, but the subdomains, I need to save 
the actual domains, but can dump the subdomains and that has been the 
tricky part. I tried to get it to dump the first field after using a 
period as the field delimitor, but I still wound up losing domains, and 
since I don't know eactly how many fields each line will have, I'm not 
sure how to get it to just pull the last two, since this "normally" is 
were the actual doamain and extension should be. I've flirted with the 
idea of having it just continually add to a file after first removing 
first field and then doing a uniq and diff on the two files. But that's 
too complicated for this.

Message-ID: <1115432919.12156.8.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Good news.  Jax Bar and Restaurant, 826 SW 2nd, site of the Linux
Advanced Topics Talk every third Wednesday of the month at 7:00pm, now
is offering free wireless access.

The circuit was delivered this morning.  I'm getting about 1.2Mbps down
and up after overhead.  I've loaned them some hardware to get them
going.  The signal strength in the dining area where the LATT meetings
are held is excellent.  It's an open network, and the ESSID is
jaxbar.com

Please come on down and support them so they can afford to keep the
circuit for all of us to enjoy.

Thanks,

Are you sure about doing that? For "user at amazon.co.uk" you just want 
".co.uk", and for "fred at corbett.tusd.k12.us" you just want "k12.us"?

Herin lies the problem. the "actual domain" rules (if I understand your 
usage properly) vary wildly, so it's hard to determine what is, and 
isn't,

Is it possible to take a step back from the problem, and define what 
the desired *outcome* is? Do you need to find the MX records for those 
email addresses, or something similar?

sure Bop,

I need to weed down a file of inbound email addresses on a weekly basis 
to keep another file from over flowing with multiple copies of the same 
MX information. I'd like to garner "just" the mx info, but that has been 
the issue tripping me up. And it needs to be something small and 
portable enough eventually get turned into a java program so it's OS 
portable(well so I can use it on a Windows box when not at my Fedora 
Core 3 here) so, thus have I spent many weary hours trying to tap the 
web for info. Each forum has a bit of the puzzle, nothing that combines 
them. I finally got the Awk piece working and even got it to uniq-u and 
do a bit more creative sorting, but this last is bringing a terrible 
thirst on, and I don't think thee is enough Stout in Portland if I fall 
off the wagon. :)

Very, very few.  Even if the PTR isn't correct (as is the case for 
me), it at least exists for almost every assigned IP out there.

You'd think they would at least assign some generic PTR like most 
networks do for their customers.

I seem to see more and more PTRs vanishing by the day from broadband
users.  :-\

I lost mine (at home) six months back or so.  About the same time they
blocked outbound port 25.  I see friends losing theirs regularly, too...

Yeah, you would...  but it's a *really good deal* so I'm not going to
complain too much.  (I *will* get the PTRs, it's just a matter of time) :-)

Brian,

   For what it's worth, I ran only postfix filters until some time last year
when I added SpamAssassin to the mix to catch those that slipped in.

   In postfix I have a list of IP addresses to reject, another list of domain
names to reject, a third list of words/phrases in headers, and a fourth list
of words/phrases in the body of the message. I also use a half-dozen (or
more) RBLs.

   With the above and SA I deal with fewer than a half-dozen spam per day that
slip past all the guards. It varies, and I don't track it carefully, but it's
much more reasonable than without the protection.

In java....Hm... seems like a job for JNDI/DNS (Documented Sun-style 
(fun, fun!) at: 
<http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/jndi/jndi-dns.html>).

Ooooh. Not good, not good at all..... I drink a lot of stout, and a 
local shortage might be very, very, bad...

Okay, maybe this simple example of email verification in java will 
help, as it covers most of the issues of extracting MX (and other DNS 
info, by example) information for a given email address:
<http://www.rgagnon.com/javadetails/java-0452.html>

You will have to slightly modify the above java code to suit your 
purposes to return the MX record(s) (or other DNS provided records, if 
you need them) themselves, and to uniq/diff/array compare/whatever on 
the resulting files.... Caveat: also note that the resulting MX record 
may bear no relation whatsoever to the sender's email address (another 
way to get tripped up).

So, okay, maybe I just provided another "bit" of the puzzle, but 
hopefully you're not off in the weeds doing text whacking on files of 
email addies when what you're *really* looking for is DNS-resolvable 
information about the MX records for those addresses?

While text tools are great for paring down fixed length entries, DNS is 
kind of fun in that below the TLD's, subdomains get pretty wild and 
wooly.

Also of note: Perl has libraries for similar purposes, as does PHP 
(etc. etc.)

Assuming that the "domain" section you seek is the last two elements 
of the domain portion of the address, it's pretty simple in bash. This 
snippet assumes the addresses are in a file named 'addrlist.txt' and 
that you have a fairly recent installation of GNU grep (which 
understands the -o option):

while read addr
do
   echo "$addr" | grep -o '[^.@]*\.[^.]*$'
done < addrlist.txt

Regards the Firefox logo drawn on the center of the OSU quad:

I went to OSU, and the campus police were "legendary".   They were
often the target of practical jokes, and the particular focus of the
residents of second-floor Weatherford, known as the "Nads". 

For example, the time that the Nads stole the water fountain from the
Corvallis police department, and left it in the corner of the outer
office of the Campus police - where it stayed, unconnected and
nonfunctional, for months, as the Kops waited for Facilities to
connect it (the little "Property of the City of Corvallis" tag
apparently exceeded their reading abilities).

Their police radios never worked.  They always ended up with blown
transmitters.  One of the Nads had this pesky habit of reaching up
inside the fender to the antenna mount with a length of wire and
alligator clips, shorting the whip to the fender.  The shorting
wire would typically fall off as they sped back to the Kop Shop
to report their dead radio.  They never figured this out.  Perhaps
the tradition continues today.

The snow-covered "volkswagon" stalled on the railroad tracks running
through campus during a snowstorm was a nice touch.  When a westbound
freight came through campus (yes, the main freight tracks ran through
the campus), the Kampus Kops called for an emergency stop of the
locomotive, while they pondered how to move the stalled vehicle off
the tracks.  The Nads solved the problem, by running out to kick the
volkswagon-shaped snow sculpture to pieces.

That was 30 years ago.  Last year we were at OSU to watch the human
powered vehicle race at DaVinci days.  The race went west down
Campus Way, a narrow street that necks down to one lane in places. 
A brilliant Kampus Kop decided to watch the oncoming race with
her Kop Kar blocking the lane,  so the oncoming vehicles had
to divert over curbs and onto the sidewalk to avoid collisions.


So I do not believe that OSU Campus Security would be capable of
detecting the existence of students painting the quad at night.
And if the cops did somehow manage to notice, they could easily
be neutralized with donut-laden mousetraps, or phony job offers
from the Department of Homeland Security.

Nah, I don't need any CUPS features.  I just need things to work the

I saw a Very Large (listed on NASDAQ, something like 30 global 
locations) data center company wipe them out for hundreds of customers 
once (while switching their DNS over). Not good at all. Took months and 
months to sort it all out, because they switched over to a DNS server 
which required a fairly non-bind-friendly implementation.

Getting back to the original matter, I'd use a missing PTR as a 
*weighting* factor of spam, if I was worried about losing any valid 
email. *Especially* if incoming email is expected from clients (or 
whatever) running off of DSL/Cable/etc. from less experienced ISPs, or 
coming from companies whose DNS admins are possibly in need of 
additional training.

Wow.  ~100 characters to criticize the use of 3.  And at least the 3
characters improve readability IMHO.

And how many characters to criticize the use of those ~100 characters?  ;-)

By *teaching* people when to use cat and when not to use cat, you may
save characters for lifetimes to come.

I disagree about the readability thing - I dislike UUOC and think it
confuses readability.

Fewer.

I understand that The One True Correct Way To Use Cat [sic] is to
concatenate multiple files and pipe them to stdout, and anything else
is a horrible, shameful UUOC, so do it in private and wash your hands
afterwards.  

Luckily for us, this is *nix, and there many ways to do things, nearly
all of them hackishly built up with little utilities being used in
ways their authors never bothered to think of.  That's the Unix Way.

> I disagree about the readability thing - I dislike UUOC and think it
> confuses readability.

For me it's simple:  If you're reading a pipeline, it should go
left-to-right, with minimal ambiguity about where the data's coming
from and what's being done to it.  Using cat removes any question
about where the data's coming from, and you don't have to remember if
the first filter in the pipeline takes its input file as a plain
parameter, a -f <filename>, a -i <filename> or something else, or only
as a redirect.  You don't have to figure out which bit is filename and
which is parameter.  And if you want to use some other data source,
it's perfectly obvious that you need only remove the "cat <filename>"
from the beginning.

One-thing-at-a-time readability is especially important when you're
presenting a functional example to a mailing-list with lots of
beginning Linux folks.

But I'd love to know why I'm wrong,
  Aaron

Hrm, certainly cat is unnecessary in this case, but when you start
chaining multiple pipes together like this, having your input clearly on
the left side and your output on the right makes the whole thing more
readable.  Of course, I guess that doesn't mean much to a Perl guru :-P

Of course, cat would indeed be unnecessary with a better, single sed
script (and I'm not sure what purpose the tee serves here):

$ sed -re 's/^.*[.@]([^.]+\.[^.]+)$/\1/' < names.txt > domain.txt

If not every line will actually be an address, you can only pull out the
ones that are:

$ sed -nre '/@/ { s/^.*[.@]([^.]+\.[^.]+)$/\1/; p }' < names.txt \
  > domains.txt

If you had a handful of three-level domains that you also wanted to get
(like *.co.uk), you could use a more strict RE than /@/ and separate the
processes based on a match like /@.*(co.uk|or.us)/, etc.

Not to put a crimp on a perfectly good flame war,

but I wanted to share, as in freely give, What I've gotten working so far.
======================================
while read addr
do
   echo "$addr" | grep -o '[^.@]*\.[^.]*$'
done < domain.txt >> dom.txt
sort -fidu dom.txt >> dom2.txt
uniq  dom2.txt | less


=======================================

It's not pretty, or simple or do everything I want yet. BUT it does 
point the direction I'm headed


And on another note:

I have often found that being polite, even when one is criticized, is a 
far better speaker of the truth than to cast aspersions upon doubtful 
digressions. Many a lesson in manners have I forgotten, does it do me 
pride and honor to point out that short coming in another?
We have become too quick to leap to judgment than to quietly think and 
walk but a moment in the other persons shoes.  Perhaps it is OUR 
inability to see with clarity the mole hill, while trying to build the 
Mountain.
As Mike once said, better to hold your tongue and be perceived a fool.......


thanks to all for the help so far,


Harry

I just like cats, so I usually do:

  $ cat foo | cat | cat | cat | cat | ...

I modulated the number based on how I am feeling.  Besides, if you
don't get them fixed, they can multiply on you in a hurry!

So, start it with <filename.  No need to waste a process.

I even say that in my UUOC award.  Did you read the referenced URL?  No?

Keith responds:
Indeed, sir, you are correct.  The TSA screeners are aware of items like
cans and gas pumps (this is what they are looking for in your luggage),
while the OSU Kampus Kops are not capable of such awareness.  However,
a job with Homeland Security would an apotheosis for these people, and
such an offer would send them driving north :-) to Washington D.C. to
claim their prize.

Okay, Paul is the winner, he outlasted the others. However, as is proper 
in the Open Source community, I insist the wealth be spread around. I'm 
available Tuesday Night at either the Horse Brass or the Moon and Six 
Pence to repay my debt, let me know which is preferable.  I will send my 
recipe to any who ask for it (not HOT---Mild to spicy, I go for flavor 
not for heat, since my old worn out body can't take those fifty yard 
dashes down the trail to the box in the middle of the night) .
I'm trying a new Chili Verde recipe this week , But I have a dang good 
one for Red Chili and a good rub recipe for the BBQ men out there. This 
is competition style chili, not the stuff your elderly Aunt made in Boston.
And if anyone thinks they can stand the heat, I still have a few 
Habeneros in a jar of vinegar. The Vinegar is ALL I use from it.

BTW Paul,

My code came out looking :

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

while read addr
do
   echo "$addr" | grep -o '[^.@]*\.[^.]*$'
done < domain.txt >> dom.txt
sort -fidu dom.txt >> dom2.txt
uniq  dom2.txt
sort -fidu dom2.txt
rm dom.txt
mv dom2.txt Newdomain.txt
less Newdomain.txt

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I'm still not sure it's grabbing all the domains, but it's pretty close.
It pulls an almost Identical set as yours did.

Thanks Everyone for the Help.
One day I hope to be able to do this nearly as well as you do.

thanks,

Harry

Heck, cat's a builtin most of the time, innit?
Remainder of my argument elided, since it's purely about habit,
personal aesthetics and some finer points of *nix pedagogy.

It seems extremely nitpicky to criticize the use of cat instead of <
(Kinda like criticizing a mechanic for using a socket wrench when a
combo will do) so I figure I must be missing the point.

Perhaps you're confusing "cat" with "echo".  I've not seen a release
of something Unix-like where "cat" was a built-in.

But to me, a UUOC is a clue that the person is careless.  I'm trying
to remove being careless.

Hello all,

   In my continuing endeavor to get away from windoze, my next area of
interest is to access an MMC card in a USB card reader.  I have no idea
how to access it, and I would like to be able to read and write to it.

   Where do I start?

Mike,

   I've no idea what MMC is or does. However, a google search for "+mmc +usb
+linux" returned 516,000 hits. Among the topmost ones was this:
<http://www.opendrivers.com/driver/224131/tekram-dc-390u4b-dc-390u4w-driver-1.03-linux-free-download.html>

   Perhaps it is useful. Or, a beginning.

Sorry, I should have been more clear:

   An MMC is a multimedia memory card.  I have a card reader plugged
into a USB port.  I am running Debian Sarge.  Thanks for any help.

What distribution are you using?  What kernel version are you running?
 With newer distributions and kernel, USB card readers will usually
just work. Some like FC3, will even automount the drive on the
desktop.

Take a lookt at http://linuxusbguide.sourceforge.net for a good guide
to USB on Linux.

See what the system recognized the memory card as.  Mine usually assigns
sdc to the device, because I already have two SCSI drives.  I have seen
some systems mount MMC cards as IDE devices (hd[a-z] depending on how
many IDE devices you have already.)

My apologies to OSU campus security.

It finally made it through my own thick skull that abusing the
OSU campus police is a Really Stupid Idea.  I may have encountered
a few dumb officers, but I have not encountered everyone .  It may
be that the OSU police are burdened with hiring policies that force
them to hire a few inexperienced or thoughtless people; perhaps they
are busily retraining these people and trying to bring them up to
professional standards.  My sarcastic and broadbrush attack won't
help that process, and is totally uncalled for.  

My sarcastic postings will reside on the internet until the end of
time, both on the pdxlinux server and on archive.org and gmane, and
will pop up every time somebody runs a google search.    Forever.
While I expect Wil is clever enough to scrub them out of our archives,
that would be a bad precedent.  So, I've just created a bit of 
permanent damage to our cause.  I am 51yo, and I should know better
by now.  I've certainly reminded enough other people that attack
postings are childish; now it is time to remind myself.

I want to see open source succeed at OSU and at campuses elsewhere. 
The internal councils that make decisions about using open source
probably include representation from campus security, and insulting
them won't make them vote in our favor.  Further, campus security is
tasked with the physical integrity of Oregon State's Open Source Lab; 
I don't want annoyance to slow their response to a fire or a break-in.  

So, gentlefolk of the OSU campus security organization, my apologies.
This was my own stupid writing, and I'm sorry.  Please do not let it
darken your attitude towards the Portland Linux/Unix Group, the Open
Source Lab and its individual contributors, or Linux and open source
software in general.  These fine people are smarter than I am.

Keith

Debian Sarge Kernel version 2.4.26

I would also like to upgrade my kernel one of these days, but probably
save that for a Saturday clinic.

OK, FedEx Tracking says it's on the truck for delivery today. Yay!! 
Therefore I started doing some serious reading in the Suse 9.3 
books. (I decided not to return the box to Fry's). Several questions 
have come up that I hope you folks can help me with.

1) What file system should I use? The hard disk is 80 Gb, 5400 
rpm. My plan is to leave Windows XP in a 15 Gb partition, create a 
new 15 Gb partition for Suse 9.3, and leave the remainder as a 50 
Gb partition for data. Undoubtedly it will come from HP-Compaq 
with the whole thing as one 80 Gb C:\ drive in NTFS. According to 
the manuals Suse 9.3 can read NTFS, but not write to it. I read 
about Ext<x>, Reiser<x> and a couple other possibilities, but I 
didn't really understand the differences. If this were your laptop, 
which would you choose?

2) Does my plan of 15 Gb for Windows, 15 Gb for Suse 9.3, and 50 
Gb for data sound sensible? My plan is to leave enough space in 
the Windows and Suse 9.3 partitions so that I can also install all 
programs in them that I might want to run. (My Windows 2000 
desktop that I am writing this on has a 15 Gb Windows partition 
and over the past three years I have used 11 Gb.)

3) A related question, do I really have to boot XP first? I had 
planned never to boot it if possible. But the Suse 9.3 book says I 
must boot to Windows in order to run Scandisk and Defrag to move 
the files to the front of the drive, and also to disable the swap file. 
Otherwise the NTFS partition cannot be resized. Is this true? Do I 
have any other options?

4) I know that in XP the user can disable the touchpad. I plan never 
to use it. I have purchased instead a Logitech USB optical scroll 
mouse to use with the new laptop. Can I disable the touchpad later 
after I have Linux installed? Or should this be done during 
installation?

Thanks in advance for advice!

Ext3.  I'm conservative with these things, and I think the advantages
of the other filesystems won't matter on a laptop.

Sure.  And have a separate swap partition at least 2x your RAM size so
it'll be easier to suspend-to-disk, even if you upgrade the RAM later.

Since you're getting the system with a fresh install, you don't have
to boot XP.  Typically, it comes with the XP installer in a FAT32
partition, and the first time you boot it up, it runs an install and
converts the partition to NTFS.  

FAT32 is much easier to shrink down and rearrange than NTFS, so don't
let it do the install/conversion.  Just use GNU partedit or something
to shrink down the partition, save the boot sector to a file somewhere
(dd if=/dev/hda of=bootsect.win bs=512 count=1) and install GRUB.

I dunno.  I wouldn't worry about it, especially since you might forget
or lose the mouse later and find yourself using the touchpad anyway.

Enjoy the new toy,

I just wanted to chime in and say I agree with Aaron on this. Me too :)

Ext3 is very stable and I think it's an excellent choice for a standard
desktop or laptop workstation. There are advantages to some of the other
filesystems that could be valuable in some specific situations, but in
general I like to stick to ext3.

I have the same two pointing devices.  You'll be able to configure all
this later.  In fact, you needn't disable your touchpad at all.  The two
will actually work simultaneously.  Good for me, since if I unplug my
USB mouse, linux loses track of it, and to recover it I have to kill X,
rmmod mousedev, insmod mousedev and then restart X.  But the touchpad
always works.

Omigod, Santa just came!!!! <Jumping up and down!!!>

OK, thanks for the comments and suggestions so far. You guys 
are great!

I just opened the box and have it all sitting here. I managed to get 
the Suse 9.3 DVD-1 in the drive and got it to boot to it. Suse 9.3 
autodetected everything! (Well, everything I need for now -- won't 
know about the wireless, the media card reader, modem, firewire 
and network stuff until later. Oh and thanks for the comment about 
the touchpad -- mine has an on-off switch too. So I'll just let it go 
ahead and install the drivers and stuff. And I plugged in the USB 
mouse too, and it sees that as well. Both are working in the 
installation. The reason I was concerned about the touchpad is 
because I hate them. When I am typing it's impossible to keep my 
thumbs off the thing, so the cursor is always flying around 
unexepectedly. But I'll just turn it off. Cool design feature, Compaq!

I'd let it just go ahead and install, except I have a problem with 
partitioning. I'm going to take your advice as to EXT3, even though 
the installer is suggesting Reiser, but I am confused about 
something else.

Evidently HP-Compaq installed Windows XP Home in a 20 Gb 
partition, using NTFS. At least, that is what Suse 9.3's installer 
sees (it actually reports it as "HPFS/NTFS"). However, it may be 
still FAT32, because the installer seems to be willing to resize it for 
me. The entire hard disk is 80 Gb, which the installer sees as 74.5 
Gb. I'm assuming that 74.5 Gb is what is left after formatting.

To restate my plan -- I wanted Windows 15 Gb, Linux 15 Gb, and 
the remainder of the disk for data. The data partition can also be 
EXT3, because if, for some reason, I end up having to use 
Windows, I can back up all the data (my desktop has a tape drive), 
let Windows recreate it as NTFS and then restore the data. I'm 
pretty sure that will never be necessary, though. 

Oh, and I didn't realize that Linux needed a separate partition for 
swap. The computer has 1 Gb RAM and the installer suggested a 
1 Gb partition, so that should be drive E, I suppose. Thus I would 
end up with:

C  15 Gb (Windows, NTFS)
D:  15 Gb (Linux, EXT3)
E:  1 Gb (Linux swap, EXT3)
F:  43.5 (Data, EXT3)

But I am having trouble getting the installer to do this, mostly due 
to the fact that I don't understand the terminology. The manuals 
that came with Suse 9.3 are generally good, but the indexes suck. 
For example, on the installation screen I see "Crypt File," but I 
can't find an explanation of what that means. Another mysterious 
button says "LVM." And lots of the screens keep asking for mount 
points and ending points. I can guess what mounting and ending 
points are, but how am I supposed to know where I want them in 
order to get the partitions the size I want them to be?

I'm so excited!!

I use ext2 for the boot partition and reiserfs for everything else. I've
been doing this for over 6 years and I've had zero problems. Yeah, ext3
has more recovery modes, but most of the recovery CDs can handle
reiserfs and I haven't needed them (recovery CDs) for filesystem
problems, so why mess with success?

I'm getting ready to install an 80G drive in my notebook now, and
thinking about a partitioning scheme that will allow me to run Windog in
some form (VMWare? WINE? dual boot?).

I have an old Compaq notebook with a 6G drive, and it runs XP Pro just
fine. So I might just reserve 7G for Windog and make one partition
FAT32 so it can be used from both Linux and XP.

The only real partitioning religion I have (and this is  fairly new and
therefore subject to change) is that I require a /tmp partition mounted
with at least noexec (just like my servers). I like to use a 'normal'
partitioning scheme on notebooks even though it wastes a little space
just to be consistent with my servers.

I think Partition Magic can resize NTFS partitions even if they're not
defragged. But I'm not sure on that.

I like my touchpad, though I also like using a mouse. It depends on
whether I'm on a plane (no yard for the mouse to play in) or at my desk
or in a cafe (with plenty of space to roll a mouse).

Over the weekend I used a Knoppix disk with Qtparted to partition my laptop hard drive which I had been running XP on for a few years.  The entire disk was NTFS before I started.

(now of course it has a huge ext3 part, linux swap, and will soon be running Gentoo or Debian...)

Subject: [PLUG] resolv.conf -> dhcpd.conf
Message-ID: <20050509212718.GI30856@bavariati.org>

OK, so I'm setting up a NAT router thingy on a box that runs FC2 and
another application.  So one interface sits on the internet and gets
its address and DNS info via a DHCP client.

Other interface is inside, and serves DHCP to that network.

I'm trynta come up with some way to grab the DNS servers from
resolv.conf, and pass them along to the clients on the inside.  

My clever idea was to use some kind of data expression in dhcpd.conf
to read them directly from resolv.conf, but it looks like DHCPd won't
do that.

So my not-as-clever idea was to write a sed script to pull all the
"nameserver x.x.x.x\n" lines from resolv.conf, strip out all but x.x.x.x,
chain them together with commas and write it to /etc/dhcpd.conf's
"option domain-name-servers x.x.x.x, y.y.y.y;" line.

But I've only gotten as far as getting from: 
   search bavariati.org
   nameserver 65.19.174.2
   nameserver 65.19.175.2
   nameserver 65.19.176.2
to
   65.19.174.2
   65.19.175.2
   65.19.176.2
using
   sed -n "/^nameserver/{s/\(^.*\) \(.*\)/\2/ ; h }; g ; p" 
   
Help?

Thanks,

I just went through this with a new Dell Inspiron 6000 last week with SuSE 
9.2. I have a 80GB hard disk and there is a 4.4GB FAT32 partition and the 
rest of the disk was NTFS. I ran the SuSE installer and it was going to 
shrink down the size of the NTFS partition, create an extended partition 
where it would then create a swap and ReiserFS partitions for SuSE.

I didn't like that it was going to shrink down the NTFS partition to 15GB and 
so I did my own partitioning. In the end I ended up with an extended 
partitiom with a 1GB swap and 24GB ext3 partition. I haven't bothered looking 
yet to see what the 4.4GB FAT partition is that Dell creates. 

Could be some sort of recovery image. Dell provides an option on the XP Start 
menu that allowed to burn a recovery disk but I couldn't tell where it was 
grabbing the data for the CD image from. Unfortunately for compatibility with 
some people at work I need to keep XP around on my laptop although I'm 
booting it very infrequent after only a week.

In retrospect I should have created a small FAT32 partition to allow me share 
files with WinXP if needed. SuSE does mount my NTFS partition read-only and 
so I can access XP files. Only down side is if I wanted to change something 
under Linux I have no way to get it back to XP. 

I did manage to get the Intel 2915 WIFI and Intel 915GM graphics adapter 
running and so this laptop is working out quite nicely with Linux. My only 
grip with Linux is that is needs a better way to manage WIFI connections more 
like WinXP does. 

I've tried KWIFIManager under SuSE but it doesn't seem to be able to save any 
working profile information. I look out 
in /opt/kde3/share/apps/wifimanagerrcconfig and the file doesn't contain any 
of the WIFI information I entered through the KWIFIManager config panel. It's 
not a big deal since I really only need it for WEP protected networks.

For accessing WPA protected networks I use the "wpa_supplicant" daemon. It has 
it's own configuration file and will go through my list of networks in its 
configuration file and automatically create an association between my laptop 
and an access point. It can supposedly handle WEP as well but apparently the 
Intel "ipw2200" has a few issues still which keeps WEP from working with the 
"wpa_supplicant" daemon.  If I need to use WEP I use the network 
configuration screen in "YaST2" to setup the SSID and encryption keys for a 
WEP network.

Is the NAT/router box not connected to the same ISP all of the time? Is there 
any reason you cannot just hardcode the IP addresses of the ISP's DNS ? For 
my own NAT box I went so far as to setup BIND9 and have it forwarding lookups 
to Comcast's nameservers for any hosts it doesn't know about.

Unfortunately, the box may get installed at different sites, so I
can't count on a particular set of DNS servers.

That's not a bad way to do things, but I'm leery about adding a
caching name server to the setup.  I'm trying to keep it simple and
transparent as possible and avoid disturbing the existing config at
the site.

How about running a local-cache name server listening only on the inside 
interface of your NAT router thingy?

OK, a clever coworker showed me how to do it in Perl, a language

I went to OSU, and the campus police were "legendary".   They were
often the target of practical jokes, and the particular focus of the
residents of second-floor Weatherford, known as the "Nads". 

For example, the time that the Nads stole the water fountain from the
Corvallis police department, and left it in the corner of the outer office
of the Campus police - where it stayed, unconnected and nonfunctional, for
months, as the Kops waited for Facilities to connect it (the little
"Property of the City of Corvallis" tag apparently exceeded their reading
abilities).

Their police radios never worked.  They always ended up with blown
transmitters.  One of the Nads had this pesky habit of reaching up inside
the fender to the antenna mount with a length of wire and alligator clips,
shorting the whip to the fender.  The shorting wire would typically fall off
as they sped back to the Kop Shop to report their dead radio.  They never
figured this out.  Perhaps the tradition continues today.

The snow-covered "volkswagon" stalled on the railroad tracks running through
campus during a snowstorm was a nice touch.  When a westbound freight came
through campus (yes, the main freight tracks ran through the campus), the
Kampus Kops called for an emergency stop of the locomotive, while they
pondered how to move the stalled vehicle off the tracks.  The Nads solved
the problem, by running out to kick the volkswagon-shaped snow sculpture to
pieces.

That was 30 years ago.  Last year we were at OSU to watch the human powered
vehicle race at DaVinci days.  The race went west down Campus Way, a narrow
street that necks down to one lane in places. 
A brilliant Kampus Kop decided to watch the oncoming race with her Kop Kar
blocking the lane,  so the oncoming vehicles had to divert over curbs and
onto the sidewalk to avoid collisions.


So I do not believe that OSU Campus Security would be capable of detecting
the existence of students painting the quad at night. And if the cops did
somehow manage to notice, they could easily be neutralized with donut-laden
mousetraps, or phony job offers from the Department of Homeland Security.

One reason is, if I'm not mistaken, ext3 is a "journaling" file system,
whereas ext2 is not.  So there's less chance of corruption, and if you
should ever crash, ext3 will not have to scan your partition when you
reboot.

That'd be my way.  I'd allocate a little less for the main Win' part',
though, just enough for the core OS and maybe a few app's.  Then make
that FAT part' bigger, and install Windose app's on it as needed.  This
way, if you never use much Win' software, you won't have much wasted
space that you can't access from Linux.

OK, it took a couple hours of struggling, poking at menus, reading 
the book I bought for Fedora Core 3 (because the Suse manuals 
suck), and even calling Suse technical support, but I finally got the 
partitioning sorted out and it all worked. At least I think so. It's 
installed!!

Impressive feature: When it was configuring stuff at the end it 
paused at each item so I could click continue or skip. When it got 
to Internet I quickly grabbed a patch cord for my home 10/100 
network, which is connected via a router to the cable modem. I 
stuck one end in an empty slot in the hub and the other in the 
R4000, and told it to go ahead. It did it!!!!!

It even went out and found Suse's patch file site and asked if I 
wanted to apply all patches since my package had been shipped. I 
let it go ahead. Then I fired up Firefox and went to the university 
and checked my mailbox. Man, I remember when I got cable about 
a year and a half ago struggling to set up the modem, router and 
hub, and the software firewall that I use on my Windows 2000 
computer. I fully expected setting up the internet to be a major 
pain, and it I'm impressed.

However, it can't find my other computer. It may be because of the 
software firewall on it. I'll fiddle with that later.

And there is (as I feared) a problem with the video. It should be 
running at 1280 x 800. Instead it is 1024 x 768, vesa. I right-clicked 
on the desktop and went into settings, but that's the only resolution 
option. I think I remember someone here or in the R3000 e-list 
saying that he had a problem with the ATI Radeon Xpress 200 and 
how he resolved it. I'll research that later.

I don't know if ACPI is working. I think I remember seeing "ACPI" 
flash by during one of the times when a lot of text was scrolling by 
in the setup. I need to figure out to to tell.

Also don't know if the firewire is working, as I have no firewire 
devices. And no wireless here, so also can't tell if that is working. 
Also haven't tried the card reader yet. The only card I have is one 
that came with my digi. I'll try it later tonight. And it found the 
faxmodem, so I assume it configured it and all is well. I don't have 
anyone to fax anything to, so no way to test it yet.

Sound is working. And I put a symphony CD in the drive and it 
popped up KsCD and started playing it. However, there is a 
problem with the volume. With the volume control in KsCD and the 
volume control on the system tray both at 100%, it is about one 
quarter as loud as it should be for normal listening. I'm not sure 
what is wrong. Also, I paused the play, but it doesn't stay paused. 
It goes back to playing after a few minutes. I tried the Stop button 
instead, but when I click on Play it goes back to the beginning 
instead of resuming. Night be a KsCD problem.

And I discovered something that totally sucks and about Suse 
Linux 9.3. Tech support. When I called tech support I got a guy I 
could barely understand. He was trying to explain what "HDA" was, 
but he kept saying "HDE." Finally, in frustration, I asked to speak 
to someone else. But the next guy had the same weird accent. 
Scots I think. Very hard to understand. And when I got the next 
guy he said he was not going to help me partition my drive and 
hung up on me. So it's a German company, owned by an American 
company, with tech support in Scotland and and attitude from Hell.

If anyone has any suggestions about the video or the sound 
volume, let me know. In the meantime, I'm going to keep poking at 
it.

Thanks for all the help and suggestions so far!

   I agree that UUOC should be avoided if interferes with the

I'll vote for ext3 over Reiserfs for two reasons:

1. Partition Magic supports ext3
2. Parted supports ext3

There are hacked/patched versions of "parted" and its libraries that
pretend to support Reiserfs. That way lies file corruption. Sure, you're
going to back stuff up before you re-partition, but why waste the extra
time?

ReiserFS is also a journaling file system, along with jfs and xfs.  In 
some circumstances (which I can't remember off the top of my head right 
now) ReiserFS performs better than ext3, but not in a manner that you 
will be able to notice on a laptop hard drive.

I believe up until recently ReiserFS didn't support the extended 
attributes used by SELinux, so I don't know if SuSE Pro 9.3 has a 
version that supports it.  However, if memory serves me, SuSE doesn't 
ship with SELinux turned on anyway.

I am not familiar with ATI cards, since I'm an Nvidia guy, but my laptop 
has an 1280x800 display, and it is not supported by the standard X 
configuration tools (I run FC3).  The only distro I've used that 
detected and configured it right the first time was Ubuntu.  I would 
suggest Googling for something like "Radeon 1280x800 xorg.conf" and look 
for people who have set it up.  It will probably involve hand editing 
your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file, though perhaps Yast is better at adding 
custom stuff than Fedora's tools.

Modern linux distributions use the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture 
(ALSA) for sound, which has separate mixer settings for a whole bunch of 
stuff, including CD and PCM (MP3/OGG/whatever digital audio).  Open the 
volume control and look for the CD mixer, it's probably set way low.

Hope that helps, perhaps someone more familiar with SuSE and KDE can 
chime in a bit.

I recently found myself needing to compute the results of the Bessel

I was able to write the bessel function in 8 lines of Common Lisp.
Furthermore, in byte-compiled CLISP exact results took only twice as

numerically unstable one third of the way through the range I was
interested in (x from 0 to 100 by 0.1).

Let me see another language do as well.

Bessel functions used to be in the UNIX C libraries (from day one, as I
recall, UNIX being developed on the same campus as hundreds of
world-class communications engineers. :) Have they been removed in the
Linux libraries?

And as long as you're going to use LISP, why not use Maxima, which is
written in LISP and has the Bessel functions built in?

OK, here is what I know and what I have recently figured out. First, 
there is an e-list for the Compaq R3000 series, the predecessor to 
my R4000. They all have 15.4 inch wide screens. Everyone on the 
list has no problem running at 1280 x 800, although sometimes 
they have to do something manually. However, with the R4000 line 
Compaq switched from the Nvidia video they used in the R3000 to 
the ATI Radeon Xpress Pro 200. That's the source of my problem.

However, I know I read somewhere about someone doing it. I just 
can't find it now that I need it. But later today I'll use your google 
suggestion and keep looking.

Last night I was chatting on IRC with a Linux guru. He wanted me 
to find the xorg.conf file, but it's not on this computer. Also, a lot of 
the bash commands he told me to use did not work. "Locate" and 
"slocate" just gave me "unknown command." He also wanted me 
to find the XF86Config file. Using the GUI file finder I finally found it. 
But when I opened it, it turned out to be a binary file. Evidently 
there is supposed to be a text file somewhere, but the binary is all I 
could find. By the end of our conversation he was expressing 
certain feelings about Suse. :)

Aaah! That helps. Went in and fiddled with the sliders in the mixer 
(which I didn't even know was in there). Sound all good now. 

Except the Pause button on KsCD still doesn't stay paused. Oh 
well, I'll deal with that later.

It's possible that locate and slocate are not there. They just may not
have been chosen to be installed. I can't believe SUSE would not have a
version of one of them available somehow.

They may also be there but not in your PATH.

If you can't get to one of them you can always use the "find" command. It
searches the filesystem live, so it's slower that locate, but it's also
more accurate. If you add or remove files on the filesystem, locate will
not see them until its database is updated.

You may have been looking at a symbolic link to the actual file. If you go
to that directory in a shell (not through the GUI) and do an "ls -l", you
will see where the symlink points to.

I think you'll be looking for the fglrx (FireGL RX) driver for X.
Ubuntu has it in the Multiverse archive as xorg-server-fglrx.  Maybe
SuSE has it under similar name.

Good luck,

Coincidentally, it's called Linux on Laptops, and the URL is 
http://www.linux-laptop.net/

There's information on SuSE on an R3000, and I'm sure others.

I have an HP laptop and found that there was a tremendous amount of 
cross-over for the configuration between my HP and several Compaq models.

I went through this when I manually upgraded SuSE 9.2 to X.org 6.8.2 packages 
so I could get the Intel 915GM adapter working on my Dell Inspiron 6000. I 
use "Sax2" to configure X and it modifies /etc/X11/XF86Config but the new 
X.org packages I installed look at /etc/X11/xorg.conf instead. It took me a 
few tries to figure out why my changes were not being picked up when they 
looked great in the Sax2 preview screen.

My workaround was to make a symbolic link named /etc/X11/xorg.conf that points 
to /etc/X11/XF86Config.

The latest version of Mandrake (what would have been 10.2), known as Mandriva 
2005LE does support it. Current stuff for LCDs is: 1024x768, 1280x1024, 
1280x800, 1400x1050, 1440x900 (which is what I run), 1600x1200, 1680x1050, 
1920x1200, 640x480, and 800x600. Something for everyone.

You can download ISOs or use bittorrents by joining the MandrivaClub (various 
levels, ranging from free to expensive - I've been a Silver Club level for 
years) at: http://www.mandrivaclub.com/

I just gave a copy of the latest Mandriva disks to someone who had never tried 
Linux before and they said that it was easier to set up than Windows. Good 
stuff.

OMG!  I *did* look, but obviously was searching the wrong way (looking
for "bessel" in the function index).  It'll be interesting to see how
it does on accuracy and range though.  Glibc info pages indicate:

     `j0' returns the Bessel function of the first kind of order 0 of
     X.  It may signal underflow if X is too large.

My Lisp implementation doesn't.

But thanks for the clue stick!

Ron,

Thanks to you and all the others here with their suggestions. 

I've just discovered something. Suse 9.3 seems to have installed 
itself all over my computer. I KNOW I told it to use HDa2 (15 Gb), 
but it seems to be in HDa4 (44 Gb), which I had reserved for my 
own files. (HDa3 is a 2 Gb swap disk and HDa1 is the still 
untouched Windows installation.)

Before I forget, is there a file manager that shows the partition you 
are looking at? Every time I use Konqueror it just shows folders. I 
have no idea where I am. You know the old file manager that came 
with Windows 3.0 and 3.1? Something like that, showing all the 
partitions and their folders in a tree-like text-only window (suffering 
from icon overload here).

And while I'm on that subject, I need some education about the 
different folders. Like /etc, /usr, and so on. I understand the need 
for short names back in the days when everything had to be typed, 
but I have no idea what those folders mean or what is supposed to 
be in them. Or where I am supposed to install programs. Or where 
my own data files are supposed to go. Is there a beginner's intro to 
Linux folder conventions somewhere? Something I could print out 
and tape up on the wall here would be handy.

I think I'm going to have to wipe out Suse 9.3 and reinstall. It's the 
only way I can think of to get it out of my data partition and into the 
partition I want it in. And, considering my current frustration with 
Suse 9.3, I'm open to suggestions for something else. I have 
Fedora Core 3 here on DVD and CD with the Sam's "unleashed" 
book I got down at Powell's. But if Mandriva will recognize the 
Radeon Xpress 200 and set it up at 1280 x 800 like it is supposed 
to be, maybe that would be a better choice.

And how do I get rid of Suse? Parts of it are in the small partition it 
was supposed to be in, but I think it's just empty folders in there. 
The rest is in the big partition. Should I just format them both? I 
know Windows would scream bloody murder if you tried to format 
the drive it's on -- you have to do it from a boot floppy with format or 
fdisk or something.

Man, I wish the next Clinic meeting was tonight! Only at the rate 
I'm going I'd need a whole Clinic _weekend_ to get this thing 
working right! And by the time it was over you guys would be ready 
to throw my computer off the Marquam bridge and me after it. :(

The only way?  Why not just move or copy the files (then edit 
your /etc/fstab) to make it the way you want it?  This could be tricky 
if you're new, but post some details and the list can tell you how to 
do it.

Basically, you just need to understand the way *nix sees the filesystem 
as one tree with devices mounted on it.  Once everything is mounted, it 
doesn't matter which device the stuff is on.

In particular, your current /etc/fstab would be good to see.

SuSE is quite annoying if you want to do command line work. It's 
possible to install the tools, it just doesn't by default. Were you a 
more command line oriented person you'd find an abundance of missing 
things (though I could complain that Gentoo doesn't give you lspci 
without installing pciutils... makes sense but dang stupid).

Sort of like Gentoo not providing a vi clone in the base system. Doh!

Here's a nickel's worth:  have patience.  ;)  The unix file system
conventions are--to borrow from Douglas Adams--almost, but not quite,
entirely unintuitive.  They'll take a little while to learn.  For now,
just know that /etc is where most things are configured system-wide.

Many linux installers provide options for selecting which partitions
should be formatted upon installation.  So you should be able to just
pop in an install CD and redo/reformat your partitions as needed during
installation.

I just got home from having root canal and I'm not really too with it, so 
please bear that in mind.

I am not aware of any file browser that shows which partition the current 
directory is in (anyone else know of one?), but that is sort of antithetical 
of the nature of *nix. The original idea of Unix that is pretty much still 
the case in Linux (and other Unii) is that /everything/ is a file. When Sun 
shared NFS (Network File System) with the world back in the early 80's, that 
allowed it to use the marketing slogan, "The network is the computer." And 
having to be aware of "where" you are, whether its which partition you are on 
or which computer you are on at gets in the way of the goal of portable code.

Yes indeedy do! Please go to The Linux Documentation Project 
(http://www.tldp.org/) and read away. Another wonderful resource is The Linux 
Tutorial (http://www.linux-tutorial.info/) that should answer many of your 
questions.

And there is this list, PLUG, which is filled with many wonderful people who 
are anxious to help. Some of them have been doing Linux for so long, they 
have forgotten that newbies don't always know all of the acronyms. Be patient 
with them (us) and they (we) will be patient with you.

Well, I have used many of the different distros (I won't bother enumerating 
them) and I end up always coming back to Mandrake for my laptop machines. 
When it comes to running a server, I personally think Debian is a better 
choice, but for desktops and /especially/ laptops, Mandrake, er, Mandriva is 
the Bomb.

BTW, the reason that Mandriva gives for the name change is that they merged 
with Connectiva, the largest South American distro and so they combined the 
names (Mandrake is based in France). The real reason is that the comic 
syndicate that owns the rights to the Mandrake the Magician comic strip sued 
them to stop using the name. Tacky.

When you install Mandrake, the (very nice) partition manager will do that work 
for you.

I haven't been to the Clinic for years (the same is true of probably most of

Mandriva 2005LE for you if you will agree to share them with others. Drop me

There's a nice page or two on the subject in Essential System 
Administration.  If you don't have that, you should get it and read it... 
twice.  At least read it once now and again in six or eight months after 
you've been doing things your way for a while and have some of your own 
mental constructs in place.

Your own data files are all in /home and that's mostly where they belong. 
I personally keep a /usr/local/public where data files are stored that 
everyone's going to access (like music and movies).

The way I run things, I never ever touch anything but /home, /usr/local, 
and /etc (and only there to modify configuration files).  Everything else, 
I sacrifice to St. Debian.  I build software in /usr/local/src for 
installation in /usr/local... etc.

And at some point or another, everything needs to be typed.

I'm trying to get into an external Seagate enclosure to get at the 
tasty innards inside: a 100GB 2.5" laptop drive. The case is fastened 
shut with four Torx Plus Tamper Resistant (aka Security Torx Plus) 
screws. These look just like Torx screws except instead of a six-point 
pattern, they have a five point pattern.

I think it takes an IPB 8 or IPB 10 sized bit that looks like this: 
http://www.wihatools.com/716_IPR_serie.htm

I'd actually like to reuse the case, but I'm getting so frustrated that 
the hacksaw is starting to sound like a good idea. Grr.

The general public isn't allowed to buy these bits (see: "Tamper 
resistant"). Does anyone on the list have access to these buggers? I'd 
love to borrow them for an evening to perform the laptop <---> 
enclosure HD swap. I suspect that upon return, your bits or 
screwdrivers might come with tasty, tasty beer as well.

Thanks,
Joshua

PS I think any ~2mm 5-point star-shaped bits will work, regardless of 
brand. If you have a non-Torx one, I'll all ears.

vi is present even on the minimal Gentoo *install* CD when you boot up.
Once you chroot and start working in your Gentoo install, it' s not
there any more, even in a stage3 install. When I do a stage3 install,
the first thing I do in the install script that runs at chroot time is
install vi off of the package CD. :) But yeah, it ought to be in the
stage3 tarball if it's on the boot CD.

Easy, now.  For personal machines, I keep most of my data files *out* of
~/, because ~/ always becomes cluttered with configurations.  On these
machines, I consider /home essentially a user-level /etc.  That's just
me, but I like to think it's a legitimate way of doing things.

Yeah ... ~/ does get a lot of config files. I usually create directories

I'm unsure about those actually being Torx. The Torx security bits are
the Torx shaped screws with the post in the center. These in turn need a
Torx bit with the end drilled out.

Merely need to hacksaw/drill the screws, and then the case can be kept.

One source is EBay. Locally Norvac has some types of security bits. They
had a set with the drilled-Torx and tri-wing bits. I'm unsure about them
having the five-pointed bit you're looking at.

Galen,

   I'm not sure I understand the problem. Within your equation you have a
fraction, yes? You can cut the numerator out, paste it where you want it
(e.g., prior to or following the fraction), then delete the fraction within
it's blue-lined box.

   What's not working?

   Can you provide an example .lyx file that illustrates the problem?

Reiser performs better for LOTS of small files, XFS performs better for
VERY large files, ext3 holds the middle ground of performance.  Here's
some numbers from a brief google search for filesystem benchmarking...

           reiser4   reiserfs       ext3        XFS        JFS

copy     33.39,34%  39.55,32%  39.42,25%  43.50,32%  48.15,20%

sync      1.54, 0%   3.15, 1%   9.05, 0%   2.08, 1%   3.05, 1%

recopy1  31.09,34%  75.15,13%  79.96, 9% 102.37,12% 108.39, 5%

recopy2  33.15,33%  77.62,13%  98.84, 7% 108.00,12% 114.96, 5%

sync      2.89, 3%   3.84, 1%   8.15, 0%   2.40, 2%   3.86, 0%

du        2.05,42%   2.46,21%   3.31,11%   3.73,32%   2.42,17%

delete    7.41,52%   5.22,58%   3.71,39%   8.75,56%  15.33, 7%

tar      52.25,25%  90.83,12%  74.93,13% 157.61, 7% 135.86, 6%

sync      6.77, 2%   4.19, 3%   1.67, 1%   0.95, 1%  38.18, 0%

overall 171.28,30% 302.53,16% 319.71,11% 429.79,13% 470.88, 6%

As you can see Reiser4 is the fastest by far and XFS the next to slowest. 
However if you change the test criteria to include very large files,
then XFS will start showing better times.

Add here's an article with enough graphs to make you dizzy, this one checks 
a large number of common tasks against several file systems.

I've been trying to delete the denominator by moving the cursor to
various places and then hitting the delete key.  My experience has been
that this deletes the entire fraction.  Okay, I should have known that I
could use cut and paste.  However, I'm surprised that there isn't an
easier way.

I hope this isn't useless info, but can you edit the Latex directly? 
There should be an \frac{numerator}{denominator} in there.

I really just can't use Lyx.  I type LOTS of equations and it's just 
easier to do it raw.

Speaking of which... I should probably start a new thread, but my 
documents don't seem to be using true scalable fonts by the time I make a 
PDF.  What gives?

How about cutting a slot in the head with a small cut-off wheel, like
those used on a Dremel-like device.  Then a good old fashioned slotted
screwdriver will be able to remove and replace the screws?

Just a thought,

I'm trying to get into an external Seagate enclosure to get at the
tasty innards inside: a 100GB 2.5" laptop drive. The case is fastened
shut with four Torx Plus Tamper Resistant (aka Security Torx Plus)
screws. These look just like Torx screws except instead of a six-point
pattern, they have a five point pattern.

I think it takes an IPB 8 or IPB 10 sized bit that looks like this:
http://www.wihatools.com/716_IPR_serie.htm

I'd actually like to reuse the case, but I'm getting so frustrated that
the hacksaw is starting to sound like a good idea. Grr.

The general public isn't allowed to buy these bits (see: "Tamper
resistant"). Does anyone on the list have access to these buggers? I'd
love to borrow them for an evening to perform the laptop <--->
enclosure HD swap. I suspect that upon return, your bits or
screwdrivers might come with tasty, tasty beer as well.

Thanks,
Joshua

PS I think any ~2mm 5-point star-shaped bits will work, regardless of
brand. If you have a non-Torx one, I'll all ears.

  I've removed bolts like that in the past with needle-nose pliers or

Novell bought Immunix.  Novell stock went up 7 cents the same day, so 
given perfect causality :-) the purchase increased their value by $26M.
While I would have preferred to see Immunix grow large and buy Novell,
this is OK.  Novell bought Ximian and Suse, and hired Greg Kroah-Hartman,
and sold Caldera-SCO, so this is quite a compliment all around.

I'm pretty sure Novell never sold Caldera-SCO as they never owned it to 
begin with.

Yeah, it sounds like John is very new, I'm not sure this would be a great
plan for him. Reinstalling might be a better bet if he has not spent a lot
of time doing post-install config stuff.

John, it seems like you are really anxious to get things rolling, but one
thing you might consider is putting on the brakes for a bit and bringing
your laptop and install media to the next PLUG clinic.

It looks like the next clinic should be on the 21st.

Yes, I have been using Linux for about a week now. I understand 
about not being in a hurry, but I'm learning a lot just poking at stuff. 
I will definitely come to the Clinic on the 21st. I've had a big red 
circle around that date on my calendar for several days now. But I 
suspect getting the video right may be challenging even for you 
gurus. In the meantime, I intend to install some different packages. 
Not just to see if they can handle the video better, but also for the 
experience of trying different distros. Like, I already tried Fedora 
Core 3 yesterday from the DVD that came in the book I bought at 
Powell's. Unfortunately, the installation froze the computer 1 
minutes after I started it. I tried several more times, but it always 
froze the computer at exactly the same spot. Next on my list are 
Mandriva and Ubuntu.

I'm also spending time getting up to speed with Linux applications 
and utilities, like being able to play a music CD and stuff. Tonight 
I'm going to try a movie DVD. Tomorrow I'm going to take it to the 
university to see if the wireless works. There's a lot of stuff to do 
besides getting the video working right.

Hi,

He might be thinking of Digital Research which Novell did sell to Caldera
(pre-SCO). Caldera used IP from Digital Research to sue Microsoft and get a
nine figure out of court settlement. With this new business model, Caldera
bought SCO and sued IBM but the new suit doesn't seem to as profitable :-)

Mike

Sure, I don't want to imply that you shoudln't do that. But the clinic can
be a good way to get a bit of a jumpstart.

I'm not sure. I think you've identified your card and chipset already, if
I remember right. In that case, definitely check and make sure it's on the
hardware compatability list for the distros you are trying.

Hi all,

When I first set up my DSL through Earthlink, I discovered that my DNS
resolution was very, very slow.  Earthlink wouldn't help me because I
was running FC2.  A friend sent me a list of nameserver IP addresses to
 add to my /etc/resolv.conf and that fixed the problem.

Today, the problem is back with a vengeance (at least, I assume  it's
DNS related).  I can surf and when I finally get to a page it loads
quickly and when I hit refresh it reloads quickly.  It's that initial
lag which is killing me.

How the heck do I diagnose issues like this?  More importantly, any
pointers on fixing them?

My iBook is running on the same network and it's not having any
problems.  (It's going through the wireless router which in turn is
connected to the Netopia DSL modem.  The FC2 box is connected directly
to the Netopia DSL modem).

Cheers,
Ovid

try doing a traceroute, ping -c1, and a 'host google.com $DNSSERVER a
bunch of times in a loop.

For instance, to see if you've got an intermittent latency issue, do 

for i in `seq 1 1000` ; do host google.com 155.101.246.110 ; done

and doing it with a ping, and traceroute will start to indicate if it
is an issue with response time of BIND on the server (or whatever it's
running), latency in the network, etc.

You might try disabling IPv6; that seems to do it for some:

echo "alias ipv6 off" >> /etc/modules.conf

I don't know if a reboot is necessary, but you almost certainly have to 
restart networking: /etc/init.d/network restart

strace and tcpdump are your two biggest friends when an application is 
misbehaving. In this case, the tcpdump solution might provide more 
interesting feedback.

In xterm #1, do (as root)

   tcpdump port 53

In xterm #2, do

   dig www.pdxlinux.org

The console spew will tell you what servers your resolver library is 
trying to use; the timestamps will tell you where the delay is happening 
(if you can't spot it during the run).

Thanks.  The "host google.com $DNSSERVER" always seems to return
immediately as does the "ping -c1 google.com".  However, the traceroute
on both my iBook and the FC2 box does this (from the Ibook):

13  vlan201-msr1.dcn.yahoo.com (216.115.96.163)  116.508 ms  134.078 ms
vlan221-msr2.dcn.yahoo.com (216.115.96.167)  118.578 ms

ge3-1.bas2-m.dcn.yahoo.com (216.109.120.146)  178.671 ms
ge6-1.bas2-m.dcn.yahoo.com (216.109.120.221)  104.433 ms
15  * * *
16  * * *
17  * * *
18  * * *
19  * * *
20  * * *
21  * * *

The last hop on the FC2 box:

  12  216.239.48.110 (216.239.48.110) ...

And then I start getting all of the * * * lines.

I've no idea what to make of this output.  Is there more info I can
send?

I still don't understand why this doesn't seem to affect the iBook.

google.com is likely to be in your cache.
Try host _some_weird_to_you_domain.tld 

Placed you may not have visited lately

  firsttechcu.com (if you don't bank there)
  patch.com
  ncube.com

I was a bit nervous about that since I don't have an /etc/modules.conf
(is that something specific to Fedora Core?), but I tried it and
restarted the network and the problem went away after I copied the
extra name server addresses into my /etc/resolv.conf file.

I'm going to have to make a note of that.  Thanks!

I've got to learn this stuff better, though.  Right now this just me
repeating a bunch of mystical incantations others have handed me.

OK, to clarify what I wrote, I was talking about reiserfs as the
'success' part. In fact, I just formatted the root and boot partitions
on my new HD with ext3.

I have to say, though, that I've never experienced a reiserfs failure
(though I've heard about a lot of them). I have, unfortunately,
experienced an ext3 failure. This is obviously too small a data set to
reach any conclusions, but it has affected my choice of filesystems in
the past. I'm giving ext3 a try now, but I'm also keeping regular
backups.

I expect that this will be the way I go. But I'm still doing some
research into my Windows-execution options.

Thanks.

Be careful though; turning off IPv6 will break some things.  The things
I know it breaks are OpenLDAP's slapd and Jabberd 1.4.  Probably okay if
you're not running either of those (or servers in general).

With 2.6 kernels (which is whave FC2 and 3 have), the preferred naming
is /etc/modprobe.conf.

It sounds like you have your problem resolved, but FYI, traceroutes are
unfortunately less useful than they used to be. In the old days you could
traceroute pretty much anywhere, but now many people filter ICMP at their
firewalls/routers. They do it to prevent ICMP DoS attacks, and also to
prevent people from gaining more information about their networks.

Traceroute is still pretty handy for looking at things like the path you
are taking through your ISP and then the Internet backbone, but once you
get to the network on the other end it may not tell you much more (which
seems to be what's happening in the example above).

You're probably thinking of dvips, not dvi2ps.  Or is dvi2ps a different

Message-ID: <42828E4A.2508.DA13241@localhost>

OK, I'm stupid, and this is slightly off-topic. I downloaded Ubuntu 
live CD ISO image and am trying to use it to boot my new Compaq 
R4000 (the AMD64 Live Image CD at 
http://us.releases.ubuntu.com/releases/5.04/).

I burned it to a CD. I did this on my Windows 2000 computer

has been set to boot first from the CD/DVD drive since the first

the BIOS. But the boot sequence igores the CD in the drive and

I just spent the past hour trying to figure out what I am doing

If you're using Nero, did you "Burn Image to Disc" or just burn a data 
cd and drag the ISO onto it?

You want to burn the ISO image to disc, not the file itself.

Under SuSE 9.x there's a KDE-based CD/DVD burning tool called "K3b". You can 
find it off of the main menu panel off of the KDE panel. Look inside the 
"Multimedia" menu. Once you have "K3b" running simply go to:

Tools->CD->Burn CD Image... 

A popup dialog will appear and you can select the ISO image file to burn to a 
CD. I'm assuming that SuSE has been able to correctly detect your CD-RW drive 
on your R4000 for this to work.

Tony

Yay! I looked all over and finally found "burn image to disk." I was 
using "CD-Boot." And it worked!

However, the live CD sort of hangs. It gets to a screen where I have 
to choose the language. "English" is selected by default. But the 
keyboard does not work, so I can't select it. There are things on 
the edge of the screen that look like they could be selected, but 
neither the touchpad nor my USB mouse are working either. I went 
back and tried all kinds of boot options, but nothing gets me past 
that screen. The keyboard does work at first; it's just when it gets 
to that screen when it's dead. I even tried "live 
DEBCONF_DEBUG=5" (which is supposed to be a verbose 
debugging process), but it made no difference. I was hoping for a 
debug process where it would pause the screen after each device 
and wait until I hit Enter before going on to the next item, but it still 
just zooms past.

Oh well. At least I now have a live Ubuntu boot CD. Maybe I'll try 
Knoppix next.

Are both your keyboard and mouse USB?  If so, it might just be the
udev config barfing on it.  Try setting the "Legacy USB Mode" (or
something similar) in your BIOS just to test it.  Of course, if they
are both USB and you can get into the BIOS, it is already enabled...

Can you get to a virtual console in the installer by pressing
ctrl-alt-F1 (through F6)?

I'm helping a non-profit in Hillsboro debug a network performance
problem. They are getting a dismal ~5kbps out of the their cable modem.

Everything *looks* ok on their server, with the exception of what seems
to be an unusual number of ARP packets coming out of the Comcast
network. I'm seeing between 25-100 ARPs per second[1]. I've never worked
with cable modems, is that normal?

I don't have any real suggestions, other than to say that I'm just
getting my feet wet with Zope, so you might want to take a look at it.

I've never done much web site content, but I'm trying to learn now,
sticking with XHTML 1.0 Strict, css (not tables) for positioning, etc.

Zope is built on python, so I'm working on learning that also, as I've
always been a Perl person.

I'll be interested to hear what other folks suggest. I've done some
screwing around with mason-perl, which I like a lot, but I tried
Bricolage and ended up very confused...

Best is subjective and it's hard to make a recommendation based upon 
your stated needs (postgres, tableless layouts, uncluttered look).  I 
like using wikis, modified to suit whatever layout/style I need.   Your 
requirements might be very different than mine though.

You might checkout http://www.cmsmatrix.org/ to get an idea of what 
features a bunch of CMSes have to help you narrow down your choices.

Based on no previous history with cable and remembering only anecdotal 
information,  the network infrastructure is bridged.  Considering the size 
of said cable companies deployment that may not be out of line.

Personally, I'd put a MS-windows box on the cable modem, call their tech 
support and make them work for you.

WebGUI.  Works with MySQL out of the box and if you surf through the
boards you'll see how people made it work with Postgres.

OK, there is definitely something screwy with the way Linux wants 
to treat the keyboard on this thing. I just downloaded and burned 
the live ISO for Knoppix 3.8 (thanks to Steven for pointing me in the 
right direction). I stuck the CD in the drive and restarted the 
compute. It worked *much* better than Ubuntu. Has a prettier 
screen than Suse, too. :)

It went ahead and automatically installed itself all the way, from the 
CD without installing to the hard disk. After it was fully running I 
clicked around on things and then I noticed the clock was wrong, 
so I went to adjust the time. Tried to enter my password, and the 
keyboard wouldn't work. Opened OpenOffice.org Writer and again, 
no keyboard. 

Also the touchpad is dead (worked under Suse 9.3), although my 
external Logitech USB wireless optical mouse is working fine. And 
the display just came up at VESA 1024 x 768. At least Knoppix 
lists two other options, 800 x 600 and 640 x 480, but still no 1280 
x 800. Screen display is faster under Knoppix, though. And the 
display is much more attractive -- 3D effects and shadows on icons 
and stuff.

I have no wireless here at home, so yesterday I took it to a friend's 
house. Her laptop was seeing her wireless fine, but when I booted 
Suse the wireless was dead. I just went into Knoppix network 
setup and clicked on "Wavelan." After a moment or two it popped 
up a message "no wireless card detected." So that's another 
problem I have to work on.

I kind of like Knoppix from what I am seeing -- at meast much more 
than Suse, which, after three days of it had become seriously 
annoying. Later this afternoon I think I'll install it in a new partition 
and then maybe I will play around with stuff to see if I can fix these 
problems.

Thanks for the suggestions!

That seems a bit excessive.  2-3 per second is normal for the Comcast
network segment I'm on.  I agree with Keith-- put an MS-Windows box
(even a laptop) on the network, verify that the symptoms follow it,
and call Comcast.

Just curious, I'm trying to get a bead on the scope of Knoppix.  I
understand it's raison d'etre is to boot from a CD, as a tool for linux
repair or demonstration.  Can it also be installed permanently, on one's
hard drive?  Is that a wise option?  I understand that linux is
basically linux is basically linux, so are there compelling reasons
_not_ to install Knoppix permanently?  Isn't it Debian-based?

Yes.  Comcast is a frigging ARP hurricane.

Don't take this as definitive, because I am not sure what *actually*
happened, but the time I did an HD install of Knoppix and then did a
few apt-get upgrades over the course of a week or two, it got wedged
pretty severely.  After that, I figured if I was going to install (and
I had the bandwidth available) I might as well just do a straight
Debian net-install which is a pretty easy, one-time thing.

Yes.  Boot under a knoppix CD (either in text or gui mode).  Then get a
shell and type "knx2hd".  This launches the installer.

Before you do this, fdisk your hard drive the way you want it and mke2fs
and mkswap as necessary.

Start the installer and go through the "configure setup".  Then choose
"save config".  Save the config to an easy-to-find spot.  Then exit the
installer and edit the file to suit your needs.  The installer does not
give you access to all the config options, which is why you want to do
this.

Then restart the instaler with "knx2hd" and choose "load config".  Load
your config, then immediately commence the installation.

You do not get to select packages.  You get what knoppix gives you,
period.  Once knoppix is up on your rooy filesystem, you want to apt-get
away everything but fluxbox and emacs (just my opinion).

Also, you'll want a revised sources.list:

Not sure this is a peak period, but for quantitative comparison,
running: 

  # time tcpdump -c 1000 -n arp
  [...]

  real    3m15.429s
  user    0m0.070s
  sys     0m0.070s

That works out to an average just over 5/second.

Seems a bit too much, but not by an order of magnitude. I get them at
a rate of about 20 per second, perhaps. Cable network is weird in this
regard: it's not routed, because you can see everyone's arp traffic,
but not simply bridged either because you can't see everyone's ip
traffic.

Subject: [PLUG] Network latency and percent usage practices.
Message-ID: <4283BC5C.1040308@tercent.com>

Hi folks,

When a retail ISP who buys bandwidth from someone like ELI has a 10MBit
connection, and they are operating at near capacity, e.g. 9700 kbps,
would that cause major latency (e.g. like 300 ms) at that retail ISP's
gateway to ELI?

For example, see the first graph at:

http://tercent.com/~rlucas/serial5-0-day.png

During times where that graph is almost at the "red" line, would that
indicate times where ping times might get throttled down from a usual
~80 ms to 300 ms+?

I'm trying more fully to understand how this issue might come about,
rather than bugging the ISP prematurely.  I don't know how these
agreements are usually strucutred (e.g. does the ELI-type player
typically let the extra traffic through but then bill, or slow down
traffic, or drop packets, or ???).

Best,

Randall

Likely, since whatever you're using to graph that utilization probably
does something like 5 minute averages. In the course of those five
minute periods, you're probably getting spikes that hit 100% of whatever
ceiling is imposed, and packets are dropped.

Could be any of those strategies, and it will depend on what you've
purchased and what they've actually configured. Check your contract...

Same here. The install was by far the easiest I've ever performed (of
any OS), but it simply would not 'apt-get upgrade' cleanly. I ended up
doing a regular Debian install, too.

Thanks, Carlos.  Actually, I wasn't asking for complete instructions (I
know where to find those).  I was just asking a high-level,
is-this-worthwhile sort of question.

(BTW, I didn't want to send this to the list, but I got an error sending

I'm not honestly sure how it would be affected by the router (whatever
is rate-limiting/QoS your connection). When this occurs in an
host-to-host TCP connection, and you hit the ceiling and drop/delay a
packet due to congestion the "old" way of Linux handling it was to cut
back your send rate by 50% immediately, and slowly scale up.

Newer kernels with TCP_BIC (2.6.8 and newer) use a smarter algorithm
that slowly scales back from peak until you stop congestion/start
getting ACK's in sync again with your transmit rate.

I don't have enough experience with the hardware in the middle to say
what its response to hitting your subscribed bandwidth cap would be. 
Even if the qos logic was just 'holding' an ACK to throttle it down,
if the hosts didn't respond nicely you could fesably have your
bandwidth drop, then creep back up (same behaviour described above).

One way to see is to check (during off-peak hours) by increasing the
granularity of your traffic graphing, and do a point to point iPerf to
an off-site host, and see what happens.

I'm sure you guys will find this a stupid question. The last time I 
installed Suse 9.3 (which is all I can get running so far), I told it to 
install both the KDE and Gnome desktops. And Gnome appears to 
be there, even though it launches into KDE. Today I decided to 
play with Gnome for a while. I looked everywhere, but can't figure 
out how. Read the Suse manuals, help files, everything. Not a word 
about which magic incantation gets me into Gnome.

So how do I get into Gnome?

OK, I went into the BIOS, and there was nothing about USB. I 
couldn't find anything that relates even remotely to this problem.

Not once it starts. It boots up in text mode to a prompt that says 
"boot:." When I hit enter it starts the boot process. And that is the 
last time the keyboard works. 

In Ubuntu it stops at a screen where I have to specify the language. 
But I can't get past that screen because the keyboard is dead. 

In Knoppix it just sails through until it is completely running and the 
KDE screen is up. But then the keyboard and touchpad are dead.

I just now tried Gentoo. Similar problem. It gets to a graphical 
screen where I have to hit enter to continue, but the keyboard is 
dead.

The only one where the mouse, touchpad and keyboard are all 
working is Suse 9.3. Much as I am becoming annoyed with Suse, 
at least that tells me it is possible to configure other distros to do 
the same.

And speaking of my annoyance with Suse, yesterday and today I 
discovered just about the last straw. At home I always had a patch 
cord into my ethernet hub, which is connected to the router and 
cable modem. Yesterday at a friend's house I booted it without 
internet connection. As soon as it finished launching I got a big 
error message in the middle of the screen that said "unable to 
locate novell.com." I thought I had told the SuseWatcher utility not 
to do automatic updates. So I went into the utility and I was right -- 
it was all turned off. But SuseWatcher is still phoning home. I've 
looked everywhere and I can't find a place to turn it off. That's so 
Gatesian it enrages me. As soon as I get something else working, 
Suse is history.

Dear All:

I have a networking problem and any tips much appreciated.

I am trying bring up Apache Tomcat instance on 2 linux box.  One is kernel 
version 2.4 and the
other is kernel version 2.6.10.  Tomcat is up as local browser can load
the front page.  However, any request from another box is rejected
with a "Connection Refused" error.  I used the default port which is 8080
and then I do:

   telnet thatbox 8080

I got back

    telnet:  connect to address <some ip>: no route to host

ssh, http (I have a web server running on the box too) all work fine.

I checked iptables and everything seems to be ok.    I am puzzled by
"no route to host" error.  Is this something I need to get our network
admin to look into?   I am not sure where the problem is
in this case (since ssh and http seems to work fine)

Thanks

That's normal to see on any network with a big broadcast domain...

Operating system of choice hasn't been a sticking point since the late 
1990s with the cable company.  They won't hold your hand, but they'll 
at least give you some troubleshooting suggestions.

You're seeing the difference between segementation and broadcast 
domains there.  It's not weird, it's actually fairly common.  You'll 
see this anytime the broadcast domain is larger than the network 
segment you're on.  It doesn't mean the network isn't routed (as it 
most certainly is).

This depends on the tech you get when you call Comcast.  The vast
majority will help regardless of OS, though a couple times I've had to
say "tell me what you'd do in Windows and I'll do the equivalent thing
on my Linux box".  A sizable minority of the techs are actually
interested in what the equivalent is on Linux.  A tiny minority refuse
to help at all on non-Windows-- call back and get someone else.

However, they always say "we only really support Windows" and if the
problem gets tricky they may pull that card.

Well, yeah, but even if you're in Windows, instead of "we only really 
support Windows," they'll pull out the, "Must be a problem with your 
system.  You probably should be running Linux to prevent that sort of 
thing from happening" line.  I know this because I used to pull that 
move all the time when all possible support options were exhausted 
when I did support for @Home back in the day...

does `host thatbox` return the IP address that you expect?

If it did indeed install, you should be able to select it during
login.  Enter your username, and in the pulldown (forget what it's
labeled) in the lower/right hand corner of the KDM/XDM login window,
you should be able to choose between Gnome/KDE/fvwm, etc.

What "actually" happened is that Knoppix has some differences in the
packages it requires and their dependencies from the stock Debian
repositories. As a result, if you blindly sync your system with Debian,
it deletes things you need to have. There are ways to fix this, but if
you want a mix of Sarge and Sid (or Etch and Sid in the not-too-distant
future) you're better off installing Sarge directly to your hard disk
and keeping Knoppix as a "rescue disk".

Subject: [PLUG] Postfix hangs
Message-ID: <20050513045120.GA18400@gate.kl-ic.com>


I have postfix running on my vcolo gateway machine, processing about
12 mails (or spam attempts) per minute.  The machine is backed up over
the network at 430AM or so, saturating the bandwidth between that
machine and my site.   About once a week, during backup time, postfix
decides to hang and stop moving mail, leaving it queued up on the
vcolo machine rather than pushing it to the mail server on my site.
A "service postfix restart" causes the mail to start moving again.
I would like to figure out why, but there are no clues in 
/var/log/maillog or /var/log/messages on either machine (and the
maillog file runs to 20K+ lines due to all the spam,  so even 
hunting through it can take a long time).

The easiest way to resolve this is to automatically do the postfix
restart after the backup completes, but this seems awfully sloppy. 
Is there a clean way to jiggle postfix to remind it to keep working,
or else to figure out what is making postfix hang up so I can fix
the real problem?

I think there are thresholds past which Postfix will stop processing and
accepting incoming mail, in an attempt to prevent it from breaking the
host.  I cannot think of what those are right now, but you might try
just using 'postqueue -f' to make it try to start delivering again.

(Also, you might try use greylisting and Postgrey to cut back on your
spam flood :)

12 per minute isn't a flood, that's business as usual. If Postfix can't
reject an email every 5 seconds, something is wrong!

Maybe.  It was almost a year ago I think and I've forgotten the
details.  All I remember for sure is the result.  Ah, wait a minute,
here it is in my email archive.  From August 09, 2004:

  It is a Knoppix 3.4 hdinstall (or whatever the command was, about a
  month ago I installed Knoppix on the harddisk) that I subsequently
  updated using apt with the default /etc/apt/sources.list.

Nothing exceptionally "blindly" about that.  If that doesn't work, it
is broken, it seems to me.  That was several versions of Knoppix ago
though, so maybe it has been fixed.

What does `/sbin/route` say? Sounds like you might not have a default
gateway defined. But if ssh and https work, that might not be the
case.

Subject: [PLUG] Mandriva Installation
Message-ID: <42845C8C.14786.14AEE402@localhost>

Last night I downloaded Mandriva 10.1 three-CD set. Just installed 
it. Installation went fine -- I told it to install over Suse. I rebooted at 
the end of the installation, but all I get is a text screen that says 
"grub>." Of course I have no paper documentation and, since I 
can't get it to boot I have no online documentation.

I read about Grub in the Fedora Core 3 Unleashed book, and I went 
to the BootPrompt Howto at ibiblio.org. All they give me is 
arguments I can pass to the kernel. They left out what to do if I 
don't want to pass any arguments. I tried hitting enter, but it just 
redisplays grub>. I tried typing "linux," "mandriva" "boot," "load," 
and several other things, but nothing works.

I really want to try out this distro because, other than Suse, it's the 
only one that got all the way through the installation without killing 
my keyboard and touchpad.

I've reinstalled three times, and each time this is the result after 
rebooting. How do I get it to boot?

Yeah, it's odd. It sounds like it would be a routing issue, but that
doesn't fit with him being able to access other services.

I can suggest a couple of possible things to try:

1) Try the "telnet thatbox 8080" from on the box itself, if your packet
filtering rules should allow that. Then you can at least make sure the
server is accepting connections on that port.

2) Do some packet sniffing (tcpdump, ethereal, whatever). I would sniff on
the Tomcat box while you try to connect in, and then maybe sniff on the
other end, too.

None of this is a fix, just more data to troubleshoot with.

You might also try disabling your packet filtering briefly and test. I
know you said you checked over the iptables stuff and that it looked good,
but we all are capable of overlooking things.

Except maybe Wil.

If you got to the grub prompt, you're not TOO bad off.

At this point, provided the install DID properly set up your
partitions and copy files to your root, you just need to:

1) Find out what partition your /boot or /root are on.
   If you remember, great, if not boot with /K|G/noppix, and do an
'fdisk -l /dev/hda' (provided you have an IDE drive, and you installed
to the primary master.)

2) You need to tell grub to intall itself back to the boot sector
(which it already did properly), and give it a device to point at for
its config (/boot/grub/menu.lst, and others).
   The drive addressing in GRUB SUCKS, for some reason the developers
decided to use a non-standard reference for labeling
drives/partitions.  If you installed your /boot or / onto /dev/hda1,
grub calls this (hd0,0), and if it's on /dev/hda3 (hd0,2).

Here I'll give you a quick, maybe partially correct command set.
Provided your /boot directory (or / if you don't have one) is on
/dev/hda2

in the grub shell:

root (hd0,1)

setup (hd0)

quit

Rebooting (should) get you into your boot menu for the system,
provided the layout you gave it is correct, and there are no other
problems.

Subject: [PLUG] DocBook
Message-ID: <4284D61A.6090702@axpr.net>

I know we have at least a few published authors here... so I thought I'd
check and see - what did you guys use to create your books?

I'm involved with a project that's using DocBook to create a book... an
online manual of sorts.  It was being built in to HTML/PDF/PS/whatever
on a FreeBSD box using a BSD Make-based toolchain.  However, as we're
migrating the project to a Linux box, this is no longer an option.

So, I went looking for how to do this.  The book is written in SGML with
each chapter having its own directory, generally with a single file in
the directory (chapter.sgml), in the "root" directory, there's
book.sgml, authors.sgml, glossary.sgml, a .dsl file, and various logos
and such.

It would seem to me, with as popular a format as it seems DocBook is,
there would be an *easy* way to take this layout and convert it to a
PDF, single-page HTML, and multi-page HTML tree.

Looking around, however, it seems there is not.  Does anybody know why
not?  And has anybody here home-grown something that might work or be
adaptable and useful by the community at large?

It just seems so odd there isn't some well documented simple way of
dealing with DocBook trees like this.  :-\

   My understanding is that DocBook is great for technical manauals that will
be "published" primarily on the web.

When I performed my latest install, I did not specify a mount point
for /home - it is just in the normal place in the filesystem, under root
(/).  I have freed another HD of dreaded NTFS, and want to use it (well
a partition on it) as my /home directory.  I added this to
my /etc/fstab:

/dev/hdb1       /home     reiser4 notail,noatime     0     0

Is there anything else I need to do besides move my files from the
old /home to the new partition (hdb1) to make this transition?
If so, this sure is easier than certain 'other' OSes.
I am running Ubuntu, which is Debian based, if that makes a difference.

Thanks,
Reid

Spam control will be easier if access to proper 
indentification is improved for all people who have mail 
servers on the Internet.  Proper identification is one
area where I feel strongly that new laws may be 
appropriate.  My first thought is enacting a law 
requiring ISP's to ensure that there is a valid 
PTR record for every single one of their Internet 
connected customers.  A second law could bar ISP's 
from charging extra to their customers to ensure that 
this PTR record exists and is valid.

As far as blocking people in the event they make a typo,
my blocks are temporary at first.  If you're trying to
get a hold of me, you shouldn't make a typo entering the
address.

Without secure and complete domain registration, there 
won't be any easy solutions to the spam problem as far 
as I can tell.  Trusting any rule for smtp style email 
servers, such and such exchanger should be used first, 
seems arbitrary considering that everyone is supposed 
to have a PTR record.  Even if greylisting would not 
block major and commonly valid email sources including 
AOL, I'd be very much impressed.  If you can't affectively
filter email based on where it's coming from, you're in
trouble as far as I'm concerned.

in the Redhat 7.x days.  I don't know if this is a horde or an imp

  I had Comcast support pulled the "we only support windows" line on
me a while back.  I was getting rejected login from their mail server.
 The little phone-luser freaked when I told him I was using Linux.  I
responded that I didn't want them to support Linux, I wanted them to
support their mail servers.

  The exchange was prompted when I told the phone-luser that I was
using Ethereal to monitor my mail login.  I could *see* the failure
message being send by the MTA.  He wanted to go through all the
settings in Mozilla Mail.  He informed me that I had to *immediately*
exit Ethereal "because it may be harming your system".

  I spoke to a supervisor, who immediately forwarded me to 2nd level,
they got mail support on the line.  We had the trouble cleared up in a
couple of minutes.  One of the Comcast mail servers had received an
incomplete password file.

I've discovered SGML hasn't been actively developed since '02 or so, and
XML toolchains to do the job exist and are fairly common now.

So, I guess it's time to go through the ~30,000 lines of SGML and
convert it to XML.  Uhhh.. yay.

That's it just do a 'cp -a' or equivalent, though you might want to
consider having 'nosuid' set on the homedir mount also.  Especially
useful if you run a public_html out of it, for safety.

Reid,

   The entry in /etc/fstab does two things: 1) allows for automounts during
reboots and 2) allows root to mount the new filesystem manually.

   What I suggest you do is a four-step process[1]:

   1.  'mv /home /home-old' # this prevents having two filesystems with the
 				same name but mounted at different points.

   2.	(as root) 'mount /dev/hdb1 /home'

   3.  (as you) 'cd /home; cp -a /home-old/* .' # copy all from old to new.

   4.	'rm -rf /home-old/*' # Once you're sure everything is where it should
 				be.

   Then you can do as you wish with the home-old/, including rmdir.

HTH,

Rich

Any port 80 traffic that flows over the "transparent proxy" box should
be transparently proxied.  So you shouldn't need to do anything on the
"wireless gateway" to have it work properly.

The way *nix sees the filesystem is as one single tree, which means that 
you can do all sorts of crazy (and even stupid) things with your mount 
points and everything will work exactly the same.

The one tricky bit here would be the copy/move operation onto a mount 
point.  You probably don't have any hidden files directly under /home/, 
but if you did, you would have to use the cp as shown below to get them 
all in one blow.

mkdir /mnt/disk
mount /dev/hdb1 /mnt/disk
# 'mv /home/* /mnt/disk/' misses hidden files
cp -a /home/./  /mnt/disk/
cd /
# got backups?
# rm /home/ -rf
# ^-- that assumes that home is not currently a mount point
mkdir /home/
umount /mnt/disk
mount /home

Heck, you don't even have to delete everything that's under /home to 
mount on top of it (unless you wanted that disk space back :-)

Now.  Does anyone know of an mv command which is equivalent to the above 
copy?  That is, moves everything from *within* a directory to another 
(including hidden files.)

That should be it. This calls for one of my favorite incantations:

#find . | cpio -pdm /temp/hdb1/mntpoint

Of course, there are other options... This is just my personal favorite 
for moving files from one location to another without changing 
permissions or owners.

There is the docbook-tools software from RedHat, 
http://sources.redhat.com/docbook-tools/.  It is packaged as
docbook-utils.  It can convert to PDF and lots of other formats.  As
long as there is a single master .sgml file which includes the others,
and a .dsl stylesheet you want to use, it works just fine.

I don't think so.  O'Reilly sponsored the development of DocBook as an
open format for their own publications (I'm pretty sure; I cannot find a
reference on the DocBook site or O'Reilly).  It's fairly straightforward
to take DocBook sources and generate HTML, PDF, PS and to endlessly
tweak the resulting formats with style-sheets.

In an attempt to answer to Rob's question (although I am not a published
author): You can use SYSTEM entities to break a document up into
multiple files.  I'm not entirely sure if that's what you're asking
about or how that works with SGML instead of XML, but I think it should
be similar.  For an XML example, see:

http://haus.nakedape.cc/svn/public/trunk/writing/Defending-Email-HOWTO/Defending-Email-HOWTO.xml

While we're on the topic of DocBook, Paul Heinlein was going to send me
some examples of customizing headers and footers of generated HTML with
XSLT or DSSSL.  Paul?

Rich B: nah nah nah! :)

Due to reasons I don't understand (& won't ask about here), much
of my email over the last week has gotten scrambled. A given email
will have one or more other emails attached, at the bottom, showing
the header (although from the few I've glanced at, the first word
of the first header line has been changed from "From:" to "rom:").

Is there a quick tool that will unmangle these emails, or am I

Please post replies to the list, as this explains why I've been

[Note: I frist sent this message a hour ago, but DNS woes plaguing the 
comcast.net domain have kept it bottled up until now.]

Beyond the simple joy of migrating from SGML to XML, you also get the
blissful task of choosing which DocBook schema you want to use (DTD or
RelaxNG) and which version you want (4.{1,2,3} or 5.0).

I keep all my personal files in DTD 4.3, but many distro packages aren't
there yet, so you may end up using an earlier version or rolling your
own package to bring it up to date.

The tea leaves scattered around my floor suggest that RelaxNG is the
coming thing, but I frankly haven't worked up the energy to research the
issue.

I'd be happy to discuss (on- or off-list) the toolchain I've developed,
which includes custom XSL templates, Makefiles, HTML Tidy, xsltproc,
xmllint, and fop -- but pretty it's not...

If PDF output is a high priority for you, make sure you're aware of what
FO processing features you need before settling on a tool. Apache fop
works fine for me, but the current release version (0.25) is dated and
somewhat limited.

Finally, it's definitely worth perusing Bob Stayton's book on DocBook
XSL processing: http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/. Don't leave /home
without it. :-)

I had understood that if, in C, you do something like

  const int i=5;

  i=10;

that this was an error.  But when I compile the code I merely
get a warning:

   warning: assignment of read-only variable `i'

and, worse, it reassigns i to have value 10.

How does one make the compiler elicit a hard error and stop the
compilation?  This is using gcc-3.3.2, by the way.

If you really want to try out Mandriva (Mandrake's idiotic new name)

their naming scheme)?  It is more solid than 10.1, runs the 2.6.11 kernel,
and Xorg 6.8.2.  The  udev/hotplug stuff works better, and
SATA disk drives (at least my SATA drives!) run without problems.
In 10.1 none of these statements are true.

O'Reilly masters *all* books internally in DocBook, except maybe a few
very old legacy books.

O'Reilly has tools to convert all of their interesting formats into
DocBook, like Word, FrameMaker, and even POD.

Possible answers:

  1. Use gcc-3.4. (I just tried the above and it produced an error).

  2. Compile with "-Werror".  Will turn all warnings (including that one)
     into errors.

  3. use "#define" rather than "const int" (local non-pointer constants
     seem a little silly to me...)

  4. there might be another command-line option, but since I can't get
     gcc-3.4 to take that code at all, I don't know what it might be.

Be aware that when using gcc without additional options you are
compiling to cpp standards even when you have ".c" files.

I don't have a machine handy to check the settings to force it into
ansi c mode.  Don't quote me but if memory services its -c99 or -ansi-c.

OK, with help from others here I got it to boot. Not the prettiest 
interface, but it appears the only things not working are the 
wireless and the video (it's running VESA 1024 x 768 instead of the 
1280 x 800 the screen is supposed to run). That makes Mandriva 
the second to run everything except the wireless and the video, out 
of six distros I have installed (Suse 9.3, Fedora Core 3 (hung in 
installation), Gentoo (not installed due to locked up keyboard), 
Ubuntu (ditto Gentoo comment), and Knoppix. Knoppix did install 
all the way, but when I tried to use it the keyboard was locked up. 
So at this point it appears to be a tossup between Suse 9.3 and 
Mandriva. I'd give the nod to Mandriva, just because Suse annoys 
the hell out of me. Unless I find something else that works better.

After reading what you said I wonder what I have. I thought it was 
10.1 LE, but everything I can find on the computer says it is 2005 
LE. I can't find anything where it gives the actual version number. 
So maybe I already have 10.2.

Bear in mind that I'm a total newbie. Installing a distro and then 
wiping it out to install a different one is part of the learning 
experience.

Does anyone know how to contact Mandriva? There is a phone 
number on their website, but it is a message phone only. It's hard 
for me to be called back because some days I'm in class almost 
all day long. Couldn't find an e-mail address. I want to ask them if 
their regular for-pay version has drivers for the ATI Radeon Xpress 
200M video chip. The reason I want to ask them is because during 
the installation of this LE version there was a screen saying that it 
was LE so I wouldn't get proprietary drivers for Nvidia and ATI.

Thanks Wil.  But this is too strong for the actual situation.
Too many innocuous warnings (it's a big piece of code) would cause
the build to fail.  Going to gcc 3.4 fixes the problem.

feedback about what tools others are using to monitor servers and

beginning to play around with them.
Any info you have on products that work good for you and your

And the Tomcat box is able to telnet to itself on port 8080.
Something even more weird...If I change the tomcat port to 80, tomcat works 
fine
and any box on my network can load the front page just fine.

I use nagios 2.0b2 to monitor 38 services on 23 hosts/devices. The 
initial setup was a bit hairy, but it's worked well since then. My local 
setup has two limitations; they aren't limitations in nagios, only in 
the amount of time I've put into the project:

1. I've currently only got it doing e-mail notifications since I don't
    yet have a modem attached to the monitoring server.

2. I haven't set up user accounts so that admins responsible for certain
    hosts can login and setup downtimes, mark problems as known, etc.

Exceedingly bad idea to the move this way. I must *strongly* recommend
using dump/restore for this. For which the commands would be:

cd /home; dump -0f - /home | restore -xf -

The one issue is you need an appropriate FS-specific dump program for
your root FS (the lack of which is a fatal weakness of ReiserFS for me)
for this to work. Failing that `tar` will work in most circumstances.

The key point is that dump and to a lesser extent tar will preserve
interesting things on the filesystem. Notably cp *will* *not* handle
links correctly! Nor will cp preserve the various timestamps. GNU tar is
decent at preserving those, as well as other interesting extras on the
filesystem. OTOH dump/restore will guarentee preservation of links.

I have also noticed that when I did a 'netstat -a" with Tomcat listening on
port 8080, netstat does not list anything listing on port 8080.

The tools for SGML aren't as robust (or actively maintained) as the ones
for XML.  Luckily, however, I'm starting to think it might not be too
horribly difficult to convert with utilities like XML editors that point
out syntax errors and the like.

Thanks for the example, that does help greatly.

pmake didn't work (I'm not sure why, I'm not the one who tested that
part), and I wasn't able to locate a version of bsdmake ported to Linux
when I went looking.  Are you aware of such a thing out there?

The gnu cp on most Linux systems has the "-a" flag that preserves  
links, modes, permissions and timestamps, so on Linux cp can handle  
links correctly.  However, the cp on most other Unix variants I use  
don't have the -a flag, including to my surprise Mac OSX.

I personally think rsync is the best option, since it preserves  
links, modes, permissions and time stamps and it makes it possible to  
stop and resume later.

mkdir /newhome
rsync -av /home/ /newhome

Nagios rox!

As a long-term user, I'm happy.  Upgrading to 2b drastically reduced
monitoring system load.  After getting nrpe compiled and configured
(non-standard installations), I've got a setup monitoring 500+ HPC
nodes, and dozens of separate fileservers/enterprise service systems,
etc with no headaches.

Just take your time with layout in the beginning, and you'll save
yourself serious time and money in the long-haul.  FYI, anything that
can be somehow checked on the command line can be scripted with
Bash/Perl as a plugin.

cp -a DOES keep our niceties intact like links, timestamps etc:

CP(1)                     User Commands                     CP(1)
       -a, --archive
              same as -dpR
       -d     same as --no-dereference --preserve=link
       --no-dereference
              never follow symbolic links
       -p     same as --preserve=mode,ownership,timestamps
       -R, -r, --recursive
              copy directories recursively

Though you may sometimes see the timestamp on the NEW symlink as that
when it was copied (always seems like a bug to me).

There are lots of ways to accomplish everything in *NIX, but I'm
personally a fan of the simplest.  Just as you can pipe a tar/untar
through an SSH session, I prefer to just use rsync -e ssh

:)

Without seeing the whole thing, I can't really narrow it down.

Sorry, I don't recall what you are trying to install on.
What video hardware does it have (let me guess: ATI)?
Not sure why your wireless is not working. I have not played
with wireless in the "10" series (yet).  My ancient laptop is
running Mandrake 9.2 and wireless works flawlessly.

: After reading what you said I wonder what I have. I thought it was 
: 10.1 LE,

There is no such thing as 10.1 LE.  There is just 10.1 which came out
a few months ago.  10.2 was due out in April.  Then Mandrake merged
with Connectiva, changed their name, and changed their product cycle.

The new schedule has them introducing a new version every year around
October.  The first one will be called "Mandriva 2006" coming out this
October 2005.  But because we were all on the cust of 10.2 they decided
to release a "limited edition" 2005:  not limited in functionality, but
only in availability---no boxed set, only download.

: but everything I can find on the computer says it is 2005 
: LE. I can't find anything where it gives the actual version number. 
: So maybe I already have 10.2.

Look in /etc/mandrake-release.  That tells all.
Also, if uname -r returns "2.6.11-6mdk" or "2.6.11-6mdksmp"
and you have not updated your kernel, then you are running 2005LE (or
is it LE2005? I can never remember!)


: Bear in mind that I'm a total newbie. Installing a distro and then 
: wiping it out to install a different one is part of the learning 
: experience.

Correct.  Anyway, if you really have 10.1, I have 2005LE on DVD.
We can talk about this offline if you like.

: Does anyone know how to contact Mandriva? There is a phone 
: number on their website, but it is a message phone only. It's hard 
: for me to be called back because some days I'm in class almost 
: all day long. 

Mandriva is located in Paris, France.  Besides they won't help you
w/o paying them $$.

However the mandriva "experts" mailing list is just about the best
e-mail discussion list I've ever seen and I've been doing lists for 20
years.  The SNR is very high.

The archives for the Mandriva lists are here:

<http://archives.mandrakelinux.com/>

You want either "newbie" or "expert" in English.  Don't worry about
the "expert" title. That just means some of the people on the list are
experts.  But there are plenty of semi-Newbies as well.  Nobody will
yell at you if you ask a beginner question, as long as you have tried
first to figure it out for yourself.

To sign up and start participating go to 

<http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/flists.php3>

and sign up for expert and/or newbie.
Pay no attention to the "purchase support" advertisement.
Just get on the mailing lists and you'll find help.

: Couldn't find an e-mail address. I want to ask them if 
: their regular for-pay version has drivers for the ATI Radeon Xpress 
: 200M video chip. The reason I want to ask them is because during 
: the installation of this LE version there was a screen saying that it 
: was LE so I wouldn't get proprietary drivers for Nvidia and ATI.

Not sure what that message said.  But here's the deal:
If you are an "ordinary" non-paying user then the download that is
available to you contains none of the commercial drivers and various
other stuff that they prepare for paying customers.  

All that stuff is, in fact available to you.  You just have to go to
the vendor sites yourself and download what you need. Also, it won't
(necessarily) be packaged as a nice Mandriva .rpm.

On the other hand, if you purchase the dist. (which you can't do with
2005LE since they are not selling it boxed) then you get an additional
couple of CDs with all this stuff in one place, and packaged in mandrake
.rpm's that have been tested to install properly.

A third option (the one I use) is to purchase "Mandriva Club"
membership which entitles members to all these additional packages
plus some other privileges.  I do this mainly to support Mandriva because
I like the dist.

Again the "proprietary drivers for Nvidia and ATI" are all available
from the vendors over the web.  Talk with me offline and I may be able
to help you.

I'm aware of the capabilites of cp, I still stand by my point *DO*NOT*
use cp for moving significant slices of filesystems around! Most Unix
flavors -pR is sufficient, GNU is the only one that needs an additional
option for maximal preservation.

Of note I said "links", not "symbolic links". cp *will*not* handle hard
links correctly. GNU tar will only _probably_ handle them correctly. For
illustrative purposes, a portion of my home directory on PSU's CS
systems:

$ ls -lin
total 1972
    307209 -rw-r--r--   4 1831     300      1099511627775 Aug  4  2004 -f
    307209 -rw-r--r--   4 1831     300      1099511627775 Aug  4  2004 -fr
    307209 -rw-r--r--   4 1831     300      1099511627775 Aug  4  2004 -r
    307209 -rw-r--r--   4 1831     300      1099511627775 Aug  4  2004 -rf
<...>

$ du -sk *
32      -f
32      -fr
32      -r
32      -rf
<...>

There are plenty of other strange things people can and *will* do on home
directories. cp won't correctly replicate this. GNU tar will likely
successfully replicate something roughly equivalent this, after burning
processor time for *hours*, and the result may not fit on a single modern
disk. By contrast, dump/restore *will* replicate this perfectly in less
than a second, and the result will be less than a megabyte.

Disk moves are best accomplished by tools designed for that. dump/restore
beat everything else, because they'll replicate everything (in addition
to the above, they'll also handle ACLs, flags and other interesting FS
features, such as lsattr/chattr on ext2). tar will get the most crucial
bits of structure, but it is a very poor second compared to dump/restore.
cp isn't even close to vaguely adequate for this purpose.

Just in case anyone is curious, I'm pretty sure home directories at PSU's
CS department are backed up with dump.  :-)

rsync can handle hard links and sparse files, but it won't do so with
anywhere near the efficiency of dump though. Not to mention you still
lose filesystem features as with tar.

Has anyone had any experience with Zabbix?  It was very easy to setup 
and seems to have a lot of features.  I'm just wondering if Nagios is 
worth the trouble to setup if it doesn't provide anything more than Zabbix.

OT at this point, but it make me wonder about an issue with some
weirdness in RHEL4-AS installs... if anyone has a box around that they
haven't already fixed, I'd be curious to know the answer....

If you're running AS4 (and probably ES and WS), try and copy
/var/lastlog anywhere.  Or use rsync, or tar... you'll end up with an
endlessly growing monstrosity (or a copy that never ends, but doesn't
get any bigger).  For some reason, the install barfs on the file, an
it ends up with a flaky inode;  taking the system down and mounting it
with a rescue/knoppix disk and fscking it results in _always_ a single
fixed inode, and the ability to then safely
backup/move/delete/whatever /var/log/lastlog.

I noticed that when arkeia backups were having these enormous backup
sizes, with a file that had around 3000% compression ratio!

Anyhow, I'd be interested if somehow dump handles this (admittedly
corrupt) situation differently.

Never heard of it until you mentioned the project, but it does seem to
integrate histograms/graphing of trending info (apparently) with ease.
 That's a nagging point with nagios, that you have to export trend
data to a rrd externally, and come up with a nice way of charting
it/using it.  Pain in the ass.

I'm going to check this out this weekend, and see what it's like.

Under GNU cp, hard links are copied too:
dhubbard at linux:/tmp/testdir> dd if=/dev/random of=testfile bs=1k count=2
0+2 records in
0+2 records out
dhubbard at linux:/tmp/testdir> ln testfile testfile2
dhubbard at linux:/tmp/testdir> ls -i
91573 testfile  91573 testfile2
dhubbard at linux:/tmp/testdir> mkdir testdir2
dhubbard at linux:/tmp/testdir> cp -a testfile* testdir2
dhubbard at linux:/tmp/testdir> cd testdir2
dhubbard at linux:/tmp/testdir/testdir2> ls -i
91579 testfile  91579 testfile2

And on modern distributions it also copies ACLs

dhubbard at linux:/tmp/testdir> setfacl -m u:dhubbard:r testfile
dhubbard at linux:/tmp/testdir> getfacl testfile
# file: testfile
# owner: dhubbard
# group: users
user::rw-
user:dhubbard:r--
group::r--
mask::r--
other::r--

dhubbard at linux:/tmp/testdir> cp -a testfile* testdir2
dhubbard at linux:/tmp/testdir> cd testdir2
dhubbard at linux:/tmp/testdir/testdir2> ls -la
total 8
drwxr-xr-x  2 dhubbard users 104 2005-05-14 01:01 .
drwxr-xr-x  3 dhubbard users 128 2005-05-14 00:46 ..
-rw-r--r--+ 2 dhubbard users 170 2005-05-14 00:46 testfile
-rw-r--r--+ 2 dhubbard users 170 2005-05-14 00:46 testfile2

# file: testfile
# owner: dhubbard
# group: users
user::rw-
user:dhubbard:r--
group::r--
mask::r--
other::r--

It also works between filesystems types, like say between reiserfs  
and ext3, dump/restore don't.

Yes tar is one of the least efficient ways of moving data I have used.

That is a good point, cp certainly doesn't copy the filesystem  
attributes and probably never will.   I'll have to play with these a  
bit :-)

The only thing rsync doesn't handle are the file attributes, current  
versions of rsync support softlinks, hardlinks, sparse files, and  
acls just like gnu cp.

Rsync is really useful when the user home directory is very large and  
you want to keep the downtime to a minimum, because you can rsync it  
once to get the bulk of the data over to the new location.  Then when  
you are ready to do the switch, run the rsync again.  That second  
rsync is a hell of a lot faster than a dump unless there are a huge  
amount of changes.

Of course the main reason I don't use dump/restore is because they  
don't exist for reiserfs which I'm running on my Linux boxes.

Easily doable with holes. If it can identify holes and store a hole
marker, that isn't difficult to do. Even without explicitly handling
holes, long strings of zeros will serverely crunched by any modern
compression algorithm. The neat trick of JPEG of course is to turn an
image into a long string of zeros, then use conventional techniques.

Likely spotting it, and then telling you to run fsck. Perhaps it might be
able to grab /some/ of the file.

OMG it's a monster!

Geeze, whatever happened to cp being a small tool that simply copied
files...

The limitations are slightly different, but similar. If the filesystem
doesn't support the exact same attributes then neither will be able to
copy them. For dump/restore only the dump side is FS-specific, once
you've got the archive restore can write it onto any filesystem that
supports the appropriate system calls.

There isn't any agreement (that I know of, as of 6 months ago) for what
precisely the system call should look like or be for handling attributes.
ufs ACLs on SunOS have one interface, NFS ACLs on SunOS are downright
scary. ReiserFS and ext2 were each trying for their own interfaces
(though ReiserFS was doing limited emulation of the ext2 one). Trying to
move these between filesystems is *asking* for trouble. After that,
dump/restore are your best bet as they tend to know more about the FS.

Neither tar nor rsync can handle this any better. They can discover via
stat() that a file is full of holes, but there isn't an interface to find
out where. All of these have to read huge numbers of zeros to find them.
dump can look at the FS structure and know what portions are data and
what portions are holes.

Notice the warnings about hardlinks and sparse files though. They're
hard to discover and it has to burn processor to figure out where they
are. The ACLs scare me, I wouldn't count on it without an agreed upon
system call (actually at this point I don't count on ACLs at all on
Linux).

I can see rsync winning if you're mostly dealing with large files with
small changes (say all files over 128KB and append-only). More common
circumstances I highly doubt it. Certainly repeated level 0 dumps are
slow, but that is why you use incrementals. In average circumstances I'd
guess a small win for dump because of better hole handling and just
higher efficiency access patterns.

restore isn't FS-specific (beyond the specialty system calls for extra
attributes which may not be available on the target). You're allowed to
use that reasoning, but as an admin due to this I *cannot* use ReiserFS.
GNU tar may be good, but it isn't anywhere near *that* good.

   This one has me stymied: three files (one .c source file, two .h header
files and in two different directories of the same file system) that cannot
be read or have permissions changed by root across the network. The directory
listing for one is:

-rw-r-----  1 rshepard users 4591 2005-02-13 10:13 eigen.c

which looks quite normal to me. However, from my main workstation (on which
the backups run), it's inaccessible. The other three files in that directory
are fine

   However, when I log into the development machine, I can change the mode to
644 which makes it readable from the other host (where it is nfs-mounted).

   Strange -- to me. I'm the owner of the file, so what could be the reason
for this strange behavior?

Color me puzzled,

I'm assuming it's an NFS export.  Unless you specify (no_root_squash)
in the /etc/exports line defining that share, root gets its
permissions slammed down.  Alternately, its UID:GID isn't translating
to something equal on the client either.

Show us the perms for both server- and client-side.

PS- Using no_root_squash is a bad idea in general practice

   No, UID:GID are the same on both boxes.

   Both were 640. When I logged into that box and changed the perms to 644 it
was readable on the client side.

I'll second the nomination of LyX, although I prefer TeXmacs for
"literate programming", since it allows embedded sessions of Maxima,
Octave, etc. Both are GUI wrappers on LaTeX and both allow access to the
underlying LaTeX if you need it. LyX is somewhat easier to use, but
TeXmacs is more powerful.

Subject: [PLUG] Redirecting a URL with ProxyPass to SSL (https://) on same
	host....
Message-ID: <f4468cae05051416044a273f88@mail.gmail.com>

I'll be the first person to admit that I'm not an Apache pro, but I've
tried all the resources I can here both my Apache2 books AND my brain
coprocessor (google) have failed me.

Situation:

I've got an Apache2 install with 3 virtual hosts: 

one default fallthrough to give annoying error messages to fishers
One DNS-valid NameVirtualHost (redirects to SSL vhost)
One SSL virtual host

I have all things functioning the way I want in regards to the
Named/SSL setup, if you hit the hostname of NameVirtualHost you get
redirected to https://NameVirtualHost thanks to a 'Redirect /
https://$NameVirtualHost'  Thus, yes, everything served is over TLS
(yes, SSLCipherSuite
ALL:!ADH:!DH:!EXPORT:!LOW:!MED:!SSLv2:!RC4:+HIGH:+SSLv3), including
when you do a http://$NameVirtualHost/somesuch, redirects to
https://$NameVirtualHost/somesuch

I'm also using ProxyPass to provide access to other
servers/applications behind the frontman.  The ProxyPass directive is
setup and interpreted flawlessly! That's all great!  Too great; I
think I've realized that proxy directives are interpreted before any
others (redirect, rewrite).

Thanks to the use of a 'SSLRequireSSL' catchall in the ProxyPass
location (me being paranoid!), a 403 is given instead of the client
getting ANY info (login prompt or otherwise).  Obviously I've got the
location requiring authentication also, but I don't want ANYTHING
allowed unless it's over SSL.

Long and short of it is, there's no danger of
accidentally-allowed-malicious access to the back end still, but I
would like to be able to have the URL rewritten to the proper (same)
location, but over https:  I'm not even going to bother with
mod_rewrite as it sems EVERYTHING is bypassed when a mod_proxy
directive is in use.

Any ideas?

On the wireless gateway...

See attached rc.local file.

On the proxy box the relevant rules are:

iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
iptables -P FORWARD DROP

iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -m multiport \
         -i eth1 -p tcp \
         --dports 80,443 \
         -j REDIRECT --to-port 8081

iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -m multiport \
         -i eth1 -p udp \
         --dports 80,443 \
         -j REDIRECT --to-port 8081

the proxy server has one Internet interface
which has catchall INPUT and OUTPUT rules
of drop for tcp/udp packets plus some rules
to allow various protocols not related to 
this problem out through that interface.

A workstation at 10.0.0.2 can not browse the web
without a manually entered proxy address of 
192.168.4.3:8081.  To get to the proxy 
transparently, you have to go through the 
wireless gateway.  I don't think my wireless
gateway properly passes port 80 and 443 
traffic.  I don't know if I'm missing forwarding
rules or input and output rules on my wireless
gateway.  You can use the proxy from 10.0.0.2,
but you can't use it transparently.

Is there another way to set the firewall up on 
Slackware-10.1 that's more appropriate than putting 
the rules into rc.local?

the ip addresses that are blocked.  The mailblock_web_page script
just updates the web page.  The script seems to have a bug, I have

OK, overnight I succeeded in downloading Mandriva Linux 2005 LE
DVD .86_64. It's in 6 files, four ISOs of approximately 695 Mb, labeled
CD1, CD2, CD3 and CD4, and two very small plain text files. This new
Compaq R4000 laptop has a DVD burner, but I've never used it to burn
anything yet. However, I have burned CD ISOs from my Windows computer
using Nero, and I know you don't just copy the files. The laptop is
currently running Mandriva 2005 LE from the three-CD download, which
doesn't give me all drivers and goodies I need.

I've looked around and can't find much on burning ISOs to DVD. I did
discover that if I right-click on a file I can select "burn to CD," but
that works only for one file at a time. If I select all six files the
option is no longer available. Evidently I need a different package.
What is the best software to do it? Are there any special tricks?

Also a related question. I started the download about 2 pm Saturday. It
got to 36% and stopped dead. After an hour of watching with not one more
byte downloaded I killed it and restarted the download. However, that
36% did download one complete file -- an ISO of 1.6 Gb. That makes no
sense. Why are the files different, when I clicked on the same exact
link on the MandrivaClub site? Plus, everything on the MandrivaClub site
indicates that the DVD versions are around 4 Gb, but the six files I
finally received total about 2.7 Gb. Please don't tell me I have to do
this over again with that awful BitTorrent thing!

Sounds like you downloaded 4 CD images, not a DVD image. If you want
to use these, burn them to CDs as usual (cdrecord -v -eject
image.iso).

The easiest is to install k3b from http://k3b.sourceforge.net/, you'll
need some other tools which are listed on K3B's web page.

Well, I googled around a bit and discovered that if you're in Gnome
(which I've decided I prefer), just slap a new DVD in the drive and it
automatically pops up a burn window. Then I had to figure out how to get
it to list the six files. As soon as I navigated out of ///burn the icon
to burn disappeared. But I had another window already open showing the
six files. So acting on a hunch I selected them all and dragged them
into the ///burn window. Voila. (Hmmm, how do I type an a with accent
grave?) 

Anyway, I clicked on the burn icon and it popped up another window. The
choices were to make an ISO image or burn the files to the DVD. I
selected to make an ISO image, but it seemed to want to do it to the
hard drive, not the DVD. So I just burned them to the DVD. Later today
I'll see if it is bootable.

Er, why not run the ProxyPass only on the SSL vhost?  That way,

http://elis.box/proxied-service
gets rewritten to
https://secure.elis.box/proxied-service
and only then gets proxied out to
http://inside.firewall/service

?  That is roughly how I have some of my inside/outside firewall systems
set up (using separate Apache 1.x instances instead of virthosts, in
some cases though).

Best,

Randall

I think the PLUG list strips all attachments. You should put it inline.

It shouldn't matter as long as the script that contains the rules is 
being run every time the computer boots. But, it is nice to break them 
out in a separate script, call it rc.firewall or whatever you want. Then 
call that script in rc.local. That way when you edit the rules you're 
not staring at other stuff that has nothing to do with them.

Also, it's handy to put in a rule to flush all rules out at the top of 
that script. Then you can make a change in the script, run it again from 
the shell, and it will flush the rules that are already there and then 
set up the new ones.

If your gateway/router won't allow you to make it do the forwarding, I
think another option would be to just put in an iptables rule on the
hosts themselves (presuming they're Linux) to forward
locally-originated/port-80 bound requests to the proxy.

Aha! Good idea, I'll give that a shot, it seems like it would do the

You're using Slackware now?  I really don't know that Slackware's
philosophy is very compatible with your own.

/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall is where you should put firewall rules - make sure
it's executable and one of the rc.inet's will source it.

Message-ID: <BAY20-F301D91FD8124B3A38FFA9AB8150@phx.gbl>



Hi:

Recall a few days ago, I posted a problem that
my Tomcat is refusing to serve requests from any hosts
on the network.  And when I telnet to that host and on port
8080 where Tomcat is running,
I got "no route to host".  If I change Tomcat to serve out of
port 80, everything is ok.  So something wrong with higher order ports
not able to accept remote socket connections.


Thanks to Michael Rassmussen, he suggsted that I add this
to my iptables even though my iptables setting seems to be ok:


     iptables -I INPUT 10 -i eth0 -d 0/0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8080 -j 
ACCEPT

I got an error saying that "Index of Insertion too big".
I did some looking into iptables and modified a little bit to:

    iptables -I INPUT 1 -i eth0 -d 0/0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT

And I am able to load Tomcat at port 8080 from any box.


So my problem is resolved.  (Thanks Michael).  However, I still want to know
why.  I had 2 linux boxes that had the same issue.  One is running Centos 
3.3 (kernel 2.4)
and the other is Fedora 3 (kernel 2.6.10).
Is Centros and Fedora shipped with iptables settings that blocks higher 
order ports?

Is there any security implication if I make the index as 1 in iptables?

Besides Michael, I also want to thank those who responded.

Hi Dick,

It would help to know more specifics. Like, do you get an error message? 
If so, what exactly does it say?

I'm having difficulty with my DMZ setup.

I have two servers that until earlier today, were on the green segment of
my lan. I installed a third NIC, and now I have it set up with Red, Green
and Orange (DMZ) sections.

I'm using IPCop, and I've posted about this on that mailing list. However,
knowing the bredth and width of knowledge in this list, thought I would
post it here as well.

If you have any ideas as to what I can try to solve the issue, please let
me know. I tried poking a pinhole in the firewall for port 111 (NFS) but
that didn't make any difference.

At this point, the system logs on both the server and the client show the
authenticate mount occuring, and then when you try do anything within the
mounted filesystem, such as 'ls', the command prompt sits and waits, and
the client syslog says the server is no longer there.

Thanks in advance.

Yeah, that is my understanding as well. I moved my machines over a couple
of hours ago, and I've been troubleshooting the setup since. :)

My setup is as follows:

Red: eth0: public IP
Orange: eth1: 192.168.100.0/24
Green: eth2: 192.168.0.0/24

I have mail working (obviously). One of these servers also doubles as my
NFS server where home directories are mounted from. The hosts on green get
name resolution from the DNSMasq process on IPCop, so when I try to mount
those directories, the client system just stops that process and I have to
kill it. I don't lose use of the machine, just that terminal. So it
appears NFS isn't working between subnets.

The home directories are also shared with Samba, and that works, using the
IP of the machine. My client machines are able to resolve the server, so
I'm a little baffled as to why this is the case.

 From direct evidence: I don't know much about current MSN testing.

I do have a lot of experience in opt-in mailings, and common problems, 
though.

Suggestions:
1. Don't flood an ISP. If your user base has 500 MSN users, Do *not* 
try to send to all 500 at once.
2. There are common flags to a lot of spam. Learn them, and then forbid 
them, Example: declaring a message as "not spam" is pretty much a sign 
of spam.
3. Wash your lists regularly. Sending to 10 dead addresses happens. 
Sending to 1000 looks like spam.
4. Verify opt-in. I've seen millions (literally) "opt-in" with an 
address of billgates at msn.com.
5. Run from real IP's. Avoid "marketing" ISP's, lest you get caught up 
in "opt out" nets that block whole IP ranges.

Dick,

   Somewhere in Kmail's configuration is a place to specify the mail server.
What does it have there? It needs to be the MTA that you use to take your
e-mail and move it on to the 'Net.

OK here's a stupid question...Is your system inside Comcast's network? One 
area grief for me is that when I travel with my laptop I was very rarely ever 
able to send email out though Comcast's SMTP servers. It appears that their 
SMTP servers aren't really open if you're not inside their network. I even 
tried setting up authentication for sending email through their servers which 
also didn't work. 

I can use secure POP and receive my email from Comcast's POP3 server so my 
solution to sending email was to get sign up for a fastmail.fm account that 
provides me a access to SSMTP servers for outgoing email. I just use my 
userid/password for Fastmail.fm and send through their servers. 

I have my Comcast.net user as my default identity in my KMail setup so any 
replies to my email go to my Comcast user.

(Sorry. I wrote that from an unfamiliar interface--the web mail--at the 
end of a long day. After I sent it I realized I should have said more. 
This morning I realized that I should just turn on PLUG List delivery to 
my Winders address and work from there until the problem is resolved.)

A message appears in the message bar at the bottom of the KMail window 
that says:

Failed to send (some) queued messages.

The first time I tried to send an e-mail (during this period), the 
"(some)" part of that message was not present. There was no lag time 
between the time I clicked on the send button and the time the error 
message appeared, so I assume that the problem is local and that no 
attempt to go out to the Internet was made by the software.

Yes. I'm back home, and this machine, along with it's Winders neighbor, 
were powered down while we were away. When I restarted things, I powered 
up the router, first, but probably didn't wait long enough before 
starting the two machines. The Win98SE machine had to be rebooted twice 
before it would see the house network, and thus the router. Then it was 
fine. The SuSE 9.1 machine would not see the house network until I ran 
YaST and reconfigured the eth0 interface. The old configuration was 
available, but was not used, so I just told YaST to use that. (I have 
since learned that I probably could have, as root, entered the "ifconfig 
eth0 up" command to achieve the same thing -- something I should have 
remembered.) After that, I was able to see the web with Konqueror, and 
KMail happily received 375 or so e-mails, but wouldn't send.

There is one exception to that, which has not been repeatable. I was 
able to send one e-mail from rsteff.l at comcast.net (from KMail) to 
rsteff at comcast.net (on the Winders machine). I don't know why it worked 
only the one time, which was after the first failure, nor why the same 
test e-mail will not work, now.

Outgoing: smtp.comcast.net on Port 25
Incoming: mail.comcast.net on Port 110

These settings are identical to the ones Netscape uses on the Winders 
machine, with the exception that Port 25 is not specified in Netscape -- 
that box is empty, in other words, no port is specified.

I got tired of seeing 2000 line logwatch reports with lines like:

Eventually, the bastards might even make it in.  So I downloaded a program
called DenyHosts ( http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net ) which is called from
cron, scans /var/log/secure and adds entries to /etc/hosts.deny .

The python program install isn't well documented (including a bit about
"from version import VERSION" which I commented out) and I would prefer
something that responded to the log process itself rather than being called
by cron to scan /var/log files.  At first, I thought it would be better to
just block the troublesome site with iptables rather than hosts.deny, but
the fine-grain control of hosts.deny does give me the opportunity to tweak
things by a back door after a DOS attack, and hosts.deny is permanent
through reboots.

So I will attempt to suggest a clue or two to the author, and use DenyHosts
to keep the automated sshd stuff out of my server.

Are there other tools that people use for this task?  Yes, I know about
portknocking and other tools to confuse the bad guys, but those imply
more control over the client machine and the intervening machines than
I sometimes have...

Thanks anyway.

I'm beginning to think that it's something that's either obscure, or 
something that is being obscured because I'm looking at what I think are 
the obvious places, when there is something else that will seem obvious 
once I find it.

   I have a very large postfix UCE table called badip. I suspect that sshd
cracking attempts would drop to zero if hosts.deny could be linked to include
badip. Could this be done? It would coordinate sshd and spam-mail rejections
and keep hosts.deny reasonably short.

You should be able to change it in passwd and chown the user's home
directory and any files (use "find / -user nnn") to the new UID.  You
might have to fix up the UID-to-Samba-user mapping somehow, but I
don't know.

You might want to do that with the user's group ID as well.

How'd the user get the same UID as sshd?  Was the user originally
created on another system, then the info was copied over verbatim?

Michael R. has some scripts to dynamically add rules to iptables for
this.  We were going to get an advanced topics talk about it(hint,
hint).  Alas, I seem to recall some wimpy excuse about wisdom teeth

Perhaps tomcat is binding to port 8080 on the loopback device rather than eth0?

That brings up an interesting question: What metrics should be used to 
measure the depth and breadth of a distribution's installed base?

For instance, counting the distros I use at home is easy. There are 
three hosts in daily use, each running a different distribution: CentOS, 
Debian, and Gentoo.

In other settings, it's a bit more difficult. Assuming that most 
sysadmins will try, for sanity's sake, to stick with one distribution 
for most/all machines -- should a server room with 50 hosts running some 
distro be counted as 50 (number of hosts) or 1 (manager/admin in charge 
of making the choice)?

On the one hand, there are 50 machines running XXX distribution. On the 
other hand, at upgrade time, the manager/admin may switch them all to 
YYY. Should it count as 50 or 1?

The question isn't really serious, I suppose -- just some lunchtime musing.

Well, I was right. It is something obscure, and I only have a slight clue as 
to what it is.

The KMail setting window for outgoing SMTP configuration has a check box for 
when the "server requires authentication." Since that is a requirement when I 
send mail from Netscape 7.1 on my Winders machine, I assumed (months ago, 
when I first started using the software) that I needed it with KMail, and set 
it up for the rsteff.l account. I learned during that time that outgoing mail 
did not need a password and unchecked the box.

In my fiddling around today, I tried checking that box again and putting in 
the password. It, of course, failed and I gave up for the time being. Well, 
it's now after lunch, and I thought I'd give it one more try. I got a 
different error report this time, one that was in it's own window and told me 
that the server didn't like my authentication. So, I went back and unchecked 
the box, and tried sending again. This time it worked!

I guess that means that somehow there was a mangled authentication sitting 
between my outgoing mail and the server, and that prevented mail from leaving 
my machine. Trying to activate authentication, and then disabling it appears 
to have cleared the problem.

I don't know if this is the real issue, but now I'll have this e-mail saved in 
a place where I can find it for future reference.

Thanks to all for the ideas you provided. Maybe this will help someone else 
someday.

Paul,

   It all depends on what point you're trying to make. Or, on which side of
the F/OSS vs. proprietary debate you're on. I suppose you can use the same
metric as publishers do to estimate the number of second-hand readers beyond
their subscriber/news stand base.

   You've left off other factors: nfs-mounted partitions where the server and
client run different distributions, samba clients and so on.

   I think the best thing to do is use a pseudo-random number generator and
call a press conference to announce your results. Just make sure that Maureen
O'Gara and Laura DiDio are there. :-)

    Gee, Dick. It almost looks like SuSE adopted the Microsoft model:
uninstall, take three turns around your desk, and reinstall.

    On a more serious note, I suspect the actually cause of the problem is in
the distribution's heroic efforts to protect you from yourself. Just like the
power windows in a car that don't work when the battery's dead, you gain
convenience at the cost of really controlling what is going on. However, now
that you have it working again ... DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING! :-)

Glad you fixed it,

Rich

Comcast even includes steps for configuring KMail in their FAQ:

I'm sorry I didn't forward this link earlier in this thread as I forgot they

I can see it now: I'll invite MOG and ... get my mom's picture in some 
useless blog, have my Lutheranism trumpeted across the web, and finally

Speaking of Slackware, how is Patrick Volkerding? Last I remember, he
was fighting some life-threatening disease. Is the community stepping in
for him?

Mike,

   He's been back in production mode for several months now. That's why 10.1
came out. Can't be more specific than that because he doesn't provide regular
health updates.

How to run shell commands from hosts.deny/hosts.allow is specified in the
man page, in the section labeled "shell commands"

For example, I use this entry in my hosts.deny to block people who attempt
to connect to my ssh service from addresses that aren't listed in the
/etc/hosts.allow:

sshd: ALL: spawn (/bin/logger -p auth.crit -t tcpwrappers "ssh connect
attempt from %h, address blocked";/sbin/ipchains -I input -s %h -j DENY)

It most certainly works since I've locked myself out when my ISP changed my
home IP address...

Wow! I'm surprised. I always got the feeling that if you didn't use Winders, 
they couldn't help you. Well, maybe they could help the occasional Mac 
person, but what is this Line Ucks of which you speak?

I've bookmarked that page for future reference.

However, it looks like it wouldn't have helped in this case, since those 
screen shots are what my settings looked like in the first place. Weird.

Anyway, thanks for the link.

Almost. But for the most part, stuff I try to do with SuSE works, and I don't 
have to go buy another upgrade.

Understood. And when I get enough time to really work with the tools, I'm sure 
I'll prefer editing config files where I can see all the settings. Meanwhile, 
I get along most of the time.

Right. But what did I touch that started all this? I may never know, but at 
least I have a small clue of how to fix it if it ever happens again.

Why not block it both ways, so you are not dependent on only one of them
working? Defense in Depth and all.

As for reboots, it seems like it would be pretty trivial to add the IPs to
a file, and then have a script that built the appropriate iptables rules
for each IP in the script each time the system booted.

It would be possible. To do that your sshd would have to be configured to
use the TCP Wrappers. That would mean starting it up through inetd, or
making sure it is linked against the libwrap.a library (./configure
--with-libwrap). The second option would be better IMHO. There is some
overhead each time sshd starts up, so most people run it standalone.

There are ways to create from the "meat" of these CDs a single DVD
which will work with Mandriva's package installation system.  But it
is more trouble than it is worth since, after you do your initial
installation, you usually want to change (redefine) your `urpmi' media
to point to network sources which contain the latest updates.
(`urpmi' is Mandriva's very powerful package installation system.)  So
I would do as Fedor suggests and just burn the iso's to 4 CDs and do
your install from these.

I respectfully disagree.  The easiest way to install k3b on a
Mandriva 2005 LE system is to simply type:

urpmi k3b

On a fresh install this will get it from your installation media
which I believe should include k3b. If you have redefined your
media to point to the correct network sources, then it will get the
latest version available from Mandriva which is:

==> urpmq -r k3b
k3b-0.11.20-7mdk

This is not the absolute latest version on sourceforge, but close
(released in Feb. 05).

To learn how to setup your urpmi media for network package updates, see

It's been my observation that most of the current distributions contain 
ssh/sshd already compiled with tcp_wrappers support.

It works for me, though then again, we have a business account here, 
so our results may not be typical.

Be sure your From: header is *not* comcast.net if you're not sending 
from Comcast's servers, or you may eventually get hamstringed by SPF.

I don't see where people get off that the cable company has that bad 
of tech support.  They're typically friendly, you just have to 
remember they probably have at least a vague idea of what's going on 
from the cable modem to the NOC, and they *have* to work from a 
ticklist even if they do have a clue.  This means when you call, you 
need to call when...

1) You're running on a long fuse.  If you're a happy drunk or a party 
drunk, time to find a bottle of Kokanee.  Usenet reports that other 
ceremonial chemicals may make the hold music "crunchy."

2) You have exhausted every possible option and are prepared to go 
easter egging with a phone monkey[1].  

3) You've already prepared yourself for the shock of lost uptime.  
Expect to reboot at least once for every human you talk to.



[1] I generalized everybody working in any call center environment as 
a phone monkey and offended an acquaintance out of nowhere:  They 
thought I was making a slur against people from India, when I was 
making tongue-in-cheek comment about working in a call center where 
the mandatory ticklist actually does resolve 90% of the problems 
semiautomagically.  A troop of trained monkeys with telephones could 
staff that kind of call queue, it's at worst a 3-bananna job.

Checking the new atomic watch I got for my birthday last month, I note

I wasn't thinking of the staff but of the stated policy of several years ago 
when I first signed up for the service, and of not as many years ago when I 
first connected with a Linux machine.

I haven't had to work with the Comcast staff too often; things work well 
nearly all the time, and the problems I've had are rarely the service. I did 
have occassion to talk to them a few weeks ago when they were having DNS 
server trouble (I think that's what it was). I got a guy who explained the 
problem in moderately technical terms, and my responses probably indicated 
that I understood him. It was a fairly short conversation, but it was 
informative -- there was a problem that they were working hard to resolve, 
and there wasn't anything else that could be done. I was satisfied, and the 
service was restored within an hour or so. The kind of equipment I have was 
never an issue, and never discussed, so I have had no direct experience with 
their current policy towards Linux.

mplayer is in multiple packages.  You need to upgrade both at the same
time.  Either uninstall mplayer and mplayer-fonts and then install the
one or get the updated mplayer-fonts program and install both at once.

Yum will do that depandancy checking for you if you are using a
repository that has mplayer in it. (Like freshrpms.net.)

Seems like you have a one-way pinhole that can sustain two-way
communication, once initiated.  Maybe you need two pinholes, one in each
direction.

That's a real good question. Are you using a journaling filesystem, like
ext3, reiser, etc.? If the last thing that happened is you shut down and
left town, perhaps it wasn't a clean shutdown? Did it fsck when it came
up?

Assuming that the box was really not touched while you were away, it's
hard to think of much else causing the multiple problems you mentioned.
This will probably remain one of those unsolved mysteries :)

Jay Allen? Wow, I might have to get off my behind and make it to this one :)

I remember the first PLUG meeting I attended, back when everyone could fit
around a long table. Jay did a presentation on bootp and diskless clients.
I knew a bit about Linux but not much about networking so much of it was
over my head, but over time as I learned more about networking I would
relate things back to his talk, it really stuck with me.

Reiser.

Couldn't say for sure, partly because I wasn't watching that closely when the 
machine came back up. My recollection is that it was a clean shut down.

connector -- although the difference between DMS and LFH isn't clear to me.

The Dell came with a little splitter that separates the DMS output into 
two VGA channels. The rub is that I need DVI output.

It looks like a few companies produce similar adapters that split the 
DMS output into two DVI channels. Does anyone have any experience with 
these things? I'd prefer some advice before ordering a cable that may or 
may not work.

Subject: [PLUG] Weird Mailman Problems
Message-ID: <428A421D.3060607@comcast.net>

I posted this to the Mailman list but thought I would post it here as 
well to see if any of you had any ideas about what's going on with my 
Mailman setup.

I'm having some strange problems with Mailman and I can't seem to find 
the answers in the FAQ or previous postings. 

1) First off I have a user that sent a message to four of our lists.  
When I reviewed the logs her message only went to 3 of the 4 lists.  The 
first thing I done and redone is check this users permissions and they 
are correct.  I'm using the patch to allow us to create a list of all 
members that can post to a list and she is a member of this list.

2) The second odd thing that is happening is that I seem to have to 
start and stop mailman multiple times a day to get it to send messages.  
What makes this one odd is sometimes a message will come in and go out 
without a problem.  Other times it just gets stuck and the only way to 
make it go is to stop mailman, clean up the locks, and start mailman.  
I've looked at the contents of the lock files and find nothing unusual.  
I've check that the qrunners and they seem to be running as expected.

I'm running Mailman 2.1.5 with Postfix and Cyrus on Fedora Core 2.

Any ideas/suggestions?  Any info from any of these files that might help 
diagnose what's going on here?

TIA

  Migrating from Solaris to Linux is a no-brainer.  It cuts right into
the heart of SUN's market.  Which leads M$ & SUN to conclude, that the
enemy, of my enemy, is my friend.

It is? I've had very good experiences with Solaris, and some of the new
features in Solaris 10 are very interesting. If you were to ask me which
was more enterprise ready, Solaris or Linux, I would answer Solaris. Some
people might view that differently, though.

I discovered ssmtp ( not SSMTP ; the Windows program ) on another list 
and would like to try it out but the documentation is very SUN oriented 
and the page is maintained as part of debian.

So I'm looking for anyone that may have used this program or can recommend
something similar.  ( It replaces sendmail/postfix as an outbound-only
MTA to a mailhub. )
   I've done the same type of thing using perl and some really neat
modules but it would be much better if I could just install a package and
tweaked a few of my scripts.

I'd say that Solaris is often a good choice when you're looking to 
support a third-party application like Oracle, Mentor tools, or the 
like. Sun has done an *outstanding* job of maintaining binary 
compatibility between older and new versions of Solaris.

Solaris is also great in situations where you need more than, say, eight 
processors in one box.

On the other hand, if you're running Free or open-source software which 
you can recompile for newer versions of glibc or the Linux kernel -- and 
you don't need gobs of local processors -- then Linux is, as advertised, 
pretty much a no-brainer.

It certainly depends a lot on the needs of your company. I had a
conversation recently with a Unix admin who told me that he has compared
the numbers and that for his company it is more expensive to run RedHat
than Solaris because of the increases RedHat has made in their support
fees. I haven't compared the numbers directly so I can't say for sure, but
I found it interesting.

Obviously RedHat is not the only option, but most larger companies will
want a Linux distribution from a company with a proven track record and a
dependable support structure.

Things are getting better with Linux, of course, with things like
journaling filesystems and volume management becoming standard, but Sun is
not standing still, either. I have not played with either containers or
Dtrace yet, but these Solaris 10 features are very intriguing.

Heck, if I had to choose between Solaris and a free OS for things like
running Apache, mail, DNS, etc., I'd probably choose FreeBSD, not Linux. I
have found FreeBSD to be more rock-solid. Again, that's just my
experience, YMMV.

First time I'd heard of it being present on shipping hardware. I'd seen
it called "DMS-59". DMS-59 is pretty much a pair of DVI connectors merged
together. I haven't heard of any connector designated "LFH".

No experience, but it should work as advertised assuming everyone did
their job right.

This is typically true in places with a significant amount of SPARC machines
lying about. Even in x86 land w/ Sun Hardware, Solaris (especially v 10 ) looks
very very attractive.

Realistically speaking for mission critical stuff, your safe pointy hair
friendly options are limited to: SuSE/Novell or Redhat. 

 IMHO  I think Solaris has the edge in such environments.  Not to say Linux
isn't maturing very quickly,  but as someone who works with both platforms, I
would say Solaris seems to handle things a bit better overall for Internet
Infrastructure Applications.

Last I checked, Solaris 10 costs $0 too:) Which is cheaper than it's larger iron
competition, AIX...

It might be a no brainer if you are building something from the ground up with
no legacy elements at all, but in the real world that luxury is very rare. 

I think the impetus for people leaving solaris in the first place was cost, as
Sun really had no competition in some markets for many years and probably gouged
a few larger customers one to many times... But once the price drops, they start
coming back, even if they still had the bad taste in their mouth.

As a reminder, Jax now has an open wireless access point and they
appreciate the business.  The circuit is quite robust for a public
access point.  However, it is a residential grade router without any
sort of per-connection throttling so please play nice and avoid scarfing
down the latest torrent of <insert distribution here>.  :)

This is a guru-level opportunity and compensation will scale accordingly.

Yeah, Linux-UltraSPARC isn't in the best shape. On x86 though SunOS is
ludicrus. The large multiprocessor machines have tended to be UltraSPARC
which aids SunOS in the multiprocessor area.

HP has been supporting Debian. I believe a couple other companies have
been supporting Debian on their hardware.

Make sure she is actually sending from the same address she is signed
up as.  This has caught me before.  To do this, you have to look at 
the incoming mail spool, then trace the message into mailman.

I recently had problems with a mailman list that got too big for the
MIRV settings I had configured for postfix.  That caused some things
to snag.   I set "SMTP_MAX_RCPT=8" in /var/mailman/Mailman/mm_cfg.py
to fix that.

Your problems may be in the interaction with the SMTP program
(sendmail/postfix/exim) rather than mailman itself.   Again, look
at all the logs, all the way through the system.

I figure those answers have about a 20% chance of solving your
problems, and an additional 30% chance of inducing a D'oh/headslap
moment.  Beyond that, I will leave it to experts like Wil.

I'm not so sure that's the case. Sun is now selling Opteron boxes 
themselves, and I would assume their OS will run very well on that 
hardware, at least.

I may be working with some of them soon, so I guess I'll find out :)

I agree.  However, sun seems to be banking on AMD64, so we'll see how long their
SPARC bigotry will last in terms of features for Solaris.

That's outstanding news... I hear that IBM will technically support any distro
as well as long as you throw enough dollars at them, but the quality of the
support can be pretty lack luster compared to support from more established players.

  I have no complaints with Solaris.  I was a Solaris admin in a
previous life.  I like the OS.    I have major heartaches with SUN's
sales departments.  I wrote some ridiculously expensive PO's to SUN
back when I was an admin.  The joke around the office was that the SUN
salesman included the cost of a new car to every SPARC quote.  I have
an even lower opinion of HPUX for the same reason.

  I would never want to be in a singe vendor situation again.  I'd
rather send my hardware RFC to Compaq, Dell, IBM, *and* SUN.  May the
company with the best value win.

I didn't say it wouldn't run, I merely said it is ludicrus. My experience
was with 5.7 x86, so they may of improved. At the time Linux was a heck
of a lot faster and cheaper, so except for the consistancy (a massive
issue in some cases). I was left with the feeling of "why bother?"
(except for the consistancy issue). At this point 5.10 may have
comparable speed, but Linux has grabbed the commercial support (I'm
refering to hardware/software vendors), and choose the right distribution
and stability isn't an issue. So I'm still left asking the question "why
bother?"

I'm tempted to suggest that SPARC is well past its heyday and may in fact
be dying out...  Once you've moved off SPARC, why bother with SunOS?

The Debian developers are tending to get swallowed by HP. There isn't
wide support, but a few companies will do Debian as well.

Portland is blessed with /two/ PLUG groups, the regular group and
evil twin Skippy PLUG.  So I wonder how many other PLUG groups there
are in the world?  Here is a quick count:

Provo, Utah ( which has plug.org )
Phoenix, AZ
Purdue University
Peterborough, UK
Penang, Malaysia
Punjab, India
Perth, Australia
Prairie (Winnipeg) CA
Pretoria, South Africa
Pusan, Korea
La Plata, Argentina
Poland
Peru

That's 15,  with 11 in English (incl. Penang and Punjab).  Any others? 
Should we set up a "twisted sister city" program?

The sun never sets on the PLUG empire.

Might try PC Heidens, they have it together when it comes to connectors and

I would hope so. Solaris 7 came out something like 5 years ago. Think 
for a minute about how much Linux has grown in that time.

In the meantime Sun has continued to add on new features. I think the 
RBAC ACLs showed up in Solaris 9, before any of the Liux distros 
included anything like SELinux. Other things like volume management have 
been around there for much longer, too. Not all of the cool things in 
Solaris 10 are supported on x86 yet (like containers), but they will be.

You say that consistancy has been a massive issue with Linux, then you 
say, "Why bother?" I think you may have answered your own question.

I like Linux a lot, don't get me wrong, I have been using it for 
something like 10 years now and actually have a lot more experience with 
it than Solaris. But it has had some real shortcomings in the past when 
it comes to enterprise readiness and stability. There have been some 
kernel releases I used in the past that had some really painful problems.

I'm not saying people should not use Linux, don't get me wrong, 
especially on x86. But I just don't agree with people in this thread who 
have said things like "no brainer" and "ludicrous." I don't think it's 
ludicrous at all to look at different tools and evaluate which you think 
will work best for you. If you were to ask me what's ludicrous, I'd lean 
more towards making judgements about an OS based on a version you tried 
5 years ago.

Keith,

   Perhaps we should plug them on our web site if they return the favor and

Today I must have typed su and my password at least a hundred times. I
am told you're not supposed to log in as root, but this is getting
seriously tedious. Today I needed to verify that files on an external
USB hard disk were unaffected by the sudden demise of the hard disk in
my Windows 2000 computer. "You don't have permission" is all I can get.
Man, I bought that hard disk, I put the files on it, this computer
should be smart enough to realize that. Getting pissed here.

I tried everything, but can't figure out how to give myself permission
to see those files in the Nautilus file manager window. I typed su and
my password in a command line, but Nautilus remains unimpressed.

OK, in Windows I am user jjj, but I am also the Administrator account.
During Windows 2000 installation it creates the Administrator account
and you have to create a password for it. Then you can create a user
account to use for ordinary daily work. But when I created the jjj
account I gave it administrator privileges. Now jjj can do anything on
that machine that Administrator can do.

On this Linux machine I am root and I am also jjj. I just spent the past
hour and a half reading about ACLs, but none of it made any sense to me.
Plus finals are coming up in three weeks and I'm running out of time.
How can I give jjj permanent root permission?

Sudo is the answer you are looking for

Download and install sudo if you don't have it..


which sudo

Should answer  .. /usr/bin/sudo
Check /etc/sudoers
to /etc/sudoers  add the line
<as  root>
jjj  ALL=(ALL) ALL


Then when  you want to run a command place the word sudo in front of it..

If by "evil twin Skippy PLUG" you mean PDXLUG, you might take note that
PDXLUG doesn't go by PLUG (and, afaik, isn't actually evil).

If you meant there's another evil twin Skippy PLUG out there, I wonder

It's su followed by *root* password, not yours.  Root and your normal user
also should not have the same password.

su only affects the shell you're currently in, not the desktop environment.

Which is just as bad as running as root, since Administrator gives you the
same privleges as root in that environment.  You shouldn't run as
administrator.

Congratulations, you've created a second root account and you're logging in as
root.  Setting up a second account to do daily stuff in with administrator
privleges negates any and all security benefit gained by setting up a user
account.  (And people wonder why Windows users spread so many viruses...)

The *NIX Way is fundamentally different than the Redmond way, and it's 
not easy to change over.  Hang in there while you learn it!

Running su in a command prompt will only give that command prompt root 
priviliges.  Nautilus inherits it's privileges from the user you logged 
into X with, and since it's not a good idea to log into your X session 
as root (some distros won't even let you), it's better to investigate 
another method.

In this case your system sounds like it's mounting the USB mass storage 
device with root as the owner, and thus your user account doesn't have 
permission.  What distribution are you using?  I was under the 
impression that most of them granted permission to the console for 
automounted USBish devices now.

Anyway, try unmounting and remounting the USB device, this time 
specifying your username as the owner:

1) Open a root shell and type "mount", paying attention to where the USB 
mass storage device is mounted.  You want to know two things here, first 
the mount point (something like /mnt/usb, or /media/LEXAR), and second 
the device that is mounted there (something like /dev/sda1).
2) In the root shell type "umount /path/to/usb/device"
3) In the root shell type "mount -o uid=<your username> /dev/<device> 
/<mountpoint>"

Now you should have the USB device mounted on your system with your user 
as the owner of all the files.  Note that hotplug/automount/etc. 
probably won't handle unplugging the device once you've done this, so 
before you unplug it you should unmount it again.

You should use 'visudo' to edit the sudoers file.  Set EDITOR in your
environment if you don't know vi (nano for example: 'export
EDITOR=nano').  'sudo' times out in 5 minutes per terminal, which can
make it almost as tedious as 'su'.  I recommend adding the following
settings in addition to the above:

Defaults timestamp_timeout=60
Defaults !tty_tickets

This extends the timeout to 60 minutes and makes the time-out updates
separate from the particular terminal.  If you want to do a bunch of
things as root, then 'sudo -s' will start a root shell as 'su' does.
You'll still get into a bind if you need to run X applications.  I
prefer to setup SSH keys and use SSH locally to do the X forwarding, but
I don't know if I can give you the full instructions for doing it
yourself, so instead just use 'xhost +localhost'.

I started with Windows twelve years ago with a new Windows NT 3.1
computer. I have always given my user account full administrator
privileges. I have also also always had an internet connection, although
with cable only for the past three years. I have NEVER had a virus, worm
or other nasty. Mind you my computers are behind a router and firewall.
And I do not use Microsoft products other than the OS -- no Outlook,
Internet Explorer, etc.

OK, just tell me how to make the Nautilus file manager let me see and
manipulate the files on my disks. I just can't use this computer if I
can't see all the files on it. This is a standalone computer, not a
workstation in a mega corporate setting. It's not like there's a system
administrator I can call up to fix something for me. The system
administrator is me.

The concept of least privilege is not only for virus/worm/other nasty 
stuff.  It is also useful to keep you from shooting yourself in the foot.

Rather than trying to elevate your user accounts privileges to root, try 
learning how to change the permissions/ownership on the resource you are 
trying to access so that your unprivileged account can access it.  This 
will allow you to get what you need done, as well as avoid having 
privileges that can delete your entire hard drive with a single 
no-confirmation command (rm -rf /).

It can be frustrating, since the simple solution is just to do what 
Windows does.  But learning how to do it the *NIX way will be worth it 
for you in the end.  Besides, it is my understanding that MS will be 
moving away from the administrator-as-your-daily-account philosophy with 
Longhorn.

In closing, some light reading material:

http://ldp.dimstar.net/HOWTO/DOS-Win-to-Linux-HOWTO.html
http://ldp.dimstar.net/HOWTO/Flash-Memory-HOWTO/index.html

If you're using a RedHatish (i.e. Fedora) distro, the RHEL4 
documentation can be good too:
http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/enterprise/

The intro to sysadmin one might be good for ya.  If you feel like 
melting your brain, try reading the SELinux guide.  Ugh.

OK, permission for the device sounds like it will solve the problem. I'm
going to have to tackle that later, however. Right now I just logged out
and back in again as root so I could see that the backup I made last
night was intact. I was trying to make another backup this morning when
the machine locked up. I restarted it and when it started up it
complained that the file system on the external USB drive (FAT32) was
corrupt and needed to be fixed. Scary, considering that the previous
full backup I have is two weeks old, with incrementals until a week ago
when I didn't realize the tape was full. Plus, those were to tape, and
my tape drive is dead.

I am sorry if I sounded short here tonight. It's been a bitch of a day.
Just the time I'll have to spend putting my Windows 2000 computer back
together is bad enough, but the thought of losing a couple weeks work
has had me on edge all day. I have classes all day tomorrow and I
haven't done all the reading I was supposed to either. 

Also, I tend to object when people assume that Windows users are stupid.
OK, maybe I am. I'm trying to learn Linux, but it's going to take me a
long time. In the meantime I'm going to have to take some risks. I'll
probably shoot myself in the foot a few times too. But if you never take
the first step, then you never get anywhere. Also, it does not further
the Linux movement to think non-Linux users are dumb. Makes us dumb
people get all defensive.

In the meantime, I completed finally the download of the full Mandriva
2005 Limited Edition DVD .x86_64. With luck I'll have it installed
before the Clinic meeting this Saturday. With even more luck the video
will finally be right and everything will work. Keep your fingers
crossed for me.

Now I'm going to go for a short run and crash. You guys are great.

The clock on this machine is running at exactly double time. It's a
known problem with Linux on the Compaq R4000. Several others have
reported it as well.

I set it to UTC, but it doesn't correct itself until I manually go in
and hit the reset button. And every time time I have to log in as root
first. Having the computer display the correct time is a serious
security issue in Linux. After all, only system administrators can be
entrusted with vital information like what time it is.

OK, I'll shut up and go to bed now.

Sure, it worked fine. Yet it didn't support as much hardware, and it was
a total slug compared to Linux.

What _compelling_ advantage does SunOS x86 have over Linux though?
Reportedly with 5.10 they've come close to Linux in speed, so that is no
longer a compelling reason to avoid SunOS, but now the commercial
software for x86 is coming out for Linux, not SunOS.

Wrong sort of consistancy. If you've got a shop that is entirely
SunOS-SPARC, x86 is a significant inconsistancy; Linux is a much larger
inconsistancy. If you don't have an existing SunOS-SPARC installation,
why bother?

This is mostly distribution choice. RedHat non-enterprise shouldn't be
compared to SunOS. By contrast Debian tends to compare quite favorability
IMO.

I've continued to keep some track of SunOS (eternal CS accounts have
their uses). I still don't see worthy of a changeover, except in a few
specific cases (>16 procs, or an existing installation).

Years ago. That was a very early version of it for x86, the first IIRR. I
don't think it's a fair basis for comparison. I could tell you a lot of
very bad things about RedHat 4.x too (no shadow passwords by default,
Sendmail and Bind both running as root and not chrooted, etc.), but would
that be a proper basis to evaluate their current releases?

> What _compelling_ advantage does SunOS x86 have over Linux though?

Have you read about the new features in Solaris 10? As I mentioned, they
have not all been implemented on x86, but I believe Dtrace is already
there. I can definitely think of some environments where containers would
be very useful. How about predictive self healing? Again, I don't believe
it is there for x86 yet, but it will be.

Whether those technologies are a compelling reason enough for you or not
is something you would have to evaluate for yourself. If you are willing
to give them an honest evaluation, then I don't see that as being the same
thing as a "no brainer."

Well, the impetuts of this thread was not comparing the two on x86, it was
talking about migrating from existing Solaris installations to Linux. If
the apps you need are already supported on Solaris for your platform, then
I don't see switching to Linux as a no brainer. I see it as something that
would merit quite a bit of thoughtful consideration, actually.

Now that Sun is actually selling x86 boxes, I would also expect more
commercial hardware and software support for Solaris on x86. We'll see. If
you would have asked me a few years ago, my opinion would have been that
Solaris would be fairly dead in the water by now. I don't think that's the
case, they seem to be moving forward very well and even adding new
technologies.

Linux has been ahead of even the other free *nixes in hardware support for
quite some time. I don't see that as an overwhelming reason to use it even
over something like FreeBSD, unless there is a specific piece of hardware
that I need to use which the other option does not support. Unless you're
talking desktops, in that case the hardware support is much more
important.

Perhaps it does. Again, "compares quite favorably" and "no brainer" sound
quite different to me.

And painful kernel releases have not been due to a specific vendor. They
may apply their own patches, but the kernel is not developed by one
company.

Well, "not worthy of a changeover" and "ludicrous" sound like two
different evaluations to me. Perhaps we are past the hyperbole?

One of the reasons I started using Linux is because I tend to think
outside the box a bit. It worked very well for the tasks I needed to use
it for, and I like to choose tools based on their value in what I am
trying to accomplish. I am not religious when it comes to Linux or even
specific Linux distributions.

I have also had very good experiences with Solaris, especially in some
environments where availability was extremely important. I think it's a
very rock-solid OS, and not one that I would quickly dismiss as an option
for many tasks.

The fact that you are still repeating your experiences with Solaris 7 on
x86 leads me to conclude that you have not put much energy in evaluating
the newest, more mature versions, no matter how many old shells you have
on Sun boxes. That's fine, I certainly can't tell you how to spend your
time, but I think it's pretty laughable to talk about how slow x86 Solaris
was in a version that was released years ago. Why bother? What does that
have to do with what we're talking about? Yes, the early x86 releases had
a lot of issues, I don't know anyone who would dispute that.

If you want to see how it performs now, all you have to do is grab the
ISOs and burn some CDs.

Dtrace is very cool.  However, most of the other functionality in Solaris 10
is playing catchup to the new functionality that is available or will be
soon  available in Linux.

I've been administering Sun equipment for more than 10 years and I have
overall been disappointed with the Solaris 10 release.

I have to admit Dtrace is very nice.

However the Solaris zones are based on the BSD jails.  They are much less
capable and flexable than virtulization technologies on Linux now such as
User Mode Linux.  The only advantage they have over User Mode Linux is they
are a bit more efficient speedwise.  With Xen coming soon that advantage
looks likely to disappear as well.  The fact that Solaris zones share a
kernel means that applications such as oracle which require kernel patches
affect all the zones on the server.  It also means it's not possible to run
different Solaris versions in different zones.  Mind you they aren't bad for
stuff like web sites and stuff but they are a lot less capable than options
on Linux today.

The other major capability of Solaris 10 was supposed to be the Petabyte
Filesystem.  Except that was removed from the first Solaris 10 release. 
Which is to bad, since it supposed to have some real awesome functionality. 
In many ways it sounds like the Tru64 Unix advfs on steroids.

One really nice function of Solaris 10 that gets overlooked is the new
services framework that replaces most of the older SysV startup scripts and
inetd.  The change makes the system start up much faster.

Overall, Solaris 10 looks like an attempt by Sun to play catchup with many
of the new technologies that have recently been added to Linux or are
looking to be available in the near future.

I think Solaris 10 and modern Linux distributions are pretty close to the
same level at this point.  Each has advantages the other doesn't so it
depends on what people are going to use it for.  However, Solaris was way
ahead of Linux 2 years ago, if Sun doesn't step up their pace of innovation
Linux is going to surpass them in the next year or so and Solaris will most
likely never catch back up.

People will say all kinds of things on a mailing list. Some of them will

That is the beginning of wisdom.  Anyone who tells you that learning
linux is not a whole lot of work is a bald-faced liar.  You seem to want
to really understand things, and so for you there will be cursing,
pulling of hair, weeping and gnashing of teeth.  (Was it any different

This is so true. A Unix/Linux system puts an incredible amount of 
power at your fingertips, but it takes time and concerted effort to 
learn. Much of the power and flexibility you won't need, at least 
right away, and you'll curse the learning curve. Once you start 
applying that power to solving your needs, however, all those dusty 
corners won't seem so odd after all!

If you have the time to read it, the section of Neal Stephenson's 
essay "In the Beginning was the Command Line" quoted below is quite 
instructive.

-- Paul Heinlein <heinlein at madboa.com>


THE HOLE HAWG OF OPERATING SYSTEMS

Unix has always lurked provocatively in the background of the 
operating system wars, like the Russian Army. Most people know it only 
by reputation, and its reputation, as the Dilbert cartoon suggests, is 
mixed. But everyone seems to agree that if it could only get its act 
together and stop surrendering vast tracts of rich agricultural land 
and hundreds of thousands of prisoners of war to the onrushing 
invaders, it could stomp them (and all other opposition) flat.

It is difficult to explain how Unix has earned this respect without 
going into mind-smashing technical detail. Perhaps the gist of it can 
be explained by telling a story about drills.

The Hole Hawg is a drill made by the Milwaukee Tool Company. If you 
look in a typical hardware store you may find smaller Milwaukee drills 
but not the Hole Hawg, which is too powerful and too expensive for 
homeowners. The Hole Hawg does not have the pistol-like design of a 
cheap homeowner's drill. It is a cube of solid metal with a handle 
sticking out of one face and a chuck mounted in another. The cube 
contains a disconcertingly potent electric motor. You can hold the 
handle and operate the trigger with your index finger, but unless you 
are exceptionally strong you cannot control the weight of the Hole 
Hawg with one hand; it is a two-hander all the way. In order to fight 
off the counter-torque of the Hole Hawg you use a separate handle 
(provided), which you screw into one side of the iron cube or the 
other depending on whether you are using your left or right hand to 
operate the trigger. This handle is not a sleek, ergonomically 
designed item as it would be in a homeowner's drill. It is simply a 
foot-long chunk of regular galvanized pipe, threaded on one end, with 
a black rubber handle on the other. If you lose it, you just go to the 
local plumbing supply store and buy another chunk of pipe.

During the Eighties I did some construction work. One day, another 
worker leaned a ladder against the outside of the building that we 
were putting up, climbed up to the second-story level, and used the 
Hole Hawg to drill a hole through the exterior wall. At some point, 
the drill bit caught in the wall. The Hole Hawg, following its one and 
only imperative, kept going. It spun the worker's body around like a 
rag doll, causing him to knock his own ladder down. Fortunately he 
kept his grip on the Hole Hawg, which remained lodged in the wall, and 
he simply dangled from it and shouted for help until someone came 
along and reinstated the ladder.

I myself used a Hole Hawg to drill many holes through studs, which it 
did as a blender chops cabbage. I also used it to cut a few 
six-inch-diameter holes through an old lath-and-plaster ceiling. I 
chucked in a new hole saw, went up to the second story, reached down 
between the newly installed floor joists, and began to cut through the 
first-floor ceiling below. Where my homeowner's drill had labored and 
whined to spin the huge bit around, and had stalled at the slightest 
obstruction, the Hole Hawg rotated with the stupid consistency of a 
spinning planet. When the hole saw seized up, the Hole Hawg spun 
itself and me around, and crushed one of my hands between the steel 
pipe handle and a joist, producing a few lacerations, each surrounded 
by a wide corona of deeply bruised flesh. It also bent the hole saw 
itself, though not so badly that I couldn't use it. After a few such 
run-ins, when I got ready to use the Hole Hawg my heart actually began 
to pound with atavistic terror.

But I never blamed the Hole Hawg; I blamed myself. The Hole Hawg is 
dangerous because it does exactly what you tell it to. It is not bound 
by the physical limitations that are inherent in a cheap drill, and 
neither is it limited by safety interlocks that might be built into a 
homeowner's product by a liability-conscious manufacturer. The danger 
lies not in the machine itself but in the user's failure to envision 
the full consequences of the instructions he gives to it.

A smaller tool is dangerous too, but for a completely different 
reason: it tries to do what you tell it to, and fails in some way that 
is unpredictable and almost always undesirable. But the Hole Hawg is 
like the genie of the ancient fairy tales, who carries out his 
master's instructions literally and precisely and with unlimited 
power, often with disastrous, unforeseen consequences.

Pre-Hole Hawg, I used to examine the drill selection in hardware 
stores with what I thought was a judicious eye, scorning the smaller 
low-end models and hefting the big expensive ones appreciatively, 
wishing I could afford one of them babies. Now I view them all with 
such contempt that I do not even consider them to be real 
drills--merely scaled-up toys designed to exploit the self-delusional 
tendencies of soft-handed homeowners who want to believe that they 
have purchased an actual tool. Their plastic casings, carefully 
designed and focus-group-tested to convey a feeling of solidity and 
power, seem disgustingly flimsy and cheap to me, and I am ashamed that 
I was ever bamboozled into buying such knicknacks.

It is not hard to imagine what the world would look like to someone 
who had been raised by contractors and who had never used any drill 
other than a Hole Hawg. Such a person, presented with the best and 
most expensive hardware-store drill, would not even recognize it as 
such. He might instead misidentify it as a child's toy, or some kind 
of motorized screwdriver. If a salesperson or a deluded homeowner 
referred to it as a drill, he would laugh and tell them that they were 
mistaken--they simply had their terminology wrong. His interlocutor 
would go away irritated, and probably feeling rather defensive about 
his basement full of cheap, dangerous, flashy, colorful tools.

Unix is the Hole Hawg of operating systems, and Unix hackers, like 
Doug Barnes and the guy in the Dilbert cartoon and many of the other 
people who populate Silicon Valley, are like contractor's sons who 
grew up using only Hole Hawgs. They might use Apple/Microsoft OSes to 
write letters, play video games, or balance their checkbooks, but they 
cannot really bring themselves to take these operating systems 
seriously.

Eventually, the bastards might even make it in.  So I downloaded a program
called DenyHosts ( http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net ) which is called from
cron, scans /var/log/secure and adds entries to /etc/hosts.deny .

The python program install isn't well documented (including a bit about
"from version import VERSION" which I commented out) and I would prefer
something that responded to the log process itself rather than being called
by cron to scan /var/log files.  At first, I thought it would be better to
just block the troublesome site with iptables rather than hosts.deny, but
the fine-grain control of hosts.deny does give me the opportunity to tweak
things by a back door after a DOS attack, and hosts.deny is permanent
through reboots.

cause the change to persist across reboots.

A lot of apps support SunOS-SPARC, most of those are supporting Linux
when they move to x86. I'm not seeing much news of apps supporting
SunOS-x86, this could be due to that being less of a revolution, but this
doesn't give me a good feeling about SunOS-x86.

I was ment not worth changing over to SunOS (I figured evaluating the
value of going the other direction was worthwhile). I said going for
SunOS on x86 was pretty well ludicrus. If you're going for more than 16
processor systems, there is a good chance you're looking at SPARC at
which point the choice is much harder. If you're looking 5-10 years down
the road SunOS's future looks *very* shaky, a very compelling reason to
look towards Linux. This means it is a no brainer to start work on Linux.

The past is very good guidance for future choices. If someone needed a
full evaluation today, I'd do it. At the moment I'm relying on what
passes in front of me for new data. I haven't seen anything come by that
strongly encourages me to reevaluate...

If I felt there was compelling reason to think SunOS's future was bright.
At the moment I'd rather spend time doing things other than engaging in
unpaid fights with OSes.

I know some of this is being tossed around by the Fedora guys.  Apple 
OSX 10.4 (Tiger) has a new open-source replacement for init called 
launchd which could be used, or something like initng might be used.  I 
haven't seen Tiger yet, but launchd is supposed to pull off something 
like 15 seconds from boot to desktop.  I think they're both supposed to 
do better dependency checks as well.  Sounds cool.

launchd is, as I understand it, far more than just init.  It also
handles things like cron and other stuff I just don't remember.  It also
uses XML for configuration (a good thing, imho).

I liked what I read when I read about it... if only I had some PPC
hardware to play around with.

It does, of course, kinda fly in the face of "the unix way" a little bit.

Please. It was a very early version of the OS on that platform. You have 
even indicated in other messages that you have heard it performs closer 
to Linux in newer versions. So why keep going back and talking about how 
slow it was years ago? It's like you're digging for ammo.

I haven't done any benchmarks, but I am running it in a VMWare instance 
right now and my quick feel is that the performance is comparable to 
Linux, certainly in the same league. As I mentioned, I may be working 
with Solaris 10 x86 in a few months, and if I do I'll get a better idea 
there.

Well, if you need someone to bill to look at it, then perhaps we just 
have different outlooks on the subject. How you spend your time is 
certainly up to you. But your experience years ago is just not a very 
strong point to argue, it's next to meaningless.

I just upgraded a couple of Macs from OS X 1.3 to 1.4 (1.4.1 just came out 
BTW). The G5 machine definitely boots faster with 1.4 than 1.3. The 800 MHz 
640 MB G3 iBook is now so friggin' slow that I lose interest before it gets 
started. 10.3 wasn't fast on the G3, but at least it was usable. I'm blowing 
10.4 aware and going back to 10.3 on that machine.

I would suggest sudo or su -m and running the program you want to run 
specifically from the rootprompt you get there.

That doesn't stop the fact that by setting administrator privs on a 
normal user account undermines the security model of the OS.

Use mc in a root shell, it accepts mouse input if you run it in a 
terminal in X.  It's a bit towards the minimalistic side, but for the 
amount of time you're probably going to spend as root, that's not a 
bad thing.

Oh, finally!  It only took them, by the time it gets out, something on

I think you're reading too much into it.  Windows users find 
themselves at the short end of a culture-shock during transition.  
Different methods for support and saner defaults tend to make Windows 
look a tad on the insane side.

Not with that attitude, you'll probably pick it up a lot quicker than

Unfortunately, in email we have to go by words alone, and save for 
email addresses ending with @msntv.com or @aol.com, we don't have any 
equivalent of wearing a big sign that says "I'M STUPID."  The 
intuitive course of action when dealing with someone of unknown 
intelligence when they're on the path to destruction is usually to 
say, "Now, you might not understand this, but that's going to hurt!"

OK, I'm calling your bluff.  It's not *that* hard to learn, especially 
these days.  You have free support at just a google or an email away, 
and as many second opinions as you need in the same place.  Unix just 
has some fundamental differences from the Microsoft approach that 
take getting used to if you have only been exposed to the Microsoft 
approach.  Once you get over that mental hurdle, the rest really just 
falls into place.

That being said, if you're handy on MacOS X, you won't be at a loss 
here, just be extra careful until you get used to the differences in 
UI, particularly with command flags while you're getting adjusted.

Well, I only spent about a year going through fits learning Linux, 
took me half a decade to get the Microsoft approach down, and I was 
exposed to that first.  I was able to pick up Linux and now consider 
myself considerably more proficient in Linux than Windows.

Subject: [PLUG] Using K3b to Kreate Koasters
Message-ID: <428C3F3E.26509.2494A88@localhost>

OK, finally got my Windows 2000 computer restored after hard disk 
failure (whew!), and am back to working on the Compaq R4000 
laptop. I have downloaded the Mandriva Linux 2005 Limited Edition 
DVD.x86_64.iso (three files, see below) and am trying to burn it to 
bootable DVD. So far I have created four coasters. (Yes, the 
computer is set to boot first from the CD/DVD drive.)

Last night I managed to get K3b installed, but so far I am still 
making coasters. I've read the Help but it didn't help. I know how to 
do this in Nero 5.5 on my Windows 2000 computer, although it 
wasn't easy to figure out there either. Unfortunately the Windows 
2000 computer does not have a DVD writer, so I have to do it from 
the laptop. Right now I have K3b open and the three files that I 
downloaded from MandrivaClub are listed in DataDVD3 window as 
a K3b Data Project:

Mandriva-Linux-2005-Limited-Edition-DVD.x86_64.iso
Mandriva-Linux-2005-Limited-Edition-DVD.x86_64.md5.asc
Mandriva-Linux-2005-Limited-Edition-DVD.x86_64.sha1.asc

The type and size are, respectively:

ISO9660 Image Ifle, 4.3 Gb
OpenPGP Key Bundle, 321 B
OpenPGP Key Bundle, 329 B

I think I am doing something fundamentally wrong. Can someone 
please tell me where the right buttons are before I make even more 
coasters?

Putting them in a project just burns the files to a data disk.

You need to "Burn image to disk".

This is under the "Tools>DVD>Burn Image" menu option. When you open 
that, you then select the iso file, and burn only that image. The other 
two files are not part of the iso, they are verification files.

Message-ID: <200505190807.20773.rsteff.l@comcast.net>

I'm working on installing Art of Illusion, which is modeling and rendering 
program (http://www.artofillusion.org/). It is written in Java, and can use 
the Java Media Framework, which is the part I'm trying to install, now. There 
is a diagnostic page at:

http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/2.1.1/jmfdiagnostics.html

When it loads, I get the error message:

JMF classes.....Not Found

Following Sun's instructions, I set the following environment variables from 
the terminal (I've also exported them in my .profile file):

JMFHOME=/home/someuser/JMF2.1.1
CLASSPATH=$JMFHOME/lib/jmf.jar:$JMFHOME/lib/sound.jar:.:${CLASSPATH}
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$JMFHOME/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

I don't understand the last part of the last two variables, the part that 
encloses the variable I'm setting in a pair of braces. When I look at the 
variables with echo, I get this:

> echo $CLASSPATH
/home/rsteff/JMF2.1.1/lib/jmf.jar:/home/rsteff/JMF2.1.1/lib/sound.jar:.:
> echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
/home/rsteff/JMF2.1.1/lib:

I assume I should be getting something after the trailing : and that this is 
why the diagnostic page tells me it can't find the CLASSPATH.

The troubleshooting information on the diagnostic page says:

Classes not found: JMF classes are not included in the CLASSPATH environment 
variable. Please make sure the CLASSPATH points to jmf.jar that comes with 
your installation.

jmf.jar is found in /home/rsteff/JMF-2.1.1e/lib

Any ideas?

OK, I tried that. I have the ISO file above in the Burn ISO9660 
Image window, in the Image to Burn box. But down below it says 
No Image File Selected and the Start button is grayed out.

Previously I used Nautilus to do something that made an ISO 
image on disk, which I thought included all three files. When I put 
this image in the Image to Burn box it shows down below a filesize 
of 366 Kb and an Md5 Sum, among other things. The Start button 
is enabled. But when I click start it appears to burn it to DVD, but 
when it is done all that is on the DVD are the two small files. The 
ISO that I made on disk with Nautilus is 366 Kb. And I don't 
remember how I made it, but it must have been wrong.

Part of what I don't understand is why the file I downloaded from 
Mandriva Club is actually three files, one of which is an ISO that 
doesn't include the data necessary to burn it to DVD as an image.

Still confused :(

Under the "Image to Burn" text you need to specify the path to the ISO file.

if I put the ISO that I downloaded into the Image to Burn box, the 
box underneath says "No Image File Selected" and the box does 
not accept input.

I think I need to take the three files I downloaded and amalgamate 
them into a new ISO on disk somehow. Then that image is what 
goes in the top box. I did that before with Nautilus, but I don't 
remember how. But it doesn't matter that I can't remember how I 
did it, because it created a 366 Kb ISO, so it was wrong anyway.

Okay, are you sure you are entering the path to the file itself? For example:

/home/username/myfile.iso

The other files you don't need to worry about. the md5 and sha1 files are just 
there so you can do a checksum on the ISO image to ensure you have the real 
ISO. In fact, K3B will create the md5 checksum as soon as you put the path 
for the ISO in.

If the file is valid, it will show the information for the image. Valid 
or not, this will include an MD5sum that you can compare to that md5.asc 
file you have.

It sounds like you didn't get a complete file.

What are the contents of the md5.asc and sha1.asc files? You should have 
a checksum in each. You can get an md5sum on the iso file with the 
following command:

#md5sum Mandriva-Linux-2005-Limited-Edition-DVD.x86_64.iso

This will result in a string of numbers and letters with the filename 
after it. Compare this string to the contents of the md5.asc file. If 
they don't match, you don't have a valid file. Depending on how you 
downloaded the file, you may be able to recover, or you may have to 
download the whole file again.

Well, an md5sum can be generated for any file. You have to compare it to 
the string  from a known good source to verify the file.

So it sounds like you are burning an iso that contains those two files, 
not an iso that contains the Mandrake installation dvd.

Without knowing the exact steps you went through at the time, there's no 
way for us to know either. It doesn't really matter anyway. What we need 
to do is determine what you do have, and go forward from here.

Let us know what the results of the md5sum test above is, and we'll try 
to go forward from there.

You can also browse for the ISO image file from the "Burn Iso9660 Image" 
dialog by pressing the button with the image of an open file folder on it 
that is to the right of the textfield for the image file name.

First, a pedantic point about your terminology: SunOS & Solaris are
two different flavors of UNIX. SunOS is a BSD-based flavor that Sun used
to offer, but stopped selling it about 10 years ago; I suspect that they
stopped supporting it at least 5 years ago. Solaris is a SysVr4-based
flavor, & is what Sun currently sells & supports.

In other words, call Sun with a question about SunOS, & they'll likely
tell you to upgrade & hang up on you -- even if you mean Solaris.

Second, about SOLARIS-x86: in short, it's always been the mostly-ignored
step-child of Sun's offerings, & even in the best of times it's never
got much support. (Sun even tried to kill it at least once in the
late 1990s.) The only figure I've ever seen for how many people used it
was back in 1999/2000, & it was pathetic: about 10,000 users. And I
suspect that most of that number were SysAdmins who used it on a home
PC to learn more about the system.

In short, the market for Solaris-x86 is so small that there's no incentive
to advertise for it. But there is third-party support for it out there;
I can speak from personal experience Intel actively supports its NICs
for that OS.

Learning a new OS always depends on your intent in learning computers.
It can sometimes be useful to experience a new way of solving familiar
problems -- or picking up a niche expertise for the job market. (At the
very least, working with SCO UNIX for a few months gave me more reasons
to recommend avoiding or replacing it than the well-known SCO Group
vs. IBM lawsuit -- which everyone by now has made up their minds about.)

Yes and no. SunOS and Solaris are marketing terms for somewhat, but 
entirely, dissimilar Unix products. The SunOS product line ended with 
version 4.1.3. I still have login rights to SPARC running it:

$ uname -sr
SunOS 4.1.3_U1

The Solaris product line picked up where SunOS left off and became 
"SunOS 5." Hence the odd uname report on a Solaris 9 system:

$ uname -sr
SunOS 5.9

This isn't merely semantics. Many (most? all?) binaries compiled on a 
SunOS 4 box will run unmodified under Solaris.

That, of course, should read "not entirely." Sigh. Even the coffee isn't

Yes. The files are in /home/jjj/desktop/. After dragging the ISO into 
the top box, it says:

file:/home/jjj/Desktop/Mandriva-Linux-2005-Limited-Edition-
DVD.x86_64.iso

The iso is 4.3 Gb.  obtained this file by downloading it from 
MandrivaClub via BitTorrent. Took nearly four days. When it was 
done BitTorrent said "Done."

As for Russ' suggestion, I used md5sum command on the ISO file 
(man, that took a long time on a 4.3 Gb file!). It finally generated 
the md5sum. I compared this to the file that came with the 
download, and they are identical.

Next idea?

I lived through that horrific transition from SunOS 4 to Solaris. It was a 
real pain when we had Sun servers up and crash when there was nothing wrong 
with the hardware except that it had Solaris on it. :-O

I took a different job after that for a awhile doing HP/UX development and 
didn't do any work on Solaris until version 2.4. By that time Sun had gotten 
Solaris stable and it ran quite well on all of the workstations I had it 
installed on.

Remove the word "file:" from this. I've never drag-n-dropped a file into

That's good to hear. That's why we use md5sum. :)

 :)  But take printer configuration for one example.  This is always a
big hassle for me and for many others, as evinced in the relevant
forums.  With Windows, it's almost always point-and-click.

Drivers in general are a problem, just because manufacturers aren't
usually motivated to produce them for linux, or even to produce
specifications.  This isn't the fault of linux, of course, but it does
make learning the OS that much harder.

On the other hand, if you're focusing on servers rather than
workstations, then you're probably right, Mr. Johnson.  I've
administered linux and Windoze NT servers (though not very well), and I
found the NT servers nothing short of impossible.

As someone else said, you don't have a complete (thus valid) ISO file.

I happen to have the Mandriva 10.2 LE ISO files.  Here are their sizes:

733192192 Mandriva-Linux-2005-Limited-Edition-Download-CD1.i586.iso
731850752 Mandriva-Linux-2005-Limited-Edition-Download-CD2.i586.iso
729962496 Mandriva-Linux-2005-Limited-Edition-Download-CD3.i586.iso

Each ISO file is almost 700 MB.  Your 366 KB file is *way* too small.

The following two files merely contain md5 checksums and signatures:

      512 Mandriva-Linux-2005-Limited-Edition-Download-CD.i586.md5.asc
      536 Mandriva-Linux-2005-Limited-Edition-Download-CD.i586.sha1.asc

You can run "md5sum <iso file>" on each ISO file in order to visually
compare the files' official md5 hashes against the files you acquired.

Do "cat <md5.asc file>" to see the file contents -- the md5 checksums.

If you have a few CD-R blanks, you can use cdrecord to burn these ISOs:

Do "cdrecord scanbus" to get the hardware address of your DVD-R drive;
my SCSI CD-R drive is at address "0,3,0", but yours will be different.

Then do "cdrecord -eject dev=<DVD-R address> <ISO file>" to burn each
ISO file.  Substitute your <DVD-R address> and each <ISO file> name.

Hope that helps...

The three files you see from the BitTorrent download are due
to having used BitTorrent.  As others have said, they are "checksum"
files and should never be burned onto the DVD, just the iso itself.

Since BitTorrent is very good at checking file integrity, I will
bet (a small amount :-) that your .iso is good.  Nontheless,
hand-checking  it with `md5sum' against the checksum in 

  Mandriva-Linux-2005-Limited-Edition-DVD.x86_64.md5.asc

is always a good idea.

I'm a bit surprised that BitTorrent took 4 days. My
DVD took about 20 hours.  I guess there are not so many "torrents"
on the network for the x86_64 version.

The top of my list is:

"The Mythical Man-Month: Anniversary Edition"
Frederick P. Brooks Jr.
Addison-Wesley, Paperback, 2nd edition, Published August 1995
ISBN 0201835959

"Few books on software project management have been as influential and
timeless as The Mythical Man-Month. With a blend of software engineering
facts and thought-provoking opinions, Fred Brooks offers insight for
anyone managing complex projects. These essays draw from his experience
as project manager for the IBM System/360 computer family and then for
OS/360, its massive software system. Now, 20 years after the initial
publication of his book, Brooks has revisited his original ideas and
added new thoughts and advice, both for readers already familiar with
his work and for readers discovering it for the first time.  The added
chapters contain (1) a crisp condensation of all the propositions
asserted in the original book, including Brooks' central argument in The
Mythical Man-Month: that large programming projects suffer management
problems different from small ones due to the division of labor; that
the conceptual integrity of the product is therefore critical; and that
it is difficult but possible to achieve this unity; (2) Brooks' view of
these propositions a generation later; (3) a reprint of his classic 1986
paper "No Silver Bullet"; and (4) today's thoughts on the 1986
assertion, "There will be no silver bullet within ten years."

Not quite. Back with SunOS 4, somewhere around 4.3 or 4.4, Sun marketing
came up with Solaris and chose to rebrand the OS. Something like 4.3.#nnn
or 4.4.#nnn became "Solaris 1.0". The Solaris 1.nnn mapped in a strange
inconsistant way to SunOS 4. With the SysV changeover they called it
"Solaris 2", so there is a pretty sane mapping of Solaris 2.nnn to SunOS
5.nnn versions. Solaris 2.5.1 is the same as SunOS 5.5.1, and Solaris 2.6
is SunOS 5.6. Then they decided to call SunOS 5.7 "Solaris 7", it was
refered to as "Solaris 2.7" in a number of places, but "Solaris 7" was
the official designation; they've continuing this trend up to
"Solaris 10". Java wasn't the first time Sun has played strange games
with version numbers.

I tend to stick to the SunOS designation as that numbering scheme is
consistant. I say SunOS 5.10, and you immediately know what I'm refering
to without having to look it up in a magical book.

I think people would know easier if you just said Soaris 10, like the

I'll second John's vote for Brooks.  But how are you going to separate 
programming from project management?  If you really intend to try, pay 
very close attention to the part about the "surgical team".  Follow 
that by trading all of your cubicles in for a few good doors:

  http://paulgraham.com/gh.html  (Ctrl+f,blender<enter>)

I would also suggest that you read "The Art of Unix Programming" by Eric 
Raymond.  There's a lot of good insight in there about why Unix is the 
way it is, and lots of other good stuff like what unix got right, 
wrong, etc.

  http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/

This will also lead you to a lot of references to other essays and books 
(including Brooks.)

I'll add one caveat, which is not to put too much stock in what he says 
about Python (unless you're considering Java (don't do that.))

Perl is the silver bullet. ;-)  (Add salt to this if you don't believe 
me.)

Is this an example of "Version Inflation"?

Seriously, I've always found it amusing that the different Linux
distributions (and I guess Solaris), although on completely different
development paths, have pretty well tracked each other's version
numbers for the last 6-7 years, at least for Mandrake, RH, SuSE, and
Slackware.  (I have paid no attention to Debian.:-)

This is, I think, more than coincidence.

I can't speak for Slackware, which used to use year numbers for 
versioning (remember Slackware '97?), but for the rest...

Red Hat's versioning dominates. All the way up to Red Hat Linux 9, Red 
Hat had a very consistent, sane policy behind its version numbers. 
Basically, a major version bump meant that a) there was a major new 
kernel version or b) a core component like gcc or glibc went through 
an upgrade that introduced binary incompatibilities.

Mandrake was originally derived from Red Hat, so it's no coincidence 
at all the its versioning has somewhat tracked along...

SuSE entered the American market when Red Hat was at (or nearly at) 
version 4.2, and SuSE arbitrarily set its version number to match Red 
Hat's. I suppose they wanted to suggest a similarity of features and 
software packages -- which wasn't entirely unreasonable, given that 
everyone was building core systems from the same source tarballs -- 
but there's no doubt the marketing folks drove that decision.

I remember a PLUG meeting in 1997 or so attended by Red Hat's Bob 
Young and a marketing guy from the (then-new, now long-gone) SuSE 
America headquarters. The SuSE guy was asked about the extremely 
coicidental version numbering. He tried to explaining by making a 
crack about 4.2 being related to Life, the Universe, and Everything -- 
which caused nothing but groaning and eye-rolling in the peanut 
gallery.

The glaring exception was 7.0, the last RH version to
use a 2.2 kernel. Most thought it should have had a
2.4 kernel when released.

I didn't particularily mean that I think they can be separated, but 
rather that I'm not looking for the camel book or Deitel & Deitel.  I'm 
interested in learning about project management, not everyone's favorite

Though Linux supports an absolutely amazing amount of hardware out of 
the box.  There's a tendency for visitors to my household to plug 
random USB devices into my USB hub while I'm at work just to watch 
xconsole see if it detects the device.  My roommates report that 
people are almost always pleasantly surprised (granted, there's a 
difference between Linux detecting it and actually using it, but 
that's a pretty fine line).

All the stumbling blocks are stumbling blocks for administrators 
alone, not workstation users.  If you ran Linux at work, all that 
would have been done for you already.

Subject: [PLUG] Mandriva Installation Woes
Message-ID: <428CFDC3.23278.F6BA1C@localhost>

Dudes and dudettes, 

Installing Linux sux. 

OK, having figured out a lot of things from installing various distros 
(some several times), and having been taught how to burn a 
bootable ISO (thanks Russ), I installed Mandirva 2005 Limited 
Edition DVD.x86_64 this afternoon. 

After two and a half hours of installing, plus half an hour scrolling 
through the applications and deciding what I wanted, I got to the 
end and hit the Reboot button. 

It restarted and hung on "- No init found. Try passing init = options 
to kernel." 

I have no idea what the init options are, or whether they would be 
worth trying, let alone the syntax for how to enter them or where. 
No help menus available from this screen. I have a couple Linux 
books, but no index entries address this issue. Google also came 
up empy. Well, empty except for a thousand advertising sites. :( 


Mandriva full DVD from MandrivaClub was kind of my last hope for this 
Compaq R4000. I have tried Suse (did not recognize the video), Knoppix 
(dead keyboard and touchpad), Ubunto (ditto Knoppix), Gentoo (ditto 
Knoppix), and Mandriva. Mandriva was the free three-CD set. It found and 
configured everthing except the video and the wireless. I knew I could 
handle the wireless via Linuxant, if necessary. But the video was a sine 
qua non. 


Well, I have gone all the way through the installation and it won't even 
install. Should I call Bill Gates, offer an apology, and hope he'll let me 
install Windows XP that came with this laptop? 


After six hours trying to install, I am seriously frustrated.

Hi John,

Sorry to hear about your difficulties. Here are my thoughts on this...

It can. Especially when you are installing on something specialized like 
a laptop. Most laptops still to this day have hardware not used in more 
traditional PCs. It's getting better, from both ends, but it can still 
be a headache.

Then you've added a brand new, cutting edge machine into the mix. I 
don't see the laptop you have listed on linux on laptops, which tells me 
that getting help for your specific installation may be slightly more 
difficult than usual.

For a first install, I'd go strictly with the default packages. 
Customization can happen later. You'll need to know what kind of video 
your laptop has, what pcmcia chipset, and maybe several other things. 
Most likely each of these will require a reinstall to "get it right". 
Some may only require rebuilding the kernel.

When I installed linux on my HP laptop the first time, it hung on boot 
as well. I at least got it to boot. I had to disable PCMCIA before it 
would boot completely.

Then, I had to recompile the kernel to get ACPI to work. The ACPI 
chipset in mine wouldn't work at all with APM even turned on in the 
kernel. It had to be completely removed.

I'd back up a bit and start with an easy installation. Once things start 
to work and you start to understand a little more about how linux 
interacts with your laptop hardware, you can work on when init options, 
if any, it needs.

I seriously doubt that any distribution works completely, out of the 
box, on this particular laptop. It's quite new, if I'm reading the 
information HP has on it.

Hey Russ-

I must admit I haven't actually used Mandriva (Mandrake) since version
7.2 or so, and at the time I had a very limited understanding of what
Linux was or how it worked, so I don't really know much about its
specific quirks.  However; what could require a reinstall to get it
right?  If the system boots, be it with a rescue CD or to the actual
distribution, you should be able to get things fully operational without
a complete reinstall, right?

No argument there.  On the other hand, you only have to do it once.

Yeah, that situation sucks.  Always have a Knoppix that you know works 
handy in case all else fails and you *NEED* to get online.

I agree, it's kind of a trick question, but thankfully it rarely comes 
up.  One worth trying is <kernel name> init=/bin/sh and if that 
doesn't work, eh, haven't encountered it yet.

Sometimes, it's all in how you ask the question.  Googling and asking 
mailing lists for help is a task unto itself.

Every one of those issues is something that's likely easily fixed.  If
it works one place, it can work everywhere.

Just because the automagic configurator thingimijig didn't configure
something for you doesn't mean it's a lost cause.  I'll bet we can get
your video working in Mandriva or SuSE, your keyboard and touchpad
working in Ubantu, Knoppix, or Gentoo.  I'd personally toss Slackware in
to the mix as well, if for no other reason than it seems to often have
different default kernel options than the other big boys out there.

Now, let's just say you want to stick with Mandriva for the moment, at
least to get your feet wet in Linux.  What doesn't work about the video?
 Are you trying to start video by default at bootup or log in to the
console and start X manually?

What kind of info is appearing either on the console or
/var/log/Xorg.0.log after X fails to start?  Take some of the key terms
down at the bottom of it and google them.  What kind of video chip do
you have in your laptop?  You may find trying a VESA default style
driver might work better, at least to get started, than something
specific for your chipset.

Sorry, I didn't follow you, there.  If you mean about printer
configuration, then the problem applies as well to home computers, and I
just can't concede that it's a cinch.  I do run linux at work, by the
way.  (Have for years, wouldn't go back.)

Another example is X11 configuration.  If that goes worng for a newbie,
it can be a bear to fix.  Perhaps Mr. Jordan will agree.  ;)

Partly. As Geoff pointed out, the switch from SunOS to Solaris was 
partly a shift in the technology, it wasn't all marketing. But I'm sure 
that Sun was very concerned that they were still on numbers like 2.5 and 
2.6 while the Linux distributions were coming out with new major version 
numbers very quickly in comparison. They clearly didn't want to end up 
in a situation where someone was choosing between something like SunOS 
3.1 and RedHat 6.0.

The goofy part is that the other style of numbers do still show up on 
the system. When you boot up Solaris 10 is says "SunOS Release 5.10." 
That's not a very hard mapping to remember, though.

Well, Mandrake and SuSE were pretty RedHat-based at first, weren't they? 
I think they've evolved in pretty different directions, but it's not 
suprising to me that their versioning has stayed pretty consistent with 
RedHat's. I'm sure marketing plays a big part of it too.

I installed using the 64-bit DVD ISO that I downloaded from 
MandrivaClub and (with help from Russ here) burned to a DVD. I 
copied all the Windows XP files to my external hard disk that I use 
for backup, and also burned them to a couple DVDs just in case. 
Then I created a 60 Gb main partition and a 1.6 Gb swap partition 
and formatted them with Ext3, all of which was done during 
installation. I told it to use Grub at the master boot record. The 
install procedure also added a lot of packages - OpenOffice.org, 
etc., which I selected from a long list. 

When it finished I rebooted and it ran about two pages of code and 
hung. Looking at the screen again there is more that might be 
helpful in diagnosing what went wrong - 

mounting root filesystem with flags noatime mount: error 6 
mounting ext3 flags noatime well, retrying read-only without any 
flags mount: error 6 mounting ext3 pivotroot: pivot_root (sysroot, 
/sysroot / initrd) failed: 2 Initrd finished Freeing unused Kernel 
memory: 220 K freed Kernel panic - not syncing: No init found. Try 
passing     init= option to Kernel 

At that point the keyboard and mouse are dead, so there is nothing 
I can do. I turned off the power and restarted several times, but it 
always hangs right at the same line. 

That was last night. This morning, with my personal batteries 
recharged, I am reinstalling. And this time I did not specify Grub for 
the bootloader, so I assume it will use Lilo. I also did not select as 
many packages to install. If this doesn't work, then I will reinstall 
again, selecting no packages at all. There are also system options 
that are checked by default and I can uncheck them -- like "is this 
a network computer?," Is this an office computer?" and so on. 
There are sub-check boxes for each. If you check that it is an office 
computer then it installs various packages by default. If you check 
that it will be on a LAN, then I assume it installs things necessary 
to get the ethernet working and find other computers. 

I will keep trying to get it installed. And even if I manage to get it 
perfectly installed (not holding my breath), I will bring it to the Clinic 
tormorrow. If that doesn't get it running right, then it's time to send 
it back to HP. 

Thanks to all for your suggestions and help!

Yet another call to change the subject line when the discussion moves on
to different issues.  I'd been deleting all the ones in this thread until
I got curious about why some of the posters would keep up a discussion
on the original subject.  They hadn't.

OK, the reinstall resulted in the same exact problem. Still hangs on

"Kernel panic - not syncing: No init found. Try passing init= option 
to kernel"

At this point I wonder if it would do any good to keep reinstalling. It 
sounds like there is something fundamentally wrong - something 
that is going wrong way before it gets into loading the kernel.

In reading what is on the screen after it hangs, I am encouraged to 
see that it recognized a lot of stuff, e.g.:

Touchpad has extended capability bits
 -> multifinger detection
 -> palm detection
input: SynPS/2 Synaptics touchpad on isa0060/serio4

ACPI wakeup devices:
 LID KCBO MSE0 PB4 PZP ELAN
ACPI: (supports S0 S3 S4 S5)

So I am still hoping!

Subject: [PLUG] filenames with spaces, shell programming ...
Message-ID: <86mzqpdf3w.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


I have got a file containing file names with spaces and exclamation
marks, etc.  I want to, e.g., cmp -v two versions of these files,
something like:

  $ cmp -v $DIR1/$foo $DIR2/$foo

When I stupidly do something like:

  $ for foo in $(cat fnames) ; do echo $foo ; cmp -v $DIR1/$foo $DIR2/$foo ; done

the filenames get split at spaces in the filenames.  How do I keep
them from being split?

When this issue has come up in the past, Randal usually pipes up with
a solution that subtley implies that "you don't understand how this
works".  I guess I need to improve my understanding at this stage.

Any lucid explanation welcome.

I typically combine find -print0 with xargs -0, though it might be tough 
to duplicate your loop exactly. In a directory containing files or 
directories with spaces in their names, compare these three commands:

1. find * -prune | xargs stat
2. for f in *; do stat $f; done
3. find * -prune -print0 | xargs -0 stat

The first two do roughly the same thing: tokenize filenames on 
whitespace so that you end up with bad results or errors.

The last one does the right thing: find null-terminates the results and 
xargs splits on the null terminator, not whitespace.

Double-quotes around shell variables?

cmp -v "$DIR1/$foo" "$DIR2/$foo"

I'm not sure about the exclamation points though; lemme know if the
quotes handle those too.

The problem actually occurs earlier, in the for loop. The shell will 
assign $foo based on whitespace splits in the string returned by $(cat 
fnames). The quoting you suggest may help if $foo contains shell 
metacharacters, but it won't solve the whitespace issue.

Try

   $ for foo in $(cat fnames) ; do echo $foo ; cmp -v "$DIR1/$foo" "$DIR2/$foo" ; done

The variables will expand inside the double-quotes, but the shell
will still pass them as singe strings to cmp(1).  Now, as for the
exclamation points .... those might be an uglier problem.

Yes, you are correct. You should be able to get a systems functional 
without a complete reinstall.

However, I've found that I can do a complete install on a machine in an 
hour or less, giving me a known state.

Figuring out what options are needed can require hours of work. 
Sometimes it's just easier to nuke and repave.

IIRC, the kernel won't allow suid scripts to be run as suid.

First thought is users environment. Do you specify the path to 
executables in your script?

Without more information, it will be hard to come up with specifics.

What do you expect, and what exactly is happening?

I'm sure someone will come up with a more elegant solution but in this example 
I replace the spaces with a "#" character and then as each filename is 
processed, the "#" is translated back to a space character...Pretty lame I 
know...

#!/bin/sh
#
names=`sed -e 's/ /#/g' fnames`
for foo in $names; do
  fname=`echo "$foo" | tr "#" " "`
  echo "$fname";
done

Months ago, ever since it moved from Drizzle to my server.  It works
really well; I get only about 20 or so per day in the junk trap and
probably half of those are viruses.

If it's sufficiently messed up that it cannot find init, it's probably
best to just re-installed.

SUID on scripts has never been supported on Linux and most, if not all,
modern UNIX systems do not support it because it's a security risk.  If
Perl, look into suidperl, which is built to work around this.
Otherwise, use sudo.

Do hosts lose their status after a set amount of time, then?  I sent a
message to the list last night but noticed it didn't appear after five
minutes or so.. logged in to my mail relay and saw the greylisting message.

It took longer than 300 seconds to retry again, but that's a local issue
unrelated to greylisting... but I thought it odd I made it on the
greylist if greylisting has been implemented for so long.

Problem is, I am more or less stuck with the file of filenames as a

Been there done that whole a whole pile of tee-shirts.  So many times that
I gotten really lazy and just edit the file and do a search/replace on all
the "troublesome" characters.  Change them into their escaped sequence. 
A space to '\ ' , bang to '\!' , etc.

Hey what about cat'ing to a sed script script that does this editing.  I'm 
not much of a sed user so would probably write a perl script to do this.

Actually I just tied this:

   for v in "$(cat file )" ; do echo -e "$v\n" ; done

which gives me lines not words.  But you will still run into the issue of 
mv and un-escaped whitespace and/or special characters.

One of the other options above before will be needed.  I'd say the perl 
script to generate the whole "correct" command lines.  ( Did that make any 
sense at all? )

Depending on the program ( and its settings ) used to implement
"greylisting"  the database entries may be flushed at some age or lack of
activity interval.

That's too late, I think.  The for loop already has $foo as
space-split tokens.  Wrapping them in quotes will just quote the
mis-split tokens.  E.g.:

  $ touch "a b c" "d e f"
  $ ls -1 * > fnames
  $ for i in $(cat fnames) ; do echo $i ; done
  a
  b 
  c 
  d 
  e
  f

I think it's actually easier at that point, assuming you're using bash 
and can take advantage of its funky, somewhat mystical ability to read 
whole lines when using shell redirection to pipe a file into a while loop:

while read f
do
   echo "$f"
   cmp -v "/foo/$f" "/bar/$f"
done < fnames

Yes, they expire every two weeks.  Last night I moved the Postgrey
policy server to another host and upgraded Postgrey from 1.13 to 1.21,
which seems to have changed the database layout, so stuff was suddenly
getting greylisted that should have been in cache.  I also had a little
SNAFU in that I initially forgot to open the firewall on the policy
server to allow connections to the policy server.

My ultimate goal is to have list messages delivered directly to the list
server, instead of passing first through my main mail server.  To that
end, I've moved the Amavis scanning and Postgrey policy server to a
dedicated host; now I just need to ensure I've got forwarding for any
non-list addresses set up correctly and update the MXs.

I had a similar symptom the first time I tried to install this release
(although I have a 32-bit system, not 64-bit).  I sent the boot loader
to the root partition and it somehow overwrote something important and
caused a kernal panic.  When I put LILO on the MBR, it booted up okay.

> At this point I wonder if it would do any good to keep reinstalling.

You should be able to get it installed successfully.  Try another way.
I'd suggest using separate partitions, i.e., extended logical partitions
something like this:

hda  5  /boot       32 MB
     6  /          256 MB
     7  /home     1024 MB
     8  /var       512 MB
     9  swap      1024 MB
    10  /usr      3072 MB
    11  /usr/local 512 MB
    12  /data   ~53600 MB   

Using extended logical partitions leaves some space for the boot loader
to overrun.  At least, that's what I thought when doing this worked out.
You can toggle to Expert Mode in the HardDrake partitioning utility and
set the partition type to Extended.  Just be sure to do it on all disks.

That's encouraging.  If you can just get it to boot, it might work fine.

> So I am still hoping!

Good.  Try varying how you do the install, especially the partitioning,
and make sure to put LILO on the MBR rather than on the root partition.

Best of luck...

Ah!  Much better.  That one wasn't on my utility belt.

Oh, and BTW, the option to cmp should be -l rather than -v.  I
apologize for propagating that misinformation.  The -v option just
gives you version information, which while interesting and
informative, wasn't what I really wanted. ;-)

Message-ID: <86y8a9bqzi.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


Following up on the shell question I had earlier today, I have a set
of 184 files (from Samba server rsync snapshots).  They are .doc,
.xls, .ppt, and .gz files with identical filesize and timestamps.  I
detected that the files differ earlier, and the shell hackery allowed
me to identify the differing bytes.  Since most of those are
proprietary binary formats, it isn't obvious how to figure out which
version is correct.  I thought I was on to something when I tried gzip
-t on each version of the .gz files, but both versions test OK.  Gak!
Any other ideas?

Russell,

   On the command line, puting the filename in double quotes treats it as a
single string. Does this not work in a shell script?

Initially it was actually version deflation. But the "Solaris" moniker is
*pure* marketing. The shift in technology was from SunOS 4 to SunOS 5,
which correspond with Solaris 1 and Solaris 2. So it was officially
Solaris well before the shift. Initially this had the effect of deflating
the version numbers, but the major version number still represented major
change. Now the Solaris versions are pure marketing fluff.

Not entirely goofy. The SunOS version numbers are assigned by Sun
Engineering, who are interested in meaningful version numbers; rather
than by Sun Marketing who just want larger version numbers. `uname -r`
will give you the SunOS version, which is a heck of a lot more useful for
scripting than the Solaris numbers.

Yes, but the most recent analysis I've seen stated that it was a *lot*
better than Windows installation. The reason you notice is because you're
installing Linux, but most likely have never done a bare installation of
Windows (a recovery CD/DVD doesn't count).

You've dropped a bunch of newlines which would of been nice to keep, but
oh well. The suggestion of passing "init=" to the kernel would be useless
in this case, since it appears to be failing to mount the root
filesystem; it doesn't say that since it has loaded an initrd and so
tries to boot off that (which is unfortunately useless).

At a guess either the initrd has a bad view of the universe and is trying
to mount the wrong device as the root filesystem, or perhaps the initrd
is missing or failing to load a driver needed to access the root device.
Alas that is all I can say, as I generally avoid using initrd nor do I
have experience with Mandrake.

Anyone played with Mandrake's initrd stuff?

Actually, I have. Many, many times. I have never bought a 
computer with Windows preinstalled. In fact, the last time I bought 
a computer that I did not build myself was so long ago it was a 
386/25, state of the art for its day.

In the early days (like 3.0 and even 3.1) there were lots of driver 
problems. Unstable is an understatement. To get away from the 
shell crashing all the time I built my first NT computer in October, 
1993, two months after NT 3.1 was released. And there were driver 
problems with that too, for several years. 

Even if there were drivers for NT they frequently didn't work well. 
The problem was that NT required different drivers than regular 
Windows and manufacturers did not want to spend the money on 
producing a driver for an OS until after it had a decent market 
share. (Gosh, that sounds kind of familiar, doesn't it?) As a result, 
for the first release of NT the drivers were almosst all written by 
Microsoft. And Microsoft didn't care if they had all the functionality 
the device was capable of. All they wanted was to be able to say 
"why of course NT comes with a driver for your Mark IV BugBomb 
card."

Today those issues are all pretty much behind us for Windows. But 
now I'm trying to go to Linux, and having to go through it all over 
again. But I'm cool with it. With this laptop my trump card is that I 
still have ten days left on my "no hassle" return privilege with HP. 
I'm just frustrated. I *really, really like* this computer. I so want to 
get Linux working on it properly.

As for Mandriva, I did have Mandriva installed on it and it worked 
fine (except the video was wrong and the wireless and firewire didn't 
work). But the version that I had installed was the 586 version, and 
now I'm trying to install .x86_64.

Also, I think the firewire didn't work because Mandriva thought it 
was eth0. The LAN was eth1. And I had to do a lot of fiddling with 
the LAN to get it up so I could get on the internet. Unfortunately, 
every time the window came up eth0 was in the drop down menu 
by default. So most of the time when I made a change I ended up 
trying to do it to the firewire port. Only after seeing the hourglass 
followed by an error message did I realize that, once again, I had 
forgotten to select eth1 before applying the change. So I'm pretty 
sure the firewire didn't work becauses I goobered it up.

(Note to Gnome coders: Make that drop down box "sticky" so once 
the user selects a device it will keep coming up with that device by 
default. Or make the box blink and make loud squealing noises 
until the user selects a device. Or something. It's a user interface 
problem the way it is now.)

As for the wireless, I am sure that can be made to work. Push 
come to shove, I can go to Linuxant and pay a few bux for their fix. 
I never got to the point of trying the faxmodem but, again, Linuxant 
will probably save me if the distro doesn't get it going automatically.

It's the video that may be the deal killer here. But I am still hoping 
that the full 64-bit version of Mandriva 2005 LE will do it. 

I just went out running some errands and had some time to 
cogitate on this some more. I think for my next exercise I am going 
to try a reinstall, but select Ext2 instead of Ext3. Or maybe Reiser. 
And, as Robert suggested, maybe I'll change the partition sizes.

NOT GIVING UP YET!

Subject: [PLUG] Trying to create bootable cd...
Message-ID: <1116557909.428d5255c5c28@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I'm installing Linux above the standard cylinder 
limit and I don't want it to be obvious that it is 
available on the machine I'm setting up for security 
reasons.  So far I've tried creating a Windows 98 
system disk cd with loadlin off another cd and a 98 
system disk as the data sources, only the files on 
the floppy burned to the cd.  Groan.  I'd rather use 
freedos if I had it.

The kernel and initrd image that Fedora core 3 
installed will not fit on a floppy with loadlin 
and the 98 system files.

In the interest of using a free version of dos and 
being able to upgrade the XP installation to NTFS 
possibly, anyone know an easy way around this?  
I want to burn a bootable cd that is at least a 
2.88 meg image.  

I could go the xosl route, but I don't want to.  
XOSL, at least the versions I've used, don't 
understand NTFS.  I want my friend to be able 
to boot linux without completely exposing her XP 
system.  Has anyone installed xosl on a Windows 
XP box?  The easiest I can think of is FIPSing 
the windows partition and changing the part that 
Windows is on to NTFS so that the dos boot that 
loadlin requires will not grant access to the 
Windows part of the drive.  I wish there was a 
way to trick XP into thinking that the rest of 
the hard drive doesn't exist.  I'm halfway 
worried that NTFS will self destruct with an 
advanced partitioning scheme.

The Linux system is going to host a backup of the 
Windows XP Home system, if tar is a functional way 
to back that system up.  I used dd to get the XP 
bootblock off the disk.  I'm admittedly concerned 
if tar doesn't put XP's files back in exactly the 
same spots on the hard disk that a restoration
will fail.  I'm thinking image file, though I 
admittedly wonder how large it will have to be.  
Is there a way to use dd to get an absolute copy 
of the fat partition to restore it from later?  
What do I set the block size and the count to?  
The Windows swap file and probably the system 
restore points as well will need to be copied 
to the exact same locations they were at when 
they were backed up if I'm not mistaken or 
Windows XP might self destruct when I try to 
restore it.

Should I turn system restore points off in XP
before I back it up?

Subject: [PLUG] XP installation self destruct has me wary...
Message-ID: <1116491906.428c5082be6f8@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

Microsoft complained when I tried to activate it 
that it had been activated before.  I replaced 
the hard drive thinking I can't remove a 
keylogger from it.  When I copied a linux kernel 
onto one of XP's FAT partitions from Linux, that 
somehow wrecked the XP system.  The start bar 
self destructed entirely.  I've been able to 
run explorer from task manager, so I'm not buying
the idea that explorer.exe got corrupted.

Is it possible that Microsoft is so paranoid that
it's booby trapping XP home now?  Does Microsoft 
record a hardware fingerprint when you install 
Windows XP the first time so that it will self 
destruct if you try to install it on different 
hardware?  I installed on the same box, but I 
changed the hard disk.  

Is there any way to trick Windows XP into 
thinking it has been activated?

My only thought is that DEP protection had 
something to do with it.  Maybe a combination 
of disabling Internet Explorer and installing 
files to a FAT partition from a different OS 
triggered an auto destruct.

Maybe I should create the fat partition after
I get Windows XP fully installed.

All I can say is that I'm awfully frustrated
with the stupid thing.  I wish I could talk
my friend into 2000, Fedora Core 3, and 
vmware.  2000 doesn't need to be activated
online for one thing.  Microsoft should be
sued for creating XP.  Too bad she can't
afford Windows 2000.

Subject: [PLUG] Looking for a keylogger infection...
Message-ID: <1116358762.428a486aece5d@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I'm trying to clean up a friend's XP system.  I found a file 
called twacker in the root directory that's looks like a log
from a keylogger.  Now this is silly of course, why would a
trojan ever leave a record of what it did?  I'm planning on
using an isolated Linux system to store a copy of what's on
the system if there's something that needs to be recovered 
later and then I want to zero format the drive.

Is there a program I should burn to a cd and install to my
friend's computer that will find any keylogger that might 
be there?  Does anyone know a specific file name to search
for or something that will be in the registry that will
indicate a keylogger is installed?

My plan after zero format, I'm thinking I can do that using
Linux and dd, is to install Windows XP first to the first
half of her hard drive and then put Fedora Core 3 on the 
other half.  My idea is to back up the Windows system using
the Fedora Core 3 system.  I want her to able to restore
Windows to a known clean state.  I'm planning on keeping a 
second copy of the backup myself.  Is it possible to read 
the NTFS filesystem so I can use tar etc. under Fedora Core 
3, to back the Windows system up?  My goal is to write a 
script so that teaching her a little about Linux, she can 
restore the Windows system by simply logging in to the Linux
side and running the script.  Do I need to be 
thinking image file instead of tarball so I don't have
to worry about the specifics of NTFS?  I want the 
restore procedure to reset every single bit on the
windows partition and the boot sector of the hard
drive as well, I figure that this will almost 
certainly clean off any malware.  I should probably
make a bootable cd with grub in case the boot sector
does get comprimised.

OT: Is there a program that will lock the windows registry?

Richard Steffens,

Do you simply use imap or do you use a local smtp server on your
box to send email?

Is a packet filter blocking outbound connections to port 143 on
comcast's server or the packets coming back?

Is host resolution properly configured on your machine?

Maybe comcast has used a strange feature of the Winders client
where something you are not aware of has to happen for port
143 or 25 on their server to open.  

To see what servers your running if your doing your own smtp server,
the netstat command is useful.  I use netstat -nlptu frequently.  If 
you can do tcpdump on the winders box to see what the traffic looks 
like from your imap client that can send email, maybe you'll see 
what's special.

I would complain to Comcast if asking for more information from 
them doesn't help.  Over time, it seems that Comcast has 
consistently been problematic for people.  One way to improve 
things is to vote with your money for broadband providers that 
are Linux friendly.  Boycott Comcast if it's too hard to use it.
If I had the money I could have Comcast as well as DSL, but
now especially I know I don't want it.  Satellite service
might even be better ( except for Starband ).

     I hope you can get it to work,

Are you trying to burn the image as an image? Or are you trying to burn the 
files themselves?

Put another way:

Have you tried (In  k3b,) Tools -> CD (or DVD) -> Burn CD (or DVD) image?
at that point you will be able to select a single image file and then it 
should be fairly intuitive..

Sorry, for the short, clipped answer, haven't had my morning tea..

Hope that helps

Hi I was at the last user group meeting and am still looking for 3 more
people programming in C++ for Linux.  I need people who have worked in a
professional environment for at least 6 months.  The C++ has to have
been in the recent (last 2 years) past and you can not be currently
working for Intel. I  Need people to go out to Intel and give them
feedback on a new compiler.  It would take 2 hours or less and pay $100.

I would also like to compile a database of Linux users in the Portland
area that would be interested in being called to do paid research.  If
you would be interested in being in my database please feel free to
email me.  This database would not be used for anything but paid
projects no sales no free surveys etc.

Subject: [PLUG] DNS Problem: Host Name Not Resolving
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0505201518250.14758@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I'm trying to access -- via http --
download/emperorlinux.com/support/kernel/2.4/ so I can upgrade the kernel on
my notebook. But, I cannot reach that URL from here.

   I can reach www.emperorlinux.com, but as soon as I add "/support/" to the
URL I'm taken to their support policies page, not the kernel download page.
Same problem trying ftp instead of http.

   Their tech support writes that they have no problems accessing the site, so
it must have something to do with the DNS servers I have listed in
/etc/resolve: 208.187.192.2 and 208.187.226.2.

   How can I specify using a different dns server to test the problem?

Thanks,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] WANTED: Participants for C++ compiler Usability Study
Message-ID: <s28cd36e.017@mail.usfieldresearch.com>

** High Priority **


A high level and very well known development company is looking for a few candidates to help evaluate a new C++ compiler. This company is in the process of evaluating a new version and wants "real world" people to provide feedback and make design recommendations. The product evaluation is informal. It will involve experienced software developers who currently hold, or have held, a position where software development is/was a significant portion of their responsibility. In addition, candidates also need
to meet the following criteria:

 - programmed in C++ for at least a year, 
 - written code in a professional environment for longer than six months, 
 - developed C++ code within the last month,
 - worked with Linux or Unix,
 - not purchased a C++ compiler in the last year,
 - perform a number of C++ tasks [hence the questions about experience.] 

Evaluation sessions are held in Hillsboro and will run approximately two hours. Each participant will receive $100 honorarium as compensation for their time. Session times available are:  

 - Monday, May 23rd, morning [8am].
 - Tuesday, May 24th, afternoon [3pm].
 - Wednesday, May 25th, morning [8am], noon [12pm], and afternoon [3pm].

If you meet the preliminary qualifications and are available to participate, please contact me ASAP. Leave a voicemail at tollfree 877.638.3282 x212. Indicate the message is for Susan and is about the Compiler Study. Make sure you include your name, phone number, and a time I can contact you to complete a few minutes of preliminary screening questions.

Thanks,

It's well known that you must call MS to reactivate the retail version 
of XP (Home and Pro) if you replace certain pieces of hardware. This 
includes the hard drive, the motherboard, and possibly the video card.

I've heard it's a painless process. Call MS and reactivate. Unless, of 
course, you don't have a legal copy of Windows.

Russ hit on the solution yesterday. I was dragging and dropping 
the ISO into the filename box at the top of the window, but the ISO 
information was not appearing in the window below. Everyone told 
me that it should appear as long as the complete path was listed in 
the filename box. Finally I posted what was in the box, which was 
preceded by "file:". Russ said to delete the "file:", and as soon as I 
did the ISO info appeared. Stupid, eh?

I'm not sure if the problem is in Gnome, Nautilus or K3b, but one of 
them needs to be fixed.

I'm sorry. I've never had much luck finding alternate locations - 
especially on short notice. Once, > 7 years ago, I talked a cyber cafe

Dan,

   I don't know whether this is a practical suggesion, but "Urban Grind" on NE
Oregon and 22nd Ave. is quite spacious. If there are only a half-dozen or so
folks, and everyone's buying coffee, it may be reasonable to use that as
rental on a table or three for an hour or so.

Sorry about the chatter, i.e. the last empty message.  I'm still getting used to the keyboard on my new/ancient laptop. :-)  Like, oops. Scrolling on down I also see someone hipped John to his problem with K3B.  You can't drag and drop, you must use the browse dialog.

How about Freegeek?  They close up about 7pm on Saturdays, but I'm sure they would be amenable to helping out a good cause and they have tons of room in the lab and classroom.  I think folks are usually around later, but I'm not sure since most of my build instructor shifts are in the a.m.  You might give them a call at 503-232-9350.

I'll go anywhere. I'll even buy the beer. :)

As an alternative suggestion, could we just move the date to 
Monday evening? Or will our errant member be back by then?

Probably better bandwidth at FreeGeek though, not to mention random
borrow-able parts.  I think we'd require a host and/or invitation at
FreeGeek.

I think I saw that you got this solved, but I vaguely remember being 
able to use the bash environment variable $IFS (Internal Field 
Separator) to set what bash uses to split words.  bash's man page states 
that it's default value is "<space><tab><newline>".  Sorry, but I don't 
have anything better to go on than that.

Yeah, I found that too, but didn't figure out how to make effective
use of it before Paul brained me with the "while read" stick.

I would first start with a good virus scanner with up to date defs like
clamwin.  Then scan the system with three different ad-ware/spyware 
scanner programs. my recommends Microsoft antispyware,
spysweeper and TDS-3.

The problem with all of this is that there could still be custom spam bots
and keyloggers that are under the radar of the people that write all of these
programs.

Best and safest. Get the data off the box. wipe the disk re-install and then
behind a good firewall (or have Linux download and burn a CD) download all
the XP patches.  Microsoft's site is the first and only site you hit
until everything
is patched.

Did you heard the news report about attaching a fresh XP install with all the
security patches and then let some teenagers serf the web for an hour. 
Results:  over 300 identified pieces of ad-ware/spyware on the machine.
So much for all the security.

Have you tried building a boot (rescue) floppy from a

XP and NTFS won't self-destruct with this type of
configuration.  I once had 4 different OSes loaded
on to the same hard drive for development  at the 
time the Linux version was the only one that I had
to play with to get it to work when booting.

The best tool that I have found for imaging,
backups, NTFS partition resizing and moving from
one disk to another is BootItNG.  I had one machine
that nothing we tried worked, it would either die while
trying to image the drive or the imaged drive would
not boot.  BootItNG worked the first time.  Haven't looked
around since.

Subject: [PLUG] Spam confession
Message-ID: <20050521055153.GP30750@bavariati.org>

Bless me Tux for I have sinned.

I left my SMTP relay open for nearly a day.  And a spammer used it!

The relay is now closed, and has passed the MAPS scan.  I understand
what I have done and how it came to happen, and I shall nevermore use
SSH to forward port 25 without the proper precautions.
          _______________________________________

Postfix is very good about not being an open relay, and I'd carefully
set things up with SASLauthd so that users had to authenticate to the
server before they could relay mail through it.  The only way someone
can relay mail through the box without authentication is if they're on
the box's internal (127.0.0.1) network.  This allows daemons to send
alert mails and suchlike.

I was moving the mail server from one IP address (and site) to
another.  I wanted to change the address in DNS beforehand so there'd
be time for the change to propagate without a service interruption.

I set up a system at the new address, then had it forward incoming
port 25 traffic to the old address via an SSH portforward.  All worked
nicely.  But I forgot something: SSH forwards to the internal
(127.0.0.1) network.  Yes, the one that Postfix accepts mail from
without authentication.  So by forwarding port 25 to the internal
network on the mail server, the box at the new address looked like a
perfectly ordinary open relay!

And one of the many, many spammers who troll for open relays found it.

So beware of the unintended consequences of portforwards.

Er, actually, no .doc files: .xls (162) and .ppt (12) primarily (also

Which is a shame, since with a .doc I'd stand some chance of looking

Okay, here's something slightly curious: gzip files same size, same

Ah.  First real clue.  This is a Debian/testing box.  One of the .gz
files with differences is a manfile /usr/share/man/man1/mattrib.1.gz.
I compared md5sums with another Debian/testing box and the live
version agrees and my snapshot disagrees.  Checking three other
available system .gz files I find the same thing.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0505210808570.26957@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I need a clue. When I try to view maps from Metro, Google, StreamNet, and
other sites they do not display. The bounding box is outlined, I can see
annotations, legends, and other marginalia, but not the maps themselves.
Both java and javascript are turned on. This happens with firefox-1.0.3 and

   Has anyone either an explanation or suggestions on how I can determine why
these do not display in the browser? I'll go try opera now and see if that
works.

I display maps from Yahoo quite a bit without any issues using Firefox 1.0.4 
under Linux. I can also view that interactive map on Google without any 
issues as well.

I also looked at the .bmp file and the backup looked wrong there as
well.  So I found the affected inodes:

  while read f ; do ls -i "$f" ; done < ~/bogus-fnames | sort > ~/bogus-inodes

and the file names that point at those inodes:

  find . -printf "%i %P\n" | sort > ~/inode-map

and built a shell script to repoint the filenames at the "good" inodes
of a fresh "rsync -c" backup:

  join ~/bogus-inodes ~/inode-map | awk 'BEGIN { print "#!/bin/bash" } { print "ln -vf \"" $2 "\" \"" $3 "\"" }' > patchup-snapshots.sh

... or words to that effect.  I also kept a copy of the "corrupt"
versions in case we later discover in some instances they are actually
good.

So, there will be a Clinic today - normal time and place.

Oy veh. Sorry for all the confusion. BTW, I will talk with Richard to see

Rich,

Try opening firefox from an xterm.  Maybe the error messages printed in
the xterm will give you a clue.

I am able to view maps with firefox 1.0.4 in FC3.  Took a while to get
java right, but ever since then I am golden.

The old SMTP server could of relayed good mail to the new server. Failing
that, the standard is quite a few attempts over 5 *days* before bouncing
mail. Your DNS setup would take more than 5 days to propagate?

Ouch. Cute relay though, with mail going in one IP address, and coming
out another.

I definitely will. After the Clinic I was kind of discouraged and 
planning on returning it to HP, maybe as early as Monday. But just 
now, while browsing for 64-bit distros other than Mandriva and 
Suse, I stumbled across --

https://support.ati.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=894

(If that goes back to an earlier page, click ahead to Motherboards -

This may be the missing driver! I downloaded it, but have no idea 
what to do with it. At this point the only 64-bit version I can get to 
install is Suse Professional 9.3. If I reinstall Suse, where do I put 
this driver?

Looks like there's some work in debian (unofficial as of yet) and 
ubuntu.  Thought Red er... (that thing you wear on your head) had an 
AMD64 version.

Sounds like you're blazing new ground here.  Out-of-the-box isn't always 
going to work (else you would have bought it pre-installed right?), so 
you might as well learn to do things the hard way.  Besides, installing 
debian has gotten oh-so-much-easier since '99 (and even then they said 
a chicken could do it.)

For the edification of onlookers, the main problem we ran into was
booting into the Mandriva 10.2 64bit install.  What appeared to be
happening is that the ext3 root filesystem failed to mount during the
initrd phase, and so the subsequent pivot_root and execution of init
(located, of course, on the root filesystem) failed.  The ext3.ko
module seemed to load.

I have no experience with Mandr-ake/-iva, or 64bit platforms, or
really much with initrd's.  From mailing list traffic, people seem to
be running this distribution elsewhere, so not sure what our specific
problem was.  I think our initrd.img was probably bad for some reason,
and my advice was to post to the Mandriva mailing lists to inquire
about the problem.  Or maybe udev wasn't creating the /dev/hdaN
devices quickly enough for them to appear in time to mount.

One possible thing to try would be to try installing to an ext2
filesystem instead of ext3.  It might not solve your problem, but it
might help illuminate what the real problem is.  If we had a
cross-building environment for a 64-bit target, we might be able to
just compile up a kernel version that didn't need an initrd and punt
around that problem.

Any other ideas, people?

I thought of Debian, but (out-of-the-box anyway), but his keyboard and
touchpad are dead in Debian-derived Ubuntu and Knoppix live cds.  His
USB wireless mouse worked and we plugged in a borrowed USB keyboard
and it "worked" if you count randomly repeated keystrokes as "working"
(hey, maybe it was a labor-saving idea!).  Probably all sortable
though.  I only had three hours to work with, so I didn't go there.

Hi:

I am looking for a recommendation on a RAID controller card
that works well under Linux?

I found this company:

   http://www.highpoint-tech.com/

And they do seem to have pretty extensive Linux support.
Does anyone has opinions on their products?  What make/model
is good for building a Linux RAID  box?

I don't know. The only one I can get to install is Suse 9.3. But you 
could poll the folx on the R3000 e-list. From reading the list I would 
guess Fedora Core 3 would come in first, followed by Mandriva 
2005 LE, and Suse 9.3 in third place. Most distros don't have a 64-
bit version yet.

You could try ext2, I would be surprised if it made a difference but who 
knows.

The real question for me is whether there is support for all of the 
hardware needed to boot in the initrd, especially things like the disk 
controller and filesystems. There's not too much to know about initrd, 
you just need to make sure that all of the necessary hardware support is 
either in the kernel itself or available as a module in the initrd.

If Mandriva has a hardware compatability list, that would be a good 
place to start. Posting to their list is a good idea too. People come 
here with a lot of problems that I would usually take to the 
distro-specific list. Sometimes what seems like an odd error to us here 
is a known issue to the people on the distro's support list :)

I've had an E-machines (which is now Gateway) Athlon 64 laptop for

I've had an HPT302 (not a raid controller) in my workstation for a 
couple of years now.  It slows down the boot process (while the card 
posts the drives it found) but I've never seen an ATA controller that 
didn't do that.

I've also got one of their SATA controllers (still not raid) in my 
fileserver.  No problems with either of them since day 1 (bye bye 
Promise) except that the install instructions were a little lacking 
(but that was a boot-drive changeover from the onboard controller with 
an installed RH7.3 that didn't have scsi support in the initrd.)

I'd go with a 3ware.  The colo server I'm sharing with some friends, set
up in Atlanta, has a 3ware SATA card with a pair of 80GB Seagate drives.
 The setup, thus far, has been quite reliable and performed well... I'm
very happy with it.  :-)

Most of the RHEL clones (CentOS, White Box, Tao, Lineox) have AMD64
versions now. Gentoo also has AMD64. What do you plan to do with the box
when you get Linux on it?

If you want to test out OpenMosix, check out Quantian and
ClusterKnoppix, on which Quantian is built. They're live CDs, so all you
need is a couple of boxes and the CDs.

I was going to post about the Mandriva initrd problem on Mandriva's 
web forums and other places. But before doing that I started surfing 
around to see who else had 64-bit distros. In the process I 
stumbled on a link to ATI Linux drivers. And guess what they 
posted on May 17? 

https://support.ati.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=894

This sure as heck looks like the driver I need!

So this morning I decided to forget about Mandriva for the moment. 
I knew I could get Suse 64-bit installed, so I just finished installing 
it. It doesn't detect the wireless, but I'm pretty sure that can be 
handled, with Linuxant if necessary. It also automatically finds my 
ethernet and the cable modem. I get awfully tired of that green 
lizard, but maybe later I can figure out how to install a more 
pleasing desktop.

So right now it is on the above site. I'm going to download the driver 
and see if I can figure out how to get YaST to install it.

I recommend reading Jeff Garzik's comments about RAID controllers.  I think
most Highpoint cards would fall into the category of 'fakeraid'.

  http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Hardware/sata.html#fakeraid

Even though this appears on a SATA page, I think his comments apply to
parallel cards as well.

Don't discount the MD support in Linux itself.  It's strong

What are you trying to accomplish in RAID ?

If it is performance with RAID5 be careful.

If your write sizes are large, Cache size
is going to be very important.

Just as important is the speed at which the
parity can be processed, especially if
the cache size is small, and things slow
down waiting for parity blocks to be created.

Seen too many RAID systems where their
performance sucks.

Just out of curiosity, why are you so intent on using a 64-bit distro? 
I had FC3 64-bit version installed my laptop for about a week, but 
frustration over various 3rd-party things (like Flash and Java for 
instance) caused me to switch back to the 32-bit version.  Unless you 
have more than 4GB of memory or are doing some truely intense things 
that take advantage of the larger instruction size, I don't think you'll 
even notice the difference between the two, and 32-bit is still better 
supported.

That sounds like a good argument _for_ 64-bit! ;-)

Do the 3Ware cards allow you to easily grow a RAID 5 array by adding 
more disks? I've used them before but it's been a while and I can't 
remember how easy that process would be. If it's a pain at all, that 
could be a good argument for using LVM instead...

OK, I managed to get the files installed. At 
least I think I did. There were two files on the 
ATI driver page, one for Xfree86 and the other 
for X.org. I downloaded them both. They are .rpm 
files.

Then, by right-clicking on them, I found an 
option "install with YaST." So I did with both. 
The process seemed to go OK.

Finally, I went into YaST, Display, and 
navigated to the place where it says the display 
is VESA 1024 x 768. There is a button there to 
Add Graphics Card, so I clicked on it. This 
brought up a list of manufacturers, and when I 
clicked on ATI I got a list of video cards. But 
the Radeon Xpress 200 was still not listed. I 
even restarted the computer, but the Radeon 
Xpress 200 is still not listed.

I'm wondering if the list of cards in YaST is 
hard coded. It displays so fast that I don't 
think it is getting a list off the disk.

I looked at the knowledgebase on suse.com, but 
couldn't find anything that addressed how to 
install a new graphics card driver.

There was a 32-bit version install of Mandriva as a dual-boot option,
which worked pretty much fine except we only had vesa quality video,
not the beautiful 1680x1050 (or whatever it was) native.

John,

   From within a virtual terminal, what do you see when you run 'lsmod' (list
modules) as root? The commands to load a module into the kernel are insmod
(the simpler of the two) and modprobe.

   You can try loading the appropriate driver (for XFree86 or X.org) manually
and see what your display does. When you confirm that it works, you can add
the driver to the same location as other loaded drivers and tell SuSE/Mandr*
to load them by putting the driver path and name where all loaded modules
are specified. (I've no idea where that is on your distributions, but in
Slackware it's /etc/rc.d/rc.modules.)

HTH,

Rich

The driver involved here is not a kernel module, it is an X driver
(for XFree86 or X.org).  It gets loaded when you (or init) start X.

Do a search for the item in question. After the search results page is
displayed, on the left you'll see a check box under "Search options" &
"Show only" for "Completed listings". Check it and click the "Show

I will be using a machine with a Java API.  I want to learn a little
Java first.  I have both the javac and jikes bytecode compilers on 
my machine.  I have built a couple of examples that work with javac. 

I would prefer to use the open source jikes, butI have not yet gotten
jikes to successfully compile my examples.  The only documentation I've
found for jikes is the manpage, and the FAQ at jikes.sourceforge.net .
I probably have an incorrect setup.

Are there any Java folks using jikes around here?  Can anyone suggest
more detailed newbie-oriented Howto's or tutorials that focus on jikes
and linux?

I'm sure there are folks on this list who'll be willing to flame me for
saying this, but as far as I'm concerned, I consider Java run-times or
compilers other than Sun's a dead waste of my time, and my
recommendation is that you do likewise. Yes, I know, the Sun offerings
are not free as in freedom, yes, I know about the "Java trap".
(http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/java-trap.html). There is an awful lot of
good software out there written in Java; if it "happens" to work on
other environments, fine and dandy.

So ... take it to PLUG-TALK if you want to flame me. My experiences with
jikes and blackdown were negative; I gave up on them.

I don't know whether that's cool or just silly.  It's sort of the same
concept, though, as a professional classic guitar (the kind with no
guide dots on the neck).  Too bad this thing isn't wireless.

That's nothing.  If you think having no labels on the keys makes you 
type faster, try having the wrong labels!  I had some stickers for a 
while.  First the home row wore off, then the stuff around the 
perimeter.  I think k was about the last to go.

Well, I might agree with you on the runtime issue:  it's wise to use
Sun's unless you've specific reasons not to.  But as for the compiler, I
find jikes superior to javac for its speed.  Been using it for several
years without problems.  Jikes has been very compliant to spec'; but if
I were worried about that, I would still use it on my development box,
and then I would use javac when testing and building for production. 
The main reason is, I save a little time that way every time I compile a
source file (and jikes will output errors in "Emacs format", which
allows my IDE to jump to the line and column of each error).  In other
words, jikes makes me more productive while coding.

So, Mr. Lofstrom, can you detail the problem you're having with jikes? 
Are you writing code specific to Java 1.5, perchance?

Well ... does anyone remember David Rosenboom? He was a composer who
hooked up EEG electrodes to his brain and "thought" music into existence
with the aid of a computer. IIRC you can still find his code somewhere
on the web; it's in some flavor of FORTH, Atari I think. Who even needs
a keyboard??

If you have awstats installed on any machine connected to the net, you
want to make sure you have the most up to date version.  If you have
installed the version from fedora.us, you need to upgrade to the real
current version ASAP.

Awstats has a remote program execution vulnerability.  The current
stable version is 6.4. You want to make sure you have at least that
version.

The bug is actively being exploited on the net.  I know. I just got hit

Java is available for the AMD 64.  Flash is not yet available.  (Which
is kind of a pain for some things.)

I have a number of machines running Fedora Core 2 running in 64 bit
mode.  My laptop is running Fedora Core 4 test 3 for AMD 64.  (Yes, I
have an AMD 64 laptop...)

AMD 64 has been working well for a while.  The hardest part seems to
have been working out the issue of having 32 bit and 64 bit packages
installed on the same system for the same package.

Thanks for all the responses...

It looks like highpoint is not a true hw RAID and 3ware looks good.
One question, is the setup for 3ware relatively smooth?
And the management software is easy to use?

I am open to use any linux distribution but currently have
Centos and Fedora installed.

Like Jason, it is these reasons that make me think that jikes is a
better compiler.  What is the problem with it?  It isn't made by Sun? 
So, Eclipse isn't made by Sun.  Do you use that?  Ant isn't made by
Sun.  Do you use that?  Those don't count  because they aren't
compilers.  Do you use AspectJ or some other compiler for aspect
orientated programming?  Having to use only Sun's compiler simply
because it is Sun's seems silly to me.

Just my options.  Like my socks, I'll change 'em tomorrow.

   This idea was in use at least 40 years ago. When I took a touch-typing
class in the Army (required for my assignment), the manual typewriters had
no identification on the keytops. We had to type at least 65 wpm on those
old Royal manual typewriters to pass the class and get out of advanced
training. Like riding a bike, touch typing is not forgotten once learned.

With some minor tweaks to your yum repos, you can install 64-bit and

sounds like your main problem is getting flash and java plugins to work
(which I count as a blessing, even when my roommate complains).  The
"solution" to this is to uninstall the x86_64 version of mozilla or
firefox and install the i386 one. Yum understands architectures through
the use of ".":

# yum install firefox.i386

will install the i386 (32-bit) version of firefox.  I'm pretty sure
you'll have to remove the x86_64 version first or it will conflict, but
not 100% certain.

Java, yes.  The java plugin, no.  But Java is already "Open Source

I thought this was a good description of what gets checked and what
happens when the check "fails":

http://aumha.org/win5/a/wpa.php

(archive.org version in case the above goes away:
http://web.archive.org/web/20041120093058/http://aumha.org/win5/a/wpa.php)

One quote from the above:

-----
If, on Windows startup, there are not the required seven Yes votes,
the system will, in the original version of Windows XP, only boot to
Safe Mode. You will be required to reactivate by a phone call to
Microsoft. You will have to write down a 50-digit number, call into
the activation center on a toll-free number that will be given to you,
read and check back the number you recorded ? and explain the
circumstances. In exchange, you will be given a 42-digit number to
type in. This will reactivate your copy of Windows.

This is made easier if Windows XP Service Pack 1 has been installed:
The system will continue to boot normally for three days, during which
time you will be able to contact the activation center via the net. If
the extra changes have been removed, or if 120 days have passed since
the original activation, you will be able to use the automatic process
once more
-----

It would seem that the start menu problems are not related to Windows
activation.

However, this brings up some interesting points for me-- has anyone
had any experience running multiple instances of XP inside virtual
machines (e.g. VMware)?  I would think the activation would cause some
severe problems with this.

PS: Disclaimer: I'm not running XP at home-- I still use trusty ol'
Win2k-in-a-VM when I need to.

Not nearly that far along.  Apparently, to make jikes work, I must
set some environment variables like CLASSPATH.  I have no clue where
to point those to, though.

I have been attempting to run some simple and ancient Hello World
kinds of examples through the compilers.  javac works OK, but jikes
gives me complaints like:

------------------------------------------------------------
   Found 1 system error:
 
   *** Semantic Error: You need to modify your classpath, sourcepath,
   bootclasspath, and/or extdirs setup. Jikes could not find package
   "java.lang" in:
                   .
------------------------------------------------------------
So yes, I need to set those paths.  A tutorial or howto that tells
me *where* to point them, or how to figure that out, would be handy.
It is stupid to have to ask when it should be documented somewhere.

Ah, okay, this is an easy one.  Jikes just needs to know where to find
the core java library, which is probably "$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/rt.jar".

If you set $JAVA_HOME, jikes may be able to find it that way, but you
might as well set a system-wide $CLASSPATH that includes that JAR.  If
you do neither of those, then jikes has no way of knowing the which and
the where of it.

Here's a safer option:  write yourself a wrapper script for invoking
jikes, that sets the classpath beforehand or passes it to jikes as an
option (an alias would also work).  You can even name the script "jikes"
and put it at the front of your path, if you like.  I actually have
different jikes wrappers for different projects, since they all have
different classpaths (often different sourcepaths as well).

> me *where* to point them, or how to figure that out, would be handy.
> It is stupid to have to ask when it should be documented somewhere.

There are a couple references in the man page to "java/jre/lib/rt.jar",
but it doesn't explicitly tell you to add that in when invoking jikes. 
The basic idea is that jikes is javac compatible; but javac knows where
to find that rt.jar by the location of the executable.  jikes doesn't
have that advantage.  So yeah, explicit mention of this discrepancy
would be helpful.

I know people that forgot how to touch type when they switched to Dvorak.

...then again, I know people who have forgotten how to ride a bicycle 
(though nearly everyone seems to have, but I'm giving them the benefit of 
the doubt).

As for learning to type without looking, I do much of my typing in the 
dark with my monitor turned off.  Most writers will tell you that the best 
way to get through a piece is to write once without revising... just let 
the words flow.  I had a terrible time not fixing things as I go.  Not 
only did I step back to fix typographical errors and minor choices in 
word, I could often be found revising entire paragraphs to fit some higher 
structural idea.  This takes time away from the project as a whole because 
the next time you sit down to write, you often go back and fix what you 
wrote last time.  Turning off the monitor was the best way I found to 
write long pieces that I knew I was going to revise later anyway.

Speaking of this, I've mentioned it before, but have never come across a 
real product like the one I seek:  I want a full-size, lightweight 
keyboard that takes a small battery (or has a rechargeable built-in) and 
some tiny flash storage device.  I want to just dump text to a file (say, 
creating a new file with a timestamp filename on each power-cycle) and 
look at it later.  Does such a thing exist?  What do you suppose it would 
cost to prototype such a thing?

(And yeah, I'd ideally want to convert a nice buckling-spring keyboard.)

Have you seen an alphasmart?
http://www.alphasmart.com/products/index.html

The original ones store plain text onboard then dump out to either PS/2 
(old models) or USB (new models).

Ebay has some of varied vintages listed.

Thanks!  Now jikes works. I wrote /usr/local/bin/jikes:

  #!/bin/bash
  JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/j2re1.4.2_05
  RTJAR=$JAVA_HOME/lib/rt.jar
  /usr/bin/jikes -classpath $RTJAR  $@

Now it compiles simple programs just like javac.

I won't be doing a lot of Java coding, just enough to learn how to
read what others write and test it out, so the choice of javac or
jikes is not critical.   However, I will have other people doing
most of the coding, and I will strongly encourage portable coding
methods.  The code they write should use the least common denominator,
and compile with either javac or jikes.

The Alphasmart has alredy been mentioned.  Wouldn't be too terribly
hard to build with a PIC, but I bet if you rigged up a 5V power
supply, you could use one of those PS/2 hardware keyloggers.

Alternately, an old Palm with a fold-up keyboard wouldn't be as nice,
but would be more versatile.

I recommend spiritone.com.  I started with them in '98 when it was
aracnet.com.  Spiritone bought aracnet.  Really good support.  Besides

I have been trying to get the fedora.us people to update the package.
There are people who keep saying "just upgrade to FC3" instead of
patching the older archive.  It is starting to piss me off.  (The
machine I have on FC1 will take some time to upgrade.  I don't have the
time at the moment.)

I don't know if this contains enough detail for you, but you might try
reading Chapter 9 of "The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital
Signal Processing".  You can download for free from here:

Just for clarification, his site appears to be at http://tvlinux.org/
I just made a random guess based on the domain he sent the email from :)
TV seems to stand for 'Tualatin Valley.'

I just got home and read some messages.  TVLinux  http://www.tvlinux.org 
is a TV show about Open source produced at the Tualatin Valley TV studio 
http://www.yourtvtv.org.    TV in TVLinux stands for both Taulatin 
Valley and TV (Television).

I wish we could do some things on using Linux to produce TV shows but 
even Linux requires $$$ hardware.  I do have a pchd3000 card that I plan 
to play with and get working.

The first LIVE show should be the the second Tuesday In July. At that 
time there will be a IRC channel to ask questions.   That show will be 
the 8th show in the series. all the shows before that one have been 
taped live.  The schedual is on the website http://www.tvlinux.org/node/2

I am working on a large HD so I can produce streaming  video, then every 
one on the web can watch the show.  Slowly everything will shape up.

You're describing what you're trying to accomplish in rather low-level
DSP detail. There are some very "user friendly" DSP packages out there.
I think Matlab is probably the best known, but it's licensed. There are
free variants, however -- Octave is for sure free and SciLab is at least
in the Debian and Gentoo repositories, although I don't know if the
SciLab license passes the strictest definitions of freedom.

If you're working with audio frequency data, you've got even more
options in the free software world. These packages will all give you
nice graphical results, spectral, lots of options, choice of windows, etc.

My reading says that your must sort before uniq works right.
But then, that's what I wanted it to do.

That depends on what you want uniq to do.  I've used it on 
files with lots of blank lines to strip out the blank lines.

I don't need graphics, I need a number and I need to do it in "batch
mode" over a large number of wave captures, so I want to do it in C.
I am already using FFTW.  I mostly just need to understand how to
apply the windowing (e.g. Hamming and Flat-top, which I think I am
*starting* to get a handle on).  The thing I seem to be missing right
now is what scaling factors need to be applied to the FFT results to
recover amplitude accurately.  If I inject a sine-wave of known
amplitude, I am not getting that back out of the FFT, when that is
precisely what I need to do.

And BTW, this is lower frequency stuff.  The sampling rate is 2KHz and
the primary signal we are looking for is 60Hz (power frequency).

Hmm.  It helped slightly.  It focuses on detection (ie. resolving

(i.e. estimating the amplitude of the signals).

Message-ID: <4295DE99.6090200@comcast.net>

I returned the R4000 after giving up trying to get the video right. And 
simultaneously ordered an R3470. That was Wednesday. Later that day I 
got an e-mail from hpshopping.com that my order had been selected for 
random anti-credit card fraud scrutiny. It seems they called me and I 
wasn't home so I didn't answer the phone, which they thought was 
suspicious. This morning I finally got it straightened out and they went 
ahead to process the order. And then they told me they were out of stock 
of the R3470 and would never have any more, as it is discontinued. And 
they have no other R3000 series notebooks with 1 Gb RAM. The only way I 
can get a full Gb of RAM with an Athlon-64 is to buy an R4000, which can 
be customized.

Considering what I went through with the R4000 and now this, I can only 
conclude that I was not meant to own an Athlon-64 notebook with Linux.

Lots out there.  Very simply, windowing is merely a matter of weighting
the input data before applying the FFT to it, to minimize some of the
artifacts that result from the limited sample size.  

For example, if the sample domain ranges from zero to 2pi, then raised
cosine weighting would multiply each data point in your data window by
( 1-cos(X) ), which doubles the weight of the middle points and makes
the endpoints disappear.  This flattens out the apparent frequency
response, which is important for correct conclusions in some analyses.

The different windows have different functions, a bit harder to describe
but still easy to compute, which result in different artifacts in the
result.   Whatever you do to restrict data, however, will result in
some distortion in the result.  The choice of windows should be done
with an eye towards what kinds of decisions you must make using those
results.

make has a built in command called "sort":

HFILE_SORT = $(sort $(HFILE_LIST))

that also uniq's the contents of the variable.  In doing that, it
changes the order of the elements in the variable, which allows a
trivial implementation of uniq.

In our case, the element order is important because it tells us
the order in which to do a build, so we're trying to find
a way to uniq the contents without sorting.

I can give you more details about why this has to be this way for
our system, but it gets very hairy.

   I am a happy customer of Emperor Linux <http://www.emperorlinux.com/>.
Don't know if they have an AMD-64 processor machine, but they build custom
kernels that support each and every hardware feature, provide the
distribution of your choice (Slackware, Fedora/Red Hat, Debian, etc.), will
make it dual boot with winduhs, and provide excellent support. I recommend
them without reservation.

Russell,

It's been a long time since I did any of this, but it seemed like I used 
to convert the output of the FFT into polar coordinates. This  gives a 
histogram/array. The indices somehow map to the frequency and the value 
at each index is the amplitude for the frequency.

Laptops can have all sorts of specialized hardware and so the best thing you 
can do is go throughly research your laptop and find out every chip it has in 
so you can see if appropriate Linux drivers exist for the laptop. This is 
especially true for video and WIFI.

Is there anything special about having an AMD-64 laptop instead of a 32-bit 
Pentium M-based laptop or something like that? I've found that I don't really 
need a very high-end laptop for a laptop to be useful to me. I need email, 
web-browser, news reader, IM, word-processing/spreadsheet. For hardware 
support I need decent 2D video graphics, sound,  ethernet/WIFI support, and a 
DVD R/RW drive and that's about it.

By all means if an AMD-64 laptop suits your needs then by all means get one 
but find out the model numbers of all of the devices so you can find out if 
Linux has native driver support for everything.

I have a company issued Dell Inspiron 5150 with a 3.06Ghz P4, 1GB RAM, and 
60GB 7200 RPM hard drive. It has an nVIDIA FX5200 adapter and does pretty 
nice 3D graphics. The downside it that this laptop is very heavy, runs hotter 
than hell and I have to carry around a brick-like 130W power supply for the 
thing. 

Initially I thought it was great having such a powerful laptop but I got my 
own,  personal Inspiron 6000 with a 1.6GhZ Pentium M that runs so much cooler 
and is not a boat anchor. It has more than enough power for all of the things 
I need  a laptop for and uses a small 65W power supply and the battery life 
exceeds 4 hours. If I need more performance and better graphics I'll get a 
desktop system as it's much cheaper than a laptop.

Regards,

Tony

Ah. But do you actually need to `uniq` them then? If there is an output
file that Make can check the timestamps on, then Make will check the
timestamps, and skip trying to rebuild those pieces. Perhaps not as
efficient as `uniq`ing them, but certainly effective.

Actually, we think the build system needs an enema, but that will
need to wait for some spare time to redesign and reimplement.

For now it sounds like I'd better use a pipe to take it outside where
it will be easier to get the job done in Perl.

Hi John,

I think any of the distros should work fine for what you want. They pretty
much all offer the option to customize the amount of stuff you install.
Many of the default GUIs now are built on GNOME and KDE which might be
slow on a Pentium or Pentium II, but you can always install a different
window manager and use that instead.

One distro that is pretty cool is Gentoo -- they make it pretty easy to
build a system with binaries that are compiled for your processor.

What kind of a fileserver and whatcha need a GUI interface to get in the

I have forgotten how to set it up. I know I have a working cable and

I believe I have a working serial port.
Yet I can't see the Cisco's boot info.
 I was using minicom, and I think I configured everything right,but..

It would be very helpful to have someone remind me gently how to set it up.

Thanks in advance,

I used Fedore Core and the  xfce4 window system  for beginning users.  
You still have to know which commands  to use for system maintaince.  X 
is still big but xfce4 is small.  The next step down is using frame 
buffer but that would be too much work.

Is the GUI friendliness crucial for you? Debian is an *excellent*
candidate for this sort of installation, but is very low on the
friendliness quotient. Notably Debian can be trimmed down to a very small
number of required packages, Debian packages tend to work, and you don't
need to do distribution release upgrades very often.

I must disagree here. On the above class of hardware the gains will be
minimal (or negative!), while it will take forever to build.

Yeah, I was doing that already.  My problem erupted when I discovered
that in my sample of N measurements, unless the signal ends nicely
where it begins (in the time-domain), a discontinuity appears in the
infinite projection of the signal, and that discontinuity in turn
induces power bleed into adjacent frequency bands.  The windowing is a
way to try to deal with that.  Another way to deal with it is, if you
know in advance the dominant frequency, to pick an N that matches full
cycles of that frequency.  I am doing that too.

To illustrate in ASCII art:


+                       *                       +                       +
   +                 +  |  *                 *  |  +                 +   
     +             +    |    *             *    |    +             +     
- - - + - - - - - + - - - - - * - - - - - * - - - - - + - - - - - + - - -
       +         +      |      *         *      |      +         +       
         +     +        |        *     *        |        +     +         
            +           |           *           |           +            
                        +-----------------------+ 

In an FFT, you have a finite sample, which is assumed to repeat
forever.  If your sample consists of a whole number of waves
(represented by the asterisks) then everything is happy.  If, instead,
it looks like this:

                  +      *                       *      +                
               +     +   |  *                 *     *   |  +             
             +         + |    *             *         * |    +           
+ - - - - - + - - - - - +- - - * - - - - - * - - - - - *- - - + - - - - -
 +         +             |      *         *             |      +         
   +     +               |        *     *               |        +     + 
      +                  |           *                  |           +    
-------------------------+------------------------------+----------------

then the Fourier Transform isn't as clean and pretty.  What the
windows effectively do, is clamp down the sample at the boundaries to
zero, which attenuates some of the signal but also eliminates the
discontinuity. 

What I hadn't figured out was what the window applied to.  Was it a
moving average kind of thing?  Or did it apply to the whole sample at
once?  Turns out the latter for my purposes.  And the other thing was
how to scale the result.  This turned out to be the intuitively
obvious, you effectively divide the result by the sum of the weights
you apply.

Most of the literature I found assumed that I had read the first 8
chapters of the book, which I hadn't done, though I maybe understood
an ill-defined 5 or 6 of those chapters.  Filling in the holes led to
my difficulty.

Unga-gunga-gulunga.

The settings for the serial port are likely wrong. Verify that you're using 
8N1, no flow control.
If you don't know what I mean.. Cisco's website has howto-style instructions 
for doing this in their public docs. :)

I just went to the AWStats site and downloaded the rpm.  Since it was a 
noarch I had no problems installing it on RHL 9 system.  Actaully it was a 
Vserver so I installed it on all the web sites there.

I have alos seen several postings ( which escape me now ) that recommend
_not_ using fedora.us because of the issue you state above and others.

I have nearly all my Fedora Core systems pointed at dries' and/or dag's 
repositories and have had far fewer problems since going that route.  In 
fact ; a quick peek shows AWStats 6.4-1.2 at dags 
(http://dag.wieers.com/packages/awstats/) right now and place March 8th.

Hi Charlie,

Well it appears I have the settings correct. I'm beginning to suspect a 
bad serial port.
Is there a way to test the port to see if it's working?

I'm running very old RH 7.0 on a 200 Mhz Pentium. The machine serves 
essentially the purpose you're proposing, albeit without a raid array, just 1 
each, 4 Gb and 40 Gb drives. I tried upgrading to a later version and ran 
into an audio problem. My system holds .mp3 files and plays them with mpg123, 
the output of the sound card being wired to the stereo in the living room. 
With RH 8, I had problems that folks told me would be solved with the "low 
latency patch." That patch didn't work for me, and I went back to RH 7.0. I 
don't consider it a serious security problem since the machine sits inside my 
firewall, and doesn't go out on the Internet for anything.

While it does have Gnome available, I rarely log into it from it's own 
keyboard. I run Samba on it, and access files on it from my Winders machines 
and from my other Linux machine. It's also running Apache, and serves the 
house with a local web site, but neither of those require a gui. So, I'd go 
along with the other recommendations in this thread to dispense with the gui. 
Just run the services you need, and do your system maintenance from another 
machine.

Anything that "bleeding edge" in a laptop is bound to be prone to
issues. Think about it ... a full gigabyte of RAM, a 64-bit chip, a hard
drive, a PCI emulation chip set, a battery and advanced charging
circuitry all crammed into a tiny space and running an OS that may be at
least a couple of weeks behind the hardware. How many watts does that
monster consume?

Unless you absolutely postively for really really real need that battery
operation capability, I'll be you can find something small and light
with an Athlon 64, a real PCI subsystem, video and sound with Linux
drivers, a high-speed large hard drive, and possibly even room for more
than a GB of RAM.

I went on the Internet a couple of months ago and priced high-end AMD 64
gamer systems, and except for the RAM, which was hideously expensive,
these things were way more powerful than laptops at lower prices. And
they were perfectly willing to give you a discount if you didn't want
Windows loaded on it. When I'm ready for an AMD 64, I'll go with a
free-standing plug in model, and when my current (dual booted
XP/Gentoo/Athlon XP) laptop croaks, I'll get something cheap to replace it.

Russell,

Are you doing coherent sampling?

Using this formula:

    Fs / N = Ft / M

If you aren't, I can try to explain it.

There other area that could be causing problems is the the test 
equipment you are using for sampling. If your test equipment isn't very 
accurate in sampling the jitter in the test equipment could be the cause 
of your problems. The speed of the sampling is not as important as the 
accuracy of the sampling.

Nice ASCII art.

Jim

Yow.  Emacs giveth and Emacs taketh away!  

I did the original by hand, not too shabby if I do say so myself.
Rectangular buffer operations and overwrite mode were a significant
help.  And then Emacs/Gnus quoting squashed it down to what you see

Fs / N = Ft / M

This is a relationship that must be maintained when you are making your measurements. 
Fs = sampling frequency
Ft = test signal frequency
N  = total number of samples
M  = total number cycles.

M and N must be mutually prime. This means they can't have any common factors. N must be a power of 2 for your FFT to work, and this means that M will always be odd.

You must fiddle with these values to get the Fs and Ft to about 7 or 8 significant digits. Your test equipment has a sampling resolution which will effect what you can select for Ft. Failing to keep this relationship can account for the glitch that you see at the end of your waveform, and add a bunch of high frequency noise.

:-(

I'm shocked.

Chris was a real guru... he helped me out with a few questions about
various random subjects from December of '03 through May of '04, taking
time to really help out and see what he could do to help me solve
whatever problem it was at the time.  I was always impressed by his
level of knowledge, friendly personality, and willingness to help.

I think the Linux community lost somebody valuable.  :-(

I'm sure there are others he helped similarly (search your old emails if
you're not sure)... it would be nice to do something for his family, but
I don't know what.  Any ideas?

Rob

You could make a loop back connector, with transmit(s) and recieve(s)
tied together.  Then your terminal emulator will echo everything that
you type.

Good Luck,

I was shopping for a camera a couple of months ago and had occassion to visit 
Pro Photo over in NW Portland. They had a Mac running Photoshop set up with a 
very large (24" x 15" or so?), wide format monitor. Since that wasn't the 
purpose of my trip, and since my wife was with me, I didn't take the time to 
find out the specs, but from the brief glance I had, I was very impressed.

The Apple Cinema displays are very pretty, albeit fairly spendy: $800 
for 20", $1500 for 24", and $3000 for 30". They are strictly digital; 
you can't drive them with analog signals. In fact, the 30" display can 
be driven by a fairly limited number of video cards.

These displays make *great* props at tradeshow booths.

Thanks Derek,

Actually it was simpler than that.
I'd forgotten how slow this particular router was.
Also, it seems the serial port is the last thing allocated for memory on 
my machine at work. So, the port is working, the trouble was an 
unskilled operator. :)
But at least now I can get back to work.
When I get into work this weekend(yes, some techs will be working this 
holiday) I'll copy and send in some really nifty script that I used to 
double check the Serial port settings.
one of the went:

demsg |grep ttyS

So cool.


Thanks to one and all.

Harry

There's a server I've been using lately, after disconnecting from which
I almost always lose my local prompt, which forces me to close my Eterm
window and open a new one.  I've occasionally had this problem with
other servers, but with this one it's pretty consistent, so I'm hoping
there's a some way I can configure it to mitigate the problem.

Does anyone know why this happens?

Message-ID: <42975543.2040205@comcast.net>

I'm trying to get Server Side Includes to work with Apache 2.0.51.  I've 
found some stuff on the net but it hasn't helped.  From what I've read I 
just need to add the following to my httpd.conf file:

Options +Includes
  AddType text/html .inc
  AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .inc

I've done this and restarted Apache, and created some test web page and 
a test file with the .inc extension but it didn't work.  I also tried 
changing .inc to .shtml like all of the examples but that didn't help.  
Below is my code for the test web page:

<html>
<title>Include Test Page</title>
<body>
If this works we should see the date printed on the page<p>
<!--#echo var="DATE_LOCAL" -->
<!--#include virtual="test.inc" -->
</body>
</html>

test.inc is just a simple file with one line of text to display in it.  
 From what I know of SSI this should work.  Any ideas of what I'm 
missing here?

Thanks

Robert

May I ask why you want an Athlon 64 so badly?  They might be the best
performance for your money, but they're very new--new enough that I
haven't had my hands on any.  While Linux has been on 64-bit platforms
for a decade or so, they've been supported by distros mainly as a server
platform and generally something of a second-class citizen to ia32.

Add that to the fact that laptops themselves, with their dizzying array
of specialized hardware, have themselves been second-class citizens;
compound further the fact that you yourself are a neophyte and you have
a recipe for disaster.

Why not a nice Pentium M system with an ATI video chipset and Orinoco
wireless?

The module is loaded, correct?  <prefix>/apache/bin/apachectl -l should
output mod_include.c.  If not, you'll need to load it explicitly in your
config.

Use long prompt by default, and try to send stuff through the
lesspipe.sh script first (which does fancy things like list the
insides of a .zip file).

Frankly, the error you first listed on the mailing list sounded like a
termcap/ncurses issue.

They're new, yes, but "very new" ?

If Google is not lying to me, I believe the chip was released on 22 Sep
2003 and was in circulation by January of 2004.

While apachectl -l didn't show it, looking at my httpd.conf file indeed

Most of those aren't of Chris, though.  At least they don't look like
who I remember from the two PLUG talks he gave: an AT on "Modern File
Systems" circa June 2003; and a general meeting talk on "User Mode
Linux" in February 2004.

Here's one I *think* is him, a somewhat unflattering digital camera
self-portrait: <http://gallery.maybe.net/chris_misc/DSC00083>

Doing a little googling just now, I find that he was active in Debian
community as well.

I recall that during the UML talk, he apologized for a few pauses in
his presentation that gave me (from the back of the room) the
impression he was having some mild seizures.  Excellent talk though.

Are you sure your apache is using that conf file? What's the command 
line? If you do 'ps axwww | grep apache' what does it show?

Just a thought.

It's the only httpd.conf file I found using find.

'ps axwww | grep apache' didn't return anything so I tried the following:

'ps axwww | grep httpd' and here is what it returned:

[root at MyMail conf]# ps axwww | grep httpd

For some reason, when you exit from the remote server, your local ssh
session doesn't get the hangup signal.

When that happens, just type ~. in the hung terminal window. You won't
see your keystrokes, but the ~ (tilde) is the escape character for your
local ssh session, and period means close the session. That should drop
you back to your local shell prompt in that Eterm window.

More Hewlett-Packard Weirditude

So, having decided to return the Compaq R4000 I called for an RMA and 
simultaneously ordered an R3470. As previously mentioned, HP got the 
credit card stuff screwed up and by the time I got it straightened out, 
the R3470 was out of stock.

I spent the next couple days looking for an R3000 series. There aren't 
very many available at online merchants, and eBay is a bit scary for a 
laptop. So about noon yesterday I decided to buy the R3340 which is 
still available on hpshopping.com in their refurbished area. Not quite 
as good a deal as the R3470, but still better than I could get anywhere 
else. Both the R3470 and the R3340 have nVidia video and there is ample 
documentation at Linux on Laptops for getting the video to work at 1280 
x 800.

The sales dude had told me that it might not make it in time to be 
shipped out on Friday. So about 2 pm I went to hpshopping.com and 
checked on the order. And once again I saw "payment not authorized." So 
this time, before calling HP, I called the manager at my bank, who knows 
me. Together we went on a conference call to the bank's card approval 
department. When I gave the guy at the card approval department the 
exact amount he verified that the bank had approved it a little after 
noon that day. Furthermore, he indicated that they had approved the 
previous purchase right after I had made it a few days earlier. He also 
verified that there was nothing whatsoever wrong with my account, no 
holds or restraints of any kind.

Armed with this information I called HP. I insisted on being escalated 
to someone who could straighten things out. This got me to a fellow who 
identified himself as a "supervisor" with the name "Tim." Tim proceeded 
to explain that HP uses "industry standard" practices to scrutinize 
phone and internet credit card transactions to prevent indentity theft 
and fraud. He assured me he could straighten things out if I could just 
answer a few questions. "Sure," I said, "no problem." He said HP had 
developed a series of questions designed to protect their customers from 
illegal practices. I told him to go ahead.

 The first question was "given the first names Edward, Josh, Samuel, 
Michael and William, which did I most identify with?" I am not making 
this up.

"What questions are coming next?" I asked, "ink blots?"

I declined to answer such a silly question and we had some discussion 
whether I was willing to continue. Finally I agreed to listen the the 
second question. This turned out to be another set of first names, again 
asking which I most identified with. But this time one of the names was 
John, so I laughed and told him my answer was John. "Fine," he said, 
apologizing again for the inconvenience and assuring me that this series 
of questions was "industry standard" and that HP took security very 
seriously to protect its customers.

We proceeded to the third question, which asked me for the billing 
address on my credit card. For about the fourth time I repeated it, 
including the nine-digit zip code, hoping that would indicate that I 
wasn't someone who found a credit card lying on the sidewalk. He thanked 
me for the answer and repeated again the corporate spin about how sorry 
he was for inconveniencing me and how seriously HP took security 
matters. Then asked me the fourth question, which was "what is your 
social security number?"

Now, as anyone who met met at the Clinic and has read my Linux questions 
here, clearly I have some seriously dumb moments. But I'm not totally 
stupid. I decided this was not only the last straw, but it was time to 
inform him that I had already contacted my bank and that the charge had 
been approved hours earlier. I told him that no way was he getting my 
social security number. Then I added the details about the conference 
call the bank manager and I had had a few minutes earlier. I gave him 
her direct telephone number. And then I told him our interview was over. 
I further added that he could do whatever he wanted, but if the website 
did not show the transaction was approved by 4 pm I was calling the bank 
and blocking the transaction. And that I was then going to Fry's to buy 
a Sony. And then I hung up without waiting for a response.

I checked again a little after four and the website still says "not 
authorized." So I called the manager back and explained what had gone 
on. She couldn't believe my report of the conversation. We made another 
conference call to the card approval department. Normally once 
authorization is given you can't undo the transaction. But having the 
branch manager on the phone got past that little difficulty. Having a 
substantial account at the bank also helped. :)

There is only one conclusion we could reach. HP is pissed that I 
returned the R4000 (for which they refunded the full $1428 I pad for 
it), and has blocked me.

I really do like the Compaq R3000 series. Love everything about it. But 
I guess I won't be buying one, unless perhaps a good deal comes up on 
eBay. Later today I'm going to go to Fry's and check out laptops some more.

I've checked out Linux on Laptops and read a great deal about which 
brands are best. Everyone says Thinkpads are great with Linux, but 
they're just too ugly for my artistic side. But at least I have mostly 
given up the idea of getting a 64-bit laptop and running a 64-bit distro

More Hewlett-Packard Weirditude

So, having decided to return the Compaq R4000 I called for an RMA and
simultaneously ordered an R3470. As previously mentioned, HP got the credit
card stuff screwed up and by the time I got it straightened out, the R3470
was out of stock.

I spent the next couple days looking for an R3000 series. There aren't very
many available at online merchants, and eBay is a bit scary for a laptop. So
about noon yesterday I decided to buy the R3340 which is still available on
hpshopping.com in their refurbished area. Not quite as good a deal as the
R3470, but still better than I could get anywhere else. Both the R3470 and
the R3340 have nVidia video and there is ample documentation at Linux on
Laptops for getting the video to work at 1280 x 800.

The sales dude had told me that it might not make it in time to be shipped
out on Friday. So about 2 pm I went to hpshopping.com and checked on the
order. And once again I saw "payment not authorized." So this time, before
calling HP, I called the manager at my bank, who knows me. Together we went
on a conference call to the bank's card approval department. When I gave the
guy at the card approval department the exact amount he verified that the
bank had approved it a little after noon that day. Furthermore, he indicated
that they had approved the previous purchase right after I had made it a few
days earlier. He also verified that there was nothing whatsoever wrong with
my account, no holds or restraints of any kind.

Armed with this information I called HP. I insisted on being escalated to
someone who could straighten things out. This got me to a fellow who
identified himself as a "supervisor" with the name "Tim." Tim proceeded to
explain that HP uses "industry standard" practices to scrutinize phone and
internet credit card transactions to prevent indentity theft and fraud. He
assured me he could straighten things out if I could just answer a few
questions. "Sure," I said, "no problem." He said HP had developed a series
of questions designed to protect their customers from illegal practices. I
told him to go ahead.

 The first question was "given the first names Edward, Josh, Samuel, Michael
and William, which did I most identify with?" I am not making this up.

"What questions are coming next?" I asked, "ink blots?"

I declined to answer such a silly question and we had some discussion
whether I was willing to continue. Finally I agreed to listen the the second
question. This turned out to be another set of first names, again asking
which I most identified with. But this time one of the names was John, so I
laughed and told him my answer was John. "Fine," he said, apologizing again
for the inconvenience and assuring me that this series of questions was
"industry standard" and that HP took security very seriously to protect its
customers.

We proceeded to the third question, which asked me for the billing address
on my credit card. For about the fourth time I repeated it, including the
nine-digit zip code, hoping that would indicate that I wasn't someone who
found a credit card lying on the sidewalk. He thanked me for the answer and
repeated again the corporate spin about how sorry he was for inconveniencing
me and how seriously HP took security matters. Then asked me the fourth
question, which was "what is your social security number?"

Now, as anyone who met met at the Clinic and has read my Linux questions
here, clearly I have some seriously dumb moments. But I'm not totally
stupid. I decided this was not only the last straw, but it was time to
inform him that I had already contacted my bank and that the charge had been
approved hours earlier. I told him that no way was he getting my social
security number. Then I added the details about the conference call the bank
manager and I had had a few minutes earlier. I gave him her direct telephone
number. And then I told him our interview was over. 
I further added that he could do whatever he wanted, but if the website did
not show the transaction was approved by 4 pm I was calling the bank and
blocking the transaction. And that I was then going to Fry's to buy a Sony.
And then I hung up without waiting for a response.

I checked again a little after four and the website still says "not
authorized." So I called the manager back and explained what had gone on.
She couldn't believe my report of the conversation. We made another
conference call to the card approval department. Normally once authorization
is given you can't undo the transaction. But having the branch manager on
the phone got past that little difficulty. Having a substantial account at
the bank also helped. :)

There is only one conclusion we could reach. HP is pissed that I returned
the R4000 (for which they refunded the full $1428 I pad for it), and has
blocked me.

I really do like the Compaq R3000 series. Love everything about it. But I
guess I won't be buying one, unless perhaps a good deal comes up on eBay.
Later today I'm going to go to Fry's and check out laptops some more.

I've checked out Linux on Laptops and read a great deal about which brands
are best. Everyone says Thinkpads are great with Linux, but they're just too
ugly for my artistic side. But at least I have mostly given up the idea of
getting a 64-bit laptop and running a 64-bit distro on it. I definitely want
something that is 15.4 widescreen at 1280 x 800, a gig of RAM and as fast a
CPU as I can get. Since I'm back to square one with the shopping, I'm open
to suggestions.

I always knew installing Linux would present challenges. I didn't realize

Losing Chris reminds us that we are all mortal.  Some of us are
maintaining open source projects, and many of us have information
and records well encrypted on our own machines.  While it is tragic
to lose the individual, the tragedy is compounded when others depend
on the information we keep secure.  And as Linux users, some of us
keep our data *very* secure.

In March 2004, the original author of Dirvish, JW Schultz, was
murdered for witnessing a crime.   The Dirvish CVS tree was stored
on his encrypted disks, and was unrecoverable by the best forensic
computer scientists.  His death was a terrible loss to the development
of Dirvish, and the CVS information took months to reconstruct.

It might be helpful to set up some sort of "information escrow"
mechanism for PLUG members.  For example, I could regularly construct
a file containing all my secret information, encrypt it with my
public key, and regularly send it to special email accounts maintained
by a few trusted individuals. 

Separately, I could send printed fragments of my private keys to
other trusted individuals.  Some mechanism where some fraction of
those key fragments can be combined to produce a whole one would 
allow, say, 5 individuals out of 8 to combine their key fragments
and get access to my data.  

Setting up a tested mechanism for this might help our project teams
and our families recover after our own death or disablement.   This
possibility is only one drunk driver away.  Anyone interested in
setting up such a mechanism?

How about instead of going to all of that trouble, you just keep your 
Open Source projects on an unencrypted disk? I can't see why someone 
would need to encrypt a CVS tree for an Open Source project in the first 
place.

That's the funniest story I've ever seen here.  HP is getting extremely
strange.  After all the Carly-driven reorgs, it seems to have people in
jobs they're quite unsuited for... as in, shrinks writing New HP credit
security scripts.  I saw an HP job description for a printer warranty
reporting job that must have been written by a R&D lab statistics type.

You mentioned getting a Sony at Fry's.  Don't get a Sony.  They're full
of odd proprietary devices that only "work" (er, sort of) under Windows
because they don't have Linux drivers, e.g., PCMCIA stuff and WinModems.

And in general, don't buy a notebook at Fry's.  Unless you enjoy paying
more than things are worth, that is.  Better to find a used notebook on
eBay that's got the specs you want, offered by a reputable, high-volume
seller that takes Visa/MC (so you can cancel the charge if you need to).

Notebooks are just tools, not fashion accessories.  If you want a really
cool fashion statement, get an iBook (or whatever Apple's selling now).
After all, Linus has an Apple desktop system, so it's gotta be so cool.
But I'm just kidding.  An iBook might be hard to get working with Linux.

Sorry about your experience with HP....

   You might try telling this to the folks at EmperorLinux. They've been
selling Sony models with linux for several years now. Mine works just fine,
too.

   I had a couple of Toshiba laptops on which I installed linux. Both
installations went without problems and the machines did everything I
wanted or needed them to do.

Totally agreed on prices at Fry's. I was just going to go there to look. 
It's got to be at least halfway attractive. Sorry, but sitting for hours 
staring at some of these computers would ugly me to death..

Fry's has a Compaq R3470 just like the one I tried to buy at hpshopping. 
Price at hpshopping was $1129. Listed as refurb, but it was actually a 
closeout. Fry's wants $1629 and seems unaware that it's been sitting on 
the shelf for a year. I'd buy it if they'd come down to something 
reasonable.

Actually, I think don't think Apples are particularly attractive. 
Rounded corners are so last millennium. And I don't want my whole life 
in white. The only way to use an Apple properly is in a sterile white 
room, at a desk with a white tablecloth and a rosebud in a vase. Plus, 
they're horribly expensive if you want one with some horespower.

I spent some time this morning surfing for laptops. What do you guys 
think of this Sager?

http://store.agearnotebooks.com/sager3790photo.html

There is a writeup on it at

http://www.caprinae-ascendant.net/foss/linux-on-sager.php

You can buy it without an OS, and the writeup leads me to believe that 
it might be a pretty good Linux laptop. It's just kind of spendy. Fitted 
out the way I want it, it comes to about $1800 or so, depending on 
retailer. And it has the mobile Pentium M 750, which is not as fast as I 
wish it had. And worse, there is no way for me to go look at one to see 
what it looks like. Sager does offer 30-day no-questions return policy, 
though. On the other hand, I haven't had the best experiences with 
return policies lately, now have I?

I've used privoxy for a few years now. I basically use the default setup, only modifying user.action to add sites I don't want cookies deleted from 
and sometimes for allowing popups. I don't notice any slowdown on my Comcast connection.

Have you gone to config.privoxy.org and made sure it is working right? And you are routing your web browser through port 8118?

Three notes on this. The tilde must follow a newline. Not generally a
problem, as most of the time you're only interested in one of the tilde
commands after having pressed enter, but something to be aware of.
Second, there are a couple other tilde commands, notably ~? lists them
and gives quick usage information on all of them. Finally, tilde escapes
itself, if actually need to type a tilde after a newline, you need to
type tilde twice.

Personally I dislike using ~. as it points to something on the other end
thinking you're still active. Most likely this would mean something on a
tunneled connection is active.

Depends on how much horsepower you need. Remember, they're using PPC
which doesn't need the high clock speed of the Pentiums to get a heck of
a lot done, though I do understand that PPC might actually be a problem
for you. They also place emphasis on getting pretty good battery life,
which tends to mean a slower processor that uses less power. If you look
they're fairly competitive on price with PC laptops. No worse than Sony
at least.

The only issue would be the graphics chips. As with the PC world, taking
full advantage of the modern graphics chips requires a bit of software
from either ATi or nVIDIA, and I don't believe they're supporting
Linux-PPC. Making partial use, and merely getting 2D acceleration should
be easy though.

Laptop opinions:  The speed of a laptop is measured in human terms
by how long you have to wait to complete a slow calculation.  Worst
case, this is the field service turnaround time... :-(  Thus, the
responsiveness of the company supplying (and eventually repairing)
the laptop should be a big part of your decision, and that is measured
by the experiences of others.

Thus, I am really bummed that HP treated John so ... weirdly.  After
watching IBM's Thinkpad service erode from outstanding to mediocre,
I was hoping that HP would retain a clue.  Keep looking, I guess...

Laptops cram an enormous amount of technology into a tiny case, which
gets much more physical abuse than a typical desktop.  Something has
to give, and it is usually some combination of price and reliability. 
So plan on repairs about once a year, get the extended warranty. 
Make sure that the service organization can find and repair problems,
and do so quickly.  IBM used to be able to ship and repair a laptop
door-to-door in 36 hours, which is why I once was quite loyal to
them, in spite of their higher price.

Plan on buying extra AC adapters, unless you are fond of crawling 
under furniture.  You will probably want a CD-RW so you can write
Knoppix disks for strangers.  It is handy to have a removable hard
drive cage, so when you inevitably send the machine in for service,
you can keep your data.  I have Ultrabay drives for my thinkpads,
so I can swap CD-RW, floppy, and second hard drive.

One thing that I don't want is built-in modems and built-in wifi,
Linux drivers or not.  Modems connect to phone wires, which are
often exposed to lightning and other nasties.  I prefer to connect
through an easily replaceable PCMCIA card.  Built-in wifi chipsets
are usually 20mW or under, and often have driver problems, while
PCMCIA cards such as the Senao 200mW Prism2 card have good driver
support and much greater reach.  And when you eject the card, you
can be sure that the network is disconnected;  this is harder to
verify with software-controlled built-in Wifi.

But before buying anything, ask another Linux user who has the
model you are contemplating.  That is why the Linux for Laptops
website is useful.  Life is too short to spend it chasing down
X drivers for oddball video chipsets.

If you have a new iBook, though, you have OS X on it... negating such a

Are you sure you need such CPU horsepower in a laptop?  Unless you're
gaming on the thing and don't have a workstation for such hobbies,
battery life (and a non-burned lap) is generally far preferable to CPU
power.

And the Pentium M does a good job for the MHz... don't let the MHz
rating fool you.  The Pentium M takes the best from the Pentium III and
the best from the Pentium 4, giving a chip that is almost on par with
those AMD produces.  :-)

I think you got squirrelled, there.  I deal with credit cards over the 
phone and the internet all day long at work, and this isn't the first 
job where I've had to handle such transactions over the internet.  
I'm pretty sure I'd be looking at a serious reprimand if I got to 
keep my job if I jerked a customer around like that.

HP isn't a bank or the IRS, that's not a question that he can legally 
ask and expect an answer to.

That's letting him off easy.  I would have at least listened to what 
he had to say to that, if only for entertainment purposes, and if it 
wasn't getting anywhere closer to getting that transaction processed, 
I would have tried to get a general manager, and failing that, 
calling back in a few minutes to get a non-dork on the phone.

Well, you can reverse the charge, but be prepared to get growled at by 
the teller (it's a bureaucratic pain in the ass) and alienate the 
vendor (though if you're reversing a charge, odds are the vendor's 
already burned their bridges with you).

You attribute to malice what can be readily explained by stupidity.

No, his job was to make me angry enough to tell him to shove it so I 
would cancel the order. I am flagged in their system not to sell me a 
computer. This is because I already returned one under their 30-day 
return policy. There is no other possibility that makes any sense at all.

Exactly. When I told my bank branch manager that he asked me for my 
social security number she visibly blanched.

At the time I had not yet figured out that his purpose was to get me to 
cancel the order. I'm sure they didn't dare put my status as "blocked" 
in the screen that the phone sales people use. So the phone sales people 
innocently take my order, and his job is to get rid of it.

In retrospect it might have been amusing had I mentioned that I was a 
member of the local black community and given him my Oregon State Bar 
number. OK, I am neither black nor a lawyer, but he doesn't know that. :)

The charge actually never went through. The card department authorized 
the charge, but HP never sent it through. I just wanted them to block 
any charges from HP. They had the coding from the previous charge (the 
computer I returned), so I guess it wasn't that tough to do.

No one could be as stupid as he is. That crap had to be made up for a 
purpose.

Exactly. But I hate touchpads too. One of the features I really loved 
about the Compaq was the on-off switch for the touchpad. You want it on 
when installing Linux, so it will be recognized. But then I turn it off 
and use my little USB wireless optical Logitech. I'd want it only in 
case the batteries go dead on me in the USB mousie.

On a happier note, I just discovered a place that has R3340s 
"refurbished and open box" for $800. That's the one I was trying to pay 
HP $1,149 for, refurbished. They'll be open tomorrow morning. Maybe I'll 
end up with an R3000 after all. God knows I've worked hard enough at 
buying one.

My PowerBook G4 runs OS X, and I've never, ever seen such superb 
integration of an OS with a laptop. The power management, peripheral 
detection, networking -- they're seemlessly managed by OS X.

On the other hand, package upkeep and management on the Unix side of 
OS X is far behind that offered by any recent Linux distribution I've 
used. You'll need to rely on non-Apple package management. From what 
I've seen, fink is NOT the way to go; the packages I've examined have 
often been outdated. I'd like to test Portage for Darwin, but I 
haven't had the time.

Still, Apple's laptops are great. It's hard to overstate how well they 
just work.

Actually, the four letter sequence "this" appears in many places in my
will.  I assume Ed is be referring to some antecedent phrase, which he
neglected to define.  

I am guessing that by "this", Ed is referring not to my whole posting,
suggesting one example of a secure key escrow mechanism, but to some
kind of actual expression of my private encryption key, in my will
document, mediated by my non-technical lawyer.  However, since wills
are typically maintained as unencrypted text editor documents on
insecure desktop computers, printed in multiple copies, and kept on
file in the county of residence during probate (available for public
scrutiny),  that guess describes a silly way to go about things.

Perhaps Ed's unclear reference to "this" refers to some other part
of my posting, and I hope he can concretely identify that for me
so I can make some sense of his statement.


Rich's reply, suggesting I just keep my open source projects on an
unencrypted disk, misses the point.  People typically keep lots of
things on a single disk, and some more paranoid folk may apply
encryption to their whole disk (as JW did).  I do not myself, now,
but will do so if security threats increase.  CVS aside, important
information on my disks *is* encrypted, and some of that information
should be available to my wife, friends or certain others upon my
demise.  A key escrow mechanism, shared with knowledgeable friends,
would help.

Now it might be that most people don't give a shit what happens to
others after they pass away, perhaps because there is nobody who 
cares about them or the information they maintain.  But the open
source community contains some very generous and empathetic people,
not just social misfit code jockeys, and it is that empathy I am
attempting to engage here.  What are we going to do to protect our
data, yet make it potentially accessable to those we care about?

Subject: [PLUG] Grub with a new kernel
Message-ID: <200505290939.01693.michael.harrisdmd@comcast.net>

Hello all,


   I decided to try a 2.6.11 kernel on my Debian Sarge distribution.  I went 
through the steps outlined in Carla's "Linux Cookbook".  There was one 
problem in that I don't have QT so I couldn't use xconfig or something like 
that.  Anyway, I ended up using a configuration tool and compiled the kernel.  
Now I am trying to load it to my boot loader (GRUB), which I have done.  When 
I booted I got a kernel panic.  I can not remember exactly what it said at 
this moment, but it had something to do with adding a proper 'root' 
reference.  So, here is the edited part of my grub menu.lst file.  Which root 
needs to be changed?  Or how do I figure out which one to change?  I am 
assuming there is no initrd.img for this kernel.

How about you define precisely the problem you are trying to solve
over on plug-talk.  It sounds like an "it hurts when I do that" kind
of problem, to which the answer comes pat: "so don't do that".

Yup, you need to 'mkinitrd...' with the proper options.

On my system, if I just run mkinitrd without any options, it gives me a
command line example for the currently running kernel, and that's easy
enough to go by to figure it out.

After making the initrd, add it to your grub stanza for that kernel.

Depending on how Michael built the kernel, it might or might not even
need an initrd.  The exact message would be helpful. 

I don't have Carla's book, so I don't know what instructions she
provides, but a few things occur to me:

  a) "make menuconfig" works for configuring a kernel build without X.
     It is what I usually use, even with X.

  b) did you remember to "make install" and "make modules_install"?

  c) I notice your debian kernel is a 2.4.x.  Have you installed the
     module utilities for 2.6.x?  They changed.  apt-get the
     "module-init-tools" package.

Yeah, it is a 15" Powerbook. The built-in Broadcom wireless doesn't 
work, but that's true for non-PPC also. I put an Orinoco in the PCMCIA 
slot. I've never tried the modem. Everything else is hunky-dory.

I'd much rather have a somewhat lightweight laptop and non-seared thighs 
than a 42 metric ton, 5.2 ?berHz "laptop".

Fedora Core 4 (due out RSN) will feature PPC as a 1st-tier platform also.

Keith is making perfect sense to me...

It's the nature of life today that many of us (myself included)
necessarily keep important things encrypted.  We don't want other people
to have access to these things.  Think of encrypted files as a
more-secure safety deposit box at the local bank (banks still do have
these somewhere, right?).  We put important documents in the magic
little box that keeps everybody else out.

Some of these important things are things that need to be released upon
death to close relatives, friends, and collegues.  For instance, I'd
want my GoDaddy password to be given to Alan Hicks if I died, because I
own the Slackbook domain and he's the Slackbook maintainer.  I'd like
him to be able to transfer the domain to himself without such hassle if
I pass away.

Does this make sense so far?

Keith is trying to come up with a mechanism to allow information like
that to be released upon death... what if I get hit by a bus tomorrow
(quite unlikely, we don't have busses down here)?  What mechanism might
allow Alan access to my password?

I like the idea of trusting a few close friends with bits of the puzzle,
so only working together could they unlock the data... trusting a
majority wouldn't be comprimised or decide to comprimise things
themselves.  However, I wonder if there's a better way.

Keith was, I believe, trying to get some constructive discussion going.
 How do we solve the problem?

I must agree entrusting the entire puzzle to a lawyer who likely doesn't
understand the concepts behind it is not a viable solution.

My two cents.

Do people still use those X thingies?  I couldn't imagine using anything

make install?

Where does it put the kernel?  What does it name it?  What does it do if
a kernel is already there with that name?  These are all questions I
would rather not leave up to the kernel developers.... I just manually
copy arch/i386/boot/bzImage to where I want it, then modify grub or lilo
to see it there.

Do people actually regularly use make install on a kernel?

Y'know, for being a LUG list, we sure don't have a lot of kernel
compilation questions.

make install is actually left up to the distribution, not the kernel 
developers.  I've never actually looked at the Makefile, but it seems 
there's a sorta "standard" install script somewhere on the distribution 
that make install calls, which in turn does the actual install.  As an 
example, I regularly compile custom kernels on both RedHat/Fedora 
systems and SuSE systems.  The installation is different for each, but 
they both end up creating an initrd and putting the files in /boot for 
you.  make install won't even work on an ia64 machine (target not 
found).  Didn't work for me on Yellowdog either, but I'm not really a 
PPC person.

Yes, but I wouldn't put every piece of paper that I own in a safe 
deposit box. Just the important documents. I certainly wouldn't put the 
source code for an Open Source project there, unless it was an offsite 
backup for DR purposes. I would not do it to keep that document secret.

And I would have plans in place in advance for how the people who would 
need access to those important documents in the safe deposit box would 
get to them. That is not exactly a new concept.

Putting your encryption key inside of a safe deposit box with 
instructions for who should have access to it if you passed would 
actually be one way to handle the scenario Keith mentions.

It seems again that there are easier solutions for this. Like moving the 
name to a separate account and sharing the password with him.

And what if one of the 8 people who has a piece of your encryption key 
loses it?

You guys are obviously free to pursue this if you want to, but I just 
feel like you are making things much more complicated than they need to be.

If the data is not something that needs to be encrypted, like a CVS tree 
for an Open Source project, then I just would not encrypt it. I think 
people who are working on an Open Source project together should make 
sure their data is shared, not kept secret. If there is only one copy on 
someone's encrypted hard drive, then that's a problem if the drive fails 
too. You should certainly have some sort of DR plan involving offsite 
backups from wherever the CVS server is.

In Keith's followup he makes it sound like he is concerned about more 
personal data. If you can't trust a friend or family member enough to 
give them some sort of access to that, even access where they at least 
need to jump through some hoops first (like through a lawyer), then I'm 
not sure what to tell you. Frankly I would trust my own family members 
with the key to retrieve information that I needed to encrypt more than 
I would people that I know through PLUG. Nothing personal, I've met some 
great people through the group, but if the info is important enough to 
encrypt it I would want to entrust that to someone closer to me.

If you do want to break up your encryption key and give pieces of it to 
several people, then by all means do. That should be pretty easy for 
anyone who is familiar with their encryption software to do, I'm not 
sure why that needs the participation of PLUG somehow.

And Keith, someone who disagrees about the need for what you propose is 
not necessarily lacking empathy or compassion, that suggestion seems to 
be a bit of a low blow.

./Makefile names the kernel using $VERSION, $PATCHLEVEL, $SUBLEVEL and
$EXTRAVERSION.  If you want to maintain more distinction than the
defaults, the $EXTRAVERSION is probably what you want to modify.

"make install" ultimately calls, e.g.:

  $ sh /aux2/src/linux-2.6.11/arch/i386/boot/install.sh 2.6.11.7 arch/i386/boot/bzImage System.map ""

which, in turn, calls:

  ~/bin/installkernel 

or 

  /sbin/installkernel

if they exist.  Otherwise, it moves existing vmlinuz and System.map to
.old and plops the new ones down.

Debian's default /sbin/installkernel puts vmlinuz-x.y.z.extra
System.map-x.y.z.extra and config-x.y.z.extra in /boot, points
nonversion'd symlinks at them and then calls mkboot which does the
right thing for LILO, ELILO, Grub, etc.  In the case of Grub, it is
just a reminder to edit your /boot/grub/menu.lst.

AthlonRob> Do people actually regularly use make install on a kernel?

Yes.  I do anyway.

Maybe for you.  I am still not skilled enough to know which options to use,

Will I have to change my apt sources?  I think so since my distribution is

Keith responds:
Rich, you have surely heard of encrypted file systems?  While I do not
consider them justified by present security threats, other people I
respect do.  It makes no sense to finely divide information into 
"secure" and "insecure", when the same security process can be spread
over all the data.  Portions of that data may be publically accessable,
like 4 of the Wikis and 2 of the Subversion trees on my server.  Other
portions are much more tightly secured.  It is good general practice to
forbid all access, then open specific holes for access to some things.
That is the way I tried to design my server.  This makes most of the
data, and the underlying structure, inaccessable without the magic keys.

Now, pretend I get hit by a bus - or I'm visiting Athlon Rob, and I'm
hit by a log truck or tractor.  My wife is smart enough to spend two
years learning to be a sysadmin and run my servers after me, but
chances are she has a few other things to worry about.  What happens
with my computers?  My offsite colo?  Who moderates the mailing
lists?  Who does what I used to do?  At very bare minimum, who does
she trust to transition the systems and data to other maintainers? 
She, at least, has met some of you folks.  But which of you should
she trust, and how should she decide that?

Spending some time coming up with a scalable and tested solution,
rather than a few ad-hoc measures, might go a long way to help her
or others faced with a terrible loss and a lack of technical skill.
Some of you fellows are young, and have not seen very many of these
tragedies yet.  My wife and I have helped enough widows and others
through disasters to know that ad hoc solutions can cause a lot of
unnecessary grief.

The way these things work is to divide the puzzle up so that, say, 5

are known techniques for this, suitable for any M out of N requirement.
It is precisely because people move around and situations change that
I would like to design a less ad hoc structure.  

I could appoint a "technical executor" in my will, and keep that person
apprised of my current situation, keys, whatever.  But, I am in the
midst of being executor for my mother's estate, and even that well
trodden path is fraught with surprises, even though we spent hundreds
of hours preparing before she passed away.  A few of my friends have
been executors for the estates of other technical friends, and technology
adds a whole level of complication and surprises that is very hard to
predict in detail before the fact.  This stuff does not become simple
simply by unthinkingly labelling it so.  

This is why I would like to work with a group of similarly concerned
individuals to design such a process, systematically.  More heads are
better than fewer, and when the process is tested, it will improve as
the survivors gain experience.  More people involved means more
experience, faster.  Careless motorcyclists and 90yo's welcome! :-)

Keith writes:
You are conflating trustworthiness, interest, judgement, and capability.   
My wife is trustworthy, but her technical judgement, interest, and
capability are all low.  She runs Linux (yay!), but I handle the
security details for her ("Time to think up a new password, sweetheart!"
"Again?  But we did that last year, honey").  She can read a 600 page
medical text, but balks at a man page.  I have stopped her from sending
out mailings to groups with everyone CC'd instead of BCC'd.  I have
helped her choose good passwords.  She will need technical help after
I am gone, and she won't find it in the phone book. 

In our case, we have socialized with enough PLUG folk that she knows
people that can help with personal disaster recovery.  But will she
use them, rather than, say, my Windoze-zealot lawyer brother-in-law? 
These things are best decided in advance, formally, and given that
any particular person I appoint as a technical successor could move
or otherwise be unavailable, I would prefer to appoint a trustworthy,
picked group.

Now, try to put all the language for that in a will.  Ever seen an
attorney write a will?  They typically start with something called
the "West Law CD" and crib 12 pages of text.  Then they start writing
their own stuff, based on poorly remembered bits of law school 
lectures, and often at odds with the laws currently on the books.
I am currently straightening out one such mess, and it will probably
cost $5K and a couple of court appearances to fix.  And that is for
a simple special needs trust, well described in the literature.  Five
minutes with a magazine article or a web page, and my mother's bozo
lawyer could have written a better will.  What would these guys know
about moving DNS registrations, or securing access to a colo machine,
or splitting off open source projects to trusted lieutenants?  There
are a small handful of technically competent lawyers out there, and
they typically don't write wills.

I'd say you need to open the kernel config in menuconfig again and
do the following:

     - Drill down to this menu level: Device Drivers > Block Devices

     - Have a look at this setting: RAM Disk Support.

I use no initrd image and haven't for a long time.  This setting is
turned off for me.  This is on a 2.6.11.6 kernel (shamefully out of
date).  Reading the help for this setting, it isn't clear whether it
is still important to turn off in the case of initrd-less boot.  In
the 2.4 days, there were similarly named settings that did matter.

I looked through the whole menuconfig and I see nothing else that
would pertain.  Initramfs Source Files is somewhat related but not close
enough to count.

Your original question - "What's wrong with my root?" - is best
answered if we knew what your partitions looked like.  But if we
assume the other 2 boot options work, that's not a real issue here.

Does this new kernel know how to read your hard drive without initrd
support?  You need IDE, SATA or SCSI drivers.  Look at Device Drivers
> Block Devices > ATA/ATAPI/MFM/RLL support > Include IDE/ATA-2 DISK
support (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDISK).  Make sure it is turned on and the
appropriate chipset options are turned on too.

It's gotta be something that was compiled as a module in your old
kernel that is needed to read the hard drive, dontcha think?  Make
sure you change "M"s to "*"s in this area of the kernel config.

Actually, there aren't many log trucks down here and the tractors move
slow enough you could probably stay out of their way.

It's the pickups you need to watch out for.  They can be crazy.

What kind of end result were you looking for?  A protocol?  An
application to make it easier to set this up?

I would be interested in what comes of this (and helping come up with
it, time permitting) - so feel free to include me in your list of those
interested in helping figure it out - whatever it ends up being.

I have quite a bit of experience in such domains, where one company 
went through no less than 8 master "root" employees (as they were 
considered, a CTO, VP of IT, various SysAds, etc.) in 3 years. Some 
left on good terms, others were escorted from the building while a 
cascade of decryption and password changing routines occurred in the 
background (we had it down to five minutes of shifting and transfer 
when I finally left). I'm also the designated executor/guardian for a 
number of complex situations in my family, ranging from living wills to 
hidden monetary sources to child custody. There's certainly a lot to 
consider.

In addition to the minimal amount of tech involved, the really heavy 
lifting is more about establishing policy. Sure, having passwords and 
encryption keys stored in a trusted place (say, a safety deposit box or 
whatever) is a start, but the real challenges are about *who* gets 
access, *how* they get access, *when* they get access, and *what* they 
are supposed to do with that access.

Some lessons learned so far:
1) There should always be at *least* two *trained* people who have 
potential access to every different permission, every different key, 
every different secret. If one person out of two is removed because of 
death, illness, termination of employment (etc.), then another person 
should be *immediately* trained and granted access to maintain the bare 
minimum of two.
2) A caveat to the above: Some things are supposed to be permanently 
"secret", in which case, only one person knowing is acceptable, 
provided that such information or tasks being permanently lost is 
acceptable.
3) The pairs (and/or groups or chains) of "trusted access" should be 
known to the others involved and designated ahead of time. In a 
corporate network, this can be a previously designated SysAdmin taking 
over for the CTO's secrets, and in a personal situation, this would be 
(in my case, for example, referring to my tech work) one of two 
existing "failover Rons" taking responsibility (both are long-term 
friends, both are guru level *nix folks, and both are known to my 
friends and family).
4) Regular rehearsals are pretty much mandatory, to iron out any bugs 
in the policy (and the tech). This is where I've seen things get the 
stickiest, because it's one step people often don't go through (often 
for comfort reasons). Sure, you can say "well, Keith will just take 
over the account", but unless that transition is actually rehearsed a 
few times, *and* kept up to date, folks get into all sorts of snarls. 
Just like in all other forms of disaster recovery, simulating the 
disaster exposes most of the existing flaws.
5) Document *everything*. Under stressful situations, it's far too easy 
to forget what the designated procedures were. The last living will 
"event" in my family was getting pretty ugly, until we went back to 
"the written policy portion" (the living will itself) to re-conform to 
procedure.

Out of the above, some other policies grew. For example, if there are 
only two established and trained root users (be that "root" for a 
machine, a bank account, or even a deed to a house), the two should 
never travel together in the same plane, or otherwise risk a 
catastrophic dual-loss. For some secrets, *every* stakeholder knows 
ahead of time who will assume authority and responsibility, but for 
other secrets, several people are trained for the task, and the actual 
fail over person is unknown until the event itself (such as items kept 
secret in a will, for example). One fairly difficult event involved the 
custody of the documentation itself, as someone was attempting to 
subvert procedure by keeping the procedures themselves unknown.

Well... depending on the task involved, appointing a vague group can 
*cause* more headaches than designating a specific chain. Simply look 
at the squabbling of a family without a will, where the children fight 
for control of assets. In the corporate world, similar infighting 
occurs over power and authority. IME, it's far better to have a 
regularly updated "chain" of rehearsed succession.

How do I change the M's to *?  I am fairly new to this entire process and was 
doing it just to see if I could.   It is all a learning process to me.

This is controlled by the makefile and is actually quite simple to 
configure. Both the install location and the filename. I generally add 
my initials and a serial number to the end of the name it's already 
configured for.

For instance, I installed the source for my mandriva 2005LE 
installation, made some changes, and compiled kernel 2.6.11-6mdk-rlj-1 
for my laptop.

Can't speak for others, but I do when I need to use a custom kernel.

By this, I mean to change a config option from "compiled as a kernel
module" to "compiled into the kernel itself".  In the ncurses-based
menuconfig program (launched by "make menuconfig"), options that are
set to compile as modules have an "M" by them, and pressing "M" is how
you'd set an option to be compiled that way.  What you want to do is
find the appropriate IDE/ATA/SCSI options and hit "Y" by them, thereby
placing a "*" next to them as a visual indicator that they will be
compiled into the bzImage itself.

The appropriate options can be found by running "lspci" and seeing
what your hardware looks like.  For instance, lspci on my Dell
Inspiron 8200 laptop gives me this:

The line I care about if I'm interested in the IDE bus is:

0000:00:1f.1 IDE interface: Intel Corp. 82801CAM IDE U100 (rev 02)

With this info (and the knowledge that I have a CD and a floppy

You'll notice that everything that has to do with the IDE bus is
marked with "<*>".  That's how the kernel can read the hard drive
without needing any modules found in an initrd image.

Of course I have. And I know that having an encrypted filesystem does 
not mean that you can't also have other filesystems which are not encrypted.

Again, if we're talking about an Open Source project, the fact that your 
encrypted filesystem is the only decent copy of the data for the project 
is a problem even from a DR perspective.

Those are all things you would certainly want to arrange in advance, so 
she wouldn't need to decide. You would want to have all of that spelled 
out in your will. If you haven't done that then you definitely should.

By all means go for it. I'm not sure the PLUG list is the best place to 
work out the details of that, perhaps you could set up a dedicated list 
for your project and notify people here how to join if they wish.

I didn't think it was directed at me individually, but you did say, "Now 
it might be that most people don't give a shit what happens to others 
after they pass away..."

I don't know why you would say that. I'm guessing that most people here 
do give a shit, but you seemed to imply that those who were not eager to 
join in your project fit that category. I think that was a bit of a 
cheap shot and in poor taste. Someone can be empathetic and have 
compassion and still think you are making what should be a fairly simple 
issue more complex than it needs to be.

If you are talking about an Open Source project, make sure to share your 
data with your team members and keep offsite backups. If you are talking 
about personal data, definitely make arrangements for the people who 
need access to it to be able to recover it. If you think the best way to 
do that is to share pieces of your keys with other people then do that. 
It's not exactly a new concept, as you mentioned.

Hmmm, yes I remember the menuconfig from a previous distribution.  I am 
currently stuck using xconfig, but I am working on how to get menuconfig 
installed here.

In the Linux Cookbook, it mentions that I will need QT for menuconfig.  I 
couldn't make menuconfig so I assumed I was missing something.  I noticed in 
my Gnome apt manager tool, that I could get the Qt development libraries if I 
selected a 2.6.8 kernel, so I did that, but have not done anything else with 
it.  I am assuming if I go through the same motions I will be able to make 
menuconfig.  Then maybe move up to the 2.6.11 kernel.  Actually, I was only 
after the 2.6 kernel because I heard it handles usb devices that attach 
memory cards and such.

By the way, how would I go about getting the module-init-tools using apt-get?

My current settings and apt-sources are set to keep my Debian Sarge up to 
date.

Thanks again,

Mike

I don't know who Sarge is.  Sarge is a code name and I refused to sign
the NDA, so they won't tell me ;-).  On a "stable" box,
module-init-tools isn't available.  On a "testing" box,
module-init-tools is available.  

  # apt-get install module-init-tools

You can have both the old and new module tools (modutils) installed at
the same time.

Oops.  Clarity is enhanced thusly:

  You can have both the old (modutils) and new (module-init-tools)

make menuconfig requires the ncurses libraries, but should not require 
any X libraries or toolkits (like QT), as it is for command-line based 
menus (which is what ncurses does).

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0505310713430.7911@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   This is strange. I upgraded my main workstation/server from Slackware-10.0
to -10.1 and pine was upgraded, too. I specify an alternate editor for pine
(/usr/bin/joe), but now I have black text (fg) on a white background whereas
before it was reversed; I prefer it that way. And, I have no cursor in the
header when I start to compose a message.

   None of this happened before and I have not discovered where I change
things. It does not appear to be in ~/.pinerc.

   Any and all ideas -- other than "switch to ..." -- are appreciated.

Thanks,

Rich

Michael, you can install Gentoo with binaries, but we were referring to 
building it from source.

I agree it would be slow to build, especially on a Pentium. You would 
want to keep the system as stripped down as possible to help speed that up.

Subject: [PLUG] mailman and spamassassin
Message-ID: <20050531173531.GB13324@gate.kl-ic.com>


I run a few Mailman groups set up for subscriber-only posting.
That means that any incoming spam gets sent to the moderator (me)
for approval or discard.  In the past, this has not been a problem,
with all the other checks that are in place.

However, the spams are starting to sneak through, and some time in
the future I may have to add filtering so I am not bombarded with 
moderator messages.  I would like to filter the moderator requests
only;  mail from legitimate subscribers should go through unhindered.

I know how to add spamassassin as a procmail prefilter for Mailman;
is there some clever way to use it on moderator requests only?  Since
the filtering needs to occur inside Mailman, and since there are plenty
of legitimate mails that should pass through to the moderator, I imagine
the answer is "no".  However, there are some smart people here...

I can't recommend them yet, but I will note them as I'm going to be
obtaining some dedicated server hosting from them.

Green IT is a part of my businesses mission, so having dedicated 
servers solar powered is a requirement.  Your requirements may be 
different.

You may also want to check with:

Ask about the MySQL, because my memory is fuzzy on it.
However, otherwise, they are local, including tech support, and they are 
reasonably priced. I've been a customer for years and have my own web 
site Virtually hosted through them. I can highly recommend them.

Message-ID: <429CB3EA.6050304@dimstar.net>

I've been searching the usual places (freshmeat, google, etc) but I'm 
not finding anything that meets all my requirements. If someone out 
there knows of something that does, I'm all ears (eyes). :)

What I'm looking for is something that will mostly replace a 
yahoo-groups discussion board. The must have features of the message 
area are:

*   Web based access for posting, reading, and moderating.
*   Email based access for posting, and reading.
*   User selectable choice of delivery. (Web or email)
*   Access level restrictions. Anonymous at one level, new users at 
another, verified at a third, and so on.

I've found web based forums (e.g. phpbb2) which offer email notification 
of replies, and I've found mailing list software (e.g. Mailman) that 
does web archiving. Nothing seems to do both, at the same time.

Or, at least, I haven't been able to find it in any documentation.

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance!

Russ

Moderator requests are basically personal email, right?  Me, I filter
out mailing-list traffic with procmail, then run SA only on personal
emails.  (Mail server is a UML session *barely* powerful enough to run SA.)
I first flag, then filter spam like so:
	:0fw: spamassassin.lock
	* < 256000
	| spamassassin
 
	:0:
	* ^X-Spam-Status:.Yes
	spam.sa/

If your moderator requests are being jumbled in with the regular list
traffic, you'll have to explain to procmail that they're actually not.
Or you could do something like the above, earlier in your .procmailrc,
with a filter to apply it only to moderator messages.

Oh, and good on yer for moderating a list.  It's a lot of work, and
it's never appreciated enough by the many beneficiaries.

Seems to me that the only thing you want that Mailman doesn't have is the 
posting via web and that's a fairly small hack.  Hell, someone might have 
already done it.

Group,

I have put into /etc/fstab the line:

//server/datashare  /share smbfs   username=guest,rw  0 0

While this does mount the volume, the result is that non-root accounts do
not have read/write access.

Read/write access for non-root is present if mounted manually using the
command:

smbmount //server/datashare /share rw -o guest


So what did I miss ?

Bill,

   I may (once again) be totally incorrect, but most filesystems mount with
"user", not "username=guest". I wonder if the latter is a winduhs dialect
and the former a linux dialect.

   Here are two lines from /etc/fstab on this host:

Richard,

Tried that, no help.  The problem is two fold,
  1.  The "username=guest" is a documented smbmount option to suppress the
password requirement.  E.g. when I mount using a "mount -a"
  2.  The "rw" needs to be extended past root.  The "guest" designation is
supposed to do this.  Leaving it out the smbmount is done with the user as
"root". 

There must be a special form for these arguments in /etc/fstab, but I have
not found them in the documentation.

Bill,

   I may (once again) be totally incorrect, but most filesystems mount with
"user", not "username=guest". I wonder if the latter is a winduhs dialect
and the former a linux dialect.

   Here are two lines from /etc/fstab on this host:

/dev/cdrom       /mnt/cdrom       iso9660     noauto,users,ro  0   0
/dev/fd0         /mnt/floppy      auto        noauto,users     0   0

The trouble with samba is that it is designed to be mounted and used by 
one user per system (e.g. as is the case in some single-user OS.)  
Thus, the user that mounts the share will own everything on it, and the 
username that it is mounted as will own everything that you create 
while it's mounted.

I always mount my samba shares under my home directory.  If you want 
multiple users using a samba share, either you need to mount multiple 
times (preferred), or chmod 777 everything on the share (or do 
something fun with groups.)

What are the permissions on /share?  Who are the user and group? What are
the permissions of //server/datashare on the Windows system?  Is there a 
guest id ( with no password ) on the Windows system?

So after all those questions I'll supply some settings that ahve worked 
for me ( YMMV ).

in /etc/fstab

//server/datashare /mount/point smbfs credentials=/etc/samba/datashare,port=44

in /etc/samba/datashare

username=joeblow
password=xyzzy

/mount/point is joeblow:joeblow ug=rwx

The documentation indicates you may be able to set the group on
/mount/point to "users" and put all your users in that group and add an
option the gid=users to the fstab entry.

Subject: [PLUG] mdadm raid1 creation stomped on jfs superblock?
Message-ID: <86ll5vrnnr.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


In the process of recovering my rsync snapshots, I ended up with a
surplus of 200 gig disks.  My intention is to build a raid1 array to
store one of the snapshot trees with two extra disks.  I had hoped to
take an existing filesystem (and a dd'd copy) and transform it into a
raid1 array.  I did the "mdadm --create" [1] and mounted it read-only
with no hiccups.  However, when I boot, I get this message during the
fsck:

   The current drive is:  /dev/md1

   Superblock is corrupt and cannot be repaired
   since both primary and secondary copies are corrupt.

     CANNOT CONTINUE

   fsck failed.  Please repair manually.

I assume [??] this is because mdadm stomped on jfs somehow that jfs
doesn't like[2].  Do I have to re-mkfs and then rebuild the snapshot
tree from another backup or is there something simpler I can do?  I'd
ordinarily have done it in the Right Order[tm], but building the
snapshot trees is tedious.  Hell, just dd'ing disk to disk takes about
3 hours.  Clues?

Thanks!

[1] Like so:

    # mdadm --create /dev/md1 --auto=yes --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/hdm1 /dev/hdp1

[2] Strace'ing the fsck.jfs, I see to looking at two locations (32768
    and 61440) and doing 4k reads immediately prior to the "is
    corrupt" message.

In fact the two forms are not equivalent in practice.
The manual smbmount as root allows all users write access.

Couple of quasi-random ideas.  First, change the owner/group of the
mount point, BEFORE mounting it, to the user as whom you'll be accessing
the mount.  I've had problems where I couldn't write to the mount as a
normal user even when ls showed me as that owner of writable files, and
I had to umount, chmod the mount point to myself and then remount it. 
Samba's paranoid in that respect.

Second, try playing with the gid and uid options in fstab.

Bill,

   The only person who can modify or delete files in /share is root. You need
to give the world/others write permissions to the directory and its files.

   "... If a directory has read permission you can see what files are in the
directory (using the ls command without arguments or options), write
permission to a directory means you can add, remove or rename files in the
directory (providing you have the permission to cd into that directory).
Execute permission (also called the "search bit") allow you to use the
directory name when accessing files inside that directory (to cd into the
directory)."

I've had trouble using that SHARE mode from linux clients.  Without
knowing samba very well, I've had to resolve it by using the USER
security mode and sticking with real users.

At this point you can pretty much kiss your filesystem goodbye. Raid
takes up a bit of space at the beginning of the partition, for raid
superblocks, so your filesystem is hosed.

The proper procedure for converting a filesystem to a mirror raid is this:

1) Say, you have /dev/hda1 and you want to make it a mirror with
/dev/hdb1. You create the RAID in degraded mode,

mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/hdb1 missing

2) Now you create filesystem on /dev/md0, you will notice that its
size is slightly less than what you have on hda1.

3) Copy data from hda1 to md0.

4) Change partition type of hda1 to fd and hotadd it to the array:
mdadm --add /dev/md0 /dev/hda1
The array will reconstruct.

The above procedure suggests your only chance to recover the data:

1) Stop the array
2) Try to mount one disk, preferably the original, as the separate
filesystem. If that fails, try to fsck it.
3) If this works, you're in luck, do the steps above. If it fails,
you're hosed. The success will depend on what exactly jfs stores in
the first few bytes and whether fsck can reconstruct it.

I don't have any idea, I don't use joe. I would be very surprised if 
this had to do with X though. The fact that you're using pine through an 
xterm shouldn't really matter.

One question qould be whether you see those same colors if you edit a 
text file in joe, outside of pine.

You might also ask on the Slackware list, other users may have run into 
it doing the same upgrade.

   Could be. Then again, checkinstall kept seg faulting on me in 10.0 and no
one else can replicate the problem. Sigh. Nothin' like bein' unique, eh? :-)

Thanks, Rich,

   Well, one down and one to go. I added the rxvt switch '-cr' for (cursor
color) to the invoking command line. I now have a red cursor (wheat's a
little too pinkish now) in both the header and in the xterm running joe. I
think I'll add explicit -fg and -bg colors and see if that fixes things.
Could also try the -rv for reverse video.

   Interesting how the switches for rxvt apply to xterms, too. Well, at least
the one switch.

Rich,

You might try using an .Xdefaults file in your home directory.
Examining and old one I have there is the pertinate section:

*xterm*Font: 9x15
*xterm*background: black
*xterm*borderColor: blue
*xterm*cursorColor: red
*xterm*foreground: white
*xterm*loginShell: true
*xterm*scrollBar: true
*xterm*saveLines: 150
*xterm*visualBell: false
*xterm*bellVolume: 44
*xterm*bellPitch: 0
*xterm*bellDuration: 55
*xterm*ttyModes:  intr ^? quit ^| erase ^h kill ^g eof ^d eol ^` start ^q
stop ^s susp ^~ swtch ^`

The foreground and background lines are the equivalent of the -fg and -bg
command line switches.  The .Xdefaults file resides in your home directory,
thus you could have a differing background color for each login if you
wanted.

If you want more detail on the keywords used, it should be in the help for
xterm.

What do you mean by "copy" there?

I've got a separate dd'd copy of the filesystem (prior to the mdadm
munging).  So, if copy has its ordinary meaning, then I probably
should just mkfs fresh on /dev/md1 and do the copy from my good
version.

Interestingly, I can mount the filesystem on /dev/md1 and seemingly
traverse (e.g. with du) the trees without apparent (so far) error.  I
wonder precisely what was hosed in the superblock?  Whatever it is, it
doesn't seem (heh, in the short-term) that important!

Let me chime in here. You can install *most* of the Gentoo Reference
Platform from binaries on an i386. You can also install *most* of the
Gentoo Reference Platform from binaries on an i686, athlon-xp, pentium3
or pentium4. *However*, some of the initial packages in the install do
get compiled -- they're fairly small.

In addition, your *updates* will be recompiled; as far as I know there's
no binary package repository. If you need regular updates and can't
handle the compile times, you might be better off with Debian. Sarge is
coming out in a couple of weeks, and they've got something like 16,000
packages to choose from. Gentoo is close to 10,000, but again, anything
that isn't in the Gentoo Reference Package will need to be recompiled.

Bill,

   I have one of those, too. I think the problem is that Olivier changes
where Xfce looks for configuration information too often. Even within
version 4, it changed from ~/.xfce4 in version 4.0.2 to ~/.config/xfce4 in
version 4.2.1. I don't know if .Xdefaults is being read any more.

   My copy contains information on aterms, eterms, and rxvts as well as
xterms. But, I did not think of looking there as I grappled with finding a
solution. Thanks for the reminder.

Hmm.  Interestingly, verbosity gives me:

  # fsck -v /dev/md1
  fsck 1.37 (21-Mar-2005)
  fsck.jfs version 1.1.7, 22-Jul-2004
  processing started: 5/31/2005 21.3.4

  FSCK  Device /dev/md1 is currently mounted READ ONLY.
  Using default parameter: -p
  The current device is:  /dev/md1
  Open(...READ/WRITE EXCLUSIVE...) returned rc = 0
  Incorrect jlog length detected in the superblock (P).
  Incorrect jlog length detected in the superblock (S).
  Superblock is corrupt and cannot be repaired 
  since both primary and secondary copies are corrupt.  

   CANNOT CONTINUE.

Looking at the jfsutils source code, it is failing a test:

   [...]
   agg_blks_in_aggreg += jlog_length_from_pxd;
   if (agg_blks_in_aggreg > agg_blks_on_device) {
     [...]

Maybe I'll fling a message into the jfs mailing lists and see what
comes back.

That's what I thought.  

With these rsync snapshots, in order to keep the hardlink data from
exploding (there are a *lot* of hard links!), you need to essentially
replay the snapshot creations, which is easy enough.  You build a
script and then play the script and everything gets recreated.

Hey Rich.  :-)

.Xdefaults is an X thing, not an Xfce thing.  X (clients?) use it, not
the window manager itself.

BTW, good choice on Xfce, I'm quite impressed with it, myself.

Ah, mdadm manpage indicates that the RAID superblock is actually at
the *end* of the partition rather than the beginning.  Maybe if I can
shrink the jfs appropriately, I'll be okay.  I've got an email in to
the jfs-discussion mailing list.

Hi

I  am trying to set up Multiple Domains with one IP...

I am using apache2...

And I followed the example that come with the doc....

It dosen;t seen to work

For example, suppose that you are serving the domain www.domain.tld and 
you wish to add the virtual host www.otherdomain.tld, which points at 
the same IP address. Then you simply add the following to httpd.conf:

NameVirtualHost *:80

ServerAlias domain.tld *.domain.tld
DocumentRoot /www/domain

<VirtualHost *:80>

Any ideas on how to fix this

Or if you are running apache2  ... How do  you do virtual domains??
