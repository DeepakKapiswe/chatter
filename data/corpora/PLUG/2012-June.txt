Awesome bling factor but alas, Verizon is not a GSM provider.

Thanks anyway!

Michael,

   I bought a spare Treo 700p on eBay for $10 a while ago. Since I rely on
the phone/Palm PDA capabilities it's an ideal phone for me. While it's other
features available, I don't pay Verizon for 'data.'

   Any of the Treos in the 600-700 series will do well.

If you have the file already ripped to AVI or MP4 or something, and you
need subtitles, just download the subtitles file from allsubs.com
(among several other subtitles sources), then use VLC to view the
movie. If the .srt is in the same folder as the .avi, VLC will
automatically play the subtitles. If the .srt is in a different folder
you will have to go to Video > Subtitles > Open File. 

I disrecommend Totem or other video player because they are all idiots
about subtitles, especially Totem.

You have to be careful about downloading the right subtitles for your
movie. Quite often I have a subtitles file and a movie file but the
subtitles are hopelessly out of sync with the movie. Usually this is
because the movie is at 25 fps but the subtitles were created for a
different version of the movie at another fps. 

I watch a lot of ancient European movies and sometimes I can't even
find subtitles. 

Oh, one other tip. If the movie file is MP4 frequently you find that
the subtitles are embedded in the file. In that case (in VLC) just go
to Video > Subtitles and you will see the tracks.

If none of that helps, post back with more specifics.

Also, you have to rename the subtitle file so that it's exactly the
same title as the movie file.  Of course the one name difference will
be the extension.  Watching subtitles in Linux is no different than
other OSes that I've tried.

I suspect the reason for "L.B.U.G." is because so many software
objects are hard to abstract and translate to other languages; if
I see something neat done in language Foo and I am not conversant
in that language, I will probably have to rewrite from scratch in
one of the few languages I am not horrid with.  ++ungood if
language Foo only runs on platforms I don't use.

Still, the Perl/Parrot folks continue to struggle gamely with
making Parrot into the universal runtime engine, perhaps 
permitting me to mashup objects in Perl and Python and F77 and
Cobol and ...  The runtime will probably be inefficient as hell,
but it would be nice if it at least runs - I can always buy
more processors and RAM and kill a few more salmon.  Many of
my tasks are "run once", so object integration efficiency
matters most.

Most of my tasks are simulation, graphics, and mathematical, not
the text/symbol processing that many favor.  I probably have more
in common with game programmers, whatever languages they use -
I'm guessing C, CUDA, etc.  But there's that platform problem. 
Perhaps I ought to track down a few and invite them to give Plug
A.T. talks, and we can get them thinking about cross-platform
compatability.  If we can abstract from the platforms, we can
share ideas better.

You can also try SubDownloader http://www.subdownloader.net/ which will

I have found SubDownloader to be largely useless for me. It has a
drop-down to select the site to search, but it is set by default to
opensubtitles.com, and there are no other choices and no place to type
in an alternate site. Opensubtitles.com is great, but sadly it does not
have all subtitles. As a fan of obscure movies I find I need to employ
the services of Mr. Google to search the entire net. Otherwise,
subdownloader has some nice features that make the process a bit
easier.

Portland Linux/Unix Group Meeting Announcement

Who: Lance Albertson
What: The Ganeti Virtualization Management System
Where: PSU, 1930 SW 4th Ave. Room FAB 86-01 (Lower Level)
When: Thursday, June 7th, 2012 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of awesome, open technologies.

See location H-10 on the PSU map at http://pdxLinux.org/campus_map.jpg

Ganeti is a robust cluster virtualization management software tool. It?s 
built on top of existing virtualization technologies such as Xen and KVM 
and other Open Source software. Its integration with various 
technologies such as DRBD and LVM results in a cheaper High Availability 
infrastructure and linear scaling.

This hands-on tutorial will cover a basic overview of Ganeti, the 
step-by-step install & setup of a single-node and multi-node Ganeti 
cluster, operating the cluster, and some best practices of Ganeti. 
Finally, deploying and using a web-based management tool called Ganeti 
Web Manager.

If you want to participate on the hands-on portion of the talk, feel 
free to clone his vagrant-ganeti repo on github 
(https://github.com/ramereth/vagrant-ganeti) prior to the meeting. We'll 
try and have the box images available on USB drives at the meeting but 
its always great to have everything setup prior to the meeting and not 
saturate the WiFi.


Lance is the Associate Director of Operations for the Oregon State 
University Open Source Lab (OSL) and a Gentoo Linux Developer. He joined 
the Gentoo Linux project in 2003 and have been involved in managing 
their infrastructure and maintaining about a dozen or so packages in 
portage. Lance directs all of the hosting and development activities 
that the OSL provides for the open source community including projects 
such as Kernel.org, Drupal, Apache Software Foundation, and many many 
more. Lance has been at the OSL since 2007.

   I'm having difficulty finding the emacs warning library. I use emacs to
edit large data files and a global replacement exceeds the undo buffer's
size so a small buffer window opens to tell me this happened. The window
also says, "You can disable the popping up of this buffer by adding the
entry (undo discard-info) to the user option `warning-suppress-types', which
is defined in the `warnings' library."

   A Google search for 'emacs warning library location' (and just the first
three words) did not show me where the library is located. Please provide a
pointer for me.

Thanks,

Rich

google-fu is an ever-evolving skill. I did "undo discard-info" and got this:

https://groups.google.com/group/gnu.emacs.help/browse_thread/thread/935968b7d1c1878d?fwc=1&pli=1

I don't know anything about emacs, so I have no idea if the above will
work. if it doesn't, reply back and I'll search some more.

You don't need to find the library, since we know that
'warning-supress-types' is an *option* that you need to *customize*
(emphasis because those terms indicate emacs commands/settings).


M-x customize-option

then enter:

warning-supress-types

And emacs will bring up the customize buffer for
warning-supress-types, where you can add (undo discard-info) to the
list, but it's not the most intuitive interface:

 * Click on State, which should show a menu.
 * choose show saved lisp expression.
 * I *suspect* that you'll have a default value of nil; change that to
((undo discard-info))
 * Click save for future sessions
 * close/disregard the customize buffer.

It's possible that there is one too many levels of parens in there...
if that doesn't work, try setting the value to (undo discard-info)

Try C-h v warning-suppress-type, and see what that tells you.  You
probably do NOT want to be editing emacs libraries.  You just want to
configure something in your .emacs file to tell it to discard the undo
information when you overflow the buffer size.

What version of emacs are you using?

GNU Emacs 23.2.1 says it has a variable called
undo-ask-before-discard, which sounds related.

Or maybe buffer-disable-undo would let you disable undo on the
particular buffer you are working on, without disabling it generally.

C-h a undo will give you more ideas about what's available to tweak.

   Hidden within the thread is how to load the warnings library and add to
it. Whether I've done so correctly is yet to be determined.

Howdy all,

I recently have switched my home line to Comcast and I purchased a
cable modem that supposedly supports ipv6.  In light of world ipv6
day, and the fact that comcast is enabling it for some customers, I
decided to try real quick to get an address with dibbler and a few
other tools, but haven't had any luck.

I don't even know if Comcast has enabled ipv6 in our area or if you
need to opt-in or anything.  Has anyone else tried getting native
dual-stack v6 working in Linux here in the Portland area?

Portland Linux/Unix Group Meeting Announcement

Who: Lance Albertson
What: The Ganeti Virtualization Management System
Where: PSU, 1930 SW 4th Ave. Room FAB 86-01 (Lower Level)
When: Thursday, June 7th, 2012 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of awesome, open technologies.

See location H-10 on the PSU map at http://pdxLinux.org/campus_map.jpg

Ganeti is a robust cluster virtualization management software tool. It?s 
built on top of existing virtualization technologies such as Xen and KVM 
and other Open Source software. Its integration with various 
technologies such as DRBD and LVM results in a cheaper High Availability 
infrastructure and linear scaling.

This hands-on tutorial will cover a basic overview of Ganeti, the 
step-by-step install & setup of a single-node and multi-node Ganeti 
cluster, operating the cluster, and some best practices of Ganeti. 
Finally, deploying and using a web-based management tool called Ganeti 
Web Manager.

If you want to participate on the hands-on portion of the talk, feel 
free to clone his vagrant-ganeti repo on github 
(https://github.com/ramereth/vagrant-ganeti) prior to the meeting. We'll 
try and have the box images available on USB drives at the meeting but 
its always great to have everything setup prior to the meeting and not 
saturate the WiFi.


Lance is the Associate Director of Operations for the Oregon State 
University Open Source Lab (OSL) and a Gentoo Linux Developer. He joined 
the Gentoo Linux project in 2003 and have been involved in managing 
their infrastructure and maintaining about a dozen or so packages in 
portage. Lance directs all of the hosting and development activities 
that the OSL provides for the open source community including projects 
such as Kernel.org, Drupal, Apache Software Foundation, and many many 
more. Lance has been at the OSL since 2007.

Roughly 18 Personal Telco nodes have ipv6 connectivity now, the rest
are coming soon.  We have a Hurricane Electric tunnel with a /48 that
we are parsing up for nodes, each node gets a /64.  Works fine.  I
routinely connect over ipv6. 

Hurrican Electric tunnels are super easy to set up.  Just realize that
wasting gigantic swaths of ipv6 space is *NORMAL*.  It takes some
getting used to.  Your tunnel uses 2 addresses out of a possible 2^64.
You aren't expected to use any more of those.  Just ask for a /48 and
use one of the /64's out of that for your LAN.

My understanding with Comcast is that they had a trial, but the trial
is currently closed.  That may be out-of-date.

I read that they had a trial with 6RD and/or DS-lite and that is
closed.  My understanding is that they are rolling out native v6
slowly to all customers now.  Just about any of the news articles on
the world ipv6 day mentions they are doing this, and of course there
is http://comcast6.net/.

I've run tunnels before and all that.  I just wanted to know if anyone
had tried Comcast's service locally and had already done the research,
resulting in  "yes it's available and here's what I did" or "no, they
haven't enabled it here yet".  Calling Comcast support on anything
remotely technical isn't usually a great use of time, so just wanted
to ask here first.

I'm going to need a new computer pretty soon and was wondering if a tablet
might work for my mobile needs.

Mostly I would need internet access and the ability to handle a spreadsheet
and email.

Sooooo.  Net + Email + Spreadsheet

Are there any tablets out there that would qualify?

I think The Vivaldi Linux tablet would handle all that.

Sounds good, but looks like it is no longer available for order (for now
anyway)...
hopefully they will get it ramped up :)

For something that is available now, my suggestion would be the Asus
Transformer Prime.
It has a removable keyboard/touchpad dock, which basically turns it into a
laptop.  This would be handy for needing to type more than a few words
(long email, spreadsheets), but for just consuming info (net, videos,
music, etc), you can undock and just use the tablet.

This page has a good rundown of the capabilities.

http://www.androidcentral.com/asus-transformer-prime-review

I myself do not have first hand experience with it, except a few minutes
here and there.

I have a Viewsonic GTablet, got it during a Woot sale, and also because it
has a good active developer community behind it on places such as
slatedroid.com (formerly on xda-developers.com).  That tablet is all but
forgotten by Viewsonic, but with custom ROMs you can run Android 3.2
Honeycomb, and there are even early ports of Android 4.x Ice Cream Sandwich.
It has similar specs to the iPad 1, and works well enough for me for now.
I use it mostly for reading ebooks, web browsing, etc.
If I need to type a lot I go to my desktop PC.

I would suggest the new Asus TF300 instead of the prime. It has all the
features of the prime, but a plastic case instead of metal. The metal case
on the prime seems to cause problems with the wifi and gps antennas, so
they sometimes do not work. The TF300 has a plastic case, so these problems
went away. Both have the tegra 3 processor, but some reviews say the TF300
is clocked slower than the prime. However, there is a setting that allows
one to increase the clock speed to the max of the tegra 3 spec, so the
difference is moot. I was able to install Ubuntu on it in a chroot, so I
get the best of both worlds - android and Linux side by side in separate
windows. People are also dual booting linux and android with these tablets.

If you get one, be sure to root the tablet before you run any software
updates. It can only be rooted (so far) fresh out of the box; once it finds
a wifi signal it updated the firmware and you cannot root it. You need root
to install ubuntu.

I find it very useful with the keyboard dock for traveling. A great feature
is the keyboard batteries charge the tablet, so when it is docked it gets
about 12-14 hours per charge; about 8 - 10 hours on just the tablet.

But I am confused. Previously the exhibit hall only was free if you
enrolled early, but now it seems to be always $25. And I am a proposer
of a talk (although they rejected me!), which I thought was supposed to
get me some goodies, but when logged in to my O'Reilly account I see
nothing. And in previous years we got a PLUG discount, but I haven't
heard about that yet either. And then there is the perennial booth
question. I assume it will be a last-minute thing as it has always
been, but I hope that whatever machinations are required have been
or will be timely started.

Yesterday, because of this thread, I did a little searching, and found http://test-ipv6.comcast.net. There's a list of mirrors on there that led me to test-ipv6.com.

Both show me as natively running ipv6 on my Mac and router, the latter shows me as going through a 6to4 tunnel that I assume to be Comcasts doing, as I haven't set up any tunnels.

Subject: [PLUG] LibreOffice not keeping up with my fingers
Message-ID: <4FD0E504.5020005@comcast.net>

In the last few days I've found that LibreOffice Writer is not keeping 
up with my fingers. I'm typing along are around 60 to 70 wpm. I'm 
transcribing a recording and it's distracting to watch what I'm typing 
and not see it until a split second or so after I type it. It seems to 
be something that develops after typing for awhile. For instance, when I 
started transcribing this morning it was fine. But after about an hour, 
the slight delay set in. This happened yesterday, too.

(I posted this on the LibreOffice.org forum about 15 minutes ago. Since 
then the delay has gone from spit second to over a second.)

There was a LibreOffice upgrade in the last few days (on Ubuntu 10.04). 
Could there have been something that changed in the priority for getting 
what's typed onto the screen?

Is there something else I should be looking for?

Thanks.

I found this info on a public ML, so I assume it is public:

The Expo Hall Pass can be obtained for free by using the code "FREEPROJ" 
or "FREEORG".

Thanks. That worked. I am registered for the Expo Hall on Wednesday and
Thursday, and when I completed the registration the invoice was -0- and
was marked "paid." 

I should add that at the beginning page there is an invitation to ask
O'Reilly to ask for a discount for your group. Has anyone done that?
Should we?

Hi Russell,

I don't think comcast is doing any kind of 6to4 tunnels any more.  In
addition, for that to work, you need systems configured specifically
for that (they can't just push it down via DHCPv6 or anything).  Do
you have an Apple router?  Either that or your Mac may be falling back
to 6to4 automatically once router discovery fails, which may explain
that.  I know Apple has been pretty aggressive about adding support
for that kind of thing.

Ah, well I think the date I read was from 2011, not 2012, when the
World IPv6 *Test* Day happened.  This year, of course, lots of sites
turned on v6 and left it on for good instead of just testing it for a
day.

I did end up researching this and following up with Comcast.  They are
currently deploying IPv6 to areas that use an Arris branded CMTS.
Once they finish that roll out, they are going to upgrade their Cisco
CMTSes one by one.  Maybe within a few months.  It sounds like
Portland has a Cisco one, so the wait continues...

Only one /64?  That's too small to subnet?  :-(

They had a beta a while back, I participated in it.  It was business only.  Now they are in process of rolling out to residential.  I don't know how far along they are.

With how easy it is to go to he.net and get a tunnel (I have 2 of them, one for home and one for colo), I'd do that.  Once Comcast finishes their deployment, you can roll over to their dualstack environment.

We started out with a 10.11.x.y private address.  The /48 means that
each one of those x.y's can have its own /64.  Let us know if you have

I'm cleaning up a DNS setup that a previous admin didn't have working very well.  I've fixed a number of issues including dynamic dns.  I've worked with signed zones before and I've worked with dynamic zones, but this is the first time I've worked with one that is both.  My question is about how to make changes. 


For a vanilla zone it's easy: 
1) vi zonefile 
2) service named configtest 
3) rndc reload 


For a signed zone it's not much harder: 
1) vi zonefile 
2) dnssec-signzone the  zonefile to create zonefile.signed 
3) service named configtest 
4) rndc reload 


For a dynamic zone it's not too hard either: 
1) rndc freeze zonefile 
2) vi zonefile 
3) service named configtest 
4) rndc reload 
5) rndc thaw zonefile 


For a dynamic signed zone though I'm a bit hazy.  Something like this comes to mind: 
1) vi zonefile 
2) rndc freeze zonefile.signed 
3) dnssec-signzone the  zonefile to create zonefile.signed 
4) service named configtest 
5) rndc reload 
6) rndc thaw zonefile 

The thing is though, it seems like I'd lose all the dynamic info any time I made a change.  Although I'm pretty sure it would rebuild automatically I can't image that's best practice.  Does anyone have a better way to go about this?

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1206110738110.23438@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   On a long directory listing there are 8 fields: permissions, number of
links, owner/group, size, month, day, time, filename. If I want a list of
only filenames from cut I can specify the delimiter, but the listing is
delimited by one or more spaces. Trying -d" " seems to work for a single
space, and the man page (and my Google searches) haven't shown me how to
specify multiple spaces. Is there a generic 'white space' specification?

Since long listing is formatted in columns, why not use byte-list option 
'-b'?

 >cut -b 44-132  file

Or some other large number for the final range.

The problem with cut is that it's really picky.  You could get close with: 

ls -alh | cut -f11 -d'  ' 

but due to various file sizes sometimes you'll get the wrong field due to extra spaces.  So you'd end up running something else to delete the extra spaces first.  For your specific problem you could do this: 

ls -alh | tr -s ' ' | cut -f9 -d' ' 

Oh by the way, is etiquette here to reply all or reply list?

I'm not completely clear on what you're trying to accomplish, so forgive me
if I'm off base with these, but here are a couple of thoughts...

As far as I know, cut cannot deal with multiple delimiters... nor can it
handle a single delimiter consisting of multiple characters.

`ls -1` (that's a "one", not an "L") will give you a listing of just the
file names, each on a separate line

If you are trying to pull out more fields than just the filenames, try
using `cut -c8-12,25-` (replacing the numbers with the appropriate
values)... this example will give you chars 8 through 12 and 25 through the
end of each line. If using `ls -l`, the fields are fixed-length (other than
file name, but that is the last field), so this should be useful. Perhaps
more usefulness can be gotten out of this by using some of the formatting
and other options for the ls command.

Hope something here helps,
Rick

   My preference is to reply to the list. Saves me deleting extraneous

Subject: [PLUG] Upgrading Issues - Broken Dependency wanted to uninstall
	window manager
Message-ID: <4FD6EACC.9050108@f1forhelp.net>

Recently I was updating my Debian Testing (Currently Wheezy) laptop.  
After updating the local packages with aptitude update to update the 
local lists I found that there where 404 updates available for my 
system.  Issuing the aptitude dist-upgrade command brought up a list of 
the packages that would be installed, a couple of broken dependencies, 
and a list of the packages that would be removed including my window 
manager.

The primary dependency breaker =>  mysql-common : Breaks: 
mysql-server-core-5.1 (< 5.5) but 5.1.62-1 is to be installed.  
mysql-common requires a minimum version of mysql-server-core of v5.5.

Looking at the software installed on my laptop I have
root at d9300:/home/joseph# dpkg -l | grep mysql-server
ii  mysql-server-core-5.1                
5.1.61-3                           MySQL database server binaries

Looking at the software available I have available
root at d9300:/home/joseph# apt-cache search mysql-server
auth2db - Powerful and eye-candy IDS logger, log viewer and alert generator
mysql-server-5.1 - MySQL database server binaries and system database setup
mysql-server-core-5.1 - MySQL database server binaries
mysql-server - MySQL database server (metapackage depending on the 
latest version)
mysql-server-5.5 - MySQL database server binaries and system database setup
mysql-server-core-5.5 - MySQL database server binaries
torrentflux - web based, feature-rich BitTorrent download manager

I issue the command to upgrade mysql-server-core and resolve the primary 
blocker
# aptitude install mysql-server-core-5.5
dpkg: mysql-server-core-5.1: dependency problems, but removing anyway as 
you requested:
  akonadi-backend-mysql depends on mysql-server-core; however:
   Package mysql-server-core is not installed.
   Package mysql-server-core-5.1 which provides mysql-server-core is to 
be removed.

I was able to download and install all pending updates and keep my 
window manager!

Hope this helps someone.

I'm doing a bit of research.

For those of you who have have bothered to track it, how often does 
Comcast change your IP address?

I haven't seen much consistency - there was a time it seemed like it was 
changing about every three weeks, but lately it's been stable for over 3 
months.

I don't do dynamic DNS. every time comcast changes my IP, I update it in my
zone file. This has happened maybe 3 times in the last 5 years.

Mine has similarly remained very stable. I've had to update my DNS

Hello all,

Lance has kindly updated his online slides from this Ganeti talk!

http://www.lancealbertson.com/talks/
http://www.lancealbertson.com/2012/06/ganeti-tutorial-pdf-guide/

Thank you all for coming - the turn out was quite good.

Also, it looks like the next AT and General talks will be a bit switched 
due to scheduling conflicts on the parts of both speakers.

I hope to finalize the July General one this week.

Also, with the next AT meeting falling during OSCON, would prefer skip 
it or should I rustle up an OSCON presenter, possibly having the PLUG 
meeting at the Convention Center?

Thoughts?

Michael

Subject: [PLUG] Weird Thunderbird Thing
Message-ID: <4FD8F5F2.30006@comcast.net>

I have been using Thunderbird for many years. I have two Comcast e-mail 
addresses that I use it for, my primary account, (this one) and one I 
use for business related stuff. Lately (the past few weeks), when I have 
occasion to restart Thunderbird, such as this morning after a Ubuntu 
upgrade that required a reboot, I find that If I don't both get and send 
mail from my primary account, I my secondary account's password won't be 
accepted. If I do send and receive e-mail via my primary account first, 
then there is no problem with the password on the secondary account.

What's not clear is whether this is a Comcast problem or a Thunderbird 
problem. I'm guessing it's Thunderbird, but have no real basis for it 
other than I can successfully use the Comcast web e-mail tool.

Does anyone have any ideas about this one?

Thanks.

I'm not sure where I stand on the question of AT or no AT.  I would
certainly prefer AT at OSCON over AT at FreeGeek as long as that didn't
require everyone to pay to attend.

Also, David Mandel has always appeared to attend conventions with one of his
primary goals being to line up future speakers.  It seems to me that he came
away from LinuxFest one year with 6-9 individuals having agreed to speak at
PLUG.  If that wasn't already on your agenda, Michael, that might ease the
monthly line-up-a-speaker burden.

FWIW, the free dyndns.org membership seems to track the changes well for
me.

Portland Linux/Unix Group Meeting Announcement

Who: Auke Kok, Intel Open Source Technology Center
What: The systemd init(8) Replacement
Where: PSU, 1930 SW 4th Ave. Room FAB 86-01 (Lower Level)
When: Thursday, July 5th, 2012 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of awesome, open technologies.

See location H-10 on the PSU map at http://pdxLinux.org/campus_map.jpg

It's a little known secret that systemd is extremely capable of
starting, controlling and regulating more than just system services,
but can easily start an entire Desktop UI. Not many people have sat
down and implemented and worked out the problems of starting an X
service, a few UI components, the session bus and DBus services for
normal users with the mechanisms that systemd provides.

The benefits are obvious: Systemd provides excellent service
monitoring and restarting capabilities, provides socket and DBus
activation for relevant services, and overall improves desktop startup
by allowing user services to start well before core services like Xorg
or wayland start. In effect, we're saying goodbye to XDG autostart
entirely, and getting back reliability and scalability.

We converted several desktop environments including Tizen's Mobile UI,
Xfce4, Enlightenment and more to systemd user sessions. We "pop the
hood" and take a look at the implications for startup, what's possible
to further improve on the session startup and where we can do better.


Auke Kok is a software engineer at Intel's Open Source Technology
Center, and has been attempting to make Linux boot faster since 2007.
In 2008, he co-presented the "5-second boot" with Arjan van de Ven at
the first LPC. Since then, Auke has worked on further improving the
Linux Core OS start sequence, first for Moblin and later with MeeGo,
where we made the first switch to systemd. Auke now works on Tizen,
which will heavily integrate systemd in the Core OS.

Well... it falls during two parties:

http://www.oscon.com/oscon2012/public/schedule/grid/public/2012-07-17

One can also argue that the first Thursday meeting is of a rather 
Advanced nature.

I'm leaning towards calling OSCON and the CLS the July PLUG AT meeting.

Dale,

   A Google search turned up a couple of test videos.

   I've not heard about NoScript so I suspect that I'm not using it or
anything like it.

1: Adobe's web site has some flash tests.  Unfortunately, I don't
remember where they're located.  It's been a long time since I used
them, and I didn't keep any bookmarks.

2: If you are using something like NoScript, you may be blocking the
site that is actually sending the flash data.  That happens to me
quite a bit.  So while I can view YouTube vids with no trouble, some
other sites just sit there looking blank.  :-)  Enabling the data
source site fixes things right up.  It may take a bit of experimenting
to find which sites are the ones you want, though.

Hope this helps.

Message-ID: <CAArUT0gG7ptL4ZtLG=6kyx09bJmt8YDxvN8HgyEPHTpj5sSFLA@mail.gmail.com>

I used my Canon PowerShot SD780IS to record some videos in open shade on a
bright sunny day.  I transferred the resulting files to my Ubuntu system.
 The thumbnails (*.THM) look reasonable, but the videos (*.MOV) which are
listed as QuickTime, are heavily tinted blue.  ( The subject was a Blue
Grass band, but not that blue.)  The instructions for the camera do not
offer choices for video white balance, although it does for the stills.

One person suggested that that the problem may be in the display SW--I am
using Movie Player, the default on Ubuntu.

How do I diagnose the problem?

Thanks,

I'd start by opening the videos on another computer and/or with another
video player (VLC is what I usually use). If the videos are still blue,
then the problem is in the file, not the computer and not the player
program. In that case you need to fix the file. For that I suggest
video editing software, but someone else will have to suggest what and
how, as that is not my area of expertise.

Also, play other video of the same type on the same computer
to confirm that your setup can produce normal video colors.
It could be a monitor or video card configuration problem.

What you describe is what I would expect from a camera balanced for daylight rendering
subjects in open shade. 

This is correctable with any reasonable video editing program.

I have never seen such extreme blue due to open shade, but it is possible
that the white balance was set improperly.  It appears that the white
balance may revert to what ever it was set at the last time the video was
used, independent of how it was set for stills.  I wonder why the thumbnail
is not blue.

My guess at this point is that the file is at fault, likely due to white
balance (operator) error.

Message-ID: <20120616053532.GA16975@gate.kl-ic.com>

What does Dad want for Father's Day, Sunday June 17?  Linux
Clinic, of course!  Especially if he's your father, and he
wants you out of the house ...

So come on down to 731 Southeast 10th Avenue Portland, three
blocks south of Hawthorne.  While dear old dad would like you
out of the basement before dawn, we start at 1pm and run until
5pm.  That still gives him plenty of time to change the locks.
We can help you with a nice Father's Day card - Dad may want
express bus, but he'll probably get PCI.

You can earn your way towards his grudging tolerance by
installing his soon-to-be-favorite Linux distro on his PC.
We have all kinds.  We have wired and wireless internet, so
you can download other perfect (that is, free) gifts.  We
have monitors, mice, and keyboards, so you only have to sneak
his system box out of the house (while he isn't looking).  

Best of all, we have plenty of expert help, so you can shift
the blame for unwelcome/broken/obscene software onto us.

Tell Dad that you talked with Linus Torvalds, Mark Shuttleworth,
and other F/OSS movers and shakers, and they will help you find
a job Real Soon Now.  Well, you can talk with their code, at
least.  If the software doesn't work, you can scream some of
the same words that he screams at you.  Like father, like child!

Hi all,

A friend of mine gave me his laptop that has a cracked lcd.  I was
hoping I could come down, have someone teach me how to take the lcd
off, teach me how to get a replacement panel, i.e. what's a good price
at whatever site to get one, or possibly getting one somehow through
FreeGeek itself, show me what tools I need, etc.  Basically a primer
on fixing the hardware of my laptop.  Once I fix it, if it is fixable,
then I want to put Debian on it, or Mint, or whatever.  That latter
"project" would probably have to wait until the August clinic,
assuming everything goes well with fixing my laptop.  The point is, I
don't intend to get help fixing my laptop, and then not put linux on
it.  In fact, I have a desktop computer that has ubuntu 10.04.  Right
now the laptop does, "work", in the sense that it boots to windows.
There's just a big crack in the screen.  I hope what I'm seeking falls
within the purview of the clinic.

Sincerely,
Victor Soich

Bring it in. As always with the Clinic, no guarantees that it can be
fixed, but it probably can. 

But before the Clinic do some googling on replacement screens for the
laptop. Screens are among the most expensive component in a laptop, so
you might decide to forget about it. It kind of depends on the age and
quality of the laptop.

and am willing to pass it along to another willing owner.

I haven't booted the serve since October of 2011, but it worked fine the

Subject: [PLUG] Promoting Portland at OSCON
Message-ID: <4FE21194.2020403@ambidexter.com>


Hello all,

A few of us talked about OSCON after the meeting last night. PLUG will 
have one of the few dot org booths available and we concluded that one 
of the best things we can do is to promote Portland as a technology and 
community venue. I envision a tri-fold brochure with categorized lists 
of highlights and resources.


Some great suggestions were made last night and I invite you to brain 
dump your own ideas either to the list or me directly.

http://epdx.org offers some ideas but many are not open source-related 
or in Portland. To kick things off in no particular order:

Small size with big-city industry
Calagator/user group scene
No sales tax
OSB and OSCON
Free Geek
Drupal Foundation
Puppet Labs
Walmart Labs
Japanese Gardens
Chinese Gardens
Powell's Books
Foodcarts
Coffee and beer
OMSI
Intel
Outdoors activities
Good public transportation
Friendly environment
Award-winning airport

Michael

I attended the PLUG Adv Topics Meeting last night.

Joe Hammond and Stephanie Meldrum from VanderHouwen & Assoc provided some good 
information in a nice, informal meeting.  It's was nice to talk about this in a 
setting where they, or you, are not in "sales mode". There seem to be plenty of 
on-topic discussion afterwards; plenty of questions; good answers.

I think everyone enjoyed it.  I know I did and want to thank PLUG for arranging 
it and FreeGeek for use of their conference room.

Good point. Santa Barbara and a few others came online.

The Amsterdam and Tokyo flights are also quite handy, having abused them 
myself.

Personal Telco Project (or, free wifi, generally)

I don't travel enough to compare Portland first-hand to other places.
At one time I heard that free wifi was relatively rare in other
cities.  Although we didn't directly create most of the free wifi
networks in town, we like to take credit for early advocacy and
action, and helping creating the expectation that wifi networks here
should be open and free to the end-user.

I can tell you that PTP is one of the biggest and most active
community wireless networking projects left in the US.  Small compared
to projects in Europe, but this isn't Europe.  We also have crappy
public transportation and health insurance systems.

We've been offered a booth at OSCON, though we need to get the
contract in to them in the next few days.

I was just in the Huston airport--no free wifi (except that for a time an

My good friend Mr. Google, who sometimes knows more than I wish he did,

Will UEFI affect us? How? Should we be concerned? What is it, anyway?

Alan Turing was born on June 23, 1912 in London.  According to a

I think Mayor Adams promotes Portland frequently as an open source
venue. (He did speak at OSCON 2010.) In fact, I give him some credit for
the number of open source startups we see downtown and on the inner east
side. (I'm working at one now!)

Perhaps you might contact his office for more info?

Thanks,
Mike

During the summer months, you have wonderful weather (I even liked the
winter, but I realize that's subjective).

As someone who is currently in the sweltering midwest during record
highs (95 yesterday with 60% humidity) I really do pine for your
cooler climes :-)

Keith  replies:

Nothing on calagator or the IEEE events website.  A friend is
having a multipurpose celebration party in Vancouver on Friday
night, I will be toasting Turing at that.

Saturday the 23rd is the Wiknic at Willamette Park:
http://calagator.org/events/1250462455

Perhaps we can hijack a bit of that.

Hands down, we have amongst the BEST summer weather anywhere.  Natural
air-conditioning (due to the North Pacific chillers), when it does get
hot (rare) it is dry.  Most of the summer is 80-85F, sunny (by
afternoon), dry and extremely pleasant.  Compare to east coast.

One downside, spectacular thunderstorms are very rare.

Subject: [PLUG] Old Hard Drive Disposal
Message-ID: <4FE39DEB.6020108@comcast.net>

I have a stack of failed hard drives, each of which has failed sometime 
in the ancient past (maybe as long ago as the '90s). The only reason I 
still have them is that there is personal data on them. I realize that 
if they failed it is unlikely they could be recovered without expensive 
equipment, but I'm wondering if the best thing to do is to convert them 
to blocks of aluminum with holes in them. I'm thinking that I could 
drill a hole through each one of them before sending them to recycling 
and the old data will be hard to get, even with the expensive equipment.

Any better ideas?

I have used the platters for art. Effectively putting holes in them.

If you wanted to give me the platters, I would make art out of them.

I am sure there are people closer who would as well.

Dick,

   Don't know if it's a better idea, but I used to have a strong tape
demagnitizer that I'd use on dead hard drives in the '80s and '90s. A few
circles on both top and bottom of the drive case and I was sufficiently
confident the bits were scrambled beyond redemption.

Indeed! They have a dedicated breaker that they use on drives they do 
not plan on using. They scrub drives otherwise. If you mark them as 
"dead", they're pretty much guaranteed to go to the breaker and get 
properly recycled.

Dear Pluggers,

A client of mine is currently using GoDaddy for hosted e-mail services.
They're not very satisfied, but see the advantages of using a hosted service
rather than running it in-house.  Do any of you have recommendations for
hosted e-mail service providers you're pleased with.  The client is using a
variety of e-mail clients (Thunderbird, something on the Mac, the service's
Webmail interface, Windows Mail, etc.), so they're looking for something
pretty much just using standard protocols.

Thanks in advance,
                                     -Brian Martin

Since you haven't really listed any of the clients email requirements (in
terms of security, backups/archives, etc.) it's difficult to say if this
will meet your needs... but it's been a life-saver for me...

Some people may have strong opinions against it, but I manage our hosted
email services at work... we use Google Apps for Domains (I think that's
the official name). It's basically a corporate version of GMail+the other
Google services (so... if you want it to be... it can be SOOO much more
than JUST email... calendar, GoogleDocs, and much, much more).

Our users love that it works the same way as their (personal) GMail/Google
accounts.

I love that it is incredibly flexible and feature-ful... and not terribly
difficult to manage. You can manage it "by hand" through a web interface,
or use the APIs to do some more fancy/automated/etc. management.

If someone doesn't want to use the usual web interface, it can be used with
any POP or IMAP client... and is fully compatible with iOS, Android (of
course), etc. The web version will work on pretty much any web browser
(although you may have limited functionality on older browsers)... it does
not require any additional plugins (Flash, etc.)

I know that their paid corporate version can be a little spendy... that's
the big drawback. There is a free (ad-supported) version of Google Apps for
Domains (much like regular GMail, not terribly intrusive ads)... but I'm
not sure whether their EULA allows for corporate use - might be worth
looking into.

That's my $0.02 anyway. Hope it's of value to you.

Two ideas:

1) You can try a .50cal rifle, and 1 round can go through quite a few of
them.
Contact me privately if you want to give this a "shot."

2) If the individual disks ( 2 - 4 to a drive) are similar size and
thickness, you can make a handy little Tesla-style disk turbine or pump af
a mechancal engineering project.

Subject: [PLUG] Old Hard Drive Disposal


I have a stack of failed hard drives, each of which has failed sometime 
in the ancient past (maybe as long ago as the '90s). The only reason I 
still have them is that there is personal data on them. I realize that 
if they failed it is unlikely they could be recovered without expensive 
equipment, but I'm wondering if the best thing to do is to convert them 
to blocks of aluminum with holes in them. I'm thinking that I could 
drill a hole through each one of them before sending them to recycling 
and the old data will be hard to get, even with the expensive equipment.

Any better ideas?

Better late than never...

Did you get this fixed? Whats the CPU?

There is an odd flash bug floating around at the moment. Adobe started
using the SSE2 complier flag. only not all chipsets*  support the SSE2
instruction set. 

See: https://bugbase.adobe.com/index.cfm?event=bug&id=3161034

The version of Flash shipped with Chrome is compiled without this and
works fine. Its possible to extract the plugin from a package, rename
and move it into the appropriate directory and Firefox will  use it
without problems.

Disassemble them yourself.  Platters become shiny coasters or high-tech mobile components (the artsy things that hang from the ceiling).  Magnets get stuck to the fridge and never come off.

FYI, if you need any of that data you can sometimes recover it by putting them in the freezer inside a ziplock bag for about 30 minutes first.  You'll then sometimes get about 5-10min of time to get your data off.

Interesting idea. Of course I've seen that over the decades starting 
with larger platters from 300 MB Control Data Disk Packs. I've certainly 
got enough to do something interesting. I'll give that some thought.

I knew that FreeGeek scrubs every drive the get before doing anything 
else with it. I wasn't aware of them breaking the non-functioning ones 
before recycling them. That's good to know.

I saw, and even used, a tape demagnetizer years ago, but I don't have 
one. Paul's idea shows that I have a collection of good, strong magnets 
to work with, once I take the drives apart.

I'll pass on the .50 cal rifle idea, it would be fun to try the ME 
experiment. I do have quite a few drives to dispose of.

All but one of these are several years old, and the data has been 
superseded. But this is an idea I'll keep for future reference.

Thanks to all. The winning recommendation is to take them apart, us the 
magnets on the platters, create some art, and send the rest to recycling.

Looks like this might have been a T-Bird bug that was fixed with today's

SB Live! uses the emu10k1 driver, so it should work.  According to the
Alsa website,
 <http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Matrix:Module-emu10k1>
you may need the alsa-firmware package.

Hope this helps.

Thanks. It did help in my search for more details. In the end what I had
to do to make it work was to disable the motherboard sound in BIOS.

Out of curiosity, is there another solution that offers competitive 
pricing for hosting the email accounts on a domain basis? I work for a 
small company and we have at least two domains that we would need less 
than 5 actual email accounts for total and paying Google $5 -- $10 per 
email account seems...unattractive when we really only need basic email 
functionality.

It's way overkill for what you want, but I pay 1and1.com $36 every 3 months. For that I get my domain hosted in perpetuity, up to 2000 email accounts, and a bunch of other stuff that I usually forget about.

I use it for free. And the paid version is $50 per user per year. And what
you get for that is way more than you get from anywhere else for that price.

Subject: [PLUG] Creating an ISO of a drive in a USB enclosure
Message-ID: <4FE51384.5060601@comcast.net>

Is it possible to create an ISO of a drive in a USB enclosure -- and if 
so, what program do I use? Or do I have to open my box and physically 
connect the drive to an IDE port to be able to access it without 
mounting it?

I have an old laptop with a failing hard drive. I have a newer, spare 
hard drive and want to "simply" copy the entire contents of the old 
drive onto the new one. The newer drive has a larger capacity than the 
older one.

Yes, you can create an ISO, but why do it that way?  It seems
rather a roundabout way doing things.  I assume, since you
mentioned the new drive has a larger capacity than the old one,
that you aren't interested in copying the old drive's
partitioning.  (Which would be preserved in an ISO copy.)  I'd
suggest that you use fdisk or gparted to create the partitioning
you want on the new drive, mkfs the new filesystem(s) you want,
and simply copy your files.  It won't be very fast -- USB isn't
what you'd call a speed demon -- but it'll get the job done.

Message-ID: <CAA-F0u_a+GA-CcnE6As3oXjQwK=Tn4QWNniCwLNR+ikcfSui0A@mail.gmail.com>

I'm setting up a PC for someone who is pretty computer illiterate,
almost all Windoz. The PC will be the focal point for selling online.
Initially EBay and eventually a hosted 'shopping cart'

Input will be a couple camera's, scanner, etc.

Output will be a old LJ5M and over time a thermal label printer.

My Linux background has been 99% Fedora. For me it does what I want,
and over 50% of the time I live in a basic xterm world.

I'm considering Ubuntu 12.04 for this PC and looking for comments
issues etc. I'm not interested in religious or pie-in-the-sky, or
similar thoughs. Instead things like issues with printing UPS shipping

I've been a Redhat, Fedora, CentOS users since Redhat Linux 3.0.3 (the 
first distribution CD I purchased) so I understand your question.

I just installed 12.04 on a friends computer.  The biggest issue "I" ran 
into was the "new" interface.

The local user group North Idaho Linux User Group is mostly Ubuntu users 
with the odd (including me) user of Debian, Mint, Puppy, and CentOS so I 
got a couple of issues I had solved by them.

I recently acquired a old Dell Dimension 4400 so I was playing with a 
few distributions.  I found the two Fedora spins (XFCE, LXDE) I tried 
don't like the older video cards.  The wouldn't even install.  I'm 
reluctant to take the time to try the full Fedora install until I get to 
my eeePC 1000 netbook which is running a customized older Fedora.

Ubuntu 12.04 didn't play well with the SATA raid card (RAID 1) in that I 
couldn't figure out how to tell the installation process to use the RAID 
partition for HOME or to just ignore it.  Every time I tried to remove 
it during the hard drive setup the operation would puke.  I got tired of 
fiddling so gave up.  My take is Ubuntu works fine for the 
desktop/workstation that doesn't require too custom of an install.

On the up side for me is CentOS 6 and Scientific Linux 6 install fine. 
I know how to get the extras (closed source or from another repo)  I 
need working.

As far as printers go it will probably come down to whether PPDs are 
available for CUPS to use.


Good computing,
Rod

Message-ID: <20120623201522.0c492c8b@mailhost.pdx.edu>

After the latest upgrade to Firefox 13.0 I notice that when I open a
new, blank tab it displays the most recently visited pages all over the
page so I can go back to the pages just by clicking on the link.

This is a good idea? What if someone's wife opens a new tab on his
machine and sees all the porn sites he's been going to? I don't know
whose idea this was, but it wasn't a very good one.

As usual, I can't find any way to turn this feature off.

Thanks for your reply, Dale. I replied to it, but it didn't make it to 
the list. Briefly, here's what I did:

I put the likely failing drive into my USB enclosure and powered it up.
I ran mount to see what device Ubuntu decided it was, which was 
/dev/sdb1. Then I did the following:

sudo umount /dev/sdb1.
sudo dd if=/dev/sdb1 bs 512 >cher.iso

I swapped out the laptop sized drives and ran:

sudo dd if=cher.iso bs=512 of=/dev/sdb1

It took a little while to move the 10 GB, but I let it run in the 
background while I worked on a couple of other things. Once it finished 
I put the newer drive in the old laptop and it worked as expected.

Not sure why the more verbose version of this didn't make it to the 
list, but I'm happy the project turned out to be straightforward.

Chrome does something similar.  I struggled to make the new tab open my
home page, with limited success.  But I was not highly motivated, so I lost
interest in solving it.

I found the display of a grid of past pages annoying, too. The above 
mentioned solution, clicking on the little grid icon on the upper right 
corner of the new tab page works for me. (Firefox 13.0.1)

about:config

browser.newtabpage.enabled - set it to false. The outcome is the same
as setting the url to about:blank, without the circle of Firefox still
trying to load something.

 -or-

browser.newtab.url - set it to something other than about:newtab.

This did not actually create an iso, unless your drive was already
formatted as iso9660. The filename you used here could have been
anything, as it was only making a disk image (dd to a file will always
make a disk image of the on disk format). Works for your situation, it
just isn't an actual iso.

Thanks for the clarification. Someday I may want to create a real iso 
and would be puzzled as to why it wasn't working.

Message-ID: <4FE86C84020000700000E7EA@mail.davistl.com>


Our network is pretty small and the setup doesn't seem that complex.  The previous admin has this hackish setup where one of our remote facilities is bouncing through a file server acting as a software router.  There is no need for that as our hardware routers are perfectly capable of handling the traffic.  Here is the current setup in order: 

remote workstation (192.168.6.5 255.255.255.0 default gw 192.168.6.15) 

remote router - LAN SIDE (192.168.6.15 255.255.255.0) 

remote router - WAN SIDE (192.168.5.2 255.255.255.0) 

local edge router - WAN SIDE (192.168.5.1 255.255.255.0) 

local edge router - LAN SIDE (192.168.4.15 255.255.255.0) 

hackish software router - OUTSIDE (192.168.4.1 255.255.255.0) 

hackish software router - INSIDE (192.168.3.6 255.255.255.0) 

core router - (192.168.3.1 255.255.255.0) 

local workstation - (192.168.3.76 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.3.1) 

That all works fine as currently setup. 

So the other night we went to do maintenance and remove the software router.  We changed the local edge router address from 4.15 to 3.230 and added the RIP info on the core router.  At first it seemed fine, the routes all got shared, however after a bit our testing showed that we could get to 6.15 on the remote router, but that we couldn't reach 6.5, in fact even the remote router couldn't reach 6.5 (from within a remote session) which is strange since that's on the same subnet.  We rolled back the changes and everything is fine, but I have to admit I'm a bit puzzled.  Can I buy a vowel?

Is it possible to provide a diagram?
When you say "we could get to 6.15 on the remote router, but that we
couldn't reach 6.5,"  can you please elaborate on that?

To make it simple for you , draw a plan and the route of your traffic and
test it one connection at a time.
Example: can I get to my GW from local VLAN
Can you route to your upstream GW
and move up from there

Best advise I could give you is use "traceroute" as your primary testing,
vs, ping or ssh, telnet etc...since all that can be filtered by may many
elements

Good luck

I could provide a diagram if necessary, but it's basically just a straight line. 

What I was saying was that we could reach the LAN interface on the remote router 192.168.6.15 but not the workstation at 192.168.6.5  The only time I've seen something like that previously was when the default gateway on the workstation wasn't configured properly but we re-verified that and it looks fine. 

I agree about testing one connection at a time, that's exactly what we did when it didn't work the way we expected.  I tried ping first because that's easy, but then traceroute of course to see where it was dying.
 
Starting from my workstation I could reach all the way to the remote router's local interface 6.15 just not that one last step to the remote workstation on 6.5 

So far the info on the software router looks pretty straightforward: 

Net  0            Gateway 192.168.3.1  Metric 1 Passive 
Net  192.168.5.0/255.255.255.0 Gateway 192.168.4.15 Metric 2 Passive 
Net  192.168.6.0/255.255.255.0 Gateway 192.168.4.15 Metric 3 Passive 

It's an old Netware 6.5 server we're trying to de-commission.

When you say "we could get to 6.15 on the remote router, but that we
couldn't reach 6.5,"  can you please elaborate on that?

To make it simple for you , draw a plan and the route of your traffic and
test it one connection at a time.
Example: can I get to my GW from local VLAN
Can you route to your upstream GW
and move up from there

Best advise I could give you is use "traceroute" as your primary testing,
vs, ping or ssh, telnet etc...since all that can be filtered by may many
elements

Good luck

 So let me see if I understand this. The sw router routes betwen the
a.b.3.d (in) and a.b.4.d (out) networks. You took the sw router out of the
network and re-ip'd the local edge router's LAN interface from a.b.4.d to
a.b.3.d.

So that gives me:

local wkstn (a.b.3.d) => core rtr (a.b.3.d) => local edge rtr LAN (a.b.3.d)
=> local edge rtr WAN (a.b.5.d) => remote rtr WAN (a.b.5.d) => remote rtr
LAN (a.b.6.d)

You say connectivity exists from local wkstn (a.b.3.d) to remote router WAN
(a.b.6.d).

Is there an arp entry in the arp table for remote wkstn on remote rtr with
a mac address? Command on most routers is "show arp"

Start with figuring out connectivity issue between remote rtr and remote
wkstn. Network routing seems to be intact.

Also, you have the sw router interfaces defined as "inside" and "outside"
which makes me think that it was doing more than just routing but it was
also acting as firewall. Which makes sense because it seems to be sitting
in between the core and the edge.

When you put the edge rtr's LAN interface onto the "core" subnet there
might also be some firewall rules in the core router too?

Wait a sec. "we changed the local edge router address from 4.15 to 3.230
and added the RIP info on the core router.

RIP has nothing to do with the routing between local wkstn, core router and
edge rtr LAN because they're all on the same subnet. No routing protocol
necessary. All routing is done local. That is they're all on the same
subnet so it's just an arp table lookup.

What RIP info did you add on the core router? What happens if you add a
static route on the core router to the remote wkstn?

I'd be curious to see the routing table on the core router with and without
the the sw router connected and with and without RIP enabled.

using ping with the -r -I options. This will force the ip stack to not use
the routing table (-r) and ping directly from the interface (-I) address.
This would tell you that ip connectivity works from the remote rtr to
remote wkstn but that there's a problem in the routing table. Which is what
I suspect.

Hello all,

Alas, the PLUG first Thursday speaker is swamped at work and unable to 
present in July. A future date should not be a problem for them.

I am asking a few other candidates and welcome your input. Remember that 
every one of you is a potential speaker on a topic that is obvious to 
you but not the rest of us.

Given that the talk was going to be about systemd, might anyone want to 
talk about upstart, the alternative alternative init?

Message-ID: <4FECCA34.1010500@ambidexter.com>


Hello all,

My wires were crossed with my Intel speakers!

UEFI will have to wait but systemd is a go!


Portland Linux/Unix Group Meeting Announcement

Who: Auke Kok, Intel Open Source Technology Center
What: The systemd init(8) Replacement
Where: PSU, 1930 SW 4th Ave. Room FAB 86-01 (Lower Level)
When: Thursday, July 5th, 2012 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of awesome, open technologies.

See location H-10 on the PSU map at http://pdxLinux.org/campus_map.jpg

It's a little known secret that systemd is extremely capable of
starting, controlling and regulating more than just system services,
but can easily start an entire Desktop UI. Not many people have sat
down and implemented and worked out the problems of starting an X
service, a few UI components, the session bus and DBus services for
normal users with the mechanisms that systemd provides.

The benefits are obvious: Systemd provides excellent service
monitoring and restarting capabilities, provides socket and DBus
activation for relevant services, and overall improves desktop startup
by allowing user services to start well before core services like Xorg
or wayland start. In effect, we're saying goodbye to XDG autostart
entirely, and getting back reliability and scalability.

We converted several desktop environments including Tizen's Mobile UI,
Xfce4, Enlightenment and more to systemd user sessions. We "pop the
hood" and take a look at the implications for startup, what's possible
to further improve on the session startup and where we can do better.


Auke Kok is a software engineer at Intel's Open Source Technology
Center, and has been attempting to make Linux boot faster since 2007.
In 2008, he co-presented the "5-second boot" with Arjan van de Ven at
the first LPC. Since then, Auke has worked on further improving the
Linux Core OS start sequence, first for Moblin and later with MeeGo,
where we made the first switch to systemd. Auke now works on Tizen,
which will heavily integrate systemd in the Core OS.

Crap.  Get him to cancel!  I won't be in town and I wanted to see that

Angstrom is using systemd nowadays, boots the BeagleBone in under 10
