I'm pretty sure that's it. Stuff not quite ready for 64-bit. 

Sadly, after my last response I tried to reinstall the Nvidia driver. No go. The instructions that I bookmarked from last time appeared to work, but when I rebooted I got the same "X won't start" problem. Had to edit xorg.conf with nano again to get the open source driver back. The open source driver works just fine for everything else -- I need it only for playing DVDs. And, having done all the 230 updates that started me on the current problem, I tried playing DVDs with the open source driver again, but same problems as before. Totem launches and then just disappears. So now I have to go figure out how to reinstall the Nvidia driver. But that is not a critical problem, so it can wait until after finals. No time right now to watch movies anyway.

Actually, from everything I have read, it does run generally a little faster than the 32-bit version, although I suspect the difference is pretty trivial. My first reason is because this is my first venture into Linux and I wanted a baptism by fire. Best way to learn software is just doing it, making mistakes, and figuring out how to fix them. Sometimes it's painful, but that way you don't forget the lesson. It's been only a year for me, but I already have a pretty impressive collection of scars.

My second need is to use this computer for my class work in linguistics at PSU. But so far that only requires a GUI word processor with all the bells and whistles. OpenOffice.or 2.0 fills that bill, although there are occasional font issues -- it can't use OTF fonts, but that's also true of the 32-bit Linux version. If I couldn't run OO.org in 64-bit Linux I would be forced to use 32-bit. But since OO.o does run in 64-bit Linux, then running 64-bit helps with my goal of learning Linux. 

There may come a problem this fall when I will need to run Treeform (http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~donaldd/treeform.htm) for drawing syntax trees. I can do syntax trees in OO.o, but it's tedious. Treeform is written in Java, and it is supposed to run on Linux. I "installed" it, but can't figure out how to launch it. No documentation, of course. Most people use Visio on Windows for syntax trees. I tried Kivio, supposedly the Linux equivalent, but it's nowhere near the "equivalent." You can't create your own templates even. I could run Visio under Wine or something, but I don't want MS stuff if I can avoid it. Besides, you can't run Wine in 64-bit yet either.

I noticed on the Ubuntu forums that the release of Dapper Drake is imminent. I've been reading the comments from users of the 64-bit beta, and it looks like it will solve a lot of the above problems.

Is your development web server setup for Server Side Includes?

Derek,

   Yes, it is. That's how the header, menus, and footer are included on each
page. Of course, I'm far from an expert on these things, but I followed the
apache SSI tutorial and everything appears to be correct.

Have you tried Dia?  Maybe also Inkscape (>= 0.43 has connectors.)

But if you really want to graph some serious trees, anything is tedious 
compared to graphviz.  No GUI though, but maybe worth a look if you're 
thinking of getting your 64bits worth.

  http://www.graphviz.org/

The great thing about it is that you can generate the dot language 
programmatically.

Maybe you could write it in Latin?
 
http://search.cpan.org/~dconway/Lingua-Romana-Perligata-0.50/lib/Lingua/Romana/Perligata.pm

Also, install this one: 
http://search.cpan.org/~ingy/HashBang-Lingua-Romana-Perligata-0.10/

So your Latin scripts can start with:

  #!/usr/bin/perligata

Do the error logs for Apache show anything? Whenever I've had SSI errors its
the first place I look and it usually points me in the right direction.

   Good catch, Drew.

   It turns out to be a missing axs.pl script in cgi-bin locally.

Many thanks,

Not very pretty output either, but it works.

There are a couple of Perl modules that handle Graphviz.

The problem with Graphviz is that generating large graphs can be difficult 
to display and even harder to read.  (They start looking like an 
invocation to the Flying Spaghetti Monster.)  I generated one graph that 
turned into a png file large enough that it required a couple of gigs of 
ram to display it properly.  (You can generate the graph as PostScript, 
but then you get to play jigsaw puzzle with the printer output.) Most 
imageviewers choke on a 1,800 x 23,800 pixel png file.

It was a response from 64.5.35.225 to your machine based on a request to
port 80 to 64.5.35.225 .. the destination port 4766 wasn't blocked since
there was probably a NAT route entry for this outbound request so it let the
response come back inbound to the machine that requested it.

Have you communicated via a webmail interface with Office Depot?

   $ dig -x 64.5.35.225 +short
   email.officedepot.com.

If so, I suspect it was an errant keepalive packet...

It looks like this is an aborted connection to a web site you were accessing.
spt=80 ==> web dst=4766==> Random port about 1024 used to start a connection.
When I went to that address with my browser it showed that the site was a
secure site of Office Depot, but the security cert. was not quite right.

I don't think the Cisco 678 will work with the faster DSL service.  I 
guess it depends on what you are doing.

The OS matters not.. I have a 678 connected (bridged) to my FreeBSD
router. It speaks Ethernet...

The 678 works with most DSL speeds.. 5Mb/s isn't a problem, but I don't
know about 7 (most people can't get that anyway).

678 works fine for me ~ 4 Mbs but if you want some SNMP stats
from it, forget it.

Qwest will 'give' you a unit if you pester them
enough, i think they run a 'free router' about
1/2 the year.

If not, bug my and I'll see if i can find my
backup 678.

you can find them at thrifts for $5-10

I've been using DSL-Only for some years now; I have their SOHO service
which is about $32/mo and includes 4 IP addresses for ~1.2/.9 Mb.  My
service has been quite solid for some years now; the only interruption
was when I moved and that was because Qwest neglected to tell me I
needed to give them 2 weeks notice.  Parts of their network are Windows
based; I think their DNS and mail servers, but since I run my own it
makes no difference to me.

I found a grant funded project to see if you could turn a bunch of Xboxs into a
super-computer cluster using Linux.

The major benefits being cheap, available, no monitor or keyboard
needed and small size.

The only thing I think they did wrong was that they used a Xbox for
the cluster controller.

Eh, it's a 733MHz Celeron.  IMHO this machine is not worth the hassle 
for running Linux.  Much less resistance just getting an older HP or 
something.

I have not personally subscribed to Live, but from what I have read you 
should not until you're done making the mods, as people have reported 
it's the change in the system that can trigger a ban.

My mod chip has a feature that allows you to run the xbox with the mod 
chip disabled.  Not sure if it can still be detected, but my intention 
was for media.  I don't plan on paying MS for Live.  And you can get 
purely software based mods done, but then I think you remove the ability 
to get back into the stock xbox environment.

The xbox is a PC.  Intel CPU, NVIDIA gfx, standard IDE hard drive and 
slightly proprietary DVD drive.  The BIOS however is proprietary, and 
only allows digitally signed code to run.  Copying a DVD game doesn't 
get the digital sig.  This is why you cannot play copied games.

The mod chip is a component you install that allows you to bypass the MS 
BIOS and thus run unsigned code.  You must solder several wires onto the 
motherboard (unless you buy the more expensive solderless adapter) to 
complete the installation.  This is not for the unexperienced person. 
The one I use (Xecuter 3) provides a LED panel and DIP switch that are 
connected to the outside of the box.  The DIP switches allow you to use 
different banks of the BIOS for different firmwares.  This helps in 
testing or when you flash to a new firmware you can switch back if you 
hose the install.

The xbox runs a very stripped Win2K kernel for the underlying OS.  The 
operating environment is called a Dashboard (Windows on top of DOS?). 
This is what most people replace with something new, like XBox Media 
Center (XBMC), but there are others.

However now that you have this ability, you use the xbox's internal hard 
drive to run XBMC and not bother with a DVD each time.  Mine boots up to 
XBMC, but I can still boot stock easily.  This leads to "why not put 
lots more on the hard drive" mentality.  Especially when you realize you 
can get a torrent for several hundred NES, SNES, Genesis, & N64 games 
and just have all that stored on your xbox hdd.  But why stop there 
right?  Install a larger drive and store all your xbox games too and 
bypass the need to get your DVD's out at all.  You may as well put some 
movies on there too eh?  Or just access files over the network via SMB. 
  Maybe you're starting to get the picture.

> Why is XBOX so popular if it's nothing more than a low end PC that has 
> been hardware modified so that it can run the XBOX operating system only?

Because a ~$200 PC can't do all that and play xbox games too.  I dunno. 
  Building a PC to sit under my TV and do what my xbox does would cost 
more than that, and would be butt ugly.  An xbox 360 can't hold a candle 
to mine.  Outside of playing 360 games mine does much more.  The 360 
won't do DivX or XviD, et al.

As I started out saying it's not.  Get a PC.  But I felt I had to give 
some background in why people do this, and what the process is about to 
help make the point.  Knowing why people do this may help you know if 
you want to.

People waste too much time making everything run some OS.  But to each, 
their own. :)

Have set up a 678 on a 8Mbps DSL connection.  Work with Linux?  Yes. Use
'minicom -o' to set up through serial port.  You can find the CBOS commands

I have a Cisco 678 at 7Mbps with Qwest.  I also have a Paradyne and an
Actiontec in reserve.  I also have a dead Cisco 675 and three that are
just useless.

I would just like to say that I hate you all. I can't get comcast, and
DSL is only 1.5Mb for me. I actually called qwest *today* to ask if
they're try provisioning 5Mb for me. They can't, because their clicky
box doesn't have that option for my line.

Know anyone who works in the qwest NOC here? :)

No, those are just vector drawing programs. No real improvement for me
over the Draw function in OO.o. I think I failed to explain what
Treeform does. You click on a tool to draw a specific tree (buttons for
various types of trees) and it automatically draws the tree, puts the
default labels on the nodes, and you're ready to enter the glosses
underneath, for which the text box(es) are empty with a cursor blinking
in them. Then you decide you need another tree branching underneath, so
you put the cursor on the node where you want the branch to connect and
click on the appropriate tree type -- immediately the new tree is
placed in the right position, again, with nodes appropriately named and
input boxes ready for you to type in the glosses.

These are not graphs. They are trees. They look sort of like this:

                /|\
               / | \
                   /\

Except they get really involved. For some you need very, very large
pieces of paper, although usually we just do a portion of an utterance
at a time.

OK, until today I was OK with my 60 GB iPod. Right now you couldn't
GIVE me another Apple product.

It has been working fine. OK, occasionally it just stops for no reason
and you have to hit the Pause button to get to to continue. A flaw in
the design -- it always happens when walking, never when it is just
sitting. In other words, there is some kind of a motion detector in the
thing that parks the disk or something when you move it too fast.
Except it is too sensitive.

And then there is the problem of mounting and unmounting, and the ease
with which you can totally hose the database. Not a very robust bit of
software. And if you do hose it you have to use a Windows XP or 2000
SP4 computer to restore it, because the restore utility will not work
on anything else.

But all in all,it worked. Until today, that is, when I grabbed it on my
way out the door to go to the university. It was playing through my
stereo, plugged into its power adaper. I've disconnected it many times
and never a problem. Today, as I went to put it in my shirt pocket I
pressed the bottom button to turn it off. And it wouldn't turn off. I
tried all morning to turn it off. The button appeared to be broken.

So I get to school and decide to take it to the second floor of the
bookstore, which is where I bought it last summer. The clerk there
confirmed that it wouldn't turn off, and suggested I take it to the
Apple store at Pioneer Place, where she said they had iPod technicians.
"Cool," I thought, and planned to walk down there later after a meeting
I needed go to.

So I get to the store, wait around for 15 minutes until my number comes
up. While waiting I pull it out of my pocket and -- lo and behold -- it
is OFF! So I decide I'll stick around to talk to the tech anyway, just
to see if there is a known problem with the off button. Finally I get
to speak to the technician. He plugs it into his computer, fiddles with
his mouse a bit, and then says "I see you have music installed that was
not created with iTunes or from the iTunes store. It looks like it was
created with [curious look on his face] ... 'lame'?

"Uh, yeah," I say. But they all play just fine.

"Yes," he says. "But you see, we cannot support your iPod because there
might be something wrong with your mp3s that could cause a problem with
the iPod software."

"Fine. All I want is for you to check to see if there might be a
problem with the buttons."

"OK," he says, and proceeds to fiddle with the iPod wheel while looking
at his computer screen. "No, everything seems to be working just fine.
Now, while you're here, I see you have the older version of the Apple
software. I can upgrade it for you and it will just take a minute, if
you like."

"OK," I said. Whereupon he took my iPod into the back of the store. A
few minutes later he returned and gave it back to me. I left and
returned to the university. As soon as I was comfortably seated in the
library with some work to do in front of me, I pulled out the iPod so I
could listen to tunes while studying. I turned it on and ... no music.
He wiped out all the songs on my iPod. And he must have done it
delibaretely, not because he reformatted the disk, because my settings
and playlists are intact.

And to reply to myself, there is no SDK for public use on the xbox.  Any 
software you find out there in binary form is illegal.  The xbox with a 
mod chip in it only boots, but does nothing until you get a firmware on 
it.  It's a whole new underground community and a maze of IRC and FTP 
sites to get the actual files.  Get to that stuff once, then it's easy.

Whether you run Linux or XBMC you still have to do a lot of work.  But 
it's so freaking cool, to be able to download BBC shows, video podcasts, 
and missed episodes of Lost (in HDTV) then watch it all on my TV 
upstairs when I have time, and with the commercials already ripped out.

Don't dimiss it so quickly. It does trees. Take a look at figure one:

It also does "large". Surely this isn't the biggest example out there,

   This is something fairly new, and quite annoying. When I'm working on a
console (not a virtual terminal in X), the mouse works, but I cannot copy
text by highlighting it with the left button down, then pasting by clicking
with the right button.

   It works in X, but no longer on a console. PITA.

   I'd like your ideas of what I should check, or test, to find the problem so
it can be solved. FWIW, this is on Slackware-10.2.

And it gets worse: Apple will be probably be using similar tactics
with all the podcasts going into "iTunes U":

http://webcastinabox.com/openminded/2006/04/the_problem_with_itunes_u.html
http://webcastinabox.com/openminded/2006/04/the_problem_with_itunes_u_gara.html

The potential for an amazing wealth of educational content available
in open formats.  Poof, all gone.  Don't expect to listen to any of
these podcasts on Ubuntu.  I know I can't.  There is no business model
for iTunes on Linux, as long as Linux is an open platform.

the post is about the *shuffle* which has solid state memory. I'm not sure 
that the normal ipod's have real discs - I think even the mini's have flash 
memory too.

mounting and unmounting actually increase safety of your data - read up on fs 
design in most unixes.

there is a suite of perl utilities that works just fine.

your story below to me sounds more like bad luck. I once helped a guy who 
bought a brand new mercedes that started fine in the dealership when he bought 
it and drove it straight to the airport for a business meeting (this was back 
when I lived in europe btw). when he picked it up a few hours later it didn't 
work at all. Tough luck, but I wouldn't say all mercedeses are shitty cars 
right away ;) (he ended up getting a completely new replacement driven to him 
in 3 hours).

I believe only the Shuffle and Nano have flash memory, I think the Mini
uses an IBM/Hitachi microdrive, the full sized ones all use small hard
drives.

I hate to be a dick about this, but, as usual, the problems here were due 
to your own ignorance and not problems with the product (besides the usual 
sort of junk that happens with consumer electronics running complex 
software).

There's no motion sensor.  There is, however, a circuit that cuts to pause 
when the headphones are removed.  If your headphone jack is loose or (much 
more likely) you have a short in your headphones, small shifts in the 
position of the thing is triggering the auto-pause mechanism.

I had the same problem and got better headphones and no more problem.

That's not strictly true, either.  First, there is a utility to update the 
firmware (and reformat the disk) that doesn't require iTunes available 
from Apple.  If you want to do it under Linux, there are perl utilities.

Did you try a hard reset?  On my model, you hold down the center button 
and menu button simultaneously for a few seconds and it resets.  That's 
always worked when it's locked up.

Do you really think the world is out to get you?  Do you think people 
design products to shut down and wipe your disk out of spite?

I assure you that the kid at the Apple store doesn't care one way or 
another what you do with your iPod.

What happened was a side-effect of updating the firmware and the iTunes 
database.  If you mount your iPod now and compare the file structure to 
what it looks like when you've initialized gtkpod, you'll see what I mean.

It is entirely possible to install and run Linux on the Xbox with only
a software mod (using the original Mechassault) and still play games
through the dashboard.  It is my understanding this is detectable
through Xbox Live though.  The Xbox Linux web site
(http://www.xbox-linux.org) has more information.

The install is really only worth it if:

a) You already have an Xbox or otherwise want to play (original) Xbox games
b) Want to use digital media in your home entertainment system -AND-
c) Don't want to purchase a separate more up-to-date box to perform b)

It's hard.  And not very exciting.  And all the developers have moved
on to bigger/better/whatever projects.  I installed the software mod
about two years ago and used it for a month or two, then lost
interest.  Currently an iPod fills most of the functionality I thought
the Xbox would be good at.

Thanks for the suggestion. I looked at the web site. It is not at all
what I need. 

What I need is to figure out how to get Treeform (which runs in Java)
to run on my Linux computer. I installed it, but it did not create a
launch entry. I can't figure out how to launch it. The files it
installed all have different names, and none appears to be the
executable. I just need to know what a Java executable is supposed to
look like. Or the launch script, if that is how it launches.

Sorry, that is not what is causing the problem. It happens with seven
or eight different headphones, including the original iPod headphones
and two more purchased from Apple. You can't convince me that I have
that many bad plugs. Besides, the same headphones work fine on all
other equipment. Furthermore, this particular problem is pretty well
documented on the internet. 

Mind you, you may be right that there is no motion detector. Instead it
may be the bad hard drive connection that m0gely pointed out. In either
case, it will stop suddenly and hitting the Pause button restarts it
every single time, without fail. If it were a headphone connection
problem at least some of the time the Pause button would not restart it.

Yep. Been there, tried that. The Perl utilities did not work. They were
designed for an iPod on Firewire. If it's a USB iPod, no go. At the
moment I can't find the link to the utilities to see if they have been
updated.

It's not locked up when it stops playing. Hitting the Pause button
makes it continue. No reset is necessary.

> Do you really think the world is out to get you?  Do you think people

No, only Apple is out to get me. Actually that is not entirely true.
They don't care about me at all. They just want to be sure they get as
much money out of me they possibly can. And the kid at the Apple store
had only one goal: Get me out of the store so he could wait on the
backlog of customers waiting in line.

Yeah, I am home from tonight's meeting and I plugged it in and went to
mount it. Unfortunately I am unable to mount it. As far as I can tell
it no longer has FAT32 file system on it. To verify, I plugged it into
my Windows 2000 computer, which told me it was not formatted.

Well, I have to go back to the university tomorrow, so I'll take it
back to the Apple store. How much you wanna bet they will tell me they
are unable to format it FAT32 and it's my responsibility?

We use our modified XBox every day.  We run XBMC, though.

I think a set-top box with quality TV output for ~$80 is a deal.  I put a 
120GiB disk in mine, but mostly use it to stream video from one of the 
cluster of servers and desktop machines on the local network (shared with 
my neighbors, of course).  We pool our network resources and whatever 
we've downloaded or ripped is made available for everyone at any time. 
Quite convenient.

Furthermore, the interface is simple enough that my non-technical 
roommates can navigate the system and watch videos or listen to music 
whenever they like.

> Currently an iPod fills most of the functionality I thought the Xbox 
> would be good at.

Between XBoxes and the Turtle Beach Audiotron that someone gave me from a 
dumpster, We no longer need to use the iPods as a music source in the main 
rooms.

There are still iPod docks in the kitchen and garage, though.  And, of 
course, they are much handier than an XBox when you're biking around town!

As soon as I get that USB 2.0 turntable, I'll probably ditch all of my 
stereo equipment except for a couple of amplifiers and speakers.  I really 
can't imagine I'll need another CD player besides a CDROM and I haven't 
used a cassette in years.  Hell, even my collection of Minidisc equipment 
goes untouched except for the occassional field recording (which is rarer 
and rarer in my own life and should probably be replaced with an iRiver or 
something in the future).

Anyway, that's how media is done at my place.  And I'm helping all my 
friends get cheap old XBoxes for modding while the gamers all buy up 360s.

Seems unlikely, but the loose connection could be in the jack (as I 
originally stated).

The issue I'm describing wouldn't effect the performance of the 
headphones.

Yeah, it's a common thing.  The auto-pause feature is flakey as hell.

Mine was doing it from about the third month of iPod use until about the 
seventh.  Then I got another new set of headphones (I'm always damaging 
the cords in some irreparable way) and no more trouble.

HUH?!?  That doesn't follow at all.

The issue is (in my speculation) that a short or power fluctuation of some 
kind is triggering the auto-pause feature.  Pressing pause again will 
CERTAINLY resume play (even if the headphones are not attached).

Yeah, if you followed the thread of conversation, you'd note that I was 
referring to the trouble you had when the system "wouldn't shut off".  My 
comment wasn't related to the auto-pause events.

I ask again, did you try to do a soft reset when the thing wouldn't shut 
off this afternoon?

Well, I'm glad you recognize that much.

That's capitalism for you.  Hopefully we'll solve that problem sooner 
rather than later.

Not quite.  If he just wanted you out of the store, he wouldn't have 
offered to update your firmware for you.  That didn't get you out of the 
store sooner and didn't result in any further sales that could possibly 
garner him commission.  He did that as a service to you.

And deliberately erasing your music wouldn't make his life easier in any 
way whatsoever.  In fact, it might even make you come back and bitch 
later, which is counterproductive.

That bites.

You can use an HFS iPod, if you've configured your system for it.  But I 
also have my iPod formatted FAT32 just for universality as portable 
storage.

You kind of can't blame the kid, though.  He probably did the firmware 
update (which reformats the disk -- as you should know) on a Mac (I can't 
imagine he has much choice at The Apple Store).  Definitely make sure you 
let them know you want it "Windows Format".  There's no reason to get 
technical about it.  They'll understand what you mean.

> to the Apple store. How much you wanna bet they will tell me they are

Well, they MIGHT be able to do it.  But really, you can just download the 
little firmware update utility and run it from the desktop of one of the 
computers at the university library.  (I don't think it needs special 
permissions or to actually "install" to run, so you shouldn't have to 
worry about the security settings of the host computer.)

A nice courtesy might be letting the folks at the store know that you had 
it formatted FAT32 and their update changed that condition.  They should 
definitely know to ask or just note the format and do the right thing.

If you can find a somefile.jar file, try:

Bill,

   Yes. The GIMP doesn't know how to open .ico files.

i had two dead 675's .. all from Qwest as replacements
the 678 they gave me has not died .. about 3 yrs old. if any
thing the powersupplies from the 675's can be used on the
$5 678's you find once in a while at thrift stores.

Being gun shy i have a 2nd 678 all configured sitting next
to the primary 678.

Someday i want to change from the 678 to ???? so i can get
decent SNMP data.

Look at:
    http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=446744

or the short answer is

    winicontoppm

Nate says it is on his Slakeware system.  It's on my FC4.

Don't give me too much credit.  Google is my friend.  I just knew 
someone else had to have run into this before and it was the second item 
on a search for 'gimp ico file'.

   Rod's lesson for today was invaluable. For some reason, 'man winicontoppm'
failed to unbzip2, but a simple 'winicontoppm favicon.ico favicon.ppm'
worked. The GIMP scaled it from 32x32 to 16x16 pixels, and then it was time
to convert back. The syntax for that is different: 'ppmtowinicon -output
favicon.ico favicon.ppm'.

   I wonder how many thousands of other useful gems are buried under the
overburden on my system.

Thanks, Rod!

Rod,

   I didn't put those words into a search; no wonder I didn't find anything.

   After all that effort, too, the silly thing doesn't display! The default
paper page is gone, but there's no little image on the URL line. I put the
favicon.ico in both /var/www/htdocs/ and /var/www/htdocs/appl-ecosys/, but
when I load index.shtml, there's no little picture. Ha-rumph!

Thanks,

Rich

What size is the ico file?  It has to be 16x16, I think.  It is very 
picky about the size and color depth of the icon.

Alan,

   The original .ico was 32x32; that's why I needed to scale it. The new one
is 16x16. Identify confirms it's that size, but does not report the color
depth. The file is 1kb in bulk.

   I'll redo the conversions and see what the color depth is. Stay tuned for
an update ...

   The image information tells me it's RGB, True Color, with a depth of 24.
I've gone through each menu and the GIMP Icon tutorial and cannot find where
I can set the color depth. That used to be a menu item; it must be well
hidden now.

Thanks, Alan,

Icons for favicon.ico need to be 16 colors.

Every time I have updated the firmware on my iPod the songs have
disappeared.  Did it twice, and now I don't update the firmware anymore.

Recently I went to the Apple store in Pioneer square to have a display
problem with my iBook G4 looked at.  It was the best person to person
technology customer experience I have ever had.  None of the "we don't
support that so it's your problem stuff, no cost, no hassle, very fast".
They even backed-up my HD prior to sending it to get serviced.  I got it
back in 3 days (which beat the pants off Best Buy's "two weeks") and
everything was as it was supposed to be, including my data.

Alan,

   I found that yesterday and installed png2ico. I just re-did the conversion
using --colors 16, and it still does not display. Hmmm-m. Think I'll give up;
it's a very minor thing.

Thanks,

Rich

Weird. Did you try the html option at the bottom of that page?

You'll definately need a 678 although its been EOL'd for years now so
obviously there's very little if any support for it.

Subject: [PLUG] Asterisk hardware question
Message-ID: <20060602181127.GC24074@merlot.com>

I'm playing with Asterisk, and have been looking at the Sipura SPA-3000
and the Digium TDM cards. For the same functionality (1 FXO + 1 FXS,
which is all I need currently) the Sipura is about half the price. 

Considering voice quality only, is the Digium card worth the extra
bucks?

Now considering everything you know to be important about the Asterisk
analog interface (which will include lots of things I haven't yet
discovered), what would you buy and why?

For now, this is a personal project, but some people I know in New
Orleans are looking for a massive voicemail system (on a budget, of
course) and I think Asterisk might be a solution for them. If you
Asterisk experts have any favorite links on setting up secure voicemail
systems, please feel free to share them!

Thanks.

And other ATAs are even cheaper than the Sipura, especially if you don't
need WAN-passthrough and suchlike.  Atcom and some others offer ATAs
with 4 FxS ports, or even a mix of FxO and FxS ports, with failover.
(So you can e.g. plug your landline into the FxO, and if the ATA dies,
it cuts the landline through to one of the FxS ports.)

http://www.voip-info.org has a list of ATAs and other line-interface
devices.  Did'ja know there's devices that let you plug a bunch of
digital PBX phones into your Asterisk box?  Swap out old PBX, swap in
new super-powerful VoIP-enabled soft-PBX, leave the phones in place.

It's just as crappy as any other phone-line interface in my experience,
without the flexibility and reusability of a separate ATA.

> Now considering everything you know to be important about the Asterisk

An ATA, unless maybe I needed to handle FAXes.  Which should just be
left to a landline anyway; FAXes are used by folks who sign contracts,
run payroll and approve purchases, and thus are Not To Be Meddled With.

The aforementioned voip-info.org, and http://www.oreillynet.com/etel/

Asterisk's voicemail system might not be as flexible or powerful as you
might need for a "massive" system, though using multiple Asterisk boxes
with a clustered database backend might help.  There are many other more
flexible software packages.  Also, remember that T1s are way cheaper
inside a CLEC's hosting center (e.g. ELI's facility by the airport) than
backhauled to your office.

I tried that, but it did not work either. Later I discovered that you
have to switch the lock button on and off first, then hold down the
Select and Menu buttons. Had I been able to remember the secret code I
might have succeeded in resetting it.

Well, I spent an hour on it this morning. Evidently the only way I can
get it back to FAT32 is to use the iPod Updater utility. iTunes will
format an HFS iPod only the first time it is plugged into a Windows
computer. Thereafter it does not see it as a Mac iPod that needs to be
converted. It just doesn't see it at all. I know this because I went to
my Windows 2000 desktop where I downloaded and installed iTunes 6.0
just for this purpose. No way can I get iTunes to see the iPod as long
as it is HFS. 

Then I went to the Apple forums, created a username, and posted my
query there. There have been several replies already, which confirm
that the Updater utility is the only way to get it back to FAT32 now.
And the Updater utility will not install on my Windows 2000 desktop
because it is only SP2. The Updater requires SP4. I've tried and tried
to install SP4 but it always aborts at the last minute. Microsoft has
no idea why. "This cannot happen if your current system is running" is
all their tech support can tell me. Anyone wondering why I want to move
to Linux?

So at this point I have only three options. 1) Go back to the Apple
store and ask them to reformat it "for Windows." 2) See if I can get
the Updater to install on a computer at PSU. 3) See if I can get my
Ubuntu-64 Breezy computer to read/write the HFS file system and just
leave it as a Mac iPod. 

I checked the Updater utility and what you download is an .exe file
that evidently installs the Updater over the internet. Not sure how the
university computers will take that. I could download the .exe file
here and put it on my thumbdrive, but I don't know if that will make
any difference. It will still need to go out to the net and install it
on the university computer.

Bill,

   Yes, it has. The procedure is .ico through winicontoppm to .ppm. In the
GIMP, change scale from 32x32 to 16x16; save as .png. Run that through
'png2ico filename.ico --colors 16 filename.png', then add the img lines to
the head section of each page as suggested by the png2ico web page.

   I'm sure the rescaling and converstion from .ppm to .png could be done with
ImageMagick, and the whole process scripted.

   So, now the little eye candy favicon is on all pages of my site. That
strangled some of this morning, but now I'm back to writing a couple of
lectures complete with giveaway text and the visuals for the talks.

Thanks,

Rich

Atcom doesn't seem to be as easy to find as the Sipura ATAs; froogle
finds 33 matches for atcom (including about 8 that are really a book on
dive travel locations!) where 'sipura spa-3000', a far more restrictive
search, finds 26 completely relevant listings.

Is this a brand that you prefer? Where do you buy them?

I'm still looking there, but I'm also looking for direct experience.

Hmm. How do they get so much money for those cards, then? Maybe I should
buy a x100p clone and a couple of FXS-only ATAs?

Yes, I need to handle faxes. My office is small, and I do some small but
critical amount of faxing. For incoming faxes it looks like Asterisk can
be configured to receive the doc, convert it to PDF and email it. That's
very cool. But for the outgoing faxes, I guess I'll need a way to get
those out. Unless I buy a scanner and plan to email PDFs...

Lots to read on both. I have been reading voip-info, but missed the
O'Reilly site. Thanks.

All I need (as far as I know now) is thousands of extensions (VMboxes)
with PIN protection, and maybe over-the-phone provisioning. All
connections can be via SIP, so no analog interfaces will be required. I
think a box in a colo cabinet would do the job, with a big RAID for
storage.

Thanks. This is useful.

Message-ID: <459135778.1149280193870.JavaMail.root@fepweb14>

I talked to the group last night about Eclipse and the Portland area codecamp coming up.

Here's the link to more information. (This is excerpted from mail from Jason Mauer.)

Portland Code Camp 2.0

pdx.techevents.info/codecamp/2/default.aspx

Howdy campers! Mark off your calendars for this July 22nd and 23rd, because Code Camp is coming back to Portland bigger and better than ever!

It?s actually ?Portland Metro??

This year we?re venturing across the river as our friends in the Couv host our second annual Code Camp. WSU Vancouver has provided their facilities for our use, which are well suited for our needs. Tons of space, great classrooms (all with projectors), a beautiful campus, ample parking? it?s got it all!

The Plans As They Stand

?         Two-day Code Camp like last year (Saturday, Sunday)

?         Saturday evening ? onsite outdoor party with live music, food and fun

?         With the help of contributors, we are hoping to provide free meals for the duration of the camp ? stay tuned

 

Attending

Attendance is free as always but space is limited, so to guarantee your spot you?ll need to register. It?s just one click after creating your account ? register now!

 

Presenting

Session submission is now an automated process. On the right side of the sessions page (which you should check out first to make sure your session idea isn?t a duplicate) there is a link to submit a session. 

 

One feature we?ve added to sessions this year is tagging. Categorize your session with whatever tags you think best describe it, and people can find your session using the same tags on the sessions page.

 

Blogging

Speaking of tagging, if you?re blogging about Portland Code Camp 2.0 (which I hope is the first thing you do after reading this email and registering to attend :), please use the tag ?pdxcodecamp? if you?re into that Technorati sort of thing. Blog about Code Camp and help spread the word!

 

Contributing

Looking for other ways to contribute besides blogging? If you would like to chip in to help make Portland Code Camp 2.0 happen, please email Stuart Celarier, Camp Director.  Time, ideas, effort and money are all appreciated.

 

Techevents.info

The kickoff of Portland Code Camp 2.0 is also the debut of Techevents.info, a site that provides free services for technical events like this one. Since the site is in ?beta? (a la Google) and this Code Camp is its first hosted event, there may be the occasional bug or two. If you run into issues, oddities, bugs, etc. please email me and let me know.

 

This discussion list (the Portland Code Camp Yahoo! group) will be sticking around a little while longer as we get forums and feeds going on the Techevents.info site. In the mean time, keep an ear on the list and an eye on the Portland Code Camp 2.0 site.


 

See you at Code Camp!

 

-Jason

Made some progress this afternoon. It suddenly occurred to me that the
only time iTunes saw a Mac-formatted iPod and offered to format it was
the very first time. I assumed that it had something to do with the
iPod. But then I wondered if it might have to do with the version of
iTunes. I rummaged around, found the original iTunes CD that came with
the iPod. Then I plugged the iPod in the Windows desktop and put the CD
in the drive. Voila! It popped up a window notng that it was a Mac iPod
and offering to format it for Windows. I let it continue. After it
finished I dismounted it, then plugged it into the Linux laptop. After
fiddling with dmesg a bit I managed to get it mounted. And it
definitely seems to be mounted. When I open Konqueror and go
to /media/iPod (the mount point) it finds the folders. When I dismount
it the list of folders in the Konqueror window immediately disappears.

Unfortunately, now I can't that flaky gtkpod to see it and restore my
mp3s to it. No documentation for gtkpod. When I add an mp3 to the list
in gtkpod and click on sync, it fails to do anything. The problem may
be my failure to understand the functions of the various windows in
gtkpod. I also don't understand what the error messages mean. That's
because I don't really understand how the iTunes database works
(supposed to work).

Glad to hear my experience was unusual. At least I hope it was.

Plesk is nice if not a bit spendy I am a fan of h-sphere and it gets rave
reviews in the web hosting industry as well. You really can't go wrong with
either of them in my opinion. I avoid theplanet like the pluage, they have
severe issues with being on e-mail blackhole lists and other less then
appealing issues.

If the service is absolutely mission critical then price shouldn't be an
option and I would personally go with rackspace in that situation, but you
do get to pay for them ;)

Serverbeach is a great dedicated host, they are extremely reliable and
inexpensive, they also offer plesk, cpanel or ensim with their packages
which start at 99.00 bucks. The one I quickly priced out was 129.00 with
plesk 7.1 plus a 59.00 setup fee bringing to startup total to 208 for the
first month and 129.00 each month after that. if your are unsure as to which
control panel you'd like you can talk to them and they will let you test out
the 3 that they offer.

there are a lot of options out there of course, but I've had great
experiances with both companies.

Subject: [PLUG] Small Footprint CMS systems
Message-ID: <20060603054257.GA8526@gate.kl-ic.com>


Last night at the general PLUG meeting we had a little bit of
discussion about Content Management Systems (CMS).  Somebody
mentioned the sites http://cmsmatrix.org/ and http://cmswatch.org/
Interesting review sites, and a lot of data.  Thanks for the tip!
Not much size/resource/speed data, though.

I have an opportunity to deploy a very simple CMS for an educational
non-profit locally; there was an offer to host it on a Plone server
last night.  One portion of the sub-site may be maintained by middle
school students, and Plone's granular permission structure and
workflow management would be ideal. 

Also Plone is built on Zope and on Python, and while my heart
belongs to Perl, I suspect Perl and Python and Ruby are all a
little more tolerant of spotty security upgrades than the PHP
that the vast majority of the open source CMS's seem to be 
written on.  Maybe "good" PHP is secure, but how does one judge
the goodness of PHP code in a CMS?

If that Plone server offer doesn't work out, and the site must go
on a low cost virtual server, there will likely not be enough RAM to
run a big footprint CMS like Plone.  I was wondering if there are
any CMS's out there that have the same workflow as Plone, but are
known to have a small memory footprint.  Any suggestions?

Keith

PS - Assuming Apache and mail server and such are loaded, "footprint"
means how much more RAM is gobbled up when the CMS and supporting
tools are loaded, compared to when they are not.  Not a difficult
test, but quantitative (count the megabytes) as compared to "I have
a GByte of RAM and I don't notice it" kinds of non-answers.

Subject: [PLUG] Mounting iPod, gtkpod, and permissions
Message-ID: <20060602234513.c07b6492.johnxj@comcast.net>

I finally managed to get my iPod reformatted with FAT32. iTunes on
Windows can place files on it. However, I can't find the magic
combination to get it mounted on Linux with appropriate permissions so
gtkpod can read and write to it.

I can mount it and unmount it just fine. But when I try to sync music
files to it with gtkpod I get various error messages, all indicating
that writing to or reading from the iPod failed. Sometimes the error
messages says I don't have permission. The reason I say there are
various error messages is because I have tried various things and each
one gives me somewhat different errors. It appears, however, that the
main problem (probably the only problem) is permissions and ownership.
I dimly recall going through this before.

It is /dev/sda2 mounted at /media/iPod.

Fixing it eludes me. I opened Krusader as root and peered at
the /media/iPod folder. Originally it said that it was owned by root
and that no one could read/write to it but root. Now, that doesn't make
a lot of sense to me. Before the recent disasters at the Apple store I
was able to read/write to it just fine with gtkpod once I mounted it,
and that was as just plain ol' user jjj.

Another issue that confluxes me is that it is now formatted FAT32. I
thought FAT32 had no ability to handle permissions and ownership.

Konqueror indicated that root was the owner of /media/iPod. I always
log in as jjj, so I changed the ownership to jjj. However, that seems
to be of little or no use.

Amy suggestions for being able to talk to it?

Roughly translated:  The main thread of your program took exception to 
not finding a defined class named "sun.misc.Launcher".

Given the gnu.java messages about missing "sun.java" something, I would 
guess that the app may not be compatible with GNU's java (or at least 
that the version you have doesn't have everything it needs yet.)  It's 
possible that you can install that class and be done -- this assumes 
that sun's java classes will run on gnu's java (might work if it's 
turtles all the way down.)

You might have to get sun's Java, but check with the app's faq about jvm 
compatibility.

Message-ID: <20060603155259.GA16186@gate.kl-ic.com>


I got a flier in the mail for a franchise outfit named "Geeks on Call".
They look like a Geek Squad clone.  Their list of competencies - for
Windows - is long, and their availability hours are decent.  The flier
was generated by the local franchise, and recommends Integra Telecom
as a provider, which shows local loyalties.  They also claim to support
MacOS and Linux (the national site doesn't mention this).

For those of us whose friends and relatives want us to fix their 
windows PCs, this could be a great relief, if they are competent.  Does
anyone here know about them?  Does anyone with a windows PC and more
money than time want to give them a try and report what they do?

It would be nice to tell friends and relatives "I will help you install
Linux.  I will help you maintain Linux.  I will not help you with 
Windows, because you should not be using that crap and it disgusts
me.  If you must run Windows in spite of that, call these guys for
support, not me."

So, are they any good?

Keith,

   Did Steve Ballmer call them for help with the machine he undertook to fix?
He might provide a reference.

it's all in the fstab line, the permissions of the mountpoint don't really 
matter, as they will be superposed by the permissions of the root node of the 
mounted filesystem as you mount it (a tad confusing, of course).

here's what my shuffle fstab line says:
/dev/sda1       /media/ishuffle             auto    noauto,user,rw 0 0

for an ordinarly ipod that would become:
/dev/sda2       /media/ishuffle             auto    noauto,user,rw 0 0


I let gtkpod handle the mounting/unmounting, and be done with it.

Thanks, I got it running! 

First I wandered all around Sun's site and even downloaded what appeared to be a self-extracting file to install JRE 1.4.2. But the installation instructions were a couple pages long. Worse, nowhere did it say that it would/would not install on 64-bit Linux. But then I found it listed in Synaptic. I installed it, and now I've got TreeForm running. Yay!

However, there is a small problem that I don't know much about. TreeForm will export trees as PNG or JPG, both as raster images at either 300 or 600 dpi, or save as XML. The XML seems to be its native format, and works just fine. However, if I try to export as JPG or PNG it gives me an error message that I did not allocate enough memory to Java to complete the operation. So one solution would be to figure out something to add to the launch command above to make it use more RAM (I've got 1.25 GB). 

A possibly better solution would be to figure out how to get an XML file to display as a graphic. PNG and JPG raster images kind of suck (not scalable, etc.). I  opened the .xml file in OpenOffice.org, but that just shows the XML code. I tried Insert > Picture, but XML is not a supported format, so the file doesn't appear in the dialog box. Ditto for Scribus. So I'm wondering if there are any XML gurus here who could give me some insight in how to translate the .xml file into some other vector format. Dia and Inkscape won't open it, Krita tries to open it, but needs some xsml file or something which I can't figure out, so it won't open it, and Sodipodi installs on my computer but won't run (segmentation fault). I would be happy to try something else if anyone has any suggestions. I just don't know enough about XML to understand how it works with graphics.

SVG is an XML format which will load in Firefox.  Look around and see
if you can find a TreeForm to SVG XSLT converter.

Thanks for the info. I looked in Synaptic and found xmlto, which is a
command line tool that might work. It says it is "xml to any." I
installed it but, after fiddling with it and reading the man page for
it, I think it is not capable of what I need.

I doubt that a TreeForm to anything converter exists. TreeForm might
have a couple hundred users worldwide. I thought XML was XML. Does it
matter what application created the XML?

And unicode is unicode.  It's just a bit more accessible than everybody 
making up their own binary formats, but that doesn't mean much if 
someone writes you a letter in Swahili.

XML is just a generic data container, so if you don't have a way to 
transform (i.e. via a treeform-specific xslt) to svg, then all you have 
is some data (albeit in a generic container format that's been hyped as 
the bee's knees.)

I had a line in fstab, but I #'d it and put yours in instead (changing
ishuffle to iPod). And now it works!

I had tried this before, but kept getting error messages. But now that
the (apparently) correct line is in fstab, it works. Much easier! I can
just plug in the iPod, wait a few seconds, and launch gtkpod. And then
closing gtkpod unmounts it. Except I still double-check from a command
line -- jerking an iPod out without unmounting it is a good way to
screw up the database.

Thanks for the help!

Keith,

I would recommend Absolute Computers for several reasons. The main 
reason is that it is my company. I do not support Linux at this time, 
but I will install it and configure it. (I am not a great troubleshooter 
of Linux but am learning.)

1. Guaranteed resolution.
2. Guaranteed work.
3. Guaranteed Competent  Technicians
4. Guaranteed Satisfaction
5. They have an excellent track record.

Hourly rates are reasonable. $75 first hour / $60 (billed in ten minute 
increments after first hour.) Unlike many companies out there, we do not 
reinstall first, unless it is the most appropriate solution. In the 3 
1/2 years I have been in business, I have lost only 1 customer.

The website is www.rocksolidservice.com

Hope that helps. BTW, I can tell you who not to use....
Geeksquad
Geeks a knockin
Belmont Computers

I have followed them after they have 'fixed' something ... there were 
some REALLY stupid mistakes made... such as cpu's not secured, ram not 
clipped, spyware supposedly removed, but still existing in ...\temp and 
\content.ie5


I just about always introduce my customers to Linux. (depending on their 
abilities)

TreeView probably requires the Sun Java runtime instead of the Free
Software GCJ/Classpath one that ships w/ Ubuntu and Fedora.

Dapper includes the Sun JRE/JDK in the multiverse repo, from what I understand.

Thanks. Well, I'm not going to install Dapper, tempted as I am, until after classes are over and I get back from Mexico toward the end of the month. But then it will be at the top of my list!

Meantime I found the Sun JRE in Synaptic, so I just installed it and TreeForm is now running fine, using the command line syntax that you gave me earlier.

The only problem is that its native format is XML, which Krita might be able to convert to something if I had an xsl-something or another file. Krita says it needs such a file and won't process the .xml without it. I have xslt-proc installed, and Krita documentation seems to say that will do, but I can't find a way to point Krita to where the file is located. If I try to navigate to the folder where it is located Krita either doesn't even see the folder, or it crashes. :(

So I guess my only option is to use the crappy JPG or PNG export output from TreeForm. It's supposed to do either one in 300 or 600 dpi, but all I can get it to do is JPG at 300 dpi. The others say I need to allocate more RAM to Java. Is there a way from the command line (an option or something) to tell Linux to open the .jar file and use more RAM?

Naw, it's just an inexpensive Chinese OEM-style critter that's useful if
you plan to sell lots or need something other than a 2-FxS ATA.

Digiums are low-volume and cheezy, but cheaper than Dialogic and they're
useful if you want it all integrated into one box.

You can assemble a system that way, but the fact is that a plain ol'
landline-connected FAX machine does the job, works even if the system's
down, and makes instant sense to anyone else who tries to use it.  One
of those Multifunction Peripherals covers it and gives you scanning and
color printing, too.

Also, FAX over VoIP is touch-and-go and isn't likely to improve much.

Ya just gonna rent a termination number and pay by the minute?  Not a
bad way to do it, and you can rent terminations in other LATAs too, and
even a toll-free number.

Glad to hear it.

Subject: [PLUG] Dapper Drake CDs
Message-ID: <20060604194113.f2cdaf38.johnxj@comcast.net>

I just ordered Dapper Drake CDs for the Clinic. However, they have
changed their order page. Now you must order a particular mix of CDs,
and none of the selections exceed a total of ten. I ordered:

5 32-bit
3 64-bit
2 Mac

I did it that way because I know I will want to keep one of the 64-bit
ones, and AJ may want to keep one of the Mac ones. That leaves us with
two of the 64-bit and one Mac CD, which will probably hold us for a
long time. However, the 5 32-bit ones may not be enough. 

Because they have changed the order page, I can't order any more on my
account. Someone else ought to go there and order 10 32-bit CDs. And
they take a long time to get here from France, plus they may be
backlogged with Dapper Drake just released the other day, so someone
should do this right away.

Yay!  I've burned a 6.06 LTS disc, and I expect FG will be getting
several boxes.

It's a little frustrating that the next Clinic is immediately after
finals week, but if I can finally get off my butt and post some flyers
around PSU, maybe we can get some new folks in.

(It's crunchtime right now, 4 weeks of schoolwork to do in about a week.)

Lemme see if I can update my version of the flyer and put it up for
review.

Anyone have access to the PLUG wiki?  Do I?

Thanks,

I am currently running kubuntu 5.10 BreezyBadger Release i386.

Checking https://wiki.kubuntu.org/KubuntuDapperKnownProblems

Look at about mid-page, Upgrading Problems.  It seems the upgrade wipes the 
desktop.  The work-around is:

sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop.

But if you look at the bug reports it seems that others had problems with the 
work-around.  And those others knew enough to respond to the requests for more 
information.

If I lost the desktop I would be without a computer, so I could not even get to 
ask a question.

What is a newbie to do? A stable, supported system is what I want, but getting 
it seems hazardous.

I just upgraded two Breezy systems to Dapper, one AMD-64 and one i386. I 
didn't experience anything like in the bug report. There were a few minor 
glitches, like printing is still fuxx0red but fixable, and some of my personal 
configs got stomped. So be sure your dotfiles and /etc are backed up. 

I did the upgrade the standard Debian way: edited my /etc/apt/sources.list to 
include only official Dapper repositories, did apt-get update, pt-get 
upgrade, and apt-get dist-upgrade. It went smoothly on both systems, even my 
highly-tortured main workstation which I use and abuse in all manner of 
creative ways.

I noticed that none of the sources.list examples in the bug reports included

deb http://kubuntu.org/packages/kde352 breezy main

You need that to get the correct KDE-Kubuntu packages.

If you want to upgrade I would suggest bringing your system in to the
PLUG Clinic at Freegeek on the third Sunday of the month from 1-5pm.
The next one will be 6/18/2006.  There you will find willing experts
and plenty of Dapper Drake media (from the sounds of things) who could
help you get through the upgrade.

John,

I ordered 10 Dapper i386. I can pass some to the free clinic.

That's a serious problem with many Linux packaging systems. One of the
main reasons I still say it isn't "enterprise ready."

Does anyone know if this is expected with debian? Or is it a result of
some ubuntu weirdness?

Not enterprise-ready?? Are you nuts?? I mean, my dear sir, I beg to differ

I have never had my configs get overwritten by an upgrade in vanilla
debian. If I have made a modification to a system-wide configuration
file, I am notified and given the opportunity to choose the old file,
the new one, view a diff, or spawn a shell to examine the situation
myself. If I have made a modification to a config file in my home
directory, it is silently left as is.

Me wonders why more distros don't use the newer "rolling release" package
managers ;-)  Very "enterprise ready".

Aw yes, the joys of fonts and Linux.

My experience is from _many_ years ago but I do remember having to run 
several commands to 'prep' the fonts, directories and friends; followed 
by having to restart the font server.

What X sees is probably not what OOo sees and maybe a bit of what the 
GIMP sees, but Scribus may see something else.

Good luck!

Clearly, there are no "enterprise ready" OSes and never will be.  But
never mind that, what about support for such critical Enterprise-grade
features as photon torpedo targeting and dilithium power management?

Ya think Engineering would be able to pull off their incredible
cliffhanger hacks if everything ran on closed-source software?

Maybe the OSDL's working on it,

Rod,

   OO.o, Scribus, and LyX see all the installed fonts (atm, TrueType, Type1,
Speedo, URW, etc.). GIMP doesn't. And those it does see look all alike.

   Well, the libs might have been istalled, but there were apparently many
required pieces missing. I downloaded the latest (2.3.95) fontconfig, built,
and installed it.

   Closed the GIMP and re-invoked it, et voila! All fonts now visible. Sure
had me fooled.

Because it's easy to get around the "modifications" and turn it back

Carla,

I just did the same thing.  I edited my sources.list to show all dapper.
Then I did the apt-get update...apt-get upgrade...apt-get dist-upgrade 
thing...then I went and read the Ubuntu wiki...

The last line in the upgrade section says:

EXTREMELY IMPORTANT! Make sure you type  dist-*upgrade*  rather than 
 *upgrade* . The process will totally hose your machine and render it 
*completely unbootable* otherwise.

I think I know why my system is running sooooo slooooowly now.
I am currently burning a dapper cd to do a fresh install.

Check your color depth in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf or XF86Config file.
You may have 8 or 16 selected.  You might chose 24 or 32 as your color
default under the Screens section.

That doesn't even make sense, because it's routine Debian maintenance to run 
apt-get upgrade regularly. I have it in a daily cron job. That's how you get 
updates and patches without pain, and keep everything current. At what magic 
point must you stop before running a dist-upgrade? I'm starting to think 
Ubuntu folks don't understand Debian very well.

The interesting thing I noted was that my machine booted.  It is just 
running very slowly.  Could it be that Dapper is just too much for a 933 
dually?

Subject: [PLUG] Linux and Unicode
Message-ID: <20060605223301.a5c75513.johnxj@comcast.net>

OK, supposedly my Ubuntu-64 Breezy computer is all Unicode compliant
and stuff. At the same time, evidently most of the programs I run on it
are not. The big ones seem to be - OpenOffice.org, Scribus, inter alia,
but some important little ones are messing up bigtime. On the other
hand, maybe the problem is not related to Unicode. I'd like to report
to the developers, but I'm not sure how to state the problem.

Case in point: Over the weekend I edited the tags for a little over 300
classical pieces before restoring them to my iPod. I used EasyTag. The
process went just fine. Except that before actually uploading them to
the iPod I needed to go to the university, which meant I had to close
EasyTag. The edited tags looked fine when I closed it, but when I
reopened it later many with "foreign" characters were badly hosed. You
don't want to know how Antonin Dvo??k's name came out. All I will say
is that I don't think he spelled his name with a copyright symbol. The
weird part is why the tags looked fine when I closed EasyTag, but after
EasyTag reopened the files, it displayed them incorrectly. I mean, if
it couldn't display the character properly, then why did it display
properly when I entered it from the keyboard?

I decided I'd just re-edit the offending tags in gtkpod before syncing
to the iPod. I opened gtkpod, but quickly noticed that I must have set
the "Always automatically screw things up" option to Yes. It took a
while, but I finally managed to get it to delete its database, which I
think was based on the files before I edited them. Then I re-opened all
the files. That was even worse. Everything that was not one of the keys
on an American typewriter came out as a space. Dvo??k came out Dvo  k.
So now we have a different issue -- EasyTag substitutes something else,
and gtkpod just deletes.

What I'm trying to figure out is what is going on. There are different
kinds of problems. Some programs react one way, some another. I read
all I can about Unicode, but the literature about Unicode on the net
does not explain what to do when applications can't take Unicode
characters. At least, I couldn't find it.

Does anyone have any idea what I am talking about?

In a terminal window (xterm or whatever you normally use), run the 
locale utility. It'll tell you what language and character set your 
shell environment are using. E.g.,

[/tmp]$ locale
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_COLLATE=C
LC_MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_PAPER="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_NAME="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_ADDRESS="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_TELEPHONE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MEASUREMENT="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_ALL=

If your LC_CTYPE variable doesn't end in '.UTF-8', then you're 
probably not getting full Unicode support. I've got some notes on all 
this online:

   http://www.madboa.com/geek/utf8/

One easy test is to launch EasyTag under temp environment:

   LANG=en_US.UTF-8 easytag

If that does the trick, then you'll want to alter your default shell 
environment.

If you still have troubles, let me know. Debian-based systems use some 
non-obvious tricks -- like relying on /etc/locale.gen -- that might 
need some explanation.

   Yesterday I upgraded firefox from -1.5.0.3 to -1.5.0.4. Today, the display
fonts are unaliased; they suffer badly from the jaggies. I cannot recall
seeing this for almost 20 years. I've selected 'system defaults' for the
resolution in Edit->Preferences, but that makes no difference. Has anyone
else seen this and come up with a solution?

   Also, the application now comes up displaying a firefox page telling me
that I've upgraded and am running the latest version. Well, no d'oh! My
configuration is set to open on a blank page, but that is being ignored. Has
anyone a fix for this, too?

Low overhead for setup/administration.

I set up Mambo, and I think it will be easy once set up.  But page 
creation, menu modification and linking it all together is not going to 
be something that an idiot can figure out.  Shouldn't be too hard with a 
little help though.  I have not spent much time with it really, but I 
can tell there is a proper way to do things with it.  I will be 
re-creating a web site on it when I have more time to sway my church 
from their current provider.  Ugh, they charge rent by the page, 
literally.  And set up fees for each new page.

A default installation of Ubuntu (since Hoary at least) installs the
"Updates" and "Security Updates" repositories, and whenever something
new shows up in one of them an icon appears on the Gnome panel. A user
who is even generally computer illiterate cannot help but click on it
to see where it came from and what it does, whereupon a window will pop
up telling the user there are updates available and prompting the user
to install them. This accomplishes the same thing as your daily cron
job function, yet the user doesn't even have to know what cron is. It's
features like this that make me love Ubuntu.

Kenneth,

Thanks for your response. I have 24 bit color selected. Unfortunately, 
the pointer is still a square block most of the time. I have been able 
to resolve most of the appearance by installing a mouse theme and 
applying it. Unfortunately, much of the time it still goes to the ugly 
block.... maybe there is a default theme that can be downloaded and 
applied?

i've started a Joomla! site at work. What I found
frustrating was a lack of a 'dummies for mambo/joomla'
or more a basic 'here is how it works', after getting
over the how the pages/data relationships work, i have
been very happy, both with the FOSS modules and one
of the commercial < $50 modules.

for granularity the base install isn't very good, but
there is a module/plug-in that gives what I think you
are looking for.

i have not tried it yet, and i can not compare it to
other CMS's since this is my first.

I would try WebGUI.  It has everything you're talking about

No dude.  If you have a hard drive with sensitive info on it, and you 
want to be 100% sure that information will never be accessed, you 
destroy the drive.  Think drills, hammers, grinders, vice grips, stump 
grinders, whatever.  But those platters shouldn't be in recognizable form.

There are also bootable disks you can download to format the drive in 
such a manner as to make sure everything is really gone, but it never 
ceases to amaze me the the next level of recovery companies are able to 
achieve.

Bill,

For the most part it is final, but not really. You can't just throw a 
live cd in and read the old contents. You have to remove the platters 
from the drive and they have to be read from special readers. I do not 
know of anyone who has this kind of service, though. It is VERY 
expensive, at least it used to be. It is doubtful that this user would 
want to spend the money on getting his files back, since he so easily 
made the decision to format the drive.

java -Xms=128 -Xmx=256 -jar /path/to/somefile.jar

-Xms is the initial ammount of memory to allocate, -Xmx is the max
size to use (of the heap, for both).

Re: the version of Java you have installed, if it isn't actually a
version of Sun's java, expect very odd behavior.  Most likely you
installed GCJ, which is a great idea, but just isn't there yet. (I'm
not saying you should worry about this right now, but it's worth
keeping in mind.)

Not after changing sources.lst... that's the key.
Do you really think they could have made such a usable system without

Subject: [PLUG] Viewing OpenOffice.Org Source Code
Message-ID: <20060606172146.GA25651@gate.kl-ic.com>


Is there anyplace to view OpenOffice.Org source code online,
without downloading the source? 

In particular, I want to look at the source for the GammaLN
function in the spreadsheet "calc" or "sc";  for X < 1E-6 or
so, it is unnecessarily inaccurate, and there are negative
values of X where GammaLN should be computable but isn't. 
That should be a quick hack to fix, since there are good ways
to manipulate this function mathematically to ease computation
( what is GammaLN? it computes the natural logarithm of the
gamma function.  What is the gamma function?  See:
  http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GammaFunction.html )

Of course, there is an additional problem, if the calculation
returns the mathematically correct value of GammaLN, but Excel
does not, then some might complain about the difference.  Mostly,
though, Excel just burps up an error when given small or
out-of-range arguments, and failing less often is usually better.

Thanks for that suggestion. My settings match yours exactly, except for
the COLLATE one, where you changed yours to C and mine is UTF-8, like
all the others. So I guess that is not where the problem lies.

Read it, didn't see anything that would help, but haven't taken the
time to go to the other links at the bottom of the page. Will explore
those later.

At first it didn't do the trick, but it did result in more information
about what is going on. EasyTag is set up to scan on startup the folder
where I keep my mp3s. (I'm also open to suggestions for other tag
editors, btw.)

So, having launched it with the above command, I scrolled to the files
for Dvo??k pieces, all of which started with Dvo??k. In case that did
not make it through the internet and our mail clients, that's
D,v,o,r-hacek(hex=159),a-acute-accent(hex=E1),k. The filename displayed
correctly, but EasyTag had hosed each instance of his name in the tags.
I selected his name from the filename and copied it to the clipboard,
then pasted it over his name in the tags, so each tag was now correct.
Then I saved all the changed tags. After saving each tag still looked
correct. Then I exited from EasyTag. After exiting I looked at the
terminal window and found the following very interesting error message
(repeated for each tag that I changed):

Updated tag of 'Dvo??k - Symphony #8 (Pe?ek).mp3'

** (easytag:17119): WARNING **: convert_string(): Failed conversion
from charset  'UTF-8' to 'ISO-8859-1'. String 'Dvo\305\231\303\241k -
The Golden Spinning Whe el'. Errcode 1 (Invalid byte sequence in
conversion input).

I deliberately selected this particular error message because on this
one I also had an s-hacek in the conductor's name. It appears that the
terminal window understands the characters. It also appears that
EasyTag was trying to convert UTF-8 to ISO-8859-1, whatever that is.

But in the middle of writing this I decided to reopen EasyTag and see
if I could fix it. Lo and behold, in the Preferences section there was
a checkmark next to "Convert characters to ISO 8859-1 (Recommended)."
Underneath was an option to convert from UTF-8 to whatever I wanted to
enter in a drop-down box. I changed it to convert from UTF-8 to UTF-8.
Then I re-edited the Dvo??k tags and saved them. And then I looked in
the terminal window and voil?! No error messages.

So the problem with EasyTag seems to be resolved. I have gone through
and fixed all the tags (again) and now EasyTag is saving them correctly.

The next trick will be to open gtkpod and see what happens when it sees
the files. Gtkpod is a big mystery to me. I know that some of its
features are broken -- e.g., editing tags. You can select in
Preferences to write back any tag edits to the file on disk, but it
does not do so. (Hence needing EasyTag.) More importantly, there is no
documentation and I find it hopelessly unintuitive. I don't understand
what the functions mean or even what is supposed to be displayed in
what window. But at least if it does not see the tags correctly, I'll
try launching it with the LANG= syntax from the command line. 

Thanks for the help. Making progress!

Users making Wiki entries might not be as clueful as devs. :) You are correct, 
not mentioning the bit about not running the 'upgrade' command after changing 
sources.list was a rather large omission. Thanks for posting it. I shall 
punish myself by having ice cream later instead of sooner.

Didn't work. Launches fine as it was, but adding "-Xms=128 -Xmx=256" in
there it won't launch at all. :(

I now have Sun. Found it in Synaptic, so installing was easy. TreeForm
works fine with it. (Except for the RAM issue when trying to export
raster images.)

If the drive doesn't power up then maybe.  On a normal functional drive 
that has been formated, even a few times, recovery of the deleted files 
is very easy using software readily available on the net.  Granted, it's 
a tedious task and not for the average joe, but any savvy administrator 
can do this.

Software to properly format the drive doesn't just format it.  It flips 
every bit on the drive several times to ensure the old information is 
not recoverable.  Normal formats do not do this. Even changing the file 
system from say, NTFS to EXT3 leaves things somewhat recoverable.

You need the "m".

One other thing I should mention; I have data recovery software but it
reported cyclic redudancy check errors with the drive.  It's a Seagate drive
and I ran a test and it came back fine, so I'm not sure if it's actually a
hardware problem or a mis-diagnosis.

Good lord no.  And Dapper needs a tad less RAM than Breezy, so it
shouldn't be that.  Is your Turbo button on? ;)

   Here's one for all you web development gurus: in the site.css file for my
new incarnation of the web site I have both header and footer divisions. I
want the background color of both to be maroon, so I specified color: #990033

   The header displays maroon-ish, but the footer -- on the same page -- is
more pink than is the header. Same value for the color. Any ideas why?

Thanks, but it still won't launch. Launches fine with just:

java -jar /home/jjj/software/treeform_0.2_windows/treeform/TreeForm.jar

Adding the memory options and launching from the command line I get:

Invalid initial heap size: -Xms=128m

So that's the problem, whatever that means. :)

Does it change when you change your viewing angle?

I haven't had a working Turbo button 
since...uhhhhmmmmm.....uhhhmmmm.....an AMD 386?????

I have had troubles downloading and burning a working Dapper CD.  I 
tried to do the upgrade and this is what happened.  It is on a separate 
hard drive.  I can still boot into Breezy...I just want the latest and 
greatest :~) in a working fashion.  I obviously have more to learn 
(which is a good thing!).
I am back to being a truck driver for the next 4 days.  I will won't 
have much time to play, but I do read posts to the PLUG list at 3-4 am 
when I get home.

Since Dapper requires less...more experimentation to follow!

Thanks,

Bruce

It should run fine, even with gnome or KDE. How much RAM do you have? 512 is 
great, 256 will work. Do you have a swapfile?

KDE has the nice ksysguard for a graphical view of all your running processes. 
If you don't have KDE, look for something similar. Or run 'ps -ejH' to get 
the command-line view of what's going on. Something is bogging your system 
down.

Also look at the end of /var/log/messages for any error messages. Drive 
seek errors will do bad things, as will misconfigured or bad video cards,

Although I've heard rumors that such levels of data recovery are
possible (e.g. after a disk wipe) I've never seen it actually done.
Have you?

For all practical purposes one pass of writing zeroes is enough to
thwart a data recovery.

It's not local (I don't know of any that are) but I've used OnTrack
(http://www.ontrack.com) and been pleased with them.

Since you've written a significant amount of data to the drive (the
new WinXP install) your chances of recovery are slim and the costs are
likely to be high.

That did it. Yay! And I just tested it and now I can export trees as

Subject: [PLUG] Converting MS Publisher files to anything else
Message-ID: <448602C6.1090802@comcast.net>

I have a set of .pub files that are provided as templates for my own 
use. Does anyone know of a tool to convert .pub files to something I can 
use without MS Publisher?

I installed Scribus, but learned from their Wiki that they have no plans 
to support importing .pub files. They provide a set of directions for 
how to get most of the information out of the document, but it starts 
with opening it with MS Publisher, which kind of defeats the purpose.

I'm open to other FOSS DTP tools besides Scribus. That's just the first 
one I came upon that my Google search (wrongly) hinted at being able 
deal with .pub files.

Dick,

   Don't think that there are others. Scribus is a great page layout
application. If you'll be using it heavily the translation effort may well be
worthwhile.

There are few that I know of and I have searched high and low for my own
use.

All are closed source expensive solutions.

The best bet would be to have a shop (I could do it for you) open them and
convert
Them to something else PDF perhaps.

How many are there?

I was afraid of that. I've asked the same question on the Scribus 
mailing list, but haven't heard back, yet (it's only been a half an hour 
or so!).

113. Probably more than I'd actually use, but until I look at them, I 
really don't know.

I think my sister has MS-Pub, so I'll probably have her export one or 
two to .pdf so I can look at them. If I need to get fancier, I'll be 
back in touch.

Thanks for the information!

I find that screenshots and the color picker tool in the gimp are
valuable tools when debugging the space between the computer and the
user.  (You can then compare the rgb values rather than worrying about
glare / angle / sunglasses / etc.)

Rogan,

   They were specified with the same strings: 'maroon' and '#800000'. In any
case, I decided that the colored footer looked junky; it was better to have
it open so I took off the background-color. Much better now.

Thanks,

Rich

Yes. I used to work just outside the data recovery lab at Symantec. I've 
also seen floppy disks reassembled after being cut with scissors.

I've even recovered data off hard drives, with shareware tools from 
download.com, after the Windows 98 drive was nuked and paved with linux.

Obviously you've never realized why the DOD requires 7 passes of a data 
scrambler for "secret" data, and more for "top secret".

and as a matter of fact, writing all zeroes (or any regular pattern) is making 
it *very* easy to recover the data ;^)

It has been almost a decade since the actual data save on the disk
resembles the data
you want.  It all gets encoded to ensure that you have a 'non-return
to zero' pattern on the
disk.

The company I work for (Mentor Graphics) is looking for a contractor to
migrate a large body of documentation from Framemaker to Wiki. Expertise in
Wiki is a must. Some knowledge of IC layout, electrical engineering, and
electronic design will be helpful (at least to understand the terminology).
Knowledge of the Framemaker is not mandatory. The job is in
Wilsonville.

If you're interested or know someone who is, contact me by e-mail.

Good thing none of us are still using or maintaining any hardware and 
software more than a decade old.... I mean, mainframes just get 
replaced every 3 years, just like laptops, right? And nobody would ever 
have the time, or money, to reverse engineer out how to "read" the 
altered data patterns?

In my previous gig this year (!) I was writing snort-compatible IDS 
script algo's for circa 1992 (IIRC) DG/UX 5.4.1 88K *minis* that run 
inside some class B scale networks... the old boxen die much harder 
than the new cheapness, and if a piece of data is worth, oh, several 
million (or billion) dollars, it's not a good idea to underestimate the 
bizarre extremes people would take to reconstruct it.

:-D

Personally, I find a good 7 passes over the platters with a 
sledge-hammer to be quite effective, though safety goggles are a must. 
One can induce randomness of zeros and ones by flipping over the 
platters every pass with the sledgehammer, or, for the extremely 
paranoid, a *magnetized* sledgehammer head might be a good toy.

A sledgehammer also looks pretty darned cool in a server room, but if 
working with buggy OS's, may need to be placed inside a "break glass 
only in case of extreme server frustration" case.

Hi Fedor,

We are a growing team of developers and sysadmins.  Do you envision
someone manually and repetitively migrating the data, or creating a tool
to migrate it en masse?

Thank you,
Will

Subject: [PLUG] Fontconfig
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0606071121040.2728@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Anyone here experienced with fontconfig? I installed -2.3.95 last week to
make the installed fonts visible to The GIMP. Now the display fonts on most
web pages (firefox-1.5.0.4) and in OO.o are terrible: jagged and difficult to
read. I suspect that fontconfig has something to do with this, but I don't
know how or what to do about it. However, uninstalling the application does
not make the fonts anti-aliased and easy to read.

   When I look at the docs, I get the impression that fontconfig is supposed
to make all installed fonts available to those applications that cannot find
them by themselves. This is apparently true for The GIMP. Now all installed
fonts are available there.

   Running fc-list shows me a huge list of fonts installed all over the place
(not only /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/).

   The poor rendition is hard on my eyes. I'd like to get the anti-aliased
fonts back again. Suggestions wanted.

Bruce,

That is the "easy" way to do it.... but not all packages can be 
automatically started using this method...

Is anti-aliasing working at all?  It is possible you didn't configure
anti-aliasing support when you built fontconfig.

Did you try rebuilding the font cache?  All the font directories have
a fonts.cache-1 file.  I wouldn't be surprised if the format changed
with the upgrade and the fonts aren't being found.  If the fc-list is
listing lots of fonts, then this may not be the problem.  The command
is fc-cache.

Next, check the fontconfig configuration in /etc/fonts.  You may have
overwritten the old configuration when installing it.

Ian,

   Good point. I didn't see that as an option when I checked 'configure
--help'.

   Yes, I did.

   These have been around a while:

We have established that Dapper should run well on this machine.  
Hopefully I will have some time this weekend to reboot to Dapper and 
follow some of the suggestions.

Thanks to all!

I've tried plone in an EDU environment, unless you plan on being committed
long term, or have someone there who is willing to completely learn the
system It's probably best to avoid using it. Don't get me wrong, I love
plone, but it is a major piece of software in my opinion and does need some
TLC from time to time.

I know you want to shy away from bad PHP, but not all PHP is bad ;). Drupal
is a very low overhead CMS that is extremely extensible and easily managed,
it has a sharp learning curve but can be done in probably a month of
consistent use. It also has big words like taxonomy and that is always a
plus for school students (LOL). Another one that I really like to use is
Joomla, they have a great development group and what seems to be a very
stable strategy. both are PHP but to my knowledge neither of them have been
victim to large scale attacks.

there is a lot of software out there that will allow you to recover some
files from formatted media, but if your really serious about it your best
bet is to get the professionals involved. Give http://www.ontrack.com/ a
look they have been able to do amazing things and have software available
that is able to undelete almost anything but you will pay for the pleasure.
Don't use the drive, if they have they are probably SOL, don't install the
ontrack software on to the same drive you're trying to recover, you will
just make things worse.

Moral of the story is don't format without backing up data ;).

I'm coming in late, but have you looked at Moodle? (moodle.org). It's
Apache/PHP/MySQL based and there's a packaged version for Windows with
EasyPHP if that's the way you want to go. The Moodle folks are *very*
security-conscious and I'm pretty sure if you use a stable and secure
Apache, PHP and MySQL underneath, you should be OK. I love it -- I use
it for two of my web sites.

just a extra 5 cents

Joomla! is a spin off of Mambo. I found out quite a few
people have heard of Mambo but not Joomla!. There was
a split for some reason and the core developers of Mambo
forked and created Joomla!.

I'm not say Joomla! may be your best choice for a simple
CMS, but once you get over the learning curve and lack of
basic "how/why/etc" docs, it is quite powerful. That
power/capability comes with a pretty high price.

So far it is the only one I have any experience with

You may want to check out Textpattern (I think I've brought this one up
before). Its php, from what I've seem secure and its a small group of core
developers who listen to the community which is nice. It would force (if
thats an aim) to learn css/html in order to actually have a stylized site in
addition to content management functionality.

Message-ID: <009001c68a4e$40a3da00$0501010a@billslaptop>

Hello all.
 
Someone uploaded a file to my server last night ( I have attached it ).
 
It is a php file that looks quite dangerous.
 
The upload repository is not web-accessable and I don't have any kind
 
of software capable of executing this file installed on the server, 
 
But will someone on this list look at this and tell me what it is?
 
Thanks in advance,

Subject: [PLUG] Squid Slackware 10.1 resolved...
Message-ID: <1149274757.44808a855b726@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

After breaking the fork in watch_child, it became clear in gdb 
that the permissions on squid's log directory were causing the 
abort.

Nowhere in the installation docs do I recall seeing a mention that
failing to set the correct permissions on the log directory will
make squid abort.

So if anyone out there is abandoning Slackware 10.1 thinking that
squid won't run on it, fix the ownership and permissions on it's 
log directory.  On my system, the ownership has to be set to 
squid.root mode 755.

I encourage the team that puts out the 2.5-STABLE14 source release of
squid to add a warning about permission problems before the first 
fork in the next release.  It would be so helpful if squid would 
dump a warning to /var/log/messages that the permissions on it's log 
directory are causing the abort.  The error message signal 6, abort,
isn't meaningful enough for a troubleshooter to figure out what is
wrong quickly.

Another thing for the squid team, where are the configure options 
documented in the source code?

Message-ID: <1149286062.4480b6ae2828f@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

Redhat, Suse, Debian, MacOSX, ... aren't these all system V init style systems?

I'm trying to install dansguardian from source on slackware shoving all it's
files under /opt.  When I try dansguardian, it neither crashes nor starts.

So, I'm stumped.  If anyone can point me to special instructions to get 
dansguardian compiled and working on slackware 10.1 that will be very
much appreciated.  I suppose it could be my firewall, but then something
should be logging...  I'd sure like to see more programmers exercise 
caution when it comes to being biased towards system V init based Linux 
distros.  Slackware is a wonderful Linux system.

Message-ID: <1149469612.448383ac87647@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I'm looking at Asterisk as a replacement for mgetty-voice.  The Fedora
Core 1 package seems to be missing it's documentation and a few important
scripts.  I'm trying to use DTMF programming to allow switching
the modem from voice to data mode, but I have it switching at the wrong
time frequently.  I guess telemarketers must be tripping it.  If I could 
figure out what number is entered and require a specific code, I would 
cut down on false hits...

Well, Asterisk appears to be an option for implementing VoIP
locally on a network.  I am interested in extending PSTN telephone lines
over an IP network and I'm also interested in a purely VoIP system for
simple local area network telephony.

I gather Asterisk can take over the answering machine function that mgetty-voice
provides.  Does Asterisk work with standard voice modems, or do I have to buy
special cards to use it?

best guess without knowing anything: You're running some form of php website 
that is not 100% secure and an exploit is known. The attacker used that as a 
backdoor to start a script from /tmp using php or perl, and attempted to 
connect to that from remotely.

i did a couple consulting gigs fixing sites with php.

in both the software packege gave very very strong
recommendations not to put the directories where things
got uploaded to in a place that was in the webservers
docuement root. guess where the diretory was.

for one site a did a quick demo of uploading a .php
file and then executing it.

To the extent that OS X uses a standard Unix init style, it's BSD, not 
SysV.

Apple, however, is moving as much init functionality as possible into 
the darwin SystemStarter utility. The launchd(8) man rather explictly 
notes, "At some point in the future, we hope to completely phase out 
the use of rc."

To me, this looks like your problem has nothing to do with init style. 
I know nothing about dansguardian, but I assume you've installed and 
configured a proxy (squid/tinyproxy), right? Is the proxy working? Do 
you get a help screen if you type "dansguardian -h"? Have you tried 
running dansguardian under strace?

I'm far from expert, but I've implemented some Asterisk systems and written a 
small bale of howtos. The short answers are:

- you don't need anything other than ordinary PC hardware and some kind of IP 
phone. For cheep testing and even production use, get some decent-quality USB 
telephone headsets. Then you don't even need a soundcard.
-your server will run Asterisk, and the clients can use the XTen Lite 
softphone. It's free and it's very nice.
- you don't need a modem at all, and I hope you're not thinking of trying to 
run VoIP over dialup, because that's not enough bandwidth. You need broadband 
Internet for IP telephony
-Asterisk is so flexible you can implement it just about any way you want to

The howto series is here  http://www.voipplanet.com/asterisk/
The series starts out with Asterisk at Home, which is now called Trixbox. It is a 
great iPBX bundle, but there is not a clear relationship between its 
graphical configuration managers and the underlying config files, so I'm 
moving the series to plain-vanilla Asterisk.

if it's the one linked #1 on google for "bab.php" then sure, it's dangerous. 
It's basically a swiss knife backdoor that -once activated- tries a bunch of 
known vulnerabilities and sets up show for you. It doesn't try any rootkitish 
type of things but most zombie networks don't care about root - only about 
getting a network connection up to establish a connection.

( http://www.neurotransmitter.net/wiki/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=15 )

Having one of these on your webserver is not the end - the script may not have 
been activated or used yet (only uploaded), but you should carefully monitor 
network connections and integrity of your network tools. A good Audit is required.

Subject: [PLUG] USB Turntable
Message-ID: <4488ADA8.7080302@comcast.net>

Jeme mentioned a USB turntable in an earlier post. That sent me to 
Google where I found the iTTUSB from Ion-audio, and a link to Amazon as 
a place to buy it. There, I found that it is "coming soon," which is the 
sort of thing I found when I tried looking for it at the various big-box 
stores.

So, then I did a generic USB Turntable search on Amazon and found that 
there is one that looks the same, except for a label, from Numark. 
Numark's model name is TTUSB, very similar to iTTUSB from Ion-audio. The 
product descriptions match pretty well, too, including reference to the 
Audacity software. Sadly, one has to dig through the Ion-audio reference 
material to see that they acknowledge that Audacity is available for 
Linux. The product page descriptions just mention PC and MAC compatible.

Does anyone know who made it for whom? And, does it matter?

This interests me. I have a collection of ~150 inherited LPs that I
haven't heard in a very long time. That's because I have no turntable
at all. Off and on the thought occurs to me that I really ought to do
something about getting them onto CDs or something. Except that mp3
would be an even better idea. As I recall, some are kind of scratchy,
so de-scratching and de-clicking software would be useful. 

However, once the job is done I have no further use for the turntable.
Seeing your message made me wonder if we might get together on this.
Maybe I could just give you some money to do my collection, and you
could use it to defray the cost of the turntable. Or maybe I could do
it myself and just rent your turntable from you for the job. My
collection would probably take 75 hours just to play them all through,
at 1/2 hour per LP. Wait ... LPs are double-sided, right? Make that 150
hours then. OK, that is way too much time for you to spend just for the
cost of the turntable. But if you are interested, perhaps we can work
out something else mutually beneficial. Otherwise maybe I could buy my
own turntable and just resell it on eBay afterwards. Or something.

Such software exists and is common, but you also have to apply an eq 
curve to the phono output (which you can do in software too), unless 
your soundcard happens to have a phono input, which seems unlikely. 
Routing the audio through your regular stereo that has a phono input and 
a line output might be easier.

I have a modest collection of LP's, 45's, and 78's. I'm not sure of the 
count, but the shelf space runs to about 8 feet.

At one time, I considered offering my services to people for just this 
sort of thing. For now, and the foreseeable future, time is too short. 
Once we get the thing (Amazon says they'll be shipping again in July), 
we'll use it on and off as time permits, which is not very predictable, 
so sharing a unit wouldn't be practical. But, thanks for the offer.

As Brent said in his reply, the kind of signal the cartridge on the 
turntable puts out must be considered. There are (or where, anyway) 
ceramic cartridges which could be connected to Aux ports, but the better 
cartridges are magnetic and need a proper "Phono" input. The USB 
turntable has three options, USB, line level audio, and phono cartridge 
level audio. In analog mode it can be plugged into the line in jack on a 
computer sound card, or it can be used with a stereo system that has 
phono jacks.

I used to do this with a Dual 12-mumble-mumble, until it died. Having it 
repaired is not cost effective -- I've done it once already, and expect 
it would need doing again, periodically. Also, I haven't upgraded my 
stereo equipment since the late 1970's or early 1980's, and while the 
old Kenwood amp/pre-amp works well, it's not as convenient to use with a 
computer. With the USB turntable, I'll be able to record an LP on one 
computer while working on another at the same desk. There are too many 
pieces involved with running through the old Dual turntable. Having the 
Audacity software listening to the turntable will make the process 
smoother, too.

I did make good recordings with the old setup, though. I plugged the 
line out of the stereo amp into the line in of my Creative Labs sound 
card and ran gramofile on my 200 MHz RH 7.0 machine. After recording, I 
ran the clean up filters supplied with gramofile and then converted the 
.wav file to .mp3 with bladeenc. Both of these programs are run from the 
command line. I'll be interested to see how Audacity handles the 
process. It would be nice if it can record an LP, clean it up, and 
convert it to .mp3 with flipping the platter over being the only thing I 
have to do besides hit start. I realize that I'll have to do some 
tweaking of record levels and such up front, though.

This is something to consider when buying any kind of LCD flat panel;
monitor/TV/laptop/DVDplayer.  LCDs are not isotropic - there are 
tradeoffs between contrast and speed and viewing angle, both in the
horizontal and vertical direction (separately for each).  A monitor
that is good for video games is probably lousy for page proofing.

That said, if you are designing a website, you should probably design
it to look good on a monitor that is lousier than your clients will 
be using.  That restricts size, colors, and animation.  My friends
that design professional webpages have 4 or 5 monitors in front of
them, so they can see as many versions of lousy as possible.

Message-ID: <ef29858e0606090017k1971ddc1p6a6ed3820110eaa9@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to learn about Linux as a web server by running VMWare
Player on Windows 2003 with this image of Fedora Core 4:
http://chaz6.com/?p=136 -- notice my unanswered question is the last comment

While the VM boots, it gives this after a long pause:

Bringing up interface eth0:
Determining IP information for eth0 ? failed.

It can't see my host network connection.  I tried changing HWADDR in
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 to the same as in the VMWare
config file, but that does not help.

A Windows software dev by day, I'm new to all this, and I wasn't able
to find a hint searching the VMWare newsgroup nor Google.  There's
probably a very easy fix, but I don't even know if it is a setting in
Windows network connections, VMWare Player, or inside the VM itself.
Any help appreciated!

In reference to your earlier post, Dick, my understanding is that the USB 
turntables that were available were not USB2.0 and the new ones will be.

I'm kind of holding out for that.

The rest of this is a long explanation of my home audio needs.  I'll be 
shocked if anyone reads it, but I'm desperate to avoid writing a paper on 
group cohomology.

Of course, you can do that.  However, I'm looking to minimize hardware 
while still maintaining flexibility of format.  So I will be replacing my 
nice direct-drive Gemini turntable with something that can be used to rip 
audio digitally.  I believe that the AD converter in the turntable will be 
high quality and I won't have to worry about analog signal going through 
cables and minijack ports.

In the end, I'm hoping to just output to amplified speakers from general 
purpose computers while still maintaining my modest collection of vinyl 
(there are a handful of CDs and cassettes I'll keep for completism, but 
none of the cassettes contain anything I don't also have on CD, so access 
to the data is not important).

I would love to find a PC minidisc drive, but they've gone with the auk, 
methinks.  I guess the other option is to get a nice digital recorder to 
replace my portable minidisc recorder.  Fuck.

Yeah, when I finally got sick of the belts slipping on my old cruddy 
turntable, I set out to buy a new one.  I was kind of shocked to find that 
there's no such thing as an inexpensive turntable these days.  There are 
nice ones and outrageously nice ones.  Turns out the things are marketted 
only to DJs and audiophiles.  I went to a DJ shop and ended up spending a 
few hundred dollars about seven years ago.  The quality is quite good, but 
my needs are changing.

I'm trying to simplify my life (and prepare for the move to grad school 
living conditions) by divesting myself of material things.  I've come to 
find that I don't really use any of my VHS cassettes, DVDs, CDs, or 
cassettes anymore.  I play audio in five locations:  The living room, my 
bedroom, the TV room, the kitchen, and my bicycle garage.

In the living room, I have a complete stereo system with the one 
turntable, the CD, cassette, and minidisc decks, a radio tuner, and a 
Turtle Beach Audiotron which mounts shared filesystems on my house 
computer network and accesses audio found there for playback.  The only 
things that aren't just collecting dust are the audiotron and the 
turntable.

My bedroom has my personal computer conected to bookshelf stereo system 
that houses an MD deck, CD player, and radio tuner.  This particular 
bookshelf system does have a phono connection as well as digital 
input/output.  [Holy crap, I might be able to just use this as my 
interface point and ditch everything else and not by the USB turntable.  I 
didn't even think about that until doing this dumb inventory and actually 
checking the capabilities of all the equipment.  I think I just made 
myself very happy -- assuming I can get the digital audio to play nice 
with my sound card's i/o.]

The TV room is where I keep my modified XBox which mounts the shared 
network filesystems and plays the audio found there.

The garage and kitchen both have amplified speakers connected to iPod 
docks.  Since my iPod contains all of the audio on my personal computer's 
shared system, this gives us most of what's on the network (everything 
except the stuff on the neighbors' shared filesystems which are part of 
our local network) and also gives me good opportunity to charge my iPod 
without thinking about it.

So, yeah.  I just need some means of putting my vinyl, CDs, and MDs on the 
network or the iPod.  Direct playback from those storage media is neither 
necessary nor desirable.

I heard from a friend who went through the process of digitizing his vinyl 
that there was some feedback and noise introduced by running the turntable 
(with a rather sensitive magnetic cartridge) near the computer systems. 
He went through the trouble of setting up the turntable far away and then 
running straight, high-quality analog lines into his fancy soundcard.

And you'll probably end up manually applying the track cuts.

I gotta say, I ripped my entire CD collection (only about 500 discs) in 
one weekend (with fairly meticulous metadata entry and cross-checking, 
though there are still a handful of errors that I find now and again).  I 
think the vinyl will take much longer even though I have a tenth as many 
discs.

I guess instead of looking into the USB turntable, my next step will be 
trying to get the digital input from the bookshelf system into the 
soundcard on my PC.

Interestingly, I bought this bookshelf system in the first place because 
it has a PS/2 keyboard port for titling minidiscs.  How badass is that?  I 
was disappointed to learn that the keyboard couldn't be used as a general 
purpose editting console, though.  Seems like it would have been just as 
easy to define the function keys to do some or all of the things that the 
remote control keys do.

That explains the back order. I can live with that.

I haven't had that experience, but I also have the stereo system in the 
living room wired to the computer in the basement about 25 feet away.

I found gramofile to be somewhat good about finding track cuts. I didn't 
have to manually apply all of them, but did have to on about 1/4 of 
them. I could tell by the count of tracks it came up with whether I'd 
need to or not, and then look at the longer ones to finish the process. 
At first, I thought I'd be ignoring track cuts, since most of the music 
I have is classical and I normally wouldn't be interested in some 
interior track by itself. But, I found there were times it was something 
I wanted.

I'd be interested in your file organization philosophy. I have my 
collection organized in directories according to genre first, then 
within the genre by composer, and within the composer by album. I use 
mpg123 for playback and it will work with a play list file, so for each 
album I have a .lst file with the individual tracks listed in the order 
they appear. Most of the tracks have a leading track number with leading 
zeros on those with more than nine tracks, but some just have names. The 
.lst file allows the unnumbered tracks to be played in the desired order.

   Thanks, Bill. I've found the ORA books to be excellent. There are so many
for XHTML and CSS that I wondered if there were better ones.

Heh, yeah, if you don't set LC_COLLATE=C, things sort
case-insensitively, which looks funny if you've lived with the ASCII
Collating Sequence for most of your life.

Have you actually copied them to your iPod?  Do they display correctly
there?  It's possible that the reason EasyTag recommended converting to
ISO-8895-1 is that portable players might not be as likely to support
Unicode.  But who knows?  My Treo+PocketTunes does Unicode just fine.

I have mgetty-voice set up, but I'm not happy with it because my kermit 
chipset modem often records the phone company, 
"if you'd like to make a call..." even after a legit message from someone.  
The only solution seems to be asking people to stay on the line till they 
hear a second tone.  There has to be a way to configure or patch vgetty 
so that it will detect that a person has hung up.  On google groups my 
question has been asked, but there seems to be no answer to it.

I have preliminary interest in VoIP for use over a local area network.
I also want to get around the problem of mgetty-voice recording the
phone company's message because it didn't detect being hung up on
by the person on the other end.  I don't want to do VoIP over an
analog modem connection.  I either want to find thorough enough
documentation to fix my mgetty-voice problems or a replacement
for mgetty-voice that works better.  I don't want to buy an answering 
machine, I'd rather have my messages be lan accessible.  Asterisk
doesn't seem to be intended for building public switched telephone 
network answering systems.  For those who have a fax line, it makes 
sense to play a message in case a customer/etc. mistakes it for their 
voice line.  I've been watching what is said about Asterisk.  Clearly,
a traditional POTS line for faxing is repeatedly being recommened over
a VoIP line.  With all this pressure towards having a POTS line,
why isn't there more effort to improve vgetty?  None of the current
documentation seems to address configuring vgetty properly to detect 
being hung up on.  When someone doesn't want to leave a message, they 
are more than likely to just hang up.  If the phone company wouldn't
use such a high pitched ear splitting recording, this problem wouldn't
be so annoying.

Michael C. Robinson

Subject: [PLUG] Apache auth requirements based on Content-Type?
Message-ID: <Pine.OSX.4.64.0606091127290.7645@arrowhead.galois.com>

I've got a wiki on a public web server. It currently requires HTTP 
Digest authentication to access any content.

The wiki provides RSS feeds, and some users would like to be able to 
access those without authentication. Some aggregators, it seems, don't 
have secure ways to store and use username/password data.

The only safe way I can imagine to implement this would be to get 
Apache to remove authentication and authorization requirements when a 
document's Content-Type header is set to 'application/rss+xml'.

Does anyone know if that sort of thing is possible? If so, any clues 
would be welcome.

I have an Xbox that runs linux. I do not use xbox live. I prefer the free
alternatives like xbconnect or better yet xlink kai. There are two main
flavors of mods, softmod and hardmods. A mod chip simply adds an alternative
BOIS to your system, which you can enable or disable. If you boot with the
retail BIOS, you can still login to xbox live and play without issues. On
older xboxs you can simply replace the retail BIOS with a hacked BIOS, but
this will ruin your xobx for xbox live. For me xbox live does not matter, so
I replaced the retail BIOS with a hacked one. The reason I am using an xbox
with linux is because it is a cheap ($75 - $100) computer with TV out, and I
am using the xbox for a remote frontend for MythTV. It works great and is
easy to setup. I have even posted a torrent file for the xebian distribution
that I am using with MythTV installed and mostly configured. The beauty of
the xbox is that they are all the same (bassically) and that you can just
take a linux dist from one to another an it runs with little tweaking.

You can, I'm not sure what they will do. It sounds like you have a PHP
page that allows people to upload files, and someone used it to upload a
file.

If you really need people to be able to upload files, I would password
protect that area of the web site if possible, and restrict access to
people who really need to use the feature.

If for some reason you have to leave it open to the world, then you're
going to have this sort of thing happen again.

http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/browsersync/faq.html#q10

What's the point of encrypting my information?

By encrypting your information, it will be transmitted to and stored on 
Google's servers in a format that is nearly impossible to interpret 
without the PIN. That means that without the PIN, no one, not even 
Google, will be able to read your data. Therefore, it's important to 
choose a good PIN (at least 8 characters including both numbers and 
letters) that's hard to guess and to keep your PIN safe. Note that 
encrypting all of your browser settings may affect the performance of 
Google Browser Sync and Firefox.

Considering that the NSA is directly tapping AT&T's network, having my 
browser configuration, history, and bookmarks stored in an encrypted 
format on Google's servers doesn't particularly concern me.

   I took Brent's advice and had browsercam.com look at the new home page of
my site on both linux and Windows with several browsers. How strange!

   I'd greatly appreciate feedback from you folks -- particularly if you have
access to a Microsoft box running some flavor of windows and different IE
versions.

   It looks like the images in the header don't hold position. I cannot tell
more than that from the thumbnails. If you have suggestions where I can get
help with the CSS to make the site appear the same regardless of OS or
browser, please let me know. Also, I need some help getting the
hover/rollover color changes to work on the horizontal menu (which also
appears to wander a bit).

   The site was built on code I found in books and web sites; I am not a web
developer by profession.

TIA,

Rich

It's hard to say as I haven't seen what you see as being the correct 
version.  But things look a little wonky in Seamonkey/FF and IE6 on 
WinXP.  The menu covers the primary logo, which is oval in Moz but 
square in IE.  In Moz the menu still doesn't look aligned properly with 
the bottom of the header.  The second header graphic doesn't show at all 
in IE.

The gradients look off on in the right column, and the text in the left 
column is too big for the button width.  It's hanging off the end.  The 
overall width in IE is much narrower than in Moz too.  The W3 buttons 
don't show in IE either.

Sorry I don't have time to analyze the code right now, but there are 
definitely different things going on in different browsers in Windows.

   Thank you. My challenge is recognizing what is being moved, and then trying

You might want to give #topmenu a fixed position and size:

 position: absolute;
 top: 0px;
 left: 0px;
 width: 155px;

   That's what I saw running the site through browsercam.com. I'm sure that
everything is fixable -- by those who have dealt with them before and on a
regular basis. I'll go through the PIE site and see what I can find.

   I woke up in the middle of the night thinking how I wanted to change the
mess I had before and make it look a bit spiffier. Finally fell out of bed
about 4:00 am when I realized I wasn't going back to sleep. I've been at it
all day and would really like to get the site looking as good as Microsoft
will permit by the end of the weekend as next week will be very busy with
other business.

   This is not to suggest that I would refuse any and all help offered. The
.css file can be downloaded from the site, or I can mail it.

Thanks,

Lance,

   I tried that locally and it broke everything on firefox-1.5.0.4/linux. The
top menu shifted to an offset vertical, pushed the header up and off the
viewscreen, and otherwise raised havoc.

Thanks,

Rich

I'd guess the square/oval-ie/ff thing is because of IE's poor PNG 
handling.  Conversion to a GIF should fix that.

I'd suggest eliminating the left and right page margins or at least 
turning them down to something low like 10px.  I need to stretch my 
window to >1024 pixels wide to keep the "applied ecosystems" and 
"environmental permitting" ovals from overlapping.  Yes I have a 1600 
pixel wide screen but I like to be able to see more than one window wide 
on my screen.

I'd also suggest setting the "background-position" property to "left" in 
"div#more h3".

Hi.

	I was navigating my system today and instead of typing in "cd /", I typed 
in "cd //". Much to my suprise, I went to a directory called '//'. It's 
contents seem to be the same as that of the root directory, but I find the 
two backslashes to be quite weird. Can anybody replicate this behavior on 
their system and/or tell me more about this "Double-root" directory? 

	Thanks in advance.

Weird.  I get the same results on my system.  "cd ///" goes to "/", not 
"///". Never noticed that before.

This appears to be a bug in bash.  I have reproduced it on AIX running 
bash, as well as Linux.  It does not occur in any other shell I have 
tried.

   Done. In FF-1.5.0.4 this expands the contents to the full window width
instead of constraining it to the center.

   Done.

   They're foreward slashes, not backslashs, and on my box typing 'ls //'
shows the contents of the root directory.

I've always assumed that this (collapsing multiple slashes together)
was a feature.  I certainly appreciate the fact that I can type
something like: "ls ./whatsit//whatever" and have it work.

Things like this happen when you use both tab completion and !'s, like this:

ls ./whatsit/       # (tab completion puts the final '/' on.)
ls !:1/whatever # (while I stick the '/' in, just to keep from
confusing myself.)

which resolves to:

ls ./whatsit//whatever

Not bug, feature (really). And it isn't your shell, afaict, since stat()
will get all three slashes and do the right thing anyway:

lstat64("///", 0xFFBFEE90)                      = 0

I can confirm it works like with with every shell I try. (using "ls ///")

   After looking at some of the 56 images from browsercam.com, I think that
many problems will go away if I put the three horizontal menu items back in
the vertical menu, and stop trying to make the site more sophisticated by
splitting the menus that way. Perhaps it would work with a bunch of
javascript or php, but I know neither.

   Tomorrow morning I'll return the menus to a single list. Then I'll ask
those of you with access to IE to see if it looks/works any better.

Thanks all,

Rich

 From the later comments it sounds like you're beyond the stage of 
needing to see images to know that there's a problem. But, if you want 
them, I have screen shots from Firefox and IE on WinXP, Firefox and IE 
on Win98, and Firefox and Konqueror on SuSE 9.1.

Not quite.  There is definitely something "unique" about bash:

Newton:~ jrmartin$ cd /
Newton:/ jrmartin$ cd //
Newton:// jrmartin$ cd ///
Newton:/ jrmartin$ cd ////
Newton:/ jrmartin$ cd /
Newton:/ jrmartin$ cd ///
Newton:/ jrmartin$ cd //
Newton:// jrmartin$ csh
[Newton://] jrmartin% pwd
/
[Newton://] jrmartin% cd
[Newton:~] jrmartin% cd /
[Newton:/] jrmartin% cd //
[Newton:/] jrmartin% cd ///
[Newton:/] jrmartin% cd ////
[Newton:/] jrmartin% cd //
[Newton:/] jrmartin% cd
[Newton:~] jrmartin% exit
exit
Newton:// jrmartin$ cd
Newton:~ jrmartin$ tcsh
[Newton:~] jrmartin% cd //
[Newton:/] jrmartin% exit
exit
Newton:~ jrmartin$ cd //
Newton:// jrmartin$ tcsh
[Newton://] jrmartin% exit
exit
Newton:// jrmartin$

This is a Mac, BTW.  Notice the command prompt differences.  Only
double slashes ("//") is affected.

Dick,

   What I learned from my free access to browsercam.com is that every browser,
on every linux and Microsoft OS, renders the site differently. Sigh. One of
the results of abundant standards, I suppose.

   Anyway, I removed the horizontal menu (which was causing fits over here in
any case), and put all links on the left side menu.

   I've used up my free access to browsercam.com, so I would appreciate a
report of what you see on the different viewing platforms.

   What I intend is a graphic banner with the logo in an oval on the left and
the brand in an oval on the right. There are three columns below the banner.
The left should have a vertical list of menu links (one level only), that
exhibit hover and rollover color changes. The right side column has contact
information and a list of forthcoming events on the home page only. The
center column has the page content.

   It took me a while to realize that the small increase in width seen on
several pages was not a CSS bug I had to find, but expansion into the space
occupied by the vertical scroll bar on the rest of the pages. I recognize
that this site is obviously done by an amateur, but _I_ think it's the nicest
one I've done in the several iterations over eight years. Any and all help is
welcome in having others see it as I do here, regardless of platform or
browser.

Thanks,

Rich

It's supposed to work that way.  It's sort of a convenience or "feature" ;-)

Try 'ls -l //home//username', for example.  Same as 'ls -l /home/username'.
Kind of a nice feature when you're trying to concatenate strings in a shell
script and don't want to create three or four constants for the same meaning
-- "home", "home/",  "/home" and "/home/" -- when just plain HOME="/home/"
will get things done.

Yep. The iPod understands the Unicode tags and displays them properly.
And so does gtkpod now. And I have gtkpod a bit better understood now,
too. (Hint to gtkpod people: DOCU-effing-MENTATION!!!)

Part of the problem was my hopeless confusion about how to use gtkpod.
There were these two selections on the left, iPod and Local. I never
new why stuff appeared in one and not the other sort of randomly. I
finally figured out that gtkpod creates its own databases, independent
of the iTunes database on the iPod. "Local" means that gtkpod will
build a database of stuff I have on my computer, because it thinks I
want to use it to play music. And "iPod" means it will build a database
of stuff that is (or is about to be) on the iPod. What I had been doing
all this time was ignoring those two items because I had no idea what
they meant. So when I would Add Files sometimes one would be selected,
sometimes the other.

And then, because some of the tags were encoded incorrectly, due to the
UTF-8 problem with EasyTag, I re-added some of them after I fixed them
with gtkpod's editing tool. But then I discovered that gtkpod has a bug
-- the option to save tag edits back to the file on disk does not work.
It did fix the file on the iPod, however. Since it wasn't saving the
tag edits to the file, I stopped using gtkpod for editing tags. But by
that time my iPod was a total mess. I had duplicates all over the
place, many with wrong tags, some of the ones that weren't duplicated
also had wrong tags. I started going using gtkpod to go through the
list and try to clean them up and finally decided that 317 files was
going to take forever.

That's the point when I decided to use EasyTag for all of them and
forget about gtkpod's editing mis-capabilities. And once I got EasyTag
working properly with Unicode I went through all 317 files on disk and
fixed all the tags. (Problem is that classical music usually has no
tags at all, and when it does, they are not what I want.) Then I
plugged in my pocket drive and copied the whole folder of mp3s to it
for backup, in anticipation of what I was planning on doing to the iPod.

So once I got all the tags properly edited and the backups made, I
launched gtkpod without the iPod mounted. Then I deleted both gtkpod's
Local and its iPod databases. (This is time-consuming, you can't Select
All and hit the delete button -- they have to be deleted one at a time.)
Finally, with both databases empty I closed gtkpod, mounted the iPod,
and restarted gtkpod. Then I told gtkpod to read the iPod, which it
happily did, displaying the mess on the iPod. Doing this recreates the
iPod database in gtkpod. So then I proceeded to delete every last file
from the (new) iPod database. And then I hit Sync, which removed all
the files from the iPod. (This was scary; now you see why I was careful
to back up my new good files first.)

After Sync finished and my iPod was empty I shut down gtkpod, unmounted
the iPod, unplugged it, and verified that all music files were gone.
Then I plugged it back in, remounted it, re-opened gtkpod, and (making
sure the iPod button was selected, not Local), I told gtkpod to add all
the files from my [now perfectly tagged] mp3 collection. That took it a
while (14 GB). When it finished I told it to Sync. That took even
longer. But when it was done my iPod was all tidy and has all the music
on it with all the tags properly coded.

All is well in iPodlandia. iPodlandites are happy people now. (But
we're never going near an Apple store again.)

I'll visit again later this morning or this afternoon and take some 
screen shots for you.

Could you take a screen shot and post it? You can create a separate page 
on your site, with no link from the home page, then give us the link so 
we can go look at what you want the page to look like.

   A screenshot of what I created with firefox-1.5.0.4 on Slackware can be
downloaded from <http://www.appl-ecosys.com/screenshot.png>.

   When I look at the site with Opera-8.5.4 here, the only difference I see is
that the brand image (right side of the banner on top) is shifted slightly
right. Shrug.

Thanks to all of you,

How rude.  And the network interface is properly enabled in VMWare?
Might be interesting to bring up the interface by hand using ifconfig or

Yay, thank you for taking a walk on the penguin-y side!

There's a Linux Clinic next Sunday the 18th from 1-5PM at Free Geek,
you're welcome to come by and bring your computer.

Heck, if you have a spare PC (the FG store sells 'em cheap, though
they're not normally open Sundays) you could even bring it and install a
full running version of Fedora, Ubuntu and/or whatever strikes your
fancy.

   Although I cannot view my web site in IE, I believe that the header images
being displayed as rectangles instead of ellipses has been resolved. The help
came from Norway on a CSS discussion mail list. On the slim chance that there
are other folks here as naive as I was about graphic formats and how they're
displayed by various web browsers, I'll share what I learned.

   I never knew that transparency was not an all-or-nothing state (except in
politics, of course), but it isn't. With .jpg and RGB color .png images, the
transparency is dithered. IE can't handle this so it ignores the transparency
bits and displays the images as rectangles.

   Both .gif and 8-bit (indexed) .png images have transparency as a single, on
or off bit. IE apparently knows how to interpret the single bit so the images
(ellipses, in my case) display correctly. The .gif, of course, has jagged
edges to the curved lines, and it will also reduce colors to 4. I'm not sure
how to use The GIMP to produce 8-bit, 16-color .png files. I'm sure it's in
the color convert dialog box, but I still have to learn just how to do this.
Almost certainly, ImageMagick can do this, but 'identify' doesn't tell me
what I need to know about color depth and I don't know what component tool
will do the conversion properly.

   Anyway, I was sent transformed copies of the two problem images, and I've
put those up on the production web server. I hope that resolves the issue and
that folks using IE can see the site as I designed it and focus on the
content.

   FWIW, I'm pickled tink that a couple of folks on the CSS discussion list
told me that they think the site layout is very well done, particularly in
strict compliance with xhtml-1.0 and css-2.0. As an amateur such response is
nice. But credit where it's due: I was given very good, practical advice from
a denizen of this list with a profitable web-based business. Thanks, RP.

   Not too long ago I could watch videos from sites such as reuters.com and
the sound was clear and undestandable. Then it changed. The video plays, but
the sound is garbled and distorted; perhaps it's coming across too fast.

   Has anyone dealt with this? Is there a tool I can use to adjust this? When
I run aumix I don't see anything that looks out of place. And, when I play
local .mp3 files the sound is fine.

Dave,

   I did not encounter this before; at least, no one told me anything in my
web site was screwy. So, for me it's news. Microsoft deliberately being
non-compliant with any standard not their own has been around for a couple of
decades. At least now we know the work-around for the transparent pngs.

   Well, I suspect the chipmunk sounds are from a broken RealPlayer. I
downloaded the latest verion (10Gold) and installed that in /opt/RealPlayer/.
But, I cannot find where in firefox's about:config to add that plugin.

   However, I did find a mozilla site that described how to install plugins,
including RealPlayer10. Following the one-step instruction, I copied
nphelix.xpt to /usr/lib/firefox-1.5.0.4/components, and nphelix.so to
~/.mozilla/plugins.

   Then I closed firefox and re-opened it. Still no sound in firefox. Any idea
what step(s) I've missed?

I wouldn't say deliberate this time.  I would chalk it up to 
complacency. IE6 has been around a long time with very few feature 
updates.  Their aggressiveness in getting IE to the position it's in now 
led to them not caring anymore.

   OK. I'll certainly accept that explanation. What I recall so well from back
in the DOS days was Microsoft applications looking for a bit (byte?) that
identified the DOS vendor. If it was Digital Research or IBM the application
wouldn't run. I ran into that when I had PC-DOS 7 and win3.11 running on an
early VMware beta, and wanted to upgrade to win95. Could do it; the win95
upgrade disk refused to accept IBM's PC-DOS as an OS.

Did you try selecting a cursor theme with debian-alternatives?  You 
mentioned that you applied a mouse theme, but didn't say how you applied 
it.  (Is a "mouse theme" the same thing as a cursor theme?  Not trying 
to be pedantic -- it's just that I know "cursor theme" and perhaps 
"mouse theme" is something else I've not yet encountered.)

In the past, with other niggly little problems I've had here and there, 
the debian-alternatives system has managed to sort them out when nothing 
else worked quite right.  So it might be worth a shot.

OTOH, you've probably fixed this by now, since it's five days old.  I've 
been away; playing catch-up.

Well, I run Debian Sid (unstable), so there's really nothing to upgrade 
to.  But I've read many messages from users on the Debian mailing lists 
saying that they've upgraded their stable systems without problems -- 
that is, upgrading from an older stable release (like Woody) to the 
current stable release (Sarge), which would be more-or-less the 
equivalent of upgrading from Breezy to Dapper.  OTOH, apparently there 
is a lot of pain for people who run testing when it comes to releases.  
Many users' testing systems were completely broken when Sarge became 
stable and was replaced by Etch.  Supposedly, the devs are going to try 
to figure out how to smooth that transition next time around, when Etch 
becomes stable sometime later this century.  :-)

I'm becoming convinced that the way Arch Linux does it is best -- just 
track current, and there's no need to "upgrade" because you're always 
current.  This is somewhat akin to running Debian Sid.  The downside to 
these is that any given update could hose your system, so it's not 
really appropriate for the production ("enterprise-ready") systems.  But 
it removes the pain of needing to upgrade between releases.

Gee, and I've only ever seen them take an ordinary hammer to a hard

its' going if this is still needed.

(note: this is not the only solution that was discussed before.)

A bit whacked together (but very stable) is my personal solution based on a 
small syslog replacement I wrote together with a few perl scripts:

you'll need some of these scripts:
   http://foo-projects.org/~sofar/scripts/ipblock.tar.bz2

and the logging daemon is here:
   http://lard.foo-projects.org/

the logging daemon replaces syslogd. You'll have to setup some rules to 
trigger a blocking script. I use something like this:

====== lard.conf snipplets:
# block people trying to log in with bad passwords
command "/usr/sbin/block-ip-from"
     log auth,authpriv.*
     match "sshd.*Failed password for (?:invalid|root|nobody|sshd|sys|operator)"

# smtp-log-based blocking: this blocks:
# 1) people using bad HELO/EHLO conversations
# 2) anyone listed in my selection of dnsbls
# 3) broken mailers
command "/usr/sbin/block-ip-from"
     log mail.info
     match "Service unavailable; .* blocked using"
     match "Helo command rejected"
     match "Improper use of SMTP command pipelining"
======

You can vary the blocking rules of course, using something that has a bit more 
leniency than blocking on the first try. Lard is just a very simple approach 
to this. People have written logtail-implementations which adds another layer 
on top of the syslog daemon etc. As complex as you want it ;^)

Cheers,

Auke

Blocking can create quite a large list, over time.  Moving the ssh port or
using port-knocking might lighten the load on your system.  Here's more
information and example <http://jonscully.googlepages.com/>.

I was thinking about that.. when does the size of this list become a 
problem?  Dozens, hundreds, thousands, or millions of entries?

   This is a new one for me: a process that will not start, but gives no error
messages or any other indication of a problem.

   We think the inability of my virtual win98 to communicate with the linux
network is a samba problem. Since I cannot get /usr/sbin/smbd to load and
run, that seems reasonable. Here are the details:

   1.) Running 'ps ax | grep smbd' returns nothing. Running 'ps ax | grep
nmbd' returns the PID.

   2.) Running '/etc/rc.d/rc.samba stop' reports, 'smbd: no process killed'.
Hmmm-m-m. Not good.

   3.) Running '/etc/rc.d/rc.samba start' reports,
Starting Samba:  /usr/sbin/smbd -D
                  /usr/sbin/nmbd -D

But, there's no smbd in the process list.

   I checked which version of samba was installed, and it was
samba-3.0.20-i486-2 so I upgraded that to samba-3.0.20b-i486-2, the latest
available.

   Nothing changed in the above three steps.

   When I look at /var/log/messages I see:

Jun 12 08:56:41 salmo smbd[6202]: [2006/06/12 08:56:41, 0] printing/pcap.c:pcap_cache_reload(149)

Jun 12 08:56:41 salmo smbd[6202]:   Unable to open printcap file lpstat for !

   What printcap file is smbd seeking and not finding? There's nothing in
/etc/samba related to printing. /etc/printcap has perms 644 and works with
all other apps.

   What's to be done?

TIA,

I think your block list would get huge after a while.  I don't know 
anything about iptables, but OpenBSD's pf has the ability to detect 
brute force attempts in general, not just SSH.  Here is a link that 
talks about it as well as a util to clean out the table after IP's have 
aged.  This way they're not blocked forever.

   http://legonet.org/~griffin/openbsd/block_ssh_bruteforce.html

Maybe iptables can do this too.

Jun 12 08:56:41 salmo smbd[6202]: [2006/06/12 08:56:41, 0]
printing/pcap.c:pcap_cache_reload(149)

printing/pcap.c:pcap_cache_reload(149) 
Jun 12 08:56:41 salmo smbd[6202]:   Unable to open printcap file lpstat for
!

   What printcap file is smbd seeking and not finding? There's nothing in
/etc/samba related to printing. /etc/printcap has perms 644 and works with
all other apps.

   What's to be done?

TIA,

Rich

Hard to say.  Would depend on the system.  However, the IP blocker has to
run through the list for each attempted contact of port 22.  If the log file
shows five new IPs per night (pretty average, here), within five nights,
that's 25 IPs to walk through for each access, and so on.  Each attacker
will typically run through many attempts (apache, admin, john, nobody, root,
etc.), for each target.

Besides (for me), the point of port-knocking isn't so much to block IPs as
it is to keep the log files un-cluttered ;)

This is off topic to your question, but Win9x/NT4 has a recent remote 
code execution bug that MS is *not* fixing.  They suggest you run a 
firewall.  Anyway, just a FYI on that family of MS OS's.  So be careful 
with the inet access there.  Win2K/XP/2K3 will be patched.

There are two that I am familiar with.  Denyhosts.py: monitors a log 
file ( secure, messages, etc. ) via a crontab call therefore can only 
check every minute and looks for repeated failed attempts to ssh in in a 
selected time period.  If found the IP is placed in /etc/hosts.deny 
which sshd uses.

The other is 'fut'.  I still haven't taken the time to get it running on 
a system so I'm not positive on how it works exactly but it appears to 
be more real time.  It is attached to a named pipe and watches for ssh 
floods and puts the IP in an iptables rule for several minutes then 
removes it.
    As it is written in perl it will be easier for me to hack so wins 
another few points.

What does '/etc/[smb | samba]/smb.conf' list as far as "printcap name = ???"

It should list "/etc/printcap" (not "lpstat").

   FWIW, this worked just fine with VMware through version 4.5.2. When I
upgraded to version 5.0 I lost the connection between the guest and host
OSes; not having to use either of the two applications on VMware I forgot
about it. Then I upgraded VMware to 5.5, and now I need to exchange data
between the linux system and the win98 applications.

   I've been working with VMware tech support on this; apparently it's a Samba
problem, not VMware.

Jon,

   It had been lpstat for quite some time now, but I changed it to /etc/printcap
and saw no difference when I stopped/re-started rc.samba. However, ...

   I just did this again (commented out lpstat in smb.conf and uncommented
/etc/printcap) ... and this time it worked! When I ask 'ps ax | grep smbd' I
see two processes running. And, the guest OS can now mount the network and
communicate.

   I've no idea when /etc/samba/smb.conf was changed, but it was a very long
time ago, and I don't know why I changed it (or an upgrade changed it) from
/etc/printcap to lpstat.

   Thank you _very_ much!

Rich

   The virtual machine is behind a firewall, and I've never let it out to the
'Net. Have no reason to do so. There are only a couple of apps there, and I
use them infrequently.

Fut is one example of such a program.  http://fut.patch.com/

It does need more work and I need to get to work on it.

I need to install it ( see previous message ) and beat the rascal up so 
your job is easier.  I really like the basic concept of fut.  Looking 
over the code it was pretty clear what was _trying_ to go on.

I have colorize running on several systems ( a perl script reading from 
a named pipe ) that monitors postfix logs.  When too much yellow or red 
shows up ( sometimes even before the queue monitor script, a cronjob, 
pages the admins ) they know there are problems.

No comment on the above extension, but I'm a reasonably happy user of

I run my own sitebar server on my colo machine. It's a bit cheesy, but

My Dad who lives "back east" just bought his first computer at the age
of seventymumble.

I got a call from him yesterday with all kinds of very basic questions
(examples: How do I create a file, How do I use the numeric
keypad/printscreen/function keys).  He said the computer didn't come
with any manuals.

The computer came with XP installed, and given his skill level, I don't
feel comfortable telling him to install Linux.

Other than buying him a copy of Windows for Dummies (and telling him
the title is a joke), does anybody have any advice?

I was thinking of sending him a CD with the latest OpenOffice, Firefox,
AdAware, Spybot S&D, etc.  Is there anything else I should put on it?
(anti-viris software, perhaps?)

Have him look into the community education available in his area, they
often have exactly the type of class needed for a *very* new computer

AVG is good. Not certain how well it will work for an ultra-newbie.

Classes are the best way. He needs someone local to talk with.

Hello List,

I'm new and have questions that I think can only be answered by people here, 
I foolishly attempted to inquire at local computer stores....

I want to get rid of Windows and start running Linux, thanks to surfing I 
now know a little bit about the OS but need some guiding on chosing the 
right distribution.

I am looking to run my BibleWorks program and soon Nota Bene (word 
processor) and also start doing some day-trading with currencies eventually 
utilizing RealTick.  Right now with the initial switch I am thinking of 
doing the Taboo, and running my Office Suite (that's all I have right now).  
In addition to all this my intention is to start learning C++, oh ya, my 
current connection is dial-up and will be getting DSL soon, (a week or 
so...I'm a poor student).

So that's my intention.  What would be the next step?

Thanks,
Eric Biggs

Hmmm... Interesting question...

The first thing to do is to get all the Microsoft updates.
http://update.microsoft.com
(Including the annoying Authentication, but hey you paid for it!)

Then I generally load the following on Windows boxes:
ccleaner   (http://www.ccleaner.com)
Avast anti-virus  (http://www.avast.com) (Free Registration & Updates)
AdAware (http://www.lavasoftusa.com)
Spybot S&D (http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html)
Firefox (http://www.mozilla.org)
Thunderbird (http://www.mozilla.org/thunderbird)
Open Office (http://www.openoffice.org)
SmartFTP (http://www.smartftp.com)
Trillian IM (http://www.ceruleanstudios.com)

Make sure you do the setup on all these programs.
Programs such as Avast and Spybot are MULTI-STAGE configurations.
Make sure you guide him through the correct setup. :)

I know that Bibletime works on Linux. It's free. You'll get a whole bunch of advice on which distro to choose. I use Debian myself. 
Go to distrowatch.com and do some reading there.

For office, I would use Openoffice. It's free and will handle your MS docs.

I hope you have a cd burner, it will make your life a lot easier. I would dual boot windows/linux for a while till you get used to 
it.

Good luck!

One thing I've considered doing with my mother is setting up remote
desktop, so I could do this sort of thing for her. But she's coming up
to speed (still prefers IE though, much to my chagrin).  You might
consider it, rather than spending 2 hours on the phone with him.  But
then, when else do you call him? (grin)

In cooperation with Free Geek we have Clinics at the Free Geek facility
on the third Sunday of each month. That means this coming Sunday, June
18. Mostly people bring their computers to get help with Linux.
Sometimes they haven't installed Linux yet and want help doing so. But
you are welcome to come to the Clinic even if you have not yet
installed Linux and are not yet ready to do so. You don't necessarily
even have to bring your computer. Feel free to show up, wander around,
look at people who have Linux on their computers, talk to newbies and
old hands, ask questions, and generally hang around and soak up stuff.
I'll be there too. And even though I'm relatively new to Linux, I
promise to answer any questions that I know the answer to. And I bring
cookies. 

Note to others: Our website still says we're at Riverdale HS. I thought
that was all fixed. Is my bookmark pointing at an old website or sumpin'?

My advice is that you ask this question in an appropriate forum.

Not only is this question off-topic, but you dismissed bringing it back 
into topic out of hand and with tacit acceptance of some pretty bad FUD.

If you can't talk your dad through installing GNU/Linux, find someone who 
will go to his house and do it for him.  He's never had a computer before, 
so he's not going to be all fudged up with other people's paradigms.  If 
you think that'll be "too hard", then please don't try to talk about 
GNU/Linux with other people because you're giving them all a terrible 
impression.

Any further talk of Winders should AT LEAST go to plug-talk.

J.

Can you go into your motivation for learning C++?  (As opposed to
other languages.)
Are you learning to program, or are you just looking to improve your
repitoire of languages?

Since you asked, my distro suggestion is Ubuntu, which is a variant of
Debian.  I like both distributions, but I have found the ubuntu
installation to be easier than debian.

> So that's my intention.  What would be the next step?

Go to a clinic, hack day, or install fest where you can get free help
from other geeks.  John's suggestion is a very good one.

--Rogan

ps: Be prepared.  People can feel *very* strongly about their Linux
choices and suggestions, which isn't that surprising, since there is
so much to choose.  Also, if at first you are frustrated by linux,
remember that you have enough control to remedy the sources of your
frustration.  (although, that freedom can at times be frustrating...)

I'll second John's advice to come to the Linux Clinic at FreeGeek next
weekend.  There you can find Linux in action, talk to experts, and
take home an Ubuntu Live CD to try out, which allows you to use Linux
for a while without modifying your existing installation.

The software you listed is primarily Windows software, which will not
easily run under Linux.  Perhaps this is an opportunity for you to
explore other open-source software, such as OpenOffice.org and Mozilla
Firefox, both which are available for Windows as well as Linux.

What you do *not* want to do is blindly install Linux for the first
time without any preparation, because you will lose all your existing
data.  Come to the clinic, we'll help you understand what you're
getting into and help you get started.

Looks like the PLUG FAQ needs to be updated:

Ah. right you are. Except I'm right too. My bookmark is pointing at

http://www.pdxlinux.org/faq.html#clinic

Which is in the FAQ and still shows Riverdale. But if you go to the

I have Dual 1019 which has served very well, but it has a rumble or a low
frequency resonance.  It is inaudible, but it takes up considerable dynamic
range.  I have been unable to isolate the cause.

On rim-drive Duals the part that wears out is the idler.  They are no longer
manufactured, and replacement idlers cost in the $60-$70 range.  If your Dual
has a good idler, and you are considering selling the machine, I would like to
talk to you.

I would also like to get some advice on using gramofile--I found the 
documentation confusing.  But Audacity does not have the automatic scratch 
removal capability that gramofile is said to have.

I got the following posting from Jon Stahl <jon at onenw.org>
about a Plone/Zope boot camp in Portland.

It looks like a real buy to me.
In fact, I registered for it myself.
When I registered I noticed they already had 20 students, so I
recommend signing up soon if you are interested.

-------------------------
PORTLAND BOOTCAMP: JULY 10-14

We'll be offered our "Plone Developer Bootcamp", the best-of-breed
week-long Plone training. It teaches you everything you need to know to
use Plone, and build Plone sites. It requires that you have experience
with HTML, but has no firm requirements for experience with Python,
Zope, or Plone. Over 500 students have taken this course and rave about
it.

The portland camp is July 10-14, held in downtown Portland, Oregon. It
is open for registration (only $400!) at

I can't even understand that.  He asked a simple question and got pretty 
reasonable feedback in spite of the purpose of the list.  I think you 
need to let things go some times.  No one here seems upset about this, 
and I don't quite understand your rant.

Kinda harsh?  Maybe you're not the best person for this job either?

There is no good reason to inflict questionably-licensed Windows on
someone you care about, or bring the pain of supporting such drek on
yourself.  Thanks to years of hard work by many thousands of people,
Ubuntu, Fedora Core and other distros have what most people need right
out of the box, and are easier to use than Windows.

I try to put "page last modified" dates at the bottom of all my
webpages (I don't always remember!).  It seems neighborly to let
readers know the last time a human being reviewed the information,
so they can estimate its validity.  

Pages that have information about stuff that can change should
be dated.  Not filesystem dates;  pages can be touched or moved
without actually changing!  If a page is changed in haste
without changing the date, well, perhaps the date represents the
last time someone actually thought about what they were doing!

Perhaps we need to (1) put dates on pages, and (2) develop some
informal system of spreading out the work of maintaining pages
to interested members.  Then pages can have a change date AND
a person responsible!

   I, too, have a Dual 1019 that I bought when I lived in Germany in the
mid-1960s. Great turntable!

   Given the interest in this thread, I wonder if those of us with large
collections of records could work as a group to digitize them. I don't listen
to mine because the floor's not sufficiently stable to keep the needle from

Keith,

   If you use SSI, it's automatic with this code:

       <!--#config timefmt="%c" -->
       This file last modified <!--#echo var="LAST_MODIFIED" -->

I think Keith was trying to distinguish substantive edits from a 
file's timestamp. The LAST_MODIFIED variable will be altered any time 
a file touched, regardless of whether its content was altered.

IMO, there's a fine line between significant and insignificant 
changes. Correcting typos or updating HTML tags isn't so significant 
to me, but adding/removing/correcting textual information (even a 
small amount) is significant.

I hadn't thought about differentiating between modification and review 
dates. I can see the benefit of adding a last-reviewed date to a page 
that's significant but rarely updated. Hmm.

Thanks for the direction to FreeGeek, If I am right it is at 1731 SE 10th 
Ave.  I think I'll bring my computer seeing that I am convinced that I want 
Linux.  Is the clinic/meeting/whatever from 1 pm to 5 pm?

My motivation for learning C++ is kind of to add to my repitoire of 
languages, though I don't know any computer languages yet.  I am a classical 
(koine) Greek student as well as classical Hebrew (not Paleo-Hebrew) and I'm 
going to be switching my major (eventually) to applied linguistics.  I was 
"looking down the road" and considered being familar with computaional 
linguistics and thought to myself, "self, you should learn a computer 
language."  It seems that in this field C++ is dominate.

I have yet more stupid questions...concerning this list:

Those that replied to my posts did some kind of inserting of my posts into 
their replies...(does that make sense?)  With a view of ettiquette, I 
presume I should follow suit...but, alas...I am ignorant.  Therefore, How do 
I correctly reply on this list?

And...

In one e-mail I am recieving what seems to be the entire day of list 
activities.  Is this the *digest* option?  I am looking to receive all the 
postings of this list as individual e-mails (I'm on other lists, though my 
activity on them is simply observational, and that is what I'm used to).  
Would this second approach be the *digest* option?

Lastly...Thank you all for the replies.

There's a bit of overlap between human languages and computer
languages.  But I find computer languages a whole heck of a lot easier
to learn.  The grammar is a lot simpler, and there are no silly
exceptions that you have to memorize.

With that said, you should know that there are at present two major
types of computer languages.  Procedural languages like C, in which
the programs are laid out like a string of sentences, and
object-oriented languages like Java, in which programs  are laid out
more like a collection of rooms, each of which contains a shorter set
of sentences.  (How's that for a mixed metaphor?)

The two types of languages take two different mindsets.  OO languages
are a lot newer than procedural ones, and it was a bit of a struggle
for some programers to make the switch.  I don't know which type would
be better for someone like you.

(C++, although billed as an OO language, can actually be used as a
procedural one.  So you can have it both ways.)

Most of us use mailing programs that automatically quote the original
whenever we make a reply.   Saving the context means that you don't
have to remember what the original question was.   Your mailer might
have an option some where to turn this behavior on.

It is general list-etiquette to quote an email with your replies either
underneith the original message, or splitting the original message into
seperate reply sections, as I have done. In hotmail you can turn on the
"show original message in reply message" in Options>Mail>Message Replies
(also, the Begin each line with ">" option isn't bad as well).

Yes that is the digest option. Digest is like a newsletter of the days
activities, when you aren't using digest it will send you lots of
individual messages. You can change your options at the
http://lists.pdxlinux.org/mailman/listinfo/plug page.


Good luck, thanks for posting :)

Let's see if I can do this without starting a language war...

C++ is a predominant language, but it may not be the best language to
start with.  If you want to learn to program because you'd like to be
able to create useful little programs for your own use, I would
suggest starting with a scripting language (perl, python and ruby are
common choices.  It is also good to know a little bash, since you can
run into a fair bit of that when using/configuring linux if you dig
into the details.).  These are "High-level" languages -- they provide
more of an abstraction between you and the computer.

If you are interested in the gory details about how computers "work"
-- how values are stored, how memory is managed, etc.. then C is a
good language.  In C you will be forced to manually manage your own
memory (at least at first -- there are tools that will do some of this
for you, but none work all the time.)  C doesn't abstract very much
from the internal hardware.

If you are interested in the theory of computer languages, then a
functional language may be more to your liking, although they tend to
have less support for real-world applications.  Haskell is probably
the most extreme example of a language like this -- it has a very
solid theoretical basis, and it is used for a great deal of research
in language theory and other areas, but it doesn't have a very solid
platform of libraries and tools for doing application development.
Lisp (my personal favorite language) is, in my humble opinion, an
extremely elegant language, and it is somewhat easier to use for real
apps than Haskell (Emacs, one of the most well-known "text editors"
was written in a dialect of lisp).  OCaml has rave reviews, and
reportedly a very strong platform of utilities and libraries for
application development.  (I've never used OCaml, so I can't speak
for/against it personally).  All these functional languages are pretty
high-level.

Most people try to reply in-line, as I have done.  The general idea is
that each email should read a bit like a conversation, and ideally
each email should stand alone.  Hopefully someone reading this message
without having read the history of this discussion (the rest of the
thread) will still understand what is going on.

The common alternative to replying in-line is called top posting --
the entire reply is posted above the message that is being replied to.
 I think of this as "jeopardy style", you have no idea what the poster
is talking about / agreeing with / swearing at until you read their
entire message.  A fair number of us regard top posting as extremely
annoying, since it only seems to benefit the top-poster.  Generally,
just use common sense -- if your reply doesn't apply to any portion of
the message you are replying to, perhaps it belongs in a new thread,
not a reply.

Yep, that's the digest.

"... It seems that in this field C++ is dominate. ..."

If you plan on sharing and or makeing use of existing
code, then C++ may be in your future. It may not be
the best or what you end up using your self but sounds
like you may need to know it enough to make use of
others in that field.

Last summer I had to dust of my years of gasp ...
fortran programming, including the Cray additions I had
not used since the '70s. The code I wrote was either
C where speed was needed or Perl when not. But still had
to know Fortran enought to understand the prior art.

Functional languages like Haskell are, admittedly, the minority's 
choice for application development -- but you'll find them in solid 
use at Intel, AT&T, Ericsson, Microsoft, and various smaller companies 
(like my employer :-).

It's interesting to note that the prime maintainers of the x86/Linux 
version of ghc, the predominant Haskell compiler, are Microsoft 
employees.

Hmm, I hadn't considered lisp.

Now in the normal course of events, I wouldn't inflict lisp on
anybody, because it's too, well, in a word, weird.

But remembering the linguistics texts that I tried to wade through in
college, I realized that to a linguist, lisp might make perfect sense.

It's also perfectly geared toward twiddling text, so that you might
even find that it can do things that will help you with that language
stuff.

(Another, more "normal" language that's good with text twiddling is
perl.  It's what I used most recently on a quick and dirty translation
script.)

Subject: [PLUG] LCD monitor recommendations
Message-ID: <20060613182200.GA4863@einstein.seansdomain.org>

Well this morning my nice 21" Sun dual input monitor died.  So I'm in
the market for a slightly smaller LCD monitor and I'm looking for
recommendation

Caveats:

1) my current monitor has 2 inputs one for standard VGA and another for
the older Sun Ultra video inputs.  I am planning on getting an adapter
and hooking it up to a vga switch box.

2) I would like to get at least a 19" LCD monitor.  But I'm not quite
sure how big a 19" wide screen is?  Is it really give you the same
screen size as a 19" CRT?

3) I'm really not interested in any of the new interface standards.  15
pin VGA is fine for me.

Questions:

1) Which manufacturers / models of LCD would anyone recommend?  Which
manufacturers to stay away from?  Which monitors have people been very
disappointed with?

2) What is nits, image contrast ratio?

3) Which characteristics are the most important when selecting a LCD?

4) How do you determine which screen resolutions are "native" as opposed
to "non-native"?

5) Are there new wide screen resolutions that won't be supported by my
U5 and linux nvidia card?

I've already looked at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_crystal_display 
which answered a lot of my questions


Thanks

Sean

Correct-a-mundo!  And John Jason Jordan may be there.  He's a linguistics
student at PSU, and may have some tips on working with other languages.

Indeed.  There are many computer languages, and in my opinion, C++ is
like English: it may be a chaotic mishmash of different languages and
world-models, but it *is* dominant in many areas, and brutally effective
when used with skill.

Programming is an expressive art independent of language.  There are
other languages that are easier to learn first.  I might recommend Python
or Ruby; there are good books and local groups that can help you learn.

It's called bottom-posting, and has been the traditional style for
electronic communications these past few decades.  Questions and such are
quoted and indented, responses are placed below them.

Top-posting (and the email virus) has come into vogue with the advent of
Microsoft Outlook on Windows, much to the consternation of us old-
timers, who prefer to converse rather than exchange broadsides.  <grin>

Thank you for noticing, and for asking.  Your humility and knack for
observation is rare and most valuable.

Hey Gang,

Since I didn't know any better until a different post this morning, I 
will continue to top post until I have a few minutes to figure out how 
to do it "properly".

I did reboot my machine to Dapper last night.  I remembered seeing a 
failure in the booting process about pcmcia.  Did a little research, it 
is a desktop, so I don't need that.  Renamed the files and *trumpets 
blare* we are running normally.

Did a few upgrades, installed Open Office, Thunderbird, allowed Firefox 
to upgrade...and all seems good.  I will go back and follow all the 
previous ideas to make sure all is well under the hood.

To answer a few of the questions earlier, it is a 933 dually with 1.5G 
of memory, one 15G hard drive with Breezy, a second 13G (I think) hard 
drive that now has Dapper.  I have swap files on both (I believe that to 
be unnecessary but am planning on using this machine for test driving 
different distros in the near future).

So, for now, thanks to all for the help.  I'll be back with more I am sure.

Bruce

LCD's are actual size in the diagonal. So they have a bigger screen size 
than their CRT counterparts.

I would suggest going to BestBuy or Fry's, as they have several displays 
there you can actually look at and see.  Then just buy online the model 
you like if you prefer.  There are no tricks to them or frills that set 
one above the rest.  Just get one that's easy on the eyes, and that runs 
at a resolution you're comfy with.  Some have telescoping stands for 
height adjustment.  Other than that, go with a brand name you can trust 
that has a good warranty.  I like Mitsubishi and Samsung, but I can't 
give you a good reason why.

> 4) How do you determine which screen resolutions are "native" as opposed

CRT's can run many screen resolutions and not degrade in quality.  If 
you have an old laptop around that has an 800x600 display, set it to 
640x480.  The screen (especially text) looks like crap.  New displays 
don't suffer with this phenomenon as badly, but to get that crisp and 
clear experience you want, you need to run at the 'native' resolution of 
the display.  There is only *one* native resolution.  This will be 
stated on the box or shelf label.  Your 21" Sun was probably 20" 
viewable, so a 19" LCD is only an inch shy of that.  Look for one that 
will run the same resolution you ran on your Sun.

I doubt it.  This sort of thing is very hackable anyway.

Eric,

 From one new guy to another...

I attended a clinic at Free Geek a while back.  You will be received 
with open arms.  These folks are experts with the patience for us 
newbies.  You need not fear.  They not only know what they are doing, 
but they have a sense of humor, too!  They must, they haven't kicked me 
out yet!


I am in the process of divorcing myself from Bill Gates.  I started out 
playing with SuSE and after several attempts with versions 8.1, 9.1, & 
9.2, I was just about ready to give up.  My son handed me an Ubuntu 5.10 
disk and recommended I try it.  It was my first experiece with a Linux 
distro that worked the first try.  Not only worked, but actually shut 
down my dual processors, properly.  I haven't looked back!

Welcome to the open source community!

Bruce

Sorry for being so late responding in this thread. I have a fierce
paper due tomorrow, which is not going to be done on time. Not to
worry, already handled the prof, who is cool with it. Still, I'm
burning it at both ends trying to get it finished.

Yes, I will definitely be at the Clinic. I will have my Ubuntu-64
Breezy laptop on which I do all my linguistics work. Therefore I can
show you all the cool things you need, including some that are much
more difficult to do on Windows. My favorite topics to geek out about
are Linux and linguistics. We can find ourselves a corner and have fun!
Except you'd be surprised how many Linux-heads are also interested in
linguistics, so maybe the rest won't mind having to listen to us. :)

In addition to helping others and generally letting loose with
unbridled geekitude, I plan to use the Clinic as the time and location
to upgrade this laptop from Breezy-64 to Dapper-64. Toward that end I
have downloaded and burned the ISO of the Dapper-64 DVD. I can burn
more if anyone else wants the DVD version instead of the CD.

Let me get this straight...  The maintainers of the Linux version of a 
Functional language are Microsoft employees?

Excuse me. I think my head is going to explode.

   When I replaced my 19" CRT with a 17" LCD monitor I measured the diagonal
length for the viewing area on each. The LCD was 1/4" shorter. That's about 8
square inches less viewing area. Since the price point at that time was at
the 17" LCD size, that's what I bought, and I've been happy with it.

   I have a Hyundai ImageQuest L70S, with built-in speakers, and I like it
very much.

Instead of purposfully screwing over the large retail establishments
by using their displays to pick a model and taking your order to the
lowest online bidder, perhaps you could take your business to one of
the smaller local retailers who also have displays you can view, pay
$10 more, and support the local economy?

Just a thought.

This has to be some great advice.  Go to the local retailers and let 
them know what you've found elsewhere, including online, at Best Buy, 
Fry's, etc.

It's bad enough that computer components are invariably made overseas 
and we can't support our local economies by purchasing local 
electronics, like we could with say, clothing, food, etc., but at least 
try to support the local establishments.

By purchasing locally you can make a difference.

Samsung makes some especially crisp monitors.  My mom loves her 18".  I 
have a 17" widescreen notebook and it's perfect for what I do.  I would 
look at a widescreen if you can afford it.  The way the real estate is 
laid out lends itself to more productivity.

It's not as if I recommended this, I said 'if you prefer'.  BestBuy and 
Fry's are not popular with some people.  They very may well have a good 
price on one as well.  I know of no local establishments that have 30+ 
displays on hand to view.  Though you may find one that's good enough. 
To each their own.

I've got two of them, and am happy.  One has a slightly blemished
cluster of pixels, but not noticable.  I have more trouble with
artifacts from my crappy video card.  I paid about $550 for the second
one in December.  Might have dropped more since then.  The nice
feature of this one is the 1600x1200 pixels.  Most others (for
tolerable prices) are 1280x1024 (or wider versions of the same
height).

Good luck.

Pete,

I can tell you that my mom's eyesight improved when I gave her a Samsung 
LCD 2 years ago for Christmas.  Significantly less eyestrain.

There are many studies that suggest when you've got a higher quality 
monitor your posture improves as well.

I would get the best quality, highest resolution and largest screen you 
can possibly afford.  Check the warranty on the item, get 3 years or 5 
years if possible.  Capital One (and other companies) offer an extra 
1-year extension to the warranty if you buy using their card.  You don't 
have to pay for it in installments, you can just put a payment on your 
card, but remember with digital - it's either on or off, it doesn't 
degrade but still work like analog does.

The warranty protection (up to 6 years if you do it right!) is the best 
thing.

Subject: [PLUG] NTP XP...
Message-ID: <1150077453.448cca0d5de38@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I've run into an interesting problem.  I'm figuring out how to propagate
NTP across my Linux servers and have found that XP can use NTP as well.
Trouble is, XP seems to be designed to hold only one hostname or ip
address for NTP.  What happens when you change the network you are
on say with a laptop?  Microsoft seems to assume that the time server
people will want to use will be on the Internet, but I don't want to
do that.  Researching NTP, there is a fair amount of talk about not
overusing the publicly available Internet time servers.  If you have
a large network, setting all the computers on it to query Internet 
based time servers would arguably be wasteful and inefficient.  Besides,
you want to decide once for your network what the time is and propagate
that time across it.

Can I distribute a subnet's time server via dhcp?

Regards,

Michael

If you hose your root, /usr, /var, etc. partitions, the problem isn't getting
grub to work.  I've figured out how to network boot, which grub by the way
supports.  Alternatives to going the etherboot/PXE, nfs. tftp-server, dhcp
route include using a tomsrootboot disk or one of the many rescue cd's.
One thing I'd like to experiment with is moving grub off of the main hard
drive onto like a usb memory stick and the boot from that.  This way if
the hard drive dies, you still have grub and are free of having to fish
around for a rescue disk.

As far as X won't start, permissions being set wrong is a very common cause
of this problem.  It may be that you can fix it.

Good Luck,

i read that amsung's lcd technology had over
others, but then that was last year.

not sure if anything will help my posture :)

Scan down to the x86 porters list and you'll find two leads for Linux, 
simonmar at microsoft.com (Simon Marlow) and simonpj at microsoft.com (Simon 
Peyton Jones). The Haskell folks I know often refer to them as "the 
Simons."

To reduce your cephalic detonation rate, I'll note that they don't 
work in Redmond, but at Microsoft Research Cambridge (UK).

My understanding of computer languages is not that extensive.  I kind of 
thought that in computer languages there were "high", "assemby" and 
"mechanical," where a compiler was necessary to *interpret* from a 
high-level language to a mechanical one enabling the computer to understand 
the human.  Therefore, I was under the impression that most of the 
programming that was done would have to utilize an High-level language.  I 
also thought that assembly languages were one step removed from a mechanical 
one, again not being utilized as often.

Yes, this kind of does sound interesting.  I know that I am in the spoon 
feeding stage on this, though and was looking to just get my feet wet.  Lisp 
sounds attractive, and I have heard about Python and Ruby.

Again, my knowledge (which can easily be incorrect) only recognizes the 
three categories....What is implied with a "functional language?"

RP, et al.:

   I can read text in both the virtual terminal applications and the GUI
applications without my reading glasses, and sitting back from the monitor.
If the text in firefox is a bit small, ctrl-+ fixes that. Only rarely do I
need the reading glasses.

   With the CRTs I used for decades before this LCDs, I needed reading glasses
almost all the time. Yuck! However, the LCD monitors do no better at spelling
and grammar than did the CRT monitors. Sigh.

YMMV,

I don't have experience with many different LCDs, but I can tell you 
that I like my Dell 20" LCD quite a bit, or at much better than my 21" 
glass tubes that it replaced which I thought were the bees knees back in 
the day.  I have the 2001FP I believe, it's been replaced by the 2007FP 
I think.

Yes.  If you're using ISC's, in your /etc/dhcpd.conf file, add (globally or
otherwise):
option ntp-servers              192.168.0.1;

However, I can't tell you if / how this will affect Windows XP.  Am assuming
it will play nice with and honor most DHCP servers.

Your understanding is correct, but amongst the "high-level" languages
(by which I mean anything less intense than Assembly, and say, more
intense than Excel or Hypercard) there are also many differences in
how much attention to you must pay to low-level details.  Generally,
the most obvious distinction between these languages is in memory
management.

In C, you must manage all the memory you use on your own -- if you
need storage for a bunch of numbers, first you have to figure out how
many numbers you will have, then you must figure out how much space
each number needs (this can differ depending on what computer the
program is run on, by the way), then you can make a call to a memory
allocation routine.  That allocation routine may or may not allocate
enough space, so you need to check for that before you use the memory.
 Finally, you can store your numbers.   If you've heard the term
"buffer overflow" in the context of security patches, or viriuses,
this is where they happen.  If you make a mistake with the memory
allocation in C, you may never notice -- everything *might* work just
fine, but one day somone may find out that under certain circumstances
your program allows anyone to overwrite the administrator password (or
something like that) because you didn't allocate memory correctly.
This is a very real problem, although it is much less of a problem
with Linux than it is with windows (because user space programs just
don't have access to things like the admin password).

The current hot Object-Oriented (OO) languages, such as Java and C#,
prevent problems like this by doing the memory management stuff for
you.  Generally speaking they do a very good job, but you might be
able to get a faster program by doing it yourself. (Emphasis on
might--it depends on many, many factors, especially since I'm not
talking about specific languages.)  C++ provides a bit of a mix
between the two -- I don't know c++ that well, but in my limited
experience with it I've found that at times I need to manage memory on
my own, and at other times it's done for me--while this is due in
large part to my ignorance of c++, both situations *are* possible,
which means that sooner or later you will have to deal with them both
if you use C++.

Having said that, regardless of the language you use, if you program
very much you will eventually need to know how memory management
works, even if you don't want to do it yourself.  (A good essay on
this can be found here:

There are many different programming paradigms, so far this thread has
mentioned three of them: Object-oriented, procedural and functional.
There are many more, contraint-based, data-flow, event-based,
logic-based, constraint-logic... etc.  The three mentioned are by far
the most common, although it is extremely difficult to classify any
single language into one paradigm.  Java is generally regarded as OO,
c is considered procedural, lisp and haskell are considered
functional.  OCaml claims to be OO/functional+some other stuff. (I say
claims only because I don't know from personal experience.)

Procedural languages are like recipies in a standard cookbook, a bunch
of instructions are listed in order.  A more complex program will
break things up -- like cooking a 7-course meal, each course might be
one recipe, but in the end it's just a list of instructions.  (Ok, ok,
in the end, *every* language is just a list of instructions, but since
we're talking about programming languages, I'm ignoring the
assembly-level details.)

Object-Oriented languages provide mechanisims for combining data and
logic in a way that can be more easily re-used.  With a procedural
language there generally aren't a lot of ties between the data and the
logic that manages that data, so you have to pass around the data and
the logic separately.  OO offers a solution to that by letting you
combine data and logic into reusable objects.  If procedures in
procedural languages are like recipes, Objects are like frozen dinners
-- the recipe and the food is combined.

Functional programs are more like mathematical proofs.  The core ideal
in a functional language is that everything is a function, and data is
never changed.  Therefore, if you want the some bit of data (say the
date) you call a function that returns the date, rather than accessing
a variable that already has the date stored in it.  This means that
you never need to worry about storage, or updating variables, or a
bunch of other things.  As long as every function knows exactly how to
do what it does, at any time, then things will work.  (As an aside,
this is a good thing to aim for in *any* language.)  One of the most
amazing things about functional languages is that functions are
treated as first-class citizens -- that is, they can be passed around
just like varibales and values in a procedural language!

So, if you need a function that does a very specific thing, you can
write another function that *creates* that function when the program
is run, and then you can run the created function later.  You can do
some of this with Object oriented languages, but functional languages
generally make it easier.

Finally, you can program in any paradigm in pretty much any language.
It's possible to write functional C, and you can write procedural
lisp.  Many paradigms aren't mutually exclusive either --
Object-Oriented languages involve lots of procedural elements, and as
I eluded to above, they have some functional aspects as well.
Regardless of the language, if you do any work with interfaces you
will need to use some sort of event-based paradigm.

I'd like to chime in on this discussion...

For the last 5 months, I have been purchasing Dell LCD's. The price is very
competitive and the quality is outstanding.

I'm not a big Dell fan, but the product is decent. Especially with the wide
aspect displays. I purchase the 2007FPW 20.1" 16:9 aspect for $370. This is
pricing through the small business plan. Home is slightly more but I believe
you will find the cost difference negligible considering what you get. The
wide display is easy to configure in your xorg.conf file too.

I can give you an example nvidia based xorg.conf file if you need it.

If you have only a few Linux machines, it isn't a big advantage having
a local time server.  I have one because I need a machine to act as an
bridge.  You will need to run ntpd on all the Linux machines anyway
and can point them to the ISP, distro, or pool.ntp.org servers.  If
you have a big server farm, then having a local time server can be
important.

Install ntpd. On Debian, it is ntp-server package.  On Fedora, ntp
package.  Edit /etc/ntp.conf to set the servers.  I use the
pool.ntp.org servers:

server 0.us.pool.ntp.org
server 1.us.pool.ntp.org
server 2.us.pool.ntp.org

Then, open up access to local clients:

restrict 192.168.1.0  mask  255.255.255.0 nomodify

Then point the clients to the server.

server 192.168.1.10

You've already heard others talk about driving LCD monitors at their
native resolution.  That is part of their specs, and not hard to 
find out.  Most 19 inchers are 1280x960, but some are 1600x1200 .

This can be a problem if you like filling the screen with two
80-character-across Xterms;  the native resolutions at which this
works are 1012+ (6px/char) , 1332+ (8 pix/char) , 1652/10 , and
so forth.  1024 works great, 1280 loses 7 characters or else makes
the windows too small, 1600 loses 6 characters, etc.  I suppose the
best answer is to get a Really Big Monitor, so it doesn't matter
if you aren't using all the screen space for your xterms.

I have a Sun-to-VGA converter, feeding a VGA video switch, so this is
a workable solution ... for a CRT.  But see below for an LCD.

Buzzz.  Sorry, wrong answer.  I made the same assumption when I bought 
a Viewsonic VA912B 19inch LCD for my wife's office.  I even carefully
constructed a CD of test images (and put them on my USB key, too) and
went around to the various stores looking at the different monitors. 
I did most of the looking and got the most cooperation from CompUSA
in Tigard.  Then I called Enu, and went off to buy the one they
claimed to have in stock.  Oops, it was reserved by another customer. 
I spent an hour going there, and then (pissed off) going back to
CompUSA where I made the purchase.  

Then I got the LCD home, and tried the test images with the builtin
video from the Shuttle mini-ATX computer I was putting together for
her.

Yikes!!!!  (this is the "wrong answer" part...)

The HD15 VGA video put out by the computer had enough time wander to
seriously screw up the image quality of the VA912B .  Unlike a CRT,
the pixels of an LCD are discrete horizontally, and so the LCD monitor
circuitry must sample the signal coming in and compute an average
video value to stuff into the pixel.  Now imagine a checkerboard
array of black and white pixels (like the "grey" image in the back
of an X display).  As the sampling point moves over this video signal,
it will see alternating black and white sine wave (the edges don't
stay sharp, sigh).  It is supposed to find the middle of the black
pixel and then the middle of the white pixel and sample at the
center point.  But if the sampling is a bit off, it will sample
over at the edge of the pixel, and the level will be a bit off. 
During the next screen pass, the timing may have shifted by a
nanosecond or so, and the sample will occur elsewhere - a
different video level.

What all this does is give you NASTY moire patterns on the LCD -
really nauseating.  Okay, so you think you can live without alternating
pixel checkerboards?  You get the same effect if you put up an Xterm
with a row of "m" characters across;  the vertical bars and spaces
of the character are one pixel wide on my display.  Xterms with
6 pixel character spacings are really nauseating to look at, and I
spend a LOT of time looking at those.

Next I tried a different VGA video card plugged into the Shuttle's
single PCI slot.  It STILL looked like crap.  So why didn't I see
that in the store?  Still a mystery, but I think there are some
tricks the Shuttles play with the system clock, purposely drifting
it to reduce narrowband radio interference.  Your mileage may
definitely vary.

The solution?  The LCD monitor also had a DVI input.  I found a DVI
video card (also at CompUSA, also after looking at the little stores
and failing to find a PCI compatable card that would fit the single
PCI slot of the little computer) and hooked that up instead.  Moire
went away.  It looks good.  BTW, the mini-ATX computer is running 
SUSE 10, which found the ATI video card and the Viewsonic monitor
with no problems.

Consider, if you will, the differences between SUN native resolution
and the LCD native resolution.  I'm not sure how adjustable the SUN
video is,  but when I use the SUN into a CRT I rely on the multisync
of the CRT to make things right.  Now we are adding sampling, in both
the X /and/ Y directions.  We are also adding the Sun to VGA interface
box, and also the video switch, which will add time jitter to the video.
I imagine the video result will look like the dogs breakfast.

So, I strongly suggest you get a DVI video card for the Linux PC,
and drive a dual-input monitor directly.  You can connect the HD15
VGA cable off the SUN to the monitor as well, and use the monitor
itself to do the switching (check the manual to make sure you can
do this).  The Sun will look like crap, but at least the Linux box
will look OK.  For quality images off the Sun, well, that is why X
is designed to work over networks!

The moire patterns with the Viewsonic may be specific to the 
Viewsonic and the particular video output of the Shuttle; but the
VA912B was one of the best looking in the store, the rest looked
pretty bad with some of the test images /on their computer/,  driving
a video splitter and a bunch of monitors together through their
VGA analog ports.  

You really do need to test these LCD monitors, ideally with the
video sources and types of displays you plan to drive them with. 
You can look at the set I used at
   http://www.keithl.com/monitortest/test.html
(I took out a few with private stuff on them).
These were mostly so my wife could see what it looked like;  
women are wired with more color processing than men, so bring 
along a female when deciding what the colors should look like.

Note also, as I mentioned a few days ago to Rich, there are 
tradeoffs between viewing angle and contrast and response 
speed.  Fast monitors may have lower contrast, and look bad
off-axis.  The worst direction is off axis into the corners,
the "boss looking over your shoulder" direction.  If you will be
using your LCD for color proofs to show your boss, that is quite
different than an LCD for looking at videos or playing games.

Get a good return and refund policy!  Your setup has enough risks
that you may go through a few monitors before you find one that
really works.

And yes, it would be nice to buy locally.  If you can work with
a local shop with demo monitors in the store, and they will let
you drag your whole setup in for some tests, that would be perfect.
We don't have a store that does that out here in Beaverton;  they
either don't have the monitors in stock, or they don't have a
place you can set up your own machines.   There are probably
places in Portland that do, and if we had not been trying to get
this done on one Saturday afternoon, we might have gone to them.

In the interim, Free Geek probably has a big heap of Sun 19 inch
monitors that they will give you for 10 bucks or so (my guess,
they want them OUTA THERE).  You can use that while you shop,
then take it back to Free Geek in a couple of weeks, and pay
another $10 to have the damn thing recycled.  You are going
to Free Geek to recycle your current dead 19 incher, anyway.

At the end of the selection and upgrade process, LCD monitors
are much nicer looking and more environmentally friendly than
the big hot glass CRTs.  When my 19 inchers die, I will replace
them with LCD monitors.

I think I just wrote a magazine article ...

Be sure you know the dead pixel policy.  Generally, dead pixels are not 
considered a defect and are not covered under the warranty.  You may 
want to buy from a local store which has a no-questions-asked 30-day 
return policy so you can return it if there are dead pixels.

Philips has a zero-dead-pixel policy on certain models; they call it 
their "Perfect Panel" warranty.

I don't have one, so I can't comment on quality.

Does anyone else know of any manufacturers with zero-dead-pixel policies?

depends on your hub or switch.
Newer switches have auto sensing such that you
don't need a cross-over.
Older hubs that have a uplink port don't need a cross-over if you use
the uplink port.
A hub or switch that has neither will need the cross-over cable.

I think that's wrong.  The Cisco 678's (and 675's before them) came
with yellow cross-over cables that were used to connect directly to a
PC NIC (I've got just such a cable connected right now, I am talking
through it).  That implies you'd want a straight-through for a
hub/switch.

I think Russell is right.. but it's one of those "do it and see" types of
questions.
Got link light? You can answer the question yourself in 4.2 seconds.

BTW if you're in bridged mode, you surely don't want to plug it into a hub.
I hope "hub" was a typo for "switch" :)

And what is a Windows CD? I bet you can open it in Linux and read the
manuals, just don't try to click setup.exe and expect it to work :)
But google works too.

Hrm, perhaps I need coffee.

the 678 will plug directly into a switch/hub. the cross
over cable is needed when plugging into a non auto sensing
nic.

toss the cd into the trash ..

to program your 678 there is a serial port and if you have
the cisco cable it is configured to plug into a PC 9-pin
serial port.

some usefull url's i got doing a google search

http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/dsl_prod/c600s/

did you get the doc cd ?

this may be the latest pdf


http://tinyurl.com/3gfy9


if your going with qwest just call their tech support
and say this is the 'modem' you got from them.

make sure the firmware is at least 2.4.6

if you need to reset the passwords and or reset the
unit to 'factory' configuration there are sites on
the net you can find or email me

thats all i can remember .. the rest is written down
at home

Mine is a 1216. Amazon told us that the new turntable has shipped, so 
once we get it and give it a try, I'll decide if I want to let go of the 
old turntable. I have thought of trying to replace the underside with 
something else, like a direct drive, but I'm also aware that the motors 
in these things are a little special, as in having more stability in 
their speed, so that's probably not going to happen -- certainly not 
anytime soon.

I think I always just used the default filter. As I recall (it's been a 
year or more since I recorded anything), when I tried selecting 
something else, I ran into trouble. It did take a bit of getting used to 
the user interface, but it seemed to work fine.

I've had that problem, too, and am careful to have something to read, 
when I set out to record something, so I don't have to walk around.

I could set up my recording location in the basement, on the concrete 
floor, which should minimize the floor bounce effect. That's where my 
machine with the decent sound card is, too.

direct drive was quite the challenge for turntables. I use
to have an AES article on the development hurdles. That filtering
performed by a belt sure made it easy.

I still have my Technics SP-10MKII one of the few DD's that could
do 78 RPM. Replaced the crystal with a function generator since
most 78's are not 78 RPM but thats another tread not for this list.

Would be interesting if one could get the A/D -> USB module
by it self.... hmm somewhere i have a USB developers kit from
Cyprus semi ...maybe this winter.

If you are doing this for only one or two people then it is proably better
to have them point at an upstream news server at your ISP.

Who are you getting a feed from? You realize that a full newsfeed eats

Good lord.  I guess that's one way to keep 'em out of the binary groups.
Have you looked at nntpcache and/or leafnode?

I'm not going to run a full newsfeed. I have a few dozen

Have you ever asked for help in a Debian support channel? You might as
well ask a Vogon to rescue his mother from the ravenous bugbladder beast
of traal.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0606150719160.29912@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I would greatly appreciate the collective intelligence here in helping me
to restore clear sound in played videos. Since it deteriorated, what I hear
was described by others suffering from the same situation (found on Google)
as "a chipmunk talking through a rotating fan." High pitched, garbled,
choppy.

   This occurs with RealPlayer10Gold installed, and videos from reuters.com or
Google videos. Doesn't matter if I use firefox-1.5.0.4 or opera-8.5.4.

   Now, when I download an .avi file from Google video and play it with
mplayer, it sounds just fine. This leads me to suspect that the browsers are
calling realplay, and that cannot handle the .avi format. Therefore, it seems
to me that I need to call mplayer rather than realplay from the two browsers.


   Can someone here tell me where I make this change? I assume that in firefox
it's somewhere in about:config ... but where?

TIA,

Rich

If you install Mplayerplug-in (http://mplayerplug-in.sourceforge.net) it will 
automatically show the videos in your browser window without any further 
user-interaction needed. Works pretty good for a lot of video formats.

Auke,

   According to the mplayerplug-in page, I need either mozilla-devel or
gecko-sdk. I cannot find either one. Google found a couple of references to
mozilla's site, but the URI to the sdk refers to 1.4a, and it's not
available. Firefox-1.5.0.4 uses gecko-1.8 and I cannot find that one, either.
There are no Slackware packages for either one.

   Changing the preference in firefox to call mplayer instead of gxine didn't
help.

Thanks,

Rich

Auke,

   This is interesting. Neither browser (firefox-1.5.0.4, opera-8.5.4) will
produce clear sound when either gxine or mplayer is specified as the
application to play .avi files (and the application is shut down and
restarted). But, both gxine and mplayer will produce clear sound on the same
.avi file when run as stand-alone applications.

   My Google searches have found quite a few hits of folks suffering the same
problem, but no solutions that have worked for me.

   Have you suggestions what to check next?

Rich

Hello

VMware Server RC1 and Windows 2003 Server R2 64-bit host operating system are not working well together.  Each idle VM guest is chewing up about 50% of a processor.  This is *totally* unacceptable! 

I'm ready to swith to RH Linux 64-bit host operating system.

I'd appreciate hearing others experiences running Linux 64-bits and VMware Server.

Thanks ...John

Personally, I have never been fond of VMWare.  It has always seemed like
a resource hog to me.  You'd be better of going with Xen on linux.  See
this article for some information:

Subject: [PLUG] Help with ~/.emacs
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0606151606110.29912@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I have most file modes colored as I'd like them in emacs, but the newly
added .ris is not what I want. The colors were set for a white background
rather than a black background in emacs.

   Below is my .emacs file. The colors I'd like to see with .ris files are on
lines 172-174. But, the ris.el file's call at the bottom overrides these
colors.

   Those of you who use emacs as your OS can most likely see the conflict
right away. Please pass me a clue on what to do here.

Thanks,

Rich

I took a peek at ris.el, and it looks like ris sets up its own color scheme:

(set-face-foreground 'ris-main-face "maroon")
(set-face-foreground 'ris-main-ltd-face "dark orchid")
(set-face-foreground 'ris-tag-face "blue")
(set-face-foreground 'ris-tyer-tag-face "red")
(set-face-foreground 'ris-author-face "sea green")
(set-face-foreground 'ris-pubyear-face "IndianRed2")
(set-face-foreground 'ris-reprint-face "deep pink")

I'd try setting these variables to the colors that you want.  (And
I'll bet that you'll have to set them after loading ris.el.)

Auke,

   Mplayerplug-in fails to build beause it cannot find the xpcom library. I
searched with Google for a copy of the library (or its source) but cannot
find it. Do you have suggestions of what I could do?

   I don't care if I use Mplayer, gxine, or xine. So far I cannot get any of
them to work with either firefox-1.5.0.4 or opera-8.5.4, and both used to
play videos (with RealPlayer8) just fine.

Sigh,

Rich

   More Googling found <https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/446>. I installed
that and configured it with /usr/bin/mplayer, /usr/bin/gxine, and
/usr/bin/xine. No clear sound.

   How strange!

xpcom is part of firefox/mozilla. You'll probably need to tell mplayerplug-in 
where it's at. My distro does this for me without problems (finds it 
automatically), but you may need to figure it out for yours yourself.

Auke,

   I was looking for xpcom, not libxpcom so I didn't find it. I had to make
symlinks to all the libs in /usr/lib/firefox-1.5.0.4 to /usr/lib before it
would compile.

   After reonfiguring and rebuilding the make install failed because the
script could not find mozilla; well, firefox is installed, not mozilla.
install.sh says to do it manually in this case.

   Then I copied all /usr/lib/firefox-1.5.0.4/*.so to ~/.mozilla/plugins, and
make symlinks from all /usr/lib/firefox-1.5.0.4/*.xpt to
/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/.

   Something is still missing, however, because it's not working as expected
when I start firefox and try to watch a video stream of the World Cup. Any
idea what I've not yet done?

Many thanks,

Rich

   OK. I went back to the mplayerplug-in site and followed all the
configuration steps. Then I went to the testing site, and both .avi and .mpeg
videos played -- after opening gxine! The former had sound, the latter
didn't.

   Thinking I had it working properly, I tried a google video .avi. Still
garbled sound. Now I've no idea where to look.

To solve (2), setup subversion, post-commit hook (to propogate server

(liberally.)  To solve (1), use last checkin date.  (via svn:keywords)

This is an unofficial announcement, but Alan was still looking yesterday

I contacted Ward Cunningham about speaking at Advanced Topics on 
Monday, and he and colleague Bjorn Freeman-Benson will be available!
Here is what Ward sent:

So do your homework, and get there early, this will be a popular meeting.
And as Alan would say, this offer void where prohibited by natural law!

Our next Linux Clinic will be Sunday, June 18 at Free Geek.  There
will be internet access, wifi, distros, monitors, keyboards, mice,
helpful people, and cookies!  

Every third Sunday of the month, from 1PM to 5PM, folks are invited
to bring their Linux questions (and answers), Linux computers (and
wanna-bes) or even just their curiosity, to:

   FREE GEEK
   Community Technology Center
   1731 SE 10th Avenue
   Portland, OR 97214
   503-232-9350

Directions here: http://www.freegeek.org/map.php
Map: http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=1731+SE+10th+Avenue+97214

NOTE: Free Geek is closed during the Linux Clinic, and they won't be
answering the phones.  Please enter through the south door, next to
the Thrift Store.  We'll have a sign by the door.

The next few clinics are on:
   July   16
   August 20
   September 17
 
Keith

P.S.  Rumors of a "Fry's cheap garbage wifi hardware smash" in
the street outside are greatly exaggerated but understandable.

I plan on attending to get two items sorted out: upgrade from Kubuntu Breezy and 
getting  Firefox to show me Flash videos.

What do I need to bring other than my computer (monitor, keyboard, mouse)?  (I 
would prefer not to lug the monitor.)

Message-ID: <44934D3E.8010806@comcast.net>

The turntable arrived. I was surprised to find that the platter is
plastic, and doesn't weigh very much. But, we'll see if that matters. It
assembled easily and the instructions for balancing the tone arm are
clear. You can download the instruction manual from the Ion website. Go 
to: http://www.ion-audio.com/ then click on "Support" and find pdf's for 
the iTTUSB Turntable and Software Installation Guides.

The supplied Audacity software is for either Win or Mac, so I tried it
on my laptop first. Installation was simple, as was recording. Exporting
to MP3 required going out on the web and finding lame_enc.dll (I don't
recall the URL, but it was the first one Google presented when searching
for lame_enc.dll.)

Next, I loaded Audacity on this machine (SuSE 9.1). YaST put an icon for
it in <Green Button> - Multimedia - Media Editing. The version YaST gave
me is 1.2.0. The one supplied on the CD is 1.2.3. I've read a review
that talks about 1.2.4, so I'll have to go get it and give it a try.

(Still with version 1.2.0 and 1.2.3):
Configuration is supposed to be in two steps. First, you're supposed to,
"Click on Microphone in the drop down menu and select 'Stereo Mix.'" My
Win version does not have that drop down box. My Linux version does have
the box with several options, non of which mention USB or Stereo Mix.

The rest of the configuration is done from a Preferences entry on the
File menu (both Win & Linux versions). In the Win version, under the
Audio I/O tab, there is an option for recording from a USB device (in my
case it says USB Audio CODEC, the documentation says it might say
something else depending on the installation, but that the initials USB
should be in the list entry). The other two options are MS Sound Mapper
- Input, and Realtek HD Audio input. The Linux version does not have the
USB option, only /dev/dsp.

So, I guess before I go further, I should go get the 1.2.4 version for
Linux and install it.

...Hours later...

According to README.txt, in order to compile Audacity, I have to have 
wxWidgets installed. I'm still waiting for that compile to finish. I 
guessed which version to use (x11) -- the README file does not say. I 
have the GTK version, but ./configure for Audacity says that's not the 
one it wants.

Meanwhile, I have recorded Side one of Days of Future Passed, by The 
Moody Blues, exported it to MP3, copied it to my RH 7.0 system and 
played it through the living room stereo. Other than  few scratches, it 
sounds pretty good. I'll need to spend some more time with the filters 
in Audacity to see what they can do.

Assuming the two compiles finish sometime this evening, I'll try the 
newer version of Audacity on this machine and report on the USB 
functionality. The turntable itself seems to work well.

One thing to watch is to be sure the correct speed is selected. The 
first recording I made was of an old Stereo demo record from the 1960's. 
I didn't notice that somehow the 45RPM button was selected. Not to 
worry. The Audacity software has a feature to convert the speed from 45 
to 33-1/3, as well as several other options. They discourage it if you 
are fussy about the sound quality. It seemed to be OK on the one I did, 
although I have yet to listen to it on the living room system.

Dennis,

I'll try to make it, but I recently upgraded from Breezy to Dapper and
was unable to view Flash in Firefox.  I fixed the problem.  I will mail
you off-line with the instructions in the event I can't make it.

Sounds like and issue with Wx Widgets.

I went to the audacity site and they said this:

"Audacity 1.2 needs wxGTK 2.4, compiled *without* the gtk2 or unicode

I have those working on Breezy, but I did it by installing Frefox 32 +
Flash in a chroot environment. I can help you get that set up at the
clinic. However, you might want to moving to Dapper, which I am about
to do. From reading the Ubuntu user forums it appears that it may be
possible to get these working in Dapper without a chroot envirnoment.

There are monitors at Free Geek that you can borrow. However, I don't
know what resolution they support. I have never even seen one at Free
Geek in operation, so I can't even guess what they will run. I would
definitely recommend bringing the rest, at least. Mouse and keyboard
are not hard to truck around, so it's worth the trouble of hauling them
to Free Geek so as not to run into problems. Waerst thou me I would
bring the monitor as well.

The issue I ran into with the upgrade from Breezy to Dapper (5.1 to 6.1)
was an older libflashplugin.so in one of the plugin directories.  If I
recall correctly, it was a libflash4 when it should have been a
libflash7.  I found the correct one on my system, removed the symlink to
libflash4 and created one to libflash7.  Restarting Firefox, Flash from
youtube.com and other sites then worked.

Subject: [PLUG] I should have known better
Message-ID: <20060617172140.2443fe59.johnxj@comcast.net>

Than to try to install Dapper by myself. Was going to at the Clinic
tomorrow. But Friday I handed in the last paper and then participated
in the year-end parties to celebrate. And this morning I just couldn't
wait. I had to try out Dapper.

Previously I had burned the 64-bit DVD, so I put it in the drive and
restarted. Turns out it is not just an install DVD, it is also a live
DVD. So it just booted up Dapper-64. So I played with it for awhile,
checking out what worked and what didn't. Turns out everything that
didn't work in Breezy-64 still doesn't work in Dapper-64 -- Flash,
Acroread 7, RealPlayer, Totem. (Totem at least stays up now; but it
still won't play a DVD.) I also noted that Synaptic listed far fewer
applications, even though it seemed to have all the repositories. But
the repositories all have different names, so who knows? 

At the last Clinic I replaced my 60 GB 4200 rpm hard disk with a shiny
new 80 GB 7200 rpm hard disk. When I formatted the new hard disk I
created a 60 GB partition for Ubuntu and left the remainder unused. It
was my plan to use that 20 GB to do a trial install of Dapper-64 later
after it was released. So after playing with the live DVD for a bit I
decided to do exactly that. The live DVD places a big icon on the
desktop that says "Install" on it in big letters. I clicked on it, and
a window popped up offering to install Dapper. 

By default it wanted to install it on the entire hard disk and reformat
it in the process. It took a bit of clicking around, but I finally
found the unused 20 GB. I told it to create HD3 on it and make it 8 GB,
and to install Dapper-64 on it. It proceeded to create the partition
and format it. I watched the progress meter and it definitely stopped
formatting at 8 GB (an important fact, as we shall see later). After it
finished the installation I restarted. Previously there were no boot
options, because the only OS on the computer was Breezy-64. When I
turned the computer on it always just booted by itself unattended. But
now I got a list of choices:

Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.15-25-amd64-generic
Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.15-25-amd64-generic recovery mode
Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.15-23-amd64-generic
Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.15-23-amd64-generic recovery mode
Ubuntu memtest
Other operating systems
Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.12-10-amd64-generic default (on /dev/hda2)
Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.12-10-amd64-generic default (on /dev/hda2) rec. mode 
Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.12-9-amd64-generic default (on /dev/hda2)
Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.12-9-amd64-generic default (on /dev/hda2) rec. mode 
(plus another set but I must not have written it down -- I know
       there were six here) 
Ubuntu memtest

So I let it just go ahead and run the one on the top. It booted up just
fine, except, of course, it lacked anything but the default
applications and settings. I played around with it for a bit, installed
a couple applications, checked out Totem again and noted it still
wouldn't play a DVD. I had been reading the Dapper-64 forum and I knew
that there was a new script to install all kinds of stuff, called
Automatix. So I downloaded it and tried it out (the script works only
on Dapper). Supposedly it will install Flash, Acroread 7, RealPlayer,
and the Mozilla plugins so they will work in Firefox-64. There were
several other choices on the menu, and I selected some of them,
including the nVidia proprietary drivers. (The open source nv driver
was what kept Totem from playing DVDs before on Breezy -- it worked
there after I installed the nVidia drivers.) The script finished, and
said I'd need to restart, so I shut down and restarted.

This time during the boot process it stopped and announced that the
filesystem had been mounted 30 times and a forced fsck was required. (I
had noted previously that it had said it had only a couple mounts left
before this would happen.) I let it proceed. And then it stopped the
fsck and announced that the drive had errors, and asked if I wanted it
to fix them. I told it to go ahead. I have no idea what it means, but
it found several messed up inodes. It said it fixed all of them. And
then it proceeded to finish booting.

When it came back up the first thing I noted was the nVidia
splashscreen. Then it gave me the login window. During the installation
it had asked for a username, so I had given it jjj and a password.
After logging in I tried Totem, and it happily started playing a DVD.
Then I tried Firefox, but no Acroread plugin, no Flash. From a command
line I tried to launch Acroread and RealPlayer, but they wouldn't
launch. 

To check out whether they were installed I fired up Nautilus and looked
at the filesystem. Wait ... what's this "chroot" folder? I clicked on
Home and there was my alternate username jxj ... then I clicked on my
jjj folder and ... wait ... here are all my files ... why are all my
files here on this new 8 GB partition? ... pause while the gears in the
upper story turn ... OMFG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Nooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The sumbitch installed itself on top of my Breezy installation. 

And I don't mean an Upgrade. It was a complete new install. All my
programs gone. All my settings gone. Hundreds and hundreds of personal
settings. Aaaaaaaaaaaargh!!!!!!!!!!!

OK, I still have the old hard drive, still sitting in the USB enclosure
that I put it in after last month's clinic. Any settings changed since
last month would be gone, but practically everything should still be
there. Someone here once told me (while we were discussing backups)
that all those configurations are in .files in the user folder. I
turned on Show Hidden Files and they all seemed to be there. So why
didn't the new install use them? Hmmm. I fired up OpenOffice.org Writer
and it came up just like a new install. I have at least a hundred
settings just for Writer, and none of them were being used. <sigh>

OK, maybe if I boot some of those other options that Grub gave me. I
shut down and restarted, then chose the 2.6.15-23  option. It still
came up with the new install. Shut down and restart ... and this time I
tried the 2.6.12-10 option. Still came up with the new install. Tried
over and over. Everything came up with the new install. But wait ...
that can't be.  How could I be booting Dapper if I selected the
2.6.12-10 kernel? Maybe Grub is screwed up? Maybe that's what it
displays to me, but what it actually points at is the new install?

OK, shutdown and go for a walk. Screw it. There will be smart people at
the Clinic tomorrow.

Back home a couple hours later I decided to restart the computer. I
just let it start up the top listing, the 2.6.15-25 kernel. When it
came up I looked at the filesystem to peruse the .files again. Wait ...
where are they? They were all here a couple hours ago. Wait, chroot is
missing too. All my files are missing ... WTF? (I did have enough sense
to use Kdar to make a full backup this morning before embarking on this
escapade.) 

OK, this is not making any sense. I *know* those files were all there a
couple hours ago. 

Never mind. Shut down and restart. This time I'll choose the top
2.6.12-10 boot option. It proceeded to boot. And when it got to
Configuring Network Interfaces it suddenly hung. Now, y'all are
probably thinking I was getting ready to throw this whole thing into
the river. But actually I was thrilled. You see, my old install always
used to do that. Could it be it is booting my old Breezy? Fingers
crossed ... waiting ... waiting ... OMG it did!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm back!
YAY!!!!!!!!!!!

OK, right now I have no idea what is going on. All I know is that my
old Breezy is running, Sylpheed finds all my mail folders and address
books, Firefox comes up with all my bookmarks; everything is as it was.
Is there a new 8 GB partition out there somewhere? Maybe. I fired up
Krusader to use its Mountman utility, but it just showed all the old
stuff. No new hd3 drive. "Mount" from the command line just shows
everything it always did.

OK, it's running and I'm not turning it off. Not until I bring it to
the Clinic tomorrow. Then maybe someone can help me figure stuff out.

***RJS Templates for Rails (PDF)
Publisher: O'Reilly

perform multiple page updates in-place without a page reload using Ajax.
All the JavaScript you need is generated from simple templates written
in Ruby. This document helps you get acquainted with how RJS templates
fit into the Rails framework and gets you started with a few
easy-to-follow examples.

OK, fdisk -l shows:

jjj at Devil5:~$ sudo fdisk -l
Password:

Disk /dev/hda: 80.0 GB, 80026361856 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 9729 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes

Device Boot     Start   End          Blocks    Id   System
/dev/hda1            1      125      1004031   82  Linux swap / Solaris 
/dev/hda2          126   7421   58605120   83  Linux
/dev/hda3         7422  8441     8193150   83  Linux

So there it is. Exactly as it is supposed to be.

The mystery is why, when booting the new Dapper, it showed all my old
files. There are two possibilities, as far as I can figure. 1) The new
Dapper mounted my Breezy /dev/hda2 somewhere, and the blond boy got
confused and wandered into it by mistake, thus thinking Dapper had been
installed over the old Breezy installation or, 2) the messed up inodes
were the culprit and I'm not as blond as I seem. It would make me feel
much better if it turns out to be (2). I offer only one fact in support
of (2): I booted all five possibilities (two Dapper, three Breezy) and
each time I got Dapper, and I'm pretty sure each time all my files were
there, and each time I got the "fsck needed" warning and used Ctrl-D to
ignore it and boot anyway. It was AFTER I finally let it fix the
filesystem problems, which it said were messed up inodes, that booting
one of the Breezy options worked properly. I haven't tried anything since.

Besides getting messed up, what do inodes do?

Message-ID: <20060618211447.b4cbee96.johnxj@comcast.net>

Got home from the Clinic. Booted up, went to update my Breezy to
Dapper. Started with Update Manager, but it said a couple dozen
packages could not be updated unless I used "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
from the command line. I decided to use that option.

It downloaded a gig of new files (25 minutes at home), then started the
upgrade. A few moments later it stopped. It said that the configuration
file /etc/login something or another needed to be changed and did I
want to (choose several options). I selected "D" which was "tell me
more about the options" since I did not understand a word of what they
said. This caused the terminal to spew out a couple pages, none of
which was any more comprehensible. At the bottom of the screen it said
"END." Well, when you're in a man page and it says "END" you hit Ctrl-z
to get out, right? So that's what I did. Whereupon it announced that
the "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" process had terminated by user input.

Tip to programmers: Give the user an effin' CLUE. Some of us were not
born knowing how to run Linux from the command line.

So there I was sitting at a command prompt. The upgrade had started,
but not gone far. What to do? I decided just to restart the upgrade. So
I arrowed up and gave it the "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" line again.
This restarted the process, and it seemed to proceed sort of from where
it left off, except I couldn't tell exactly where it left off. At least
it definitely did not re-download the files. It quickly got to the same
configuration file problem. This time I wisely selected Y (select the
developer's file). It proceeded to spew out pages and pages of stuff it
was doing. It all looked good, except that every once in a while I
noticed "Warning: Unable to delete old directory /x/x/x/. The directory
is not empty." This happened a couple dozen times over the next hundred
pages that flowed through the terminal window.

Finally it got sort of to the end, and announced that there were unmet
dependencies. Lots of them. It suggested "sudo apt - something" (can't
remember now) that would resolve the dependencies. I did so. It seemed
to fix some things, but a few refused to be fixed. Finally I decided
I'd done all I could do. I shut down and rebooted.

When it came back up there were pages of error messages during the boot
process, X wouldn't start, and I was staring at a command line. I
fiddled around a bit, then finally gave up. There are three old Breezy
selections on the Grub boot menu, and each has a recovery mode option.
I tried them all, but no hope. The recovery mode options just dump me
at a command line. That would be wonderful if I had any idea what to do
at the command line. I tried the "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" line
again, but it did no more than it had done before when the GUI was
still running, i.e., nothing other than announce there were unmet
dependencies.

I am currently booted into the new Dapper installation on the new 8 GB
partition. Someone (at a Clinic, IIRC) told me that application
configuration files were located in hidden . folders in the user's home
folder. This new Dapper installation automatically mounts the old hda2
Breezy partition, so I dragged OO.o's . folder from there into the /home/jjj/
folder here, then fired up OO.o. Yay! It worked. Then I installed
Sylpheed and did the same for its . configuration file. Yay! The mail
folders are missing, but all my accounts are here. So I can send this
to the list and see any responses. (I could also do it from my Windows
desktop, but that would be caving in to the empire.)

Right now I am thinking of just taking the Ubuntu-64 Dapper DVD that I
burned and use it to do a new install over my old Breezy hda2
partition. I do have the USB hard disk with a complete copy of that
partition that I made at the Clinic this afternoon, grace of Aaron's
rescue CD. I could grab the . configuration files off it. Or maybe,
just maybe, a new installation in that partition would leave the old
files there. Any suggestions welcome. Meantime, this new Dapper uses
the nVidia drivers so I can watch movies. It's 9:00 and that's how I'm
going to end this frustrating Sunday. Tomorrow morning I'd decide what
to do about my hosed Breezy installation.

No.  CTRL-Z suspends a process in bash.  Do you just run your machine with 
an ever-rising number of suspended "man" processes?

You quit the pager with Q.

You rebooted in the middle of a failing upgrade.  Your system told you 
very clearly that your upgrade didn't go the way it should and that 
packages were not upgraded properly... and you rebooted the machine -- a 
process that requires the system to go back and reload all of the running 
programs that were working just fine in memory now (but, as your machine 
just clearly told you, might not be in good shape on disk) from disk.

So you look at the packages with unmet dependences and address them one at 
a time, either resolving the dependency problem or removing the package as 
is appropriate.

Now, I don't know anything about "Breezy" and "Dapper", but I know that 
you shouldn't be getting unmet dependency issues from a stable version 
using official repositories.  Are you upgrading to a stable version from 
official repositories?

If so, then you are in one of two situations:  There's a temporary fubar 
at the repository and if you keep updating your apt-cache (with apt-get 
update) and trying the upgrade again, it'll fix get fixed when the 
repository's back in order OR your distribution is maintained by lunkheads 
and you should probably go to something more reasonable.  I use Debian 
myself.

Um, why did you create new home directories?!?

Probably your mail is in ~/mail or ~/Mail.  I only use Sylpheed with an 
IMAP account, so there are no local mail folders.  However, pine and mutt 
keep their mail in ~/mail.  These are not considered "application 
configuration data", of course.  This is your personal data and 
application-independent.

Again, what's wrong with your home directories that you're only grabbing 
the dotfiles?

No, ctrl+z suspends the active terminal application.  Use fg to resume 
it.  bg to resume it in the background.  You hit "q" to get out of less 
or a man page once you're done with it.

Don't use ctrl+z unless you want to suspend the application you're using 
to do something else...

In my mind, I wasn't in an application. An application is OpenOffice.org Writer. It is Sylpheed. It is Firefox. It is NOT a terminal window. But that is really irrelevant.

My bitch is that YOU know how to get out of the situation, but I did not. I am an ordinary user. It would have taken maybe ten seconds for the developer to have added a line after "END" that said how to get out of it. Instead, the developer assumed I had your knowledge of Linux. As a result I am now faced with the problem of how to clean up a godawful mess. I refuse to accept the blame for poor documentation.

OK, I'm going to shut up now and go to bed. In the morning perhaps I will be in a better mood.

Your bitch is really with Ubuntu, so take it up with them, because
your rants here (while they might make you feel better and might even
elicit temporary relief) aren't going to make Ubuntu any better, which
is probably what you ultimately want.

You need to expand your mental constructs.  A narrow-mind is not generally 
a flexible mind.

Well, who made you think CTRL-Z was the right thing to do to quit your 
pager?

Yeah, I had to reboot my computer every couple of hours when I was working 
because there were these freakin' windows all over the place and it just 
got clogged up and I couldn't work effectively.   Instead, I just rebooted 
the machine every few hours and that cleared the desktop and gave me a 
nice surface.

Then somebody came along and showed me that clicking the X in the window 
would close it or I could click "File" and then a box pops up where I have 
to then click "Quit" or sometimes I have to actually type "exit" in a 
terminal.  It would have taken the programmers two seconds to add a line 
that would pop up a message telling me how to close the window when I was 
done with the application, but instead they assumed I had a working 
knowledge of desktop windowing environment!  As a result, I had all kinds 
of wasted time and lost productivity.  I refuse to accept the blame for 
poor documentation.

And even if you aren't, perhaps you'll keep it to yourself... or maybe 
call your mom and get a hug.

First question: why doesn't the "edit" button on that page work?
There is a wrong-word I wanted to fix, but couldn't.  Clicking on
"edit" sent me to the home page.  Seems anti-wiki and thus, in the
context, not least-astonishing.  Locked wikis suck. ;-)

It's like you're typing "help", except the program knows what you need 
before you even get to the second letter.

Typing help (or really, h) would have gotten you to a nice menu with a
bunch of help on it. The second line of which says " q  :q  Q  :Q  ZZ
Exit." In the meantime, you may want to invest in a free online command
line tutorial, or a book such as "A Practical Guide to Linux Commands,
Editors, and Shell Programming" by Mark Sobell, either of which would
probably introduce the pager, and in general how to use the command line.
You will find that often
the command line is required for some operations, and often a lot better
at doing them (wysiwyg editing aside) than a gui counterpart. On my own
system the xserver exists to give me a pretty background while a terminal
window is open. One window, because I like GNU screen.

You may have better luck in the future with using aptitude, as it is a lot
better at getting deep dependancies that apt-get misses. I believe it is
the recommended way of doing a dist-upgrade (though recommended by who, I
don't know). Aptitude has a weird little interface if you just run the
command, but I believe you can
type the same commands as when you run apt-get as well (so, in this case,
aptitude dist-upgrade). I haven't used Debian in a long time so I can't
actually check.

Do we have any information on the last update of that page?

I ask because it states "Still, other factors could be targeted and addressed to
promote the further adoption of Eclipse on Linux. Such factors might include:
Facilitation of Eclipse distribution via Linux package management methods (RPM,
Deb)".  The page then goes on to give an overview of packages and package
management in the Linux world.

Yet Eclipse in on my newly (Friday 6/16) created FC5 box, put there by default
through RPMs when the "Development Tools(?)" option was selected during initial
install.

Message-ID: <BAY122-F80068F54FE723AB1F4F5484860@phx.gbl>

Hello Everybody,

I'm the new guy with all the elementary questions.

I was at the clinic this Sunday and after unsuccessfully trying to partition 
my hard drive, simply went home with a Knoppix Live CD.

(1)
Concerning getting my printer running...it is not recognizing it.  I have a 
LEXMARK Z715 and that doesn't seem to be one of my options, there are alot 
of other LEXMARK models to choose, though(and I have tried many of 
these)...Am I doing something wrong?

(2)
Also, I have NetZero (dial-up) right now.  Shouldn't I be able to access the 
Internet?  How do I do this?  I'm used to just throwing in a CD with a given 
program on it and everything goes fine....but with the Live CD in my drive 
(I only have one) that is not an option.

(3)
Finally, how would I go about partitioning my hard drive?  At the clinic I 
was being helped greatly, we first tried to partition using an Ubuntu disc 
(I don't know much more than this...) but we didn't want to wait until the 
sun went down, It was taking quite awhile.  Does this Knoppix Live CD have 
something on it like that Ubuntu one does that will enable me to do this?

Thanks,

   You need to set up the application called 'diald' ... or any of the
GUI-front-ended versions. It's been over six years since I had dial up
connections, so I just don't recall how to do it. But, a Google search for
'linux diald' returned these:

   You have several options; all should be run from the command line and in
single-user mode. If you can access the man pages for 'fdisk,' 'cfdisk,' or
'parted' you'll get the syntax to use them. From the Winduhs world ... it's
been far too long for me to remember the tool used.

   I do know that with the old Red Hat installation cds, and Slackware, too,
for that matter, the first thing you're offered is the ability to repartition
your hard drive. I've never worked with a GUI-based distribution such as
Ubuntu, and have booted Knoppix only a couple of times to rescue me from the
errors of my ways, but they may have boot images that will get you to a linux
command prompt where you could run fdisk or cfdisk. That may be intimidating,
but pressing 'h' gets you help, and as long as you don't write anything to
the partition table you can quit without harm.

   Before you do any of this, however, I strongly suggest that you decide how
you want to partition your disk. There are arguably as many opinions on the
"best" way to partition a hard drive as there are on the "best" distribution,
editor, or window/desktop manager. Take advice you trust until you learn
enough to know just what you want. Then, the next time you replace a hard
drive, partition it to your tastes.

HTH,

Rich

And it is built with gcj, not the Sun Java SDK.  I am interested what that 
does with other plug-ins such as EPIC.

Subject: [PLUG] KOrganizer 3.4.2 Month View Printing
Message-ID: <200606191140.40922.aaron@madebyai.com>

My mother is currently using KOrganizer 3.4.2 for her schedule management. She likes to print monthly calendars to take with her. She'd like to not print todos on a monthly calendar. In the print dialog, there is a disabled but checked checkbox labelled "Include todos that are due on the printed day(s)". I've tried to find any documentation about the option but the manual doesn't even mention it. I've tried toggling all the different options on all the print pages, and I've checked all the KOrganizer settings, none of them appear to be related to this problem.

Does anyone have any idea why the checkbox is disabled or how to go about enabling it?

But how does a new user know this? That is the job of the programmer. 
The programmer needs to be more user friendly for prime time.

Yes.  Knoppix has lots of tools.  The command line tools are powerful  
but somewhat cryptic.  A nice GUI tool is QTparted ( K > System >  
QTParted ) which allows you to add, remove, and format partitions.   
QTparted can also resize some partitions under in certain situations.

Ultimately, what are you trying to do?  Do you wish to install linux  
as a single-OS system, install as a dual boot, only run from the CD,  
something else?

If you're going to be your own sysadmin, you better acquire the knowledge to 
do it right. I agree that a lot of program output and error messages could be 
more helpful and friendlier. On the other hand, this is not some sort of wild 
new undocumented cutting-edge task- it is very well-documented. Wise persons 
study first. If reading howtos is too tedious, practice on a nothing-to-lose 
system, not your main PC. 

An operating system upgrade is not trivial. Only in the Linux world is this a 
routine task requiring just a little bit of knowledge to perform 
successfully. Pretty amazing piece of engineering, it is. Don't blame the 
devs for your lack of preparation.

If you're running KDE, the KPPP utility is great. wvdial is my fave 
command-line utility. Dialup is a pain to configure on any platform; windoze 
has not updated their dialup interface since win95.

QTPArted for a nice graphical tool. Should be on Knoppix. Look for GParted, 
which I think is better, but I don't know if Knoppix has it.

Huh?  What?  Correct me if any of the following is incorrect.

You went to the clinic to get help with your install.  You then go home and decide
to, effectively,  rip out that install and replace it with a different one.

Why did you not stay with Breezy for awhile?
Why not use the computer rather than doing yet another upgrade?

A quick check of recent posts shows that problems are not new to you.  Why try
taking huge steps rather than little ones.  Like use the install from the clinic. 
Like upgrade one, and only one, application at a time.  Like asking yourself "am I
really prepared to take this action?" and backing off when the answer is no.

These are serious questions.  I'm not trying to give you grief here.

Part of the adventure is accepting where it takes you.  If you can't accept the
destination then don't go on the trip or persevere until you get what you want.

   I discovered that upgrading Slackware to be much simpler and easier than
was upgrading Red Hat. It now takes about a half-hour per machine, and most
of that time it's running upgradepkg on everthing installed. Even the kernel
is upgraded for me; a reboot and there we are with a shiny new kernel.

   It is a tribute to the folks who built on 35 years of UNIX to make linux
what it is.

   Regarding preparation, there are so many books, on-line resources, and
other sources of information readily available there is no valid excuse to
not learn the basics.

    People need training and licenses before they can drive, fly an airplane,
or drive a boat (in most states). In most professions, basic preparation via
college degrees is also mandatory, and some (lawyering and engineering come
to mind) require continuing education to maintain one's license. So, why
should learning something about an inherently multi-taking, multi-user OS not
be expected by new users? If the answer is, "I don't want to make the
effort," then use what Microsoft offers and let them do your thinking.

Huh?  What?  Correct me if any of the following is incorrect.

You went to the clinic to get help with your install.  You then go home and decide
to, effectively,  rip out that install and replace it with a different one.

Why did you not stay with Breezy for awhile?
Why not use the computer rather than doing yet another upgrade?

A quick check of recent posts shows that problems are not new to you.  Why try
taking huge steps rather than little ones.  Like use the install from the clinic.
Like upgrade one, and only one, application at a time.  Like asking yourself "am I
really prepared to take this action?" and backing off when the answer is no.

These are serious questions.  I'm not trying to give you grief here.

Part of the adventure is accepting where it takes you.  If you can't accept the
destination then don't go on the trip or persevere until you get what you want.

   You may recall that last week I asked for help getting a video plugin --
any one -- to work in firefox, but despite the excellent help from Auke, that
was not to be. Well, just now I bumped into another issue that I had seen a
couple of times since upgrading to 1.5.x, but not before: printing only a
partial page.

   I tried to print my boarding pass for tomorrow's flight, but only the
graphic images printed, no text. I had seen other pages (from different web
sites) that turned out to be mostly empty when printed, but this was
important.

   As a test, I fired up opera-8.5.4 and loaded that same page. It printed
just fine to both the laser and inkjet printers.

   Has anyone else experienced this flakiness? It's annoying.

Wrong. I went to the Clinic to help others (and I did a bit of that).
And to get help to make a copy of my existing Breezy installation to an
external USB drive for safekeeping. Then I was going to do the upgrade
to Dapper at the Clinic, but the Upgrade utility announced it needed a
GB of files, and Free Geek was giving me about 50K/s bandwidth. It
calculated five hours, and it was already 4:00. So I left without
upgrading my Breezy to Dapper. Then I came home where I have good
bandwidth and did it here. That's when stuff blew up.

> Why did you not stay with Breezy for awhile?

Dapper has been out since June 1. The Ubuntu forums (which I read
regularly) listed a few problems, but almost everyone had no trouble at
all. And I did wait until after classes were over. This is summer
vacation time for me. I can afford now to have the computer
non-functional for a bit if necessary. Plus, before going to the Clinic
I had already made a new, fresh install of Dapper in an unused portion
of the drive, so I did have something to boot to. And push come to
shove, I have a Windows 2000 desktop.

> A quick check of recent posts shows that problems are not new to you.  

Of course. I am grasshopper. But there are no classes on learning Linux
available that I know of. So I have to ask questions. If my questions
and occasional cries of anguish annoy you, then put me in your kill
filter. I might add that no one in my entire life ever accused me of
not having an opinion or of keeping it to myself. Another reason for
you to ignore me.

You probably won't be happy to hear this, but I fixed almost all the
problems with my borked Breezy to Dapper upgrade. It took me several
hours, but there were enough tips and troubleshooting fixes posted on
the Ubuntu forums that I have got it booting to Dapper and almost
everything is working. What isn't working looks like stuff that I can
probably handle myself -- it didn't upgrade Firefox 1.07 to 1.5, for
example. 

So I'm still a Linux desktop user who knows little of the command line
and has no degree in computer science. I realize very well that there
are several on this list who think I should not be allowed to run
Linux. I have literally been told (off-list) to go back to Windows and
stay there. But that ain't gonna happen. I'm going to use Linux and I'm
going to learn it one way or another. That means I'm going to develop
some scar tissue along the way, but I'm not afraid of that. If it
doesn't kill me it'll make me stronger.

Now it's time to kill this thread.

John,

Good for you! I personally am glad that you have the fortitude to stick 
it out and over come the uncomfortables of Linux. I hope that you are 
happy with Dapper. I had a heck of a time to get it to install correctly 
on my cruddy little laptop and then it didn't want to come up ... x 
wasn't working. I did the whole dist-upgrade thing too. It sucked. So 
then I said 'Forget it.' and went back to Debian. I am completely 
satisfied with it... but thinking about trying out some slackware or 
possible freebsd, just because I can....

As for a class.... I think all of the colleges have a "Linux 101"... but 
they tend to be for the CS students only.... you may want to try PSU's 
CS Department... someone up there has to know somewhere you can get into 
a class.

BTW, Congrats to all those who just graduated!

I have long had a problem printing from Firefox 1.07 to my Laserjet.
All I get is a page telling me the Laserjet is PostScript version
something-or-another and it needs an updated one that is
something-or-another+1. (Can't remember the version number.) The page
gives me a bunch of instructions for changing the Firefox print line so
it will use Ghostscript, but I could never get that to work. Everything
else always printed fine (well, not perfectly, lots of missing
features, but at least stuff printed).

After I installed Dapper, which installed a new version of Cups, the
problem with Firefox 1.07 continued. But when I upgraded to Firefox
1.5, the problem disappeared. So it appears the problem is definitely
in Firefox.

I haven't had a chance to try it out but I've been told by multiple people
who use it that the D50 is wonderful and is actually better then the Canon.
You can pick up the Rebel XT for under 1K now at the local compuhut. I'm a
Canon fan so when I decide to dive into the SLR market I'm going to go that
route unless someone tells me the Nikon is _so_ much better.

A couple of years ago I went through the same process and ended up with 
a Canon digital Rebel. A friend recommended the Nikon, but only because 
he had a bunch of Nikon lenses. My wife has a film Rebel and a couple of 
lenses, so I opted for the Canon for the same reason he went with the 
Nikon. I've been satisfied. I had been using some point and shoot 
digitals, but missed the TTL viewing feature of an SLR.

To bring this back to Linux, at least a little bit, Digikam recognized 
the Rebel the first time I plugged it in to the USB port!

I bought mine used via Craig's list, so I can't speak to the stores issue.

I like ProPhoto supply on 19th and ..... the M street in NW Portland
(one block north of lovejoy).

I've been using a D70 for about 2 years and love it -- I wish it had a
splitprism or was a rangefinder, but thoes options aren't around in
the digital camera world yet.

The kit lens on the D70 is really nice, although it does vignette a
bit around the edges at the extreme focal lengths.  Batter life is
fantastic -- I've probably shot over 1k pictures on one charge +
downloaded them straight from the camera.  The D50 probably fixes
this, but despite advertising USB 2.0, the D70 only downloads at USB
1.1 speeds (easily fixed with a pcmcia cf card reader.)  I'm also much
happier with the controll layout on the nikons than the cannon's I've
used, that may just be me though -- I'm left-eyed, but right-handed,
so my cheek often gets in the way of controlls that may be easily
accessed by others.

I'm not a serious enough photographer to talk about color and noise,
so I'll stop here :)

dpreview.com is a great place to look, if you haven't read their reviews yet.

Subject: [PLUG] Mean dependency killer needed, Clark Kent size
Message-ID: <20060619180744.db770f4b.johnxj@comcast.net>

Well, I HAD it running. My upgrade of Breezy to Dapper, I mean. Only a
couple problems remained, and I thought they would be simple.

The first one I tackled was that OO.o would not launch and its icon
that I keep in the gnome panel turned into a ? inside a yellow
triangle. I decided to do a reinstall, so I opened Synaptic. But
Synaptic announced I had broken packages. So I used the Broken Package
filter to find them and reinstall them. That solved the problem for all
but ia32-libs. 

Now, as far as I can tell, the whole damn Ubuntu operating system needs
ia32-libs. OK, that may be a bit of an exaggeration. But it seems like
everything uses it, and everything seems to depend on it. At least that
seems to be true for OO.o, the nvidia-glx driver, streamtuner, and
several other libraries. Synaptic won't touch it. 

Ubuntu Dapper-64 forums are full of posts from users having problems
with it. One person said he managed to fix it by going to a command
line, removing nvidia-glx, removing ia32-libs, then reinstalling
nvidia-glx. That didn't work for me. I successfully removed nvidia-glx,
but when I tried to remove ia32-libs, all I got was an error message. 

Another person said he had success when he renamed /etc/bin/ldd
to /etc/bin/ldd.old (I may have misremembered the folders). Didn't work
for me.

I've tried:

sudo apt-get -f remove -- which said it could not remove ia32-libs
sudo dpkg --configure -a -- which said it couldn't deal with ia32-libs
sudo apt-get dist-update -- which said it finished except there was an
unmet dependency with ia32-libs sudo apt-get remove ia32-libs -- which
said it couldn't remove ia32-libs

And finally, the command that is supposed to make the dead walk again:

sudo apt-get remove ia32-libs --purge

Which still won't touch it.

And after all the messing around, now it won't boot to the GUI any more.

Any suggestions?

The D50 is particularly favored by professionals using photoshop, as 
well as the D70 (preferred)... The D50 (and D70) are nice models because 
you can purchase them with just a standard lens, and then upgrade to 
what ever lens you like.... you will get great pictures either way.... 
If you are using PShop with it, be sure to download and use Adobes 
"camera raw and dng converter" do not use the camera's version.... I use 
to support CS and CS2....
You can get the file from here (on win)
http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=3355
or you can get it here for mac
http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=3354

Of course if you are using it on a Linux box...
I am not sure if Linux supports camera raw images, so you will have to 
look into some documentation. Your best bet will probably be the 
Gimp2.2... which is absolutely one of the best imaging apps around!

This is to the gentleman at the Clinic who was trying to get OO.o on

Dapper installation trying things out. As I said at the Clinic, I had
tried mdbtools before under Breezy with OO.o 1.93.129 and I couldn't
get it to work. Well, now it does.

This is a default installation of Ubuntu Dapper-64 from DVD, which also
installed OO.o 2.02. Using Synaptic (Debian equivalent of YaST), I
installed mdbtools. (I also installed mdbtools-gmdb, which is supposed
to be a file viewer for Access databases, but it crashes on trying to
open a file, so evidently it is allergic to Debian or something.) 

Once I had mdbtools installed I opened a new, blank OO.o Base file and
told it to open the Access database file. It did so and showed the
table. I was able to see the data. (It's an Old English to Modern
English dictionary of 28,000 words.) However, I couldn't edit the data.
Nothing would allow me to touch it. Like Mom used to say, look, don't
touch.

Then I opened a Writer document and hit F4. That opens up a window
where you can look at whatever databases you have "registered." (Base
will register it for you automatically.) I saw the database listed,
clicked down to see the table, and the data immediately displayed at
the top of the screen, sort of like a table in a spreadsheet. I
selected a dozen records or so and dragged them down to the writer
document. That opened up a dialog box where I could choose what fields
I wanted to import, and so on. And when I clicked on OK it imported
them right into the Writer document. 

Now, I still couldn't touch the data above the Writer document where it
was displayed from the database. No editing the .mdb file. But once it
was read into the Writer document I was free to do with it anything I
wanted. In other words, you could use this to get the table into a
table within Writer, convert the table to text (specifying commas or
tabs or something for delimiters), and then save the document as a CSV
data file. And once you had that you could import it into Base and have
a real open source database.

I don't know if you need Ubuntu to do this. It seems to me that all you
need is OO.o 2.02 or better and mdbtools, so no need to change your
Suse installation.

Has apt-get been fixed to handle multi-architecture installs? If not, that 
is the problem.  (My understanding is that apt does not handle it at all.)
I don't use apt based distributions, so I am not a good person to ask.  I 
use Fedora Core 5 and it works fine for me...

Message-ID: <20060620053826.GP14673@merlot.com>

A friend of mine is running a web hosting system, and lately logwatch

This is great, except that the portscan was initiated by his server.

Logwatch says that from his main IP, it saw these attempts:

Any ideas on how I can find out which user is doing this? Users don't
have shell access, but can upload scripts to their web sites. The logs
show these attempts to connect to various ports throughout the day. They
are non-sequential. I have grepped the logs for obvious patterns (e.g.
apache logs for URLs with port= parameters), but have found nothing so
far.

I've considered trying to match up the datestamps of the iptables hits
against apache logs, but haven't gotten to that yet.

Any tips? 

Thanks!

So applications are only things that have a GUI? Or could it be that 
your definition of application is a little narrow?

A terminal is an application. You can run other applications in the 
terminal, if you run the terminal in the right mode. It's also possible 
to run the terminal in such a mode that it won't run but one application 
in it, and that it exits when you close that application. That doesn't 
make the terminal any less of an application.

Were we born with that information? No. We learned it by reading manuals 
or somehow coming across the information just as you have. I'm sure you 
are not the first person to do this, and you certainly won't be the last.

How is the programmer to know what pager program you are using? What if 
you are using a pager that uses [left-ctrl][right-shift][F1] to quit, 
and they put in that you press [ctrl]z to quit?

There are many pagers, and not all of them use ctrl-z to exit.

No, they assume you have the knowledge to find out how to use your system.

No one is born with this knowledge. People learn it... or not.

The programmer has no idea what pager you may be using. Telling you how 
to exit from the man page (btw, man is another application... type 'man 
man' at a prompt...) doesn't have anything to do with 99.9% of the other 
applications on your computer.

So the source IP is the server and there where probes to all the ports you 
mentioned.  

Some questions I can think of:

Is there anything in the logs to indicate the source port.

How many interfaces are there on the host?

Which interfaces did iptables block?

It might be helpful to actually see some of the log entries.

Try subbing to the debian-project mailing list, aka Ego-Trips-R-Us.  It 
gets brutal.  The poster is mild by comparison ... really, it should be 
one of Weegee's crime scene photos, preferably one with dead bodies.

Apparently, there was an "incident" at the recent Debconf in Mexico that 
resulted in one of the devs being asked to leave -- not just the 
conference, but also the project.

Ah, community!

Call me an a$$h*le, but if your dropping big bucks on a TV, computer, ipod, or anything else for that matter, you best know how to use it.  That would really be "comcastic" ;-)

I spent much of the past several days reconsidering, retrying, 
retooling, and reinstalling ... not just Dapper, but Debian (Sarge & 
Etch), Ubuntu Breezy, Arch, Gentoo, and FreeBSD.  I hope you got Dapper 
working, but I gave up on it.  I think I'm officially writing off Ubuntu 
for the foreseeable future (which is to say, at least until the next 
release).  I did eventually get it installed, and mostly configured, but 
only after considerable headaches.  The Dapper installer didn't work for 
me unless I installed by accepting the default partitions (/ and /swap 
partitions only) on the whole disk or on unpartitioned free space.  Any 
attempt to partition my discs the way I wanted resulted in the installer 
hanging.  I couldn't even create a separate home partition.  Ditto any 
attempt to install on existing partitions.  Finally, I gave up, 
installed Breezy, and upgraded from there.  That worked.  But after all 
that, I decided it's not really what I want.

So after playing around with some other distros (and one other OS), and 
a visit to Powell's Technical, I decided to go back to Debian (Etch, 
this time) and try to learn the hard way.  :-)  That is, I got a couple 
of books:  Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 Bible and The Debian System.  I think 
part of my problem with using Linux has been my piecemeal approach to 
fixing problems as they come up, rather than trying really to understand 
what's going on -- understanding not just why something goes wrong, but 
also why it goes right.  In other words, I don't really get how it all 
works.  Playing around with Arch Linux and, to a lesser extent, Gentoo, 
helped give me some perspective on how other distros do things.  It's 
useful and interesting for helping to separate out what things are 
common to "Linux" from what's specific to Debian (and Debian-based) 
distros.  But I think, for me, the best way to learn is to stop the 
dabbling for awhile, dive into one distro headfirst, and try to learn 
what happens from the moment the machine gets turned on until it gets 
shutdown.  Debian is one of the better documented and best-supported 
distros around, despite not having a corporate backer, so I'm going with 
that.  If there'd been two relatively recent several-hundred-page books 
each documenting Arch, Gentoo, or Slackware, I might've gone with one of 
those, as I like the simplicity of their layouts in comparison to 
Debian.  (Ubuntu, on the other hand, is just too complex -- like Debian, 
but harder.)  If there exists somewhere a course like "Linux for 
Non-Programmers," I'll sign-up.

Although, having said that, I also picked up Mark Sobel's "A Practical 
Guide to Linux Commands, Editors, and Shell Programming."  I got it more 
for the the commands and editors parts than the shell programming part, 
but maybe I'll learn something.

I might be out-of-date on this, but doesn't NetZero (and Juno, which has 
the same parent company) use a proprietary dialer?  Does anyone know 
that any of the standard dial-up tools included on Ubuntu or Knoppix 
live CDs will work with NetZero?

AFAIK, NetZero officially supports Lindows, which probably means it can 
be made to work with other Debian-based distros (like Ubuntu or Mepis), 
but you'd have to install the right software and I'm not sure that would 
be included on a live CD, except maybe a Lindows live CD.  (Does Lindows 
have a live CD?)  NetZero has a .deb you can download and install on 
Lindows.

I know it used to be that NetZero and Juno were incompatible with 
Linux.  It would be nice to know if that's changed.

Sorry to hear about your headaches with Dapper. I am still having
problems with the upgrade for my old Breezy-64 installation. Got some
thorny dependency issues that refuse to get fixed -- specifically
involving ia32-libs. It refuses to be removed, reinstalled, purged or
anything. Evidently the video depends on it, among other things, so
until I figure out a solution it won't boot to the GUI. I tried editing
xorg.conf to switch from "nvidia" to "nv," but it still won't start X.

Meantime, I have the other Dapper-64 installation running just great --
the one I installed into an unused portion of the drive. I've spent
several hours in it so far and I love it. I am confident that I will be
able to do everything with Dapper-64 without needing chroot. I've got
Adobe Reader running, Firefox 1.5 with Flash and RealPlayer (still
working on the Adobe Reader plugin, but others have it working), and
all the rest of the tools I need. Most of the time I've spent in it was
spent reading Ubuntu forums to find out clever tricks for getting stuff
to install -- like using "force architecture" to get Adobe Reader 7.01 to
install. The forums are one of Ubuntu's strong points.

I have a hard time learning abstract stuff from books. I need hands-on
to learn something. (In Education we'd say I was kinesthetic.) There
are no two humans on the planet who learn the same way. Worse, we
humans have a terrible tendency to assume everyone is the same as us,
hence everyone assumes that they way they learned how to use computers
is what everyone else ought to do. And classes are good for real
beginners, but there are also problems with timing and relevancy.
Nevertheless, those books you mentioned do sound good. A command line
reference would be especially useful. The only problem is that every
one I have seen (including websites) is arranged alphabetically by
command. That isn't very helpful if you need to know how to fix
ia32-libs. Does Sobel's book have at least a good index?

Having tried Red Hat, Ubuntu, Arch, Gentoo, et al (9 years of Linux), I
finally settled on Arch.  Have tried others since I started using Arch, but
keep coming back.  (Writing this on Toshiba Satellite over its built-in
802.11g WiFI -- using all native Arch binaries.)  Am also biased toward KDE
(makes Suspend-to-RAM just work, for example).  Why do I pick these?  I like
to enjoy my PC experience.  Heh.

For example, I don't like having to install a distro and then run around
finding mp3 and nVidia binaries from other sources -- and hoping the other
sources have packages that were put together with the same care as the folks
in the dristro.

The Arch forums are close to a "Linux for Non-Programmers".  The Wiki is
also good -- though it tends to be a bit stale, at times.  Have found the
Gentoo Wiki more complete / up-to-date and often applies closely to the Arch
environment.

Although, having said that, I also picked up Mark Sobel's "A Practical

That's a very good start.

Just my two cents, of course.

Here's a typical iptables log entry:

  Jun 20 07:15:38 host20 kernel: ** OUT_TCP DROP ** IN= OUT=eth0
  SRC=206.180.226.20 DST=203.206.95.1 LEN=44 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=64
  ID=0 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=80 DPT=64 WINDOW=5840 RES=0x00 ACK SYN URGP=0

Yes, the source port is logged, 80 in the line above.

> How many interfaces are there on the host?

18, including the loopback, 2 physical.

> Which interfaces did iptables block?

The physical interface that handles all outgoing traffic; the other
interface is part of a back net.

OK? I'm starting to think that these are intentionally misformed packets
from the outside, refleected off the server to some 'target' host. 

Anything backed by actual experience will be more useful than my raw
opinion.

Thanks!

Subject: [PLUG] Three laptop hangs in 24 hours
Message-ID: <20060620155026.GA3982@gate.kl-ic.com>


Normally, my linux laptop goes weeks between reboots (thought it
is often closed and suspended).  In the last 24 hours, it has
gone into system freeze three times (once while trying to use
audacity, once while coming out of suspend, and once while web
surfing this morning).  No evidence left in /var/log/*

I am running really old Redhat 9 with an updated 2.4 kernel (why?
long story).

I suspect the problem is related to enabling the serial port in
the BIOS (the only major change in the last couple of days).   
However, I was hearing passing comments about lockups from Eric
Wilhelm at Advanced Topics last night, and I believe Michael
Rassmussen was having problems recently.  So before I assume that
the problem is the serial port, I am wondering if there are others
who have been seeing a sudden increase in hangs.  If this is 
general, it might indicate some subtle new security problem.

Q1) Has anyone else seen a recent unexplained increase in system hangs?

It would also be handy to load a tool that can monitor the laptop
and save more log information about the system freeze.  Even if
turning off the serial port fixes this, I want to know *why*.

Q2) Can anyone suggest a better tool to monitor system freezes?

Subject: [PLUG] off-topic: digital camera recommendation

I've never used a D50. I used a D70 the other day for about 5 minutes,
and I didn't really see anything wrong with it.

I have been very pleased with my Canon Digital Rebel XT (aka 350D). It's
very quick, light, and easy to operate. The kit lens is disappointing,
but it's my understanding that pretty much all kit lenses are.

I recommend you take a close look at the reviews on this site:

http://dpreview.com/

They do very good reviews of a lot of cameras, and even if they don't
have a review, they will have a comprehensive list of specs. The Nikon
D50 review is here:

http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikond50/

You will be able to get a good camera for under $1000, but if you want
to enjoy your new toy to its fullest, you'll be investing in some good
lenses, which can put you about as far over $1000 as you want.

I bought my Rebel XT from a local store in the Beaverton area called
Advance Camera. They're good and very knowledgeable, but they're a small
store so you may have to buy the camera before you can lay your hands on
it.

That is a very important point. Make sure you handle the camera before
you buy it -- it really matters how well it fits in your hands.

Google is not being helpful - mostly because all the links point to a
non-functioning site.

Freshly installed Fedora Core 5 system with default Firefox install.  I hit a page
that required flash so I clicked through to do the install from the Firefox
plug-in page.  It installed and reported as successful.

No flash plugin is reported in about:plugins, flash segments of pages don't display.

download the Flash plugin installer and run it. Note the files are where I'd
expect them to be.

No flash plugin is reported in about:plugins, flash segments of pages don't display.

No errors are reported in any of the installation methods.  Run them as self
(which installs to ~/.mozilla) or root (which installs to /usr/local/...)

What am I missing that is preventing flash use on this system?

Go read the unofficial Fedora FAQ at fedorafaq.org to learn all about
the stuff that RedHat isn't willing to or can't redistribute with
Fedora.  mp3s, Flash, Acroread, Java (from Sun), libcss, etc.  You'll
probably end up wanting the rpm.livna.org repository added to yum.

  I've been using Stanton Finley's installation notes to install FC5
multimedia. I especially like the True Type fonts he has you load.

Fedora Core 5 Linux Installation Notes
http://stanton-finley.net/fedora_core_5_installation_notes.html

 It works OK, except I've been having troubles with X crashing when I
play WVM files in Firefox.  I haven't had time to troubleshoot the
problem.  It may be a simple problem to fix.

Somebody has helpfully packaged the flash plugin as an RPM.  You can
setup the yum repository by following the instructions at
http://macromedia.mplug.org/ but it is easier to just install the rpm
directly.

rpm -Uvh http://macromedia.mplug.org/rpm/RPMS.macromedia/flash-plugin-7.0.63-1.i386.rpm

If you are still having problems, check the mozilla and firefox plugin
directories to make sure the symlinks are correct.

There are all kinds of docs for snort-inline, it's --enable-flexresp that's 
I'm having trouble with. Though searching on 'flexresp' gets some hits.

You are right, I got most of my information using the snort manual for
how to configure and change the rules.  It is pretty straightforward.
You will need to have a specific version of libnids from packetfactory
and when you attempt to build using

./configure --enable-flexresp

it will tell you exactly what version you need and where to get it.

the rules come down to react and resp depending upon which side of the
connection you want to drop.  Sorry I cannot be of much more help in
terms of documentation.  If want an already configured version that
runs from a bootable cd, check out network security toolkit at -
http://www.networksecuritytoolkit.org.

I've also used his suggestions for Java with Ubuntu.

OK, that helps, I didn't know that react and resp were Snort keywords. Until 
now I've relied on Oinkmaster to download new rules and not tinkered much 
with the guts. Woohoo, progress!

Straight out of the snort manual:


3.7.3 resp

The resp keyword is used attempt to close sessions when an alert is
triggered. In Snort, this is called flexible response.

Flexible Response supports the following mechanisms for attempting to
close sessions:

Option	Description	
rst_snd	Send TCP-RST packets to the sending socket	
rst_rcv	Send TCP-RST packets to the receiving socket	
rst_all	Send TCP_RST packets in both directions	
icmp_net	Send a ICMP_NET_UNREACH to the sender	
icmp_host	Send a ICMP_HOST_UNREACH to the sender	
icmp_port	Send a ICMP_PORT_UNREACH to the sender	
icmp_all	Send all above ICMP packets to the sender	

These options can be combined to send multiple responses to the target host.

3.7.3.1 Format


resp: <resp_mechanism>[,<resp_mechanism>[,<resp_mechanism>]];

3.7.3.2 Warnings

This functionality is not built in by default. Use the -
-enable-flexresp flag to configure when building Snort to enable this
functionality.

Be very careful when using Flexible Response. It is quite easy to get
Snort into an infinite loop by defining a rule such as:


alert tcp any any -> any any (resp:rst_all;)

It is easy to be fooled into interfering with normal network traffic as well.

3.7.3.3 Example

The following example attempts to reset any TCP connection to port 1524.

alert tcp any any -> any 1524 (flags:S; resp:rst_all;)

3.7.4 react

This keyword implements an ability for users to react to traffic that
matches a Snort rule. The basic reaction is blocking interesting sites
users want to access: New York Times, slashdot, or something really
important - napster and porn sites. The React code allows Snort to
actively close offending connections and/or send a visible notice to
the browser. The notice may include your own comment. The following
arguments (basic modifiers) are valid for this option:

block - close connection and send the visible notice
warn - send the visible, warning notice (will be available soon)
The basic argument may be combined with the following arguments
(additional modifiers):

msg - include the msg option text into the blocking visible notice
proxy: port_nr - use the proxy port to send the visible notice (will
be available soon)
Multiple additional arguments are separated by a comma. The react
keyword should be placed as the last one in the option list.

3.7.4.1 Format


react: <react_basic_modifier[, react_additional_modifier]>;
	
Figure 3.22: React Usage Example

3.7.4.2 Warnings

React functionality is not built in by default. This code is currently
bundled under Flexible Response, so enabling Flexible Response
(-enable-flexresp) will also enable React.

Be very careful when using react. Causing a network traffic generation
loop is very easy to do with this functionality.

As it turns out the site, macromedia.mplug.org, was down over the weekend.
Today it's back up and the install went well.

Thanks to the responders.  Their RTFM replies have stocked me up with some
great Fedora information sites that will be helpful in the future.

Arch is awesome in oh so many ways but one, IMO.  What I like about Arch 
is its adherence to the "KISS" principle.  Just doing an installation of 
Arch is a great learning experience for any newbie because in one simple 
document, the whole configuration of your entire base system (excluding 
X) is laid out:

http://www.archlinux.org/docs/en/guide/install/arch-install-guide.html#config

It wasn't until I used Arch that I finally began to understand a little 
bit of how Linux is put together, what types of devices and settings are 
configured from which files and run by which scripts.  Debian 
complicates things considerably, at least in comparison to Arch.

The problem is that Arch is too bleeding edge for me, at least right 
now.  I thought about trying to run a static version of Arch, by just 
sticking to the release.  But that's not really how Arch is designed to 
work, and it probably wouldn't be very satisfying.  It might if Arch had 
a more predictable, regular release schedule, but it doesn't.  So you're 
left with the constant updates, and the risk that some buggy 
something-or-other will prevent such-and-such, which worked fine 
yesterday, from working today.  Often, the fix is relatively simple, 
like symlinking some library to something, but it gets wearying.  I 
think Arch needs to work a little more on quality control.  This 
wouldn't be a problem if I was knowledgeable enough to do my own QC -- 
i.e., if I could look at an Arch package file and figure out why it 
won't install or why the program refuses to run -- but I'm not there 
yet.  And what I *really* don't understand about Arch is why the devs 
insist on using the newest kernel at the earliest possible moment.  The 
Linux kernel development process itself is somewhat problematic -- I 
read that the kernel devs are considering putting a freeze on new 
features to concentrate on bug squashing for awhile, and I really hope 
they do that.  Put together kernel bugs, software bugs, occasional 
oopsies in Arch packages, and the winds of fortune, and you end up with 
a system where something or other isn't working right, on a fairly 
regular basis.  At least, that's been my experience.  Of course, the 
software bugs will bite you wherever you're using the software in 
question, but at least distros that aren't as cutting edge don't have 
quite so much else going on.

Well I don't think that's so much a problem with Debian or Ubuntu, since 
ultimately they're all put together by the same people, just some of 
them acting in an unofficial capacity.  With Debian, I think all the 
nVidia stuff is available from non-free (but I don't use the proprietary 
drivers, so I might be wrong), and all the multimedia stuff comes from 
debian-multimedia.org, which is maintained by Debian devs.  Even 
Backports.org is maintained by the folks in the distro -- it's just not 
an "official" repository.  When you're talking about community-based 
distros like Arch and Debian, I don't see the big difference between 
what's official and what isn't.

Yeah, the Arch forums tend to be a very good resource, and the Gentoo 
Wiki is amazing -- really, it's a model for what distro Wiki's should 
be.  Ubuntu's is probably the next best, of those I've looked at.

I am using SuSE 10.0. I installed the all-in-one HP
Officejet 4215 locally without any issues.

I would like another computer using Windows XP to be
able to use it. In Windows, I located the Officejet as
a remote printer, but I was prompted for a driver and
could not find one. The Windows CD that comes with the
Officejet doesn't seem to have anything appropriate
either. Does anyone have insight into this problem?

You should be able to download a Windows driver from hp.com. Windows can't use 
the CUPS driver.

Have one system that is very old, compared to today's Arch (runs our
financial s/w so it can't go down for more than a day).  I waited for a
while to see if things were stable and then simply quit doing 'pacman -Suy'
-- almost a year ago.

All other PCs (including laptop) are updated daily.  For several months now,
haven't run into a single problem related to an update.  You're right,
though.  There was a time when Arch could be very frustrating because it was
so bleeding edge.

You do realize that the machine is likely running with several gaping 
security holes if it isn't being updated regularly... right?

Just make sure it's safe from the outside world (or the inside one, 
depending on who is inside).

Message-ID: <200606202355.16229.ewilhelm@cpan.org>

Perl users / web developers / others with interest in weirdness.

Note the short notice -- we're winging it.

Audrey Tang is the amazingly prolific hacker with a really long list of 
CPAN modules under her belt, an implementation of Perl6 in Haskell, and 
has recently been working on the nifty new Perl web framework "Jifty".

The talk will mostly be about Jifty, including its mind-bendingly nifty 
schema declaration syntax, ORM, application-level continuations, and 
other features that put Rails to shame.

The talk will be *this Saturday night* at Free Geek, followed by a 
migration to the Lucky Lab for beverages.

Mongers,

As I mentioned at this week's meeting, Audrey Tang (formerly Autrijus)
of Pugs fame will be in Portland this month.

She has agreed to speak to us on the 24th at 7pm.

This will be at free-geek

From Audrey:  "I can talk about Pugs/Perl6 _and_ Jifty, but please ask
the mongers to pick a priority in case that I got too exhausted to do
both
talks. :-)"

Which topic would you all like to hear first?  Vote via mail (on or
off list.)  Don't be shy.

So, there's the announcement.  Tell your friends.  Tell your boss.
Cancel your anniversary dinner, etc.

It's probably an age thing, but I have more of a problem learning from 
documentation on-line or included with the operating system than 
learning from a book.  Not that man pages and explanatory websites 
aren't invaluable and indispensable, but more as references than as a 
learning tool.  How-to's, tutorials, man pages, and the like are great 
for problem solving and even for learning discrete chunks of how 
something works.  I can't put it all together from those, though, and 
that's where I find books to be invaluable.  Plus, there's just 
something about the "solidity" of a printed book that I find more 
comforting than even an equivalent document on-line.  For example, I 
tried going through the Rute User's Tutorial on-line (and locally -- it 
can be installed with aptitude), and I had a much harder time than I 
would've if I had the same information in a book sitting open in front 
of the machine.  (It's an excellent document, nonetheless.)   I'm just 
not as attuned to learning from a screen -- gleaning information, sure, 
but not really *learning.*  Maybe all those hours in my formative years 
spent watching "Gilligan's Island" on a screen have permanently colored 
what I think screens really are for.

I haven't spent enough time with the books yet really to judge them, but 
I'm finding "The Debian System" to be more valuable than "The Debian 
GNU/Linux Bible."  I think anyone at any level could benefit from it 
(obviously, only if you're interested in Debian or one of its 
derivatives) because it delves into the concepts behind the structure.  
It's an attempt to explain why Debian is organized the way it is and the 
implications of that organization on techniques for managing the 
system.  Along the way, of course, there's a lot of how-to type 
information, but that isn't the thrust of the book.  The "Bible" is more 
task-oriented (chapters on graphics and sound, on Gnome and KDE, on web 
servers, intranet mail servers, databases, etc.), but as such has 
already dated some and doesn't really delve deeply enough into a lot of 
its subjects.  I mean, if you want to learn MySQL or PostGreSQL, you're 
not going to get very far with a few pages each in a book ostensibly 
about Debian; and if you don't care about them (or OpenLDAP or numerous 
other topics), then they take up space that could be given over to a 
more discursive examination of what makes Debian tick.  I'm finding it 
less helpful than "The Linux Cookbook" as a more task-oriented reference 
or as an "idea" book.  There is plenty of information, and it 
complements "The Debian System," but almost any given person is going to 
find substantial portions of it either irrelevant or incomplete.

Sobel's book looks pretty great, and yes, it does have a solid index.  
It also has an extensive (over 200 pages) command reference that's 
cross-referenced by type ("network utilities," "utilities that display 
and alter status," "utilities that display and manipulate files," etc.), 
a few useful appendices (one section even covers Bittorrent), and a good 
glossary.  It actually starts off with some really basic stuff, things 
even I have learned (not just "things I've used at one point or 
another," but things I already know).  But that's a good thing, I think 
-- it's useful to review, and to have it all in one place.  It goes into 
vim and emacs pretty extensively -- granted, you can buy entire books on 
either, but there seems to be enough here to get more than the 
fundamentals and probably as much as most people would need for general 
use.  The book goes places I probably won't in some later sections, 
dealing with programming in C and related topics.  But there are some 
things covered in the course of all that that I've either been curious 
about or would be useful to have a rudimentary knowledge of, like 
working with gawk and sed, or the differences between bash and tcsh.  
There are exercises throughout.  All in all, almost anyone who 
anticipates ever launching a terminal could get quite a bit from it.

First, an intruder would have to get through two firewalls, plus the
firewall (iptables) on the box itself.  If so, then being up-to-date would
seem to be an irrelevant issue, as the other boxes (firewalls) are up to
date ;-)

I think one has to weigh stability (i.e. not patching to the bleeding edge)
with security, some times, and try to choose a level that makes sense.

So, as you stated, making sure it's safe works in this case, me thinks.

Try plugging the printer into the XP machine, installing the drivers
from the CD, then move the printer back to the SUSE machine.  You will
need to change the port that the XP machine prints to, most likely a TCP
port will work just fine.

Good Luck,

How did you look for it?  Did you just put the CD and hope Windows would 
get what it needed?  Sometimes this works, but sometimes it doesn't. 
You may need to navigate the CD to the proper folder.  Or just get the 
latest driver from the HP website.  Of look, a link! ;)

ftp://ftp.hp.com/pub/softlib/software4/COL5207/mp-17885-4/gc_ep_w01_enu.exe

Extract that somewhere and this will install the driver.  I am not 
familiar with setting things up the way you have.  If the two computers 
are close together maybe it would be easier to set the printer up on the 
XP box and share to the Linux box.  Or better yet get a USB print server 
and make it a network printer.

Subject: [PLUG] Plone Training: Build by Design: Rapid Product Dev for Plone
 using ArchGenXML
Message-ID: <4497031D.3060104@7technw.com>

7 Tech Northwest is proud to announce our first ArchGenXML training 
scheduled for 25-27 July in Vancouver, WA.

http://www.7technw.com/training/t-agx01-f

Many of you have been interested in ArchGenXML for some time, some may 
already have been experimenting with it, others may have not even heard 
of this great RAD tool for Plone. Some of you may have seen a demo of it 
first hand at some event, read something about it online, or seen one of 
a few pod-casts that show off this amazing technology as the 
demonstrator cranks out a new Plone product almost faster than you can 
follow.

To put it simply, ArchGenXML allows you to create fully functional, 
ready to install, Plone products from a drawing. In this apparent magic 
act, the drawing is a UML diagram and the resulting product is based on 
Archetypes.

This technology is not actually magical, does allow a developer to 
quickly visualize an idea and move it into a working product very 
quickly. This tool is the product of the hard work and dedication of 
many key developers in the Plone community. Every user has a different 
perspective on how it fits into their tool-set, and how deep down the 
rabbit hole they tend to plunge, but all will agree that it is a key 
feather in the Plone development communities hat.

We will be spending most of three days delving into all aspects of this 
tool. Every student will leave with both first hand knowledge of the 
capabilities of this tool, and personal experience in it's use. We will 
also explore other related tools including the future replacement of 
ArchGenXML, Genesis.

We will start with a foundation that will allow you to best capitalize 
on the benefits ArchGenXML has to offer, starting with a quick reminder 
of what it means to be a product in Plone, then an overview of 
Archetypes, and then into an introduction to UML. This foundation will 
give us a solid base from which to build our understanding of ArchGenXML.

We will be offering this training again in the future as demand dictates 
as well as other Plone trainings. See our website for details.

They could be attempting to bounce packets of your machine to probe a remote host.  However, all the  blocked packets are outound with SYN/ACK set.  It's possible that 203.206.95.1 is an invalid host and someone was trying a SYN attack.

I did that, too. One thing I apparently missed was in
the last sentence, so more work is needed. (My wife
usually uses the Windows computer, and for now it's
still connected locally to another printer. I'll have
to wait until she's not here.)

When I used CUPS (1.1.23-21) to share the Officejet as
a networked Samba printer (that is, connected locally
to the Windows computer) I obtained this message:
"Tree connect failed." The share was something like

smb://mshome/christine/officejet

I have a USB print server, Netgear PS121, but it seems
to be compatible with only certain devices. Could this
be one of them?

Rogoway had an short article in a recent Oregonian about Compiere
moving to California, and it made Compiere sound like a well-known
local open source company.  This surprised me a bit because, well, I'd
never even heard of it before.

Later on in the article, he quotes Scott Kveton (recently leaving
OSUOSL for a startup) as saying: "For this thing to be relevant, we
have to commercialize it.  Otherwise it's just a novelty."  WTF??

You also realize that 70% to 90% of all security breaches are "inside 
jobs"... don't you?

Here's one story from last year: 
http://www.itweek.co.uk/vnunet/news/2127220/computer-hacking-inside-job

You are absolutely correct that one has to weigh the cost of whatever 
security plan is in place. Just don't expect that a firewall is the end 
all, be all of security.

Some questions to ponder... How would you know if the system were 
compromised? If it were, how would you know what "they" changed? How 
could you validate that they didn't change anything?

Message-ID: <449A6B0B.7070708@emediatedesigns.com>

Hello all,

I'm looking to build a linux box that will server one purpose.  It will 
just encode audio files.  I may encode video too but not right away.  I 
want this machine to be very small.  Thus a small case.  I'm looking for 
any pre-built or easy to build small case machines and hopefully local 
supplier that would be compatible with linux.  If all the features minus 
the sound and potentially video was built on the mother board that would 
be fine.  I think I would need just 2 expansion slots to deal with the 
possible additional cards. 

I have seen cases with pre-built system before about but not in a 
while.  really want a small box and was hoping to spend about $300.  I 
don't need a killer CPU for this or more then 1GB Ram (possible only 
512MB) and the HD can be as small as 40GB.  I can buy a full on 
mid-tower case for this price but want the machine to be small. 

suggestions?  Anyone buy a pre-built small case system that has worked 
with Linux - sound/video supported? 

I prefer to work with a local dealer but if that fails I would go 
elsewhere. 

Thanks and Happy Solstice to all.  I hope you enjoy the longest day as 
they are now only getting shorter. :-(

Hi Josh-
I would try www.enuinc.com for parts sourcing. They'll cover everything but
the small case, or Frye's in Wilsonville. You're essentially looking to
build a mini-itx box.

http://www.enuinc.com/cas-che-006.html There's a 69.00 mini-case

Mobo

http://castle.pricewatch.com/s/search.asp?s=mini+itx&Page=1&i=2&c=Motherboard&srt=t&view=&his=0&paging=1&mpi=2&mpc=Motherboards

so you're looking at maybe 170.00 for case and mobo with RAM, CPU and HD
you'll come close to your budget

HTH,
Drew

An older used laptop would do a fine job - audio encoding can be done
with quite a modest machine.  Check http://www.linux-laptop.net/ for
info on specific models.

If you must have new, and a desktop-like machine, then there are a
few mini-ITX machines around.  You will end up spending more like
$500, though, when you get done buying all the pieces.  I have one
Shuttle ST62K mini-ITX running Linux, and compared to the average
desktop install, it was a pain in the rear.  A lot of odd built-in
hardware with weird drivers, not the same as a full-sized motherboard. 
There are relatively few people running Linux on mini-ITX, so the
ST62K built-in chipsets doesn't get much attention. 

I chose the ST62K because it has a very quiet cooling system.  That
might be important for a sound recording system.  That said, I don't
even know if the sound input works on it.  Probably.

I put a different video card in it, using up the one and only PCI slot.

Thanks everyone.  I didn't know it was called mini-itx.  That is 
helpful.  I have seen the shuttles and was doubtful that Linux would 
cover any special or as mentioned hardly used.  I'll do some research 
and see what I find out.  Ideally I would like a low profile box and not 
such a tall one like the shuttle. 

Thanks again off to do some quality searching. 

Josh

Josh,

   You could probably find someone here who has an old SUN pizza box that will
run linux. Or, check FreeGeek to see what they have.

That's not Mini-ITX, and I'm not sure what it is though most people 
people refer to them as SFF (Small Form Factor) PC's.  I just see that 
as a rather generic term as it's sometimes used to describe many 
different compact machines.  Mini-ITX is a standard.

While at Pacific Solutions today I saw a couple of In-Win cases on the shelf.
Both were much smaller than a mini-tower. One was appx 2/3 size of a mini
tower and seemed to be designed to stand up or lay down.  The other was
flatter - more of a pizza box form factor but rectangular.  Linda said they
both support standard PC components and have 240W power supplies.  The
pizza-box like one only accept half height cards though.  

You can see an example of this case at 
http://www.in-win.us/products_pccase_series.php?cat_id=1&series_id=4

With standard PC components and a motherboard with built in peripherals you
should be able to keep the cost down.

Shuttle, AOpen and others make inexpensive "Mini" or "Small Form Factor"
barebones systems.  It's a case and motherboard, just add CPU, RAM and
HDD.  They're a bit bigger than a shoebox or loaf of bread.

If you want cheap, check out what's at Free Geek.  They sometimes have
laptops, mini systems and such.  Bring cash or a checkbook, they don't
take plastic yet.

Scott probably said a lot more than that, and the Oregonian reporter
chose the words that fit what he wanted to write.  I've talked with 
Scott a little about this, and my no-doubt-faulty impression is that
he wants to see a lot more commercial activity.  For example, an
individual or small business should be able to use open source and be
supported by a well-organized and efficient support services company.

To date there are a lot of inefficient small supoprt providers,
and large corp-to-corp providers like IBM, but little in between. 
No "H&R Block" or "Jiffy-Lube" or "Geek Squad" for open source. 
Scott's work on OpenID and reliable authentication may contribute
to the infrastructure such businesses will need.

Compiere is working on small business Enterprise Resource Planning
and Customer Relationship Management software (ERP and CRM), which
are also pieces of the puzzle.  The fact that such business needs
are invisible to most of us demonstrates how non-commercial most
of us are.  Most of our neighbors are out there buying and selling
stuff, though, and if we want them to use open source, we have to 
do things that are relevant to them.  Video player and blogging and
browser plugins are indeed just novelties to these business people,
compared to making and distributing the stuff of everyday existence.

Relevance is in the eye of the beholder.  To the vast majority of
eyes, computers in general and open source in particular are just
not that relevant.  We don't get to define relevance for these 
people, but we can identify it and move towards it if we choose.

The Portland PostgreSQL Users Group is recruiting!

Don't know what PostgreSQL is?  Go to http://www.postgresql.org/

We have a mailing list (send email to majordomo at postgresql.org, with 
"subscribe pdxpug" in the BODY of the message), and a website - 
http://pugs.postgresql.org/pdx/ - and we need a few more people.

Go ahead and subscribe to the mailing list to find out what we're up 
to!  We have a couple local experts lined up for talks, and are gearing 
up for a meeting in July. Subjects for talks might include DOMAINS, 
PL/pgSQL, DBD::Pg (my Perl bias is starting to show..).

A little bit about me --

I am a UNIX systems administrator with about 7 years of experience and 
I started working with PostgreSQL last year.  I'm in the middle of 
implementing an ERP package that uses pgSQL as its backend. If you're 
going to OSCON, I'll be helping staff the pgSQL booth, so you can stop

So, a question: Bearing in mind the overall size and scope and type of  
people who use Linux and open source, notably in the Portland area, *is*  
there a realistic market for an "H&R Block" or "Jiffy-Lube" or "Geek  
Squad" for open source? Or is the community just not substantial enough  
(yet at least) to support it?

   I looked at compiere's web site not long ago as I tried to find a CRM/sales
administration tool that would work with postgres Right Now. I did not look
too long at it. As a small business operation, I find "ERP for small
business" to be an oxymoron. We're not what one thinks of when the word
'enterprise' is mumbled.

   There's absolutely nothing wrong with commercialization of open source
applications. However, from what I've seen there's a bimodal distribution
that's developed. At the large business size end of the scale are
applications like SugarCRM which are designed for large businesses with a
professional sales team. (I have issues with their emphasis on eye candy and
hardwired requirement for mysql, but that's me.) At the small end there're a
few nascent projects done by one or a few folks in their spare time. The high
end is commercialized and the low end comes along gradually as time permits.

   FWIW, the XRMS team is getting closer to having their CRM working with
postgres. I did some work for them on translating the SQL for the access
control tables, so I hope to see a fully functional postgres port Real Soon
Now.

Randy,

   I believe there is a substantial number of small businesses of all types
that are running partially or completely on linux. However, they have already
established relationships with individual consultants (or consulting
companies), and I suspect that's the support model for the future, too.

   Those who are already using linux won't go to a storefront support
business, and neither will those who know nothing about linux or FOSS in
general. I suspect that defenestration decisions are based on trusting
relationships with individuals, and that such decisions will never be
commoditized.

This is a bit afield of the question of commericializing open source 
applications, but...

I'm the sole admin in a 30-person company. Workstations run (in order 
of preponderance) Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux.

Most of our servers run Linux (mostly CentOS, with some Debian mixed 
in), though a couple critical servers run OS X. We've got one Windows 
server.

What I could use is a company that could provide adequate backup to 
cover during my absence. I've talked about this with our exec staff -- 
and they've agreed that we could pay something akin to a retainer to 
an IT support firm that could cover emergencies or even step in during 
periods when things get crazy around here.

The firm's admins would need basic Unix and Windows troubleshooting 
skills, and I could provide documentation for the non-standard 
applications we use.

Such a firm would, of course, need a semi-broad customer base to be 
able to bill enough hours -- but I can say without a doubt there's at 
least a partial market here in Portland.

Jane Smallbusinesswoman will not use Linux until she can get this
support.  The market become substantial like most markets; you
build it, starting with zero customers.  Fortunately, 90% of the
work can be done remotely, so you can have customers anywhere you
can find local contractor semi-geeks who can follow instructions
for installs and initial configuration and so forth.  With a full
distributed second-level support team ( somebody who knows Linux
networking, somebody who knows business apps, etc. ), a support
company could provide deep knowledge without a lot of learning-
while-doing, a problem with the current support model.  You need
support staff that is patient and likes helping people with 
inadequate computer skills - nobody like that here. :-(

Such an effort might grow out of the distro companies.  It could
grow out of the right people at PLUG or POSSE.  The key for 
a successful businesses is the "learning curve", an empirical
rule of thumb that says that markets tend to grow by 10x when
price drops by half.  So if there are a dozen or so consultants
in the Portland area tweaking Linux for the occasional business,
then a system that permits the same work to be done twice as
efficiently would soon grow into sixty staff serving 10x the
customers, in Portland alone.  As the support process is
highly amenable to automation, lessons learned, etc., quite a
few efficiency doublings are possible.   Most of the automation
effort can be shared at a national level (helping muffler shops
in Idaho is very much like helping muffler shops in Vermont),
so a large effort can be much more efficient than a small one.

But all this has very little to do with most of the stuff we
spend our time doing.  It involves helping computer-ignorant
users, and many of us are too elitist for that.    The cool
thing is that it doesn't take a large percentage of Linux geeks
to develop a proper customer-service attitude, and succeed
brilliantly, while the rest of us stand around scratching our
heads and accusing them of selling out or something.

I think Scott Kveton is one of the folks that is figuring things
out, and I will enjoy watching him blow our doors off on his way
to success.

I have a couple more comments on this. The smb.conf
file must be modified by adding

use client driver = yes in the "Printers" section. As
for the use of a print server, it's often a good idea,
but in the case of multifunction machines, only the
print function is available (so it's not an option
here).

Also, Compaq has a nice little box that should be able to run Linux on 
it... and I know for fact that Budget Computers has one for $399. They 
will probably discount it some more if you tell them to keep their 
crappy os. The only thing that I would recommend from them is a laptop 
and a closed (proprietary) system. Don't buy anything else from them 
though... I can't say anything else as this may be seen as slander. (I 
used to work for them)

For me, it isn't about elitism, it's that i am not terribly interested
in computer support (outside the clinics, and those aren't support so
much as they are sharing my problem-solving skills/experience).
Elitism implies I think I am better than they are.  I don't.  I do
what works for me and I assume that other people to do what works for
them.  I'm happy to help where I can, because I am just a sharer by
nature.

I use Linux as a platform for solving problems.  I use it because it
lets me focus on my problems, not on Bill Gates' problems.  For me,
Microsoft basically doesn't even exist and hasn't existed since the
early 1990s.  I don't want to think about it and I usually don't have
to.

Recently, I was able to build a data collection platform on top of a
Knoppix CD so that I could continue developing on a sane platform and
the end-user could use whatever random hardware they had and I didn't
have to worry about their existing software environment.

To say that linux needs to succeed commercially to be relevant is
bogus.  It succeeded for me a long time ago and there isn't very much
that could happen that would reverse that success.  It might need to
"succeed commercially" (whatever that means) in order to generate
direct jobs for people.  So, that might seem relevant for economic
development wonks (who tradeoff public investment/incentives against
future tax revenues).  But FOSS succeeds and draws investment because
of the money it saves (and the control/flexibility it provides), not
so much because of the money it has the potential to extract from
others.

I wish Scott Kveton good luck, etc, but his success is not
particularly relevant to me.

Hi all,

If you've been to a meeting in the last few months, you may have heard 
me mention OSCamp.  If you didn't go to Recent Changes Camp, you're 
probably wondering what OSCamp is "about."  The answer is that it's 
about whatever you make it about, but I'm trying to make that more 
tangible for those with less imagination.

  http://oscamp.org/Call_for_Speakers

We're looking for presentations like:

  "Have you thought of using this open-source technology in your 
$underfunded_cause organization?"

  "This small business would have had to close the doors without 
$open_source_technology_x."

And other sorts of talks with these qualities:

  * light on tech
  * neat / warm-fuzzy
  * community / small biz / government / education
  * mildly commercial / infommercial testimonials

These parameters are flexible.  My main goal is to get OSCamp to be a 
gateway drug to oscon and/or OSS and/or Portland.

As I see it, the OSCamp crowd will consist of (hopefully)

  A.  oscon attendees who wandered in
  B.  community folk who couldn't afford/justify the cost of oscon
  C.  curious onlookers who might not otherwise be thinking about OSS

I'm shooting for a healthy C crowd, but I think getting some tangible 
speakers/topics on the schedule is critical to making that happen.

If you're interested in speaking, please contact me and/or any other 
OSCamp representative.

Of course, if you're not interested in speaking, still do come down and 
see what it's all about.  If you're having trouble getting off work, 
put a page that says there will be a session on "$topic related to 
$job" on the wiki and show your boss :-)

Thanks,
Eric

Look in the yellow pages. She doesn't know if the support is good or
not but there are places. And she has been 'influenced' my u$soft with
visits, glossies, FUD, etc, etc. i know only one other company that is
as good, actually better if they want to sell you something, IBM.

If you have never been where your company has been targeted by u$Soft,
you have no idea the pressure, FUD, etc. it is quite impressive to say
the least.

It not the skill of a consultant that will get her to decide, remember
that is after the sale not before. How may of us have say $3K to spend
getting the deal ?

Once they have their foot in the door, that part of the 'team' is off
to the next sucker.

Message-ID: <20060624125055.8eb20bbb.johnxj@comcast.net>

I keep having to do this. The files are zip archives that a Windows user just has to double-click on to uncompress. It's a pain to have to go to my Windows desktop to do this. File Roller won't do it. I don't need to be able to double-click on the archive to extract it; a command line utility would be fine. Is there a Linux utility that can unzip these things and preserve the internal directory structure in the process?

Under cygwin on a Windows box, I've been able to just have unzip do it 
directly.  I'm assuming that's a standard feature, but maybe not.

Wine?  I've used CrossOver office to decompress these things.

Self-extracting zips are just normal zip files with the SFX prefix
concatenated with the zip file and a .exe extension.  The command-line
"unzip" is smart enough to handle it (at least on my FC5 box).  You
can even create them, but you need to find the prefix first online
somewhere.

Thanks.  this looks promising.  I have also found some laptops on 
overstock.com that are $500 that would work.  Not sure if they will run 
linux and they come with windows.  Seems like I could find either one 
that has linux installed already or that some type of computer w/o an OS 
and save more money.  Just unsure as of now. 

Thanks all, I've been doing more and more research.  Getting closer.  
Heck, I even thought to buy my own odd box and just build the computer 
in there.

Josh,

   Overstock.com has been in the news recently -- in a negative way. Be
cautious.

   You can take a look at the linux-on-laptops web site and find someone
who's installed linux on most makes and models. I know that Toshiba and IBM
offer almost certain working installations; I've had Red Hat and Slackware on
both.

Subject: [PLUG] Unzipping files on Linux
Message-ID: <52v2a7$16i2nbb@mxip30a.cluster1.charter.net>

About the need to unzip files on Linux . I took a zip file from Windows, put
it on my Ubuntu box and typed unzip <filename>.zip and it unzipped. The
unzip was by default in /usr/bin as /usr/bin/unzip. Is this what the
discussion was about .. Or am I missing something? It seemed prety easy.

Actually I was (with the Eclipse workbench) building an Eclipse plug-in
manually. The best way is of coure to use Ant, but I'm new to Eclipse
plug-in development, and this was easier (for now). With Eclipse you select
File --> Export and then select "Deployable plug-ins and fragments". I chose
directory rather than archive file, and ended up with a directory called
plugins that had the jar file and a file called <filename>.gz. Gunzip did
not like this file. I got an error that said

Gunzip: <filename>.gz has more than one entry -- unchanged. 

But unzip worked fine on the file. Confusing, I thought.

Then, I took a Windows zip and put in on my Linux box and used unzip. All
the files deflated and I got a directory structure.

Thanks!

Dunno why I didn't try that. First I tried double clicking on it, but nada. Then I right-clicked, which gave me the option of opening it with File Roller and that was the only choice. And File Roller woudn't touch it. It never occurred to me just to type "unzip." Instructions duly logged for the next time this happens. And as it turns out, I didn't even need the file after all -- it was to get wifi working under Dapper, but I found a different way that works. Don't have wifi at home, so tomorrow I'll go to PSU and try it out. (Keeping fingers crossed.)

I love Dapper! (Now that I've forced it to my will, that is.)

   ... there are many questions to be answered. We see this posted here on a
regular basis.

   It turns out that there are a couple of available resources. Marcel Gagne
wrote a book called, "Moving to Linux: Kiss The Blue Screen of Death
Goodbye," the second edition of which was published last year. Now there's
another one, "Linux Starter Kit," by Emmett Delaney which is reviewed by
Peter Salus on Groklaw:
         <http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060624125126700>

   These may be helpful as basic reference materials (even if you don't want
the encluded Knoppix or SuSE distribution disks) to some local subscribers,
as well as birthday and other holiday presents for friends and family. So, I
thought I'd pass on the information.

   Without knowing just what these books provide (other than the accompanying
distributions), I suppose there's still a need for "Running Linux" in a
(excuse me) "light" version. For those who find the long time standard too
difficult. Anyway, I hope this information is useful to someone here.

Subject: [PLUG] Filesystem issues
Message-ID: <20060625084539.c9334187.johnxj@comcast.net>

In the process of fixing my borked Breezy-64 installation I have been
having lots of filesystem errors, discovered by the system on booting.
This prompts a couple b00bie questions. (That was a typo but I decided
it might be appropriate to leave it.)

1) I googled and man-paged on fsck and can't find a way to give a
command that it should be run on the next boot before the filesystem is
mounted. I did try to run it while the system was mounted, but it gave
me dire warnings, so I canceled. Maybe I missed the option that I need.
I can't give the command during boot because there is no command line
then. In Windows the GUI has an option to clean up the disk or
something (never needed it), and if you click on Yes it announces it
will be run on the next boot. What is the Linux way to do this? Or is
there a better way?

2) The filesystem is ext3. Back before I swapped the original 60 GB
4200 hard drive for the new 80 GB 7200 one currently installed, I got
filesystem errors two or three times. Now, with the new drive, I am
getting them more frequently. In ten years of using Windows NT and 2000
I never had a filesystem error using NTFS (except when a hard drive was
dying on me, but that doesn't really count). So is my problem with
ext3? Is it a beta version or something? Or am I just having really bad
luck with flaky hard drives? Should I send the new one back under
warranty? I can't believe I'm having so much trouble. As further
information, the problems are always goofed up inodes. And fsck always
fixes them graciously and without further incident. It's just that this
many errors can't be normal. Admittedly, what I have been doing lately
has resulted in quite a lot of hung systems, kernel panics, and other
problems requiring me to hit the power button to get out -- no keyboard
or mouse. It still seems to me that something is flaky.

My Breezy-64 installation is so hopelessly borked that I am going to
reformat its 60 GB partition and install Dapper-64 on it fresh. I have
been using Dapper-64 on this new installation that I made on an 8 GB
partition in an unused area of the new hard disk. I have played with it
for several days now and figured out how to get everything working
again as before (Broadcom wifi, RealPlayer, Adobe Reader, Firefox-64,
Flash and other plugins), and without needing chroot or ndiswrapper.
Before I reformat the partition I want to consider perhaps using a
different filesystem. Right now I'm not impressed with ext3, but I also
may be blaming it for problems caused by other issues, such as a flaky
hard disk. I also note that I am probably rougher on a filesystem than
most users, considering how I am always trying something that results
in a hung system, so maybe the culprit is me. Some advice from those
with more experience and knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of
the various Linux filesystem types would be gratefully received.

Asside from `rssh` (restricted SSH) there is also `scponly`. I suspect
the former is more configurable, while the latter might more directly
address your issue.

My tendancy is not place OO in the same level as the procedural and
functional languages. Pretty well all the OO languages are procedural,
and OO is more a way of organizing the program, not of writing the
program.

Anyone who is decent with C writes OO programs. Just now there is a
formal term for type of organization used. The distinguishing
characteristic is simply that with an OO language, the compiler takes
care of creating the jump tables for you.

There is also the temptation to refer to the one group as dys-functional
languages.

I'd guess the most is craft breweries, followed by programming languages,
then text editors with Linux distributions bringing up the rear of
this list. Though this is only a guess.

If you show up at an advanced topics meeting and say that you might get
punched, and you will deserve that and more. Programming languages such
as Python or Ruby are at a completely different level than a text
formatting language like HTML. HTML is at worst linear complexity to
handle, Python and Ruby are vastly more complex.

I'm sorry, but it very definitely sounds like #1. Time to queue the
jokes. As I think you've figured out, the Dapper Drake install noticed
the existing filesystem and mounted it. In general a reasonable and
pretty harmless thing to do, though it sounds like it confused you.

> Besides getting messed up, what do inodes do?

They're a specific piece of on-disk structure. In traditional filesystems
you get two types of blocks; data blocks and blocks of inodes. Data
blocks simply hold actual file data, simple and boring. inodes are the
"heads" of files, they contain permissions information and point to
blocks of data, they also hold a reference counter. A directory is an
inode where the data blocks contain filenames and pointers to inodes. Due
to the reference counter, multiple directories can contain links to the
same inode and the reference counter tracks the number of links (this is
what `ln` without -s does). For really large files the inode has an
indirection pointer, which is simply a data block with pointers to other
data blocks (with the largest files on a traditional UFS filesystem,
there could be 3 levels of indirection).

So literally an inode is pretty well a single file.

A wrong reference count means the reference counter on the inode had a
number that was different from the number of links that `fsck` found. If
the reference counter was too low, if one link was removed the system
might try deleting the data blocks while there was still a legitimate
pointer to the file. If the reference counter was too high, the system
might of removed the last link, but never marked the data blocks as
unused. On ext2 inodes also have a marker indicating whether they're a
file, or have been deleted; so if fsck finds an inode that is marked as
a file, but no links that is an unreferenced inode.

In traditional filesystems, inodes are allocated in distinct areas of the
disk, separate from where data blocks are located. This makes allocation
simpler, disk checks simpler and works pretty well. Some filesystems,
such as ReiserFS simply allocate inodes out of the pool of data blocks.

One interesting bug report was a case of a disk recovery firm storing an
image of a ReiserFS on top of a ReiserFS filesystem. They had a crash and
had to run a full check with fsck. fsck found the contents of the
filesystem, but it also found something that looked like part of a valid
ReiserFS filesystem inside the data blocks of what was a file. The
result was it merge the FS-image with the parent filesystem. Afterwords
they added per-FS magic numbers to the inode blocks. An interesting case
of the unexpected happening.

The simplest is to do `touch /forcefsck`. Nearly all distributions this
will pass "-f" to fsck on the next boot, forcing fsck to look at the
filesystems even though they appear to be clean (unmounted properly).

The hard-core hacker way is to pass "init=/bin/bash" to the kernel. This
causes the kernel to run the shell instead of init, and you get a true
single-process system. From here you run `fsck` and clear out any damage
that has been done. If you need to remove or change anything on the
root filesystem you do `mount -n / -o rw,remount` (and a
`mount -n / -o ro,remount` when done!).

Subject: [PLUG] ruby on rails hosting
Message-ID: <449F79D9.60907@hexi.com>

Wanted to 2 or 3 existing domains to a new web host and also get into 
ruby/rails (have previously been using php/mysql). I found a list of 
providers at http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/RailsWebHosts but 
there's not much in the way of reviews.

I've looked briefly at godaddy and railsplayground, but I'm concerned 
about hooking up w/ a service too big to care or too small to have 
proper security and/or handle popularity spikes.

Railsplayground looked promising, just wondered if anyone had used it.

Since I'm more interested in development than running existing packages 
from others, 'the official ruby on rails host' (textdrive) is apparently 
not for me.  I found this rather designer-hostile statement in their 
FAQ...

Q:"Can I use my account for development or testing?"
A:"Absolutely not. TextDrive does not allow the shared and business 
servers to be used for testing, development, tinkering or sandboxing in 
any form."

Any feedback on good hosts appreciated!

Perhaps you should check out http://pdxruby.org/ , but I wouldn't be 
doing my job if I didn't suggest that you instead consider Jifty 
(http://jifty.org/) and come hang out with the http://pdx.pm.org/ 
crowd :-)

In either case, you'll need a shell account (preferably root) to be able 
to do anything useful.  There is some experience in the PLUG group with 
various virtual host services.

Elliott,

   While I was being flippant, I recently read that there are about 200 linux
distributions! That boggles my tiny mind, and I'm sure the number has
increased since then.

   HTML is a subset of SGML, the family of text markup languages that describe
how text is to be formatted for presentation on a computer screen, printed
page, or spoken report. Page layout via text markup is _not_ programming
under any definition of the term.

   Germane to the original question, there is no "best" programming language
(in the opinion of this non-professional). It all depends on what you want to
have the computer do.

   Share the costs and efforts of digitizing our collections. I suspect that
for most of us it will be a one-time process, so it makes sense to cooperate
on the effort. Besides, we could get to listen to what others enjoy(ed) in

I'm unlikely to show up at an advanced topics meeting, since I assume 
those are for IT professionals and advanced Linux users, and I'm 
neither.  I wasn't aware that some computer languages are not 
programming languages.  At any rate, he said he planned to learn a

I've had a little time to try out the USB turntable using Audacity on my 
XP laptop. I haven't had time to clear all the dependencies and get 
Audacity 1.2.3 or higher installed on my Linux machine (SuSE 9.1). The 
earlier version of Audacity doesn't look like it supports the USB 
interface, but it may be my ignorance of how to "wire" the connection in 
the OS.

The recording process is simple enough, and I'm satisfied with the 
quality, as far as that step goes. What I haven't done successfully is 
to remove scratches from music with a wide dynamic range. The 
recommendations on the Audacity forum say that one should sample the 
noise at the beginning of the LP and then remove that from the rest of 
the recording. When I do that for a recording of Chuck Mangione's 
Bellavia, it works well. But when I do it from a The Moody Blues Days of 
Future Passed, it takes out some of the music.

When I recorded music with Gramofile I could use the included filter set 
to remove scratch and pop noise successfully from classical recordings 
without losing quiet music in the process. I'll have to try hooking up 
the turntable to the line in port of the sound card on my Linux machine 
and see what Gramofile does with Days of Future Passed.

BTW, it doesn't work to record with Audacity, export to wav, and then 
try to remove the noise with Gramofile. Each has its own native format, 
and does the noise removal based on those files, not a wav file.

Does anyone know of a noise filtering program that will work on a wav file?

Audacity has a useful feature if you want to have a single music file 
instead of separate files for each track. You can record the two sides 
of an LP or tape separately and then copy and paste side two into side 
one. You could also pause the recording while flipping the LP over. 
Also, if you have separate tracks in mp3, wav, or ogg format and want to 
combine them, Audacity can import each of those.

If you want to go the other way and separate out tracks, Gramofile has 
an automated feature for this that works most of the time. I think 
Audacity can do it too, but the advantage with Audacity is the graph it 
displays of the sound which makes it easier to see the quiet bit between 
tracks.

HTML describes textual content and, to a lesser extent, its visual 
layout.

Programming languages, on the other hand, describe hardware behavior. 
Some programing languages put several layers of abstraction between 
you and the hardware; others allow you to manipulate it with little 
mediation.

While mastering HTML is a very useful skill for communicating with 
other people in the Web Age, it has little to do with telling your 
computer how to accomplish a task.

You make us sound like a rough crowd.  I've only been to about 15 of 
these but the heckling never gets quite past the polite jab.  Did there 
used to be more arm-wrestling, brawling, bouncers, etc?

Can you back-up that claim about Python?  (^_^)  I agree that HTML is 
not programming, but it (or maybe XML) would certainly get the OP a 
foothold on the concept of dealing with the strict nature of a computer 
language (assuming use of a validator) and even the concept of 
cross-platform idiosyncrasies.  The next step would be CSS, server-side 
includes, XSLT, and other transformations.  Add use of emacs or vim 
plus apache administration for extra teeth-cutting bonus points.  
Javascript?

I just opened Synaptic on my Dapper-64 installation and it listed
Audacity 1.2.4b, so I installed it. Seems to run just fine. Can't find
any button for USB interface, though. Also, it uses that hideous gtk1.2
interface where I have no options to change the appearance. Oh well.
I'll only need to look at it while ripping my vinyl, and then never
again. It has TONS of bells and whistles, and I have no idea what any
of them do. I'm an idiot when it comes to multimedia stuff because I've
never been interested in it and have always ignored the whole subject.
If I need multimedia stuff done I just get one of the teenagers from up
the street. :)

During the installation Synaptic gave me warnings that stuff wasn't
supported, and there were several libraries it had to install. Didn't
end up with any dependency issues, though.

By that definition I would say HTML fits the bill.  It very much so

HTML is a Markup Language (hence the ML).  It is no more different than 
pressing ctl-b to get bold text in a word processor, though, slightly more 
verbose.

While it is a Language, it is not a Programming Language.  A rule-of-thumb 
test to see if something is a programming language is to ask if there's a way 
to say 'if' in the language you're using. 

Of course, it's a rule of thumb, not a law carved in stone.

BIG WARNING!! BIG WARNING!! BIG WARNING!! BIG WARNING!!

MS Windows DOESN'T sublicense nor can a license for MS Windows be 
transferred to a third party.  Ignore preinstalled MS Windows, 
it's best to uninstall that and throw the media out if you can't
purchase or don't possess a valid license from Microsoft.  You can 
go to jail for using MS Windows without the proper license.  
Considering Microsoft's attitude about piracy, the question really 
is, when will someone go to prison?  Buying used equipment or any 
equipment for that matter, your best bet is to make sure it's 
open source software compatible up front.  If you have to spend a 
little more, believe me that it's worthwhile to get equipment
that will serve you well.

That's a viable idea depending on what you are trying to accomplish.
You don't need a case per se to run a pc as long as it's grounded
properly, etc.  I've been thinking it would be nice to build a MythTV
system for example directly into the cabinet of a big screen television 
skipping the ATX case.

I hear that SUN systems are good for music and video work, might be 
something worth looking into depending on what you're after.

Zot O'Connor's initial fantasy for the AT talk was that it would be
(or could be) somewhat contentious, and for some time it was billed
that way.  I guess in contrast to the general meeting talk that ought
to be polite (or something).  In my experience, having attended about
90% of the AT talks since their inception, they have never really been
very contentious.  No one has ever even had a serious argument over
emacs and vi.  I guess the vi weenies eventually realized their
unmitigatable inferiority and gave up.  Emacs rules forever! ;-)

OK, So I was "born" into my programming career using Java, but I have
Taken the time to learn a bit of C, C++, ASP, Perl, and Visual Basic
(eeewww).

I really enjoy programming in Java and it does all that I need, 
That is to say that I can share code across my desktop apps, 
My web apps, and my applets.  (Yes I need all three)

Is there anyone on this list that can give me a truly unbiased :)
Reason why I shouldn't use Java for all of this?

Bill,

If it works for you, who cares what anyone else's opinion is.
Do what you know, know what you do, learn what you don't, pick what you
like.

Its the same idea as choosing an OS, some people pick based on belief's,
some
choose based on feature, some choose based on familiarity. Every once in a
while
you will come across someone that will make it their personal mission to try
and get
you to change your ways. When it comes to developing software, I would much
rather
have a person that loves/knows the language they code with then a person
that is just
using ruby/c/python/Delphi(pascal)/c#/vb/...etc just because that's what
everyone else is using.

Good Luck,
Mark Turner

From: Josh Berkus <josh at postgresql.org>

With the release of Solaris 10 Update 2, Sun today announced the inclusion of
PostgreSQL in Solaris and the availability of PostgreSQL support
(http://sun.com/solaris/postgresql.jsp).

This offering gives Solaris users ready access to a high-performance RDBMS,
and the confidence of Sun worldwide support for their production
applications.  PostgreSQL users can take this as an opportunity to
re-evaluate the Solaris platform for their projects where reliability is a
central goal.

The Sun database and performance engineers, led by Core Team member Josh
Berkus, will be working over the next few months to improve and expand the
PostgreSQL for Solaris distribution, enhance performance, and add new
features.  100% of these enhancements will be open source and contributed to
the PostgreSQL project or appropriate associated projects.

Sun PostgreSQL for Solaris support starts at 1596USD per year, worldwide.

See, Russell? vi folks know their superiority and have no need for 
discussing preferences with folks who need an entire operating system 
just to edit text.

But mention Java ... then the fighters come out! :-)

Not really.

The main perception of Java as "evil" has been from the non-free license 
agreement the Sun tools have had.  Other than that, it it works then use 
it.

See?  You forgot to hit ESC again before trying to do a 'colon' whatever it
is you were trying to do.

(In emacs, nothing like that happens, of course.)

this is a bit unfair, and IMHO wrong perception. The biggest disadvantage of 
Java applications is that somehow you always end up with a klunky JRE on your 
system, and that java itself is a byte-compiled system (the language isn't, 
but the implementation is).

This may seem very efficient for modern (fast, large memory) systems but every 
time I see a phone load a java game (for 30 seconds...), I cannot think 
otherwise than that java is not well suited for any embedded application, even 
though the mobile phone industry thinks I prefer to swallow it :)

Most older programmers don't want to see the large layer of obscurity that the 
VM adds in between - and certainly it's going to be tough doing kernel 
programming in Java.

That makes Java the ultimate application programming language: it will never 
be (POV) suitable for anything lowlevel as kernel code. You won't see much 
Java books on a linux kernel hackers' bookshelf :)


Cheers,

Auke

Please elaborate. What does "transferred to a third party" mean?  If I buy a
used machine I cannot use the OS installed on it?

I'm all for open-source, but...

"Transfer to Third Party. The initial user of the Software may make a
one-time permanent transfer of this EULA and Software to another end
user, provided the initial user retains no copies of the Software.
This transfer must include all of the Software (including all
component parts, the media and printed materials, any upgrades, this
EULA, and, if applicable, the Certificate of Authenticity). The
transfer may not be an indirect transfer, such as a consignment. Prior
to the transfer, the end user receiving the Software must agree to all
the EULA terms."

Could you explain for me exactly how that doesn't allow you to
transfer to a third-party?

The way Windows OEM licensing works is that the version of Windows you 
get with a PC lives and dies with that PC.  Meaning that if you install 
Linux on the machine you can't offer the Windows license that came with 
the PC to anyone else.  If you eventually throw the PC in the trash, you 
cannot keep the Windows license and use it on another machine either.

But you can certainly give or sell the machine to someone and the 
license goes with it.

The retail version of Windows does not have these restrictions.  It's 
very simple.  Don't register software, and they will never know.  This 
is such a gray area that it's not enforceable.  What constitutes a new 
computer?  If your new eMachine blows it's all-in-one motherboard 2 
months out of warranty and you throw an Asus in there to replace it, 
it's basically a new machine.

Microsoft was *giving* away free licenses of Windows a few months back 
(maybe they still are) if people turned in the *distributors* who are 
mass installing this stuff and offering discounted licenses now for 
people that just want to come clean.  Where's the hand cuffs in that? 
What attitude are you talking about?

The only people going to jail are the ones who are knowingly mass 
producing or distributing illegal versions of Windows.  And you know 
what?  It's not like those types of people don't know what they're 
doing.  They can't complain.

I don't like the way Windows licensing works either, but your argument 
is based on incorrect assumptions.

Would XSLT be considered a programming language?  XSLT is written in  
XML, which is a mark-up language like HTML.

Just curious.

Yes.  It is declarative, functional language specialized to doing tree
transformations on XML. It is Turing complete.  You wouldn't want to
use it for general-purpose programming but it is a programming
language.

You could create a normal programming language in XML. XML is just a
syntax for markup languages.  The specific markup languages can be
interpreted as a programming language.  It is usually used for data
structures and is most suited for documents.

Right, the VM is what allows for cross-platform compatibility, which is an
advantage most Linux users can appreciate.  It's really not klunky, just
something you have to install once.  So how is bytecode worse than native
binaries, notwithstanding the very marginal performance hit?

Kernel programming in Java?  Would you pick your teeth with a javelin?  How
about writing a word processor in assembler?  That "layer of obscurity" is
also a good thing.  It means that Java programmers don't have to worry about
how things are done at a lower lever, so it's much easier to code complex
operations while avoiding many of the memory leaks and security holes that C
and C++ tend to foster.

Indeed, most kernel hackers know one tool from another.  But Mr. Ensley was
asking about using Java for his Web app's and desktop app's, for which Java
is eminently suited.  The licensing issues surrounding it have been debated
for years, but I would say it's more just idealism than any practical
consideration.

I take it you have not studied the rationale behind Free Software, and do not 
understand the very practical effects of it.  Blind idealism is trusting in 
the goodwill of a vendor, rather than in legally-binding software license 
that protects end-users and the hard work of developers.

[KvetchMode:On]
Having spent the past hour trying to copy my /home/jjj folder from one
location to another, I guess I'm going to have to learn to do file
copying via the command line. I drag the folder to the new location and
it copies some files, but not others. It copies some folders, but not
others. And they all act this way -- XFE, Konqueror, Krusader,
Nautilus, and even when I run them from the terminal as root. You have
to go through painstakingly comparing the two folders to see what
didn't get copied, then copy just that one file. Over and over. During
the past year I've tried every GUI file manager there is, and not one
of them will copy all the subfolders and al the files in those
subfolders. No warnings, no explanations as to why. I've never figured
out what the secret is. It's not permissions or ownership because when
I go back and drag the files one at a time they copy just fine.

The task at hand arises because I have a perfectly good and usable
Ubuntu Dapper-64 installation that I created in an unused portion of my
hard disk. I have spent several days getting it all configured.
installing all my apps, getting wifi working, making sure everything
was cool. In the process I copied all the files in /home/jjj from my
borked Breezy installation. The new Dapper installation is ultimately
going to be my emergency rescue installation, since it is set to mount
the old Breezy partition. Having done that, today I reformatted the
borked 60 GB Breezy installation and installed a new, fresh Dapper-64
on it, which will ultimately be the main installation. Now I need to
copy all the configs one more time. It took me a couple hours the first
time, and I'm an hour into it the second time. 

I tried to learn how to use the cp command. Really, I did. I read the
man page, I googled, and I remain too scared to use it. Too many
options that I didn't understand. So here I sit, dragging files one at
a time. And it's too effin' hot, too. <sigh>

The -a flag follows the principle of least surprise; it's recursive,
it preserves file permissions and timestamps, and links remain links.
It's the "do what I mean" option. The -v flag shows you what's
happening, which is nice for large copies.

As long as directory /home/blah is not present, just:
cp -av /home/jjj /home/blah

When you're scared, "cd /tmp" and try out stuff there.

Yeah, it was an exaggeration. I've been wanting really badly to strangle

True about the strictness and dealing certain browser's handling of HTML,
but that still isn't programming. A valuable lesson, but not programming.
Python is very much a programming language. One with a fairly high
level of abstraction (similar level as Java), but still a programming
language, not merely a formatting language.


As someone who regularly deals with *programming* languages, I find the
implicit comparsons that are done way too often, very insulting.

Nah, I've got enough other holy wars to fight without that one. I don't
need to tout the superiority of vi. I've been hoping someone would make
a Debian "anti-emacs" package that simply conflicted with every single
emacs package and ensured those could never in installed.

Been hoping for a similar thing for SQL. I'd prefer to avoid a full DB
on my *desktop* machine.

I'll support the delivery of a small nuclear device to the Exim
developers. I wish they'd learn that making a program easy to configure,
but full of security holes and therefore needing a great deal of
maintenance is a great deal more of a pain than a harder to configure,
but secure and less often update program. Ugh, and Debian prefers Exim,
yuck! Particularly when they've got all these other MUAs with scripts
that make them similarly easy to configure.

Is Qmail worthy? For a small site at least?

Likely they do. In the end though, it is a tool, so what.

[KvetchMode:On]
Having spent the past hour trying to copy my /home/jjj folder from one
location to another, I guess I'm going to have to learn to do file copying
via the command line. I drag the folder to the new location and it copies
some files, but not others. It copies some folders, but not others. And they
all act this way -- XFE, Konqueror, Krusader, Nautilus, and even when I run
them from the terminal as root. You have to go through painstakingly
comparing the two folders to see what didn't get copied, then copy just that
one file. Over and over. During the past year I've tried every GUI file
manager there is, and not one of them will copy all the subfolders and al
the files in those subfolders. No warnings, no explanations as to why. I've
never figured out what the secret is. It's not permissions or ownership
because when I go back and drag the files one at a time they copy just fine.

The task at hand arises because I have a perfectly good and usable Ubuntu
Dapper-64 installation that I created in an unused portion of my hard disk.
I have spent several days getting it all configured.
installing all my apps, getting wifi working, making sure everything was
cool. In the process I copied all the files in /home/jjj from my borked
Breezy installation. The new Dapper installation is ultimately going to be
my emergency rescue installation, since it is set to mount the old Breezy
partition. Having done that, today I reformatted the borked 60 GB Breezy
installation and installed a new, fresh Dapper-64 on it, which will
ultimately be the main installation. Now I need to copy all the configs one
more time. It took me a couple hours the first time, and I'm an hour into it
the second time. 

I tried to learn how to use the cp command. Really, I did. I read the man
page, I googled, and I remain too scared to use it. Too many options that I
didn't understand. So here I sit, dragging files one at a time. And it's too
effin' hot, too. <sigh> [KvetchMode:Off]

Subject: [PLUG] Dapper + Reiser
Message-ID: <20060627010653.8dc2a011.johnxj@comcast.net>

OK, I had to reformat that old Breezy partition because "sudo apt-get
dist update" got it so mucked up there was no hope. And I wanted to try
out Reiserfs, because everyone seems to think it's a lot faster than
ext3.

So I stuck the Dapper-64 DVD in the drive and restarted the computer.
When the live version came up it had an icon on the desktop labeled
INSTALL in very large letters. I proceeded to install. Except that the
only way you can install and reformat a partition at the same time is
to use ext3. Reiserfs is not an option. However, since I was actually
running Dapper-64 from the CD, I just exited from the Install utility
and used Disk Manager, which was happy to format the partition
Reiserfs. Then I went back and installed Dapper-64 on it. I had to undo
all the defaults to do so, because it still insisted on reformatting
it. But it did recognize the reiserfs filesystem, and after poking at
it a bit I figured out how to make it work.

Then I spent the next eight hours trying to get it all configured the
way I want it. That included two hours trying to figure out why the
Ubuntu wiki instructions to get wireless up and running worked fine on
the test setup, but wouldn't work this time. (Still not resolved.) And
I spent more hours reinstalling applications, trying to get my configs
transferred over, etc. Finally I got all that done, but I noticed that
nothing could see my fonts. They were in a Fonts folder in /home/jjj,
which worked fine in Breezy, but I guess not in Dapper. So I proceeded
to move them all to /usr/share/fonts. That part actually worked using
the GUI drag and drop. But I guess it's because they were not inside
folders. Anyway, I got all but the OpenType fonts in, and decided I
wanted to make a separate folder for them. And then I discovered that
it never occurred to any of the Nautilus developers that a user might
want to create a folder. No buttons for that. So I fired up Konqueror,
but it wouldn't come up, even though I had been using it earlier.
Neither would Krusader. Or XFE. This was too much. Something bad must
be going on. 

I decided to restart. But when I hit the Shutdown icon, it started to
shut down, then suddenly X came back, then it disappeared and it went
back to shutting down, then X reappeared, and back and forth for a
while. Then a window popped up with a wonderful error message that said
"the graphical subsystem has been shut down and restarted six times in
the last 90 seconds. This probably means something really bad is going
on." (I swear, that is what it said. Now where would you get something
as pungent as that in Windows?) So I decided to hit the power button
and restart.

It started back up, but X wouldn't start. It just kept trying and
failing and trying and failing. I didn't wait for the "six times" error
message. I just hit the power button. 

Then I tried the second choice for this installation -- the 15-23
kernel instead of the 15-25 that is the top choice. The 15-23 one never
even got to trying to start X. It hung on "loading hardware drivers."
That's probably because I had been using nothing but the 15-25, so that
is the kernel that the drivers were set up for. (Just a guess.)

At that point I decided to go back to this test/rescue installation. I
figured it was set to mount hda2 automatically during boot, so I could
use it to poke around and maybe figure out what is wrong. Well, what
was wrong was Reiserfs. In the middle of booting the test installation
announced that there was a bad superblock on hda2 and it could not
mount it. From reading the rest of the error message, it was clear that
Dapper-64 cannot mount a Reiserfs partition. It did not even recognize
it, hence the "bad superblock" message.

So my new installation is borked. Won't boot and I don't have an easy
way to get at the partition. Not that I have much likelihood of
figuring out what is wrong anyway. Tomorrow I'll have to start over.
Eight hours down the tube. But just think how much I have learned about
Linux! <sigh>

Oh, and Reiserfs is no faster than ext3. 

But while writing this chapter in the saga of How Not to Install Linux,
It occurrred to me that I should just use this test installation to
reformat the 60 GB hda2 partition (as ext3), then copy absolutely
everything from the test installation to hda2. I can use Aaron's rescue
CD that I copied at the last clinic, and I even wrote down the copy
syntax. Not sure how Grub will take that, though. But it's worth a
shot. And if it doesn't work, I'll learn even more about How Not to
Install Linux!

In case you've never tried it, a nice middle-ground between sucky GUI 
file managers and scary command-line file operations is Midnight 
Commander (aka "mc").  It's a classic two-paned file manager with a 
curses interface that runs in a terminal.  Helpfully, it has the main 
file operations displayed in a neat little row across the bottom of the 
terminal, so you don't even have to remember what "F7" does vs. what 
"F8" does.

To copy files or directories, navigate to the file or directory you want 
to copy on one side of mc so that it is highlighted, navigate to the 
destination on the other side, and hit F5.  To move them, rather than 
copy them, hit F6.  If you're using mc in a terminal, you can even use 
the mouse.

I use it much more than I use either Nautilus or 'mv' or 'cp'.  But I 
guess I'm partial to two-paned file managers.  They always made sense to 
me, conceptually; I used one back in Windows days as well.  A good GUI 
two-paned manager for Linux is emelfm, but mc does everything I need and 
has the advantage of working on the console, so I stopped using emelfm.

One thing to keep in mind is that, as with the 'rm' command, deleting a 
file with mc is really deleting it.  It doesn't move it to the trash.  
But it does ask for a confirmation.

   Consider postfix. That's what I've been running the past seven years. Even
I installed and configured it, and it's very secure.

I did try Midnight Commander, but I find it easier and more logical to
have a tree in the left pane and when you click on a folder in the tree
its contents are displayed in the right pane. But your comment points
out one important thing in all these discussions -- our minds all work
differently.

The very best file manager I ever used was Norton File Manager for NT
3.51. You had a choice of various "looks," but the default was similar
to the original file manager that Windows 3.1 came with. Except Norton
added all the stuff that Microsoft didn't think anyone would want -- an
FTP utility, built in zip compression or (optionally) compress with
NT's compression, a file viewer pane (like Konqueror, but it popped up
on the bottom instead of taking over the whole window), file
associations, network points, share creation, permissions, and just
about anything else one would want to do with a file manager. It was
compact, came up instantly, and everything you needed to do was in one
program window. 

I'm learning a new term here, I think -- "recursive." That's when it
moves not just the folder you're dragging, but all its contents,
subfolders, and their contents as well, right? 

OK, off to try to copy this installation to the 60 GB partition. But
this time I'm not going to cross my fingers. I think the computer saw
me do that last time. Realizing that I didn't know what I was doing it
deliberately screwed things up. Computers'll do that, ya know.

I have read something about it.  But I haven't read of any cases where
Java's license was ever an issue, and I think it very unlikely that I will.
Nothing is certain, but in this case we have a very potent and well
established language which we can feel reasonably secure in using.  A storm
may roll in over the west hills this afternoon, but I'm not carrying an
umbrella.  You may call that idealism, but I call it getting on with things.

Thank you all for your responses.

What I gather is this:

Strictly as a programming language, Java is versatile and powerfull (enough)
to get the job done.

The evils as I understand them stem less from the language and more from
peoples perspective
On what "free" software should and shouldn't be.

Is this about right?

P.S.  Are there other languages that I should look at that will allow me to
share code
Between desktop apps, server side apps and applets?

right click -> Create Folder

ctrl + shift + N

File -> Create Folder

That's three ways to create a folder in Nautilus.. need a button for it?

not evil but ..

i was doing a gig where a lot of data validation
and conversion scripts were needed. Many were less
then 50 (working code not comments docs) lines of
perl.

i handed about a dozen of them to someone else to
do. he did them in Java.

some where run every time a file would show up in
a particular upload directory, some via a signal
from another process. some of those files would
show up a few per minute.

with java, the server cpu load went from a daily
max of 60% avg of 30% to a max of 100% and avg of
75%. RAM went through the roof, many times the
java processes would crap out mot having enough
memory.

i had to recode them myself, he refused to use
anything other the Java, it was against his religion
or something.

just venting ..

It's my understanding that you can program badly in any language,
What you needed to do was probably just fine in java, but the 
Developer just didn't optimize properly.

gcc packs (optionally) the 'gnu java compiler' aka gcj - which can be used to 
compile java. It doesn't support everything sun/blackdown does but it's free 
(as in OSS).

 From a design standpoint this is completely irrelevant: the compiler really 
should do the optimization for you - it knows best which data is duplicate and 
can be optimized, and it knows the subarchitecture better than the programmer.

Even better: the programmer should not need to know how to optimize code other 
than write ""decent"" code. Decent code is always good. Optimized code often 
compromises stability, readability and (funny enough) performance.

Some compilers are pretty smart but I'm not sure there's many of them 
that can make basic algorithm substitutions to correct for a 
programmer's bad choice (eg: replacing a hand-made bubble sort with a 
library version of quicksort)

totally agree poor programming can be done in any lang.

each instance took something like 32 or 64 MB, the server
was fully loaded with 256 MB :)

I cant remember what the (min/max was too long ago) just to load
the VM. at times there would be 20 or so running. I did not
know if you could have a vm shared or not, and it was back
in the 1.2 days as well so performance was not as good as i
have been told 1.4/5 is.

but just to read 200K lines of 50 chars of EBCDIC, convert to
ASCII, do a few if field x is not this or that, then write back
out to another file, it just seemed too much in resources.

i guess what got me the most was he got his 'religion' from
school, that java was the answer to all solutions, but that
is a whole other thread ..

Ok, but this is just not the sort of thing you do in Java.

Funny, the sort of thing that Java is "meant for" still runs faster in 
Perl with less code.

agree, qmail is not for the faint of heart once set up
great performance, number of users etc. (Was Hotmails
mta before uSoft, acutally was the mta for a long time
after uSoft bought hotmail) but not easy to get
configured, tuned etc.

That's an obvious design error, running multiple VMs like that.  Java is not
lightweight and not a scripting language.  Maybe your Java guy didn't
realize how his app' would be used.  A better solution would be to build it
as a daemon and have it check for new files itself, maybe spawn a thread for
each one.  But even as a Java coder, I think I'd have chosen a different
language for that sort of processing.

No, but it would be helpful if some of those had worked. I did

tried File > but there was no option to create a folder, not even

Considering all the issues you are having, how could you possibly say
that reiser is no faster than ext3 given the circumstances?  That is
kind of like racing a porsche down a road and in the process the road
gets torn asunder and then sending a GTO down the same path over
potholes and gaps and large chunks of asphalt everywhere and claiming
that the GTO is no faster than the porsche.

I'd say that if he has a recently new system with large L2 cache, a big fast 
disc with more cache, and isn't running some obscure benchmark test, he will 
not be able to point out the difference between ext3 and reiserfs.

Reiserfs is _not_ the end-all aweness of filesystems. It does a few things 
faster than ext3 (but please, which user really uses something intensive as 
git or deletes entire kernel trees every hour (such as me) and actually gets 
in the range where you would be able to spot the difference...). Ext3 in its 
turn does a few things faster than reiserfs too, and the differences are 
mostly not large.

car analogy: both the GTO and the porsche only go as fast as the traffic jam. 
The porsche however requires expensive european maintenance and a mechanic 
which is a jerk, whereas the GTO can be reassembled using two pliers and duck 
tape, and fits older carburator-engines without using a hacksaw. ;^)

cheers,

Auke

A friend of mine used the same analogy when defining to his superiors 
at a prior job[1] the difference between Oracle and Informix. :-)

   One smart entrepreneur came up with a line of duct tape named "Duck Tape."
I understand it outsells the other brands.

   Of course the OP might have been referring to an adhesive used to restrain
U of O students when they become too unruly.

   It's still too hot here at the west end of the Columbia River Gorge.

What I was reporting was simply how it performed for me on my computer
in my world. I noticed no difference. I know some people on this list
are maintaining servers that are being bombarded with disk read/writes
from users all day long. And some of you regularly copy gigs of data
from one place to the next. Reiserfs may be faster for you, then. Or
not. I don't know. I just know that in my world it made no difference
at all. And when I factor in the compatibility issue, it's a
no-brainer. It was not my intent to suggest that Reiserfs was no faster
than ext3 in all situations or for all users.

An interesting thing about duct tape is that, while it is great for a 
number of applications, sealing ducts is not one of them. It dries out 
too easily. For ducts, and also dryer vent hoses, aluminum tape is 
preferred.

My copy of choice, as it works in environments where there's a single 
user, or many users, is the following:

# find . | cpio -pdm /path/to/destination

If I'm doing a particularly long copy (like all the home directories on 
a server) I do something like this:

# cd /home
# for each in `ls`; do echo "processing $each"; find $each | cpio -pdm 
/path/to/destination; done

Works well, saves permissions and ownership, and works across many 
platforms.

   That might be the supermarket checkout line tabloid version, but it was
invented and used to seal air ducts in HVAC systems. Hence, the name duct
tape.

Haven't looked. I was thinking more along the lines of a standard DB
interface library (ODBC?), and an implementation of that interface which
simply created and used Berkeley-DBs.

I was more interested in worthy enough, to not get lumped with the people
who are afraid of Sendmail.

I'm going to have to dispute your assertion of "very secure" though. My
observation of the Debian security list has been that both Sendmail and
Postfix get bulletins around once every 9 months (often at nearly the
same time). During the same period Exim was averaging at least one
bulletin every 2-3 months, while Qmail didn't get any. I just looked at
that trend and wrote off Exim. Perhaps I should reevaluate it, but Qmail
still hasn't been hit and since I've switched that reputation still looks
good.

Actually Sealing duct work is one thing "duct tape" (the silver gray
fabic stuff) is not good for, the adhesive dries out and it falls off.
It was in fact invented during WWII, but for sealing Ammunition cans.
http://www.octanecreative.com/ducttape/duckvsduct.html

There is a different product which is an aluminum foil backed with
adhesive that is designed for sealing duct work.

<rant>

I think part of the problem is that the OO paradigm, as often being 
taught, actually supports and *encourages* poor coding practices (in 
terms of RAM and CPU load), in so many ways.

Rather than a developer being expected to be tightly coupled to the 
performance of the computer, and their program, programmers are 
encouraged to break tasks/jobs/data down into discrete, isolated, 
units, with their own protected memory spaces, in order to... well... 
do anything. Add in insane re-use models of using existing bloatware to 
avoid writing 10 lines (or less) of code ("load up a ginormous 128Kb 
library object to simply wrap an 6 letter XML tag around an item? Don't 
mind if I do!"), and it just gets uglier. (Sun/MS/Dell sells more 
hardware, yay!)

An example:....

What does good "religious" OO teach us? To use "nouns" (or members of a 
class), and to isolate those nouns! (I'm going to skip over this 
debate).

So, 200,000 lines... well, a line is one kind of noun, so maybe we need 
200,000 objects from our "line" class.

But then again, the pieces of *text* in those lines, if it represents 
something like a database field parameter, is another kind of noun, so 
if there are 10 different items in a line, that's then inherited (from 
line) class pieces, or 2,000,000 different objects to track in memory.

Since we don't want our properties for the first piece of a text 
object, as a child of a line object, at line 199,999, to interfere with 
any other lines or the existing line's text properties, we have to keep 
track of 2,000,000 different objects.

Of course, since each of those pieces of text may have any one of, oh, 
say, 10 properties, we need memory space for 20,000,000 variables. 
Assuming (LOL!) that each variable takes up *only* one 8-bit byte, 
that's 160,000,000 bits needed. 19531.25K. 19.07 *Megabytes*.

Now that we have our 20,000,000 object variables loaded in 19 Mb of 
RAM, cleanly isolated, we only need to test if one of the lines has a 
variable set to "foo".

*cough*

It may seem funny, but I have seen software written like this.  
Actually, is it fairly rare that I see OO software that *isn't* written 
like this, quite sadly. Maybe because the emphasis is on thinking about 
OO ideals (polymorphism, code maintenance), and not things endusers 
care about (speed, minimal footprints), I see it much more in lock-in 
industries, and code from the folks who never wrote to a target of 
256K(max) of RAM.

Please note that I did not say 256M.

Yeah! It's a Good Thing users don't care about maintenance...

In the end, I agree with most of what you said, but someone had to bite...

Message-ID: <200606280036.15839.bobby_miesen@yahoo.com>

Hi all.

	Here is my problem: I have a rather involved directory structure and I am 
going to be securing the server that this directory structure is on. One of 
the steps of establishing a security baseline is called "limiting", which is 
basically where you give everyone the least amount of privileges they need in 
order to do their work. I want to backup the permission and ownership 
settings for this directory structure before I harden everything so that way, 
if I blow something up badly, I don't have to reinstall everything to fix the 
problem. 
	I could tar it, but where's the fun in that if there is some command or 
utility that I could use to do this job so that way I can attack similar 
problems where tarring the directory structure to preserve permissions and 
ownership settings is impractical (a good example is the directory structure 
for the full gcc source code). 

	Does anyone know of such a tool? If not, who would be willing to join me in 
making such a tool someday (such as, say, next week)?

	Thanks in advance.

When your problems all look like nails, use rsync.  Or something like
that.  Rsync makes a wonderful hammer.

Assuming GNU tar, it can be a bit shorter than that:

  tar cC /source . | tar xC /destination

The lacking a -f switch, the default is to pipe to stdin and from 
stdout; the -C switch removes the need to cd to a directory.

I think -p is the default, though it assumes that root is performing 
the process.

I don't know what the advantage to -B is. Clues, anyone?

Again, Don't get me wrong.

I am not "Feverish" about Java, I enjoy it though.

Now, when I say "re-use" code, I am not thinking about
Taking code from one project and reusing it in another.

I actually have an advanced DOM that represents my documents
That I re-use over multiple JVM's, Servers and OS's.

Java simply provides me the cross-platform versatility
To do this.

Heck, they've often evolved even if you learned them in the 90s. :-)

In the past few weeks, some techie web site had an article about GNU 
grep's relatively new -o (--only-matching) option, which directs grep 
to "show only the patch of the matching line that matches PATTERN."

I'd stumbled across that option a year or two ago, and I too thought, 
"How many of those cool new additions haven't I encountered?"

Sigh.

   We used to build libraries for this purpose. I had a ton of C libraries for
database managment, mathematics, WIMP[1] creation, and more when I was
writing applications for DOS.

So, you want something like a tar archive without any file contents and 
then some way to re-apply that metadata?

rsync could do the trick, but can't be lightweight because hardlinks 
share ownership and permissions, so you would have to duplicate all of 
the files.  I'm assuming that you already have a backup and/or have 
other reasons (you mention reinstalling) to not backup the contents.

Sounds like you might have to roll your own with find/stat to do the 
info gathering and chmod, etc to re-apply.  Probably some tricky bits 
with hardlinks and symlinks too, so you might want to use device/inode 
numbers instead of (or as an additional check to) filenames.

A quick googling (snapshot file permissions) results in something like:
  http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/J/JO/JOHNKOEN/NAfixperms-v1.6.pl

Of course, you'll need 2 programs.  Maybe dump a YAML file between them.

Java is great for code reuse, whether you're building libraries as JARs or
simply compiling against shared code, it's straitforward and elegant.  If
code reuse is a myth, it's because of the bureaucracy of many software
shops, impeding the code's evolution across multiple projects--or simply
because programmers don't know to think in terms of reuse.  Maybe they don't
trust their colleagues' work, or maybe they're lazy in the wrong way.  ;)

But this, like bad programming in general, is not endemic to Java.

Assuming you want just the permissions and owners, and not the data itself,
you probably don't want to use the word "backup", which usually is defined
to include the data itself.

While it would be nice to have a magic utility that would allow you to
restore permissions in some undefined easy manner, you can capture the
information you want with a simple "ls -lR > ls_out".  If you need to
put the files back, you can do it by hand, or else build a perl script
(perhaps called "permrestore") that can read the ls_out file and put
things back.  Editing the list with a text editor would probably be
easier than adding some fancy selection process to permrestore. 
Chances are, the only way to design permrestore would be to go through
the manual process at least once, to learn what needs to be done.  And
once you have done it manually, you may not need the tool anymore.
Now you know why nobody has written one.

However, you probably should use tar or rsync or some other means
of backing up the whole thing, data and all.  Disk space is cheap,
and your futzing around with permissions will have a non-zero
possibility of losing data.  Rsync to another filesystem is
preferred, as it is easier to move individual files back.

   For some reason, acpid can no longer start on my notebook (running
Slackware-10.2). When I try /usr/sbin/acpid the response is that
/proc/acpi/events does not exist. I don't know why the /proc/acpi directory
is not being created on boot or why it stopped working.

   The file /etc/rc.d/rc.acpid exists and is called by /etc/rc.d/rc.M, the
main script that starts daemons in multiuser run level 3.

   Thoughts and suggestions of what to check or do will be gratefully
acknowledged.

Subject: [PLUG] Vgetty Help
Message-ID: <44A2FAAD.6080907@pacificscreening.com>

Hi,

I'm running into problems getting vgetty to function as an answering 
machine.  I've got a Creative ModemBlaster V.92 Serial DE5621 (Conexant 
chipset) on /dev/cuaa1.  This is a FreeBSD (5.4), so believe me that 
this is the modem device.

I'll call my number and the modem simply does not pick up.  Yes, init 
has vgetty running.

The modem reports to be a voice modem from minicom, so I know it has 
this capability (the box reports this as well).

I believe the crux of the problem is the init script in mgetty.conf, 
which is:

ATS0=0Q0&D3&C1

I've also tried changing it to

ATS0=1

The modem picks up on the first ring, but I get either a data or fax 
handshake signal from the modem.  Doesn't think it's in voice mode. 
I've no real skills in putting together an Hayes init string, so any 
help would be appreciated.

Here's my relevant configuration and log sample.

Thanks in advance for any pointers,
Robert

It doesn't help that QMail hasn't seen a release in nearly a decade.
(IPv6?  64-bit?  Updated standards?)

http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=qmail
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=postfix
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=exim
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=sendmail

You must be careful with these lists, since third-party apps are
included that are not actually part of the MTA itself, like Postgrey or
qmailadmin, and vendor-specific configuration problems, like Apple's
SMTP AUTH bungling.

I needed to do this at some point in the past and wrote a couple quick
little scripts.  They're not perfect; they'll fail if your files or
directories have a comma in the name (RCS files?):

http://haus.nakedape.cc/svn/public/trunk/small-projects/sys-utils/dump-perms
http://haus.nakedape.cc/svn/public/trunk/small-projects/sys-utils/restore-perms

If you need something like that, I could probably be induced to write
something a more robust.

An example that is a variation on dump-perm.  It uses tabs as the  
field separator and numbers for the uid and gid:

$ find /bin/ -printf "%p\t%m\t%U\t%G\n" | tee file.list.txt | head
/bin/   755     0       0
/bin/cat        755     0       0
/bin/stty       755     0       0
/bin/fgrep      777     0       0
/bin/uname      755     0       0
/bin/df 755     0       0
/bin/date       755     0       0
/bin/tcsh       755     0       0
/bin/ed 755     0       0
/bin/mv 755     0       0

... and a variation on restore-perms using tab as the field  
separator.  It also handles symlinks:

cat file.list.txt | while IFS=$'\t' read file mode uid gid ; do
   echo chown $uid:$gid $file
   [ -L $file ] && continue
   echo chmod $mode $file
done

Remove the echo to make it live, or pipe it into a shell.

Thanks, Wil. That's what I was getting at. The postfix CVEs for the
last three years all reference either 3rd-party patches/addons (the
ipv6 open relay bug and postgrey) or vendor config problems.

When Elliot implies Sendmail is roughly as secure as Postfix, my
Spidey-Sense starts tingling.

Am I the only one who doesn't get how or where the Portland Project fits 
in with LSB, Freedesktop.org, the Free Standards Group, and Gnome and 
KDE?  I can't figure out if it is superfluous, competing, complementary, 
or just confusing.  Well, it confuses me, anyway.

Hmmm...what version of Nautilus is Dapper using?

On my install (Debian Etch) of Nautilus 2.14.1:

1)  The first item in the File drop down menu is "Create Folder" 
(Shift+Ctrl+N), in spatial mode.  In browser mode, it's the second item.
2)  The first item that appears in the menu that pops-up when I 
right-click on any empty space in a Nautilus window is "Create Folder".

Note that if an existing folder or file is highlighted, the right-click 
menu is different and does not contain an option to create a folder.  
Nautilus assumes, if you have a file or folder highlighted, you want to 
perform an operation on that file or folder, not make a new one.

I can't imagine why Dapper would've removed these options.

Sure, but I count those as RCS files (which they are, technically).

Take a look at http://www.debian.org/, those were rough estimates based
on a longish term of observation. I wasn't being precise, merely
estimating.

Does one's MTA really need more than 2GB of memory? There is an actively
maintained patch for IPv6 functionality.

These folks were mentioned on Slashdot:

http://www.sourcelabs.com/

They have a new system for automated Linux support, the Continuous
Support System.  It does things like running automated diagnostic
probes on client machines, pattern matching errors to a large
database, automated pre-emptive maintenance, and other things that
should greatly enhance the reliability of Linux for their customers.  

If they pull this off, it will be the Next Big Thing.  Because it
is rooted in open source, it will be impossible for M$ to counter.

SourceLabs is located in Seattle.  This is good, because when they
put M$ out of business, there will be local jobs for those M$ 
software engineers who are adaptable and mostly undamaged.

Perhaps we can get SourceLabs to give a presentation down here.

PS: with Ward Cunningham leaving M$ for Eclipse, Vista delays, SCO
getting whipped in court ( most Linux-related claims were thrown
out today, see www.groklaw.org ), the Portland Project for desktop
Linux,  and Scott Kveton working on OpenID, a lot of very cool
things are happening.  Smile, dammit!

Problem:
I want to install an application. I do not care what desktop 
environment a user has, I just want the user to be able to launch it 
from a desktop menu. How do I populate the menu for fvwm, kde, gnome, 
fvwm95, (blah blah) menu with one programming statement?

Problem:
I want to enable a user to click on a URI, and launch their web browser 
(email client, preferred RSS reader etc.). I do not care, or want to 
care, what desktop environment a user has, or what they have open. 
Thus, if a user has a pine session open to another machine, and the 
user has a URI, how do I make the user's preferred web page viewer 
*open* and load that URI when that user clicks on a URI in pine?

As I understand their code, they are a "glue" project. If a user wants 
a Konqueror browser window to launch when they click on a URL in an 
gnome session email(!)... make that happen, by adding "glue" code to 
the app that reads the email. If an app wants to bring up a "print" 
window, it shouldn't have to care what UI it has.

Sounds ambitious.

inkscape can run whatever program you want for printing.  I like to have 
a nice preview of the postscript.  Now if I could only get mozilla and 
everything else to do that by setting my preference in one place.

In other words, it was based on vague impressions rather than facts.
How about reviewing it yourself and working with facts?  There have been
2 Debian security advisories for Postfix in the past decade; the first
happened only in what seems to me to be obscure configuration and the
latter is somewhat nasty.  That hardly qualifies as once every 9 months.
Exim has had more, and one as recent as last year potentially allowed
remote code execution.

No, you probably don't need more than 2GB of memory, but you might want
to compile 64-bit because everything else does and you don't want to
make special exceptions or to gain whatever performance improves it
might bring.  Yes, "actively maintained patches" are the mainstay of
QMail, aren't they?  Since DJB seems to have abandoned it and his nutty
license isn't free software, that's about the best anyone can do.  And
those two were just two examples...  It's not as if the mail handling
world has stood still since 1998.
  o RFCs 821 and 822 have been replaced by updated RFCs 2821 and 2822
(2001).
  o RFC 1891 replaced by 3461 and updated by a couple more.
  o Unicode, i18n and l10n have become widespread and standardized.  
  o SSL/TLS (SSL is easy to wrap, but TLS is another story)
  o SMTP AUTH
  o Directory and database-based routing (yet another patch?)

There's probably a lot of other stuff I'm neglecting to mention.

I think the current trend is towards a library layer to implement
printing.  It's not terribly unusual for applications to need more
control over printing than is reasonable with a command-pipe.

Similarly weird thing lappened on my lapdog.  ACPId just stopped
loading.  Went into BIOS setup, and the "OS supports Plug & Play" option
was blank, instead of saying Yes or No.  Set it to No (or Yes, didn't
matter) and ACPI started working again.  Dang cosmic rays.

   Unfortunately, I don't have the excuse of heat wave, cosmic rays, flooding
in New Joisey, or anything else. I was running the stock 2.4.31 kernel
installed with the distribution upgrade, and while apm was turned on, acpi
was not built and included. Sigh. User error. Mea culpa!

   I'm just about done building the modules now for the 2.4.32 kernel. Will
get that installed, reconfigure lilo (and source it), and I suspect that
acpid will load and run.

Thanks, Aaron,

Rich

They are now. In Windows they were always directories too, until
Microsoft purloined the term from Apple. Apple probably stole it from
someone else before them, too. But Apple is as far back as my memory
goes. Personally, I'd rather just call 'em pigeonholes.

Both Apple and MS hired guru's from Xerox Palo Alto Research Center,

   I'm looking for the most efficient way to backup the /home directory of a
user from a laptop to the desktop -- automagically via a cron job.

   I could export the ~/ on the laptop, then mount it on the desktop so that
it's included in the daily incremental and weekly full backups. Is this the
most parsimonious solution?

IIRC: The Alto had a "GUI window", not "windows".

For comparison, Alto showed several directories, in a GUI window.

*A* GUI window.

Not windows, which could do things like move around, and overlap each 
other.

Rich:

Incrementals help in the case of accidental deletions, but other than
that, I don't see much use for them. A full dump in multiple places
should be fine. If you're trying to save space, I guess bzip'd
incrementals makes some sense. And restores are a lot easier if you're
only dealing with full dumps :)

I have an rsync script in my laptop's homedir, and I just run it every
once in a while. I have it detect where I am, so I can backup to
different desktops (work and home). It normally runs in just a few
seconds, since most of the data rarely changes.

That works for me, anyway.

Subject: [PLUG] Dual head, different depth
Message-ID: <20060630075811.GA7109@gate.kl-ic.com>


I just installed an old Matrox dual head G400 card in a Fedora Core
1 machine, and brought up two screens.  Now I want to try something
"clever", which is bring up Screen 1 as depth 24 and Screen 2 as
depth 8 (screen 2 will be talking to some poorly written CAD software).

When I fiddle with the Xconfig, and set Screen 2 default depth and
display depth to 8 planes, X crashes, while other combinations 
bring up Screen 1 but do not bring up Screen 2.  Before I get deep into 
debugging this, does anyone know whether it is possible to run dual
head with two different depths, or is this not supported?

I'm pretty sure I did it, Keith, but you have to turn off Xinerama.

And recall that the G400 doesn't have the same capabilities on both heads, 
so be sure to use Head 2 for the 8-bit display so's you don't short-change 
yourself.

Charlie,

   I run incremental backups Monday-Thursday nights (actually, Tuesday-Friday
mornings at 1:30 am) on the system, and a full backup starting at 10:30 pm
Fridays. I've been doing this for years and it makes sense to back up that
laptop, too.

   The suggestion sent to me off the list that seems to be the most simple and
useful is to buy a small USB thumb and write a shell script that will tar and
copy that ~/ to the device. Then I can bring it to the main
server/workstation and put another copy on that. For once a week or so, that
will do well.

Thanks,

Rich

Sounds familiar.  IIRC, you can just remove the 'Option "Xinerama" true' 
line.  That means no dragging windows between monitors though (and I 
think you then get two taskbars, etc), but you can still move your 
mouse to the second monitor.

Maybe you just want to run in over vnc to localhost?

A link that comes to mind (though I haven't tried it either.)

Yeah. The second DAC is pretty lame on that card.  (Which is sad 
considering...)

I have one of those in my desk at work.  (Need to remember to take it 
home. I bought it years ago with a Rainbow Runner video capture card.)

The default directory on a remote machine is your home, so you are
missing a / after the ':'.  As in:

  $ rsync -avz pachy:/home/<user>/ .
                     
The command you used was trying to copy the remote
/home/<user>/home/<user> to your cwd.

Or, if the user running the command is <user>, then just:

  $ rsync -avz pachy:. . 

should work.

   I see. Using scp I don't use the leading forward slash, but I'm also
copying from my home directory on the remote machine. That certainly makes a
big difference.

Thanks,

   Ah, that makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the clarification, Russell.

Subject: [PLUG] Router address or DNS address? Dumbass question
Message-ID: <20060630215739.d650a7a9.johnxj@comcast.net>

All the time I used Breezy-64 I had Firefox installed in 32-bit chroot and had to relink the DNS entries in /etc/resolv.conf from the 64-bit world every time I changed locations. If I opened System > Administration > Networking and clicked on the DNS tab, there would be the DNS addresses. If they were wrong for the current location, I wasn't goin' nowhere until they were fixed. E.g., Comcast at home, pub.net at PSU, etc.

Then I installed Dapper-64. Afterwards I found that the DNS tab listed the address of my router at home (192.168.1.100). Yet I was able to go anywhere even though the addresses for the Comcast DNS servers were not listed. Note that with Dapper I no longer need the 32-bit chroot environment, because Flash, Adobe Reader and RealPlayer all work now without it. (Adobe Reader works standalone; still struggling to get a PDF viewer working in Firefox. Evince?)

What I don't understand is why I could go anywhere with just the router address. I suspect that's a real dumbass question that will make the gurus here laugh hysterically, but I have never understood much about how these things work. 

Today I went to PSU to test the wireless. It worked fine. When I came home I couldn't go anywhere very well. Some sites would work, some would load a stange looking page. Checking the DNS entries for Ethernet connection, there were the DNS entries for pub.net at PSU. Surprising I was able to go anywhere at all. So it must have replaced the address of my router with the PSU DNS server addresses when I connected there. OK, fine. So I changed the PSU DNS server addresses back to my router adddress, which had been working up till then. Afterwards I couldn't go anywhere at all. Now it needs the actual Comcast server addresses.

I'm very confused, and google is not helping a bit. It makes sense that it would require the correct DNS server addresses for the service I am connected to. What I don't grasp is why the router address was fine for several days. And why it is no longer is enough. And (bottom) line, how to get this working without having to open System > Administration > Networking every time I change location.

Also, when I connected to pub.net at PSU it automatically replaced the DNS entries, as it always did before as well. But when I came home and connected to Comcast, it did not replace the pub.net DNS server addresses with the Comcast DNS server addresses. Why? I mean, when I connect, *something* goes out and finds the DNS server addresses. Except that it doesn't do it for Comcast. (I must add that in both the Wireless and the Ethernet connections, clicking on "Properties" reveals that both are set to DHCP.)

Hopelessly confused.

The latter is a subroutine I'm trying to write in perl that isn't doing what

I understand that a hash can be created from an array according to A Little

the problem down further.
