Subject: [PLUG] VMWare question: How to start vmware guests automatically
Message-ID: <eac729460703010104o221675a4odc3949eee4359980@mail.gmail.com>

I have VMWare Workstation 5.x up and running.
It works great, but I have always used it interactively.
Is there a way to start vmware guest machines automatically
at system boot or from a crontab or whatever?
Do I need to install VMWare server for this?

Yeah this is a vmware server feature. But of course you can get server
for free, if you want. -- Andy

   Yesterday's secure log shows entries like this:

   I do not recall having seen an /etc/environment or /etc/session before.
How do I identity why PAM is trying to access them?

   My reboot yesterday lost sound capabilities. While I wait for a reply to
my post to the alsa mail list, I hope someone here can explain why I cannot
load the snd_intel8x0.ko module.

[root at salmo /lib/modules/2.6.19.2/kernel/sound/pci]# modprobe
./snd-intel8x0.ko 
FATAL: Module ./snd_intel8x0.ko not found.

   This module was built with the kernel, and I'm telling modprobe just where
it is, so why cannot modprobe find it?

As Andy mentioned, this is a VMware server feature, however VMware
Workstation 6 (which is currently in Free Beta) can run VM's "disconnected",
which is effectively the same. It should be trivial to script up something
to start them automatically using the "vmrun" command. FWIW, I've been using
the 6 beta since it's first release, and have had no problems.

   Same failure if I copy the module to snd_ from snd-.

Look at the debian package hwinfo.  I think this will give you
everything you are a looking for.....

Still doesn't work. I just get Command Not Found. But now it's morning
and I'm thinking more clearly. I'm wondering if there might be
something else that would be easier. 

To reiterate the problem: Everything on my Edgy amd64 installation
works just fine except OOo. Unfotunately, I *live* in OOo. There are
three basic problems: Drag and drop editing of text does not work, the
web page wizard crashes OOo, and features set in Tools > Options are
not being saved to the default template. The latter is especially
annoying because every time I open a document I have to go into Tools >
Options and change the settings, and as soon as I save, close and
reopen the document I have to do it all over again. I have been
struggling with this since December. I have at least 50 hours invested
in trying to fix this and probably twice that much.

The only version available in the Edgy amd64 repositories is 2.0.4. I
did manage to install 2.1, but the problems did not go away. I also
used the Edgy live/install 32-bit CD and OOo worked fine, but when I
used the 64-bit live/install CD the problems were still there. Since
the problems also occur with the 64-bit live/install CD, I conclude
that I can stop fiddling with my installation of OOo 2.0.4 and I can
stop trying to fix something in my Edgy installation. If it is still
broken when using the 64-bit live/install CD, then there must be
something conflicting with my hardware with 64-bit Edgy. There are a
few others who have the same problem and I wanted to have them all tell
me about their hardware so I could look for commonalities. Hence, my
search for a command that would get me a list of all their hardware.

But after sleeping on it I am now thinking in a different direction.
Back in the days of Breezy I used a 32-bit chroot environment to run
Firefox and Adobe Reader. When Dapper came out I was able to get both
working acceptably in the 64-bit world, so I got rid of the 32-bit
chroot environment. Maybe I should set a 32-bit chroot environment back
up again and install OOo in it. I'm assuming that this will fix the
problem because OOo runs fine from the 32-bit live/install CD.

I also thought about just installing 32bit OOo with
--force-architecture. I'm not sure that can be done -- it's a pretty
big program that comes with a lot of different .debs. Plus, I think the
current OOo 2.0.4 actually is the 32-bit OOo, Ubuntu-ized to run in
64-bit Edgy. 

I can also set up a chroot to run Dapper, either 32- or 64-bit (there
is a how-to on Ubuntu forums). 

The reason I am now thinking along these lines is that, even assuming
the others who have been bitten by this bug and I can manage to isolate
whatever is causing the problem, it will probably require a fix from
Ubuntu, and by the time that is available Feisty will have been
released. In fact, Ubuntu probably won't even bother to fix Edgy. I
filed a bug report
(https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openoffice.org-amd64/+bug/85248)
on February 15 and no one at Ubuntu has even bothered to reply or
assign it to anyone. 

I am open to any suggestions. Maybe someone can think of something even
simpler that will do as well.

I don't see an /etc/session mentioned in the log messages above.  You
might start by looking at the documentation for pam_env, which should be
part of the main PAM package.

you'll definately need version 2. version 1 is outdated for about 2 years now. 
Should be relatively easy to compile from source.

Hello all,

  We are looking for folks from local companies that are currently supporting Asterisk telephony systems to come and speak at our OTA conference in May about open source telephony and Asterisk.  
  OTA Oregon Technology Alliance is going to be hosting a full day open source conference in May and would like to invite anyone who would be interested. For dates and location information please see the OTA website at: http://www.oregontechnologyalliance.org/ 
  It is my understanding that it will be held in Salem but I haven't seen any more detail on their site yet.
  Anyone interested in speaking about Asterisk please email me ASAP with your experience and what specific Asterisk topics you would feel comfortable speaking to.
  Thanks in advance for your help.

Wil,

   That's because I copied the incorrect line.

   There's a /etc/security/pam_env.conf. So I created /etc/environment with a
couple of default values for PAGER and PATH. We'll see if that makes the
kernel happy.

Thanks,

   Red herring: the modprobe man page says that underscore is equivalent to
hyphen.

   However, looking for the module in dmesg reveals the problem:

David didn't inidcate whether or not he was wanting a machine to be running
as a "server", only that he wanted it to start automatically and he already
had workstation installed and running. Your point is well taken though, and
for many people, using server when you need a vm to start at boot is the
right answer. However workstation has some advantages over server in some
situations:

-Better interactive performance - This is according to VMware support
directly.
-Support for multiple snapshots - server can only do one at a time.
-Clone a VM - This can be relatively easily done by hand, but the
workstation UI makes it completely brainless
-VM Teaming - Tremendously useful for setting up complex test environments,
even if they are "server" class.
-Support for multiple monitors (6 beta only)
-Support for USB 2.0 at full speed (6 beta only)

So, Workstation is targetted squarely at testing / development and server at
production. However, it's entirely possible that some production needs would
require the use of Workstation (or moving up to ESX) or that testing needs
could be met by server.

I think that you just give the name of the module to modprobe, and it
looks for it in
/lib/modules/loaded-kernel/.

Did you perhaps boot into a new kernel, for which the snd module has
not been built?

Or if it is in the tree, try modprobing it again, leaving off the './'.

Ali, et al.:

   No, it's the same 2.6.19.2 since January. For whatever the reason, the
kernel .config file did not have SND-INTEL8X0 set to module. So, I changed
that, rebuilt and reinstalled modules, and modprobe then loaded
snd-intel8x0.

   Ran alsaconf and it found the chip, made sure everything was installed and
running, then told me to go have fun after adjusting sound with my favorite
mixer. Well, it's back to the ALSA wiki troubleshooting page because aumix
won't load and alsamixer shows nothing but the header. Progress, but not yet
all there.

Thanks,

Rich

A couple comments:

(1)  Actually, VMWare Server is free - free as in no cost - not free
as in freedom.
      See: http://www.vmware.com/products/free_virtualization.html for details.

(2)  VMWare workstation costs money.
      I own a copy or two of VMWare workstation 5.x
      I should try VMWare workstation 6.0 beta.  I have not.

(3)  VMWare workstation will do a lot that VMWare Server won't do.
      Thus, I'm using VMWare workstation.
      Unfortunately, the documentation says you can NOT run workstation
      and server on the same computer, and the command line interface
      for VMWare Workstation stinks.  (Or maybe I don't understand
      it's features.)

(4)  Mostly, I use VMWare to run Linux under Linux
      I haven't quite figured networking out for Xen yet.
      Xen seems to work great, but there doesn't seem to be an easy
      strait forward way of creating Xen virtual machines.
      Eventually, I intend to use VMWare to create Xen virtual
      machines as needed and use Xen to run these.
      In the mean time, I'm using VMWare on one machine for everything
      and that is why I would like my VMWare guests to start automatically
      on boot.

Try adding, to the bottom of /var/lib/postgres/data/pg_hba.conf:
local all all trust

If that works, you should then change to more restricted 'trust' (for
security purposes), etc.

Jon,

   Tom Lane identified the problem. The network socket in /tmp was owned by
root.root instead of by postgres.users.

   I learned that I could remove that file after stopping the postmaster, and
that it was recreated properly when the postmaster was restarted. That fixed
the problem. I had no idea that I could safely wipe out that socket file;
that's why I didn't touch it until told it was a good thing to do.

Thanks,

Rich

Like what?  I gave up Workstation 5.5 when Server came out exactly so I
could have headless VMs and I haven't noticed anything missing.

I think that's probably right.  You can, however, run VMWare under
VMWare... I ran Workstation 4 in a Linux VM recently to create a VM that
our older ESX version could import.  I think newer versions of ESX are
expressly supporting running within a VM, so you can do training,
testing and development of ESX itself.

Wil,

   What's involved in moving from Workstation-5.5 to Server without losing
the guest OS, applications, and data?

I have.  It is SLOW.  The debugging information in the code slows it down 
to a crawl.  It is useful only if you need to see if something will work. 
It is not good for casual use.

What do you find useful that Workstation does that server does not?

I have not done Xen yet.  I had some bad problems with it in 64 bit a 
while back.  I have not gone back to see if they have been fixed or not.

I use VMWare for two things right now.

I run FC6 under VMWare on WinXP so I don't have to use XP for most things.

I run Win2k under it for one piece of software that is Windows only and I 
did not have the time to make work under Wine.  (i.e I wanted to get my 
taxes done and over with.)

If I can find a good reason for getting Workstation, I plan on getting it. 
VMWare has been very useful to me so far.

The last VM I created under Workstation worked fine when I moved it to 
Server.  It complained about an outdated version of VMWare tools.  I just 
reinstalled that after the VM came up.

I have moved VMs from Workstation to Server to runtime with no problems.

If you need something cheap, I seem to remember that CTL sells laptops with
no OS installed.

   Thanks, Alan. Next time I need to upgrade, that's how I'll do it.

I can recommend CTL laptops for Linux compatibility, though at least from
what I can see they don't sell them without Windows.  Perhaps if you ask
their salescritters directly.  Its not an option on the website.
http://www.ctlnotebooks.com/v2/default.aspx

I have a laptop not from CTL but from the OEM that they use, Compal (one of
the big 3 OEMs- Compal, Clevo, Quanta, that actually manufacture about 95%
of all laptops).
See here for handy reference: http://tuxmobil.org/laptop_oem.html
(poke around the rest of Tuxmobil of you haven't before, handy site)

I have a CL50 bought a couple years ago, currently runs Ubuntu and WinXP,
works like a champ, all hardware works with Linux.  The CL50 is sold by CTL
as Travel Master NB5500.  It is the exact same unit, as the company I work
for uses CTL laptops.  I have been issued a CTL version of the CL56 for work
use, I think they call it TravelMaster NB5600.  Some colleagues have been
issued the CL50. CL56 is almost identical to the CL50 except for color
scheme and better video card (Radeon Mobility 9700 with 128M VRAM).  I have
booted Knoppix with it so far and it all works.  I am seriously considering
repartitioning it and putting Ubuntu on this along side the required Win2K
(it will most likely be reimaged once I turn it back in anyway).  Though I
can't speak for the newer models, as far as the CL50 and CL56 based models
they work with Linux no problem, smooth as melted butter.

I haven't run VMWare for a while because it doesn't work on the low power
boxes I currently use, however, I was able to make version three and
possibly four (I don't remember) of their workstation platform provide
every significant feature of their server version when running on a Linux
host by writing some rather complex shell scripts.  This included bringing
up a full virtual network with half a dozen virtual machines automatically
on bootup of the host computer.

I did a writeup of some of my findings and posted it here (I'm not sure if
it has what you need, but it might give you a start):

   http://www.deatech.com/deatech/articles/vc_tips.html

I might be able to give you some help when I get back into the USA at the
end of March.

Rich,

I just got through the fun of getting my sound back working after
updating my kernel in FC5. Everyonce in a while the updates go just
fine, but this time gmplayer played RocketBoom.com just fine but my
realplayer playing Radio Paradise was silent.  It connected just fine
and looked like it was playing just fine.  But no sound.  I opened kmix
and discovered that realplay was connected to my on motherboard sound
card while I could choose my alsa sound for the gmplayer.  

After much hunting, I discovered a file called /etc/asound.conf.  This
was setup originally like this:
#Generated by system-config-soundcard, do not edit by hand
#SWCONF
#DEV 0
defaults.pcm.card 1
defaults.pcm.device 0
defaults.ctl.card 1

Note the '0' on the pcm.device line.  Went against the admonition and
editted the file by hand and changed the 0 to 1.  Rebooted and realplay
is playing Radio Paradise again.

May not help you a bit, Rich, but I am happier,
now.

Ken,

   In my case there were seveal factors that contributed to the problem. The
first was that snd-intel8x0.ko was trashed internally. That's why it
wouldn't load. After 'make modules; make modules_installed', it loaded just
fine, but after the snd-usb-audio. Since USB sound has no mixer support (or
minimal at best), neither aumix nor alsamixer would run.

   The second factor was that I had managed to build the 2.6.19.2 kernel
without the ability to rmmod. Can't explain why, but that's what I did.
Ergo, could not remove the sound modules and reinstall them in the proper
order. 'make; make modules; make modules_install;' move files to /boot, run
/sbin/lilo just in case, and a reboot fixed that problem.

   The third factor was sound modules still in the incorrect sequence.
Manually removed them all -- starting with the nVIDIA ones with the most
dependencies and working my way down the list -- followed by 'modprobe
snd-intel8x0' and 'modprobe snd-usb-audio'. Et voila! Eet woiked again.
Curiously, I had to increase the levels of all channels in alsamixer as well
as the pgm channel in aumix to bring the sound to a sufficiently high level.

> After much hunting, I discovered a file called /etc/asound.conf.  This

   I have an alsa-generated file (with warnings to not touch) in
/etc/modules.conf. However, the modules to be loaded area apparently the
ones in /etc/modprobe.d/sound. A Swiss fellow on the alsa mail list
recommeded that I modify that file (which had only the nVIDIA drivers, the
same as in /etc/modules.conf) to the following:

alias snd-card-0 snd-intel8x0
options snd-intel8x0 index=0
alias snd-card-1 snd-usb-audio
options snd-usb-audio index=1

alias sound-slot-0 snd-card-0
alias sound-slot-1 snd-card-1

   That, he assures me, will keep them in the proper order the next time I
reboot after a kernel change.

Thanks for your input,

Rich

I don't have experience with that particular model, but I have worked with
other Brother laser printers. They worked fine with CUPS printing system,
and overall I'd rate them as "passable". They were a little slow-ish, and
their output was ok, but not great. They were good enough for what we paid
for them, and good enough for home / very small biz use, but I think if I
had owned them personally, I would have eventually wished I'd spent a little
more money and gotten something a little nicer.

The speed shouldn't be a problem for me. I currently have a Brother
HL-730DX. I haven't had the time to figure out why I can't get my Linux
machine to see the parallel port, so I've only used it with 98SE and XP.
On a new drum, it works well. Eventually - after a year or more - the
drum wears out. Unfortunately, that drum is no longer available from the
usual sources, and so there are extra marks on the page due to the
scratches on the drum.

Since I am now in need of a fax machine, and I don't do production
amounts of printing, I figured a multi-function fax/printer would be a
good solution.

As business picks up, I may decide I need a better printer. At that
time, the 7820N will still be a good fax machine. And for now, this
looks like a reasonable approach.

The 7820N doesn't warm up quickly, but it's not a horrible wait unless
you're extremely impatient (10-12 seconds average). The printing is VERY
fast; I don't the the 20ppm rating is an exaggeration.

Text quality is fine (not spectacular, but you have to look hard to find
jaggies), and the graphics quality is closer to what I would call
'passable'; not bad but not great either.

For the price and considering that Brother supports Linux so well, I'm
very happy with mine.

Glad to hear it. I expect most of the important printing I'll do will be

Subject: [PLUG] bind9 on low-spec machine?
Message-ID: <200703031229.05494.ewilhelm@cpan.org>

Hi all,

I've been happily running bind for local nameservices+caching on a 
300MHz k7 with 256MB ram for a couple of years now.  Recently, I've 
been migrating that machine's (fileserver, etc) services to a much 
faster box, but I decided to try DNS on a much lower-powered box (which 
is a failover webserver, etc and rarely gets shutdown.)  The box in 
question is a pentium 133MHz with 128MB ram.  Both machines are running 
sarge.

Now dns queries are extremely slow.  It looks like the box isn't 
swapping, but I haven't got the first clue about diagnosing a bind 
performance issue.  Is it cpu bound?  Something just plain weird with 
this old machine?  The other odd thing is that if I turn off the local 
nameservices (and use just caching), the speed comes back.  Do I just 
have a braindead dns setup (and the faster machine is able to gloss 
over my idiocy?)  Note that I don't claim to know what I'm doing since 
RTFM'ing doesn't seem to be doing me any good here.

Any suggestions?  Should I be looking for a different server daemon?  
What are the embedded linux routers and such running for dns?

Eric-
You can set the debug level to 255 which will log EVERYTHING but might be
useful in telling you whats wrong. You can play with the debug levels to get
what you want. When the machine is running slow do you see an increase in
load on the box? What version are you running? How many zones are you
loading? Bind loads the config data and zones into memory at startup so if
you're loading a bunch of zones @ 128 MB of RAM it would make sense that it
speeds back up when you go to a caching only setup.

FWIW, embedded linux routers typically use dnsmasq (which does both
dns and dhcp, if so configured).

I have the problem of filtering out cialis and not filtering out

Having owned and upgraded VMWare Workstation since it came out,
it's hard for me to understand why I'd want to use it in preference
to VMWare Server to use as a SERVER, when VMWare Server is free.

You can still build and test your virtual machine(s) using the desktop 
product and then just copy them over to your server (or to VMWare Player), 
if you want. I don't really see any big advantages of Desktop versus
Server yet.

We are currently in the process of virtualizing all our Windows servers.
I rolled out the first one on Tuesday. We will have a development server
running Debian and VMWare Server and a fileserver running Debian and 
Samba. Hardware is dual core dual Xeon 3 Ghz + 4 GB ram + SATA drives.

We run Windows operating systems on servers to allow us to develop
software using ESRI and Oracle products. (Yes, there are Linux
versions of those products but our clients run Windows and IIS.)

We have enough developers and projects now that it was no longer
practical for us to have just one Windows development server. By
virtualizing instead of adding more servers, we can copy an existing
server, upgrade it, and keep the old own filed away for legcay testing
and updates and move on with the new one. The machine is big enough to
run several machines so one developer can be doing legcacy support
while another is testing out the newest release on a separate server.

With the server version of VMWare you can run a console app under X11
on the server or you can run a client on either a Windows or Linux
desktop. There is also a web thing that can do some basic things like
control the VMware daemon itself and tell you what machines are
running. I prefer not to run X11 on my servers so we are using the
Windows client. Generally no one wants to sit near the servers anyway.
Too noisy and cramped.

VMWare is not officially supported on Debian but it works fine. I had
to build a kernel for our configuration so I had to apply a patch to 
VMware to get its modules to build correctly. (This would be true for
any machine running the latest kernel.)

I am looking forward to playing with the perl VMWare Server API. No idea
yet what it can do.

BTW we have a machine running Asterisk and Debian as our office phone
system now too. Saved us a bundle.

Let's try this again since I found my initial email in my own filter 
trap, I assume that it went into most of yours as well.

OK, one more time, here's the deal.

I am using postfix body_checks to filter out some special stuff that was 
getting through spamassassin.  There is a drug who's name I can't type 
here or this will get filtered, that name is contained in the word 
"specialist" (remove the first 3 letters and the last one).  I want to 
filter out that drug name and not filter out the word "specialist" using 
body_checks and regular expressions.

Scoured the internets to no avail.

Need help as I am not a regexp guy.

Frank,

   The messages must pass your postfix filters before they're handed off to
spamassassin, not the other way around.

   It does get tricky to trap those specific strings and not when they're
embedded in legitimate words. I have three suggestions for you:

   1) Use the \b symbol to denote the beginning and ending of a word. For
example, your body_checks might contain a line like this
/\b damn \b/		reject 550 Rule B1023

This tells postfix to look for that string of four characters as a single
word set off by white space on either side, and not embedded within another
word. Several years ago I was advised to number each header_check and
body_check rule (thanks, Ed!!) and it makes it so much easier to trace the
rule that triggerd a rejection.

   2) Get a copy of 20_drugs.cf (there are references on the spamassassin
mail list archives) and put it in /usr/share/spamassassin.

   3) Sign on to both the postfix and spamassassin mail lists for a while.
While they're high volume, you'll learn a lot, find answers to almost all of
your questions, and will receive answers to questions you pose.

   A couple of months ago I upgraded my system and for some reason was
overwhelmed with spam. A weeks' worth of time on the maillists, and some
questions for clarification, and my spam-blocking was much more finely
tuned. On average I see 0-5 spam per day now.

Okay, I'm trying to test out Exult on what it was originally written to run
Ultima 7 on, gnome on top of Fedora Core 1.

I have a 100% Sound Blaster 16 from Creative, an ISA sound card circa 1995.
This is not the 32 bit or AWE gold version.

Sound card detection doesn't detect it.  I can't find isapnptools, they
don't seem to exist as a standard package.  I can manually load the sb
module, but I can't get any music playback.  Imagine how strange it is
when you are playing along and suddenly you hear speech.

I can get music playback using exult in 98SE with this card.

Do I need to install alsa?

What should go into modprobe.conf?

In gnome, I'm running into this error a lot:

Couldn't open mixer device /dev/sound/mixer

I can play ogg files using xmms no problem.

It's as if the midi part of the sound card isn't activating.

Does Fedora not have isapnptools?  I only see it as a standard option
in my Redhat archives for Redhat 6.2.  Slackware 10.1 offers it.

Rich,
Thanks for the hint.  I was, as it turns out, pretty close but my test 
case was bogus.  I will take your suggestion and join the mail lists for 
a while - more brains to pick.

As for effectiveness of my filtration, I had to change my primary email 
address last December because it was so compromised.  I was CATCHING 
250-400 spams per day 1 or 2% were getting through which is quite a few 
with that volume.  Now, I get pretty much no spam.  The drug spams in 
question are coming through a cgi script on my system for webmaster 
feedback.  Not sure what to do about that yet.  I catch them all but the 
fact that they are coming in at all is of concern.

Thanks again . . .

You'll probably have much better luck with a more recent version of 
Fedora.  Does it have to be FC1?  I believe with FC1 you may have to 
compile and install ALSA which you won't need to do with a later version 
of Fedora.

Is there a way to change the behavior of the <ENTER> key in OOcalc?

In Excel, if one tabs from column to column while entering data and then
 hits <ENTER>, the active cell becomes the cell below the one from which
tabbing began. In OOcalc, <ENTER> just moves you to the cell below the
one you were on when you hit <ENTER>.

If modifications such as this are possible, I assume there is some place
in the OO documentation to describe the process. I'll be happy to read
the manual, but I don't know what to call what I want to do.

Dick,

   Tools -> Options -> OOcalc.

   Input settings -> top checkbox "Press Enter to move selection;" the drop
down box to the right defaults (here) to "Down." Other choices are "Up,",
"Right," "Left."

That's something, but not enough. I want "Down" and "Left to the column
I started in on the last line". Maybe I'll need a macro. I'll sign up
for the OO list and see if someone has done one.

Thanks.

I'm cleaning my office and I discovered a new
motherboard that I had forgotten about. It's a
Albatron KX600PRO. Technical specs are available
from numerous sites if you Google for it. I don't
have a processor for it but I do have a CPU fan.
Does anyone want it?

Worked fine with linux (unused for the last 18 months) but you have to
use it more often than I was in order to keep the printer head from
clogging.  It's in Corvallis but I'm at the airport early on Wednesday
mornings pretty often and could meet you there.

Please contact offlist.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <a49cba240703051441v183a709en95c8697202a4b610@mail.gmail.com>

Our network guy setup a VPN server. He setup the SSH connection icon for
every servers on the VPN web page. When click at "SSH to server" icon, VPN
will connect through SSH to that server. The problem is, none of Linux
servers can connect to SSH through VPN server. Other Unix servers (HP-UX,
Solaris, AIX...) are connecting fine SSH through VPN. When connecting SSH to
Linux (Suse, RedHat) servers from VPN, get this error "connecting to
connection closed".

Another problem, "pointing finger!" I told him, the problem is his VPN
setup. He told me, it is my Linux servers...blah, blah, blah...

My Linux servers are wide open for SSH. Is there anything there on my Linux
servers preventing SSH access through VPN server? Do I need to do anything
to allow SSH get through VPN server?

Thanks for your help.

Jenifer-
Is the ssh service running on the linux boxes? Can you ssh to the machines
without going through or from inside the VPN somewhere? Example  ... connect
via ssh to one of the Solaris/AIX boxes and then initiate a session to one
of the linux boxes, does it work?

So you can initiate a session using putty but not the "VPN web page" that
your Network Admin set up correct? Do you know what kind of VPN gear the
admin installed?

I would start by attempting to connect through the VPN and watching the
log file.

ssh -v or -vv or -vvv can also provide some insight.

Could it be a timeout issue for reverse DNS?

Sean

If you can't figure it out with that, you might have to use tcpdump....

Hi Drew,

Yes, the Network Admin guy setup the VPN web page. The VPN gear is Juniper
SA-4000 SSL-VPN.

It's possibly a routing thing. I've had to setup static routes to make
machines aware of routes to machines via hardware VPN's before. Does the
error message pop up right away, or is there a long timeout?

I use ssh over Openvpn (which uses ssl), and beyond a lot of
complications involving setting up certifications on the machine,
it works fine.  As others mentioned, try ssh -vvv for debugging. 
But before that, you should try pinging and traceroute and nmap
and other tools to make sure that the ports are open, not firewalled,
etc.  You can also telnet to port 22 and see if you get an ssh prompt.
You might also learn more about Openvpn - the documentation and 
cookbooks are fairly good, and might provide a clue about SSL-based
VPNs and Linux.

I suspect, from wading through the voluminous but largely content-free 
documentation on their Web site, that this is not a true VPN, but an SSL 
portal, because it claims "No client-software deployments." A true VPN 
requires that both server and client authenticate to each other. The vast 
majority of commercial SSL VPNs are not VPNs at all, but prettified Web 
browsers that allow arbitrary clients to login. Call me old-fashioned and 
grumpy, but the idea of letting users log in from public terminals or any old 
PC that you have no control over is insane, and paying tens of thousands of 
dollars for the privilege- well, there are no words. (keyloggers, anyone? 
spyware? sheeesh)

So I'm guessing that you're SOL, because it's not a real VPN tunnel at all. A 
real VPN doesn't require a Web browser for access. Think of it as a virtual 
private Ethernet cable transporting and protecting your bits over hostile 
networks.

This is a very good paper on the subject:
OpenVPN and the SSL VPN Revolution, by Charlie Hosner
http://www.sans.org/reading_room/whitepapers/vpns/

In conclusion, sites that don't use OpenVPN are too dumb to be in business. 
Because even if this a real SSL-based VPN, it's stupid to spend wads of money 
when a superior free product like OpenVPN is available.

In the case of Juniper SSL based VPN's, a virtual workspace can be created
for the users that allow them access to pre-determined applications that are
virtualized into a workspace.  The advantages here are that the user does
not need to be provided an IP address and has limited access to specific
hosts/applications.  Of course the disadvantage here is if they are granted
access to upload files, modify code, etc.  However, to address those
concerns about the possibility of distributing malware, rootkits, worms,
trojans, the likes, these can be effectively contained by not providing the
SSL user with an IP address (a host that cannot be be contacted within the
tunnel).  Split tunneling would be an entirely different story though.

Thats the line of thinking I was going for but was trying to get as much
info from the OP to find out what the deal was.

I've run into this zillions of times, and it doesn't get any better with 
repetition. An SSL portal is not a VPN, and allowing untrusted remote clients 
access to your network is just plain dim.

If it turns out that the Juniper SA-4000 SSL-VPN is an actual VPN, I'll eat a 
nice hearty helping of crow. But the rant against SSL portals masquerading as 
VPNs is still valid. :)

I need to read up on this particular device but I'm wondering why you'd want
to setup an SSL portal like that instead of just issuing a VPN client
directly? I'm also unable to discern whether or not Jenifer is able to SSH
directly from wherever she is testing from or whether she's verified it
works from inside the Network that sits behind the VPN.

Jenifer-
Can you provide a crude drawing as to what you're network looks like from
the perspective of  whatever client you're trying to connect from?

I have learned a lot about VPN by reading all of your replies . All of your
comments and inputs are very valuable and I really appreciate your helps.
The issue here is why this Juniper VPN can SSH to all Unix servers (hp-ux,
iax...) except Linux servers. It must be something on Linux servers that
preventing SSH to work with Juniper VPN server. I can SSH from Putty
connecting to the Linux servers fine. I have looked at /etc/ssh/sshd_config
and see no restrictions at all. Man, I am scratching my head on this
problem.

Are the HPUX and AIX boxes on a different subnet then the Linux boxes?

Ok, trying to be actually helpful here....

ssh -vvv is a good idea. Also, running ethereal or tcpdump on the ssh client, 
which was already suggested. It seems to me that everything points to a 
problem on the "VPN' portal, some kind of access control or routing gone 
astray.

   I'm curious whether anyone here has seen OO.o not provide a working
vertical scrollbar. When I get the file open dialog, and when I have a
document open in a window, there's a solid bar in the scrollbar window that
takes up the entire space. Can't scroll vertically. Strange.

   OO.o-2.0.3 here.

I have not seen that particular problem, but I have seen a lot of other
OOo problems. Most issues occur only on certain confgurations/distros.
There is a bug tracker that you can search at openoffice.org:

Er...sorry for the continued ranting, because you have to deal with what you 
have, but that is braindead. SSH through a real VPN tunnel is very nice, 
because then you have fewer hassles with forwarding and punching holes in 
your firewall. With a real VPN, once the tunnel is established you run SSH, 
or whatever you want to do, just the same as on your LAN.

If "209.152.98.99" is your alleged VPN gateway and SSH stops dead there, that 
confirms that's the roadblock.

For anyone who wants a real genuine excellent VPN, OpenVPN is wonderful. Get 
the book "OpenVPN: Building and Integrating Virtual Private Networks". The 
docs on openvpn.org are pretty good, but the book is easier to understand and 
more thorough.

   The problem is exactly as I suspected: the user apps theme selected within
Xfce. Of the half-dozen or so GUI apps that I regularly use, OO.o is the
only one where the vertical scroll bar fills the entire slot and refuses to
work. I just upgraded from -2.0.3 to -2.1.0 and there's no difference in
behavior.

   My solution is to change the theme when I need to use OO.o, then change it
back again when I'm finished.

   I want to see what the minimum Gnome-ish library requirements are for
AbiWord. Since the only part of OO.o that I ever use is the word processor,
123M+ of disk space is excessive. If AW can read/write .doc format, I'm
happy.

Yes, AbiWord can open .doc files. Not sure if it can save in .doc
format, but it definitely opens them.

Well that was weird. I went to make this reply and discovered that
overnight my keyboard died. Couldn't type anything anywhere. Mouse
still worked, though. One by one I closed apps until all were shut
down, but still no keyboard. Then I logged out and when the login
screen came up I still couldn't type. I clicked to shutdown, and got a
screenfull of stuff that didn't look like error codes, but also not
what I usually see when I shut down. Finally the shutdown process hung
and I had to hit the power button. 

On rebooting everything seems to be back to normal. Wonder what it was
that caused that. I've never lost just the keyboard before. I've had
lockups and other nasties happen, but both the mouse and the keyboard
are dead. Losing just the keyboard is a first.

OK, back to what I was going to say. I launched AbiWord and opened
a .doc file, then went to save it. (That's when I discovered the
keyboard was dead.) I had options to save in a zillion formats, Word,
OOo, html, etc. So its import/export filters can do what you need. This
is AbiWord 2.4.5 on Edgy amd64. Searching in Synaptic on "abiword"
reveals that I have installed abiword-common, -gnome, -help, -plugins,
and -plugins-gnome. 

I like AbiWord a lot, but I need features of OOo. For one thing, in
AbiWord all pages in a document must have the same orientation. And
tables are not as fully featured (I use a lot of tables). But most
critical is that it does not have an export to PDF. Plus,
it has no equivalent to PowerPoint or Impress. I keep it around because
OOo 2.0.4 on Edgy amd64 has a lot of broken stuff and it's useful for
testing. Just like I keep KOffice installed, because it can open PDF
files.

Yes, abiword says that it can save a word doc.  But if you look at the
file after you save it,
you see:

 >file test.doc
 test.doc: Rich Text Format data, version 1, ANSI

as opposed to:

 >file word.doc
 word.doc: Microsoft Office Document

The rtf will open in MS word, and is good enough for some cases (for
example, HR departments), but I suspect that it doesn't have all of
the features of word.

   A couple of weeks ago I lost the right side of the keyboard. It's fun to
type words that have only letters on the left half of the board showing up.
Killing X, logging out, and logging back in restored full function and my

   That's OK. I process words comparatively infrequently. All my serious
writing (articles, papers, proposals, and so on) are written in LaTeX using
the LyX interface. (Yes, the GUI is really faster than LaTeX in emacs.) My
marketing materials are prepared in Scribus. So my need for a word processor
is limited. And, I use nothing else in OO.o. Last week I tried to use the
spreadsheet, but could not successfully enter a formula under a column; it
wanted a name or something, so I gave up the attempt. (Don't care to know
how, either.) I've used XessSE for years as my spreadsheet, prepare
presentations using the Beamer class in LaTeX, and prepare vector figures
using Xfig and PSTricks.

   As long as AbiWord will print to a file, the output can be run through
ps2pdf to solve that problem.

Thanks for looking for dependencies,

Rich

This is also a good indication that AbiWord won't correctly display
the non-rtf features of an existing Word doc.  It's not 100%, but if
an app can't write all the features of a format, it probably can't
*read* the missing features either.

It could also just mean that they haven't implemented the output side
of things yet.

The day before yesterday I tried to sign up for the OO users list. I
succeeded in getting large numbers of posts each day, but am unable to
post a question myself. I sent an e-mail to the list administrator, per
the "Welcome" e-mail I got, but haven't heard back.

Has anyone else tried to join that list?

As Gilda used to say, "Oh. That's very different. Never mind."

What I thought was the correct address to send posts to isn't. I
corrected the address to users at openoffice.org and I successfully posted
my question.

was answered. It's a high volume list with two tons of Windows users.

   Sometimes, it is a lo-o-ong wait to see my posts appear. But, not two

I've been reading the list since forever. I post when I have a
question, but I respond only a couple times per month. Yes, there are
lots of Windows users, but it's not that big a deal to delete the posts
that I am not interested in or for which I have no answer. I also do
not respond to a post that I know a dozen other users are going to jump
in and answer. I save my answering efforts for those questions that I
know the answer to but few other users would have experience with.
Recently it was how to type Unicode characters for International
Phonetic Alphabet. I'm not a programmer and I am not brilliant. But the
software is free and I should do at least something for the community.
Maybe all I can do is answer an occasional question, but it is still is
my duty to do so. Besides, occasionally I learn a new trick.

I have four e-mail accounts, but only one is signed up for the list. It
used to was that if I did not post from the address that was signed up
the post would be bounced. They have changed things and now posts from
the wrong e-mail address do show up, but a couple days late.

Hi All-
Drunk from the success of getting vmware working under fedora core (thanks
to everyone who helped!) I'm attempting my next adventure. I'd like to
install a VM (easy enough) but I confused on the networking setup. I'd like
this VM to have its own public IP so I have no idea which option(s) to
choose during setup in order to accomplish this. The guest (linux) will be
running on a linux host w/ public IP as well so I'm not sure if there any
caveats to this setup? Google has so far failed me so any pointers to docs
would be appreciated.

Thanks!

Super simple.  Just choose "bridged" networking.  Later, when running
vmware-config.pl, go ahead and let the script build both a NAT and
a host-only network for you as well, just so you'll have the option to
use them later.

I run VMWare Server 1.0.1 on a Windows XP host serving a Ubuntu Guest.

I'm on a school network, but came across your particular scenario as I
wanted the VM accessible beyond the Host machine.  You can configure
the network settings during the VM build, or after, it doesn't matter
really.

Anyhow, for what you describe, I think you'll want to specify the
bridged connection.  In my setup, both the Host and Guest have the
same IP address.  Therefore, since I don't have any web server running
on my Windows Host box, all web traffic directed toward the shared IP
address is picked up by my VM Guest running apache.

However, you can also specify that the VM get its own IP address as
well.  You'd do this from within the VM guest using the traditional
tools available in the guest OS.

HTH,

Ben

Sounds like you want all traffic "Bridged" into your VM, after you  
give that VM a static/public IP. If you used "Host only", only the  
host running the VM could talk to it, and if you used NAT then you'd  
have to go through some serious contortions to make sure packets from  
the public got to your VM.

Routing differences would be my first guess.  Can you compare 'netstat
-rn' on the AIX and Linux boxes to see if there are any special routes?
Also, you might check the firewall settings on your Linux boxes; AIX
comes up wide open by default, but a lot of Linux distributors these
days enable a fairly restrictive firewall by default.

abiword can't open word documents with any of the fancy "features" that 
modern versions of word have; open office is better but there are still 
documents that I get which require word to actually view the content as 
the author intends.

Message-ID: <45EFCD12.4050506@comcast.net>

Anyone have experience setting it up?  It seems like it should be a 
simple, straightforward process, but I appear to be missing a step 
somewhere.  There seems to be a very subtle difference in the directory 
trees of the two source packages which makes it almost impossible to get 
the geomview browser to recognize the path to the orrery module.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Dear friends,

We want to set up a (file) server which will be used exclusively in a 
LAN, hooked up to Windows XP and Vista machines. We need someone to 
do the initial setup. We want some software installed as well, 
focusing on Apache 2.x, PHP 5.x, Perl 5.8+, Ruby 1.8+ and Rails.

Please respond with some information on your experience, what distro 
you would use and why, how much you would charge, and what guarantees 
you can provide. We have funds in hand, and we are willing to pay a 
fair wage for quality work.

Thank you Carla and All. I think we have enough for this discussion. The
bottom line is I gave up and let the network guy does whatever he wants to
do. I know, Carla, OpenVPN is nice. But it is too late for this network guy.
He already spent too much company's money to implement Juniper VPN (a
commercial expensive product package). Ok, I want everyone has job and food
on table for their family. If I bring up OpenVPN to the management, he will
be out the door.

Thanks again my friends,
Jenifer

Subject: [PLUG] DST Sunday morning - Check your system, Win users beware
Message-ID: <20070308174743.GA12974@gate.kl-ic.com>


As you know, they changed the algorithm for daylight savings time
and it starts this weekend, two weeks earlier than previous years. 
Folks with older distros or who have not recently upgraded may want
to check their time change dates with:

zdump -v /etc/localtime | grep 2007

On my laptop, I get:

/etc/localtime  Sun Mar 11 09:59:59 2007 UTC = Sun Mar 11 01:59:59 2007 PST isdst=0 gmtoff=-28800
/etc/localtime  Sun Mar 11 10:00:00 2007 UTC = Sun Mar 11 03:00:00 2007 PDT isdst=1 gmtoff=-25200
/etc/localtime  Sun Nov  4 08:59:59 2007 UTC = Sun Nov  4 01:59:59 2007 PDT isdst=1 gmtoff=-25200
/etc/localtime  Sun Nov  4 09:00:00 2007 UTC = Sun Nov  4 01:00:00 2007 PST isdst=0 gmtoff=-28800

If you don't get the right answer, you will need to do more research
on a cure; automated updates took care of this for me.


Those of you running older Microsoft products are semi-f****d.  If
you are running Windows 2000, Exchange 2000, or Exchange 5.5, for
example, these are no longer officially supported and a patch will
cost you $4000 , according to:

http://macdailynews.com/index.php/weblog/comments/12891/

It seems that Microsoft embeds the conversion times into the 
application programs, not a global file that all applications use. 
So even "supported" systems will need a lot of program patching.

The "drive off customers to Linux/Mac" team at Redmond is apparently
working late these days.  Expect a LOT of angry Microsoft users
driving home from work Monday.  Some are calling this "mini-Y2K".

   Thank you for the reminder, Keith. The Slackware development team released
a fixed glibc-localzone a couple of weeks ago, and I apparently missed
seeing the notice in my inbox.

   But, they'll be driving home an hour later so the commute should be easier
for those with the correct time.

Ali,

   I don't get heavily-embossed Word docs from clients or agencies, but
sometimes I need to send them an editable file they can instantly open in
Word. So, I guess I will stick with the OO.o bloat a while longer.

Thank you,

If anyone is brave enough to be running GroupWise under Linux, you will
need:

"DST Changes are in GW 7.0.1 IR1 GWIA & Webaccess release patch date of
21 December 2006 or newer."

You get the whole SDD of Groupwise with that download.  Seems that it
installs new binaries (rpm's) and doesn't touch the domain or PO areas
(no wpX.db files are changed).  If you already have 7.0.1, no display
tells you that it is now 7.0.1ir1, so you can verify by looking at the
date on the RPM's installed, `rpm -qa|grep novell`.  eDirectory and
Groupwise clients use the system time (SuSE/Windows updates).

Gaining this knowledge was not a choice. :)  Viva la FOSS!

Which they can do to a 'doc' file saved by abiword.  The file has a
.doc extension and MS Word opens it up, just as if it were a real word
doc.  The average joe won't realize that it's not a word doc.

The timezone files seem to be a reasonably stable binary format (at
least, within the same bit-width), so you can update older systems by
copying the appropriate timezone file (/usr/share/zoneinfo/US/Pacific)
to the older hosts.  I had to do this with an old Caldera OpenLinux
(pre-mad-SCO disease) box and SuSE 9.1 box.

I have a set of instructions in my mail spool at home that shows how to 
rebuild the timezone information based on the current tables.  If I 
remember I will dig it out and post it here.

My Edgy amd64 laptop just announced there were updates available. One
of them was a timezone something-or-another. I installed it, so I guess
I won't suffer the horrible fate of having to adjust the time
manually. :)

Thanks, Bill. Sadly, I'm responsible for a W2K machine on which I'll

I posted this question to users at openoffice.org and got a few responses.
One of them came close enough that, with modifications, it solves my
problem. One of the users replied:

If I reverse the order, i.e. start with <Down Arrow> and follow with
<Ctrl+Left Arrow> I get close to what I want. <Ctrl+Left Arrow> stops
when it encounters data. For my application this will work most of the
time, since there is almost always some data in the cell to the left of
the one I want to go to and rarely any data to the right of that cell.

Silly people, it is only an hour, 1/12 of a clock dial.  Just
turn your computer 30 degrees and everything will be just fine :-/

For those of us running Win98 under VMWare, we will simply
make manual adjustments for Daylight Savings Time on Sunday,
and Daylight Savings Unsavings Time in April.  At least we
don't have to adjust for Standard NonStandard Time in November.

And if you are thinking about flying redeye that morning,
bring a Knoppix install CD, and a parachute.

At this point, it seems that the official microlump instructions would 
be more likely ruin things badly enough to force an upgrade to vista.  
"We don't want you messing with that old broken version of windows 
because we've got a brand new one which is broken much better."

Anyway, it might not have to be the registry surgery that they describe:
 
http://www.intelliadmin.com/blog/2007/01/unofficial-windows-2000-daylight.html

I've found several others, but these guys seem to maybe know what 
they're doing (at least, as well as anyone can when they're up to their 
armpits in a box full of steaming black stuff wearing goggles and 
noseplugs.)

Subject: [PLUG] CUPS Password Problem
Message-ID: <45F0C571.9080706@comcast.net>

I got the Brother MFC-7820N fax/printer and am trying to set it up using
CUPS. With Konqueror, I got to the web interface with CUPS,
http://localhost631/ and started poking around. The first entry on the
page is "Do Administration Tasks" which requires a user name and
password. I tried "root" and my root password, which the documentation
says should work. It doesn't. I get the error message:

Authentication Failed. Do you want to retry?

Any idea what to try next?

If it matters, this is a SuSE 10.1 installation.

TIA.

There is always the method of changing the value of the TZ environment
variable. Not as nice as automatic changing, but effective in the worst
case.

Dick,

   Did you enter that string, or http://localhost:631? There's a difference.

   Root should be admin level with CUPS.

On booting (Grub line has "quiet no splash") I suddenly got a couple
screenfuls of the following:

udevd[2216] add-to-rules: unknown 'attrs{idProduct}'

The same line repeated for about a screenful worth on shutdown, but
after restarting, shutting down, and restarting a few times, it now
happens only on bootup. In spite of what appears to be an error
message, the computer seems to operate fine.

Whatever it means, it was caused by something in the following: Edgy
amd64 announced that I had half a dozen upgrades. I was applying the
upgrades with Synaptic when the computer locked up -- dead keyboard and
mouse, no disk activity. I had to hit the power button.

When Grub came back up I decided to run memtest. I have never done this
before, but I recently ran into a webpage suggesting that memory might
be a cause of lockups -- and I have one original 256 MB stick and one 1
GB replacement stick. Maybe there is a memory mismatch or something. So
I ran memtest one pass, a little over an hour. No errors, so I went
ahead and booted. That is when the above message suddenly appeared.

Google tells me that udevd is some kind of utility, but I don't
understand what it does. And the rest of it is in Greek. But if I
understood it I bet I would know what is wrong and have a fair chance
of fixing it.

Jason,

  I looked at the man pages for udev, udevd, udevinfo, and udevmonitor. 
Basically, udev is the program that handles devices dynamically. This is 
how we are able to plug in digital cameras, thumb drives, ipods, etc. 
and have them magically be mounted and available. You might find 
something useful in the output of "udevinfo -e".

Jason-
As Mel mentioned udev is used to dynamically create devices in the /proc
filesystem. AFAIK its only for 2.6 kernels but I may be wrong. I found
exactly 1 hit on google after change a few parameters for the search based
on your error message and its a post to an ubuntu forum about a similar but
not exact udev problem

https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ticket/3801

May be worthwhile checking into. Maybe udev was part of the upgrade packages
you installed and there's a bug perhaps? It seems like to me from the text
you posted that udev is unable to create a device node for something
installed on the computer because it can't determine its device attributes
but I could be completely wrong.

Drew-

Thanks. I tried "udevinfo -e," but didn't see anything unusual in the
list of things it showed. I also tried dmesg and saw nothing new.

I found an almost identical message on the 32bit general forum at
Ubuntu dated January, 2007 with one uninformed followup. I added a "me
too," but no further posts since.

I wish there was a way to interpret what the [2216] refers to, what
add_to_rules means or what 'attr{idProduct}' refers to. On my Edgy
amd64 computer man udevd tells me that it "ensures the right event
order and takes care, that events for child devices are delayed until
the parent has finished the device handling." So some device is
impatiently trying to load before its parent device is ready. Who knows
which one. The man page lists a couple options, but I can't understand
their function because I don't know the terminology.

Another plan of attack might be to see why the order of events got
messed up. I am assuming that the order of device loading is controled
by a config file somewhere. If so, I could find one with a timestamp
matching when the computer locked up and I ran the memtest.

Meantime, I guess all I can do is wait until something blows up.

Yeah, I found this one earlier. Didn't offer any real help. Love the
final line:

Solution: Reformatted the Linux partition and reinstalled V6.06

You're right. There were several packages upgraded, and the only one I
remember was Ktorrent. There must be a list of upgrades somewhere.
Changes to the repositories? Log file on my computer?

udev rules and the seemingly arbitrary changes introduced in their
syntax and structure have frustrated many people for quite some time.
Personally, I've not yet found it necessary to mess with them, happily,
so I remain blissfully ignorant until it someday bites me on the ass.
There's some good, thorough documentation here:

http://www.reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html

I'm not sure what "[2216]" means, but the "attr{idProduct}" would seem
to indicate, as Drew suggested, that udev is missing an attribute for
some device you have, or it thinks it is.  Basically, you use udevinfo
to determine the various attributes of any particular device you want to
write a rule for.  Then you use those attributes to contruct a rule.
So, for example:

~$ udevinfo -a -p /sys/block/sda

Udevinfo starts with the device specified by the devpath and then
walks up the chain of parent devices. It prints for every device
found, all possible attributes in the udev rules key format.
A rule to match, can be composed by the attributes of the device
and the attributes from one single parent device.

  looking at device '/block/sda':
    KERNEL=="sda"
    SUBSYSTEM=="block"
    DRIVER==""
    ATTR{stat}==" 2170526   295139 130531751 14838764  3096316 14664226
142239082 87592236        0 11373572 102465456"
    ATTR{size}=="312581808"
    ATTR{removable}=="0"
    ATTR{range}=="16"
    ATTR{dev}=="8:0"

  looking at parent device
'/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:0f.0/host0/target0:0:0/0:0:0:0':
    KERNELS=="0:0:0:0"
    SUBSYSTEMS=="scsi"
    DRIVERS=="sd"
    ATTRS{ioerr_cnt}=="0x0"
    ATTRS{iodone_cnt}=="0x505da8"
    ATTRS{iorequest_cnt}=="0x505da8"
    ATTRS{iocounterbits}=="32"
    ATTRS{timeout}=="30"
    ATTRS{state}=="running"
    ATTRS{rev}=="08.0"
    ATTRS{model}=="WDC WD1600JD-22H"
    ATTRS{vendor}=="ATA     "
    ATTRS{scsi_level}=="6"
    ATTRS{type}=="0"
    ATTRS{queue_type}=="none"
    ATTRS{queue_depth}=="1"
    ATTRS{device_blocked}=="0"
[more results snipped]

That gives you a whole bunch of attributes you can use to construct your
rules.  "Product" is one of those attributes, but your udevd specifies
"idProduct".  Maybe it's just the name of the attribute that has
changed.

My bet would be that something in Ubuntu's new init system, Upstart[1],
has not quite meshed with udev.  Probably just a little bug they need to
fix, or a messed-up script somewhere.  But that's the price of living on
the bleeding edge.

For Synaptic I would look around /var/log as thats where most log files are
generally kept. I would almost be certain that there's some sort of
transaction log. I know Slackware and Fedora Core have both implemented this
so that there are time stamped logs of when a particular package was
installed.  You may want to scope out /etc/udev/rules.d which is where those
rules live on my boxen and see if the time stamp is from today or gives any
clue as to when it might have last been changed.

I'm almost certain that 2216 is referring to the process ID however if its
the same on every boot then of course that wouldn't be the case.

Browsing to /etc/udev/rules.d/ I hit paydirt. The file
45-libgphoto2.rules has a timestamp today approximately when the
upgrades were made and the computer locked up. Inside it says:

# udev rules file for libgphoto2 devices (udev >= 0.98)
#
SUBSYSTEM!="usb*", GOTO="libgphoto2_rules_end"
ACTION!="add", GOTO="libgphoto2_rules_end"

ATTRS{idVendor}=="0553", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0202", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
ATTRS{idVendor}=="06bd", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0403", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
ATTRS{idVendor}=="06bd", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0404", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
and several more pages of similar lines.

Unfortunately, I still can't grok what it refers to. But I'm getting 
closer. There are two packages installed in Synaptic, libgphoto2 
and libgphoto2-port0. I just reinstalled them, and now I'm going 
to restart. <Crossing fingers.>

Didn't work. Still getting the error messages. :(

Oh well. Maybe in the morning when my head is working again I'll figure it out.

 John-
libgphoto2-port0 is used by libgphoto to access usb and serial devices so i
think based on what you found in the rules directory that the error is
either a serial port or usb issue. Do you have any USB devices plugged into
your laptop? If so I'd start by unplugging them one by one and see if the
error goes away.

That works for Unix machines.  It does not work as well for Windows

Subject: 	What I learned about Windows and Daylight Saving Time 
today...
Date: 	Mon, 5 Mar 2007 14:47:49 -0800


Prompted by a bug report regarding the new DST rules I had a closer
look how localtime() determines DST on Windows.  Below is my analysis
of the sorry state of affairs, as far as I can tell.

I guess for the vast majority of Windows users this just means that
DST will be wrong for older timestamps.  I'm not sure how important
that is though.  Providing a proper workaround probably means that
we would have to use the DateTime::TimeZone module within localtime().

=====================================================================
The daylight saving time (DST) for the localtime() function is
determined by the C runtime library function of the same name.

This function has 2 different operating modes:

1) The TZ environment variable has been set.

In this case MSVCRT calculates DST itself, based on the USA rules.
The latest released version (as of (March 5th 2007) of MSVCRT.dll has
not yet been updated for the 2007 DST rules.  The localtime() function
will still apply the old rules to 2007.  Microsoft claims to have a
hotfix for this, that is available from Microsoft Customer Support
Services only:

    http://support.microsoft.com/kb/932590

2) The TZ environment variable has *not* been set.

In this case MSVCRT retrieves the DST transition times from the
GetTimeZoneInformation() API:

     http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms724421.aspx

This API only provides the transition times according to the *current*
DST rules.  There is no database of historical transition times.  That
means that localtime() applied to previous years will use the new
transition times even for old timestamps.

Windows Vista (and Longhorn Server) support a new API called
GetDynamicTimeZoneInformation() that implements a database of historic
DST rules.  It is not known if the hotfix mentioned above will make
use of this API when running on Vista.
=====================================================================

Cheers,
-Jan

I was already thinking along those lines -- removing devices until the
error goes away. However, this is a laptop and there isn't much I can
remove. The only thing that is always connectedf is my external USB
mouse (I hate touchpads). First thing I did this morning was to unplug
it and restart. Didn't work. Still getting the error messages. :(

As for serial, isn't that an old port that no one uses any more? I
think there is a serial output port on this computer, but nothing has
ever been plugged into it. 

I think there are some internal devices that are USB as well as the
external mouse, but I'm not sure. Dmesg normally lists the mousie and,
if I understood the "usbcore" line correctly, ndiswrapper. I read
through the whole dmesg and the only thing that looked suspicious was:

 14.415935] drivers/rtc/hctosys.c: unable to open rtc device (rtc0)

I opened Synaptic hoping to find something named hct* or rtc*, but
nada. However, on launching Synaptic it announced that there were 13
upgrades available. All were related to KDE except two for xine and one for
ekiga. I decided to go ahead an upgrade them all and reboot. But on
rebooting I'm still getting the error messages.

Earlier I said that the first time there was about a screenful of the
same error messages on shutdown, but that they had gone away. That was
an error. Sometimes the screen goes by too fast to see it, but after
restarting a dozen times the error messages on shutdown are still there.

Just think of all I am learning about Linux. :(

RTC is the real time clock on the processor IIRC. No need to worry about
that. What you could do, and I take no responsibility if it breaks
something, you could try moving the libgphoto rules out of /etc/udev/rules.d
and see what happens. I think we're all the same page that its more then
likely a broken rule, the question is, what device if any would be affected
by this boogered rule.

What does one do when CUPS doesn't recognize root's password?

I currently have no printer on this machine, so I have no historical
settings to be concerned about.

If I were to uninstall and reinstall CUPS, would it start fresh, or
would I need to manually find whatever file has CUPS' password and
remove it?

Is there a better way to think about this problem?

TIA.

hehe.  That means they would use the tz database (it comes bundled with 
DateTime) just like a real operating system.  Wow, why didn't microlump

I wonder if SUSE did the same dim thing as Ubuntu Dapper and older, which 
(stupidly) disabled the root password in CUPS and the CUPS web interface.

Sure enough, SuSE did change how CUPS runs.

>From the SuSE documentation found on my machine:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.6.2.1. cupsd Runs as the User lp

 On start-up, cupsd changes from the user root to the user lp. This
provides a much higher level of security, because the CUPS print service
does not run with unrestricted permissions, only with the permissions
needed for the print service.

However, the authentication (the password check) cannot be performed via
/etc/shadow, because lp has no access to /etc/shadow. Instead, the
CUPS-specific authentication via /etc/cups/passwd.md5 must be used. For
this purpose, a CUPS administrator with the CUPS administration group
sys and a CUPS password must be entered in /etc/cups/passwd.md5. To do
this, enter the following as root:
lppasswd -g sys -a CUPS-admin-name

 This setting is also essential if you want to use the CUPS
administration Web front-end or the KDE printer administration tool.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once I created the user and password I was able to log in to "Do
Administration Tasks" at http://localhost:631/ and add the printer. The
test page printed just fine.

   I don't mind if software wants to protect me from myself, but it should
also accommodate those who know what they're doing more easily than what you
had to do. If it got you where you needed, that's great. But, look at the
time involved.

   Probably Novell's product liability lawyers foisted that change on
everyone. "Remove child from stoller before folding." D'uh.

True. But maybe this experience will make me remember that I do have
documentation that explains stuff, and I really should read it.

As far as the time involved, this is the first time I've had in three
years to put into learning about CUPS, and also the first network
connected printer I've had at home. So I should expect to spend a little
time on it. The installation on XP didn't go smoothly, either. There was
no instruction to manually set the printer's IP address before I got
started. Then, after I realized I didn't want it to be known as dhccp4
(or something like that -- what was assigned by my router), I couldn't
find a way to change it in the XP driver. There's a way to change it
from the printer's front panel, which is simple enough, but no way I
could find to change where the computer was told to look for it. In the
troubleshooting section of the web site, the recommendation was to
uninstall the driver and reinstall it! That worked. On the other hand,
the Win98 driver install went very smoothly. Of course, by this time I
had already changed the printer's IP address, and knew to pay attention
to that during the driver install.

As always, now that it works I'm happy.

Or their security engineers.  Not running processes as root that do not
need to be is a good thing.  The inability to read /etc/shadow and
authenticate with it is a minor inconvenience; there are other ways they
could have made it work more transparently.  OTOH, not allowing root to
login remotely with the usual root password on a service that doesn't
log authentication via syslog is also probably good.

NTP operates on UTC, not local time.  NTP packets to not contain 
information regarding local time zone offset or DST rollover 
information.  It is up to the local system to provide the local time - 
by way of offset from UTC.  For Pacific, that's 8 for standard time and 
7 for daylight savings time.  It is up to the local system to adjust the 
offset from 8 to 7 in the spring and 7 to 8 in the fall.  That's the 
rub.  Then, of course, there's JRE which does it's own time thing.

Thanks for the clarification. I don't expect any trouble with this
machine. I ran zdump -v /etc/localtime | grep 2007 as recommended by
Keith and got the correct results. I was thinking particularly of my
Win98 machines, all of which use NetTime to keep the clock updated. I've
got the link to the patch, but I think I'll wait until tomorrow to see
if I really need it on those machines. I no longer do anything critical
on them as far at time stamps are concerned.

You can download tzedit.exe from out on the internets and run it on your 
win98 box(s) - it edits the table that contains the offsets and the 
dates when they are engaged.  Then there's all the other stuff you might 
have with time in it - I just noticed that appointments in my handy HP 
iPAQ are all off by one hour starting Monday.  But then it runs Windoze 
so . . .

Misunderstanding why people bypass the RFC's can become a major
contributor to the spam problem.  If we aren't on the same page,
what you do and what I do to address spam will be incompatible and
when these efforts fail, they discourage both of us from trying
to filter out spam at all.  I run my own mail server and the
recommendation I have run into is to use the whois.rfc-ignorant
blacklist.

You are saying that making the source of email more identifiable
increases spam, am I correct?

My impression, someone please step in and correct me if I am wrong, is that
bind 9.3 is supposed to hand out your mail exchanger records in order and
not shuffle them.

My brother and I are attempting to be backup mail exchanger sites for each
other and waddya know, we are finding that mail to site A ends up trying to
go through site B even when A is still up.

So we have...

foo.com. MX 30 mail.bar.com
foo.com. MX 20 mail2.foo.com
foo.com. MX 10 mail1.foo.com

at one site ( The domains aren't really foo and bar. )

And

bar.com. MX 30 mail2.foo.com
bar.com. MX 20 mail1.foo.com
bar.com. MX 10 mail1.bar.com

at the other site.

Now, our theory going in for someone trying to email a person on say foo
is that their ISP's mail server won't go to bar unless foo is down.
Apparently, our bind servers hand out the mail exchangers in shuffled
order.  I guess the weights are included with this list, but they seem
to be getting ignored wholesale.  Is there some way to disable shuffling
in bind 9?  Is it possible to get the average smtp server out on the
Internet to use the mail exhangers for a particular domain in order?

Can a specific order be enforced when it comes to which mail excahnger for
a particular domain gets tried first, second,...?

Try something like the following:

There of course is the true fix that is permanent and patches pretty well
everything. Getting rid of DST. Fixing it for the whole country would be
best, but failing that doing it at the state level works too.

Alas I've been dragged out of Oregon, but I've still got the details
handy. You need to write to your legislator and ask them to amend
ORS 187.110, to exempt Oregon from 15 U.S.C. 260a (the national law
explicitly allows states to exempt themselves). Seems I need the
equivalent section of California law now.  :-/

I was going to take your suggestion, but decided to wait until after I
finished a big project that I needed the computer for. This evening I
finished it and, just for kicks and giggles, launched the Update
Manager. Guess what? New versions of libgphoto*. I'm pretty sure those
were in the upgrades I did just before this mess started. 

I installed the new ones, then shut down and restarted. No more error
messages. I could go sniff around in Ubuntu bug trackers to be sure,
but it looks like someone at Ubuntu put new libgphoto files in the
reppositories before they were ready for prime time, and the ones I
just upgraded to are a hasty fix.

Thanks for all the advice and suggestions. At least I learned something
more about Linux. Like "don't be in such a hurry to install an
upgrade." :)

Glad I could I  could help ... I  think :-)  Don't worry about being in a
hurry to install an upgrade, don't do what I did and be in a hurry to do a
re-install and format the /home partition ;-)

Run "date" in a shell.  Does that give the right answer?

Strange.  My watch says 8:22, but I did not reset it this AM.  And my VCR, which 
gets time from the transmitted signal shows 8:22 as well. It looks like the only 
thing that has changed is PST -> PDT, an S becomes a D.

If your computer was powered off at 2:00 AM *and* your hardware clock
is set to local time instead of UTC, then it would have missed the change.
The computer now thinks it is on PDT, but on boot-up it synced to the
hardware clock which was still on PST.

That's why it's usually better to have the hardware clock set to UTC. Unless 
you are dual booting to Windows, then the advantage/disadvantage balance
tilts toward having the hardware clock set to local time.

Thanks.  That answers the computer question.  I do dual boot.

Any ideas on the VCR?  I seem to recall that in the past it changed from PST PDT 
without any intervention on my part.

   My PalmOS PDA is part of the cell phone. I just turned it on and the
display read 1:50pm. So, I put in in the sync cradle thinking that a hot
sync would get it up to date, but just connecting to the system via the
cradel was sufficient. I'm impressed.

   Of course, the dogs don't to time changes well. Their internal clocks are
quite accurate but they pay no attention to the silly political games we
humans play. Always takes them a week or so to sync back up.

   A sharp slap on the left side with an open hand should push it ahead 1

I'd guess that chances are if your OS can't change the dates it uses for 
DST it also can't eliminate it either unless you tell it you're at a 
location that's never obeyed DST which just causes another set of time 
problems.

Also, I like the extra daylight at the end of the day during DST..

I don't really know but my theory is that the VCR just updates the 24 
hour clock via a signal containing only the time and not whether it's 
daylight savings time or not.  When april rolls around I bet it'll turn 
on the PDT flag, push the time ahead 1 hour, and then reset it back to 
the actual time with the time update signal.  But that's just a guess 
really..

This weekend I was at a motel in Bend, which had free wifi.  The
problem was, the nameserver was broken - it returned incorrect
IP addresses for most names (en.wikipedia.org = 1.0.0.0, for 
example) .  I could still connect to numeric IP addresses, though.

I could still drive a VPN to my server, so I copied the
appropriate IP addresses from /etc/resolv.conf over to my
laptop on the VPN link.  That meant that new names resolved
correctly, but the old addresses still pointed at the
borked IP addresses given by the balky nameserver; the bad
translations were apparently cached somewhere.

My experience with nameservers is with named and such;  I
recently changed over to 2.6.9/RHEL4.4 and don't know where
the name service cache sits, or how to flush it (it seems
to survive through a reboot).  So the question:

??? How do you flush the namserver cache on 2.6.9/RHEL4.4 ? 

Keith

PS:  am no longer at the motel, so this is mostly of academic
interest, but I might encounter a bad nameserver in the future
to clean up after.

I just discovered that crond on my (no longer supported) FC3 system is still

I have to maintain some long-dead distro versions (RH 7.2, RH 8, FC 3) 
in order to keep some proprietary software running.

I just downloaded the raw updated zoneinfo files, ran them through 
zic, and installed them over the rpm-installed files. crond needs to 
be restarted to see the new files -- the same for syslogd and most 
other daemons.

Yeah, manual file installation breaks rpm control, but these machines 
are all on life support anyway...

Following up on myself, seems to be anything that switches to a user
account via PAM (including crond) gets syslogged with a PST time stamp
to /var/log/messages.

Manual install was not needed for FC3. There were time zone RPM
updates available for FC3 from the fedora-legacy project before it
went under.

[ In summary, I was at a motel with a borked dns server.  I
tried modifying /etc/resolv.conf by hand to some good servers,
but was still getting bad IP addresses for names looked up
previously.  I assume a cache contains persistent bad IP
addresses - keith ]

That is an accurate answer, but I think I mistakenly asked the
wrong question.  I don't have rndc or named on my laptop.  Those
were on RH9 2.4.22, but not on RHEL4.4 2.6.9.  I have the nscd
(name service cache daemon) program on my laptop, but "nscd -g"
says nscd is not running. 

I am not sure, but I think I am trying to find the "DNS resolver"
cache for my 2.6.9 kernel, see:
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS#Broken_resolvers

Since both ping and firefox were giving me the bad IP addresses,
it is probably something the kernel hooks up to, though since it
persists through reboots it is probably a cache outside of the
kernel itself.  "man resolver" (and gethostbyname),  doesn't tell
me about cache files.  I've looked at much other stuff, and may
have to dive into kernel source to answer the question.  Yikes!

Look for a package called "caching-nameserver" and remove it.

Keith,

   I don't have the answer to that question, but perhaps what I've done would
be of interest to you.

   On my notebook, I copy /etc/resolv.conf to /etc/resolve.conf.office. This
is the list of dns servers I use in the office on all hosts.

   When I travel, I always need to run (as root) 'dhcpcd -d ethx' (where x ==
0 || x == 1 depending on whether the connection is wired or wireless) to get
an IP address for my location. Frequently, this overwrites /etc/resolve.conf
with the hotel's/airport's/coffee shop's DNS server names. I let them
happily overwrite each other. When I return to the office, I copy
resolv.conf.office to resolv.conf and I'm back to where I need to be.

   It ain't sophisticaled, but it's been working for me for several years
now.

Rich

Even though my FC3 system had all the correct updates, I had to
re-run the time-zone selection utility to re-select America/Los Angeles
in order to get it to stick system-wide.

Some of my processes had TZ=PST8PDT which is why they worked. But
processes without a TZ setting used the system default time zone,
which was a cached copy of the old time zone settings for
America/Los Angeles. Rerunning the time-zone selection utility
updated the cached copy. The package update ought to have taken
care of this, but since fedora-legacy is now dead there's not
anyone to complain to.

As I understand it, that process requires a:

 cd /state/representatives/
 tar -xvf newrepresentatives.tar

This is, I am told, because consumers shop more during daylight
hours, and it is better business to send them to work in darkness
and have them come home past the stores in the waning daylight.
Employers want their people awake, so start times at businesses
compensate over time by starting the day later.  The direction of
movement indicates the relative strength of production businesses
versus retail businesses and their respective lobbying power.

100 years from now, we will have daylight savings savings savings
savings time, the sun will come up at 2PM, and we will go to work
at 3PM, and go home at 12PM, past the stores in waning daylight.  
Going to work at 3PM is standard programmers hours now, so for
these workers there will be no change.  :-)

Quibble: 12PM (admitting some ambiguity) should properly be regarded
as Noon, rather than midnight.  While the stroke of noon could
reasonably be regarded as neither ante nor post meridian, all those
12:foo:bar.baz times _are_ post meridian and therefore it makes sense
on my personal planet to regard the instant of meridian as lumped in
with its neighbors.

But then again, real sanity in our temporal labelling schemes will
only arrive with the adoption of the French Revolutionary Calendar as
well as the metric clock.

PLUGgers:

I forwarded a similar question about borked DNS resolution to
the Scientific Linux mailing group, and got a great response,
forwarded below.  My solution might not be available to most
people.  However, there might be DNS servers out there on
alternate ports to UDP 53, and a expedient IP tables fix might
work for others, too.

So there wasn't really a cache on my machine at all.  Interesting.

This suggests a fix.  I usually set up a VPN back to my server when
I am remote (and it worked this time, too, because I use numeric IP
addresses to get there).  If I use iptables rules to forward all UDP
port 53 traffic to my own server, through the VPN, I can bypass a
balky DNS server.  A little slower, but more reliable.

Thanks for the very helpful response!

   My scanner is now plugged into a USB port on the rear of the motherboard,
along with a web cam. Because of permissions problems, I -- a mere user --
cannot use them. I will change permissions to allow me access to these
devices, but to do so I need to know to what device they're assigned.

   lsusb reports:

Bus 002 Device 001: ID 0000:0000 
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000

   How do I identify /dev/<whatever> so I can make a couple of softlinks,

dmesg shows device names for USB storage devices (your scanner is not
one of these, I know).  I have here a snippet of dmesg output for my
6-slot card reader, for example:

scsi 2:0:0:0: Direct-Access     Y-E DATA CF Card Reader   1.03 PQ: 0 ANSI: 2

sd 2:0:0:3: Attached scsi generic sg3 type 0
usb-storage: device scan complete

And if I go to /usr/src/linux/drivers/usb/ and issue:

     grep -nr -e 'device scan complete' *

I find this:

     storage/usb.c:936: printk(KERN_DEBUG "usb-storage: device scan complete\n");

If you can find any debug info at all re: your scanner in dmesg or
/var/log/messages, perhaps a snippet of generic text will lead you
right to the kernel code that outputs it.  Who knows what tantalyzing
leads may develop from this.

Check out this thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=91948

Once you can identify your device, you can use udev as described in
that thread (And the book Ubuntu Hacks) to both mount it where you
want it, and also give it the permissions you want, using the MODE
attribute.

Perhaps this is overkill for the problem you're having, but I think it
is the most elegant solution, at least for systems using udev.

I've never seen a Linux distribution that didn't include static versions
of the timezones. Setting the timezone to PST instead of US/Pacific will
make the system clock be PST all the time. I don't know whether the other
bit of software can handle that, but I think it likely.

Then arrange with your employer to start and end your day early during
the summer. Don't mess with my clock (not to mention the huge
productivity losses due to sleepy workers during the change).

I want to try Gentoo amd64 version with a live/install CD. For the life

http://torrents.gentoo.org/ 

None of the files seem to be .iso files. Nor can I find any
documentation that says the file is a live CD, an install CD, or both.

Any suggestions?

Looks like the torrent for the CD you want has no seeds. Try here instead:

   I should have mentioned that I looked at dmesg and saw nothing. The
scanner is not turned on until I need it, so it was not present when the
system last booted.

   Other than the kernel finding USB hubs, the only dmesg related to USB are
two lines at the end:

usb 2-1: new full speed USB device using ohci_hcd and address 4
usb 2-1: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice

which are the same as in /var/log/messages.

   In the 2.4.x kernel days (and earlier), I could test connections (e.g.,
for my PDA) by trying ttyS0-ttyS3. Same with the USB thumb: I could try
mounting ttyUSB0-ttyUSB3 or sda/sda1/sdb/sdb1, etc. until I discovered the
device. With the 2.6.x kernel I've no idea what devices to try. There are no
/dev/sd* or /dev/ttyUSB*.

In all my gentoo builds (except perhaps the first one or two), I have
used a knoppix CD to boot from.  A knoppix CD gives you a better
runtime environment than a gentoo LiveCD.  During the build process,
you use wget, lynx or links to download 2 items: the portage tree and
the stage3 tarball.  The Gentoo Handbook gives you the URL to the
gentoo mirror page at those points in the narrative where you are
meant to download these items.

http://mirror.wrlug.org/knoppix/ is a site-of-last-resort for getting
knoppix.  It's my web server, running on Cox Cable, therefore it's not
terribly fast.

I also have an amd64.  It makes no difference that the knoppix CD is a
32-bit build.  You do all your compiling in a chroot, which is 64-bit.

Not quite -- it is dynamically creating dev nodes based on your parameters.

udev would let you have a /dev/myscanner. You wouldn't need to test
multple dev nodes.

Thanks. I found it mysefl by accident. Turns out the download link that
says livecd-amd64-installer-2006.1 is actuall a folder containing the
torrent, iso, and a couple more files I can't remember. It's all
dowloaded and burned to CD. Now I'm doing OpenSuse 10.2 amd64. However,
that will take all day because it comes only on DVD or multiple CDs. My
plan is to try Fedora also, and straight Debian amd64 once the current
beta is final.

This is incorrect, you can do installs over the network using the mini
iso:

  ftp://ftp.osuosl.org/.1/opensuse/opensuse/distribution/10.2/iso/cd/openSUSE-10.2-GM-x86_64-mini.iso

See http://en.opensuse.org/INSTALL_Internet .

(You can also do a network install using just a vmlinuz image and
initrd, see http://en.opensuse.org/Installation_without_CD )

I hope you find a distribution that meets your needs.

Yes, I am aware of that. But I don't want to install it. I want a live
CD or DVD to take it for a spin first. I don't know who first came up
with the idea of the live/install CD, but it was a good one.

Message-ID: <45F742FF.6090208@comcast.net>

This is a Thunderbird error message I get when I try to get messages
from my work e-mail service on my laptop. The situation is that they use
pop.secureserver.net for incoming e-mail to haskinsnw.com. As the new
kid on the block (I changed real estate companies), and the only one who
uses Thunderbird, I'm the first one to have this problem. Everyone else
uses "lookout" which apparently is not concerned with security problems
like this. My question is, can I somehow tell Thunderbird that this
mismatch is OK? Once I click on "OK" T-bird gets my messages. If I can't
tell T-bird to ignore this, I won't be able to have automatic checking
and retrieving enabled.

Here's the complete message:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Security Error: Domain Name Mismatch

Change your POP hostname to use pop.secureserver.net, then the cert will
be valid. Yes, thunderbird will always complain, as it should :)

mail.haskinsnw.com is an alias for pop.secureserver.net.
pop.secureserver.net has address 64.202.165.92

Never one to let a surreal challenge pass, Keith responds:

Chauvinist!  Time should only be expressed as a 256 bit binary number,
the number of Planck time units ( approximately 5.39121E-44 sec) since
the formation of the One True Quark soon after the Big Bang, and
following the relativistic worldline of that quark.

The One True Quark is located in a hydrogen atom in the cartilage of
my left big toe.  The correct time is:

Bing! 0x00000000000004FA793930BCD112280EBB121164A32C86C88E8D4A516F7DB1A7

Note, there will be a rollover problem at 2^256 Planck times, about
197.8 trillion trillion years from now.  Please make sure your 256
bit Planck-time system libraries properly handle this special case.
Don't forget to account for Proton Savings Time, when you will be
required by law to adjust your clock forwards by one Planck time
at every even rollover, and backwards every odd rollover.

Thanks. That solved the problem. I'll pass it along to the office

It's daylight "saving" time not "daylight "savings" time. Think of it as

Linux Clinic!
Sunday March 18  (third Sunday)
1PM at Free Geek
1731 SE 10th Avenue  (southeast door)
Portland, OR

Bring your Linux machine and we will help you fix it, or install
that new app, or...  We have monitors, keyboards, meece, network
connections, wireless, and some install disks.   No classes, no
instruction, just pure neighborly tweaking and debugging.  We
might not get it all done, but we will have a good time.

And if you know it all already, bring your machine and show
others how it is done.

I have a couple of extra Netgear WG511T (Atheros) PCMCIA wifi
cards that work with Linux.  Better than all those brandX cards.
I may auction them, proceeds to Free Geek.

And if that does not convince you, John often brings cookies.

Subject: [PLUG] Download Fedora Core 6?
Message-ID: <20070314172656.ec11fad4.johnxj@comcast.net>

I want a live/install CD or DVD of Fedora Core 6 amd64. The first
problem is that this may not exist, but I can't be sure because there
are no descriptions with the .iso images that I can find online for
FC6. I can find them for amd64, but it never says if it is just an
install .iso or if it is also a live CD or DVD.

The second problem is that, assuming a live/install CD or DVD is
available, where can I find it so it will download at a decent speed? I
found an .iso at UofO OS labs, but it downloaded at 20K/s. Elsewhere I
found a torrent of the same .iso, but it was no better. I got that kind
of download speed five years ago with telephone dialup. It will take
three days for a DVD at that rate.

I don't want to install. I just want a live CD or DVD to check it out
with. Does such exist and, if so, where is a good place to get it?

FC6 does not have an integrated live CD, this is planned for FC7 as I
understand it.  There is a separate live CD available at
http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/projects/live/, but
that'll probably take forever to download.

Try mirrors.kernel.org, I always get good download speeds from them.

I have live/install CD or DVD for Gentoo, Dapper, Feisty and Suse 10.2, all amd64. All but Dapper are on my hard disk so I can make you a copy if you wish (bring some blank media). Live/install CD and DVD are great for trying out different distros without messing up your current installation.

The site below has what they call the live-spin edition. Ships from 
Franc in 4 or 5 days.
I have ordered from them several times. They even put up the Ubuntu 
Christmas Edition for me when I requested it.

That's only the i386 version. I want the amd64 version.

Thanks anyway. I'll wait for 7.0. Unless I can find a place to download
the 64-bit version before next summer.

By the way, just to back up that claim that FC7 will have live CDs,
take a look at this:

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/7/MustHave

Interestingly, they not only claim the install media will be live CDs,
but also they will have the tools/docs needed to spin your own custom
live CD in a snap.

I'd take you up on that except that, as Jason said, FC6 is an install
only, not live. Assuming that is true, I'll wait for FC7. I might
install it, but I want to take it for a spin first. Thanks anyway.

PLUG people, I have a few systems that contains a number of test

testred, testgreen, etc. These user accounts come and go with some
frequency. I would like to setup sudo to allow certain users to run any

User_Alias        SUPPORT_USERS = %support

SUPPORT_USERS  TEST_SERVERS = (test*,apache,tomcat) NOPASSWD: ALL
This does not seem to be working as I expect. Can anyone help?

Thanks in advance.

   I resolved this issue. The Xsane FAQ had the answer: the permissions on
/proc/bus/usb/001/00x were restricted to root. Changing that to a+rw solved
the problem.

   On a more permanent basis (since that goes away when the scanner is
unplugged/turned off or the system rebooted), I added users to the scanner group
in /etc/group.

   Once that was done, Xsane found the device.

   BTW, if anyone is using xsane-0.993 and does not have color management
built in, the application crashes as soon as it starts to scan. Go to the
xsane.org web site and grab the source tarball for 0.994 where that problem
(and a PostScript issue) has been fixed. Slackware-11.0 package available.

You could try using .* instead of * but I think sudoers doesn't support
wildcards or regexes in usernames.  Can you simply add the test users to
a group that has the correct permissions?

I went and looked at that and it is, indeed, interesting. I wonder if
one could set up a live CD with special drivers and config files
required for the user's personal hardware -- e.g., setting up
ndiswrapper. If so, it would make it easy to create a custom rescue CD.
In fact, what if one could set up the user's account, mount ~/ and be
able to work completely off the live CD. I am thinking of a situation
where I have homework files created in OOo and suddenly OOo breaks just
before a paper is due. No prob -- just boot to my personal live CD, OOo
on the live CD would see its config files in ~/.openoffice2.org, and I
could just work as though nothing happened. An interesting concept.

I did decide to download F7 Test 2 live CD that was posted on March 2.
Unfortunately, there is only an i386 version of the live CD so far. But
it might still be interesting. Download speed is only 25K/s, but that
is another issue I want to ask about in another thread. If anyone wants
a copy, sing out.

We could add all the users explicitely, but the accounts come and go, so it
would be best to configure it once with a wildcard than to maintain it as
the accounts change.

Subject: [PLUG] Torrents of confusion
Message-ID: <20070315153322.8780446f.johnxj@comcast.net>

I have been downloading live/install ISOs for differrent distros lately. I use Ktorrent, which allows me to see a lot of detail about what is going on. My cable connection here is generally good -- if a server can send me data fast enough I have seen download speeds of 5-600K/s and upload speeds of 150K/s or so. I understand the basics of how torrents work, but the download/upload results I get with torrents are not making any sense in a number of ways.

As I write this I am doing the following:
F7-test2-livecd-i386.iso 27 seeders, 2 leechers, avg download speed 25K/s, avg upload speed .5K/s, share ratio .02
*feisty-desktop-amd64.iso, 2 peers, avg download speed 56K/s, avg upload speed 8.5K/s, share ratio 7.83
*livecd-amd64-installer-2006.1 [Gentoo], 1 peer, avg download speed 43K/s, avg upload speed 5K/s 1.23
*openSUSE-10.2-GM-DVD-x86_64.iso, 48 peers, avg download speed 81K/s, avg upload speed 30.5K/s, share ratio .94
*ubuntu-6.06.1-desktop-i386, 2 peers, avg upload speed 3.5K/s, share ratio 1.01

* = 100% downloaded, just seeding

There are several things that do not make sense:

1) I started all these downloads about five days ago. Why have I shared 7.83 times for feisty and only 1.01 for the i386 of Dapper? Surely the i386 of Dapper would be way more popular than the amd64 of feisty, right?

2) Why is F7-test2 downloading at only 25K/s when there are 27 seeders with 100% to offer, and only two leechers besides me?

3) At this moment I am averaging a total of 30-35K/s upload and 25K/s download, yet my internet connection is lagged into next week. When I click to send this e-mail it will take about 1.5 minutes to find the server, another minute for authentication and handshaking, and another minute to transmit. That's for ONE e-mail, a process that normally takes 15-20 seconds. And web pages load so slowly the glaciers will be completely melted before some of them appear. I have enough bandwidth that the up-and downloading I am doing should be almost unnoticeable. And I know it's something with the torrents because if I close down Ktorrent my internet connection goes back to normal. I don't even have to close it down -- just hitting the Stop button returns me to normal operation. What is sucking up my bandwidth?

Probably the uploads, believe it or not.  TCP requires acknowledgments
to operate correctly and includes a backoff mechanism when it detects
congestion based on drops and retransmissions.  If your uploads are
sucking up all your upstream bandwidth (which is less than downstream
bandwidth for most broadband connections), then ACK messages will get
lost/dropped, and congestion control will kick in.

Bittorrent is a great concept, but unless you have a router that does
quality of service traffic shaping, bittorrent uploads will definitely
kill your outbound traffic speeds, and by doing so will also kill your
download speeds.

I should add that your bittorrent client should have a mechanism to
rate limit upload speeds, so you can set it to something below your
upload speed for your broadband connection.  Remember to save room for
TCP/IP/Ethernet/etc. headers, so do something like 50%, which will
leave room for other traffic (i.e. email and http) and traffic
overhead like headers.

Thanks, that was a big help. Ktorrent's options are the following, together with what the defaults were when I opened the settings page ("0" is unlimited):

Queue manager
	Max downloads	0
	Maximum seeds	0
Preferences
	Max connections per torrent	0
	Global connection limit		0
	Maximum upload rate		0
	Maximum download rate	0
	Port						6881
	UDP tracker port			4444
	Number of upload slots		0
	Max share ratio			0

I changed the Maximum Upload Rate to 50 and it didn't make any difference. Then I dropped it to 25 and it made a big difference -- everything else was working much better, plus the download rate on F7-test2 went from an average of 25K/s up to 60+K/s. Finally, I set the maximum number of upload slots to 10 and the Maximum Upload Speed back to 50, and it seemed to be the same. Then I left the slots at 10 and dropped the upload speed back to 25. That was even better.

So now I guess I need to tweak these settings to maximize my own download while maintaining good torrent citizenship. Thanks for the pointers. Some day I may figure this all out.

Fedora fans are gonna love this --

I downloaded F7-test2 and burned it to a CD, then rebooted. The initial
screen offered to run it from the CD or from RAM. I'm not sure if it
detected that I have 1.25 GB on this computer or whether that screen
appears for everybody. I told it to run it from RAM. Then I waited
several minutes while it read the 684 MB from the CD.

The good news is that F7-test2 was great at detecting and configuring
hardware. Until now the only distro that always automatically found my
nVidia graphics and set my screen up to 1680 x 1050 was Ubuntu. No
more. Add Fedora 7 to the list!

Not only that, it found the Bluetooth and wireless adapters. The
wireless looked like it should work, but it couldn't find any networks.
My neighbors' networks are visible, although I can't connect to them.
F7 couldn't even see them. But neither could Ubuntu until I installed
ndsiwrapper. I'm sure if I actually installed F7 I could get the
wireless working wit ndiswrapper the same way I did in Edgy.

The desktop is Gnome 2.17.something. (I knew I should have written it
down -- it was later than what I have on Edgy is all I can remember.)

I launched Firefox and noted that it was 2.0, and it ran very fast, but
there was no Flash or other plugins. I tried a lot of the other
applications that came with it and everything worked except AbiWord,
which crashed on launching 100% of the time. Bad news: OpenOffice is
not on the CD. And you can't access any repositories so you can't
install anything, even though you have plenty of RAM to do so.

Bear in mind that this is the i386 version because they haven't
finished the amd64 live CD yet. So the 64-bit version may not work
quite as well. On the other hand, I think Feisty has some competition
on the way.

I'm more of a BSD person, and rarely install X (read almost never) for

it on my laptop.  The install initially shows up on my laptop display 
but when X finally loads, you need an external display to see it.  Other 
than this, it installed ok and things seem to be working fine.  Is this 
normal?  I need some direction in solving this.  I'm using the 6.10

Steve,

   I've not tried that, but I had a similar problem a while ago with video
from reuters.com. All I got was a Microsoft ad; the news clip didn't follow.
I wrote to the webmaster and a few days later it was fixed. No ads.

   I've tried to view a few CNN videos, but they require Winduhs. So, I don't
try any longer.

  I can view the CNN videos and the CNN streaming "Pipeline" stuff on
my FC5 machine.  I'm using Firefox with the embedded MPlayer.  The
trick is to set the MPlayer config setting to "Video Output = X11".

I can, but I don't know why anyone would want to do so!

I found one of their video links and it played an 18 second ad twice (!) 
and then played some earth-shattering news footage of a squirrel 
waterskiing.

Steve,

   In ~/.mplayer/config vo = xv,x11. That should be the equivalent.

   However, just for giggles, I switched the order of those two RHS variables
and took it for a test drive. Gxine came up, not mplayer, but after closing
the extra firefox window, the gxine window came alive.

Thanks,

Rich

It sounds like a firewall or router problem.

1) What kind of router do you have?
2) Are you forwarding bittorrent ports to your host?
3) What type of firewall?
4) Which ISP?

  It's not really for me.  I've built a few Linux boxen for
girlfriends over the last couple of years.  One of the ladies has been
bugging me about the KGW videos every since I got the multi-media
plugins installed.  She wants to see the water squirrels and local
news clips.

  Interesting?  I've been using the MPlayer plugin.  Do the KGW videos
work with the Gxine plugin?

I have found two things that will cause the problems he is reporting.

1) if you are saturating the upload speed, download speed will drop on DSL.
Annoying, but true.  Seems to be just the way DSL works.

2) If your router has a small NAT buffer, it will get swamped and slow
down.  (BitTorrent tends to generate a huge number of connections.)
Sometimes a router update will fix this.  (If you have a Cisco home
router/firewall getting an update will fix this problem for the most part.)

Hope that helps.

Subject: [PLUG] Any advise re color laser printer.  Xerox 85xx? HP?
Message-ID: <45FB23C6.2060908@TemporalArts.com>

I am interested in replacing my old Lexmark Optra laser printer with a 
color laser printer.

It's primary job is a low-to-moderate amount of standard office printing 
(duplex required) where reasonable cost per page is important.

I wanted to go with color because I also do a fair amount of 
photographic/graphics printing but I do
I have an Epson 2000P inkjet I use now use for that.

I'd love tabloid size but that seems to bump the price way up.

I was looking at the Xerox 8550/DN (when the rebates had them available 
for $499) or the newer 8560/DN which use the solid-ink technology.  They 
seem to have a nice clean design and the solid-ink *seems* like a good idea.

I was wondering if anyone has experience with these models?

I was also looking at the HP printers was worried I'd go broke buying 
replacement cartridges for them.  Any experience with these (especially 
the typical cost per page)

Thanks

As Jason, said this is due to the limiting of ACKs; the deep queuing
of DSL plus the fact that its usually asymmetric in favor of down
speeds means the ACKs just don't get there fast enough. I usually just
limit BT uploads to ~75-90% of my DSL upload capacity with good
results for interactive performance (read: ssh and web browsing) and
thus maintain marital bliss.

This might help too:

I have a Xerox 6250DN at work that works really well, total workhorse. There
is some banding in the colors, but that is typical of color lasers of its'
era. Assuming things haven't gone substantially downhill since the 6250 was
built, the Xerox should be a solid bet.

I recently bought an HP Color LaserJet 2605dn based on a previous
recommendation on this list.  It fits within your price range, thought
I haven't had it long enough to know about supply costs.  It isn't the
fastest thing around for black and white, but it is single pass so
color and black and white are about the same speed.  I think the only
thing I don't like about it so far is it chooses to re-calibrate
randomly, which is annoying in a home (I don't want it to recalibrate
in the middle of the night when I'm sleeping).

Feature-wise it has 10/100 networking, 64MB of memory, and a built-in
duplexer.  You can get a model that comes with an additional high
capacity tray for slightly more, but that wasn't necessary for our
use.  Compatible with my wife's XP machine, my Mac OS X, and the Linux
machine of whoever made the original recommendation.

Gah!  I didn't mean to be content-free, just a dick!

I'm using mplayer-plugin and firefox with no particularly special 
configuration (that I can recall).  Remember, though, that it does play 
the ad twice and that almost had me convinced that it was just going to 
loop until I just waited it out.

So that's mplayerplug-in-wmp.so doing the windows media emulation in 
mplayerplug-in 3.31.

Hello all,

I sent these questions to {info,sales}@freegeek.org, but thought people
here might know the answer,too.

I noticed that one can obtain a Linux computer (FreekBox) by either
volunteering for the Build Program or the Adopt a Computer program.  Can
one also purchase a FreekBox?  If so, do they come with support?

Hi, I'm new here and haven't posted before,  but here is my  2 bits  worth.
I used to have  a Sony  Viao  laptop  with  the same  apparent  problem.
Savage Virge chipset IIRC. The  fix for  me was  to  sneak  into  the
filesystem using  another  distro,  Puppy being  my  personal  favorite
rescue  system,  and edit  xorg.conf  to  read  "vesa"  for  the video
driver.  It  worked  every time.  Meaning  I'm  a distro  hopper.  It
occured  to  me  later  on  that  I  could  also  have  done  the  same
edit  B4  rebooting  into  the  installed  system,  but  don't  actually
recall  if  I  ever  tried  that.

The solid ink printers make great prints, but in the past they have been
better suited to moderate to high volume environments.  The old units
that I have experience with would take a while to warm up, and waste some
ink in the process.  Thus it was better to leave them on continuously,
such as one might do in an office.  Today's printers have no doubt
improved.  If you are seriously considering solid ink, I could find 
out from how today's models perform.

PLUG Advanced Topics Meeting

March 19th, 2007 at 7pm

Jax Bar
826 SW 2nd Avenue Portland, Oregon

Speaker:   Randal Schwartz
           Stonehenge Consulting

Topic:     mod_perl

Abstract:	

What do sites like amazon.com, Ticketmaster, Citysearch, Slashdot, Wired
News, and PBS Online have in common?  They all run mod_perl behind the
scenes.  So does the Internet Movie Database, and almost everything
ending in "perl.org", and probably a lot more that you've visited
recently. mod_perl embeds the number one scripting language (Perl) into
the number one web server (Apache) to provide far more than just a quick
content delivery system... You can control and enhance every aspect of
the web delivery, from deciding which page to serve to whom, down to
logging interesting and unusual things.  Randal presents a brief
overview of mod_perl, including how to get it and what it can do for
you.

I have used the 8550/DN at work and it is a great printer. I really  
like that the ink cartridges are blocks and a quick "lifting the  
hood" gives you visual confirmation of the levels. Each color slot  
holds 4 blocks of ink and it sure is nice how little space the spares  
take up. Galen is right about leaving the solid ink units on as they  
keep a pool of melted ink and have to melt it when cold starting.

Unfortunately, our main use required a switch to a laser so we now  
have the 8550/DN sitting idle. If you are still in the market,  
contact me off-list.

I specifically *got rid of* a solid ink printer and replaced it with
an $500 hp2605dn (dn = duplexer, network) .  Yes, the supplies are
outrageous for the HP, and the toner cartridges are chipped, which
means that third-party toner usually won't work.  However, it is
Postscript (very important to me), prints beautifully, and is quiet
and low power - 17 watts idle, 300 watts printing ordinary paper,
perhaps 1KW printing labels and card stock.  It does recalibrate
from time to time, but that has never gotten in my way.  It goes
from idle to first print in seconds.

The device I got rid of was a Xerox Phaser 350 (an early model,
granted) for which I had a printer-and-a-half worth of spare parts,
and a lifetime supply of ink blocks from the Tektronix surplus store.
The damned thing would jam, misfeed paper, and streak.  I had one
printer head nozzle clog, requiring the replacement of the whole
fiendishly complicated and expensive head (hence -0.5 printer's worth
of spare parts).  If the power quit unexpectedly, it would sometimes
return to service flashing an error code that required opening covers
and turning the wheels inside.  I hope that the 8550 is designed better.

But what really soured me on the machine was the startup delay and
the power.  From a cold start, it required 10 minutes at 1000 watts
to heat the wax reservoir;  keeping the reservoir hot took 300 watts
continuously, while actually printing consumed 1000 watts.  After a
few hours, it goes into cold idle, necessitating another 10 minute
delay for the next print.  During the startup process, it calibrates
and cleans, and dumps about 5% of an ink block into the maintenance
tray while it cleans the pipes.  So if you did not have a lifetime
supply of ink blocks, the costs would mount up fast.  I figured it
was costing me $150 a year just to keep the damned thing ready to
print something.   Oh, and the wax-surface copies it made could not
be auto-fed through a copier.  Again, I hope the 8550 works better.

My ideal printer would be just like the hp2605dn (duplexer, network,
postscript, fast, low power, reliable) but with non-chipped toner
cartridges.  I imagine that some clever software hacker could make
my hp2605dn into my ideal printer by changing a few bytes of the
firmware, so it ignores the toner cartridge chips, and I hope
someone out there is thinking about how to do that.

Oh boy!  A second announcement!

Linux Clinic!
Sunday March 18  (third Sunday)
1PM at Free Geek ( 12PM for DST uncorrected windows machines )
1731 SE 10th Avenue  (southeast door)
Portland, OR

Bring your Linux machine and we will help you fix it, or install
that new app, or...  We have monitors, keyboards, meece, network
connections, wireless, and some install disks.   No classes, no
instruction, just pure neighborly tweaking and debugging.  We
might not get it all done, but we will have a good time.

And if you know it all already, bring your machine and show
others how it is done.  Extra Geek Points for doing it correctly.

I have a couple of extra Netgear WG511T (Atheros) 90mW super-G
PCMCIA wifi cards that work with Linux.  Better than all those
brandX cards which we take out to the street to stomp on.  I
may auction them, proceeds to Free Geek.

And if that does not convince you, John will bring cookies.

Keith

P.S. At 5PM, people will be showing up to take Linux certification
exams, so we will clear out promptly to leave them the space.

Subject: [PLUG] DVD Burning
Message-ID: <20070318000641.2078f924.johnxj@comcast.net>

My Ubuntu amd64 Edgy laptop has a 16x CD/DVD+RW drive. I thought the
capacity of this drive was 4.7 GB on regular DVD+R media. I am trying
to burn 4.1 GB of data to a blank DVD on it. I have:

K3b
GnomeBaker
Nautilus
Bonfire

K3b announced that it could not burn one of the files (4.0 GB) because
the total was over 4.0 GB. 

GnomeBaker has a progress bar thingy to show how much the total files
that I selected will take up on the disk. The display showed plenty of
free space. It happily burned the entire thing to the DVD. When I
ejected and reinserted the DVD, the 3.9 GB file was missing. Thanks for
warning me.

Nautilus -- Ditto GnomeBaker, except it didn't have goodies like panel
icons showing the progress. And it wouldn't burn it faster than 2x.

Bonfire -- Ditto GnomeBaker.

Before I make any more coasters:

1) Is there a way to determine how much data I can put on a DVD in this
drive?

2) Is there any other DVD burning software besides the above?

I found the problem, but not the solution.

The problem is in mkisofs, which cannot handle a file greater than 4.0
GB. Googling, I found complaints from as long ago as 2002 that it could
not handle file sizes greater than 2.0 GB. Starting about 2004 the
complaints changed to 4.0 GB. It is now three years since the file size
limit was raised to 4.0 GB and evidently there is no fix yet. There are
also a lot of complaints that the directory structure was too deep for
it, although that was not my problem.

It may be that this is related to Joliet or something else in the
eldritch world of optical media filesystems.

Has anyone else experienced this and/or found a solution?

Thanks Paul, that got things on the correct display.  But isn't this 
just forcing a generic driver?  I didn't exactly do any performance 
testing before, but even moving windows around seems choppy now.

Or just look in the manual on how to override this setting.  It has to 
be redone each time you put in a new cartridge.  But it's in there.  Not 
all printers allow this, but that one does.

On debian systems there is a package named dvd+rw-tools which has a tool
called growisofs which works nicely for DVDs here.

The man page gives quite a few examples of how to use the program to
burn images from files and/or image files.

Indeed you are correct!  Page 134 of the User's Guide - "Cartridge
Out Override".  The printer will no longer estimate how full the
cartridges are, and you might run out of one of the colors while
printing, but one can estimate from the copy counter when a toner
refill will be needed.  So far, I've only used 10% of the toner, but
all the levels are dropping at approximately the same rate, which 
means that if one color runs out then all of them will be close to
needing a refill.

So, I guess this moves the hp2605dn printer from "good" to "ideal". 
Big grin.  Now I will talk all the rest of you into buying one, so
we can buy replacement toner in 55 gallon drums.  And if I can
replace the black toner cheaply, I may just retire my black-and-white
HP4M+, and use the 2605 for small black-and-white tasks, too.

Thanks. I read the man page for growisofs, but it was kind of hard to
figure out. Evidently it is a front end for mkisofs.

The part I don't get is, assuming that growisofs is the solution, why
the GUIs (GnomeBaker, K3b, etc.) use only mkisofs. Growisofs has been
around for a couple years, so I would assume that it would be
incorporated into existing programs.

Oh well. I found a solution. I made the file into a .tar.gz which
brought it to just under 4.0 GB. K3b is happily writing it to DVD as I
write this. That gets me by for now, but the problem remains for the
future. And I was planning on building myself a desktop with a
double-layer drive. Wonder how people write to those?

So if K3b can use growisofs, what was the problem with the 4.1 GB file?
I bet the version of growisofs that it is using is a version that was
created to solve the >2GB problem, and now growisofs needs to be
updated to handle >4GB.

Subject: Save the date! BarCamp Portland Tech Unconference, May 11-12

I am pleased to announce that BarCamp is coming to Portland on May 11-12! We 
will also be kicking off the regular DemoCamp event series during BarCamp to 
highlight tech startup activity in the Portland area.

Tech + Geek + Culture. The event for the Portland tech community, produced BY 
the Portland tech community.

What is BarCamp? It is an ad-hoc gathering born from the desire for people to 
share and learn in an open environment. It is an intense event with 
discussions, demos, and interaction from participants.

BarCamp is a FREE event and the content is determined by the attendees. The 
event will be hosted at CubeSpace, which has a number of conference rooms for 
breakout sessions, a large main meeting area, wireless access, easy access to 
public transportation, bike storage, and ample parking. Thanks to Eva and David 
at CubeSpace for signing up as space sponsors for the event (and to Ray at 
AboutUs for sponsoring the additional space costs).

We need your help to make BarCamp Portland a fantastic event for the tech 
community in Portland. Here's what you can do...

1) Forward this email on to people in the Portland area that may have an 
interest in attending. As we have done little marketing of the event (so far), 
assume that your local tech social network doesn't know about it yet.

2) If you have not already added yourself to the BarCamp Portland wiki page as 
an attendee, please do so. This will help us get a more accurate attendance 
count and plan accordingly (you want food, right?):

http://barcamp.org/BarCampPortland

3) Add a session idea for the event. This could be a talk, a demo, a roundtable 
discussions - whatever! Please add it to the Proposed Sessions section on the 
wiki page:

http://barcamp.org/BarCampPortland

4) Attend the BarCamp Portland Meetup this Thursday (03/22) evening 5:30-8pm at 
Jive Software downtown. Free beer on tap (thanks, Jive!), the opportunity to 
network with the tech community in Portland, and help plan for BarCamp 
Portland. More details:

http://barcamp.org/BarCampPortlandMeetups

5) Help identify sponsors. CubeSpace and AboutUs are already onboard as 
sponsors for the space and related costs (and Jive Software has been our 
ongoing meetup and planning sponsor). We are looking for sponsors to cover 
food, drinks, and t-shirts.

I hope to see you this Thursday evening at Jive Software for our monthly tech 
meetup and BarCamp Portland planning meeting!

PS: If this isn't your type of thing and you want off my BarCamp Portland 
mailing list, please reply to this email. I will only do a few mailings before 
the event in May (and this list will never be used for commercial purposes).

I tried 'java -jar <filename>.jar' on a .jar file I have and it worked
as expected. Does the .jar file you have require a particular version of
java? Mine specifies that I need JDK 1.4 or later. On my machine, java
-version reports java version "1.5.0_07".

Rich,

If I am understanding your question correctly, it seems that the java
executable is not in your $PATH. I am not sure where your install put things
but you should be able to do a locate (if you have run an updatedb recently)
or just do a find. 

You can either use the fully qualified path to the executable or add the
java bin directory to your PATH variable in your profile.

Doug

Most java programs also expect at least JAVA_HOME to point to the location
of the base of where the java SDK.

Nice thing about the java SDK packages is that you can drop it
anywhere and just point to
it with JAVA_HOME and a path to the $JAVA_HOME/bin.

Dick,

   That's what I expected, too. But, it didn't happen.

   I've no idea. One of the reasons I prefer to stay away from java apps is
that they're frequently java-version specific.

   There is no 'java' on this box. But, when I query the package list, it
returns what I originally reported: jdk-1_5_0_09.

Doug,

   Ah, yes. It is hidden in /usr/lib/java/bin/. So I made a softlink and it
works.

   Don't know why I didn't see it the first time I ran locate, but I didn't.

   And it's pointing to the incorrect path. Must be left over from when I
switched from Red Hat to Slackware.

Well, yes it is.  That's always been good enough for my purposes. It seems
likely your card is capable of better performance, but I've never had one
like it.  My current laptop uses the ATI Radeon Express 200M, and it seems
pretty smooth.  PCLinuxOS 2007 is my distro of choice for now, and it is
using the "ati" driver .  Did your xorg.conf use the "ati" driver
originally?  It's possible you may get what you want using a Modeline in
your "Monitor" section.

Mine is : ModeLine "1280x800_50"  68.56  1280 1336 1472 1664  800 801 804
824  -HSync +Vsync  Try that at your own risk, since I don't know what a
wildly incorrect modeline will do to an LCD screen.  Most likely nothing,
but maybe someone else knows for sure.

That's on a lapop with a 15.4" WXGA Screen.  I've never seen the _50 in
modeline before.  No idea what it does.
OpenSuse 10.2 and Ubuntu 6.10 also work fine with this hardware.  Sound is
another issue, however.  I hope someone with more expertise can jump in
here.  I've reached the limit of my knowledge.

Probably you would do best with updated information directly from Free
Geek, but when I volunteered there last year (in the Build Program), we
built three types of boxes, depending upon the specs:  FreekBoxes for
the volunteers, boxes to be donated to other non-profits, and boxes to
sell in the store.  AFAIK, there's no support available specifically for
boxes people purchase from the store, but there's no official support
for FreekBoxes either.  It's pretty much a community-based effort,
meaning if you need support you can ask around for help and make use of
whatever resources Free Geek has.  And of course, there's the PLUG
Clinic for support.

But if you mean, is there an 800# to call?, I don't think so.  All boxes
built there are tested, meaning they should be in working order when you
take them home.  Beyond that, it's a kind of DIY thing.

That's all to the best of my recollection, anyway.

Subject: [PLUG] Partition confusion
Message-ID: <20070319092933.cfffdac2.johnxj@comcast.net>

I have a 160 GB external USB drive. Until now it has been hanging on my
Windows 2000 desktop. When I acquired the drive over a year ago I used
the disk utility in Windows 2000 to create two NTFS partitions of ~75
GB. I have decided I want to move it back and forth between the Windows
desktop and my Linux laptop, each of which would have a partition it
could recognize to use for backups. Therefore, I want to reformat the
second partition as ext3.

This morning I moved it to the Linux laptop, where gparted recognized
it as /dev/sdf and said it had 1019 MiB unallocated. Gparted saw no
other partitions. I googled, and apparently MiB are mebibytes, which is
close to the same thing as a megabyte, so gparted was saying there was
about 1 GB unallocated. I'll leave the issue of why we need a new term
that no one understands for a later philosophical discussion.

Figuring that the 1 GB unallocated was just some left over space, I
moved it back to the Windows 2000 desktop and deleted the second
partition. Then I brought it back to the laptop, where gparted still
says there is 1019 MiB unallocated. Gparted is not seeing the remaining
NTFS partition, and is lying about the unallocated space. However, I
selected the 1019 MiB and clicked on New, to see what would happen if I
tried to create a new disk label. Gparted said that a new disk label
was required in order to create a partition and that setting one would
delete all data from /dev/sdf. This isn't making any sense to me at
all. I don't care if gparted and Linux can't see the NTFS partition,
but how can I get it to recognize the correct free space so I can
create a partition on it and format it ext3?

Subject: [PLUG] Special Topics Workshops for PLUG?
Message-ID: <20070319164154.GB17309@gate.kl-ic.com>


PLUG has three monthly gatherings - the general meeting, advanced 
topics, and linux clinic.  I propose a fourth meeting, scheduled
as the need appears and when an organizer volunteers:

Special Topics Workshop

The special topics workshop is for installing and configuring
specific pieces of software.  Examples might include  VMware,
Mediawiki, Samba, ndiswrapper or video codecs.  The workshop would
follow a format that would be a blend of Advanced Topics and Linux
Clinic; perhaps an hour devoted to a lecture/demonstration, followed
by an hour of install and an hour of configuration and testing.
Attendees are be expected to read up in advance, look onlines for 
potential problems with their particular distro and setup,  and
download prerequisites and dependencies if possible, then bring
their machines and be ready to work.  Each of the workshops would
need an organizer to arrange for experts to be there, and perhaps
a facilitator to arrange the facility in advance.  The setup we
use for Linux Clinic at Free Geek might work, but that depends now
on having Rick babysit us (thanks, Rick!) as a representative of
Free Geek.  We could also just devote particular clinics to these
topics, but folks wanting to work on general problems would have
to wait for the next month.

This should be a "demand-pull" arrangement;  individuals wanting
to learn about a particular topic will have to do a lot of legwork
to get a workshop set up.  Because not many PLUG members find the
time to volunteer, this might not work out, or happen only rarely. 
On the other hand, this might appeal to some of you, and be the
way you want to give back to PLUG.  Ideas?

Can you plug the external drive into your linux machine, run this
script, and then post the contents of output.txt:

true ; ( set -x
cat /etc/issue.net
uname -a
cat /proc/partitions
fdisk -l
true ) >& output.txt

The above script should give a clearer picture of what your drive looks
like.

Regards,

This also might be a good backup for when our speaker drops out at the 
last minute.

And that might happen tonight.  Randal is in the middle of a project.  If 
it goes south at the last minute, he may be working on fixing it instead 
of speaking at AT.

Keith,

   How about adding mythTV or another PVR? That might attract a crowd.

   In general, I think it's a good idea.

I think Keith's point is that these events will be driven by the people
who want them. Get enough folks to be interested in mythTV and organize
the event.

I do too. And I'll be willing to participate in the organization of some
of them as my schedule permits.

This sort idea has crossed my mind several times. In my head I was
calling this new type of gathering "PLUG Classroom". It would be
organized like typical technical instruction with a mix of lecture
and lab time. It would meet at most once a month but not necessarily
every month.

To be practical it would require a three or four hour block of time,
which likely means on the weekend. Classroom-ish facilities would be
helpful.

When classroom instruction fails its usually because of lack of
preparation by the instructor or the students. To help the students
its important to get the prerequisites published well in advance.
This should include knowledge the student is expected to have, and
the requirements for the student's computer (installed s/w etc.)
in cases where they are bringing their own computers.

You can buy a StoreBox at a decent price ($50 to $150).  There is
no support.  Some folks drag in their store/freek boxes to the Linux
Clinic and we help them there, sometimes.  Others ask on mailing
lists.  There are organizations that provide professional support
for $$$, but that support will be cheaper if you buy the machines
and run the software they suggest.

Support requires human attention, and that is rarely free.  We help
each other out on this mailing list;  that means we give each other
more than we get, though a few people here haven't figured that out
yet. :-/   Help us, and we are more likely to help you.

I must say that I am simply overwhelmed by the whole Freegeeks concept.  
It is the Habitat For Humanity of the cyberworld, and I just wish I was 
more adept and proficient at both the hardware and software end of 
things, so that I could make a more substantial contribution to the 
whole enterprise.

Most people don't realize just how life-altering a modest computer and 
an internet connection can be for a kid starting out or a family on the 
margin.  Thanks to the work Freegeeks does, every motivated young person 
in the Portland metropolitan area has the opportunity to acquire his own 
computer.

When you think about it, it is simply amazing. You guys can't be thanked 
enough.

The published Freegeek Thrift store policy says one free support consult for
a StoreBox.  It also says
that 'special configurations', i.e. Freekboxen, might also be available
occasionally, but unpredictably.

I'm not sure what that means.  I understand that if I buy a StoreBox it
comes without support from FreeGeek.  Fair enough.  But let's say I want
to connect my StoreBox to the internet via DSL.  Although I could
probably do it myself, let's say I'd rather just pay someone to do it
(e.g. like Geek Squad.)  Is there anyone I can call to do it for me?  If
so, who?

It would be nice if FreeGeek had a list of referrals. Or do they and I
just haven't found it yet?

Thanks for the links.

Out of curiosity, how did you get to the wiki page from the main
www.freegeek.org website?  I eventually found it via Google shortly
before you posted.

VMWare is a product that emulates an (x86-based, afaik) computer in
software, so you can run multiple OSes simultaneously.

This brings up something that's been gnawing at me for a while... I
was out of the hardware/tech loop for a while, and I don't know where
to start with the new Virtualization "stuff" that's available.  I
don't know if that would be a good topic for a workshop (maybe an
advanced topics meeting?) but it's something I'd love to have a
tutorial on :)

There isn't an obvious one that I can find.  I just have the wiki page link
in my tool bar,
http://wiki.freegeek.org .  I volunteer there a lot and keep a running
log/journal in the wiki.
The only link from freegeek.org that I have come across is the reference
'Here are some
introductory materials' in the Coders paragraph on the Volunteers page.  I
don't know why
they haven't included the link on the main page (can you say 'volunteer
organization'?).

There's quite a bit of "new Virtualization stuff", so you might need
to be more specific, but a good place to start (assuming you mean x86
virtualization) would be Wikipedia:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization

My latest experiences are only with Linux hosts running Linux virtual 
machiness, but I can tell you the Debian "etch" makes the process of 
getting Debian VMs up and running quite simple. I'll try to get a 
HOWTO online, though my schedule has been, er, hectic lately.

To libparted (the library for which gparted is a front end), 'disk label'
means
'partition table'.  You were directing it to create a new partition
table, and so to
wipe out all previous partition definitions.  I don't know why gparted is
confused
about what partitions are or are not defined.  Robert suggested 'sudo fdisk
-l /dev/sdf'
to list the partitions.  You could also try 'sudo parted /dev/sdf print' to
see what
libparted thinks of the partition table.  (parted is a cli front end to
libparted, not
otherwise related to gparted, afaik).

First, I ran Robert's script. Nothing happened. No output. The cursor
just made a new line in the terminal window and that was it.

Next, I ran the following, and you can see that it still gets me
nowhere:

jjj at Devil5:~$ sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdf
jjj at Devil5:~$ ./USB_drive_script
jjj at Devil5:~$ sudo parted /dev/sdf print
Error: Unable to open /dev/sdf - unrecognised disk
label. Information: Don't forget to update /etc/fstab, if
necessary.             

jjj at Devil5:~$ sudo parted /dev/sdf print
Error: Unable to open /dev/sdf - unrecognised disk
label. Information: Don't forget to update /etc/fstab, if
necessary. jjj at Devil5:~$ 

Not sure what else to do. I'm wondering if I took it back to the Windows
2000 desktop and recreated partition 2 that I deleted earlier, and
formatted it FAT32, the FAT32 partition should be visible to Linux. But
I shouldn't have to do that.

The script will have created a file called "output.txt" in the
directory you were in when you ran it -- everything of interest will
be in there.

( the >& output.txt part of the script is the indicator -- ">&" takes
everything that would normally show up on screen and puts into
whatever comes next, in this case, the file output.txt)

   For some reason, acroread left my notebook. I downloaded the latest
version (7.0.9) from Adobe's site; it's now labeled as _enu_ rather than
_en_; perhaps this refers to unicode support.

   Anywho, I installed it on the notebook as always, but when I try to run it
I get a continuing string of 'syntax error' messages. Since I've not before
had any problems installing and running acroread, I'm at a loss what might
have happened.

   Suggestions and ideas welcome.

Ah. Thanks for the education. I know next to nothing about scripts. :(

Here is the contents of output.txt:

+ cat /etc/issue.net
Ubuntu 6.10
+ uname -a
Linux Devil5 2.6.17-11-generic #2 SMP Thu Feb 1 18:03:05 UTC 2007x86_64 GNU/Linux
+ cat /proc/partitions
major minor  #blocks  name

   3     0   78150744 hda
   3     1    1004031 hda1
   3     2   58605120 hda2
   3     3    8193150 hda3
 253     0    1004031 dm-0
 253     1   58605120 dm-1
 253     2    8193150 dm-2
   8     0    1048576 sda
   8    80    1048576 sdf
+ fdisk -l
+ true

The first seven entries deal with my hard drive, which has hda1 (swap),
hda2 (Edgy) and hda3 (Dapper). I am unclear what the rest of it means,
except that there is no other sd* drive. The only drives that should
appear are the hard disk in the laptop, the CD/DVD in the laptop, and
this annoying USB disk. Gparted sees the USB disk as /dev/sdf.

I recently ran into a similar situation. I don't remember the exact
error message, but if you post what happens when you try to run it from
the command line I might recognize the message. If it's the same error
message I have the solution. I'd post it but I'm lazy and I'd have to
spend five minutes to find it.

Subject: [PLUG] C++ question
Message-ID: <45FF2D52.2010004@gmail.com>

I'm working my way through an older C++ programming book and have found
an error that I can't explain with what the book is expressing.

This program:

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
 int localVariable = 5;
 int * pLocal = &localVariable;
 int * pHeap = new int;
 if (pHeap == NULL)
    {
        cout << "Error! No memory for pHeap!\n";
    }
    *pHeap = 7;
    cout << "localVariable: " << localVariable << "\n";
    cout << "*pLocal: " << *pLocal << "\n";
    cout << "*pHeap: "  << *pHeap  << "\n";
    delete pHeap;
    if (pHeap == NULL)
       {
           cout << "Error! No memory for pHeap!\n";
        }
    *pHeap = 9;
    cout << "*pHeap: " << *pHeap << "\n";
    delete pHeap;

}

is supposed to be displaying how to delete pointers using delete,
wherein it will release the free memory, but the pointer *pHeap is still
local and as such still exists and can be reassigned a new free memory
location.  However under g++ anytime both delete statements are present,
the program will compile but produce the following error.

localVariable: 5
*pLocal: 5
*pHeap: 7
*pHeap: 9
*** glibc detected *** double free or corruption (fasttop): 0x0804a008 ***
Aborted

Commenting out either delete statements removes the error.

I have discovered that C++ has changed a bit since the book was written,
so I've made a few modifications to the program (namely using using
namespace std; and int main () instead of void main()).  Anyone care to
explain why error occurs?

expr: syntax error

   This is repeated ad nauseum.

It is an error that is the result of Gtk moving from 2.x to 2.xx.

There is a suggested set of fixes.  I have never gotten them to work.

It is an error that is the result of Gtk moving from 2.x to 2.xx.

There is a suggested set of fixes.  I have never gotten them to work.

Randal will be speaking tonight.  It was dicey for a bit, but he told me 
he is able to make it.

So you don't have to listen to me ramble on.  (Or Randal on?)

Alan,

   Sonofagun! So, upgrading gtk+2-2.8.0 to -2.10.0 breaks acroread? Wow!

   I have version 7.0.1 on my main box and that works just fine. So it must
be related to the acroread version because the one available for download
from Adobe is 7.0.9.

   No solution, eh? That's more than a major PITA since a simple ctrl-l puts
acroread into full screen mode which is ideal for illustrating a talk with a
file of pdf slides.

   Does this mean that acroread on linux will no longer work, or might Adobe
come up with a fix?

I need to test with earlier versions.  I have been handed a new fix, but I 
have not had the time to test it.

There is a solution.  People claim that they have gotten it to work.  My 
system has some unique tweaks that may be part of the problem.

They should have a fix very soon now.  It is not just a Fedora or Ubintu 
issue, but hammers pretty much every modern distro.

Hmm, it looks like a typo of some sort to me - an introductory book on 
c++ probably isn't trying to show you potental buffer/doublefree bugs.  
You've lucked out, because usually making an assignment to a * that has 
been deleted might cause a segfault.

In general, calling delete on a * that has already been deleted is a bad 
thing - glibc has detected this and is trying to protect you from 
yourself - http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Double_Free


Having said all that, i'm almost 100% sure you are missing the following 
inbetween:

delete pHeap;
if (pHeap == NULL)


 pHeap = new int;

The author is probably trying to show you how to delete and create a new 
*, rather than segmentation faults in your program.

Thanks,
J

Good info.  Something strange is happening, especially since linux sees
the drive as 1 GB and you claim it's 160 GB.

Try running the two scripts below as root.  To become root using Ubuntu,
type "sudo su -" and then enter your password.  I'm assuming you have
admin priviledges.  Make sure the external drive is unplugged before you
run the first script.  In fact, it may be best to power down, remove the
drive, and then power on.

# script 1:
dmesg -c | tail

Now plug in your drive and type this script:

# script 2:
true ; ( set -x
dmesg
fdisk -l
true ) >& output.txt

Please post the contents of output.txt.

Regards,
- Robert

You're missing one line in the code (if you copied it accurately, then
the book is missing it):

Here we should have:
pHeap = new int;
>     if (pHeap == NULL)
>        {
>            cout << "Error! No memory for pHeap!\n";
>         }

Without the line above there is no reason to check for NULL because
pHeap was not reassigned, if it wasn't NULL before it still isn't.
With that line, the new expression can return NULL pointer if there is
not enough memory (well, the standard-compliant new will throw
std::bad_alloc exception but when the book was written it was probably
not the case).

A nice idea, though for me it has the same problem as the clinic:  no
means of transporting a machine to the location.  I suppose one day I'll
get a laptop, but I don't really need one now.

Something I figured out working with the PHP project was that the  
vast number of "information leechers" really didn't know how to be  
useful, yet, and the vast number of greybeards were often tired of  
repeating themselves. The middle-ware, the middle tier, is the folks  
who are frequently active, can bridge reading archives and teaching  
newbies, and are really good at understanding both guru *and*  
apprentice work.

It's not always a common set of skills, and (IMNSHO) the only way to  
really learn "it" (or I.T., for that matter?)  is to become a humble  
apprentice, and masterful guru, at the same time. And clap with one  
hand, of course. :)

(Masters who are not apprentices need not apply.)

It appears as though X wants to use the ati driver for my chipset by 
default, when radeon was the correct choice.  I found a good page that 
listed all the valid options and values for that driver.  By changing to 
that, /and/ setting some options for the second display properly I am 
now able to use Ubuntu in accelerated mode on my laptop.  I don't have 
the page handy or my xorg.conf file available, but if anyone is

I'd like to see the reference.  I was under the impression that ATI and
Radeon devices
used the same driver, at least under X.  The log file /var/log/Xorg.log.0
includes a long
list of supported devices that include both ATI and Radeon.  (I must admit I
have never
looked specifically for a separate Radeon driver).

At the store, you can get a computer that's a little lower-spec than a
Freekbox for $25-$70 or one that's quite a bit nicer for $150-$250.

You can also buy laptops sometimes.  Thursdays are best for that.

The computers come with a coupon for a single support incident.  I think
you can buy more coupons if you want.  If you install Windows, you're on
your own.

You can get a 50% discount on store purchases if you volunteer for a few
hours.  There's always things to wash or stuff to recycle.

Store hours are 11-7 Tue-Sat.

I saw some discussion a while back about CentOS being a better maintained

 of RHEL than Whitebox.
Has anyone out there done a Whitebox --> CentOS conversion?
If so, how did it go?  Any pitfalls to be on the lookout for?

Take a peek at the CentOS list archives. The topic has come up several 
times, e.g.,

How long is the support for CentOS?  Is there a conversion path from FC4?

My mail server needs to be upgraded real soon now.  Debating if I go to 
FC6 or FC7 or something else.  (I have to physically move my server first, 
which is why I am waiting.  The new server closet needs cleaning out 
before I do much of anything.)

A problem for many, no doubt. 

If your machine is accessable over a reasonably fast VPN, we can do
almost everything that we can if your machine is on-site at the clinic
(we can bring up a desktop remotely, for example).   If your machine 
is accessable by SSH, and has yum or apt set up, we can set up a VPN.

If your machine is not accessable, perhaps we can agree on some kind
of swap tray infrastructure, so that you merely bring in the hard 
drive.  That could be your project for PLUG - researching the swap
tray options, and convincing other PLUG members and Free Geek to
use that kind of tray in the accessable machines, and buying a few
for yourself and for Free Geek.  I will be easier to convince if you
use the ViPower Parallel ATA133 tray, or alternately the InClose tray.
The ViPower trays are available at ENU, and also fairly inexpensively
by mail order, while the InClose trays are available at Frys.  The
ViPower are slightly more reliable, slightly cheaper, and have both
slide-switch and key-access enclosures, so the Free Geek machines
could be keyed.

This would be a lot of work, and might cost as much as two taxi trips
to move your hardware to one clinic day.  But it would create a
system that could be used many times, and would help a lot of others.

FWIW, I seamlessly migrated my RHEL WS4 box to CentOS 4.4 using PRandal's
instructions...

http://www.centos.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=3310

...yielding an annual savings of $179.

I suppose you could finesse it if you really, really wanted to upgrade 
FC4 -> CentOS in place. Me, I'd rather back up, nuke, and repave.

If you wait a couple more weeks, CentOS 5 will be generally available. 
It'll have a looonnnggg shelf life; you won't have to do another 
general upgrade for years.

It also sounds like the non-beta version of CentOS 5 will be out real soon 
now.  (The previous press release said it would be out a couple of weeks 
after the RHEL 5 release.)

I'm testing 4.92 (the last public beta) in preparation for deploying 
it on our main mail/web server at work. So far, everything feels 
pretty solid. There are two big jumps for me:

  * mbox (UW imapd) -> maildir (Dovecot)
  * Apache 2.0 -> 2.2

There have supposedly been some SELinux enhancements between CentOS 4 
and 5, but I probably won't get bitten until I try integrating my 
SELinux problem children: Trac and its related Subversion 
repositories, and Tomcat.

CentOS is a very well maintained clone of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
You should also take a look at Scientific Linux, which is Yet
Another Clone of RHEL.  The avantage of SL is that it is supported
for a Very Long Time by some full time professionals at Fermilab. 
You will have access to all the RHEL/CentOS updates while those are
available, of course, but you will also continue to get upgrades
after RHEL and CentOS have reached End-Of-Life.  The SL folks have
promised a minimum of 5 year support, but the maximum is for as
long as there is funding for Fermilab and other science labs.  


and other apps common in science academia.  Most of the big 
supercomputing arrays use SL.  This is the reason why they want very
long term support;  they don't want to redesign apps for computing
arrays or for experiment controllers.  Other than that, the
differences between SL and CentOS are quite small, and if you can
handle the shorter (but still long) support horizon for CentOS, then
CentOS might be the best bet because of the more active community. 

All RHEL clones have much longer life than Fedora, though not as
many bleeding edge goodies.  All are "Redhat-Like", meaning things
are sometimes stored in different places than Debian stores them.
Changing from Debian (Ubuntu, Knoppix) to Redhat, or to SUSE, or
to other major variants is more pain than most people want.

RHEL5, based mostly on FC6, has just been released.  CentOS 5
and SL 5 will follow soon.  I played a bit with RHEL beta 2.  As
always, some things are new and wonderful, some things are upgraded
and better, and some things are broken for the sake of perversity.
Before you upgrade, do backups first!

   That's Geographic Resource Analysis Support System. Began by the Army's

When the Army dropped support, Baylor U. picked up the copyright and mail

Jason,

You may have removed the packages, but the libraries that were loaded to
support those packages do not automatically get removed.

You can find out what libraries you have loaded that are no longer
referenced by programs using "deborphan".

To remove these packages use:
	apt-get =y --force-yes --purge remove $(deborphan)

After running, run deborphan again to see if there are secondary references
that are not longer needed.
Use the apt-get command above as many times as needed to get to a state
where deborphan returns no libraries.

I suggest doing this after removing programs.

If you just remove what you don't want, the package manager should tell 
you what else is going to be removed with it.  If you don't want to get 
rid of everything that comes up in the list, you need it.

If your gui is in the way, try `konqueror man:aptitude` and search for 
"don't".  You could probably batch-up something with a '-s -y' and 
piping to grep ala:

  aptitude remove python -s -y | grep -A 2 'REMOVED:$' | grep '^ '

Though that '-A 2' is pretty naive, so roughly:

  aptitude remove python -s -y | perl -e 'while(<>) {chomp;
    if(/^The following/) {$ok = /REMOVED:$/; next;}
    $ok and print "$_\n";}'

There might be something builtin for that, like maybe apt-cache rdepends 
or so.  I think "man:apt-cache" works in konqueror too.

`strace -o /tmp/stracefile $program_name ; grep '\.so' /tmp/stracefile` 
will tell you at what run-time libraries are being loaded (and a huge 
lot of other info), but I don't think that's what you want unless 
you're trying to fit mozilla into a shoebox and wondering why ftp links 
quit working when you tossed the .jar files.

Bill,

That sounds like exactly what I need!

Unfortunately, "deborphan" got me "command not found," and a search in
Synaptic revealed that it exists but was not installed. The search also
popped up gtkdeborphan, which is a GUI front end for it. I marked them
for installation and then discovered that the Ubuntu repositories seem
to be down. :(

Actually, Synaptic does a pretty good job of listing orphaned stuff, If
you click on the Status button it will show you things that are
"residual - auto removable." Unfortunately, sometimes it doesn't work.
I think where it fails is when you have installed a program and then
you install a plugin or extension or something for it. Synaptic doesn't
know that the additional stuff is connected to another package, so if
you remove the package the extra stuff gets left behind. At least
that's my theory.

I also googled on the mysterious aqbanking stuff and it turns out that
it is somehow connected to GnuCash. I just did a complete removal on
all of them. So far everything on my little computer remains happy.

Well, the Ubuntu repositories finally came back and I installed
deborphan and gtkorphan. I used gtkorphan because it's easier. It
listed 41 orphaned packages, but I uninstalled only seven of them. The
problem is that I can't tell if something might actually need it. For
example, one of them was libtar. Gtkorphan lets you right-click and get
information about the package. Among other things, for libtar it said:

Description: C library for manipulating tar archives
 libtar allows programs to create, extract and test tar archives.
 It supports both the strict POSIX tar format and many of the
commonly-used GNU extensions.

So if I remove it, what will I break? I don't know the answer to that,
so I decided to leave it. And the others are all equally confusing. 

Deborphan is a good tool, but I need a database or something where I
can look up a library and see what packages use it.

Um, the whole purpose of deborphan is to let you know that nothing is 
using it.

You have such a database and deborphan is your front-end to it.

Somehow you missed the point (again).

Relax dude, he's learning about a new tool and saw it attempting to
remove something that seemed critical.  I would have done a double
take too.

Anybody know if a similar tool is available for rpm/yum based systems?

Hmm, it seems that one particular tool may have a database which would 
be quite apt.

Here is what I've used to fix two Fedora Core 6 systems.

File locations may be different for non-Redhatian systems but the fixes 
appear to be generic.

OK, went off and read through man apt and man apt-get. Man apt said
"this man page isn't even started yet." Apt-get may be able to figure
out what I want to do, but it's going to take more time to study it
before I can figure out what command to use. I did try "pt-get check"
but it didn't do anything interesting.

Gtkorphan (the GUI version of deborphan) originally listed 41 libraries
and stuff that were orphaned. Which package installed each one was
sometimes obvious -- like ia32-libs-openoffice.org -- but 34 of them
left questions in my head. If they're superfluous, then they won't hurt
anything leaving them installed, so better to leave them until I am
sure. If deborphan has a bug it wouldn't be the first. I just wanted to
tidy things up before upgrading to feisty, which I'd like to do when
the beta comes out tomorrow. And besides, it would be good to know more
about package management.

Subject: [PLUG] Serial Port issue
Message-ID: <46017E11.3000400@comcast.net>

At the clinic on Sunday, Aaron helped me compile a program that
communicates with a device that connects to a serial port on my machine.
The device is a controller for the X-10 system of plug-in modules (to
the house wiring). We succeeded in compiling and running the program and
running it as root. We also added rsteff to the uucp group (I think I
have that right) so that I'd be able to run the program without having
to have root privileges.

I now have some time to work with the program again, but find that it
does not respond the way it did on Sunday afternoon, either as rsteff or
as root. One of the commands, x10 info, returns the current settings of
the device. On Sunday it did return those settings. Today nothing
appears to happen. Upon typing the command ./x10 info, the cursor moves
to the next line and sits there until I type <ctrl>c. As I said, it does
the same thing whether I'm rsteff or root. The X-10 controller has
default settings so that I can operate devices A01 through A08. These
work as expected.

Where do I start to look for what to do to solve this?

> Special Topics Workshop

I have read the excellent suggestions from others, and have two to add:

Potential topic: 
A backup how-to for newbie desktop users. The majority on this list
work in a situation where daily backups of servers need to be made,
including off-site storage, disaster recovery, etc. That is certainly
an important topic (recently covered at a fine PLUG monthly meeting),
but there is a completely different dimension to backups. I'm thinking
about the person who has just one computer at home. This person uses it
to surf, write an occasional letter, and probably does some media stuff
-- editing toonz or vids, etc. This person does not need or want daily
backups to tape with off-site storage and disaster recovery plans. This
person does need a plan for a hard disk crash and, probably more
commonly, recovering a document that was inadvertently deleted. It is
something that needs to be done on an "as needed" basis. There is
little in the literature that can help this user, and the few software
packages that are available are buggy or useless. Training in dirvish,
rsync, tar, along with hands-on tweaking of the options available in
each of these tools is what the newbie desktop user should have.

A general issue:
Would it be possible to record the proceedings of these special topics
workshops somehow? I am thinking of a podcast or something which can be
made available on the PLUG website.

Operator error, again. I double checked that I plugged the X-10 device
into the serial port on the back of the machine. Yes, I did. But, the
other end of the cable fell out of the X-10 device.

I am able to communicate with the CP-290 controller as I did on Sunday.
Now to figure out how to actually use the program!

I decided it was time to build myself a new desktop. I wanted to use it
for backups as well, so I decided to put a couple of 320 GB SATA II
drives in it with Raid 1. A couple hours online and a couple more at
Fry's, and I'm back home with all the goodies. Everything, that is,
except the monitor. Fry's monitor selectiion sucks. I decided that for
the time being I'd just use an old professional 17" CRT that I had left
over. Back at home, a couple hours later I have it all put together. 

Nothing comes up on the screen. Pulling stuff out, re-reading the
manual, double-checking, still nothing comes up on the screen. Finally
I decided to try the CRT hooked up to the Windows desktop, just to see
if it's the monitor. Voil?! But grrrr. All that double-checking and it
was the monitor the whole time.

So I decided I'd just buzz up to Jantzen Beach and get as nice flat
panel widescreen at Circuit City or CompUSA. I start the car, turn on
the lights, and no headlights. Just parking lights. At this point I am
starting to swear in Spanish.

OK, if neither headlight comes on, clearly it's a fuse. Ford actually
designed the fuse panel properly in this vehicle -- it's right at the
left of the dash and you can reach it without crawling around. So I
pulled on the little tab to open it up and -- it's stuck. I can't get
the panel open. And it's dark. And the store will be closing in 45
minutes. Hijo ... well, never mind.

John-
I've been in your place before and can definately sympathize!  If its any
consolation my satellite radio and regular deck in my jetta decided to quit
tonight for no good reason. Hooked up the meter and I'm not apparently
getting any voltage off the battery on one of the connections, guess i know
how I'll be spending my weekend ;-)

I am happy to report that things are progressing better today. I got
into the fuse panel and discovered it is not the fuses. And I tested
the currrent at the headlight and there is none. It's probably the
switch. Fords are famous for bad light switches. Still annoying. It's
only ten years old. I'm lots older than that and my lights still work.
Well, mostly.

As for the monitor, a quick daylight trip to Jantzen Beach and Best Buy
at the airport turned up nothing that I wanted to buy. But stopping at
Free Geek on the way home yielded a nice 19" Viewsonic Graphics Series
G90f flat screen CRT that will do 1920 x 1200. Free Geek wanted $30 for
it, and I turned over the cash cheerfully. It's sitting across the
table from me as I write this running Fedora 7 live CD (32-bit), which
autosensed the monitor (brand and model number) and the video built
into the motherboard (nVidia GeForce 6100). Everything else is working
too -- didn't have to lift a finger. I swear, Fedora 7 is looking
really, really good. I'm impressed. That's a serious compliment, coming
from a diehard Ubuntuoid.

I haven't installed any OS on it yet; just running live CDs to check
out which one I want to start with. It has an AMD64-2 4600 and 2 GB
RAM. The motherboard has Gigabit networking built in and Raid 0 and 1.
I want to set up the two 320 GB SATA II hard drives as Raid 1 and use
the computer mostly for backups, and also as a failsafe so I have
something to get on the net with next time I screw up my laptop. I'm
going to spend the rest of the day trying different distros and getting
it all set up. And shopping for Ford light switches.

Subject: [PLUG] BIOS, Raid 1 and Confusion
Message-ID: <20070322194332.d79c2f4e.johnxj@comcast.net>

The motherboard in my shiny new computer supports Raid 0 and Raid 1. I
went into the BIOS and set it to Raid 1, which it said was "mirroring"
for the two 320 GB SATA II drives, both of which were visible in the
BIOS settings.

I expected that from that point onward all software would see it as one
320 GB drive, i.e., that the BIOS would handle the mirroring. Or the
onboard SATA II controller. Or something.

But when I go to install Linux the partitioning utility sees two
separate 320 GB hard disks. This happened for OpenSuse 10.2,
Mandriva-free-2007 and Ubuntu Feisty, all 64-bit versions.

I aborted each installation and am sitting here trying to figure out
what is happening, what I did wrong, and/or what I have misunderstood.

Does anyone have any suggestions for what I am not grasping here?

The RAID on most consumer motherboards is colloquially known as
"fakeraid" and is very likely to not work in non-Windows operating
systems.

Do an "lspci" form the live CD then go here for the full skinny on
your particular hardware.

Thanks! I have learned quite a bit from your suggestions and further
reading.

I am trying the following distros, all 64-bit:

OpenSUSE 10.2
Mandriva-free-2007
Ubuntu Feisty
Ubuntu Edgy
Ubuntu Dapper

The first thing I did was go back into the BIOS and read more
carefully. After poking around a bit I finally managed to make the two
320 GB SATA II drives into a Raid 1 array (mirroring). Then I started
trying to install the above distros. Dapper couldn't even start x on
the live DVD. Edgy got x started, but couldn't find the Raid 1 array.
It still saw two 320 GB drives. I told it to go ahead and install on
sda1 (these drives show up as sda and sdb instead of hda and hdb). It
blew up trying to read the disks. Feisty got further -- it still
couldn't see the Raid 1 array, but when I told it to go ahead and
install on sda it got to the point where it started installing before
crashing. Mandriva did about as well as Feisty, although it saw the
BIOS Raid array. It just failed trying to write to it. OpenSUSE did the
same.

So then I went back into the BIOS and deleted the Raid 1 array. Then I
started trying the install process again, this time intending to use
Linux' software Raid 1. Ubuntu (all three) failed again. Mandriva also
failed. OpenSUSE 10.2 almost worked. Its parition utility had the
capability of creating software Raid 1 arrays, and I succeeded in doing
so for a 2 GB swap and a 45 GB ext3 main partition. (I left the rest of
the drives for later.) OpenSUSE got all the way through the install
routine (20 minutes from DVD version), but when it tried to reboot it
couldn;t find the kernel.

I'm especially dismayed at my beloved Ubuntu. Oh well. Tomorrow I'll
fiddle around some more and find something that works.

John -

Most likely you could achieve the results you want with Linux's
built-in software raid.  Many distros are starting to support
installing to software raid partitions now.  Software raid does not
require support from hardware.

I'll second this.  Beware of fakeraid.  Even if you get it
running, I can almost guarantee you will regret it later.  
Think about it.  Do you trust the BIOS/motherboard vendor
to be responsible for the integrity of your filesystem?
Linux software raid is likely to be faster as well as more
reliable.  The only downside I can see is that it might create
some issues were you to want to create a dual boot system.

With software RAID, you mirror partitions, not entire disks.  This
means you can leave a partition unRAIDed for that second OS.  Though a
good, spendy RAID controller card may allow for partition RAIDing at
the hardware level, you won't find this feature with the El Crappo
onboard RAID we're discussing here.

One bummer about software RAID is that you'll have to monkey around a
bit to mount the metadisks under Knoppix.  But it's not too big a
deal.  Same problem with LVM: http://www.knoppix.net/wiki/LVM2.

I'm definitely going to take this advice. However, so far the only
distro whose partition utility seems to be able to create software
Raids is OpenSUSE 10.2. And, while it created the partitions and
installed itself without issue, it won't boot. Maybe the others can
create sofware Raids, but I just didn't click on the right buttons.
I'll fiddle with them some more. Meantime, I deleted the Raid setup
that I created in the BIOS previously.

I also need to read up on what to do in case of a disk failure. The
whole point of Raid 1 is redundancy for disasters. But I've never used
Raid 1 before, nor have I experienced such a disaster, so it sounds
like a good idea to figure out in advance what the recovery procedures
are.

Umm. I don't put servers into production at work without at least 
RAID-1 protection. I know from first-hand experience that Debian (both 
sarge and etch) and CentOS (and ergo RHEL) can do software RAID with 
little difficulty.

Perhaps it's not obvious how to do it -- especially if you're using an 
idiosyncratic partitioning scheme (as I often do) -- but it's not 
extremely hard to do on Debian and CentOS. I'd be astonished if 
related distros like Ubuntu and Fedora didn't offer the same facility.

I used to run a software raid (a striping raid -- raid-0?) and when
setting it up, I found that the easiest (by far) way to do it was to
put the kernel & boot "stuff" on a non-raided partition, so the OS
could actually get going and load the software raid config from /etc
after the actual OS core was in memory.  You can do it with the whole
OS on raided partitions, but you may need to monkey around with
initrd's and/or custom kernels to do so.  (I'd imagine this will
depend greatly on what kernels are available for the distros you're
using.)

Based on your problems so far, this could be what you're running into.
 On the other hand, I haven't toyed with Raid in ~2 years, so things
may have improved, and new problems may exist.

Dunno about Ubuntu, but Fedora definitely supports software raid in
the installer.  Additionally you can setup LVM on top of the software
raid from within the installer, in case you plan to grow any
partitions in the future.

For Ubuntu, you want to use the Alternative install CD.

Message-ID: <668dd2c20703230958o6a1dc29ao37fe9306cd27f9c2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm trying to install Debian (3.1 sarge) on a system that uses the Intel
945G/ICH7 chipset (Asus P5LD2-VM) and it boots and starts the install, but
then it hangs when it gets to "Detecting Hardware to find CD-ROM Drives".
Initially, the system had a SATA HD with IDE CD-ROM, but I changed out the
SATA HD with an IDE. When this made no difference, I tried installing with
Etch, but I get the same issue. Any suggestions would be greatly
appreciated.

The claim that that suse is the only installer that can do RAID is simply
not true.  I have personally used redhat's and centos' Disk Druid to do
RAID, and I know that it can be done on fedora too, since I watched
someone do it.  I have also used suse's installer to create LVM, and found
it to be a bit more intuitive to use, so I can understand that you are
more easily able to figure out how to do it in suse than in some other
disk wizard (like Disk Druid).  If I did it more than once a year, and I
had the clicks committed to memory, I'd give instructions for redhat here.
 But alas, I use gentoo exclusively these days, where everything is done
manually.

Maybe you should boot up under knoppix, and play around with building and
breaking mirrors, before putting your root filesystem on one.  As long as
your mirrors are properly built, the procedure for swapping out a failed
disk is simple (raidhotadd).

http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-RAID-HOWTO.html is a complete RAID
tutorial.  It discusses how to simulate a drive failure for testing
purposes, among other topics.

I'm downloading debian-testing-amd64-netinst.iso right now and will try
that later today. I'm also downloading FC6 amd64, but it's the DVD iso
of the amd64 version and the torrent won't finish until tonight. I do
have F7 (which I have glowed about here previously), but the only live
CD version of it that is available is the i386 release.

I'm really disappointed at Ubuntu. Dapper won't even start X, and Edgy
and Feisty are not much better. The onboard video is nVidia GeForce
6100, so I don't understand what the problem is. The Fedora 7 live CD
is the only one that auto-recognized both the nVidia GeForce 6100 and
the Viewsonic Graphics Series G90f. 

While my goals for this computer are to use it for backups and as a
failsafe to get on the net with when I booger up my laptop, at this
stage it is a "play" computer to mess around with. And it's spring
break so I have time to screw it up and unscrew it back as much as I
want to. :)

Hi Sara,

I actually have one of those motherboards.  Unfortunately, I put mine
together long enough ago (last summer-ish) that I don't remember
exactly how I solved my various problems.  I initially had some
problems with the USB ports, but that was a bad hardware issue.  I
think there was a problem with the ethernet hardware too.  Have you
tried a recent-ish live CD?  That might help eliminate a bad-hardware
issue.  I can report that I am typing on one right now, so it *should*
work eventually. ;-)

I remember on some Intel chipset having to disable the floppy drive in 
the BIOS before I could boot Linux. This was particularly true on 
machines which didn't have a floppy drive attached.

I'm sure the others can do it. I didn't express myself clearly. I meant
that OpenSUSE 10.2 was the only one where doing so was obvious. I need
to poke around with the others to find the right buttons.

As for Fedora, the only version I tried was the F7 test2 i386 live CD.
I am downloading FC 6 amd64 now and will try that later. 

In the meantime, I am trying to install Debian amd64 from the netinst
ISO. It found the partitions and Raid setup that OpenSUSE created last
night, but refused to let me use them. Every time I tried it kept
telling me I had no mount point, but it couldn't make a mount point on
the Raid. Finally I just deleted the whole OpenSUSE partition scheme
and started over. I created a 2 GB swap and a 45 GB ext3 partition on
both SDA and SDB. I can't find any way to tell it to mirror these. It
won't let me finish the partitioning because I have duplicate mount
points, and if I delete the mount points it won't let me continue
because there are no mount points. The Help is one screenful and the
word "raid" does not appear in it. At this point I'm stumped. I suppose
I'll have to go google for a couple hours to find out how one creates
Raid partitions with Debian. 

I also discovered that I need the Alternate CD for Ubuntu in order to
do Raids. I discovered that just before reading Aaron's message. :)

And speaking of Ubuntu, I've been checking daily for the beta of
Feisty, which was originally scheduled for release on march 19. Well,
it's there! I'm trying to download the torrent right now, but it's
stalled with one other peer, who is also stalled. I think they just put
it up within the hour or something and the torrent isn't finding the
ISO file yet. But if y'all want it, you can find it here:

http://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/feisty/

Now I'm going to go beat up Debian some more to see if I can figure out
how to get it to create Raid partitions. :)

I'm still coughing from all the dust I kicked up in that corner of my

the hardware-detection routine can't gracefully time out.

Subject: [PLUG] When to create private/public ssh keys
Message-ID: <eac729460703231212kaf6afa4ja855fec141b844d7@mail.gmail.com>

I'm a bit curious about how people handle their ssh keys as I'm never
sure when I should generate new keys and when I should make copies of
existing keys.

I always use ssh-keygen to create a new private/public key pair
anytime I create a new user - even if I'm the only one who will ever
be allowed to login as that user.  (I only do this when I want to new
user to use ssh.)

I also create a new private/public key pair anytime I add one of my
users to a new computer; so I end up having a different private/public
key pair for every user on every computer they exist on.

This seems like a fairly secure way of doing things, but leads to
maintenance headaches, in that I need to update my authorized_keys
files a lot.  I'm always tempted to copy a user's private/public key
pair from one computer to another when I add an existing user to a new
computer, but then I don't do it as that assumes I have good security
on all these machines.  But of course, some of them are laptops which
are subject to thief and what not.

Is these a better, easier way of doing things?

Sorry for the late reply.  It appears that the ati driver is a wrapper 
and selects which driver to use; be it radeon for that family or 
something else for another.  I didn't find this information right off. 
Here are the links:

http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man4/ati.4.html
http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man4/radeon.4.html

And my system runs properly with ati declared in the xorg.conf.  My 
problem must have been the ati driver not properly discerning the laptop 
display vs the external port.  I was getting impatient and trying many 
things in the end.

Subject: [PLUG] ntp weirdness
Message-ID: <46044CA8.2010702@gmail.com>

I have a mythtv box that I recently set up and it's been working fine
except I've had two instances where the time suddenly drifts way out of
wack.

Yesterday it seemed fine, but suddenly at about 5:00pm the time loses 23
minutes.  If I check the hardware clock as well it has dropped 23
minutes as well.  I've never seen anything like it.  Below is log
entries from syslog for ntp for the server....  So if I'm reading this
right at 16:48 everything is fine and 17 minutes later it's off by 1415
seconds?

Two questions

1) What could cause this and how do I fix it?
2) Is there a way to detect this and write a script to run ntpdate,
hwclock and restart ntp?

It's really annoying because 1/2 my show get's cut off.....

Back-at-you questions:

  1. Do you have ntp configured to write a drift file?

     Unless your box' main clock is seriously out of whack, a working
     drift file should keep the clock close to good in case...

  2. Did your mythtv box lose network connectivity for a long time?

     Long network outages will confuse hosts with wacky clocks.

  3. Do you have ntp configured to poll multiple servers?

     If your machine is only polling one server, then things can go
     bad quickly. Three "server" lines are good, e.g.,

     server 0.us.pool.ntp.org
     server 1.us.pool.ntp.org
     server 2.us.pool.ntp.org

If those aren't your issues, then you can try

  1. Forgoing ntpd, using ntpdate every X minutes from cron.

     This is a terrible solution, but unless your local clock is
     simply hideous, it'll keep you close.

  2. Keeping track of your ntpd's stratum and restarting ntpd whenever
     it rises above, say, 5. Run a cron job something like

     STRATUM=$(ntpq -c rl | grep -o "stratum=[0-9]*" | cut -d= -f2)
     test $STRATUM -gt 5 && /etc/init.d/ntpd restart

No, I haven't had any network outages recently.  The syslog entries you
saw was from a syslog server, which also serves as a ntp server. 

I have 2 boxes in my house that act as ntp servers for everything else. 
They connect to the internet, everything else syncs to them.

Well I added this to /etc/cron.hourly

#!/bin/sh

STRATUM=$(/usr/bin/ntpq -c rl | grep -o "stratum=[0-9]*" | cut -d= -f2)

if [ $STRATUM -gt 5 ] || [ -z $STRATUM ]; then
        /usr/sbin/ntpdate-debian
        /sbin/hwclock --systohc
        /etc/init.d/ntp restart
        /usr/bin/logger Reset Time
fi

We'll see if this ever kicks in.....

The caveat here is that the stratum won't typically rise to its 
expected level for several minutes after a restart. If you want to 
run this test every couple of minutes, it's probably a good idea to 
make sure ntpd isn't in startup mode, e.g.,

   # bail if /var/run/ntpd.pid isn't at least 10 minutes old
   PIDFILE=$(find /var/run/ntpd.pid -mmin -10)
   test -n "$PIDFILE" && exit

or something like that...

Well that didn't go well.

I finally figured out how to create the RAID partitions with the Debian
amd64 installer. That user interface needs serious work. Like scap it
and start over from the beginning. :(

I created a 2 GB swap on sda1 and a 45 GB ext3 partition for / on sda2,
mirrored to their counterparts: sdb1 and sdb2. After I finally
successfully created them the install utility proceeded to install the
rest of Debian Etch -- three hours downloading. When it finished it
prompted to restart the computer. When the computer restarted I got a
lot of stuff, ending in:

RPL-ROM-ADR: 0050 8DCA 55FF
RPL-ROM-IRQ: 10
RPL-ROM-PIO: CC00
RPL-ROM-FFC: 1 (which added 1 to the number every second or so until it
hit 50, then the computer hung.)

The above appeared before Grub or anything related to Linux started to
appear. I don't know where to look to find out what it means. But my
guess is that it means something couldn't find an OS to boot to.

So then I tried the Ubuntu Feisty amd64 beta that I downloaded this
morning. What I didn't realize as I was downloading it was that the
Alternate CD is not a live/install CD -- it is install only. OK, fine.
Debian Etch is hosed anyway, so I decided to go ahead and install
Feisty. But that went no better. Worse, in fact. I couldn't get past
the partitioning part. It refused to delete the Debian RAID partitions
and it refused to use them. There was an option to reformat them, but
it errored out.

For my next exercise I used a Knoppix live CD, intending to see if I
could find /boot/grub/menu.lst. And it turned out to be right where it
is supposed to be. That is, on the Knoppix desktop there are four items
(the two hard disks are matching Western Digital 320 GB SATAII disks):
two icons for WDC3200 which are sda1 and sdb1 (the swap), and two icons
labled WDC3200 for sda2 and sdb2 (the root partition). And menu.lst is
right there on sda2 and sdb2 in /boot/grub. The menu items are:

title	Debian GNU/Linux, kernel 2.6.18-4-amd64
root	(hd0,1)
kernel:	/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.10-4-amd64 root=/dev/md1 ro
initrd	/boot/initrd.img-2.6.18-4-amd64
savedefault

The second one is identical, but it says (single user mode) at the end
of the title line.

I note that it is pointing to /dev/md1, and I recall during the setup
that md1 is what the partition utility called the RAID device. As far
as I can tell the menu.lst entries are correct.

While writing this it occurred to me that the BIOS is not finding the
mbr. But I am not sure what an mbr does, let alone how to fix it. Or if
my supposition is even correct.

I should apply for university credit for all I am learning. :) 

Before I wipe out everything and start over yet again, suggestions
would be welcome.

Thats your machine trying to PXE boot. Its looking for a DHCP address from a
networked machine to catch and install image from. You can change the PXE in
your BIOS so it doesn't do that anymore. I've setup RAID on Redhat box years
ago but it was with a Highpoint raid card. You may have mentioned this and I
missed it, but what kind of onboard RAID do you have? Both Promise and High
Point provide Linux drivers, that atleast with Redhat/Fedora you can preload
before the installer starts so that you can setup those RAID partitions
properly. It took me and my co-worker days to get that fscking stuff working
so don't lose hope and keep us updated on your progress.

FWIW There's an old urban legend in the Slackware world that you _must_
drink a beer while installing or something will go wrong. Maybe its time to
crack a beer?

Success! I went into the BIOS intending to disable PXE, but I did not
find anything labeled PXE. I did find an option to boot from a network,
but I could not disable it. However, while in there I found a bunch of
other stuff to tweak. And I also found an option to disable RAID on the
motherboard. After I rebooted, Grub came up and Debian launched!

Problem: While the above is significant progress (first time I've
gotten an OS on this computer to actually boot), there is a problem
with USB. The keyboard and mouse are both USB. I can log in, and after
logging in I get popup help balloons when I mouse over them. But the
second I click on something no more popup balloons and the keyboard is
dead. Strangely, I can move the mouse cursor around, although I can no
longer click on anything.

Back to the BIOS. I bet one of the tweaks I did goobered up some USB
thing in there.

Ah boot from network ... thats PXE  just  labeled differently heh.  Sounds
like you have a problem with  X.org . If the cursor works then USB is
working to some extent. And if you're able to login then the keyboard is
working. Can you ctrl+alt+del to a terminal and view dmesg, the Xorg log
/var/log/X.log and run lsusb  and lsmod and see what is returned?

First I did dmesg : less and found the following lines of interest (everything else looked normal and nothing else referred to usb):

usbcore: registered new device driver usbfs
usbcore: registered new device driver hub
mice: PS/2 mouse device common to all mice
usb usb1: configuration #1 chosen from choices
hub 1-0:1.0: usb hub found
hub 1-0:1.0: 8 ports detected
Your time source seems to be instable (sic) or some driver is hogging interrupts
logips2pp: detected unknown Logitech mouse model 127
input: ImExPS/2 Logitech Explorer mouse as class/input/input2

Those were selected from the several screens of lines that dmesg gave me.

I tried nano /var/log/X.log and opened an empty document. 

lsusb gave me:
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000.0000
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 0000.0000

lsmod gave me:
psmouse 44432    0

I should add that I misspoke before -- the keyboard remains functional; it's just the mouse click function that dies. When I finished I did Ctrl-Alt F7 to return to the desktop. The desktop came up for a brief second, then disappeared. The mouse cursor is still active on the black desktop. I think you're right -- there is something wrong with Xorg.

Glad to know the keyboard is working.  Yea I'm pretty sure its just X  then.
Maybe  it has an "auto" line in reference to the mouse instead of the driver
it should use, and I think imps/2 should work just fine.  that caused me all
sorts of headaches back in the day

By the way, software raid on swap partitions is rather pointless, and
may in fact make swap slower.  You really should just create two
normal swap partitions, one on each drive, but not raid.  The kernel
will use them in a nice efficient manner to maximize performance.

I went back into the BIOS and noted that framebuffer was set to 64 MB.
I increased it to 128 MB and then the mouse worked for about 15 minutes
before dying. Strange that the cursor still works, though. I remember
reading in the moherboard manual that the nVidia GeForce could use up
to 256 MB, so I went back into the BIOS and raised it to 256 MB.
Afterwards it was worse than with 128 MB. 

I also noted during the 15 minutes when I had the mouse working that
the display was set to 1024 x 768 and there were no higher options. I
think Debian Etch is using Vesa drivers instead of nVidia drivers (nv
driver). 

It's bedtime and I give up. Tomorrow I think I'm going to install FC 6
amd64, that I finished downloading tonight. F7 test2 was the best at
detecting the video and even the monitor. Maybe FC 6 will do so as
well. And after that I'll try the latest Feisty amd64.

Making progress. Learning. Thanks for the help.

Fedora Core 6 amd64 is installed, replacing Debian Etch. There is good
news and there is bad news.

First, I took Jason's suggestion that the swap didn't need to be on a
RAID, so I deleted that RAID in the FC6 partition editor, then told it
to reformat the ext3 RAID partition for /. FC6 has a much better
partition editor -- a GUI and even the mouse works in it. But I am
assuming that now that I have two separate swap partitions, each of 2
GB, that Linux will be using them both, so I really have 4 GB of swap?
If so, I should probably cut them back to 1 GB each. The computer has 2
GB of RAM, so 4 GB of swap is probably unnecessary.

The good news is that FC6 autodetected the nVidia GeForce 6100 and also
autodetected the Viewsonic Graphics Series G90f, listing them both by
name in the configuration tool. It set up the resolution at 1600 x 1200
too. This is exactly what the Fedora 7 test2 live/install CD did.
Nothing else I have tried has detected either one -- all they gave me
was Vesa.

There are three bad newses. First, the ethernet on the motherboard
(gigabit) was not detected. Debian Etch had no problem finding it and
setting it up, nor did the F7 test2 live/install CD, nor did the
Knoppix live CD have any problem with it. It's a Realtek, and so is the
sound. And the second bad news is that the sound doesn't work either,
although the sound also worked fine with the live CDs and with Debian
Etch. The ethernet and the sound must be related. The ethernet light on
the connector is lit up and so is the light on the switch, so the
connection is still good. And for even more strangitude, look at this
that I copied over from a terminal window:

jjj at localhost -j$ su
Password:
root at localhost jjj|# lspci
bash: lspci: command not found
root at localhost jjj|# lsmod
bash: lsmodi: command not found
root at localhost jjj|# ifconfig
bash: ifconfig: command not found

WTF?

However, dmesg works. Besides the same lines about the mouse and USB
that I posted earlier, I found:

NET: Registered protocol family #

This line appeared several times, each time with a different number for
#. And that is the only line in the entire dmesg output that had anything to do with networking.

The third bad news is that the mouse problem continues. The cursor
continues to work, but the click function dies anywhere from right
after the first click up to maybe 15 minutes. The keyboard still works.
If I Ctrl-Alt-Bkspc to log out and back in again, the mouse is usually
restored but, again, just for a short while. I did determine that it is
not the USB, because I plugged in an old wired Logitech and it died the
same as the new one. 

First step is to get the ethernet working. Can't fix much without a net
connection. So now I'm off to google and check out FC to see if they
have forums and wikis and stuff.

/sbin/lspci in FC .... which is not part of the default path when you login
... yea I know wtf
Not sure about the ethernet.
Check the mouse device section in X /etc/X11/xorg.conf

Jason,

On the terminal "strangitude" you experienced...

When you su, use "su -" (with a dash) in FC6, otherwise all you have access
to is / directory structure, not links. 

Your mb reaction to FC6 sounds similar to mine. FC6 recognized neither the
built-in Intel NIC nor the Realtek sound. I had to find, download and
install the ASUS Linux drivers for both of these.

Subject: [PLUG] Linux USB Hardware Prototyping
Message-ID: <20070324175258.GA26567@gate.kl-ic.com>


Hardware geeks only ...

Anybody here do USB prototyping.

I want to build an interface board that goes from a chip test
socket to high-speed USB.  An easy-to-use Linux-friendly digital
I/O board with about 12 digital gozoutas (2 fast) to the interface
board, and 8 digital gozintas, would be nice.  I want 10MBytes per
second read rates, faster if possible.  FIFOs and agile clock
generation a plus.

I will not be building a product, so cost is not as important as
ease-of-use.  I will be building very long stimulus patterns out of
nested software loops, and capturing the results.   Hopefully the
programming interface is simple and flexible enough to facilitate this.

Two possibilities found on the web, there are probably more:

Devasys USB I2C/IO based on the Cypress AN2131QC http://snurl.com/mf21
         ( http://www.devasys.com/usbi2cio.htm )
Celeritous USBDEV1 based on the ftdi  FT2232C   http://snurl.com/mf1y

Suggestions? 

Keith

Stripping swap slices with Linux is pointless, as doing multiple swap
slices is faster. Mirroring or any of the other true RAID modes isn't
pointless with swap. Multiple swap slices won't give you the redundancy,
merely be simpler than stripes. Though if you lose a disk you may have to
restart anyway.

I have used the FDTI chips for one project but it was under Windows.  They have
supported the people doing serial drivers for the chip well enough
that these are
now in the kernel.  The ftdi2232C is a dual uart part that can also be
used for bit banging
12 IO lines per side.  Prototype boards are available direct from
http://www.dlpdesign.com/
Mouser and Digikey.

My project used the IO,Serial, and I2C off of the chip.  Most time
critical stuff was done
in hardware at the other end of the I2C but I did do some 400khz clock
trains for debugging
the hardware.

The problem is there is too many distro's and GUI's out there with their 
own home baked methodologies.  Now, for DSL, or cable it's much less of 
an issue as any modern OS will plugin into a network/DSL/cable and work 
by default using DHCP.  But for slightly more specialized configurations 
it can all change.  GUI tools will be different each direction you look. 
  Command line methods will all largely be the same, but that can be a 
task in an of itself.  One time I spent 5 minutes on the phone just 
trying to get a guy to press the Start button, then Run, they type in 
the letters CMD and press OK.  I almost killed a very cute puppy!

This is all moot if you can get someone to just come out and get you set 
up.  But if your distro has a firewall enabled by default, then the 
support person may need to know that now too.  You then get into a level 
of knowledge where people don't want to be bothered helping (read: drive 
out) others with such remedial tasks.  I could go on, but the point here 
is it will be much easier to find help where it already exists in the 
Linux world.  Such as this mailing list, or in the case of buying a 
computer from Freegeek, knowing about opportunities there such as a 
clinic, or helping behind the scenes with some donated labor and 
learning that way.

Geeksquad.... *shudder*

I normally add /sbin and /usr/sbin to my normal user path.  Most tools in there
have status info that does not require root right to run.

I have also had some success with using linuxmint  which is a ubuntu
variant that
includes things like flash, sun java and nvida drivers.  A guy at work
tested this and it
was the first distro that found and used all his hardware without him
doing anything.
He was using an ASUS with Nvida NForce chipset that had DVI on the motherboard.

Unless your desktop motherboard supports hot-swap hard drives, I doubt
you're going to survive a disk crash without a hard reboot.  In this
case, mirroring your swap is just eating extra disk space.

I think I found the solution for the ethernet on the Fedora Hardware forum. This person has the same motherboard and started a thread about ethernet not working. At the end of the thread he said:

---------------------
I downloaded from http://download.fedora.redhat.com/p...updates/6/i386/
the kernel-xen-2.6.19-1.2911.fc6.i686.rpm, mkinitrd-5.1.19.0.3-1.i386.rpm, nash-5.1.19.0.3-1.i386.rpm, parted-1.8.2-1.fc6.i386.rpm. I burned them on a disc, and a rpm -Uvh solved the problem.
---------------------

So I downloaded the files, burned them to a CD, and got them into the Desktop on the new computer. But I'm just a dumbass Debian dude; RPMs are a mystery to me. I read man rpm and then tried to install them, but got:

root at localhost Desktop]# rpm -Uvh *
warning mkinitrd-5.1.19.0.3-1.i386.rpm Header V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID 4f2ab6fd2

file /sbin/mkinitrd from install of mkinitrd-5.1.19.0.3-1 conflicts with file from package mkinitrd-5.1.19.0.2-1

I tried removing the old packages first, but couldn't the syntax right. The man page also talked about installing the newer package and removing the old one in the same command, but I couldn't get that right either. 

I'm sure the whole problem with ethernet and sound is that the live CDs and the Debian Etch that I installed all used later drivers and kernels than FC6. These updates should do the trick, if I can just figure out how to install them from the command line.

Does allow you to decide /when/ the downtime will be, potentially very
important. Also gives you a hint of what is up before you get random
crashes.

Thanks. That helped. One of them required --allmatches, but I found
that in the man page. I got all the new ones installed, then restarted
the computer. The Grub menu still listed just 2.6.18, not the 2.6.19
that I just installed. I let it boot, then did uname -a and sure
enough, I was still booting to 2.6.18. So I rebooted and when the Grub
menu came up hit Esc, which showed the 2.6.19 kernel option. But when I
tried to boot it, it just hung in the middle.

I know F7 test2 will autodetect and set up the networking and sound,
that is, at least the i386 live version that I burned a while back will
do so. So I decided to download the x86_64 version of F7 test2 and
install it when it finishes, sometime tonight. Meantime I'm going to
install Feisty amd64 and see how that goes.

Except for the problems, I rather liked FC6. And it's high time I got
familiar with another distro, especially an RPM based distro. So I'm
hoping F7 test2 will be usable enough for me on the new computer.

Thanks for the help. :)

I just went through the ATI video driver hell with FC6 after loosing
grub on an update on FC5.  I could not get dual head working in FC6, so
I "down-upgraded" to FC5 where I have it working just fine.  The ATI
Radeon drivers leave something to be desired.  We are having problems
with memory management with them at work, too, in another distribution.

You said above that you installed the amd64 version of FC6, but here
you downloaded the i686 version of the kernel.  You need to download
the kernel with x86_64 extension.

Most likely the kernel that comes with the FC6 install does not have
the driver support for your NIC, so you just need to upgrade to the
latest kernel *that matches your architecture*.

Beware of FC7-test2, as that is just starting to stabilize and
upgrades are not officially supported in FC test images.  I'd stick
with FC6 unless you're trying to be more bleeding edge and you don't
mind reinstalling in May (and possibly two other times between now and
then for test3 and test4).

I followed the instructions I found on a Fedora forum. The person who
posted the instructions had the same exact motherboard and said the
instructions solved the problem. The kernel I downloaded was exactly
what he listed in his instructions. I'm not doubting you. Just
explaining why I did what I did. But the issue is now moot because I
have nuked the FC6 installation and installed Feisty instead. However,
Feisty has its issues too -- the RAID partition utility in the
Alternate CD is broken. I had to install it on a single partition on
one of the drives. So my next foray into distro-swap world will be F7
test2 amd64. The download will finish in about 20 minutes, then I'll
take it for a spin.

I am positive you are correct. The evidence is overwhelming. Everything
that has a recent kernel has no problem with the network and sound.
Kernel 2.6.18 and earlier do. For example, F7 test2 i386 had no
problem, nor did Knoppix 5.1 or Feisty amd64. But Dapper, Edgy, FC6 and
Knoppix 5.0 did. From that guy's instructions I'm pretty sure it takes
2.6.19 or later.

It won't be a problem installing a new OS every now and then on this
machine. Its purpose is to give me networked space for backups from my
laptop and from my Windows 2000 desktop, and to function as a failsafe
computer to get on the net with when I mess up my laptop again. I want
the two 320 GB SATA II drives with a small swap, a RAID 1 partition of
about 45 GB for the OS, and the remainder (275 GB) as a RAID 1 place
for the backups. So if I have to wipe out the OS on the second
partitiion from time to time, it won't be a problem. Therefore I don't
mind being a little bit bleeding edge. 

I know I will get the network and sound problem fixed. The mouse
problem is more vexing. The mouse cursor continues to work, but the
click function dies anywhere from right after the first click to maybe
15 minutes after booting. Ctrl-Alt-Bkspc and logging back in again
restores it. The mouse is part of a Logitech combo USB keyboard/mouse
deal. But it's not a USB problem because I tried a ten-year old wired
mouse and the same thing happened. And it has happened reliably with
every single OS I have tried, regardless of kernel.

I've mucked around in the BIOS until there's nothing left to try. Right
now I suspect an IRQ conflict and that's what I'm going to fiddle with
next.

I so love breaking brand new computers. :)

There's a BIOS option that lets the OS manage IRQ's (windows) or the BIOS I
can't recall what its called but you want to change it to NO so that the
IRQ's are handled internally by the MOBO and not the OS. Have you mucked
around with the X config at all?

No, and about half an hour ago I decided that it might be in X instead
of an IRQ issue. I was installing F7 test2 and the install utility
(Anaconda) is a GUI with the mouse active. I did not have one single
problem with the mouse, even though I was clicking all over the place.
But the GUI in Anaconda is different from what you get when you finally
boot the finished OS. If it's not X, then maybe X is the problem. Or
maybe the problem is in Gnome.

I'll check out the IRQ options in the BIOS.

Fedora 7 test2 amd64 did not go well. The first problem was Anaconda,
which halted just after reading its initial starting screens from the
CD drive. It insisted it didn't know what driver to use for the CD
drive. Mind you it had been reading it for several minutes already. It
asked me to select a driver from a list or insert a driver disk. I had
no idea what to do. Finally, after retrying half a dozen times, I
accidentally clicked on the first driver in the list, whereupon it
happily finished the installation from the DVD. Lame, but it's still
alpha. 

So then I finished the installation. But when it rebooted it hung on
the first GUI window when it got to Starting Networking. I rebooted,
but it always hangs right there. The kernel is 2.6.20. I noted during
the installation that it detected the network card and I thought it set
it up. (Sigh)

I had such high hopes for F7 test2. :(

Anaconda is just a bunch of Python sitting on top of X.  Perhaps you
can try to figure out what is different from the install CD X
environment and the installed environment.  X has its own log file,
usually in /var/log.  You can also compare xorg.conf files, which on
an installed system are in /etc/X11.  Not sure where the installer CD
has it, it may be dynamically generated.

It would be interesting to see your /proc/interrupts.

There's actually a fairly easy explaination for the discrepancy
between reading the drive for several minutes and *then* not finding
the driver.  Linux distros usually use an initrd image, which is
loaded into RAM by the bootloader, along with the kernel image.  The
initrd contains a basic environment, including a shell to execute
scripts and any kernel modules necessary for basic devices like
hardware.  In the case of install CDs the image is often enough to get
the installer going, but then if no driver is found for the PATA or
SATA devices the installer won't know where to install to.

Try editing the grub command line and removing the rhgb portion.  This
will let you see the straight console, instead of the graphical boot
console, and you will be able to see problems like a kernel oops or
panic.

You could try using OpenNTP instead.

This morning I did some more installing/uninstalling of different distros (all 64-bit). I can now say with some confidence that the mouse problem is either in Gnome or in the nv driver. I had Simply Mepis loaded, which uses KDE and the video was Vesa -- not a single mouse problem for over an hour of poking around. I removed it because its kernel was too old to handle the gigabit and sound, and I couldn't find any way to upgrade the kernel without a net connection. 

I followed that with OpenSUSE 10.2, but its kernel was also too old for the gigabit and sound (2.6.18-2). I replaced it with Mandriva-free-2007. MF2007 properly identified the network card as a Realtek RTL-8169SC Gigabit Ethernet (rev 10). But it couldn't get it working. So then I went back to Fedora 7. The installation didn't specifically say it found the Realtek, but the installation went smoothly. However, when I rebooted it hung on Starting Networking, the same as it did before. Mouse and keyboard dead. It didn't set up a failsafe mode in Grub, but I went in and edited out the rghb as you suggested. This got me to:

Code: 41 8b 5d 00 85 db 0f 88 dc 03 00 00 f7 c3 00 20 00 74 60
RIP [<ffffffff8816f3e5>]  :r8169:rt8169_rx_interrup+0x5d/0x50e
RSP <ffff810037c97e10>
CR2: 0000000000000000
Kernel panic - not syncing: Aiee, killing interrupt handler!

Now, there is one thing that hits me between the eyes in the above -- the "8169." The Realtek is an RTL-8169SC. So it looks like what appeared on the graphical screen as a hang is a kernel panic caused by using the wrong IRQ for the Realtek.

So for my next exercise I decided to edit Grub some more. I tried irqpoll, but it still hung -- in a different place, but hung nevertheless. In the process I googled around and discovered that Realtek has a driver to make the 8169SC work with amd64 kernels older than 2.6.19-2. I downloaded it and it has a Readme with instructions. So I think what I am going to do next is go back to FC6 and then, instead of the fix that I found on the Fedora forums, I'll try installing the new driver.

So I think what I am going to do next is go back to FC6 and then, instead of the fix that I found on the Fedora forums, I'll try installing the new driver.

I changed my mind about the driver. Instead I went over to my Windows
2000 desktop, stole its NIC, and put it in the new computer. Fedora 7
found it and happily got me on the net. And as soon as it was on the
net it announced I had 267 updates available. I told it to go ahead.
Three hours later it was finished and I rebooted. And when it came up I
went into Network and noticed that it said Realtek 8139 -- not 3Com501,
which is the card I stole from the Windows desktop. I thought this was
very strange, so I shut down removed the 3Com card that I stole from
the Windows desktop and rebooted. When it came back up it was still
using the onboard Realtek 8139. Uname -a tells me I now have kernel
2.6.20-1. 

The really strange thing is that previously I had disabled the onboard
Realtek in the BIOS. I had to do so to get Fedora 7 to boot. And now it
is working fine even though (I just checked) it is still disabled in
the BIOS. Oh well. Linux programmers must be truly clever to figure out
how to use a device that is not supposed to exist. :)

I'm really pleased with Fedora 7. Totally stable. Just one small
problem -- the clock is doing extremely strange things. It's running at
about double time, is paying no attentiion to UDP, and is paying no
attention to manual settings. Except, that is, that I can set it to,
say, 10:30 pm and after I finish it will say something like 3:15 am.
I'm talking about the standard clock in the Gnome panel. And I can set
the screensaver to 30 minutes and it kicks in at 12 minutes one time,
then 17 minutes the next time, and other random times. I know a
professor at PSU whose concept of time is similar, but I didn't realize
he was in charge of UDP.

I've signed up for Fedora forums and for the Fedora e-list. I'm on my
way to becoming a Fedorist.

Much thanks for all the suggestions. :)

Linux rarely relies on BIOS routines to avoid running ancient 16-bit
code.  Also, you may have simply disabled *booting* from the NIC, not
actually disabled the NIC itself.

I assume you mean NTP, not UDP which is a network transport :-)

There's a couple boot options you can try:
- clock=tsc
- noapic acpi=off

Chances are you need to find a BIOS update.

There is more weirdicity going on with the onboard Realtek gigabit. As
it turns out, I was wrong -- I had enabled it again in the BIOS. But
Administration > Network showed two instances of it when I had the
3Com501 installed, both pointing at the Realtek, and the second one
ended in .bak. And I could connect the cable to the 3Com or to the
connector from the motherboard and get on the network either way. When
I thought the Realtek was working by itself because of the kernel
upgrade I removed the 3Com. It booted normally and I still had network.
Administration > Network still showed the two instances of the Realtek.
I deleted the .bak version. When I rebooted it hung with the kernel
panic as previously. I had to disable the Realtek in the BIOS again to
get it to boot. I later discovered that it will boot fine with the
Realtek enabled, but only if there is another network card installed.
And the second network card will always be listed in Administration >
Network as a Realtek 8169 regardless of what it really is. And it will
be listed twice, the second one with the extension .bak.

Yes.

According to dmesg I already have tsc.

Already checked that out -- the motherboard came with the latest,
version 1.1, November 8, 2006.

Already been there, but I need a lot more education on Fedora!

Right now I'm trying to figure out Yum, Yumex and Kyum. They are
pathetic. I seriously miss Synaptic! I found that you can install
Synaptic, and I did, but when I tried to launch it all I get is a popup
that says "Error!" That's all it says. I'd stick with Kyum if I could
at least figure out how to enable more repositories. The "Available"
button lists only 434 packages. I've poked at it for half an hour and
can't figure out how to get it to see the rest that are out there
somewhere. There is no /apt/sources.list because there is no apt. I can
google and read the how-tos and wikis, but it takes hours to find the
right information. :(

I also need to get the Ubuntu laptop and the Fedora desktop talking to
each other. Right now they can't even see each other. More googling.

Yumex and Kyum are just front ends to yum. I'm pretty sure you'll want this
repo http://rpm.livna.org/
Installing new repo's isn't hard, most of them have rpm's you simply install
to add the repo and doing it by hand isn't too hard either.

Here's a post from a redhat employee about why they don't have a bunch of
repo's packages installed by default http://www.burdell.org/?p=547

I assume the desktop has an IP now via the 3COM? Can you ping the laptop's
IP? How are they connected together?

I think that they can ping each other, but I'm not sure what they're
actually pinging. If I do ifconfig on the laptop I get:

eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:0F:B0:03:03:86  
          inet addr:192.168.1.101  Bcast:192.168.1.255
Mask:255.255.255.0 inet6 addr: fe80::20f:b0ff:fe03:386/64 Scope:Link
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1492  Metric:1
          RX packets:12871111 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:11706175 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 
          RX bytes:9680739701 (9.0 GiB)  TX bytes:10485009259 (9.7 GiB)
          Interrupt:185 Base address:0xc800

On the desktop I get the same thing, except that the inet address is
192.168.1.100 and the inet6 address is completely different. The
problem is that I think 192.168.1.100 is the address of my router. So
when the laptop pings 192.168.1.100 it is just going to the router, not
the desktop. An even bigger problem is that I have no idea what I'm
talking about. :(

But I do know that both computers can go to the internet.

Your router is likely 192.168.1.1 ... from the looks of the address scheme
you have a Linksys ;-) but I could be wrong.

Those are both valid addresses, so if you they can ping each other then they
can do other things like share files via samba or NFS. So they are
networked, just a matter of what you want them to do.

Don't worry about the IPV6 addresses, they aren't used in the greater
networking world as of yet (some providers have deployed it but its rare)
but Linux does have support for it in the unlikely event you are on an IPV6
network.

You don't say what sort of sharing you are trying to do.  Be aware
that Fedora comes with a firewall which is enabled by default.  You
can see/edit the basic firewall settings with a GUI called
system-config-securitylevel, through the Gnome menus
System->Administration->Security Level and Firewall.

But mainly you have to be more specific about "sharing" if you want
any help here :-)

As Drew pointed out, your addressing looks fine, and if you can reach
the internet from both systems then you don't have one set to the
router's IP address.

Regarding repositories, I am not sure if the Extras repository is
rebuilt to work with testing images.  Also, one of the "features" of
Fedora 7 is the elimination of the distinction between Fedora Core and
Fedora Extras, so there may be some problems associated with that
work.  Also note that Pirut comes with Fedora, and while not as nice
as Synaptic, should show you the packages available in a GUI.  Adding
a repository manually in /etc/yum.repos.d is not too hard, and once it
is enabled there it will just work with any of the yum-based tools.

I could swear the router was -100. And when you wrote that I
immediately thought "no, -1 was the very first computer that I had that
was networked and it has been dead for several years." But I just
pinged 192.168.1.1 and got a response. You don't get responses from
dead computers. So I must have recycled the number when I installed the
router, several years after the original computer died. What I need to
do is turn on all the computers and all the laser printers, figure out
their addresses, then make a list and rememberize it. Or tape it to my
head.

Already been to the firewall. Turned it off while finagling this stuff.

I want to do two things: 

1) I want to be able to back up the laptop to the desktop. That is, to
a new 250 GB RAID 1 partition that I haven't made yet.

2) I want to be able to drag and drop occasional files back and forth.
I want to be able to do this from either computer. At the moment they
are next to each other, but they might not always be so close.

Drew mentioned nfs. I'll google on that a bit.

I was aware that Fedora 7 merges the Core and the Extras. But I didn't
know about /etc/yum.repos.d. Is that the equivalent
of /apt/sources.list? If so, where do I find a list of repositories so
I can add them?

And that reminds me of another thing that would make my life easier.
How can I fix Fedora so I don't have to type /sbin/ in front of just
about every command? That is getting tiresome. A link? (Not an expert
on links.) A dos-like path statement? If so, where does it go?

try going to http://192.168.1.1 and see if you get a user/password dialog,
if so its your router.

You can do those things with NFS no problem.

The "official" repos are Core and Extras then of course there are 3rd party.
Of which Livna is the one thats most used and most useful. I've found a few
other small one's but they're for very specific things like XGL. Between
Core, Extras and Livna you'll have a hard time not getting what you want. If
they don't have it, then you can always use freshrpms.net and rpmfind for
specific packages that you might need.

cd to your home dir and then edit or add the file .bash_login

in that file type the following

export PATH=$PATH:/sbin

save the file and then when you open a new terminal you should be good to
go, if don't want to close and re-open a terminal you can type

source .bash_login and you'll be good to go.

That's it. the router is definitely 192.168.1.1.

Thanks. That doesn't work -- if I open a new terminal it still doesn't
let me type commands that are in /sbin. But it does work if I first type
source .bash_login.

You need to log out of the graphical session and log back in to get it
to take effect in new terminal windows.

Ok then you'll have to actually fully logout and then log back in. So you'd
have to log out of your X session and then log back in, that'll process the
.bash_login correctly.

O, perl hacking gurus,

I am trying to do some process testing automation and was looking
to use Test::Simple or Test::More.  I am driving this testing via Net:Telnet
and there are places in the code that if I time out I just want to end
which I do with die() but the Test:: module catches this and just
stops, no exit.
I have to kill it with a ctrl-C.
This is not what I want for automation, needing someone to watch for errors.

I'm not a perl expert but I do code enough that I can hack my way thru
most of the code but google has failed me on this one (or I have failed to have
enough of a clue to give google enough info to find what I need).

A clue stick would be most welcome.
Thanks

Well, I'm not a perl hacking guru, but I have frequently found a
clue stick within the perldocs. Typing "perldoc Test" gives me more than
a screenful of info, including these tidbits:
         ok(0); # ok, expected failure (see todo list, above)
         ok(1); # surprise success!
I've found "perldoc $module" to be useful when I'm trying to figure out
a module, and "perldoc -f split" to be useful when I've (sigh)
forgotten the syntax for split() (again).

Because of the cross-over interest, I thought I'd post this here.
Sorry for the noise.

Contact: Russell Senior                          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

COMMUNITY WIRELESS RESEARCHERS PRESENT RESULTS OF METROFI WIFI TESTING
       Preliminary results of an independent evaluation will be
               presented at the Personal Telco Project
                Monthly Meeting on March 28 at 6:30pm


During the Summer of 2006, the City of Portland signed an agreement
with MetroFi, Inc (Mountain View, California) to build a city-wide
wireless network that promised to provide ad-supported, free-of-charge
wifi Internet service to Portland.  As part of the 82-page agreement,
MetroFi agreed to initially deploy their network service in a
Proof-of-Concept area.  Expansion beyond the Proof-of-Concept network
was to be contingent on an independent confirmation that the network
performed up to the standards set out in the agreement.  The City
solicited bids to perform the independent evaluation and awarded a
contract to Uptown Services (Boulder, Colorado).

The results of the official Uptown Services evaluation of the MetroFi
Proof-of-Concept wireless network are expected in the next few days.

In addition to the official test, two local researchers and community
wireless activists, Caleb Phillips and Russell Senior, have performed
their own evaluation, and are ready to present some preliminary
results Wednesday evening during the monthly General Meeting of the
Personal Telco Project, a local community wireless networking
educational non-profit organization.

Among the preliminary results presented will be detailed maps showing
the boundaries of the Proof-of-Concept network as they compare with
MetroFi coverage claims, the locations of the access points,
street-level signal levels found in an extensive survey, a statistical
assessment of how well the network measures up to the expectation of a
connection in 90% of outdoor areas based on a random sample of
locations, as well as a general discussion of what they have learned
about the MetroFi network during their evaluation.

The preliminary results will be followed by a more complete report
when it is finished in the coming days.  The report will be available
for download at www.unwirepdx-watch.org.

The monthly meeting of the Personal Telco Project will be held at
Urban Grind Coffee at 2214 NE Oregon St, on Wednesday, March 28th,
starting at 6:30 pm.

Keith brought up the idddea of doing a classroom meeting where people 
would bring machines and learn about installing a specific app or 
configuring something, etc.

The biggest complaint is that moving machines is too much of a pain.

Instead of having people come to us, why don't we go to them?

We could do it as a video podcast instead.

We would reach more people.  We could tailor the talk to the subject at 
hand instead of "fill X minutes".

All we need is a camera, bandwidth and speakers.

It seems to not allow exits after emulator_start and ok() catches the
die() mode of $telnet
on timeout.

While I'm a big fan of podcasts, it seems this would take the
interaction out of the topic.  It also would limit folks who only have
one computer and want to follow along.

It does work. However, I wanted to see if I could get it to work in a
terminal window (gnome-terminal) without having to log out and back in
again. If I open a terminal and give it the export PATH=$PATH:/sbin
statement, then I'm good in the terminal. So I fiddled around trying to
automate it so that it would always run every time I opened a terminal
window. I think it will work if I can launch the terminal window with a
script. Looking at another launch script I have that Drew helped me
write, I came up with the following:

#!/bin/bash
export PATH=$PATH:/sbin
gnome-terminal

I saved it as launch_gnome_terminal in ~/ and modified the menu item to
call the script, but it doesn't work. It gives me "permission denied,"
which is odd since the script is in ~/. I'll fiddle with it some more
later. I think there is a F7 equivalent of gksudo that I can use on
Ubuntu, but I'll have to figure out what it is.

Meantime I'm off to Free Geek to buy a couple of NICs. Then I'm going
to see if I can figure out NFS (which I determined is already
installed). Also need to figure out a remaining mouse problem -- the
clicking doesn't die now, but I can't double click. And lots of other
F7 issues to resolve as well.

Thanks for the help. :)

You only need to log out and then back the first time after having created
the .bash_login ... everytime you login after that you should be fine in
terminals and any other program that relies on $PATH. You probably just need
to chmod 744 the script in order to get rid of the permissions issues.

NFS isn't too rough I'm sure you'll have it down by the end of the day

Personally, I'd say "go for it" with the understanding that things
probably won't work out as you hope.  That way if things do work out,
you are overjoyed.  And if they don't, you are prepared to learn from
the mistakes.  You may discover that even if it does not work the first
time, that it can work with some adjustment.  On the other hand, you may
discover that it will only work if you invest more resources than you
have at your disposal.

Can't hurt to try.

Regards,

That did it! I used Nautilus to do it -- just selected the script, then
on Properties, and under Permissions I noted that I had not set it to
be launched as a program. After checking that box, it opens a terminal
window, and commands like ifconfig work right away. Don't need to log
out and back in again.

Thanks for the chmod tip. The error message said I didn't have
permission, but what it should have said was that the script was not
executable.

Now off to study NFS. :)

What does the garbage look like?  Random letters and symbols?  Words in
a strange English-like language?  TV static?

Does it sorta look like it's supposed to, but stretched, or with the
wrong colors?

Not without knowing what you're using.  
Are you using Linux?
If so, what distro?  Ubuntu?  Fedora?
Do you know what version you're using?
Do you know if you're using CUPS and/or GutenPrint?

   Looks to me as though ghostscript is not installed and translating the
PostScript output to the printer language. I've seen pdf and ps files print
the raw postscript when the gs filter isn't working.

I want to thank everyone who responded to my question about starting
vmware guests.  I also wanted to let interested parties know the
solution I decided to use.

I tried xen and altho it worked well, it didn't seem perfect for my
situation.  I will probably use it in the future, but I decided
against it this time.

I had a copy of VMWare workstation and it did everything I needed and
more; but was difficult to automate in a server situation.  I did
manage to do this by creating a user, called vm, that automatically
logged in at the console at system boot and then adding commands using
"su vm -C" and "vmrun -display 0.0 ..." to the boot.local script that
would start my virtual machines and forward the X windows to the
console.  This worked well, but was totally hokey.

In the end, I rebuilt the host system (to update everything and fix
various inefficiencies) and installed vmware server.  It is a good
product.  It is easy to use and does absolutely everything I need to
do and does it efficiently.

Thank you for all the helpful advice; and a special thank you to Dan
Carrere who spent a couple days helping me with these and other
problems.

I think the benefit of having the people onsite with their computers is
that everyone could shoulder surf and learn a variety of configuration
issues.

Though I appreciate the idea of reaching more people with podcasts.

I have been trying to load SuSE 10 on a Mac Pro (not Mac Book) because
that's what my customer wants to use to design chips.  SLES 10 loads
with difficulties as you might guess.  I have to load the mii utilities
manually to manage the e1000 NIC.  The CD is unreadable, but once
networking is going I don't need the CD. Partitioning is the next
bugaboo. The disk labels or unreadable and the partition tables are
unreadable by the auto partitioning routine, so switch to the shell and
do fdisk on the 3 750 GB drives.  The installation progresses until the
grub install where it fails.  I switched to the shell again and
discovered the /dev/sd* files mission, but the build environment had
them could not use mknod but a tar copied the files to the installation
dev directories.  Once they were there grub-install seemed to work.  But
no joy.  No boot.  What next?

I won't be able to try anything until next week anyway.  Just sitting
here ruminating.

I could get Linksys or other wireless router but really don't need the

Maybe you're looking for
http://www.mobiletechreview.com/tips/D-Link-Pocket-Router-AP.htm

about the size of a deck of cards.

Found it by googling "wifi ap tiny", the description of "D-Link Pocket Router

About $50.

Message-ID: <courier.460A8F5D.00002FF2@softhome.net>

I am using ubuntu 6.10 and am printing using cups with the foomatic 
gutenprint driver. The garbage does look like a translation issue because I 
can read some of it and it looks like file formatting/data. Anyways, I 
figured out a workaround though I'm still not 100% certain what's going on. 
I found out that some (but not all) PDF's downloaded from the internet do 
this and it only happens when I print "all" pages. If I specify a print 
range it prints without any issues (even if that range happens to be every 
page in the file). This works for files I only plan on using once. For files 
I need to use multiple times I simply print the entire range to PDF which 
creates a PDF that can print all. Strangely enough printing to PDF requires 
specifying a range as printing all pages to PDF just makes a corrupt PDF.

It doesn't launch when you left-click on it?  (if not, then you may
need to enable the execute  permissions for your user/group.)

We're coming a bit late to the party.  But one of my coworkers just discovered
something similar happening on an RH80 box.  Being rather anal, er, uh,
focused, he did some investigation.  I'm inserting his report below.

===========================================
Here's a "heads up" for tech support.  There's nothing to do to
"fix" this except reboot machines.

I'll bet Congress never thought of this one:

The ctime() function reads time zone information once and stores it
in static variables.  So, if you start a program, the program calls
ctime(), then you change the zoneinfo files, say by loading a patch,
then the program calls ctime() again, the second call to
ctime() will use the same zoneinfo that it used the first time.
============================================

Again, this was on an archaic distro.  ctime() may have been fixed
to re-check tz info in the meantime.

On Fedora 7 test2 whatever fix was used ended up breaking it. I can't
get the time zone setting to stick. No matter what time zoneI set it to
it stubbornly insists that I am in London. The only way to get it to
show the correct time is to turn off internet time and set the time
manually on the clock to whatever it is here in Portland.

I started out with even bigger problems -- the clock was running double
speed on my new AMD64/2 4600 computer. I finally found a fix -- add
"noapic nolapic" to the kernel line in menu.lst. Not only did that fix
the clock, but double-clicking with the mouse now works too.

Back to trying to figure out NFS.

It sounds like it is setting the time to GMT.  There is a flag for "use 
GMT" in the time set routine. You need to toggle it.

Ugh.  I hope not.  At least not be default please.

You can, of course, set it to be executed by bash and even check the 
"run in terminal" option.

Why not?  (assuming permissions are set correctly, allowing
execution.)  Don't you launch executable shell scripts from a terminal
in the same way you launch binaries?  (granted, you *could* run "sh
<script>" for every script you use.. but that's why we have +x perms,
right?) Am I missing something important about shell scripts in this
context?

Debian, at least, mixes executable shell scripts in with binaries in
/sbin, and I'm assuming other places:

sfdisk:                  ELF 64-bit LSB executable, AMD x86-64,
version 1 (SYSV),
shadowconfig:            Bourne shell script text executable
shorewall:               Bourne shell script text executable
shutdown:                ELF 64-bit LSB executable, AMD x86-64,
version 1 (SYSV),
....
update-grub:             Bourne shell script text executable
update-modules:          Bourne shell script text executable
update-modules.modutils: Bourne shell script text executable
....

Any file manager shouldn't be launching executable scripts *by default*.  
That's too much like windows.  A sane default action to be "open with a 
text editor."  For the "I just want to run it" crowd, desktop entries 
are much nicer and get to have meaningful icons.

You can set yours however you like, but given that most scripts are not 
graphical, it doesn't make a lot of sense to execute them from a 
filemanager.  I suppose it would be nice to have some way to configure 
it based on whether it is in a $PATH directory (or even symlinked to 
such a file.)

Normally what I do for shell scripts that I want to be able to run
from a file manager is give them the .sh file name extension. Then I
configure the file manager to run .sh files when clicked. This has a
couple of advantages. First, just by looking at the file name it is
obvious what type of file it is (and what will happen when I click it),
and second the "regular" shell scripts that don't have .sh extensions
will not get run when clicked. You can get the best of both worlds
through the magic of symbolic links.

It might be trying to work when I left-click. It may be that there is a
different problem. Here's what I've done so far. The script, named
convert-640, is as follows:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash
for i in *jpg;
do
convert -size 640x640 -resize 640x640 $i 640/`basename $i .jpg`-640.jpg;
done
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I use it to make smaller copies of the photos I download from my camera.

When I left-click on it "nothing" happens. When I right-click on it and
choose Open With Other, and enter bash in the text bar, "nothing"
happens. When I check "Run in terminal" and "Do not close when command
exits" I get the following error message:

convert: unable to open file `*jpg': No such file or directory.

If I open a terminal window, navigate to the directory containing the
script, and type the command, ./convert-640 it runs correctly, placing a
reduced size copy of all the .jpg files in that directory into a
sub-directory named 640 (I manually created the sub-directory).

This leads me to suspect that there is some tweaking needed somewhere.

I like the idea Terry recommended about putting the .sh extension on
shell scripts I want executed by clicking on them. Once I figure out
what else needs tweaking, I'll apply that modification, too.

Dick,

   What are the permissions on this file? Are they 755? If not, turn on the
executable bits (chmod a+x <filename> or chmod 755 <filename>).

   I always add the .sh extension to my shell scripts. While they serve no
purpose as far as the computer is concerned, it tells me just what type of
file I am looking at.

It "works" for me, here's how: I use adblock with the option to turn on 
the adblock tabs for all <object> tags, right clicking on these tags 
will allow me to "copy link location".  On the KGW video popup window 
they've embedded the video in an iframe but I can see 1 pixel of the 
adblock object tab which is enough to right click on, copy the link, 
middle click and paste it into the same window.  Since they seem to 
transmit the proper mime type firefox knows to open it up in VLC which 
plays it just fine.

JAVA_HOME is needed only occasionally, but the path issue is critical,
as we've seen.  You normally should set up both variables when
installing a new version of java.  It seems lame, but I think it's
better that way.  Gentoo tries to handle everything itself, and they've
made a complete mess of that, with java-config-1 and java-config-2,
several config's in /etc, and a lot of compatibility issues.  After my
last upgrade, I now have to change some of those config's manually, even
though they say "generated by java-config" in them.

This morning I did some more installing/uninstalling of different distros (all 64-bit). I can now say with some confidence that the mouse problem is either in Gnome or in the nv driver. I had Simply Mepis loaded, which uses KDE and the video was Vesa -- not a single mouse problem for over an hour of poking around. I removed it because its kernel was too old to handle the gigabit and sound, and I couldn't find any way to upgrade the kernel without a net connection. 

I followed that with OpenSUSE 10.2, but its kernel was also too old for the gigabit and sound (2.6.18-2). I replaced it with Mandriva-free-2007. MF2007 properly identified the network card as a Realtek RTL-8169SC Gigabit Ethernet (rev 10). But it couldn't get it working. So then I went back to Fedora 7. The installation didn't specifically say it found the Realtek, but the installation went smoothly. However, when I rebooted it hung on Starting Networking, the same as it did before. Mouse and keyboard dead. It didn't set up a failsafe mode in Grub, but I went in and edited out the rghb as you suggested. This got me to:

Code: 41 8b 5d 00 85 db 0f 88 dc 03 00 00 f7 c3 00 20 00 74 60
RIP [<ffffffff8816f3e5>]  :r8169:rt8169_rx_interrup+0x5d/0x50e
RSP <ffff810037c97e10>
CR2: 0000000000000000
Kernel panic - not syncing: Aiee, killing interrupt handler!

Now, there is one thing that hits me between the eyes in the above -- the "8169." The Realtek is an RTL-8169SC. So it looks like what appeared on the graphical screen as a hang is a kernel panic caused by using the wrong IRQ for the Realtek.

So for my next exercise I decided to edit Grub some more. I tried irqpoll, but it still hung -- in a different place, but hung nevertheless. In the process I googled around and discovered that Realtek has a driver to make the 8169SC work with amd64 kernels older than 2.6.19-2. I downloaded it and it has a Readme with instructions. So I think what I am going to do next is go back to FC6 and then, instead of the fix that I found on the Fedora forums, I'll try installing the new driver.

There is more weirdicity going on with the onboard Realtek gigabit. As
it turns out, I was wrong -- I had enabled it again in the BIOS. But
Administration > Network showed two instances of it when I had the
3Com501 installed, both pointing at the Realtek, and the second one
ended in .bak. And I could connect the cable to the 3Com or to the
connector from the motherboard and get on the network either way. When
I thought the Realtek was working by itself because of the kernel
upgrade I removed the 3Com. It booted normally and I still had network.
Administration > Network still showed the two instances of the Realtek.
I deleted the .bak version. When I rebooted it hung with the kernel
panic as previously. I had to disable the Realtek in the BIOS again to
get it to boot. I later discovered that it will boot fine with the
Realtek enabled, but only if there is another network card installed.
And the second network card will always be listed in Administration >
Network as a Realtek 8169 regardless of what it really is. And it will
be listed twice, the second one with the extension .bak.

Already been there, but I need a lot more education on Fedora!

Right now I'm trying to figure out Yum, Yumex and Kyum. They are
pathetic. I seriously miss Synaptic! I found that you can install
Synaptic, and I did, but when I tried to launch it all I get is a popup
that says "Error!" That's all it says. I'd stick with Kyum if I could
at least figure out how to enable more repositories. The "Available"
button lists only 434 packages. I've poked at it for half an hour and
can't figure out how to get it to see the rest that are out there
somewhere. There is no /apt/sources.list because there is no apt. I can
google and read the how-tos and wikis, but it takes hours to find the
right information. :(

I also need to get the Ubuntu laptop and the Fedora desktop talking to
each other. Right now they can't even see each other. More googling.

I could swear the router was -100. And when you wrote that I
immediately thought "no, -1 was the very first computer that I had that
was networked and it has been dead for several years." But I just
pinged 192.168.1.1 and got a response. You don't get responses from
dead computers. So I must have recycled the number when I installed the
router, several years after the original computer died. What I need to
do is turn on all the computers and all the laser printers, figure out
their addresses, then make a list and rememberize it. Or tape it to my
head.

Already been to the firewall. Turned it off while finagling this stuff.

I want to do two things: 

1) I want to be able to back up the laptop to the desktop. That is, to
a new 250 GB RAID 1 partition that I haven't made yet.

2) I want to be able to drag and drop occasional files back and forth.
I want to be able to do this from either computer. At the moment they
are next to each other, but they might not always be so close.

Drew mentioned nfs. I'll google on that a bit.

I was aware that Fedora 7 merges the Core and the Extras. But I didn't
know about /etc/yum.repos.d. Is that the equivalent
of /apt/sources.list? If so, where do I find a list of repositories so
I can add them?

And that reminds me of another thing that would make my life easier.
How can I fix Fedora so I don't have to type /sbin/ in front of just
about every command? That is getting tiresome. A link? (Not an expert
on links.) A dos-like path statement? If so, where does it go?

Thanks. That doesn't work -- if I open a new terminal it still doesn't
let me type commands that are in /sbin. But it does work if I first type
source .bash_login.

To date I haven't had many occasions to create shell scripts, the mass
conversion of images being the primary exception. The idea of adding the

Pretty sure the pwd is ~ there.  That's just how kde does it.  Try cd 
$(dirname $0) or so if you want, but maybe better to just add an action 
to konqueror that lets you right-click on a directory and say "open 
with shrink_jpg" at which point the script would get an argument which 
is the absolute path to a directory.

My configuration is the hard drive is "Master" on the primary IDE

If understand correctly, you want to image your primary master drive
(/dev/hda) onto another IDE drive, either /dev/hdb or /dev/hdd.  If so
then either will work, although you'll probably get better performance
if you put the second drive as secondary slave, /dev/hdd.

Good luck and be sure to let us know how it goes.

   Well, since it's executable I would guess the issue lies within the GUI.
Can you run it successfully from a virtual console?

   I know nothing about the KDE or Gnome desktop tools so I can contribute
nothing of value there.

Double-clicking the shell script's icon works for me. Just make sure
the file permissions are set as "executable".

Looking for a new computer.  One candidate is AOpen's MiniPC MP945-VX.
None of the mailorder places can tell me if the bios enables VT
(virtualization), and the one retail store AOpen's website says
carries it doesn't really.  Can anybody suggest a short list of likely
PDX-area candidates worth calling?  Folks likely to *stock* it, not
just willing to special-order.

(Unless of course they'll do a full refund if I don't like it.  But that
sort of business doesn't stay in business long. :-)

My second choice is an HP "slimline" that's also small enough to fit
into the tiny workspace I have at home.  I'm looking forward to
installing Ubuntu on one of these two this weekend and hope to have a
SFF machine to recommend, either way, come next week.

Thanks,

--Eric

   The only local retailer with whom I do business is ENU. They're on the web

This is getting me closer. It led me to try putting the directory 640
and a test image in my home directory. Then, while in another directory,
I single clicked on convert-640 (in that other directory) while watching
~/640 in another Konqueror window. Sure enough, the reduced size image
appeared in ~/640. So, the script works from Konqueror, but not the same
way it would work if I was looking at it in a terminal window.

> Try cd $(dirname $0) or so if you want,...

My scripting is very rusty. I'm not sure what that is supposed to
accomplish. I put it verbatim into the script, but it didn't change
anything about the way the script ran -- it still put a reduced sized
image into ~/640. The code as it now stands:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash
cd $(dirname $0)
for i in *jpg;
do
convert -size 640x640 -resize 640x640 $i 640/`basename $i .jpg`-640.jpg;
done
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I guess my question now is, how do I get Konqueror to run a script in
the directory where the script lives?

I suppose the better solution would be something like you recommend, and
I would keep the copy of the script in one place, instead of moving it
to the new collection of photos each time I download them. It also would
be a good time to add the code to test for the presence of the directory
into which I plan to put the reduced sized images and create it if it
doesn't exist. But, I still need to know how to get the script, when
invoked through Konqueror, to know where it is.

I assume a virtual console is opening a terminal window. If so, then
yes. The script does what I expect it to do when invoked that way.

Message-ID: <20070329231451.GA7480@gate.kl-ic.com>


Folks:

I am not speaking at Linuxfest this year, but I hope to spend both 
days up there listening and participating.  I plan to drive up Friday
afternoon, stay in the Rodeway Inn (cheap, free wifi), and drive back
home Sunday night.  With one or two passengers, I can take my Subaru
wagon, and with four riders I can take my wife's mini-SUV.   Preference
given to folks with insurance that covers them driving while my car;
it is a long drive for one driver.

I also can share a room at the Rodeway with a quiet non-smoker.  If
you want to watch TV, bring headphones.

Note, the Rodeway, like the rest of the accomodations for Linuxfest,
is a few miles away from the college where the event is being held,
and distant from the Saturday evening beer bash, so we will need to
coordinate transport while at Bellingham.

$0 is the name of the script.  $() is backticks.  The rest easily found 
in in manpages.

(btw:  $1 is the first argument, you'll want that later.)

Where did you put the script?  ~/ ?

I've just noticed that konqueror behaves differently WRT to cwd 
depending on the profile.  E.g. if you click on the browser button, 
you'll get the pwd:=~ behavior and the filemanager icon will give you a 
dirname $0 behavior.  And, executable scripts don't seem to be 
configurable via the standard mechanism.  Bah.  I guess I can get it to 
run perl scripts this way if I make a symlink and use #!/bin/shperl as 
the shebang... I guess the same goes for shlisp and shobol too :-D

Ok, that's enough obscure amusement for one day.

I really do think the "open directory with this program" mechanism would 
be best.  Add an entry for your script using the menu editor 
(right-click on the "K"-menu) then right-click on the directory and go 
to properties, then click the "type" wrench and add an association.

Note, that trick works great for gqview too.

I have a long classical piece I want to rip and encode with cdparanoia
and lame. However, it was too long to fit on one CD, so they put it on
two CDs, each having "track 1." Does anyone know of any way to rip them
to wav files and then marry the wav files when encoding? Or rip both
tracks to one wav file?

On Kubuntu (or any other KDE based distro), I would use KaudioCreator to rip
the cd's to wav files and then load the files into Audacity.  You can splice
things together very nicely in Audacity and then encode it to an mp3.  Just
make sure you have something like lame installed to encode the file. Here
are a couple of links:

http://audacity.sourceforge.net/

http://www.icefox.net/programs/?program=KAudioCreator

Should be pretty straight forward if you read the faq's for both programs.
Hope that helps.

Hello from Latvia!

I've been living here pretty much since the Mandrakesoft thing with Zot dried up a few years ago and it's great to see how the Oregon FOSS scene has grown.

I am working with a local university and I would to profile what's is going on back home. Both from memory and a little research I have come up with:

http://oss.cs.pdx.edu/
http://osuosl.org/
http://osdl.org ???
-> http://www.linux-foundation.org/
http://www.mesd.k12.or.us/
http://freegeek.org/
http://pdxlinux.org/ :)

A few Perl mongers...
Whatever it is Google is building in the Dallas.

Is there anything else key I'm missing?

Is anyone working at these institutions and open to inter-institutional FOSS-related partnerships?

Thanks,

Michael Dexter

I believe it is a big data center, taking advantage of the commercial
power rates available so close to the source - The Dalles dam.

BTW, it's The Dalles, not to be confused with Dallas, which is closer to
Salem, and not on the Columbia river. In my tour guiding days I learned
that the name comes from French Canadian and means something like paving
stones. The stretch of the Columbia River running by The Dalles includes
 a geologic feature that is supposed to have looked like paving stones
to the French Canadian fur traders. Bonneville dam created a lake that
covered the chasm so that now, all that remains is the name.

Audacity! Why didn't I think of that? I've used it a lot for work in
phonetics, but I never used its ability to join sound files.

I'm doing the rest of my CD collection on my new AMD64/2 computer with
cdparanoia and lame, running on Fedora 7 test2 amd64. Lame takes about
4 minutes to encode an entire CD. I opened the System Monitor to watch
what resources it's using. It's very interesting that it takes 100% of
one CPU and about 20-30% of the other one, but it swaps back and forth
so that sometimes the 100% is on CPU0 and sometimes it's on CPU1.

The time-consuming part is ripping with cdparanoia, which never goes
above 5% CPU usage on either CPU, nor does it seem to use much RAM. It
does a great job, but it doesn't run any faster than it does on my
two-year old laptop.

What rip speed does it report?  What kind of drive are you using?  I 
find that my 48x plextor burner rips about 4x the speed of my 52x 
creative cdrom.  I assume that the digital extraction rate is not part 
of the number stamped on the front.  There's also something weird about 
having the fast one in an external USB case.  Maybe the driver or just 
a doggy onboard IDE?

Hmm. I hadn't thought of the CD drive as being the limiting factor. Now
that I think of it I notice that the light on the drive is on
constantly while cdparanoia is ripping. I put two LG DVD drives in this
computer, both are18x "Super Multi DVD Rewriter" drives with
LightScribe. They are ATAPI and the one I'm ripping from is the master
(the other one is not used at the same time). But cdparanoia doesn't
show what speed it is ripping at. It just shows a progress bar and the
track number is constantly incremented. I'm doing it from the command
line.

If the drive speed is the bottleneck, that would partially explain why
lame runs so much faster, as it's reading the file off the SATA-II hard
drive. And that would also explain why no one has bothered to make
cdparanoia multithreaded, or use more RAM or CPU speed.

You can calculate that by timing the process (`man time`) and looking at 
the size of the wav.  A 650MB wav would take 72min at 1x.  I imagine 
this is what grip does (though it might have a more internal hook to 
cdparanoia.)  Or just do some tests in grip.

I don't know if it works with wav files, but I do it with mp3s all the 
time using cat.

$ cp first.mp3 onebig.mp3
$ cat second.mp3 >> onebig.mp3

I have two issues.  The first is pretty basic, but I
dont know how to do it.  The second one might be more
involved..

1st issue is I want to clone one usb attached hard
drive to another usb attached hard drive.  Basically a
hard drive upgrade on a windows machine, and want to
keep everything the way it was without the pain of
reinstalling.  any suggested gui applications?  or
maybe a command line walk through on it?  thanks in
advance!

Second one, I am running ubuntu on my machine, and
upgraded from edgy to fiesty.  I have done some
upgrades, and some package swapping playing with new
stuff.  In the process I have broken some packages. 
Can someone tell me how to remove/clean up the broken
packages?  or for that matter, even sort out which
exact packages are broken?

Thanks again!  

John

Subject: [PLUG] Why does hardware lock up???
Message-ID: <20070329164633.fwjekail28gk8so4@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

Someone has been trying to run a Realtek gigabit
ethernet card and running into trouble with it
locking up.

In general, why do some hardware devices lock the Linux
kernel up?

I've heard IRQ conflicts and the like, but haven't
IRQ's been kinda hokey since the dawn of PCI?  Doesn't
the IRQ system go back to the 80's when PC's were first
coming out, back when 640k of memory was considered
ample?  Anyone need 2 gigabytes of ram to run their Vista
box ;-)  It's been a long time since 15 interrupts could
accomodate every hardware device on a PC easily.  Indeed,
especially with the way most sound cards waste resources
and with the added resource load of USB, IRQ sharing is
very common these days.

I expect with 64 bit platforms that the old: IRQ, memory
mapping, and port mapping standards are going to be
replaced.  One option I can think of is making the
expansion bus a serial line running at 8 Gbps.

I'm curious why Linux can't avoid locking up in some cases
if for example the network card is poorly supported or
the sound card is problematic?  I've had problems myself
with a RealTek 8180 pci wireless card locking up my Linux
system.  I am not very impressed with Realtek in general.
