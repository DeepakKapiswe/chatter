I figured they had to have it.  Looks like the price seems to be

Message-ID: <75D481373A76D311A5790090274F2B5C05C02F28@mailsrv1.gemstone.com>

I have been asked to install a couple program from the Red Hat WS3 CDROM.
When I ran a find -name 'tcl-devel*' on each CD and came up with nothing.
Then I realized the files I was looking for must be embedded in an .rpm
file. My first question is where would I find the following files? Is there
a way to search for them on the CD other than what I did? I also know I
should be able to install these programs using System Settings, Add/Remove
Applications. In case that didn't work I wanted to know the other way using
the rpm -ivh command.

  Thanks for the suggestions. I did see the Linux-on-laptops website. 
Found my model, but none were debian installations.
  I'll get to it sometime this week. It's more of a personal project 
than anything else. I'm thinking I may want to start coming to some of 
the meetings. I think I've read about quite a few linux laptops showing 
up too, and I refuse to bring a winders only laptop. Besides, I've been 
wanting to delve into debian for awhile now. Part of this project 
includes going wireless. More on that in another post.

Thanks. I did some more googling, and found this link:

In the "debian installation notes" section, I am assured your suggestion 
will work. And, a link to the working config file to boot.

Norm,

    I'm no longer running Red Hat here so I don't have 'man rpm'. But, the
syntax is something like
  	rpm -q --what provides <file_name>

Or, you could wander over to rpmfind.net and ask for the file there. It will
return the list of available packages that contain it.

HTH,

Rich

I can't speak to Debian, but Fedora Core works right out of the box
on my Inspiron 1100.  If worse came to worse, you could install Fedora,
copy the X config file, then reinstall debian and use that config instead.

Use the -V option for mkisofs, like 

mkisofs <other options> -V data_disk

'data_disk' will show up in winderz explorer as the disk name.

There are a couple other options you might be interested in.

-publisher <foo> lets you insert a text string into the volume header, like 
"Bill's Productions, you copy you die." You can specify a default -publisher 
tag in .mkisofsrc, with PUBL=<foo>

-p <foo> is the preparer ID. Something like "this awesome disk prepared by 
Bill's lackey on 2-1-2005." This also can have a default in .mkisofsrc, 
PREP=<foo>. Command-line overrides the defaults.

man mkisofs tells all.

   Bow down, approach slowly with the label held visibly in front of you and
feed gently. Well-trained cdrom disks can take it from your fingers without
biting you.

   Now, if you want to print something on it first, try OpenOffice.org. They
have several label formats for cdrom already present. I use one of the Avery
numbers with the Office Depot labels.

   That's OK. OO.o runs on it.

Yes. Rumor has it the Mini Mac is not much more than a warmed-over
iBook G4. Differences include the power management and thermal control
silicon, among a few others that I don't recall. The lead kernel
developer for PowerMac systems makes it sound like there's no real
impediment (other than the usual lack of documentation) to getting a
fully-supported Linux install up and running on the Mini.

Some local guy ordered a Mini with the intention of installing Linux
on it, and journaled his experience on a weblog. He gave up,
unsatisfied with the lack of support for some features. It'll just
take time.

When I load a new distro, I unpack all the iso's into a subdirectory
of my "spare" partition so I have a huge directory full of rpms.
(Probably I should just keep the iso's around and mount them in
loopback).  In any case, given the long string of rpms, either from
a directory or a mounted iso, I run a bash script that lists all the
iso contents and puts them into a text file for later searching.  The
core of the script does this:

   for  file  in  `find $dir -type f -print | grep rpm`
   do
      /bin/echo \
      "$iso $file ----------------------------------" \
                             >> $OUT
      /bin/rpm -qilp $file   >> $OUT
      /bin/echo ""           >> $OUT
   done

If I ever get the motivation to it right, I would build three
scripts, the first that loops through and mounts and unmounts
 all the iso's in a distribution to make the big long list. 
The second script greps through this file for a particular
string, and lists the rpms that contain it. A third script,
given the rpm, mounts the iso containing the rpm and loads 
the rpm.  A fourth script might be a cheesy kind of "yum",
that not only loads an rpm but all it's dependencies in the
appropriate order.

But I am too lazy, and that kind of setup is useful enough that
you would think someone would already have written it.   I am 
too lazy to even go hunting for it at sourceforge or whatever.

I had trouble with Debian X on some Dells with (IIRC) the i810 onboard 
video.  My fix was to go into the BIOS and change the video memory from 
1 MB to 8 MB -- this is a crappy onboard video card that uses system 
memory.  Also, you should look for the "Debian on Dells" project hosted 
at Oregon State for kernels and even install CDs with kernels suited to 
recent Dell hardware.

Good luck, and enjoy Debian!

Yes, you should :)

I create an /etc/autofs.isos and use autofs to mount the ISOs on demand.
Then I use 'lndir' from the X11 distribution to make symlinks to the files
in the auto-mounted ISOs.  That, along with the 'symlinks' tool, allows
me to maintain a sizable symlink-farm.  The only downside is that I cannot
simply NFS-mount the link farm and have everything work without also mounting
the ISOs over the network.  (Which is mainly a problem when trying to do

Ah, but you can use samba if you configure it without unix extensions 
and "follow symlinks".  A good trick for making programs under wine 
play-nice with symlinked directories btw (though autocad still does 
that silly copy/overwrite thing that kills symlinked files and/or any 
groups/permissions that you might have set.)

Now, can you mount your own samba share and export that via nfs?

I've been using similar strategies for my subversion repository 
check-outs.  Wish I would have know about lndir before I wrote 
hop_to_links (though I may have still done it just to have control 
over what doesn't get linked.)

http://ericwilhelm.homeip.net/svn/Module-Subversion-Juggle/trunk/data/scripts/

I've been using these scripts to do the "live install" of my various 
perl/python modules and scripts, but it works for any files (and I've 
recently been playing with it for pictures, etc.)

Thanks. Believe it or not, I tried "-V" and  I got an error in cdrecord.
So I removed it and cdrecord worked.  Probably a typo that went
unnoticed.

Hey Norm,

I'm not sure what version of RedHat you're using, but if it supports yum 
then that's a really easy way to install packages. Just get a root shell 
and type:

yum install tcl-devel

Too bad he gave up. It's interesting that he started with Gentoo and 
switched to Ubuntu. I'd expect a Gentoo stage1 install to run almost 
anywhere the LiveCD would boot and the network functioned.

Try 

find /mnt/cdrom -iname "tcl-devel*"

You did not give it a path.  That should find it.

Use "k3b".  It is much easier than trying to figure out the command line
options for mkisofs/growisofs.

I need to mount a usb film reader on Fedora 3 system. Here's what we
know:
1. Yesterday it worked automatically. When I plugged the USB cable into
the computer, an icon appeared, much like a CDROM icon and I was able to
access the media thru that. Today nothing.
2. I tried "mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 ~me/camera_film/" and it replied
"mount: special device /dev/sda1 does not exist".  I also tried sdai for
i=2...4.

What else can I try?

Rich, I am using RH WS3 (2.4.21-27.0.2) I like your idea and would like to
use yum. Where can I find it? I googled "yum linux" and received a plethora
of cool information, but none that jumps out with a clear path forward.
Thanks in advance

I'm not sure what version of RedHat you're using, but if it supports yum
then that's a really easy way to install packages. Just get a root shell and
type:

 

yum install tcl-devel

Actually, the syntax in Red Hat Enterprise Linux is specific to the
distro:

rpm --redhatprovides /path/to/filename

It requires that you have the rpmdb-redhat RPM installed. Wildcards are
possible if you have the right path.

'tis hard to say... what does dmesg say when you plug the device in?  It
usually will tell you exactly where to mount it from.

I'm familiar with this problem. Seems the /dev/sda1 device doesn't
"exist" when you just plug in the camera. On startup, kudzu (or
whatever) discovers the camera (and/or other USB devices) and assigns
it/them to /dev/sda1..n 

Apparently, if the device is not plugged in and turned on when your
computer is rebooted, the device is never discovered.

I would *LOVE* to change that behavior. Suggestions would be
appreciated.

This was on the SANS list this morning. As much as I hate to give any
credit to M$, these "laws" are pretty good. Of course, they weren't
quite complete, so the SANS editors made some changes to make them more
inclusive. Which goes to show that even when M$ does something right, it
is generally a day late and a dollar short.

Microsoft's Ten Immutable Laws of Security

Please provide examples of real security incidents that illustrate any
of these laws.  Other examples of security breaches caused by sysadmins
errors are equally welcome. Email them to info at sans.org Subject: 10Laws
(Original source and more details:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/community/columns/security/essays/10imlaws.mspx}

We've made a few changes [in brackets] to make them a little more
inclusive.

Law #1: If a bad guy can persuade you to run his program on your
computer, it's not your computer anymore

Law #2: If a bad guy can alter the operating system on your computer,
it's not your computer anymore

Law #3: If a bad guy has unrestricted physical access to your computer,
[or data] it's not your computer anymore

Law #4: If you allow a bad guy to upload programs to your website, it's
not your website any more

Law #5: Weak [or weakly protected] passwords trump strong security

Law #6: A computer is only as secure as the administrator is trustworthy
[and is aware of threats and countermeasures]

Law #7: Encrypted data is only as secure as the decryption key

Law #8: An out of date virus scanner is only marginally better than no
virus scanner at all

Law #9: Absolute anonymity isn't practical, in real life or on the Web

Law #10: Technology is not a panacea

Law 1 example
A sysadmin at one e-commerce company received an email that looked like
a security alert and contained a url that seemed to go to Microsoft for
patches. He clicked on the hyperlink, taking him to the fake Microsoft
site. He downloaded the fake patch and infected his system with a
keystroke logger that recorded his passwords and account names for every
system to which he had access. More than a dozen of the servers he
managed were later used by the attackers as pornography servers.

Law 5 example
A sysadmin for an aerospace contractor posted sensitive Department of
Defense files on a computer in the DMZ that also had a configuration
weakness.  The files were stolen and a major DoD investigation ensued.

We look forward to receiving your examples.

This is the right answer. :-) Plug the device into your machine then 
run "dmesg | tail" to find out what device designation it's received.

Wow, either the PLUG list has mellowed, or a big meteor hit Portland, or 
you're all laughing too hard to post. So let me be the first to say the 
blindingly obvious: "But the core, warp, woof, and fiber of the Windows 
architecture is to allow, indeed, to welcome these very things." No 
persuasion necessary, Windows always has the red carpet out for malware.

How do they keep a straight face?

Some PCs have a chronic problem with this. One of my legacy computers
is an old 400Mz Celeron and it's real fussy about re-plugging in USB 
devices. It's definitly a hardware problem, maybe in the BIOS or in
the USB adapter. The only fix for that particular PC is to shut it down
and remove AC power to force the hardware to completely reinitialize. If
I just reboot, that's not enough. I've seen these sorts of problems less 
frequently in newer computers.

Watch your /var/log/messages file when you plug the device in. This
should give some clues. Sometimes the device will be assigned to /dev/sdb
(or some other /dev/sd*) instead of /dev/sda. If so this will be shown in 
/var/log/messages.

Notice the repeating line in the ten laws?

     it's not your computer anymore

It's not "your" computer, it's Microsoft's.   They're the bad guys. 
Very self reflective ten laws.

Unless you only have software from the good guys on your computer.

Depending on the kernel or the device it might show up on /dev/uba1
(etc).  instead of /dev/sda1.  I saw this behavior recently on a USB
SmartMedia reader, but haven't tracked down the whys and wherefores.

Are you using udev? (not sure if that matters)

With my smartmedia reader, I have to unplug the device and plug it 
back in (with the card in it) after I umount it.  You might find 
that /dev/sda exists, but not /dev/sda1.

The device getting plugged-in triggers a kernel event, but changing 
the card doesn't, so the partition goes away.  Aside from physically 
plugging the device, the following two commands (issued by root) get 
the partition to appear again.

  fdisk -l /dev/sda
  blockdev --rereadpt /dev/sda

Thanks, that worked.
That was sufficiently interesting that I'm going to report what
happened:
(dmesg told me:
 Attached scsi removable disk sdb at scsi3, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
USB Mass Storage device found at 7)
/sbin/fdisk -l dev/sdb told me:
Disk /dev/sdb: 32 MB, 32768000 bytes
8 heads, 16 sectors/track, 500 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 128 * 512 = 65536 bytes

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sdb1   *           1         500       31982+   1  FAT12
/sbin/blockdev --rereadpt /dev/sdb
returned no output
After that
 mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 ~me/camera_film/
worked fine.

BTW, I'm pretty sure Fedora 3 uses udev and I thought it was supposed to
handle events like USB plugging and unplugging.  The log showed each
time that plugged and unplugged the USB, but as you said there was no
partition to mount.

Thanks to all.

Think of it as a wordy version of the warnings they put on the side
of cigarette packs.  It is there to make consumers feel guilty, NOT
to change consumer behavior.  If consumers had the time and interest
to manage security on their computers, they would immediately notice
that (1) it is very hard to do under windows, and (2) it is much
easier to manage security with Linux or OS X.  

Microsoft plays on the guilt and fear of consumers;  like a spoiled
child whining at mommy,  they try to shame people into spending money
and ceding control.  Their whole message is "we are smart and you are
stupid, let us control you".  Unlike the common F/OSS message, "we are
smart and you are stupid, go away".  Microsoft will disappear in a
puff of greasy smoke when we change the F/OSS message to "you are
master of your computer, how can we help you?"

It's just reenforces the only way to make a Windows box secure. Keep it in a 
locked room with no external network connection and throw away the key to the 
room so no one has any physical access to the box. :-D

Follow up.
Now it's working.  Who knows.
mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 ~me/camera_film
works on all the USB slots.  However, it takes about ten seconds for the
little USB icon to appear. Again, who knows.

Are you disabling uploads, perhaps?  That'll cut in to your download
rate significantly.  Look at the Seeder/Leacher ratio, as well... the
worse that ratio, the worse your transfers will be.

Generally the type of people utilizing the torrent will determine its
transfer rate.  If you download something like Law & Order: SVU for last
night because your cable went out for a half hour at 10:15, you'll
probably find not really great transfer rates because most people
downloading it are interested in getting the file, not sharing or
helping the community.

On the other hand, if you're trying to download a Slackware ISO, you'll
probably find much better speed, because the other people downloading it
are more likely to share their bandwidth to help a guy out.

Sorry, I wasn't clear about the equivalent effect of those two 
commands.

Either one of them causes the partition table to get re-read.  The 
list (-l) option to fdisk will, of course, list the partition table.  
This apparently requires that the kernel first reread the partition 
table, so what you want is just that side-effect.

If you aren't interested in viewing the partition table, the blockdev 
command gets you the desired effect by itself (and AFAIK returns no 
output.)

"Don't hold your breath waiting for a patch that will protect you from 
the issues we'll discuss below. It isn't possible for Microsoft?or any 
software vendor?to 'fix' them, because they result from the way 
computers work."

After all the holes in their software that have contributed to cases of 
#1, #2, and #4, I can only LOL.

And I know there are people who would argue with #9.

Ok, I didn't know that (never used RHEL), but it's really goofy. Why 
would they change the options to RPM? Especially after all of the 
time/energy over the years spent promoting RPM as a standard that should 
be adopted by others.

Subject: [PLUG] CUPS: adding a USB printer
Message-ID: <1107375831.5361.15.camel@apollo.spears.org>

I already have a printer attached to the parport which seems to work
fine.  Now I'm seeing if I can get a small color printer to work off of
a USB port.
The printer is an Epson Stylus C86.
OS = Fedora 3
CUPS = 1.1.22
I make the following choices in the CUPS browser admin:
name = color
device for color = USB Printer# 1 (Epson Stylus C86)
Model/Driver for color = EPSON Stylus Color Series CUPSv1.1(en)
At which point it says that the printer color has been added and  shows
up on the Printers page, but when I elect to print a test page nothing
happens.

Looking at dmesg, there are a bunch of these:
drivers/usb/class/usblp.c: usblp0: error -71 reading printer status 
and
drivers/usb/class/usblp.c: usblp0: removed
and

Limit your upload rates if you're on DSL.  Or shape your traffic if
you're so inclined - on DSL, if you upload full blast, your download
(and latency) will suffer greatly.

I just use btdownloadcurses.py, myself.  :-)

Is it possible to fill in more than just the address in an HTML mailto: ? I'd

Since I'm building a site without much in the way of back-end support, I'm 
looking for a way to have the user of the site send me an e-mail with the 
details of what they want to buy already filled in. From what I've seen, it 
looks like all you can do is get the address line filled in on the e-mail.

Google returned the same question, asked by someone else on another list, but 
no answer.

Yes, I believe it is possible, but I don't know how portable it is to
setups like Firefox/Evolution (like what I run).

I don't remember all the syntax property... but think it was something
along the lines of:

<a href="mailto:rob at axpr.net&subject=Testing&body=Some more">

Why don't you have any back-end support for such things?  A little php
should be able to do the job without any problems at all.

Some browsers will fill in the subject if requested. I don't know of any
that will fill in the body.

See if your web host has any ready-to-run CGIs. If they have only one,
it will be a form-to-email script.

It's certainly not the first goofy thing Red Hat has done. But the
--redhatprovides switch is linked to their database of files and
packages (rpmdb-redhat, as mentioned previously). The file doesn't have
to be installed for --redhatprovides to work, as long as you cite the
right path. Naturally, it wouldn't work with other distros. So there's
some justification for a distro specific switch. 

I think rpm -qf /path/to/filename works on all rpm-based distros, as
long as the associated package is installed.

Thanks,
Mike

Because it's being hosted on one of my Comcast sites, and they have minimal 
back-end support. Php is not included. One day, if there are enough sales to 
support it, I'll graduate to a hosting site that has php, MySQL, etc. In the 
meantime, I'm trying to do this on the cheap, and yet have it work 
reasonably, for the customers, who may not be all that computer savvy.

There is such a system. It may or may not do what I want, but since I'm as far 
along as I am, I'm trying to minimize my own coding effort. I'm pretty close 
to launching the site, and fiddling with what they provide will take me more 
time.

Thanks for the idea, though.

The best source for YUM on Red Hat Enterprise and clones is:

http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/apt/

Dag coordinates with FreshRPMs and other RPM sites to ensure that
they're all internally consistent.  He offers really simple
instructions on getting YUM set up here:

http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/apt/FAQ.php#B3

I often have problems with the "$releasever" variable and instead
hardcode in a "3", as in:

  name=Dag RPM Repository for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  baseurl=http://apt.sw.be/redhat/el3/en/$basearch/dag

And what exactly does this mean in terms of a "Security Law?" Is it a
justification for storing personal information on all these websites
(which, like PayPal recently, get hacked with alarming frequency by
anonymous attackers)? Or is it trying to be a reason for installing
spyware on users' machines?

I think they just needed 10 laws because they're so base-10.

I had quite a few problems with Azureus on Linux until I switched to the

you need to watch is memory use. Downloading a bunch o' stuff will fill

What client are you using?

A friend pointed me to a Java version called Azureus
http://azureus.sourceforge.net/ It works pretty well.  I get very good
transfer rates with it.

One thing is that the speed depends on who you are connecting to and how
long. I have had problems with the standard though.

Another pointer is to make sure you have the correct ports open, if that
doesn't bother you to much.  I run azureus using a higher port number
that I nat to and my speeds have been great.  But again it does depend
on who you are connecting with.

Subject: [PLUG] Resolved: php and where mpg123 lives
Message-ID: <200502030729.35142.rsteff.l@comcast.net>

Some long time ago, a couple of years, I think, I posted my music database 
(php and mpg123) project on my web site. Yesterday, I got an e-mail from a 
fellow in Massachusetts who is working on something similar and found my 
code! (My few moments of coding fame?) He was having a problem getting mpg123 
to work from php. He could run things like ls, but not mpg123.

I got the e-mail just before I had to go out, so I responded with the short 
answer that I vaguely recalled a problem with permissions, and that I'd check 
further when I got home.

I got an e-mail from him this morning that said my comment reminded him to 
look where the programs live. Apparently, php can't see some directories. On 
his machine, mpg123 lived in /usr/local/bin. Programs like ls live 
in /usr/bin. Once he moved mpg123 to /usr/bin, php had no problem with it.

   How strange of php. Anyway, a soft link is better than moving the
application.

It's a security feature; when in safe_mode, save_mode_exec_dir limits
the paths that PHP will run programs from.

Wil,

   A chroot jail, eh? So, not to flog a deceased equine, but is there a
security difference in allowing executables to run from /usr/bin but not
/usr/local/bin?

There is a big difference between those two directories when you think 
about the FHS and what is installed where.

/usr/bin:

http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html#USRBINMOSTUSERCOMMANDS

/usr/local/bin:

http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html#USRLOCALLOCALHIERARCHY

The things in /usr/local/bin are all installed by the local admin and 
they do not come with the distribution.

OK, I'm confused.

As I understand it, DSL uses different frequency ranges for upload and 
download, and they shouldn't interfere with each other. So in theory, 
upload speed and download speed should not impact each other.

It's not like a modem that has to transmit and receive over the same 
voice spectrum. It's more like transmitting on channel 14 and receiving 
on channel 15 on your CB. Of course, the other end is transmitting on 
channel 15 and receiving on channel 14.

What am I missing?

They are creating a site in Spanish and though the editor ( I don't

   So I was wondering if there are any ***x based editors that take the

What happens is that if you max out the upload or download speed, data
backs up in the modem's queue, causing a kind of gridlock that slows
things waaay down.  So you cap UL/DL rates just below the maximum to
prevent this.

It's a question of the character set used to create the page is 
mismatched with the web server's default character set. The page is 
probably encoded via UTF-8, while the web server defaults to 
ISO-8859-1 -- though there's a small chance the situation is just the 
reverse of that.

Rather than having them resort to character entities, the best 
long-term fix is probably to get the web server in shape to serve up 
Unicode pages.

What web server software are they using? If Apache, check out the 
AddDefaultCharset and AddCharset directives.

Then there are those admins who like NFS and put /usr/local across
WAN's and the performance really sucks.  :-)

Perhaps this is a better solution: Ensure that your web server is using
the same charset in the HTTP headers and the document itself is using.
At least, that's what people are telling me, although I haven't entirely
sorted it out yet.

I'm sorta running into similar problems with some documents I'm
generating from DocBook. See http://nakedape.cc/info/Cyrus-IMAP-HOWTO.
You might notice odd characters that (on my Firefox at least) are
rendered as commas in the nagivation links at the top and bottom.  If I
manually change the charset to ISO-9660 or ASCII from UTF-8, the
characters are not displayed.  I don't seem to be the only one either; I
noticed it on the Samba docs pages too, although they seem to have
resolved it.

I don't think it's so much about /usr/local/bin/ being a problem as not
allowing your web server or php CGI to run, say, /tmp/rootshell.

If it's like that, then something else must be seriously wrong with a
lot of DSL.

>From personal experience, I can either upload at full capacity or

speed cuts in to upload speed a but, but upload speed cuts in to
download speed drastically, and when uploading things, latency goes to
hell in a handbasket (making ssh unusable it's so bad).

Some time ago I began investigating traffic shaping to better share my
resources via BitTorrent (for things like Slackware ISOs and such)... I
never actually implemented anything, but a common thread I seemed to see
in people's comments regarding traffic shaping uses was to solve this
upload-kills-the-connection problem so many DSL users seem to have.

I can't offer anything more than anecdotal evidence that this is the
case... so take it for what it's worth.  :-)

Indeed.  And it's the same with cable internet.

I used the the Wondershaper script to cap bandwidth on my home box
and it did, well, wonders.  The Debian version has improvments (it
accepts command-line arguments and comes with an excellent quickstart
in README.Debian) so I'd suggest using that one.  If you don't run
Debian, use Alien to convert it to the package format of your choice.

With it in place and tuned, I can hammer my connection up and down and
still have responsive SSH and decent WWW.  I'm thinking of adding some
settings to prioritize SIP traffic, but no need for that yet.

Tuning's easy: you ping your next-hop (Qwest's router, say), start
a big FTP download, and slowly turn the download bandwidth up 'til
your ping times go bad.  Back off a little and that's your DL number.
Then you do the same thing with an upload.

All the cool kids are doing it,
  Aaron ;)

I can't speak from experience, but I gathered some links a while ago:

http://gambas.sourceforge.net/
http://www.realsoftware.com/realbasic/guides/portingvisualbasic/
http://vb2py.sourceforge.net/

All of these involve some porting work and can get hung-up on custom
controls and DB issues.

Winelib is more for C programs.  But I believe you can run some VB
apps as-is in Wine.

Yay!  Woo!  These are the hard 'uns, but if they work out, they pay
off well in goodwill.  NTM performance improvements, remote access,
reduced license fees...

My bias is toward moving all my web pages to UTF-8, so here's what I 
did...

First, I made sure that the DocBook stylesheets produced UTF-8 output. 
I did that by writing a custom wrapper around the default xhtml 
stylesheet:

<xsl:stylesheet
      version='1.0'
      xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

   <xsl:import
        href="/usr/share/sgml/docbook/xsl-stylesheets/xhtml/docbook.xsl"/>

   <xsl:output
        method="xml"
        encoding="UTF-8"
        indent="no"
        doctype-public="-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
        doctype-system="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"/>

   ...

</xsl:stylesheet>

Second, I set Apache up to serve UTF-8 by default:

    AddDefaultCharset UTF-8

So the files are Unicode-encoded and the web server lets clients know 
about it:

$ HEAD www.madboa.com
200 OK
Connection: close
Date: Fri, 04 Feb 2005 15:23:32 GMT
Accept-Ranges: bytes
ETag: "30624-fbc-b5c96680"
Server: Apache/2.0.48 (Linux/SuSE)
Content-Length: 4028
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
...

Anyway, that's what works for me.

On the other hand, if you've got a bunch of UTF-8 files and you're 
pretty sure that you won't be able to convince the webmaster to serve 
them up correctly, you can use iconv(1) to do the conversion, e.g.,

   iconv -f UTF-8 -t ISO8859-1 page.html > page.new.html

I wonder whether this can really be blamed on the DSL hardware.  I think
poor throughput in the un-traffic-shaped case may be due to high TCP ACK
latency.  It seems that this would be likely to happen with any TCP
connection with large buffers and a slow (relative to ethernet) bit
rate.  In this case, getting the TCP ACK packets sent in a timely manner
is certainly a software issue.

An interesting experiment would be two simultaneous UDP transfers.
Since UDP packets aren't ack'd, this should show whether the hardware
slows down when both directions are utilized.

I had an application that I developed that I had tried to get running under
Linux.  Since I had the source to it, I figured I could make it work under Wine.
Turns out that if your program does anything with any type of database or
trys to talk to the network, it has a good chance to fail.  The only
real success
I had was running the installer for my program and getting notepad to run.

In the end,  I used my knowledge about the program to re-write it from scratch
in QT and C++.

There are plenty of niche applications that tie people to Windows for
their productivity.  Just because Linux people are not familiar with
the more esoteric Windows applications does not mean they don't exist. 
Rewriting a huge application for Linux is frequently not an option that
can be justified financially for the 3 extra customers that can be
brought in.  Thus, porting becomes an option.

Message-ID: <Pine.OSX.4.62.0502040806340.2386@arrowhead.galois.com>

Here's some more fun with Pine on Mac OS X...

The osx build of pine doesn't include a default search path for 
mailcap, the little database that maps MIME types to applications, so 
pine doesn't know how to launch helper applications to view 
attachments.

The workaround, however, is pretty easy:

1. Modify .pinerc so that it knows how to find mailcap:

    mailcap-search-path=~/.mailcap

2. Create a simple ~/.mailcap file that essentially relies on open(1)
    and LaunchServices for all its MIME savvy:

    application/*; /usr/bin/open %s
    audio/*; /usr/bin/open %s
    image/*; /usr/bin/open %s
    video/*; /usr/bin/open %s

That does it. Pine is now able to launch attachments without any 
trouble.

I'm reluctant at this point to turn everything over to open, but 
perhaps someday my .mailcap will be a one-liner :-)

  */*; /usr/bin/open %s

Well, progress has been made. I spent considerable time Wednesday 
updating the BIOS. I had to run the winders executable a bunch of times. 
First I was getting a message that it failed due to a previously 
unfinished update. Then it failed with a different error message. I was 
googling Dell's support, and M$'s web site for help. I was about to give 
up, but ran it one more time, and to my dismay, it worked. Pretty 
typical of that OS.
So, yesterday I moved on to getting X working. I followed the 
instructions from the aforementioned link above. I am at the point where 
I get the K login screen, but when I log in I find myself running TWM 
instead of KDE. Also, I am not at full screen yet, but at least X is 
working.
I received my 3Com 11g wireless PCMCIA card earlier this week. And the 
Linksys WRT54G the week before. Any plans for a wireless clinic again?

Ovid,

   Perfect example: MapInfo (desktop mapping/GIS). I stopped upgrading in
1998, but I have many project still dependent upon maps and analyses done
with this software. There ain't no linux equivalent that's worth the effort
to convert all the data. And, it's proprietary software so there's no way to
port it.

   However, to see the problem from the other perspective, I've used VMware
since the pre-1.0 betas to run MI and my GPS software. So that is an option
that provides the best, IMO, solution: run everything you can on linux and
fire up a virtual Winduhs machine for the critical app that cannot be
replaced.

Thanks; I'll give that a shot.  I don't know enough about XSLT to have
figured that out on my own.  What I did instead was put 'AddDefaultCharet
iso-8859-1' in a <Directory/> block and now everything seems copacetic.
Apache 2 (or at least the config shipped by RHEL/CentOS) defaults to UTF-8.

Thanks to all.  I did some looking last night and according to my quick
look at Jeffery Zeldman's, "Designing with Web Standards" ( which I just
discovered and am reading ) the W3C makes the server method preferred
so I'll have to do a little more research and then make sure it works
for/with the designer/coder's tools and process.

Yes, this is likely the cause.
FreeBSD's ipfw has a way to prioritize ACKs that have little ot no payload, 
and this helps tremendously on cable. (of course, pf+altq can do it too)

I don't know if linux can do the same ... but its much better than throttling 
bandwidth all together!

No, those seem to all be old posts.  I think those are from the bzipped
mbox file I created a couple months ago when someone wanted to download
the whole archive.  Let me remove that and re-generate the archives.

Funny; there seem to be a <a name="#end" /> tag in the footer to begin
with.  I've added link from the header template.  I don't want to
regenerate the archives again (it takes a *long* time), but you should
see if on the Feb 2005 page when it adds recent posts.

Possible, and a number of folks have suggested such a thing, but seems
strange to me. Notably TCP doesn't need a low RTT to work, and BitTorrent
doesn't care about latency at all only bandwidth.

The one bit of speculation that seems true is the observation that
because payload packets tend to be large, they crowd out the smaller ACK
packets in buffers. Depending on the buffering algorithm you end up, if
an ACK packet arrives first at your DSL/cable/modem box it gets into the
buffer and there is still room for a large packet so it will take a
payload packet if it arrives, if a payload packet arrives it will fill
the buffer to the point where it cannot accept a full packet so it will
drop anything that comes before it empties. This payload can follow ACK
but ACK cannot follow payload theory, might explain payload going through
and jamming the ACK packets. At least this is one theory I've seen, I'd
love for a network person to chime in and say this is or isn't true.

If the problem really is TCP ACKs, then traffic shaping could be very
effective. You don't so much want to limit upload, as ensure that ACK
packets get higher priority than payload packets. The easy way to
distinguish these would be to take packets smaller than 128 bytes (or so)
and give them higher priority.

I have looked at this program before and could not get it to work as expected.
I was trying to convert a deb package to a RPM package.  It complained about
dependencies and would not convert.

Any help?

I've downloaded the last couple releases of CentOS with BitTorrent
about as fast as my connection would allow (~700K/sec). The key, I
believe, is to have sufficient bandwidth for all the peer to peer
traffic, requesting pieces and such. I usually allocate about 50K/sec
up to get 700K down.

Also, if you're behind a firewall, it's very beneficial to forward
some ports to your system and tell your client which ports you have
available. The default ports are 6881-6889, if I remember correctly.

Hm.  Well, I've always used it on Debian, and the few times I've gone
DEB->RPM I had no problems.  The converted Wondershaper RPM is here:

> Any help?

Sorry.  Haven't seen that before.  If I knew something about what sort
of system you were running it on, what you were trying to convert and/or
what the error messages said, I might be able to help.  More likely,
I'd just be able to say, "I dunno" more authoritatively. ;)

Those were all caused by '^From ' lines in the messages that were not escaped,
as a result of importing them from the old version of Mailman.  I did a
little work with sed and got it down to three messages, then I discovered
'cleanarch' in the Mailman distribution, which was made to do just that.
Now after having run that and after 93 minutes of re-building the archives,
the remaining three are gone.

Subject: [PLUG] Samba vs nfs
Message-ID: <1107622927.9299.8.camel@itchy.crisponions.com>

I recently built a share on my linux server that I am sharing with
windows machines via samba.  I would also like to share this share with
my linux machines as well.  Problem is, if I mount the share via smbfs
it only allows read/execute access to users and only root has write
permissions, windows clients can write to the share without problems.  I
need my linux users to be able to write to this share as well.

What I was wondering if it is possible to share a folder using 2
different methods.  From my server can I share the folder via samba and
also share the folder to my linux machines using nfs, or will I risk
possible data corruption.

Thanks

Long shot. I had taken a few to Wacky Willies about a year ago,
but that was to his now closed Aloha store. They could have moved
to the NW store.

Mine where from the Tek 6200 but where exact other then jumper
settings.

BTW that store may be closed soon

I can only answer anecdotally, but I've managed Linux servers 
exporting files simultaneously via nfs and smb. I've never had any

Check the force keyword for your shares.  You can force a group

I have done that, I have force user and force group set on the samba
server.  Could it have to do with the way I am mounting the share?  I am
using mount -t smbfs as apposed to smbmount.

The problem with multiprotocol filesharing has to do with the differences 
between locking mechanisms in NFS and CIFS when two users are accessing the 
same file simultaneously using the different protocols.  If your kernel and 
samba implementation supports CIFS opportunistic locking, you shouldn't have 
this problem...

This feature has been available for some time on proprietary systems like 
Netapp Filers and some commericial *nix implementations for some time, so it's 
pretty mature and fairly common practice these days.

Max

Subject: [PLUG] ncftp - delete directory problem
Message-ID: <200502051021.58714.rsteff.l@comcast.net>

I've been using ncftp to upload my latest web project. I put up a preliminary 
site a few weeks ago. Since then, I've changed the name of one of its 
directories. However, when I connected to the Comcast site, ncftp was unable 
to either change the name of the directory on their server, or delete it. 
Instead, I got a message telling me that I wasn't the owner, and thus was not 
allowed to delete the directory. I had no trouble deleting files, nor did I 
have any trouble creating directories.

I don't remember ever having that problem with Comcast sites when I was using 
Dreamweaver to manage them, so I went into the site via Dreamweaver on my 
Win98 machine. From there, I was able to delete the old directory.

I assume there must be something I'm missing, but from reading the ncftp man 
page, I'm not sure what it is, since that page warns that deleting 
directories may not be supported due to ownership issues.

Any ideas?

The smbmount command is just a wrapper around the mount -t smbfs
command.

One option I haven't seen anyone mention is port the application to 
VisualBasic .NET and then run it under Mono.  I don't know how hard is 
to go from VisualBasic 6.0 to .NET, or how complete is the Mono 
VisualBasic support.

Another option is run the .exe under Wine.  My impression was that 
VisualBasic runtime is fairly well supported with Wine.

I've got a 200 lb paper weight of a Fujitsu M2444 (1/2-inch 9-track
reel-to-reel) that I am trying to restore to some function.  I've got
a crappy old ISA interface card that came with a DOS user-space driver
that is mostly useless (I could boot DOS on an old ISA equipped box to
access data, but it would be highly unpleasant).

I can get a Pertec-to-SCSI converter, but they are $1000+ and
definitely outside the realm of practicality.  In my ebay/google
research last night I discovered that the M2444 were once connected to
Sun boxes with these Xylogics 472 cards (which weren't SCSI, therefore
must have been Pertec) using an xt (as opposed to st) device.

A Sun box interface would have the nice feature that it would be
easily network accessible and thus I could get access to the tape that
way.

In the fall of this year, I will start paying for hosting for my various

connection.

I know my uses are low-traffic, but I'm not sure how low. I'd like to
know how many bytes per month are transferred with SSH, with smtp, with
http, etc. How can I keep track of how much bandwidth I'm using and how
it's being used?

When I move to paid hosting, I'll be living with a hard cap of per-month
transferred data. What can I do to cripple my system or throttle it down
when I get near the cap?

Thanks!

In theory, yes. In practice, if users are accessing same files
simultaneously, locking is unreliable even with one protocol, and it's
not just linux nfs issue, I've seen very flaky nfs behaviour on
solaris and hpux as well. Basically, once you have a heterogeneous
environment, if your file locking seems reliable, you haven't stressed
the servers enough. They will start giving intermittent errors under
load. So you basically have to accept that you're taking chances if
you are support concurrent accesses.

Probably none at all.  You'd be surprised by how little traffic you actually
generate.  With the handful of sites I host on my DSL pipe, including the
PLUG mailing lists and web site and a number of other lists and sites,
my actual traffic is rarely over a couple hundred kilobytes per second.

See the graph[1] from IPCop of my last month of traffic.  The blue represents
outbound traffic and the green in-bound.  The higher-traffic blue is from
me running a couple of torrents of CentOS and SuSE ISOs; compare that with
the other times when I'm not running torrents.

You'll see occasional in-bound spikes; these are from downloading things
like the latest CentOS 3.4 updates and such.

Hi Fedor,

Agreed, there are certain risks. NFS locking is more of an after thought in many
environments, and samba doesn't exactly have deep integration with the
underlying unix filesystem, however for light or moderate use, its a lot less
expensive than doubling disk or using seperate fileservers.   Also, keep in mind
that Microsoft essentially permits you to do the same thing if you are running
the NFS service on their fileserver product... and I personally have had fewer 
issues with the penguin/samba(or CIFS)/nfs combo than the windows/CIFS/NFS combo.

If the server is going to be heavily loaded enough to break things and/or
mission critical enough where having an occasional borked file is not an option,
then it might be easier to justify the disk overhead, seperate server or a
commerical product like a Netapp filer or EMC NAS box. 

Regards,
Max

I have a fully updated RH9 system in which I recently tried adding
additional uids.
The results using either the GUI tool or useradd are the same.

The uid is created. E.g. in /etc/passwd along with a home directory, but I
cannot log into the account.

When I "su - uid" from root, there are NO error messages generated find I am
still operating as root.  There was no change of account to uid.  If I ^D,
the window closes (that is I am not running in a sub-shell)

If I attempt logging in from the login prompt the uid and password are
accepted, but there is a immediate exit.

The message from the GUI login is that the seesion lasted less than 10
seconds and that there may be a configuration problem.

The text login shows the "Last login" line and exits immediately.

I can find to messages in the the security logs that shed any light on the
problem.
There is just the entries about the logins and logouts.

What possible "configuration" problems could cause this?  There are other
uids that I created prior to this that work fine.  

Where to look next ?

I managed to resolve this one myself -- After posting the question.
This was a dumb mistake.
I had stepped on the /etc/skel/.bashrc file.
Soon as I fixed that, the problem disappeared.
I guess the moral here is to be very careful in /etc/skel.

Did you run passwd for the new account, as root?  You will need to
define a password before you can log in.

If you have, I'm guessing there's a problem with your login scripts,
/etc/profile, /etc/bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bashrc (maybe something
from /etc/skel/).  Try commenting things in those files.

Also, make sure the default shell is /bin/bash, in /etc/passwd, unless
you specified another shell.

iptables and ifconfig.

One of the numbers provided by running `ifconfig` on an interface are the
counters for traffic in, and out. Won't include everything, notably I
don't believe the entirety of the ethernet frame is accounted for,
however this does give you a good outline.

Sounds like iptables is more what you want. iptables includes counters
for both byte count and packet count processed by every rule. Simply make
a rule that matches packets to/from the particular port pointing at the
ACCEPT target. Packets to/from that port will be included in the count
for that rule, but will not be included in the count for the next rule.

Traffic shaping.

Designate high, medium and low bandwidth points. Once you've exhausted
the high bandwidth point, slow things down a notch; once you're past the
medium point, slow things down another notch. Ad nauseum.

The Netapp boxes are great if it's in your budget. I've never run into 
problems with them doing both CIFS and NFS with the same shares, even 
under pretty heavy load. They are expensive, but for really misson 
critical file serving I think they are well worth it. My experience with 
their service has been excellent, too.

I haven't actually had problems doing this under Linux, either, but I've 
never had to do it under nearly as intensive of a load...

I'm not sure what part of the man page you mean. I do see this:

"If you need to delete a remote file you can try the rm command. Much of 
the time this won't work because you won't have the proper access 
permissions."

That's just saying you need the rights to delete the file or it won't 
work. That should be the case with any FTP client, FTP is a fairly 
simple protocol.

What did the ownership and the permissions on the directory look like? 
Or is it too late to know because you deleted it? It's hard to discuss a 
problem involving ownership/permissions without those kind of specifics.

an external 9-track scsi tape drive.)

Contact me off list and I will get you more info on what I have.

I have a Sun SCSI 9-track tape drive.  Would that work?

Yes. I did see that entry in the man page, and that's the one to which I was 
referring. It was a day or so after reading it that I went back into the site 
with Dreamweaver and deleted the directory, so I apologize for the post being 
unclear.

It seems odd to me that I don't have permission to delete a directory that I 
create on a space that is assigned to me. Maybe it isn't ncftp that I'm 
having trouble understanding, but FTP in general. I assume that Dreamweaver 
is using FTP, based on comments in their site setup screens, but maybe they 
have something additional going on.

I'll try to give it another shot later today. I can just go create a directory 
and then not be able to delete it to get the error message. :-) I can always 
delete it with Dreamweaver.

Thanks for the reply.

Dick,

   When you are logged into the ftp server you can use both "ls" and "dir" to
list the contents of a directory. The latter is equivalent to "ls -l" and
will show you owners and permissions.

Subject: [PLUG] Two default gateways?
Message-ID: <20050207174215.GB15709@loki.dsl-only.net>

Hello Linux folkz,
Is it possible to have two default gateways
for the each host on internal network?
How to setup them?

I have the following network topology:
1. DSL modem connected to the switch_1
2. Two servers SW1 and SW2 with their own separate Internet
static IP's connected to the switch_1 via eth0 interfaces.
3. Two servers SW1 and SW2 with their own internal static IP's
but the same mask 255.255.255.0 and network address 192.168.1.0/24
connected to another internal switch_2 via eth1 interfaces.
4. The rest of the hosts on internal network connected to the switch_2
via their single eth0 interfaces.

What I want to achieve is to specify two default gateways for the each
host on internal network.
In case if SW1 or SW2 server goes down, each host still will be able
to access
the Internet.

Could somebody please enlighten me on this issue.
Many thanks in advance,

Alex

Your problem there is going to be that your internal hosts have no
mechanism to mark the failed gateway host as being down. They'll either
continue to load balance between the two gateways, and half your traffic
will be dropped, or they'll pick one of the two gateways for all of
their traffic, and continue to send all of it to that one even if it
goes down.

You could look into using VRRP for linux - if you can get that working,
your two gateway machines will each have a "real" internal ip address,
such as 192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1.3, and they will have an election so
that one of them will always respond to a virtual ip, such as
192.168.1.1.

You would then point just a single default on your internal hosts at the
virtual ip, 192.168.1.1. When one of your gateway hosts goes down, the
VRRP process informs the other one to take over the virtual ip address.

I've never done this with linux, but did get some Google hits with VRRP
and linux. This a very common configuration with dedicated router
hardware, like Ciscos using HSRP or (now that they support it) VRRP.

Should have added that you could also use Zebra or GateD to run OSPF
on all of your hosts, and advertise a default route from each of your
gateway machines.

Hi Alex,

I'm assuming this setup is for redundancy and not necessarily loadbalancing, so 
if I'm incorrect in my assumption please let me know.

I would first suggest a better option: would it be possible to run VRRP/CARP on 
the two linux gateway server?   This would eliminate the problem all together, 
as both servers can represent a single (or multiple) virtual routers to the 
client  machines.

If that is not an option:

If the clients are Windows 2000 or XP, i believe you can specify multiple 
default gateways (under the NIC configuration---> TCP/IP ---> Advanced)... ON 
linux, you can run a routing protocol on the gateway servers and client (RIPv2 
is the most common) and loopbacked aliases or iproute with policy routing 
enabled in the kernel of the client machine.  


Regards,
Max

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0502071054170.24330@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   There is a non-profit organization to which I belong (they're located in
the midwest) whose web site cannot easily take input from users and has some
niggling problems. They've created the site with M$ FrontPage 5.0; their ISP
runs w2k and IIS-5.

   If it would not be a major hassle for me, I would like to offer to redo
their site using xhtml and css. But, I don't know how much of a hassle it
might be, whether there are SSI available (e.g., for submittal of abstracts,
changing one's membership information and other interactive functions), or
if it's worth even trying. I doubt very strongly that the ISP (which seems
to be a computer shop offering e-mail and web hosting services on the side)
would consider a F/OSS solution.

   My question to those of you with experience in a heterogeneous OS
environment with web servers is whether or not it would be practical to
offer long-distance assistance given the architecture involved.

Can you could send us the link so we could have a look at the website.

Sure, depending on how things are set up. You'd need to ask the hsot 
about what technologies they have available.

If you're going to move them off of Front Page then I'd get them on a 
Unix box at the same time.

Rich,

Looks like it should be fairly straight forward.  I was worried when you 
mentioned IIS and Winders that they might be using ASP or .NET for some 
of their forms but that doesn't appear to be the case.

No, there can be only one default route. You can set up another route
overlapping the default one and give it a higher hop count using
"Metric" option to the route command. But that does not solve the
problem of failover, your connection will keep trying to use the
default route.

What you need goes beyond the capabilities of Linux kernel routing,
you need additional software like Zebra:

I come across a need to generate pass phrases but so far what I've found 
generates mostly nonsense word combinations.

Any suggestions for a method or software to generate semi-sensical pass 
phrases?


TIA,

Even if you can get failover on your gateways (which seems tractable),
you'll also have the problem that each gateway machine is going to
have it's own idea of NAT conntrack state.  Any open connections
through the machine that goes away will die.

There are lots of password generator scripts in PHP, and a lot of them
have a flag to select 'pronouncable' passwords. I'd start by searching
the PHP script archives. Then you can translate to whatever language you
want. 

I think I've seen a bunch of these in Perl also.

dir reports that both the owner and group of all entries is pwpuser, and that 
the permissions for files is -rw-r--r-- while directories have drwxr-xr-x. 
From that it appears that the owner, and only the owner, has read and write 
permission for both files and directories, and since I can delete files I 
should be able to delete directories. However, when I try that I get the 
message:

ncftp / > mkdir testDir
ncftp / > rm testDir
delete testDir: server said: testDir: Not owner

I log in with my account name, which in this case is rcsphoto. Somehow, I 
become pwpuser, pwp standing for "personal web page" in the Comcast system.

I tried adding the -u :

open -u rcsphoto ftp://rcsphoto at upload.comcast.net

but it did not change anything about the way I was logged in. I can still 
delete unwanted directories by going in through Dreamweaver, but I'd like to 
figure out how to do it without using Win.

Paswords are not a problem.. Passphrases are what I need.  Approx. 44 
characters ( 6-7 words ) in a fairly easy to remember order.

	Miranda greped the kingdom fleeing the dragon.

Well that leaves a lot to be desired but hopefully shows what I'm looking 
for.

My google searches only turned up one thread from circa 2000-2001.  I
grabbed the tarballs and hopefully they will have some good code to work
from.

Otherwise the guy with the worst grammar in the world will have to build a 
sentence constructor.  Come to think of it I'll hit the Portland Perl 
Mongers.  I seem to remember a program to -- recombine -- a 
paragraph into some kind of poetry or haiku.

That got me thinking so I did a search for haiku and perl.  Found a thread
from last Janurary.  Not code but haiku about perl.

I've played with the wordnet dictionary a little bit, and at one point 
was working on a random sentence constructor in perl.  Does that 
count?

How much sense do they need to make?

A cerebral tibetan mastiff could slosh thievishly after an cream puff.
An archducal thievery were officiate daily except the soursop tree.
The mini terrain was abye unpatriotically along an aftercare.
An longed-for hind end to be stag injuriously on an bean beetle.
An loverly stand oil would get behind peacefully under a 
psittaciformes.

The articles, verb tenses, etc still need work, and I'm a long ways 
from anything very conversational, but it does occasionally turn out 
some memorable phrases.

Another thought would be to grab a pile of texts from the Guttenberg 
project and randomly pull sentence fragments out of those, but maybe 
those would make too much sense.   Playing around with some simple 
grep and using perl to strip/randomize gives some real stinkers, but 
there's not a lot of science in that 10 minute experiment.

How about:

Col's Random Sentence Generator
http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~cmf/generate/

  You could feed it the docs directory in the kernel source tree or
something off of the Project Gutenberg as the source.  How about Moby Dick?

One of the great things about the web is that an HTML link can go from
an "uptight site" to another that provides the capabilities necessary.
If their ISP is wierd, and they don't want to move everything, then
simply move the few troublesome interactive pages to another (F/OSS)
server, perhaps under control of the actual individual that deals
with the data.  Over time, migrate the site page by page.  There is
no need to put everything in one place.

I wouldn't want to keep critical data on a site that ran M$ 
insecure-ware, anyway.  The downside is that for proper SSL
certs, somebody will have to pay some money.

Lots of professional organizations divide up the tasks this way.
Often, when there is money involved for example, they use specialized
professional sites that are set up for this.

The Linuxfest Northwest 2005 schedule is taking shape for Saturday,
April 30 in Bellingham WA.  I gave a talk there last year, and it
was a wonderful experience - great speakers and great audiences,
and hundreds of Linux people from all over the Northwest.  

I can't make it this year (a good friend has a wedding scheduled
that day :-) ), but I strongly suggest that the rest of you try to
make it.  And for those of you that have given talks at PLUG or
Advanced Topics in the last year, here's a chance to re-use those
slides.  Please volunteer!  It would be especially cool if some folks
from the Portland State Aerospace Society, or from Freegeek, or one
of the other exciting Portland area projects presented up there
( Eric Harrison has already given some great talks about K12LTSP ).

If you will be in the Detroit area in late April, then you should
schedule a visit to Penguicon 3.0 in Novi, Michigan on April 22-24,
2005.  Penguicon is a combination Linux and SF convention, with
both F/OSS luminaries ( ESR, Jon "Maddog" Hall, Nat Torkington,
Cory Doctorow, Cdr. Taco) and SF authors (Joan Vinge, Wil Wheaton)
attending.

I went to Penguicon 1.0 in 2003;  the technical tracks were
educational, the SF tracks were fun, and I got to hang out with
old and new friends.  At the Geeks with Guns SIG, ESR taught SF
author Terry Pratchett how to fire a pistol, and later we taught
him how to install Debian (we learned he was a True Hacker at
heart).  An odd time was had by all!

I was looking at online travestry generators and thought of Project
Guttenburg and how neat it would be to have stuff from the "Lost World" or
"Tarzan" re-made into almost sentences.

Zippy was burned into my brain after I sent an email to a woman I know

Subject: [PLUG] The solution to World Domination
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0502071603330.19670-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

After a particularly "interesting" session with a user I have determined
the solution to "World Domination".  All personal computer and Internet
users will have to be licensed.  This will require that they take a test 
of minimal computer use competency.
   It would consist of questions like:

      What is the difference between a right and left click of the 
mouse?  Left-handers that have reconfigured their mouse get extra credit.  
( Heck they should pass. )

      Where is the start button?

      Which socket in the modem does the wall "line" plug into? ( plus
three points if they can find their modem -- minus 10 points for selecting
the Ethernet socket )

      Where/what is the desktop?

      What are all those funny little pictures on the desktop called?

So we knock out ( in a fit of kindness ) 75% of the computer users.  Then
20% ( or whatever is left over ) convert to Linux, MAC, BSD, or other UNIX
when Microsoft goes out of business.

World Domination!

I'm sure this has been proposed before but it is a pretty harmless way to
vent on a Monday!

Thanks for allowing me to spread these bits and bytes.  You've been a 
wonderful audience.

Woh!  I hope she understood or was a friend.

I just looked her ( Tallulah Bankhead that is ) up:  I like her style --

I don't know what's happening there Dick. You might see if the Comcast 
people can explain more details about what is happening with the user 
change you've mentioned. I've never heard of a host doing that.

You might also ask about this on whatever forums/mailing lists there are 
for ncftp. With an ISP as big as Comcast, chances are that other people 
have run into the problem before.

I was thinking along those lines yesterday. I think that will be my next step. 
I believe they have an e-mail based help system for lower priority things, 
but if not, they have a java app for interactive help over the web.

Good point. It's about time I started looking for these groups.

Thanks for having a look.

Hi,

Not a Linux question, I know, but ...

I'm using Vim 6.2.457. Every time I try to edit a new file using "e
$filename" or switch buffers with ":bn" or ":bp", I lose the undo
stack. Does anyone know how to preserve that?

Thanks.  I never knew about that option (duh!).  Seems to work.

I assume the only overhead is additional memory usage?

As a follow-up, is it possible to maintain the undo stack between 
invocations?  (I haven't yet trained myself to maintain one vim window 
and shellout often, rather than write/quit and reinvoke.)

No. viminfo file is where you store persistent data between invocations.
You can save lots of things in viminfo, but undo stack is not one of
them. do ":h viminfo" from vim to read the help file.

Subject: [PLUG] SNMP Agent CPU Hog + Timeouts
Message-ID: <6877-94934@sneakemail.com>

PLUGgers:

I just set up SNMP monitoring for some of our older Red Hat Enterprise
2.1 systems using the RedHat-provided ucd-snmp-4.2.5-8.AS21.4.  The
snmpd process chews up a LOT of CPU time immediately after it gets its
first request, so much so that queries time out.  This is despite my
attempt at a really, really basic configuration:

----- snmpd.conf -----
####
# First, map the community name "mycommunity" into a "security name"

#       sec.name  source          community
com2sec notConfigUser  default       mycommunity

####
# Second, map the security name into a group name:

#       groupName      securityModel securityName
group   notConfigGroup v1           notConfigUser

####
# Third, create a view for us to let the group have rights to:

#       name           incl/excl     subtree         mask(optional)
view    systemview     included      system.sysDescr
view    systemview     included      system.sysObjectID
view    systemview     included      system.sysContact
view    systemview     included      system.sysName
view    systemview     included      system.sysLocation
view    systemview     included      system.sysUpTime
view    systemview     included      interfaces.ifTable
view    systemview     included      ip.ipAddrTable

####
# Finally, grant the group read-only access to the systemview view.

#       group          context sec.model sec.level prefix read   write  notif
access  notConfigGroup ""      any       noauth    exact  systemview none none

syslocation Data Center
syscontact UNIX Admins
------

A system call trace of the snmp agent when it's wedged (strace -p
<PID>) shows that it's strobing through /proc and RPM contents of the
host.  There's no access to that data, so there's no need to collect
it.  I may want to enable disk monitoring, so I don't want to use the
snmpd.conf directive "ignoredisk".

So far, both Google and the Net-SNMP website have failed me:

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=net-snmp+snmpd+high+cpu
http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=net-snmp+snmpd+%2Fproc
http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=net-snmp+snmpd+timeout
http://www.net-snmp.org/docs/man/snmpd.conf.html

How can I turn off the time-consuming and CPU-consuming data collections?

I sent an e-mail to Comcast asking their help regarding deleting a directory 
while logged in using ftp. They sent a lengthly reply in which they explain 
that FTP is the most common way sites are maintained on Comcast, but that the 
only client they "support" is the one you can invoke from a DOS command 
window in Winders. I tried it, and had the same problem: I can't delete a 
directory logged in via ftp. They did not address the question of the changed 
user name.

Another thing they mentioned was:

> You can access your File Locker in Internet Explorer by going to
> ftp://username:password at upload.comcast.net
> where username is your e-mail address without the @comcast.net part and 
> password is your password for e-mail. Then the FTP window will work like

I tried that from Konqueror, but I didn't include my password. No problem, I 
got a dialog that asked for it. I had the usual view Konqueror gives of a 
directory and files. I was able to delete the testDir directory I had created 
with ncftp. This will be much simpler than using another ftp client, so 
that's why, even though I did not solve the problem of deleting a directory 
with ncftp, I consider the issue resolved.

Thanks for all the suggestions.

I was hoping someone more knowledgable would answer this.

I believe the printer is being announced using ZeroConf (Apple calls
it Rendezvous) AKA mDNS.  There's a full implementation out there
called Howl, and a simple lookup util called mdns-scan.  Look 'em up
on Freshmeat.net.

I don't know what printer protocol the thing uses, but I'll bet it
talks LPR.  Might be configurable on the setup webpage.

Keep us posted,

That may be the stupidest thing I've ever heard an ISP or host say.

It's still obviously using the FTP protocol, so I don't know why it 
would be any different. But, if you found an easy way to do what you 
need to, that's cool :)

If Richard wants to find out why one works and the other doesn't,
ethereal might be just the ticket.  Capture both, and see what is
happening under the covers.

Carly Fiorina is no longer running HP.  From the abruptness, it
looks like she was sacked.

A big merger that didn't have the expected returns. Go figure.

Not to be on-topic or anything, but I wonder if this will have
any impact on HP's position with respect to Linux? I was never
clear on how much of HP's Linux strategy came from Carly and
how much came from others in HP.

Thanks for reminding me of that tool. About the only complaint I have 
regarding the SuSE 9.1 personal edition is the lack of tools that are 
standard on the other distributions I've used. So far, I've had no trouble 
getting those tools, but I never know until I try to use one whether it's 
already here, or if I'll have to go get it.

Anyone know of a good online translation -- I tried all likely

I can't be of much help, but Romanian is one of the Romance languages, along 
with Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. Maybe someone with a 
smattering of one of those languages will recognize more than the 
parenthetical part (I think most of us got those) of the messages you 
received. I wonder how you'd say RTFM in Romanian.

This PACE meeting of the IEEE Oregon Section will inform you about the 
newly launched Open Technology Business Center in Beaverton.

Abstract:

The City of Beaverton has just launched its Open Technology Business 
center, and its executive Director LaVonne Reimer, will describe this 
exciting new initiative. The Open Technology Business Center, created 
with $1.2 Million from the city of Beaverton, is a first-of-its-kind 
facility dedicated to supporting the formation, funding and growth of 
new companies in the Open Technology sector. Programs include an Open 
Technology executive institute for advisors, educators, consultants and 
investors. Participating entrepreneurs will have unique access to 
industry thought leaders and domain experts. Qualified early-stage 
companies may locate in the center's facility through its 
"ventures-in-residence" program.

In a press release on the center's web site www.opentechcenter.com 
Executive Director Reimer stated that "the Center will bring together 
the best minds to analyze business implications of the Open Technology 
movement and conduct applied research to new business models. This 
distinctive support will enable Open Technology start-ups to play their 
important role in accelerating the adoption of Open Technology 
innovations and products worldwide."

In her talk Reimer will describe what the Open Technology Business 
Center means to both the broader open source/open technology movement as 
well as to new business creation in the Northwest technology industry.

Speaker Bio:

LaVonne Reimer has more than 20 years experience involving corporate 
strategy and facilitating entrepreneurial growth. Most recently, Reimer 
was founder and CEO of Cenquest, a Portland, Oregon-based technology 
company. In this role, Reimer worked with large university and corporate 
education and IT infrastructure to facilitate web-based distribution of 
higher education. As CEO of a venture-backed start-up in the technology 
sector, Reimer gained extensive experience in all aspects of 
entrepreneurship from funding and software development to marketing and 
strategic alliances. She is a frequent guest speaker in graduate 
capstone classes and seminars for entrepreneurs. 

Before starting Cenquest, Reimer practiced law and taught as an adjunct 
professor at OGI School of Science and Engineering at OHSU and 
Northwestern School of Law at Lewis & Clark, also consulting to regional 
high-tech companies in the areas of business law and ethics. As in-house 
corporate counsel at Tektronix, Reimer managed business litigation and 
internal strategic initiatives including spin-offs, mergers and 
acquisitions. Prior to her years at Tektronix, she was a trial and 
appellate lawyer with the law firm of Ater, Wynne, a firm specializing 
in corporate, venture law and labor and employment matters. Reimer is a 
graduate of Hastings College of Law and Willamette University.

Yeah my later message was sent with egg on the keyboard that dripped from
my face.  I got so wrapped in the first part I never noticed the it.  I
firewalled ftp for the Vserver at the request of the domain holder ( and
left ftp open originally at their request. )  I not too worried since they 
asked for it.

Yes, very much like those. I bought one, and my wife couldn't be happier! We 
went down to FreeGeek and looked at all the keyboards they had in the store. 
There was only one Wyse keyboard, but it was part of one of their terminals, 
and was not a P/S-2 style. It had the right touch, though, and that gave us 
more confidence that the one we ordered from the fellow on ebay would work. 
It came yesterday. My wife's typing speed is back up to normal, again. Thanks 
for the link, Russ.

We did look into these. One of the websites has a lengthy description of the 
mechanics of the keys. Turns out this is the style my wife does not like. 
Thanks for the links, Dan. They helped narrow down the search by providing a 
way to explain why most keyboards "don't feel right."

I installed ethereal, started a capture session, and then ran ncftp again. I 
went through the same process where I created a directory, testDir, and then 
tried to delete it, getting the same "you're not the owner" response. After 
quitting from ncftp, I connected through Konqueror and deleted the directory.

Looking through the captured information from ethereal, I discovered several 
things. First, I need to learn more about minimizing what ethereal is 
watching, or I have to shut down e-mail checking every minute! However, I was 
able to read through and find the place where ncftp sends the rm command to 
the ftp site, and the error message reply. Then I scanned down and found the 
place where Konqueror sends the command RMD and succeeds in deleting the 
directory. So, to see if I really learned something, I logged back in to the 
site using ncftp, created the directory once more, and deleted it with rmd.

Conclusion: Yes, I learned something useful--I now know how to delete a 
directory on a Comcast Personal Web Pages site with ncftp. But, I also 
learned that it is a lot easier to manage the site through Konqueror, so 
that's what I'll be using in the future.

Thanks again, Russ, for the reminder about ethereal.

  Ethereal uses two different filter syntaxes.

  The capture filter uses the filter syntax from tcpdump (pcaplib).  In your
case, the filter would be something like "host <ip addr>".  The capture
filter is entered in the "Capture Options" window when you start new
capture.  You can use "man tcpdump" to see the complete capture filter
syntax.

  The display filter syntax is unique to Ethereal and follows a completely
different format.  You can set the display filter by double clicking on a
display line or hand enter a filter at the bottom of the Ethereal window.

Sorry I'm late on this, been busy and haven't been keeping up. Anyway,
I have had this problem before. You need to use smbmount as a normal
user to mount the samba partitions and have read/write access.

First, you may have to change permissions on the relevant files to
allow a normal user to use smbmount, such as:

chmod 4755 /usr/bin/smbmnt
chmod 4755 /usr/bin/smbumount
chmod 755 /usr/bin/smbmount

Use the following syntax to mount them:

smbmount //server/share /mountpoint -o username=user%password

This should fix all your problems, and from now all your life will be
good and pleasant. :)

I honestly don't mean this as a flame... it isn't meant as one... but
you'll probably find better luck (more standards compliance,
versatility, and a comparable level of "ease of use") using BIND.

DJB's products are good to have as options, but (IMHO) not worth
actually using for anything production.

That's the impression I got after installing it... I've heard good

I will have to second this. DJB puts out a decent alternative, but BIND 
is juat as secure, and in my experience, easier to use.
I would strongly recomend running both inside a jail, which you can find 
many guides how.
I've been running BIND for 5 years, and as long as you practice good 
habbits, there shouldn't be any security issues. The reason a lot of 
DJB's "bounties" have never been collected is because there isn't a huge 
interest in compromising a seldomly used program for a measly $500 or 
$1,000.

If you have or can install the Net::FTP module from CPAN, then it's a 
simple perl script. The following is off the top of my head and hasn't 
been tested (so it may contain bone-head errors :-):

   use Net::FTP;

   opendir( FTPFILES, '.' ) || or die $!;
   my @tosend = grep { ! /^\./ or ! /^ignore/ } readdir( FTPFILES );
   closedir( FTPFILES ) or die $!;

   $ftp = Net::FTP->new("ftp.someserver", Debug => 0);
   $ftp->login("myuser",'mypass');
   foreach $tosend ( @tosend ) {
     $ftp->put( "$tosend", "/remote/dir/$tosend" );
   }
   $ftp->quit;

I've used the free version of AVG for at least 4 years and it has been a 
great anti virus program.  They provide regular updates and some of 
those pesky viruses that Norton required a separate program to remove 
AVG did not require such a program.

Beyond that I can't say. We havent had any virus's in quite a while now.

I worked for 3 years at a place that used tinydns and it worked great. 
This was a hosting company with a decent number of domains (3000+), and 
the only time we ever had problems with it was when there was human 
error involved.

I don't know why you would say this program is not worth using for 
production.

That said, I'm not sure why you're having that problem, Matt. It did not 
work that way when I used it - the same name got returned, even for the 
MX records.

Maybe someone else here will have an answer for you. If not, you might 
have more luck in a forum more specific to that software, or to DNS.

Subject: [PLUG] K3b hangs while loading
Message-ID: <200502110937.06199.rsteff.l@comcast.net>

Odd behavior: K3b loads and runs normally, if it is started up shortly after 
booting the machine. However, if I have a lot of other programs running, it 
will hang the machine. The X three fingered salute doesn't work 
<ctrl><alt><backspace>, nor does <alt><F1> take me to a terminal screen. The 
only thing that seems to work is to hit the reset button. If I start from a 
point of having several programs open, close all but xterm, K3b still hangs 
at the same place, but I still can get to the xterm. I've tried killing the 
process ps ax shows for K3b, but nothing hapens. <ctrl><alt><bs> restarts X, 
but K3b still hangs while looking for the CD drive (the place it always 
hangs). The only way I've been able to get it to run is to reboot the machine 
and start K3b right away.

Knowing that this is not normal behavior for a Linux environment, what should 
I be looking for to enable me to reset whatever needs resetting so I can run 
K3b without a reboot?

I'm running SuSE 9.1 personal, which has the 2.6 kernel. (What else do I need 
to provide to help narrow down this problem?)

I think there are things you can do to run BIND more securely, and those 
have thankfully become more standard practice, but that's not the same 
as saying it's "just as secure." There have been quite a few holes in 
BIND in the pasr that led to root compromises. Now, you don't have to 
run it as root, and you can run it chrooted, and those things help 
greatly limit the damage that can be done. But there were some big 
problems in the code in the past, and I would argue that's not "just as 
secure."

Yeah, I don't buy that either :) I can't believe that there are not some 
skilled people out there with black hats on who have gone through that 
code very throroughly. It wouldn't be just about the money - someone 
could make a bit of a name for themselves by collecting a bounty on one 
of Dan's programs, which are usually regarded as very secure.

For Windows, AVG can't be beat.  For Linux, ClamAV is a better pick.

But BIND 9 was total rewrite by someone skilled in writing secure C, which Paul
Vixie readily claims he is incapable of.  Have there been any root exploits for
BIND 9?  I don't know; there have been a few non-root exploits, but not many.

Perhaps the BIND code is much better now, Wil, I'm not sure. I guess I 
have a lot of bad memories from the old days. I remember one exploit 
that was used to r00t what seemed like half the DNS servers on the Net 
:) I'm pretty sure the last big one I can remember was BIND 4, though.

Still, it is hard for me to believe that even vresion 9 is just as 
secure code wise as tinydns, which is more stripped-down and was written 
with security as a big priority. I'm not saying I won't use BIND. I 
think that when you run it as a non-root user and chrooted, that it's 
not a huge risk. But I also encourage people to try other alternatives 
if they want.

I would be very surprised if there hadn't been less security problems 
with tinydns than even with BIND 9 in the same time perios, and I really 
disagree with that characterization that was made that Dan's tools are 
not ready for production. I'm not a DJB disciple - I would rather use 
Postfix than Qmail any day. But I've seen tinydns run in production and 
it worked great.

Well, you can always run multiple Apache versions, each binding to different
IP addresses.  On the machine running the PLUG site, I have 1.3 running with
mod_perl (because Karl made the site with HTML::Mason and for the Slash-based
sites I run, like http://www.news4neighbors.net) and the CentOS-stock 2.0 for
the regular sites.  I run Pound (http://www.apsis.ch/pound/) on the firewall
to direct incoming HTTP requests to the proper address.  Being able to match
the Host HTTP header and forward to the proper IP address is much easier
than using mod_proxy or Squid and having to fiddle with /etc/hosts to keep
things straight.

F-Secure for Linux catches more viruses than ClamAV.  (Especially
trojans.)  Getting it is more of a pain than it should be.

ClamAV also has problems with false positives on multi-part rar and zip
files.  (Claims they are "oversized compressed files". I have had to
disable that check on scans.)

Of course, if you want enterprise-class virus protection, you should
check out Sophos (http://nakedape.cc/products/software/sophos).  Sophie
is a great 3rd party scanner using the Sophos scanning engine that is a
daemon; I use it in some of my Mail Defender installs.

I believe you can, assuming PHP is running as modules, have two directives like:

AddHandler php5-script php5
AddHandler php-script php4

Where php5 and php4 are the extensions of your files. Adjust
accordingly. Also note you may need an AddType text/html phpX
depending on your configuration.

Hi, back at you.

I'm basically a hardware guy, but I can talk my way around most
technolgy prety smoothly.  I have a general idea of what and how Open
source is/works.  I wouldn't be much good at talking programming
details.

I have taught non-users how to become users in various professiional
settings, up to and including teaching clerk/typists enough electronics
to pass their FCC Commercial Radio Licensce tests.  I know how to make
technical understandable to the masses.

I also have experience on TV.  I did a daily 'newscast' (tongue firmly
in cheek) for 6 months in college (which, even I admit, was long ago!).

You can contact me here or live at 503-281-6557 (Home) or 971-235-9191
(Cell).  I'd be happy to serve as a fill-in or extra help, if you'd
prefer.  I also would be happy to help with any off camera work you
need done.

I've been using AVG for about a year and a half, it's very light weight 
memory wise, very low on bloat, and seems to do a good job. It'll do all 
the traditional email attatchment checking, etc, that you'd expect. 
Updates are released regularly (thinking every week?) My experience has 
only been with the free version, btw.

Hope that helps, Nate

Well, the "more versatility," "ease of use," and "not worth actually
using for anything production" were definitely opinions that can be
argued, but at least on the "standards compliant" front, I hope you

Everyone, thanks for your replies.

I ended up just configuring a BIND9 server to only publish info for it's 
authoratative domain.

I'd still like to know why the djbdns-installer for debian made it so 
that ns and mxz records had their respective type inserted into their 
FQDNs.

Be well,.

Hello!

I use AVG Pro and I find that it tries to update every time I 
start the machine. I have it on a laptop. It came highly 
recommended as apparently it worked when the other vendors 
software did not. One machine out of seven, the only one with 
AVG. I am very happy with it.

As someone who has comfortably using a Mac (and nothing else) for

or a "left click".  What's wrong with just "click"?

Therefore, I would fail this question. :)

Subject: [PLUG] Failing swap cage
Message-ID: <20050212153943.GA8335@gate.kl-ic.com>


In the last few days, I started seeing this error in the log files
of my backup server:

Feb 10 04:13:16 hdg: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error } 
Feb 10 04:13:16 hdg: dma_intr: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC } 

hdg is the backup drive.   I got about 200 of these a night, during
backups of course.

I swap my backup drives every day, though I stopped when I saw this 
error, so I would not risk my other backup drives until I tracked
this down.  Fortunately, there was no apparent damage to the data
on the drive.

The error stopped when I replaced the swap cage hardware.  So, either
the electrical contact pins in the cage have worn out, the fan on the
swap has stopped, or the IDE connector in the back of the cage was
partly loose.  This kind of thing can happen with poor electrical
contact on the IDE connector - the signals become intermittent. 

And that can happen when the cage is being slammed with a new drive
removal/insertion every day - connectors can lose their gold plating,
or IDE cables can work their way loose.  There is a lot of weight
hanging on the IDE plug, and the plug and socket get flexed every
time the cage knocked about.

When I get time, I will narrow the cause down further, but for now,
if you see this kind of problem, check your IDE cable connections.

Interesting you narrowed your issues down to a bad connector.  On my
very old closet server, I receive identical errors in batches when the
drive is in DMA mode.  With 2.4, it didn't work in DMA at all (enabling
DMA would cause the drive to become completely nonresponsive).  With
2.6.9, however, DMA works!  It just pops up slews of those errors.

I don't get the errors with DMA disabled.

I suppose with less data flowing with DMA disabled, the errors might
just be harder to trigger... but it does seem interesting.  I'll have to
swap out the IDE cables the next time the box goes down for maintenance.

Make sure you're using an 80-wire cable (an extra ground conductor for
each signal conductor--reduces errors due to noise, etc.). I installed
an ATA/66 PCI card in an old PowerMac I use as my home server (yes,
Linux). I couldn't even get an IDE drive to work more than a few
minutes until I realized I was using a 40-wire cable (unsuitable for
anything more than ATA/33, IIRC). I still get a fair amount of the
exact same errors Keith is seeing, but they don't seem to cause any
problems. I keep the majority of the drive's partitions mounted
read-only, anyhow (for whatever that's worth).

I suspect that the postmaster messages are due to a) spammers sending 
out messages with (forged) cadtocam.com From: headers, which leads to 
b) remote sites bouncing those messages (erroneously) back to your 
server.

In any event, mail.cadtocam.com doesn't allow relaying:

Yeah, I figure I'll upgrade to an 80-conductor cable.  I have several
lying around doing nothing at the moment.

However, it's only an ATA/33 controller.  :-)

Indeed, ATA/66 is when the 80 conductor cables became mandatory (or even
available).

When I visit a friend in Seattle and use her Mac to check my email, I find

Pete Lancashire asks:
> How many times have you swapped drives ?

Nightly for 1.5 years.  I do disk-to-disk backups, and rotate the
backups to a fire resistant safe.  This means there is always a fairly
recent drive available ("air-gap protected") in case of small fires,
power supply failures, or enemy action.  So that is around 500 cycles
of insertion/uninsertion.   BTW, I saw the errors for two different
drives.  

Besides the nightly drive swap, I have changed relatively little for
a long time.  So it wasn't new software, hardware changes, or proton
decay.  Other theories were an excessively large backup transfer,
bit rot in the in-RAM image, and a failing IDE controller card.  I
run a separate card - faster, and I don't lose the mobo if static
takes out the IDE connection during swapping.  If a reboot had worked
(it didn't) and the hardware swap did not, I would work on the other
hypotheses.

Think of electrical connections as piano strings.  Bang on them with a
signal transition ( 1 to 0, 0 to 1 ) and they will vibrate for a while.
If you space out the notes, then the ringing will go away and not get
added to the next transition (possibly making it difficult to detect).
So faster signals can cause more errors.

The extra ground wires in 80-wire IDE cables help damp the ringing. 
This is difficult to describe with easy analogies, but the idea is
that electrical signals always flow in loops, and loops both transmit
wanted energy and receive unwanted energy.  The bigger the loop, the
more signal energy is lost, and the more extraneous noise energy is
picked up.  If you put a ground (signal return) wire right next to
your signal wire, it makes the loop small, decreasing losses and
decreasing noise pickup.  And this minimizes ringing - sorta like
putting a small lead pipe around a piano string.

When I replaced the swap cage, I pulled the IDE cable off the back,
and the plug came off the cage just a tiny bit too easily.  I 
wanted good backups that night, and wanted to make the fix happen,
but my boss\\\\wife wanted me elsewhere, so I did not have time
to do a thorough fault isolation.  I was pleased to see no errors
in the log this morning;  hence the posting to PLUG.

Now it is time to do another drive swap, and make sure the fix stays.

Subject: [PLUG] Getting NFS root to work...
Message-ID: <1108267585.420ed2417a138@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I'm trying to run Redhat 7.3 over nfs.  So far, I have done a minimal 
installation and am exporting that unmodified.  The booting stops at 
freeing kernel memory.  Does the stock redhat 7.3 rc.sysinit file 
need to be modified for network booting to work?

I want to get Redhat 7.3 network booting so that I can set up a
wireless router.  The location where I'm putting the router
isn't a good place for a conventional local hard disk 
installation of Linux.  My wireless card comes with source
code that works under Redhat 7.3 and 9.

Strangely, I can ping my network booted machine, but it never gets
to a login prompt.  The network booted machine gets it's ip address
and mounts the root, but it locks up after that.

I want the specific changes that I have to make to the rc scripts, 
etc.

Do I need more than 32 megs on the remote diskless client?

I've discovered that my D845PEBT2 will network boot my NFS system.  
The only hitch is that devfs doesn't create tty[1-6], but then I 
don't need console access with ssh installed.

I have an ISA network card in the VA503+ that I'm trying to do NFS root with.
I put 128 megs of ram in it, that should be more than enough.  Assuming the
problem could be the ISA network card I've ordered a netgear FA311 to replace
it with.  Has anyone gotten a UM9008 ne2000 clone to work with NFS root?

It could be that the VA503+ motherboard or bios is incompatible, I sure
hope this isn't the case.

Any suggestions?

FWIW, that *is* a very crappy motherboard and you probably will have
issues with it as time goes on.

I own or have owned at least three systems based on the FIC VA-503+.

Use the '\' escape character so that the '%'s are interpreted literally.

$sth - $dbh->prepare("select \* from table where col1 like \%\?\%");

"?" must be an entire value... so you need something like this:

$sth = $dbh->prepare("select * from table where col1 like ?");
$sth->execute("%$value%");

How old/what brand of CD or DVD burner do you have?

I had an instance where I had a bad Burner. 

I could fire up K3b and it work.. *EVENTUALLY*. As it was the first time I
had used K3b, I didn't pay it much mind, thinking that it normal for that
build.. Being more of a h/w nut, and on kind of a lark, I switched out the
burner, and it has fired right up ever since.

It's all fun and games, until someone loses an eye. Then it's just a game:
Find the Eye.

Under the catagory of "Well, they probably know how to manage their

and look at the last entry under the "USA East" section.

I wonder how much fretting there was a Red Hat about adding that one to

also raises some other interesting questions like, I wonder what *they're*

On a related topic, anyone found a good local mirror for the Fedora

It could be that the VA503+ motherboard or bios is not NFS 
root compatible, I sure hope this isn't the case.

NFS boot gets to freeing kernel memory and stops on my VA503+,
but it keeps going on my D845PEBT2 just fine and starts 
beautifully.  There is an irq routing issue on the VA503+, I've
tried syslinux and mknbi-linux where I'm wondering if 
a special kernel paramenter is needed to get the VA503+ 
to NFS boot.  I'm using 2.4.25 patched to 2.4.26 from kernel.org 
and NFS booting Redhat 7.3.  I tested the memory with memtest, it
came up fine.  The ltsp4 boot doesn't freeze on the VA503+, I 
wonder what's different?  I tried switching to an FA311, no 
difference.  The processor is a K6-2 300.  I wonder if switching 
to a Pentium would help?  There are no errors, it just stops 
booting after it frees kernel memory.  I don't want to use an 
expensive Pentium 4 for a remote wireless router, I want 
something that's cheap, throw away, and preferably low power.
Heat tolerant wouldn't hurt either.  It has to take a 100 foot 
ethernet cable connecting it to my server room and an Alan 
Rothberg Cantenna, see http://www.etherdesigns.com.

No rsync eh?

I should have been more specific. I'm looking for an rsync mirror with 
the Fedora Extras. mirrors.kernel.org seems to have them but I can't get

"Public rsync access is also available."
The rsync server is listed on the master fedora site too.

Turned out the system I set up on the Pentium 4 didn't work with it.
Doing a minimal install on the K6-2 directly using a junk hard drive
and borrowing a cdrom, that system is nfs exproted from a different
machine now.  After slight modification, it works just fine.  
Is there a way to install Redhat 7.3 or any newer Redhat on a 
Pentium 4 in such a way that it will work on a VA503+?  My thought 
is that the i686 packages were picked by the Pentium 4.  NFS root 
is a lot easier if you have multiple computers of the exact same 
type.

Getting the wireless card working is another issue.  I tried compiling
the Linux driver for my Zonet Zew1300b on the host system, but when I
attempt to use it on my nfs booted system the driver seg faults and resists
rmmod commands.  I guess I'll have to try and compile it directly on
the K6-2 system.  I can use chroot to install software from underneath.
If I can get this wireless card to go as well, I'll replace the ne2000
when it arrives with an fa311 and be good to go.  My purpose is to build
a netbooted wireless router for mail and a Net backup.  I don't know if
I'll need to install postfix and there's also the question of how to 
get the wireless connection to encrypt.

I wish Redhat had an install root to NFS exported filesystem option, 
that would make doing this a lot easier.  I had to disable all the
consoles in inittab, devfs didn't create tty[1-6].  How would I get
a console if I wanted one?

All of the Howtos I found are missing, "these are the modifications you 
need to do to Redhat 7.3."  Redhat screwed up with their rc.sysinit,
it is almost nfs root ready but not quite.  I probably should remove
run levels 0 and 6 considering that they don't work right.

Subject: [PLUG] emacs keys in an xterm
Message-ID: <20050214211101.GA32407@zaphod.axian.com>


I often have to edit files on remote boxes.  I can ssh into all of these boxes,
but, for various reasons, I can't tunnel X on some of them.  So I use emacs
in console mode.

The problem is that some key combinations that my fingers are used to making
(like Ctrl-Home or Ctrl-Left) won't work in non-windowed emacs.

If I type the following keys in xev, I get:

Home:       state 0x0, keycode 97 (keysym 0xff50, Home)
Ctrl-Home:  state 0x4, keycode 97 (keysym 0xff50, Home)
Alt-Home:   state 0x8, keycode 97 (keysym 0xff50, Home)

The same keys typed into showkey -a in an xterm yield:

^[[1~    27 0033 0x1b
         91 0133 0x5b
         49 0061 0x31
        126 0176 0x7e
^[[1~    27 0033 0x1b
         91 0133 0x5b
         49 0061 0x31
        126 0176 0x7e
^[[1~    27 0033 0x1b
         91 0133 0x5b
         49 0061 0x31
        126 0176 0x7e

So what does this mean?  Is xterm just ignoring the state for keypad keys?
Or is he using some translation table to fold all of the Homes in together?

It's obvious that nothing I can put in my .emacs will allow it to differentiate
between these identical codes.  What should I be looking at instead?  xmodmap?
terminfo?  Something entirely different?

I'd swap out a different one and try to dis-prove the idea that it was a bad
burner.. 

But then I'm more of a h/w guy (as I mentioned before..)

Yes, build your query as a string and then execute it.  :-)

$sql  = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE coll LIKE\'\%";
$sql .= $value . "\%\'";
$sth = $dbh->prepare($sql);
$sth->execute();

Just a matter of style, I think, but I prefer building SQL queries as
strings before executing them rather than using the "?" stuff.  IMHO, it
is simpler and easier to deal with and debug.

I'm sure they utilize some Linux servers (what large company with a
website wouldn't, these days?) and are therefore willing to support the
community back a little bit for it.

Read the note at the bottom of the http://mirrors.playboy.com/.

There was some project I was working with many moons ago that used only
mirrors.playboy.com for hosting... wish I could remember what it was, it
doesn't seem to be there any more (unless it was a CPAN project and I am
mis-remembering).

Not particularly surprising to me.

Thanks for the idea. It'll have to wait for surplus funds, though. Meanwhile, 
when I need to burn, I'll just re-boot first.

Rasmussen here.  Maybe make that "brains by Microsoft" Rasmussen
or "CAS settings out of spec" Rasmussen or "cache lookup failure".

I'm having dental surgury tomorrow and Wednesday. (yes, some people
have all the luck.) And I'm coming down with the cold that has struck
so many.  (Maybe hastened by riding through cold and rain over the 
weekend.)  

The chances of me making it to the AT meeting on Wednesday don't 
look good. The chances of me making it there without a brain impaired
by strong pain medication is ... close to zero.  While it may be
entertaining to observe me trying to think and speak at the same time
under that influence the AT meetings are about information.  

This is a call for a substitute speaker. 

You won't receive eternal thanks, but my beer and wine cellar has some
mighty fine samples.  (Russell Senior can attest to the quality, he's
been to my house for a summer picnic.) If alcohol doesn't float your
boat we'll figure something else out.

Yes, that's a bribe.  Reply to Alan.

And less safe.

If the user has access to what gets fed into $value he can do things
like.

$value = 'something useless%";DROP table';

That's why every perl script with user input must begin with at least

#!/usr/bin/perl -wT
use strict;

Also, don't let scripts that do routine things connect to databases as 
users that have permission to do non-routine things.  If possible, narrow 
the permissions of the database user to exactly the operations the script 
will perform.  It's a pain to create a unique user for each script, sure, 
but at least then you know who's doing what and you don't have to edit all 
of your scripts when one is compromised.

Maybe there's a better way.

Subject: [PLUG] Home wireless network dropouts
Message-ID: <20050215063534.Y94432@grond.sourballs.org>

We've got a small network set up in our house.  The cable modem and router 
are in the basement; two machines are connected to the router by cat5, and 
two have USB wireless adapters.  One wireless machine is in a 2nd-floor 
bedroom directly above the basement router; the other is in another 
2nd-floor bedroom, but at the opposite end of the house.

Connection between the router and the wireless machines is generally good, 
but the machine located farthest from the router (as a wild guess, I'll 
say 35 - 40 feet straight line distance) experiences periods of signal 
dropout.  Connectivity will disappear for 5 minutes, then be ok for 30 
minutes, then drop out for a few more minutes, then be ok for an hour, 
etc.

I'd like to fix this situation, if possible.  I don't think the router can 
be moved, but I wonder if another router might have greater signal 
strength, and if that might solve the problem.  The current router is a 
Netgear MR814v2 - we used to have Linksys but gave up on them because of a 
strange, difficult-to-track-down incompatibility with FreeBSD 
(apparently).

Not really relevant to the situation, but the 2 basement machines are 
FreeBSD, one wireless machine is SuSE 9.1, and the one suffering the 
dropout problem is a Debian (well, a Knoppix 3.3).

Any advice or information would be appreciated.

Thanks-

Which is why $value should always be escaped first.

You might try a wireless range extender (WRE).  The only thing you'd 
have to do is plug the WRE into an outlet, no other cable connections 
are required.  I don't know how well or if they work so maybe somebody 
else on the list can tell you if these work or not.

Is there a microwave oven in the path somewhere? That'll play havoc 
with certain wireless frequencies.

I finally got it working, after finding a HowTo at:

http://tiny-tools.sourceforge.net/emacs-keys.html#case_study_ndash_connection_to

In short, I adding the following to my xterm translation table 
in the X resources on my local box (in my system, in 
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm) *before*
the definitions for the unmodified keypad keys:

Ctrl ~Meta ~Shift     <Key> Home:  string(0x1d) string("H") \n\
Ctrl ~Meta ~Shift     <Key> End:   string(0x1d) string("E") \n\
Ctrl ~Meta ~Shift     <Key> Left:  string(0x1d) string("L") \n\
Ctrl ~Meta ~Shift     <Key> Right: string(0x1d) string("R") \n\
Ctrl ~Meta ~Shift     <Key> Up:    string(0x1d) string("U") \n\
Ctrl ~Meta ~Shift     <Key> Down:  string(0x1d) string("D") \n\


And on the remote box I added these key definitions to my .emacs tree:

(define-key global-map (kbd "C-] H") 'beginning-of-buffer)
(define-key global-map (kbd "C-] E") 'end-of-buffer)
(define-key global-map (kbd "C-] L") 'backward-word)

Sorry, but I've got to ask the obvious question: You've tried pressing 
the Enter key a couple times, right?

Less obvious question: How are you connected to the console, via 
serial port or some other method? What terminal software are you 
using?

Just the one that use 2.4ghz.
Also some of the wireless video sender units use those frequencies.

Hi Paul,

Don't be sorry. Sometimes the obvious is the problem.
But in this case, yes, I hit enter, but it just sits.
I'm connectted via management cable from console port to serial port on 
the computer using cisco equipment.
I know the router will buffer keystrokes, but this doesn't appear to be 
the issue. I even checked the memory and power cables inside to be sure 
they are firmly connected. Is there an internal jumper that would do a 
reset?

TIA,
Harry

And you are perhaps using minicom?  The other question is - do you have
all flow control turned off?  There is none on the Cisco mgmt port.

Others have identified the two common interference devices 2.4ghz phones and 
microwave ovens.  Rather than using another router consider a different
antenna on the one you have.  Stock antennas are pretty low grade.

You might also post this question to the folks at Personal Telco Project - 
lots of experience there.

I've been using dnscache/tinydns since 1999, and continue to do so and
deploy it for clients.  Rsync+ssh is much better for zone transfers, and
I like the separation of authorative server vs. caching.  I may go back
to BIND just to keep up to date with the latest configurations.  I don't
think djbdns will be implementing DNSsec anytime soon which may get
adopted (but has been stalled greatly the last few years).

Using a Cisco RJ-45 to DB-9 cable ? or
a RJ-45 <-> RJ-45 with adpater ?
Do you know if the cable worked before ?

Did you wait long enough ?

If the 2500 has been freshly loaded with new a new
copy of IOS it takes a while to allow user input. I
forget how long but over a minute sounds right.

I'm using minicom, and 9600 8N1 no hw or sw handshake

I just got a 2514 off E-Bay and went through the same
thing.

It has been 5 yrs since I've seen an IOS prompt, this
is going to be a new re-learning exp !!

Try switching to channel 11; that tends to avoid those interfering
frequencies.

Any retail wireless router is not going to have much signal strength they 
put in small transmitters to help protect the home user network any cordless 
phone running the 2.4 GHz is going to have a better transmitter then the 
router he with the biggest transmitter wins in this case you may try 
switching it the A band instead of the b or g. A works on 5Mhz and will 
solve the phone problem you can buy a second router and set it up as a 
wireless repeater an access point might also work, or you can drop a grand 
on a Cisco or foundry product which will broadcast throughout your 
neighborhood

Ah Mike, now I got to shame myself. It's on a windows box.
SIGH, I hadn't even considered using my Linux box to test it with.
But as to the flow control etc., I have the port set with 8n1 and 
nothing for flow control. I'm using the updated Hyperterm version as well.

Cable works, but the boot process freezes.
RJ-45 to cisco adapter to db-9.

I thought about this, and waited 15 minutes. Way to long for it to be 
part of the boot process.

IOS is 11.2, but I don't think it a fresh install.
Just got it off ebay as well, looking towards CCNA, etc.

Well, I still have the labs I did at PCC to play with here, once I can 
get through the bootup.
I could do a reset to default if I could just get through the bootup 
process.
Sigh, so you CAN use minicom to connect to it?
Dang.

Maodhog,

What is your setting for flow control (hardware/software)?  Both should be set
to "no" with the 2500 series.

Also, keep in mind that the 2500 series is somewhat venerable and takes awhile
to boot if you are using a more recent version of IOS (which would be anything
in the 12.x series =) 

It certainly looks like you aren't stuck in rommon, so the only thing I would
suggest is either patience or checking your flow control settings (disable both
hardware and software) in your console proggy.

Regards,
Max

okay, now my dumb question.
What are you calling a break signal?
( the article says this too, but does not describe what it is.
And escape key function or a return?)

Yes.  I sometimes lay my phone down by my wireless card on the laptop 
and the connection dies.  Took me about a week to figure it out.

Been long time since used HyperTerm but there should be
a pull down where you can send a 'break'. Could be 
the freebe HT doesnt have it. I remember something like
that. No use PC as much as can :)

a break is a brief interruption/disconnect of the transmit (data
from you to the cisco) data line.

There's usually menu option "send break".  Hm... I don't see a menu
option for HyperTerm; perhaps it's just the 'Pause/Break' key?  Perhaps
with Alt or Shift or Control?

Okay, the cisco site describe the key combination, but this does nothing.
I've got to got out on a call, but keep thinking. It's bound to be 
something simple and obvious, because we've covered the other stuff. :)

Ctrl-C is a break sequence.

I've one more frustrating thing to try hardware wise, but it will have 
to wait till I get back.

Thanks to all of you so far, it has been informative even if  frustrating.

TIA,

Hi all,

  Just wanted to solicit your opinions about syslog servers. I have read around a bit and am thinking about using syslog-ng and piping it to a mysql database. We are not too concerned about encrypting the traffic etc yet because most of the devices reside on our management vlan. We will have max of 300 devices that will be dumping to it (routers and switches and servers oh my). Dont know what to expect as far as disk requirements so any info you can share about disk usage would be helpful in our planning. Thanks in advance for the advice.

Syslog servers are great if you couple them with proper automated log
watching.  Otherwise, you tend to get too much data to parse through.  I
consider the syslog configuration and log watch analysis to be one in
the same project.

FWIW, I have a 2.4GHz cordless phone that's fairly old (probably one of
the first, before Wifi and BlueTooth were popular) that actually seems
to follow my AP's frequency.  I change the channel and within a week it
has followed it.  If I don't change my AP's channel, the phone continues
to interfere.

A lovely feature.

But how?  Escaping is different for different flavors of SQL.
And why?  When placeholders work for EVERY flavor of DBI.

Do you multiply by adding repeatedly too, just to make sure there's

Dear All,

Michael Dodd, the coordinator for LinuxFest NW 2005 asked me to make a
call for volunteers for this year's LNFNW. 

I've attended the fest since it's inception and I can tell you that it's
one of the most rewarding things you can do. The people are really
friendly and their hospitality is unmatched.

So if you're going to the LFNW this year and would like to help out,
would you send an email to Michael Dodd, "exhibit at linuxnorthwest dot
org?"


Thanks,

How?  I'd have to google it, I don't have a script handy at the moment.

Why?  It's more universal than just DBI.  Make a clean string and pass
that, instead.  Works in every language there is.  :-)

I generally don't do DB stuff in Perl... I've been using PHP and Python
more recently.  I'll do text processing stuff in Perl, but I just
haven't liked the DB stuff as much in Perl as other languages.  Call me
crazy.

Another possible source of interference is flourescent lights.  I had
one once that completely blocked a Linksys 802.11b ap on channel 6.
Moving it to channel 10 (?) fixed it.

I've also had audible interference on a 2.4gig cordless phone from a
wireless ap; if there was any active traffic on wireless there would be
a lot of static and short dropouts.  I finally decided that if I was going
to use cordless phones at all, they should be in a different band.  If
you're using a 2.4gig wireless system, use 900mhz or 5gig cordless
phones.  If you need 2.4ghz phones, use 802.11a (5ghz) wireless.

You can try higher gain or directional antennas to get from one side
of the house to the other.

Quantian is a re-mastered version of Knoppix (3.6)
that emphasizes scientific applications. The most
current version (0.6.9.3) is about 2 GB and runs from
a DVD. I am using this DVD right now.

I suppose that, like Knoppix, it can be installed on a
hard drive. Although it has tons of applications, it
is conceivable that a user might want more. I have
heard others complain that when Debian is installed
from Knoppix, the use of apt-get may be difficult to
configure, and the version of sources.list on the DVD
isn't exactly to my liking. [I wouldn't expect apt-get
to work at all from the CD, since it is now impossible
to install anything system-wide.] Would anyone who has
installed Knoppix on a hard drive like to comment on
this point?

I haven't done this recently, but there are a few things you do have to 
watch out for. First of all, when you run the hard disk install script, 
bail out before letting it install, saving your config file. Then go in 
and edit the config file to your liking and restart the installer, using 
the edited config file.

Second, although reiserfs is a **wonderful** filesystem, if you plan to 
move partitions around with "parted" or "qtparted", don't use anything 
but ext2 or ext3 partitions. There aren't reliable utilities available 
for changing sizes or moving reiserfs partitions yet.

Third, after you get the hard disk install done, you will need to edit 
sources.list.

Now the really tricky part. Knoppix, clusterKnoppix and Quantian all 
have a number of packages that deviate from the standard Debian 
repositories. If you just blindly do an apt-get upgrade or try to 
install packages, you'll end up deleting stuff that you need. I never 
really found an elegant way around this, and gave up on hard disk 
installs of Knoppix and its derivatives.

It's almost as fast, assuming broadband, to do a "sarge" install from 
scratch over the Internet, and install all the packages on Quantian, or 
some subset thereof, or some superset thereof. There's actually a list 
somewhere on the Quantian page (http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian) 
of all the packages that he adds, and it would be very easy to make an 
"apt-get" script from this list.

If you do want to try and work around this, there is a very inelegant 
hack I found. Bring up "dselect". Go into the "Select" menu and "hold" 
all the packages! The easiest way to do this is to sort by section only, 
go to the top, and hit an equal sign ("="). It will give you a fairly 
long list of packages, which you can hold by holding down the "=" key 
till it stops at the bottom. Then hit "Return", and you should be at the 
very bottom of the package list, and all packages will be held -- they 
will stay in the state they're in.

Now you can go ahead and add the packages you want to add. But do it in 
small steps, and watch carefully. "apt-get install" will list all the 
actions it's about to take, and if you see it wanting to delete 
important stuff, when it asks you if you want to do the install, say 
"No". Then go back into "dselect" and hold ("=") everything, and start over.

Bah! That's one of the reasons I went to Gentoo :).

Don't change any jumper settings, unless you have the manual.  You need
to figure out if the router has really stopped booting, or if you have
just lost communication with it.  It looks to me like it stopped
communicating near the beginning of loading the configuration, where the
baud rate of the console is defined, if that rate is different from the
default baud rate, you will have to tell Minicom (dump hyper-terminal it
sucks) about it; fortunately there aren't that many choices (and you
don't have to reboot your computer after each change).

Good Luck,

Derek Loree

Ah brings back memories. In the past with other equip
one may have to 'walk through' all the baud rates.

Did you try the sending a real break, not a character
that performs a break.

Keep in mind that in the 802.11b/g frequency allocation for the US there
are only three NON-overlapping channels. 1 - 6 - 11. All other channels
will bleed over into the neighboring channels causing interference
especially in a dense wireless area.

Have you had a chance to run something like Kismet to find out if there
are other wireless networks in the area. It could be that you're in the
path of 2 low signals and your client card is having a hard time
figuring out which to use. 

Make sure that you have a distinct essid set from any other network that
is not part of your wireless network and that you are on a channel 1,6
or 11 that is not the same channel as any other network in the area.

You do have options with different types of antennas and remember that
your current AP has, at most, a 3dBi omni on it by default. If that AP
is on the complete opposite side of the house and you're on the edge of
the signal "donut" that it creates something you might consider is
moving the device as close to the center of your house as possible.
Otherwise, your sending half of the signal coverage right out of the
side of your house opposite of where you are trying to use it. Adding a
5, 7, or 9dBi omni will of course add to the coverage but you may then
be broadcasting your network further than you really want to. (However,
I highly recommend building wireless networks in your community as you
might expect).

Remember it's not how loud you broadcast your signal outward it's more
about how sensitively your network is able to "listen" to the radio
signals that are trying to use it.

Subject: [PLUG] Switching from Exim to Postfix?
Message-ID: <1108602357.2762.9.camel@localhost.localdomain>


I am planning on switching from Exim to Postfix. Exim's configuration is
a bit more involved than I'd like, so I'm hoping Postfix will be a bit
more straightforward.

This box is handling mail for about 3 people. I'm using Debian sid.

Do both exim and postfix deliver mail to the same location by default? 
Is there anything else I should be aware of or look out for?

Thanks!

Evan

Where does exim drop it?  Postfix uses /var/spool/mail/$USER by default,
using mbox.  That can easily be configured to go elsewhere or use
Maildir.

> Is there anything else I should be aware of or look out for?

Postfix really is pretty straightforward to set up and get going... 'tis
almost idiot proof, although I *have* managed to mess things up a few
times.  ;-)

Well, now, I would have jfgi, but there may be others on this list who
could use the link, may there not?  I figure if you're going to post
about an event, it's better to put up an explicit link (as opposed to an
obfuscated email address) than to require everybody to track one down.

Subject: [PLUG] ssh pass phrase authorization
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0502161813460.25159@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Somehow, I have managed to lose pass phrase authentification when I ssh
from one host to another, either here in the office or from the portable
when I'm away from the office. Used to work; don't know why it stopped.

   I thought that I have the proper options set in both /etc/ssh_config and
/etc/sshd_config but apparently I don't. I've generated keys for DSA and all
known_host files have the public keys for all other hosts.

   What do I need to change in the config files so that I'm once again asked
first for the pass phrase and only after that for my password?

TIA,

Rich

   To follow up: the conf files are OK, there's something with the keys among
the hosts that's not correct. However, in two hosts (working piecemeal), the
files .ssh/authorized_keys are the same on both. So, why I'm not asked for a
passphrase I don't know.

Anyone?

You mean it is asking for the pass phrase for your private key?

Your public key is in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the remote 
host?

Your ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the remote host has the correct (600) 
permissions?

You are running ssh-agent and did ssh-add "privatekeyfile" or you have a 
key in ~/.ssh/identity (mine is a symlink to my favorite private key) 
or you are using the -i "privatekeyfile" option?

What error are you getting (or is it just prompting you for a pasword?)

If it stopped using your key and the filename wasn't ~/.ssh/identity, it 
might be related to an X/wm upgrade (different distros seem to have 
different policies about that.)  I seem to remember something like that 
a while back where debian would automatically use ~/.ssh/id_dsa with 
ssh-agent on startx or something and (then quit?) details are fuzzy.

That's where exim puts it, sort of. On my system, /var/spool/mail is a
symlink to /var/mail, which contains the mboxes.

Debconf makes it even easier to set up! :-)

Thanks for your words of ecouragement. The shift went flawlessly, and
I'm very happy with my choice.

/var/spool/mail is the FHS-canonical location for such things; /var/mail
should be a symlink to that, rather than the other way around.  Of
course, if you're using Debian it's probably based on 10 year-old
conventions.

And since everyone had that same question, let this be a perfect
example of how *not* to announce something. :)

Sure, the dates, hours, address, phone numbers, and URL of your
pet project may be emblazoned into your skull (or bookmarklist), but
if you're asking others for money, time, or "pass it on", please
include all relevant details in your announcement.

*Especially* define random acronyms or terms.  Not everyone has the
same background.  However, I don't think you need to explain the word
"Linux" on this list, for example.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0502170702460.20896-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I'm trying to do this Windows-free but having one heck of a time.

This is the setup.  SOHO network, TRENDnet TE100-P2U1P print server, 
Fedora Core 1 based system, Epson R300 printer.

I've got the TE100 configured and it sees and recognizes the Epson.  I'd 
defined the queue in CUPS (http://192.168.2.107:631/lp2).  The problem 
appears to be the printer needs some additional setup that CUPS can't do.
   When I do a test print I see traffic on the ethernet and the USB
interfaces ( well if blinking lights mean anything that is ) and after
approx. 5-10 seconds of activity the ethernet light goes solid and the USB
light goes out but nothing prints.

I installed the latest gimp-print drivers from the standard yum 
repositories but didn't find this specific printer listed when configuring 
via. CUPS.

I could cave in and plug directly into either my Linux box or really cave 
and plug into the my wife's Win2K box and try a setup from there but I'd 
like to do this network-wise only.

Any ideas as to how to stay Windows free ( well I don't have a MAC so I
can't go that route either :-) and get the printer working?


Thanks,
Rod

   I am not running ssh-agent.

   In ~/.ssh, identity/identity_pub have a timestamp of 2000-02-18 while
id_dsa/id_dsa.pub have a timestamp of 2003-12-06.

   Hmmm-m-m. I'm running X.org-6.8.1 on two hosts (the workstation/server)
and I don't recall if I upgraded the portables from X.org-6.7 to -6.8.1.

   My understanding of the process comes from reading Mick Bauer's book and I
know that the password is passed through the encrypted tunnel whether I'm
here or away from the office. However, using my passphrase when I'm away
from the office adds that modicum of additional security and that's why I'd
like to resolve this issue.

I guess .ssh/identity is for version 1 and id_dsa is for version 2.

Are you using the '-i' option?

Try 'ssh-agent bash', then do 'ssh-add .ssh/id_dsa'.  That should force 
the use of that key.  If you still get a password prompt when you try 
to ssh from inside of that shell, it means your public key isn't right 
on the other end (IIRC.)

If you have password logins enabled on the server, then using a key 
isn't really more secure, just more convenient if it's a passwordless 
key.  The security advantage of using keys comes when you configure the 
server to disallow password logins, so that only the holder of the 
private key (who also holds the passphrase for that key) can login.  
This prevents the social-engineering/guess-my-mother's-maiden-name type 
of attack.

If you really want to add security when you are away from the office, 
configure the office machine with two ssh servers.  One running on port 
22 and allowing password logins from all users, the other running on 
port 26 (or something) with (optionally) only a select list of users 
allowed to login with only dsa keys.  Then get the firewall to forward 
port 22 connections to port 26 on that box.  There are some other 
tricks involved, so let me know if you're interested.

   I was asked for my passphrase when I ran the second command. But, going to
the remote host required only my password.

   Makes sense. However, in my case I could not get to another host locally
or remotely under this condition. Passwords are useful locally; I'd prefer
to be asked for my passphrase when I'm logging in from a hotel somewhere.

   There are only two of us allowed ssh access; that's kept out the riff-raff
running their scripts with the same set of phoney usernames/passwords.

   My firewall is still floppyfw; this weekend I'm going to get the LinkSys
appliance configured and on-line. I don't think I can redirect ports on the
appliance.

   I'll look at public keys everywhere; they're all supposed to be on each
host.

Thanks very much,

It's in there, if you have an up-to-date Gimp-print. I have version 4.2.7 and 
there is a driver for this printer. However, I don't know how well it works.

Direct-connect at least lets you test that the driver works. Bump the logging 
level up to 'debug' and see what you find in /var/log/cups/error_log.

Anyone doing Linux printing should visit linuxprinting.org first. According to 
their table of Epson printers, the R300 works, but not every feature is 
supported.

Thanks Ken,
I did the upgrade as well and that's not it either.
I'm presently awaiting new flash ram and rom for the board as it appears 
this particular one may be DOA.
I was going to wait until it got here to proceed with the discussion 
here, but you are all so helpful I thought it best to go ahead and let 
you know that further testing has to wait for the flash.

As I said, it has to be something simple since the process the router 
works in is controlled by flash rom chip that handles software issues.
Since the board powered up and continued to function as a hub(it would 
pass traffic fro computer to printer)then it appeared to either be a 
connection issue, or some kind of Flash memory corruption. We must now 
wait for the flash to test that theory.

I'll chime back in when it arrives so we can continue this lovely think 
tank discussion.

thanks to all so far.

Harry

It's not unheard of for the console port on the router itself to be bad.
It looks as though the router is booting up properly, and sending output
to the console, but not responding to input on the console.

You also could have a bad console cable, or one with an incorrect
pinout.

I'm rather embarassed to say that I don't seem to know this one: how
does one write a regular expression to match a string followed by
anything but a specific string?

I know about the [^abc] notation, but that is a negative match for any
of those individual characters, a, b, or c, but not for the string a
followed by b followed by c.

What I specifically want to look for are lines that begin with "!Image: "
followed by anything _but_ "Compiled".

So something that looks like this:

^\!Image: !\(Compiled\)

but one that actually works.

Yea, I've considered that as well.
I'm picking up a working console cable today to check that with, and I 
have a second 2507 due in the next week to play against as well.
So, with a little luck, this should be a done deal in 10-15 working days.

If it wasn't passing traffic through the console port I'd be more 
inclined to lean on that theory, but nothing is ruled out at this time, 
including operator error.

Found it! At least with perl regex's:

Matches this:

FWIW I have a laptop that won't send anything out the serial port from the 
keyboard, but it recieves just fine.

i.e. I can see the boot messages on a router, but can't send anything to it. 
It's definitely something wrong with the laptop's serial port, and is quite 
frustrating :)

Does "ssh -v" give an clues?  Are the file permissions on the 
.ssh/authorized_keys
file and all directories in it's path correct?

   Thanks, Don. I keep forgetting about the verbose debug switch. Here's some
output:

debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS
debug2: set_newkeys: mode 0
debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS received
debug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST sent

debug2: we did not send a packet, disable method

   Looking at this, it seems that the originating host sent a public key, but
the attempt failed to be completed. Is this correct?

   Seeing the output of the verbose exchange caused me to look closely at
what I have going here. On salmo:~/.ssh/known_hosts have keys beginning
"ssh-rsa" while authorized_keys has "ssh-dss". Looks like a mis-match
between RSA and DSA. But, that directory also has the private and public key
files id_dsa and id_dsa.pub.

   On host tux:~/.ssh/known_hosts two keys are ssh-rsa and one (for salmo) is
ssh-dss. In authorized_keys, two hosts (tux and lemna) are "ssh-dss" and
salmo isn't specified; I'll bet that's an old (version 1) key.

   Am I correct in concluding that I have an incompatible mix of RSA/DSA as
well as versions 1 and 2 here? If so, perhaps I need to regenerate keys on
all four boxes and re-distribute the public keys to each other via scp.
Messy.

That's correct.  For security reasons, ssh doesn't tell the client the
specific reason why it rejected the public key.  This is only
available in the sshd server logs, and even then I think you have to
have the debug level turned up.

What I usually check:
  + proper key in authorized_keys
  + no line-feeds in authorized_keys on the same key
  + permissions on authorized_keys
  + permissions on .ssh
  + permissions on your home directory

Permissions that are too generous can cause it to fail.  For example,
a group-writeable home directory breaks ssh public key authentication
to protect you from yourself.

If all the above have failed, as root on one of the servers run sshd
in debug mode on some wierd port.  Note that you may need to open this
port in iptables/ipchains first:

# /usr/sbin/sshd -ddd -p 2222

>From your host connect via:

$ ssh -v -p 2222 <host where the above is running>

The "-ddd" debug level should provide some help on finding the problem.

The known_hosts keys are used to identify the servers-- not users. 
This shouldn't affect your ability to log in with public keys unless
one of the host keys is incorrect, in which case ssh should give you a
big ugly warning about a bad host key.

I'll give them a try this evening or tomorrow AM.

I think your fundamental problem is that you seem to have no idea how
ssh authentication works.  I'd recommend that you work on that end,
since until you do these gyrations won't terminate with any greater
understanding, but only when you stumble on something that works for

Hi,

I know many of you folks are advanced in mathematics.  I need a formula
that will take an integer and return the number of its digits:

3	--> 1
25	--> 2
52341	--> 5
032	--> 2 (ignore leading 0's)

Any ideas?

Brute force?

#include <math.h>
int x, y;

y = floor(log10((double)x)) + 1;


or 

int x, y;

y = 1;
while (x /= 10)
  y++;


Untested, of course.

Jason,

A much more interesting problem is how many bits to hold a particular value:

For a given value X:  Log2(X) or Log10(X)/Log10(2) both rounded up if
fractional.

Steve,

   Using 'ssh -2' I'm now asked for my passphrase from salmo to tux, but not
the other direction. Sigh. :-)

   On both hosts, authorized_keys2 have the id_dsa.pub of the other hosts,
but not themselves.

   It doesn't seem to matter if the public key is in known_hosts or not. I
cannot determine if that's a ssh-1 or rsa feature not used in ssh-2 and dsa.
My google search (+ssh +known_hosts) doesn't reveal if this file is specific
to a ssh version or encryption method.

   This evening I'll fire up the portables and try them. In the meantime I
need to get some work done.

Thanks,

Rich

Yeah, assuming you want "base 10 digits", the function you're looking
for is log.  Assuming you're using the Standard C library you want:

int digits = (int)(log(n)/log(10)) + 1

log(n) -> the natural log of a number
log(n)/log(base) -> the logarithm of n in "base" (10 in this case)

n = base^x, log(n, base) -> x

So, a given number 'n', is representable as 1.<something> x 10^l.
You don't care about the <something> all you want is the "10^l" part, to
get the digits (minus the ones place).  Obviously log will give you a
double, but you don't care about fractional digits.

It may not be the most elegant solution, but I simply divide the
number by it's base until the value is zero. However many times you
had to divide should be the number of digits.

The "log10" is probably what I'm looking for.  I should have noted I'm
doing this in Java; and Java has a one-argument 'log()' method, but it's
base "e", and it looks like I need a base-ten logorithm?

This is basically what I have now.  It's just that the method I'm
writing is already called in a loop, so I wanted a single-operation
formula instead of a loop algorithm.

No biggie.  Thanks for the suggestions.

Correction: Not zero, but until the whole part of the number is zero.
Just drop any decimals.

Yeah, in my mail (buried in with the rest of the stuff) is the simple
formula for computing a log in an arbitrary base:

log(n, base) -> log(n)/log(base)

What's your concern?  Speed?  The integer loop is almost guaranteed to

This sounds correct.  I usually use authorized_keys (not
authorized_keys2) but OpenSSH reads both files.

This is correct.  known_hosts is only used to validate that a host is
"known" and there isn't someone intercepting your TCP streams and
doing nasty things to it.  It has absolutely no bearing whatsoever on
public key vs. password authentication.  I suggest that you not worry
about this file at all for now.

Don't sweat this file.  It doesn't affect logging in via key.

Long version of Galens reply:
You might want to benchmark the loop vs the log() method.  I'm not sure 
exactly how java does it or whether it's somehow native in the 
processor, but IIRC from mathematics, logarithms are only computable as 
an infinite series.  So, barring some magic happening in the processor 
that I don't know about, a hand-written log() function (which iterates 
until the desired accuracy is reached (and remember, you're going to 
call this twice)) is going to be slower than your simple reductive 
loop.

Ok, so none of the details are too sharp here.  Point is:  benchmark.  
Don't assume that mathematical elegance is always faster than brute 
force.

Anyway, I'd probably just do length(sprintf("%0.0f", $num)) in perl 
(assuming a positive number.)

   Thank you. It references ssh-1 and I don't see my problem there. I can
connect bi-directionally among hosts. It's getting to be asked for my
passphrase I want to restore.

   And, yes, I do need to work. But, my production editor just sent the cover
proof for my book and some front matter tweaking they want so that's what
I'm doing now.

Almost guaranteed, is it?  Interesting.  I didn't want to convert to a
string, because creating objects in Java is expensive.  Moreover, I'm
using this now to validate for 16 digits, and I'd half assumed that two
logarithmic operations would be better than sixteen divide-by-ten op's. 
Hard to say, though, without benchmarking, as you say.

In any case, I wanted to know the formula (and I got it in spades, thank
you!).  I'll probably time it much later on, when I'm ready to optimize.

Jason,
How can you have leading zeros in an int or Integer?
If it's a literal with a leading zero it will be taken as octal.
My vote is for the ...toString().length() method!

Hi,

I know many of you folks are advanced in mathematics.  I need a formula that
will take an integer and return the number of its digits:

3	--> 1
25	--> 2
52341	--> 5
032	--> 2 (ignore leading 0's)

Any ideas?

Heh.  I *had* fired up CLISP (the ideal desktop calculator) to
investigate.

And folks, the beautiful thing about Lisp here is that the division
there at the end results in a rational number, not a float and not
just a truncated integer like in C.  Inconsequently perhaps, but
beautiful nevertheless.  

These days a hard-core common lisper might scowl at the recursion as
scheme-ish and use LOOP instead[1], but I find yours adroitly elegant.

[1] par example (ugh!):

  (defun numdig2 (n) 
    (loop for digit from 1 
          for val = n then (/ val 10) 
          when (< val 10) do (return digit)))

So you're right.  Good call, Governor!  The log formula was almost a
consensus on this and another list:  and indeed, it's mathematically
sound.  This is the sort of problem that keeps me on my toes!

(Brundege pointed out a rounding error in Java [FPU?] that yields
2.9999999999999996 where it should produce 3.)

So I'm thinking the solution is the divide-by-ten loop idea, since I'm
working from an Integer.

I tried compiling for 2.4.26, the module produced from the 1.2 and

Anyone know where 2.4.26 compatible driver code for the Realtek 8180L

However...if you cast the division result to a float you will always get 
the correct answer.

for (int n = 1; n < 100000000; n = n * 10) {
            double log = (float)(Math.log(n) / Math.log(10));

I asked this question a few years back, and i too got the "use log" answer, 
and proceeded with the standard "d'oh!  why didn't i think of that!".  
Besides accuracy the other thing to consider is performance.  I just did a 
timing test on my machine using an array of 1 million random integers and 
was a little surprised to see that converting to string and getting the 
length took about 30% less time than the numerical log route.  But by far 
the *fastest* method i could think up was this one (which is around 10x 
faster than the string method):

    public int intLen(int val){
        //max =     2147483648 (note, 1 greater than maximum int)
        //10          1000000000
        //9            100000000
        //8            10000000
        //7            1000000
        //6            100000
        //5            10000
        //4            1000
        //3            100
        //2            10
        //1            1
        long absVal = (long)Math.abs((long)val);
        if(absVal >= 1000000000)
            return 10;
        if(absVal >= 100000000)
            return 9;
        if(absVal >= 10000000)
            return 8;
        if(absVal >= 1000000)
            return 7;
        if(absVal >= 100000)
            return 6;
        if(absVal >= 10000)
            return 5;
        if(absVal >= 1000)
            return 4;
        if(absVal >= 100)
            return 3;
        if(absVal >= 10)
            return 2;
        return 1;
    }


The conversion to long is needed for the outlier case of the minimum integer 
(which should be done if you're converting to string too).  Not what i'd 
call pretty, but it flies!

    Hi Travis,

> But by far the *fastest* method i could think up was this one...

    My thoughts exactly.  I hadn't posted before because I was going to do
the timing tests first, but I'm happy to take your word for it.  Following
is my version, which should be faster overall, assuming a random
distribution of input values.

-----------------------------------

public class IntLength
{

  public int calcLength( int in )
  {
    if( in == Integer.MIN_VALUE ) { return 10; }

    if( in < 0 ) { in = -in; } // to positive value

    if( in > 99999 )
    {
      if( in > 999999999 ) { return 10; }
      if( in > 99999999 )  { return 9; }
      if( in > 9999999 )   { return 8; }
      if( in > 999999 )    { return 7; }
      return 6;
    }
    else
    {
      if( in > 9999 ) { return 5; }
      if( in > 999 )  { return 4; }
      if( in > 99 )   { return 3; }
      if( in > 9 )    { return 2; }
      return 1;
    }
  } // end calcLength


  public static void main( String[] args )
  {
    IntLength il = new IntLength();

    for( int n = 1; n < 100000000; n *= 10 )
    {
      System.out.println( "n: " + n +
        "; length: " + il.calcLength( n ) );
    }

    System.out.println();

    for( int n = -1; n > -100000000; n *= 10 )
    {
      System.out.println( "n: " + n +
        "; length: " + il.calcLength( n ) );
    }

    System.out.println(  );
    System.out.println( "min: " + Integer.MIN_VALUE +
      "; length: " + il.calcLength( Integer.MIN_VALUE ) );
    System.out.println( "max: " + Integer.MAX_VALUE +
      "; length: " + il.calcLength( Integer.MAX_VALUE ) );

  } // end main

} // end class IntLength

-----------------------------------

    I'm sure it could be made faster, but this is probably Good Enough ( as
is yours ) for most purposes.

It will depend on the distribution or your data, but if the data is
random, Travis's method will be more efficient.

Keep in mind that about 53% of random 32 bit ints are 10 digits.  Of
the remaining values 90% are 9 digits, 9% are 8 digits, .9% are 7
digits, etc.  

You don't get much leverage by checking whether a number is > 99999,
because like 99.995% are.
 
Jon

Ok, if we're going to really get geeky here,  :-) let's consider space as
well as time efficiency:

Another problem with the easy string-based solution could be object
creation.  The OP's original problem mentioned a number like '032', so it
sounds like it's a string.  So the operation would be;

   String -> Integer -> String -> Compute length

Two new objects would be created per execution.

By the way, JDK 1.5 has a new method, Math.log10() ... which doesn't
suffer from the rounding error.

    Hi Jon,

    Sorry about being loose with words.  I didn't mean technical random
distributions.  My real thought was applications in general rather than,
say, a NASA app that deals with intergalactic distances.  I wouldn't argue
with anyone about it, but I suspect that most ( particualrly business ) apps
don't see 53% of their integer values at 10 digits.

    My selection of > 99999 was purely arbitrary in a binary way.  Again, I
wouldn't argue if someone decided there was a dividing point more optimal
for most applications.

    What I would say, is that the cost of these few statements:

    if( in == Integer.MIN_VALUE ) { return 10; }

    if( in < 0 ) { in = -in; } // to positive value

    if( in > 99999 )

is most likely less than the method call to Math.abs(), the casts and long
comparisons in the previous code.  Using one compare to potentially save 4
compares seemed like a reasonable trade-off to me, especially at this point.
I suspect further optimizations would require a huge number of invocations
to even register.  But I'll be happy to be proven wrong if you would like to
supply the data.

    Let me be clear here: I'm not attacking Travis' code at all.  It's clear
that he posted first and saw that Java's strict definition of type sizes
allowed a solution that is "better" - depending, as always on your
definition of better - than the correct or proper classical solution.  I
just wanted to clarify since you brought up the point.

    I should also mention that I don't advocate "magic" numbers in general;
this is just a special case that Java specifications make valid and is
probably one of the "exceptions that prove the rule."

Speaking of efficieny, how efficient is Math.log10() ? How about 

x = the number itself
int count = 0;
while (x >= 1) {
 x = x/10;
 count++;
}
return count;

Subject: [PLUG] Epson R300, CUPS and printer server?
In-Reply-To: <200502170855.27109.carla@bratgrrl.com>
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0502181631510.30691-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

As a follow up and it kind of gets me out of individual replies I was able
to get a test print out of the Epson and TRENDnet print server from
CUPS ... once.

I tried connecting directly to my FC1 desktop and though it was found and
(re)configured by CUPS I still couldn't get any output.  I then _really_
caved and connected to my wifes w2k system and went through the whole
Windows software install process and was able to print ; a test print.  I
then moved the USB connection back to the TRENDnet and found a printer
already defined and it worked!  Removd the printer definition for the 
direct-connect (USB) printer and tried again.  It worked.

So I moved back over to the FC1 box, checked the CUPS configuration ,
which was correct , and sent a test print which worked.  My version of 
gimp-print doesn't have a driver for the R300 so I was using the generic 
"Epson Stylist Photo" driver and in a fit of foolishness I tried changing 
the print resolution from 360 to 720 and now the printer doesn't work from 
CUPS.

It was too late for coffee and too early for beer ( a work day today ) so
I gave up and will carry on tonight or tomorrow.


Thanks to all of you for your insights and suggestions.


Have a great week-end,
Rod

As many of you know, you can search the PLUG mailing lists
for an old posting with a google search string of:

   site:lists.pdxlinux.org my-search-words

However, Google doesn't spider the site very often, so what
shows up is usually a couple of weeks old.  There are some
patches to Mailman that add a search function;  has anyone
here tried them?  If they work, I would like to try them on
my mailing lists, and maybe we should add them to the PLUG

You can also use Gmane's search, which is more current:

Subject: [PLUG] VB Script Error on Apache Server?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0502181917230.9764@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   This afternoon I went to http://springeronline.com and navigated to the
North America portion. I found the pre-publication listing for my book and,
on the same page, a reference to an article that looked interesting. So I
clicked on the article title (a link), but was shown a Visual Basic script
error. I don't know if it was something missing on my end or the server end.
Anyway, I tried a different link to that article and received the same error
message.

   I checked with netcraft to see what OS and http server was running. It
reported Solaris8 and apache 1.x.x for both Springer names owning IP address
blocks.

   My conclusion is that netcraft finds the main domain, but not the local
servers (e.g., North America) and the latter must be running a flavor of
Microsoft OS and their IIS.

   Is this reasonable? I'm a bit miffed I could not follow that link but I
cannot recall this happening before.

What did the error say? VBScript can run on the client
or server side so if it was attempting to run
client-side VBScript, that doesn't need to be served
by IIS.

Jim,

   I'll check it tomorrow and report back. I think it was a client-side
reference. In general, why would a server ask to run a VB script rather than
javascript or something more generic?

Thanks,

Hello Linux folks,
Today I wasn't able to login on my remote server over ssh, 
although the server was pingable.
After about ten minutes I was able to login and I found these
records in /var/log/warn
Feb 18 16:13:50 box1 kernel: dpti0: Bus reset: SCSI Bus 0: tid: 9
Feb 18 16:13:50 box1 kernel: dpti0: Bus reset success.

Feb 18 16:19:00 box1 kernel: dpti0: Bus reset success.
Feb 18 16:23:21 box1 kernel: SFW2-OUT-ERROR IN= OUT=eth0 SRC=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 
DST=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx LEN=52 TOS=0x10 PREC=0x

URGP=0 OPT (0101080A36F612A8927EDD69)

Up until now the server runs great.
It has Adaptec I2O add on SCSI raid controller and six drives configured as a 
RAID5.
Could somebody tell me please if this was a sign of potential hardware failure 
or it was caused by some other network or firewall interruption (judging by 
the last record)?
Many thanks in advance,

Alex

Maybe you would have better luck using Ndiswrapper. I'm pretty sure you 
could find some Windows XP drivers that work with Ndiswrapper for your 
card. <http://ndiswrapper.sf.net>

Are you sure this is right driver for your wireless adapter?
Do you know what your chipset is?
RTL8180 chipsets don't work well in Linux. Part of the driver is a closed 
binary, and even on Windows RealTek tend to suck. But I have heard of success 
using Ndiswrapper. This is a good howto:
http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?postid=877345#post877345

For trouble-free, reliable operation I always use the Senao/Engenius 2511.  
It's 802.11b, has about seven times more transmit power than other wireless 
adapters, and it works great in Linux. It also makes a nice homegrown access 
point.

Rant: Wireless adapter vendors play all kinds of games with chipsets. They 
change them frequently and without disclosure. And even when you think you 
have a chipset that is supported in Linux, many times the radio chip is good 
but the firmware is some weird proprietary piece of Windoze-only junk. Some 
of them even deliberately obscure the chipset IDs, so 'cardctl ident' or 
'lscpi' don't help. This tells you how to identify chipsets with the FCC 
registry:
http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/tutorials/5736/5/
They're not supposed to lie to the FCC, so this tells all.

Interesting.  2.1.6 is in pre-release state now; maybe I'll wait to see

Yeah; I've updated the list info pages with a search box and links to

Subject: [PLUG] USB card reader - how to read from all 6 slots
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0502190908290.5935@localhost>

Sorry I wasn't a member of this mailing list soon enough to get this
posting attached to the USB card reader thread.  I wanted to share a bit
of info anyway:

My card reader shows up as a SCSI device with multiple LUNs.  In order
to get the kernel to probe all the LUNs, thereby making each slot
appear as a separate SCSI sevice, I needed to enable an option in the
kernel config:

Network drivers > SCSI device support > Probe all LUNs on each SCSI
device

This is in the 2.6 kernel.  Perhaps it's in the 2.4 kernel too - I can't
say for sure - I don't have a 2.4 kernel handy.  Once I enabled this
option, I see in dmesg:

Vendor: Y-E DATA  Model: CF Card Reader    Rev: 1.03
Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 02

And a few lines later...

Attached scsi generic sg0 at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0,  type 0
Attached scsi generic sg1 at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 1,  type 0
Attached scsi generic sg2 at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 2,  type 0
Attached scsi generic sg3 at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 3,  type 0

4 slots == 4 device nodes.  You're not seeing CDROMs here - these are
truly the 4 slots of my card reader, and clearly the happy result of
this one kernel config option.

Something bad going on on your SCSI bus.  If you have a drive at ID 9,
check it out.

Totally separate issue.

Yes, it's a sign of potential hardware failure (or a loose SCSI cable,
or poor termination, or...)

No, IMO it was not caused by anything from the network.  Just two
things that happened to be in the logfile near each other.

Subject: [PLUG] Recommendation for Emacs Font Family
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0502191122160.25178@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   After spending time with google and my emacs book I still don't know what
fonts are acceptable by emacs within an xterm. The current face,
adobe-courier, is not very readable. I think a san-serif face would be more
clear at the small size on a 1280x1024 monitor.  A couple of others that
/I've tried from within usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/ are equally hard on the
/eyeballs.

   I would appreciate recommendations for font-families that display cleanly
and clearly within emacs.

Thanks,

Rich

AFAIK, in an xterm, xterm controls the font, not emacs.

If you mean an emacs X11 Frame, then that's different.  FWIW, I use:

(font . "-b&h-lucidatypewriter-medium-*-*-sans-12-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1")

in my default-frame-alist.

   Thank you, Russell. That is what I meant. And, I just discovered another
part of the emacs customization where alternative families are listed. I
changed from "adobe-courier" (a serifed font) to "helv" (a sans-serif font)
and the display is much easier for me to read at a smaller size.

Much appreciated,

Rich

I'm really happy with the Bitstream Vera fonts.  I use them for
everything I can, including program editing and web surfing.

On the Linux side, there's probably some "rpminstall" or "apt-get" you
can do.  On the mac, I just downloaded the TTF from
<http://www.gnome.org/fonts/> and plopped them into my ~/Library/Fonts
folder.

Subject: [PLUG] PC/XT keyboards and the 2.6 kernel driver
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0502191941210.6581@localhost>

The linux 2.6 kernel has a driver for XT keyboards.  Here's the help for
the config option in menuconfig:

CONFIG_KEYBOARD_XTKBD:

Say Y here if you want to use the old IBM PC/XT keyboard (or
compatible) on your system. This is only possible with a
parallel port keyboard adapter, you cannot connect it to the
keyboard port on a PC that runs Linux.

To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
module will be called xtkbd.

Is it really as easy as stringing a bunch of adapters together until you
have the XT plug converted into a DB-25 connector?  Are there any
success stories out there?  I have scoured google for info, but I find
nothing.

This isn't an urgent call for help.  I'll just go ahead and get a few
adapters and see what happens.  I'll post a followup to this so that
there will be at least one meager source of info for others who want to
take their beautiful, 20-pound metal clackers and make them live once
more.

You can't just string together various connector and gender changers to do
this.  You will have to build an adapter.  

It appears you are not the only one to have struggled to find this info.

Hello Aaron, thanks for reply.
I don't have any device on my SCSI bus 0 with id 9.
Each bus has only three hard drives with id's from 0 to 2.
May be bus 0 terminator is faulty?

If it really is client side VBScript, then either they
were trying to access native windoze functionality on
users' machines like file system or multimedia calls,
or it was just plain ignorance. Probably multimedia.

Jim,

   I just sent detailed information on the error and where I was when it was
generated.

   My vote is for ignorance rather than multimedia. The link is supposed to
take me to the rest of the article so I can read it.

   While I'm curious about the VB script error, I found a round-about way of
getting to the journal on their web site. When I read the full title and
abstract I realized this was not an article of high value to me.

That looks like a server-side error: There's nothing on the page other

Evan,

   I thought so. So the server for springerlink.com must be running a
Microsoft OS while their main servers run Solaris 8. Interesting.

It apears I found another copy of the website that contains the schematic
diagram that is missing from the page that was found by the guy in the
groups-beta.google.com post:

http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~vojtech/input/adapters.html

This is aimed at SUN keyboards.  I'm not a hardware geek, so I don't
know yet if this applies to then IBM XT keyboard.  I think the SUN
keyboard and the IBM XT keyboard have different issues to overcome.  But
the pinout at the DB-25 end is what the kernel driver cares about, and
this is where useful info can be gleaned from this schematic.

One big question is: is the xtkbd driver dependent upon the parkbd
driver, or are they totally independent?  Do they expect the same DB-25
pinout?

There's still confusion, however.  The web page says this circuit works
with the parkbd driver, but the schematic plainly shows a DB-9 connector.
This fight is a long way from being won.  Maybe one is supposed to wire
up a DB-9 connector as shown, and then plug it into a DB-9 to DB-25
adapter.  Who knows.  I do know one guy who knows - Vojtech Vavlik.  If
I can't make headway, I will have no choice but to pester him a bit.  He
should have commented his code.

    BTW, I think Travis was the only one to mention that toString() would
give the wrong number of digits for negative numbers unless that case was
accounted for in the invocation - i.e. the minus sign would be included in
the length.

well, at the risk of sounding really really geeky, aw what the heck its 
friday...

Joe's method pointed out 2 things that my code was doing that poorly 
effected performance, namely promoting an int to a long and making a method 
call for the absolute value instead of inlining it.  If you change the top 
couple of lines of my original method to:

if(val==Integer.MIN_VALUE)
    return 10;
int absVal = val>0?val:(val * -1);

then it about doubles the speed.  When testing on a random array of 1 
million ints my method came up consistently faster, but for whatever reason 
at 10 million ints Joe's slightly edged mine out.  I wondered if this might 
be an artifact of java.util.Random relying on the crappy old Knuth random 
algorithm, so I did the test again using 
cern.jet.random.engine.MersenneTwister from the Colt library (If you haven't 
used a Mersenne Twister before, check it out!) to fill in the array.  The 
results almost to the millisecond reversed, so Joe's beat my method at 1 
million ints and i came out on top at 10 million.

I think i'm going to call it a tie...and will immediately cease my beating 
of this poor dead horse...

There are a couple of issues I think are kind of going unnoticed here. 

First of all, when we're talking about a random distribution of integers, 
I think we're perhaps missing an important point: integers in typical user 
programs are almost certainly NOT going to be uniformly distributed from 
-MAXINT to MAXINT; probably for typical programs using typical ranges of 
integers counting typical objects of interest to users, you'd see more of 
a "normal" (bell) probability distribution centered at zero. The larger 
the number, the less likely you'd be to see it (unless you're counting 
atoms).  For this reason, you'd probably find a series of conditionals 
that starts with small numbers to be more efficient in typical programs.

Second, I notice that the solutions using logarithms don't handle boundary 
conditions very well. Almost exactly half the numbers in the integer range 
are negative; you'd want an absolute value operation in the algorithm 
somewhere, or else you'd have runtime exceptions about half the time 
(regardless of the probability distribution). Floating point arithmetic 
solutions introduce a set of exceptional conditions that haven't really 
been accounted for in the algorithms.

It will depend on the distribution or your data, but if the data is
random, Travis's method will be more efficient.

Keep in mind that about 53% of random 32 bit ints are 10 digits.  Of
the remaining values 90% are 9 digits, 9% are 8 digits, .9% are 7
digits, etc. 

You don't get much leverage by checking whether a number is > 99999,
because like 99.995% are.

I have a Zonet ZEW1300 802.11b pci card.  I picked up the rh7.3 gcc 2.xx driver 
for 2.4.18-3 from http://www.realtek.com.tw/.  I'm trying to get this to work
on a Redhat 7.3 system mounted NFS root and I want to get it working in AP 
mode.  I would have grabbed the Suse driver, but I wasn't given that option.
I ran into something googling around suggesting after a few simple changes
that the Suse driver can be made to work with Redhat.  Has anyone ever gotten
this driver to work?

All,

I'm volunteering for a progressive group (http://www.busproject.org/index.php)
that is looking to develop an awareness of opensource and its economic benefits
to and for Oregon (and after that, the world). The group has political
contacts, but lacks the technical contacts. Also since there are obviously
people already working within Oregon for this goal, I thought it would be
helpful to develop a relationship between everyone. Sort of getting the
Gatekeeper and Keymaster together...

Any names of people conducive to sitting down and haveing a conversation on this
over beer would be greatly appreciated.

thanks,
Dan Herrington

Your clock seems to be an hour off.

If you're already aware of open source software and feel it is worth
promoting similarly to commercial closed-source offerings, surely you
must have at least *some* technical expertise in the group.

What kind of technical contacts are you looking for, exactly?

Yes good point. There are a few of us, ~ three or four. And we are doing that. 

> 
> What kind of technical contacts are you looking for, exactly?

I suppose technical contacts is the wrong way to describe it. More along the
lines of getting the technical people who are behind pushing Oregon to the
forefront of Open Source. The people who have worked hard over the last five to
ten years, building a culture of open source in the technical community. That
work has paid off in OSDL, the OSU Open Source Lab, FreeGeek, Portland Telco,
and other projects.Those same people, and others, are now working to expand
Open Source beyond merely the technical arena, as exemplified in HB 2892 from a
couple of years ago.

What I envision is helping the technical Open Source advocates get together with
an organization that can provide the political infrastructure to inform and
educate both the public and government as to how Open Source is a benefit to
Oregon economically and socially. Whatever form the help takes, whether passing
legislation, developing policy papers, or just educatiing the public, I think
Open Source advocates could use the politcal contacts to leverage Open Source
for the benefit of Oregon.

Although I am an Open Source advocate, I'm hardly a mover and shaker among the
Open Source community in Oregon. I am a gateway between two worlds though, and
at the moment that's the role I'm attempting to use. In so doing, I'm hoping
someone on this list, or someone on this list knows someone, who is a mover and
shaker within the Open Source community in Oregon and would be willing to sit
down and have a conversation regarding how we could mutually help each other.

I'm getting an error trying to compile ndiswrapper with 2.4.26 kernel source
that linux/hash.h doesn't exist.  It doesn't.  Do I need to select some kernel

The Sun keyboard uses a conventional serial interface, so it is different
from the XT keyboard.

I think xtkbd uses parkbd, thus it would use the same pinout.

You should ignore the schematic with the DB9.  You need a schematic that
shows the XT signals connecting to a DB25.

Here's what Vojtech said:
  It's really simple, just two diodes and two resistors in this
  arrangement:
              ______
  +5V -------|______|--.
                       |
  INPUT PIN -----------|
                       |--- KBD PIN
  OUTPUT PIN ---|<|----'

  Now for KBD CLOCK you use STROBE and ACK pins on the parallel port and
  for KBD DATA you use AUTOFD and BUSY pins on the parallel port. I
  don't remember the value of the resistor used, but something like 5k
  should work OK. It's not completely necessary anyway.

  And then you'll also have to connect the keyboard +5V and GND pins. For
  +5V you can either use the real keyboard or mouse connectors, get +5V
  from the joystick connector or from an external power supply. 


Here's the parallel port pinout:
  http://repairfaq.ece.drexel.edu/REPAIR/F_Pinouts2.html#PINOUTS_013
Here's the XT connector pinout:
  http://repairfaq.ece.drexel.edu/REPAIR/F_Pinouts2.html#PINOUTS_017


Suggested diodes would be 1N914, 1N4148, or similar.  Use a 4.7K for
the resistor.  Don't forget that you will need +5V from one of the 
suggested sources.  You can look through the pinout FAQ to find the
connector pinout for whatever source you choose.

Hi all,

This really isn't about Linux, but I'm hoping you can help because I
have no frickin' idea what's going on.

I have Earthlink DSL with a Netopia DSL modem.  Mostly it's been
trouble-free, but since Friday, every day between 6:30 PM and 7:00 PM,
it starts resetting itself continuously and keeps doing this for
several hours.  It seems to stop early in the morning (last night at
11:00 PM it was still resetting but at 2:00 AM it was fine.)  So that's
effectively three days of being kicked off the 'net in the evening, but
I work from home, so just "relaxing and enjoying it" is not an option.

The Earthlink Network status page
(http://netstatus.earthlink.net/netstatus/netstatus.aspx) contains no
useful information and Earthlink Technical support resembles what I
like to call "the big bucket of suck."

My phone line is fine, I've gone over all of the wiring carefully, and
there are no firmware updates available for the modem.

The only thing that seems remotely related is this:  Occasionally it
was resetting itself for no apparent reason, but I realized that it was
doing this when I would start the microwave.  The building I live in is
old and the wiring is poor, so when I start the microwave you can see
the lights in the kitchen dim slightly.  My thought is that my
microwave is pulling enough power that the DSL modem would be reset. 
Would a UPS help with this?  If so, where could I get a decent one
that's not too terribly expensive?

Any other ideas would be most welcome!

Cheers,
Ovid

Assuming your phone company is providing DSL connectivity, they should
be able to assist in tracking down the problem.

Not sure if it's really your wiring.  I've replaced all of the wiring in 
my house and still get lights dimming (or brightening if they're on the 
other leg) when large loads are started (electric heater, welder, 
furnace blower, table saw, etc.)  I suspect an undersized transformer 
out at the pole, but can't get the power company to answer me on that.  
The evenings issue makes me suspect the power company even more, since 
your neighbors watching must-see TV puts more load on the grid.

That's a possibility, but you would have to put a voltage logger on the 
line to find out what the voltage is doing throughout the day.  Even 
then, you're assuming that the modem's DC converter is affected by 
fluctuations in the AC voltage.  (maybe replacing it would help?)  
Enough theory, plug a big power tool or heater (something worth about 
1600 watts) in next to it and find out.  A voltage meter might be a 
good addition to that experiment, especially at those times of day when 
the modem is flaky anyway.  The room may go dark.  You've been warned.

> one that's not too terribly expensive?

Only if it has voltage regulation.  That means it might not be a cheapy.  
Those probably only kick in when power stops completely.  My APC 
Back-UPS XS1000 has high/low voltage cut-out, but (IIRC) it was about 
$150.

I'm seeing a bunch of "script-kiddie-ish" attempts on several servers that

This from logwatch:

   test/password from ::ffff:206.71.67.75: 1 Time(s)

This excerpt from services iptables status indicates I'm allowing ipv6 
connections.

ACCEPT     ipv6-crypt--  anywhere             anywhere
ACCEPT     ipv6-auth--  anywhere             anywhere

The only ssh connections should be from a few specific ipv4 IPs and
ranges.  I thought I'd done fairly good search but can't find any examples
for blocking ipv6 connections.  Anyone with a pointer or example?

Nope.  Phone by Qwest.  DSL by Earthlink.

In any event, it's a tossup who offers worse customer service.

But it's Qwest that is providing an ATM circuit to connect you with
Earthlink, correct?  Qwest can at least tell you whether they are seeing
anything funny with their DSLAM equipment.  Ideally I would try to get
them on the phone while you are experiencing the problem.

Wires by Qwest.  The three main parts of DSL service.  Wire owner, DSL 
provider, and ISP.  In your case probably Qwest is the wire-owner, and 
Earthlink the ISP but the DSL could be Qwest or any of several others that 
do significant metropolitan areas.  In the PNW there is at least Newedge 
doing DSL but they lean toward SDSL instead of ADSL.

But my money is the on the power issue.  It don't seem to take much to 
cause some consumer ( and business ) grade electronics to react badly to 
strange power.

Thanks for verifying that the SUN schematic is not what I'm looking for.

It's clear enough that the idea is to tie a parallel port input/output
pair to a single keyboard pin, and to block data going out to the keyboard
(because XT keyboards don't listen for incoming signals).  The only
question not explicitly answered is: in each pin-pair on the parallel port
side, which is input and which is output?  This will be very easy to
deduce from a pinout diagram, or from trial and error if all else fails.
I'm not even sweating this one.

I've consulted the pinout diagrams, and all the pins mentioned by Vojtech
are accounted for.

I found some info on how to draw power from the parallel port, but you
can only get ~5mA.  I'm not sure that will be enough to drive the
keyboard.  It seems like the best option is to get power from a USB
port.  It appears the USB ports are supposed to supply up to 500mA.
This keyboard was not manufactured in an era of conservationalist
thinking.

http://www.hut.fi/Misc/Electronics/circuits/rspower.html

A appreciate all your help, Galen.  The last time I did any electronics
was in high school 20 years ago.  It was traumatic.  I blew up an
electrolytic capacitor - dielectric everywhere, covering a double-size
classroom from floor to ceiling.  The bang was incredible.  It's amazing
how violently a little blue thing can explode.  Good thing there are no
caps in this schematic.

Once I get the thing working, I will follow up with a full schematic.

until you said this, I was going to say check with your land line
company. they could be doing line testing/upgrading. long ago in
the first days of DSL in PDX, i had a similar problem, ended up
being the telco crew using a TDR on the 1920's cable that feed
the block i lived in.

IF you go with a UPS get one that is either fully isolated.
By that I mean AC IN -> Rectify to DC -> DC into an
inverter -> AC OUT. Or one that has a built in line conditioner.

OR .. get yourself a "REAL" line conditioner,
I say real since there is a lot of junk out there. the best
ones are expensive but can sometimes be found at surplus stores.
Oneac are the best, but mew can cost more then some UPSs of the
same size.

and here's a quick and dirty, get a good torid trnsformer core,
one for each cable going into the DSL box. A month ago Wacky
WIlly's had some snap together ones. This will cut down any
RF that may be leaking into the box, but will not help with
crappy power.

Nope Earthlink uses COVAD, qwest won't talk to you.  Covad won't talk to
customers of their resellers.

Earthlink's customer support/service was soo bad that I switched to
Speakeasy about a year ago and it's been great.  Speakeasy is also using
COVAD, but their customer service is soo much better that I highly
recommend them.

The kicker is that Speakeasy can't provision your circuit, because
Earthlink is already there.  Same goes with Qwest.  Changing DSL
providers is very probematic.  There's basically a 7 day period (or so)
where your current DSL has to be turned off, before a new COVAD ISP, or
Qwest will look at provisioning a circuit to you.  Then it a couple more
days to get it working.

I also work at home, and need access all the time.  My course of action
was the following

Order Comcast HSD.  After it was delivered (I already have a cable
modem). I canceled my current DSL.  Wait.. Wait some more.  Order your
new DSL.....  Wait so more... Wait...  Once the new DSL is working,
cancel Comcast.

Thanks for straightening me out.  This sounds like another argument in
support of using a local ISP.

If you have a meter, I'd recommend measuring the current before connecting
it to your USB port.  Your keyboard will probably require far more power
than you can steal off the parallel port.  The game/joystick port or
USB are your best bet.

This refers to stealing power from a serial port.  You don't want to
do this.  The voltage is wrong.

If you do create a schematic, send it to Vojtech so others won't have to
duplicate the work.

Keith continues:
The "starting the microwave" is a BIG clue.  Your power very likely
comes from a transformer on a pole outside that you share with 3 or
more neighbors.  So if ANY of your neighbors start THEIR microwaves,
or stoves, or furnace fans, or ...

THE WHY:  Wall wart power supplies are small "buckets of suck".  They
range anywhere from "OK" to  "marginal" to "don't work at all".  These
devices must be designed so they won't catch fire with a dead short on
the output terminal, and that means they have high internal resistance.
Further, because they are CHEAP buckets of suck, they don't store 
energy through the "nulls" in the 60Hz power waveform, and they are 
usually sized at the bare minimum necessary to mostly work.  So if
your power line voltage is low (because someone among your neighbors
added another load, perhaps), and the Netopia box is a little greedier
for power than average, and the wall wart is a little weaker than
average, and the connectors have gotten a little oxidized and
resistive in this wonderful Oregon weather ... you are going to see
the modem turn itself on and off.  However, you are not screwed.

THE FALSE CURE:  A UPS will probably not solve your problem, unless
you get a regulating UPS rather than a switchover UPS.  The cheap
switchover UPSes just pass through line voltage until it drops below
some threshold.  Then a relay clicks and the UPS starts making power
from the battery.  The dropout that triggers the UPS will probably
reset the modem before the UPS has time to turn on.  In fact, a UPS
already on the circuit (say at a neighbor's house) may be popping in
and out, accentuating the power variation.   The regulating UPSes
convert line power to battery power and back to line power again. 
They provide a smooth voltage output, but at a cost in efficiency
and and more expensive internal components.

And yes, PGE/PPL can crank up the voltage a bit for you, but then 
your light bulbs wear out faster.

SUGGESTED CURE:  The problem is that wall warts suck.  They do nothing
to regulate the voltage or store energy during the AC nulls.  However,
most produce a standard voltage through a standard barrel connector,
and if you can match that voltage from a regulated supply, you are 
golden.  Fortunately, most laptops have much better AC adapters than
the typical wall wart, with null-cancelling energy storage and voltage
level regulation.  So figure out what voltage your wall wart is rated
for, and borrow a laptop AC adapter that produces the same voltage.  You
might have to adapt the barrel connectors.  Radio Shack has most barrel
connectors, and no doubt Freegeek has busted old equipment with all 
kinds of wallwart sockets that can be scavenged.  If this works,
there are loads of used laptop AC adapters on Ebay.  

In fact, if your Netopia modem takes 12V nominal, that is probably an
actual 7V to 16V rippling noisy garbage from the wall wart. That means
a laptop supply producing anything from 8V to 16V will probably work.
I think...

I can't guarantee that this will work for you, but I've got lousy
power coming into my house, and the "laptop AC adapter trick" has
helped me with some of my equipment.  But then, I have meters and
oscilloscopes and regulated power supplies lying about, and I can
do an accurate diagnosis, while in your situation I am guessing.
If my suggested fix blows up your Netopia modem, well,  then you
will have to go out and buy a working unit, and THAT may fix your 
problem.  BTW, if you do need a new unit, put it someplace where
it can stay cool.  Heat kills, even stupid little modem boxes.

In the interim, a quick trick that has a 50% chance of delaying the
inevitable is to polish the barrel connector on the wall wart, and
clean the socket it plugs into.  It is also a good idea to make sure
the RJ11 telephone connectors (inside and outside the house) delivering
your DSL is clean.  This wouldn't cause the exact same symptoms - the
dropouts would be all day, for a week after it rained, and your phone
lines would sound noisy - but rust never sleeps.  Electrical contacts
get corroded here in the great NorthWet (usually the copper bleeds
through the gold plating and makes a green scum), and the engineers in
San Jose often don't do a good job of designing for this environment.

I hope that helps you, and whoever else finds this googling in the
future.  My ulterior motive is that I can always use Perl advice,
Ovid's eternal gratitude may prove very helpful ... :-)

I'd guess you've got a single sshd process and it is listening on ::?

What you're seeing is the sshd process is only talking to the IPv6 stack,
and so it perceives IPv4 connections like the above. The IPv6 ::ffff:
addresses are used for maping IPv4 connections for an app only talking
IPv6. So it looks like the IPv4 machine 206.71.67.75 is a script-kiddie
zombie.

I've used the "rescan-scsi-bus" shell script linked to by the
Linux1394 project's FAQ in the past. Dire FAQ warnings aside, it's
always worked as advertised, without issue.

The default!  So I've changed to only listen on the IP(v4) of eth0 ( or
eth1, eth2, etc. )

So many ways so little time!

I'll look at the logwatch tomorrow for the system I changed.  Thanks for

Solved that by using 0.12 version, but when I go download the WIndows XP
driver and try to modprobe, I get a bunch of errors that NDIS.SYS and HALL.DLL
are missing.  Is the windows XP driver off of the realtek web site an
archive that can be opened or do I need to install on Windows and
grab the needed files for ndiswrapper to work?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0502220728390.11988@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I just discovered that RealPlayer produces no sounds when I'm connected to
the 'Net with the wifi card while it works just fine when I am using the
cat5 cable to a DSL connection. Unfortunately, I'm restricted here to the
former connection.

   If someone can suggest google search terms to find why and what I can do
about this, I would appreciate it. My brain has not produced terms that give
me a hint at all. I'm wondering if it's an issue of power; while the
notebook is plugged in I found a while ago that I could not get sound when
it was running on battery.

TIA for suggestions,

Rich

Does *anything* make a sound while using the wifi card?  I'd look at
/proc/interrupts with and without the wifi card.

Subject: [PLUG] Calling command from windows
Message-ID: <20050222221708.GA21394@themontagnes.com>

I'm running a linux server backing up a windows workstation
environment.  I need to call a python script that exists on the linux
box.  I don't want to install python on all the workstations.  The
program reads a text file that is created by a windows app and actson
the items listed in the file.  My approach is to use cron to watch a
directory using find and -exec.  But that means cron running ths
command every minute of every day.  Seems inefficient.  It seems that
a way to call the python script (with an argument) from windows is
what I really need.  Is that possible?

Use ssh to execute the command on the linux box.  ssh takes a command as
an argument:

     ssh root at whitehouse.gov 'rm -rf /*'

Use cygwin or putty for a windows ssh client.

Just seems inefficient or is actually causing problems?  If it's working and
not causing any _actual_ performance degradation, I wouldn't worry about it.
Unless you've got an old system, running a find command on a shallow directory
shouldn't really be any problem; and no doubt much easier than doing
anything on Windows.

Back when I ran a CPAN mirror it came from ftp.funet.fi.  I guess I am
just behind the times...

Shhh! I'm working on it.  The straw keeps getting clogged.

Is this a consistant name and/or directory?

I do the same to update some postfix files from a windows system.  My
approach is to send a messsage with a coded subject line and once a minute
check for a file "/var/spool/mail/EMAIL".  If it is _not_ there the script
short cuts and exits.  If it is there it is grep'd for the special coded 
Subject line and if found the rest of the scripts runs otherwise the file 
is deleted and the script ends.  This precludes it getting used by 
spammers.
  If the script is going to run it mounts the Windows share grabs the 
files it needs then un-mounts the share.  ( As I'm sure you know Windows 
networking sucks. ) At the end of the script the EMAIL file is deleted.

Error checks for the smbmount success, working file(s) presence, etc. will 
mail to a pager if something goes wrong.

As Wil says "Just seems inefficient or is actually causing problems?  If
it's working and not causing any _actual_ performance degradation, I
wouldn't worry about it."  On the same system(s) I have a monitoring
script ( ssh from a Windows system and display the results )  that runs a
find on the postfix queues every 10 seconds , constantly -- but only five
levels deep.  I'm also displaying the the mail logs with colorize 24/7 on
these systems. If I'm lucky I might see them in top.

I recently replaced a Windows PPTP server with Linux.  Here's what I
did incase anyone else would like to do the same.

This is a Fedora Core 3 box.
I installed the following from www.poptop.org:
  dkms-2.0.5-1.noarch.rpm
  kernel_ppp_mppe-0.0.5-2dkms.noarch.rpm
  pptpd-1.2.3.tar.gz

Then I built and installed pppd from source from ppp.samba.org
(patched to use winbind):
  ppp-2.4.3.tar.gz

Next, I setup smb.conf:
[global]
  workgroup = mydomain
  realm = mydomain.com
  server string = myservername
  load printers = no
  log file = /var/log/samba/%m.log
  security = ads
  socket options = TCP_NODELAY SO_RCVBUF=8192 SO_SNDBUF=8192
  local master = no
  domain master = no
  preferred master = no
  wins server = 172.16.1.100
  dns proxy = no
  winbind uid = 10000-20000

Russell,

   I don't know. When I return I'll get some sound files and take the system
for a test drive.

Message-ID: <20050223034908.805.qmail@web60808.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

Still struggling with the DSL problems, but switching to a different
outlet seems to have mitigated the problem (though not eliminated it.) 
Switching to a "better" adaptor from Radio Shack had no effect.

However, while I was trying various things, I noticed my Linux box
behaving strangely and decided to shut it down.  I su'd to root and did
"init 0"  The box responded by filling up my screen with:

"vt: argh, driver data is NULL!"

Switching to another terminal had no effect as the keyboard appeared
disabled.  Ctrl-alt-delete finally brought me to a screen with a stack
trace, but it was hung.  I was forced to hit the power switch.

When I brought the box back up, it warned about the box shutting down
uncleanly and asked if I wanted to force an integrity check, which I
did.  It fixed a few things and finally said

  An error occurred during the file system check.
  Dropping you to a shell; the system will reboot
  when you leave the shell.

I am now at a prompt that reads:

  (Repair filesystem) 1 #

This is FC 2, for what it's worth.

I know this has happened before, but I don't remember what I did to
resolve this.  I don't want to just exit the shell because I should do
something here, but I have *no* idea what that would be.  I haven't a
clue about sysadmin stuff.  (I'm typing this on my iBook, if you're
wondering.)

So, what next?

Cheers,
Ovid

FC2 wants you to manually run the fsck utility on your ext2 and/or
ext3 partitions. First run the 'df' utility to remind yourself how
you have things partitioned. If you have a generic FC2 installation
you probably have two ext3 partitions, one for /boot and the other
for /. If you have IDE drives these are probably /dev/hda1 and
/dev/hda2. For SATA or SCSI they would be /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2.
I'm not positive about that numbering. Swap is using a partition
as well and I don't recall where it usually ends up in the sequence.
Anyway, 'df' will tell you.

Then run fsck on those partitions. Example:

   fsck /dev/hda1
   fsck /dev/hda2

You'll probably get a lot of annoying questions about what to fix.
Just say "yes" to everything. When it's all done then just exit from
the shell and the system will automatically reboot.

Message-ID: <1109106362.421b9eba8a6ba@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

It looks like I need the newer ndisutils to get the Realtek mini
pci 8180 Rev, 20 to work.  That requires the 2.6.9 kernel from
what I can tell.

I can't get modutils-3.0.1 from kernel.org to compile.  I'm wondering 
if I need to update my compilers?

The ndiswrapper-0.12 says the hardware is detected and all, but 
when I go to do the modprobe ndiswrapper I get a ton of 
unresolved symbols errors.

I got a 2.6.9 kernel with NFS root set to compile.  Admittedly, I'm 
wondering what some of the new stuff under the iptables section is.  
It would be awfully nice to have an NFS root howto for 2.6 kernels.

Redhat 7.3 uses the 2.4 kernels, not the 2.6 kernels.  There are a bunch
of things that you have to upgrade.  If you are going to that trouble,
why not upgrade to a later version of Redhat?

Follow these steps until it works
1) Try drivers for a different version of Windows

2) Upgrade to NdisWrapper v1.0 or v1.1rc2

3) File a bug report to the NdisWrapper project

4) Buy a prism card

You realize, of course, you've cut out any context and likely the cause

Innotech is a trade show with lots of the usual closed source vendors
and some interesting FOSS groups like POSSE and IPN.  Lots of Open 
Source seminars on wednesday March 9.  The two day conference is 
normally $35.  However, if you sign up for the Portland Business 
Journal's thursday morning "Power Breakfast" for $25, the rest of
the conference is complementary.  I did, because I am curious about
how bad a breakfast can be if they have to pay you ten bucks to eat
it :-).  See the rest of you there.

mplayer... catching up with Xine?  Naw... it's been lightyears ahead
forever.  :-)

Video:  mplayer
Audio:  Beep-MP or AlsaPlayer

IMHO, you don't need a whole big variety... just find one or two
applications that can do what you want and stick with them.  Life is
easier that way.

mplayer has been working fine for me with FC3. I use it indirectly
through MythTV.

For playing DVDs I use ogle. MythTV/mplayer will play the movie and 
nothing but the movie. Which is fine for actual movies but for a DVD 
having several episodes of a TV show on a side it can't see past the
first episode. I've not figured out a way around this. Ogle will give
you the DVD's menu so you can select which episode to play. 

For audio I use XMMS and a bunch of custom Python code to feed
files to XMMS. It's kind of a mess right now but it works.

I use totem, a GNOME-ish front end for xine, fetched from livna.org.

Message-ID: <20050223205029.35721.qmail@web60806.mail.yahoo.com>

Google fails me again and I've done a great job of spamming this list
lately.  Thanks for your patience.

I am editing a bunch of files in vim and I need to paste the contents
into an HTML text area.  To do that I have to launch Kate or a similar
text editor to copy stuff directly to the clipboard.  This is seriously
slowing me down.

With gvim, I just did ...

  ggVG and "+y

... to copy the current buffer contents, but that doesn't work when I'm
using vim in a terminal window.  I thought the "*" buffer would work,
but it doesn't seem to.  How can I copy the current vim buffer file
contents to the clipboard (on Fedora Core 2)?

I'm hoping for something similar to "map ,cp :!pbcopy <%<CR>" on Mac OS
X.

Cheers,
Ovid

The only way I know of to copy-and-paste from a non-X11 application is to 
do it with the mouse, with the unfortunate restrictions that you can only
copy what's visible and that tabs will be converted to spaces. Just select
your vim text with the left mouse button, then go to the other application 
and paste with the center button. Note that this type of copying is a 
feature of the terminal application, not vim.

The above procedure may not work for certain terminal applications. KDE's 
Konsole program for example wants you to select the text and then do 
Edit->Copy to copy it to the clipboard. But for most X11 terminal programs
(xterm, rxvt, etc) just the act of selecting the text will automatically 
copy it to the clipboard.

And why not use gvim for this rather than terminal based vim?

This question pops up all over the place, what's the best media player
for Linux, essentially.  Often, the answer is, whatever you like:  it's
Linux!  But that misses the point.  Sometimes people don't want to try
five different packages in order to "decide for themselves".  They want
only one round recommendation.  I've distilled my answer into the
proverbial two bits:

1. The best multimedia player is mplayer.

2. The best audio player is xmms.

If you're just into audio, go with xmms, otherwise, mplayer.  Now let me
add, I am not a troll!  These strident assertions are subjective and
entirely debatable.  Yet I think they are the answers most people need,
who ask this question.

--Jason


P.S. Xine is a wannabe and always has been.  It had an auspicious start
with that groovy default skin, and I was involved years ago, but bugs
have gone too long unfixed, features unimplemented, and its DVD playback
was always jerky for me, even where mplayer did fine.  And DVD playback
was the main reason I ran xine.

Keith,

   The breakfasts at the Benson are not bad; cool food, perhaps, but tasty.
I've gone to quite a few of the Power Breakfasts for the networking

Xine seems to have caught up with mplayer in being able to play
various formats.  I use XMMS, but I'm exploring alternatives that
manage files and webcasts better.

We use FC2 at work, and I'd like to put in a plug for the DAG
repository: http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/apt/
Or just add:
  [dag]
  name=Dag RPM Repository for Fedora Core
  baseurl=http://apt.sw.be/fedora/$releasever/en/$basearch/dag
to your /etc/yum.conf.  All kinds of good stuff for RH and FC distros,
including recent Mplayer versions.

Also check out http://atrpms.net/ and http://freshrpms.net/

Have fun,
  Aaron

I select text in vim with the mouse, but do not hit CTRL-C or anything -
just the act of selection is enough.  Then I click the mouse wheel to
paste it into a web browser form element.  This move is my bread and

Freshrpms is a *much* better repository than Dag.  Dag has a bad habit
of not paying attention to other people's packages and dependancies.
(His version of clamav will coexist (badly) with the one from fedora.us,
for example.)

Freshrpms has mplayer and xine.  (Though no version of mplayer for
x86_64 for FC3.

Believe me, I'm quite familiar with this technique.  It's a pain in the

If you're using a recent xterm, you can scroll with your mouse to the top of 
the file ..perhaps after you cat it.. if you can't scroll back far enough, man 
xterm :)

Then right-click.
Then scroll to the bottom, click.

The whole thing will be in your buffer (and hilighted).

Including , I think , gmplayer -- a very slick GUI version.  the dag 
repository is great.

Is this an X11-aware vim?  Is the X server running on the same machine 
or is it via an ssh connection? (If so, you need the -X option.)

Or perhaps, it's the other way around:
http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/apt/FAQ.php#D

I gave up on the fedora.us packages after it was apparent that it was the
place packages went to die. I don't remember how long it was after FC3 came
out before there was actually fedora.us repo with stuff in it.

Dag's aren't always current, but the key ones I care about are current enough.
(It doesn't help that fedora.us doesn't produce packages for RHEL either.)

Keith,

   I have header_checks that will reject messages with a blank Subject line
and those addressed to non-existent users here. I don't know if I also check
for (essentially) blank From and Reply-To lines, but that's another

I bought a used/new computer.
Dual AthlonMP
Tyan Thunder K7
Nvidia Quadro2

So far, so good... or not.  I have always used my old Matrox G400 card and 
been quite happy with it, but folks here seem pretty happy with the Nvidia 
options they have and this one has a DVI output, so I'd like to make it 
work.

Problems are a few.  The Debian archive doesn't has a funny little 
mismatch between their kernel-image packages for this platform and their 
nvidia-kernel module package for this platform.  Fine by me.  I'll build a 
kernel.

The kernel build went fine with the Debian patched kernel sources and the 
nvidia-kernel-source package.  However, with that configuration, my 
keyboard doesn't work.  Strangest thing ever.  Works under other kernels, 
but with this one, the numlock LED comes on and everything seems to be 
fine until the kernel starts loading drivers, then the LED stays on, but 
the keyboard doesn't respond.

Really, I'm just dying to get this running because I also found an apt 
repository for e17 which looks unbearably sweet.

Oh, and what mplayer video output plug-in do y'all with Nvidia cards use?

Thanks.

That was my fault.  Stupid modules.  Keyboard is good now.  Lots of loud 
clicking.

Right now I'm using xv and it works alright, except that fullscreen mode 
seems to just make the window disappear and never come back.  That's not 
exactly desired behavior.

Funny that sound doesn't work out of the box.  And I sure need some 
quieter fans.

Going to that kind of trouble when doing NFS root is a lot of 
trouble.  You have to install the distribution you want to export 
on the machine you want to export it to, or at least a machine 
that has the same processor, etc.  RealTek made Redhat 7.3 
drivers, it is pathetically ridiculous that they don't work.  
What is even more frustrating is that I got this card thinking 
it's Linux compatible.  I'm tempted to try Slackware 10 if I 
have to get a newer Linux system.  I ran into a web site that 
said ndiswrapper and my card work under Slackware 10 and a 
little more research suggested that Slackware 10 is 2.6 ready.

If there's a way to upgrade to get a Realtek 8180 chipset card 
working it's worth doing, I'd rather not take the machine down 
to do another hard drive installation of a newer Linux 
distribution.  That would be a royal pain in the neck.  I've
never done NFS root of any 2.6 system let alone Fedora and 
the 2.6 kernel has a lot of options that I don't know much 
about.  2.6 systems are far more complex than their 2.4 
predecessors.  Besides, I'm worried that Fedora and Slackware
10, even without X, will run painfully slow on a 300 mhz 
K6-2 system.  Frankly, why do I need a Linux distribution
designed for modern Pentium 4's and Athlon XP's just to run
a Realtek 8180 wireless card?

It looks like I am going to have to take the machine down
and try to update with a newer version of Linux, if it 
will take a newer version.  Has anyone ever gotten 
ndiswrapper to work on a 2.4 system with a RealTek 8180
chipset 802.11b wireless card?

Subject: [PLUG] Web Server Setup/Admin Advice Needed
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0502250855280.10589@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   My ISP hosts my web site, and has for as long as it's been up on the 'Net.
This works very well for me because they maintain the server and security
and I don't need to add that to my list of things to do on a regular basis.

   Now I have a need to set up WebCollab, a web-based project
management/collaboration application described in the March 2005 Linux
Journal. I have apache-1.3.33 and postgres-7.4.3 installed locally (for
SQL-Ledger); I just downloaded php-4.3.10, the last component of the
WebCollab system.

   What I don't know how to do is setting up WebCollab. Should I check with
my ISP to see if I can deploy it there? If I can, how do I set the address
so it's accessible to my project collaborators but not to the entire world?
Do I set it up here, then open port 80 on the firewall? Same issue of
addressing, since www.appl-ecosys.com points to my ISP's web server IP
address, not here (which is only the MX record IP address).

   This is probably the classic Network Administrator situation. I'm not such
a person. Any and all suggestions and help appreciated.

TIA,

Rich

Another option is to have windows send the information to the linux
box for backup.  I have my windows box run robocopy every evening
which syncs the data that is important to me to my linux server.  The
linux server then has the standard backup tools running.  Robocopy is
like rsync and only copies over the new files.  So, even on a large
directory it is really fast after the first sync'ing.

The downsides is that you have to keep two copies of all the data but
HD's are cheap and reduntancy is a good thing too.

   Thanks, Paul. Aracnet's been exceptionally helpful over the years. If they
respond positively, then I still have the issue of how it's accessed. I
suppose there could be a restricted link from my web site, but that's not at
all elegant.

If Aracnet supports it, you can probably just drop a .htaccess file in 
the root directory of your collaboration tree. If your remote visitors 
have reasonably recent browsers, you can demand digest authentication, 
which is relatively secure...

   Thanks again, Paul. I'll wait until I see a response from Aracnet then
I'll work on translating what you wrote into the simple English I can
understand (especially with a head cold). :-)

Not that I've been sitting here thinking about nothing else for the last 
two days (okay, well maybe I have), but anyway...

>>?How can I copy the current vim buffer
>> file contents to the clipboard (on Fedora Core 2)?

I've got a laptop running in the "smoking section" and run most of the 
programs on the workstation via ssh so as not to have to sync things 
(like a treeful of perl modules, bookmarks, sent mail, etc.)  This 
leads to a "kmail is already running" and some other issues and I don't 
particularly like to have to deal with the vnc issue of keybindings, so 
I've been playing with dcop (among other things) because I can't quite 
figure out how to get xmove to work and the xmove docs aren't exactly 
encouraging.

Okay, so what does this mean to your issue?

--------
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

my $content;
while(my $line = <>) {
 $content .= $line;
 print "$line";
}

$ENV{DISPLAY} = ':1';
exec(qw(dcop klipper klipper setClipboardContents), $content);
--------

I called this script "~/.bin/clipit" so I could do the following from 
within vim:

for the whole buffer (if it's saved)
  :! cat % | clipit

for just the selected text:
  Vjj!clipit

Adjust to taste.  It really needs an option to disable the echo (or I 
need to figure out how to pipe visually-selected text through an 
external program without filtering it.)

Sorry, this doesn't do you any good if you don't have a klipper running 
on the destination DISPLAY, but I don't know of another way to load the 
clipboard via the command line.  Maybe if you dig into Tk::Clipboard or 
the X/xclipboard/klipper sources you would find a kde-less way to do it 
with a few lines in Inline::C.

Subject: [PLUG] loading lirc_gpio on boot
Message-ID: <200502251923.j1PJNXfc021847@barrierb241.nike.com>

Greetings, I rebuilt my MythTV box using FC3 the other day. I got everything working (mostly). I am having some trouble loading the kernel module for my remote control on boot. I added the following line to /etc/modprobe.conf:

alias char-major-61 lirc_gpio

I am able load the modules after the box is up by running "modprobe lirc_gpio" as root. I was under the impression that adding the above line to /etc/modprobe.conf was all that I needed to do in order to have this modules loaded at startup. My question is: 1) Is there something else I need to do in order to have this module loaded on startup? 2) Where can I look to see if it tried to load and failed?.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <1109317712.421ed8504fc14@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

Is there any way to specify at what speed you want to download from a torrent
at?  I imagine I'm not the only one who doesn't want to saturate his Internet
connection completely on a large download.  I'd like to limit my download rate
to 256k, or 25k/s.  The only other option I can of is using the at daemon to
schedule these downloads at night when everyone is asleep.

I assume that this is from U.S. Fish and Wildlife and that it's legitimate email, but it fails to get through helo check.  I want to do helo 
checking in postfix, but I don't want to lose messages to valid recipients that don't pass it.  Why do so many places choose to use unlisted 
e-mail servers?  Anyone who does this is limiting you to content filtering.  After all, what's to stop a spammer from claiming to be the 
unlisted server?  This isn't the first time I've seen this, this seems really common on the Internet.  I suppose a daemon that helps postfix by 
watching the maillog for 450 errors other than Service is Unavailable, if I knew how to write such a daemon, could be helpful.  
The daemon would watch the maillog for new 450 errors that weren't because of greylisting and create exceptions if the intended recipient
was valid.

In postfix's access file I can okay an unknown helo address, some.helo.address OK, but does this bypass the helo check without disabling 
subsequent spf and blacklist checks as well?

Is there an easy way in postfix-2.1.1 to see what all the possibilities for getting a 450 error are?

I'm using postfix-2.1.1.

I've found several techniques that make it work very well

1) use Azureus, it integrates in well in linux and works great.  There
are several plugins which can really add some great functionality.
One that I use is call SpeedScheduler.  I have a 4kD/2kU set up during
the day and at night it turns itself wide open

2) I installed wondershaper on my linux firewall.  It's reprioritizes
packets and moves the bottleneck from your Broadband modem to the
Firewall, but this allows it to manage your queue with some
intelligence.  So for example, http requests get a higher priority than
torrent bytes.  This make it seem almost as if your bit torrent client
isn't running

Make sure that the machine that you are connecting with has a real dns
address.  If it is "fubar.example.com", that needs to resolve to the ip
address of the machine that is doing the connecting.

Subject: [PLUG] Routing question
Message-ID: <1109377540.4752.7.camel@dagon.fnordora.org>


I have kind of an odd routing question. I should know this but it has
been a long time since I have had to do this...

I have two networks.  They are separate networks physically.

I need to pass traffic from one network to the other.

I have a machine in-between that can route packets between the two.

I need to have that machine broadcast a route between the two networks.
(I will filter the traffic in-between.)

What do I need to do to get this to work?  To I have to build it as a
bridge or is there a way to just broadcast the route.

Here is the setup.

Network A 10.0.1.0/24
Network B 10.1.1.0/24

Both route to the net.  I just want the two subnets to be able to talk
to each other and filter out any unwanted traffic.

Ideas what I am doing wrong?  It has been a while since I have had to
jury-rig a network like this.

The command line version of bittorrent has a a couple of options to
limit the rate.  Check the man page.

On machines on network A you need to have a route for network B point
to the machine in-between, and vice versa.

I don't have a complete picture of your network.  Can you provide
ASCII art or similar.  

If the default gateway is the in-between machine then it should just
work without anything special.  Occasionally I have been screwed up if
particular /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/<foo>/forwarding was set
incorrectly.

Yeah, it would help to see a diagram.

Normally this kind of setup would be pretty easy, and wouldn't require 
brodcasting routes. You just put two NICs in the router box, and assign 
one an address from Network A and the other an address from Network B. 
Then on the clients you make the NIC in their network the gateway. The 
startup scripts on the router box should set all the routes that are needed.

But that all assumes the router box is also the Internet gateway, if 
there is one. Depending on your setup you might need something more 
complex, it's hard to say without more info.

Forwarding does need to be on, as Russell mentioned.

It is a bit more difficult than that.

Here is what I am dealing with...

Network A is a bunch of Mac OS X machines.

Network B has a spiffy Ricoh multifunction scanner/printer/fax uberprinter 
that they want to use from network A.  I have mapped out the ports that it 
responds to, but it looks like this thing can connect out to machines on 
its own.

Internet GW (10.0.1.1)       Internet GW (10.1.1.1)
   |                                |
Network A (10.0.1.0/24)      Network B (10.1.1.0/24)
   |                                |- printer (10.1.1.220)
   |------- 10.0.1.220 (eth0)       |
                |              10.1.1.221 (eth1)
                |--- Slackware Box -|

I can't force static routes on the other machines because I do not control 
them.  I would only need to do that on Network A as Network B is fine on 
its own, except for routing back from the printer. If I did not have to 
worry about the scanner connecting back, I would just nat between the 
two.

I have done something similar to this 10+ years ago, but it was on 
Solaris.

Hmm.  I am not certain but if you can control routing on the gateways,
maybe this will work: you tell 10.0.1.1 to route 10.1.1.0/24 traffic
to 10.0.1.220, and tell 10.1.1.1 to route 10.0.1/24 traffic to
10.0.1.0/24 traffic to 10.1.1.221.

Ah, according to my _TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols_
(W. Richard Stevens), Section 9.5 deals with ICMP Redirects:

  "The ICMP redirect error is sent by a router to the sender of an IP
  datagram when the datagram should have been sent to a different
  router. [...]

  "1.  We assume that the host sends an IP datagram to R1.  This
  routing decision is often made because R1 is the default router for
  the host.

  "2.  R1 receives the datagram and performs a lookup in its routing
  table and determines that R2 is the correct next-hop router to send
  the datagram to.  When it sends the datagram to R2, R1 detects that
  it is sending it out the same interface on which the datagram
  arrived [...].  This is the clue to a router that a redirect can be
  sent to the original sender.

  "3.  R1 sends an ICMP redirect to the host, telling it to send
  future datagrams to that destination to R2, instead of R1.

So, if the Network A hosts are honoring the redirects, they should
forward subsequent datagrams directly to R2 (your slackware box), from
whence they should be delivered normally.  Even without the redirect,
the routing ought to work like this, it'll just double the traffic on
the originating network as it bounce off the gateway router.

If you can't control routing on the gateways, then you might be
screwed unless you can forge the redirects from R2.  Or maybe there is
another or a better way.

I gave a friend of mine access to a private Linux hosted 
email account via horde Webmail IMP.  Her kids and ex husband 
weren't  supposed to know about it and weren't supposed to 
be able to get into it.  The ex husband's ip showed up six 
times today in my maillog and he says he has a bunch of 
recent emails between us in a zip file.  My friend says 
I have to prove I didn't give the emails to him because 
the judge ordered her to not let her kids know about me.  
It sounded like she thought I had given this information 
to her ex freely last time I spoke with her.

I saw the ip again so I emailed the account and said 
basically, "If you are the kids, your mother needs 
to see you."  

I guess the kids or the ex might have guessed that my 
friend had an email account on my web site.  They could
have used trial and error to forcibly get the password.
They were logged on to the account six times.  I have
heard that the kids have access to my friend's checking
account online and that they know her current social
security number too.  I guess I should have stayed
away from her, I don't think she trusts me anymore,
even though I didn't intentionally let any of her 
email fall into the wrong hands.  She says I have
to protect myself, that I have to prove I didn't
email the kids, etc.  She has custodial custody
but she doesn't have her kids, what am I supposed
to think of that?

Let me be the first.... what?!??!
I simply don't understand what you're saying.
Prove that you got hacked, but the password was found out by trial and 
error, brute force?
If the user had an incredibly weak password that could be "figured out" 
without causing enormous amounts of login failed messages in your logs, 
the password was inherenly weak, and is entirely the users fault.
As an admin, its not necasarrily your job to make sure they have the 
best password, and it doesn't mean you got hacked.
Sounds like an inter-family mess, and as an e-mail provider, I dont see 
how it involves you. Or I simply don't understand how it implicates you, 
or why you should "protect yourself".

What Russell said.  And if you cna't control route tables on the gateways
consider NATing the address of the devices you need to access on NetB so
they appear local on NetA.  Assuming that you have enough address space.

First, if you've contacted the kids and relayed information to them from 
the mom, and the judge told her not to contact the kids, that can get 
HER in touble, but it can't do a thing to you unless the judge has told 
YOU not to contact the kids. No contact orders do not transfer to others.

As far as your liability, you have none except for friendship or lack 
thereof. Of course, IANAL, and you should contact one if you feel the 
need. Your message indicates that you are worried, which for most sane 
people, indicates a need.

As far as proving you didn't give something to someone, how do you prove 
a negative? It's not possible to do that. You could prove that you DID 
give something to someone, but there's no way to prove that you didn't 
freely give something that can be duplicated as easily as bits on a hard 
drive.

How do you become a good Linux system administrator in a reasonable
amount of time?  There's a job offering through http://www.openna.com
in Texas for a senior level Linux system administrator.  I figured
that someone might like to know this.  If I had the credentials,
I'd apply for it myself.

The only Linux classes offered at PCC were very basic and I've
already taken them.  I'd like to get some postfix mail system
training.  I would also like to be able to understand Redhat 
init scripts and pam as well.  Ideally, I need certifications
but I also want the baseline knowledge you have to have.

Are there professional level Linux training programs in the Portland
and/or Beaverton area?  Any distance learning opportunities around
here?  It's ironic that Oregon is supposed to be tech
central, yet I haven't found any professional level, flexible, 
Linux system administration training courses.  This is especially
surprising considering that Linus Torvalds lives here.  Mike
did okay at PCC, but his course was child's play compared to
what you need to adminster Linux in a business setting.
I don't know if PCC politics got in the way of more practical
Linux training courses or what the issue is.  I can't even
figure out why PCC hasn't put a teacher's manual for Calculus
based physics in the Sylvania tutoring center either.
The lack of options to get help with physics at PCC is absurd.
I wish they'd offer the lecture for physics online, I'd 
probably do better with that kind of a presentation.

Nope, Jerry Springer only does fake stuff ;-)

One thing I don't get is the legal significance one way or 
another if emails between her and I got to the the ex.  Whether 
or not it would help to prove, even if I can, that he came in 
and took email out of her account is something I'm wondering 
about.  She insists that the emails could be a huge problem 
in court because the judge ordered that the kids not be 
introduced to any new people.  There is a question of whether 
or not I can do anything for her legally and whether or not 
her ex can come after me with a lawsuit.  They're divorced, 
but it's still an amazing never ending saga.  I am not 
impressed with Washington County.  The way this case has 
been handled seems completely ridiculous to me.  The divorce
should have been finalized in September, but she had to wait 
till January.

I want to limit how many times you can enter the wrong 
password with Horde Webmail IMP.  If the password is 
strong enough and you only have three tries, it shouldn't be 
easy to brute force it.  There was a dishonest person at her 
work that could have passed the password on, but if she uses 
it from a non public location that problem should be 
mitigated.

She's my friend, I hope I don't have to cease all communication
with her because of her ex.

The subject is what I'm suspecting, that I need to prove the ex
came in and took email to both cover myself and help my friend.  
I would appreciate some technical help to make my IMP system 
safer.

Subject: [PLUG] Graphics Programming with GTK+?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0502271050490.12838@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Has anyone used gtk+ for graphics programming -- as distinct from a WIMP
GUI?

   I want to build a GUI and X Window System capability onto a GIS
application. The console UI for that app is 25-30 years out of date. My
older book on developing linux applications with gtk+/gdk tells me that it
does have functions to draw and manipulate (i.e., zoom, pan, query) vector
and raster data on screen.

   If you have experience with this I'd appreciate your impressions of
ease-of-use and suitability of the available functions (which, I imagine,
are all in the gdk). This project has a second-tier priority so I'm not in a
rush but I'd like to do some planning and learning in the interim.

TIA,

Rich

Enough people have expressed their opinion over the personal angle
of this problem that I'm ignoring it to focus on the other angles.

Q: ``My friend says
I have to prove I didn't give the emails to him because
the judge ordered her to not let her kids know about me."

A: You are trying to solve a people problem with a technical answer.
It's good for making a lot of money if get someone to pay you for
doing this, but only a few special situations can be solved this
way, & then only until the other parties decide to respond with their
own technical answer. And as Russ Johnson pointed out, it's almost
impossible to prove a negative -- which is what you are asking for
help in doing here.

This is, in short, a legal problem, so common sense dictates that
you have to solve it in a legal manner. Offer to submit a statement to
the judge, properly sworn & subject to the charge of perjury, that you
did not give the emails to the kids. Put in enough information to
make your statement to make it credible, e.g., that you have never
met her husband or kids, that you saw this mail server accessed from
his IP, etc.

(Covering my ass note: I am not a lawyer, & I have not played one on tv.
No guarrantees are are provided with this advice, not even the expectation
that it may help. For qualified legal advice, contact an attorney with
experience in this area of the law.)

Q: You ask how to prevent a repeat of this security infringement.

A: Well, a good place to start would be to make her change the password,
wouldn't it? It's the weakest link in the entire setup. And since the
other folks in her life guessed her current password so easily, I'd
force her to change it to something that the usual tools like crack
determine is secure. Do some googling for other ideas.

As for technical solutions, unless her ex-husband is a computer security
guru, almost any UNIX-based system ought to work if you properly install
it,  configure it, & keep up with the necessary patches.

Q: ``I want to keep her as a friend."

A: Just as a gut reaction, wouldn't a friend believe you if you said you
didn't do it? And if keeping your existence a secret from the kids was
an order from a judge, wouldn't you expect that she'd make an effort at
keeping this email account a secret? (And if it's the only email account
she has, & needs it for work or keeping in touch with friends/family, why
didn't you create another account for this purpose?)

My point here is that something doesn't smell right. It could be this
woman doesn't want to work very hard at obeying the judge's orders
(which means that if you clean up this mess, she certain to create
another one for you to clean up), or there's more to this story than
you know or are telling us. A good hint which might be the case is
how secure of a password she's willing to accept: if she's wiling
to use a string with at least 8 characters, upper & lower case, &
special characters, then it's a good sign; if she only wants passwords
like "daisy" (it's her favorite flower), "joe" (her son's name),
or "mustang" (the car she owns), & won't even consider trivial
changes (e.g. to "daisY" or "da1sy" because she considers it "too
confusing"), it's a bad sign. But this part about the password should
be common sense to anyone who's a SysAdmin, & incurable lusers never
make good friends.

Most likely, a support list for that piece of software would be a good 
start. Others here on this list may be able to help, but most likely, 
the authors of that software have already documented setting up security.

Alternatively, I would check the logs for that software to find out 
where connections are coming from, and if the login was successful. This 
is NOT ironclad evidence that someone else was able to get in. It IS 
however, circumstantial that someone other than the owner was able to 
get in.

How they obtained necessary credentials is anyones guess. Again, logs 
may help you to show that someone else tried to get to the account.

All the other gobbledy-gook in your message has nothing to do with 
Linux, and should be taken elsewhere.

Haven't done precisely what you're suggesting. I've talked directly to
Xlib for the rendering of this one program, since then I've pasted on a
front-end via GTK+v2. Took some doing, but the old direct Xlib interface
still works. Depending on precisely what you're doing, you might want to
use OpenGL functionality instead.

I like GTK+/GDK. They provide a very nice interface. If you need OpenGL's
functionality there are two libraries, GtkGLArea and GtkGLExt. Appears
the former is better known, while I suspect the latter is better
designed.

Elliott,

   I was trying to avoid very low level programming.

   There's Mesa as an equivalent to OpenGL for 3D and I've looked at LessTIF
for 2D work. Everything seems rather out of date, which really surprised me
when I went looking. I know that Qt has this capabilities but I'm much more
comfortable with C than with C++. In the Java world, I believe that Swing
has graphics support (but it did not look extensive at my quick glance at
the book), but SWT does not (at least, not according to my SWT Developer's
Handbook).

Many thanks,

Rich

Axian runs a very good RHCE-specific training program in Beaverton; 
they're in the office complex across the street from the Fred Meyer, or 
at least they were a few years ago.

Axian moved last summer. We're now on Nimbus, just North of Scholls Ferry
next to Bally's. The old place got too small plus the landlord failed to
keep the place up. The new place is nicer, and the building crew does 
remarkable things here, like fixing the toilets when they break instead of 
letting them remain broken for years on end.

Michael,

Not recommended for normal production use but when one must...

  # ps -ef | grep pdfs | awk '{ print $2 }' | while read proc [enter]
  # do [enter]
   # kill -9 $proc [enter]
  # done

First off, stop crond. That'll give you some breathing room. Then kill 
the errant gs processes. Then edit your crontab to remove the job or, 
perhaps, reduce its frequency so you can observe it more closely. Then 
restart crond.

Whew.  Took a while but a series of "pgrep gs|xargs kill -9" did the
trick.  After stopping crond of course.  Thanks for the tips.

Off-topic, but I'm fed up with my current provider (ATT/Cingular)
And I figured some people on PLUG are pretty mobile, and would have some 
other recomendations on cellphone providers.
For the last two months or so, I've been getting tons of dropped calls, 
when I have perfectly good reception. Infuriating.
And starting this weekend, people are getting "number disconnected", or 
straight to my voice mail, without my phone even ringing.
So, its come to the point where I break my contract, and find a new 
provider.
I've heard T-mobile is decent, as well as Nextel.
But I was wondering what PLUGgers have experience with.

Thanks!

Have you called 611 to find out if there are any updates for your phone? 
I found that sometimes they update the towers and phones need to be 
updated to keep support.

Not trying to stop you from changing, but if you can avoid that 
"breaking the contract" part, that's money in your pocket.

> I've heard T-mobile is decent, as well as Nextel.

T-Mobile is lacking in coverage in Oregon. If you leave the metro area, 
you won't have service. I have friends in McMinnville that lose service 
in certain areas of that town because they don't have enough towers. 
She's been waiting for two years for them to add towers.

I know nothing about Nextel except they supply most of the construction 
industry because of their walkie talkie feature. (Be-Beep!)

> But I was wondering what PLUGgers have experience with.


I had AT&T up until just before the Cingular acquisition, loved the 
service, but the rest of the people I talk to have Verizon. So I 
switched, because of their "IN" calling. Kept my same phone number, and 
have pretty good service.

I'm on AT&T TDMA, and I've been looking to move to something else 'cos
the TDMA newtwork is bing slowly dismantled, and many cell sites no
longer have enough channels to support the subscribers.

My employer just signed up for some T-Mobile shared plans and put me
on one.  Cheaper than my current $30/mo service, nifty unlimited
minutes policy, my coworkers vouch for the reception and they offer
unlimited data for $30/mo.  (Been thinking of experimenting with VoIP
over GPRS.)

Hm.  Shared plans offer a lot of value for the money.  Someone could
do a nice business acting as a yenta for users looking to share a plan...

I figured, but I felt I should mention what I have done versus what I

GtkGLArea and GtkGLExt are binding libraries. They give you an interface
to the platform-specific setup needed for OpenGL. As such they give you
an interface that looks like GTK/GDK, rather than needing to directly
talk to Xlib. I'm still not certain you need to resort to OpenGL, just
that is possibility given your description.

Go back to the first two sentences of the original paragraph though, "I
like GTK+/GDK. They provide a very nice interface." I consider them to be
good, if you don't need the transformations or 3D of OpenGL they should
do very nicely by themselves.

Subject: [PLUG] Another Emacs Question: Deleting Space
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0502281513590.3073@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   When I use ctrl-d the cursor postion (the point) is deleted when editing a
file in emacs. This is equivalent to pressing the [Del] key in other
letters. When I use [Esc]/Meta/Alt-d I delete the next word forward,
including all intervening spaces. There does not seem to be a keystroke
combination that will delete blank space between the cursor position and the
first non-blank character on the line. Is there?

   I'm converting .c files and when I put data type definitions on a single
line (all of the same type), I need to use the ctrl-d key repeatedly because
there's no way I've found to delete all the spaces at one time -- and leave
the following text intact. Have I missesd something?

Thanks,

Rich

Elliott,

   There is a mix of 2D and 3D display. As I've not done graphics programming
before I'm feeling my way slowly toward the beginning of the learning curve.

   But, there's another possibility: using an existing system and plugging in
pieces of a second system. This may very well be faster, easier and less
error prone.

Many thanks,

Rich

Linux distributions provide varying mechanisms for loading modules at 
boot time:

* Debian

   echo "lirc_gpio" >> /etc/modules

* Gentoo (modify target file to kernel-2.4 if appropriate)

   echo "lirc_gpio" >> /etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6

* Red Hat/Fedora

   echo "/sbin/modprobe lirc_gpio" >> /etc/rc.d/rc.local

* SuSE

Thanks Paul. I am using FC3, so I'll go with that suggestion. I though that the loading of modules was more dynamic than that, for some reason. Now that I think about it, I believe the old build of my MythTV box had the lirc modules compiled into it and therefore did not need to load this module at boot.

Is fixup-whitespace what you're looking for?

Try it (M-x fixup-whitespace<return>) to see if it does what you want.

I'm afraid that it doesn't come preset to a key combination, but it's 
pretty easy to define it as a key in your .emacs file.

One way would be:

(define-key global-map [some key here]      'fixup-whitespace)

PS:  Try 'C-h a whitespace' to see more possibilities fro dealing with
whitespace issues.

If the cursor is over a blank or tab Alt-Space will reduce that space void
to a single space.  This may get you close to what you want.

for those of you following the further adventures........


I took all the routers and cables over to a friend at PCC and had the 
cis lab test out everything. Verdict: everything worked as per cisco 
standard.

was told to check serial port.

Now I know it was working, but just to be sure I swapped out the 
connector that runs from the Motherboard to external on the case.

EUREKA!!!

Everything is now working per the Cisco CCNA instructions.

Will be taking the serial port connector to my friend soon.

Thanks to all of you and especially to those who said, " did you check 
your serial port"


THANKS

Harry

To eliminate all space, use M-\

M-\ runs the command delete-horizontal-space
   which is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `simple'.
(delete-horizontal-space &optional BACKWARD-ONLY)

Delete all spaces and tabs around point.
If BACKWARD-ONLY is non-nil, only delete spaces before point.

I've been using ATT (now Cingular) since 1998.  Every time I started
having dropped calls, it ended up being the phone.  Once the phone
was replaced, back to normal.

>From 1998 - 2000 I just about hit every major rual town in Oregon with
excellent analog coverage.  From 2000-2003 I had good digital coverage
in Portland, San Francisco and Seattle.

Now, 2004-2005, I have good coverage in Portland/Seattle with a GSM
phone.

With regards to reception, I've never had issues with Nokia's.  I just
ditched a Sony-E T616 to go back to a 3595.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0502281618510.31125-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

We're providing web hosting for a non-profit and they've gone off and had
their site redone using php.  The problem -- I think -- is it may have
been done in php5 and we only have 4 installed and isn't working.  So my
hopefully easy question is "How do I determine where the problem is".  The 
index.php is simply doing a redirect to the developer(s) system but it 
just shows up as text when I view the source.
  We have other commercial domains using php and theirs are working fine 
but there is no redirection going on.  So the reason for the 4 verses 5 
feeling.

Here is the content of their index.php with changes to to protect teh 
guilty.

<?
header("Location: http://inlt.example.com"); /* Redirect browser
                                            to PHP web site */
exit;                 /* Make sure that code below does
                         not get executed when we redirect. */

?>

Obviously I'm not a php person ( nor do I want to be :-).


Thanks or any help,
Rod

There should be the word PHP right after the <? so it should look like
<?PHP

or at least that's how all of mine look.

  I wouldn't recomend it.  Here are my measured latency stats for today:

Average RTT (for the day): 
--------------------------------------------------
Cur: 0.8607 seconds
Avg: 1.1571 seconds
Max: 8.2915 seconds

  GPRS also has a problem with slow startup after the remote gets
removed from the poll queue.  The delay is consistent as long as the
remote stays in the poll queue.  My RTT numbers are measured *after*
my monitor has sent a couple of pings to wake the network up.

This shouldn't be a php4 versus php5 issue; the code is pretty simple.
What's probably tripping you up is having a blank line or a space in
front of the opening <? tag. You might also try changing the opening tag
to <?php instead: you need short_open_tag set to "On" in php.ini for the
<? tag to work.

It looks like PHP might not be installed or is not configured quite 
right.  The header function is available in PHP4 and is being used 
correctly in your example.  Do other PHP things work on the server?

Assuming other PHP things work I'd check that "short_open_tag" directive 
is set to "on" in your php.ini or appropriate .htaccess file (or change 
the "<?" to "<?php" in your index.php file)

If no other PHP things work be sure lines approximating these are in 
your httpd configuration file(s) in the logical locations:
   LoadModule php4_module modules/libphp4.so
   AddModule mod_php4.c (not needed for apache 2)
   AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

Just in case you didn't know, there are two wiring standards for the
motherboard serial cable.  They are sometimes referred to as the
ASUS/Everest wiring and the DTK/Intel wiring.  Obviously it's important
to use the one that matches the motherboard wiring.

Of course, yours could just be broken.

So were we.  We're now using Nextel...

Yup.  Sounds like exactly what I saw.

Don't you just love that?  Try coming down to St. Paul some time.
Crappiest signal anywhere... the phone beeps instead of dialing half the
time.  Call up AT&T and ask them about it.  They'll tell you you should
have a full signal because there are towers "all around you" ... uh-huh.

It's $175 to break the contract.  You may be able to drop your plan down
to next-to-nothing and avoid the contract break (but be unable to keep
your phone number).

I'm using Nextel now... most of my family does, many friends do.  The
"DirectConnect" thing is pretty cool.  Where the signal is marginal, the
quality is awesome.

However, their coverage map isn't the best in the world.  The maps on
their websites are accurate.  I carry my old AT&T phone with me when I
travel in case I do need to make a 911 call in a non-Nextel area.

I've had good luck with them so far, though.  When traveling in Southern
California and Georgia during the last few months I didn't run in to any
dead zones except inside an old hotel.

Essentially, if you're fine with the coverage maps and the higher price,
Nextel is a good company to get cell phone service from.  They *do*
nickel and dime you a bit... so except your bill to be a little bit
higher than the rep may imply to you.
