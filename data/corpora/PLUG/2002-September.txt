Subject: [PLUG] cdrecord howto
Message-ID: <E17lPOV-000138-00@sire.mail.pas.earthlink.net>

I am not sure how to proceed here, and I only have 10 CDR disks to play with, 
so any help appreciated.  I am learning to burn cd's from distro cd's and 
have done all of the RTFM I could find, including man and howto's at 
linuxdocs.  What I could not find was a howto that actually describes how you 
copy and burn a cd from an existing distro cd.  

I did cp -r /mnt/cdrom redhat7.3-1.iso from the first disk, and that copied 
it to a directory called redhat7.3-1.iso, but note I have NOT run mkisofs on 
that directory.  Should I? or is it already an iso as copied?  Also, since it 
is a bootable cdrom, do I need to add that option to cdrecord, or can I skip 
that, since the file system already has an autorun file on it?

I have backed up data to cd's, and burned disks from iso's, but this is the 
first time I have tried to copy from distro cd's, and I am not sure how that 
is different.  I haven't enough coaster material to experiment, so any help 
would be appreciated.

Message-ID: <1030866911.3198.11.camel@linux>

I just installed RedHat 7.3 on a new machine and have run into a issue
I've never seen before.  I am unable to activate my ethernet card (Intel
EtherExpress Pro 100B).  I can get it activated by statically give it an
ip, but am unable to ping anything outside of the local loopback.

When the ethernet card is set to use DHCP, I get the following error
when restarting the network.

Bringing up interface eth0: Determining IP information for eth0...
failed.

When the IP is set statically and I ping my gateway (a linksys router),
I get the following error:

Ping 192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1) from 192.168.1.106 : 56(84) bytes of
data.
from 192.168.1.106 icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable

I've spent several hours on this and am at a loss.  Anyone have any
ideas?

Can we see the output of `ifconfig eth0` and `route -n` ?

Don't mount the CD.  Just dump the image off the disk
$ dd if=/dev/cdrom of=/path/to/disk_image bs=2048

Then you can burn the image with cdrecord:
$ cdrecord -v speed=8 dev=0,0,0 -data /path/to/disk_image

Of course, the speed and the device ID may vary.

Autorun files are for Windows.  The boot block should be part of the disk
image, no?

I didn't think I was mounting the cd with cp -r, I thought it just copied the 
files in the same manner you indicate with dd.  But, as I think about it, I 
guess the fs has to be mounted to use cp.  Redhat 7.2 does automount when the 
cd is inserted, so I guess I have to umount it to use dd.  cp -r did seem to 
dump all the files into the directory.  Is there a difference in what I would 
get from cp as compared to dd?  wouldn't the block size copied from a distro 
cd already be correct (2048)? [just wondering if it is necessary to tell dd 
what bs, or if it would just copy as is without that specification]

Hmmm more of that conflicting advise stuff.  I was told I did not need to use 
the -data, and the man page seemed to confirm that when I read that it was 
the default if no other flag.  But you and the howto's always seem to include 
the -data.  I guess I should also, just to be sure.

>

Yep, dev=1,0,0  , and the speed is another question.  I see posts 
recommending using a lower speed than the burner's max.  Is that just for 
audio or would it be recommended for data as well.  I was making about 20% 
coasters at Free Geek the other day, doing iso's at the max 4x, burning 
knoppix.

boot.cat (unknown file type, per nautilus) is there, perhaps that is it.

I think I will have to get some more cdr disks tomorrow so I can experiment a 
little more.  I have a removable drive downstairs I can try installing on, to 
verify they work.

>
> J.

The Free Geek Store wants to make disks available, so I need to spend some 
time burning copies here in my spare time.  The burner they have is slow 
(about 25min per disk), and I can't hang around to baby sit it.  Anyone want 
to donate something faster than the 4x they have down there? [donations are 
tax deductible]

First of all, if you just want to copy CDs, you can get xcdroast from
http://www.xcdroast.org/, click "Copy CD" and let it do the work for you.

No, but you need to mount the CD before cp will work. Otherwise you were
not copying the CD. BTW, you should have used cp -a, not cp -r, if you wanted
to create full copy of the CD file by file (it's not used for copying CDs,
it's for creating the directory structure and all files from CD on hard disk).

Not really necessary, it'll work without bs too.

You can leave off -data.

> Yep, dev=1,0,0  , and the speed is another question.  I see posts
I always burn at 12x and never made a bad CD. At such speeds you need to
either fully dedicate your machine to burning (don't do anything else
while cdrecord runs, don't touch it at all, and make sure you don't have
any powersave modes kicking in), or you need a CD-writer with burnproof,
then just add -burnproof to cdrecord options, Then you can suspend cdrecord
with Ctrl-Z and it'll continue just fine when you resume.

Neither of these has anything to do with being bootable. Autorun is not
about booting from it, it's what runs when you stick the CD into already
running windows. There are cd-watching daemons for Linux (Gnome and KDE run
them by default), they could execute something on CD if there was a
convention how to name it, but there isn't so they don't. What you need
to boot is a boot sector with bootloader in it, and then the kernel in the
location expected by the loader. Since you will just copy CDs sector by sector
with dd, you don't have to worry about this.

Dirk,

  Could be. We've no USB ports on the workstations so I know nothing about
them. Try 'lsmod' to see what modules are installed.

Well, I have not been able to procure a space.  However, I think things
are headed off on a different course for me.

As of tommorrow, it will have been a year since my last regular paying
job.  A year is enough.  

So, I have decided to pursue other things.  Perhaps, I might get lucky
and get a programming gig every once in awhile, but I need to pay bills
and maybe even start saving again.

I will be happy to help where I can to get the training co-op off the
ground, but at this time it is not something I can afford to put my
energy into.  Believe me, this is very sad for me.  I will miss
programming.  But nonetheless, I wish all of you the best of luck in
getting the co-op together.

Ok, that's almost identical to my network setup, except I'm not running
as high as 106.  Your route output was identical to mine.

Now... what about ifconfig eth0?

Well, do you have a DHCP server?  Does the linksys router provide DHCP
for you?  You need a DHCP server to have dynamic IPs...

I don't see much reason in running DHCP on a small network.  Although, I
should talk, I just spent the last two days trying to get AMaViS
working... I'm the only one that uses the mail server and not only am I
schooled about viruses, but I am running Linux and Linux alone.  :-)

I did win the battle with AMaViS, BTW.  On to Samba/CUPS next....

The computer I'm on now is set dynamically being served an IP from my
router.  That's what gets me.  When I do a ifconfig by itself and my nic
is set dynamically, the eth0 does not appear.  When I specify the eth0
device, I get

eth0	Link encap:Ethernet HWaddrr 00:A0:C9:FB:C5:8E

	Interrupt: 11 Base address:0x1000

No IP information, obviously, since the device is deactivated when set
dynamically.

Ok, let's try this:

# /sbin/ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.106 broadcast 192.168.1.255 \
	netmask 255.255.255.0

Then, instead of attempting to ping your router, try pinging another
system on the network.

Then try this:

# /sbin/route add default gw 192.168.1.1 metric 1

And try pinging things again.

Do you know for sure your network card works and the network cable is
good?  That is, did it work in Windows or something?

You weren't mounting the CD with the cp command, the CD was mounted
beforehand.  I knew because the location on the filesystem
(/mnt/cdrom) that you were using as the cp source is where some systems
mount cdroms.  It is NOT the raw device from which you could dump data
blocks whole.

> Is there a difference in what I would get from cp as compared to dd?  

As Fedor wrote, cp will copy the files off the disk, but dd will copy the
sectors in raw mode.  The disk image produced by dd will be identical to
the disk image burned to the CD in the first place.  You don't have to
then construct your own image and include a boot block and all that; it's
already done.

> wouldn't the block size copied from a distro cd already be correct
> (2048)?

It'll work fine without specifying block size as there is a default value
for this.  However, I tend to specify things rather than relying on
defaults.  Defaults can change over time and different systems might use
different wrapper scripts or aliases that modify default command-line
options.  By specifying the parameters yourself, you minimize the risk of
sending commands to the system that you did not intend.

Again, you're relying on defaults that might not be the same on every
system or in every revision of a given piece of software.  You should
really get in the habit of specifying things.  That's just personal
advice, of course.

20% is kind of insane.  Were you doing other disk intensive things on your
system? (that could include using swap space)

On my system, I burn at my drive's maximum speed, but I have to watch the
buffer capacity and make sure it doesn't ever underrun.  I can still use
my system (dual processor, dual disk, dual IDE controller, no swap) for
almost anything, but if I try, say, indexing a large AVI file that resides
on the same disk as the disk image being burned, I can underrun the buffer
and halt the CD burn prematurely.

There is no file on the filesystem that represents bootability.  The boot
block is part of the disk image headers.  This boot block is included when
the ISO image is made.  When you are simply dumping an existing disk image
with dd, you get that boot block.  If you copy the files and then create
an ISO by hand, you must manually include the boot block.

Does that make sense?

Gosh, surely we could fill a SCSI enclosure with CD-R drives and do some
mass replicating, no?

I don't have any spare drives (or money) right now, but I could probably
cough up an enclosure, if pressed.

It did work on Windows. In fact it was running Windows until last night,
no problems with it.  It might be hardware compatibility issue, even
though RedHat says that its compatible.

The ifconfig and route commands did not work.

Ok, you're using RedHat... what version?  What kind of network card do
you have?  ISA or PCI?  :-)

> The ifconfig and route commands did not work.

"did not work" is of virtually no help.  What didn't work about them? 
When you ran the commands, did you get some output or was it silent? 
Maybe the commands worked without any errors but pings aren't working?

Details!  We need details!  :-)

What was the output of `ifconfig eth0` when you set up the device with a
static IP?  And `route -n`?

You chastise this fellow for providing too little information, but then
you fail to read the entire thread yourself.  Effort is a two-way street.

It's Red Hat 7.3 and an Intel EtherExpress Pro 100B card.

I get no message after running the commands (nothing indicating there's
an error).  I'm installing RedHat 7.3 using an onboard Intel
EtherExpress Pro 100b.

Ifconfig shows the same data as before adding the IP, subnet and
broadcast that I specified.  Still not able to ping anything.

I'm thinking it's a compatibility issue with my NIC and will look into
getting another one.  Thanks for all the help.

If setting the IP statically isn't working, there is no surprise that
dynamic doesn't work either.  You need network connectivity to get a
dynamically configured IP.  

Robbert, how does the device show up in the boot messages?  You can
probably find them in the dmesg output.  Is it possible there is more
than one ethernet device on the system and you are plugged into the
"wrong" one?  Recheck your cabling.

The fact that you got the eth0 information is good. It means the board is up
and ready to receive an IP. The next issue is to make sure you DHCP client is
looking for a lease. 

I don't have a Redhat system or I would post the output of ps ax. dhcpcd,
dhclient, pump or something else, might be your client. Maybe some RedHat user
could post what the default DHCP client is and the output of ps ax. You will
need to make sure you have it on your system and that it is started.

Thank you
Russell

On what are you basing that conclusion?

You're able to configure the device, which means that the module is
loading properly.  That's usually a pretty good sign that it's not a
compatibility problem (not 100%, but it's a good start).

You haven't mentioned anything about the link lights, the far end
equipment, or the cable.  All of those things could be a factor.

Sure, "it worked in Windows", but when was the last time?  And what has
changed since?  Did you move the machine?

You haven't really given a complete report on the configuration including
what tools and command lines you're using to change the settings.

I think it's rash to claim some kind of compatibility problem.

This isn't Windows.  The software is flexible enough to allow for all
kinds of configurations that won't work in your environment.  Blaming
hardware or "compatibility issues" is almost always a cop out, usually one
foisted on us by the software vendors who have a vested interest in making
you believe that the software is totally usable and bug-free and that your
hardware is the problem.

I truly believe that if you walk through this problem systematically,
you'll get the system working with no changes to the hardware inside the
box.

The last time it worked was the about 5 minutes before I began
installing RedHat.  So physical connections are not an issue.  (Yes, the
link lights are on).  I'm not much of a command line guy, so I generally
use the tools on Gnome (network configuration, which has worked all the
other times I've installed linux on the other machines that I've
installed it on).

You chastise this fellow for providing too little information, but then
you fail to read the entire thread yourself.  Effort is a two-way
street.

It worked in Windows until last night.

They're still an issue, but it's less likely they were changed much and a
simple look-see should take care of that part (and a quick check of your
memory to see if any furniture was moved or anything).

> (Yes, the link lights are on).

Which link lights?  And what about activity lights?  Do your activity
lights blink when you try to send packets to the gateway?

What equipment is on the far end of the cable coming from your on-board
network interface?  Does that have a link light?  Activity light?  How is
that device configured?  Is it a pass-through bridge or does it route or
filter?

Can you show us what the kernel thinks about your network configuration in
each of the two modes (static and dynamic)?  ifconfig and route (and
saying "looks the same except..." isn't really good enough.  To the
thousand eyes, all bugs are transparent)?

By the way, sendmail will not prevent a machine from booting.  It might
hang for a long time trying to resolve itself, but eventually the system
will come up.

I downloaded kernel-source-2.4.18.tar.bz2, figured out what bz2 was, and
tried to unzip it in /usr. Looks like my partitioning scheme needs
adjusting. I ran out of room in about 10 seconds. I can unzip it in
another partition (/home has lots of room), but I assume that for things
to be predictable, I should make more room in /usr, unzip it there. 

Now, what was that utility for editing partitions Rich needed last
weekend -- parted?

In my /usr/src directory, I have only an rpm directory. Do I need to
create the linux directory myself, or is something I haven't done from
the unzipping and untaring process going to do that for me?

The sendmail error came because I tried installing another driver last
night that I did badly :).  I reinstalled windows on this other machine
and bang I've got a connection to the internet.  So it's not physical
connections.  I will try again another time when I have more time.

Thanks for your help,

But if you've gotten to the point where sendmail begins, you've booted the
system.  It didn't fail to boot.

But reinstalling isn't the issue.  You just have to configure it
correctly.

Actually, it wouldn't go beyond the time out errors while trying to
start sendmail.

Many programs look for kernel headers in /usr/src/linux, so when you compile
things it is always a good idea to have the source tree for your
_current_ kernel in /usr/src/linux.

What I do is this (once the kernel is downladed)

1) su to root,
2) cd /usr/src
3) if there exists a linux directory, move it.
4) tar Ixvf /path_to_downloaded_kernel/linux-...tar.bz2
5) move the extracted kernel to linux-<version> ie:
   mv linux linux-2.4.18
6) make a symlink to the new directory from linux, that is:
	ln -s linux-2.4.18 linux
	you can now act as if the kernel saurce is in "linux" rather than
	"linux-2.4.18". This is invaluable when you upgrade kernels, as a ls -l
	will tell you which version is being used.

7) cd into the linux directory, and run "make menuconfig" or "make xconfig",
   they are two interfaces to the same thing, try them both and use what you
	like.


You can place the source anywhere you want, just make the symlink in step 6
in /usr/src/ and you should not have any problems due to that.

If you copy /boot/config to /usr/src/linux/.config after step 6 above, it
will be loaded automatically.

Do you actually know of something that looks in /usr/src/linux and not
/usr/include/linux where the headers belong?

You should always always always make sure that the versions of the kernel
headers you are using are the same ones that were used to build your
version of libc... even if that is not the same as the kernel version
you're running.

So, build your kernel, build glibc against it, then COPY the kernel
headers from /usr/src/linux/include/linux to /usr/include/linux and from
/usr/src/linux/include/asm/ to /usr/include/asm/

Thanks.

I've only read about it in INSTALL files & how-tos, since I haven't been in
a situation that was contrary to that, I can't say if it really does
generate problems.

lsmod only shows modules currently loaded in the kernel.  The kernel does
its best to load and unload dynamic modules as needed.

Check /lib/modules/<kernel-rev>/modules.dep or your kernels .config to see
what you've actually got.

You can try to manually insmod the appropriate modules and see what
happens as well.

IIRC, if you compile something into the kernel, it won't appear on lsmod,
you just use it.

If you need to pass params to something that is compiled into the kernel you
can do so with any other kernel params. 

poking arround in /proc may shed some light on the issue, or there is a
howto here: http://www.linux-usb.org/USB-guide/book1.html

I'd be happy if I could figure out how to get kmail to copy a composed message to my Sent box on my IMAP server. I would even settle for automatically putting my email address in the BCC field. Any ideas?

TIA,

Perhaps you could create a filter that is applied to "sent" messages to

Message-ID: <20020902131425.9445.qmail@web13807.mail.yahoo.com>

Greetings all,

I have recently installed debian on my system, and I
have a few problems. I belive I can handle most of
them, but I can't figure out one of them, due to the
fact that the docs are a total labrynth.

I have a DSL connection using DHCP. I have pretty much
figured out how to set it up, except that I need to
run pump to get the thing started. I've been running
it manually until now, but I need it to run when I
boot my computer. Which script would I edit, and where
in the script would be the best place to put it?

TIA,
Vincent Damewood

Vincent,

I am only one dimensional in that I run exclusively Redhat distributions.
In Redhat there is a command chkconfig:
chkconfig --list
will give you all the startup states.
chkconfig --level 345 pump on  
turns pump on for boot levels 3, 4 , and 5.  See /etc/inittab for explanation 
of boot levels.

Another dhcp client is dhcpcd.  There is another explanation at:
www.scroung.org/dhcpcd.html.

HTH, Good Luck

Thanks, Tony. I created a filter that said to foreword a copy of every 
outgoing email to myself. (Really dumb!) The next thing I know, kmail is 
hung and I've lost communications with my mail server. After killing 
kmail, I also got the kill the 100+ messages in my inbox. ;-) Kmail does 
have the ability to drop email into folders, but only local ones. Perhaps 
in a later version.

Regards,
Paul

KMail doesn't seem to do a super job of supporting IMAP yet.  I know I
crashed it many times when I was using imap...

What I did was highlight about 50 emails and tell it to delete them. 
*poof*.

Unfortunately, KMail had about the best PGP/GPG support, and that is why
I used it as long as I did.  Now I'm using Evolution for the time being,
but if I sign anything with it it does the PGP/MIME thing and makes it
hard for most people to read it.

*sigh*

It's hard to come up with a good mail client!

This is a VERY good tip.  The last thing you want to do is go thru config 
trying to guess what some of those very obscure, to me, things mean.

Is this /boot/config a Debian thing or also a Redhat thing?

FWIW, I had trouble with a making iso images, until one day I was sitting 
around cursing the guy that had stable instead of woody for a 'woody' network 
install and I noticed that my spindle of cdr's says 12x on the lable. I 
switched to that speed and have never had trouble again.

I just logged in to drizzle to see if I could figure out the init
sequence, and, I think, it is a little different than most.

I can't find an rc.local, which is what at least a few distros use that
would be perfect in a situation like this... but oh well, we can work
around it.

If nobody comes up with a tool you can easily use for this, I would make
a script in /etc/init.d running the command you need to run.  Then
symlink it to your runlevel scripts, which are /etc/rcY.d where Y is
your runlevel.

I like BSD-style init script, myself!  :-)

I'm pretty sure most distros have it.

Slackware does, it provides a good starting point when you need to
rebuild your kernel.

IMHO, if you can, you should rebuild your kernel for your machine as
soon as you are able.  Not only is it a learning experience if you're
somewhat new to Linux, but it will speed up your system and can increase
system stability.

In the identity settings under the tab panel marked "Advanced", there is 
is a option to allow you to set the "Sent-mail Folder". I have it set 
to a folder called "sent-mail". Have you tried that with IMAP? It does 
work with SMTP as I have several years worth of messages in my 
"sent-mail" folder.

I may not understand what you are asking, but I will try.  Under debian,
you define your network interfaces in "/etc/network/interfaces".  To get
debian to use dhcp to get the address you use a line like

"iface eth0 inet dhcp"

check "man interfaces"

I setup my own Sys V init script that runs "dhcpcd" for me for my cable 
modem service. If "dhcpcd" is successful and gets an IP address from 
AT&T it then runs my firewall script so my system is protected. Since 
my DHCP client system is used as a network gateway/firewall I also have 
the script enabling IP forwarding and spoof protection.

I don't care for the BSD-style as it's a bit simplistic with all of the 
local customizations in a single file. The Sys V init setup is more 
flexible as it's just a matter of setting a few symbolic links to the 
init script in the proper runlevel directory.

I haven't seen a BSD-style init setup in Linux since I used Slackware. I 
do have one OpenBSD system that I'm working on but so far my local init 
setup is quite simple.

Do you have the camera dock? I don't use RedHat but I've found at least 
on my system that my camera is automatically detected when I press the 
button on the camera dock. I'm using SuSE 8.0 and it has a "hotplug" 
service that automatically detects my camera when I enable it. If 
you're not using the dock, then make sure your camera is turned on when 
you plug it in. The other problem I've seen is that by default only 
root can access the camera through the hotplug service. To work around 
that a usermap needs to be setup for the camera that allows a non-root 
user to access the camera.

You might try posting to the "gphoto" general mailing list. I've gotten 
some good information there that helped me get my "hotplug" service 
setup so I didn't have to be root to access my camera. Information 
regarding the various "gphoto2" mailing lists can be found here:

http://www.gphoto.net/lists.html

Here's the user manual for gphoto2 that may also be of help. The one on 
sourceforge.net is out of date compared to the manual that can be found 
at this link:

I think BSD vs SysV style inits are just a matter of personal opinion. 
You like SysV because you can just go in and change a symlink... I like
BSD because I can just go in and comment out a line.

I always feel like I get a better grasp of what is happening with the
BSD inits, I can *read* the sequence from start to finish.  :-)

But, it isn't for everybody.  I guess if you had a ton of things
starting up with the system (Slackware keeps it somewhat minimal) SysV
might be better from an administrative point of view.  Drizzle has a
billion things starting up, I saw.  I always keep my system running as
few things on startup as possible... and what it does start up, odds are
I compiled it from source with as many optimizations as I could safely
get it to compile with.  :-)

I haven't been following this thread to closely, and I use gphoto2 rather
than gphoto, but the only way I could get it to work with my Kodak DC3400
is as follows:

1- usbcore and usb-ohci must be loaded (I think that usb-ohci is
   specific to the USB controller hardware on your system, for some people
   usb-uhci or another similar module may be required instead).

2- usbdevfs must be mounted

3- the usb module for my camera must NOT be loaded (gphoto2 talks directly
   to the camera, if the module is loaded, it can't get access). Everytime
   I plug my camera in, the module is automatically loaded, so I have to
   manually unload it before I can access the camera.

4- I have to run gphoto2 as root

Perhaps this will give you some ideas for things to try.

SuSE has quite a few services that are started when the system boots and 
it's alot easier having a Sys V init IMHO. I agree it's more 
complicated since you have to decide what runlevel you want a service 
to run at but it does bring some order into would otherwise be a big 
mess. 

When a system is simple I don't mind using the BSD-style init. Like I 
said I have a OpenBSD system and my setup is pretty simple. About the 
only service beyond the basics I have running under OpenBSD is Samba.

I know Kodak has quite few cameras out there but I don't know if the 
usbdevfs needs to be mounted for any of the EasyShare cameras like the 
DX3900. I have an EasyShare DX4900 and I access the camera directly 
though "gphoto2". 

The only special setup I did was to make it so my "hotplug" service sets 
up the USB port permissions for me so I don't have to be root to access 
my camera. All I did was to place an entry for my camera in the 
/etc/hotplug/usb.usermap file.

Read USB HOWTO at http://www.linux-usb.org/ for detailed instructions.

You need to find out what your USB controller is, most use usb-uhci or
usb-ohci module. Try "modprobe usb-uhci", if it fails, try the other one.
Then, when it works, add this to your modules.conf:

alias usb-controller usb-uhci # or usb-ohci

and may be modules for your USB peripherals,
alias char-major-13 mousedev
is USB mouse, for example (this is usually not necessary, hotplug loads
them automatically, but it stops those messages in the log about "cannot
find module char-major-13").

I'm sorry that I don't use RedHat but if you do have the "hotplug" 
service on your system you should have an "/etc/hotplug" directory on 
your system. I only had to add my own usermap entry for my DC4900 to 
the /etc/hotplug/usb.usermap file.

You can use "ghoto2" to get a list of the various "usbcam" usermap 
entries for all of the cameras "gphoto2" supports. To get a list use 
the "--print-usb-usermap" option. You mentioned your camera is a Kodak 
EasyShare DX3900 so that would be the user map with a vendor id of 
0x040a and there is a product ID but since I don't have a DX3900 I'm 
not sure what the product ID is exactly. 

With your camera in the dock, press the button on the dock and then when 
your logged in as root run "lsusb". Can you see your camera in the list 
of detected USB devices? You can get the product ID from that list.

I personally prefer dhcpcd, as my experience with pump (both on desktop 
and laptop) has been lackluster.  I believe it sets up the correct 
runlevel links for itself, whereas pump does not.  YMMV, however.

Yes but I should have said
 

cp /boot/config /usr/src/linux/.config

The dot in .config is significant.  Anyone know why this file is .config and 
not config?????

This is a VERY good tip.  The last thing you want to do is go thru config
trying to guess what some of those very obscure, to me, things mean.

Is this /boot/config a Debian thing or also a Redhat thing?

I can't help you there since my Kodak DX4900 doesn't require me to use 
the a usbdevfs to download the pictures from. I've tried accessing my 
camera through "kioslave" in KDE so I can access the camera in 
Konqueror with a "camera:/" URL. Unfortunately the "kioslave" 
incorrectly tries to access the camera as a usbdevfs and so I get some 
strange USB I/O errors.

Instead I use "gphoto2" from the command line to list and download the 
JPEG files from my camera.

My mileage is the same :-) dhcpcd seems to work with a wider range of 
dhcp servers than pump.

You must be running a different version than me since I can't find the area you're talking about. I've got 1.3.2 and according to the online docs, it does not yet support imap folders as a receptacle for messages. Since they went out of their way to mention it, I'm sure it's on a wish-list somewhere. ;-)

I'm teaching "Computer Science Orientation" at the local community college

She's a little uncertain about being in there because the 'the guys' seem

To keep the noise down please reply direct to me (raanders at acm.org) and

Hedy LaMarr??? Are you kidding?

How about the many women kernel hackers and developers and bugfixers etc: Val 
Henson, Telsa Gwynne, Akkana, Raven Alder, Jenn Vesperman, Deb Richardson, 
Tina Gasperson

Prominent women in computer science: Anita Borg, Evi Nemeth

There's gazillions more, that's what I can come up with before coffee.

They are all alive, at the moment, and active in high tech.

Send your lone woman student to http://www.linuxchix.org/, there is a local 
chapter which is meeting next Sunday.

with some versions of tar replace I with j, or use
bzip2 -cd /path_to_downloaded_kernel/linux-...tar.bz2 | tar xvf -

Is it safe to not touch them?  I never realized that a person vould
want to change /usr/include/linux.  Is this going to hurt me if I have
never changed them, since a 2.2 kernel?  And is there an easy way to
check what version is in /usr/include/linux? (I don't have a linux
system infront of me), can you just open one of the files and see the
version in the header?  Is there a way to query glibc to find out what
version of the kernel it was compiled against?

Thanks,
Jason

And one more question, if you change the version of glibc don't you
need to recompile programs to use the new version?  Or does the the
system figure that out at call time?

I have one FreeBSD box running Apache and am doing some simple hosting
currently
for one domain name.  However, I have the possibility of hosting some other
domain names.  My question is how do I set this up such that for a given
name it goes to the individual directory on the web server.  For instance
I want www.url1 to go to /www/url1 and www.url2 to go to /www/url2, etc...

Hello, 
I am assuming that you are going to use only one IP address.
Go here: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/vhosts/
And click on Name-based Virtual Hosts.

Depending on your version of apache, you probably have a separate Vhosts
directory and Vhosts.conf file to put the settings in. If I remember
correctly, older versions of apache just take these settings in
httpd.conf.

You need to read the Virtual Hosts section of the Apache documentation
at http://httpd.apache.org.  You should have a copy on your local
machine, also.

Is there anything in your system's CMOS settings that allow you to 
enable/disable the USB ports on your motherboard? It took me something 
like 20 minutes to get my camera to be recognized. After pressing the 
camera dock button a bunch of times and reseating the camera on the 
dock a bunch of times, I finally found my problem. As it turns out, I 
hadn't inserted the plug at the end of the USB cable all the way into 
the camera dock. Once I  figured out my problem my system finally 
detected the camera when I pressed the button on the dock.

Were you able to determine whether you have a running "hotplug" service 
on your RedHat system?

I don't know about the other DHCP clients but back when I had @Home I 
used "dhcpcd" because I was required to include my assigned @Home 
hostname to get an IP Address from their DHCP server(s). I'm not sure 
if some of the other DHCP client's supported that ability or not. Since 
AT&T took over after @Home dumped me I don't need to specify a hostname 
any more when I run "dhcpcd". I do see that I still get my old hostname 
back in the DHCP reply when I look at the info file "dhcpcd" creates.

One of the things I am trying to do with the PLUG website is to offer
a collection of links to groups promoting Open Source in the NorthWest.
A lot of these links I have found thru diligents searches, but a few
I have found simply by stumbling over them. (Or stumbling over a dead
link to a lost website.) And I have yet to thoroughly cover what exists
to the north in Washington.

But one blind spot I've had is local chapters of national groups promoting
Open Source. Linuxchix is obviously one of them. I'm aware that Perl Mongers
at oen time has (or had?) a local chapter, & that a Ruby group is being
organized. Are there any other groups that I should include in the web site?

Maybe this will provide me with the content I'm always asking for at the
meetings.

I don't think this is ROT (Really Off Topic).

My wife, Nancy, is a mathematical statistician specializing in forest
genetics.  Thus, her profession is at the intersection of two male dominated
professions.  She makes good money, likes her colleagues, and enjoys her
work; and she doesn't think it is a big deal to work in a male
dominated field.

However, she does say a number of things about being a woman in
a male dominated profession.

First, it is a lot easier if people respect you for your technical
ability.  Otherwise, people think you got hired as part of some
"quota program", and they will make life hard on you.  Also, watch
men with second rate technical skills.  They find women and minorities
much more threatening than most men do.

Second, Nancy talks a lot about the social aspects of working in a male
dominated profession.  A professional woman has to figure out how
to fit in and relate to her professional colleagues - most of whom
are men; and also how to relate to the organization's secretaries
and clerical staff - most of whom are women - without becoming one
of them.

In any case, I would recommend that you have your female student talk
to a couple real women in computing about their experience.  I think
this might be more revealing than pointing out a number of famous
woman in computer science.

It is possible. I had a 3-4 year old PC with a usb controller that
wouldn't work under Linux (the drivers loaded fine but devices were never
recognized.) This weekend I upgraded to RedHat 7.3, disabled the on-board
USB, and installed a cheap d-link USB card and it "just worked".

BTW, I've had good experiences with gtkam.

I run Junkbuster, and it has worked well for a long time.  Unfortunately,
I've recently started to notice problems with it which I have not been
able to nail down.  Blocked URLs will get requested (I can see them in a
packet trace) but they will not be blocked (action completes, no log in
the junkbuster log even in debug mode.)  This is particularly annoying
when requests for http://page.i.want.com gets mixed with requests for
http://evil.doubleclick.net in the same TCP stream.  I suspect that some
recent MSIE enhancement is responsible for this.  (I've already tried
disabling HTTP/1.1 from within MSIE, but it doesn't seem to make any

For that reason I've started to look at squid + adzapper
(http://www.zip.com.au/~cs/adzap/index.html).  Unfortunately, this combo
seems to have some issues transparently passing NTLM authentication on to
the !@#$@* proxy I'm forced to use at work.  I have not had time to
investigate fully.  (It seems like NTLM gets passed properly for the first
request, but not for subsequent requests.  It's wierd.)

Ah, but it is. The frequency hopping technique used by 802.11 wireless
networking can be directly traced back to the torpedo tecnology.

Have you checked your syslog and see if there are any USB related 
messages. I get the following messages when I press the button on my 
Kodak camera dock:

Sep  3 15:37:13 tigger kernel: hub.c: USB new device connect on bus1/2, 
assigned device number 7
Sep  3 15:37:13 tigger kernel: usb.c: USB device 7 (vend/prod 
0x40a/0x550) is not claimed by any active driver.

I see an other user posting saying that perhaps your motherboard is old 
and the USB ports may not work properly with Linux. That could be as my 
motherboard is from 2001 so it's fairly new.

Here's a quote from the 802.11 White Paper:

"The 802.11 Working Group decided in July 1992 to concentrate its
radio frequency studies and standardization efforts on the 2.4 GHz
spread spectrum ISM bands for both the direct sequence and frequency
hopping PHYs."

So, your point is?? ;^)

Subject: [PLUG] [OT] Seeking Security Certification Advice
Message-ID: <GJELJBAKILGBFNJHBMKGKEMICGAA.CurtisE@CurtisE.net>

After 11 months of looking, I finally landed a job!  Yea!
The bad news is that it requires me to move to California.  Boo!

Anyway, It's an information security job.  Although I have a fair amount of
security experience, it's never been my main gig.  My background is mostly
in system administration and network engineering (NT, UNIX, Linux, Cisco
etc.).

One of my assigned goals in this new job is to obtain a security related
certification within 1 year.  I know there are some security 'heavy hitters'
on this list and would be very grateful for some input on which cert I
should pursue.  I would like to go for a cert that will be respectable in
the industry and enhance my marketability (when backed up with some
experience, of course).

My first thought was CISSP, but I don't meet the experience requirements to
qualify (3 years full time, security title... & 4 years starting in Jan.).
While checking out the CISSP cert, I noticed (ISC)2 now offers another cert
called SSCP and I do meet the requirements for that one.  Any thoughts on
the SSCP or other certs I should consider?

Thanks,
CurtisE

Well, first, I think your use of the word "fun" for a project on women in
computing belies a certain attitude that is perhaps part of the reason
women are pushed away from the field.  "Isn't this silly?  GIRLS did it!"

Second, I think the idea of "Women in Computing" as a subject creates one
of them there "separate but equal" fallacies.  Separate is inherently
unequal.

While the thought is sort of sweet and quaint, it's also antiquated and
not helpful.  It sounds like the 1950s approach.  You can probably achieve
something a little more progressive and enlightened.

Perhaps you should just make a point of mentioning the women in computing
during your anecdotal material related to the history of computer science
and maybe go a bit out of your way to find relevant quotes in the
prominent newsgroups and mailing list archives by female hackers to
illustrate points made in the lectures.

It's actually really super easy.

First, I'm going to just suggest that you RTFM.
<URL: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/vhosts/index.html > (for 1.3)

You are best off, in my opinion, using mod_vhost_alias if you'll be
hosting multiple named sites (either by hostname or domain) on a single
IP.  This allows you to specify information for virtual hosts based on
parsed data from the name given to the httpd server by the client.  You
can read all about that here:
<URL: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_vhost_alias.html >

If you have more specific questions, please direct them to the list.

Message-ID: <20020904153358.13095.qmail@web14402.mail.yahoo.com>

I'm having problems getting GNUplot 3.71 on linux to correctly label
the timestamps on data when using the Unix format of seconds since
1970.

I'm just running a log file through it, and graphing data vs. time,
pretty simple.

Here's a sample of the data:

Timestamp data1 data2

1031151840 97 51
1031151900 83 26
...

Here's the gnuplot command line:

gnuplot "script.bat" > dataplot.png

And here is my gnuplot script.

set term png color
set xlabel "Time -->"
plot "data.log" using 1:2 with lines, "data.log" using 1:3 with lines

Anyway, gnuplot is converting the timestamps to exponential notation
and printing them at the bottom of the graph. What I would like
is to just have the hour of the day printed, and I can't figure out
how to make it work. The manual is not very clear about this
particular function and doesn't provide any decent examples. All
of my experimenting ends up with the data being lumped into a single
vertical line and gnuplot complaining about incorrect date
formatting, if it works at all.
Does anybody have any experience with this? I've come across a
mention 
of an undocumented timefmt "%s" option, but nothing that seems to
work.

Thanks!

If you run Debian GNU/Linux, it's as simple as running a stock kernel
or one configured starting with a stock configuration, then running:

 # apt-get install hotplug hotplug-utils

That will give you USB hotplug support, amoung other things.  It
should "Just Work" from that point forward.  (Though I don't know if
it automaticly creates device nodes on a non-devfs system; you may
like to start using devfs for this; apt-get install devfsd and add
"devfs=mount" to your boot loader append line)

I wonder if there needs to be a driver for the hub itself, and if you
have the "hotplug" demon running?

Ok, it's probably built into the kernel already.  Boot with "apm=on"
once and try again.  If that does not work, rebuild or install a stock
2.4.18 kernel.

Is devfs ready for show time?  I was under the impression that it had
many bugs and wan incompatible with the traditional /dev system.

Thanks,

It's also best to use "apt-get install kernel-package", "man
make-kpkg" to build a Debian kernel package, since that gives you the
postinstall Lilo/Grub setup hooks and initrd building (if configured).

After you install "kernel-package", run:

man kernel-pkg.conf
man kernel-img.conf
man make-kpkg

Actually, with a very modular stock kernel that requires an initrd to
boot, you probably get about the same thing as a custom built kernel,
as far as the minimal set of driver modules using RAM resources, etc.

You could try using ghostscript to turn it into bitmap files, running
gocr on them to get ASCII, then writing in the markup.  Or you could
use ps2text on them, if that works.

The best thing is to just try and find the original document source.
Perhaps the author will share it with you?  Tell them you want to
learn LaTeX.

Our scheduled speaker had an emergency, so he can not speak Thursday
night.  Moreover, both of our stand-by speakers seem to be out of town.
Thus, we do not have a speaker for Thursday evening at this point.
So if anyone wants to speak on anything, here is your chance.
Give me a call and we will set it up.

                                          Sincerely,

   P.S.  I'm sending this to the Mid Valley and Eugene groups as well
   as the Portland group.  If you have a talk that you have given in
   Eugene or Corvallis, think about giving it in Portland - on Thursday.

Actually, this is the good thing about charging.
The instructor and students tend to show up when there is a tuition,
even when the tuition is small.
On the other hand, students shouldn't expect too much for $5 per
student per hour.  At this pay level, instructors couldn't afford
much preparation, so they would be more like expert coordinators
than professional trainers with lots of fancy prepared materials.

Actually, I didn't really mean that one should charge by the hour.
Instead, one would use these rates to set a tuition for a class.
Thus, a class scheduled to meet for 3 hours per week for two weeks
would have a retail tuition of 3x2x($15) = $90.00.  Like a college
class, the actual time with the instructor might be a bit less than
this or a bit more than this.

If anyone can put together a program of free classes, more power to them.
I personally don't think this is practical.
I personally would want to be paid a bit for my facilities if I had
classes in my home.
I personally would want to be paid a bit for my time if I taught a class.
Maybe other people would do this for free.  If so, go for it.

                                                     Dave Mandel

P.S.  Maybe one should vary the fee to fit the instructor and facility.
      (In other words, they would set them.  That is fair.)

Not that this relates to Women in Computing, but the local Perlmongers is
active again (it was fairly inactive for about a year or 2). Portland
Perlmongers has been taken over by Curtis 'Ovid' Poe and has been very
active (monthly meetings) for almost a year now.

That worked. I guess I'll have to go keyboard shopping.

PTP I/O error

In /etc/hotplug/usb.usermap I have all commented out except for;

usbcam               0x0003      0x040a   0x0170    0x0000       0x0000

0x00               0x00000000

 0x040a   0x0170  earlier in the process were the missing camera params for 
the dx3900

Am I on the right track?

I watched for a reference to apm in the messages scrolling up the
screen during boot. I saw:

apm: BIOS version 1.2 Flags 0X03 (Driver version 1.13)
apm disabled on user request

After a bit of man page reading and google searching, I learned that I
needed to edit lilo.conf, uncomment the append="" line and stick apm=on
inside those quotes, and also to run lilo before rebooting.

During the reboot, I saw only one apm message:

apm: BIOS version 1.2 Flags 0X03 (Driver version 1.13)

Sure enough, the system powers down, now.

Thanks for the hint, Karl, and also for not giving me the whole answer.
I learned a few other things about lilo in the process.

This apt source might help:

# java from blackdown.org (Sun Java 2)
deb ftp://ftp.tux.org/pub/java/debian woody non-free

If you include that, apt-update then 'apt-cache search blackdown' there
should be some nice java runtime and sdk packages.

You only need the usb.usermap "usbcam" entry if you want to be able to 
access your camera as a user other than root. You may need to stop and 
start your "hotplug" service so your changes are picked up.

Subject: [PLUG] Quirky Mouse
Message-ID: <3D767B95.4EA7211A@attbi.com>

In searching for some hint as to why my mouse behaves strangely on my
newly installed Debian system (cursor doesn't move when mouse is moved
slowly), I came across this on google:

gpm and X problem investigated
http://lists.debian.org/debian-testing/2000/debian-testing-200008/msg00064.html

While I don't fully understand it yet, it appears to me that I need to
figure out if I'm using gpm, and how it is configured. Where do I look
for that information? man gpm reports: No manual entry for gpm. Could it
be that there is a misprint on that whole page and that I should be
looking at gdm?

One of the comments on that page is:

6. My personal experience shows that, with gpm repeating in the ms3
   protocol, the middle mouse button is very hard to get working in X,
if
   at all. Also, movement data of the mouse appears to get lost,
resulting
   in erratic and uncomfortable mouse behaviour.

That sounds like the behavior my mouse is exhibiting. Is this the
direction I should be pursuing?

Have you tried it with gpm disabled? 
/etc/init.d/gpm stop 
will stop gpm, then restart X and see if that helps.

I've also found that controlling the mouse behavior through X directly,
rather than through a WM is more reliable.

I'm going to get a new keyboard tomorrow, one that will let me switch
between virtual consoles. Then, I'll give that a try.

What do I have to change to do that? I assume it's a configuration file
entry somewhere. Which one, and what should I be reading for background
so I understand what I'm doing?

Thanks for the help.

I think this depends on which one you are using.  To test the X
drivers, you could create the file ~/.xsession (or is it ~/.xinit, i
usually create one and make it a symlink to the other), with just one
line that says xterm.  Then type startx, you should get a gray lined
background and a single xterm window.  Hit ctrl+alt+backspace to
exit. If your mouse works better than normal when you do that, then
your WM is conflicting with the X driver.  Then we need to know which
WM you are using.  Is it Gnome, KDE, enlightenment, there are many
choices.

HTH,
Jason

My point is, that the final spec for 802.11b specifies DSSM which is
spread spectrum, not FHSM, which is frequency hopping.

I find init 3 to be good for debugging, but that's just me.

The file is /etc/X11/XF86Config or XF86Config-4, depending on your version
of X (< 4 and 4, respectivly). If you have a lot of config files in there
with similar names, you will have to confirm which one is being used. An
easy way to do this is to put some plain text at the top of the file (not in
a comment). If X starts, that wasn't the correct file :).

I use X 4.??, so your file may look different, but here is my mouse section:

Section "InputDevice"
   Identifier  "Configured Mouse"
   Driver      "mouse"
   Option      "CorePointer"
   Option      "Device"    "/dev/psaux"  #ps/2 mouse on /dev/psaux
   Option      "Protocol"     "ImPS/2"   
   Option      "Emulate3Buttons" "false" #I have a 3 button mouse.
   Option      "ZAxisMapping"    "4 5"   # ...with a wheel
   Option      "Resolution"      "200"   # this affects how sensative the
	                                      # mouse is. IIRC, higher is faster.
EndSection


In X 3.3.6, I _think_ you want something like this for the resolution line:

Resolution	200


I've never really read/seen/looked for any Xconfig documentation, I've done
a lot of trial&error work and cannabalized from many subject-specific
how-to's and random XF86Config files.

Since man gpm didn't return anything, you don't have gpm installed.  I,
personally, like to use gpm because it adds an interpretive layer
between the mouse device (/dev/psaux or whatever) and the X-server, as
well as making it possible to copy and paste between consoles. The basic
concept is that the gpm daemon reads the mouse device, then it can
modify the data and writes the new information to another device:
/dev/gpmdata.  If your X-server is configured to read /dev/gpmdata as
the mouse device, then it will see the filtered signal instead of the
"raw" event.  The huge advantage here is that you can start the X-server
(it will start as long as /dev/gpmdata exists) with a broken mouse
configuration, and just by changing gpm settings you can reconfigure the
mouse and get it working WITHOUT restarting your X-server.

This does have limitations, the protocol you pick for the X-server must
be close to the actual protocol, use ImPS/2 for most PS2 mice, use ms
for most serial mice.  Getting gpm to work correctly is usually a
serious round of trial and error, mainly because there is no standard
for mouse data and some manufacturers tried really hard to not be
standard.

I think so, the mouse, in general, behaves much better when filtered
through gpm and the gpm daemon has many more protocols available than
the X-server.

So, it wasn't a misprint.

I like this concept. I seem to recall, now that you mention it, having
read something about being able to unplug keyboards if gpm is in use.
While not something I'd need to do every day, it could come in handy
from time to time, like the other day when I managed to disconnect my
keyboard while shifting some things around on the desk.

So, if I run apt-get install gpm, that should set it up, and give me a
man page, but I'd have to reboot in order for it to run, right?

Subject: [PLUG] parted advice, please
Message-ID: <3D76A73E.CCFCBEA2@attbi.com>

For some reason, when I set up the partitions for my new Debian install,
I made a poor choice regarding the sizes of /usr and /home. I've
installed parted (I guessed that apt-get -install parted would do it,
and it did!) and now I'm studying the instructions for how to change
things. I have some questions about what I'm planning to do:

1. Unless I decide to change the size of the Windows partition, do I
need to do anything about the warning I get when I start parted?

  Using /dev/hda
  Warning: The operating system thinks the geometry on /dev/hda is
  1583/255/63. Therefore, cylinder 1024 ends at 8032.499M.  You have
  Windows FAT partition(s) that are not using LBA.  If your BIOS
  supports LBA, then you should switch to LBA by setting the LBA flag
  on all FAT partitions.  Otherwise, make sure the operating system and
  the BIOS have the same geometry before resizing any FAT partitions.

2. Is what I describe below correct, or did I miss something important?
Also, is 1G reasonable for /home, or should I be planning something more
involved?

When I created the partitions, I made /usr 1G and /home 4G. I should
have done that the other way around, but since they are adjacent, it
should be relatively painless to fix. From what I'm reading at:

http://www.gnu.org/manual/parted-1.6.1/html_node/parted_32.html

I should be able to shrink /home, create a new partition at the end of
/home's old space, copy /home to that partition, delete the old /home,
and then add the leftover space from the to /usr. Have I missed anything
important that would prevent me from doing that, or cause me serious
grief? 

Here's the details:

Parted's print command reports:

  Disk geometry for /dev/hda: 0.000-12419.056 megabytes
  Disk label type: msdos
  Minor    Start       End     Type      Filesystem  Flags

  8       9240.543   9287.578  logical   ext2
  9       9287.609  12417.429  logical   ext2

df -h reports:

  Filesystem          Size   Used Avail Use% Mounted on
  /dev/hda2            91M    28M   58M  33% /
  /dev/hda6           957M   772M  137M  85% /usr
  /dev/hda7           3.8G   271M  3.2G   8% /home
  /dev/hda8            45M    22k   43M   1% /tmp
  /dev/hda9           3.0G    89M  2.7G   4% /var

The sequence of instructions would be as follows:

Shrink /home to about 1G.

(parted) resize 7 5334.113 6358.113

Make a new, 1G partition at the end of the free space. It will be #10.

(parted) mkpartfs logical ext2 8216.512 9240.512

Copy the old /home to its new location.

(parted) cp 7 10

Delete the old /home.

(parted) rm 7

Resize /usr to use up the newly available space.

(parted) resize 6 4361.427 8216.511

Quit parted and edit /etc/fstab.

Since deleting the old #7 caused 8, 9, and 10 to be renumbered 7, 8, and
9, then the new /home is 9, /tmp is 7, and /var is 8. So, I'd need to
change some lines in fstab from:

/dev/hda7     /home   ext2   defaults         0     2
/dev/hda8     /tmp    ext2   defaults         0     2
/dev/hda9     /var    ext2   defaults         0     2

to:

/dev/hda9     /home   ext2   defaults         0     2
/dev/hda7     /tmp    ext2   defaults         0     2
/dev/hda8     /var    ext2   defaults         0     2

Then, after I reboot, I should have more room in /usr, less room in
/home, and everybody else stayed the same.

Gnome, but just because that's the one I've used on my RH systems. I've
tried KDE once or twice, but never long enough to get to know it.

I have XF86Config-4.

Mine is similar. The differences are that I have "true" for
"Emulate3Buttons", and I don't have a "Resolution" entry. My mouse is a
Micro Innovations optical wheel mouse that has a combination
wheel/middle button. I'll try changing my "Emulate3Buttons" to "true"
and adding a "Resolution" entry and see what I get.

Thanks for the information.

Unplugging a keyboard is usually no big deal, but gpm is only for the
mouse, it does nothing with the keyboard.  With gpm, you should be able
to stop the server (/etc/init.d/gpm stop), unplug your mouse, plug in a
new one and run gpmconfig to get it working; all without rebooting.

No reboot required, it will be running when the installation is
finished. However, you will need to restart your X-server after you have
modified the configuration file.  The config file has the command to
re-run the debconf script, if you are using debconf to handle your
X-server configuration.  <crtl>+<alt>+<Backspace> will restart it, or
kill it, depending on your system configuration.

Warning:  Im a newbie, dont take me very seriously. :)  I'm hopeing to come
to the meeting tomorow night.
It *might* be the same, if someone forgot the .gz convention.  .gz means it
is a zip file and the command
tar -zxfv File.name.tar has the -z to 'filter through the zip format' before
uncompressing.  If that doesnt work tar -xfv should.
Then I would assume procede as normal.

If it is a slackware package, you do installpkg on it.

Otherwise, try tar -xvzf filename.tgz

tgz==tar.gz

That worked. I might reduce the sensitivity somewhat, but it's much
nicer than before.

Thanks to all for all the ideas. I'll still try some of them, since the
whole point of this exercise is to learn. But, the addition of
"Resolution" with a value of 150 to my XF86Config-4 file solved my
immediate problem.

Use xset from a terminal when you are in X if you want to "find" the
perfect setting with out restarting X.  I don't remember the exact
command, but it shouldn't be hard to figure out.

I don't know if you ever bothered to read the FAQ on why Evolution does
this, but it's because it's the "Standard."  This is how all email
programs _should_ do it.  And since Evo wanted to be standards
complient...Well...This is what it came up with.

Emulate3Buttons allows you to simulate a middle button click by
simeotaneously clicking the left and right mouse buttons (if set to true).

Just so you know what it does, IMHO, it is an anachronism of an option, but
if you don't like clicking with the wheel button this is an alternative I
suppose.

That isn't always true...

I fubar'd my MANPATH on the solaris/hpux systems at work, and now get "No
manual entry for ...." all the time for programs that I use on a daily
basis (ssh for one). Linux may be more intelligent, and I haven't been able
to reproduce the problem at home, but it does exist on some systems.

My understanding is that the .tgz extension was developed as a
workaround for certain ancient filesystems that restricted filenames
to an 8.3 format (up to 8 characters, followed by a dot (.), followed
up up to three characters). Those filesystems couldn't handle, say,
foo.tar.gz, so it was trunctated to foo.tgz.

The .tgz extension is/was a kludge for PC/MS DOS filenaming.  As you may
not know DOS is limited to 1-8 characters in the filename and 0-3 in the
extension sometimes represented by 'FILENAME.EXT'.  Since the period (or
dot) is a separator/delimiter in DOS (verses an actual character in
UNIX/Linux and some other OS') you can't use more than one.
   So you get filename.tgz instead of filename.tar.gz.

And to finally answer your question - the same way you do the .tar.gz 
files.

mod_ssl is included with apache 2.0; it should be right there in your

Isn't something already planned? That's what one of the emails (I

You are correct, it is always possible to delete a man entry, however I
had a 99.9% confidence level in that statement.  Two reasons: he was
talking about a fresh debian install, and he is being very careful with

Message-ID: <3D779AAC.7030102@sun.com>

Since Rogan (I think?) said he fubared his manpath entry on his Solaris 
box, I figured I'd share a little thing I did during a class I took on 
Solaris System Administration.

I'm used to using 'locate' when I need something.  Of course, Solaris 
doesn't provide that feature natively, and our class machines didn't 
have internet access, so I couldn't see if the GNU Tools had it either. 
  I remembered from poking around at the scripts that update the locate 
database (updatecb) that all it really does is a 'find' and drops that 
data into a file for later lookup.  So this is exactly what I 
implemented on my Solaris box.

First, I created a script that created the database.  I called it 
updatedb.  It called find, indexing from root, not looking at remote 
filesystems, and dumping everything it found into a file somewhere in /var.

Secondly, I created the locate command itself.  Basically all it did was 
grep that created file for whatever argument you specified.

Then, I created a cron job that would run updatedb every evening.

I'm sure the data file structure could have been more elegant, but I was 
really more interested in getting functionality out of the program than 
making it pretty.  It took me a few minutes of class to get it working 
the way I wanted (while the teacher was tutoring the less enlightened 
students) and I learned quite a bit just doing stuff on my own.

FYI Rogan - my current MANPATH looks like so:

/usr/man:/usr/openwin/man:/usr/local/tools/man:/usr/local/man

[10:51:35] $  uname -a
SunOS ecola 5.8 Generic_108528-15 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-80

Just so everyone knows (I'm sure Richard does), locate and slocate are
all free software and can be compiled on Solaris without any
difficulty:

ftp://ftp.geekreview.org/slocate/src/slocate-2.6.tar.gz
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/findutils/findutils-4.1.tar.gz

> FYI Rogan - my current MANPATH looks like so:

Another data point:

  [heinlein]$ uname -a
  SunOS hepburn 5.8 Generic_108528-14 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10
  [heinlein]$ echo $MANPATH
  /usr/share/man:/usr/man:/usr/java/man:/usr/openwin/man:/usr/dt/man

Other good candidates for $MANPATH include /usr/local/man, 
/usr/local/share/man, and a host of more obscure directories:

  /opt/SUNWspro/man      -- Sun Workshop compilers
  /usr/j2se/man          -- Java 1.4

Hello Linux folkz,
Imagine WinXP installed on RAID-0 of two 
IDE hard drives connected to onboard High Point 
software raid controller.
Is there any chance to read this NTFS stripped RAID-0 
partition from Linux when WinXP is in its usual 
shut down mode. 
This boxen needs to be setted as a dual boot 
Linux/Win system with RAID-0 for the both systems.
It this possible to do at all?
Many thanks in advance for any advises or sources of
information.

You need to mount the USBdevfs under /proc.  The generic usb libs that
gphoto2 uses can detect a device, but to do IO with it they use the
/proc/bus/usb entries.

*If* you will be using the devices as a normal user (non-root) you
need to install the hotplug system and configure its scripting to set
permissions on the usb device as it becomes active.


Anyway to make it work as root, add

none   /proc/bus/usb   usbdevfs   defaults   0 0

or similar to your fstab, and make sure usbdevfs is compiled in or
module is loaded.

Not that I have ever heard of.  They will both do RAID0, but with
defferent on disk layouts.  It would be like trying to swap an array
between 2 different hardware RAID controllers, they both do the same
thing, but the minor stuff (disk id headers, exact layout, etc)
caries.

Would it be possible to do it the other way?  Could you use ext3, and
have XP read that?  Or perhaps, as another poster suggested the
problem is in the RAID aspect.  I wouldn't trust the NTFS support in
linux, but I bet someone has ported the fs code for ext3 to windows.

What about having linux put it's filesystem on top on NTFS.  I know
slackware could do this back in the days of win95 because that was the
way I installed it....ah my first linux install...those were the days
:)

I had a similar problem a couple months ago, getting Evolution to
connect to Opera.  Gnome has an applet that sets this up, but since I
wasn't running Gnome, it wasn't obvious to me how to move forward since
I couldn't find the relevant configuration file.

After some help from the list, I stumbled across an applet that
configures default browser for Evolution and (I think) other
Gnome-related apps:

/usr/bin/default-applications-properties

Hope that helps!

I don't think you can put a filesystem in NTFS and have it work very
well.

I think you're thinking of ZipSlack/BigSlack, which were just regular
ol' Linux, made to install easily onto a UMSDOS system.  UMSDOS is just,
essentially, an interesting extention to the FAT filesystem which
allowed Linux-style permissions with the use of extra files in each
directory.

UMSDOS wouldn't work with NTFS.

You could, I suppose, create a loopback filesystem on the NTFS
partition, but you'd be asking for trouble.  It would probably be a wee
bit on the slow side, and likely unstable... Linux's ability to write to
NTFS was still 'experimental' or 'dangerous' last I looked.

This is not so in some cases. I access my Kodak DX4900 directly using 
"gphoto2" without using the USBdevfs support. I have found that KDE 
incorrectly assumes that all digital cameras require the usbdevfs 
through a "kioslave" for digital camera access and I get I/O errors 
because of it. It is true that some cameras are accessed through a USB 
filesystem but there are quite a few cameras that aren't as well. I 
believe in the case of a camera that is mounted using the USBdevfs that 
there is no need to use "gphoto2" at all since I assume the pictures 
would be accessed like any other mounted filesystem Linux supports 
using common file utilities like "ls", and "cp" to list and copy the 
files from the camera to another location.

You are correct about the use of the "hotplug" service so permissions 
can be set to allow non-root users access to a digital camera.

No, usbdevfs is like devfs.  It *DOES NOT* provide access to the
cameras filesystem.  What it does is create block/char devices
automagicly based on the bus/device id.  usbdevfs is *required* for
every USB interfaced camera I have worked with, though I understand a
few don't use the default interface (direct camera specific module
instead of the generic one).  Of course serial, parallel and SCSI
cameras do not require usbdevfs devices.

I think you are thinking of camera filesystem access via a CardFlash
or CompactFlash reader.  These allow you to mount the filesystem on
the flash directly.

Perhaps the usb-storage module?  Some cameras use that -  my HP c315 
does.  The Sandisk CF card reader I have uses it as well - which I 
bought because neither W2k nor XP could read the 128Meg card natively 
from my camera.  98SE and Linux, however, see it just fine.

Subject: [PLUG] Network card problem
Message-ID: <000e01c25532$5eabd340$8701a8c0@barkingcorndog>

Hello everyone!

    I have recently changed my system from Red Hat 7.3 to Debian Woody. After installing Debian, I can't seem to figure out the problem with the network card. I can't give you the ifconfig info right now, since I'm sending this mail from work and don't have access to my machine right now. Here's the info I have:
Card: Netgear FA312
Driver: natsemi
        Everything I saw online regarding this card said to use this driver. Also, that's the one that kudzu chose for me.
I have the interface configured with:
IP: 192.168.0.5
gateway: 192.168.0.1
netmask: 255.255.255.0
network: 192.168.0.0
my /etc/network/interfaces file is identical to another machine on my network (except for the ip address, of course), also running Debian, which works just fine. 
When I try to ping anything on the network (gateway, mail server, my wife's machine, laptop), I don't get anything at all. No 'network unreachable', etc. It just sits there until I ctrl-c, then it tells me how many packets were sent, 100%failure, etc. 
ifconfig shows all of the info correctly, so I can see that it's configured.
Here's where the problem gets interesting: none of the lights do anything on my card at all. at all. Nothing when I'm trying to ping, nothing when I boot, nothing when it's just sitting there. I tried removing and re-inserting the card, but still nothing. It worked just fine under Red Hat a couple of days ago. I really don't want to reinstall Red Hat just to see if the card still works. Any ideas on where to look next?

Thanks,
Josh Zeckser

It's the PCMCIA system.  I've had a similar problem with my laptop
since I upgraded from RH 6.2 to the 7.x series, except in reverse.  My
network card stopped working in 7.x and I have to manually install
drivers, since the yenta_socket driver doesn't support my bridge.

Karl or one of the other PLUG people who use Debian will chime in
soon with better directions.  If they're unable to help you, then
I'd go back to RedHat.

Sorry,

    I need to be more clear. The system with the misbehaving network card is
a desktop PC. It's a PCI card. Actually, my laptop with the PCMCIA card
works just fine under Debian.

My apologies.  When you said you removed and re-inserted, I assumed
that it was a 15-second job instead of opening the case.

In that case, the odds are pretty good that either:

1) It's still a bad network driver. (not PCMCIA)
  - Check /var/log/messages for strange messages during the boot
    sequence.

  - Make sure that the driver is loaded by typing lsmod (being root
    will help due to the path).

  - See if it's being seen by the PCI bus by doing lspci.

  - Make sure that the kernel versions in Woody and RH 7.3 are similar.
    If Woody's is much different than 7.3, then I'd see if you can get
    a similar kernel from Woody to what you were using before.
    That won't be fun because you don't have a network interface.
    Good alternatives are burning CDROM's, or you could get a USB to
    ethernet converter.  Of course, you may have as many problems
    with that as the network card.

2) Bad hardware.  Then you have no other option except to try it out
   with what you knew was working before and see it still works.

Good luck, and sorry for the earlier slip,
Colin

Did you try pinging itself with the 192.168.0.5 address?  Does ifdown
and ifup work?

I tried removing and re-inserting the card, but still nothing. It worked just fine under Red Hat a couple of days ago. I really don't want to reinstall Red Hat just to see if the card still works. Any ideas on where to look next?

No link light is not good, that usually means the hardware has a
problem.  In this case, you should test the cable and the device at the
other end. (Does the link light lite up on the other end?)  If you are
sure that the cable and other end device are good, then do a complete
power cycle, not just a reboot, but power down, wait 30 seconds, then
power up.  Remember, nothing is going to happen if you don't have a link
light on both ends.

If none of this works, we'll need more juicy details.

Thanks,

    I'm going to try all the stuff you listed here when I get home. I had
tried everything I knew and needed some pointers on where to go next. You
have provided several. I'll also try Rogan's advice and get a different port
on the hub. Maybe even try replacing the cable.
    Regarding kernel versions, I'm using 2.4.x kernels with Woody and with
RH, so there shouldn't be much difference, right?

I've looked when I've had my camera enabled and I don't see any USB 
related modules being used by the kernel so I figured I wasn't using 
the usbdevfs stuff in Linux. I admit it's a blackbox for me as I just 
use "gphoto2" and it works. :)

It's always safest(paranoid) to make sure that x on RH and x on Debian
are close.

Yes, kernel is 2.4.18. I've been using the card for quite some time and
never had problems before.

Pinging itself works fine. ifdown and ifup both work.

I have done complete power cycles. The link doesn't have lights on either
end, though I'm using the same cable and same port on the hub that I was
using a couple of days ago with Red Hat. I'll try some more stuff and if
they don't work, I'll have lots of juicy details sometime around midnight.

Subject: [PLUG] Configuring GRUB
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0209051824460.3416-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  This one machine boots only into linux, but I have a VFAT partition with a
couple of small apps that I access via dosemu. However, GRUB sees the
partition filesystem and puts the choice in menu.lst:

# grub.conf generated by anaconda
#
# Note that you do not have to rerun grub after making changes to this file
# NOTICE:  You have a /boot partition.  This means that
#          all kernel and initrd paths are relative to /boot/, eg.
#          root (hd0,1)
#          kernel /vmlinuz-version ro root=/dev/hda1
#          initrd /initrd-version.img
#boot=/dev/hda
default=0
timeout=10
splashimage=(hd0,1)/grub/splash.xpm.gz
title linux (2.4.18-3)
	root (hd0,1)
	kernel /vmlinuz-2.4.18-3 ro root=/dev/hda1
	initrd /initrd-2.4.18-3.img
title DOS
	rootnoverify (hd0,9)
	chainloader +1

  I learned the hard way that I cannot just comment out the line that reads,
"title DOS", for that prevents the system from booting. Of course, that
makes sense when I look at the file, for GRUB is trying to use a chain
loader with linux and gets terribly confused. That makes two of us.

  Anyway, I want to remove all mention of the DOS filesystem and the
splashimage. I read a rather comprehensive web page on GRUB and the GRUB
info pages without seeing explicit confirmation that just removing them will
be OK. Implicit confirmation, but I don't want to put the system into a
potentially unstable state if I need to reboot.

  So, can I just remove the last three lines and the one that starts,
'splashimage=...'?

Thanks,

Rich

Another few ideas:

1) Test the port on the hub, either with another computer, or put a
crossover cable into the port in question, and a good port on the same hub
(a standard cable will work if you have an uplink port that you know works).

2) Try a different pci slot. You mentioned that you removed the card and put
it back in again, but it could be a problem with that specific pci slot.

You should be able to, this is how my grub.conf  looked before I added

worked the first time. The directions at:

http://www.gnu.org/manual/parted-1.6.1/html_node/parted_32.html

were mostly clear. I guessed that when they said the filesystems
shouldn't be active that I should be working at run level 1 and that I
should umount the systems on who's partitions I wanted to work. After I
was done shrinking /home, and growing /usr, I had to edit /etc/fstab.
Guess where the editors are kept! /usr, which of course, was no longer
available. There's probably a better way, but I simply used cat to
reconstruct fstab. I kept a copy of the old one, displayed it for
reference, and ran "cat > fstab" to create a new one. (If I ever have to
do this again, I'll remember to create the new fstab before I start
parted, since I'll have planned it thoroughly enough to know what fstab
should look like before I start.)

When I rebooted, every thing looked just fine! While I managed this one
on my own, I want to thank this list for all the help over the last few
days, that gave me the confidence to try something "dangerous."

Change timeout to 1 and it will boot so fast you won't even notice it.

I believe I have discovered the culprit, but I can't figure out how to
get rid of the problem. I checked /var/log/messages and found:

eth0: NatSemi DP8381[56] at 0xd48a5000, 00:a0:cc:a2:97:e1, IRQ 10.
eth0: Too much work at interrupt, status=0xd9000010.
eth0: Too much work at interrupt, status=0xd9000038.
eth0: increased Tx theshold (that isn't a typo), txcfg 0x10f0103e.
eth0: PCI error 0x800000

Those are all the messages with 'eth0'.
The only other message with a reference to 'IRQ 10' is:
PCI: Found IRQ 10 for device 00:12.0

So...How do I find out what is conflicting, which IRQ I can use, and how
to change IRQ settings?

Thanks for the help!

   That would work under normal circumstances. However, once I get
everything else working again, I'll build the 2.4.19 kernel and test it
before making it the default. I need time to select the kernel to use for
booting.

  Besides all this, pressing the [Enter] key isn't a bother and the machines
are up 24/7/365 anyway. Except during major upgrades, of course.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0209060657260.6070-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  There is a whole drawer of tools for keeping system files updated to the
latest releases, and I'm now a believe in one of them: apt-rpm. This will
now permit me to keep the two workstations and the two notebooks up to date
with the kernel and GNU tools. But, ... there are the end user apps that
also need updating and synchronization among the machines.

  I've tended to download the packages on my main machine and update/freshen
that box. When I have the time -- and I remember -- I also make them
available on an nfs-shared filesystem and update the other workstation. The
portables tend to remain behind because they're not on and used as
constantly.

  Is there a tool to facilitate updating/freshening packages on multiple
machines? For example, I just ftp'd the newest glib2 and gtk2 packages,
freshened one box, then deleted the rpms because I forgot that I need to do
the other machine, too. Since I try to not spend my days -- and nights --
maintaining the network here, any tool or system that makes it easier for me
will be welcomed.

TIA,

These are some of the tools I know when troubleshooting pci issues.

	lspci

	cat /proc/pci

	dmesg

	scanpci

Also, some bioses will display a listing of pci based devices and their 
irq's at the tail end of the "post" sequence and just before the os loads 
the bootloader.

More often than not, linux just uses the IRQ that the BIOS assigned to
the card.  The BIOS should display the IRQ assignments at the end of the
POST cycle.  The easiest way (and often the only way) to change the IRQ
is to stuff the card into another PCI slot.  Check your motherboard
manual for a list of the IRQ's that are shared.

That's not an interupt issue. Changing the IRQ the cards on will simply 
change the message. The issue appears to be the module not being able to 
keep up with the traffic the nic is sending to it.

I've had the same issue with Intel EEPRO 10/100 cards. I found out the 
module has a problem with high bandwidth levels. Unfortunately, the 
"high bandwidth level" they were talking about was able to be reach on a 
10 mbit segment of my network.

I tried increasing the tx and rx buffers, which resolved the problem for 
a short time. Eventually, traffic increased (mostly broadcasts from 
Winblows boxes). The way I fixed it finally, was to use a different 
network card.

I use Netgeat FA310s in my linux boxes. I believe Netgear has 
discontinued that model.

I know that's a different chipset (tulip, I think) than your FA312.

Another alternative would be to see if a newer kernel has fixes for your 
NIC module.

a GRUB guru in the group who could give a presentation on how

I was at the meeting, but had not read my email, or I would have
brought the CD's for you.

I can burn you a set of CD's if you like.  I think you will likely
only need disc's 1 and 2 at most, to start out.  Will the machine have
network access after it is installed?  I assume the answer is probably
"yes" for at least some of the time...

Since Debian uses "popularity contest" to determine what packages to
put on the first CD, the most popular software is on the first and
second CD's.

I live down by the waterfront, on Naito Parkway, near Union Station
(Amtrak).  My phone number is 503 222 4173; call me and we'll arrange
a pickup time for the CD's.  I'll burn them now.

On a Debian GNU/Linux system, it will be named:

 "/boot/config-$(uname -r)"

The Debian packaged kernel source is always renamed also, so that when
you unpack it, it creates:

 "kernel-source-$VERSION.$PATCHLEVEL.$SUBLEVEL/"

... rather than "linux/".  Has anyone ever untarred a new kernel
source right over the top of the old, by mistake?  The linux headers
that software is compiled against are shipped with libc-dev, NOT
symlinked to "/usr/src/linux/include".  If there was need to have that
symlink, that would imply that the software has a tight dependancy on
the particular kernel version it was built against.  This implies that
upgrading the kernel requires rebuilding that software.  There are few
programs for which this is actually true, and that is certainly by
design.  (iptables is one, IF you have applied any of the POM patches)

"ls" hides files whos names begin with "." by default, unless you
specify the "-a" switch.  Whoever named that file thought it should
normally be "hidden".

the Linux box and connecting from a Win98 client. 

I would like a sample of your smb.conf file and any changes necessary

I've started doing a google search, and I've found some entries. Haven't
had time to sift through them, though. Looks like I'd better make time.
While not an obvious, immediate problem, it may be pointing at something
down the road.

Rich:

Here's the patch vs. the current version of the VMWare module sources
found at http://www.vmware.com/download/modules/modules_ws.html#204.

You also need to have the linux kernel source installed.  There is
probably a way to work around this requirement, but since I almost always
have the source there anyhow, I didn't spend any time figuring out how.

Getting to the source can be tricky.  Untar/gzip the
"VMwareKernelModules-2.0.4-1401.tar.gz" file and look in
vmware-modules/lib/modules/source/ for three tar files.

Untar those three files and they'll create the directories:

vmmon-only
vmnet-only
vmppuser-only

Copy the patch below into your current directory (one level above those 
three new directories) and apply it.

For example:
$ patch -p0 < vmware-patch

Hand-patch the Makefiles to fix the line:

HEADER_DIR = /lib/modules/2.4.9-21/build/include/

to match the proper location for your kernel revision.

Run "make" in the three directories to test that everything is working OK.  
I get lots of warnings like:

warning: #warning linux/malloc.h is deprecated, use linux/slab.h instead.

I plan to ignore these until it breaks.  ;-)

After the "make" works, do a "make clean".

Now, we need to overwrite those tar files.  Just re-tar the appropriate
directory into the tar file of the correct name.  Locate those same tar
files on your system (usually /usr/lib/vmware, but I don't have a VMWare
2.0.4 system here to double check with) and copy these newly tarred files
over the top of them.  The "vmware-config.pl" script is hardcoded to
always use these files when installing kernel modules, so they have to
keep the same names.

Once you've installed the tar files, run "vmware-config" and let it build
the modules.  Hope they work.  ;-)

PS: This patch was based on work done by someone else I found about two
years ago via Google.  I have no idea who it was now and have since added
my own changes.

Subject: [PLUG] Debian auto logout?
Message-ID: <3D790797.420933BE@attbi.com>

Does Debian have a feature that logs out a user who had been inactive
for some period of time? Last night, I started apt-get install cupsys
and let it run overnight. I found a login screen this morning. I logged
in and found that cups is running. I opened the documentation via
http://localhost.... and started reading. I had to go out for a few
hours. When I came back, I found another login screen.

I assume this is part of the paranoid security model, which I agree
makes sense in a more public setting. However, I don't need it here at
home. What is this feature called, and where do I look for the
configuration options to change it?

Thanks in advance.

What shell do you use? I know the "csh/tcsh" shells have an "autologout" 
shell variable that specifies the amount of inactivity in minutes that 
must occur before a user is automatically logged out. I'm not sure if 
bash has this feature or not.

In bash the variable is called TMOUT I think.

Not sure... were you in X when it logged you out or a virtual console?
Incidentally, I heard Windows XP reboots automatically when it detects an
error, leading to interesting user experiences. I've noticed the same
thing sometimes in X, X dies and restarts itself when it encounters an
error (usually from my nvidia driver); perhaps that's what happened
to you?

oops, I read that backwards. You wanted to go the other
way. You need to make Galeon your default URL handler,
which on a RedHat Gnome system can be done via 

Settings > Document handlers > URL Handlers

Put galeon "%s"  in the http & https protocols

Sorry for the confusion,
Jon

  I'm not sure, Ray. We're a linux network running CUPS. When I fire up the
virtual-win98 to print a map it works just fine. Does VMware send it
directly out the port, without passing Go and collecting $200? Probably.
Anyway, it was working and, I am determined, will work again when I get this
upgrade fixed up.

I've never had a debian box automatically logout a user.  I'm pretty
sure you would have to purposely implement such a feature.

If you have a GUI login manager (xdm, gdm or kdm), then after your
X-server crashes (for whatever reason), it will respawn and give you the
login prompt, making it seem like you were logged out (well, I guess you
were, but not because of a set timeout).

I've given up on GUI login managers, they are a real pain if your
X-server has a problem and you just want the thing to stop all
together.  Without a GUI login manager, the X-server crash will dump you
back to the console.  The command startx is easy enough to remember, my
kids can even do it.

I don't use csh or tcsh, but "set autologout=10" should work for
example, where 10 is the number of minutes. Under the default tcsh
compilation, this variable is set to 60 minutes for all users, if you find
that annoying "autologout=0" or "unset autologout" should work.

FYI, the document below on csh drawbacks can be worth reading if you
haven't seen it before.

I've been logged in using X, and Gnome. Otherwise, bash, I assume. I
don't recall specifying during installation, but I think I remember
seeing bash somewhere in the past week or so.

Avatar:~# echo $autologout 

returns a blank line. I'm guessing that means there isn't an environment
variable, autologout.

How would I tell if a disk is being buffered in memory? How could I disable the
buffering on a disk? Does the kernel keep a list of types of files ( Linux
assumes disks are file correct? ) that it knows not to buffer, ie ramdisk?
Anyone know where that information is kept? If in the kernel source could you
tell me where? 

Thank you

If the default runlevel is set to 5 on a system, if X dies, XDM, KDM or 
whatever is being used for handling logins automatically restarts. 

XP is really something but with it rebooting when a serious error occurs 
Microsoft is able to claim no more BSODs with XP. ;)

You might leave the system on for a while, note the time it was turned 
on and log in.  Leave it running, see if when you get back it's at the 
xdm login prompt.  If so, drop to console mode and check the uptime.  If 
it's LESS than what you'd calculate it to be from your poweron time, 
then it's rebooting, not simply restarting X.

You might also check /var/log with 'ls -lt | head' to get the top 10 
most recently modified files, and start tailing them to see what's going on.

Debian only uses the first 2 run levels, any higher ones are just a
duplicate of 2.  The same principle holds though, the login manager will
respawn the X-server if it dies.

This actually started with 2k, the feature can be disabled, which is
handy for figuring out why the damn thing rebooted on its own.  I'd
rather get the BSOD than have it reboot for no apparent reason, usually
in the middle of something important, with no warning _at all_.

I better stop before I really start ranting.

While I was reading e-mail on this machine, I noticed a blink on the
screen of the Debian machine. I watched as it changed a few times and
finally settled at an X login. I went to a console, logged in and
checked uptime: 

16:52:26 up 19:59, 1 user, load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00

The uptime sounds correct. I had the machine off to install the new USB
board yesterday, plus I booted to Win98SE to install the HP 656c driver
software. So, about 20 hours ago, I booted into Linux.

ls -lt | head shows: auth.log, syslog, messages, faillog, lastlog, wtmp,
XFree86.0.log, daemon.log and the directory gdm. some of these files are
not human readable. Here are some of the other ones:

Here's tail syslog:

tail messages produces 10 lines that, with the exception of the time,
all say:

But, the lines just before that are:

The time seems a little odd, but I recall looking at the clock on the
Gnome screen after lunch and seeing a time that was morning. At that
time I ran ntpdate and the clock reset. I'm not sure what went wrong
with the time. When I log in to Windows, I have a similar utility set
the clock using utcnist.colorado.edu, or one of several others the
utility went out and found, so the clock should have been close to
correct. Anyway, that may account for some events occurring later in
time, but earlier in the log. Although, those aren't the correct "wrong"
times. Wierd.

---------------------------------

daemon.log also has some of the same messages from gdm and
gnome-name-server plus a couple of others:

So, it looks like X is restarting, and that's why I get the login
screen.
Looks like gnome, gdm and modprobe don't like something.

Do you have a screen saver running at all? I recently had a couple of X
reboots when my screen saver crashed for some reason. This may be way
off, but it's a shot.

I think Richard was suggesting to compare your xserver uptime
to your system uptime... the output above looks like system uptime, which
might not be useful by itself since it wouldn't be affected by restarting
X.

Unfortunately I don't know the canonical method for checking the uptime of
the X server... I suppose you could hunt around for X processes and check
their execution length but some processes would remain running and
some would be respawned during both a crash and a regular logout. Perhaps
the xserver or xfree86 manuals have info on where X keeps activity logs.

HTH,

Tyler

Nix that; in retrospect the uptime suggestion was just to verify the
machine wasn't rebooting. Still, if anyone knows how to determine
X server uptime it seems useful in such a context.

long day at work...

Message-ID: <20020907044223.5A840B6CB@xmxpita.excite.com>

 Hello All,

I am going through the process of setting up redhat on a box that I hope to get apache 2.0 running with a static ip to serve up some pages for fun and practice. My question is related to hostname and domain. I haven't had a lot of experience or understanding relating to these two subjects, so you may find this pretty boring. Hostname can be anything I want like web.mydomain.com? And do I have to use a domain that I registered or is this just arbitrary? I have also kind of looked ahead in trying to setup apache using virtualhost, I believe thats what I need to do, and it talks about servername. Is the servername setup with the domain name of my system or by the one I have registered? Any clarifications would be appreciated.ThxAlexDazed and Confused

1. if you want your site accessible to the Internet you need a registered 
domain name

2. You'll need to manage your DNS, most domain name registrars offer this

3. hostname and servername are the name of the server, which can be anything

4. you need virtualhost only for running more than one website

This might help get you started:

 Thx for your response Carla. Clarifying question. how do I change the hostname and domain name after installing RH?  I have a registered name, exsolv.com and I set up my host/domain name using web.mydomain.com and from what I understand from your post it should of been web.exsolv.com. thxAlex--- On Sat 09/07, Carla Schroder &lt; pluglist at bratgrrl.com &gt; wrote:From: Carla Schroder [mailto: pluglist at bratgrrl.com]To: plug at lists.pdxlinux.orgDate: Fri, 6 Sep 2002 21:53:19 -0700Subject: Re: [PLUG] newbie questionOn Friday 06 September 2002 09:42 pm, you wrote:&gt; Hello All,&gt;&gt; I am going through the process of setting up redhat on a box that I hope to&gt; get apache 2.0 running with a static ip to serve up some pages for fun and&gt; practice.

Subject: [PLUG] TeX Configuration Question
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0209062018420.26107-100000@joan.burling.com>

Has anyone here used the command ``texconfig" to make changes in
how dvi or LaTeX handles text?

The reason I ask is that I stumbled across this very useful menu-driven
command for the first time today & spent half an hour playing around
with it.  While I admit I am always learning something new with Linux,
UNIX or computers in general -- I try to learn at least one new thing
in one of these subjects every day -- I'm a little surprised that I
have been working with TeX & its friends for a couple of years now &
never knew this configuration tool existed before today.

I don't know if I missed reading a mention about it in one of the
standard references on TeX, or the documentation on this subject is
so poorly organized that it's easy to miss powerful tools like this
one. If it's the later case, I recommend anyone curious about TeX
& its friends to explore this menu-driven configuration tool. It
simplifies the matter of dealing with LaTeX & dvi settings immensely --
& comes with an embedded FAQ.

the simple answer is this, YES.  You can take out the last 3 lines and
the splash image line with no problems.  The reason it broke when you
only commented out the title is because the block that went under DOS
then came under linux, and as you said made it horibly confused.

I've never understood lilo, but never had a problem with grub.  Odd how
it seems opposit with so many people.  Anyways, have fun.

I grew up on lilo, so I usually understand it better (that should
read, lilo was confusing enough that I read the documentation, but I
didn't read it for grub).  The first thing I would change about grub
to make it easir (and for all I know you can do this already) is make
it easier to tell it the default.  The zero indexed thing gets
annoying only because I have to count them to know which number to
use.

But overall, grub is better for me.  YMMV.

 I've seen X crash every 20 minutes idle on a machine where for some
 reason DPMS made the X Server die.

Check your process table ("ps wwwauxf | less") and see if there's a
logoutd or something like that running.  Then, have a look at
"/etc/security/time.conf".  "logoutd" is part of the "login" package,
and is apparently no longer present in "unstable" for some reason.
I've never run it, by simply commenting out everything in time.conf.

I've been seeing this also on one machine, an older Pentium 200 with
an S3 Trio card (my FreekBox 2.0 testbox).  What X Server is your
machine running?  (I wonder if the bug has been reported yet or not?
We can report it to Debian with the "reportbug" program if not, and
view the list of bug reports at <URL:http://bugs.debian.org/>.)

What device is char-major-13, I wonder?  Perhaps you can configure
"modutils" (/usr/share/doc/modutils) to load it or ignore it, using an
alias directive somewhere in "/etc/modutils/*" (then run
"update-modules" to have it rebuild modules.conf)?

Knowing what that device is may provide a clue as to why the X server
crashed, perhaps?  "gdm" is restarting the X Server and that takes a
few seconds... I suspect that the second log message is from then.  X
is trying to open a device that's not there, and the kernel is trying
to autoload that module.

Ok, I looked in the kernel source "Documentation/devices.txt" file,
and found that char-major-13 (M-x search-forward-regexp for "^ +13 ")
is "input core" -- USB keyboard and mouse.  If you are not using them,
you can say "alias char-major-13 off" someplace in /etc/modutils.  If
you create a separate file to put that in, you'll save a conffile
merge on upgrade.  Don't forget to run "update-modules" (rtfm please).
That will shut up that log message... I don't think it's why your X
Server is crashing though.

The message from "gdm_slave_xioerr_handler" (Can you find it in the
gdm source in less than 5 minutes?  I can.  Want to know how?) is just
telling you that the X Server has crashed and that GDM is restarting
it.  I believe that what is happening is that there is something wrong
with the DPMS codes in that X Server (how do I find this?), and so
every 20 minutes of idle time, it will crash.  Until it is fixed, you
can put:

 /usr/bin/X11/xset -dpms

... into your "/etc/gdm/Init/Default" script as a workaround.
Hopefully that will cause it to never run the code that is crashing.

Not on a Debian GNU system.  We don't run the X display manager via
the inittab like that; it's started and stopped by a normal init.d
script, at S99 and K01.

Jeff, do you also run Debian?  If so, what X Server was running then,

"kudzu" is also available in Debian, and so is a similar tool called
"discover".  I don't know if that alone will solve your problem though.

Karl,

Yes, I am running Sid.
I was having hard X lockups every couple of days. It was even more frequent if
I played smame over X, and/or switching back and forth from X to the
console. I have since upgraded to Branden's experimental debs and have not
 had the problem since. The screen saver problem only happened a
couple of times, and has not happened again. Everything is running
smoothly now.

  Thank you, Chris, for confirming what I read -- and thought I understood.

  When I first installed RH 4.1 I was triple-booting with LILO: linux,
PC-DOS/7 and win95. I had no problems understanding LILO, swapping mbrs
between drives as the Microsoft and IBM OSes needed to be loaded, and so on.
GRUB is functionally similar, but tries too hard -- in my case -- to help.
It assumed that I want to boot DOS because it found that /dev/hda10 was
formatted vfat on a mount point called "/dos7". If it had not made that
assumption I would have been happier.

  I just have problems with machines that think they are smarter than I am.
Sometimes the machine's correct, but when it tries to be as simple as a
light switch I have major issues with it.

  Long ago I learned to never assume -- anything about anyone. I wish that
linux installers followed the same philosophy.

I presume that means that the only occurrence of logoutd was in the

This file is present, but every line in it is commented out. It
describes how to start logoutd by uncommenting and editing some of the
lines, but it looks like I'm not running logoutd.

I don't think so. I couldn't find anything in ps -ax that looked like a
screen saver. Also, I went looking for where to start one in the Gnome
menus, and didn't see anything. Did I miss something?

Subject: [PLUG] Access and Samba
Message-ID: <200209071605.g87G5Sl23987@smtp.easystreet.com>

Any brave souls out there try sharing an Access database via Samba? I have a 
client who has a large number of custom order forms (Visual basic of course) 
in Access. He is retiring his NT4 server, and replacing it with Linux. The 
Linux box will be a domain controller, file server, and email server with 
Postfix. (Firewall is a separate Snapgear box)

Someday down the road he may migrate to PostgreSQL or something similar, but 
for now it has to be Access.

As there will be no Windows server, he wants to put the Access .mdb on the 
Linux box, for the users on the Windows clients. Databases are tricky beasts, 
will it work? I'm going to try it out on my test system, if anyone has real 
experiences to share that would be very nice. I find conflicting information 
via Google, some say it can be done, some say not.

This is all that is printer-related in my smb.conf, though I believe the

My cupsd.conf is near stock, as it should listen on localhost by default.

One thing that was faily maddening was that PCL Windows drivers for the

uncommented in both /etc/cups/mime.convs and /etc/cups/mime.types.

I find that I have config-2.2.20 in /boot. I assume that I should copy
that as /usr/src/linux/.config and not as /usr/src/linux/.config-2-2-20.

However, as I sat here at my laptop composing the other e-mails I just
sent, the screen on my Debian machine (the one in question) went blank.
I suppose there must be some kind of screen saver at work. A slide of
the mouse brought the screen right back.

I don't run X from the inittab either. I only have my inittab file 
tweaked so the default runlevel is 5 which starts "kdm" on my system 
when it boots up. I have S and K symbolic links in a 
"/etc/init.d/rc5.d" directory for an "xdm" init script. 

I guess I should have been more clear in that I don't think the X 
display manager goes away when X starts and that it is responsible for 
restarting X when X dies or is killed. It is my understanding that XDM 
is usually run at runlevel 5 although this could certainly be changed 
if an Snn symbolic links is placed in a different "rcN.d" directory 
besides rc5.d.

I look forward to hearing if this works or not. I've heard of a number 
of multi-user problems with Access databases being corrupted even when 
Windows was used all around (clients and server). Heck on one contract 
I worked I had a manager that flat out refused to allow Access to be 
used on any project she was managing because she had been burned big 
time with it in other projects. 

Maybe Access has gotten better since then as this was a few years ago 
when I talked to a few people that had experienced Access database 
corruption problems in projects they were working on.

Subject: [PLUG] Network dying
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0209070936220.26748-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  As most of you know, I've been trying to move my two workstations from RH
6.2 to 7.3 for the past week+, and the process is far from done. Can't
print, haven't tried other apps for functionality, but the critical issue of
the moment is the network: RPC and nfs keep failing.

  I was trying to run a full backup of the current state of the network,
imperfect as it is, when BRU becaome comatose ("uniterruptable sleep" it's
called in ps) when it tried to access /mnt/usr2 which is nfs-exported from
machine 'caddis' and mounted on machine 'salmo'. So, I had to trace this
problem back to its source.

  Could not ping caddis: network unreachable. When I ssh'd to caddis (which
I could do), logged in and su'd to root, I discovered that bringing nfs down
failed because it was not up. Checking the monitor on that machine directly,
I saw that both RPC and nfs were returning errors. To remedy this, I
restarted portmap, network and nfs on both machines. We're up and running
again.

  The problem, and why I'm writing to all you gurus for help, is that this
is the third -- or fourth -- time this has happened in the past three days.
I had these problems when 'caddis' had RH 6.1 and 'salmo' had 5.2 installed.
Upgrading 'salmo' to 6.1 resolved that problem. But now, both boxes have 7.3
on them. I would _very_ much like to resolve this problem so I can focus on
the long list of remaining problems (such as printing).

  Both boxes have /usr/sbin/rpc.nfsd of 3804 bytes with a creation date of
April 9. One has a time stamp of 08:14, the other 11:14. I ascribe this to
time differences on these two machines. Yes, xntp is another thing to get
going.

  Thoughts, suggestions, and solutions solicited.

Thanks,

Rich

Carla,

I haven't shared one with samba, but I think it shouldn't be too hard. I 
would try just putting the db on the linux box and setting the samba 
share for the directory its in then see what happens. Or another way 
might be to set a small Fat32 partition on the linux box to hold the DB 
and sharing that. The biggest problem I could see would be if multiple 
people were accessing the db at one time. I have had problems wih 
that even on Windows platforms.


Good Luck and let us know what happens.

The source I downloaded is 2.4.18. I don't have any reference to USB in
the 13 char Input core section, just First and Second joystick, First
and Second mouse, Unified mouse, and First and Second event queue.

Well, first I have to figure out what DPMS is. It's not something man or
info or apropos know anything about. Since google is my friend, I ran
the search, dpms site:debian.org, and found way too many hits. But I
scanned the first couple of pages and found:

Re: X crashes after 20 minutes inactivity
http://lists.debian.org/debian-laptop/2002/debian-laptop-200202/msg00309.html

which says:

---------------------------

Use the following line:

Option	"DPMS" "off"
---------------------------

>From this, I conclude that DPMS has something to do with screen saving.

I also find that my Xf86config-4 file has an entry in the "Monitor"
section that says Option "DPMS".

I added "off" to that line, logged out, switched to a text console,
logged in as root, ran telinit 1, watched things stop, got the line to
enter maintenance mode or <ctrl>-D to start up normally, hit <ctrl>-D,
watched things start, found myself at the X login screen, and logged in
at 10:10 am. Now, I'll go away for 20 minutes and see what happens...

It's now 10:20, and the screen just went blank. I'm going to wait
another 10 minutes and see what else happens.

It's now 10:36. I slid the mouse and found that I was still logged in.
Maybe this fixed things. Only time will tell. I'll leave the system
logged in over lunch time and see what happens.

Just to clarify, I do not think GRUB made that assumption.  I think
RH's packaging of GRUB made that assumption.  When I installed GRUB
(both on Debian and from source) I didn't find it making any
assumptions.  I wrote the menu.lst file by hand, which wasn't too
difficult with 30 minutes of reading about how GRUB works and some
experimenting from the very handy interactive CLI that GRUB provides.
So please do _not_ fault GRUB for the sins of the packager.

Mostly because it fit the paradigm we had been working from on our old
Netware setup.

I'd like to experiment more with the "CUPS as network Postscript RIP"
model (http://us4.samba.org/samba/ftp/docs/htmldocs/cups.html), so we
could use the generic Adobe Postscript drivers everywhere. Mix that with
the [print$] driver downloading, and Windows users can just
"point-'n-print".

  Until this message, the only references to GRUB were with regard to Red
Hat. I'd no idea that this was a universal replacement for LILO. I thought
it was a Red Hat tool.

  I will note that there is a _lot_ to be desired in the 7.3 installer from
Red Hat. It wouldn't read cd's properly and we had to disconnect the SCSI
cables from the cd-rw and tape drive before it would read "official" cds I

I've done that wouldn't. Had to install fresh and I'm still wrestling with
getting the proper files from the backup tape so applications run again.
PITA. Major PITA!

I went down to fix lunch at about 11:30. It's now 12:44, and the system
is still logged in at the point I left it. The screen was blank when I
got to it, but a slide of the mouse showed that the screen had not
changed (except for the time display) since before lunch. Looks like
turning DPMS off did the trick.

Also, I finally found out what DPMS stands for. I had done a google
search, but I had limited it to the Debian domain. When I ran the search
on the whole Internet, I came up with:

http://webpages.charter.net/dperr/dpms.htm

Nice overview of Display Power Management Signaling.

I agree, this ought to be brain-dead simple. Only because I found where
the documentation for the TeX/LaTeX packages are hiding last night (hint:
try the directory described in Karl's email on your own computer), was I
able to track down the answer. Use the SIunits package thus:

\usepackage SIunits
\degree

As a note, I'm surprised that this isn't included in the better known
AMS-TeX package. That package includes symbols, glyphs & fonts for an
unbelievable amount of stuff!

I'm wondering if there isn't a bug in RedHat's packaging of NFS. I say that
because when I installed 7.2 on a machine here at home in a non-standard
way, I had to manually start, restart, & stop NFS. I haven't mentioned this
problem here or elsewhere because I wasn't sure what caused the problem --
the rpm, RedHat, or how I installed NFS. And it worked well enough for what
I wanted to do with NFS.

But since the computer I had 7.2 is now down with a dead power supply, I
can't furnish further details. Just offer this mention that you're not alone
with this problem, Rich, & maybe RH's website might have the answer.

You can also specify a config file to load from within menuconfig or
xconfig. This is handy if you have numerous config files you are rather fond
of.

Thanks. I'll keep that in mind when I start reading up on how to compile

Subject: [PLUG] Setting permissions for windows partition
Message-ID: <3D7A7A98.F655955F@attbi.com>

My Debian system is set up for dual boot, so there's a Windows 98
partition. I've included it in /etc/fstab so I can access it when
running Linux. When logged in as a user (same name and password as for
Win98) I find that the files are read only. When I su, the files become
r/w. To uncomplicate things, I thought I'd change the owner from root to
rsteff, but I find that changing the ownership of anything on the
windows partition is not permitted. Is this normal, or did I miss
something when I set up fstab?

Here's the pertinent line in /etc/fstab:

# <file system> <mount point>	<type>	<options>		<dump>	<pass>
/dev/hda1	/mnt/windows	msdos	defaults		0	2

As I re-read man fstab and man mount, I don't see any specific mention
of defaults. Do I have to specify that I want the system mounted as
read/write? Or, do I have to specifically allow user to mount the
system?

I can always get around the problem by working on those files as root,
but that seems wrong.

Thanks - that works nicely. (Though I got some weird results initially --
my font dir. was only writeable by root, and when metafont tried to
generate the new character it couldn't -- it got replaced by a strange
little glyph that looked like 'ffi' all crammed together.  Fortunately,
the error messages were descriptive enough to quickly resolve the
problem.)

  The forged message was the first thing I saw this morning when I opened

  I've sent a complaint to the real owner of the IP address block and I've

I'm sorry you got tangled up in this.  The mail you're getting that looks 
like it's from SpamCop is a forgery.  The whole thing is a hoax.  We have a 
revenge seeking spammer who is trying his best to cause trouble for us by 
causing trouble for you.  This is the third attack on us recently.  For the 
current run, the originating IP appears to be 64.70.191.50  You may be able 
to block the traffic on that basis.

SpamCop is an anti-spam reporting service that sends something like 100,000 
complaints a day to spammer hosts worldwide, which has made this particular 
spammer very angry.  However, we only send complaints about specific 
messages, not general indictments of a system, or anything like that.

Actual SpamCop complaints would come from an address like 
12345678 at reports.spamcop.net.  Each complaint has a unique numbered 
address.  Addresses such as postmaster, webmaster, hostmaster, abuse, 
support, etc are not in use on our system.  Obviously we send bounce 
notices and stuff like that, but generally not anything else.

You can see a sample SpamCop complaint 
here:  http://spamcop.net/fom-serve/cache/338.html

In theory it sounds reasonable- but this is Access we're dealing with. It's 
their customer order database, so no funky solutions permitted! 

I found there are utilities to convert .mdb to PostgreSQL and mySQL, that 
sounds way better to me. Use Access only as a front-end on the client PCs.

On the PostgreSQL lists ther have been several reports of this working
well if they haven't written the SQL too Microsofty-ish.

I've had a little dealing with sharing a database using SAMBA.  In this
case it was for MAS90 and an almost antique version of RHL (6.1) and the
then current version of SAMBA and friends.  I get reports of file
corruptions every few weeks typically a file that can be restored from a
copy they have on floppy disk.  The person that set up the system _really_
had to tweak SAMBA trying to get rid of the majo file corruption problems.
   Sine I'm a sub for support I can't get away with upgrading RHL so I 
can't say if the problems experienced have been fixed in later versions.
 

Best of luck,
Rod

Access databases should never be shared for writing.  They do not have any 
file locking to speak of.  They were designed for single user access, not 
multi-user access. It will work, but you can lose records and have 
problems with database corruption.

Samba will handle filesharing as well or better than Windows will, as long 
as you can deal with the braindead way that the Win95/98 boxes handle 
passwords.  Also, do not expect any file security if you share it and 
*never* allow access outside the firewall.  (Win 95/98 uses incredibly bad 
passwords.  It also exposes all sorts of information about the system, 
including MAC address.)

Okay, I've searched the web and found nothing. I have an Apache self-signed

Message-ID: <002801c256da$ec92d420$1600a8c0@vncvr1.wa.home.com>

Caveat : I am a computer idiot.  But I can troubleshoot the bejesus out of a T1.

Got me a Sparc 20 with no keyboard / monitor / etc.  It's got a CD-ROM.  I bought it out of the back of a van, or something.

Looking at the back on the CPU (from left to right) there's a power switch and some power connections.  A stamp of serial numbers .  

Then the top row has a blank space with a filler plate.  Next slot has what looks like a parallel port with a symbol over it that's a diamond with a line coming out of the east side (or 0 deg on a cartesian plane etc.)  Next to that is a RJ-45 plug labelled TP <...> with the dots being vertically centered.  Next slot is empty with a filler plate.

Middle row has three empty slots, one is covered with a plate and the other two are gaping dust sucking holes.

Bottom row has a funky port with pins and what look almost like small RCA connectors.  That's the video?  Labelled |O|
Next to that is a 25 pin female serial connector labelled A/B.  Next to that is a circular 8 pin female labelled | |  | |.  
2nd card slot has two female ports stacked atop each other, they're thin like USB ports but with 30 or so square holes each.  Labelled // / <...>  Next port is an RJ45 labelled <...>
Third slot looks like another parallel port and has that diamond with a line label.  Next to that are 4 headphone jack type connections.

(P.S.  Taking donations for a digital camera.)

So the real meat here : I want to console into the beast.

How do I console into it?  I got a Windows box which I figure I'll run Hyperterm or something off COM1 and hook a 9 pin female connector into the port labelled |O|O| A/1.  The other end of the cable goes into... the A/B slot on the Sparc?  Straight serial or null modem?  

I spent about an hour searching through Google newsgroups and finding conflicting or unhelpful info.

Thanks!
Todd

You will need a couple of things to get that working.

A dumb terminal with keyboard should be enough to get it bootable.  The 
serial port is a db25.  You may need a null modem box to get the dumb 
terminal to talk to the Sparc. 

As for getting past the login prompt...  There are a couple of ways to 
hack a Sparc system. The easiest is to mount the drive under a properly 
configed Linux box and edit the /etc/passwd file.

Well since fat filesystems (msdos and vfat) do not have a place in the
filesystem to store user name or id, you can't change it.  The is
however a mount option uid= and gid= which should do what you want.

Mount options for fat
       (Note: fat is not a separate filesystem, but a common part
       of the msdos, umsdos and vfat filesystems.)

...

       uid=value and gid=value
              Set the owner and group of all files. (Default: the
              uid and gid of the current process.)

Todd:

Hook up to serial A.  Try it with a ethernet cable between your windows box 
and the A port.  If that doesn't work try it with a cisco flat cable.  One of 
the two will work.

As for the password all you should need to do is to send a break to the 
console port.  When you get a ok prompt, type 

boot cdrom and install the debian-sparc cd I will bring to work on Monday....

Message-ID: <20020908045029.78302.qmail@web10803.mail.yahoo.com>

I'm a linux newbie, but not computer illiterate: i can
read the manuel and type commands on the command line.
I got & installed rh7.2 and found it had several
hundred updates and errata to apply, so i sprung for
7.3 (2.4.18-3) which then updated successfully to
18-10 via rhn. I like it.
Problem is i was stuck with "localhost.localdomain"
and wanted to change to the name of my choice. So i
read the manuels included in the boxed set, some
general off-the-shelf books and some comments in PLUG
emails, and edited /etc/host and
/etc/sysconfig/network with mc. 
But lpd will not accept the changes. (error msg
something like: "get_localhost_ip failed.") I tried 
re-configuring the printer, which did not work. I
printed the lpd man pages (all 22) which is over my
head. I can't find anything for configuring lpd. 
i'm stuck. should i use rpm to remove lpd, then rename
and then re-install lpd? My home system will not run
on a net, so do I need lpd? if not, what?

Null modem cable.  Minicom does fine or any terminal emulator you like.  You 
may need to remove the video card as Solaris will set up the serial port 
automagically if there is not video card detected.  If it sees the video card 
it will use it.  With or without a monitor hooked up.

Message-ID: <40844.209.210.31.3.1031467078.squirrel@sparky.woo-hoo.com>

When connecting to this machine via https://sparky.woo-hoo.com/webmail I
get the following annoying message:

You have attempted to establish a connection with "sparky.woo-hoo.com". 
However, the security certificate presented belongs to
"localhost.localdomain".  It is possible, though unlikely, that someone
may be trying to intercept your communication with this web site.

By clicking "ok" enough times, I finally get to the webmail service.  It
seems like a simple issue of whatever script which creates my server.key
or server.crt file carelessly uses localhost.localdomain instead of the
actual FQDN host name.

/etc/hosts looks like this:
[root at sparky root]# cat /etc/hosts
209.210.31.3	sparky.woo-hoo.com	sparky
# Do not remove the following line, or various programs
# that require network functionality will fail.
127.0.0.1	localhost.localdomain	localhost
[root at sparky root]#

I don't know exactly how to recreate the certificates, either.  According
to the mod_ssl faq, you can create a self-signed certificate but that
lasts only 30 days- great.  Other option is to pay a Certificate Authority
to certify/sign my own certificate?

Any helpful pointers would be appreciated.  I mostly want to get rid of
the annoying error message, but also would like to better understand the
signing process as well (why this 30-day limit?)

Thank you

A couple of on-line resources you may want to study so you understand just
what you have before you:

on hardware Sun no longer officially supports. It's amazing the information
they have left online -- including documentation on OpenProm.)

I don't think there's any way to do an in-place edit of a cert's 
expiration date; you'll have to make a new one.

If a SPARC's prom doesn't find a local console (i.e., there's no 
keyboard and/or framebuffer), it'll default to sending console output 
to the first serial port.

Get yourself a crossover serial cable (aka null modem) and connect a 
serial port on your PC to the back of the 20.

You can use minicom for the console sessions, but IMO conserver 
(http://www.conserver.com/) is a far better option: it'll log your 
sessions and it handles "breaks" quite well. It's simple to compile on 
any Linux host; if you've got an RPM-based system, I've written a 
.spec file you can use to build your own package:

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0209080805580.4127-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I've had no problems invoking 'startx' the past couple of days. It was
working just fine after I fixed a couple of typos in ~/.xinitrc. This
morning, however, it will neither load nor give me any reason for its (lack
of) behavior.

  When I invoke 'startx' the screen blanks for a few moments, then the
non-server, grey background with the fat 'x' appears. Period. Normally, of
course, that flashes by quickly and xfce starts. Now it hangs at that point.

  Killing the X server with ctrl-alt-bksp, I see no error messages (such as
"unexpected <whatever> at line 'x' in .xinitrc". When I view
/var/log/XFree86.log, there are no error messages there, either. I search
for "EE" and "WW" and neither is found, except at the top where they are
defined.

  This is a new one for me. I do need to fix this right away so I can
continue toward making the machines work again by tomorrow morning. But,
without error messages, how do I determine the source of the problem?
Nothing was removed since yesterday's long session so I'm completely
puzzled.

Thanks,

Rich

Try "startx 2>/tmp/xerror.log" and then look at /tmp/xerror.log to see 
if it contains any clues.

Paul,

  Unfortunately, no. It is the same as the top of /var/log/XFree86.0.log but
indicates when I killed the server:

-------------
The -bpp option is no longer supported.
	Use -depth to set the color depth, and use -fbbpp if you really

-----------------------------

  This is quite puzzling, to write the least! I did find a reference in
~/.xinitrc to $HOME/.Xmodmap, and that doesn't exist; there's a .xmodmap so
I changed .xinitrc to match. Makes no difference.

  Any ideas where to go from here?

Many thanks,

Rich

Thanks for the information.

First, I tried Keith's suggestion (modified with /mnt/windows, instead
of /mnt/hda):

> /dev/hda1   /mnt/windows   vfat  noauto,user 0 0

I umounted /mnt/windows while still su'd. Then I returned to being an
ordinary user, and successfully mounted /mnt/windows, and edited a file
in that system.

Next, after su'ing I tried changing the entry to:

/dev/hda1       /mnt/windows    vfat  
uid=rsteff,gid=rsteff                0	0

and umounted /mnt/windows.

But, when I returned to being rsteff instead of root, and tried to mount
/mnt/windows, I got the message:

mount: only root can mount dev/hda1 on /mnt/windows

So, did I misunderstandd your suggestion, or am I missing something
else?

What video card are you using?  Maybe it's only supported by XFree86
3.whatever?  I've run into several S3 cards that don't work with version
4.whatever of XFree86.  Did you install both 3.x and 4.x of XFree86?

Matt,

  As I wrote in the original message, this was working fine through
yesterday evening.

  However, I fixed the problem!! I _think_ (but I'm not certain) that it was
a wayward 'fi' at the end of ~/.xinitrc that was orphaned when I made some
changes to the file. Other users -- and root -- could log in and start X so
I knew the problem whas somewhere in my .xinitrc.

  But, ... no errors were produced. So, I sprayed Agent Orange over the
file, selectively killing things until I got the culprit. It must have been
that 'fi' 'cause it now works.

  Time for breakfast -- at last!

Thanks,

Rich

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0209081014070.5669-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I have a source rpm, libgr-2.0.13-23.src.rpm, that rebuilt and installed
just fine on one machine, but will not on the other. When I type, as root,
'rpm --rebuild ...' or just try to install the src.rpm, I'm told "... No
such file or directory." Very weird.

  The file permissions are 664, as are permissions on other rpms, and it
does not matter if the file's owner and group are root or a user. The file
is not empty.

  Also, if I try to install the source, I'm told that root cannot create the
directory, /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/. /usr/src/ exists, but is empty.

  Has anyone encountered this before? I'm curious to learn what's going on.

Thanks,

Rich

Message-ID: <EMEKKCBLKPNPHAMOKHNPAEKLCFAA.mboynay@silverliningdev.com>

I am putting together another box using RH7.3.  I downloaded the .iso from
Redhat and created the CD's to install.  In my attempt to install RH7.3 my
cd-rom doesnt want to work.  I also created a boot floppy and through the
install sequence of requesting the first disk my system again doesnt
recognize my cd-rom.  Just to narrow down the problem I took the RH7.2 I
download awhile back and it goes through the whole install process and
recognizes my cd-rom.

I have burned about 2 sets of the RH7.3 distro (I verified that there where
folders and files on the disks) and figured there is something else going on
but I dont know what I should do to correct the problem.

Your help will be greatly appreciated.

Thx

  Ah, ha! We went through the same thing here. Two sets of downloaded ISOs,
and a last-minute dash to OfficeDepot to buy and "official boxed set" and
the same problem. We also had problems with the install hanging on another
workstation when it became time to install the chkconfig package.

  We resolved it by disconnecting the SCSI buses. Then the 7.3 installer saw
the ATAPI drive for all the cdroms it needed to read. There must be a bug
with the 7.3 installer.

My RH 7.3 installer hung also. I fixed it by telling it not to write the
MBR, and instead wrote to a /boot partition. I found this "trick" from a

and this would seem to be a similar concept.  Unfortunately I failed to
swipe any of the appropriate connectors when I got laid off.  This does,
however, afford me a new opportunity to borrow things from work.  Results

Were you running sawfish as your window manager by chance? Based on your
description it sounds like sawfish loaded without gnome; if you put
/usr/bin/sawfish in your .xinitrc without anything else the same situation
should arise.

Sawfish is still functional in this stand-alone state; I think the middle
mouse button will bring up a menu.

  Nope. Don't do Gnome or KDE here, just xfce with the xfwm window manager.

  Before the Big Change here, I'd get a daily e-mail message with the
results of both /etc/cron.daily/dailyscript and /etc/cron.daily/1postfix.
Now I don't.

  These are run by crond, not by the crontab for root or a user. I assume
that the lack of mailed results is a missing MAILTO= statement somewhere,
but I don't know where.

  Can someone please point me in the right direction?

Thanks,

Well, Rich, what was the last thing you did before the X stopped working?

Did you look in ~/.xsession-errors ?

Change the above to:
/dev/hda1   /mnt/windows  vfat  user,uid=rsteff,gid=rsteff  0 0

and it should work as you expect.

Did you try "linux 1" ?  Or whatever your default kernel title is.

If you are unable to boot and edit the grub menu list, the easiest/best
way to do it is to type "e" on the line that you want to edit, and then
edit the kernel line so that it has single at the end of it.  Then you
just boot (by hitting b I think), and you should be set.

Hope this helps.

Chris,

  I recovered root's password so that crisis passed. Of course, I didn't
realize that sendmail was the default and not postfix, so after booting my
mail system was down. Only took me an hour to figure out the problem and fix
it. :-)

  So, I can edit /boot/grub/grub.conf and add the ability? I didn't see that
on the man page. Would it be something like this?

title single user
        root (hd0,1)
        kernel /vmlinuz-2.4.18-3 ro root=/dev/hda1 single

?

Thanks,

Rich

Ken,

  I tried "linux single" but not "1". I've gotta' change the title, too,
because it's "Red Hat Linux ...". Phoof!

actually you would edit you /boot/grub/menu.lst unless redhat changed it
from the default.  but other then that, that's exactly what you would
want the entry to look like.  Very useful.

side note, that's how you would add any arguments you want to pass to
the kernel, including such things as hdd=ide-scsi (for atapi emulation)

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0209081603340.4827-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I'm trying to get VMware 2.x running with the 2.4 kernel I have installed.
That's always been done by running /usr/bin/vmware-config.pl and letting it
built the modules it needs using the current headers and so on. However, ...

  It won't cooperate today. I tell it to go ahead and build what it needs
and it asks for the path to the C library header files. It offers the
default of /usr/src/linux/include/. I enter '/usr/src/linux/include/linux/'
to match where the 2.4.18 kernel untarred itself but the config script
returns an error: "The directory does not contain 'net', 'linux', or 'asm'
as expected". Those subdirectories are under the path I presented.

  Has anyone encountered this problem before? I've tried making soft links
and doing other manipulations, but to no avail.

Thanks,

Rich

Chris,

  It's just a link:

[root at salmo ~]# ls -l /boot/grub/menu.lst

Subject: [PLUG] Smart Media Readers
Message-ID: <3D7BDF94.72948E17@attbi.com>

Any recommendations on smart media readers? I've got a digital camera
that uses up to 64 Mb smart media widgets. The software that comes with
the Polaroid camera is only for Windows, but the files on the card are
.jpg's so I should be able to just copy them off the card and use The
GIMP on them.

I looked at Pacific Solutions when I was there getting my new keyboard,
but what they had was a combo unit that handled other things besides
smart media, and it was kind of expensive, ($79 IIRC). The nice lady at
Pacific Solutions recommended Camera World. I stopped in at Kits in
Clackamas Promenade (They were listed in the Camera World ad it today's
Oregonian, so I'm assuming they're related). They had one unit for $29,
but a return policy that was good only if the package wasn't opened! So,
I'll hold off until I hear from the list about which ones work with
Linux.

BTW, I remember this came up sometime in the last year. Is there a
search mechanism for the new mailing list archives, or does one have to
download each month and grep it?

Subject: [PLUG] USB
Message-ID: <3D7BEE99.1C4BA574@attbi.com>

Is there a utility to test for the presence of USB adapters? I installed
Debian with the motherboard USB ports enabled. They turn out to be less
than reliable. I've had an IBM USB video camera work on one in Windows,
but I didn't get my HP 656c working on it. I disabled the motherboard
USB ports and installed a USB2 card. I successfully installed the HP
656c driver in Windows, so I know the hardware works.

I've been putzing with CUPS and hpijs. The last time I tried this was on
my laptop. When I did that, there was an entry in the Device section of
the CUPS web based tool for adding printers that got there after
successfully installing hpijs. I successfully installed hpijs on the
Debian machine, but when I try installing the printer, I don't have the
hpijs specific USB device listed. If I choose "USB Printer #1" and
either HP DeskJet Series CUPS v1.1 (en) or HP New DeskJet Series CUPS
v1.1 (en), I get the error message "Unable to open USB port device file
"/dev/usb/lp0": No such device"

I looked in /dev/usb and found a large list, which includes lp0. But,
there are a lot of things on that list that I don't have, like 16 mice,
16 scanners, 16 lps, 16 ezs (what's an ez?), and a rio500. So, I assume
that those are standard entries in /dev/usb, and are some kind of place
holders. 

I've tried reading the documentation in
/usr/src/kernel-source-2.4.18/Documentation/usb. In the file
proc_usb_info.txt, it talks about /proc/bus/usb. I have only a
/proc/bus/pci.

Sometime last week, I downloaded the 2.4.18 kernel and ran into space
problems, so didn't recompile. Now that I've successfully repartitioned
the drive, and have enough room, I guess I should recompile the kernel.
Could that be why I don't see the USB card or the printer attached (and
powered up) to it?

Hmmm... on my (admittedly ancient, non-RH) system, I've got:
>$ ls /usr/src/linux/include
asm        asm-generic  asm-mips  asm-sparc    linux     scsi
asm-alpha  asm-i386     asm-ppc   asm-sparc64  math-emu  video
asm-arm    asm-m68k     asm-s390  config       net

so net, asm, and linux are at this level, not at
/usr/src/linux/include/linux.

Is this output from the perl install script?  Is the -w option on? (First
line should look something like #!/usr/bin/perl -w)
It might be helpful to hack the install script to get more diagnostic
info.  I'd be willing to take a stab at it...

  I mistyped, David. That's where they are on my system, too, but this is
what I see when I run /usr/bin/vmware-config.pl:

Trying to find a suitable vmmon module for your running kernel.

None of VMware's pre-built vmmon modules is suitable for your running kernel. Do
you want this script to try to build the vmmon module for your system (you need 
to have a C compiler installed on your system)? [yes] yes

What is the location of the directory of C header files that match your running 
kernel? [/usr/src/linux/include] (I pressed [Enter] here.)

The path "/usr/src/linux/include" is an existing directory, but it does not 
contain at least one of these directories "linux", "asm", "net" as expected.

What is the location of the directory of C header files that match your
running kernel? [/usr/src/linux/include] 

and, /usr/src/linux/include has:

You need the USB Proc Filesystem support compiled in to your kernel for
a /proc/bus/usb to appear.  I don't know if it appears there, however,
without a USB controller module loaded up.

Did you build the kernel yourself?  If so, did you include USB Proc
Filesystem support?  If not, I'm pretty sure that one requires a
recompile and reboot.

lspci should tell you what kind of USB controller you have (OHCI, UHCI,
or whatever the USB2.0 one is named) from which you should be able to
load the proper module... then look in /proc/bus/ and see if there's a
usb entry.  If not, you don't have USB Proc support and will either have
to guess (live without it) or rebuild your kernel.

Perhaps a debian guru will have better answers for you... but I'll bet
you missed USB Proc support (I know I did).  :-)

I bought one back in January, it was a store brand CompUSA combination

Was about $29, IIRC.

Well, I know precisely squat about VMware, so the only thing that I
personally can suggest is to examine the perl script to see why it can't
find the directories it needs.  As I said, I can take a look at it and
see if I can make it produce more useful output.

One word of caution -- I had to add "oplocks=no" to a SAMBA share
holding a QuickBooks Pro 2000 shared data file.  Like Access, it
stores data in a single file, and then allows multiple users to open
it and modify different areas of the file.

I don't remember all the details ... just that I had to search
Google for a few hours to make some Samba error messages (and
QuickBooks problems) go away.

I don't know if Access uses the "opportunistic locks".

This can be done via /etc/aliases if you want the system admin
to handle the job.  Or it can be done in the $HOME/.forward file
for a particular user if the user is self-sufficient.

1) In your /etc/aliases file, create a new line with the
    username in the first column, and the address to forward
    in the second column (whitepace separates columns)

     username   new at address.out

    You might need to run (as 'root') the "newaliases" command to
    rebuild the aliases database.


2) In the $HOME/.forward file, just put the new address (and
    nothing else).

Doh!  spaced the colon character.  You can also read "man aliases"

I've started using $HOME/.procmailrc instead when I set up
forwarding for a user. It has the benefit of doing the forwarding
*after* the incoming message has been processed by delivery agent
spam filter (procmail in my case). With /etc/aliases or $HOME/.forward,
the messages zips right back out again without ever being processed
by the local delivery agent. (DNS blacklists and other pre-delivery
filtering gets used either way.) A simple forwarding-only
$HOME/.procmailrc looks like this:

	:0
	! user at some-domain.com

No. This is an over-the-network installation of Debian stable. I don't
recall answering any USB questions during the install, although I might
have. But, even if I did, the old motherboard USB was probably USB 1.0,
and the new card is USB 2.0, so it probably wouldn't have mattered,
anyway.

I downloaded the kernel source last week, and discovered that I didn't
have space to unzip and untar it. That's when I figured out how to use
parted. Looks like that's tomorrow's adventure -- learning how to build
a kernel. From everything I've read here on the list, it's not hard, but
there are important things to know before diving in. But, that's what
the documentation is for, right?

lspci (there's another utility I just learned about!) tells me that I
have three USB Controllers.

00:09.0 USB Controller: NEC Corporation USB (rev 41)
00:09.1 USB Controller: NEC Corporation USB (rev 41)
00:09.2 USB COntroller: NEC Corporation: Unknown device 00e0 (rev 02)

I could interpret this at least two different ways, based on my limited
understanding. In one of those ways, the first two are the original,
motherboard USB ports, and the third one is the new card. In another
interpretation, all three are the new card, but something isn't right.
The new card has 4 ports on it. When I ran the installation for Win98SE
(dual boot machine), the installation wizard specifically mentions "NEC
Open Host Controller." So, I'm assuming that the chip comes from NEC. I
don't know if the chip on the motherboard is from NEC or not. The
motherboard is from Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS], and lspci shows
their name on the first five lines plus the last line of its output, the
Host Bridge, IDE interface, ISA bride, Class ff00 ACPI, PCI bridge, and
VGA compatible controller. In between are a Ethernet controller from
Davicom, and a Multimedia audio controller and a Communication
controller, both from C-Media Electronics Inc.

I don't get from any of that what the proper module for the USB 2 card
should be, though.

Thanks for putting me on the track.

Thanks, I'll look into that, but I guess I should wait until I've made
sure I've got USB support working!

I don't know about Russell's, but mine is whatever the Debian stable

Compiled from source, 2.4.x, currently 2.4.18 at home.  You need to
compile in the USB_STORAGE stuff and SCSI disk support, because
you mount it as a scsi device.  E.g., I say:

  mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt

to get access to the image files on the SmartMedia.

Looking at my kernel configuration, I have: "Support for USB", "UHCI
(Intel PIIX4, VIA, ...) support", "Microtech CompactFlash/SmartMedia
support" and "SanDisk SDDR-09 (and other SmartMedia) support" turned
on.  The last two were just guesses, I am not sure which (if either!)
is used for my particular hardware... but it does work!  ;-)

My /etc/crontab has the entry "MAILTO=root" by default.  Both on RH

Use the backslash (\) to escape your own, local, account name.

for /etc/aliases:

  Everyone here's been great as I've moved from RH 6.2 to 7.3. Of course,
the debianites keep reminding me that they're still present, but that's OK.
:-)

  So, after a weekend of requesting advice and help (that didn't include the
mail and X problems I fixed all by myself), I want to report progress. CUPS
is now working again -- at least, from the one workstation. I think that I
need to install the upgrade patch on the other box to make it work, too.

  One down and two to go. Still must get VMware-2.x running on the 2.4.18
kernel and WP/8 finding the libm.so.5 that's installed. Then I'll do the
kernel upgrade to 2.4.19.

For full control over those network issues you'll need to edit:

	/etc/hosts
	/etc/resolv.conf
	/etc/sysconfig/network

Or use a tool like linuxconf or webmin.  You can also browse the utilities
and system menus and look for something like network.  For instance in a KDE
system you could click on the K logo -> system -> network configuration.

Keep in mind that even after making those changes if DNS does not list
web.exsolv.com the world won't be able to find your webserver.

Rich,

An alternative solution would be to change /etc/aliases or
/etc/postfix/aliases (IIRC you're using postfix) and have mail for root sent
to you.  That way you won't need to change the config of every utility that
mails status reports/errors/whatever to root.  

FWIW, this approach is strongly suggested by postfix itself as shown through
these comments from the default postfix aliases file:


# Person who should get root's mail.  This alias
# must exist.
# CHANGE THIS LINE to an account of a HUMAN
root:           admin_group at localhost

Simple question I've seen answered before (in a variety of ways) but 
can't think of how now that I need it.

I have a list of strings like this:

a
a
a
b
b
c
d
d
d
d

I'd like to produce a report that counts how many of each unique string 
there are, something like this:

a 3
b 2
c 1
d 4

I don't care a lot about the format. It could be in any order, the count 
could come first or second, whatever.

I know there's some easy bash way to do this, which eludes me now.

Paul,

  Yes. I'm working from memory here so it may not be totally correct, but
the idea is to go into File > Templates then work your way to the default
letter/page template. Make your changes there and save the template.

  Thanks, Michael. That's been the case here:

# Person who should get root's mail. This alias must exist. CHANGE THIS
# LINE to an account of a HUMAN
root:           rshepard

# Note to the user: You must create the alias above! The root alias *must*
# exist under postfix because postfix runs as a non-privileged user and
# cannot touch a spool file which is UID/GID root The mapping to the postfix
# user is to ensure that root's mail doesn't get lost on a system installed

Perhaps if you convert 1 inch to 25.4mm it would work better? :)

But the solution you seem to be looking for is the menu chain of: 
  Tools -> Options -> Text Documents -> General -> Measurement Unit   
where you have a choice of centimeter, millimeter, inch, pica or point.

As soon as you click OK the change is applied.

It is simple (if you look in the right place).  Neither _The Joy of TeX_
(definitive book on AMS TeX) nor Lamport's LaTeX book (definitive book
on LaTaX) have it in the index, though  each defines the `\deg' operator,
which is something else.

However, Donald Knuth's _The TeX Book_, the definitive book for EVERYTHING
related to TeX, has it.  And it is easy.

Basic TeX defines the `\circ' symbol which is a little open circle typically
used in mathematics for the "composition" operator between functions.

To get the standard degree symbol, simply use \circ as an exponent:

37? C would be (in TeX) `$37^\circ$ C

No need for any special AMS TeX or LaTeX symbols.  It's been there since
TeX was first invented.

Are you specifing the "-print" argument when you run "find"?

Something like:

Subject: [PLUG] CUPS: configuring client workstation
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0209091028001.20429-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  It's been two years since I replaced lpr with CUPS and I cannot find just
how I configured the networked client to recognize the remote print server
and send jobs to it. I hope that someone here will help.

  Easy Software's news server shows no groups so I cannot ask for help there.
And their support is now focused on the enterprise and I don't want to pay
$250 to get this information.

  CUPS is installed on that workstation and the process is running. In
/etc/cups/client.conf I tell it that the server is salmo.appl-ecosys.com and
to use encryption only if requested. In /etc/printcap are the two lines:

color:
laser5:

as these are the CUPS names for the printers that are directly attached to
the print server, across the network. Both these files exist on the print
server, too.

  I don't have printpro installed on the client. Should I? There is no
/usr/sbin/printers that would permit users to select the printer to use for
a job. The documentation suggests that if /etc/cups/client.conf exists the
software will automagically configure itself and work. It isn't.

  I've read the SAM (Software Administrators Manaual) without finding
anything I didn't report above. I'm not sure where else I might find the
information I need.

Thanks,

Rich

Try these instruction, they are geared toward ipsec, but seem to be

Have you tried making a symlink from asm to the asm- that is appropriate
for your arcitecture (or just to the asm-generic)?  The error message is
acting like it needs to find all three directories.

Good luck

I know that win9x/NT are supposed to be booted off /dev/hda, but has
anyone here been able to get them to boot from /dev/hdb?  I would like
to move my win98 partition to /dev/hdb1 (it is /dev/hda3 now) and then
upgrade it to win2k.  So far, I have been unable to make win98 boot
from /dev/hdb1.  Here are some of the things I have tried:

1. Telling GRUB to swap /dev/hda1 and /dev/hdb1 so that windows would
   think it is on the first partition of the first hard drive.  All I
   get is funny characters when I try to boot.

2. Setting my bios to boot from /dev/hdb1, with and without option [1]
   at the same time.  Same results as [1].

3. Putting in the win98 CD and booting from that.

I don't think it is a problem with the boot loader.  After I moved the
data to a new partition I did option [1] and then did fdisk /mbr.

Anyone know of a bootloader that can be used in place of the windows
boot loader?

What about win2k, I'm having trouble finding information that is
specfic to win2k.  Or is all of this just an exercise is futility and
I should give up, and put the data back on to /dev/hda?

Thanks,
Jason

Jason,

  Did you use the chainloader phrase in /boot/grub/grub.conf? There was
similar magic in LILO that made the Microsoft loaders think they were where
they wanted to be.

I believe this is what I was using, but I don't have it infront of me.

title Windows98
      map (hd0,0) (hd1,0)
      map (hd1,0) (hd0,0)
      chainloader +1

The only part I'm not sure about is if it was just chainloader +1 or
chainloader (hd1,0)+1.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0209091344010.20579-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  Now for something completely different: an rpm question.

  I have libraries installed, but they did not come from packages. When I
try to run 'apt-get ...' it fails because it found unsatisfied dependencies
for jpilot and xfce. The dependencies are there, of course, but the rpm
database doesn't see them.

  Is there a way to get the database to accept that these libraries exist
and are valid?

Thanks,

Jason,

  I thought it was the former. But, I erased the lines from the DOS
partition in my copy and I don't find it in 'info grub'.

Mine looks like the for Win2000, FWIW:

         rootnoverify (hd0,0)
         chainloader +1

Fool around w/ the rootnoverify thing as necessary.

Now that you mention it I think I did play with that option.  I think
the bottom line may be that windows has to be on the first hard drive
to be bootable.

Does anyone know if it is true in 2k?  I'm sure it is, but maybe....

Thanks,
Jason

I've seen both chainloader (device)+1 and chainloader +1.  You can
setup your system for booting the win98 floppy so that it won't kill
your mbr by using the maps and then

chainloader (fd0)+1

I tried it with my win98 cd but grub just complains that the selected
device couldn't be found or something.

I tried to edit the map file and I put
(hd2) /dev/hdc

but I think I have to use
(hd2) /dev/scd0

since I'm using ide-scsi on that drive.  I should probably read more
grub documentation.  And also accept that windows really dosen't want
to be on a secondary HD.


Thanks, for all your help,
Jason

Derek,

  Thanks for the idea. I looked at the source code and it definitely calls
for 'or', but seems to want either 'and' or only the 'asm'. I made the link
as you suggested and that got me to the next sticking point:
/usr/include/linux/version.h. That shows a 2.4.9-9 kernel! So, now I build
the 2.4.19 kernel, install and test it (on both machines) then get back
to the vmware-config script.

Excelsior!

My page still defaults to A4. I need to change the document and the printer setting to avoid the dreaded "Red Light" and "Page size" error.

Don't give up so easily.  I think I had something like that working

  Yes, that's necessary for those OSes not in the GRUB database. I recall

I found running 'spadmin' to be very useful.  Using the "generic 
printer" definition,
we'd get a bunch of Postscript errors.  After using 'spadmin' to 
properly configure
our Lexmark printer, all the Postscript errors went away, the paper size 
and tray
defaults, and duplexing config have been working like a charm.  (For new 
docs, that
is, old docs retained the settings used when they were last saved.)

Well the RPM-only world would have you add the "--nodeps" option to 
rpm(8) to
bypass the dependency check during installation.

Paul Heinlein recently posted this beauty of a work-around on the RPM 
list ...
  
https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/private/rpm-list/2002-September/016348.html

It outlines how to create a "virtual" RPM package, where the RPM doesn't 
contain
any actual files, but uses the SPEC file "%Provides" directive to load 
the RPM database
with entries which will satisfy those dependency checks.

Don,

  I use the "--nodeps" option to install packages when the dependencies are
really there. But, "apt-get" is digging in its feet and refusing to go out
to the repositories and get the files because of the apparent unfulfilled
dependencies. _That's_ the problem I'm trying to solve.

  I'll give this a shot. Thanks very much.

Can you use aptitude?  apt-get install aptitude...I believe there is
an option in aptitude for overriding the dependencies.  The other
thing you could try is going to debians site, downloading the package,
installing it with dpkg (I hope they included that) then you can mark
the package to not be automatically upgraded by apt.  But I don't
remember how to do the last part.

I haven't been reading the whole thread so I apologize if you already
tried this and it didn't work.

HTH,
Jason

  You don't do anything with /mtab. For /etc/fstab, try something like this:

/dev/hdb              /win98                   vfat    defaults        0 0

I think that would depend on how you compiled your kernel. If you 
compile your kernel so that many of the features are in modules you do 
tend to end up with a smaller kernel. 

Make sure you do a: "make modules modules_install" So your modules are 
compiled and in place for your new kernel.

My understanding of kernel image naming it that it can be whatever you 
want just as long as everything that references it uses that same name.  
The grub entry, the link /boot/vmlinuz, and others.  I don't think the 
name is used for kernel version identification as that comes from the 
kernel itself.

Theoretically you could have "Richs-happy-linux-kernel" for a file name.

Tony,

  Is is modular. When I looked more closely I saw this:

-rw-r--r--    1 root     root       804587 Aug  7 10:02 vmlinuz-2.4.18-10BOOT
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root      1030147 Apr 18 07:45 vmlinuz-2.4.18-3
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root      1167673 Sep  9 16:01 vmlinuz-2.4.19

  Apparently, bzImage was copied to vmlinuz-2.4.19 for me.
 
> Make sure you do a: "make modules modules_install" So your modules are

  Yup. Did these, too. However, there's no module-info for the new kernel.
This is what I have in /boot:

boot.b                    kernel.h                  System.map-2.4.18-3
bzImage                   lost+found/               System.map-2.4.19
chain.b                   message                   vmlinux-2.4.18-10BOOT*
config-2.4.18-10BOOT      module-info@              vmlinux-2.4.18-3*
config-2.4.18-3           module-info-2.4.18-3      vmlinuz@
grub/                     os2_d.b                   vmlinuz-2.4.18-10BOOT
initrd-2.4.18-10BOOT.img  System.map@               vmlinuz-2.4.18-3
initrd-2.4.18-3.img       System.map-2.4.18-10BOOT  vmlinuz-2.4.19

  The module-info link points to the 2.4.18-3 file (there's no module-info
for the 2.4.18-10 kernel, either. System.map points to System.map-2.4.19.

  After what I've gone through the past couple of weeks, I want to be
certain of what I'm doing before I get into deep trouble. :-) Ergo, my
hesitation when I'd charge ahead in the past.

  Also, here's how I set up /boot/grub/grub.conf (a.k.a.
/boot/grub/menu.lst):

# grub.conf generated by anaconda
#
# Note that you do not have to rerun grub after making changes to this file
# NOTICE:  You have a /boot partition.  This means that
#          all kernel and initrd paths are relative to /boot/, eg.
#          root (hd0,1)
#          kernel /vmlinuz-version ro root=/dev/hda1
#          initrd /initrd-version.img
#boot=/dev/hda
default=2
timeout=10
fallback=1
title linux (2.4.19)
	root (hd0,1)
	kernel /vmlinuz-2.4.19 ro root=/dev/hda1
title linux-old (2.4.18-10BOOT)
	root (hd0,1)
	kernel /vmlinuz-2.4.18-10BOOT ro root=/dev/hda1
	initrd /initrd-2.4.18-10BOOT.img
title linux single (2.4.18-10BOOT)
	root (hd0,1)
	kernel /vmlinuz-2.4.18-10BOOT ro root=/dev/hda1 single
	initrd /initrd-2.4.18-10BOOT.img
title linux (2.4.18-3)
	root (hd0,1)
	kernel /vmlinuz-2.4.18-3 ro root=/dev/hda1
	initrd /initrd-2.4.18-3.img

  I _think_ the ''fallback'' phrase is in the right place. Once I know it's
working properly I'll change the linux single to the 2.4.19 kernel.

Thanks,

Rich

  I believe that you're correct, Keith.

  The link, vmliuuz, points to vmlinuz-2.4.19, but with earlier kernels,
I've seen vmlinux (with an 'x') linked to a vmlinuz (with a 'z') file.

  Sure. And I'd type that in a couple of seconds, too.

All,

I'm using proftpd and I'm trying to have multiple domains on the same IP
and have proftpd handle the virtual hosting.  It appears that when I
connect to the second domain name it resolves the IP and then when it goes
back tries to log into the first domain.
Is it possible to do name based FTP virtual hosting with proftpd?  Or with
FTP in general?
If not, do I have to run the second domain names on a different IP then
route the request in iptables?
Thanks.

Message-ID: <3D7D37A7.A682CF5E@attbi.com>

I guess I didn't have the right directions:

http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-formats/html_single/Kernel-HOWTO.html#ss1.1

or didn't follow them. Here's what I did:

Unpacked the 2.4.18 kernel in /usr/src/
made a link to it called linux
Copied /boot/config-2.2.20 to /usr/src/linux/.config
cd linux
make menuconfig
	I looked at a number of things, but didn't change anything, and saved
before leaving.
make dep
make clean
nohup make bzImage &
tail -f nohup.out
	I watched this until it stopped
make modules
make modules_install

I copied bzImage to /boot/bzImage/myker.20020909.1600, and added this to
lilo.conf:

# kernel compiled on September 9, 2002
#
image=/boot/bzImage.myker.20020909.1600
	label=myker
	root=/dev/hda2
	read-only

Then, I ran lilo and lilo -q and re-booted. Now, when I select myker
from lilo's menu, the system starts to load, but evenutally bogs down
with a lot of this message:

modprobe: modprobe: Can't locate module net-pf-1

As promised, I can continue to boot to the old kernel, and things appear
to work fine. Is there another set of instructions I should have been
following? What did I miss?

Thanks in advance.

Just cd to /var/cache/apt/archives and jam the RPm manually, rpm -Uvh

I should also note that you may be able to get RPMs for your libraries. I
don' t know about xfce but I have jpilot fully under apt-get's control,

I'm sharing a 30 meg complex database and a few smaller, nearly flat ones on a RedHat server with samba. Multiple clients use the database at the same time. Been doing it for about two years. It works great, no losses no reboots like the (old) weekly Novell reboots. The customer was stunned when I told him it had been 500 days since he'd had a server re-boot. I've made sym links for the database and the system.mdw for each of the eight or so users.

I'll be glad to share the details with anyone interested. We haven't lost anything that wasn't related to a Win crash during data entry. That's happened a few times...

  New kernel (2.4.19) booted just fine. Then I tried rebuilding the VMware
modules for this kernel.

  Came up with warnings that malloc.h has been deprecated (!) and slab.h
should be used instead. That didn't seem to bother the script. But, in the
latest version of driver.c, the function 'LinuxDriver_Ioctl' has no member

buy an upgrade just to run with this kernel.

Upgrading is worthwhile, IMHO, for the seat of the pants feeling of
snappiness improvement.

I much prefer the more recent VMware over the older version which I had been
using.

I can't imagine this working with no changes, you are using an old
kernel configuration for a new kernel, there will be some significant
differences.

Looks like the configuration didn't work, was the option for loadable
modules set?

To really make a fresh kernel work well, I recommend looking very
closely at the boot message (using the working kernel), your motherboard
manual, and the output of:

# lsmod

Use this information to create your own configuration file from scratch
(delete the current one, and the make menuconfig should create a new one
for you).  To absolutely guarantee that you can still boot your system,
I also recommend that you make a boot floppy, I think the command it
mkboot (try man mkboot). 


HTH, let us know if you need more information.

Ryan,

  Interesting. The only apps I run in the virtual-win98 (which has speed
improvements over the virtual-win95 I ran for a few years) are the GPS
software and an old copy (1998 was when I stopped upgrading) of MapInfo.

  I've no need for USB, W2K, XP or other support and I run these apps only
occaionally. Actually, if they're slow I just shrink the window and go do
something else. :-)

  But, I may have to spend the money. I didn't last spring when they had all
the discounts; may cost me more now.

Thanks,

Rich

Use "apt-get source gdm" (as a non-root user) to get a copy of the GDM
source code.  As root, run "apt-get install cscope xemacs21", unless
those are already installed.  Now visit the GDM source directory by
using "C-x C-f" or the toolbar, and finding that directory.  Either use
the Cscope menu and pick "Create list and index", or use the "C-c s I"
command to do it.  Push enter when the dialog or minibuffer is pointing
at the toplevel directory of gdm's sources, and let it build an index.

Now either use the Cscope menu to choose "Find global definition" or use
the command key listed in the menu to do so, and search for
"gdm_slave_xioerr_handler".  I think that you'll have it in front of you
in less than five minutes, not counting the time to install XEmacs and
Cscope.

Robbert,

  What I've done, with WP as well as OO is print the file to disk using a
PostScript printer driver. Then I run the .ps file through ps2pdf. As long
as you have ghostscript > 6.0 it'll work like a charm. One of the major
efforts of the Alladin development team in the production of the 6.0 version
was this module.

This I have been doing, but I like to make things as simple as possible,
the fewer the steps the better.  I've seen some documents stating this
is a known problem, but have not seen any solutions. Perhaps with the
next release this might be fixed (assuming the developers feel this is a
bug that needs immediate attention).

Thank you very much for the link.  Have been able to use those
instructions to create a new newcert.pem and newreq.pem files.  Am I
supposed to then tell apache to use them in place of
/etc/httpd/conf/ssl.crt/server.crt and /etc/httpd/conf/ssl.key/server.key
respectively?  I have tried that approach and get an error that the
certificate is corrupted.  Is there some additional steps I am missing?

Thank you again

Oh how I HATE (HATE HATE HATE) fonts!

I've just read most all of the Font HOWTO and the Font DeUglification 
mini-Howto.

I've followed the TTF installation instructions in the latter document
to the letter (as far as I know).  I restart xfs, do `xset fp rehash'
(which I got from the former doc---may not be needed) and bring
up "gfontsel".

I see the names of the M$ TTF fonts.  For example, there's Tahoma and
"trebuchet ms" and "ms outhouse" (I mean "outlook").

But when I click on any of them (say Tahoma) I get

"The selected font is not available"

in the window where the font should display.

Various font sizes show up in "Size" column and various styles in the
"Font Style" column, but no fonts are displayed.

Clicking on the "Font Information" tab the "actual value" column
is all "unknown".

These fonts come off an exisiting M$ Windows 98 ME installation (my
win4lin installation).  I've down-cased the names as instructed.  in
the mini-howto.  I've populated fonts.scale and fonts.dir with the
appropriate commands.

I've even deleted everything and tried to let drakeconf do the
job (I'm running Mdk 8.2 which has a drakconf --> fonts capable
of doing this.)  Always I get the same message.

Can anyone help.  I've wasted too much time on this!

Thanks.

Follow the thread started by Jason Dagit above ("Dual booting"), then swap
harddrives so win98 is on hda to save trouble ;)

(to my knowledge you can not boot Win98 from any drive that is preceded by a
non-fat filesystem. In most cases this means only hda1 will boot win98. I
would love to be proven wrong however.)

first guess: are the font files and the font dir readable by

It sounds like you've tried everything I would, but just in case 
there's a detail missing, here's what has worked for me (Red 
Hat 7.x, XFree86 4.x):

* copy .ttf files into /usr/share/fonts/default/TrueType

* cd into that directory and do

  /usr/bin/ttmkfdir -o fonts.scale
  /bin/cp fonts.scale fonts.dir

* restart xfs

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0209100611100.5666-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I've a few things to fix but haven't discovered on my own how to do this.

  Just noticed that despite telling the RH installer that we're in the
Pacific Time Zone, a message I just sent to another mail list showed up with
the proper PDT time, but marked as -4 hours from UTC rather than -7.
Searching for "timezone" found only the tzset function. How do I change the
reported timezone to the proper one?

  I'm still not receiving the mailed reports from two cron.daily scripts,
reports that used to appear in my inbox every morning. One is the
dailyscript report on system status and changes, the other is the 1postfix
summary of activities from /var/log/maillog. /etc/crontab has a line
"MAILTO=rshepard" but that doesn't seem to help.

  When exiting message composition in pine (I use joe as the editor), my
fingers sometimes move too quickly on the exit-editor/send-message sequence
of keys and I hit a combination (I don't know just which keys) that puts
pine into the background, but not from a virtual console. The resulting
message from pine is to issue the "fg" command, but it doesn't tell me from
where to issue it. I've read the man page for pine and I've experimented but
without success. The newly composed message is lost. I would really like to
learn how to bring pine back from its background position without killing
the processes.

  I'm sure there will be other little administrative issues cropping up that
I've not dealt with before, but the transition of both workstations is
almost fully complete. I tried to order a VMware upgrade online last
evening, but never received confirmation after entering all the billing
information so I'll get that resolved today. WordPerfect can wait a day or
two. xntp is running, but not working properly; so is squid. I need to get
these two utilities doing their jobs.

  It's been quite a learning experience and I thank all of you, but
especially Cooper, for all the help.

You just have to add a pdf converter, and OO will ask you for an output 
directory. Choose the pdf converter when select printer at the OO 
writer. Don't choose print as file, it will automatically place the pdf 
file into your previous selected directory.

The convention of Linux kernel images does nothing to the actual usage. 
However, in general it has the following convention. vmlinuz usually 
stands for compressed image and vmlinux is a normal uncompressed kernel 
image and you can notice the sizes. You can use "nm vmlinux" to view all 
the kernel symbols if you want to because it is a normal elf binary.

Check out my reply to this same question four days ago:

http://lists.pdxlinux.org/pipermail/plug/2002-September/008972.html

The short answer:

Yes, you can use 2.4.x, but you'll need to patch the VMWare modules.

Name based virtual hosting only exists in http 1.1 protocol where the 
client sends also the requesting server name to the server (for example 
Apache). Then Apache based on the client's request to resolve to the 
correct document. Ftp is a simple file transfer protocol and does not 
have this feature. This is due to a limitation of the ftp protocol. You 
should try to use Apache with http protocol with directory listing 
enabled to simlulate a virtual hosts ftp site for anonymous users. Don't 
try to rely on virtual hosts for access control since it doesn't really 
give any security between virtual hosts, and you are trusting the 
client's browser who sends a correct HTTP 1.1 request to your server.

It seems you are installing packages that is not for your distribution. 
When specifying dependency in rpm packages, you can specify the package 
name and version or just a file name. Packagers specifies filenames are 
tend to make the package work on different distributions because package 
names doesn't really tells you the actual files locate in your system, 
different distros tends to have different packaging conventions even the 
name is the same or even using a different package name for the same 
package. You can try to force the installation by specifying the 
"--nodeps" means no dependency to force installing a package ignoring 
dependency. But if you failed to provide the correct shared library, 
your app is likely to fail in run time. You can check the file list by 
"rpm -ql [packagename]" and check the required library by typing "ldd 
[executablefile]" to check the library existence. If libraries are 
missing you cannot run. try to make symlinks to the same existed library 
file with the latest version and after type "ldconfig" to regen the 
/etc/ld.so.cache file. My experience is it may work , but sometimes will 
fail with an incorrect version of library. You really need the correct 
library file if none of them exists or it fails.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0209100737140.18495-100000@glenfiddich.cse.ogi.edu>

At work, we're considering using GUIDs to serve as dumb keys in an 
LDAP database, the idea being that we can guarantee a unique 
distinguishing name, e.g.,

  dn: dumbID=b1d10bc9-f0a0-4c94-a1b2-9bb01d1c77ee, dc=work, dc=com

My question has to do with GUID formation or something like that.

First, I generated a set of 20 GUIDs with the uuidgen tool that comes
with the e2fsprogs package:

  [heinlein]$ for f in $(seq 1 20); do uuidgen -r; done
  c6e59b9e-d780-40a5-90be-e0c8ade715ab

  9e53d9e4-70a0-4feb-9f16-96e763704b10

Then I generated a smaller set of GUIDs using a freeware Windows 
generator (running on a different host than the one used to generate 
the first list):

  {959D7D7E-4AEB-42EA-A5DD-FB7F05781517}
  {4422A4CF-93CE-4439-A208-4A77482DF353}
  {6E54E357-85D9-436A-A6B2-B12AA8AB95AD}
  {3C3400BE-6726-4F24-8BB8-8E88861DFF45}
  {FC2B0CB8-E06E-4BAB-8777-2CF12DACE03F}
  {7030A7FD-31FB-476C-91E4-E0299179BFC8}

Note that, regardless of the generator used, the first character of
the third byte set is always '4.' Anyone know if that's worrisome or
not?

Usually, I'll configure the kernel, then - all in ONE line:

make dep modules bzImage modules_install install

'install' copies the bzImage to /boot/vmlinuz, copies the old 
/boot/vmlinuz image to /boot/vmlinuz-old, updates lilo.conf to reflect 
these changes, and runs lilo.

You've got a . where a / should be in the above line.

Check your /etc/modules(.conf) for that line 'net-pf-1' and see what 
it's referencing.

Alternatively, since you are using debian, you CAN just grab a 
preconfigured kernel via apt-get that *should* work out of the box.  For 
example:

$ apt-cache search kernel | grep 2.4.19-686
kernel-headers-2.4.19-686 - Linux kernel headers 2.4.19 on 
PPro/Celeron/PII/PIII/PIV
kernel-image-2.4.19-686 - Linux kernel image 2.4.19 on 
PPro/Celeron/PII/PIII/PIV.
kernel-pcmcia-modules-2.4.19-686 - Mainstream PCMCIA modules 2.4.19 on 
PPro/Celeron/PII/PIII/PIV.
pcmcia-modules-2.4.19-686 - PCMCIA Modules for Linux (kernel 2.4.19-686).

Hope that helps.

WEhen that happens, you buy a new laptop.

You can get it repaired, but it will cost you about the same as a new 
laptop.

Thanks.  I finally found that and that there was or is a proposal to add
it to ftp protocol.  This left me with using proftpd to put the particular
user in a directory and chroot.  This works for me.

You *could* troll eBay for a while looking for a similar laptop that is 
DOA but with a good display...or check the Sony Vaio pages for a 
replacement display.

But, like Alan said - even that route is expensive.  My wife's Dell 8100 
has the 14.1" screen - I was checking the Dell site a while ago and 
noticed that they sell the 15" screens...for about 3/4 the price of a 
brand-new laptop.

But, YMMV.  I hope you find someplace that will fix yours for a 
reasonable price.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0209100923010.6027-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I built and installed the 2.4.19 kernel on one machine without any
problems at all. On another box, make works until 'install'. Then I get
errors about unresolved symbols in a bunch of scsi drivers; e.g.,
sym53cxx8.o.

  There is a Tekram dc-315 series adapter in this box, but I didn't see a
specific module when I ran menuconfig.

  What do I do to get rid of these errors but include support for this
adapter (that's supposed to run the Umax scanner).

Thanks,

Rich

Sounds like you've got a good excuse for a new laptop, and can retire
the old one to desktop duty.

also see if sony has out-of-warranty repair service and call
them for a price quote, compare against repair shops.  and
homeowners or renter's insurance may cover repair or

Technically, the one partition (and only one) that has the "boot" flag
set is the only partition that will boot win98, it shouldn't matter
which IDE port the drive is plugged into.  However this seems to be
dependent on the BIOS's ability to recognize and properly initiate the
boot loader so, YMMV.  FYI, I have accidentally booted win98 from the
secondary-master IDE port because the drive I had setup (with a fresh
install of 98) on the primary didn't have the boot flag set.

Good Luck

Backup your .config.  make mrproper.  Copy your .config back.  make
menuconfig. save exit, then build as usual.  If you still have
problems then something else is wrong.  But you said it worked on the
other computer.

Of course this assumes that you used the same config, even if you
didn't it can make it easier to trouble shoot.

You can do anything with the kernel you want to....

For instance, my current Kernel is w4l2419 ... after I re-do my system
here in the next week or so, it'll probably change names to
w4l2419preempt ...  :-)

The name of the file isn't important at all.

Hello,

My boss left for a few days and I've been asked to take over some work on
one of our projects in CVS, but I have no idea of the project name.  What
CVS command do I use to get a list of available projects for checkout?  I
can't seem to find that information in the docs.

'cvc checkout -c' seemed to be what I wanted, but it didn't list any
projects.

I'm using WinCVS on a Windows 2000 box, or I have command line access on our
linux boxes.

Win4Lin is currently on-sale for something like $60.  It might be worth
looking in to.

I have both Win4Lin and VMWare 3.x on here.  There's no competition at
all between speed.  Win4Lin is about a billion times faster than VMWare.

However, VMWare has better video support than Win4Lin.  A flash-based
application I'm testing for somebody wont' work in W4L, it causes a BSOD
(BSODs in Linux!  Oh my!) and crashes.  It works fine in VMWare, albeit
slower than snot.

Just wanted to toss in my two cents.... you can get trial versions of
W4L if you fill out their support webpage with a request.

No, it only cats the module, not lists the modules.  The info pages
are a lot more useful.

On the linux box, try doing:

ls $CVSROOT

where $CVSROOT is the CVS environment variable.

I don't know, like I said, I was using it for ipsec, not apache.  Did
you rename the certificate and the key or change the config file to
point to the new files?  You might also want to open the old files and
compare the format to the new files (that would be the most likely
source of a corrupted file).  Particularly the part about deleting the
one section of the key file, that may have been ipsec specific (though
as I was reading it, it seemed to imply being version specific).

Sorry I don't have better answers for you.

Thanks, but no love:

[cpoe at admin cpoe]$ ls $CVSROOT
ls: :pserver:cpoe at admin.onsitetech.com:/scratch/cvs/info.outdoor-x: No such

I get the almost the same message when run as root.

  My concern would have been converting everything from one virtual machine
to another. It would be a serious time commitment to move all my data off
the vm, replace it, re-install the guest OS and the applications, configure
the one application, then move my data back. Ugh!

  I went ahead and purchased the VMware-3.1.1 upgrade. A quick test shows
that it _should_ work as before. Tomorrow I need to modify and print some
maps so I'll know for certain if there's no problems.

  The last piece is re-installing WordPerfec/8 for linux. But, the original
cdrom is not in the holders with every other cdrom I have. I'll try to find
a copy of that or, if need be, a copy of Corel Office/2k just to get a
working WP in linux for all my data files. The less desireable, but
ultimately workable, solution would be to put a copy of WP/win in vmware and
move all my data over. I shudder to think of the time committment to
translate 9 years of WP docs to something modern!

  Anyone have an installable WP/8 for linux? I had the server edition, but
the individual one would work, too.

Thanks,

Rich

the easiest way is to look at your repository. This is visible in your 
dir string for cvs

  eg. cvs -d :pserver:user at host.name:/dir-name

you would look at host 'host.name' in directory '/dir-name' for the 
project names.

You might want to pick up the Fogel book IIRC 'Open Source Development 
with CVS' this should answer this question.

just type "fg<enter>" when pine is suspended, leaving you with a shell
prompt.

I've verry rarely had this work (chaining make commands)

usually I do this:

make dep && make -j3 bzImage && make -j3 modules && make modules_install &&
make install

which nearly always works, when the shorter line above does not. It may be
that I was doing this:

make -j3 dep bzImage modules ...

but I cannot check at the moment. Does anyone know if the parralelization
switch (-j) would cause issues with a kernel compile in this way?

  I've done this. Pine is running in a virtual terminal and the 'fg' command
has no effect.

The quick solution is if you're still in the same terminal you 
backgrounded "pine" in simply type: fg<RETURN>

If you're running through an xterm and have forgotten which session you 
backgrounded "pine" in you can do the following:

1) Run "ps" and under the TTY column note what "pts" "pine" is 
associated with.

2) For each xterm you have open, type "tty" at the shell prompt which 
displays the "pts" device your xterm is associated with. Once you get 
the same "pts" device that pine is associated with you can then type: 
"fg<RETURN>" to bring "pine" to the foreground.

  My problem is that I never get a prompt! I see the message that tells me
I've put pine into the background and should press 'fg [Enter]' to restore
it (which I knew anyway), but there's no prompt. Pressing the [Enter] key
moves the cursor down a line but at col. 1.

Hi Carla,
I had a similar problem with a Portage 3110.  The replacement of the screen
cost was almost as much as
I paid for the computer, which was second hand.
After almost a year a reasonably priced screen showed
up on eBay at about 1/7 the cost of getting it done with
a service center.   Of course there would have been labor
on top of that.  I was able to replace it myself, and the
screen I received was brand new with no bad pixels.

So I am a happy camper!!

Paul

How exactly are you running pine? Are you running it from a menu entry? I'm
a bit confused as to what you are left with, that you can move the cursor
arround, and yet not be at a prompt.

Rogan,

  Can't move the cursor, but pressing enter yields a line feed.

  One of the main xfce icons invokes "aterm <stuff> -e pine". So pine opens
in its very own virtual terminal.

You need to login (ssh, telnet) to the server that holds the repository then 
browse /scratch/cvs

If you're not adverse to gui tools, check out (accidental pun) TkCVS

http://sourceforge.net/projects/tkcvs

If you install tcl/tk on your windows box (not difficult), TkCVS makes a lot 
of CVS stuff less painful.

That's a server mapped CVSROOT, instead of file mapped.  On the machine
pserver, in /scratch/cvs/info.outdoor-x should be all the modules by
directory.

As far as I can tell, there's no way to query CVS to ask it which
modules it has directly.

Thanks Keith.

Thanks Paul.  I didn't try it but I now see that it
would probably have worked---depending on my root UMASK.

Finally, Felix Lee replied with:

Good guess.   The font dir and the font.{dir|scale} files were.
But the font files weren't.

That was it!  I suppose I should be embarassed, being
an old Linux hand hoodwinked by such a greenhorn trick.
But I'm not.  In fact I'm confused.
In my first attempt the .ttf font files were created with
root read permission for both owner and group:  -rw-r-----  root root

In another attempt it was -rw-r-----  deanm dvideo                      

Now I'm deanm.  And I'm in both group dvideo and group root.
Furthermore KDE was started by deanm (which is probably of no consequence).
Most important, `gfontsel' was started by both me and root in the many
times I tried to get the thing to work.  It was started on "The Command Line"
not by "binking" anything so in each case it should have been running
with the permissions of the executor---in which case it should have
been able to see the fonts.

Oh. Maybe I see.  I'm wonder ... (some seconds later)

xfs is running under UID "xfs".  That's it.  xfs couldn't get to the
fonts.  I can change their ownership, and then I can (if I like)
turn off world read bit.

I like this guess.  It's usually the one I make.

Once again, eleven hours later, having pursued this to the bitter end,
I've picked up a few more crumbs of knowledge.  What a colossal

I was wondering if anyone on this list knows of a good program to
replace the functionality of hyperterm in windows?  We have a small
computer, with only a serial connection at the time.  We can use
minicom to login, but when we attempt to transfer files we are dead.
And it has been hard to find documentation for minicom.

In windows we can just use hyperterminal to transfer the files no
problem.

The computer is running linux, but it is not a *complete* install of
linux, it just has the basics right now.

Thanks,
Jason

If someone was nice enough to create module names (aliases to directories), 
you can checkout the CVSROOT directory itself

$ cvs co CVSROOT

and look at the modules dir

$ less CVSROOT/modules

This is a hand edited file and does not necessarily show all dirs in the cvs 
top-level dir.

I seem to run into above average problems, but then 
again my average problems under windows are that I have

How would I do this?  The little computer only has about 64megs total
for storage, so hopefully I don't need to install anything new on it.

We tried (in minicom) every way we could think of to transfer the
files, including Kermit.  But it didn't work.  Many times it just
screwed up our connection state and we had to reconnect.

Thanks,
Jason

I'm no Galen <grin>, but I will write to tell that on linux you'd want
`gkermit' (GNU Kermit).

Whereas

  The Average Windows Problem takes an average of two hours to
  fix -- on every single Windows host plagued by the problem.

Hence, the magic threshold is six hosts. :-)

I'm not familiar with this number or term.  Could you elaborate?

I know that the file transfer (at least the zmodem protocol) works in
mincom, I've used it to transfer boot images to Cisco routers.  The
tricky part seems to be getting the protocol parameters the same on both
ends of the connection (actually the Cisco routers didn't have any
adjustment, I had to tweak away at minicom until it worked).  My
experience has been that if minicom doesn't work, it is because I
haven't changed the right parameters.

I know this isn't the answer to your question, but I did try out other
terminal emulators, and I found that minicom worked the best.

  According to the Preface to Frank da Cruz and Christine M. Gianone's
"Using C-Kermit, Second Edition", "C-Kermit software offers you terminal
connection, error-free file transfer and management, script programming and
comprehensive support for national and international character sets over a
wide variety of communications methods incuding direct and dialed serial
connections and (in most versions) TCP/IP, X.25 and or other netowrks."

  C-Kermit is still in active development at Columbia University and they
have a very helpful staff there. You can make a direct serial connection
between the two boxes and what you need on the little guy should fit
comfortably.

  I was going to write my bathymetry software in C-Kermit but decided on C
instead.

HTH,

Subject: [PLUG] dev fs and permission problem
Message-ID: <20020910222012.GA679@jade.CS.ORST.EDU>

 Since flashing my BIOS last week (Tyan Tiger MPX mobo) I have had problems
 with permissions on various devices. /dev/dsp, /dev/mixer, and /dev/ttyS1
 at the least have had their permissions changed, such that a normal user
 can no longer make use of them. (/dev/ttyS1 has all rx perms, but no one can
 write to it, the others I would have to reboot to check).

 This is easily fixed with a chmod, however since I am using the
 dev file system they revert to the undesired state when I reboot. Rather
 than write a script to reset them at each boot I'd like to know how to
 "correctly" fix the problem.

 fwiw, I'm running Debian Sid, on 2.4.17 for x86.

 Thanks,
 Rogan

Thanks for the help, unfortunately kermit is not on the little guy yet :( so
we are some what limited to what is there. Oddly, hyperterminal does not
need any programs to be explicitly run by the user to accept a file. 

I was trying to replicate the error we had with Zmodem to send to the list,
and the file xfer actually worked :)

I was able to run "rz" on the littly guy (one of the few programs available
on it) and then minicom succeded with Zmodem. It sounds likely that tooling
arround with Zmodem settings will aleviate this aswell, and if not we hope
to be able to get pcmcia on the 'lil guy up and running soon, with a nic.

Thanks,
Rogan   aka: "The guy with the null modem cable"

  Has anyone tried wine lately? According to the winehq Web site, a whole
bunch of applications -- including AutoCAD -- will run on it. I'm going to
try my two winders apps; if they run I just wasted the money on the VMware
upgrade.

  I'm curious if anyone here's played with it lately. If so, what have been

I'm having a hard time imagining how a BIOS flash (a hardware change)
would change the permissions of device files (a software change), what
else has changed on the system?

If nothing else has changed, then my guess would be that the kernel
needs to be recompiled, but it is just a guess.

For what it's worth, I have Windows ME on hda1 and I installed XP on hdb1. XP 
puts it's boot sector on the C: drive, no matter what. (XP - Windows 2K 
functionally the same for this purpose). I then installed Slackware on a 
partition on the hdb5, used lilo, which points to Slack and to Windows on 
hda1. If I choose Windows, it brings up the XP boot menu, where I can select 
either ME or XP.

If you have any questions, feel free to respond to me directly.

IIRC, the serial settings were the key, baud rate in particular (if this
isn't exactly right, the other end may respond, but in a way that
doesn't make sense), but the error protocol (or handshake protocol) had
to be correct as well.   As far as I can tell almost every device made
after 1990 uses 8 bit, no parity and one stop bit (abbreviated 8,N,1). 
Unfortunately, I can't begin to guess what settings you will need.

For the Cisco connection, I think I had to start with 2400 Bps, 8,N,1,
Hardware flow control on, and software flow control off. I seem to
remember reading somewhere that a typical null modem configuration uses
either hardware flow control or no flow control, while the software flow
control is used for dial-up modems, but I may be mistaken.

Wine has made leaps and bounds in the last year or two.  Mostly, I
think, due to the (now defunkt) Lindows deal.

Wine runs some of the stranger apps I've played with, including a couple
of SETI at Home team stat monitors without too much problems.  Anything
that interfaces with the web can cause problems if it uses Internet
Exploiter.

It's free... and a fairly easy (albeit long) compile.  I'd try it out
and see if your apps work.  Most of the apps I've tried do work, but
have either been a bit more unstable than they are in Windoze native or
are a little bit off... be it fonts or toolbars or whatnot.

Another option might be to just use Hyperterminal... I would expect it
works fine under Wine.  :-)

  That's the impression I got from looking at the list of apps known to run
over it. Quite a difference from about four years ago. :-)

  I have it installed as part of the OS change and I just grabbed
yesterday's CVS build as a rpm. I'll try firing it up this evening and see
if it will run.

Subject: [PLUG] Printer Installation - Success was Building Kernel for Debian
Message-ID: <3D7E8DDD.7E78D0AA@attbi.com>

This started out as the Building Kernel for Debian thread because I
didn't realize that the USB support I needed was already in the kernel I
had. I'll go back to building a kernel later on, but for now, I'm happy
to report that I discovered what I was missing, and I have my HP Deskjet
656c working from my newly installed USB 2 card.

I went to http://www.linuxnewbie.org/forum/search.php and searched on
"USB AND HowTo." One of the results, titled "USB problems" solved my
problem. The individual who asked for help was directed to see if his
USB modules were loaded. I looked and found that mine were not. I did
see some references to USB in the messages that scroll by during boot,
though. After reading man modprobe and looking at what was available, I
concluded that I needed to run

modprobe usb-ohci
modprobe usb-core
modprobe printer

I knew from yesterday's study that since I have a card with NEC chips, I
need ohci. I guessed that I needed usb-core from things mentioned in the
linuxnewbie thread, and I guessed that I needed printer since it exists
in /lib/modules/2.2.20/usb. After loading those modules, I ran the CUPS
web based admin tool again, installed the printer, and printed a test
page.

There may be some fine points that I've missed, such as, is what I did
permanent, or do I need to put something in a config file somewhere --
I've read the man page for modprobe, update-modules, and  modules.conf,
and didn't come away with a solid understanding that I did or did not
need to do anything further. But for now, I'm happy that I can finally
print. I'm very close to abandoning Windows as the environment in which
I live on a day-to-day basis. Just need to find a page layout tool to
print booklets, and to  figure out how to use e-mail with EMACS. I'm
really partial to the tree style of storing e-mails used in Netscape, so
I'm hoping there will be something that is functionally equivalent.

Jason,

  I made a backup copy of .config, but in the same directory. Oops! make
mrproper wiped it out. Then I copied the .config from the working build to
the new box and ran through the rest of the steps. Same problems: there're
problems with sis.o in .../kernel/drivers/char/drm/ and with
.../kernel/drivers/char/scsi/.

  I suppose that the next step is to reconfigure without these and see what
happens.

It's been a very long time since I've had to think or deal with serial 
ports like this but I recall using Kermit in cases where (8,N,1) wasn't 
available. I recall using Kermit in places where we had 7 bit, even 
parity connections (7,E,1). IIRC Kermit did some special "quoting" of 
characters so it was possible to transfer binary data via Kermit even 
though the connection was 7 bit.

Jason, et al.:

  I removed the offending modules and this time it built and installed just
fine. Whew! I now have the 2.4.19 kernel running on both workstations. This
weekend: the notebook goes from 6.2/2.2.19 to 7.3/2.4.19. At least I now
have a good experience base.

Thanks very much,

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0209101826230.9879-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I've tried to find mail lists for dosemu and wine, but without success. If
someone knows of one, or knows what google search term will reveal them.

  From my readings so far, it seems that I need to actually install DOS or
Windows on the vfat partition. It's /dev/hd10 and mounted on /dos7. Before,
I had PC-DOS7 installed in the mbr of /dev/hdb1 so dosemu worked just fine.
Now it won't boot. I think that I could access my ol' DOS app via wine, so
I'd rather focus on that.

  The winhq Web site didn't say how to install the OS, say win98, onto a
linux partition that's been formatted with the vfat fs. Or, if it was there,
I missed it.

  Rob, have you done this before?

Thanks,

Rich

DOSEMU is kinda dead, or close to it, I think.  I don't know about Wine
mailing lists... the FreeDOS mailing lists, however, will often handle
DOSEMU questions (in my experience) ...

Ok... DOSEMU and WinE are two totally different things.  DOSEMU boots up
DOS inside a sorta-virtualized machine.  You run DOS (MS-DOS, FreeDOS,
PC-DOS, whatever) inside a window.  It is *slower than hell* ...

WINE, on the other hand, runs more of a linux-way.  That is, the
programs have their windows rendered by your WM, etc.  Wine works well
completely standalone.  You do *not* install your OS into some sort of
virtualized disk or somethign as you might do with DOSEMU.

If you do have Windows installed somewhere accessable to your system,
you can tell Wine to work from there... this will allow any needed files
to be more easily found.

That's because you don't do that.  DOSEMU boots, Wine doesn't.  Win98
sucks as far as Wine goes... if you want to have Wine work with a
pre-existing installation of whatever, I strongly suggest you go with
Windows 2000 ... if not Win2K, then NT 4.0 or XP.  How to get them
there?  You could use VMWare, I think....

>   Rob, have you done this before?

I've done similar things, but haven't ever installed Windows so that
Wine could use it.  If I had Windows there for whatever reason, I might
try getting Wine using it... but that was always with Win98SE, and it
totally sucked.

I hope that answered a few questions for ya.  :-)

  Since I have only one really useful DOS app left -- there is no linux
replacement I've found in five years of searching -- I've not noticed any
speed issues. It's done well by me. But, I do believe that wine will run it
so that's OK with me.

  I had to buy a full install of win98 a few years ago because the upgrade
from win95 would not work in vmware. I didn't wnat to do it, but I promised
myself it would be the last money Microsoft got out of me. So, the only
Windows here is a guest OS in the vmware partition, and not accessible
except through vmware. A few years ago, I read of a way to access data in
that binary file from linux, but I've no idea if that's still true or would
be useful under wine.

  I'm not at all concerned with speed. This is just a test to see if a
particular app runs. I've no intention of ugrading to that version in any
case, but this is just an experiment. If it works, I bet we'll see a _lot_
of people defenestrating and running this application over wine. Of course,
their other needs could be met by OO and other native linux apps. They can
buy w2k, nt, xp or whatever they want.

Rob,

  OTOH, I just about have my ol' DOS app running under winecosole! And
that's with no tweaking of ~/.wine/wine.conf at all. Wow!

  I'm finding bits and pieces of wine docs dribbled all over the place. Will
read more tomorrow. But, wine does NOT need to have any OS installed! And,
we can specify what flavor of Windows to emulate (or MS/PC-DOS up to 6.22).
The Winders versions are 2.0, 3.0, 3.11, 95, 98, w2k, me, xp, nt3.51 or nt4.
I may have forgotten some.
 
  This may also be a way for Carla's client to use Access on a linux box.

I got a console connection into my Sparc20, thanks everyone who contributed!
For anyone's future reference, I grabbed the female DB-15 / RJ plug and male
DB-25 / RJ plug from a Cisco router.  Put a straight ethernet connection in
between and away I went.

Using debian 2.2 I installed a base system and selected dhcp.  It pulls an
IP address from my Netgear router (which it is soon, hopefully, to replace).
The Sparc can ping the outside world.  However, it is not resolving DNS.

Cool!  Now I wonder if I can get my old Master of Magic game working
under there.............

That's all I really want, is my MoM!  MoO2 would be nice, too.

Sorry, I didn't mean to imply you had to have Windows... you most
definitly don't!  I generally run Wine without Windows... it works
better by itself than it does with Win98SE, IMHO.

You've been to winehq.org, right?  :-)

No, not really.  Wine doesn't run Access.  Codeweavers CrossoverOffice,
when last I looked, said access sorta worked, but not well.  Access is
just too complex for Wine to easily run it right now.

Poor computer! You're the third person to suggest I try to get a screen shot. 
Looks like I'll have to give it a try!

I had the same problem with my RedHat 7.2 system.  I had to set my DNS
configuration to use the DNS Search path to ATTBI.COM and set the DNS
servers statically.

edit the /etc/resolv.conf file.
change the nameservers in there to your nameservers.
change the domain to your domain.
change the search to your domain.

Message-ID: <002d01c25950$a059f160$1600a8c0@vncvr1.wa.home.com>

Wrote a resolv.conf file, though I am very disappointed in dhcp not pulling
it.  Moving on ....

I cannot write to any existing file.  I am using vi and logged in as root
(Sparc 20 running debian 2.2).  When I do a ":w" I get :

 Can't write to "resolv.conf" -- NOT WRITTEN

So what I've been doing is editing files, saving them to <filename>.old, and
then mv <filename>.old <filename>.

It works, but it's irritating.

Any thoughts?

I've been wanting to use Evolution for a mail client for a while.

I set it up for my wife and she loves it.  However I am using local mail 
spools that are NFS mounted and I could never get it to check mail without
a locking complaint.

Tonight I decided to check again and with googles help found.

Did the trick!

So now I'm going to try and migrate from Kmail to evolution.

Obviously, a man's judgement cannot be better than the information on
which he
has based it.  Give him the truth and he may still go wrong when he has
the chance to be right, but give him no news or present him only with
distorted
and incomplete data, with ignorant, sloppy or biased reporting, with
propaganda
and deliberate falsehoods, and you destroy his whole reasoning
processes, and
make him something less than a man.

Coming from a MS world, Evolution is a nice segway into Linux world.  It
handles filtering very well (especially the copius amounts of email I
get from the plug list :) ).  I do have some problems with passwords. 
If I opt to remember password, I've found that I need to get it right
the first time and Evolution doesn't remember any new password for an
existing account.  Just my few cents worth on Evolution.

I switched from KMail to Sylpheed to Evolution.  Aside from its (IMHO)
broken PGP/GPG handling, I'm starting to like it.

One thing you might think about is compiling it from source.  It was
really an oinker here... taking a good 10-15 seconds to load up.

Now it takes closer to five or six seconds.

Here are the flags I used in its compile:

Subject: [PLUG] Unmounted /dev
Message-ID: <1031717209.2677.44.camel@alexlinux.qwest.net>

I'm running MDL8.2 and had a breaker flip on me a couple of times in the
past few days.(New breaker) Each time fsck was run successfully. Now
here's the interesting part.
/dev/hda10, which is my /home partition can not be mounted. I get

mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hda10,
or too many mounted file systems

If I do a df I get
/dev/hda8	/
none		/dev/shm
/dev/hda1	/mnt/win_c
/dev/hda5	/mnt/win_d
/dev/hda6	/mnt/win_e
/dev/hda7	/mnt/win_f
/dev/hda13	/mnt/win_g
/dev/hda14	/tmp
/dev/hda11	/usr
/dev/hda12	/var

Now this tells me that my /home is not being mounted. Even stranger
still is I can login and access all my files in the /home directory.

I have made sure that it is a ext3 file system by

tune2fs -j /dev/hda10

I checked the fstab

/dev/hda8 / ext3 defaults 1 1
none /dev/pts devpts mode=0620 0 0
none /dev/shm tmpfs defaults 0 0
/dev/hda10	/home	ext3	 user,exec,dev,suid,rw,uid=502,gid=501 1 2
/mnt/cdrom /mnt/cdrom supermount
dev=/dev/scd0,fs=iso9660,--,iocharset=iso8859-1 0 0
/mnt/cdrom2 /mnt/cdrom2 supermount
dev=/dev/hdd,fs=iso9660,ro,--,iocharset=iso8859-1 0 0
//cubase/E /mnt/e smbfs user 0 0
/mnt/floppy /mnt/floppy supermount
dev=/dev/fd0,fs=vfat,--,iocharset=iso8859-1,umask=0,sync,codepage=850 0

/dev/hda5 /mnt/win_d vfat iocharset=iso8859-1,umask=0,codepage=850 0 0
/dev/hda6 /mnt/win_e vfat iocharset=iso8859-1,umask=0,codepage=850 0 0
/dev/hda7 /mnt/win_f vfat iocharset=iso8859-1,umask=0,codepage=850 0 0
/dev/hda13 /mnt/win_g vfat iocharset=iso8859-1,umask=0,codepage=850 0 0
none /proc proc defaults 0 0
/dev/hda14 /tmp ext2 defaults 1 2
/dev/hda11 /usr ext3 defaults 1 2
/dev/hda12 /var ext3 defaults 1 2
/dev/hda9 swap swap defaults 0 0

and I think everything is ok there. Then I tried to use Linuxconf to get
it mounted and it did! I thought "SUCCESS" until I opened Nautilus and
all my files were in /home/lost+found in at least a thousand folders.
<PANIC> So I took a chance and reran Linuxconf telling it to do nothing
and everything was back to "normal".

So my question is....what the heck is going on here?
Why am I able to use /home even when /dev/hda10 is not mounted?
Should I just count my lucky stars and live life to the fullest?

TIA

Message-ID: <VP3HDWTHKJ4YC71HBGDD84YA9JHXU.3d7f4a63@mike>

My web server was running a little slow tonight so I started 
poking around. I was stunned to see all of these ports open. 
I do run FPSE on this upgraded Linux box, but I don't think 
it uses "31337/udp  open        BackOrifice" as a standard 
port.

Any suggestions? It's been fully updated for quite a while 
with up2date. It looks like I'm screwed. ps -aux shows 
nothing extrordinary.

No, it's the weirdest- No Windows on the PC at all. Nothing 
to run an exe in sight.

I've done a bit more research, and downloaded a tool to find 
the RSTb worm. I don't get a hit on the rstb_detector, 
claiing it doesn't have that one. 

I NEVER read e-mail or d/l files from that PC, it's a server, 
not a workstation. 

I'm wondering if it's related to the front page stuff I've 
got running on it. Maybe that cr__ has the ability to get 
infected on it's own...

Mike

Does anyone here use Evolution in combination with procmail? For example,
what if your mail is already sorted into files on a remote server by
procmail, will evolution read these files in as folders? Or do I need to
use an auxillary program like fetchmail?

I once installed portsentry and it made it look like I had open ports
like this.  I didn't like that cause it seemed to call attention to
myself in the wrong circles.  Even if they were all simply traps by
portsentry, I didn't want to attract any undue attention.

  This stumps me completely. OpenOffice-1.0.1 ran just fine yesterday. This
morning I go to fire it up and no display comes up. When I check the list of
running processes, I find three. No error messages. No display hidden under
another one on a different virtual desktop.

  Any ideas what could cause this?

[unsnip]

Procmail uses the 'maildir' standard to separate it's messages into folders. It's a solid system that has been around for some time. See /usr/share/doc/courier-doc/README.sharedfolders.html (or find / -name README.sharedfolders.html) for more information on the Maildir and Maildir++ standard. 

Evolution supports this. Look for something to the effect of ``a standard UNIX directory'' for the source of the mail (instead of, for example, a POP3 server) and input the path to your sorted mail folder.

I will follow up this afternoon if you would like a quick step-by-step on it.

I AM running portsentry...

I'll try turning it off and re-checking...

I can't seem to find out how to turn portsentry off. I tried disabling all of the 
ports and restarting, but hat didn't seem to do it.

No, but I've seen it happen with other applications, like acroread. 
It'll somehow lose contact with its DISPLAY without exiting.

I don't think the ports are really open anyway.  Is there a daemon
running you can kill?

I tried Evo for a bit and became frustrated that it moved my mail.  I
already use procmail to put it where it should go.  Kmail just reads the
same files that mutt reads, so I have a choice and can try each out.
Evo moved everything to it's own directory.  Kind of intrusive, I
thought.  And it just isn't snappy enough for my tastes either.  I ended
up back with mutt.  The other thing it can't do that is important to me
is auto-delete old emails from mailing lists.
my $.02.

Mike,

  Doesn't it show up in the process list? Did you try
'/etc/rc.d/init.d/portsentry stop'? You can also try /sbin/chkconfig and
turn it off.

[usnip]

I am assuming that the name of the hanging process is something like 'oofice.' Insert the process name that uniquely identifies the process as one that belongs to OpenOffice if that is not the case.

The following performed at the command line will remove any process with the name 'oofice...'

   ps -ef | grep oofice | awk '{ print $2 }' | while read i  [Press Enter]
   do  [Press Enter]
   kill -HUP $i  [Press Enter]
   done [Press Enter]

If they are stubborn, replace the `HUP' signal in the kill command with a '-9'.  Try to run the application again.

Of course, you could simlply kill the processes one at a time but this is handy to know if you run into a process that spawns several child processes. 

When running a large server, you want to do a manual 'ps -ef' and look before you kill.

I cannot seem to find the location of the database. It's not 'rgb' and the

Cooper,

  I ran 'killall soffice.bin' and that worked just fine. I worded my
question poorly. What I meant to ask is how to get the application to velcro
itself to the display when it had come apart.
 
  I tried invoking it several times with the same result and that's when I
wrote and asked for help.

  So, if re-invocation does not bring up the display, is there anything
short of 'init 6' to get them together again?

Many thanks,

Rich

I'm not sure if you have tried this, or even if it will make a difference, but I would make sure that all OO processes are killed and then shut down you X server completely, then start the X server up again and try OO again.  No promises, but if you haven't tried it yet, it might be worth a try.

   If FILE is specified, `dircolors' reads it to determine which colors
to use for which file types and extensions.  Otherwise, a precompiled
database is used.  For details on the format of these files, run
`dircolors --print-database'.
8<----------------------------------------------------------------------->8

You did not read closely enough.  What you should do is run "dircolors
--print-database > /etc/dircolors", (assuming you want this change to be
system wide, for all users) then edit "/etc/dircolors" and use it as
input from your Bash or Zsh startup scripts.

The "dircolors -p" output is, by the way, a good way to get the
colorization escape codes, for reference.

Just a note - lsof is a great tool for situations like this. It also
doesn't seem to be trojaned by many rootkits when netstat and ps almost
always are. Just to be safe, it's good to keep a statically link known
good copy on read-only media.

Yeah, well the nice thing is you know for sure it is a config error,

This is one of the really useful features of mounting partitions inside
file systems.  The mount point (/home in this case) isn't a mount point
until something is mounted to it, until then it is just another
directory that can have files and directories in it.  After you mount,
the original files and directories don't get erased, they are just no
longer accessible and the files and directories that are stored on the
mounted partition are now accessible.  I've done this many times with
the /home directory.  Install the OS with only one or two partitions,
set up user accounts and then realize that the / partition is too small
to contain /home.  I would then install a new harddrive, mount it to
/mnt, copy all files inside /home to /mnt (with no users logged in),
then mount the new drive on /home.  If something goes wrong (like
forgetting to use the -Rdp option with cp), just unmount the drive and
the original /home is still there.

Looks like the power surge has caused a corruption of the partition.

This depends on the free space of your / partition.  Since your
unmounted /home directory seems to be intact, you could re-initialize
the /dev/hda10 partition (all data will be lost on this partition),
mount it somewhere else (preferably an empty directory), copy all files
and directories from /home to the new mount, then remount to /home.

HTH a little anyway.

John,

  I went one better: shut down X and logged out. Logged in, started X and
tried again. I didn't -- still don't -- know of anything else to do.

Many thanks,

Does the Red Hat version of "dircolors" read that automaticly, or is it
pulled in by one of the shell startup files?

RTFM "devfsd" -- /usr/share/doc/devfsd, man update-devfs, and look at
the conffiles in /etc/devfs/.

You can create /dev-state/, and enable the rules in the devfsd.conf that
turn that feature on.  It seems to work fairly well, aside from some
warning messages each time I reboot re devcices for which no driver is
loaded yet.

  Yes, I did try that. No output in the aterm, threads running in the
process list and no display. Because I also had s stuck rpm install
(uninterruptable sleep status) that clogged up the rpm database, I gave up
and rebooted.

  All's working again now. Go figure. Just a computer moment.

It is called by one of of the shell startup files.  In Slackware it is
/etc/profile:

# Set up the LS_COLORS and LS_OPTIONS environment variables for color
ls:
if [ "$SHELL" = "/bin/zsh" ]; then
 eval `dircolors -z`
elif [ "$SHELL" = "/bin/ash" ]; then
 eval `dircolors -s`
else
 eval `dircolors -b`
fi

You could put something similar in your ~/.bashrc file to be sure it is
called...

Specifically...  $HOME/.bashrc reads /etc/bashrc which reads
/etc/profile.d/colorls.sh which runs dircolors on /etc/DIR_COLORS

I just had a random thought...

In HURD you can create translators and essentually bind them to a
file.  I might get some terminology wrong, but one thing you can then
do with this "file" is random email signatures.  That is, you can make
a file that changes it's contents after everytime it is read.

Does anyone know an easy way that doesn't require root to do this with
unix or linux?

I had a cool idea for an email signature, but it would require that my
email changes everytime I send an email.  And I want to use pine, but
I would prefer to be able to do it at the file level not the email
client level.  This is something that could be useful in general.

Thanks,
Jason

I was intersted in this, too, since I've noticed different colorization
in ls depending on whether I was logged in as root or as rsteff. I
didn't get much out of man ls, but it did say that the full
documentation for ls was in info. Sure enough, info ls has a lot of
stuff, including a section on dircolors.

Sure, create a named pipe. All the widely used scripting languages

Similar functionality, but not _quite_ the same thing, I think.  The
named pipe requires the perl FIFO-filler program to be running in a
"daemon mode".  If the perl script "goes away", reading from the named
pipe hangs.  The HURD functionality spawns the program more like an
inetd thing.  

Seems to me, it used to be possible, and even common, for people's
.signature's, .plan's, .project's and whatnot to be executable and
perform a similar function.  I never did that, so I don't know how
common it is anymore.

I've tried the three fingered salute, but nothing changes.

Any ideas?

Yes, I'm now having a trouble with the script.  If I start the script when
I login, and kill it when I logout I'm ok, but if I just want to leave it
running it's no good, I can't logout.  And if I drop the connection it
dies.  But!  screen comes to save the day.  (God I love screen!)

Thanks everyone.  This is close enough.  If the admins that be complain
about it, or if I have problems with it dieing I can try harder, but this
should be good for now.

For some reason it occured to me that I should have an ascii art animation
as my signature, and every email I send should increment to the next
frame, and then loop back when I get to the end....

Subject: [PLUG] Printing a xterm window
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0209111432430.21656-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I'm looking for a method to print just the _current_ contents of a 
xterm.  Similar to how I print while using a xterm to ssh into 
another system and use pine, the percent key works to do this.  Is there a 
command sequence that will read the current screen and pass it to an 
external program?

After 8 pages of Goggle output I got tired and decided to ask the experts 
before I reached that mythical 11th hour.  :-)


TIA,

While I'm not a pine user, perhaps it has the same mechanism as mutt?
if your configuration is:

	set signature="FILENAME" but if FILENAME ends in a pipe '|' it is
interpreted as a script that mutt should read the STDOUT of to get your sig.

Note that I am not advocating for people to switch from pine to mutt,  which
has an official slogan of "All mail clients suck. This one just sucks less."

Hey,

    I just noticed that Red Hat has dropped linuxconf.
What are they using instead?  kontrol-panel?
kontrol-panel is ok, but it certainly isn't has complete as SuSE's yast2.
And of course it runs in X, so it assumes that I have a X server
somewhere.

    So how do most people configure Red Hat?  With a sysadmin front
end like kontrol-panel or webmin or by editing the configuration
files with vi (or emacs)?

% rpm -Uvh foo.rpm bar.rpm  (where foo.rpm and bar.rpm are the rpms in
question)

If all of the RPMS in the current directory are ones you want to install,
you could do some file globbing:

% rpm -Uvh *.rpm

If they have dependencies, get ready to hunt them down (rpmfind.net is
useful for this) and undergo the heckling of the "apt-get install foo"
crowd.

It depends on how you want to do it.

If you want to just install, regardless of what's already there, this 
command will do it:

rpm -i *

If you want to update those that already exist, and install those that 
don't:

rpm -U *

If you want to "freshen" (which means only update those that have a 
prior version installed):

rpm -F *

Your date/time looks correct.

Try this page:

One of the "media copy" ANSI sequences is probably what you want.  (i.e.
ESC [ i) Also look at the xterm attribute "printerCommand" to tell it what
command to run when this sequence is received.

It has been a *long* time since I have touched linuxconf.  What kind of
settings did it provide you access to?

IIRC, it wasn't too terribly extensive and editing config files by hand
might easier.  That's what I do here, but it ain't RH.

I prefer vi.  It leaves the helpful comments in place.  It leaves my own

  What that's telling you is that you don't have ethereal-gnome installed so
it cannot freshen the installation. Do "rpm -q ethereal-gnome" and you
should get no response. That query tells you the verion of the installed
package. For example:

[root at salmo /home/rshepard]# rpm -q ethereal
ethereal-0.9.6-0.73.0

(I don't do Gnome or KDE here.)

  Move the ethereal-gnome rpm someplace else and re-run your Freshen
command. Then you can install ethereal-gnome.

  Two other hints:

  1)  Add the 'vh' switches to the rpm command line and you'll get progress
reports (as hashes) and more verbose output.

  B)  Since Karl hasn't offered the suggestion, I will. :-) Get yourself a
copy of apt-rpm and install it. It's easy, quick and wonderfully useful.
Then you can 'apt-get install ...', 'apt-get update ...' and so on. Very
handy during the 7.3 upgrade here.

One thing I've always wondered about apt*, is how in the world you
can trust the sources of the RPMs.  Wouldn't it be the easiest thing
in the world to hack one of the repository machines, corrupt the
RPMs with backdoors and automatic installation notifications and then
alter the MD5 sum information so that it checks out?  Then you
watch the vulnerable systems roll in.

Is this where someone explains the wonders of PGPGPG to me?

  Found the culprit! I'll pass on the information in case others have the
same problem.

  The RH 7.3 installer installed sendmail as well as postfix. But, sendmail
was set as the default in /etc/rc.d/init.d/ and was hogging port 25. I found
and fixed that quickly enough. But, what I didn't track down until just now
is that the /etc/cron.daily/1postfix script calls /usr/sbin/sendmail.

  Turns out there are three files in /usr/sbin/ starting with sendmail:
sendmail, sendmail.postfix and sendmail.sendmail. The first is a soft link
to /etc/alternatives/mta, which is, itself, a softlink to
/usr/sbin/sendmail.sendmail! Wow! What a convoluted and cryptic mess.

  Anyway, I changed the link so that /etc/alternatives/mta now points to
/usr/sbin/sendmail.postfix and the script works.

  Can you believe this?

I'm confused.  Are you questioning the safety of using apt, or that of
installing rpms?  Of course anything could happen, and someone could put
an exploit into gcc so that it generates backdoors when it compiles.  But
I think apt is a bit better because you can use the official debian site
to get all your .debs.

Pointing at Rich, you can also create a local instance for the user in 
~/.dir_colors.

Based on the shell, for example bash.  It would be 
/etc/profile.d/colorsls.sh.

RedHat does provide gui tools (X based only) for system management.  
Enigma's iteration was really disappointing compared to the functionality 
of linuxconf.  Valhalla's is better and supposedly the beta (Null) is 
greatly improved.  The tools start with "redhat-config-" and you can get a 
quick listing (if they are installed of course) by entering it on the 
command line and pressing tab a couple of times.

I believe just running the script that comes with alternatives would do 
this for you automagically.  Lest ways it did for me when I transitioned 
from sendmail to postfix.

FYI, this can also be done with source; last month
someone trojaned OpenSSH on the OpenBSD master ftp server, it even had time
to propagate to the mirrors:

http://www.linuxsecurity.com/advisories/other_advisory-2232.html

In the case of debian packages, if people used MD5sums from a different
source, your altered packages would not check out. You would have to crack
both the master MD5sum repository and, if they were distinct (not sure for
redhat) the master package repository, and replace only newly-updated
packages to avoid introducing inconsistencies with the other mirrors.
I think this would involve traversing fairly strong layers of security.

In terms of trusting the package authorship, in the Debian
system each package is signed with the GPG key of the package's
maintainer, or the maintainer's sponsor if the author has not
accumulated sufficient trust. I'm sure Karl has details/corrections...

I see lots of other answers but I use Linuxconf.  The latest version which 
Redhat Software in its infinite wisdom stopped supporting.  Jacques 
Gelinas the author keeps enhancing and expanding it.  There have been 
some problems with versions and software that keeps changing (sendmail is 
one offender) and there is the time Redhat shipped a 'poorly' implemented 
version of xinetd but Jacques kept plugging right along.  It is, IMNSHO, 
the best server configuration utiltity for the Redhat (RPM) derived 
distributions there is.  Text, GUI, or Web interfaces.  The GUI even works 
through a ssh tunnel.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0209111930240.16131-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  The vmware-3.1.1 upgrade is running well, but when I open the file manager
in the virtual windows machine it no longer sees the e:\ drive; actually,
/mnt/usr2/winstuff.

  I've gone through the network settings in win98 and followed the vmware
trouble-shooting web page for accessing a linux host from a Windows guest.
/etc/vmare/smb.conf has been modified according to their instructions.

  Isn't there a place in Windows where I can tell it to assign e:\ to
/mnt/usr2/winstuff? I've been through all the network stuff and the virtual
machine sees the linux host, but not the shared drive.

  I'd be very happy to resolve this off the list if someone more
knowledgeable than I in the ways of Microsoft will help me figure out what's
missing. I can provide all the information from the virtual-win98 network
setup dialog boxes and the /etc/vmware/ config files as well as the
/etc/smb.conf file.

Many thanks,

Dirk,

  You have two options: mount the ISO image as a loopback device or burn it
on a cd-r first. You can use 'cdrecord' without xcdroast (man cdrecord) and
it works just as well.

  Xcdroast is a GUI front end to mkisofs and cdrecord. It's nice but not
necessary. I can pass you the command line I've been using and it works very
well.

Couple of things come to mind.

	Is the mta running?
	
	Is the mail queue stuffed up?

	Can you send a message as root from that host independant of cron?

It looks like there is a hole in postfix. 

It appears that email is being sent with "Sender:

It seems that postifx is relaying this spam out.

Reading the docs and searching has not come up with a simple block.  Can

Let me also add that I'm not complaining at all about the hard work that

I'm merely suggesting that a search engine (even a google one, see the

easier and faster.

I only have a 478M / partition and 411 of that is in use. Thats why I
created the /tmp directory.

 I would then install a new harddrive, mount it to

So what I've really got is /home actually residing on the / partition
and I should just wipe /dev/hda10 and remake it as you stated above. I'm
not really sure but it appeared that when I made the /tmp partition
everything got transfered from / without me copying anything to the new
partition.

Ok! So now I think I understand what happened! <Lights come on> When I
mounted dev/hda10 (which was my original /home) I got to see all the
files that are still on there. Thats why I all of a sudden couldn't open
any programs and I keep getting out of space warnings when I attempt to
download a large file. home is now on / and there isn't enough space for
it all to coexist peacefully.

I understand that the partition was corrupted but I also thought that

So thats why / seems to have so much used space. Maybe I should clear a
few more windows partitions and make a few more directories to keep the
/ partition a little less crowded.

I have a RH 7.0 box that I can no longer run su - <user> from root to
change users.  Is there a bug?  Did a patch cause this?  Any idea?  It
just returns a prompt and if I exit I go back to the user I su to root as.
 I have used this in the past to get to some users accounts to test things
and now it appears as though it doesn't work anymore.
I do have a new 7.3 box and it works fine.

Thanks.

        Options ExecCGI
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
</Directory>

AddHandler cgi-script .py
AddType application/x-httpd-py .py

I then try to execute a simple python script: (~josh/cgi-bin/test.py)
#!/usr/bin/python2

print '''
Content-Type: text/html\n\n
<html>
<head>
<title>Hello there </title>

I get server 500 errors and the logs show:

Dirk,

The answer to your question depends to a large extent on the list of 
packages you've already installed (or not installed) on your system.

Do you remember when you were installing Red Hat and you were given a 
list of package groups from which to choose: Base, Printing Support, X 
Window System, etc.?

A good way to get an idea of what packages you may or may not need is 
to look at the "Software Development" package listing. You can do this 
by poking around disk 1. Look for RedHat/base/comps. It's just a text 
file, and it's fairly easy to understand (I think). Search down until 
you see the "Software Development" listing. It'll look like this:

  0 Software Development {
    ? X Window System {
      Glide3-devel
      ...
    }
    ? Printing Support {
      VFlib2-devel
      ...
    }
    ...
    autoconf
    autoconf253
    automake
    automake15
    ...
    zlib-devel
  }

The "? X Window System" line means, "if we're installing the X Window 
System package group, then install these rpms; otherwise, skip them." 
There are quite a few of those conditional blocks before you get to 
the base list of development rpms (starting with 'autoconf').

Anyway, that list from autoconf to zlib-devel ought to be a good 
starting point. Install those packages and work from there.

Good luck.

I don't know much python, so I may be way off the mark -- but my hunch 
is that your script is a literal '\n\n' string, not two newlines, in 
your Content-Type description. Try this:

  print '''
  Content-Type: text/html

  <html>
  ...
  </html>
  '''

  This morning I learned that pointing "sendmail" to postfix rather than
sendmail fixed all these mail problems. I've also learned it's part of Red
Hat's "alternatives" system which is not too well documented, I've been
told. This system permits the user (or SysAdmin, I suppose) to switch
between KDE and Gnome, CUPS and LRPng, sendmail and postfix. Probably other
things, too.

  The first I could understand, but I thought that most desktops/window
managers let the user switch at will in any case. But, I am at a loss to
understand why anyone would want to switch MTAs or printing systems. In my
ignorance and naivety I thought that you picked one and stuck with it.

  Just goes to show how little I really know.

Thanks, Keith,

Rich

  According to the amd man page it will automatically mount a filesystem
when a file on that system is requested for a read, write or execute. I have
already mounted all the filesystems here, and the transient devices of
floppy and cdrom, are mountable by users.

  Do I need amd running?

  I ask because I'm now seeing entries in /var/log/messages regarding
reloads of map /etc/amd.net and I've not seen those messages before.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0209120439030.20282-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I found the 'tzset' command and used that to specify Pacific Time Zone.
Then I put the TZ set string in ~/.bash_profile as well as for root and the
other user on the system here. That's all well and good.

  However, when I logged out and back in (so the new setting would take
effect from the re-reading of .bash_profile) and typed 'date' on the command
line, I saw that it was three hours behind the real time (I've ntpd running;
it's exactly 3 hours behind). But, when I start X and ask for the date in a
virtual terminal, it displays:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ date
Thu Sep 12 04:38:34 PDT 2002

  Correct time zone, wrong time. When I su I see this:

[root at salmo /home/rshepard]# /usr/sbin/hwclock -r 
Thu 12 Sep 2002 07:37:56 AM EDT  0.536746 seconds
[root at salmo /home/rshepard]# date
Thu Sep 12 07:38:06 EDT 2002

  Correct time, wrong time zone.

  What might be going on here?

Thanks,

Rich

Rich,

Check out /etc/sysconfig/clock. Mine says,

ZONE="America/Los_Angeles"
UTC=false
ARC=false

  Thanks, Paul. Mine was Tijuana rather than Los_Angeles.

  Does setting UTC=true set the time to that, but correct for the local time
zone?

  Now that I've changed this, how do I implement the changes?

Many thanks, again,

You set it to UTC=True if your hardware clock is set to UTC and you want
the operating system to account for that and subtract eight hours from
what the hardware clock reads to tell you what time it is.  How is that
for a long sentance?  :-)

Honestly, I don't know. I've never played with that setting.

Take a look at /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit. That's the boot script that, 
among other things, sets the time.

I think (but please verify this for yourself) that you'll want to

1. shut down ntpd

2. ensure that /etc/localtime == /usr/share/zoneinfo/US/Pacific; you 
   can copy the latter to the former if they differ

3. run "ntpdate" against a time server you trust

4. run "/sbin/hwclock --localtime --systohc" to get the hardware clock 
   in sync

5. restart ntpd

Try that also.  the \n do present new line returns.  That was one of the
issues with the bug from Apache I read.  Something about after the headers
there needs to be a new line.
The script runs fine from a command line.  It returns output that looks fine.

Of course...the Sun card goes for considerably more than $100...  Maybe

Same general idea, different implamentation.

That sun card is like having four 10/100 NICs in your computer.  The one
Keith mentioned is like having a hub soldered on to your single 10/100
NIC.

I'll bet the sun one runs a little faster with a little less CPU
utilization than the RTL-8139 chips, too.  :-)

Now... I gotta get me one of them Sun cards for my (home) server!  :-)

1) amd is only needed if you want to mount nfs filesystems by hostname
(i.e. if you want to mount /net/scratchy and it automatically mounts
scratchy:/, or /net/itchy and then it's itchy:/). Otherwise use autofs
2) amd is crap even for /net filesystems, if you need them, use autofs4
3) if you have everything mounted statically, you can uninstall all
automounters, both amd and autofs. Everything here includes floppy and
cdrom. If you want to be able to do ls /mnt/cdrom and it gets mounted, you
need an automounter, but that automounter should be autofs. Sounds
convenient, but it's a pain in the ass to get that CD ejected because you
need to convince the automounter to let you unmount it.

Subject: [PLUG] Mouse problems w/  XFree on Debian Laptop
Message-ID: <3D80BDF4.3000901@logiccloud.com>

So I recently installed Debian 3.0r0 on my Toshiba Satellite 315CDS and 
I was having some problems getting the mouse pointer to cooperate in 
XFree86 4.1.0.1.  Specifically, the mouse pointer will "freeze up" after 
about 15 seconds and will then move erraticaly and is generally 
unresponsive.  I have tried several different drivers in my XF86Config 
(mouseman, MSMouse and PS/2).  PS/2 is the only one that works properly, 
so I don't think its a driver problem.  Also, I have gpm setup and using 
the mouse in the console works fine.  And, it doesn't matter what window 
manager I use, Gnome, ICW-WM, XTerm (for testing), the mouse displays 
the same behavior.  I've looked at the output from XFree, and there are 
no warnings (WW) or errors (EE).  Now, I know this mouse works, because 
I had Redhat 7.2 installed on this laptop previously and it worked fine 
in X (using Windowmaker as my WM).  

So, my questions are:

1.  Is there some setting I am missing?  Maybe something Redhat 
installed by default that debian didn't?

2.  Is X4.1.0.1 the latest debian package?  I noticed x4.2.1 was out on 
www.xfree86.org.  I did an apt-get update XFree86.  How can I tell what 
version of X has been .deb'ed?

3.  I am assuming that X is turning off GPM... could this be a possible 
problem or conflict?

Thanks

Rob,

  This is what I thought and what I want. I didn't see an option to hwclock
to set the time zone. Well, ... forget the Hardware Clock, that's not the
one that matters anyway.

  I've just reread both 'man date' and 'info date' and cannot see an example
of how to set the timezone properly. When I type the date command I get the
proper time -- but in the EDT zone -- and my desktop clock show 3 hours
earlier.

  How to I get the system clock to recognize that we're in the Pacific time
zone?

Thanks,

Rich

Message-ID: <20020912092155.9358.h009.c001.wm@mail.hilsy.com.criticalpath.net>

I am running RH 7.0 on my laptop as my primary computer
at law school at Lewis & Clark (just up the road from
you guys at Riverdale).
Computer services has been screwing around with the
subnet in different parts of the campus. When they
change the subnet address I am unable to connect. One
student helper in the department suggested that I
needed to do:
ifconfig -release
ifconfig -renew

However, in searching around my file system and running
man ifconfig I do not find -release or -renew as an
option. My gut feeling from looking around is I will
have to do something with dhcpd.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank You

a simple:
print "Content-Type: text/html\n\n"
should work fine...

No: timezone files are binary. You ought to be able to use diff to 
tell if the files are the same, e.g.,

  diff /etc/localtime /usr/share/zoneinfo/US/Pacific

If they are different, it'd be worth trying 

  diff /etc/localtime /usr/share/zoneinfo/US/Eastern

just to make sure that your current EDT timestamp is the result of an 
understandable error.

If you want to be in the Pacific timezone (not necessarily a given: I
know you folks out in Gresham have weather patterns the differ
somewhat significantly from those in the rest of the Willamette and
Columbia valleys, so maybe a new timezone is appropriate too :-), then
just

  cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/US/Pacific /etc/localtime

and go ahead with the process I outlined in an earlier message.

I'm questioning the combination of the two (apt-rpm), but in general
the use of automated downloads and installs.

Tyler's answer pointed out the use of MD5 sums, but for apt-rpm I think
there's only 1 repository (freshrpms.net) so it's a single point of
potential attack.

  Wow! That's magnificent, Paul! It worked like a charm.

  I copied the binary /etc/localtime to a backup form, put the string
'/usr/share/timezoneinfo/US/Pacific' in it and followed the rest of the
instructions. The only part that was slightly disconcering was running
'/usr/sbin/npdate npt.nasa.gov' and having the entire screen instantly go
black -- no cursor or anything. Then, of course, it came back up and all's
right again with the world.

  Wadda' hassle! I've no idea how it got clobbered the way it did.

Many thanks,

Rich

In /etc/sysconfig, there's a file called 'clock'. In that file, is the 
following:

$ cat clock
ZONE="America/Los_Angeles"
UTC=false
ARC=false

I believe this is were the clock gets set during boot, in relation to 
the hardware clock. If you have the hardware clock set to UTC, make sure 
that's "true" instead of "false".

  Thanks very much. I suppose that I slightly understood what they did, but
now I understand much more. They're now shut off.

  You have two options: mount the ISO image as a loopback device or burn it
on a cd-r first. You can use 'cdrecord' without xcdroast (man cdrecord) and
it works just as well.

Does the loopback device allow me to install the 3rd.iso directly from the hdd onto the same hdd, negating the need to burn a 3rd CD?

That sounds like windows gobbledeguk.
I assume you're using a DHCP client,
try
$ service network restart


There's more fine-grained ways to accomplish this, but since it's a laptop 
you probably won't uspet too many users.

Not suprising. The web site has been pretty broken for a long time.  Many 
people have stopped looking there at all because of the delays.

> Is there a way I should have known about this prior to asking on the list?

Asking is about the only way you will find out.

Now since I am only going from the title, I am assuming you were wanting 
information on DVD players for Linux.

The best so far is Xine.  It is kind of a pain to set up.  There are RPMs 
available, but they require the aalib RPMs, which are not standard on most 
distributions.  (Which is a shame because they are kind of cool.)

You need the decss libraries and the dvdread libraries. Those can be 
found with the RPMs for Xine.  (Look around at 
http://xine.sourceforge.com/ for external links. One of them will send you 
to the site with the proper RPMs.

If you have a problem, drop me an e-mail.

Well, when using pgp, you're using a public/private keypair. What this 
means is that (in theory) the only way to trojan the files would be to 
get the key Redhat uses to sign the RPMs they release. The key we have 
to verify the signature can only verify, it can't create.

  Actually, I'm in Troutdale which is closer to eastern Oregon than to the
Portland. There's a sign at the city limits that reads, "Welcome to
Troutdale. Please set your watch back 50 years."

  Aha! I hadn't looked in the Pacific file. That's binary, too.

  Whew!

  As I wrote before, this upgrade has been an absolute nightmare compared
with everything I've gone through before. I do hope that's the end of it --
except getting VMware running properly again. Gotta' go reconfigure it for
the sixth time. Sigh.

We received an ad the other day for a hub (maybe it was a switch) that fit
in the wall where the normal jacks go.  It was aimed at places like
schools and labs where they wanted to expand their network capacity with
out spending a lot of money.  So in the best case you could use it to
quadrupal the number of network jacks without pulling any cable.
Interesting idea...

Dirk,

  Yup.

  Here's an example line to get you started:

mount -o loop,ro image_name /mnt

  Now you can copy from your read-only image on /mnt to whereever you want.

Nice.  I like it.  I have one suggestion though.  Is it possible to have
it remove non-unique entries?  ie. only one message from each thread since
you can navigate to the other messages.  Of course not everyone would like
this, so it should be an easily changed variable...

Thanks,

Yes, /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit sets this during boot.

I found all of the Xine stuff I needed at:

http://valhalla.freshrpms.net/

The only tricky part was learning that I needed to hit the "D5D" or "D4D"  
button in Xine instead of "DVD".  ;-)

I found the VideoLAN client (http://www.videolan.org/) to be painfully
simple to set up, but I've also heard horror stories from other folks.  
I'd say to give it a try and if it doesn't work easily, don't spend too
much time making it work.

I thought I saw something like that a year ago or so, but I was
under the impression it was simply a hub or switch, with no way
to use it as a network card. If it shows up as 4 separate NICS, that
would be very useful! Anybody know more about this?

I use Debian which has had alternatives for quite some time.  If Redhat's
implementation is the same, setting alternatives is basically just setting
the default applications/window-manager for the entire system.  All of the
settings can still be changed by the individual users.

That's ok.  I have now tried the following:

print "Content-Type: text/html\n\n"
print "hello"


and it still gives me the same error.  Also I do have this working fine on
my windows apache and python.  I would just want to move it to my Linux
server.  I think everything is correct.  I can run ./test.py at the prompt
and it runs fine.  I just don't understand it all.  GGrrrr.
Thanks for the suggestions.  Still need to find the way to just get a
simple cgi to execute.

Sounds like it is the other way around, Debian installed gpm, RH didn't.

Incorrect assumption, in this case, both gpm and the X-server are trying
to read from the same device at the same time.  The fix is easy, you
just need to set up the X-server to read from /dev/gpmdata instead of
/dev/psaux.  If you allowed debconf to handle your X-server
configuration, then I think the command to reconfigure the X-server is:

dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86

which must be run as root.

Good Luck

apt-get update && apt-get upgrade 
is prabably the easiest way to ensure X is at the latest version. I think
you are there though.

X does not turn off gpm, and that may be causing trouble. (try it and see).
There was a thread recently about gdm.. new.pdxlinux.org/search should help
you find it.

Slackware 8.0 users /vmlinuz and Slackware 9.0 (recnetly entered Beta)
uses /boot/vmlinuz if that helps.

I'm curious... why do you want such information?

Any ideas?

I was having completed connections earlier, but pacifier terminated
their contract with the Olympic Peninsula POPs; so I've had to find a
different number to dial. This connection is thru NCPLUS.net, which
supports windoze and OS/2 just fine, and I have shell access to a
linux system thru ssh (when I connect thru an ethernet port). They
don't know why it doesn't work for me, as others connect just fine;
and they have no linux tech's handy to assist.

I'd really like to get this fixed, as the dialup is $9/month
unlimited, and the ethernet is $1.50/hour.

TIA,

In theory you could also introduce your trojan in such
a way that the modified rpm hashes to the same value. While not yet
practical for MD5, such techniques for eliciting collisions and
pseudo-collisions have been shown:

This was to a console not XDM, KDM, or any other of the same type? You are
booting into run level 3? 

Are you using Xfce 3.8.14? I see the same issue ( different apps not OO ) on a
box at work running Xfce 3.8.14 and restarting X seems to work. Current is
3.8.16 so maybe an upgrade will solve the issue. 

Thank you

Subject: [PLUG] Mozilla:  POP poll broken; setting mail compose font
Message-ID: <3D80DD5E.8040204@truedisk.com>

I recently made Mozilla (1.0.0) my default MUA at work, and now
am experiencing a couple of glitches:

1) After configuring multiple mail accounts, automatic polling of my
   POP account for new messages ceases to work.  It's happened on a
   couple of different setups.

   A possible clue is that this seems to coincide with the creation
   of an IMAP account.  (I haven't tested this rigorously -- just
   wondering if others have had this problem.)

   Under the "Server Settings", I've set "Check for new messages every
   '11' minutes", and this value is set in the prefs.js
        user_pref("mail.server.server1.check_time", 11);

2) When I compose mail, the compose window always defaults to a
   proportional font.  I'd like it to just use Courier (and stop
   messing with my formatting.  Any tips?

Thanks,
- Don

As I understand it, the kernel install procedure is controlled by a
script called /sbin/installkernel.  The script is called by a kernel
"make install", but the script is provided by the distribution or
(naturally) the system administrator.  If you want, I can mail you a
copy of Debian's (it is only 56 lines long with comments).

Be sure to remove those TZ=... entries from your profile.  It's very
unusual to be messing with TZ in any of the shell startup files.

BTW, the screen went black because the screensaver kicked in due to a 
big time step.  Whenever you adjust the system time, beware
of cron funnies.  In past it could get confused when the time was stepped.
Current versions may not have this problem.  I usually stop and restart
cron after any system time adjustment.

It works fine here.  I have used it quite extensively to run cross tools
for various microcontrollers.

BTW, the latest versions of Freedos have a working network redirector.
This was the only thing preventing me from wiping Microsoft off my box
entirely.  I hope to try it soon.  If it works, my MSDOS image will be
history.


I recently tried to install some Windows-hosted cross tools using Wine.
Unfortunately, the installer (InstallShield, I think) need stdole32.tlb,
and wine doesn't have a native version of it.  I would need to have 
licensed version of W95 or W98 to legally use Microsoft's file.

Galen,

It's for a book I'm writing. In a lab exercise, the reader must
know the name and location of the kernel file. The reviewers
think that it's not enough to tell the reader that it's most
often in the /boot directory and frequently has a name that
starts with "vmlinuz". They'd like a list of the names for
various distributions. 

This is the kind of book where you must tell the reader to press
Enter after every command. I'm beginning to think the book should
come with crayons and coupons for a Happy Meal.

  Stay tuned for details at 11. My PC-DOS image is sitting on a hard drive
on the file cabinet now. I'll have a go at Freedos and let you know how it
works.

  Bummer! Is there a way to copy the files from the cdrom to a vfat
partition and install from there? Or, is it the same problem regardless?

So there will be a color-in boot process chart? Maybe cron? There should 
also be a vi shortcut placemat, if you're gonna go the happy meal route. 
On second thought, maybe the placemat could be double sided with common 
commands. You're the author, you make the call.

For RH 7.1 and 7.3, RedHat has been creating the symlink:
    vmlinuz -> vmlinuz-2.4.yy-zz  
inside of /boot.

It makes their 'up2date' process simpler, I think.  Since they
don't have to modify /etc/lilo.conf (7.1) or /etc/grub.conf (7.3)
since the config files use "/boot/vmlinuz" to refer to the kernel.

This machine isn't licensed to run Windows, so I can't legally use
Microsoft files.  If it was licensed, I could just copy the files I
need from another machine.  I'm sure at some point wine will have
its own replacement, since InstallSheild is used by so many people.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0209121552200.25117-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I've another problem here, and it's linux related 'cause it involves wine
running on RH 7.3 with glibc-2.2.

  I bought a copy of WordPerfect Office/2k and installed the minimal mount
of packages. However, wordperfect won't fire up over wine because it needs
the Bitstream fontastic font twiddler. And the two rpms for fontastic are
for glibc-2.0 and 2.1; not 2.2. When I try to install the package, I'm told
that a file in there conflicts with one from chkconfig. Stange, but true.

  Is there a way to disassemble the package and remove the offending file? I
think that if I can massage this with sufficient knowledge I'll be able to
again access all my wp files. And I do need to do this.

  The Corel installation appears to not mind that there's a newer version of
wine installed (I installed the CVS package from last Monday). If I can
resolve this fontastic issue I'll have a working application again. I think.
Apparently, trying to get WP/8 working -- even with glibc-5 installed -- is
a lost cause.

  Thanks,

Rich

Am I the only person who failed to receive mail from the PLUG list for
several hours yesterday? (My gap runs from about 12:45 pm to a little
after 06:00 am this morning.) I'm also missing a few emails from
today . . . no idea how big of a gap there.

I don't think the problem lies with my local mailserver, since I
received mail with an interruption all day yesterday  & today.

Can the mail admin (whoever is doing that chore) take a look at the
logs & see if the mail was bouncing at my address?

I'd consider doing this a guarrantee that the reader would get
something of value from this book. And remembering all of the
computer books I have bought over the years, this action would
guarrantee this book would be more useful than some of them were.

There is a danger of "over fitting" the description though,
particularly if what is being described is volatile.  It might easily
be _worse_ to have detail that turns out to be wrong than to not have
the detail.

This is actually a omnipresent hazard of putting _anything_ about
Linux onto dead trees.

[snip]

I have WP/8 working on one of my systems running the current Debian stable
(Woody).  The only problem I had with it was that it would seg-fault
everytime I tried to fire it up after the initial upgrade to Woody.  After
much hair pulling and assorted incantations of a four letter variety :-)
I realized that it was failing because it couldn't find some font or fonts
it apparently requires.  Eventually, I discovered and tried the
"-useISOFonts" command line option, for starting the program and it has
worked fine ever since.  Interestingly, it only seems to require the
"-useISOFonts" option some of the time, the rest of the time it fires up
without the option.  ldd command shows the following library dependencies
for the main program (xwp):

	libXt.so.6 => /usr/i486-linuxlibc1/lib/libXt.so.6 (0x40015000)

Shannon,

  That's exactly what it did to me!

  Thank you, my friend. That's worth a _lot_! For some reason, I don't think
of running ldd on the binary to see what it needs. Here's what mine shows:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ ldd /usr1/wp8/wpbin/xwp
        /lib/libNoVersion.so.1 => /lib/libNoVersion.so.1 (0x40014000)
        libXt.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libXt.so.6 (0x4002a000)
        libX11.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6 (0x40076000)
        libXpm.so.4 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so.4 (0x4014b000)
        libm.so.5 => /usr/lib/libm.so.5 (0x4015a000)
        libc.so.5 => /usr/lib/libc.so.5 (0x40162000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/i686/libc.so.6 (0x42000000)
        libSM.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libSM.so.6 (0x4022c000)
        libICE.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libICE.so.6 (0x40234000)
        libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x4024b000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.1 => /lib/ld-linux.so.1 (0x40000000)

  So, I'll make sure all the libs are where the program is looking for them,
and I'll try your command line switch, too.

  Another valuable lesson reinforced.

Thanks,

I've been watching, and the open market value of the Sun QuadFastE (used) on
eBay is around $175...  SBUS, of course....

The $100 4 port PCI card doesn't seem like much of a bargain if it is in
fact a hub, since one could get a pretty reliable NIC card and 8 port hub
(10MB/100MB) together for around $60...  Although the extra Cat5 cable to
link the two will run you around $25 at Best Buy :-)

I use MPlayer (the cvs snapshot is usually quite good
-- nothing 
pre-0.95
is worthwhile for DVDs in my opinion).  It's pretty
freakin' stable.

The dvdnav library appears to be sought by the
configure script, but I
haven't determined whether or not MPlayer can actualy
use it.

I also use Ogle, which fully supports DVD menu
navigation.  However, my
experience with Ogle is that it is slightly unstable,
a little bit slow
sometimes, and can just halt in the middle of a scene
and not recover, 
all
the while displaying a single frame of the video
without error.

I know zip about wvdial, but entirely to much about pppd.  What you really
need here is the raw character output of this session so you can see what
wvdial actually sees.  You might check if there is an option to wvdial
which will output all of the character I/O which it was involved in.  This
will tell you if wvdial is responding correctly to the prompts that it
sees and is behaving correctly up to the point where it starts pppd.
If this doesn't solve the problem, next you will want to look at what
happens during the ppp session, you can capture this using the "record"
option for pppd (see pppd manpage).  How you set this depends on how
wvdial operates, but normally it would be placed in the configuration file
for your ISP in the directory (possibly distribution specific)
/etc/ppp/peers  Once you have run with the record option, you could
examine the file specified by the record option using the pppdump command
(usually with the -p option), though if I remember right, I think ethereal
understands this format and may give an even more readable rendition of
the data in the capture file.

My guesses as to what might be happening are:

1-Your initial login is failing, so you are effectively dead when wvdial
  drops you into ppp.  This would imply that wvdial is not responding to
  the correct prompts, or that your username/password are configured
  incorrectly.  I was not entirely clear from what you said whether or not
  you were trying to log in to your old pacifier account through a third
  party pop, or if you just switched ISP's, if it's the former, then your
  problem may be that you aren't using the right login id, since third
  party pop login's generally require the name of the ISP you are
  connecting to and are likely to want a login name of

       asavage at pacifier.com

  or something similar.


2-The ISP wants to authenticate within the ppp session using PAP and you
  are not correctly configured for PAP authentication, however, the
  information you gave above seems to indicate that a text mode login was
  performed prior to starting pppd, and (so far) I've never seen an ISP
  require performing the same authentication twice, once before the
  session and once from within it.

Hope this helps.

I'm having some problems regarding my mail attachments filtering.  Below is
the I line I have from body_checks

/^.*name=".*\.(pps|com|sys|vbe|vbs|vb|cmd|scr|bat|pif|exe|shs)"/	REJECT

this filtering sometimes fails. Most of the time it rejects files with this
attachments, but at some instances it fails to rejects files with these
attachments especially the EXE  and PPS files. Anyone who can enlighten me
this one.........

Since apache doesn't have a shell.  /etc/passwd has /usr/false I can't su
to that user.  I did change it and have apache run the script and it is
fine.
I have also tried to run this as my user.  I can run the script at a
command prompt fine but apache can't.
I tried this again on windows and I do not have a problem.  I'm thinking
that the version of python on the linux is causing the problem.  That or
the version of Apache.  That is the only difference.  I have 1.3.22 apache
and 2.2.1 Python.  on linux.
1.3.26 Apache and 2.1 and 2.2.1 python on windows.

Suggestions?  Has anyone tried this?

As always thanks for any help.

Your regex is case sensitive.  Anything in upper case will get past it.

Xine uses the Ogle DVD navigation.  

Is there still active development on Ogle? I thought the project kind of 
merged with Xine.

I don't know much about mail filters, but if it's
Linux or UNIX based you might be able to use regular
expressions, eg /\.[Ee][Xx][Ee]/ (I'm sure there's a
better regex for that). HTH

I've seen for years a Windows application (I think it's called/based on
WebShots).  What was really neat was it or an additional program that came
with it let you place a calendar, in various formats, on you desktop.  
 The last desktop I saw it on had last months, this months and next months 
calendar in theupper right corner.  Last and next months were smaller 
while the current months was larger.  Looked very handy in comparison to 
opening jpilot or another calendar program when a date was needed. 

I've done some searching using google but haven't found anything similar
for the X Window System.  Did I miss it or is it an opportunity?

  I've not checked to be certain, but I believe that the 'i' switch at the
end of the regex is supposed to make it case insensitive. At least, in
postfix regex.

Has anyone used O'Reilly's safari system?  Is it economical?  Is it nice?
What do you people think of it?

I noticed that my machine was experience an unusal slowness, so
naturally I went to top to see what was up.

A process running as Apache was running a command ".bugtrac" (initial
period) and it was eating up all the CPU.

Does anybody know what this is?  When I locate "bugtrac" I get nothing
and google was not very helpful.

Ugh! I just read on a security mailing list a post from someone with a
compromised machine who had a bunch of processes named bugtrac or
bugtraq.

You may be in trouble. Do you know what kinds of things to look for in a
possible compromise situation?

I think it depends on the codec used to create the WMV (or WMA).  As far
as I know, nothing but Winblows Media Player will play the WMP v.7 and
v.8 encoded files.  However, mpeg encoded files still end up with the
same extension, when Winblows Media Player creates them (good thing
linux doesn't really care about extensions).  Then there is the whole
"personal protection" thing, which even Winblows Media Player may not be
able to deal with.

No, I don't.  The logs don't immediately show anything, but I am not
sure what to look for.

I have an IPChains firewall up, but of course port 80 is open for the
web server.

Subject: [PLUG] Forcing numbering of ethernet interfaces?
Message-ID: <200209131634.g8DGYJu29863@shell1.aracnet.com>

I think I know the answer to this which is "You can't do it" but
I'll ask anyway.

Got a machine running Red Hat 7.3 with three ethernet interfaces,
two on the PCI bus and one on the USB bus. The USB NIC is coming
up as eth0 and the PCI NIC's are coming up and eth1 and eth2.
We'd really rather have the PCI NIC's as eth0 and eth1 with the
USB NIC as eth2. This would make it consistent with the numbering
you get if you plug in the USB NIC after system boot. Is there a way
to force this?

Two ideas have come up so far. One was to try and force it via
alias settings in /etc/modules.conf and then disabling kudzu to
make sure it doesn't get modified during boot. This didn't do it.

The second idea which we've not tried yet is to build a kernel
with the PCI NIC drivers built in, but leave the USB NIC driver
built as a module. The non-module drivers ought to initialize
first thus giving them first shot at the interface numbers.

Any other ideas?

I've had ogle just completely lock the entire video subsystem. The only 
thing that works at that point in X is the mouse. But that only moves. 
To recover, I have to ssh in from another machine, kill X and then log 
back in. Killing ogle wasn't enough to recover.

You should be able to use the -c parameter of su to run a command. As root:

Some of the things you might want to do:

Do an "lsof -i" as root, and save the output. This will tell you what
processes are bound to which tcp & udp ports. See if those bugtrac
processes are actually listening to any ports.

Do a "find /dev -type f -print" to see if there are any regular files
(with the possible exception of a MAKEDEV script) that shouldn't be
under /dev.

If you have something like a distribution install cd, put it in and mount it,
and use the executables from it rather than ones that might have been
trojaned on your machine.

Do a "ps aux" with your possibly suspect installed version of ps, and
then do an "ls /proc". Compare the pids from your ps with the ones in
/proc. There will be a couple different ones, as the pid of your ps and
of your ls will be different, but any others that are missing from the
"ps" but are in /proc will tell you that your ps command is trojaned.

Run nmap from a different machine, or have someone do it for you, and
do a full port scan of your machine.

I'm not saying that you've definitely been rooted, as it may be that
those bugtrac processes are just a red herring and belong to a
legitimate package. I wish I hadn't deleted the mailing list post that
I'm recalling, but it would probably have been from one of the
securityfocus.com mailing lists.

Were you able to use ctl-alt-bkspace to restart X instead of having to ssh
in?

When the same thing happened to me, I tried that a bunch of times.  It
didn't seem to do anything.  I think I even hit Num Lock and the light
didn't change.   Seems like one of the times I was able to keep hitting
things and waited about 10 minutes and I got some control back.  Enough to
kill the process.  But usually I just reboot.  I'm using ext3 and it is a
desktop machine so no harm in an occasional reboot.

The only reason I use ogle is that when it isn't crashing it is the only
one that plays dvd's without performance/a-v sync problems.

Seems like this has a pretty good chance of working.  The only other
option I can think of is to disable initrd, and have the modules load in
the order you want, not through aliases, but through the /etc/modules
file.

Subject: bugtraq.c httpd apache ssl attack



I am using RedHat 7.3 with Apache 1.3.23. Someone used the 
program "bugtraq.c" to explore an modSSL buffer overflow to get access to 
a shell. The attack creates a file named "/tmp/.bugtraq.c" and compiles it 
using gcc. The program is started with another computer ip address as 
argument. All computer files that the user "apache" can read are exposed.
The program attacks the following Linux distributions:

Red-Hat: Apache 1.3.6,1.3.9,1.3.12,1.3.19,1.3.20,1.3.22,1.3.23,1.3.26
SuSe: Apache 1.3.12,1.3.17,1.3.19,1.3.20,1.3.23

I've seen the same freezing behavior with xine, which I guess makes
sense as it uses ogle.  keyboard+mouse+video freeze completely.

Subject: [PLUG] bash / find question
Message-ID: <20020913185442.A94D717902@medulla>

I can't seem to find the right permuation  to get
the `find ... -exec ... \;' to work in general.

If I do something like:

  find $DIR -type f -exec $COMMAND $ARGS {} \;

it works just fine.


But I can't figure out how to do  a shell operation like,
say, output redirection _within the -exec command block_.
N.B.: I'm not interested in re-directing the output of `find'
to a file.  That's easy.

To be specific suppose I want, on each instance of the command w/in
the -exec block,  to output something to a file named {}.foo.

How do I do this?  I've tried the obvious (but wrong)

  find $DIR -type f -exec $COMMAND $ARGS {} > {}.foo \;

I've tried escaping the redirection thus:

  find $DIR -type f -exec $COMMAND $ARGS {} \> {}.foo \;

I've tried also (and only) escaping the  {}  (which
I normally never escape).

And I've tried double quoting  various substrings of

         $COMMAND $ARGS {} > {}.foo

Now I'm going to try asking you.

What is the general form of the stuff following -exec
when you have pipes, multiple cammands &c.

Thanks.
Dean

Stafford;

I just performed research on this. Here's your answer:

This attack is a variation of the GOBBLES exploit and affects Apache servers thro ugh v. 1.3.26 according to this sight:

  http://packetstorm.decepticons.org/filedesc/apache-worm.c.html
  
As this is a variation of a known exploit, it was effectively fixed by the Apache team before it was created; the exploit was closed on 21 June 2002 with Apache v . 1.3.26. 

Very Truly Yours,

Here's more on the ssl worm, and a request from a guy at

Ok,

The incident analysis team over here is examining this thing.  At first
glance it looks reasonably sophisticated.  Looks to me like it exploits
the issue described as BID 5363, http://online.securityfocus.com/bid/5363.
It seems to pick targets based on the "Server:" HTTP response field.
Mario Van Velzen proposed a quick workaround of disabling ServerTokens or
setting it to ProductOnly to turn away at least this version of the exploit
until fixes can be applied.  Another thing to note is that it communicates
with its friends over UDP / port 2002.

I'd like to request IP addresses of hosts that have been compromised or
that are currently attacking systems from anyone who is comfortable
sharing this information.  We wish to run it through TMS (formerly
known as ARIS) to see how quickly it is propagating.

Booting without initrd is not an option. This is SCSI-based system.
But you give me an idea. Can I make a custom initrd that makes things
come out in the right order?

Why can't you build the SCSI drivers into the kernel?  Works well for my
SCSI based systems.

I don't know if this can be done or not.

Yes you could make a custom initrd which would allow you to preload
modules in the desired order before the system boots.  I don't know how
Red Hat handles this, but on Debian all that is necessary is to modify the
file /etc/mkinitrd/modules to specify the modules you want to load, then
reconfigure or reinstall the initrd kernel image and run lilo (or whatever
your preferred boot loader is).  It might also be necessary to modify
/etc/mkinitrd/mkinitrd.conf to ensure that the module you need is included
in the initrd image before reconfiguring the kernel installation.

So, simple enough, I upgrade my Apache, but should I be concerned about

What do I do about it?  Do I reinstall and if so, why would that make a

I use it.  It's very nice if you have lots of time to kill and want to
learn something.  (Unfortunately, I fear that there are lots of folks out
there right now with too much time to kill.)

The $10/month subscription is a great way to try it out.  Even if you only
read one book that month, you'll come out ahead.  For $40/month you could
get a decent online reference library going-- but the economics of that
get a bit rough.  It seems to be more economical if you "churn" the books
more by removing access from old books and adding in new ones.

One hint: always keep one slot free for that book you simply MUST add on
short notice.  With their bookshelf system you can always add a book, but
can only remove books every 30 days.  I clear it out monthly and often end
up adding in the same books-- but not always.

Their anti-spidering code is pretty sensitive.  Don't try any direct URL
mods or you'll probably trigger it.  Some caching proxies will trigger it
as well.  They've been pretty understanding with me since I respond to
each E-mail I get on it with an "oops!, sorry", but they ARE watching, and
I suspect if these E-mails are ignored they'll close the account.

It also seems to be quite alternative-browser friendly.  (Works with
Konqueror 3.0)

The cons:
  + Online only, if your net is down, so is your book access
  + HTML format has its limits

And a BIG BIG warning:

YOU WILL GET SPAM as a result of signing up with Safari.  I'm still
tracking down how this happens, but in the meantime I highly suggest that
you use http://www.sneakemail.com to generate a unique E-mail only for
Safari.

All in all, a GREAT service, and one well worth checking out.

I would look at minicom or C-Kermit.

Minicom can be twitchy since it defaults to trying to talk to a modem.  If
you turn off all the init strings in the config it makes a pretty decent
dumb terminal.

  You can speak many languages to a serial port: C-Kermit, C, perl, python,
and -- quite often -- good, ol' English cursing. The port understands them
all.

Okay, I need to upgrade OpenSSL but it also sounded like it would best
to upgrade Apache as well or is the OpenSSL upgrade part of that.

Look, maybe it is time to upgrade to RH7.3, but will that leave me
vulnerable?  Should I do a clean install or will an upgrade be okay.

If the thing is running as Apache, then it shouldn't have access to a
whole lot, right?  Or am I being naive?

find will only replace the first occurrence of {} with the "found" file, so
you have to write a script of sorts:


$ find $DIR -type f | \
	while read file \
		do $COMMAND $ARGS "$file" > "$file".foo \
	done

(that is all one command)

I just pulled the above out of "Unix Power Tools" and haven't tested it, so
you should :)

I imagine something like this would work also:

$ find $DIR -type f -exec FILE={} && $COMMAND $ARGS $FILE > $FILE.foo \;

I am not sure that upgrading OpenSSL will make a difference.  I am
currently running 0.96-6 which appears to be the latest version.

I also found this on securityfocus.com:

"Wouldn't it be easier to create a blank /tmp/.bugtraq.c file, chmod
000,
owned by root?

So, I created the file as suggested, at least until I upgrade the
system.

You'll want to upgrade Apache as well because every version that's shipped
with RedHat (even up to 7.3) is vulnerable to the chunk encoding stack
overflow vulnerability.

Correct.  The worm wouldn't have root access, but it can still infect
other computers and be used in DDoS attacks, for example.

This would have to be characterized much better in order to start
troubleshooting it.  Do other apps download slow as well (like ftp or
sftp)?  What does ifconfig show for the ethernet device?  What is the
ethernet device?

In general, the default settings for Winblows is designed for dial-up
connection speeds, and you're lucky if it responds well to cable speeds,
linux defaults are usually geared to ethernet communication, and almost
always respond well to cable speeds.

Give us more to go on.

That command still returns nothing to me.  Odd.  I just don't get anything
back.  Maybe the problem with running python.  If it has a valid shell it
works at the command but still not from the server.  If no shell then the
below command will not work also.

I hope Paul is reading this thread...

If you're looking for a way to fund some of your activities, make
that digital photography class and/or its materials available.

I'd love to learn some of the basics of photo manipulation using the
Gimp, and Grokking the Gimp only teaches mechanics, not theory.  (I'd
rather have it for free, but I'm willing to pay for a good cause.)

I'm trying to get Nessus to run.  I installed the nessus vulnerability
scanner, but I'm unable to start the nessus daemon. I found it in
/usr/local/sbin where it has 755 for permissions.  I'm logged in as su root.
bash told me that "bash: nessusd: command not found".  And I can start the

What do you think is going on here?

So, being anxious by the threat and afraid of breaking my system, what is
the best path to upgrade?
Would prefer to upgrade with an rpm, but a few hours ago RedHat & RPMFind
did not have updated OpenSSH nor Apache rpms out yet.
Is it difficult to patch an existing RPM installtion?  Doesn't patching
require recompilation- something impossible from a binary-installed RPM? 
How well would installing the binary file available on apache.org play
with my already-installed rpm?
Thanks for the advice!

You don't have the root environment, you need to put a - between the su
and the root (like: su - root) to inherit the root environment.

OTOH, if you specify full path name, it will work
(like:/usr/local/sbin/nessusd).

  Do I understand correctly that you su'd to root, then invoked,
'/usr/local/sbin/nessusd' and it did not start?

  You were probably in your user directory -- even as root -- and
/usr/local/sbin is not in your user $PATH.

You also have to generate a client cert with "nessus-mkcert".

Rich,

I'm confused and haven't used linux for a long time.  I installed nessus as
root and the permissions are 755 with root as the owner.  I've also created
a user called user1 and created a passphrase for user1.  How should I run
nessus from here?  Should I run as root or as root and su to user1 or run it
as user 1?

Thanks,

Jim

Use 'rhn_register' to register your box w/ RedHat.

Then use 'up2date' to update all RPM's to the latest version
RedHat has released for your distribution.

Jim,

  Others can guide you as this; I don't even know what nessus is or is
supposed to do. However, I do know that when I su to root I still have my
user environment and must specify the full path name to have the program
run. That was the only point I was trying to make.

Good luck!

Good thing I already patched all the servers.  ;-)

Anyone know what this new worm looks like in a web access log on a

Well, I don't know if this is related to my bugtraq problems but now my
rpm database appears to be unusable.

At first it said it could not gain an exclusive lock, then it sent an
error, after doing the following:

mv Packages Packages-SAVE
db31_dump Packages-SAVE | db31_load Packages

And waiting 3 hours before killing the process which had taken up 97% of
the CPU, I am not getting any sort of response when I try to install
anything with rpm.  No error message, no nothing.  I obviously screwed
it up (even though it started out that way), but how do I go about
fixing it?

Obviously the other question is whether this has to do with the
intrusion in my system.

Nevermind.

I forgot that I could do a rpm --rebuild.

I did that and it works now, but I still wonder if the attack had
anything to do with its original corruption.

  I believe the command is, "rpm --rebuilddb", but check the man page. And,
when you get it working again, upgrade to rpm-4.

I have experience with DNS and Linux Firewalls.  I have done some work
with RedHat linux as well.  My own network is somewhat similar to the
setup you describe. I'm sure I could help.

You could probably find a kermit for linux, but minicom is more common.

Message-ID: <1031979354.32738.1278.camel@lana.manymoons.net>

Sigh!

I hate being cracked!

So, I am trying to upgrade OpenSSL and Apache.  

I am working with apache, and I upgraded to 1.3.26 (the RH up2date only
got me to 1.3.22, what a waste of time).

When I try and run it from /etc/init.d/httpd restart, I get the
following in the error log:

[Fri Sep 13 21:32:49 2002] [crit] (97)Address family not supported by
protocol: make_sock: failed to get a socket for address :: port 80

Google is no help, and I have tried to tweak the http.conf file that
came with the rpm and even tried my old one, but I get the same
results.  What does this mean and how can I fix it?

So far as I have noticed is the problem here is somewhere in your conf
file it lists an address that does not allow binding.  Sometimes the
0.0.0.0 address does wonkey things.

My sugestion would be to double check your IP addy and put that into
your conf file.

Yes, I've seen it too and thought it was clever. It apparently
modifies the background image once a day with the current calender,
highlighting events and the current day.

Has anyone on the list got any practical experience with using Toms
Root Boot floppy to copy large amounts of data over the network? I'd
like to use it to backup and restore copys of hard drives at work.
The included NFS client is simple to use, but has been unreliable for
me when copying over a gig of files at a time. Any tips? I'd like to
be able to replace Norton Ghost with dd piped through gzip over NFS
through a Toms Root Boot disk.  Has anybody had success with this?

Actually, you were sort of right.

There was no 0.0.0.0 in the conf file. I had thought of that already,
but you comment made me think that maybe it needed to be more specific. 
Sure enough, it was listing on port 80 but it I added my ip with the
port number it worked.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <1031988932.1413.1321.camel@lana.manymoons.net>

Thanks to all those who helped me figure out what was up with that
annoying bugtraq thing.

I have upgraded my Apache, and since the new version does not load the
module for openssl, I think I am okay.  (Makes me wonder why I needed to
upgrade that and not just diable openssl, but I am here now so what can
i do?)

I was not able, yet, to find an rpm that will upgrade my OpenSSL without
getting rid of libcrypto.so.2 which Evolution requires.  So, I am
staying with the same version of OpenSSL with the dummy of bugtraq in my
/tmp file (setting it to mode 000, so the intruder cannot place another
one or use it in any way).  I will continue to try and upgrade OpenSSL,
but right now I feel reasonably secure.

Anyway, just wanted to update you all and say thanks.

Tath si what was returned.  I have rw on the script for all and apache is
the owner of the httpd process running.
Thanks for the help.  I still have yet to figure it out.  The sad thing is
that I may just rewrite this in PHP to solve it for now.  But I really
wanted to learn more python and wanted to achieve it there.

I have half an answer. netpbm-9.24, pscal-1.15, xsetbg from xli-1.16, and I
think montage from ImageMagick-5.4.2


#!/bin/sh
pscal `date +%m" "%Y` |  pstopnm  |  pnmflip -r270  |  pnmtojpeg > cal.jpg
montage ( some magic here ) cal.jpg back.jpg dayback.jpg
xsetbg /pathto/dayback.jpg

The half I don't have is how to combine the background image I have on my
desktop ( back.jpg ) and the cal.jpg. I thought montage would work to combine
them. It would need to allow me to set the cal.jpg to some small size, say
100x100+0+0  ( top left corner of the root window ) on top of the 1024x768,
back.jpg. Anyone know if montage will do this and the command syntax needed? I
tried what I thought the man page specified without success.


A really simple way to do this would be to use cal from util-linux-2.11, date
from sh-utils-2.0 and root-tail. 

#!/bin/sh
cal > month.cal 
echo "" >> month.cal
echo"	    "`date +%D`  >> month.cal	 # need the spaces to alaign the date
in the middle  
root-tail -i 86400 -font -adobe-courier-medium-r-*-*-18-*-*-*-*-*-*-* -g
60x10+100+100  -color blue month.cal


You also could use xfclock with the noborder, staysonbottom, sticky,
windowlistskip options in xfce.

Thank you

  Packages built with the latest version of rpm won't install with an older
version. You lose nothing and gain more ability with newer packages.

Jon,

  You should be able to install the new version alongside the old version.
Upgrade and freshen replace what's there, install does not.

This looks as if apache is trying to bind to an IPv6 address. Odd. Do 
you have an IPv6 interface configured somewhere?

I believe that char-major-14 devices deal with sound. If it's any help, 
you can lookup the major and minor device numbers in the following 
file:

/usr/src/linux/Documentation/devices.txt

But then I would still have the old version there.  Doesn't that leave

Tony,

  That makes sense. When I installed 7.3 I explicitly told it to not install
any sound thingies because I have no sound card or speakers (other than the
built-in squeaker). However, a bunch of files were installed.

  There were two sound-<something> modules reported to be not found. I
aliased those out but don't know what to do about the char-major-14 device.

Thanks,

Rich

Jon,

  I'm certainly not the security expert here. But, I thought the exploit was
apache/openssl specific. If you've upgraded apache to the 2.x series, and a
non-vulnerable openssl version I would think that you'd not be exploitable.

  OTOH, if you need to run Evolution and that requires a less-evolved
library, I don't see how you'd be exposed to external exploits.

  I may well be wrong. If so, I'd certainly like to understand the flaw in
my logic.

Unless I'm missing something, I think you answered your own question here.
Can't you just add

  alias char-major-14 off

or

  alias char-major-14 null

to your modules.conf file?

  No, David. I was missing the understanding that I could specify
'char-major-14' there as well as more specific module names.

So I'm a  little late to the party again, but it looks like Redhat
backported the bugfix to 1.3.22, FWIW:

https://rhn.redhat.com/network/errata/errata_details.pxt?eid=1100

This is Red Hat's m.o. The rule seems to be that Red Hat will try to 
keep a package at a stable version number whenever possible. That 
means that if a security fix can be back-ported, it will be.

This is really nice for us who don't want to worry about whether our 
current config files will work with the next package that comes down 
the pike. Or whether other dependencies will be broken.

  Just out of curiosity, why aren't folks moving to apache-2.x? Does that
break existing scripts? I'm not running httpd here so I have no sense of the

A lot of useful software/modules do not yet work with Apache 2 (or are
somewhat difficult to configure at this point).  And besides, Apache 1.3
works great for most people right now so they don't have a big incentive
to upgrade.

I had the exact same problem when I switched my ancient Pentium laptop

X to read from /dev/gpmdata without success. I solved the problem by
eliminating gpm entirely. I don't seem to be missing it.

I need some help from anyone who is using Mandrake. I'm trying to build a
Mandrake RPM on RedHat, and I see that they have some extra macros defined
which I don't have.
Could someone e-mail me their /usr/lib/rpm/macros file from a recent
enough version of Mandrake, please? (assuming that's where they stashed
this file, but if not should not be hard to find from rpm -ql rpm where it
is)
Thanks,
Fedor

Dirk,

  Russia probably still has many of them and are poor enough that they'd
sell them for the right price. In this country, of course, we iconize
celebrities. Form over substance wins again.

ls -lh will do it.

Or the gnome file browser (nautilus, or gmc) will have some
windows-reminiscent method of gleaning the same info.

The wife is in Hawaii so I had a free moment. I replaced cal with gcal because
gcal will output months and highlights todays date. I don't think root-tail
works with KDE3, YMMV.	I didn't test the year end month rolls, i.e. current
month January or December, so  you might have to correct this if it is broken.
I think it works, just no guanantees.

http://www.gnu.org/directory/GNU/gcal.html
http://www.goof.com/pcg/marc/root-tail.html

You might have to play with the font size and then the geometery settings for
each root-tail to correct for your system. The colors might not work for you
either. This works for me using PWM window manager,  at 1600x1000, with a black
background.

I noticed that the email threading in the client I use, seems to be having
trouble with this list. It is never 100% on any list I'm on. It is seems more
like 60-70% that gets ordered correctly. I think I've started to notice that
only about 30-40% of the Plug threads seem to get ordered correctly. It may be
that I play more attention to this list, but it seems list specific. Is anyone
else seeing an issue?

yep, same here with Kmail 2.2. About 30-40% on any list. Knode, the 
newsreader, is even worse. I don't use threaded mode very much, so it doesn't 
bother me, but I would like a newsreader that threads correctly.

Subject: [PLUG] How does having a secondary MX work?
Message-ID: <34813.209.210.31.3.1032065012.squirrel@sparky.woo-hoo.com>

Hello,
I want to create a secondary MX server on a different box and diverse
network so that if my primary MX server is offline, the secondary will
receive mail for my one domain, hold onto it until the primary is back up,
and then deliver all that mail to the primary server.
Have gotten it almost working.  My primary MX works just fine, and if I
shutdown postfix on it, email to my address, the Internet quickly and
nicely sends the email to the secondary MX server which receives it for my
username on the secondary MX server.  That is where the mail stays until I
log on and check it, with pine for example.
1)  Should the secondary MX automatically send the mail to the primary MX
when the primary MX server daemon is restored?  In my testing, it has not.
2)  Must you have all the existing user accounts receiving mail on primary
MX server also exist on the seconary MX server?  In my testing, sending
mail to existing-user at primarymx if they do not have a local user account
on secondary MX server results in bounced with "user unknown".

Postfix is being used on both servers, Redhat 7.2 on primary and 7.3 on
secondary.  Am guessing I have simply not fully or properly configured
something in Postfix.  However have reviewed docs on postfix.org and don't
find something that seems to directly relate to these questions.

All advice is much appreciated!

Thanks

I don't know about your reading software, but at least part of the
problem is _posting_ software.  That is, when someone replies to a
mailing list message, but the reply does not include a "References:"
header line or even an "In-Reply-To:" line.  Without that information
in the message, a mail reader has no clue how to thread it, except a
very rough idea due to it probably having the same or similar subject
line.  I complained about a few subscribers MUA's (I think it was
Outlook) a few months ago on plug-talk.  It also didn't help that the
repliers weren't including much of any quotation in their replies.

If you find a disconnected thread, check the message headers and see
if there is a "References" or "In-Reply-To" line, and see if I am not
correct.

A man and a woman, he just met, are dancing at a bar. The woman asks the man if
he would slept with her for a million dollars. The man steps back, thinks about
it, and replies yes. They continue dancing. The woman asks a little later, 
"Would you slept with me for a dollar?" The man stops, steps back, and slaps
the woman. What kind of man do you think I am he cries. The woman answers,
"Well we have already determined that, now we're arguing price."

Sounds like your secondary mx server is configured as final destination
for your domain, rather than as a secondary mx.

If you want to set up "mail2.woo-hoo.com" as a secondary mx for the
"woo-hoo.com" domain, then in your postfix main.cf:

mydestination = $myhostname, localhost
# Note - don't include $mydomain or woo-hoo.com in mydestination!

relay_domains = $mydestination, woo-hoo.com

This says you'll rely mail for woo-hoo.com, but you're not the final
destination for it.

When your primary is down, mail for woo-hoo.com will queue up on the
secondary, but won't be delivered to local users in the mail spool file
or whatever (unless it's addressed to user at mail2.woo-hoo.com).

The mail will stay in the deferred queue on the secondary, and it will
keep trying to relay it on to your primary until the primary comes back
up and it can deliver it. Note that the longer your primary is down, the
longer the secondary will wait between attempts to deliver it up to a
configurable maximum, so don't get nervous when it doesn't deliver it
immediately when the primary comes back up.

You don't need to duplicate accounts on the secondary from the primary
this way.

As directed on page 30 I ran
$rpm -q mod_php4 to which I was told 'no such package installed.  I do, 
however, have php-4.1.2-7 installed.
Do I still need mod_php4? I found it at rpmfind.net. In fact I found all three 
above 'variations' of php-- php, mod_php and mod_php4.

I'm trying to set up my Linux box to convert analog tapes from my
camcorder to DVD. By now I have the capture, the compression, i.e. almost
everything, I can produce MPEG2 files ready to go on DVD. I also have a
DVD-burner supported by cdrecord-prodvd. But I can't find the information
on the little step in between: what to do with the mpeg files before they
can be put on DVD. Presumably I need to build some filesystem, put these
files there (I can look at the standard DVDs, they all have more or less
the same directory structure and standard names). Is there a document
somewhere which describes how to do it? Are there linux tools for it?

Subject: [PLUG] CD further burning
Message-ID: <3D844E94.3070908@writeme.com>

Hi all folks,

How to burn CDRW/CDR second time to add further data
===========================================

Speed - 4X

I have carried out following tests:

1)
If I un-check "Do not fixate after write" I am not allowed to burn the 
CDRW second time adding further data even if it not full.  When I tried 
to burn the CDRW second time an warning "Error writing tracks" popup

2)
If I check "Do not fixate after write" I can't read the CDRW in CD-ROM 
after burning.  In second time burning, the data already burnt on the 
CDRW will be erased. 

I have tried  check/un-check "Create multi session CD"  and   
check/un-check "Pad Tracks"

What will be the solution so that I can add further data to CDRW/CDR 
later if it is not full.

Thanks in advance.

Stephen Liu

Hmmm... I had hoped to do this in the next few months, but my search just
now turned up nothing native for linux to do this.  Surprising!

If you can go Win32, then this site:

http://www.vcdhelp.com/author.htm or http://www.vcdhelp.com/dvd.htm

will help.

Also consider purchasing the book "DVD Demystified"
(http://www.dvddemystified.com/) and read the FAQ
(http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html).  DVD authoring is tricky and
if you do it wrong, your DVD will work in some players, but not others--
which can be maddening if you're going to be bringing them with you to
relatives' houses.

So will your file system allow large files? reiserfs 3.5  doesn't  but 3.6
does. I don't know about large file support in other file systems.

  It certainly looks like I've been under a spammer DoS attempt this past
weekend. Has anyone else seen anything like this before?

  This flood started Friday and peaked Saturday; of course, Sunday's still
early. Well, I know that my postfix filters are working!

Hi All Folks,

Previously I came across a technical article in re of "Network installation

recollection where I could find it.

Could any folk on the list shed me some light.

Thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0209150850550.18153-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I've a wierd X Window System display situation that appeared last Friday
and so far no one's been able to figure out why. My other workstation has no
problems displaying the root window under Xfce-3.8.18 after the OS upgrade
to 7.3. Thursday evening I noticed a couple of errors by the X server that
were the same as the errors reported on the main workstation/server.
Spcifically, that the '-bpp' option has been deprecated and '-depth' should
be used instead. Also, in the XF86Config file, references in the monitor and
screen section to 32 bpp should be replaced with references to 24 bpp.

  These changes were made on one box wtihout a problem, on the other one,
however, after I made those changes and restarted X, the root window does
not display properly. It's a series of vertical columns, each with thin,
black and white horizontal bands. The Xfce control panels, virtual
terminals, the GIMP main menu and so on all display properly, it's only the
root window that's trashed. Doesn't matter if I change the xfce background,
either. Same problem persists. I have a couple of .jpg screenshots that show
what it looks like if anyone wants to see.

  I've re-run Xconfigurator and I see nothing different. Anyone with
diagnostic suggestions or an instant solution is welcome to share with me.
I'd really like to resolve this problem so I can go on to the other little
things that need fixing or tweaking.

Thanks,

Rich

  To follow up on my own post, it's been suggested to me that the video card
may be failing. I've no reason to dispute this. So, if this really is the
case, I'd like suggestions for a video card that works with XFree86-4.0.2,
has 4-8M vRAM (we don't play games so this is sufficient here) and is
locally available at a very reasonable price.

TIA,

Rich

  That's the 1postfix script in /etc/cron.daily that calls
/usr/bin/pflogsumm.pl, an add-on to postfix. It certainly provides useful
information.

> I haven't been spammed to death, AFAIK.

  Neither have I, thanks to the extensive filters I've been building up in
postfix.

  Persistent SOBs aren't they?

> 
>      http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-23.html
> 
>    While this OpenSSL server vulnerability exists on a wide variety of
>    platforms, the Apache/mod_ssl worm appears to work only on Linux
>    systems running Apache with the OpenSSL module (mod_ssl) on Intel
>    architectures.
> 
>    The  Apache/mod_ssl  worm  scans for potentially vulnerable systems on
>    80/tcp using an invalid HTTP GET request.
> 
>           GET /mod_ssl:error:HTTP-request HTTP/1.0
> 
>    When an Apache system is detected, it attempts to send exploit code to
>    the  SSL  service  via 443/tcp. If successful, a copy of the malicious
>    source  code  is then placed on the victim server, where the attacking
>    system  tries  to compile and run it. Once infected, the victim server
>    begins   scanning   for   additional  hosts  to  continue  the  worm's
>    propagation.
> 
>    Additionally,  the  Apache/mod_ssl  worm can act as an attack platform

Message-ID: <1032114740.14042.8.camel@lana.manymoons.net>

So, I just read that the bugtraq worm has effected 3,500 machines to
far:

http://msn-cnet.com.com/2100-1001-957988.html?type=pt&part=msn&tag=cdf&form=base&subj=cn_fd

I am wondering how I would find out where the worm came from.  I see
that I have an entry for 9/12 in my ssl_request_log file:


[12/Sep/2002:19:48:55 -0700] 213.35.129.34 SSLv2 RC4-MD5 "-" -

Is this revealing or just a conincedence?

  Well, I was looking on the local hard drive. Interestingly, using lynx
takes out the formatting but each doc ends up as one, long paragraph. Just
like some essay answers my students used to write.

While I don't necessarily agree with the diagnosis (doesn't make sense to
me that only the root window is farbed), I can certainly recommend a card.

For the sorts of things I know you do (from your posts here to the list),
I would recommend a Matrox card.  Get either a G200- or G400-based card
and you'll be quite pleased.  The mga driver in XFree4 is quite good.

I don't think it is not the card.

Your root window defaults to this pattern ( well it sound like the pattern, I
could be wrong ) if the window manager is unable to set the rootwindow.

try
#xsetroot -solid blue

if that works then try
#xfbd

if that worksthen try 
#xfbdmgr 
to set the backgound file.

Thank you 
Russell

I think they refer to this as "exponential backoff" on the postfix page.
If you get tired of waiting, "sendmail -q" will attempt to relay/deliver
mail in the queue immediately.

Message-ID: <3D84EF33.5030905@involved.com>

Hi All,

I have a cron job set to run every weekday to turn off the internal 
facing card on my firewall (my wife doesn't want to be distracted by the 
Internet during the day). However, she says that she can still work.

Here's the content of /var/spool/cron/root

# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE - edit the master and reinstall.
# (firewall_time installed on Thu Sep  5 06:37:17 2002)
# (Cron version -- $Id: crontab.c,v 2.13 1994/01/17 03:20:37 vixie Exp $)
0 7 * * 1,2,3,4,5 /sbin/ifconfig eth1 down
0 13 * * 1,2,3,4,5 /sbin/ifconfig eht1 up

If I manually run the ifconfig commands, the interface drops (or comes 
up). I've several crontab tutorials, and as far as I can tell, I'm doing 
everything right. There isn't anything in var/log/messages.* about 
ifconfig or cron.

Can anybody let me know what I'm missing? I'm running RH7.2.

Thanks,
Kyle

Just got back from Seattle and looked at my logs for Friday and Saturday
and see the same.  Lots of attempts to send mail _to_ non-users ie.  
username doesn't exist.  I was getting a few a day on one system for
several months then decided to let them get in (alias to a live account)
and have spamassassin look at them and report the stuff that slipped by 
SA.  Now I'm seeing names of ids that have never been on the system.  
Previous stuff was to old accounts (3-4 years ago).

You're not alone.

You might need to do this with a program like su1 or sudo. I don't use sudo so

Some friends of mine who work for a major ISP were also under a
distributed brute-force spam attack this weekend from at least 20 hosts.

   And, forcing a reinstallation of xfce doesn't fix the problem. This is
quite perplexing and beond my limited ability to comprehend. If this stumps
you folks, too, can you recommend a resource where I can pose this question

The i option ( xfbd -i ) brings up a dialog box that has this as the default in
my install. 
/usr/local/share/xfce/backdrops/Default.xpm

Maybe incorrect permissions or the directory or file that the dialog points to
in your install doesn't exist? Try changing it to another xpm.

2 things I noticed.
1) you have a typo. The device name should be eth1 not eht1
2) I would use /sbin/ifup eth1 and /sbin/ifdown eth1 as my command as it
reruns all of the networking starup and shutdown scripts again.

Also a good test is to make a crontab entry go off in the next five
minutes to make sure it's doing what you want.  Watch your log files.

This should help.

Obviously, a man's judgement cannot be better than the information on 
which he has based it.  Give him the truth and he may still go wrong 
when he has the chance to be right, but give him no news or present 
him only with distorted and incomplete data, with ignorant, sloppy or 
biased reporting, with propaganda and deliberate falsehoods, and you 
destroy his whole reasoning processes, and make him something less 
than a man.

This does not appear to have made it to the list. Let's try again.

In fact, according to the "find" man page:

       -exec command ;
              Execute command; true if 0 status is returned.  All
              following arguments to find are taken to  be  argu?
              ments  to  the command until an argument consisting
              of `;' is encountered.  The string `{}' is replaced
              by the current file name being processed everywhere
              it occurs in the arguments to the command, not just
              in arguments where it is alone, as in some versions
              of find.  Both of these constructions might need to
              be  escaped  (with a `\') or quoted to protect them
              from expansion by the shell.  The command  is  exe?
              cuted in the starting directory.

the salient phrase being "everywhere it occurs" which suggests
that {} can occur more than once.

To disprove your statement simply try:

   find DIR -type f -exec echo {} ... {} \;

(where DIR is your favourite small directory) and you will get what
you expect.

 :: so you have to write a script of sorts:
<script snip>

Yep, I could have written a script. I thought of that.  But being the
tenacious (some would say anal) person that I am, when it comes to
computers, I believed that it should be possible to do what I wanted.
And so finding a solution to the problem became a task unto itself
(I work a lot of overtime to make up the time I waste solving these
idiotic questions I have :-).

 :: I imagine something like this would work also:
 :: 
 :: $ find $DIR -type f -exec FILE={} && $COMMAND $ARGS $FILE > $FILE.foo \;

Nope, it won't, though I'm not completely sure why.  I believe that it
is because `-exec' is expecting a _command_ (which a shell assignment
is not). So it goes ahead and tries to execute the string 'FILE={}'
and, of course, finds "No such file or directory".  Try doing:

   find DIR -type f -exec FILE={} \;

After a further hour of screwing around with every possible permutation
of quoting and escaping I finally discovered how to do what I want.

And in good unix fashion it is in the man page, right in front
of my eyes.  I just had to read it twelve times to "get it".
In Unix, as in Mathematics, _every word_ in a man page is important. 
Ignore a word at your own risk.

Observe that it says:

          The string `{}' is replaced by the current file name
          being processed everywhere it occurs in the arguments
          to the command ...

The salient phrase is "in the arguments to the command".

If the -exec string is:  -exec cat /dev/null > {} \;

then {} is _not_ an argument of the command `cat' since
the arguments stop at `>' which is not passwd to cat but
rather processed by the shell.  This is also why I've never
gotten pipes to work.

The solution is to "fake the systyem out" by writing:


     -exec sh -c "cat /dev/null > {}" \;

Now everything to the right of `sh' and to the left of `\;' is
"an argument" and so it all works.  So do pipes!

Howdy,

I am not happy with the performance of the Fujitsu modem that came with my 
Verizon DSL account. I lose connectivity on a regular basis, 3-4 times per 
week. Unplugging/ plugging in the modem restores it.

This is the second one they sent me, the first one was worse, going down 
several times per day. Is there something good that I can buy to replace it? 
Verizon gives these away for free- I would rather have something that works.

I am certain it is the modem, I've had my ISP and Verizon test the circuits, 
including my house wiring. 

thanks,
Carla

What is the line quality like? What type of DSL circuit is it?
Other than that ....get a cisco 678 and you won't have problems
(assuming that the line quality is OK, and it's a DMT circuit).

The only other think I can think of ...
Are you connected to a Stinger, or a DSLAM (tech support *should* be
able to tell you)?
Actually, if you can't check with that Toshiba thing ... tech support
should be able to tell you what the line quality is (or the
signal-to-noise ratio if it's a DMT circuit)

Welcome to the club.

I've had the same prolems. It's my second modem, too. This one goes down 
irregularly. Sometimes I get a day or so, sometimes a month or so. I'm VERY close 
to the CO. I believe it's line irregularities, since the stupid "modem" doesn't 
realize there is a problem, ever, as indiacted by all three lights staying on.

Please post a different resoltion than this, if you get one.

If you are too close to the CO, sometimes the transmit power has to
be turned down. Other than that... get a better modem. That's pretty
much the only (and better) solution.

Carla,

  I had the first Fujitsu modem fail and Verizon replaced it for me. Once I
had continuing slow transfer rates and a tech came out, tested the lines,
fiddled with the connections at the box on the wall and next to the
sidewalk, then had the C.O. fix things on their end. All's been well ever
since.

  Most of my connection problems have been at the C.O. (e.g., not pushing in
the board far enough for it to seat properly) or the network. But, it's been
quite rare and Verizon's been very good at trouble shooting and fixing the
problems. My location is near the end of the accepted distance from the C.O.
(which in my case is near downtown Gresham, apparently).

  Could it be old or bad wiring between you and the C.O.?

Sorry you're having these troubles,

Rich

This is what I know so far:  I've had this account for two years. The first 
year was lots of outages lasting from a few minutes to a whole day. 
Power-cycling the modem had no effect. I had a Verizon tech spend most of a 
day at my house checking the wiring, he rewired all my phone lines and 
cleaned up a bunch of cruft.  That did not help anything, then last year 
Verizon did a major upgrade at the CO that serves my house, which cured the 
outages. Easystreet, my ISP, had been saying all along that was what needed 
to happen.

Then the modem went flakey and outages happened again, several times a day. 
Power-cycling the modem brought the connection back. Many times I called 
Easystreet, they ran line checks which showed no problems on the circuit 
itself. 

Replacing the modem cut the number of outages significantly. But they still 
happen. I'm running some servers, so it's a big fat pain. I know several 
people with DSL who have never had an outage- it just works. That's what I 
want, dangit!

So yes, it could be a line problem, or a modem problem. I don't know about 
the age of the wiring, none of the neighborhoods around here are more than 16 
years old. I suppose they could be running everything over the original line 
that serviced the original farmhouse! As Mike said, the blinky lights on the 
modem are not helpful, they show all green all the time.

Carla,

  How frustrating! It would be great if someone on the list -- and located
locally, not in Fiji or Belgium <g> -- had a spare Cisco you could try. As
with my X display problem on the other workstation, buying a new piece of
hardware just to see if it's the problem is the more expensive way to go.
Unless, of course, that's the problem.

  There are folks here who know these issues much better than do I. My
reason for suggesting line quality is based on experience in Northeast
Portland where all utility lines were strung on poles and squirrels would
chew through insulation or the phone line would become noisy when it was
very humid or raining; i.e., most of the time. Out here in the eastern edges
of Terra Incognita, all utilities are underground -- except for the power
transformer on a pole at the bottom of 238th that folks hit on a regular
basis during the winter.

  Let us know how to solve the problem.

Rich

out.  Here's my pathetic attempt at ascii art to illustrate the relevant 
machines on the network:

internet------\
                \                                          _______
                 \                            **          |      |
              |--------|     |---------|     /  \         |      |
              |firewall|-----|file serv|-----|AP|     *--/laptop/
              |--------|     |---------|     |--|       /______/
                 1.251          1.252         2.x         2.3


There's a switch between the firewall and the fileserver where most of 
the other machines connect.  The fileserver also acts as a dhcp server, 
and ssh connections from the outside are forwarded there as well.

Since the wireless AP is on eth1 on the fileserver, I put the wireless 
network on the 192.168.2.0 network, whereas the wired network is 
192.168.1.0.  The default route is pointed at the firewall.  The laptop 
can login to the fileserver, and ping the 1.252 interface from itself 
(not only while logged in remotely).  It cannot, however, ping any other 
host on the 1.x network.

Here's the output of 'route -n' on the fileserver:


Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use 
Iface
127.0.0.0       0.0.0.0         255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 lo
192.168.2.0     192.168.2.252   255.255.255.0   UG    0      0        0 eth1
192.168.2.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth1
192.168.1.0     192.168.1.252   255.255.255.0   UG    0      0        0 eth0
192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
0.0.0.0         192.168.1.251   0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0

I *think* it looks okay, but I could be totally wrong.  Everything I've 
googled for doesn't really apply to my situation - most hits I've gotten 
are people setting up ONE dual-homed machine (ie a firewall), not TWO on 
the same network.

Anyone want to take a swing with the cluestick?

I had that modem for a long time, My service was up
and running like clockwork, running a server, that had
excellent up time.  

I was quite pleased with the performance of the
fujitsu even tho it is a very basic dsl modem.  it is
not a dsl router, but only a dsl bridge, for those
that are interested.  

anyway, thats my 2 cents.  I will let you know my
experience of the cisco 678 in 2 weeks, as that is
what I am moving to with my new qwest line.(I was
previously verizon).

Hmm. I've not seen the local gateway stuff before. I've always seen it 
be something like

Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
127.0.0.0       0.0.0.0         255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 lo
192.168.2.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth1
192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
0.0.0.0         192.168.1.251   0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0

I don't know if that's the problem, though...

A couple other odd jabs:

* I take it that a traceroute from your laptop to 192.168.1.x will 
  stop at 1.251, right?

* I take it you've done all the right /proc twiddling to allow your 
  fileserver to forward IP packets, i.e.,

  sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1

Carla,

If you need to test out a different modem, I still have one of the old 
Orkit modems, as well as a couple of the Fujitsu's from my past DSL 
forays.  Let me know and I'll send them along with the wife to drop them 
off to you. :)

Hello Linux folkz,
In our eng.dept. we're looking to standardize on a single
uniform Linux graphical environment.
Could somebody please give me an advise what is more 
convenient to use with less system resources consumption?

KDE is a very good environment but it uses a lot of memory
and processor power.
Windowmaker less resource consuming, has a nice interface, but
we couldn't make its sound server working.
CDE is severely outdated.

What else we can take into consideration?

Thanks in advance.

Alex

I'm having some serious problems with the administration of a domainbank account.

Over a month ago I submitted their form to get my DNS updated for an upcoming IP 
address change, not only did they not update the DNS, they didn't notify anyone. 
We've spent a week sorting out whether they would even change the DNS without e-
mail from the administrator. My customer changed e-mail addresses (Teleport) and 
cannot send mail from it. Then, they called, and got verbal instructions from the 
customer followed up by e-mail from him. (As a note, I'm listed as two of the 
three contacts in the DNS and that's not good enough to change it for them)

Has anyone else had trhis kind of trouble with domainbank? I'm of a mind to 
change all of the adresses I have with them.

Is cross-platform standartization a concern to you? For example, one of
the reasons I chose FVWM2 was that I can build it easilly on Linux, HPUX,
and Solaris, and all my desktops look the same.

> Could somebody please give me an advise what is more

Both KDE and GNOME are resource hogs, and I personally don't find them all
that convenient, I think configuration options are very limited. You can
run any number of lightweight window managers (Afterstep, FVWM2, even
sawfish by itself is not that bad with resources, depends on what you
like).

Do you actually need your window manager make sounds, or you want to make
it work just because it's there?

> CDE is severely outdated.
And severely insecure.

If folks are used to CSE, you could do far worse than Xfce,
http://www.xfce.org/. It is lightweight and fairly customizable. It 
comes with just a couple built-in apps: a file manager that's nothing 
special (but does allow drag and drop), a nifty clock/calendar applet, 
an SMB file viewer, and the usual configuration utilities.

You'll need to have gtk+ 1.2.6 or higher installed, but otherwise it's 
free from hairy library dependencies.

The current version, 3.8.16, is a few months old now, but that's 
because the developers have been pressing toward the 4.0 release 
(RSN! :-).

Have you looked at IceWM?  It's easy on resources and fairly easy to
configure with text files.  http://icewm.org

Hi Mike, 

Yea, that can be frustrating.
Let me suggest: http://mydomain.com/
IT'S FREE!
Free as in beer.
They will host your DNS for FREE. Can't beat that. 
In order to use them, you will have to contact your registrar and
have them move your domain to mydomain.com's DNS servers (heh - if
they will).
It's free, and they have a support forum that is very good.
I don't know how they do it, but it really is free, and reliable.
As you can tell, I'm very happy with them :)
- -Charlie

  3.8.18 is available. It adds a taskbar (whoopie-do; some like it, some of
us don't). I've the src.rpm and rebuilt rpms for 586 and 686 processors, if
anyone wants a copy.

I'd do that, but the firewall has a limited number of ports, and I'm 
full up as it is.

Sounds like a hub is in order, I won't try the ascii method. 
Hook the firewall's one port to the hub, then plug as many 
devices into the hub as you like. I think that will make 
things simpler.

Yes,we need sound in Windowmaker in order to use our custom

If you know how to configure and start this damned sound server in
Windowmaker I would be very thankful for your help.

I find the combo of IceWM and Rox Filer (http://rox.sourceforge.net/) To be very functional, configurable and speedy.

Is the latest KDE really that slow on your hardware?

We've tried to run KDE 3.0.1 on our PIII class systems 
and it was unbearably slow even with 256MB RAM.
Our systems are loaded with tons of running software 
and MySQl databases. 
KDE just adds an unnecessary load to it. 

We've found Windowmaker is much faster and less resource 
consuming but we couldn't cope with the broken sound server
in it. 
Any help to make it working is greatly appreciated.

Subject: [PLUG] Spam reduced.
Message-ID: <3D862837.9010601@dimstar.net>

OK, I've hit on another winner of a configuration, at least for me, in 
my battle against spam.

First, as many others here are, I'm running spamassassin.

Second, I found a site in the Netherlands called wirehub.nl that 
maintains several spam fighting lists.

If you go to http://basic.wirehub.nl/spamstats.html, there are stats 
and, low down on the page, instructions for using all of the pieces they 
maintain. I'm using their extended public spamlist, their dynablocker 
and they DNS blacklist. My spam has been reduced, and I've been watching 
my bounce rate and deferred messages (due to unreachable spam sources) 
drop since implimenting this.

Hope this helps someone else too.

I know it is kind of silly for one liners, but when I set up cron jobs,
I write a script that gets called by cron with no arguments, the script
itself contains all of the commands and arguments.  This is easier to
test, because you can run the script from command line, and be pretty
sure that cron will run it the same way.

I'm not sure this will help, but it may be worth $0.02.

Does your laptop, when connected via wireless, have a default route
pointing at 192.168.2.1 (or whatever the fileserver's eth1 address is)?

Does your fileserver have ip routing turned on?
(cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward should equal 1 if the fileserver is
running linux)

What happens when you make the laptop's default gateway be:

  192.168.2.252 (or whatever the "fileserver" interface to the AP is).

For what it is worth, I could not get a Cisco 678 to work on the Verizon
network, no way, no how.  Had to replace the faulty Fujitsu with another
Fujitsu (which is still up and running, with no complaints).

The following assumes you are using Linux 2.4 kernel.

I don't think one installs "gateway" routes for directly attached
networks.  The following should suffice.

127.0.0.0       0.0.0.0         255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 lo
192.168.2.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth1
192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
0.0.0.0         192.168.1.251   0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0

ifconfig should automatically set up the routes for the directly
attached networks. The only route you should set manually is the
default gateway. If you are using Debian, then set all of these
parameters in /etc/networking/interfaces (man interfaces).

Also, ensure that you are turning on routing in your kernel:

echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

Of course, run /sbin/ifonfig to ensure that both interfaces are
configured properly.

HTH,

Aj

That's how it is currently setup, in fact - and it doesn't work, 
unfortunately.

I'd plug it into the hub/switch, but I was looking to make this AP 
ptp-able (www.personaltelco.net) which means some kind of firewalling at 
the interface level.

Routing is on (this box *used* to pull double-duty as firewall/server). 
  The dhcpd.conf declarations for the two subnets are identical except 
for the bits that call out the network itself, and the gateway.  The 
gateway for the wireless net is the interface address for the AP, and 
the gateway for the wired net is the network side of the firewall.

I have a suspicion that there's a small routing thing at the fileserver 
going on...but I'm not sure what.

No, that just upgrades the already installed packages with the
following wrinkle (from the apt-get man page):
  
   dist-upgrade, in addition to performing the function of upgrade,
   also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new ver-
   sions of packages; apt-get has a "smart" conflict resolution
   system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most important pack-
   ages at the expense of less important ones if necessary.  The
   /etc/apt/sources.list file contains a list of locations from which
   to retrieve desired package files.

Dirk> If not, can I do it with apt-get?  

I don't know.  I've never wanted to do that.  I doubt you can install
*all* packages anyway, as some of them conflict.

                         Beaverton, OR 97008

      The way to get there is to take Denny Rd exit from 217
      (whichever way you're coming on 217), go West (assuming 217
      runs North-South, which it sort of does, or look for railroad
      under the overpass, you should go over it, if you don't see
      it you're going the wrong way, toward Portland).
      Go on Denny rd to the end of the road (T-intersection with
      Hall blvd), go left on Hall and then immediately right on
      Hart, then left on the first stop sign on Sorrento, and go
      about 3/4 of the way to the end of Sorrento.
      The house is on the right.

I thought that ap-get install ".*" would install all of them, but it had
package conflicts and died on me.  There must be a way to fine tune this.

Programs you might want to look at are tasksel or aptitude.  Tasksel lets
you pick packages in a highlevel way.  Aptitude allows you finer control.

References: <mailman.1032081074.23220.plug@lists.pdxlinux.org>
Message-ID: <3D863ECD.32D41BC@computer-arts.net>

I'm just in the process of learning how to burn CDs myself (I've
been using the "cdrecord" command.)

Anyway, it appears to me that the following things are true:

(1) Most CD players (both in computers and regular audio CD players)
    can not read CD-RW CDs (the kind you can erase and re-record on.)
    The only device I can find at my house that can read CD-RWs
    is the device that I burn them on. When I want to burn a CD for
    playing anywhere else, I have to burn a CD-R (the kind you can't
    erase)  My understanding is that some of the newer CD players
    CAN play CD-RWs.

(2) Similarly most CD players can not read a CD until it has been
    "fixated" (but perhaps some can)

So, if my understanding is correct, you *might* not be able to play a
CD (other than perhaps on the burner device) until you have recorded
everything and then fixated it. Using a CD-RW throws in an additional
variable.

I'd love to hear an explanation from somebody who knows more about
this.

That appeared to be the problem, doing a gpm -k before starting X worked.
Although, I wasn't able to read from /dev/gpmdata even when gpm was running.  I
switched back to /dev/psaux and just kill gpm before starting X.

This is correct. CD-RW have significantly lower reflectivity than CD-Rs
(which in turn aren't quite as reflective as CDs). Many DVD players
designed to play also MP3s and VCDs will handle CDRWs, but most CD players
won't.

> (2) Similarly most CD players can not read a CD until it has been

They aren's supposed to. Furthemore, most CD players won't play a
multisession CD even after it's fixated, they'll only play the first
session.

Hey,

How do .deb packages work?  Are they static binaries or are they compiled at install time?  I was wondering about this because I currently use Debian 3.0r0 and was considering using Gentoo (www.gentoo.org) as everything is compiled at install time.  Although, I am fairly taken with the apt-get and apt-cache commands :).

Thanks

This is probably due to the repeat protocol that you chose for the gpm
configuration.  Try setting it to "raw", that usually works with well
behaved mice.  BTW, the "proper" (debian) way to stop the gpm server is
to do a "/etc/init.d/gpm stop", and a "/etc/init.d/gpm start" to get it
going again (in case something else needs to be done as well).

Yes, for the most part, the debian packages are pre-compiled (unless you
get the source code, but then you have to compile it yourself).

I installed Gentoo on a P233 over the weekend, it took all night to
compile the base system, and all the next day to progress to the end of
stage 3 (where you can finally boot to your newly compiled system). 
Then all day Sunday to compile a basic X-server, Blackbox and Mozilla. 
At the same time, I was able to install a complete debian system on a
laptop with a bunch of applications all ready to go.

So, the concept of Gentoo is really good (every application you run has
been optimized for your system), and emerge does a good job (takes care
of dependencies, ect.), but the time it takes to install the system is a
huge investment, especially on older equipment.

BTW, it is a _very_ good learning experience, almost nothing works right
after the install, and you get very intimate with the system, which is
the whole point of the distribution.  I guess the main point is: don't
expect to have a fully functional linux install on the same day you
start.

Just thought I'd share.

It's the configuration engine for managing the configuration of groups

...especially true if you still have a dial-up connection as I have.  It
took a few days.  You're right, with Gentoo you do get a very good idea
about how everything works because to a large degree you're setting
everything up yourself.  But that does give you a lot of power over how
things are set up.

You _can_ get Gentoo install CDs which have much of the base system
pre-compiled.  Also in news about the upcoming version 1.4 from the
Gentoo.org website today:

"a new "live" bootable CD that boots directly into a runtime version of
Gentoo Linux 1.4_rc1. Includes KDE 3.0.3, KDE 3.1-beta1, KOffice 1.2,
OpenOffice 1.0.1, GNOME 2.0.1 (2.0.2 on the way) and Mozilla 1.0 (1.1
available for testing.) And yes, we now have "vi" on our install CD :) The
"rc1" release includes bootable CD ISOs for x86, stage tarballs for PPC
and Sparc64 (ISOs on their way) and new Alpha Processor stage1 support"

Howdy,

I am not happy with the performance of the Fujitsu modem that came with
my 
Verizon DSL account. I lose connectivity on a regular basis, 3-4 times
per 
week. Unplugging/ plugging in the modem restores it.

This is the second one they sent me, the first one was worse, going down

several times per day. Is there something good that I can buy to replace
it? 
Verizon gives these away for free- I would rather have something that
works.

I am certain it is the modem, I've had my ISP and Verizon test the
circuits, 
including my house wiring. 

thanks,
Carla

Yeah, I'd be interested in hearing an overview of cfengine and how it
is used in real world situations. I'd also appreciate some discussion
as to how cfengine differs from isconf
<http://www.infrastructures.org/bootstrap/isconf.shtml> and maelstrom
<http://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~couch/maelstrom/>, if possible.

In its barest form, it's a very high-level language for maintaining
files and running external processes. It allows you to

* check for, create, and set the permissions on directories or files;

* delete files (e.g., in /tmp) based on their age, ownership, etc.

* compare installed files with a master copy (which may or may not be
  available in the local filesystem), to install the master copy if it
  differs from the local copy, and to run a local process after the 
  master copy is installed

* edit files in place based on a series of text-matching rules

* perform certain actions at specific times (ala cron) or at random 
  times

on machines of a certain class. Some classes are "hard" (OS, 
architecture, date, time), some soft (e.g., mail server, X client, or 
whatever you want).

I can certainly provide a real-world overview of cfengine. As to 
isconf and maelstrom, I just don't have the time to learn them well 
enough to provide a public analysis. Sorry.

I carried a test burning multisessions on CDRW.  After burning of 1st 
session I left it unfixated.  I continued to burn 2nd session also 
unfixated and then fixated the whole CDRW afterwards.  When I played the 
CDRW on CD player I only found the first session.  I am uncertain 
whether I did something wrong because I am a beginner using CD burner in 
Linux environment.  The software used was Xcdroast.

I am going to get a DVD player if it can play CDRW unfixated.

Could you shed me some light.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0209161724520.24561-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  Now that I've upgraded my linux system and vmware (3.2.0 was released
today), I need to get the virtual machine (IP address 192.168.55.6) talking
to the rest of the network.

  /etc/smb.conf is fine, but the vwin98 doesn't see the network. I've gone
through the network settings, but I don't see where to tell it to look for
other hosts on the network.

  Can someone please pass me a pointer to this?

Thanks,

Rich

Sure, I just thought it might give you an excuse to look at them a little
bit :-), or at least talk with someone who has (I know Marion at OGI
is on the infrastructures/isconf list). But I'd appreciate any sort of
"how to use cfengine in the real world" talk, as figuring out how to
apply cfengine to even something as simple as my home network has been
perennially on my todo list.  

I'd also be interested in hearing how well cfengine plays with package
management tools like rpm and dpackage and where you break down the
control between the two tools.

  I rummaged around the menus in the virtual-win98's file manager and
discovered Tools | Map network drives. That's what I was looking for. But,
(there's always one of these, isn't there?) when I define the e:\ drive as
mapped to /mnt/usr2/winstuff/, I'm asked for a password to make the
connection. And this is where I'm stuck.

  I've tried the password I use to log in on vwin98, my linux user password
and my linux root password. All are rejected. The software must have some
prior user password stuck in its craw and I don't know how to remove that
one and give it a password it will accept.

  Has anyone here any ideas on how to do this? The dialog box gives no
hints. There is only the checkbox to make the connection when the virtual
machine boots.

Thanks,

Most would not. There are two separate problems here: low reflectivity of
CDRW and multisession format. DVD players designed to cope with CDRW
will play them, but unless the software is designed to handle multisession
CDs it won't, even if you master that CDRW onto a regular shiny CD.

This is exactly what is supposed to happen, only the first session should
be visible. Even some computer CD drivers won't see the other sessions.
Since many DVD players use DVD-ROM drive inside, they could read multisession
CDs in theory, if they have the right software.

> I am going to get a DVD player if it can play CDRW unfixated.
Nope, it can play CDRW, but it can't play anything unfixated. If you manage
to press a real CD unfixated, it won't play either.

this to be case when attempting to setup a drive mapping. 

I've only had problems when I've upgraded and my smbpasswd and/or 
smb.conf file get saved off and some non-functional replacements from 
the install media are installed in their place.

  OK. I've fixed problems with smbpasswd. Now, I need to find where the e:\
drive is mapped to \\salmo\\winstuff. Winderz is not finding that
definition.

Step by tiny step,

Tony,

  BINGO! That's what happened. What used to be in /etc/smbpasswd and
/etc/smbusers are now in /etc/samba/smb*.

  It must be in one of the share statements that the virtual win98 is
picking up the network drive called "\\salmo\\winstuff" to try to map to
it's e:\ drive. But, it cannot find the former. _I_ know it as
/mnt/usr2/winstuff and I haven't yet found the mapping to \\salmo\\winstuff.

  Any ideas?

Thanks,

Rich

I guess I'm fuzzy on this...Are you talking VMWare or Samba? For a Samba 
share you would have a section labeled [winstuff] in your smb.conf file 
that would indicate the path on the server where the share resides. 

Since it sounds like you have a newer version of Samba installed, have 
you move your existing /etc/smb.conf into the /etc/samba directory?
You would also need to either shutdown and restart your Samba service or 
send the "smbd" process a SIGHUP signal to get it to reread your 
smb.conf file once you have moved your existig file into the proper 
location.

Tony

Because of the problems with Junkbuster and not wanting to update the
config files continually, I've been using "privoxy".  It's based on
junkbuster but is updated often.  http://www.privoxy.org or "apt-get 
install privoxy" for Debian types.  I use it with both Konqueror and
Galeon.

Highly recommended.

Cool, changing the repeat to raw fixed it.  Hehe, I wondered about the

This appears to only be a problem with Evolution bec (as you can tell) 
pine works fine.

When I try to send a message to an address other than my own I get the 
following error:

"RCPT TO: requested action not take: mailbox unavailable: mail not sent"

This started happened after an upgrade to RH7.3.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

  Of course you're confused, Tony. So am I. The vmware guest OS (win98)
cannot see the network and I'm trying to determine if the problem is within
the virtual win98 or with samba on the linux host.

  Testing now ... and sure enough, it was the moved samba files as a result
of the linux upgrade. I made the changes last night, and restarted smb, but
waited until this morning to test the setup.

  Well, only a few more pieces to get working again and I'll be answering
more questions here than posting my own.

UIDs but I don't know if/when they changed.  Perhaps GIDs (group) also
since Redhat, at least, uses user-private groups so would need as many
GIDs as UIDs for a real multiuser system.

There's a few of them there (all non-official), but I've grabbed one before
that I didn't care for too much. If I could only remember which one it was.
:)

I've seen someone point to one here before (was it Karl?) that I grabbed,
and I liked it.  Now if I could only remember where it was. :)

I'm almost finished builing a full (8!) CD set using jigdo, but it is for
someone else.  And I definitely prefer the netinstall myself... time to get
an up-to-date one.

Karl has an older one at:

Note that Karl's image uses the 2.4 kernel series and the one at hogwarts.orbital.us is the standard woody netinst which still uses a 2.2 kernel.  I prefer Karl's netinst image myself since it uses the newer kernel.  There will also be a copy of that one on hogwarts.orbital.us soon and there are a bunch of other Linux iso's on there as well.

Nevermind.

It's weird but we have an electrician here today and he turned off the
power without telling me.  The machine rebooted, and lo and behold my
email works.

I did do an upgrade to 1.08 but I don't think that is what fixed it bec
it didn't work right after that.

Go figure.

I've been using godaddy and I have been happy with their service.  They
register .us and are currently charging 9.95 for new .us domains for two years 
and 7.75 for domain transfers through Oct 15.  8.95/year for
.com/.org/.net domains for one year.

Check with easydns.com.  That's where our domain is.  Also, you
might check out domainmonger.com.  Both use linux, according to netcraft.

Yes, usually it can be broken into two categories, one is the original
cd is copy-protected, the other is the rate at which your machine can
pull data off the cd-reader and feed it to the cd-burner.  In either
case, the recommended fix is to create an image of the cd on your
harddrive, then use gcombust to burn the image.  In the first case you
will need to try different tools, some work better with different
copy-protection schemes.  The last option, which can be a lot more work,
is to mount the original cd, copy the files and directories to your
harddrive, then use mkisofs to create an image to burn (which gcombust
can help with).

Darn, I thought this would work for me.  When my Toshiba laptop with 
external ps/2 mouse attached first comes up in X, the mouse moves erractly. 
  Replugging the mouse fixes it.

I edited /etc/sysconfig/gpm and added OPTIONS="-R raw"
is that the right place?  Actually, now that I look at it, I must have 
disabled gpm from starting up during previous troubleshooting.

While I wrote this, the mouse started working all by itself, but the 
"eraser" mouse is ignored...oh well, looks like a Toshiba thing.

I just run the gmpconfig utility, it allows for immediate testing (run
it from a console, check the mouse behavior in the console, then switch
to the x-server and test mouse behavior there), and restarts the gpm
server when it is done.

Doing a "/etc/init.d/gpm restart" might be enough to get the mouse
change to take.

It almost doesn't matter what version you get, as long as it works.
Install, apt-get dist-upgrade and you are pretty much the same.

That must be a Debianism, no such thing here.  Even more interesting is that 
when I switched to vc1, logged in then moved the mouse, the keyboard stopped 
responding and the laptop dropped off the net.  ctrl-alt-del has no effect, 
looks like ext3 to the rescue again...

I think he meant 'gpmconfig', rather than gmp.  ;)

I'd just do a 'locate gpm | grep bin' and see what turns up.

Not entirely true, I had major problems trying to get the laptop to boot
to a 2.4.19 kernel after being installed with a 2.2.20 kernel.  The root
partition couldn't be mounted, even though the boot partition could be
read (the kernel booted).  At first I thought it was because I had
compiled with ext3 support, but recompiling without the ext3 support
lead to the same error, so now I'm back to the 2.2.20 kernel and out of
ideas (short of re-installing with a 2.4.18 kernel).

I installed a laptop a couple of weeks ago, with the 2.4.18 kernel, and
it ran great, when I compiled my own 2.4.19 kernel, it booted with no
problems, and is still running.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.44.0209171024400.20693-100000@eel.ENGR.ORST.EDU>

My computer is a 1Ghz with the dvd drive (the source) and the cdrw drive
(with scsi-ide) are on the same controller.  The disks have no copy
protection.  The dvd reads at 32x for cd I believe and I write at 8x. I
can't remember if I tried it in windows, the windows burning software I
have is incredibly retarded.  Who designs these gui?  Not to start a rant,
but the new management tools in win2k for Active directory are a the worst
I've seen in years...

It transfers the file names but not the contents.  I can't remember the
exact message I get.  It is very cryptic and gives a lot of numbers.

The work around I use that always works is to mount the disk, copy to
local filesystem, them tell gcombust to make a cd from data directories.
It works, but I would like to learn to duplicate the cd since I have two
drives.

Thanks,
Jason

  Thanks, Sean. I registered a personal domain with them and have it parked

a second domain here.

Other than the warning message produced by using "shutdown -h", is there
any advantage to using it over "init 0" on Linux?  I know on other *nix
systems, the shutdown command also calls sync and gracefully shutdowns
processes, but I thought I read somewhere that Linux does this
automatically when changing to runlevel 0.

I assumed that was a typo, no such thing in redhat land.  But now I'm 
experiencing mouse weirdness I've never noticed before.  I did revert 
/etc/sysconfig/gpm back to its original state.  Oh boy, something to do today.

When both drives are on the same controller, they both cannot be
accessed simultaneously.  This can cause big problems.  The main thing
to keep in mind:  once the burner ignites, it must have a continuous
stream of data, any interruption will cause the burn to fail.  This is
the main reason for having the data to be burned on the harddrive (on a
separate controller from the burner).  It is also why you don't want to
burn data from a mounted network file system either.

Of course, some of us burn CDs across the network all the time, 
figuring that an occasional toasted burn[1] is a small price to pay 
for the convenience of storing ISOs on the network. :-)

    burn.

Jason,

  My setup is different from yours, with an ATAPI cdrom and a fast-wide SCSI
cd-rw. I've used xcdroast in the past (it's a GUI front-end to mkisofs and
cdrecord), but now I'm just working off the command line.

  Anyway, my point is that I learned to make a disk copy (with mkisofs) from
the cdrom, then burn that on the cd-r with cdrecord. I wasn't even aware
that one could do it in one step. If nothing else, the reads might not keep
the write buffers full (despite the relative speeds of the two).

  Is there a problem with disk space? Seems to me that mkisofs needs to be
run to read the contents off the source disk and prepare them for writing as
an ISO formatted file.

Just curious,

Rich

That has been my experience also Paul.  That is just another reason why I
think my computer should be fine for doing the burn.  I think the problem
exists between the keyboard and chair.  I'll have to rtfm before I do it
next time.  There might be a section on duplicating cd's.

I don't remember where, but I thought I read something about a Linux
distro that was based on Debian, including the wonderful apt-get system,
the major difference being that it would automatically detect all of
your hardware accurately. I have enjoyed Debian on my laptop, which
works just fine, but when I tried it on my main box, either:
a) sound card won't work
b) network card won't work
c) can't use plain CD-ROM drive
d) CD-RW drive treated as plain CD-ROM - no burning cd's on this box!
e) all of the above
If you chose e, you are correct! After spending a week or so trying to
solve the hardware issues on Debian's terms, including discover, which
made 3 mount points for 2 cd-rom drives and did nothing to /etc/fstab,
and etherconf, which deleted my eth0 /etc/network/interfaces at each
bootup (after I had to manually edit the file with my eth0 info,
etherconf would delete it. Doesn't matter, the damn thing never worked
either way), I fixed the machine with my trusty Red Hat disc that
figured out all of my hardware without a hitch.
	Anyway, what I'm getting at is that I love Debian and I love its
apt-get system. I abhor the way Debian deals with hardware. I love Red
Hat's hardware detection and tools like sndconfig, but I really don't
care for rpm. I want something with the good parts from both camps.
Hardware detection + apt-get. 
	Any suggestions?

I tried xcdroast a couple times (about 1 year ago) but it segfaulted on
startup.  Which led me to using gcombust.

There is a problem with disk space right now.  I have pruned my partions
and data files back to "really small" because I am waiting for my new
computer to arrive and I want to reduce the amount of data that must be
moved.  Normally it isn't an issue.  I usually have several more gigs that
I need.  It is more of an efficiency issue really.  There are many
times when I borrow a CD from a friend and want to make a copy so I can
give their copy back.

I'll try xcdroast the next time I try this.

Thanks,
Jason

I think you might be thing about Progeny.  It did all that nice stuff :)  However, it is no longer being developed.  Here is a link to a beta version of the progeny install for use with debian woody.  I haven't tried it out myself, so I can't tell you how well it works, but it might be worth a try.

You need scsi-ide enabled or as a module.  It's a pain to setup the first

For a lot of the tools you can use apt.  It is untested for me, but
sndconfig shows up when I type apt-cache search sndconfig.  So, if you
know the names of the tools you can probably apt them.  Karl or others
could probably even suggest a way that you can gaurantee they are
installed during the initial istallation of debian.

Go search some of the archives in the last month or two for apt-rpm,
which allows use of the apt tools on Red Hat.

I think the Debian distro you're thinking of is called Progeny.

Others have mentioned Progeny and noted that it is no longer developed
which is true.  There is another Debian-based distro called LibraNet that
is supposed to have a pretty nice install with hardware detection (I have
not tried it, so I can't comment).

 From what I've heard, the latest and greatest version of Libranet is 
NOT free, however.  You might be able to find a 'free' copy somewhere 
out on the 'net, but to get it from Libranet - you have to pay a fee of 
some kind.

You heard about Progeny (Built on Strength).  All of the stuff they
developed is now part of the main Debian distribution.  For hardware
detection, they snagged "detect" (GPL) from Mandrakesoft.  There must
have been some problems with working together with them on it, or
perhaps Mandrake had dropped development -- iirc, Mandrake has switched
to "kudzu" -- at any rate, Progeny renamed "detect" to "discover" and
has done some further development of it.

"discover"'s advantage over kudzu is that it's designed as a command to
be used inside a script, so you have more control over the module
loading, etc.  In the unix tradition, it's a modular peice of the
overall solution, rather than a monolithic hard coded one program does
it all.  The disadvantage, vs kudzu, is that it no longer has any
support for legacy ISA PNP detection.  That support was dropped at one
point a few versions back.

# apt-get install discover

... and see if that does what you want.  It supports only PCI, not
isa-pnp.  If you need hardware detection for isa-pnp, you can:

# apt-get install kudzu

... and for sound cards:

# apt-get install sndconfig

... but be aware that those are not fully integrated with Debian at this
point, so you may need to add the things it detects to "/etc/modules" by
hand.

# apt-get install hotplug

... for hotplug support.  It works very well with my USB devices, and
also knows how to bring up a "tuntap" interface (for user mode linux)
when "tunctl -u karlheg" is run.  AFAIK, it also supports the PCI
hotplug too.

The now obsolete isa-pnp is not perfect.  I've found, for instance, that
sometimes the 3c509 NIC driver will think that a Soundblaster card is a
network card.  The solution was to put "sb" and "opl3" first in
"/etc/modules", so that they get loaded BEFORE the 3c509.  There may be
similar issues with other sets of ISA PNP hardware + drivers.

The thing is that ISA was not designed with automated hardware detection
in mind.  They didn't need that, since when you bought an add-in card,
it came with a driver diskette.  You always had the driver for the card
when you bought the card.  Now though, with Linux, the drivers are all
in the kernel source, to support these old cards and to support them
with Linux, not Windows or DOS.  The similar thing happened with
Windows, where there are drivers included with the OS.

So, at some point, they began trying to make it possible for software to
automaticly detect the hardware so it can select a driver module. 
ISA-PNP (plug and play) arose out of that need.  It does not work very
well, and when they created PCI, they improved on the design, and now
with PCI, device detection is much simpler and more fool proof.

Now it can look up, in a ROM on the card itself, the card's ID, and use
that as a key into a table that maps cards to driver modules.  The
modules themselves can get parameter information right from the card in
a specified way.  "specified", as opposed to "ad hoc", where each
manufacturer may have a different scheme for storing that information,
if it's even available on the card at all.

Plug and play monitors can tell software their scan frequency's and
video mode capability information, so that the X Window System (or
Windows 95) can gather that data directly from the monitor.  This is a
lot better than requiring a database of monitor types, which must be
maintained.  The situation is analogous to the hosts.txt vs DNS problem,
where decentralizing the maintenance of the domain name to IP mapping
solves the scalability problem.  Now when a new model of monitor comes
out, no centrally maintained database need be updated.

"telinit 0" will run the K and S scripts in /etc/rc0.d.  That's about
ALL it really does...

Actually, what it really does is look in the /etc/inittab for a line
like this:

  l0:0:wait:/etc/init.d/rc 0

... which says that when it is asked to enter runlevel 0, it should
execute "/etc/init.d/rc" with the argument "0".  That script could do
just about anything at all, so you'll have to RTFS to see what it in
fact does.  Perhaps the man page actually does accurately document it's
actions.  (That would be most awesome, wouldn't it?)

use "bf24" at the boot prompt to get the 2.4 kernel.  I don't know if
that netinst CD at hogwart has that feature or not.  The one that's on
my people.pdxlinux.org web site was modified to make the 2.4 kernel be
the first choice kernel...

It was set up to boot using isolinux, rather than an el-torito (floppy
image) with syslinux.  isolinux can offer several boot kernels, but this
works only on newer BIOS.  Some older BIOS can not even boot an isolinux
CD at all, and that is why the el-torito method is used for the official
Debian CD's.

That netinst image on my site is one that once had a 2.2 kernel as the
default kernel... older BIOS would not offer the multiple kernel menu,
and would boot, if they boot it at all, the first image.  So I mounted
the ISO on a loopback, tar cf - | tar xf - it to a subdirectory, then
ran a mkisofs that made the 2.4 kernel the first image.  That's why I
put that up for download rather than just post a link to the original
one.

Anyway, with the official Debian CD's, you can perform a net install if
you like.  The ISO is larger though... so it takes a LOT longer to
download.  Also with the official CD, you can, as I said, choose to boot
it with a 2.4 kernel by using "bf24" at the boot prompt.  This is
documented in the screens you get when you push function keys after
booting the CD.

I can burn a CD for anyone who wants one.

Out here it is underground, new, and stable. In five years I've had one short 
power outage.

Several people have kindly offered the use of modems to test. I'm going to 
give it a whirl, why the heck not. After reading all the responses, I'm 
inclined to think it's an upstream problem, especially because I did have a 
tech come out here and overhaul my phone wiring clear out to the ugly green 
box. (haha they couldn't charge me because it did not fix the problem- 
upgrading their CO fixed it. It was quite severe then, outages lasting hours 
and days)

If a different modem makes no difference, I'm going to put it on a timer to 
power-cycle in the middle of the night, every night. A three-minute nightly 
outage won't matter. If I were running mission-critical services, I would not 
do it on a home DSL account! I would use a proper regulated service with 
contractual uptime and service requirements. For my little 768k home DSL, I'm 
not going to get all excited.

It may be that spending hours on the phone with Verizon would make a 
difference, their service is good, but I don't want to! Not for occasional 
blips like I've been experiencing. I'll see how the low-budget fixes work out.

Thanks for help and modem loans, everyone!

When faced with a problem like this; where the links are tested to be know
goods, the equipment is tested to be a know good, or swapped out to a known
good, that the only thing left to try is environmentals. 

Power, cooling, E&M, ... can all effect things. Way back in the day, ELI in
Seattle had an issue with a OC-12 going down at 3:00 in the afternoon. It
wasn't all the days, but always around three. It took a while for the techs to
notice that the vertical blinds didn't quite meet and the sun came around the
Westin at three ( A sunny day in Seattle, yeah right ). On a sunny day, a beam
of sunshine would poke through the blinds and hit the gap in the door of the
cover of the OC-12 and bounce off of some E&M plating onto the optical
receiver. There was enough light leakage on the receiver that the beam would
over-drive the sensor. 

Thank you
Russell

  What? That it all worked?

  What tripped me up for a bit last evening was the change in location of
smb* from /etc to /etc/samba. No wonder the virtual machine couldn't find
its way to the share.

  I have a few more things to do on one project before I start re-doing maps
on another project. I'm also working on getting the mapping software to run
over wine. _That_ would be a Very Good Thing, indeed.

Ciao,

I'm trying to host e-mail for domains I host. 

I have a separate mail server set up to handle the (duh) mail.

I want to have mail sent to user at fqdn1.com to go through the system and have replies 
sent from user at fqdn1.com. I ALSO want to get mail at user1 at fqdn2.com be from 
fqdn2.com, etc. 

I'm stumped by my research. Do I want virtual mail hosting? Isn't that 
foo at foo.bar.com? I do not want mail sent to one address to be sent or translated to 
a different address. What I'm wanting would look like a separate mail server for 
each domain I host. I know it's possible, I just don't know what it's called.

I'm running RH 7.3 on Intel hardware with (currently) sendmail. If I need to change 
from sendmail, that's okay.

I usually use gramofile.  (Used to use Sound Studio.)  It's even simpler,
and has some nice built-in filters.  (Hum, tape hiss, record popping, etc.)

Command line program, but the ncurses (I think) is really nice and easy to
use.  I've done exactly what you describe, and it works fine.  (Without the
long "hang" I always got with SS when it was doing disk I/O.)

Without knowing which services they are, te answer is prob. yes. 

You're doing a lot with a "workstation", I'd consider it a server with the GUI 
running. That's just my perspective.

You can run "netstat" program and see all of the services that are in a 
state of "LISTEN". Run the following command as root and you'll see 
what ports are being used by the running services on your system:

netstat -lvpen

I run my gateway/firewall box and have most of my services disabled. I 
only hae SSH enabled to allow me to login to the box. I have disabled 
ftp, login, and telnet since they aren't really needed with SSH. To 
transfer files I use "scp" as a replacement for FTP.

Is your system dual-homed with 2 NICs or 1 NIC and a modem? The 
important thing about a gateway/firewall system is that if you're 
running some services, you should block access to those services that 
you only want available to your internal network inside your home. I've 
had a system setup like this for the last 4 years first with PPP dialup 
anda  modem and later with a second NIC and a cable modem.

If you're not doing any firewalling of services then your gateway system 
is at risk IMHO. Ideally I've heard and read that a gateway/firewall 
box should run as few services as possible to reduce the changes of the 
system being compromised. With proper firewall rules setup you can deny 
access to all the running servers you don't want publicly available 
while still allowing systems on your internal network access to them.

My firewall doesn't run that many services but in order to also use the 
system as a file and printer server, I have "ssh", "lpd", "samba", and 
"nfs" services running. I have firewall rules in place that keep 
outside systems blocked against all of these services. Sounds like your 
system needs some outside access since you run a webserver and 
mailserver for your home on it.

My local LAN is having problems.
I had no glitches with BIND until this weekend.
I was only sharing my ISP connection through a linux box that is a
router/dns/dhcp...

I added a few domain names to the DNS server this weekend...and in doing
so, the local lan seems to have some issues with resolving servernames on
the first/second attempts.

for example:
I will use one of the machines on the local lan, and run nslookup
It shows:
Default Server: dns.domainname.com
Addres: 192.168.0.1

>pdxlinux.org
Server: dns.domianname.com
Address: 192.168.0.1

DNS request timed out.
     timeout was 2 seconds.com
DNS request timed out.
     timeout was 2 seconds.com
*** Request to dns.domainname.com timed-out


any pointers or suggestions on how to track down this problem?
if i try the same server name 3 times or so, it eventually finds it.

Thanks for your advice.  I got it now.

One thing I could not understand.  According to my recollection, Debian 
distro has 3 CDs.  Why this distro has only one of capacity 94.4MB

Thanks

Stephen

Thought I would post here before sending the unit off to the freegeek
re-cycler.

Six foot HP rack with HP9000 tower (no disks), disk array (still has
disks), and 240V HP UPS.  I think I still have the terminal lying around
that went with the unit.  I also have another HP disk array with 
30GB of Diff-Ultra-SCSI.

Everything was last known to work.  We powered up the unit awhile back
to play with HPUX.  That was a couple years ago.  Been sitting in my
family room since.  I was waiting for a linux kernel to become stable
for PA-RISC, and now that it has, I just want to get rid of it. :)
The OS was on the disks that were in the tower, but those disks are
missing (roomie probably borrowed them for a project or something).  The
second HP disk array I used with an Adaptec Diff card (might even have
that lying around) hooked up to a Pentium running OpenBSD and then
Linux.  One of the disks I low-leveled and a power blip occurred, so one of
those disks hasn't worked, but the other three work fine (I think there
is 4 9Gb).

Free to those who want to haul the thing away. :)  Located around 66th &
Foster SE.

Less than 30 minutes and I have a taker and one on standby if the first
falls through.

So the unit is spoken for.

The full debian distro is now up to around 8 CDs if you want all of them. (they can be found at http://hogwarts.orbital.us when it comes back up, if it ever does that is :)
The reason that the ISO that you downloaded is only 94 megs is because it is a minimal install.  I believe that it has the graphical installer that does the hardware detection, etc. but then grabs the packages you want to install off of the net.  So if you do decide to use that installer, I would suggest that you have cable or DSL internet, because if you don't, you'll be waiting for quite a while.

Hi John,

Thanks for your information.

I sit on the traffic highway of speed 10mps hoping that I could use the 
graphic installer.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0209180916250.27792-100000@pecos.madboa.com>

Red Hat is trying to move past the "can't figure out which package 
will satisfy my missing dependency" difficulties many have 
experienced. If you're plagued by such things, maybe an update to rpm 
4.1 (and the attendant rpmdb-redhat package) will help.

Subject: rpm-4.1 released


Rpm 4.1 is now available at

        ftp://ftp.rpm.org/pub/rpm/dist/rpm-4.1.x

The final part of the release (6x, 7x, etc) indicates the version
of Red Hat Linux for which the package has been built. For example,
the i386 packages for Red Hat 6.2 are
        rpm-4.1-6x.i386.rpm
        rpm-devel-4.1-6x.i386.rpm
        rpm-build-4.1-6x.i386.rpm
        rpm-python-4.1-6x.i386.rpm
        popt-1.7-6x.i386.rpm

This version is also available through anonymous cvs:
        cvs -d :pserver:anonymous at cvs.rpm.org:/cvs/devel login
        (no password, just carriage return)
        cvs -d :pserver:anonymous at cvs.rpm.org:/cvs/devel get rpm
        cd rpm
        cvs up -r rpm-4_1-release
You will need the versions of libtool, autoconf, and automake identified
in autogen.sh if you wish to build from CVS.

Please report any difficulties, problems, issues, feature requests, whatever at
        http://bugzilla.redhat.com

Here's a brief summary of features that have been added. See the
CHANGES file in the src rpm for the gory details.

1) Header signatures and digests, if available, are verified when (first)
   retrieved from the rpm database.

2) The rpm database permits concurrent access. That means that it is now
   possible to run rpm in %post scriptlets.

   Note: What still remains is to find out whether there are deadlocks
   (there are), and whether the deadlocks can be avoided or otherwise
   handled gracefully. I'd really like to support (at least read)
   concurrent access to the rpm database, but it's gonna take a lot
   of careful (i.e. reproducible) testing to achieve that goal. Any
   and all help is appreciated. What's very promising is that the
   problems are deadlocks, not segfaults, but reproducing deadlocks
   is gonna be quite challenging.

3) The rpmdb-redhat package (which contains an "everything" rpm database),
   if installed, will be used to provide suggested solutions for unresolved
   dependencies. Try installing the rpmdb-redhat package from Raw Hide if
   interested.

DSA/RSA signature verification using RFC-2440 OpenPGP V3
packets is now implemented directly in rpm. The signature,
if available, is always verified when reading a package, and failures
are always reported.

Signing is done with gpg/pgp helpers as always, and both a new,
header-only, as well as the Good Old header+payload signature
are generated. In fact, all of Red Hat 7.3 was signed with rpm-4.1,
so both signatures should be present in 7.3 packages.

What's also new is pubkey management using --import. Basically
	rpm --import RPM-GPG-KEY
(or any ascii armored OpenPGP pubkey) will wrap the binary OpenPGP
packet in a header, and install just like any other package.

Here's what you see if you have not yet imported the correct pubkey(s):

bash$ sudo rpm -Uvh popt-1.7-7x.i386.rpm
warning: popt-1.7-7x.i386.rpm: Header V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID db42a60e
...

Here's what the Red Hat pubkeys look like when imported:
==========================================================================
bash$ rpm -qa | grep pubkey
gpg-pubkey-0352860f-3c3cb5e4
gpg-pubkey-db42a60e-37ea5438

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
==========================================================================

For the extremely security conscious and the overly curious, I note the
following limitations:

	1) there's no attempt (yet) to verify the signature on the
	pubkey before verifying the package signature.

	2) there's no attempt (yet) to implement any trust model using
	OpenPGP packets. All imported keys in the rpm database are considered
	trusted.

	3) only V3 signatures are implemented ATM.

If that's not to your taste, then you can export the signature from a
package and verify using gpg outside of rpm. For example, here's a
short script that verifies the traditional header+payload signatures of
a package using gpg:

==========================================================================
#!/bin/sh

for pkg in $*
do
    if [ "$pkg" = "" -o ! -e "$pkg" ]; then
	echo "no package supplied" 1>&2
	exit 1
    fi

    plaintext=`mktemp $0-$$.XXXXXX`
    detached=`mktemp $0-$$.XXXXXX`

# --- Extract detached signature
    rpm -qp -vv --qf '%{siggpg:armor}' $pkg > $detached

# --- Figger the offset of header+payload in the package
    leadsize=96
    o=`expr $leadsize + 8`

    set `od -j $o -N 8 -t u1 $pkg`
    il=`expr 256 \* \( 256 \* \( 256 \* $2 + $3 \) + $4 \) + $5`
    dl=`expr 256 \* \( 256 \* \( 256 \* $6 + $7 \) + $8 \) + $9`

    sigsize=`expr 8 + 16 \* $il + $dl`
    o=`expr $o + $sigsize + \( 8 - \( $sigsize \% 8 \) \) \% 8`

# --- Extract header+payload
    dd if=$pkg ibs=$o skip=1 2>/dev/null > $plaintext

# --- Verify DSA signature using gpg
    gpg --batch -vv --verify $detached $plaintext

# --- Clean up
    rm -f $detached $plaintext
done
==========================================================================

Enjoy

My question was really partly rhetorical and partly inquisitive.  

It is very strange to me that RedHat configured the services so that
some are opt in while others are opt out.  In fact, I wonder why there
is not an option on the installation for this.

I came to this thought bec of the recent worm.  It attacks not so much
because of Apache but because of OpenSSL and the fact that previous
versions of Apache assumed the mod_ssl would be installed.  The newer
version does not.  Now, I have no need for ssl but in my laziness I left
it alone, not really realizing the danger.

I guess I am miffed by the overall assumptions but into these things.  

Mostly, its just me pissing in the wind :)

Interestingly, I went to take your advice.  Up2Date reported that the
redhat site was busy so I went to rpm.org to get the appropriate rpms to
update rpm (say that 10 times fast) and saw an rpm for popt.

Now, recently (if you had not read my post from a few days ago) my
machine did not reboot successfully after updating a few things.  I
thought maybe it was Apache and/or OpenSSL but I had also updated RPM
via the RedHat up2date mechanism.  The error messages on the failed
reboot reported that libpopt was missing (although it was there).  I
could not figure it out, so I upgraded to RH7.3 and all is fine.

So, I am nervous about updated RPM if this messing with popt as well.

Mostly though, I am curious what libpopt is and why it screwed up my
machine.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0209180924560.11024-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I know folks here are running abiword, so perhaps you'll offer a pointer
or two. I can't get past the error boxes telling me that abiword cannot find
its fonts. According to the FAQ on the abiword web site, that can be turned
off in the program. Except that I cannot invoke the program to turn off this
message.

  The next one says that I need to use the abiword wrapper rather than
invoking it directly. So, where's the wrapper? I find nothing that looks
like a wapper.

  Also, according to the web site, I have to have the clipart package
installed, too! Even if I don't want clip art, apparently. So, being a nice
guy, I downloaded the package and installed it. Abiword still won't start.

  I'd appreciate a pointer to what I'm missing here.

  BTW, on a different, but related, topic: I discovered the source and
resolution of the open office threads running but no display problem. Turns
out to be a couple of old, old threads that were not cleared when the
program was shut down and that do not respond to the 'killall' command. When
I assassinated each process individually the program then started with its
display.

TIA,

Rich

Name        : popt
Summary     : A C library for parsing command line parameters.
Description :
Popt is a C library for parsing command line parameters. Popt was
heavily influenced by the getopt() and getopt_long() functions, but it
improves on them by allowing more powerful argument expansion. Popt
can parse arbitrary argv[] style arrays and automatically set
variables based on command line arguments. Popt allows command line
arguments to be aliased via configuration files and includes utility
functions for parsing arbitrary strings into argv[] arrays using
shell-like rules.


Without libpopt.so, some compiled programs are unable to process 
command-line arguments. I've never had a problem with that library,

I was chatting with Jeff Johnson a couple of weeks ago and he mentioned
that rpm 4.1 breaks up2date in RH7.x.

I just verified that is it does indeed break up2date, in addition to breaking
dependancies for kdeadmin, gnorpm, and ucd-snmp (perhaps more).

Be sure to try rpm 4.1 on a test box first...

What do the log files say about it?  Try restarting the DNS server,
check to see if all zones were loaded properly (particularly the hints
or root zone).

This sounds like it could be trying to do a reverse lookup (and waiting
for a time-out), or your forwarders are not responding appropriately (Do
you have forwarders set up?).

HTH a little.

That might make sense.  Along with the message about libpopt, it
indicated that initlog was the reporting application.

Probably a circular error, initlog was called with parameters but could
not find libpopt so it could not process the parameters and therefore
failed.

I am starting to get frustrated with the damned RPM dependency and my
system breaking every so often because of it.  I update less and less
because of that.  The Debian crowd is beginning to make sense ;)

How are you starting abiword?  On my system (debian woody) the correct
way to start abiword is to run /usr/bin/abiword or /usr/bin/AbiWord
which are symlinked.  /usr/bin/AbiWord is the wrapper script.

Yeah, if I'd seen that I would have taken it to part out for two

I don't suppose anyone has any extra SCSI cards for an HP D-Class lying

  /etc/localtime is set to Pacific. The date command produces the correct

Does majordomo run any daemon processes?  If so, have they been restarted
since you corrected your timezone issue?

Brian,

  You caused me to look at my system, and I had an earlier installation's
dregs still hanging around. Cleaned those up.

  Yes, /usr/bin/abiword is the link to the wrapper script in
/usr/share/AbiSuite/bin/AbiWord. I'm still getting the same, two errors and
no executable. I may uninstall the whole thing and start over.

Thanks,

galen,

  Good point! But, not that I can find. I believe it wakes up only to
respond to a message posting or to try to write a log or archive. I see
nothing in the process list.

  But, I also see that it's confined to majordomo as my message to the list
was properly time stamped.

Thanks,

Rich

I used Dotster until they adoped the policy of not reminding their

squatters to move in and snap it up. (Yeah, yeah, I should have paid
closer attention.) I don't use Dotster anymore. :-(

By chance do you have a TZ environment variable set in the runtime 
environment that majordomo is running in? I know "date" will use the TZ 
variable if it is defined and you can have a different time displayed

e.g.:

tony at tigger:~> export TZ=EST5EDT
tony at tigger:~> date
Wed Sep 18 16:04:32 EDT 2002
tony at tigger:~> export -n TZ
tony at tigger:~> date

I am not sure this is related, but when I upgraded to RH7.3 something
about the timezone broke.

I get this message upon boot:

timezone: /etc/rc3.d/S10timezone: nls: command not found
timezone: /etc/rc3.d/S10timezone: run_cmd: command not found

I used timeconfig to set the time zone which appeared to correct it but
my cron jobs still ran like they were on GMT.

Last night, I used timetool to correct the problem after another reboot
and synch up the time server with ntpd. 

I didn't see the usual cron job from early this morning, so I suspect
the cron will run at 9:30 instead of 3:30 (for example).

Not sure if all that helps, but I think if one of us solves our problem
it will at least hint at the others solution.

  No, I took that out (after trying it) when I learned it's a Bad Thing.
Majordomo runs no daemons and I've no idea where it's picking up the time. I
suppose I should ask on the majordomo mail list; I was hoping for a quick,
local answer.

Thanks, Tony,

Less a recommendation (personally, I hate laptops) than a note: I've

My suggestion would be to find the driver disk for the nic(s), and see 
if there's a configuration utility.  Install both nics, boot the driver 
disk (or other dos disk, then insert the driver disk), run the config 
utility and let it configure the nics for you.  THEN write down this 
information in case you need to pass kernel options or module options, 
and try to boot into linux.

I had two 3c509's that were set at the same IRQ/port/DMA and would panic 
the kernel every time until I reconfigured them using the above method.

Hope that helps, YMMV.  :)

Bluefish will run on most platforms since it's based on Gtk (and soon
Gtk2).

Quanta+ is a KDE tool, so it will only run where you have KDE
installed.

Aside from that, it's personal preference.

I know that the sendmail.cf file has a way to specify a timeone in it as 
well. It's supposed to use the system default if nothing is defined 
though.

I kept this around since I liked the picture Todd sent...but I just had 
another idea.

I've been looking for a keyboard for my Toshiba Protege 660CDT (kids 
spilled something into it, I think), and I noticed a LOT of laptops on 
ebay going with broken screens, no keyboard, no cdrom, no HD, no ram, 
etc etc.  In other words, people were selling every single removable 
part off of the laptop in order to maximize the selling price.

So you can look at it two ways - 1) get a good laptop screen/broken body 
and somehow frankenstein 'em together, or 2) sell your laptop peicemeal 
to try and pick up enough cash to buy a new one (or put a good amount 
down on one).

So there it is.  Hope that helps.  :)

You don't have to have KDE running to run Quanta+, it runs within
Blackbox for me.  Since I don't like KDE, I only installed Quanta+ and
its dependencies.  The only really annoying thing about Quanta is that
every once in a while text on the right side of the window will not be
displayed correctly (sometimes it won't be displayed at all).  It also
has some problems with color coding the HTML keywords if PHP scripts are
used within the HTML.  OTOH, I really like the preview.  The type of
stuff I'm doing could easily be done with a plain text editor (mostly
copy and paste then preview), so I can't comment on its usefulness as a
real development tool.

I think I'll try Bluefish now.

Because that is a "netinst" image.  It contains only the installer, not
the software packages.  Those will be downloaded from the net by the
installer.

If you are installing several computers, you should investigate

I usually use perl:

perl -ne 'print if $. == 1' textfile

where $. is the current line number.

You can also use combinations of head and tail:

First line:

  head -1

Second line:

  head -2 | tail -1

Ok, so I booted with DrDos and used the dos setup program.  The good
news is that within the program it appears that both NICs work.  The bad
news is that in linux it still doesn't work, in the exact same manner.

Any other ideas?

No...  because the email will change and it's possible it could appear on
a different line as well.  I have to be sure I'm only storing line 2 in
that particular variable.  I'll use the head/tail combo suggested.
Thanks,

here are 2 ways to do it ...

#!/bin/bash
EMAIL=`awk 'NR==1 {print;}`

  I would reach for awk; others will advocate perl, python, ruby, scheme ...

  This is a pattern-match/take-action activity for which awk was designed.
Yes, the scripting languages will do this, too. I know awk so that's what I
suggest. :-)

  This is an idea. It is only an idea. If it was a real solution it would
come with no disclaimers.

  I have 2 NetGear NICS in my firewall box. Both the same model number, both
almost identical. However, only 1 uses the tulip driver; the other one is
slightly different. PITA, but that's what happened. Perhaps this is what
happened to you, too.

Yeah, I was thinking that the EMAIL and SUBJECT would be in the text 
file as well, not fully comprehending exactly what you were wanting.

Sorry.  :)

What version of abiword are you using? I discovered in upgrading from
1.0.1 to 1.0.2 that if abiword couldn't get the fonts in
/usr/share/AbiSuite/fonts/ from the X server, it absolutely refused to
start up in the manner you describe.

The message I saw claimed that this *might* be the reason why abiword
couldn't find its fonts. In my case, it was something else -- I wasn't
allowing xfs to read /usr/share/AbiSuite/fonts/. As such, I believe the
warning about not running the wrapper is a red herring.

I almost wish that were true.  Both nics work with the driver, but only
if they are in the bottom slot or all by themselves *sigh*

Ok, second through, I'm using debian on this box, and I wanted to use
Linux for the iptables stuff.  But does anybody think that a BSD would
work better?

I'm using the 2.4.19 kernel

Does the setup program have the ability to hard-set the IRQ and I/O? 
These values could then be used to load the modules with the appropriate
settings, kind of forcing the issue.  I've also seen it where identical
cards needed two separate modules to load, in that case, I just copied
the one module to a file with a different name, then had the kernel load
both modules.

Hey and according to the Advanced Bash scripting howto you can do in
directly from bash:

http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/internal.html#READREDIR

And straight from the howto:
#!/bin/bash

read var1 <data-file
echo "var1 = $var1"
# var1 set to the entire first line of the input file "data-file"

read var2 var3 <data-file
echo "var2 = $var2   var3 = $var3"
# Note non-intuitive behavior of "read" here.
# 1) Rewinds back to the beginning of input file.
# 2) Each variable is now set to a corresponding string,
#    separated by whitespace, rather than to an entire line of text.
# 3) The final variable gets the remainder of the line.
# 4) If there are more variables to be set than whitespace-terminated
strings
#    on the first line of the file, then the excess variables remain
empty.

Good luck,
Jason

I believe the devices in question are pci.  pci configuration is soft, and
typically done by the bios.  I wonder if a bios upgrade would solve the
problem.  Does lspci or cat /proc/pci show both cards, despite only one
being functional?  What does the scanpci command return?

Another possibility is that both PCI slots are sharing an IRQ. This 
could make the configuration you are attempting impossible.

abiword-1.0.2-2.

  And there's something I read that says with XFree96-4, or RH 7.3, that X
no longer uses a font server but gets them itself. How, I have no idea.

  Yes, doesn't matter if it's the wrapper or a hot-dog roll, I don't even
get a pickled herring. I guess I better learn how to train xfs to look at
the font directory.

  I recall reading here a few years ago, that either Open or NetBSD was
slightly better than linux for a firewall application. I don't recall
exactly why, but it was security related.

This shouldn't necessarily be a problem.  It might be worthwhile to have

OpenBSD is often chosen over say, RedHat, since OpenBSD is designed to be
secure "out of the box", whereas RedHat is designed to be working "out of
the box".

There are lots of choices which would make a good firewall os-- OpenBSD
being one.  Another one which looks interesting (and requires more
work) is LIDS (http://www.lids.org/).  This provides excellent protection
against hacks since even root canot modify protected files (which you need
to define) without a system reboot.

I would suggest:

1) Check your /etc/modules.conf to ensure that you have aliases for both
eth0 and eth1 listed.  For example:

alias eth0 ne2k-pci
alias eth1 ne2k-pci

The easiest way to get this change to take effect is to reboot.

If that doesn't help:

2) Grab "mii-diag" and "libmnii.c" from http://www.scyld.com/diag/ and
compile with "gcc -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O mii-diag.c -DLIBMII
libmii.c -o mii-diag".  Try running ./mii-diag eth0 and ./mii-diag
eth1.  This is a pretty low-level diagnostic, so the information is rather
obscure.

Unless you get the error "SIOCGMIIPHY on eth1 failed: No such device",
then you have an eth1 present.  If you get that error, then there is
something wrong with the module load.

3) Try loading the module manually with "insmod ne2k-pci debug=2" to
enable some rather pathetic debugging.  Use "dmesg" to view the output
after loading.  (This should also be in /var/log/messages.)

This was a good read, very informative.  I think the lesson here is (for
pci devices): if you can't assign an IRQ to a slot in your BIOS, the
only other way to change the IRQ assignment is to put the card in a
different slot.  BTW, an easy way to free up IRQ's (15 just isn't enough
to go around) is to disable (in the BIOS) any unneeded serial and
parallel ports.

Message-ID: <200209181638.01663.aschlemm@attbi.com>

With a properly setup syste with firewalling enabled I think either 
Linux or OpenBSD make a pretty good firewall. I ran with a firewall 
using ipchains under various versions of 2.2.x for more than 4 years 
and I'm now trying the other "BSD" side of things. Within the last week 
I have setup a OpenBSD 3.1 system using "pf" and am using that as my 
network's gateway/firewall system. The stateful firewalling is very 
nice and has significantly reduced the complexity of my firewall rules 
I had with ipchains. I could do the same thing with Linux using 
"iptables" which are also stateful.

I know I could enable enough services on my OpenBSD system to make it 
insecure too. But by default I was impressed that OpenBSD only had 
"ssh" service running by default and nothing else. No telnet or login 
service or anything else that uses clear text passwords. I thought I 
was going to miss FTP since I use it to transfer files around but I've 
found "scp" to an adequate replacement and use it to transfer files 
between my BSD and other Linux systems.

Probably the most difficult part of OpenBSD is that when a security fix 
comes out it is in source form and so I have to patch code and compile 
things. If the patch affects a library that may be statically linked 
with other programs I end up first compiling a new kernel and then I 
compile the entire basic OpenBSD system. 

I "nice" the build process and just let it go off and do its thing and 
check on it the next day since it takes 8-9 hours to build everything. 
My system is a typical underpowered firewall box with a lowly AMD K6 
CPU hence the long build times. 

With Linux I just download a new RPM from my distro provider. Again I 
made this my choice and I'm willing to live with a little bit extra 
work doing full system builds to keep my OpenBSD system patched and 
up-to-date.

Sharing IRQs isn't necessarily bad.  The PCI bus was design
with this in mind.  It is only due to the brain damaged ISA bus that
people have come to expect each device to have its own interrupt.  With
ISA, if two devices were both in use, no sharing was possible.  With PCI,
sharing is not a problem.

Also the memory space used by the cards could be the same. 
If possible try using a card from another mfgr in the other slot.
Or. see if there is a jumper setting on the card for irq/memory range.
Or. see if there is a utility available that lets you set these through
software.

Or. A small C4 charge placed in the appropriate place followed by
consumption of copius amounts of beer.:)

Strangest thing.  The last couple of nights I've been trying to get ISA
NICs working in this thing (It's OLD 120mhz), anyways, None of them
would work, so I figured it was just the NICs, but I was getting strange
output using ethreal, I could see packets flowing from the box, and too
the box, but the box didn't see the packets.

Anyways, With a both PCI nics in there, and a ISA nic in there, for some
reason the ISA nic works, that means out of 3 cards in the box, 2 are
working.  For the time being this is good enough for me...Maybe I'll
work on it more later...Firewall setup time

I thought I read somewhere that 2 PCI cards could share the same IRQ
with no problem.  Because it's true, the two NICs have the same IRQ.
But I have no way to set them

Those were very good suggestions. You also might want to look in the
kernel source and see if there is a README along with that driver.

I seem to recall that some nic drivers need a little configuration help to
let them know that there are two of the same device installed. If that's
the case with the ne2k driver, then that would explain why one of them
works when you have the ISA nic installed as well.

I am under the impression (and I've experienced the same) that this only 
applied if the cards sharing the same IRQ weren't the same type of card.

In other words, a sound card and a NIC could share, but two NICs couldn't.

Maybe it was my hardware that wouldn't handle it, or the driver couldn't 
handle it.

Hey!~

I know this is off topic but there are a lot of smart people on this list
and I thought that someone might be able to help me with this problem.

This is probably more of a datatbase question than a Linux question.

I need someone who can show me how to do the following (consultant or just
someone good with databases and programs):

List A (45,000 records) has: Name, Address, City, State, Zip

List B (100,000) has: Name, Address, City, State, Zip, Additional Data,
Additional Data.......

I need to compare the two lists and MARK the records in List A that exist in
list B (They need to be marked in List A). Using Linux would be great but I
don't have a functioning Linux box right now and I need the data on the
Windows box because the software the will ultimately use the list has not
Linux alternative.

Has anyone done anything like this before? I would be more than happy to pay
someone to teach me how to accomplish this task.

I have some other database tasks that need to be accomplished, and I just
need some help!

Thanks,

Jeremy Bowen

I couldn't figure out what was going on on my laptop with my time, but I
found a helpful page :

http://www.linuxsa.org.au/tips/time.html

Being new to Linux, I didn't realize that there is a local time, a system
time, AND a hardware time.

There's also this :

The time in some applications is wrong

If some applications (such as date) display the correct time, but others
don't, and you are running Red Hat Linux 5.0 or 5.1, you most likely have
run into a bug caused by a move of the timezone information from
/usr/lib/zoneinfo to /usr/share/zoneinfo. The fix is to create a symbolic
link from /usr/lib/zoneinfo to /usr/share/ zoneinfo: ``ln -s
../share/zoneinfo /usr/lib/zoneinfo''.

The main point I was trying to make was that PCI hardware supports IRQ
sharing.  It is certainly possible that the driver doesn't support it,
though it seems from a quick google search that there are people using
2 ne2k-pci cards.

I'm going to have to "me too" for the the Thinkpad T series.  I had
Linux running beautifully on a T20 and T21.  Very nice intel based
laptops.

I've gone to the grey side (not the dark side).  I sold both my T's to

This would be a trivial perl script.  The only hard part would be for you
to define how closely the records need to match.  For example:
  + Exact name match, but address differs
  + Exact name match, address match, ZIP differs
  + is name match case-sensitive or not?
  + Name doesn't match, but address does
  + Other combinations

Suggested program structure: (optimized for speed and simplicity at the
expense of using more memory than it might otherwise.  With as few
records as you have, this shouldn't be a problem on any modern PC.)

  + pull list A into a hash, index by the item(s) you want to match
exactly
  + pull list B into a hash, index it the same way
  + for each hash index in B, pull the matching record from A

Hi All Folks,

KOnCD and Xcdroast work properly.

Tests performed as follows:
====================
Have following packages downloaded

and saved them to /tmp/UDF

# cd /tmp/UDF/
# tar -zxvf udf-0.9.6.tar.gz

# cd /tmp/UDF/udf-0.9.6

[root at localhost udftools-1.0.0b2]# ./configure;make; make install

Went through without complaint

Insert a blank new CD-RW to CDWriter

mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/scd0,

Is it? Do you lists reside in a database, or are they in text files?

If they're in an SQL-addressable database, and you're sure that List B 
records are identical to List A records except for the additional 
data, then

  select
    a.name, a.address, a.city, a.state, a.zip
  from
    a,b
  where
    a. name   = b.name    and
    a.address = b.address and
    a.city    = b.city    and
    a.state   = b.state   and
    a.zip     = b.zip

If the data in the fields that exist in A and B aren't *identical*,
however, then you'll have some trouble...

This is only theoretical, in practice, I've seen many pci devices that
would exhibit odd behavior, or just wouldn't work because of an IRQ
conflict.  The 3Dfx Voodoo cards are the worst offenders, they MUST have
an IRQ, and it MUST be the only device using it.  Sound cards and NIC's
are next on the list.  The best running systems have one device per IRQ,
this became my system builders mantra.

As have I. However, on occasion, I've run into the motherboard that 
shares IRQs between PCI slots that are next to each other. The solution 
(and this never fails, when it's available) is to put the NICs in the 
machine with a slot seperating them. Or even just move one card to the 
slot on the other side of the other NIC. Either action would cause the 
card to now be in a slot that is not sharing an IRQ.

In this case, that's not an option, as there are only two PCI slots. I 
suspect the driver needs different IRQs, or it wouldn't know where to 
talk when that interupt signals. I suspect that's the root reason for 
the problem we're trying to troubleshoot here.

I just looked at the ne2k-pci driver source.  It certainly looks like it
supports shared irqs.

static int ne2k_pci_open(struct net_device *dev)
{
        int ret = request_irq(dev->irq, ei_interrupt, SA_SHIRQ, dev->name, dev);
                                                      ^^^^^^^^
This flag tells the kernel that the driver supports shared interrupts.  That
doesn't necessarily mean it works, but at least the author was thinking
about the issue.

If you have access to "Linux Device Drivers, 2nd Ed.", you can read about
interrupt sharing starting on page 274.

  Views on Linux in Business

  --by Doc Searls, Senior Editor of Linux Journal
     _________________________________________________________________

                               Deskward bound

   As I write this, on Wednesday morning, all eyes and ears are trained
   in the direction of Sun Microsystems, which is announcing new Linux
   desktop hardware (among other Linux-related items) at the company's
   Sun Network:
   http://sunnetwork.sun.com/ show in San Francisco:

   <http://sunnetwork.sun.com/>

   The Big Picture stories have already appeared in the Wall Street
   Journal and the New York Times:
   :

   <http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/18/technology/18SUN.html>

   Both position the new boxes as threats to Microsoft. Given Sun's
   severe antipathy toward Microsoft, that's an easy story to tell. In
   fact, this morning the Times is running an editorial endorsing Linux,
   presumably on the occasion of the Sun announcement. "The New Challenge
   to Microsoft":
   , opens with this:

   As the government's antitrust lawsuit winds down, Microsoft's next
   battle may be a knock-down, drag-out fight against Linux. Like
   Microsoft's Windows, Linux is a computer operating system, but written
   and updated by volunteer programmers in a communitarian spirit, and
   available for free. If Linux spreads, Microsoft could see the first
   real challenge to its dominance of the operating-system software
   market. For consumers, that would be good news.

   And it closes with this:

   Government units abroad and in the United States and individual
   computer users should look for ways to support Linux and Linux-based
   products. The competition it offers helps everyone.

   <http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/18/opinion/18WED2.html>

   That's a nice endorsement, but it doesn't touch the real fight that's
   going on, which is for shelf space among each big vendor's UNIX
   offerings, which was the topic of the last SuitWatch:
   :

   <http://www.ssc.com/pipermail/suitwatch/2002q3/000029.html>

   News came yesterday that IBM plans add:
   its pSeries of servers to the growing list of Big Blue hardware lines
   running Linux. Those already include the xSeries of Intel-based
   servers, the iSeries midrange servers and zSeries mainframes:

   <http://news.com.com/2100-1001-958354.html>.

   IBM is also working on "improving" Linux in ways the help it run on
   the company's Power4-based systems, including the pSeries.

   In a related announcement:
   http://news.com.com/2100-1001-958002.html, IBM and Red Hat say Red Hat
   will be supplying Advanced Server software for IBM's heavier iron: the
   p, i and zSeries. Red Hat already supports the xSeries.

   In one announcement after another, IBM makes clear its intention to
   make Linux work every possible place it makes sense. The company
   appears to be making no attempt to protect AIX, or any of its other
   operating systems, from Linux. From the Linux perspective, IBM has a
   shelf that includes all kinds of hardware.

   Not so with Sun. A Reuters story says "Sun argues Linux is a low-end
   complement to Solaris and keeps customers out of the Microsoft camp."
   In other words, Linux is Sun's low-end OS. That's where it sits on
   Sun's OS shelf. Which is fine: different company, different strategy.
   We'll see how it goes.

   There is good reason for Sun to concentrate right now on corporate
   PCs. Reports on a survey:
   by SG Cowen say IT spending growth will rise 1.8% in 2002 and 3.4% in
   2003, with anticipated spending closest to flat among the largest
   firms. But while PC spending is "entrenched" in a 4-year cycle,
   corporate PC upgrade budgets are due to increase 17% in 2002 and 20%
   in 2003. The primary suppliers are still IBM and Dell, with HP/Compaq
   having a "reduced role" in future spending plans. Meanwhile, all of
   those companies are pushing their Linux server offerings. Not Linux
   desktops.

   <http://www.sgcowen.com/rs/rs3.html>
   <http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/7/27010.html>

   In fact, finding desktop hardware is easier at Wal-Mart than at any of
   the Big Three corporate desktop suppliers, as I reported in a Linux
   Journal Web piece about Sun's latest anticipated offerings:

   <http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6327>

   That leaves a significant hole. Sun doesn't have a Microsoft
   relationship to protect. It can much more easily imagine PC business
   that doesn't swap Linux into boxes originally meant to run Windows. It
   can zero-base its PC strategy in a Windows-free way. That's a huge
   advantage.

   Even if all Sun sells is droneware for corporate cubicle hives (what I
   suspect at this point, still in the absence of input), at least it's
   offering something that the Big Three are not.

   Yet.

   Until the Big Three get on the stick, the primary competition for Sun
   will be commodity white boxes. Are companies already buying white
   boxes by the trainload likely to go for the Sun brand? Not clear. It
   would help if they were already Sun customers, and taking advantage of
   the application environments Sun talks about on its Linux page:

   <http://wwws.sun.com/software/linux/>

   The question then for Sun is whether or not its successes with Linux
   will be at the expense of PC vendors and Microsoft, or of itself.
   After all, that same SG Cowen survey showed both Linux and Windows
   gaining momentum, with Linux growth coming at the expense of other
   UNIX variants.

   It also said Linux was already running at 44% of the companies
   surveyed, with 45% planning to emphasize Linux more in the future.

   This invites a new concept: the Linux hardware replacement cycle. At
   some point all these competitors will have to count on it. And that
   will be a huge sign of Linux' success.

Good call! OS X seems like it's well on the way to becoming a great
desktop Unix. A few teething problems, but I'll forgive it due to
new-ness. Apple's made large strides in the past year or so.
It's really cool being able to have the Mac ease (that is, things I
don't care to learn about just work right off the bat), combined with
the ability to run all your favorite Unix apps. I installed XDarwin
shortly after I installed Debian. Downloaded and compiled the source
for vim, and it works great. Looks a bit odd alongside the OS X
native stuff since gvim runs under X, and I'm using BlackBox as the
WM, but oh well. :-)  For those that want the entire XFree86 experience,
you can run X full-screen (as opposed to "rootless"), and not see any of
the Aqua GUI at all.

Debian install is a snap (at least on the latest G4 PowerBooks),
though I haven't gotten X to work yet. Apple changed the TiBook's
display back in May, and it doesn't look like the Debian-PPC package
maintainers have caught up yet. It's not an X issue, apparently --
all of the major PPC-centric Linux distros claim X works just fine.

I'm trying to find my way around some STL (standard template library)

I haven't seen any email from the list since last night. I
am forced to rely on the archives at lists.pdxlinux.org to
see what I missed. (Which includes updating the information
for tonight's Advanced Linux Topics meeting.) I'm not having
ANY problems with the other mail lists I'm subscribed to.

Did I get banned or something?

As somebody already pointed out, the success of any method is largely
dependent on the consistency of data in the two lists.  While it is
really a database task, you might be able to get some results sooner
by considering the `comm' command (man comm to learn more).  With a
little awk, tr, and other shell magic, one could get some reliable
output without going through the effort of installing a database
server and learning SQL.

This is admittedly a quick and dirty solution.  If this data will be
used for other things in the future, then the investment of time in the
database solution would probably be worth making sooner or later.

Good luck -

I think a database is likely overkill for this.  Let's assume for a moment
the following facts:

1.  The lists are in CSV (comma separated value) flat files.
2.  The data is rather dirty (arbitrary    spacing and caPitaliZation), but
none is missing.

The strategy I would try is:

1.  Remove all non-word characters, leaving only letters, numbers, and
underscores.
2.  Lower case all letters.
3.  Join the fields in List A into one field and make them hash keys.
4.  Iterate over List B and check for existence in List A.  If it exists,
stuff into an array.

The following quick, dirty, and untested code (in Perl) should give you an
idea of what I mean:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use Text::CSV_XS;
my $csv = Text::CVS_XS->new;

my ( $list_a, $list_b ) = ('list_a.txt','list_b.txt');
my %list_a;
open LIST_A, "< $list_a" or die $!;
while (<LIST_A>) {
    next if ! $_; # skip empty lines
    if ( $csv->parse($_) ) {
        my $data = join '', $csv->fields;
        $data =~ s/\W//g; # that's a capital W
        $data = lc $data;
        $list_a{ $data } = 1;
    }
    else {
      warn "List_a: could not parse " . $csv->error_input;
    }
}
close LIST_A;

my @match;

open LIST_B, "< $list_b" or die $!;
while( <LIST_B> ) {
    next if ! $_;
    if ( $csv->parse($_) ) {
        my $data = join '', $csv->fields;
        $data =~ s/\W//g;
        $data = lc $data;
        push @match => [$csv->fields] if exists $list_a{ $data };
    }
    else {
        warn "List_b: could not parse " . $csv->error_input;
    }
}
close LIST_B;
# @match now has a list of matching records (an array of arrayrefs)

Let me know if you have any questions.

Oops!  There was a bug in my code.  Creating the $data key in the second
while loop should only use the fields defined in List A.  The second while
loop should define data as follows:

    my $data = join '', @{$csv->fields}[0..4];

Also, my heuristic was a general case that should catch *most* of that
matches, but that greatly depends on the data.

Curtis

    I know this seems like a silly question, but I need to know.

    I was thinking that since Wine runs in the Linux file system
it could look for linux files in root, but it doesn't this doesn't
look promising.  Wine lets you map these files out.

You could install custom registry keys right?  Then assuming you have the
ability to modify the program, you can check the value of those keys.

Perhaps I'm missing the point.  Do you want to be able to detect this if
someone installs the software on a computer you have no control over (ie.
end user systems)?

Is this some sort of attempt to prevent users from preempting programs

Visit:

http://www.pdxlinux.org/dc/

And enter "template" in the search box at the bottom of the left panel.

The "/dc/" URL is provided by the "doc-central" package and "doc-base". 
The STL documentation you'll find there is provided by the (drum roll
please) "stl-manual" package.  You don't need to use a web server and
doc-central to access that STL manual on localhost; you can always get
to it directly via a file:// URL.

You will also find that the "devhelp" books and/or the *-doc packages (
in particular, the libc-doc) contain usefully available documentation. 
Try "devhelp" and see if you like it, and also try "info libc" once as
well.

Karl, is there a better way to view info files?  I've never really liked
the info program.  Is there a way I could view the files from Emacs,
convert them to another format, or do something else with them?

The "normal" way to view info files is from within Emacs: C-h i

Another way to view them is at:

  <http://www.gnu.org/manual/>

or more specifically:

  <http://www.gnu.org/manual/glibc-2.2.5/libc.html>

David,

  I think this would be inimical to the whole idea of wine. The point is to
have Microsoft-written programs run in linux and not know the difference.
Wine replaces the winderz API with the equivalent calls for linux. There are
also dummy .dlls that make the application feel comfortable while the linux
.so does the actual work.

  That's why you asked. It's OK.

  Wine runs on a linux fs, but I believe that the application and data need
to be on a vfat (type 6) fs. I haven't tried copying an application to ext3,
but I'm making progress installing an application off the cdrom and putting
it on a vfat partition.

  I wouldn't let wine, or an application running over it, anywhere near
/root or /.

I don't think so.  I just recently ran my first ever Wine application,
a MS Fortran application written at BPA.  

I did this because it allowed me to run the thing (it was a long
running computation) on a stable box (my analysis workstation) rather
than on my only MS platform, my laptop which is on/off all the time
and moves around.

Anyway, it runs fine from an ext2 file system and thus, I infer,
probably all others.  No vfat filesystem in sight on the box in
question.

WINE does *not* need a FAT partition.  It works fine on ext2.  It creates 
a fake DOS drive and file hierarchy.  Not certain how it handles older DOS 
apps that hook the file interupts directly.  Probably justs emulates the 
INT calls.

  That's both interesting and encouraging.

  I'm trying to get wine to run one Win app (but I have to figure out first
how to install it from the cdrom; install shield goes so far and chokes) and
one DOS app (using wineconsole). It would be nice to be able to run WP9 on
my copy of wine, too.

Alan,

  So the applications don't need to be on a vfat partition, either?
Interesting. Have you any insight into using wine to install an app from the
cdrom using the install shield on the disk? The folks on the Usenet
newsgroup don't have a lot of help to offer.

Thanks,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] wvdial/ppp problems
Message-ID: <20020919180613.D1653@defiant>

Howdy!

A while back, I posted a question regarding a problem I'm having with
a local provider (who doesn't know how their dialup is configured).
The service works fine with Windows and OS/2, but the modem hangs up
immediately after the login/passwd sequence; preventing ppp from
establishing a link.

I've read the man pages for wvdial and ppp, but I can't seem to get
enough data from the debug sequence to determine what's not happening.

When I log into pacifier, I get a gibberish string that ppp
understands right after the login. But pacifier lost their contract
with the local POPs on the Olympic Peninsula a couple months ago, so
I'm dialing into NcPlus.net, and their login doesn't provide the ppp
gibberish string.

A shell account is available with ssh, and I've logged in that way, to
find that a linux server is handling the shell session; but the tech
folks have made it clear that they don't support linux!

So, I'm now clueless as to what I need to do to make my modem connect
to that service.

Please reply to me, as well as the list, because I'm not receiving
messages from the list currently; I've set it to no mail until I get
this particular issue resolved - once that is done, then I'll be able
to do regular connects (probably via cron).

Thanx for whatever help you can provide.

If that doesn't work, perhaps you'll get additional help by telling us

Install Shield is a pretty thorny app. The only thing that usually works 
is the Transgaming version of Wine.

What app are you trying to use?  I am going to be doing more on this as I 
have a couple of apps I want to get working under Linux.  (Pagemaker is #1 
on my list.)

Another problem is that each implementation of WINE builds its own fake 
Windows tree.  You start getting a problem of multiple versions eating up 
your drive.  (As well as one app nedding something installed in another 
version of WINE.)

In "The Good Old Days"(r), you didn't connect a system to the network
unless you had a lot of resources ($$$).  It was a gentlemen's agreement
to limit TCP ports <1024 to 'system-only' privileges.  After all, the
system wouldn't be in existence if there wasn't a professional staff to
support it.

Therefore, if I contacted a system at port 79 (finger), I could be fairly
certain that I was getting an answer from a system admin program.  If the
admin wasn't running fingerd, then a random user could hang a daemon on
that port and send any old bogus answer.  This gets even more interesting
when you peruse the low-numbered port names ... ftp, ssh, telnet, smtp,
time, nameserver, tacacs, domain, bootps & bootpc, tftp, finger, ntp,
auth, sunrpc, ....

 > Is this some sort of attempt to prevent users from preempting programs
 > Like sshd from using it's usuall port?
Yes ... or worse, spoofing the daemon.

I think, that at some level, even, there was a facility which could be
used to propogate authentication from one system to another.  Basically,
if a program on Host A connected to Host B from a low numbered port, and
Host A's protocal said "this is user 'X'", then Host B would accept that.

... then personal computers got cheap to network, and easy to connect, and
no one could ever trust a low-numbered port again ...

In addition to the other tools people have mentioned (emacs,
gnome-help-browser, galeon), pinfo is another info viewer that uses lynx

Close, the ports < 1024 being "special" was introduced by the boys from
Berkeley for the rsh commands (rsh, rcp, rlogin).  The rsh commands were
the predecessors of the ssh commands (ssh, scp, slogin).  Since rsh and
rcp did not have a way to prompt for a password, they had to be
"trusted" to work.  The security scheme that they came up with was that
if the connection "came" from a port < 1024 it had to be a root process
and therefore trusted.  Not very secure, but it worked in the
environment for which it was designed.

Greetings:

Sometime ago I noticed quite a few people looking for
jobs.

For those that are willing to live overseas check this
position out:

http://www.osce.org/employment/generate.php3?vn_id=797

This organization is affiliated with NATO, operates in
similar fashion as the United Nations (UN) so it is
easy to move on to UN in the future.

Pay, by the way, is great as you are also paid "per
diem" and many other benefits.  Location is not that
great but you get to meet people from all over the
world.

To qualify, you must have US, Canadian or European
citizenship.

There will be another position coming up that requires
knowledge of MySQL with preferable knowledge of human
resource policies.

My sister works there so if you have other questions
feel free to email me directly.

Lynn

I've just started playing around with wine again, and my observation
is that wine doesn't care where an install shield type installation
is started from, "wine /mnt/cdrom/setup.exe" or 
"wine home/user/download/setup.exe" both seem to both work fine,
regardless of whether the app is actually in a wine recognized file
system or not.

BTW, xwine and the quake3 game demo install and work flawlessly.
Not much else seems to work perfectly though. So far I've run into
things like the mouse being yanked back to the center of screen about
5 times per second, or the install working fine, but the app itself
won't open. I'm trying to find a way to get a lot of the older kid
games working on Linux, specifically things like Reader Rabbit grades
1-4 and the like. Anybody else have any experiences with this?

  The application I'm trying to install and run is MapInfo, and I'm doing it
for a friend in Colorado. If there's a way to run MI over wine we'll see a
lot of people and companies defenstrating and migrating to linux.

  From ~/ I:
	mount /mnt/cdrom
	wine /mnt/cdrom/SETUP.EXE

		Dialog box: "Setup was unable to set the directory to
				Z:\home\rshepard\install"

	cd /usr/share/wine-c/Program\ Files/
	wine /mnt/cdrom/SETUP.EXE

		Dialog box: "Setup was unable to set the directory to
				c:\Program Files\install"

(as root):
	mkdir /usr/share/wine-c/Program\ Files/install
(as user):
	wine /mnt/cdrom/SETUP.EXE

		Dialog box: "C:\Program Files\install\demo32.exe <-- This
				command failed."

	wine /mnt/cdrom/INSTALL/DEMO32.EXE

		Splash screen comes up.

In a virtual terminal I see this:

	"err:mmsys: MMDRV_InitHardcoded  You didn't set up properly the
config file for the wine multimedia modules. Will use the hardcoded setup,
buit this will disappear soon. Please add a WinMM section to your Wine
Config file."

  In ~/.wine/conf I have:

[WinMM]
"Drivers" = "wineoss.drv"
"WaveMapper" = "msacm.drv"
"MidiMapper" = "midimap.drv"

	Anyway, from the splash screen's menus I can look at a couple of
things, but clicking on the "programs" button does nothing. Bypassing the
eye candy, and from my ~/:

	wine -- /mnt/cdrom/INSTALL/MI_PRO/DISK1/SETUP.EXE

		Install Shields starts, then halts with: "5: Internal error
					in Windows Installer."

This is as far as I've gotten. Perhaps we need a wine SIG within PLUG and we
can all work on this together. :-)

Thanks,

Rich

Hi there, 

I am new to the area but not to Linux (5 years). I am curious if anyone has played with Mandrake 9.0 yet? It is in RC3 and due for release. 

Thanks in advance

Yes, this is a strange request; but for some reason I'm interested
in writing a Windows program that suppose to perform slightly differently
depending on if it is being ran:

        (1) On native Windows
        (2) On Windows under VM-Ware
        (3) On Windows under wine
        (4) and so on.

Thus, my Windows program needs to know if it has been started from
wine.

Tried to download it. 
Gave up after 3 days. (it kept stopping after about 2 hours.)
 
I am eagerly awaiting the release of the revamped Corel distribution Xandor.
Supposed to be released around the 30th. For now my Caldera 3.1.1 and
OpenOffice keep me busy experimenting.

Jim,

  What do you see when you type, "ls -l /dev/cdrom"?

No, wine runs just fine with everything on a Linux file system like
ext2, ext3, or reiserfs.  I haven't used wine very much, but the few
applications I have used with wine have either not ran at all or
else ran quite well.

MS Fortran!!  This was Micro Soft's somewhat successful attempt to
kill a great language.  MS Fortran is the buggiest compiler I've
ever used.  I guess Micro Soft has never had much use for mathematics
or science.

Jim,

Run as root, the following command:

This should resolve this issue under RH 7.2

Yes indeed, what I'm asking is inimical to the whole idea of wine;
and I recommended against doing this.  However, the powers that be
believe they need to do this, so I will tell them how to do it.

I'm learning more about wine and win4lin as well.
I have generally worried about using these programs for security reasons,
but they are better than I thought.  I still prefer the approach
VMWare takes of using virtual file systems, but I think you can
limit wine and win4lin's access to the host system enough to
prevent massive infection by Windows software.

                                          Sincerely,

While trying to resolve some layout problems with the website
(which looks like is caused by some clever programming -- ugh,
clever programming will be the downfall of all software), I
tested some links to consultants who support Linux & found the
following lead to dead websites:

Cowboyz.com -- www.cowboyz.com

JHCC -- www.jhenshaw.com

(All of the other consultant links prove to lead to working
websites.)

Does anyone know if these companies have moved their websites or
are they victims of the High Tech slump & busy at, er, alternate
projects to pay the rent?

Please cc any responses to my email address -- I'm still not
getting any traffic. (And Paul Heinlein is probably waiting for
me to start reciting parts of the Black Knight episode.)
And posting this *does* feel like talking to a wall.

Hello Folks,

This Saturday is the third one this month so that means it must be time
for the Linux Clinic.

We're meeting in our new location at Riverdale High School. 
Directions: http://hs.riverdale.k12.or.us/directions.html\

We'll be here from 1:00 - 4:00. I have a CD full of open source software
that runs on Windows and Macs as well as the latest (almost ready for
release...) K12LTSP. We'll be making copies of those and helping you
install stuff on your Linux boxes.

For more info on the clinics see:
http://riverdale.k12.or.us/~danh/

Looking forward to seeing you,

;-) Paul

Sadly, I now live down in corvallis, and can't make it to this, though I
would really really like to hear this.  I was wondering if it was
possible for somebody to recorde this, put it up as an OGG, and then
tell me or the list.

Heh, yeah.  Not my choice.  We were hoping to pry some money out of
them for me to rewrite it as a distributed version in C, but it didn't
happen.  Would still be cool though.

a friend of mine had me do the following:

It worked.  Now I need to review what I did.

Subject: [PLUG] Fighting ORDB for 3 days now.....
Message-ID: <1032555940.15627.39.camel@kat.zotnet.com>

I have been fighting ORDB for 3 days straight.  I do not think I have a
confusing setup, but I am lost.

I have a mail server.

It is the local STMP outbound server for a few class C's.
It is the main server inbound for several domains.

I cannot seem to block attacks in the style of:

"marvin at marvin.ordb.org@XXX.ISPREVERSEDNS.com"@MAIL.MYDOMAIN.com
marvin at marvin.ordb.org@[IP.FOR.SERVER.XXX]

I have tried a number of things and now I am likely confused to all
hell.

I am running Mandrake 7.2, postfix-1.1.11-7.mdk7x (built on system)
Postfix has been upgraded, so maybe the main.cf is out of date

It seems like permit_networks is sending an OK, and therefore bypassing
the rest of smtpd_recipient_restrictions.  I have tried moving it
around, but it either blocks me send mail from mynetworks, or allows the
spam tricks on through...

Also do I need check_relay_domains, since I do to relay for anyone (I
accept, process and forward all local domains).


I used to say sendmail was more tricky than postfix, but after the last
three days of painstaking research and testing, I am no longer the sure.

Any help would be appreciated.  Please keep in mind the current setup
below for _restrictions has been changed over 100 times, so repeats and
order oddities are to be expected.

I have read in detail

Fortran is a fine language.  My compliant is MS Fortran.  Actually,
back when I was doing lots of Fortran I never found a good Fortran
for small computers.  MS Fortran was buggy.  However, all the
Fortrans I used on small computers (those running DOS, Windows, or
Apple OS) were slow, slow, slow; and Fortran isn't very useful unless
it executes numerical code fast.

I used g77 on my last Fortran project (That was 4 or 5 years ago).
This was a port of 300+ programs from Primos to AIX and Linux.
I didn't have time to do much bench marking, but the resulting
code seemed ok.  It felt more like a mainframe or workstation Fortran
than one of those baby Fortrans they built for small computers.

Of course, g77 follows the 1977 Fortran standard instead of the
1990 or one of the enhanced 1990 standards.  I sort of feel
bad that I've never had a chance to use a more modern Fortran.
Instead, mostly I've used C for that type of work.

                                          Sincerely,

  Agreed. FORTRAN was my first computer language: WATFOR, WATFIV and the -G
and -H compilers on IBM OS/360. Hollerith cards and 029 keypunch anyone?

  I've not looked because I'm not interested -- now -- in tweaking or
modifying SWAT code, but I believe there's a GNU fortran90 compiler called
'f90'.

Check out the "Verifying Correct Operation" section of
http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp/ntp_spool/html/debug.htm

You will want to use the ntpq command to diagnose the status of your
ntpd daemon.

I have checked up2date every day for a new rpm for this vulnerabiliy- but
it seems that so far Redhat has not addressed the issue.  What have you
RH'ers done to protect yourselves?  Right now am safeguarding in other
ways but I haven't tried to patch or otherwise, hoping that an rpm will
resolve the problem.  Any suggestions (besides changing distros, ;)

FYI, there's a GNU Fortran '90/95 compiler in the works:

http://g95.sourceforge.net/

Also, Digital's Fortran 90 compiler for Linux Alpha is free for
non-commericial use:

    I think that is www.fortran.com, not ".org", and yes it is a

This was released July 9, 2002.  Odds are that if you've been running
up2date like you say, it's already on your system.

Yeah, I understood that.  The primary reason for wanting to rewrite it
in C was to more easily support distributed computations in a
master/slave kind of architecture, which was going to require some
integrated networking code.  My intuition was that would make Fortran
too painful.

The problem factors nicely, essentially a bunch of independent random
walks, which made the distributed architecture particularly
attractive.  All the master needs to send the slave is the geometry (a
set of surfaces and a starting point), and all the slave needs to send
the master is the number of times the random walks terminated on each
surface.

I did 1 million random walks for each of 21 different starting points
on a 500 MHz P3 box using the MS Fortran compiled binary under WINE
and it took about, oh, 18 hours or so.  Just think how many more
random walks per hour I could do with 20 CPU's running at the same
time!

Back in middle-history, I learned Fortran while I was at Oregon State
University in the engineering program.  I took a course from a guy
named Dave Caufield (sp?) in the mid-1980's.  Interesting fellow.  Red
haired, bearded, hacker-type, with yellow tobacco stains on his
fingers.  He also pulled consulting duty in the basement of the Milne
Computer Center.  I occasionally wonder where he disappeared to.  I
once complained to him about how, on a different problem, I was being
compelled to hack Fortran instead of C (which, given the tools
available to me at the time, a Compaq 8088 and MS Fortran v2 or
something with no manual, was quite painful) because I was working
with a bunch of electrical power engineers.  He replied wryly, "When
one is in Italy, one speaks Italian!" ;-)

I wish Redhat had been a bit more clear in their announcement.  I know 
what is fixed in that version and i was not clear about it until looking

What's not clear about this:

A security audit of the OpenSSL code sponsored by
DARPA found several buffer overflows in OpenSSL which affect versions 0.9.7
and 0.9.6d and earlier:

1. The master key supplied by a client to an SSL version 2 server could be
oversized, causing a stack-based buffer overflow. This issue is remotely
exploitable. Services that have SSLv2 disabled would not be vulnerable to
this issue. (CAN-2002-0656)

2. The SSLv3 session ID supplied to a client from a malicious server could
be oversized and overrun a buffer. This issue looks to be remotely
exploitable. (CAN-2002-0656)

3. Various buffers used for storing ASCII representations of integers were
too small on 64 bit platforms. This issue may be exploitable. (CAN-2002-0655)

Y'all have to remember that the CERT advisory came out AFTER the
fixes from the vendors.

  Last evening I read the ntpq man page (or was it the ntpqc page?), didn't

  Don't let the version numbers fool you. RH back ported both bug fixes --
for the openssl exploit of last week and for one not yet exploited -- to

I went through this a week or so ago and while searching for public 
stratum 1 and 2 time servers I found this information about NTP at this 
site:

http://www.ultimeth.net/ntp/

They do offer, by permission, public access to their stratum 2 time 
server but they are pretty restrictive since it looks like they've had 
a lot of bozos with misconfigured NTP servers accessing their site at 
one time. 

I'm not using them since I want hassle free NTP server access but their 
website has alot of good information about configuring an NTP server 
and also how to verify its proper operation. I used their config file 
as the basis for mine and went through the NTP documentation to find 
some public NTP servers. I am also able to verify propery operation as 
well now.

I now synchronize all of my internal systems (Windows, Linux, and 
OpenBSD) against the time server on my gateway system.

Here's a copy of my /etc/ntp.conf, for what it's worth. As far as
I can tell, I'm keeping correct time. Of couse, the way I CHECKED
this was by calling the NIST phone line (303-499-7111) so I guess
it's no surprise that it agrees with the NIST severs :-)

Are you working on Navier-Stokes?  I know someone that is using that

Another option - I happen to know that the presenter actually lives in 
Corvallis. If there is sufficient demand in that area then perhaps 
something could be scheduled. Anyone from MWVLUG listening? Who would be a

No, it is an electric field and/or space potential calculation.
Solving analytically for complex geometry (like a transmission tower)
is a bitch.  Monte Carlo to the rescue (sort of).

Isn't it better to access a server by name rather than IP address? I 
know I saw more than a few servers that recommended using the name in 
case the IP address ever changed when I was going through the list of 
public stratum 1 and 2 time servers in the NTP documentation.

Yes, Fortran is no longer sufficient - but it does work well with C.
In my late Fortran years, I did the numerical stuff in Fortran and
write the graphical stuff in C.  I suppose this approach would also
work for distributed computations.  In many cases, I was reluctant to
rewrite the numerical stuff in C because it was very complex and worked
so well as it was.  It would have been an enormous waste of time to
convert it to C.

By the way the last Fortran package I worked on was converted to C
at some east coast university which will remain nameless.  I was
then asked to port the original Fortran code to new platforms.
Why, you ask?  Well, the rewritten code didn't get the algorithms
right, so it gave wrong answers.  However, it did have a nice
user interface.

I can't place Dave Caufield, but I bet I knew him a bit.
That was the era when Tom Yates, Dave Fuhrer, Mike Drost, and
JoAnn Baumman were at the OSU Computer Center.

Yes, I speak "Italian" as my native tongue, but had to learn
"English" to communicate in the new world (of the 1980s).

I think you could make an argument either way. Security-wise it
can be better to use an address, and I think that's why I
got in the habit of doing it that way in all my config files. But
I don't claim there's any reason to use the addresses instead of 
names in ntp.conf. I just happen to do it like that.

It's been a long time since I've tinkered with this kind of stuff, but
there is a book that may be of some help to you:

   Numerical Computation of Electric and Magnetic Fields
   by Charles W. Steele

My copy has a 1987 copyright, so better methods may have been developed
in the last 15 years, but there may be an updated version of the book, or
it may be that not much has changed.

Tony,

  Yes. Not only do they recommend this, but one in California (drydog.com?
mainecoon.com?) had a change in IP address recently.

  In my ntp.conf, the IP address is after a comment sign.

  BTW, thanks to all of you. I had a non-functioning ntp.conf. Don't know
exactly where, but I redid it based on one of the web sites recommended to
me, stopped and restarted ntpd and it is now working as designed.

There are a few things worth noting here.

1. If you do nothing else, subscribe to the redhat-watch mailing list. 
   Although it's sometimes a few days behind the release date of 
   updated RPMs, it's the official mass-distribution forum for Red 
   Hat's security/enhancement/bugfix notices.

   https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/redhat-watch-list

2. The changelogs for RPMs are available from the command line, e.g.,

   rpm -q --changelog openssl

   In the case of the openssl package, you're told that the patch to 
   fix the recently announced ASN.1 vulnerabilities was added on July 
   29, and the backport of Ben Laurie's patches for OpenSSL 0.9.6d 
   were added on July 25.

   Granted, the changelog-query facility is only as informational as 
   the changelogs themselves, but it's the best place to start.

3. The Linux Weekly News security page is a well reported 
   clearinghouse of security information. You can do worse than 
   checking it every Thursday.

98alpha10 seems to have multisession support. Upgrading or try using another
tool seem the only option.

Thank you

In my case, the Fortran was written by Electrical Engineers, who
weren't really programmers at all.  Let's just say I think this
particular code benefitted by being rewritten.  ;-)

The other thing that rewriting in C did was make it more flexible.
All the old Fortran had static limits on the size of arrays.  One of
the first things I did was take advantage of malloc() and friends to
make that all dynamically allocated.

I was careful to test the rewrite to yield exactly the same output as
the old Fortran program.  If I got the algorithms wrong, they were
wrong in exactly the same way as the original, except maybe I computed
them wrong faster.

  Most folks who wrote in fortran also did not put comments in the code.
Look at a lot of source available from the USGS and similar sites and there
will be thousands of lines of code -- all in uppercase, of course -- and not
a single comment to explain the variables or what is supposed to be done.

  When I was writing in fortran -- about 1972-1976 -- code was punched on
Hollerith cards. I had to develop the idea of punching a card with a 'C' in
column 1 to separate code; occasionally I'd actually write a comment. It was
just not standard practice. The only code organizational I was taught was to
use a felt-tip marking pen to make diagonal lines across the top edges of
the card deck. This made it easier to get the back in order when you dropped
them; especially with an ecosystem model I developed that consisted of two
boxes of cards.

  I like C and I like full-screen editors.

I've used it (Mandrake 9 beta 4) in limited capacity in 4 separate
vmware sessions, and on several 'real' servers for load balance
testing. It's never crashed, and the included clustering code seems
very solid. Can't say much about the fluff like the window managers
and applications, I haven't had a chance to use them. I'll probably
be upgrading my home desktop soon after 9 is released.

Unreal Tournament 2003 has gone gold.  Better yet, the Linux client and
server are in the box!  (On disc 3.)  

I have played Unreal Tournament and it is a very fun first person
shooter. I have not downloaded the demo of UT 2003 because the ftp sites
have been slashdotted.  I am sure this will be a cool game though.

Finally.  Something I can buy in a software store that is not blank

I have.  I've played the windows version some, and messed around with the
linux version as well.  Both are quite fun.  They are a bit faster paced
than Unreal Tournament.  The new 'bombing run' game is a lot of fun, and
reminicent of football.

The linux version ran nice and fast on my system (although I have never
gotten this systems sound working at all, so I cant comment there).  It will
probably take a beefier graphics card than non-gaming users probably have,
but it runs reasonably on my geforce2mx, wich you can get for around $60.
I'm in the process of severing my ties to windows, and being a gamer, that
can be hard to do.  Things like this really help.

Have you checked to see if it's one of those machines that 
keeps it's BIOS on the had drive? I hate that. Lost the 
partition? Sorry, won't boot without it. You may have to 
"restore" it first, then make it a dual OS machine.

Thank you very much for sharing your positive experience with 
a such piece of crap like Compaq! 
What would you suggest me to do with my existing one?
Unfortunately, it's too late to bring it back to the store.
I might can use it as a paper weight or as a crack storage?
You are welcome to share your ideas on this POS.

No, it's not the case.
BIOS is not writing anything on its HD.
It started to recognize its HD only after I set it manually in BIOS.
Finally I was able to install Linux on this laptop over NFS share, 
'cause for some reasons it doesn't recognize its own DVD ROM.
Now this Compaq hangs during kernel bootup. 
What's a piece of crap!

  I'm trying to upgrade/install RH 7.3 on both my notebook (currently
running RH 6.2) and my fiancee's laptop (currently limping with win95). From
the #1 cdrom, I made a pcmcia.img copy to a floppy, and that boots fine ...
until it asks for a diskette with the pcmcia driver. I don't have one on a
disk, and I found nothing on a google search except for a windoze driver and
some archived messages and pages from earlier RH releases.

  What do I copy from my workstation or the RH install cdroms to a floppy so
I can initiate a network install?

Thanks,

Rich

  By "folder" I presume you mean a directory and its subdirectories. There
are several compression utilities, but the only one that works cross-OS so
Microsoft users can decompress files is called "zip". 'man zip' will give
you directions.

has what you want.  You need to create a floppy with this driver on it.

The driver floppy is a like a kernel module load with a module.cgz file.  Took 
me a while to find out that .cgz is a cpio file gzipped.  But this file would 
contain the driver for you NIC.  I am surprized that the PCIMIA boot disk 
does not have the driver on it.

The CD-Rom works, I know that I installed new RAM and burned a new CD-ROM.

Got any idea's?

  I, too, was surprised that it wasn't there. This model pcmcia nic is one
of the most widely supported in linux. Oh, well.

To further the tales of horror, I had a Compaq laptop via work.  It 
could load RH 6.0, but not 6.1. It was never able to deal with vidio in 
a useful manner.  I had to give up a load NT again with the specialized 
drivers.

Nothing like the night I loaded 10 machines.  9 machines, no problems up 
and running in 1/2 hour.  The Compaq took me 5 hours of tweaking to 
finally work properly. ugh. It ran well after that though.

No matter who you use for NTP, a quick note to the sysadmin letting them 
know you're using it and that you appreciate the service is always a 
good thing.

All I did when I set up my ntp server was fire off a message to both 
sites I chose. Both admins responded within 24 hours, thanking me for 
asking and letting me know of last minute changes so I'd have a trouble 
free connection.

My experience is that WinZip bombs on some Unix file names (I think
ones with a ':' in them?) This may be a MS-Windows
limitation, but I'd prefer a utility that would keep going, perhaps
just ignoring that one file, rather than abort when it comes to a
file name that it can't handle.

If the directory name is "my_dir" I would suggest the following
commands:

  cd my_dir
  tar cvzf /tmp/my_dir.tgz .

This will leave a compressed version of the files in /tmp. If you
do it this way, the path names of the files in the directory will
be "relative" so that a sequence of commands like:

  mkdir foo
  cd foo
  tar xvzf /tmp/my_dir.tgz

Will restore all the files into the directory "foo"

Use the command "man tar" to get more information on the tar command.

I don't see why a crossover cable wouldn't work.  Obviously you just need to
make sure the NIC's are on the same subnnet.

Here's a good graphical representation of an ethernet crossover cable :

  As I wrote to Ken, there's nothing on the 3Com site for the model I have.
However, I do have the 3c574_cs.o modules on my workstation from the 2.4.18
kernel. I'll just copy that to a floppy and use it when the install program
asks for it.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0209221251130.14780-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I have not been able to figure out what I'm doing wrong, or not doing
right, but I cannot initiate the installation program on my Toshiba Portege
notebook so I can upgrade it from RH 6.2 to 7.3.

  The pcmcia.img was transferred to a floppy disk and that boots just fine,
until it asks for the floppy disk with the nic driver. The card is a 3Com
574TX. According to the files on the second floppy I made (from
pcmciadd.img), the 3c574_cs driver is part of pcmcia_core. I imagine that
the latter is supposed to be found in modules.cgz on that disk.

  When I put the second floppy disk in, and press [Enter], there's some disk
activity then everything hangs and the machine is completely locked up. The
floppy drive active light remains lit but I can do nothing on the notebook
other than press the power switch.

  The next time, I copied the 3c574_cs.o file from
/usr/src/2.4.18-3/kernel/drivers/net, or something like that, to the second
floppy disk. Then I tried the installation again. Same results as the first
time.

  This is such a common pcmcia nic that I don't expect this reaction. Does
anyone have suggestions for me to try, or insight into why the module is not
found and loaded?

  Once I get this working, I'll use the same nic on my fiancee's machine to
replace the current win95 with RH 7.3.

TIA,

Rich

  I know that only root can issue the 'shutdown' command, but what is the
accepted procedure when the installation is on a laptop and you don't want
to give the user root priviledges? I can think of only two scenarios:

  1) Make a different root password for that box and hope that accidents are
few and far between; or,

  2) Write a script, called perhaps 'done', that su's to root, uses expect
to supply the root password, then issues the 'shutdown -h now' command.

  The second is cleaner and safer, but I've never done any expect
programming and I don't know if it can be used to supply the root password
in a situation as I've described.

Thoughts?

Do you have "sudo" installed? You can grant specific users access to the 
shutdown command and you don't have to give them root access. The user 
would then run something like:

sudo shutdown -h now

You can probably setup Linux to perform a reboot with a 
"three-fingered-salute" as well. I things that can be setup in the 
/etc/inittab file. I know my SuSE system supports this because while 
attempting to go to a virtual console I presses CTL-ALT-DEL rathar than 
CTL-ALT-2...DOH!

  I will when I have replaced winderz with linux.

  Guess I better read the sudo man page; didn't think of it.

Assuming that you are using Xwinders on the laptop, gdm can be
configured to allow any user sitting in front of the login screen to
execute a shutdown.  I'm not sure about xdm or kdm.

Obviously, a man's judgement cannot be better than the information on 
which he has based it.  Give him the truth and he may still go wrong 
when he has the chance to be right, but give him no news or present 
him only with distorted and incomplete data, with ignorant, sloppy or 
biased reporting, with propaganda and deliberate falsehoods, and you 
destroy his whole reasoning processes, and make him something less 
than a man.

Rich,

Why not just create /etc/shutdown.allow with the names of the users
you want to allow to use shutdown?

>From the Fine man page:

       If shutdown  is  called with the -a argument (add this to the
       invocation of shutdown in /etc/inittab), it checks to  see
       if  the file /etc/shutdown.allow is present.  It then com?
       pares the login names in that file with the list of people
       that   are   logged   in   on   a  virtual  console ...

then alias shutdown to "shutdown -a" in the global bashrc file.

darn fine man page, if I do say so myself.

  Thanks, Sean. On the workstation her .bashrc calls startx; I'm not fond of
going directly to run level 5. But, I may consider thia on the laptop. Or
just give her a script that runs sudo to shutdown the system. That'll
probably be the best approach.

  Thank you, Mike. Other than -h and -r it never occurred to me that there
may be other options. I doubt that the dust was ever stirred on my copies of
'man shutdown'.

KDM has a menu option for this, at lease under SuSE. I don't know if 
it's standard in all installations of KDM or not since SuSE does a bit 
of customization of KDE. At I'm like a windows user now and use KDM to 
shutdown my system instead.

That certainly is an easier way to grant shutdown access. I always get a 
bit nervious of giving Joe or Jane average access to "shutdown" that is 
"too easy" to get at. I've always preferred to use "sudo" to grant 
shutdown access to non-root users since they have to have a 
command-line available and run "sudo shutdown...." explicity. It's a 
bit harder to get at than an aliased "shutdown" command IMHO. 

I guess if you're going to script the shutdown you could go either way. 
With it scripted you can force the user to answer "YES" before 
proceeding with running the "shutdown" command just in case they get 
there by mistake.

Besides the other fine options:
You could even have the three finger salute do a "shutdown -h" instead 
of the usual "shutdown -r" configured in /etc/inittab. (Though I usually 
replace it with "echo Stand away from the keyboard"

Subject: [PLUG] Info on format for /dev/dsp or /dev/audio
Message-ID: <3D8E7B14.3A8C55BB@computer-arts.net>

Can anyone tell me the exact format of a .wav file that can be
cat'ed to /dev/dsp or /dev/audio?  What I'm trying to do is to
create small sound sample that I can write out to the sound card
in a C program.

The .wav files I've created so far have this format:
 $ file short.wav 
 short.wav: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft PCM, 16 bit, stereo 44100 Hz

While these files can be played by xmms or whatever, they can't
be written directly to /dev/dsp or /dev/audio.

I'm obviously a little confused about this, so I might not be asking
exactly the right question. Any pointers to info on how to write
sound directly to these devices would be appreciated.

This has the distinct smell of a hardware problem. First I
suggest checking that all of your hard drive cables are
firmly connect, and that your memory and CPU are firmly
seated. Then run the memory test program found here:

Sorry.  The machine is still running.

Now I am responding you from the same machie but in another hard disc 
which is mounted on another mobile rack.

The KMail on this hard disc also having problem.  I have ceased using it 
for some times and turn to Mozilla Mail instead.  It will shutdown 
automatically.

I will have a thorough check on its memory later.  If checking can run 
direct from the website it will be more favrouable.

I abbreviated the above, because I want to be doubly sure it gets
into the search engine.

Wouldn't it make sense if we put that information, and similar
information about Debian and Mandrake (others too?) on our
website?  I mean I'm sure that there are similar mailing lists
for each of the distributions and ways of checking each package
format.

Not only could we be heading off a lot of similar email, but
then we'd have a single point of reference for information.

We could even invent a new acronym, RTFW.

The sound howto should help with some of your questions.
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Sound-HOWTO/

I believe /dev/audio expects mono 8 bit u-law data.  I think this is
the sound format used by the first Sun sound hardware.

Here's a quote from the sound howto:
Sun workstation (.au) sound files can be played by sending them to the 
/dev/audio device. Raw samples can be sent to /dev/dsp. This will generally 
give poor results though, and using a program such as play is preferable, as 
it will recognize most file types and set the sound card to the correct 
sampling rate, etc.

Another area for problems is the mixer.  If the levels are set too low,
the sound could be playing, but just too soft to be heard.

Wav files have a header, so even if you play them by cat'ing them to
/dev/dsp, you may get a burst of noise at the beginning.

As the howto says, you are best off using a program to play sound files.
I suggest beginning with the source code of the 'play' program, and
hacking as needed.

Subject: [PLUG] Fighting ORDB, solved....
Message-ID: <1032800979.7313.355.camel@kat.zotnet.com>

So basically I am an idiot.  In my networks I had a class C with a typo
192.XXX.XXX.0/2  not /24.

This would declare all networks 192.0.0.0 and higher to be in my local
networks (192 is binary 1100|0000).

so 212.X.X.X would work, but not 62.X.X.X.

So when people test from a lower network it failed.  ORDB is coming in
at different numbers, so when it hit from 212.242.88.3 it worked, but
when it hit from 62.79.90.71 it did not.

This is why it would pass some days, or for some tests and not others. 

A really big thanks to the folks who helped me, especially Wietse who
put in a lot of time for my screwup.  I apologize for wasting people's
time (especially since the private class C did not make the original
posting due to line wrap).

It might would be mighty nice if there was a debug mode where postfix
would post what rule accepted each mail (or I could find that option). 
Overload for a normal site, but the only way I found this was setting up
a similar site.  Reproducing the results, and then I went to a default
main.cf.

I checked each line in my original main.cf (grep -v '^#' main.cf | grep
-v '^$').  I searched for each variable set in the original main.cf, and
then added it when it did not match.  When it allowed the tests, it was
on mynetworks, I reduced the line down, and found it.

I haven't been receiving PLUG posts for the last day and a half. I have 
reached the archives and confirmed that messages have been posted.

I attempted to use the mailman interface to get my password mailed back 
to me. First thing I noticed was that the link at the bottom of the 
emails points to:

http://lists.pdxlinux.org/mailman/listinfo/plu

It should point to:

http://lists.pdxlinux.org/mailman/listinfo/plug

I think the omitted last character is a mailman bug. Can anyone confirm 
this?

Also, when I did go to the page and tried to get my password emailed to 
me, I received a confirmation that the password had been emailed, but I 
never actually received the password. So now, I have no way to even see 
if my "No Mail" option has been turned on (perhaps because of a message 
bounce or something).

When this message gets posted, I'll check to see if I can post or not.

It seems to be working...  Since you're using spamcop, have you checked 
to see if perhaps the plug mail is getting circular-filed?

Also - in case you didn't see it, spamcop was DOWN for all of Sunday due 
to a server move.  I'm trying to check their webserver from here, and it 
doesn't seem to be resolving.  Perhaps they are still having some 
residual move problems/DNS issues.  Nope, it resolved, just took a while.

Perhaps a mailman configuration bug, but not a bug in mailman itself.

Thanks Galen, sounds like good advice. "play" on my system is just

Message-ID: <3D8F674A.34C6DF58@computer-arts.net>

When I want to grep through (for example) all the .c files in
a hierarchy I've been using find, for example:

  find . -name \*.c -exec fgrep -H "find.this.string" {} \;

It SEEMS like I ought to be able to accomplish the same thing using
grep recursively, something like: 

  grep -r "find.this.string" *.c

but I can't figure out any way to cause the "*.c" to be evaluated
at the right time in order to actually run the grep on all the C
files in the hierarchy.

Am I missing something, or is recursive grep only good for searching
through ALL files in a hierarchy?

Sorry, wrong name.  wavplay is what you want.  It's somewhat obscure.
rpmfind.net shows a few entries for it.  When I was hacking sound
code I was using Release 0.21, November, 1993.  I'm sure it has
changed a bit since then.

I think that memory test is sufficient.

If you've not done so already, you should power down the box, open it 
up, and check that all of your hard drive cables are firmly connected.

If you get the box up and running again, keep any eye on the log file
(tail -f /var/log/messages). Also, if you observe any strange behavior
then run the dmesg utility and make note of any unusual messages.

No, because -r == -d recurse, so grep reads all files under each 
directory that matches the '*.c' expansion.

find's -exec option is expensive, however, so you can do a hacky sort 
of combination to speed things up a bit:

  grep 'find.this.string' $(find . -name \*.c)

Is this better in some way than: 

  find . -name \*.c xargs grep 'find.this.string'

Modern versions of grep support the "-r" flag for recursion.  (At least 
the ones shipped in Redhat and Mandrake do.)

Ooh, neat. The --include option is something new in GNU grep 2.5.x
that wasn't there in 2.4.x (along with the corresponding --exclude
option). Thanks!

$ rpm -q -f /bin/grep

Okay, so that's why it didn't work for me. Time to upgrade I guess.
Anyway, thanks to both of you for the tips.

You're not the only one. I've seen maybe six emails to this list since

Maybe not. Agora uses Spamassassin, but it's setup only to make a change
to the subject line *if* a user has configured procmail to pipe it thru

Okay, thanks. Yes, I am reading both the howtos also. Probably a
working code example will be more useful for what I'm trying to do.
I found the wavplay source, and it does look simpler than sox.

I'm going to pick a nit here...

tar doesn't actually compress anything, it's just an archiver (Tape Archiver).  One still has to run the resulting file through a compressor.

The z flag as listed above just automagically filters the archive through gzip/compress (depending on the case of the letter z).  Check the man page for confirmation.  The GNU version of tar I have (1.13) supports z, Z, and y (gzip, compress, and bzip2), just remember that not all versions of tar have support for these flags.

For example, the tar that Sun includes by default in the Solaris 8 environment doesn't.  Guess which program I replaced with the GNU version real quickly?

Hi Terry,

Further to my late email to you, sorry I made a mistake.  Hereinafter is 
my solution:

********************
It is rather amaizing to me.  Now the machine with the hard disc in
problem works proper again.

What I have done was download "memtest86 v3.0" from Internet and tested
the machine thoroughly 4 times.  But no error was found.  Exited
"memtest86" and retarted the machine. It booted straight through without
problem.

This machine has 2 hard discs mounted on 2 mobile-racks respectively,
each having its own OS-RH7.3.  Previously when the machine was in
problem I pluged in and moved out the hard disc in problem several times
to ensure the rack being sit firmly in its house and properly contacted,
kernel panic still existed.  BIOS detected the hard disc without error.
********************

I don't understand this incident.

Thanks

Stephen

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0209231850370.25117-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I've given up trying to get WP/8 ever running again. Even the single-user
cdrom seg faults trying to install. So, I'm trying to get WP/8 (aka, Corel
WP Office 2k) installed and running.

  This version runs over wine and needs, apparently, the glibc-2.1
libraries. But, I cannot just install that in parallel with glibc-2.2; too
many conflicts.

  I'm wondering if I might try installing just the WP rpms and see it it
will run with the current version of wine I have installed (from the 10th of
this month). Any ideas or suggestions?

Thanks,

Rich

There are about three different RPMs that you need to get it working.  I 
have them (I hope), but that system is down for repairs.

You have to upgrade the corel version of Wine, libarts and one other 
thing.  I will post the info as soon as I can dig out from the latest 
hardware failure.

Um, I suppose.  You could always just do that the easy (one utility) way:

IIRC WP8 needs to have the old libc5 installed for it to work. I still 
have a working copy WP8 installed on my SuSE 8.0 with a 2.4.18 kernel. 
I did have to install the old libc stuff for it though.

  I assume that "upgrading the corel version of wine" means using a more
current version regardless of Corel's participation. Is that correct? I've
all the rpms in a directory on a filesystem. I'll send you the list when
you're ready and you can tell me which are keepers and which to release.
When you're up and running, of course.

  I've been using 'rgrep -r ...' under RH 6.2 with the 2.2 kernels. Is this
something different?

WP8 has other problems. You need a hack (which is on Freshmeat.net) to 
make one of the filter sets work correctly.  (Print or file conversion. I 
don't remember which. One had a date/y2k issue that caused it to stop 
working. This is a hack around that problem.)

Tony,

  I have all the old libc-5 stuff back in place. When I ran ldd I learned
that all the libraries WP/8 said it needed were where WP would look for
them. But, when I tried to fire it up it seg faulted.

  Shannon graciously allowed me to download the single-user verion of WP/8
('cause of all the cdroms I've kept over the years, the original WP server
edition is not to be found). When I try to istall that from the cd-r I
burned, it seg faults all the way through the install script.

  I'm not clever enough to know why it's behaving this way and to fix it.

Thanks,

Rich

This is the grep that comes with Redhat 7.3.  It has worked for a while 
now.  Recursive grep is very useful.  (Especially in /etc.)

There is a version that has been created from the cvs tree before Corel 
discontinued support on its wine tree. The libarts rpm is actually from 
the CorelDraw for Linux patches. I think there might be one more, but I 
can't tell until I get the info of that other system. (Which has a nasty 
drive problem i am working on right now...)

Hmmm... I beginning to wonder if there is something wrong with either
my soundcard configuration, or ???

If I take a .wav file, such as /usr/lib/mozilla/res/samples/test.wav
and play it with either xmms or realplay (RealPlayer) it works fine.
But any "command line" utility I try, such as sox or whatever...
It only works the first time. If I try to reapeat the command, then
I just get noise. It's as if an application such as xmms had to
"set things up" before play (sox) can work.

I wonder if someone could try this sequence and see if it works
for them:

xmms /usr/lib/mozilla/res/samples/test.wav
play /usr/lib/mozilla/res/samples/test.wav
play /usr/lib/mozilla/res/samples/test.wav
play /usr/lib/mozilla/res/samples/test.wav

If more than the first "play" works, then perhaps I've got some kind
of configuration problem.

I believe PLUG is also the "Pune Gnu/Linux User Group" (RMS must

Rich,

It takes a little more than just copying the module to a floppy to make a 
driver disk.  Here's a link to Redhat and look for building a driver disk on 
the left menu.

Hello folks,

I'm running RH 7.3 and I was wondering how can I
change the language to the command line. When I'm
running a command I get error messages in french. Is
there anyway to change that to english?
I think I selected french during the RH installation
and now I cannot get rid of it. Help please!!!

Subject: [PLUG] Address list causes problems
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0209240545230.27732-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  This message was posted to the mailhelp list, too, and I'm looking for a
quick resolution of the problem.

  I'm running postfix-1.1.11 on RH 7.3 (2.4.19 kernel). Since the upgrade at
the beginning of this month, mail sent to me as part of a list of addressees
is bounced by my header_checks. At least, I assume so because the reason
given for the rejection is "subject" and that's only in header_checks. This
happens from four or five distinct originators. None of the messages has a
word found in header_checks. Messages from these individuals to me alone
always makes it through.

  When I send mail to multiple addressees, including one address that is
alphabetically at the head of every list, that address is rejected going
out. Again, an individual message causes no problems.

  Has anyone any ideas what might be causing this? Better yet, suggestions
to fix the problem for good would be greatly appreciated.

TIA,

Rich

The LANG environment variable is what's gotten munged. My hunch is 
that if you do 'echo $LANG' from a command prompt, you'll see 'fr' or 
something close to that.

To fix your current shell session, do one of the following

  export LANG=''
  export LANG='C'
  export LANG='en_US'

The first two are essentially the same: your system will feel like an
old time *nix box. The last one is a bit different. Your error
messages will be in good ol' American English, but utilities that
alphabetically sort things (ls, sort, ...) will do so in a way that
doesn't feel, er, Unixy. E.g.,

  [heinlein at pecos tmp]$ LANG=C ls -A1 # the good old way
  .asillyfile
  ABB.txt
  INBOX
  Z.pl
  aaa.txt
  z.c

  [heinlein at pecos tmp]$ LANG=en_US ls -A1 # new-fangled i18n way
  aaa.txt
  ABB.txt
  .asillyfile
  INBOX
  z.c
  Z.pl

Longer term, you'll want to edit the LANG definition in
/etc/sysconfig/i18n and/or your ~/.bash_profile and ~/.bashrc files.

Please let us know if you need further help in this vein.

Try googling for 'plug linux':

  Perth Linux Users' Group :: PLUG
  The Philippine Linux Users' Group
  Polska Grupa Uz.ytkowniko'w Linuxa
  PLUG -- The Purdue Linux Users Group
  PLUG es el Grupo de Usuarios de Linux en Peru

And then, finally, come Phoenix and Portland.

Yeah. Using GNU grep 2.4.x and older, you couldn't (easily) tell grep,
"search for string 'foo' in all *.h files in the entire /usr/include
directory tree." The intuitive command,

  cd /usr/include
  grep -r foo *.h

wouldn't do what you really wanted[1]. Now, however, grep 2.5.x can do
it:

  cd /usr/include
  grep -r --include="*.h" foo *

--Paul Heinlein <heinlein at attbi.com>

[1] Because the shell, not grep, would handle the wildcard expansion. 
    So grep never even had a chance to guess at what you really wanted 
    to do.

Nothing is being reported at spamcop. I actually had tried to check that 
before I sent the message, and was unable to view any results. I now 
seem to be able to see other spams being reported, but nothing from PLUG 
(aside from one posted by Zot that was from before these problems started).

Are there other spamcop users that are getting mail? Also, raise your 
hands if you aren't getting these messages. :-)

I am able to get to my  configuration page for mailman (but without my 
password I can't do anything.

I can see that my "Disable mail delivery" is turned off, so that's not 
the problem either. I wanted to turn in on and then back off to see if 
that would have any impact.

I have attempted to retrieve my password (again) to no avail.

I can post (obviously).

I just commented out "FEATURE(`accept_unresolvable_domains')" in my

to see this problem.

I just set NNTPSERVER appropriately and use slrn over my DSL connection - no

I'm not on the list, so could you CC

Does anyone know of a util or something to create a
large file without all the overhead of "dd
if=/dev/zero of=..." It's for a loopback device, is
there some way to make it auto-extend or something
like that? 

Thanks!

Subject: [PLUG] Now THIS is funny.
Message-ID: <3D909883.4000603@sun.com>

This morning I'm going through the admin interface to the PLUG list, 
trying to see if I can't get a handle on Richard Seymour's email 
problems.  I check the blocked mail interface to see if anything 
interesting is in there, and reject a bunch of spam, let a couple of 
non-subscribed mails through, and find something from someone 
threatening legal action against PLUG.  Eh?

So I check out the link that this guy supposedly says exists, and I 
can't find *anything* on the plug website pointing back to his site.  So 
I do a google search on 'pdxlinux teambooks' - teambooks being where 
this guy says he's from.  I get ONE hit on the plug archive: 
http://lists.pdxlinux.org/pipermail/plug/2002-July/006501.html

In short - a message from Sandy Herring outlining how he was spammed by 
these guys 48 times.  And now they have the gall to think that they can 
claim legal action against a non-profit for whatever they think WE did 
wrong (by archiving a public email?).  Anyway, I'll leave the legal 
mumbo-jumbo to the 'real' admins, but I thought this would be worth a 
chuckle.

We aren't even a nonprofit. He/they would have to go after the

Uh, PLUG is *NOT* a non-profit. It is not incorporated, & simply
refers to a group of people who meet a few times each month to discuss
Linux & drink beer. IANAL, but it seems to me that PLUG can't be sued
because there is no one to file charges against!

(I'm not sure this worthy correspondent[1] could prove someone like
Dave Mandel, Paul Nelson, Dan Haskell, or myself -- who are mentioned
on the website -- are responsible for what PLUG says or does: were
just volunteers like Richard or our new friend posting from Phoenix,
with no special powers. He might be able to sue Sandy for slander, but
I'm not sure that sending an email is considered adequate legal notice
even for that. And I doubt he's serious enough to pay a lawyer to
litigate a case with little to no prior case law to find out who he can
sue.)

On the other hand, this is one reason why PLUG just might want to
bite the bullet & incorporate. Incorporatino would provide something
of a shield from this kind of crap. As things stand now, if this worthy
correspondent did sue someone assoicated with PLUG, & get a friendly
judge, he could make someone's life a mess with all of the litigation &
court procedings. :-(

[1] Originally I had a different term for this individual, but
after some thought I concluded that if he were truly sue-happy, why
encourage him to sue *me* for defamation?

Incorporation will just give them a target.  

Besides...  The guy is a moron.  He cannot even word a proper coherent 
threat.  I wonder just what he is afraid of? An advertisement?  For his 
business?  It does not make a whole lot of sense.

I got this thing too and came looking to see if anyone else did too...
We should probably speak to David about what to do about this; I suspect 
we're fairly safe, but haven't any idea.  Perhaps we need a disclaimer 
stating that "each message are copyright of its sender"--I think that's why 
/. has that post about comments.

There are a couple:

 soft_bounce = yes

Sends temporary failure codes (4XX) instead of permanent (5XX), among other 
things.

And 'warn_if_reject', added every any restriction you want to test, will:

#   warn_if_reject: next restriction logs a warning instead of rejecting.

See the 'sample-smptd.cf' file.  It's a nice way to test various changes 
before actually enforcing them, which I regret to say I don't use often 
enough...

Rah rah...

Plainly evidenced by the spelling errors and bad english on his
web-site.

Left turn, 

Has anyone had any luck with OS X and SMB support?  I ask only because
of the BSD foundation...I've been trying to get it work on a small LAN,
no luck

Go to The Perl Journal web site, and read Tom Christiansen's Perl
Quiz.   Also, read all the questions from Jon Orwant's Internet Quiz
from the Perl conferences.  That should do you pretty well.

  I think they should server the server. After all, the archiving is done
automatically. I can see The Oregonian's headline now: "Server Served in
Suit by Suits". And, of course, they'll run the article twice on the same
page.

Hi Signe,

I'm not a storage specialist, but I can get DTL drives and media and install 
if necessary.

I've had no trouble. Just open the service finder thingee (Cmd K? my 
memory fails me) and do

  smb://host.name/sharename

Typically, you'll be prompted for a username, which should be entered 
in the standard smb format:

  domain\username

The problem for us hasn't been the connections but the bloomin' 
faux-stream files that Macs insist on littering around the filesystem.

Who, me?

I don't even have root on the darned server. And I'm unemployed

The words ``blood" & ``stone" come to mind. And love letters from

That is a big help.  Thanks.

However, I was hoping to get some "in-person" practice.  Something that
I can tell how I look during an interview.

Actually, dd will do what you want, I use it all the time for creating
drives for virtual computers like this:

   dd if=/dev/zero of=virtual_filesystem_name bs=1M count=0 seek=20

This would create a 20 Megabyte file (bs x seek == 1M x 20).  There are
some things to be aware of however, which depending on what you are doing
can be good or bad:

  1 - This creates what is known as a "sparse" file, which does not
      actually allocate storage for any significant block of data
      which is all zeros.  What this means is that while an ls -l will
      show the file size as: 20971520 bytes, the du command will show
      the file size as zero.

  2 - File creation time is essentially zero

  3 - Saves disk storage since space in the file is not actually allocated
      until it is used to store non-zero data.

  4 - The size of the sparse file can exceed the free storage on your hard
      drive, which can have strange and unexpected results if your
      application writes sufficient data into the sparse file to exceed
      the free space on the hard drive.

  5 - Many common applications such as "cp" and "rsync" require special
      options in order to preserve the "sparse" nature of the file when
      copying it to other locations, and other applications don't even
      understand the concept.

  6 - The biggest plus is that you can create large file systems with lots
      of reserve capacity but not have to waste all the space that goes
      with them, though over time, fragmentation can eat alot of space,
      but it can be recovered by using tools to push all the file system
      data to one end of the virtual drive (such as repartitioning tools
      do), zeroing the remaining unused portion of the partition, and
      using cp with the appropriate sparse option (there may be an easier
      way, I just haven't had much need for this).

This sounds like something that User Mode Linux was designed for.  It
took all weekend, but I can now boot a full blown linux install from my
user space (with just a little help from root to initiate the tuntap
virtual device, and mount the file system) in linux.  I'm trying to get
VMWare Express to run, but the last kernel that Express will install
under is 2.4.6, so I'm trying to get a uml-2.4.6 kernel going (I don't
want my whole system to run the 2.4.6 kernel).  The concept is very
powerful, but getting it to work took some effort.

Anyway, I can see this as a reasonable solution to glibc conflicts.

Let me know if you need some of the gory details, I might be able to

Not necessarily. Just install into another directory and set PATH,

  Huh? If you're using rpms, get the latest and greatest then, as root, type
'rpm -Fvh <new_package_name>' [Enter]. This will "freshen" the existing

I just though I would make some comments about this
whole thing. I personally have done a little studying
of US Copyright law (the person did indeed mention
copyright law), and there is a chance that there is a
violation of the law.

I don't remember the exact section (I only whoop the
legalese when I want to impress people, or talk to
lawyers), but any literary work (including e-mail
[including spam]), is copyrighted upon its completion.

However, fair use allows the use of a copyrighted work
in review, Sandy (and Richard) may be descrbed as
posting a review. If anyone who may be harmed by this
litigation needs some support, I can review the code
with them, but I'm no lawyer, and I am no substitute
for one.

This has given me an idea, All of the laws are
recorded, this is so that anyone can read them, and
know what they are. I say we back up our comrads and
do a little RTFMing with the law. About 20 hackers
researching the law can amount to at least half a
lawyer.

Also, there might be some dificulty proving damages.
After all, how much profit could they have lost in a
message archived and long forgotten?

Well this is my 2 bits.

Seems to me that first they would have to prove that the statements where
untrue. Which would give you the opportunity to subpoena their server logs
to see just how many times they spammed you. Not to mention that fact that
the defendants in the lawsuit could defend themselves pro-se (for free) and
the plaintiffs would have to spend thousands of dollars on attorney's : ) !!

That doesn't even look like a real cease and desist notice.  Where is the

It does unless you set the option to used the 'recieved' date, which I

I'm not sure whether RH supports USB 2, ATA 133, AGP 4x.

Message-ID: <000c01c2643d$f8380a00$1600a8c0@vncvr1.wa.home.com>

I am running an HP Omnibook2100 laptop with debian3.0.  I am trying to draw lines on my screen.  I can get vgadrawline() to work no problem.  But I need to draw a lot of lines and the man pages indicate that gl_line is much quicker.  However, anytime I execute a gl_xxx command that writes to the screen (gl_setpixel, gl_line, etc).  I get this :

svgalib: Signal 11: Segmentation fault received.

The line right before my gl_line statement is

vga_setpage(0);

I don't really understand what this does, I haven't found very good documentation for it.  I'm just of the impression that it's needed for gl_line.  Commenting it out doesn't fix the problem, however...

I would paste my C code but I only have mail set up on my Windows machine.  If you need the code I can type it in but it's pretty basic.  This happens both in 320x200x256 and 640x480x256.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

Have you looked at the man page (man gl_line) ?  It looks like you might
also need a call to gl_setcontextvga.

galen


from the gl_line man page:

DESCRIPTION
       Draw a line from point (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) inclusively in
       color c.

       You should not assume that the same drawing trajectory  is
       used when you exchange start and end points.

       To  use this program one first sets up a mode with a regu?
       lar vga_setmode call and vga_setpage(0), with  possibly  a
       vga_setlinearaddressing  call.   Then a call to gl_setcon?
       textvga(mode) is made.  This makes the  information  about
       the mode available to gl_line.

       The  pixels  are  placed  directly into video memory using
       inline coded commands.

Anyone here using MacOS X as a NFS server to Linux clients?

I have one school who has a MacOS X file server and they are trying to 
mount the home directories off it to Linux clients. The NFS mount works
fine, but KDE & GNOME refuse to run - spewing out NFS file locking errors.

Postfix directory inside the home directory found to be having mails which I
think were bounced mails.  Can I download these mails to my MS outlook
program?  I believe that before I can download this mail to my outlook, it
will prompt me for a password and username.  Can I treat this postfix
directory as owned by an  ordinary user and change its password because I
don't have any idea regarding its password.

Hope someone could help me

Thanks and good day

That's the thing, it's just some email saying that we need to remove 
something from our database.  No link, no nothing.  *I* had to go 
searching for it, and only after thinking "Hey, maybe the mail 
archives?" did I find what *could* have been what he was referring to.

Either way, unless something 'official' comes down the line - which I 
doubt ever will - I'm just going to ignore it, AND them.  Heh, does PLUG 
have a mailing address to accept certified letters?  ;)

Is nfslockd running on the OS X box?

There used to be some weird incompatibility between BSD and Linux for NFS.  
It has been years since I had to deal with it.

If needs be, I have access to a OS X box and can check into it.

No nfslockd that I could find.  nfsd & nfsoid (IIRC) where the only two
that I found and both where running.

When [MacOS X|Darwin] & nfs searchs on google turned up nothing of interest,
I did a query on BSD. One of the first links I hit mentioned that MacOS X
uses the Mach kernel, not the BSD kernel...

The daemons should be the same.

I will check into it.

  Huh? If you're using rpms, get the latest and greatest then, as root, type
'rpm -Fvh <new_package_name>' [Enter]. This will "freshen" the existing
version with the newest one.

As I remember, one difference is that MacOSX by default uses a non-privileged
port for nfs, and by default Linux only wants a privileged port (or something
like that).  There's an option you can set (in /etc/exports?) that allows
non-privileged ports.

The Linux box is the client, not the server.  /etc/exports is only used by 
the server.

I don't know if all BSD systems are equal or not but I been using NFS 
between  OpenBSD and Linux without any problems for several weeks now. 
I have "mountd", "rpc.lockd", and several "nfsd" processes running. It 
works great and I've been reading/writing 100s of megs worth of data 
without any problems or errors.

Only problem is Sun isn't offering linux as an available option for its
higher end servers, and there are many others in the linux
workstation/desktop space.  I think Sun is in trouble, and Sun ONE seems
like every other web services strategy.  I don't know how java fits in
with all this, but java isn't a major revenue source.

Message-ID: <2156.216.99.218.67.1032933990.squirrel@sautez.dhs.org>

I'm now beginning to do more virtual hosting and would like to know how to
do the following:

1.  I have an account with one user and all the mail goes there for the
virtual host.

2.  This user would like to have another name be able to pop off some email.

3.  another email would be forwarded to another account.

Is is possible to do this with procmail so that I may allow the one user
to alter the recipe when he chooses?

Do I have to put all the aliases in the virtual_users table of postfix? 
And if so do they have to be in order?  Such that the first one goes
correctly and the rest go to user 1?

a little picture:


domain -  user1  gets all the email that is not to the below two users
          user2  gets email forwarded to another account and domain
          user3  wants to pop off his email from domain.


ok, not really a picture but you get the idea.

I would like to allow user1 to alter the settings anytime they choose w/o
me having to make changes to postfix.  Possible?

Thanks,

Josh

A while back I asked for some help to get my python scripts to run on
Apache as CGI.  Well, after banging my head againts the screen and on the
monitor my head started to hurt.

Then, I finally got a script to run but others would not.  Well the secret
was revealled.

I had transferred the python scripts from windows.  When I edited in VIM
they looked great and all.  Little did I know that VIM was trying to be
smarter then me.  It removed all the ^M's and I thought the file was fine.
 This is where my last headache comes from.  VIM being a little too
cleaver for me.  I later found out that when I first open the file VIM
will tell me about what it is and saves it back out as that unless I
change the format.

Was a long time to learn and very annoying.  I see the advantages but use
to VI where DOS files are easy to spot. I hope this helps someone else
save that unicorn stylish look. ;-)

Thanks all for the suggestions.

Just catching up on PLUG... and I see I've caused a tempest in a teapot!
IANAL (as is true of the others who followed up in this thread), but I'm
hard-pressed to see how stating the facts about their SPAM onslaught is
actionable. Perhaps I should have said "alleged" ;-)

It's interesting to note that the company in question is based in Canada,
and that the domain for the listed contact does not exist. I think they're
blowing smoke. I vote to ignore them.

Another aid to help people from getting bit by this problem.
When VIM loads a file with MS type line endings the status line reports:

"filename" [dos]  xxxL, xxxxC

the [dos] being the alert that you have CRLF line endings.

Anytime you work in a mixed environment and a script mysteriously won't
run while everything else seems right the `file` command will also report
on whether the script is ASCII text, ASCII text with CRLF endings or 
whatever.

Teleport ran virtual domains like this for quite -- though with 
sendmail, not postfix.

The basic chain of events is

1. All mail addressed to the @virtual.net domain gets delivered to one 
   local user (say, josh).

2. Josh sets up ~/.procmailrc to catch the virtual users:

   # see the procmailex(5) and procmailrc(5) man pages
   #
   DEFAULT=/var/spool/mail/josh

   # billg gets mail to sales or himself
   :0
   * ^TO_(sales|billg)@virtual\.net
   ! billg

   # mcnealy gets mail to bluster or himself
   :0
   * ^TO_(bluster|mcnealy)@virtual\.net
   ! mcnealy

   # all other virtual.net mail goes to my inbox
   :0 :
   * ^TOvirtual\.net
   $DEFAULT

3. Users billg and mcnealy could then have their own procmail recipes 
   to further massage delivery routes.

I began a wget last night via a ssh connection. Then I disconnected.
This morning it's still going. How can I view the output of that command
again?
I'm sure it's a simple command...I just do not know it. Thanks.

Take this off the record, since I'm obviously biased.  ;)

Sun still sees Solaris as the OS for the higher-end systems.  Why, you 
might ask?  Well first of all, Linux STILL doesn't scale well past 2-4 
processors.  At least, that's what I'm still hearing.  This may change 
with the 2.5->2.6 kernel series, or perhaps HURD when it matures, but 
until then, Sun still has a viable product to stick on those systems, 
and isn't going to ship customers something that 'may or may not work'.

To date, I've seen ONE port of Linux to the E10k (64 250-464mhz U3 
procs), and that was only with a 24(?) proc machine.  I don't think 
there was any *real* data on that, just that the guy HAD ported it and 
got it to function.  So far, nothing on the E15k (72-106 900mhz U3 procs).

I'm not sure what the corporate strategy for Sun ONE is, honestly.  I 
suppose I could look it up, but I wouldn't be able to share, regardless. 
  My initial thought however, knowing Suns animosity towards Microsoft, 
is that it is simply an alternative to Microsoft .NET.  If you don't 
want to buy into Microsoft, here's another option.

I think people look at the stock price (hovering at $3/share) for SUNW 
and think, "Oh, they're going down,"  Personally, I don't even look at 
the stock price.  People are buying Sun products MORE than they're 
buying HP, IBM or SGI.  The difference is that HP and IBM have a HUGE 
business to fall back on if the server market dries up.  SGI has the 
motion picture industry.  Sun...makes servers.  The whole Sun 
ONE/Java/etc is partially an attempt to diversify, IMHO.

But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.  :)

A number of vendors and companies are now finding that on more business
related workloads, Linux actually scales reasonably well (not "industry
best") to 8 processors on IA32, and possibly a bit better on systems
like PPC64.  Take the big distros such as Red Hat or UL - their high
end does pretty well up to 6-8 procs with web servers, databases, java
apps, etc.

> This may change with the 2.5->2.6 kernel series...

There is some growing evidence that the 2.5/2.6 kernels will scale
reasonably well to 16 processors with IA32, probably to 24+ processors
with PPC64, other architectures may vary.  Current 2.5 kernels have
a *lot* of scalability related work going in, expect that in the hands
of the distros sometime late next year or early the following, although
for some machines/workloads, a 2.5 kernel is already approaching
"reasonable" stability for development on high end machines.

On Solaris, 5.0.5 can, so I'd guess that 5.0.6 can, too.

I don't know about acroread, but why can't you use gv or ggv for viewing
this PDF? (sure, I know it translates them into postscript before
viewing, but both of them support arbitrary pi/2 rad rotations on
documents.)

Galen,

  Can't you turn the monitor on its side on your desk?

  Oh, by the way, you can rotate the document in acroread either clockwise
or anti-clockwise. Saves scratching the desktop turning the monitor all the
time.

5.05 can on Linux, too. If you'd like to build acroread as an RPM, 
I've got a spec file that works with 5.05 (so presumably will with 
5.06):

  ... that is also applicable to those of you who work for someone else,
too.

  There is a huge chasm between marketing products and marketing services.
Most marketing books (and courses, I imagine) forcus on the former. What us
service sellers have to offer is intangible. The VERY best marketing book
for us is Harry Beckwith's "Selling the Invisible". I strongly recommend
that you run, not walk, to your local library or bookstore and get a copy.
It reads quickly and deserves re-reading periodically. My copy cost only $15
several years ago and it's worth much more.

  AbiWord-1.0.3 appears to have neither capability. Does anyone know

This does require that I create a local user on the box for billg correct?
 I was hoping to not have a local user on the box for that email.  I
suppose since I chroot'd postfix I can just add the user to that local
user file.  Is that correct also?  I'm guessing that is how I add postfix
users and not unix users.  That will ultimately be the end solution.  but
then those users do not have a unix account and such do not have .procmail
files and no recipes to have.  At least that is what I'm thinking.

It was the diff then file commands that gave me the clue that there was a

bothered to read the bottom messages. ;-)

  You should see what I've written on this! :-) It's not a pretty sight.
What is also unfathomable is their bug tracking system, called 'issuezilla'.
They could have called it IssueGate, too, for all the name matters. I'm
regustered there; can log in. But, when I try to create a new issue it tells
me I need to log in first. Infinite loop, and I'm not the only one.

  I recommended to the developers that they drop their overly-complex scheme
of data sources and let us users create a word docment with the merge data,
just like WordPerfect did. Easier coding, reliable, flexible, ... works.

  We'll see what happens.

  So much of what I do with processed words is finalized as a merged
document that I must have this ability.

No. You can designate that the mail gets delivered off-site:

You could set them to bounce out, and everything that doesn't bounce out
goes to your local user:

In your virtuals file:

otheruser at virtual.com     otheruser at otherdomain.com
@virtual.com              localuser

This doesn't give the control to the localuser, though.

Can procmail bounce mail outbound?

Here's what I did/do:

* Forget buying a copy of _Maximum RPM_. Just read it online:

    http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/

* Use GNU Midnight Commander (mc) and start poking through the SRPMS 
  directory in a Red Hat distribution tree. mc will do all the cpio 
  magic behind the scenes so you can explore source packages quickly 
  and easily.

  Most especially, look at the Red Hat .spec files within the source 
  packages. They're the best documentation you'll find.

* Grok a copy of cpan2rpm; you'll learn some cool things about 
  packaging CPAN modules. (Or you can just use cpan2rpm and not worry 
  about the details. :-)

* If you end up doing a lot of RPM work, join the rpm-list:

    https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list

  In particular, Jeff Johnson, the lead RPM developer at Red Hat, is 
  very helpful -- and usually very quick to answer questions.

I have heard that Tyan is the brand of choice for many people who build
servers or other systems where reliability is a primary criteria.  For my
latest system (about six months old) I went with the Tyan Tiger MP S2460,
though I'm currently running it with dual Durons rather than Athlons as a
cost saving measure.  I have had no problems with it.

Correct.  I understand that, but if I need two users to pop off email then
I need to have two mail accounts correct?  I'm hoping I can have one unix
account and two mail accounts.  Possible?  Then have him use procmail to
forward the email to offsite accounts that he chooses.  That would be
best.  He could even forward email to the virtual domain of the other user
with procmail.  As I understand.

How can I set up a dns zone to direct everything for a domain name to a
hostname?

Like a
* IN CNAME hostname.com. ?

so www.hostname.com. would go to hostname.com.
and gpwrojgpwjg.hostname.com. would go to hostname.com.

MPX motherboards are much better than MP motherboards, at least if you run
them with Athlon-MPs (I don't know if they even can be used with Durons).
Tyan Tiger has an MPX version. Early releases had USB problems so on-board
USB was removed and they shipped with a PCI USB card (which was much more
reliable than any on-board USB I've seen, and gave 4 ports instead of 2).
Current version of Tiger MPX ships with on-board USB.

Another good board is IWill MPX2, it's slightly more expensive. You can
overclock this one. It has onboard USB, but does not have onboard NIC.

I don't think you can use a wildcard in the left hand side of a CNAME
record - if you did, how would you match the righthand side of the
CNAME itself?

What happens when you look up "foo.hostname.com" when you have:
* IN CNAME foo.hostname.com.

Wildcards in A records are ok to use:

$ORIGIN hostname.com.

* IN A 192.0.0.5

Just for posterity (in case someone searches the list in the

the fact that I was using sox Version 12.17.1. It turns out
that version doesn't really work very well. I upgraded to
sox 12.17.3, and that appears to work reliably. It will also
presumably give me a coding example of how to handle /dev/dsp.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0209251501130.1222-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I _finally_ found an algorithm that permitted me to get data into a format
that OO would recognize properly for a mail merge operation (90 letters). I
sent this to the OO mail list and provide a copy for those of you who may
want to avoid the day-and-a-half it took me to work this out.

  "Office productivity" software? Ha! I still want to get a copy of WP
running again.

Rich
---------- Forwarded message ----------

  Here's what I did to get OO to properly recognize my data and use it to
create the final letters.

  Data started in a csv-formatted file (that's Comma Separated Values), with
double quotation marks delimiting text strings and commas separating fields.

  Data imported into XessSE, my linux spreadsheet. Zip codes (I had trimmed
them to 5 digits long before) were assumed to be numeric, despite being
surrounded by quotes. So I click on the column head and change the format to
"Text". Next, I use the search and replace function to remove the leading
'=' from the zip codes (remnants from when they were numbers). Finally, I
save the data in .xls format.

  Invoke OO. Open new doc, specifying the .xls spreadsheet. A calc window
opens over the blank writer window. Try to save by all means possible -- as
noted in my previous message -- and they all fail. Finally, I tell the
program to quit (via the File menu). Now, this is the important part: as
soon as the blank writer document window closes a dialog box pups up telling
me the spreadsheet should be saved, and do I want to save it in OO format? I
answer, "yes" and this time it actually works! Apparently the key is hveing
only the spreadsheet window open; the blank writer window screws up the save
process when changing format from the native import to native OO.

  Now, start OO over again. Open template latter. Select File -> Form letter
and this time, Voila!, it actually works as needed! All 90 letters are
printing now as I write this.

  I hope that I've provided sufficient details for the problems to be
identified and fixed. If not, contact me and I'll give you whatever
information you need.

  What an ordeal!

I thought that I'd send this out again since I didn't get any response.  I
also was curious about AGP video cards and Netgear FA 311.

Thanks for your opinions regarding this matter.

Subject: [PLUG] Putting Date/Time in ksh prompt
Message-ID: <551807712.1032992497653.JavaMail.root@monkey>

Here's one of those random questions that's been puzzling me for a long
time-- is it possible to embed the date/time in a ksh shell prompt?

I keep logs of most of my shell sessions.  It would be helpful to have
each prompt time/date stamped so that later I can correlate what I was
doing with what broke at the time.  ;-)

It looks like the closest I can do is to embed an arbitrary shell variable
which will be evaluated each time the prompt comes up.  Fortunately, ksh
includes the handy variable $SECONDS which evaluates to the number of
seconds since login.  If I do a "date" each time I log in and include the
number of seconds in the propmt, then it becomes possible to extrapolate
from that start time to get the date/time.

However, I'm hoping there's a better way.  Anyone know?

I don't even try to keep up with CPUs and mainboards anymore, it's nuts. I 
rely on the gang at Pacific Solutions for good advice. I've had good 
experiences at PC Club too. I used to buy a lot of Asus, but I've also been 
burned a few times recently. It is so not fun to have to return a 
motherboard, not when the whole darn computer has to come apart.

its ok. Thanks for the help.

What I would like to achieve is to have one unix account for a domain but
many email addresses.  I would then give the one unix account the ability
to forward email to other mail accounts either on the system or external. 
It looks like a procmail recipe would be best as the one unix account guy
could maintain the list.

Does that make more sense?

Matt,

  I have been asking for help, telling the list what I'm doing. No responses
other that "it works for me in StarOffice". I know full well how open source
software is developed; I've been part of the GRASS team for several years
now. When I tried to contact the developers directly, via the issuezilla
data base, I found that that didn't work, either. And I'm not the only one
to have this experience.

  My practice is to provide details and positive feedback. I want to see
this product work well, and doing a mail merge is really a rather
fundamental operation for a business. No deeloper on the project contacted
me off the list -- as I had requested -- so I could provide specific answers
and try various scenarios to give him/her some feedback.

  The message I passed on to both the openoffice and PLUG lists was a
detailed description of what I did to get the output I needed. It was not
beating them up unneccessarily. By detailing what worked and what didn't
work -- and what I read when it didn't -- I was trying to provide positive
and useful feedback.

  It's near the end of the month and I'm under the gun by clients to get
project work done. When the software takes 1-1/2 days to do a simple task, I
believe I'm allowed to express my frustration. Notice, too, that I never
wrote of the many times the application crashed on me when trying to save
documents or do another task. But crash it did.

  I'm more than willing to work with the OO (or abiword) developers to
produce a first class word processor. But, having to do this by myself
without any help from the developers is not the most fun I've had in a
while.

Rich

Assuming sendmail, I think you could accomplish the first with a 
virtual users (virtusers) entry (@domain.tld 
adminaddress at somewhere.else) ... and then use procmail to 
process them ... but we had done something like this in 
virtusers: 

# new domain
# local users
webmaster at domain.tld  russ
postmaster at domain.tld russ
# far off users
billing at domain.tld greg at somewherelse.com
# don't take all mail.
@domain.tld  spamtrap

assuming I have your question correct.

The current price/performance sweet spot on 3D AGP cards seems to be the
GeForce4 4200Ti line.  Watch out for the Mx line since they are really
more like a beefed up GeForce2 than the GeForce4.   (Look at the
performance stats and you'll see what I mean...)

I tend to stick with Intel or 3Com for NICs, since they both have
excellent Linux driver support and are widespread enough that bugs get
discovered and fixed very quickly.

No idea on motherboards.  I'm still using the venerable Intel BX chipset
since I haven't found a new board that meets my overly strict stability
requirements.

Subject: [PLUG] Transparent xvkbd
Message-ID: <20020925155940.A7147@cooper.kattare.com>

All;

I am working on a thin touchpad device that has a keyboard overlay printed on it's surface. The advantage of this is that it can be used as a multi-purpose device; it is useful as a keyboard, mouse, and sketchpad.

To do this, I would like to use xvkbd. Xvkbd is a virtual keyboard that prints a virtual keyboard on the screen. It will type to a focused window as you press the keys with your mouse.

I would like to do this without the keyboard printed on the screen. By that I mean, ``Okay, if you receive a touch on 00-05x X 00-05y than print an `a.'

The system does not necessarily need to use xvkbd. It can be anything that is capable of mapping a position range on the touchpad to an ASCII code to the keyboard controller.

Best,
--

WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS runs just peachy in an xdos/dosemu window.  Head
to http://www.dosemu.org to grab a copy.  The only drawback is the massive
polling done by WordPerfect tends to peg the CPU.

It's great for a nostalia boost even if you don't mean to get any work
done.  ;-)

The first time I went to Pacific Solutions was Monday.  
Quickest service I'd ever had and very good advice. 
(Power supply and a couple fans.)

I'm in the middle of building a system based off the 
Soyo Dragon Ultra, P4 based.  Ti4200 AGP card.  Very 
nice.  Loaded Redhat 7.3 no problems.  Though that was 
just a test, Gentoo is what I'm playing with.  Though 
it's having problems with the network. I can see the 
system produce traffic, but the system doesn't receive. 
Even tried plugging in different NICs.  Haven't had a 
chance to try the livecd on another machine to isolate 
the problem a bit further.  Maybe more on this later.

I'm running my own kernel here, but I'm pretty sure it worked before that.

This really depends on what you plan to do with the machine, and what
your budget is.  A great place to start research is 

http://www.tomshardware.com

Most of their testing is done with Windoze, but one of the tests they do
when testing motherboards and processors is to time the compilation of a
linux kernel.

I've used A7V, both the old version and the 333 with good luck.

USB 2.0 is still a ways off, I think.  ATA133 and AGP4 are okay.

K12LTSP uses the stock kernels (well, "stock" from Redhat, obviously w/ 
the -ac tree stuff, etc, not vanilla from kernel.org) from the 
corresponding version of Redhat it is built from (i.e. K12LTSP 2.1.1 >

I think the method you described is correct, it just looks like a
bit of hackery is required. Here is one method:

"How to make your Unix prompt show the time"
http://www.clearnight.com.au/cnsuxtp.htm

and here is code with an explanation of how it works:

"ksh time prompt PS1; It works, but *why*?"
http://bizforums.itrc.hp.com/cm/QuestionAnswer/1,,0x8e134b3ef09fd611abdb0090277a778c,00.html

One of the articles looked temporary, so the info is appended below for
PLUG archives.

Btw, in bash such hackery is not required. The @ symbol in PS1 yields the
time, or alternately PROMPT_COMMAND can be used to call date each time
PS1 is evaluated. This makes your date dynamic as well as time.

How to make your Unix prompt show the time

This script is designed for ksh, and relies on the fact that Unix
increments a variable called SECONDS every second.

If you don't change the value of SECONDS, it contains the number of
seconds since you logged in.

Here is the script, which we can call "timeprompt". It inserts the time
into your existing ksh prompt.
# Include time in prompt.
export SECONDS="$(date '+3600*%H+60*%M+%S')"
typeset -Z2 _h; typeset -Z2 _m ; typeset -Z2 _s    # 2 digits, zero padded
# hours, minutes and seconds...
_hh="(SECONDS/3600)%24"
_mm="(SECONDS/60)%60"
_ss="(SECONDS)%60"
_time='${_x[(_m=_mm)==(_h=_hh)==(_s=_ss)]}$_h:$_m:$_s'
export PS1=$(echo "${_time}\n${PS1}")

Place timeprompt somewhere in your PATH.
Modify your .profile and insert a line after your PATH and PS1 have been
set. Use this command: ". timeprompt"
This version of timeprompt begins by setting SECONDS equal to the time
(the number of seconds since midnight).
It then creates three variables that will always contain two-digits and be
zero-padded.
The _time variable is set to a formula that uses the evaluation of
subscripts in a dummy array _x to format the time.
The last line of timeprompt inserts _time , and a newline character into
your prompt.
Replace \n with a space if you want a single line prompt, but this may
become too long if you also include values such as ${HOSTNAME}, ${LOGNAME}
and ${PWD}

Timeprompt has been tested on AIX and UnixWare. It may require some
modification to work with ksh on other versions of Unix.
This information is subject to review and improvement. If you have any
questions or suggestions, please email us at Clear Night Software or use

ksh time prompt PS1; It works, but *why*? (ksh obfuscation?)

I've been looking at a current, continuously updated time prompt in ksh,
similar to:

http://forums.itrc.hp.com/cm/QuestionAnswer/1,,0xa0ead211e18ad5118ff10090279cd0f9,00.html

The variations on this item in my config are below. I see that it works. I
see that it has bugs (i.e., 17:10:00 fails). I'd like to understand what
is happening. Some things I get, others I do not:

1) I do not understand where _d comes from in the example above. Does it
matter?
2) I understand the typeset part; it assures the width of the
hour/minute/seconds variables.
3) I do not understand why let is used in one place (let SECONDS), but not
in the other (s=).
4) I do not understand the == in the SECONDS assignment.
5) Why are there no $ (dollar-signs) in the s variable assignment.
6) The [s] array reference totally blows my mind. What is this really?
7) I understand that a single-quote item will not be evaluated until run
time.

One item at a time, please. I'm squinitng like I'm trying to straighten a
corkscrew using only telekenses.

----- Begin script:

# Make certain that the length of time fields is 2-digit:

# Get a string which is parsable to the number of seconds.
let SECONDS=$(/usr/bin/date '+3600*%H+60*%M+%S')

I am suprised that all of the Olympians are not answering this one...could
it be that they actually go home once in awhile, or are they taking
National System Administrator appreciation day off...

${_d[_s]} is "slight-of-hand"...you have to trick the shell into making
the evaluation set-up in that s='...' line. More about that later.

The 'let' makes sure the string returned by date(1) is evaluated to a
number (sorta like eval would make a second pass on the same line), but
let does arithmetic stuff.

ME=5+5

leaves ME containing the string "5+5"

let ME=5+5

leave ME containing the string "10".

Since the Bourne shell, we have gotten into the habit of evaluating
arithmetic statements in other ways.

SECONDS is an automatic shell variable that contains the number of seconds
since shell invocation. If you try to set SECONDS to a number, like the
let in our example, SECONDS contains the number you set it to PLUS the
number of seconds since shell invocation. Hence, SECONDS keeps the current
time in seconds.

The output is "two" (stuff between square brackets is evaluated). And _s
is a big, long, boolean equation that sets the variables "hr", "min",
"sec" using the current value of SECONDS (yup, without the $). You can do
the same with $((...)) or ((..)).

You could say that _d stands for "dummy" (we just needed a dummy array)
and _s stands for "seconds string".

When the shell tries to print ${_d[_s]}, it evaluates _s arithmetically.
Breaking down _s, hr=(SECONDS/3600)%24 is an arithmetic statement that
sets hr to a number. It is also a boolean statement that is always true.
Taking out the code that sets variables, you have

(...)==(...)==(...)

The '=='s are boolean statements testing for equality. They don't "do"
anything but let one statement set all three variables.

To get a feel for how this works, consider the following code:

a[0]=zero
a[1]=one
a[2]=two
a[3]=three
a[4]=four

echo ${a[1+1]}


Hope that helps,
-dlt-

Sandy/Tyler:

Thanks for the great links.  My refined google search on "ksh PS1 prompt
date time" returned lots of good info.  Amazing how well one can refine a
search AFTER a good page is found.  ;-)

Bash is great-- "\d \t" and you're done.  Unfortunately, bash isn't a

So based on your summary below, the problem is that OO will not let you
do mail merges if the zip code is considered a number by OO Calc?

Did you try to fool the autorecognition software by appending
spaces to the zip codes inside the quotes while it was a CSV file?

"97123   "  may be recognized as a string, and won't hurt your mail
merge.

Doing this may also let you suck it directly into OO Calc, without the
intervening step of XessSE.

If you want to open the .xls without the blank writer document, you
can invoke soffice on the command line:

Agreed. I cut my UNIX tusks on ksh. When I got cozy w/linux, I at first
`chsh'd to ksh (better the devil you know). But once I drove bash around the
block I've never looked back - except, of course, at work *sigh*. Wish I had
a buck for every time I've done a <tab> and gotten a, er, <tab> :-( bash
command line completion rocks.

I have dealt with this kind of thing in the past with customers who are tired of getting spammed by the gazzilions of porn sites out there. I simply tell them that the e-mail may or may not be coming from the place they think it does. 

It is entirely too simple to log into an unprotected server and send out bogus e-mails using the grossly imperfect SMTP protocols....

This fellow needs to go to school and learn a bit before he takes PLUG to court or he will be very embarrassed.

Just my 2 cents

Colin,

  The problem originated with a data file external to OO; from my jpilot
addressbook. Some of the zip codes were 5-digits, some were 9-digits. OO's
Calc saw the 5-digit codes as numbers and tried subtracting the final 4
digits of the 9-digit codes, so the resulting merge had no zip code field.

  Someone on the mail list suggested changing the column to "text" from
"number". Turns out that this cannot be done from the Format menu and
there's nothing in the on-line help that explains what to do. I learned,
finally, that one highlights the entire column, then clicks the right
mouse/trackball button to reveal the "format cells" option. Unfortunately,
this does not work. I ended up with the 9-digit codes as text and the
5-digit codes as numbers. Again, no 9-digit zip codes in the merge.

  Then I went through all 90 rows of the spreadsheet and changed each one to
text, manually. As soon as I saved the spreadsheet, the 5-digit codes
reverted to numbers. So, I gave up and modifed all 9-digit codes to 5-digit
ones. Still empty zip code field in the merge on those records that had
originally been 9-digit codes.

  During all this, I followed someone's suggestion to use the .dbf files
exported from Calc. That did't work. When I exposed the fields in the
database so I could place them on the form letter, I was shown fields
numbered N1 through N16; my data have 7 fields. I also tried to use a plain
.txt file in various permutations.

  I've no idea what Calc is doing to the data. If I opened a new spreadsheet
and made the appropriate column formatted at "text" before importing my .csv
data, that column lost its formatting and I had mixed results again.

  This is why I got so frustrated in trying to accomplish this task. The
software appeared to be fighting me every step of the way. I reformatted my
data multiple times, recreated the fields on the form letter multiple times
and it was all trial-and-error with no guidelines. The one HOWTO did not
help for it assumed all data were consistent. Well, I _thought_ mine were
consistent as text, even the zip code field was surrounded by double quote
marks, but Calc just ignored that and made them all numbers.

  No. In every other spreadsheet I've used putting a string in double quotes
is sufficient for it to be recognized as text.

  I tried just about every possible permutation of four different data
formats: txt, csv, sxc and dbf. It's not been pretty.

  What I didn't try, because it finally worked, was opening the .xls file in
Calc, then closing the document window before trying to save the spreadsheet
in the native, OO format. That, too, should not have been as difficult as it
was.

  Where's that six-pack of microbrew ...?

Ok, I'm gonna get flamed for this, but oh well.
It seems to me that if you are interested in computers enough to run
a web server, then you should know (or learn) how to diagnose a bad
motherboard or CPU yourself!

And, for what it's worth, that wasn't good service. They took too
long, and didn't run the proper tests to determine what was actually
at fault. I have a small consulting/repair business on the side, and
we never operate like that. I can only imagine how much they charged
you for that. We would have charged $50 (including parts). Anyhoo,
that's not the point.
It's none of my business anyways.
I'm going back to my cave.

I'm using a Netgear FA311 on Libranet right now with no troubles. I have
also used the same card on RH7.2, RH7.3, Mdk8.1 with no problems. I did
have problems with Debian 3.0, but I had hardware problems all across
the board with Debian 3.0.

  Er, ... how so? Software and hardware are two different issues. You drive
a car (I presume); do you know how to diagnose and repair problems? I gave
up following hardware several years ago, and I was never an EE with the
knowledge or interest in diagnosing hardware problems. But, I can create,

Perhaps it's just a different mindset.  I drive a car, and yes, I can 
diagnose and repair just about *any* problem with it.  I can also 
diagnose and repair just about *any* problem with my computer hardware, 
down to the component level.  I'm not as good with software, but I do 
dabble with an occasional bit of code.

Jack of all trades, master of none.

I'm using 1.0.1, and in the Format menu it's Cells.  In the right mouse
context menu, it's Format Cells.  Same thing.

You're right.  It doesn't work and it's documented as not supposed to
be working in that way. (although I don't understand why it doesn't).
In general, if OO does something automatically, and then you tell it
not to do that automatic thing anymore, it won't undo what it did.  So
once you enter a number as a number, you're stuck with it.

In the OO help window, go to the index tab and enter:
numbers; as text
and look at the text that's displayed. It explains all that.

It's a bug/feature in the importing code.  However, playing around with
it I found out how you can override the bug.

1) Go back to your very original CSV file with the combination of 5 and
   9-digit ZIPs.

2) Open the CSV in any of the classic ways (on the command line,
or from a currently open document).

3) You get presented the Text Import dialog box.  At the bottom is the
Fields configuration.  It will allow you to preview your spreadsheet
based on delimiters, fixed width and so on.  More importantly, it will
let you select each column and override it's assumptions for the
format!

4) Select the column with the zip codes

5) Use the pull-down menu above (it defaults to "Standard", which is
probably where the bug lines) to change the format of the column to
Text.

>   Where's that six-pack of microbrew ...?

It's 5 o'clock in Germany, which is appropriate :)

I actually tried the solution above in 1.0.1 on a very simple CSV
file:

1,1,"1"
2,2,"2"
3,3,"3"
4,4,"4"
5,5,"5"
6,6,"6"
7,7,"7"
8,8,
9,9,
0,0,

and it worked okay.  I hope it works for you, too.

Don't know of any utilities, but I don't understand the problem either,
I just keep one spare cartridge on hand for each color (total cost for
the set < $60, and the convenience of not having to run to the store
immediately when the ink runs out is worth it), and replace the cartridges
the printer tells me to replace any time the printer indicates a cartridge
is out of ink.  Since the printer directly indicates which cartridge(s)
are out of ink as an integral and unavoidable part of the cartridge
replacement process, what is the problem?

It looks like this bit of shell hackery will not extend itself to dates,
since dates can't be done just by dividing the number of seconds since
start.  :-(

Still, it was a good tour of some ksh tricks.  ;-)

Thanks.  After more closely reading the users guide, I see that the
printer does indicate which cartridge is expended by moving it under the
out-of-ink symbol.  Very handy feature.

Does anyone know of ANY printers which support this on Linux?  For
example, the HP Business Inkjet series (which includes a couple of nice
PostScript color Inkjets) have a facility to check ink levels and printer
head health via the network using Windows-only tools.  Although HP seems
to be slowly getting onto the Linux bandwagon, none of their linux driver
sites mention supporting remote ink-level gathering.

Are there any printers with similar feature for linux?

Actually, I just noticed (thanks to my good friend Mr. Packet
Sniffer) that the ink level info seems to be collected via SNMP.

Maybe I can even find the MIB for it if I dig around enough.

This feature is a function of printer drivers which allow
bi-directional PCL/PJL protocol exchange between printers and PC's.
So far Linux printer drivers suport simplified unidirectional
set of printer commands just to spool a print job and direct it 
to a printer for output.
Do you really need to check printer catrige ink level 
and print head condition over a network,or your question just 
a matter of casual curiosity?
What would be the practical usage for this feature if it was 
available in Linux?

I'm going to have to go with the latter.  However, if I had 100 of these
printers to manage instead of just one then I might really NEED to check
the printer ink/head health remotely.

It would allow large-scale deployment of these printers in a Linux
environment and make management of them much simpler.  For example, by
gathering ink usage information remotely I could predict and record how
much ink was used, ensuring adequate stockpiles of ink.  This could even
be fed into a ticketing system automatically, sending an ink cartridge to
that location and dispatching the local PC tech to go change the ink.

Neither is applicable to my situation.  I'm just (over)curious.  ;-)

I had been using the FA311 with FreeBSD 4.3.  The driver 
included with that version of FreeBSD had problems with 
100 Mbs transfer (stalled).  I would imagine the latest 
version of FreeBSD has resolved this, but instead I 
swapped out the card with an Intel 82557-based NIC.

The FA311 seems to work like gangbusters for Windows OSs 
and Redhat or Caldera distros.

I'm using a Netgear FA311 on Libranet right now with no 
troubles. I have
also used the same card on RH7.2, RH7.3, Mdk8.1 with no 
problems. I did
have problems with Debian 3.0, but I had hardware 
problems all across
the board with Debian 3.0.

I need to parse my mail log for all mail received.
I have this awk script:
awk '($15 ~ /(montagne|MONTAGNE)/) {print $1 $2 " " $3  " " $12}' m.log

But obviously m.log should be /var/log/mail.log

My trouble is that I want to pass the user name to the script.  It
should then use that name in the "or" part of the regexp in both upper
and lower cases and also output the results to a file called
username.txt.

And all should be invoked simply, like "showmail username"

Heh, if you had 100 of these printers in a corporate environment, I 
think wanting to check the ink level remotely would be the LEAST of your 
worries.  Were I the sysadmin of said (ficticious) company, I'd buy ONE 
color laser for each floor/department, rather than 5-10 cheap color 
inkjets.  :)

Although...it would be nice on a home level if the printer was hooked up 
to the linux server, and one of the kids couldn't print - 
father-type-person could log in remotely from work and check the ink 
status, then call home and tell clueless teenager which ink cartridge to 
replace.

But, I digress.  To each his own.  :)

My first shot would be:

     awk "(\$15 ~ /(${lcUser}|${ucUser})/) {print \$1 \$2 \" \" \$3 \" 
\" \$12}" m.log

Replace the single quotes with double quotes at each end of your awk(1)
command string.  And then use the backslash (\) to escape all the shell
meta-characters (the dollar signs [$] and embedded double quotes ["] ).

I haven't been following this thread, but you can get any kind of a date

appropriate options, this:

  PS1='`date +%D\ %k:%M\>`'

Gives a prompt like this:

Thanks guys, this is what I ended up with:
Pretty cool I think.

#!/bin/bash

#variable definitions
username=$1

awk "BEGIN {IGNORECASE=1}; (\$15 ~/$username/) {print \$1 \$2 \" \"  \$3 \" \" \$12}" mail.log>$username.txt

#End Script

Don's worked too once I escaped all the $s.  You guys are a great
resource.  Now I'm off to show off my new tool

Ahh. But maybe I spoke too soon.  IGNORECASE seemed to not return the
capitalized versions as did the tr... version.  So perhaps I mispoke.
Can anyone else verify that?

As an alternative, you can force case of your string, e.g. to lower
with tolower() and then compare with that.  E.g.:

  awk 'tolower($1) ~ /booger/'

which will match any capitalization: Booger, BOOGER, booger, et al.

Just a man page read.  Though I was looking for a regex construct
equivelent to perl's /STRING/i

Alas, this does not work in ksh, the shell I'm currently stuck with on the
servers I'm working on.

Message-ID: <200209261555.03358.aschlemm@attbi.com>

In case anyone else might be interested, this little tidbit came through 
on the Seattle Linux List. This is a tweak that allows the default page 
size within OpenOffice to be changed so a new document would to say 
"U.S. Letter" rather than A4. 

My system was set to A4 by default and so I always had to change the 
page size manually to U.S. Letter when I created a new document. I had 
looked at some of the OO FAQ documents but never found this 
information. Maybe it's there and I just didn't use the right search 
string that would cause a match to be found.

Enjoy,

Tony

after a bit of hunting...

according to: http://www.jca.umbc.edu/FAQ_Computing.html

"There is no way (AFAIK) that a user can change their default page
 size. But the SysAdmin may do so by editting the file:

/path/to/OpenOffice/share/psprint/psprint.conf

In this file, look for the parameter: PPD_PageSize . Set it to an
appropriate value, like Letter."


The file is nicely commented; changing it worked great on my
 installation

Hi Cooper,

It worked, but I was logged in at the same time as someone else, this
might be a security concern.

I also tried to open Xpaint, but it failed to open, and I couldn't get
rid of the error message, I also could not move either of the windows.

Have you tried this with the non-java vncserver?  I would think you
would get better response.

This is really pretty cool. I'm not familiar with this technology.
I assume, since it's http:// and not https:// that the traffic is
not encrypted. If I was going to use something like this to access
my desktop I guess I'd want that. Can the same thing be done through
https?

If it was done that way, would the security be roughly equivalent
to using ssh with ssh access allowed from any address?

	How does this differ from an X session over SSH? What are the 
relative advantages of VNC over running ...

I think one difference would be that you get the window manager
on the target system. For example you might be browsing from a
Microsoft or Apple machine at a client's office (that would be the
situation I would see using it in)

Tony,

  If you go to the template editor and change your preferences there, then
save it as the default, it sticks.

  This one I got past a while ago. Wish all my OO problems resolved as

interesting are:

prtMarkerLifeCount.1.[1-4]
--------------------------
Number of pages printed by each "prtMarker",
in the case of this printer, number of pages printed with each ink
color.  They're always equal.

prtMarkerSuppliesMaxCapacity.1.[1-4]
------------------------------------
Number of tenths of mL each ink cartridge holds.  (The units, 0.1 mL in
this case, are stored in "prtMarkerSuppliesSupplyUnit")

prtMarkerSuppliesLevel.1.[1-4]
------------------------------
This is the actual ink level, again in tenths of mL.

Now I just need to get MRTG set up to plot all these...

Why?  Because it can!  ;-)

By default, no. It is easy to create an encrypted session. Here is the web
page for VNC:

  http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/

It deals specifically with encryption in the FAQ.

I tested this in ksh under Debian Linux and it worked, further, I used to
use something similar to this under SCO UNIX and their stock version of
ksh about ten years ago, what version of UNIX and ksh are you using?

Yes, more than one person can be on the same server at the same time. All
of you knew the correct password for that server. It is not difficult to
imagine a Beowulf cluster running hundreds of instances of the vnc server:
each being unique with their own passwords.

In this case, I was working on the system at the same time you were.

Derek mentioned not being able to run Xpaint. This is a fallacy of my
machine; I have a menu item for it but do not have it on the server.

This is different as it is a complete desktop. I am not sure if you can
run ssh -X <servername> through a browser. Can you without special

This is on HP-UX 11.0, using their ksh "Version 11/16/88".

On this braindead ksh, the above PS1 gives:

`date +%D %k:%M>`

As the prompt.  ;-)

The thing I like about fixing it this way is that all users on the 
system get whatever page size is specified. I thought about using a 
template myself but that just fixes the problem for my user. I guess to 
make it global I would somehow need to make the template global on the 
system. That may be possible but so far my usage of OO hasn't been that 
sophisticated at this point.

There is just such a utility.

escputil is a command-line utility for doing all kinds of cool things with
Epson Stylus Color printers.  It's bundled with the gimp-print package.

I think that setting site-wide (or at least server-wide) defaults
for printer and paper settings is exactly why the "spadmin" tool
is included in OO.

That is true and I have set up several printers that default to U.S. 
Letter size paper. Setting up the printers has no effect when a new 
document is created as the paper size for myself and many others has 
been A4 and not U.S. Letter. 

The psprint.conf file is human readable and the printer settings are 
stored in that file. There is a separate page size value outside of the 
printer configurations settings that is not affected by setting up a 
printer's the paper size though the "spadmin" program.

To wit: I got 8 hits on google for "puglug" only two of which are linux
related (numbers 7 and 8). Guess what, they are from the PLUG archives on
this very topic.

The sixth hit is on an Orc Language (presumably for DnD or other such
RPG), in which puglug is a defined as a "tall humanoid." If you were
wondering, a small humanoid is a ruglug.

No, I'm not making this up.

Hello Guys,

I just installed redhat 7.3  and after a small effort,
it is talking to my netgear router MR 314.
But unlike before, now when I boot I get a login
prompt 
with my hostname dhcppc2. and after I login i have to
startX and then it starts my Gnome session.
Why did this start happening and more importantly 
what should I do to revert back so that when the
machine boots , it loads a Gnome session, without me
hvg to invoke it ? 
Shd I be changing the inittab file.

Thanks,
Swapnil.

It looks like a server I watch over (obviously not very well) was broken
into and is spewing forth tonnes of mail.  They got in and cleaned up
before any of my reports caught them and I could disable what they were
doing.  (Seems like it might have been the apache/mod_ssl exploit.)
   I found a util (PSReal) that lists hidden processes and I see two; one
with a Process ID of 0 (zero) and the other 17.  I've tried using kill and
killall but to no avail.  Nothing is turned up in a search using google
except a method to kill when shutting down.  I have a 99% sure reboot
fix/trick but the server is 35 miles away in a Colo so I'm hesitant to try
my trick remotely.
   What it comes down to is is there a way to kill a _very_ stubborn
process and should I try it on process 0?  (Coming from Data General
experience I'm concerned that process 0 is like DGs ring 0 - a
'bad-thing-to-kill'.)

Message-ID: <GJELJBAKILGBFNJHBMKGEEHJCHAA.CurtisE@CurtisE.net>

Nice!  I'm on a Win2K box with IE5 and a fairly speedy cable connection.
The responsiveness/screen updates was quite useable.  It's been a while
since I've used VNC, but a couple of years ago I used VNC heavily in a
Windoze and HP-UX environment.  It was nice to not have to leave the comfort
of my cube and freeze my um, sensitive parts, off in the data center when I
needed console access to a server.  The speed then was fine when on the LAN,
but I recall a 128K ISDN connection being pretty darn painful.  I know they
planned to work on making VNC more bandwidth efficient, but I can't really
make an apples to apples comparison.

Security is obviously an issue given your current configuration, but that
can be fixed easily enough, once your done playing with the demo.  I wonder
how much of a performance hit it will take when you enable encryption.  Of
course one drawback of using VNC instead of SSH & X is that you are limited
to a single concurrent user (I think that's still the case - unverified)
with VNC.  Of course that may not be a requirement in your case.  Of course
with VNC, you don't need to tote a cross platform SSH client and X server
disk around...

CurtisE

I agree.  I have been able several times to get to them quick enough to 
prevent them getting established.  I'm going to run some more checks to 
determine if they changed any system files.

Maybe I'm missing some switch.  Time to re-read the man page.

Yup '/bin/kill' kills the process - or at least claims to - but it comes 
back.

I don't see the process using lsof but I think it might be tied to the 
httpd process.


Thanks for the ideas and suggestions.

Yes. Open /etc/inittab and look for the initdefault line:

  id:3:initdefault:

Change the 3 to a 5, i.e.,

  id:5:initdefault:

I've never taken the time to figure out the cleanest way to get from 
runlevel 3 to 5. I *think* this would work, but I've never verified 
it:

1. Logout of all console and X sessions.

2. Press Alt-F1 to get to the first virtual console.

3. Login as root.

4. /sbin/telinit q; /sbin/telinit 5

5. Logout from root console session.

6. Press Ctrl+Alt+F7 to get to graphical login screen.

And then a PIB will demand color hard copy of your mrtg 
graphs.  So you can watch the PIB reports drain the 
printer of its ink.  Heck, with banner paper you might
even hit near real time reporting.

Have you checked your kill binary to ensure it is not part of the
rootkit and is ignoring the other trojaned binaries?

FWIW, I did sucessfully recover a machine that had been compromised
without a wipe and reinstall.  The keys for me were:

	ensuring the RPM was clean
	getting lsattr and rmattr clean
	getting ps, ls, top clean
	using nessus on the system
	being highly motivated to keep trying.

Not that I could see.  And my file checking routine didn't report it being 
changed.  It uses md5sums.

Another link for you is http://www.tightvnc.com  They take the AT&T code

Is the process of replacing an ls or ps as simple as deleting the old file and
replacing it with a known good version, or are there all kinds of other issues
like pointers to and from the file that must be dealt with as well?

I have done that before, simply replaced, and it worked but I did finally
rebuild/reinstalled the whole OS to _make sure_.

the other day. I thought I was going to need it for a class. However, 
that doesn't seem to be the case. My RH 7.2 will continue to serve me.
	Before I take it back, I thought that I'd offer it up in case 
someone else wanted a great deal on an unopened copy. It has CD's for 
everything, support, and automatic updates...

	$150  ... (includes a $20 mail-in rebate) SRP is $199 (Fry's 
normal price)

	Let me know.

I like this comment, only possible with open-source.

"We didn't want to use just GNOME and get KDE users upset. We didn't
want to use just KDE and get GNOME users upset. Instead, we combined the
two, and got everyone upset," he quipped.

  And if they had used Xfce instead, no one would be upset. :-)

I've been running 7.3.94 (the (null) beta) on my wife's machine for a 
couple weeks now. As someone who could care less about the feelings of 
GNOME and KDE developers/partisans, she's very pleased. She was able 
to transition to Evolution without a hitch -- and both she and my 
7-year-old daughter really like the default background image on the 
desktop.

I've had no trouble. Just open the service finder thingee (Cmd K? my 
memory fails me) and do

  smb://host.name/sharename

Typically, you'll be prompted for a username, which should be entered 
in the standard smb format:

  domain\username

The problem for us hasn't been the connections but the bloomin' 
faux-stream files that Macs insist on littering around the filesystem.

  Nice idea and implementation. Of course, he runs Microsoft and uses a tiny
monitor, but what the heck.
 
  What we need out here is one that adds a microbrew tap off the side.
(Could you run the coffee machine _and_ a microbrew system with only 2
cpus?.)

Ah the SHQ - Spousal Happiness Quoitent.  I'm surprised this isn't
mentioned in more reviews.  So important, so overlooked.

My wife was thrilled when WIFI brought me out of the computer room
and into the living room.

And mine was thrilled when I upgraded her laptop w/WIFI so that she didn't
have to go upstairs to get online. Now I can't get her away from the laptop
(I'll have to get my own). And our 4-year old has never known a world
without WIFI. Some day I can see her commenting, "you mean you had to have
wires to use your computer back then?".

Ooh! Ooh! This one I know! Depending on how you're trying to set up the
connection, osx already has a built in samba client. If you want to connect
to the osx machine as a server, you need to install Samba Server (which you
can find at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/xamba/ ), which I know hides
the mac specific files (.DS_Store, anyone?) with a little checkbox option.

Is anyone interested in a how-to on this? I know a lot about it, having set
up my Mac as a fileserver (via samba) so my husband's Wintendo could connect
to it. I don't see a lot of osx questions around here, is it because
nobody's using it or just that everyone's a Darwin master and doesn't have a
need to talk about it? Hmmm...

-Kelly

Would it help if I got out and pushed? It might!

Ahh, you're right.  I didn't check it after that.

I just went and hacked my login to allow it to use bash instead.  I 
think I may just be the *only* person in the entirety of the building to 
use it instead of csh or ksh.  ;)

			   Overview of LVM
		       (Logical Volume Manager)

				  by
			   Cooper Stevenson
		    <cooper at linux-enterprise.net>


      Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is a system for handling disks
      and disk partitions.  It enables one to "glue" two or more
      disks or partitions together to form a larger virtual
      disk which can then be logically partitioned and used like
      a normal disk, only with extra features.  For example, one
      can resize LVM based file systems.

      **********************************************************

          Agenda:

              7:00 - 7:30  Business

Paul,
Actually my inittab does have runlevel 5. yet it 
stills boots up to a login prompt.
I also did run the telinit commands as you had given 
but it didn't touch the inittab file.

Thanks,
Swapnil.

Subject: [PLUG] Problems Installing Linux on WinNT disk
Message-ID: <3D94C9ED.E2B7F8A6@gisnet.com>

I want to set up a dual-boot system with WinNT and Linux (RH 7.1)
The problem is that I cannot seem to get a partition set up to
suit Disk Druid.

I have a 40GB drive with a 20 GB partition on it that's totally
empty, but it's FAT32 and DD doesn't like it. So I tried to use
NT's disk manager and delete that partition, and let Linux claim
it. That didn't work as NT left the disk in a state Anaconda
doesn't support (Type 0). So then I tried making a small
partition (4096 MB) as DOS FAT. DD was happy with that, but
wouldn't let me allocate any more than 1MB for the /boot mount
point, and apparently I need 2M.

Ignorance is frustrating...

So then I thought I could just remove that WinNT partition with
something lower level that Windows Disk Manager. I then searched
for fdisk on my Windows disk. Not there. Not on the original,
MS-official, licensed distribution CD, either. Then I heard that
I actually need cfdisk for an NT box, 'cause fdisk won't work on
NT. Couldn't find cfdisk.exe either.

So does anyone know how can get Linux loaded in another partition
on the #@$%&* NT machine? 

TIA,
- Bill Thoen

  Do you like the sparse look of an empty desktop, but still want virtual
desktops? I just learned that in Xfce if you put:

Style "*"                       NoIcon

in ~/.xfce/xfwmrc, iconizing an app (_including_ the panel) makes it
disappear completely.

  To see all open apps, just right-click on the root window and a menu of
'em appears. The control panel is one of these apps so you can get it back
again when desired. Of course, you can set up all the user menus that are
accessible with a left-click on the root window, so no desktop clutter at
all is necessary.

Bill;

If I were you, this is what I would do:

 1) Download Tom's Root Boot bootable floppy diskette from your NT box.
Follow the instructions for rawwrite (also in Tom's site) to create a
fresh root/boot disk.

  2) Tell your BIOS to boot from the floppy disk. Boot Tom's root/boot disk.

  3) Run fdisk. Linux's fdisk *does* correctly identify NT partitions.
Here's the command:
   fdisk /dev/hda

  4) Press `p' for `Print the partition table' `d' for delete a partition.
Specify the correct partition number to delete (probably partition 2
from your description)

   5) Type `n' for add a New partition. The default start and end
cylanders should be correct.

   6) Type `t' for change the partitions Type. Select type 83, `Linux
Native.'

   8) Type `w' for Write the partition table. Reboot the machine with the
floppy still in the drive.

   9) CAUTION: This next command could wipe out the NT partition if you
are not carefull about what partition you wish to format. *MAKE SURE*
you are working with the correct partition. It is probably /dev/hda2
but I cannot be certain without looking at your partition table.

   mkfs /dev/hda2

The console will seem ``stuck'' for awhile while mkfs does it's work. Be
patient. Observe the HDD LED.

   10) Now, enter this:

      fsck /dev/hda2

   11) fsck will likely tell you that the filesystem is clean after a few
seconds. Reboot the machine, change the BIOS back to booting from the
CD-ROM and be amazed that Anaconda correctly recognizes the partition.

Thanks, but it doesn't look like "Tom's Root Boot" can be used
with an Windows 2000 box. The web page says "DOS or Windows-9x" I
tried it anyway, and it failed.

So my problem (below) still stands:

Tom's doesn't "run" on Windows. It is it's own "Linux on a floppy", you 
just get the image on the floppy and boot from it.

I know... but I need to run the program that makes the disk
image, so I downloaded the DOS/Windows version, ran install.bat,
and it died. I need to try something else.

Bill,

  The 'rawrite.exe' utility on the Red Hat disk #1 (under dosutilities, or
just utilities, I forget the name of the directory) will put the image on
the floppy disk in the proper format to boot. Can't just copy it with a DOS
tool.

Well, I got a working copy of Tom's Root Boot (I used another
Linux machine to make it), and it worked up to "mkfs", which
wasn't there. Didn't matter though, the disk came up as a Linux
disk. The partition I wanted to use was /dev/hdb5, and this is
now about 18MB in Linux native format. So I started the install
process again...

Now the NEW problem. I can't put a boot partition on it (error is
'> 1024 cylinders'). Linux keeps wanting to put a boot partition
on /dev/hda, which is 1023 cylinders. However, that disk has only
one partition and it's currently in use by Win2K. Do I have to
use /dev/hda, or can I put Linux entirely on /dev/hdb5? What do I
do if I have to split /dev/hda into two partitions and don't want
to hose up Windows?

Mark,

I assume you are right.
I said what I said, because I thought I had walked to OGI from MAX
once long ago.  However, it may have been a long walk.  I don't recall.

The best way to get to OGI via MAX in the evening is to take a
bike with you on the MAX and then ride to OGI from the 205th
Ave MAX stop.

For those of us without bikes, what's the recommended way to 
get to OGI after getting off of MAX?

Subject: [PLUG] Help with Sparc kernel recompile
Message-ID: <017401c2670c$3a0d16c0$1600a8c0@vncvr1.wa.home.com>

I'm attempting to recompile the kernel for my Sparc20.  I picked 2.4.9 because, well, it's listed at the bottom (vs. 2.4.19 which are listed near the top) ;-)

When it comes to the actual compile, 'make bzImage' and 'make zImage' fail.  In my research this appears to be because I dont have x86 architecture.  I have seen suggestions for both 'make boot' and 'make vmlinux'.  Both seem to do the same thing (fail at the end because 2.4.9's vt.c header is broken for Sparc).

Question :
Does it, ultimately, make any difference whether I execute 'make boot' vs. 'make vmlinux?'

Thanks!
Todd

P.S.  I am downloading linux-2.4.19.tar.gz as I type...

I live out this direction. The best way would probably be to see if
Tri-Met has a bus that goes from either 185th stop out that direction. I
think there are buses that run down Cornell road.

I *could* take 3 people also, there and back. I'm not sure yet if I'm
going, though, so email me if you could use a ride and if a couple people
email me it may sway my decision.

I've never compiled Linux on a spark but there is a website listed in 
the kernel documentation for both 32/64 bit SPARC Linux:

http://www.ultralinux.org/

You might look at the FAQ in Section 4 which has information about 
building the kernel.

Greetings,

 I recently downloaded Mandrake 9.0 too. On my system
it (disc 1) mounts and reads fine. I haven't checked
it to boot yet, My other box is currently down and
this one is a web-server, so, I can't take it down.

Here's the MD5SUM for the disc:
f7a093af34b8cbe1abc165213fea9deb

If yours is the same, you may have a bad disc, try
burning again. Also, did you set your BIOS to boot
from the CD?

May the Source be with you,
Vincent Damewood

I have a copy, one of the first, and it wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped it 
would be.  Some interesting stuff but the man pages helped me more.

This is neat and it works on tarballs too.

Agreed.  This is how I learned enough to _fix_ some RPMs that wanted to 
install/build stuff I had no want or need of.

And most of all:

	Thanks Paul.

  I seem to remember reading about this once but never got around to it
until I read this message.  I've already started building RPMS of CPAN
packages I've spent hours installing on multiple machines.  RPMs would
have made it a no-brainer and now will.


Again thanks,

Bill,
Since you are dual booting there are three options for you.

1) Install the RH boot loader to /dev/hdb5 and boot from the floppy you 
make during install.
2) Use the Windows boot loader to boot Linux from the hdb5 partition.
3) Install a Linux boot loader and configure it to boot Win2K.

I, personally, would do #1 and then when I got tired of how slow a floppy 
boot is I'd go on to #2. If you do try the boot floppy method, dup your 
floppy just in case it fails. I use method #2 at work with an NT 
workstation, but I don't know what wrinkles Win2K puts in the scenario. 
Surf over to http://tldp.org and check out the dual booting HOWTOs for 
more info. I'd only do #3 with a couple of full backups of the Win2K 
partition(s).

HTH,
Keith

I'd consider it.  But such action would impede my progress in getting
to OGI while expediting my progress in becoming a ward of the state.

Actually, if you don't have a bike, the best way would be to get off the
MAX downtown, walk over to CityBikes Co-op, buy a bicycle, get back on
MAX and follow the previous directions.

By the way, can someone give directions from the MAX stop to OGI for us
cyclists and long walkers?

I went through this process recently using XP and Linux.  Here's what I
did...

1. Downloaded the trial version of PartitionMagic from
www.powerquest.com

2. Changed the size of the NTFS partition

3. Installed Linux (Debian)

This not only kept my install of XP intact, but installing Debian went
off without a hitch.  I poked around a bit on sf.net and freshmeat.net
and didn't really see anything that would split NTFS file systems... but
that doesn't mean there isn't anything, just that I didn't find it :)

I have walked from the Max station to OGI. It takes about
1/2 hour. Get off at the 205th and Quatamma (I think that's
right).

Go on the walk/bike trail that you will see north of the tracks
(right side from the outbound train).

Take that path to where it ends. Continue a bit north on the
sidewalk to the intersection. I don't know the names of the
streets.

Cross the street, heading east (to your right).

Continue walking north until you come to some low
one story office buildings (Intel). Walk over the
berm onto the parking log and head east.

OGI is hidden in the trees east of the Intel office
complex.

I've tried looking online, google searches, etc., but can't find

that makes this horrible high-pitched whining sound as soon as it starts

perform fine, but I can't even use the thing since it's so loud.

Hmmm. 7200 RPM?  Is this a recent high pitched whining or has it always 
been like that?

The 60GB & 80GB are not quiet, but not excessively loud either IMO.  At 
least when inside a case...

If it's a recent development, it could be that a bearing is starting to 
go.  I had a Quantum at work the other day that sounded like a jet 
taking off and it was bugging people a couple rows over.  (And I work in 
a noisy lab.)  It passed all it's diagnostics as well, but after three 
hours siezed up and made a nice clunking noise.
Then it wasn't so loud :)

Sounds a lot like a bearing going. Recommend backing up before it gets
louder, and then very quiet. Often, this is accompanied by an unpleasant
odor.

Well, it sounds like my drive is dead. Luckily, I've already backed it
up and replaced it with a new Seagate Barracuda 80GB drive. Nice drive,
quiet. I was just hoping there was something more I could do. It sucks
to have to throw out such a large drive. Oh well. These things happen.

Thanks for all the help!

Did you try giving it a tap right over the spindle with a little hammer?

Sometimes that works dandily.  My guess would be that (in those
situations) the bearings our just not quite set in their place and causing
some undue friction.

By the way, instead of throwing that drive out, you can give it to me.  I
could certainly put it to good use before it truly fails.

Josh,

My take? Who cares. This is definately not normal behavior for a hard
drive. Take it back.

If the retailer will not honor the purchase (some gentle but firm coaxing
directed toward the retailer may be necessary here) then get an RMA# from
the manufacturer. Ask about cross shipping.

If the manufacturer gives you any flack, simply put the phone to your
computer for a few moments. If he/she still offers flack, offer to do this
again.

Repeat as necessary.

If you get off at the Quatama and 205th stop and cross the street (205th)
you'll be on the right side of the road to cycle or walk to the business
complex where OGI is located. I'm bad with directions (N,S,E,W), but I
*think* that's North (left) and go up 205th. If you hit Cornell Road
you've gone too far. You're supposed to turn right before then into the
business park. Hopefully someone else can fill in the rest. If not I plan
on looking on OGI's website for the rest.

I think the east-west street you are looking for is NW Von Neumann
Drive.  Mapquest is your friend.  I did this walk the weekend that
Westside Max opened.  If I recall correctly, it is about a 15 minute
walk.  At that time (hopefully it has improved) there was a dearth of
sidewalks near the Quatama station.  There is another Max stop near
185th, but I think it is a longer walk to OGI.

_My_ question is whether the talk is going to include anything I
wouldn't know already if I read the LKML.

You know, that would be ideal, but I bought it about a year and a half
ago in Colorado, and I looked everywhere and couldn't find a receipt. If
I could, I'd do something about it. Bummer.

Irrelevant. Especially if you used a Visa. *Always* pay for hardware with
a Visa. Give them the serial number and they will likely honor it.

If it is still under manufacturers warranty, you may not need a receipt,
many companies will use the serial number to determine the date of
manufacture and whether or not the drive is under warranty.  You might try
the manufacturers web site to see what their return policy is.

I am trying to install the latest Mandrake 9.0 onto a hard drive that I
have successfully installed 8.2 on, but I am getting this error when I
boot from the 9.0 CD:

kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 01:03

I never really used the 8.2 version because I wasn't able to use Xwindows
with it, even though during the installation I was able to see Xwindows
when it asked me if I could see the penguins.. but that's a different
problem.

So, I've been waiting for the new version to come out, and it finally did,
I downloaded it and burned it to CD, and this is where I am.. with that
error.  Any ideas?  How can I reformat that drive so it will accept the
new version of Mandrake?

Thanks.

James

Message-ID: <3D9701A7.9EDD99F@computer-arts.net>

Can someone tell me how to find out about mailman. It appears to be
running on my system (/var/log/mailman is full of empty "error" file)
and unless I need it for some reason I'd like to turn it off.

None of these commands find anything:

  chkconfig --list | grep -i mailman
  man mailman
  apropos mailman
  grep -ir mailman /etc/cron*

However, the following appears in /var/log/cron:

  Sep 29 06:31:00 puddleglum CROND[1766]: (mailman) CMD (/usr/bin/python -S
/var/mailman/cron/qrunner)

about once per minute.

I'm totally ignorant about mailman. Can someone point me in the
right direction?

Here are the files that might contain Mailman-related stuff:

* /etc/aliases or its moral equivalent on your system
* root's crontab or, perhaps, in one of the /etc/cron.*/ directories
* Apache's httpd.conf

Once you're rid of Mailman stuff in those places, then you can safely 
remove the Mailman package from your system.

  For the past couple of Sundays I've seen this message in my morning mail,
but I've not been able to figure out what to do about it.

  Reading /etc/cron.weekly/makewhatis.cron tells me that the script
establishes a so-so lock, then runs 'makewhatis -w' to rebuild the database
I access with the locate command.

  But, it doesn't suggest -- to me -- what to do to resolve these errors.
They missing files appear to be man pages and this raises the questions of
why they're missing (on a newly established RH 7.3 system), whether I should
try to find the files and install them some place or whether I need to tell
makewhatis to not look for these guys.

/etc/cron.weekly/makewhatis.cron:

zcat: ./mailq.1.gz: No such file or directory
zcat: ./newaliases.1.gz: No such file or directory
zcat: ./aliases.5.gz: No such file or directory
Read file error: ./disable.8 No such file or directory
Read file error: ./reject.8 No such file or directory

  What write you experts?

Thanks,

Actually "makewhatis" is for man pages. The locate database is built by

Thanks, I found some aliases in /etc/aliases and removed them.
I forgot to check /var/spool/cron when I was trying to figure out
how it was running. So, now it's all commented out.

I'll bet you can determine if the drive is still under warrenty on the 
Western Digital website. I deal with RMA's to manufacturers quite often, 
and most have many automated processes on the web.

Drives are especially good, as usually, no receipt is required. They 
know when the drive was made.

I had a devil of a time getting a good disk 1 burned. I believe I now 
have a good disk, it just took several tries.

Yes, I *DID* check the md5sum, and it checked out each time.

Although, I did get a different error than you, it still points to a bad 
burn.

Noisy drives are usually the sign that a bearing is going bad.  It is a 
sign that you should probably replace it, else you will be haunted by the 
screams of the drive until its impending death.

The last drive I bought was made on Sept 7th, 2002.  I think it is still 
in warrenty.  (It is printed on the drive label with Western Digital 
drives.)

Not always.

What file system is on the root partition?  Ext3 or some other 
non-ext2 partition?  May be a problem with the initrd code not loading in.

I get that message when I have a kernel that cannot figure out the root 
filesystem.  (Compiling the kernel so that critical filesystem code needed 
to mount the root partition is a module is insane.  I have complained to 
Mandrake before about that.  Did no good.)

Subject: [PLUG] Linux Firewall with Cisco Router
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0209291244070.18317-100000@localhost.localdomain>

Hello-

Well I figured it was time to lock down my network with a Linux firewall
instead of the minimal firewall provided in my Cisco router.

I have been running my home network with a Cisco 678 modem/router (?) 
hooked up to a Linksys 5 port switch. (DSL with Qwest)

I was recently given an old box so I downloaded a copy of Coyote Linux and
I now have the box running Coyote Linux off of the floppy.

I plugged the Cisco 678 with a crossover cable into one NIC on my box, I 
then took a regular cable and ran it from the second NIC to the switch.

The Cisco 678 showed a LAN link and activity, so I think that is all
working pretty well. The switch shows a link but neither of the other two
lights light up they are called '100' and 'Full/Col'.

The Cisco 678 is 10.0.0.1
The internet NIC on the Linux box is 10.0.0.2
What should the NIC going to the switch be?

The Cisco 678 has DHCP running, the Linux box does not. Do I need to 
swap this around so that the Cisco 678 is static and the Linux box is 
running DHCP?

Would a good trouble shooting activity be to get the LAN working without 
the Cisco 678 even in the picture?


Thanks in advanced for your help-
Michael

I've seen people reporting this problem before and it may have something 
to do with existing database caches being out of date, of the wrong 
version, or corrupt.

You might try running:

"mandb --create"

This will cause all databases to be recreated from scratch.

  I did -- there's no mandb on my RH system. Apropos "man" and "rebuild"
yield no clues, either. Have I missed something here?

I would like to thank you all for advice regarding warranty. I was ready
to throw the thing in the trash, but after checking the website, I found
that it was actually quite easy to get warranty coverage, as mine is
still covered and all I have to do is ship it back to them. That's
great. Now I'm not out that 40G of storage! Thanks!

first, the other two lights light up they are called
'100' and 'Full/Col' means that you are not running on
100base tx on that nic, which is normal because the
cisco 678 only has a 10baset ethernet port on it. 
after all, you arent going to see dsl service above
10mb/s anyway, right?

second, the cisco needs to be configured for dhcp, as
it gets its ip dynamically from the isp.  it also
gives an ip dynamically to the cpe(customer premise
equipment).  therefore, both the cisco and the
firewall need to be configured to recieve their ip's
dynamically.  the firewall would have the wan nic
configured this way.  

third, I would personally get the internal network
working first, using static ip addressing.  you can
set this up without worrying about the wan nic and its
address, as they are effectively independant in this
situation.  

hope this helps, and I would welcome any feedback to
my advise from other pluggers!

Well unfortunately I don't run RedHat and I'm surprised at some of the 
differences between the distros. I have both "makewhatis" and "mandb" 
on my system although I do not have a man page for "makewhatis" to see 
what it does exactly and what file(s) control its operation if any. 

I also looked at my OpenBSD system which has a man page for "makewhatis" 
but it appears to have different command line arguments that what the 
Linux versions as. I did run my version of "makewhatis" and I don't 
even have a "-w" argument:

tigger:~ # makewhatis --help
Usage: makewhatis [-u] [-v] [-m manpath]
   This will build the old style whatis database
   for the man pages found in manpath by using the
   new index database scheme (see mandb(8)).
   Available options are:
       -u          update whatis database with new pages
       -v          give some infomation about progress
       -m manpath  Override system default
   
/usr/local/man:/usr/share/man:/usr/X11R6/man:/opt/gnome/man:/usr/openwin/man:/usr/lib/teTeX/man:/usr/lib/teTeX/man

>From reading what "makewhatis" says it sounds like "mandb" is the new 
way of creating man database caches and "makewhatis" the old way...

This thread got me curious.  Like you, I could find no reference to 
"mandb" on my rh box.  So..  I got to looking.

The man rpm lists two cron entries.

/etc/cron.daily/makewhatis.cron
/etc/cron.weekly/makewhatis.cron


The only difference I can see is the:

	daily does  "makewhatis -u -w"
and
	weekly does "makewhatis -w"

Supplying a bogus arguement to makewhatis results in:

Usage: makewhatis [-u] [-v] [-w] [manpath] [-c [catpath]]
       This will build the whatis database for the man pages
       found in manpath and the cat pages found in catpath.
       -u: update database with new pages
       -v: verbose
       -w: use manpath obtained from `man --path`
       [manpath]: man directories (default: /usr/share/man:/usr/man)
       [catpath]: cat directories (default: the first existing
           directory in 
/var/cache/man:/usr/share/man/preformat:/usr/man/preformat:/usr/share/man:/usr/man)


So the weekly run runs makewhatis but doesn't update it.  ???


makewhatis is a bourne shell script.  As far as I can determine, the 
makewhatis database is found at /var/cache/man/whatis.


I wonder if running a "makewhatis -u -w -v" would clear this?

I wouldn't think the existing partitions on the hard drive would matter 
at that point, simply because James is trying to boot from the install 
CD and failing to even get the existing system from the CD to start. 
Wouldn't matter what was on the hard drive, or even if it was formatted, 
because there's a whole system on the CD.

It would be different if James were trying to boot from the CD and 
repair an existing system. For that, you do need to be able to mount the 
root partition off the hard drive. For a simple installation, the 
existing contents of the hard drive are irrelevant.

If you have another way to do it I would remove the 678 router.  I know
historically they're easy to hack / DoS and there's no real need to have
another layer 3 device in front of your firewall.

That said, the 10.0.0.1 network doesn't have to exist anywhere else in your
LAN other than where you have it.  The back side of your Coyote firewall can
point to an internal LAN address of 192.168.0.0 / 24 or whatever.  That's
the beauty of routers : they connect different networks.  In fact, if you
have the front NIC of the coyote box set up for 10.0.0.2 / 24 and the back
side set for 10.0.0.3 / 24, it won't work.  You've assigned two addresses in
the SAME NETWORK to two devices on DIFFERENT physical networks.

Also, you want to be sure that you aren't running NAT on both boxes.  That
would be bad.

Funny you should mention.  I tried firing up WinMX last night for the first
time in a while and I couldn't connect.  This time my firewall wasn't
filtering any of my ports, either...

I have an older 675 cisco DSL modem which was connected to my linux firewall.

The cisco router needs to be in bridging mode so that all it does is provide 
the uplink to the Central Office (CO).  Then you firewall needs the IP 
address that was given you or, if you are on dhcp, it needs that NIC 
configured to get the IP address.  Follow the instructions as if the firewall 
was the Cisco Router.  You will need to configure the router in bridging 
mode.  The 675 comes with the bridging mode default.  Check you manual on how 
to set up the router.  

Then you need to set up a DHCP daemon on your firewall to dole out the IP for 
your lan on your inside NIC.  This may require editing the startup scripts to 
dole out address from a certain NIC.  You may have to add eth1 to the startup 
script in the appropriate place.  That is, if your LAN NIC is eth1 and you 
WAN NIC is eth0.

The point is set you Cisco to bridging mode.
Set your WAN NIC to the IP configuration your ISP has given you.
Set you LAN NIC up to serve IP address and as you gateway to the internet.

Good Luck.

However, www.linux-mandrake.com appears to be out to lunch.

  No, I don't. But, the vmware web site has installation directions for all
permutations of host and guest OS. I had to actually read them tracking down
the bugs in my upgrade from 2.0.4 -> 3.1 -> 3.2. Turned out that the problem
was where Red Hat moved the smb.conf (and related files) between RH 6.2 and
7.3. But, the vmware doc exists.

  What to do? Read the doc, then check their newsgroups (they run their own
server). If you bought a copy from them you get 30 days of installation
support by filing in a form on their web site.

  Good people. Expensive software (relatively speaking), but very good
people.

The virtual hard drive (inside VMWare) is a SCSI disk as far as the OS 
is concerned, and has no relationship whatsoever to the actual hardware 
in your system.

Install a boot loader. You can install it to the MBR or the first sector 
(boot sector) of the partition. In your case, I can't think of any valid 
reasons to not install it in the MBR of the virtual disk. (/dev/sda).

Russ,

When I looked for my video card, it didn't show up.  I have an xtasy which
uses nvidia geforce 2 ti.  I installed an nvidia geforce 2 generic since
there wasn't a geforce2 ti.

I'm a little confused by the virtual nature here.  I also chose not to have
a firewall setup.  I'm basically flying by the seat of my pants here.

Thanks,

Jim

Again, the hardware the software installation inside VMWare sees doesn't 
have anything to do with the hardware actually in your computer.

The video card inside the vmware machine will probably be something 
like, "VMWare virtual video card". It won't use your video card 
directly. There should be a package within VMware that you can install 
that has a better video driver, but it'll still be a VMWare video driver.

I realized this about 10 minutes ago.  After I install everything, then I
need to install vmware tools which will take care of my virtual video card
and xserver, I believe.  They say not to start xserver until after I install
these tools which are specific to RH 7.3.

This virtual world is strange to me.  I live and work in a very physical
world.

Thanks,

Jim

Thanks!

Your info was just what I needed to understand this thing in my head. The 
problem was that I told the Linux firewall that it was going to be 
10.0.0.1, which is the IP that the Cisco router already had. So I had to 
tell the Linux firewall to use 192.168.0.1, which did not conflict with 
the Cisco Router do it worked just fine. I have dhcp running on both the 
Cisco router and Linux firewall. 

BTW: this Coyote Linux is pretty cool, some infomation about it with 
screen shots can be found here:

You don't understand the nature of a virtual machine, NONE of the real
hardware on your computer has anything to do with the hardware in your
virtual machine, you need to think of each VMware virtual machine as
though it is a completely different piece of physical hardware from the
host computer.  A virtual machine has it's own virtual devices which
typically (but not always) behave as though they are one particular
brand/model of real hardware, regardless of what your host computer
uses.  If you look at the VMware documentation, you will find a
description of the hardware that the virtual machine presents to the guest
operating system.  For the SCSI, IDE, and ethernet adapters, they are
standard devices (though I don't remember which ones), for the virtual
display adapter, VMware has done their own implementation and provide
drivers as part of the VMware tools installation once your guest operating
system is up and running.

Just remember that as far as the guest OS is concerned, it's an entirely 
different PC with it's own hardware.

I'm in the same boat... using lopster.

The servers went all wonky about a week and half ago.  What gives?

Okay, I'll look around and see what other kinds of broken junk I have

  Yes, it does. It's in the tools package that needs to be installed after

  Since Albany no longer has its annual Timber Festival I cannot learn more
about log rotating there so I'm asking for help right here. I'm missing
something in understanding how the rotation of logs is controlled, and I'd
like to fill in this blank in my knowledge.

  In /etc/logrotate.d/maillog I have:

/var/log/maillog {
    daily
    rotate 4
    copytruncate
    compress
    size=+1024k
    notifempty
    missingok
    postrotate
        /usr/bin/killall -HUP syslogd
    endscript
}

because I want to watch the mail on a day-to-day basis rather than over a
longer period of time. I _thought_ that putting 'daily' in the log would
cause the log to be rotated daily and deleted after the 4th day (line 2).

  In /etc/cron.daily is the logrotate script:

#!/bin/sh

/usr/sbin/logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf

and, in /etc/logrotate.conf I see global variables, including:

# rotate log files weekly
weekly

# RPM packages drop log rotation information into this directory
include /etc/logrotate.d

  My understanding is that the inclusion of logrotate.d, with the 'daily'
command in maillog overrides the global rotation command of 'weekly' in the
.conf file. In any case, /var/log/maillog is not rotated even weekly, never
mind daily.

  If cron.daily calls logrotate and that reads logrotate.conf, is the daily
script ignoring everything in logrotate.d except for once per week? I seem
to be in an infinite loop here and am not sure where I went wrong, despite
reading the man pages several time.

TIA,

Rich

I am delving into RPM building and in there you can specify the optflags

optflags: i386 -O2 -m486 -fno-strength-reduce
optflags: sparc -O2

Would someone be so kind as to point me to some docs on explaining these? 
At this point, I'd settle for some optflags I can put in my .rpmrc to

I'd have to agree here (if you haven't already resolved the problem).  I have had some bad experiences with Mandrake disk burns in the past (8.0, 8.1, and 8.2)  My suggestion would be to get a good CD-R and burn the image a 1x.  Yes, it will take a long time to burn, but that is the only way I have gotten the Mandrake disks to burn reliably.  Good luck.

The optflags macro is read on a per-platform basis. Rather than trying 
to have a single ~/.rpmrc that works on all your platforms, you might 
consider installing a platform-specific /etc/rpm/macros on each build 
host. On you sparc, for instance, your /etc/rpm/macros could be

%optflags  -O3 -mcpu=v9

(Of course, if your host isn't running an Ultra, you'll want to change 
v9 to v8 or something more appropriate.)

I'm not sure that helps. Does it?

Thanks for all the help, folks! I did get Linux loaded into the
2nd partition of my 2nd disk, but dual-booting won't work with
this set-up. I had to use fdisk set up swap and native Linux
partitions (Disk Druid would allow it) and the RedHat 7.1 install
process took a couple of tries (it locked up just prior to
actually loading files.)

The dual boot did not work I think because I couldn't get LILO to
write a proper boot record into the Linux partition (which starts
at the 21st GB of that 40GB disk.) It kept giving me a warning
that the boot area was not on the first disk, but otherwise
seemed to work. However, when I tried to copy the boot record
into a file with dd, the resulting file would not boot Linux when
used with Win2K's boot loader.

Anyway I can boot Linux from a floppy when I need it, so at least
my first objective (to load Linux without hosing Windows2000) has
been achieved. Someday when I'm smarter I'll tackle the dual-boot
problem again. Setting up a dual boot machine seems very simple
in theory, but in practice there's a lot of variables among the
infinite number of configurations and one needs some genreal
experience to recognize problems.

  that's 'four'.

  I don't think they had a plywood-rolling contest, but they did have log
rolling (rotating) contests. Those who worked the mill ponds herding logs to
the loading chains had to be very nimble on their feet -- and on the logs.

VMware is great!  One project I'm using it for is testing the zebra
routing protocol suite running 4 virtual Linux routers connected
together with 4 virtual network switches.

The virtual routers are built using the bls (bls.sf.net) Linux
distribution.  The tomsrtbt floppy is used to initially boot a virtual
Linux machine and load bls.

Be aware that a tomsrtbt floppy fails to boot a virtual Linux machine
when the host is Windows.  It boots a virtual Linux machine when the
host is Linux and the virtual floppy disk is set to /dev/fd0u1722.

Paul,

Using /etc/rpm/macros would be a good thing, and I'll do that as a next 
step. I'm trying to build RPMs in my home directory as a normal user. I 
did search the archives for recommendations on how to build RPMS as a 
normal user (I thought you sent that to PLUG at one time). I will only 
build for the I86 architecture, but I thought it would be good to have the 
optimizations for i386, i486, etc.

isn't working? Why it's not rotated even weekly?

Have you tried running "logrotate" manually with debugging enabled? It 
won't make any changes to log files but it spits about a bunch of 
information:

logrotate -d /etc/logrotate.conf

The few times I've seen something like this, it wasn't X or the window
manager, but rather some process that was sending alot of display
modification/update requests (in one case a program made the mouse pointer
look like it was on a caffine high, it would just sit there vibrating
:-)  It might not be elegant, but the simplest approach I have found for
this type of problem was to just start "top" in a window, exit out of
everthing I had running, one program at a time and check to see if the
problem went away after exiting each program.  If after this was done it
still had problems, I would start killing anything else that was running
which might have access to the X environment, such as window manager
applets (these are often a source of problems), until the problem went
away, or there was nothing left (so far I have never gotten to the point
that only X was left and the problem was still happening).

Message-ID: <GGEILBHDNBMGHFFFEIGOCEGELGAA.mikel@quantecllc.com>

Hello, pluggers.

I've searched the archives for information on getting 2.4.19 to work with
RAID, specifically the Promise TX2000 PCI RAID controller card.

I've found quite a bit of information on it, but I'm guessing that I'm
missing a step.

The kernel has RAID support compiled in (not a module) and I've seen the
four drives recognized as hde-hdh.
I've installed the raidtools RPM from Mandrake (that's the distro I'm
using).
I've put the append= line into lilo and rerun lilo.

I've also got the Linux ATA RAID HOW-TO and a couple of others, but they
don't seem to help.

Now, I'm stuck.
I *think* that I need to mkfs.ext3 on the disks and then use mktab to mount
them, but I'm not sure. I'm not a big Linux guru type, so I'm kinda iffy.

Anyone else manage to get the Promise RAID card, 2.4.19, and the linux-raid
in general to work?

I'd appreciate pointers, sites, etc.

Thanks in advance,

Tony,

  No, I hadn't tried that. I can manually rotate the maillog, and other
scripts in /etc/cron.daily run properly. I'll give this a whirl.

It sounds to me like you may be confusing hardware RAID with software RAID.

You have a RAID controller card. That's hardware RAID. It doesn't 
require any RAID stuff in the kernel to work, as the RAID array is 
defined in hardware. You only need the module for your controller card 
either as a module or compiled in. Once the RAID is defined in hardware, 
the software (linux kernel in this case) sees the RAID as a single device.

The RAID module is for making a RAID array out of drives on a standard 
EIDE/ATA controller. That's what software RAID is. The kernel would see 
the four drives as individual devices, and then make them a RAID device 
at the software level.

Message-ID: <20020930211831.GA19177@subtend.net>

Ok, so I installed spamassassin with spamd.  Works great.  I have it
setup to only flag the subject and send the email on its way to the
user.  Users then can filter or browse and delete, or do anything they
want with it.  99% of the users are happy with this as they can peruse
their spam for false positives and I can put overrides in the config
file.

Enter idiotic C exec's (specifically CEO).  Has a list of words that he
doesn't event want to hit users INBOX.  Claims some legal liability
(probably bullshit).

I'm curious if spamassassin can let me execute a check for certain
keyworks and funnel those to null, but still mark the rest and forward
on.  I can set it up to delete everything  marked as spam, but users would lose
legitimate mail (which is worse).

This reply came from a co-worker who implemented Promise
RAID a couple of weeks ago.

  Different model controller (mine are FastTrak100 TX2), but likely the same
  issue - they don't make source available, and they have not upgraded
  binaries above the initial kernel (2.4.18-3) shipping with RH 7.3.
  
  These are hardware RAID controllers, so kernel support is not really
  necessary. Linux sees the array/mirror as a single SCSI disk. For some
  versions/models (mine being one) some additional parameters need to be
  provided to the kernel at boot to make it work as advertised.

so you'll need to download the Promise driver from their web site and 
get the 2.4.18-3 kernel sources.

I see this sort of thing in KDE when I go to Yahoo.com sometimes. I get 
a page with a huge online casino ad with lots of flashing crap and 
Konqueror becomes very sluggish to the point where it's nearly 
unusable. Once I go to a different web page the CPU usage drops down 
considerably.

I use spamassassin- I'm calling it from the global procmailrc in /
etc/  ... it works pretty good.
What I'd do in your situation is to use procmail to check the 
body for those words (cusswords like microsoft, verisign?) and 
round file them  without sending them through spamassassin.
Usually I use procmail to check headings but you'd want the 
body checks I think.

Bingo!  The culprit is gkrellm v1.2.12.  I reopened it and it is
behaving normally.

If I have it open when I exit X/wmaker, wmaker will rerun it next time I
run X.  I'll see if it eats CPU when started by wmaker and not manually.

Hmm.. I just remembered that the QMAILQUEUE is overridden to call
qmail-scanner which runs an f-prot and spamassassin check on incoming
email.  Any idea how I can squeeze procmail in the middle?  Most of the
email is not local (processed before sending to <shudder> lotus notes
server).

error looks OK to you?  Best check and see what the duplicate is.
Potentially it says something like "monthly, and just trash the old file"
and is taking precedence over the one you've been tweaking.

Well then, let me bow out of the discussion, because it sounds 
like you've got plenty going on there :) Perhaps some wiser, 
saner head would respond before I suggest copying one or two 
of the spam assassin tests like "body contains "enis enlarg" and 
substituting a local test for "microsoft" ... with an extremely high 
SA score (10000) and then dropping out messages with that 
caliber of score.

You do know theres a spamassassin mail list, right?

I'm not sure why you would use apt to do that, but wget should do what you
want:

wget -m ftp://rufus.w3.org/linux/redhat/8.0/en/os/i386/RedHat/RPMS/

or use an ftp client.

I've used autorpm for this with previous updates. However, I don't know 
if it would work with 8.0.

Make sure to have a backup of your data before trying this. You may end 
up with a non-functional system.

FYI, from the spamassassin FAQ:

Stuff To Note: Legal Issues
Note that there may be legal issues with site-wide spam filtering. For
example, in the UK, it is apparently illegal to hold emails for
examination for longer than 2 days. Also, the MailScanner info page
reckons that under section 3(3) of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers
Act, care must be taken to ensure that no-one other than the sender and
intended recipient of any message can read any part of that message.

A possible way to route around this, is by simply using SpamAssassin in
it's default mode, so that it simply tags the mails with their estimated
status, instead of full mail filtering where you redirect or delete mail
without the user's intervention. This way, the user still has final choice
in what to do; and they can also rest assured that nobody on your staff
has been "reading their mail". However, take this advice with a grain of
salt -- I am not a lawyer, so if you're worried, ask one.

You've probably got an entry to rotate maillog in the syslog file.  The 
default is to include maillog in the syslog rotation.

It is again, probably, a multi file rule/specification like this.

--- /etc/logrotate.d/syslog ---

Rod,

  Yes, there's an entry for /var/log/maillog in the syslog script. And,
there's the maillog script in /etc/logrotate.d, too. Do I take the one out
of syslog? That is the cause of the error message, but why is maillog not
rotating daily?

Thanks very much,

Rich

I'd say remove the syslog reference to /var/log/maillog and see what 
happens.  I haven't had problems with logrotate since I did like you're 
trying to do; separate all the thingy's out.  It could be a file locking 
issue with strange side effects.
  Hey, I just thought about space.  Could you be low on disk space on the 
/var/log partition?

Considering all the standard rules are followed in SA, I should be able
to do this.  SA just gets called differently (by qmail-scanner).  I'll
look more into going down this path. Thanks.

Rich,

Since you're overriding the default "logrotate" setup for your maillog I 
would remove the entry from the syslog file. It may be overriding the 
mailog rotation setup you're trying to put in place and might explain 
why your maillog isn't rotating like you want.

Tony

I have no previous experience to upgrade RH direct from website.

Is it to upgrade direct from ftp server or download the upgrade files to 
hard drive first?  Would it take long time? (I am using broadband

Tony,

  Thanks. I've done this and will report back in the morning on the results.

  It's interesting that maillog rotation ended up in two places. I know that
postfix instructions are to set up one separate script. Probably the one in
syslog is there by default, regardless of whether or not a MTA is installed.

On my SuSE systems a number of log files that reside in /var/log are 
handled by the syslog file. Sounds like it's that way with RedHat as 
well.

Yep, our staff use it daily on multiple RH 7.3 systems.

Yeah, it's a bit sparse in comparison to say, samba, but we found it

The next step is to dd if=<linux boot partition> of=bootsect.lnx bs=512 
count=1.

This gives you your boot sector to load into windows 2000.  Put this file on a 
dos floppy.

Boot <shudder>Windows</shudder> and copy this file to C:/.  The edit boot.ini.  
It is normally read-only so you may have to play with permissions and add the 
following line to the bottom of the file:  C:/bootsect.lnx="Linux"

The next time you boot windows you will have a choice of 
<shudder>Windows</shudder> or <hooray>Linux</hooray>

The RAID controller needs to be supported by the kernel like any SCSI 
controller needs its corresponding driver.  The RAID is not strictly 
controlled by the kernel, but the RAID card is.

Have you tried leaving this stock, i.e. w/ everything commented out? As
per the comments in that file, an empty atalkd.conf works in most cases.
At least it might tell you if that is the problem. We didn't muck with
atalkd.conf in all of my installations, so this is what I'm immediately
looking at.

Funny, I googled on the error message you gave, and both hits I got were
from discussions you've had with people on the netatalk-admins list. :-)

Short answer: dunno...

For what it's worth, here's the RPMs I'm using on my production servers:

these settings on its own rather than trying to hardcode them.

The only time I've needed to add an entry into atalkd.conf was when I tried
to do appletalk routing between two networks. If anyone asks you to do that,
just say no ;-)

Message-ID: <1033452322.1887.4.camel@zontar.clueserver.org>

Unreal Tournament 2003 is currently on the shelves.  What is not
mentioned on the box is that Disc 3 has an installer for Linux!

Be warned...  You will need some serious hardware and disk space for
this game.  Expect to need a fast video card, fast video drivers, a fast
processor (750mhz minimum!), and about 2.5 gigs free.

I am installing it now. More data when I have it running.

Subject: [PLUG] time-based rule
Message-ID: <MEEKKAPIMDJAJLIOBCHCMEIPCAAA.bmdimaculangan@bhpi.com.ph>

hello to all folks,

we have a rule in our company that permits corporate IT departments full use
and access of precious corporate bandwidth for critical mission activities.
As well as key managers and top management may enjoy the same access
benefits.  However, some employees are not included to this kind of benefit.
According to the rule, access to the Internet is made possible only during
noontime break, from 12:00 noon to 1:00 in the afternoon only but corporate
email exchange is available throughout the working day.  My problem is, how
can I apply and implement this rule in our Linux Server. Any idea?


thanks!

Message-ID: <20020925163330.664f3fd9.mike@linuxlink.com>

I am having a heck of a time with imap.  I had pop up and running fine. 
Then I set evolution to check imap mail.  It logs in and acts right just
gets no mail.  Everything I read said it would use /var/spool/mail/user
.   I have mail sitting in there.  The docs also say I do not need any
imaprc but it says to recompile to change features.  Since this is a rpm
for redhat, I would think it was compiled correctly.  

Where does imap look for mail as default in imap-2001.  If not
/var/spool/mail, then should I make a imaprc?  I could also tell postfix
to put the mail somewhere else too if that would better.  Any pointers
would be appreciated.

Thanks ahead.

What is the company?

Subject: [PLUG] Fighting ORDB for 3 days now.....
Message-ID: <1032555940.15627.39.camel@kat.zotnet.com>

I have been fighting ORDB for 3 days straight.  I do not think I have a
confusing setup, but I am lost.

I have a mail server.

It is the local STMP outbound server for a few class C's.
It is the main server inbound for several domains.

I cannot seem to block attacks in the style of:

"marvin at marvin.ordb.org@XXX.ISPREVERSEDNS.com"@MAIL.MYDOMAIN.com
marvin at marvin.ordb.org@[IP.FOR.SERVER.XXX]

I have tried a number of things and now I am likely confused to all
hell.

I am running Mandrake 7.2, postfix-1.1.11-7.mdk7x (built on system)
Postfix has been upgraded, so maybe the main.cf is out of date

It seems like permit_networks is sending an OK, and therefore bypassing
the rest of smtpd_recipient_restrictions.  I have tried moving it
around, but it either blocks me send mail from mynetworks, or allows the
spam tricks on through...

Also do I need check_relay_domains, since I do to relay for anyone (I
accept, process and forward all local domains).


I used to say sendmail was more tricky than postfix, but after the last
three days of painstaking research and testing, I am no longer the sure.

Any help would be appreciated.  Please keep in mind the current setup
below for _restrictions has been changed over 100 times, so repeats and
order oddities are to be expected.

I have read in detail 

http://www.mengwong.com/misc/postfix-uce-guide.txt

How do I write /etc/fstab and /mtab to mount the win98 hdb I've got? It's 
RedHat 7.3 using Grub on hda.
