Subject: [PLUG] civ 4 Beyond the Sword on wine 1.2 on ubuntu 10.04
Message-ID: <AANLkTikDkXsUE3aBxfPWVN3W2No8s4Kr39P=m5XTJeKS@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to get Civ 4 Beyond the Sword on wine 1.2 on ubuntu 10.04 to work.

According to the link

http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=16878

The link above says.......




The following tweaks are unavoidable in order to run the game:

* Install MSXML3 and MSXML4 via Winetricks.
* Disable gameux on winecfg -> Libraries.

I didn't install DX9 via Winetricks since I already have installed the
June 2010 release of DX the regular way. Didn't have any problems at
all.








I believe I did the stuff about MSXML3 and MSXML4 via Winetricks correctly.

I don't know what


           Disable gameux on winecfg -> Libraries.


means.  What am I suppose to do?
I don't know what



I didn't install DX9 via Winetricks since I already have installed the
June 2010 release of DX the regular way. Didn't have any problems at
all.



means.  I didn't install any sort of June 2010 release of DX the
regular.  Am I suppose to do something?

At this point, when I click on the icon for Civ 4 Beyond the Sword,
the game actually starts, i.e. I get to the point where I can choose
single player, multi player, et. al, but everything is really slow.
My system had 2 gig or Ram, and a graphics card with 1 gig of Ram on
it, I think, and             cpu MHz		: 2992.7929

I think my hardware is okay to run the game, but maybe not.  I don't know.

So....if I do what people on this list recommend, will my game be fun,
or slow and crappy?  Civ 4 is the only thing I want, must have, am
utterly addicted to, from the windows world!

Sincerely,
Victor

FWIW, the same warning message comes up for that site in Chrome and IE on
Windows 7, which I happen to be booted into at the moment (though I'm about
to switch back to Ubuntu, promise!!) .  So it's not a Firefox issue.

(Aside:  this is the first time in at least a few months I launched IE --
what an irritating load of messages I had to click through about my defaults
just to bring up a browser!  Grrr...)

Is there a chance that it is NOT a legit site?  That is what the
certificates are to protect against.

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu password wierdness question
Message-ID: <AANLkTinzi95G8yH8_MKtdGoJ5HL0vCsR6HVMD3Sxk3e4@mail.gmail.com>

This morning I killed the gdm (gnome desktop manager) while running
Ubuntu 10.04 lucid and came to the customary CLI login screens
(tty1-tty7)

However when I went to sign in with my password, Ubuntu refused and
kept popping the passwd prompt (up to 5 times then gave an error
message)

This scared me into thinking that the password for myself had been
changed, but later experimentation showed that a strange delay had to
take place before I could actually enter in the correct password and
actually log in.

Anyone know where to look for?  I assume the /etc/pam.d area to start?

Is the machine trying to do a remote validation on the password?

This doesn't seem to happen when logging in under the regular GUI window.

I would like to account for this wierdness.

Do you have login fialures in /var/log/auth.log for the time period?
Have you tried to replicate the behavior by doing a ctrl-alt-f1 and log
into another tty?

I've been running 10.04 for a while now and haven't seen this problem,
logging in at the CLI (ssh and other ttys). However, I haven't tested
doing it after killing gdm.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1012011538390.11627@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   My desktop has been running firefox for years and I've upgraded whenever
Pat puts out a new version. The current version is 3.6.12. When I want to
clear the address box to enter a new URL I place the cursor in the box,
left-click, and press ^u. This has always worked. If I have the cursor in
the display window and press ^u I see the page source code.

   My new laptop is also running firefox-3.6.12 (well, actually,
swiftfox-3.6.12 since this morning), but when I place the cursor in the
address box and press ^u I see the page source code rather than a cleared
widget.

   Looking at about:config and the prefs.js files I cannot find the
difference. My Google searches have been equally unproductive. If anyone has
a clue how to get ^u to clear the address box on the laptop, please let me
know. I'm so used to doing this for years it's a hassle to have to backspace
over each character on that one host.

not a direct answer to the question, but a suggestion for maybe a
better way of doing it. F6 will select the address bar, and then you
just type desired destination to replace the current value.

nathan,

   While not quite as convenient for us touch-typists, that will work.

What?  Press F6 is less convenient than doing a mouse click and ctrl key combo?
Give me an F key over a mouse click any day.

I hope someone can help.

I upgraded to Wine 1.3.8 using synaptic package manager.  I realized
that when I go to Applications menu item, and then wine, then
configure wine, I get a dialog box that says wine configuration with
tabs on it.  One of the tabs say libraries.  So I figure that has
something to do with

Disable gameux on winecfg -> Libraries.

but I don't see anything about gameux.

I still don't know about

I didn't install DX9 via Winetricks since I already have installed the
June 2010 release of DX the regular way. Didn't have any problems at
all.


Is there anyone on this list able to help me?  If no one knows about
these issue, can at least one person say that probably no one on the
list knows.  I just would like the smallest confirmation that someone
is at least taking a cursory glance at my issue.  I was hoping someone
in the Portland Metro area could help, but in case not, I emailed to
appdb at winehq.org.  I hope I am asking for help in an appropriate and
respectful way.

Thank you,

Victor,

People are reading your pleas for help.  Someone with gaming/Wine 
experience will chime in at some point.  We all have different schedules.

Be patient,

Bruce
PS  I have no gaming or Wine experience.

Chris,

   I looked at that but don't see a need for most of them. What I
particularly like about the emacs key bindings is that they're so similar to
the WordStar key bindings I started using in the very early 1980s. Others
may perfer different strokes, but I like being able to configure all my
writing applications to use the same set of key strokes. (Dif'rent strokes
for dif'rent folks, eh?)

   This really gets my undies in a knot when I must use OO.o Writer. My
fingers are so used to moving the cursor using the keyboard in emacs, lyx,
joe, etc. that I'm constantly doing things I don't want to do. For example,
centering the line by pressing ^x instead of moving one word to the right.
This is one of the reasons I avoid OO.o as much as I can.

Thanks again,

Rich

I also love the Civ games, and have Civ4.

But it's been quite a while since I installed it last, so I don't
remember how I did it. Right now is the end of the term, so I'm super
busy. I've got the computer installing Wine, and soon I'll have it
install Civ4. If I run into any problems I can let you know if I'm
able to resolve them. If they get too complicated then they'll have to
wait until after the 10th, when I'll have more time.

Civ4 works better for me under Wine than with Windows. I don't know
why, but it will be fine and then suddenly go super slow - on a
machine with 4 cores and 8 GB ram. This is unpredictable - sometimes
very soon after starting the game and other times quite a while later.

So I can tell you for sure that it does work well, but I might have
had to jump through a couple hoops to make it that way. I can't say
for sure right now.

I'll get back to you once I know more.

Erik

ctrl-L - good to know, i'm in the habit of alt-d for the address bar. 
(and i just start typing, since the text is selected there's no need to 
backspace - but the body-memory is hard to change.)

Subject: [PLUG] Update repositories in Fedora
Message-ID: <20101201235138.1c8253f8@mailhost.pdx.edu>

Back in my Ubuntu days it was simple. All I had to do was open Synaptic
and click on Reload. But now that I'm on Fedora 14 I have to use yum,
and yum is a fickle lady.

Specifically, I'm trying to enable a repo, "updates-testing." I just
want to enable it temporarily to grab a package that will take Fedora
who knows how long to get to the regular updates repo. According to man
yum the command should be "yum --enablerepo=updates-testing." But when
I try that yum just dumps the contents of yum --help. It would be nice
if it would give me at list a hint of what I did wrong.

So after I failed at the command line I tried Yumex. I checked the box
for updates-testing, but couldn't find any button to refresh the
package list. So I shut down Yumex and reloaded it, and when I looked
at the repo list updates-testing was unchecked again. Dammit, I checked
that box to enable that repo and I meant it.

Any suggestions?

Never mind. I didn't realize that I was supposed to add "install
<packagename>" at the end of the line.

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?by

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?John Jason Jordan

? ? Scribus is just a few years old, but has already achieved
? ? most of the features of the expensive commercial desktop
? ? publishing apps, and a few they don't have. If you need to
? ? do fliers, brochures, or whole books, Scribus is now the
? ? preferred tool.

? ? The presentation will start with a brief introduction to
? ? some of the terms of desktop publishing, especially how to
? ? get your computer to produce something that a print shop can
? ? put on a press. This will include matters such as typography,
? ? color management, banding and line screens, transparency,
? ? imposition, and several other issues.

? ? Then we will spend a few minutes on an overview of Scribus,
? ? how it is different from word processors, TeX, and advantages
? ? and disadvantages. ?This will include the basic features of
? ? Scribus, including typographical controls, master pages, render
? ? frames, PDF forms, PDF export options, scripting, collect for
? ? output, and lots more. It will also cover how Scribus is the
? ? end tool in a process that starts with other programs.

? ? Finally we will reproduce the PLUG flier that was created
? ? in Scribus. ?This will be presented on the screen showing
? ? the steps and features of Scribus necessary to produce it.
? ? Each member of the audience will have a paper copy of the
? ? flier to assist in following the process.

After the redirect to https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/scra/scraHome.do I
get good certificates on OSX for Safari and Chrome (both probably using
the built-in OSX security validation), but Firefox screams about it.

Weird... Firefox must come with its own certs.  Firefox is definitely
*not* a "native app" on OSX, so no surprise that it's also broken on
OSX. :)

I was amused to discover that tunnelbroker.net (allegedly, the
hurricane electric ipv6 provider) used a self-signed cert too.

John wants to experiment with directly driving the projector, bypassing

and some adapters, but the signal will be ugly after all the connectors.
A long VGA cable will work better.  If somebody could bring one well

Hi

I am looking into 3G or 4G support in Linux.
There are some netbooks with 3G/4G built in.   There are also USB dongle
solution.   What I am unsure is whether any of them are compatible with a
Linux distro.
Does anyone have experience to share?

Thanks

Mark

i've used a variety of verizon 3g dongles (i don't think there was 4g
at the time) with ubuntu with great success.  when i started doing so
about 2 years ago i had to google the manual setup for pppd (which
found me a great step-by-step blog post with comments on
updates/tweaks that were invaluable), but starting with (i think)
ubuntu 9.4 the thing was just recognized by ubuntu/network manager
without any difficulty.  in my experience, verizon's dongles were good
about not changing chipsets without changing model #, so you can
probably just google the model # and linux to be certain before
buying.  i'd be willing to bet that unless you are using a really
cut-rate provider like cricket, you could even bring your laptop into
a store and play with a dongle before buying to be extra-extra sure.

why get a dongle when you can just tether your phone, though?  at
least with android, if you root your phone, you can get mobile hotspot
service (for you and/or others) even without plugging your phone into
your laptop, and you can get it for free.  (sprint charges $40/mo for
use of the app, but once rooted, there's a free app to do the same
thing) i can't think of a time i wanted to use my laptop when i didn't
also have my phone with me.  i have started carrying the phone's usb
cable along though since mobile hotspot sucks up the juice in the
phone pretty fast, though...

it occurs to me that you could probably get a free android phone from
someone who is upgrading and get just a data plan and make it your
wwan device, if you are trapped in an iphone contract or something.  i
have a friend who does that and takes it one step further with voip
and has his phone off the voice network entirely, despite having a
phone number and receiving voice calls in what feels (as a caller)
normal ways.

usb dongles have worked awesomely in my experience with linux the past
couple years, from wifi to wwan.  (my roommate on the other hand has
had terrible luck with his herd of usb wifi adaptors + ubuntu...so
check the reviews on newegg or somewhere to see if others are
successfully using with linux before buying).  some of the netbooks
with builtins may not work so well, but then, you can google the
netbook model and linux to see results pretty instantly for those,
since they use the same parts in every model..

luck++;

When I was in Vienna last summer, the people I was staying with let me
use their GSM dongle.  The carrier was called "Orange".  I just
plugged it in, NetworkManager noticed it, asked me a few questions,
and *bang* I had tubes.

Hi all,

I'm a linux newbie that has had some success and is pleased with himself!

I went to

http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=10158

to figure out how to get civ 4 to work on my machine.


I initially had trouble figuring the following out which was written
at the above link....





The following tweaks are unavoidable in order to run the game:
* Install MSXML3 and MSXML4 via Winetricks.
* Disable gameux on winecfg -> Libraries.
I didn't install DX9 via Winetricks since I already have installed the
June 2010 release of DX the regular way. Didn't have any problems at
all.





Eventually, after reading a bit of the Wine manual, and just poking
around the wine configuration dialog box, I think I did the above
stuff correctly.  But it was hard and tedious.

The instructions above also said to download any proprietary driver
for your graphics card.  I had never done that before, but I figured
that out too, I think.  That made all the difference in the world!  My
game actually functioned!  I am soooo happy!!!

The instructions also told me to ( with regard to patches for civ 4 )

After successful installation, all patches for the latest versions
need to be installed.



 I did so, but the patches kept saying that they couldn't find an
installation of civ 4 on my machine.  When I did patches in windows, I
just clicked on them, and they worked.  I don't know what it means to
download a patch for the game and install for civ 4 under wine.  When
I had the patched be automatically open by wine, they still didn't
find civ 4, or at least that's what a dialog box said.

So my game actually works!  I am very happy.  But the graphics are a
bit choppy.  Maybe if I correctly install the patches, it will work
better.  Does anyone have an idea how to do that in the wine ubuntu
civ 4 context?

Perhaps I should upgrade my video card.  My video card is more that
what civ 4 needs for specs under windows, but maybe I need a better
card, because civ 4 is on wine, on ubuntu 10.04

My chip is an Intel Pentium 4 CPU 3.00GHz with 2.0GB Ram, and my video
card is an ASUS
V9520-X/TD/128M, I think
http://www.asus.com/product.aspx?P_ID=52j1S51PpXvYOcyz

Does my system have enough oomph, as far as you know, to run wine,
with civ 4 on top of it?  If not, what sort of specs do you recommend
for a future computer that will have ubuntu, wine, civ 4,

Basically, is the best thing that I can do to make my graphics in my
game less choppy, is to get a better graphics card.  Or is what I have
plenty, and my game is just not going to get qualitatively better,
unless I get a better chip, more Ram, in addition to getting a better
graphics card.

But please be aware that the mere fact that I can play the game, has
made me incredibly happy, and while no one on the list has helped me
as of yet, I feel very empowered, and am actually seeking some
positive reenforcement!  Please provide some.  Civ 4 was the one thing
I was aching for from Windows.  Now I got it working, not great, and
it really needs to be qualitatively better, but it is working!!!  So,
maybe I just need a better graphics card.  Is that the next step, or
is it some sort of configuration, or is the next step getting a whole
new better computer?

By the way, writing to the list for help, helped me articulate my
problems, and clarify for myself what I might have to do next.
So...the mere process of writing to the list helped me with my
problem.  Still...please try to answer my above questions.

Sincerely,
super pleased, and the slightest bit smug!!
Victor

I've had great luck with USB dongles, cellphones with USB and cellphones
over Bluetooth, all on Ubuntu with NetworkManager.

I haven't had a chance to test my netbook's built-in AT&T modem yet.
Should be OK, I think it just works like a USB dongle.

Victor,
  Congratulations on getting it to work.  You are right, sometimes just
organizing the details of the problem can help lead to it's solution.
  While I do not have Civ 4, I did look and found
this<http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24310>on WineHQ's site.
It looks like it is a known problem with some of the
patches.  Unfortunately, I am not likely to be of much further help than
this.
  The learning curve for Linux can be steep but it is worth the investment
of time.  Hang in there and I am sure you will get it!
Jason

Thanks for all the reply.

I tested with T-mobile and it works well.   Not with Verizon one though...

perhaps if you shared your model # and errors, someone could help.

verizon has had 2 generations of dongles that worked ok with linux for
me--one only about 10 months old (white and rounded--sorry, that's all
i recall)

Subject: [PLUG] Multiple Internet Links...
Message-ID: <1291614595.2882.33.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

I'm set up via two gateways to route a lan onto the Internet via a DSL
connection.  I'm adding Comcast temporarily to get a feel for the
service and possibly be able to order a month or so of service in case
of DSL outages or need.  I want to route through Comcast on demand.  To
effect this change, I'm thinking of adding a physical nic on each
gateway that will connect to the cable modem.  

First question, how do I set the default gateway properly?  Second
question, how do I set the name servers I want, not Comcast's?  

Do I really need to add another nic or can I alias a second address on
an existing nic and use free ports on my DSL connected ethernet switch
for the cable modem?  I have three open ports on my DSL connected
ethernet switch.  The other five ports respectively go to my two
gateways, my mail server, my DSL modem, and a Netgear FVX 538.
The DSL has a static subnet.

I assume residential Comcast service uses a modem that dynamically
configures the host.  Can I change this to be static?  If not, what
options to I have to work around the Comcast equipment wanting to
dynamically configure all connected hosts?

I'm trying the phone service out as well, what do I need to know about
Comcast's digital phone service?

For starters I am going to use an extra laptop for the Comcast, but I
want to access Comcast through my network ultimately.  I consider
Comcast a more costly Internet connection where the preference should
be the DSL link unless A that link is down or B a host is specifically
set to go through Comcast.

Another thought is to add a nic to each gateway, hook the cable modem
to the FVX 538, and link from the new nic on each gateway to the FVX
538's internal switch.  I think that the FVX 538's dhcp server is 
turned off right now.  At least the dynamic address range should be
limited.  In this scenario of connecting to the FVX 538, I am treating
my DSL gateways as sub gateways.

This is actually a *really* hard thing to do right, I fear.  Linux doesn't do
"link health" detection or anything, so if you have a gateway on the dead
device listed in the routing table it will get used even if a perfectly good
second path exists.

So, you actually need something on your router to sit there, keep an eye on
the state of the connection, and update the routing table.

You should be able to configure all the devices into the same internal range,
and use the gateway server(s) to manage that appropriately.  You certainly can
run different network ranges as well, though that can sometimes require
additional work to make routing do the right thing.


Anyway, the basic list of things to do looks something like this:

1. Hook up both Internet routers so they can talk (somehow) to the gateways.
2. Configure the gateways so they can talk through those routers to the
   Internet successfully.
   - you may need to adjust the preferred source address on the link
   - you may need to do some source routing
3. Get both upstreams working when you route through the gateways
4. Configure something to monitor the two Internet services and verify they
   are working correctly
5. Have whatever monitors the service bring up and down the relevant routes
   when the service is healthy or dead.
   - since you want preferential routing, just assign the appropriate metric
     to them as default routes and it will all just work(tm) routing-wise.


With regards the question of using the right DNS servers: turn off the DHCP
services on all the Internet router devices (cable and DSL), I would suggest,
and then run DNS and DHCP service on your gateways.

That way you can supply your local resolver to client machines, configure
whatever forwarders you want, and be happily in control of the whole thing.


All of which should be reasonable straight-forward, but much of it will not
exactly be simple.

Regards,
        Daniel

Hello there,

 : Linux doesn't do "link health" detection or anything, so if you

 : will get used even if a perfectly good second path exists.

Strictly speaking, Linux can do link-layer gateway health detection, 
but that still falls short of link-health detection (in the sense of 
checking the up/down status of a physical/logical Internet link).

If you are using multipath routes and one of your gateways is dead, 
Linux is clever enough not to use that route.  On the other hand, 
if the nexthop beyond one of your gateways is dead, you are out of 
luck.

So, practically speaking, Daniel is correct.

 : So, you actually need something on your router to sit there, keep 
 : an eye on the state of the connection, and update the routing 
 : table.

Yes--this is the usual solution, where somebody writes a little 
utility to initiate a ping to a known, expected-responding 
destination out a particular interface, and then takes some action 
if the destination stops responding and then another action once the 
destination resumes responding.  Fragile, but usually viable.

Yes, certainly, this is probably most easily accomplished using a 
privately addressed network (RFC 1918) for your internal network 
and, employing NAT (that omnipresent small evil).

 : Anyway, the basic list of things to do looks something like this:

N.B.  Let's assume that Michael Robinson has two providers, OpusNet 
      and Comcast.  If packets with a source address of OpusNet end 
      up hitting Comcast resolvers, Comcast has no obligation to
      return replies.  Also, either provider could (quite 
      legitimately) drop packets arriving from customer equipment
      that purport to be from the other provider's network.  This
      sort of filtering is often called BCP38 [0].

In short, if you would like to be using resolvers which could work 
on both providers, then you may wish to consider an open resolver 
(sometimes called public resolvers).  There are a variety to choose 
from:  OpenDNS, Google, DynDNS, Scrubit, and the old GTEI (now 
Level3) IPs.  There are quite a few others I didn't list.  The point 
is that you can use one of these if you want, or run your own 
resolver.

 : All of which should be reasonable straight-forward, but much of 
 : it will not exactly be simple.

I would certainly agree that running a network with multiple uplinsk 
is not exactly simple.  Getting everything running correctly can be 
a bit of a hassle.

OK, so I wrote this quite some time ago and haven't revisited it in 
several years, however, the kernel still supports all of the same 
functionality, and bulk of this is a description of the tools and 
behaviour of Linux when used in the fashion you are trying to use 
it.  It should still be useful:

  http://linux-ip.net/html/adv-multi-internet.html

Points to be aware of as you undertake this effort:

  * Yes, you can use a single NIC and put multiple IPs on that NIC, 
    however, this is more complicated than using a dedicated NIC for 
    each interface (1 for internal, 1 for provider A and 1 for 
    provider B).

  * If using fewer than 3 interfaces, be aware of ARP issues [1].

  * If you do not already know them, learn these commands well:
    tcpdump, ip route, ip rule, arp.

  * Learn how to use ping to send packets from an IP or interface of
    your choice.  This is good for testing the routing on your box
    which is performing the fancy routing.

  * If you are using multiple routing tables [1] (and you will 
    probably need to), DO NOT forget to account for the return 
    packets.  Routing the packet out of your internal network
    is the first hurdle.  Routing the returning packet is a separate 
    issue.

Anyway, good luck as you embark on this little adventure,

-Martin

 [2] Yes, Linux supports multiple routing tables since the 2.2 
     series of kernels.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1012061740150.29102@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I had not tested printing since upgrading the new hardware to
Slackware-13.1 and fixing all the other issues. Now I need to quickly get
printing working again. I could not print A/P checks from Ledger123 this
morning and just now failed to print a 144-page document from acroread.

   Opening http://localhost:631 in firefox shows no jobs in the print queue.
I re-initialized my HP LaserJet 5 for both double-side (duplex) printing
(printer name laser5_duplex) and single-side (simplex) printing (printer
name laser5_single). Both were defined in the cups list as using cups and
gutenprint (since they're the same physical printer), and printing test
pages from both definitions was successful. The printer is a network node
via a JetDirect card and the connection is socket://lj5:9100/. This has
worked for years.

   In acroread the 144 page document took a long time to rasterize, but the
application finally showed it 'printing' all 144 pages, and the message box
closed. The printer status display continued to show "READY" and never
transissioned to "PROCESSING JOB" and actually printed the job. After the
acroread print box closed I checked the cups admin page and there are no
pending jobs shown.

   Where do I start looking for the source of this problem?

TIA,

Rich

Opus has a web based mail interface, but it isn't very stable if you

with Opus while I'm having trouble with my servers.  Otherwise, I use
my own mail server.  I also use an opus email account as the off domain

Message-ID: <20101207002308.33d0b0d0@mailhost.pdx.edu>

So I'm just sitting here writing in OOo on my Fedora 14 x86_64 laptop
and suddenly everything is running really slow. I have a CPU monitor in
my Gnome panel and it is jumping up to the max, but not permanently.

In the past I have had this happen sometimes when a Java something or
another in Firefox would consume all CPU activity for a long time.
Usually I just go into System Monitor, find the Java app, and kill it.
But this time I couldn't even get System Monitor to open. 

And then I noticed the hard disk light was running solid. Something was
doing a lot of writing to or reading from the disk, and it wasn't me. I
managed to close all running applications, but the disk activity
continued. I watched it nervously for about 20 minutes, and then finally
it stopped and things returned to normal. Just as it stopped ABRT
popped up a message that disappeared too fast to read in full, but it
said something about the error file was too big.

As it turns out by coincidence earlier today I had used Disk Usage
Analyzer to see how much of my 320 GB hard disk was used up. I remember
that it was 78%. After the frenetic disk activity I looked again, and
now it is 81% used up. Something has written about 9 GB to my hard
disk, probably some kind of error log.

I'd like to know what it is, i.e., what crashed and why. I'd also like
to delete it, since I doubt I need it. Of course, it might not be just
one file. I used ls to locate the most recent files with -t, but it's
not locating the file(s), nor is the -S parameter. I could use some
suggestions for how to sleuth out what happened.

$ find / -mtime -1

will list the files with a modification timestamp in the last 24
hours, -mmin does the same thing except in units of minutes instead of
days.  If the argument is negative, it means to match things "less

The next time something like this happens, try running top.  You may

   I'd appreciate having someone send me the permissions and owners.groups

Perhaps the permissions here are incorrect and that's why I cannot get jobs

It gave me many dozens of pages (windows) of files. I need to combine
it somehow so it shows only files of a certain size or larger. I tried
man find earlier, but it's too much and hard to follow.

This isn't tested

If I run it as jjj it just gives me "permission denied" on every
folder. As root it appears to run, but the hard disk light never comes
on, making it look like it is hung:

# find / -type f -mtime -1 -exec ls -l '{}' \; | sort -k 5nr | head 
find: `/home/jjj/.gvfs': Permission denied
^C
# 

Actually, there are probably few files that approach the size I am
looking for, regardless of the time stamp. 

<Later>

OK, I nailed it. First I did "find -size +1G." This gave me a bunch of
Virtualbox files (which I expected), but at the very top of the list
was a coredump file in the abrt folder:

[root at Devil8 /]# find -size +1G
<snipped irrelevant files>
./var/spool/abrt/ccpp-1291706342-2244/coredump

Then, navigating to that folder:

[root at Devil8 ccpp-1291706342-2244]# ls -la
total 8389624
<snipped a bunch of small files>
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 8608116736 Dec  6 23:43 coredump

I guess the numbers in there mean it is about 8.6 GB. And it was ABRT
that popped up a message when the disk activity stopped that some file
was too large. So that file is undoubtedly what I was looking for.

I haven't deleted it yet because I want to know if there is a way to
peer inside it to get information about what caused it to be created.

Dear John, 

I've uninstalled abrt for similar reasons on my RHEL 6 system. It's the
"automatic bug reporting tool," which I suspect is buggy (irony), but
haven't researched it.

Thanks,

   I now understand what is preventing printing from my server/workstation,
but not why or where.

   On my laptop I defined the HP LaserJet 5 with connection
socket://lj5:9100. I can send jobs to the printer from this host.

   On my desktop (the server/workstation), the same printer is defined with
the same connection, but attempts to print (at least from the command line
which lets me see the error messages) fail because it cannot connect to
localhost. 'localhost' is not part of the connection nor is it in any
/etc/cups/*.conf file. I've no idea where cups is picking that up, but it's
not been an issue before and is obviously not an issue when printing from
the laptop.

   Ideas wanted.

I haven't been paying attention to this thread. Did you say the printer
was on the ethernet? If not, how is it physically connected?

I have a LJ4+ with ethernet. To connect to it (Gnome desktop) I just
open System > Administration > Printing, right click on the icon for it
and select Properties. In the Properties dialog box the connection is
displayed with a "Change" button next to it. Clicking on the Change
button brings up another dialog box where I can tell CUPS to search for
it. As long as it is turned on CUPS finds it and automatically connects
to it by "socket://192.168.0.15:9100." CUPS came up with that address
so I didn't have to figure out anything. I did the same thing for my
several other networked printers and they always just work.

When you defined "socket://lj5:9100," how did you do it? Did you get
that address by asking CUPS to find the printer? Or did you somehow
create "lj5" yourself and define it manually?

A long time ago I had printers connected via LPT1 on individual
computers. To print to a printer that was connected to a different
computer, that other computer had to have the printer shared so other
computers could print to it through the computer it was attached to.

I'm far from a CUPS expert, but I have learned a lot about CUPS in the
school of "poke at it until it works." Swearing also helps. But it has
to be genuine blue-air swearing. If you're just muttering under your
breath CUPS will continue to be a brat.

Not sure I can help, but I throw in a couple of thoughts ...
    How did you configure the printer to begin with?
       through some GUI configuration tool?
       through the command line interface (cli)?
       just let CUPS find it and then try to use it?
       or something else?
    I used to always use cli, but I have been using GUI for years now, 
and I find (at least on my systems), that
       the newer HP printers and all-in-ones do really well under the HP 
Device Manager, using "HP jet Direct" as a connection type
       the older HP printers do better without the HP Device Manager, 
using "TCP/IP Host IP" as a connection type
          in either case, I configure them as "network" printers ... but 
then they are network printers, each with their own IP and Ethernet cable.
    I used to put the printer IP's in the /etc/hosts file, and use the 
name assigned there when configuring the printer ... now i just put the 
IP in the printer configuration.
       of course, if I had to configure a lot of printers again, I'd 
probably go back to using the /etc/hosts file again.
Does any of the help?
Regards
Fred James

Thanks for the pointer, that was a very interesting series of blogs. I did
some of the experiments he suggested changing buffer sizes. You can see some
pretty dramatic effects.
Who would have thought that increasing buffer size to decrease packet loss
actually increases packet loss and causes TCP to miscalculate RTT.

Bill

How do your machines resolve the 'lj5' part of that address? /etc/hosts or 
something else?

Hey, David!

   Should be via /etc/hosts.

   Regardless, found the problem and fixed it.

   I removed the softlink of /usr/bin/lpr from /usr/bin/lprng and pointed it
at /usr/bin/lpr-cups. (Did the same with lpq, too.) That's what it took.
Whew!

Don't be such a stranger here,

The experiments are described here
http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/11/29/home-router-puzzle-piece-one-fun-with-your-switch/#more-136

I have a desktop and a laptop connected via ethernet to my home router. The
experiment is to simulate a big transfer from one to the other and during
the transfer you watch the output of ping. First I initialize a server on
the laptop using nttcp -i then create the load from the client on the
desktop using nttcp -t -D -n2048000 192.168.1.4 & ping -n  192.168.1.4

There are two sequences  shown here.

The first sequence uses what was my default buffer size  txqueuelen 1000
Notice how the ping time gets much  worse but not linearly.
Then I change to txqueuelen 0 and the ping time stays small and steady.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1012080719470.8944@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   This morning the Toshiba running xubuntu-10.10 with wicd replacing
NetworkManager did not want to see the wireless network(s) when 'wicd-client
-n' was run. The window status bar displaed that it was connected to the
wired network when it wasn't.

   I finally got this all straightened out (by commenting out the ethernet
portion of /etc/networking/interfaces) and rebooting a couple of times, but
I'm curious what might have caused this behavior.

   My Google search for wicd troubleshooting found a no-longer-active Web
forum but that provided no insights.

   Has anyone here any relevant experience with wicd suddenly deciding to not
work?

Subject: [PLUG] ddclient strangeness
Message-ID: <4D000AC6.70606@frankhunt.com>

Anyone using zoneedit.com and ddclient?  Even better if with a Linksys 
WRT54G router.  ddclient runs every 5 minutes to check the router to see 
if the IP has changed.  That's all good, but it returns a long email 
message to root every time it runs.  The message contains html code and 
looks like what one would see when using the web interface to the 
router.  This is a recent change in behavior as far as I can tell.  I 
can eliminate the error by removing mail=root from the config file but 
that will probably cause me to miss meaningful messages.

Looking for ideas here . . .

I know that zoneedit.com recently updated its web site. Did its 
ddclient interface change as well?

The website update included changing the server that ddclient points 
to.  That was the first major hassle because they didn't say anything 
about it until I started getting errors.  That's fixed but now I am 
getting all the html code.  ddclient is a generic daemon for dynamic dns 
so whatever zoneedit did shouldn't impact that.

Subject: [PLUG] Programs won't launch after going back to nouveau driver
Message-ID: <20101208175919.19d2a2db@mailhost.pdx.edu>

Without going into the details of an incredibly long trek, about a
month ago I installed the proprietary nVidia driver on my laptop. The
laptop runs Fedora 14 x86_64 and has the nVidia NVS 140M graphics chip.
Later I uninstalled the nVidia driver and went back to the nouveau
driver. I am happy with the nouveau driver and do not want to go back
to the proprietary driver.

The other day I discovered that System Monitor (ksysguard) would not
launch. The Gnome system monitor still launches, so it's not a big
deal. As far as I know, ksysguard came with the KDE desktop, which I
installed as an alternative to boot to in case some day I mess up Gnome
and can't get the desktop to come up. Normally I use Gnome. From the
command line I get:

$ ksysguard
ksysguard: error while loading shared libraries:
	libnvidia-tls.so.260.19.21: cannot open shared object file: No
	such file or directory

So today I launched Fontmatrix and discovered the same problem:

$ fontmatrix
fontmatrix: error while loading shared libraries:
	libnvidia-tls.so.260.19.21: cannot open shared object file: No
	such file or directory

As far as I know, the libnvidia-tls.so.260.19.21 file was installed by
the proprietary nVidia driver. At least, the "260.19.21" is the version
number that I installed after downloading it from nvidia.com.

Naturally I tried reinstalling Ksysguard and Fontmatrix, but no joy.
Also, I don't know where Ksysguard keeps its configurations, but
Fontmatrix keeps its configurations in ~/.Fontmatrix. I renamed
the .Fontmatrix folder, but still get the same error. In other words,
the problem is not in the config files.

As far as I know these are the only apps affected, but I have a lot of
apps installed and who knows what I will discover later. According to
Google someone has a similar problem with Google Earth, but I don't use
Google Earth, so I can't confirm that. The only other hits that Google
came up with are my posts about this on the Fedora forums, which have
had no response.

I am at a loss to figure out why installing the nVidia driver should
affect these two applications or how it managed to do so. They were
both running fine with the nouveau driver before I installed the nVidia
driver.

Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions?

Message-ID: <20101208195814.d7c6i7ln4ckkcs8w@web.robinson-west.com>

The advanced tab seems to be password locked and apparently I wasn't  
given the password.  Question is, how do I get around the fact the the  
cable modem wants
to set a global ip address on the host via dhcp?  This clearly would  
mess up my Linux based routers.  In Linux, can I limit what dhcp from  
the cable modem can change?  I want to set a default route in say the  
Comcast routing table based on what the cable modem tells me instead  
of setting this route in the default routing table.  Is there a  
modified dhcp client that works with this cable modem which will use  
the information the modem provides and apply it appropriately?

Not that I'm aware of. Comcast gear is basically bridge Michael. So you'll
have to set up a box as a router at the iface that the Comcast router plugs
into.

Subject: [PLUG] Hot computer
Message-ID: <20101208210700.105fd379@mailhost.pdx.edu>

For the past several days my Thinkpad T61 has felt hot. And I have two
CPU monitors in the Gnome panel, one for CPU0 and the other for CPU1,
and they have both been running close to the max all the time.

I tried Gnome System Monitor, but it shows nothing taking more than a
few percent of the CPU. When I run top it shows top as taking 95-100%
of the CPU (strange), but nothing else is ever more than 10%.

The CPUs running at close to the max all the time continues even if I
reboot and log in, but do not launch any apps at all.

According to Gnome System Monitor I have:
	Memory:		3.8 GiggleBits
	Processor 0:	Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU T7300 @ 2.00GHz
	Processor 1:	Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU T7300 @ 2.00GHz

The two CPU monitors in the Gnome panel allow me to set each CPU
independently as to:
	2.00 GHz
	1.60 GHz
	1.20 GHz
	800 MHz
	On Demand
	Performance

By setting CPU0 to On Demand and CPU1 to 800 MHz the computer has
cooled down. However, performance has suffered a bit.

I doubt that it has anything to do with dust and such things because
it started suddenly just a few days ago. Moreover, I never saw the CPU
monitors running as fast as they have been lately.

Something is eating my CPUs, but top and the GUI are lying to me. I
need suggestions for other ways to find the culprit.

It could still be a problem with your video drivers. Video chips can heat up
things quite quickly and if you have it  running a laptop monitor and an
external monitor it will heat up even quicker. Does it still think you have
an external monitor for some reason?

So what do I need to know?  Can I add a nic to my statically configured
gateway and plug the comcast modem into it or am I stuck putting a
router appliance inbetween my Linux router and the cable modem?  The
problem is, if /etc/resolv.conf gets changed that messes things up.
I also don't want the default route in the default routing table to
change.  Unless...  What if I create a separate routing table for
each Internet connection and mark all packets that are outbound so that
it doesn't matter what the default Internet route in the default routing
table is?  I still have the issue of protecting /etc/resolv.conf though.

you can add a file that will be used via the dhclient process
dhclient.conf or on some systems dhclient.<interface>

In that file you add names domain and can either prepend or append.
http://linux.about.com/od/commands/l/blcmdl5_dhclien.htm
or use your friendly man page
man dhclient.conf

I installed powertop, but the features don't work. For example, it says
to disable the unused wireless with "ifconfig wlan0 down," so I do so,
tell powertop to refresh, and it still says to disable unused wireless.
Ditto for all its other recommendations.

That sounds suspicious. I don't recall exactly when the hot computer
syndrome first appeared, but it was after my presentation on December
2. However, both the GUI and xrandr tell me that the only monitor is
the laptop monitor.

At the moment I have both CPUs throttled to 800 MHz with the Gnome
panel widgets. But Gnome System Manager says one is running at 100% and
the other at 80%. Yet the computer remains cool. And top says that top
is taking 95-100% and everything else is taking a total of not more
than 10%. Who is lying?

Note to other comments:

It can't be dust bunnies or a failing fan because neither would cause
the CPUs to run at close to the max all the time. The only thing that
can make the CPUs run intensively is a running process.

I suspect that you have some X drivers left over from the nVidia
installation.  It's quite possible that your apps are calling one
of these X libraries, which in turn is looking for the nVidia
library, which isn't there anymore.  The trick is to re-install
the Fedora libraries.  I don't remember which ones they are, but
it's easy enough to simply re-install X.  It'll take a little
time, but it works, and you'll know that everything is up to date.
Run the following commands as root and (assuming this is your
problem) you should be okay:

# yum reinstall xorg-x11-\*
# setsebool -P allow_execstack 0

The first re-installs X11, and is the key.  The second is for
systems running SELinux, which includes Fedora.  It closes a
security hole that nVidia opens.

Hope this helps!

There are apparently special issues w/r/t Thinkpad fans and Linux, ref
http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/How_to_control_fan_speed 
http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Installing_Ubuntu_10.04_%28Lucid_Lynx%
29_on_a_ThinkPad_Z61m 

If I understand correctly, there were problems with fan control on older
thinkpads, which led to fans being reset to run too fast, leading to
noise complaints about fans on some Ubuntu installations on T series
laptops.

On Ubuntu, there are some fan control packages associated with
Thinkpads. I found them with the following command:

apt-cache search thinkpad 

This is just from memory, as I'm a bit intense within RHEL 6 at the
moment.

Thanks,
Mike

Thanks for the suggestion.

First I closed all running apps, then went to a command line with
Ctrl-Alt-F2. I switched to root and then did "init 3" to stop X. And
then I executed the command above to reinstall xorg. It was scary (57
packages), but it executed without error. Then I did "init 5" and
logged in again as jjj.

Fontmatrix and ksysguard still won't launch and from the command line
give the same error as before.

I just don't understand how installing the nVidia driver could have
altered those two applications so they now require the nVidia driver.
The nVidia driver could not actually alter the apps themselves, because
I have uninstalled and reinstalled them without any change. But the
nVidia driver installation must have changed some configuration file
that those two apps are using. And those are the only two apps that are
affected (so far as I know).

# setsebool pP allow_execstack 0
setsebool:  SELinux is disabled.

I have never messed with SELinux. If it is disabled it was not me who
disabled it.

Is the libnvidia-tls.so file still on the filesystem?
$ locate libnvidia-tls
$ ls {/lib,/lib64,/usr{/lib,/lib64,/local{/lib,/lib64}}}/libnvidia-tls*

What shared libraries are you applications trying to link against?
$ ldd $(which ksysguard)
$ ldd $(which fontmatrix)

You should see at least one line with "... => not found" in the output from ldd.

I know this is for Ubuntu, but the generalities are probably relevant:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/NvidiaDriverSwitching#Problem:%20%20Swapping%20drive%20between%20system%20with%20-nvidia%20and%20non-nvidia%20causes%20breakage

NVIDIA overwrites the system's libGL. nvidia-tls "provides thread
local storage support for the NVIDIA OpenGL libraries (libGL,
libnvidia-glcore, and libglx)" [1] I'd guess you still have the
NVIDIA-installed libGL. Applications that link to libGL throw up
because nvidia-tls is gone, but the NVIDIA libGL remains, maybe? Or at
least the apps are still linked to the old libGL.

Can you try:
yum reinstall mesa-libGL
ldconfig

$ ldd $(which ksysguard)
	<snipped a couple pages of stuff>
	libnvidia-tls.so.260.19.21 => not found
	libnvidia-glcore.so.260.19.21 => not found

	<snipped more stuff>
	libnvidia-tls.so.260.19.21 => not found
	libnvidia-glcore.so.260.19.21 => not found

And apparently root used to have the file:

[root at Devil8 /]# locate libnvidia-tls
/root/.local/share/Trash/files/libnvidia-tls.so.260.19.21
/root/.local/share/Trash/info/libnvidia-tls.so.260.19.21.trashinfo

[root at Devil8 /]# locate libnvidia-glcore
/root/.local/share/Trash/files/libnvidia-glcore.so.260.19.21
/root/.local/share/Trash/info/libnvidia-glcore.so.260.19.21.trashinfo

But evidently no more:

[root at Devil8 /]# find libnvidia-tls
find: `libnvidia-tls': No such file or directory
[root at Devil8 /]# find libnvidia-glcore
find: `libnvidia-glcore': No such file or directory

But I probably do have the files on backup media.

The nVidia driver installation must have overwritten a file that these
apps (and just these two apps) are looking at in order to find the
right libraries.

Both commands executed without error, but still no joy. 

Perhaps it's not the mesa-libGL package?

The network seems fine; no change.

I installed and ran:

chrootkit
rkhunter
unhide

They all reported nothing, except "unhide sys" found a long list of
hidden processes. "Aha!" I thought. So I checked them with top (maximum
20 at a time). All looked perfectly normal and only two or three were
consuming any CPU% at all, and they were taking only 1-3%. The only
oddity was that several had more than one instance of the process
running, and one (console-kit-dae) had around 60 instances running. But
none of them were taking any CPU or RAM.

I tried to figure out from man top how to tell top just to give me an
interactive CPU graph or statistics. I think the GUI (Gnome System
Monitor) is lying.

Try running the following to get a dependency list.  It's unlikely
that fontmatrix is referencing libnvidia-tls directly.  This should at
least tell you which library is referencing your missing file.

$ ldd -v $(which ksysguard)
$ ldd -v $(which fontmatrix)

If you can't find it in the list or it's listed under the executable
itself, then it might be because 'prelink'
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelink) needs to get re-run.  Prelink
rewrites library dependency information in the executable itself to
speed up loading but I'm not exactly sure how it works behind the
scenes; not sure how it handles loading libraries or finding when
something gets deleted.  It's normally run on *nix systems via a
system cron, but if you've got cron disabled or it only runs once a
week, then it might be partially responsible.

I ran "ldd -v $(which fontmatrix) > ~/ldd_fontmatrix.txt. Then I opened
up the text file and searched on nvidia. All I found were the same two
lines as before:

 ? ? ?libnvidia-tls.so.260.19.21 => not found
 ? ? ?libnvidia-glcore.so.260.19.21 => not found

At the end there were several pages of stuff like this:

	Version information:
	/usr/bin/fontmatrix:
		libgcc_s.so.1 (GCC_3.0) => /lib64/libgcc_s.so.1
		libm.so.6 (GLIBC_2.2.5) => /lib64/libm.so.6
		libc.so.6 (GLIBC_2.4) => /lib64/libc.so.6
		libc.so.6 (GLIBC_2.3.4) => /lib64/libc.so.6
		libc.so.6 (GLIBC_2.2.5) => /lib64/libc.so.6
		libstdc++.so.6 (GLIBCXX_3.4.9)
=> /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so.6 (GLIBCXX_3.4.11)
=> /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so.6 (GLIBCXX_3.4)
=> /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so.6 (CXXABI_1.3)
=> /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6

But this section contained no reference to nVidia.

If I run prelink I get:

[root at Devil8 jjj]# prelink /usr/bin/fontmatrix
prelink: /usr/bin/fontmatrix: Could not find one of the dependencies

I tried reading the man page for prelink, but couldn't follow most of
it.

Meantime two days ago I joined the fontmatrix e-list and posted a
query. So for no response. In fact, no mail on that list at all. And
just now I filed a bug report against Fontmatrix, but we'll have to
wait and see if anyone notices it.

I believe in an earlier email you suggested that you experimented a
little with powertop but did not specify whether you understood any of
its output; it might be time to revisit the program.

Beyond a 'top'-like interface, powertop can show a summary of data
collected over a period of time with the '-d' option.  You should be
able to get a list of processes that are waking up the CPU most often,
what percentage of the time the CPU is at each frequency and the
percentage the CPU is in a given state.  While a program might not be
using 100% of the CPU, it might be interrupting the CPU often enough
to prevent it from sleeping.  Try running powertop for a full 60
seconds with the following command:
$ powertop -d -t 60

Information about processor states can be found at:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Configuration_and_Power_Interface#Processor_states

Here's a partial dump from my laptop:

Collecting data for 15 seconds

Cn	          Avg residency
C0 (cpu running)        ( 3.7%)
polling		  0.0ms ( 0.0%)
C1 mwait	  0.0ms ( 0.0%)
C2 mwait	  0.3ms ( 0.9%)
C4 mwait	  3.2ms (95.4%)
P-states (frequencies)
  2.51 Ghz     0.1%
  2.50 Ghz     0.0%
  2.00 Ghz     0.0%
  1.60 Ghz     0.0%
   800 Mhz    99.9%
Wakeups-from-idle per second : 330.7	interval: 15.0s
no ACPI power usage estimate available
Top causes for wakeups:
  32.0% (127.8)     <kernel core> : hrtimer_start_range_ns (tick_sched_timer)
  26.6% (106.2)      npviewer.bin : hrtimer_start_range_ns (hrtimer_wakeup)
  13.2% ( 52.7)       <interrupt> : extra timer interrupt
...


In the above example, the npviewer.bin (a wrapper around the flash
plugin) is a major offender; It's only consuming 2-3% of CPU but it's
responsible for 26% of wakeups.  What's nice is that it also break out
which parts of the kernel are waking up the CPU which top/'gnome
system monitor' doesn't seem to do.  If you're not sure what your
results mean, feel free to paste it back to the list.  If powertop
really has nothing useful then, as others have started to question, it
might be hardware and/or fan control.

Odd.  Might be related to prelink still as I'm not sure how prelinking
affects the output of ldd.

Assuming Fedora 14, which you mentioned in your original post...

The 'prelink' cron script that normally gets run can be found in the
/etc/cron.daily/ directory.  You should be able to run it directly
with:
$ /etc/cron.daily/prelink


If that doesn't work, let's try to figure out what references the
library the hard way.  The following commands list out the names of
any libraries or executables that mention 'libnvidia-tls' (this will
take a while).
$ grep -lr 'libnvidia-tls' {,/usr,/usr/local}{/lib,/lib64}/
$ grep -lr 'libnvidia-tls' {,/usr,/usr/local}{/bin,/sbin}/

It ran for a while, then stopped without any error messages. But
Fontmatrix still gives the same error message.

The sbin command returned nothing, other than a dozen "no such address
or device" messages. But the lib64 command (in addition to a couple
dozen similar error messages), gave the following:

/usr/lib64/libcucul.so.0.99.17

/usr/lib64/libGLEW.so.1.5.5

The first thing I noticed was cinepaint. I tried launching it and
discovered that it won't launch either. However, the error message is
somewhat different:

cinepaint
Locale found in /usr/share/locale
No protocol specified
(cinepaint:6193): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display: :0.0

I reinstalled it with yum, but it continues to give the same error
message.

The second thing I noticed is 

/usr/lib64/libkdeinit4_ksysguard.so

Recall that ksysguard was my other app that won't launch and gives the
same error message as Fontmatrix.

I suppose the next thing to do is look through the list of dependencies
for Fontmatrix and cross-reference to the above list.

I ran the above command, and it gave me some information that would
probably be useful if I fully understood what it is saying. 

However, I resolved the problem. I rebooted the computer and it is now
acting as it always did before. The sad thing is that now I have no way
to figure out what caused the problem. But having said that, I now have
a major suspicion. I recall that I had used a USB drive a few times to
move a file to my desktop. (Yes, they're networked, but telling them to
accept each other is more work than just plugging a USB stick in and
pulling it out.) After finishing with the USB stick Nautilus kept
showing it in the Places menu, even though it was unmounted and
physically removed. I tried several things to get rid of it, but even
root was told he didn't have permission. I think there was something
messed up with the USB port, especially as it is gone now that I have
rebooted.

It is true that Firefox is a hog, and flash even worse. 

Here is what I get when I run it now:

Top causes for wakeups:
  23.4% (129.9)   [extra timer interrupt]
  20.6% (114.1)   [kernel scheduler] Load balancing tick
  19.5% (108.3)   npviewer.bin
  18.0% ( 99.9)   firefox
   5.2% ( 29.0)   [eth0] <interrupt>
   5.1% ( 28.1)   ktorrent
   2.8% ( 15.5)   [ata_piix] <interrupt>

Everything else was under 1%. 

I wonder what the "extra timer interrupt" is doing. The computer is
running normally now, but if I can tweak something to improve
performance, why not?

I'm guessing that when the Nvidia drivers were installed, their own
versions of shared libraries (i.e. libGL.so.260.19.21) were installed
into the /usr/lib64 directory and some symlinks were updated to point
to their version (i.e. libGL.so.1 -> libGL.so.260.19.21).  I'm also
guessing that distro provided version of each shared library is still
in that directory (i.e. libGL.so.1.2).  When the Nvidia drivers were
uninstalled, the symlinks weren't switched back.  We can verify this
by running the following:
$ ls -l /usr/lib64/libGL*.so*
$ for i in $(ls -d /usr/lib64/libGL*.so*); do echo $i...; rpm -qf $i; echo; done

Chances are that there's the .so.1 version of the library which is a
symlink and two other files.  Changing the symlink to point to the
version that's being managed by a distro package should fix some of
the issues.  Rather that doing it manually, reinstalling the RPM might
work.  To get the name of the RPM that controls the symlink:
$ rpm -qf /usr/lib64/libGL.so.1

You can run the above for each of the files you listed and try to
reinstall each one:
$ rpm -qf /usr/lib64/libcucul.so.0.99.17
/usr/lib64/libkdeinit4_plasma-desktop.so
/usr/lib64/libkdeinit4_ksmserver.so /usr/lib64/libGL.so.1

Does anyone know of a way of listing all the files in a directory along with
the Debian package they came from.  I want to know if there are any
unattached files in a directory so I can clean them up. The usage would be
something like this for a fictitious utility I will call lspkg

lspkg  /usr/bin  |  head

2to3         python-axiom
2to3-2.6    python-axiom
411toppm  netpbm
7z             p7zip-full
7za           p7zip-full
a2p           perl
a2ping       texlive-base-bin
a52dec      liba52-0.7.4-dev


I created the above list manually using apt-file and looking up each file
individually but would like to find an easier method.

Someone posted a script on FSLint's issue tracker that sounds like it
does what you want:

"dpkg -S" does that.  It'll produce the package that any file argument
may have come from.  You can use shell globbing to feed it an entire
directory's worth of files.

  $ dpkg -S /usr/bin/zip* 
  zip: /usr/bin/zip
  zip: /usr/bin/zipcloak
  unzip: /usr/bin/zipgrep

The easiest way is probably to NFS-export a directory from your host 
machine to the VM. Are you familiar with NFS?

Not as well as I should be. However, after a little thought, I realized I
can sft/ssh between the guest and host.

Is there a good NFS help page for use with vms?

Or you can just use sshfs to mount it.  Which works really well.

Google (err, SEARCH, since some people are offended by that) for sshfs and
you'll get a couple of quick hits.

This will give you a quick start if nothing else:
    http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html

Both of these almost do the trick! The find-cruft script gives a system wide
list of files with no obvious package origin and dpkg -S /usr/bin/* will do
the same on a per directory/file glob level. The one thing they are not
doing is looking at /etc/alternatives. For instance the package
xtightvncviewer created the following softlinks
/usr/bin/vncviewer -> /etc/alternatives/vncviewer
and
/etc/alternatives/vncviewer -> /usr/bin/xtightvncviewer

The package origin of these soft links are not reported, but it might be
possible to add that ability to the find-cruft script.

Thanks,
Bill

From the above apparently there is a library and a link to it, but
named libGL.20.260.19.21, not libnvidia-tls.so.260.19.21. I renamed the
link and tried to launch Fontmatrix. This time I got "error while
loading shared libraries: libGL.so.1: cannot open shared object file:
No such file or directory," where previously it was
libnvidia-tls.so.26.19.21 that it couldn't find.

For the second command, all of the libraries were owned by
mesa-libGL-7.9-2.fc14.x86_64, except:

/usr/lib64/libGL.so.260.19.21...
file /usr/lib64/libGL.so.260.19.21 is not owned by any package

So I reinstalled mesa-libGL and it recreated the link that I had
renamed. WTH? Of course, recreating the link means Fontmatrix is back
telling me that it can't find libnvidia-tls.so.260.19.21.

This is a total of ten packages, and I reinstalled all of them. No
change in Fontmatrix or Ksysguard, but Cinepaint now shows an initial
installation splash screen, and then gives "cinepaint fatal error:
sigsegv caught" and offers to Exit or do a Stack Trace. I just exited. 

I think the link idea is on the right track. I just haven't got it
right yet.

so, run either one of those options and retain the list of files that
are not owned by any package.  before cleaning them up, see if they
are symlinks into /etc/alternatives (which, one supposes, you have not
mucked around in--only packages you've installed would have done so,
unless you ran update-alternatives manually or something).  if so,
assume good.  if no, examine further and/or delete.  it's not
perfectly programmatic, but i'd probably do something like:

                 cat list_of_unowned_files | xargs ls -l | grep -v
/etc/alternatives

which would put you where you asked to be =)

Hmm...maybe the nvidia driver registered itself with the
'alternatives' database.  Check out the /etc/alternatives/ directory
and see if you the lib* files are listed in there.  If so then you
might be able to run commands similar to the following to display and
change where the symlink points:
$ alternatives --display libGL.so.1
$ alternatives --config libGL.so.1


When you uninstalled the nvidia drivers, did you just start deleting
files or did you run 'make uninstall'?  If not then you might try
downloading NVIDIA's tar.gz file, 'configure' and 'make uninstall' it;
it might reset the symlinks in the process.


Cheers,

I'll note that you need to be very careful about which directories you 
scan for package ownership.

   * /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin and /usr/sbin should be OK
   * /usr/include should be OK

On the other hand, /lib, /usr/lib and the various lib32 and lib64 
alternatives will have all sorts of symlinks that are created at 
installation time and not owned by a package. It's also the place 
where stuff like locally built CPAN or Python modules might show up 
unless you're extra careful.

/usr/share is so big (over 30,000 files on Debian machine used for 
development) that it wouldn't surprise me to see non-package stuff 
lost in there -- though it'd be sort of interesting to find out.

Anyway, be careful where you look...

   Slackware-13.1 has gimp-2.6.8 included (yes, the GIMP is up to 2.6.11, but
I'm using what comes in the distribution 'cause it's always been Good
Enough). This version of the GIMP seems to have droped the screenshot
acquire feature. The menus have moved off the tool window and I cannot find
the acquire option anywhere.

   Does anyone know where that capability has gone? Alternatively, what other
tool can do the job? (ImageMagick?)

With Gnome on Ubuntu 10.04 pushing the Print Screen key pops up a Save

i use the old standby xwd.  i think it must ship with x11 or something
because it's always Just Been There on whatever distro i've used.

and xwd has the benefit that it does its work mostly on the command
line (i can't imagine opening gimp just to take a screenshot--it takes
seconds to launch, has more than one window, and i have to click in a
lot of places..). imagemagick will convert its output into jpg's or
whatever else you want.

Well, I haven't manually changed /etc/alternatives so this will work.
Here is the combination of Paul's suggestion with yours that finds the files
with no package association and that don't link to /etc/alternatives.

dpkg-query -S /usr/bin/* 2>&1 1> /dev/null  | xargs ls -l | grep -v
"/etc/alternatives"

But it would be nice to have more. Why can't every file in the filesystem
have an attribute or two that says where they originated. Such as what
application created them or which package they are associated with. That way
even if some package got uninstalled and left some junk around, you could
look at the files attributes and find the culprit.  You could use something
like inotify and set an attribute on the file at the time it is created or
modified to show which application last touched it.
But from a quick glance it seems inotify doesn't receive that information or
am I mistaken? Does anybody know of a way to approach this?

Thanks everyone for their help.

   Thanks, Chris. I was totally unaware of this tool. The man page is brief
and I'll have to experiment to learn how to use it.

   I would need to open a v.t. on the virtual desktop rather than opening
GIMP. One window vs. three; probably a couple of seconds faster.

   The man page does not define the "specially formatted dump file" nor
provide the extension to be passed to convert. I'll play with it Real Soon
Now.

Thanks,

I seldom need just a full screen shot, unadulterated.  I almost always want
to select a portion of the screen, often a portion of a window.  Then I want
to adjust the quality of the jpg, based upon the resulting size and
appearance.

scrot can help with this, a little.  (it is my favorite screenshot-grabber too).

To grab a png:
$ scrot -s foo.png

Then, either click on the window you want, and it will capture just
that window, or drag a rectangle to select a specific region of your
desktop to capture.  I *think* you can also click the background to
capture the entire desktop, but that doesn't seem to work with the
pre-alpha window manager I'm using (e17).

Combined with a general purpose command-launcher (like the gnome
command launch dialog... whatever it's called) you can use scrot w/out
opening a terminal.  I usually just issue: scrot -s /tmp/foo.png (in
either Enlightenment's command launcher or with dmenu under xmonad) --
no new windows involved :).

Rich:
You might look at xview. It has always shipped with Slackware since I've 
been using it. Start xview by typing xv. When the little window comes 
up, right click anywhere on it to get the xv controls window. The "grab" 
function is what you want. You can capture after some time delay if you 
want to arm the capture and then give focus to the window that you want 
to capture.

Xview has a good selection of tools to crop, rotate, flip, reduce etc. I 
couldn't live without it and add it to ubuntu systems.

I'm building a media PC for someone else.  For various reasons (mostly for 
geeky fun), I've got the thing booting from an internal IDE->CF adapter 
with two 1TB "green energy" drives on the SATA channels.  There is an 
optical drive slaved from the IDE adapter.  And this all works fine 
(except for being slow to write to the boot device, but I won't care about 
that after it's all configured nicely).

However, the onboard video is analog, so I've addeda PCI adapter with DVI 
output (ATI Radeon-based).  When I boot the system using the new video 
card, I get an error about an address space collision (in the ROM 
allocation) and the boot drive is no longer visible to initramfs.  I can 
tell the bios to boot using the analog video and everything boots 
normally.

What do?

Is it possible that the device IDs are just getting gorped in one 
configuration and not the other and this has nothing to do with the ROM 
allocation?  There are no jumpers or BIOS settings that I can find to 
change the ROM allocation areas associated with the devices.

Halp!

Thank you for your kind attention.

Wayne,

   I've had xv on my systems forever, even Red Hat, and have used it to view
images. Never explored what else it could do. Now I will. I've no scrot
here, but wxd does exist. Regardless, I know I have xv. Also, as far as I
know it's not been developed since 1994, but still works.

Thanks very much!

Is this a sort of new motherboard?
Sounds like this problem
https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/bugme-new/2010-August/025350.html
and this
http://lwn.net/Articles/373551/

which suggests adding
pci=use_crs
to your kernel boot parameters.

If this is not the problem, what motherboard and ATI card do you have?

There is neither a jumper nor a BIOS setting to actually disable the 
onboard video.  I can, however, in the BIOS, select the PCI card as the 
"primary video".  This has the exact same effect as setting the same field 
to "Auto" which prefers the PCI card over the onboard video.

Further INFO:
A more careful examination of the boot messages during a (working) boot 
using the onboard video indicates that the same address collision errors 
appear, but the drive is read fine.

Looking into Bill's suggestion now.

Tried this.  The address collision error went away, but this is apparently 
not the problem.  New data!

The problem lies with the IDE->CF adapter, maybe.  Again, everything boots 
fine using the onbard video, but when I try to boot while using the PCI 
video card, the root drive will not mount.  "Ext3-fs Magic mismatch Very 
weird!" is the exact message.  Then I am dropped to a BusyBox prompt. 
Attempts to mount the disk at this prompt result in the same error.

Gah.  I apperciate whatever thoughts y'all have.

Jeme.

So if its not the address collision, maybe it is loading the wrong agp
module.

OK.  Trying this.

But can you (or anyone) explain why any of this would cause it to barf on 
the Ext3 filesystem on the root device?

I was mostly ignoring the EXT3 error on the root device and thinking that
the root device is using  SATA and the Radeon video is using PCI and the
common thing between those is the PCI bus. One is messing up the other by
some unknown conflict over the PCI Bus. You know the root device is working
with the onboard video.  This shifts attention to the plugin video card. The
combination onboard video and  and plugin video card  has caused on and off
trouble since the PC and its bios first came into existence. I was thinking
that the bios was not completely turning off the onboard video so the kernel
was loading the modules for the onboard video and they were conflicting with
the modules needed for the Radeon and the side effect was that your root
device was giving strange errors.  But I could have wandered down the wrong
path?

I think you've not wandered down the wrong path.  I inadvertantly lied to 
you!

The pci=use_crs had no discernible effect.  The address collision error is 
still there.  I think you're right about that being the real thing to be 
resolved.

The root drive is PATA/IDE, but there are also two SATA drives.  When 
mounting ANY of those drives using the BusyBox prompt after the failure to 
mount the root filesystem when the external video is engaged, I get the 
same EXT3-fs error.  The devices show up fine in /dev/disks/, but mounting 
them doesn't fly.

This is pretty frustrating.  Thanks to anyone thinking about this problem 
or following along.

Something is breaking the superblock or journal with that Radeon installed.
That is super weird. I was on my phone yesterday when I responded so I
couldn't dig into it more.

Can you fsck the disk after you've been dropped to busybox?

So maybe it's the other way around, maybe the default was already
pci=use_crs so you should try pci=nocrs.
If that doesn't work,  give us more information. Which kernel are you using
and what modules  are loading when you use the built-in video? Do you have a
64 bit cpu and have you tried a 32 bit and a 64 bit kernel?

the /etc/alternatives/ folder has a lot of stuff (half of it is Java),
but nothing at all related to video drivers. (But it's interesting to
find out about folders that previously I had no ken of.)

I ran the nouveau driver exclusively after installing Fedora 11 x86_64
a year ago. I continued with it until I was experiencing problems
getting the laptop to display a screen with the classroom projectors at
PSU. So I installed the nVidia proprietary drivers. To do so I used
Yumex, as I already had the rpmfusion repository enabled.

I couldn't get the nVidia drivers to work either, so I uninstalled them
in order to go back to the nouveau driver. Uninstalling was more
complex than merely uninstalling the package with Yumex, because you
have to undo the nouveau-blacklist file that the nVidia installer sets
up. Eventually I got the nouveau driver working again. I did not test
the Fontmatrix or ksysguard programs at this time.

But I still couldn't get the nouveau driver to work correctly with the
projectors, so I reinstalled the nVidia driver. In the process of
uninstalling the nVidia drivers the first time I learned that the
*correct* way to install them is by downloading them from nvidia.com
and installing with the built-in script. Doing so installs the
nvidia-install and nvidia-uninstall scripts. Supposedly this method of
uninstalling fixes everything. (Hah!)

So when I uninstalled the nVidia drivers the second time I ran the
nvidia-uninstall script. I still had to rename the xorg.conf file that
the nVidia install script had created. 

Sorry I am so late in replying here. I had a medical crisis where I
was barely conscious upon arrival that the emergency room. I just
got home a couple hours ago after spending the past two days in the
ICU.

Never mind the computer stuff!  Take care of yourself.  Glad to see you are
lucid, but the whole thing does not sound like a happy experience.  Anything

Dude!  When I ramble on about the need for better last-mile

has altogether a different series-of-tubes than I was talking about.

Here's to hoping your infrastructure has more than a last-mile to go!

Subject: [PLUG] Installing a Cisco Valet wireless USB adapter
Message-ID: <AANLkTiktBK7-P4j3ejVTfnRX=11Ld+H7uTXN6wV-hv+C@mail.gmail.com>

I'm running OpenSuse 11.2, with KDE 4.3.5. I've been using a wired
connection to our router (Cisco Linksys E1000). We've moved from our
house to an apartment (where I can't drill holes in the floor to run
cables from room to room) so I'm trying to connect wirelessly. I've
got a Cisco Valet wireless USB adapter. I've tried running
Ndisinstaller to connect it. Choosing my language, doing the system
check, downloading the data and current software (v 1.53) all go fine.

Then it asks me for the driver info. The program doesn't find the
drivers on its own. The drivers are located at /media/USB
DISK/drivers, but no matter which driver file I choose, when I try to
install the software, I get the following result:

--> enter work-directory...ok
--> uncompress data...ok
--> assemble installation-data...

and then I get a pop-up that reads "There has been an Error during the
Installation Process. The error was: Compilation Error."

What am I doing wrong? Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Subject: [PLUG] Netgear RP614v4 and OpenDNS...
Message-ID: <20101213143846.737ffowm0w8so48o@web.robinson-west.com>

I use Opendns via static ip DSL served to my lan via Linux based dns gateways.
Comcast cable does not use a static ip where I've noticed that saying  
use the Opendns servers on the Netgear router isn't enough.  Do I need  
to use a dynamic ip address tracking service so I can make sure that  
DNS filtering is in effect?
I've turned off the router's dynamic ip configuration lan side so that  
I can plug in my servers and I could forseeably set things up so that  
the opendns dns servers are always accessed through the DSL.  If I do  
that though, the cable will
not act as a failover in the event that the DSL is down.  I've played  
around with
the Netgear RP614v4's site blocking feature, but that is an inferior  
approach to
the problem and for some reason no matter what I put in, certain sites  
just won't block.

Does anyone use OpenDNS with residential comcast cable?  How about  
dynamic ip tracking services, anyone use these?

The main thing you are doing wrong is expecting devices with no (or
lousy) driver support to work.  Get a device that has good drivers and
be happier!  See:

  http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers

You can also use reflashed access points (like wrt54gl's or
equivalents) to bridge airgaps.  I've also had luck with zd1211 based
usb-radios.

I don't have that one.  I have an ASUS 1005PE, with a spinning disk
and an advertised 14-hour battery.  I don't get 14 hours, mind you,
but I get enough (8-ish?) that I don't bother to carry the charger

i've had a similar experience with my asus 1005pr, which is a fairly
similar beast to the one Russell is talking about.  (the sea of model
#s in the asus lineup is pretty ridiculous.)

but both Russell's and my machine have 10" screens and decently sized
keyboards.  if you're ok with watching youtube in a tinier window than
your already tiny screen (i'm not sure fullscreen (non-HD.  HD will
definitely not play smoothly fullscreen!) will work on the earlier
eeepc's without being choppy?) and your fingers find the keyboard
usable, you'll probably be ok.  if i got one of those for free i'd
take it and use it if i didn't already have a better netbook, i guess,
but i wouldn't buy one unless it was like $50.  the cost savings of a
hundred or so bucks for a new machine whose overall size is no smaller
than the ones with 10" screens, with a smaller battery and lesser
keyboard does not seem worthwhile to me. (what bugged me about many
netbooks was the placement of the right shift key and cursor keys.
YMMV.)

I looked at that page. Specifically, the USB device page. So if I get
one of the products listed on this page, and download the driver
associated with it, I should be able to use it, yes? Would I still
need to use ndisinstall?

I'm looking for the simplest way to get my machine to connect
wirelessly, and I'm not sure I even know the right questions to ask.

no ndisinstall required--ndiswrapper is the thing that lets linux
(kinda) use (some) windows-only drivers.  i use it because i was
gifted some hardware, but i had to install a wired connection to that
server too since the ndiswrapper driver hangs occasionally and it's
really difficult to plug a monitor in to diagnose.  the hangs are the
sort that just hang the wireless card, so the server is still up.  yet
still the hangs require a reboot to fix and occur with varying
frequency--sometimes thrice in a day, sometimes not for months.
that's the level of reliability i'd expect from any ndiswrapper-driven
device :/


> I'm looking for the simplest way to get my machine to connect

the devices on that web page are probably supported already by your
distribution, most likely nothing required to install/enable except
plugging them in.

he was just suggesting using a second wireless access point, changing
its os, and plugging it into your PC with a wire and having it do the
talking to the "real" wireless access point that is hooked to your
cablemodem.  if you happened to have a spare one laying around, maybe
it would be the cheapest route (and easy on the linux side.  though
more complicated on the second wireless access point.

I've recently played with batman-adv, a layer 2 mesh protocol, as an
alternative to WDS.  But it requires buying probably more hardware
than a supported USB radio.

As it happens, I've got a couple WRT54G's that have DDWrt-micro on
them, specifically set up to bridge using WDS.  They are underpowered
(not enough flash storage) for the kinds of things I *usually* do with
them, and would be happy to sell them to someone that need something
similar.

Subject: [PLUG] Controlling DNS with cable...
Message-ID: <1292395572.2562.123.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

An inferior solution is to set my Netgear RP614v4 router to use a DSL
based static ip subnet as the source for DNS queries.  This will work
unless the DSL is down.  Oops!  I need a better solution.

Is there any way to use OpenDNS with a residential Comcast cable
account?

Comcast really should fix this problem.  It is a shame that the DNS
services Comcast offers don't include filtering capabilities.  I
should be able to log in to their DNS servers with say an account 
number and a password to set filtering options.

Part of the whole point of having both Cable and DSL based Internet
connections is to have redundancy.  If the DNS queries are always
routed through the DSL link, there isn't any redundancy.

The Netgear router I'm using with the cable modem has a dynamic dns
feature...  I wonder if I can use this feature to lock down what my
address is so I can use OpenDNS directly?

I could switch to a business account, but that is a lot of expense
I should think for an otherwise simple and common problem.

Before anyone says use a filtered proxy, I don't want to force the
use of a proxy because of privacy and security concerns.  Doing
online banking through a filter proxy isn't an ideal situation.

Getting any degree of redundancy with multiple links is really hard, sorry.

The easy answer would be to purchase one of the end-user routers
(often sold for small businesses) that  offer the ability to use
multiple Internet connections, and often 3G these days, with fail-over
or even load balancing.

The not-buying-a-solution answer is that you should probably run your
own DNS server on one of your systems internally, and delegate it the
responsibility of communicating with the outside world.  That would
give you the same advantages as running the widget with a DNS cache,
without the penalties of inflexibility.

You could also just have your DHCP server tell the clients to talk
direct to OpenDNS and bypass any local DNS caching.  :)

> Regardless of everything else.
> 1> What is the problem you are trying to solve?

He wants multiple Internet connections to let him still connect when
one is down.

That would defeat the purpose. ;)

Try to roll your own router which connects to both ISP's and then load share or
prioritize or fail-over your searches and other traffic.

Or you might want to try something like this:

Have your router/firewall hand out the openDNS addresses with it's DHCP address.

Yes,  I do it already.  Register at one of the dynamic dns services
that the box uses and then place that login info
into the router.  Then at OpenDNS add the host by name to OpenDNS.

If you are using both DSL and Cable you probably are paying close to a
business account connection.

My suggestion would be - if you are going to use an adapter that requires 
ndiswrapper - that you not use 'ndisinstall'.  It is not required, and 
apparently a buggy POS based on your experience (I'd never heard of it 
before your e-mail).

This page
( 
http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/Networking/NdisWrapper_The_Ultimate_Guide 
)

has a pretty complete set of instructions for how to set up ndiswrapper 
manually.

Subject: [PLUG] can't login to my ar410w router
Message-ID: <AANLkTim76xu7bvzNgvWO_Lr9ucX+K5-F7LbBjXYU63C1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

 I type 192.168.1.1 in Firefox 3.6.13 to try to get to the
configuration screen for my wireless router Airlink Model # ar410w.  A
dialog box comes up asking me for a user name and password.  According
to the the manual for the ar410w, I type admin for the user name, and
admin for the password.  I did this and I get 401 Unauthorized.

I have ubuntu 10.04 on my machine.  Whenever I need to do some sort of
admin stuff, especially from the command line, I have to do sudo.  I'm
wondering if I have to do something "extra" to get to be able to
configure my wireless modem, beyond simply typing admin for the user
name and password.

Also, there is a reset button on the wireless router.  I used a
pencil, and with the power on, on the tiny modem button, and held the
pencil there for 20-30 seconds.  I was hoping that it would set the
router to factory defauts, and thus be able to use admin as the
password.

I don't know what to do now.  I don't know if it's a linux thing, or a
router thing, but I figure someone on this list would know.  Please
note that I am able to surf the web, and post this email to the list,
using the very same router that I'm trying to configure.

Thank you for your consideration,

Sincerely,
Victor Soich

Victor,

   What is the IP address of the host from which you're trying to access the
router? If it's not on the 192.168.1.0 subnet then you need to configure the
interface on the host for both subnets.

   As root (or 'sudo' if you prefer) run 'ifconfig -a' on your host. That
will tell you the name of the interface connected to the router; probably
eth0.

   Now you need to add a default route on eth0 to 192.168.1.0, but you want
to use the same last digit as on the host you're using. Again as root, type
'route add default 192.168.1.n netmask 255.255.255.0 gw <your network
gateway IP address> eth0:1'. The 'n' is the same host IP as you use for
192.168.0.0 (or whatever your local subnet is).

HTH,

Rich

Rich, if he couldn't reach the device, it wouldn't be asking him for a
password!

Sounds to me like someone changed the username/password.  At that
point, I think I'd be looking up the instructions for how to do a
factory reset.

Hi Russell,

There is a reset button on the wireless router.  I used a
pencil, and with the power on, on the tiny modem button, and held the
pencil there for 20-30 seconds.  I was hoping that it would set the
router to factory defauts, and thus be able to use admin as the
password.

Maybe I'm not using the reset button correctly?  Is what I did above
not correct?  If what I did is correct, does it not reset the
password?  If the password is not reset, how do I do that?  I think I
got this modem from my brother, but I really don't remember.

Sincerely,
Victor

It depends on the device.  Some of them will do a reset just by
holding the button down, some of them require you hold it down as you
plug in the power.  I'd advice googling for the user manual and try to
find your specific device's factory reset instructions.

Dear Russell

Furthermore, in the Quick Installation Guide, which is for windows, it says,


After your IP address is released, click Renew. You should get an IP
address of 192.168.1.x
(where x is a number between 2 - 254). If you don?t get an IP address,
reset the router by holding in the
reset button at the back of the router for 10 seconds while it is ON
and try Renew again.


but in this in the context of windows, where within dialog boxes I hit
buttons that say "Renew", "Release", etc.  I don't know the way to do
it from the command line, and I don't know how to bring up these
dialog boxes in ubuntu.

Sincerely,
Victor

   True.

   But, Victor also wrote that he reset the router. Perhaps not the proper
way.

You have done everything correctly it sounds like, so what are the possible
problems
a) you have caplocks on or for some other reason did not actually type admin
for username and password.
b) you are accessing the router over wireless and you are not actually
connecting to your router, but to a neighbors
c) your reset button didn't get pushed in far enough (did the router lights
indicate it was rebooting after the reset?)
d) ?

They are talking about DHCP.  You can refresh your lease in Network
Manager by "disconnecting" and then reconnecting your ethernet
interface via the panel widget or by unplugging/replugging your
ethernet cable.  You are using ethernet, and not wireless?  Sometimes
configuration is disabled over wireless for security reasons.

If you are forced to do the dhcp manually, you can try this:

  $ sudo stop network-manger
  $ sudo dhclient eth0

you should see some DHCP messages, then confirm you can ping the
thing:

  $ ping 192.168.1.1

do you dirty admin interface business with the browser, then turn on
network-manager again when you are done:

  $ sudo start network-manager

(this assumes a recent ubuntu)

I am using an Ethernet cable  to connect to the wireless router.  Once
I am able to access the configuration screen of the router, then I
hope to configure the wireless stuff, and then I hope my wireless card
will be able to access the router.

By the way, I paid 8 bucks for a wireless dongle from the Freegeek
thrift store, which was tested to work with linux by the Freegeek
testing process, whatever that is.  However the tech support at
Freegeek couldn't get the wireless dongle to work with my particular
box.  Please note, I did give it the old college try to try to figure
it out myself first.  They said none of the wireless dongles that they
had on hand worked with my particular box, and so they put in this
wireless card.  I don't know if it's a case of a tech support person
doing the expedient thing, or if my particular box has something so
weird, that no wireless dongle worked.  Whatever the case may be, I am
annoyed that I paid for a wireless dongle, and wound up with a
wireless card.  I wanted to be able to remove my dongle and use it for
other computers.  I have yet to make use of my wireless card.

Furthermore, I built 5 boxes at Freegeek, and then built this one that
I'm currently using, which is not able to work with a Freegeek tested
wireless dongle.  Freegeek let's you keep your sixth box that you
build.  I asked if I could turn in my sixth free box back in and build
a new one in it's place, so that I could have a box that works with a
wireless dongle.  They could sell the box that doesn't work in the
thrift store, with the caveat that it doesn't work with wireless
dongles, and I could build a box that would work with wireless
dongles.  I was met with a lot of rhetoric regarding how Freegeek has
limited resources, and that I would not be allowed to do this.  That I
find disingenuous because, all their stuff is donated, and it's my
sweat equity that is being spent.  Freegeek gets 5 boxes built by me,
and I can't build a sixth box that will work with a wireless dongle.
Need less to say, my enthusiasm for Freegeek took a bit of a hit.  I
wanted my free sixth built box to work to my satisfaction, but instead
I'm annoyed.  I not so needy that I need a free box, but I'm am anal
enough, that if the box that I have doesn't work with a wireless
dongle, then I want to turn it back in, and build one that will.

Furthermore, I'm worried that I'm going to get slammed for criticizing
Freegeek, and for not being gracious for getting a free computer.  If
Freegeek, and linux were a regular company, I'd be livid about a lack
of customer service, but since it's idealistic, I'm more just
disconcerted.

Having said all that....I was incredibly happy when I got civ 4 to
(mostly) work on my machine.  That video game was the only thing that
I really missed from Windows!  I'd wax gloriously about Wine right
now, but I've written enough!

Still, now my immediate goal is to just to be able to configure my
router.  So....back to our regularly scheduled programming.......

Sincerely,
Victor

I think the answer is d, but it is sooooo nice to get positive
reinforcement with the statement "You have done everything correctly."

I guess I'll bring the box and router to the PLUG clinic.

With regard to answer a) I tried again with caps lock, both on and off.

With regard to answer b) Rich Shepard in a previous email said
"You have both interfaces shown, but only
the ethernet (eth1) is running."

With regard to answer c) the router lights went out, and eventually
came on again, and from that I infer the router was rebooting.
Whether my interpretation of what the lights on the router mean may be
suspect!

So....I think the answer is d)

Hi Russell,

I couldnt find Network Manage.  I found System -> Preferences ->
Network Connections and System -> Preference -> Network Proxy and
System -> Administration -> Network Tools.  Within those dialog boxes,
I did not figure out how to disconnect and reconnect my interface.  I
have physically unplugged and replugged my ethernet cable.

I almost 100 % positive that I'm using ethernet and not wireless,
because up until 2 hours ago my cable modem was hooked up directly to
my computer vie ethernet, with no router in between.  Since "they" say
it is prudent to use a router, that's what I'm trying to do.
Eventually, I want to go wireless.  My router does wireless, but
initially, I hooking up via ethernet.  I thing there is some trick to
my router that I'm not getting, i.e. I'm possibly not resetting it to
factory defaults, and thus able to use the user name admin and
password admin.

I hope I don't have to do dhcp manually.  For me, that's headed into
deep waters.

My ubuntu is 10.04

If you have forgotten the router's user name and password, and the default
user name and password aren't working, try resetting the router back to
factory defaults:

With the router powered on, hold the reset button (located on the back of
the router) for 25 seconds. Then disconnect the power from the router and
wait 10 seconds before plugging it back in.

After the reset, you should be able to login to the router with the default
user name and password. 
 


Merry Christmas All!
Terry

I agree that you have done everything correctly. Something else is going on
which I would not want to try to diagnose via email.

You don't need to bring your computer to the clinic in order to work on the
router. You would just need to bring the router.

You do need to bring it if you want to work on the wireless adapter.

Subject: [PLUG] Laptop issues
Message-ID: <AANLkTimV_Pbi9--z=K3RpW1YOu+phJvMYyd8qP42BCbk@mail.gmail.com>

The need is for a laptop to run an HP S20 slide scanner, using Windows 95 or
98, since that scanner has no Linux support.  I have tried in the past using
Windows 2K under VirtualBox, but that did not work.  It used to work when I
was dual-booting to Windows ME.

I recently received an HP Pavilion ze5375us with Ubuntu installed. (Thanks
Russell).  He said that he had to try 2-3 times to get it to boot from the
CD to do the install, but got it done.  Now the CD does not seem to work.
 The bios is very sparce, but it shows that it had a CD.  Ubuntu shows it
has a CD, but can tell me little about it.  wodim --devices tells me that
the drive is /dev/scd0, but nothing more.  This machine has a floppy!, so I
booted to a Windows 98 startup disk to see what it would say about the CD.
 It could not read it either. The message from the floppy said "some drives
require special drivers", and I saw some comments on the web about the CD on
this laptop failing due to driver issues.  So this could be a hardware or a
SW issue.  I took the drive out and gave it a cursory inspection--relatively
dust-free.  No dice.

So my questions:  Are there suggestions as to what to do next with this
laptop, or would it be better to look for one with a functioning CD and save
my energy for less frustrating tasks?  This is cosmetically a very clean
laptop, but not of use to me without a CD.

Thanks for reading this far.

At least 3 of the comments on this article mention that the S20 is 
supported on Linux under SANE and Gimp.
    <http://photo.net/equipment/hp/scanner/photosmart-slide-scanner>
Hope that helps.  I could add that I run an HP OfficeJet 7310 All-in-One 
on Madriva 2008.0 with Gnome, and I have very good results scanning 
(reflective copy) using either Gimp/SANE or HP Device Manager/Kooka (a 
KDE GUI frontend using SANE libraries).

The older model (scsi) is supported.  I want the dedicated slide scanner
rather than a flat-bed with adapters because of the ease of use and
generally superior performance.  It also tends to get less dusty inside.
 And I have it.

I assume you tried Windows 95 or 98 under Virtualbox as well as 2000,
right?

Does the laptop have a USB port? If so it's probably 1.1, but will
still work with more modern USB devices, just more slowly. So you could
possibly scare up a USB CD drive. 

Or do you need to boot to the CD drive? If the laptop is as old as it
sounds, the BIOS probably doesn't offer the option of booting to a USB
drive, even if it's really a CD.

Maybe I didn't read carefully enough. What do you need the CD drive for?

Did you happen to copy down the model number of the CD drive while you had
it out?  Might help to figure out what kind of drivers it may need.
Also, I stumbled across the service manual for this series of notebooks,
here <http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c00246219.pdf> is the link in
case you are interested.

Well.....F**K ME!  After reading the below message from Terrence
Hulse, I tried yet again, and again, and again, to reset my router to
factory settings.  I don't know what I finally did, but eventually
something worked, and I was able to log in as admin, and use admin as
the password!!!  Obviously, I'm left handed, and what I'm dealing with
is a router designed for right handed people!  Man.....I hate
computers.

So.....now I'm actually able to configure the router.  I don't know
what the prudent thing to do is.  So far, I've changed the admin
password, and I've changed the name of the ESSID, and I have it on
channel 6, whatever that means.  Am I suppose to enable WEP, or some
other thingy.  What am I suppose to do, stuff that I haven't thought
of.  At the end of this process, I want my computer to communicate
wireless with the router, without an Ethernet connection.  That's
where I'm headed, but for right now, I just need to know what things I
should set in my router, before I even try to make my computer
communicate wirelessly with the router.

Still, thank you all for helping me through this angst inducing
procedure.  These little things can really trip one up.  So, please
tell me what are the best practices for configuring the router.  I
eventually want my computer to communicate with the router wirelessly.
 I want my brother to access the internet with his laptop wirelessly
when he comes to visit.  I don't want anyone to willy-nilly access my
wireless network.  I want to set up my printer to be used wirelessly,
i.e. it is wireless g enabled.  And I want this all to be
secure....whatever that means.  So....what are the prudent things for
me to do now....enable wep for example?

This whole thing has been nerve wracking!  I earnestly thank you all
for your support, and especially, your patience.

Sincerely,
Victor Soich

Well, I guess I didn't do everything quite correctly.  I finally got
my router to factory settings, by somehow using the right combination
of pressing the reset button to the router, and disconnecting the
power to the router at a correctly moment in time.  My incantations to
linuxy spirits and my talking in tongues finally paid off!
Hallelujah!

I strongly suggest you make sure you can get a wireless connection before
you configure any "security".
Security will just confuse the matter and is best left to later if ever.
Your router sounds like it is ready. Now you just have to get your laptop
setup.

It has usb2.  The CPU is a 2.4GHz P4.  It's not *that* old.

That's possible.  I suggested trying that route also, but Denis is
lacking the thumbdrive facilities.  That's probably the cheapest route
at the moment.  Use /bin/dd to copy the Win98 install CD to a
harddisk, and then build a bootable USB drive from that image.  Ubuntu
calls it the "Startup Disk Creator".

To install windows 98, the most recent OS with drivers for the
scanner.

It isn't a driver issue.  There are no drivers involved (beyond BIOS)
when booting from CDROM.  As Denis mentioned, it was having some
trouble with the CDROM when I installed Ubuntu on it the day before I
delivered it to him, but I ultimately succeeded.  I am assuming there
is a hardware problem with the drive.

Best Practices is to be generous and share with your neighbors!  I am
a volunteer for a non-profit that helps people do that safely.  It's
against our bylaws to help people not share! ;-)

With a few precautions, sharing is safe.  With a few facilities, abuse
can be effectively dissuaded.  With those two things covered, that
just leaves the gift-culture spirit.

Excellent. I've ordered a different adapter (from the list) from
Amazon. With luck, it'll work for me without any trouble. If
not...I'll be back on the list to ask more questions.

Subject: [PLUG] Buying your own cable modem...
Message-ID: <20101216003113.11w87tcap44ccc8o@web.robinson-west.com>

I have a rented from Comcast Arris TM722 ?G modem.  It has no usb  
port, one phone port, one ethernet port, and of course a cable  
connection.

I've been googling trying to find a source to buy the same modem from so I can
return the rental.  I figure I'll be with Comcast for a year at least.  
  If I disconnect, I might want to reconnect down the road.  It is  
less hassle if I
own the equipment and don't have to pay an extra $5/month.  Much  
easier if Comcast can essentially throw a switch and I'm back up.

If I can pick up a modem for $60 or less with the VOIP features, it  
doesn't make sense to rent, especially if I stick with Comcast for  
longer than a year.

I need an external modem, I use a Netgear RP614v4 between the cable  
modem and my Linux based routers.

I have opendns and dyndns.com set up, but it's hard to get the cable  
modem to come up with a different ip address and hence difficult to  
verify that opendns still works when the ip address changes.

On dyndns.com I paid $15 for 1 year service, don't know if I needed to though.

I have a full picture of the entire label on the CD--everything in English,
French, etc.  A reconditioned drive is $60.  I have a copy of the service

@149.99 the link below says that it would be three years to pay off
the cost of the modem.
Actually 2.5 years.

I will have filled the thumbdrive lack by this afternoon.  I will then try
the route you describe.  If I am sucessful, I will be on my way!

Someplace around the house I have a full set of Windows 95 install
floppies. I can dig them up if they would be of any help.

It should be easy enough to test if it can boot from a USB stick. If I
recall, your regular computer has a recent version of Ubuntu. Ubuntu
comes with a utility to make a bootable USB stick. You just need an
Ubuntu ISO that you can download from Ubuntu, and a USB stick with
about 800 MB free space.

Also, perhaps we could transplant the hard disk from the laptop to a
different laptop that has a functioning CD drive, install Windows 98,
then move it back. I have a laptop that we could use for the exercise.

Thanks, John.  I will first try the thumb drive approach.  If that stumbles,
I may take you up on your offer. How many floppies does it take for W98?
 Sounds terrible to me.

Russell,
After I make a bootable USB drive, how do I get the Pavilion to boot from
the USB?  The USB is not on the list of boot devices.  Do I need a floppy to
start the process?

But the first order of business is to become thumb-enabled.

Also, Larry may want to consult his contract with Comcast- I was
alarmed a few years (and in another state/city) ago to discover that
my contract with Comcast did not allow me to have my own modem without
paying a fee to Comcast (it basically would wind up costing me *more*
to not rent the modem).

The one thing that saved me was that a few aggressive competitors were
popping up in my area at the time and Comcast's monopoly was ending.
They were paranoid about losing their customers, so I basically called
them up and threatened to leave unless I got rid of the modem rental
fee (and back to the starting discount rate that I originally was on
:-) which actually worked.

Might pay to call your Comcast line and act the penny-pinching
customer who is seriously considering going to the competition :-)

>> On dyndns.com I paid $15 for 1 year service, don't know if I needed to though.

I use http://freedns.afraid.org/, which is free, and, so far, I've had
no complaints about it.

Years ago I used Zoneedit (still have a few domains locked away in it
that I need to deal with) but I can't say I recommend it simply
because it has what I'd call overly draconian password policies (and
this comes from someone who's already pretty draconian about his
password policies as is).

First, note that all I have is Windows 95, not 98. If I recall
correctly it was 20+ 3.5 inch floppies. You really have to like Windows
to install it this way. I still have the laptop too, but I think it has
a hardware problem and won't boot. I remember it had both a floppy and
a CD drive, but they were not hot-swappable, and it couldn't boot to
the CD drive. Hence, it came with Windows 95 on the hard drive, with a
utility to make a set of install disks for backup purposes, which I did.

I have fond memories of this laptop, having schlepped it from
Portland to Bogot? and back, mostly by land. I had more testosterone
then.

Dunno about you but I just got some snailmail from comcast last week saying
rental rates were going up to 7$/month.  I'm also thinking about buying tho
maybe I can go cheaper since I don't need voip...

Also dyndns works fine without paying.  I use their free service and have
for almost a decade.  They email you a link you have to click once a month
and you can only have one or two hostnames, but that works fine for me.

wes> is there a guide to these precautions and facilities somewhere?

Not as a literal guide.  They are kind of built in to the way we build
our router configurations.  Generally speaking: isolate
sensitive/vulnerable computers from the public; monitor usage somehow
(munin/cacti/nagios,etc); have tools like tcpdump, iftop (or similar),
iptables available on the gateway router so that abusers can be
identified and interdicted.

I have a favorite one-liner for detecting bit-torrenters:

  tcpdump -n -i $iface 'tcp[tcpflags] & tcp-syn != 0 and tcp[tcpflags] & tcp-ack == 0 and not src and dst net 127.0.0.0/8'

where $iface is the interface on which the public client's traffic arrives.

That basically looks for new TCP connections.  Bittorrent spews TCP
connections like crazy, dozens a second, to random high-numbered
ports, on random hosts.  Then, with the IP address of the abuser, you
get their macaddress from the DCHP leases or ARP table and you nuke
them with something like:

  iptables -v -I FORWARD -m mac --mac-source $macaddr -j REJECT

In our experience, people who are connecting to an open wifi network
are extremely happy to have access to tubes.  Withdrawing that access
has a strong influence on their behavior.  Most of the time, the
'abuse' is not done knowingly.  That is, the perpetrator does not
realize that they are making the network difficult for others to use.
Temporarily blocking them provides a feedback signal that helps
moderate their behavior.  Without that kind of feedback, the 'abuse'
is likely to continue indefinitely, because the abuser only gets
positive reinforcement ("ooh, look our free gigantic file has arrived
from thin air!  this is AWESOME!"), and eventually drive the network
host to 'lock' up their wifi network.  In our experience, our
technique seems to solve 99% of our problems.

We can provide routers configured and ready to go, on an indefinite
loan basis, to anyone who agrees to host a Personal Telco node.  The
loan lasts as long as you remain a Personal Telco node.

I have had Comcast for ten - fifteen years and have never rented their
modem, except during the first month. 

About three years ago my original modem died (during a dist-upgrade, of
all things - gawd what a mess that made!). I googled for good quality
replacements and ended up with a Linksys CM100. I don't recall how much
I paid, but you can get it for $53 with free shipping here:

http://www.amazon.com/Linksys-Cisco-Cable-Ethernet-Connection/dp/B000WIK61I

Once you install it you have to call Comcast technical support. They
peer down the line, see the modem, and add it to your account. That's
it. It just works.

Hmm.  I may be wrong, but there's an option on the initial bootup
screen (press Esc?) to get boot options.  There may be a removable
drive option that would work?  See what choices it gives you.  Maybe
(long shot) it doesn't include the USB option unless there is a USB
plugged in?

If this laptop doesn't fly, I may have another one available (it has a
cracked case in one corner, currently missing a harddisk, but
otherwise works afaik).

Sorry for all the trouble, btw... it worked that last time I tried to
use it.

A 1gig thumbdrive might be sufficient, but 2gigs would be safer.

These days, I think you want a DOCSIS 3.0 device if you have a choice. 
The CM100 supports DOCSIS 2.0, which will work fine with the 
lower-tier Comcast offerings but will prevent you from moving to the 
"wideband" (50 Mb/s) speeds in the future.

on every computer I've used USB booting options with, the USB option would
not appear in the boot menu unless it detected a USB something to boot from.
so, this is not really a long shot at all.

Thanks Paul, I think I'm stuck buying a different modem though because
this one doesn't support VOIP.  Apparently, Best Buy is the only place I
can purchase an Arris TM722G and according to Comcast it will run me
$250.

Apparently, if I drop digital voice service I can purchase the above
modem and stop renting, but I kinda like the voice service.

By VoIP, do you mean it has a jack for your phone, or that it supports the
QoS/VLAN features that Comcast uses for their VoIP service?

Regular low-grade DOCSIS modems are available at FreeGeek and Goodwill, and
I've got a spare recent-model Motorola sitting in my attic.

Land-lines have service guarantees, often work better with FAX machines,
and work when the power's out.  (Just make sure you have a wired phone!)

Back when the local cable TV network was owned by AT&T it had phone
service on it, and I had a line through them.  It worked even when the
Cable, and internet went out.

DOCSIS 3.0 is new, and important if you want it to actually still work
a few years from now.

The phone line I had through the cable company years ago was powered
from the cable.  They split out the high voltage before hooking up to
the in home cable jacks that go to TV's and such.  If this is a device
that plug into a normal cable jack in the wall it probably doesn't
have this power source.

Subject: [PLUG] brother HL-2270DW to work in ubuntu 10.04
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=v9MkuwgoGuH05krp3S1Zu7t8KR6bRoGh7G5LG@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I believe I have successfully set up my wireless g router.  There is
no security, no wep, or whatever, as far as I can tell.  I don't know
if I should do that or not.

I am trying to set up a wireless laser monochrome printer.  It is the
Brother HL-2270DW.  According to one review at Newegg.com, it is a
linux friendly computer

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16828113545&cm_re=hl-2270DW-_-28-113-545-_-Product

I copied the review at the end of the email in case you want to read it.

So....I plugged in the printer using a usb connection.  Ubuntu 10.04
detected that I attached a printer.  A dialog box came up with three
radio buttons to choose from.

The first radio button said "Select printer from database"

The second radio button said "Provide PPD file"

The third radio button said "Search for a printer driver to download"



When I hit the first radio button, I'm given a list of "makes" to
choose from.  I picked "Brother", and then hit the forward button.
Then I'm given a list of "Models" and told to "Choose Driver".  There
are lots of drivers to choose from, but there is not an "HL-2270DW" to
choose from.  So....I did not choose any.

I went back and looked at the second radion button.  I don't know what
a PPD file is...let alone how to provide it.

I then went with the third radio button, and the search result said
"--No matches found--"

So, ubuntu 10.04 didn't automatically take care of me.  I did a google
search on how to get a brother HL-2270DW to work on ubuntu 10.04, and
found the following stuff.

According to the link

http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-hardware-18/need-help-getting-brother-hl-2270dw-printer-to-work-with-ubuntu-10-04-a-848196/

It literally says the following:

According to this link
-->http://welcome.solutions.brother.com...valuation.html your printer
is known to work with 10.04 32 and 64 bit versions; ( second last box
).



At the above just cited link

http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/evaluation.html

The HL-2270DW is under the

Printer Driver (lpr driver and cupswrapper driver)


but it is not under

Printer Driver (PPD File)


I don't remember how I found the following link

http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/index.html

but it says,

Brother Drivers for Linux? distributions

>From the just cited web page, I clicked on the following 3 links.

The first link Download "Printer Driver"

The second link says Instruction Printer (CUPS) "Driver Install"

The third links say Instruction Printer (LPR): "Driver Install"


The first link took me to

http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_prn.html

where I clicked on the "HL-2270DW" which took me to

http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_prn.html#HL-2270DW

where I downloaded on to my computer an HL-2270DW LPR Driver
and I downloaded on to my computer an HL-2270DW cupswrapper driver

So, now there are two files sitting on my desktop

hl2270dwlpr-2.1.0-1.i386.deb
cupswrapperHL2270DW-2.0.4-2.i386.deb

and I don't know what to do, or which one to use, or even if I have
the right thing.  Am I even on the right track in getting my printer
to work?


The second link from above
The second link says Instruction Printer (CUPS) "Driver Install"

took me to
http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/instruction_prn1.html
where it says

Models available with Brother ppd file :

but I don't see HL-2270DW in the list.


The third link from above
The third links say Instruction Printer (LPR): "Driver Install"
took me to
http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/instruction_prn3.html
where it says

LPR Driver Install
Follow the 6 steps below to install a driver.

but in step 2 it says
For Debian/Ubuntu 64 bit

but I'm sure my old computer is 32 bit.


So....I'm not sure what to do.  Do I do something with the two files I
have on my desktop, from following the first link.
Am I out of luck based on the fact of not finding the HL-2270DW in the
list that I found folling the second link
Am I out of luck based on the fact that my computer is 32 bit, not 64
bit, as per indicated on the third link.



Also, the printer came with a CD, and instrtuction book, on how to
configure it in Windows, and Mac.  In fact, my friend bought the same
printer, and he uses windows, and I set it up.  It was just a matter
of following the getting started guide that came with the printer.  It
was vapidly easy, and did not take any perspicacity on my part, i.e. I
just clicked through Dialog windows.  The point is I have a disk that
came with the printer.  Maybe what I need for linux is on there, and I
don't know what it is.



The end goal is to get my printer to work wirelessly, and to have
duplex printing, that I can turn on and off as needed.


I don't know what else to do, but I hope I've been sufficiently duly
diligent in trying to figure out how this stuff works, and I hope I've
articulated the efforts I've gone through to such an extent that it
will merit your consideration in helping me.

Sincerely,
Victor Soich


P.S. Below is the review from Newegg.com which helped prompt me to get
this printer, along with the fact that it was a Friday after
Thanksgiving deal.



Pros: High speed, duplexing, great print quality, Unbelievable price,
good support for Linux (even duplexing).

Cons: Cost of toner, but by the time I need to replace the toner
cartridge, I'm confident that prices and sources will be similar to
the current prices and sources for the HL-2170w.

Other Thoughts: I have 40 years in the IT industry, and I'm not in the
habit of reading the instructions, unless all else fails. I changed my
normal habit, for this printer installation, because I had read a
number of reviews that slammed the Brother documented installation
process. I followed the Brother installation process for a wireless
installation exactly, to see if it was truly as bad as some reviews
had said.

To install the printer, you need to connect your pc to the printer,
and 3 methods are described (usb cable, ethernet cable, or ad-hoc
connection). I chose to connect via an ethernet cable, and the
installation process worked flawlessly. The only thing that I felt
wasn't covered was reserving the IP address that was assigned to the
printer. That, of course, was more in the relm of the router than the
printer.

Once the printer was available on the network, I installed drivers on
workstations running winxp, vista, and PCLinuxOS 2010, all without
significant problems.

I ordered a TuxScreen a few years ago, as a little household Linux

I would love to have someone else try to do something interesting with it.
If a PLUGger does not lay claim to it, I will bring it to Dorkbot.

It was designed as a home dialup information-services portal.  It's a

PCMCIA slot.  It runs Inferno and worked when I put it away.

To the bitter regret of Windows monomaniacs everywhere, we
will NOT be cancelling the Linux Clinic on Sunday December 19th
at 1pm at Free Geek, 1731 Southeast 10th Avenue in Portland.

Instead, we will be cancelling software deficits, error messages,
and the lack of drivers for hardware.  We hope to cancel a few
copies of windows, replacing them with Linux installs.  Bring
your computer, but if you scheduled delivery of mice, monitors,
or keyboards, cancel the delivery, we've got plenty.  We also have
plenty of internet connectivity, and lots of distros on CD and
hard disk - if all you need is the latest Ubuntu, you can cancel
that expensive broadband service.

If you are a Linux Guru, we need your help.  Cancel that plane
flight to Nepal, and help your friends achieve software satori.

So, cancel your other plans, and come to Linux Clinic on Sunday!

Keith

P.S.: John Jordan has a key and a code, so if he is not preoccupied
with ICUs rather than CPUs, we can cancel the security alarms.

Since you want to use this as a wireless printer you should not be plugging
it into a usb port. Instead it should connect to the router  via wireless,
or connect it directly to the router via ethernet.
Getting the printer to talk to the router is Operating System independent so
it should be covered in your printer manual.

After you get that part configured then you can configure the laptop to
print to the printer.

Here are instructions for a slightly earlier model, the 2170W that _might_
also work for the 2270DW

Subject: [PLUG] DOCSIS 3.0 modems with telephony not available...
Message-ID: <1292623475.5064.10.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

Anyone have an idea when say the Arris TM722G will be available 
to consumers to buy?  I've looked at docsis 3.0 modems without
telephony and I've noticed a few docsis 2.0 modems on ebay
with telephony, but no docsis 3.0 modems with telephony.

Much over $60, one is talking longer than a year to save money,
but then the rental rates might go up again to say $7/month.

Is it possible while renting Comcast equipment to get credit 
toward purchasing it?

Is it possible to use a docsis 2.0 telephony modem with current
Comcast offerings?

I'm ba-a-ack!

So, I ditched the Cisco Valet and ordered a D-Link DWA-160 wireless
USB adaptor. Just received it from the UPS guy. According to the linux
drivers page (http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Devices/USB), it
should work for me using the ar9170 driver. Simply plugging it in
accomplished nothing, so I don't know what to do now.

According to the page for the driver, it should be included in my
distribution already (Linux 2.6.31.14-0.4-default i68). Is that right?
Assuming it is, what do I do now?

I'm missing something, but I have no idea what.

With some amount of pain, you could use any old modem and go to a third
party VOIP provider, (I use vitelity.net), and a linux based pbx, (I use
freepbx).  Freepbx will run on a very modest pc, although it costs me about
$4/mo for electricity for it.   For a $99 you can get a plug pc, said to be
able to run freepbx using much less power, (let us know how that works).

You will also need a Voip phone (I use a Cisco SPA942).  I haven't had any
luck hooking Freepbx to the analog house phone wiring, although many others
have.  I have had some luck with running ethernet through the old phone
wiring to run a remote Voip phones.

The main advantage is the cost, I pay some cents per minute, and I don't
talk much, so my Voip phone bill is low, less than $10 month.  I just added
another line and it costs $1.50/mo + talk time.  Also, you have more
capabilities, e.g. I email myself the .WAV files of  voicemails that are
left for me.

Hi:

I often notice that Linux packages are labeled (and maybe compiled as)
i386, i586 or i686.
They are all x86 ELF format binaries but is there any difference between
these 3 code names?
I cannot quite tell if there is any difference but it is often a curiosity
of mine.

Thanks

well, we'll need some qualification on the "nothing".  i'm assuming
you mean "the internet didn't magically start flowing into the
laptop", and if that's the case and you did nothing besides plug it
in, there are probably some steps to take before we even start
troubleshooting problems--it needs to get set up first!

but let's see if the system sees it.  after you unplug and replug it
(waiting a minute or so between to be safe), and then run the command
'dmesg' in a terminal and see if the last few lines talk about finding
a device and using the ar9170 driver.  you might go so far as to post
the related lines here for our edification.

if you see some mention of that driver without anything terrifying
(like a kernel panic), then we can go on to the next step:

it's been awhile since i ran suse, but it looks from a cursory google
as though 11.3 (i know, you're on 11.2) uses network manager, so i
guess that'd be a good place to start.  if there isn't a little
network icon somewhere in one of your panels (the bars at the
top/bottom/sides that also probably have a clock and other little
things in them), you might try just running nm-connection-editor from
the command line.  it's pretty intuitive.

if the wireless tab is empty, you might still have to use yast (suse's
old system config tool) to tell the OS to make the device available to
network manager and company.  i think you actually want to run yast2,
and there should be a networking tab in there that you can poke around
in.

if that isn't fruitful, perhaps there is some documentation you could
refer to?  i googled quickly for 'add network device opensuse' and
didn't see anything obvious (that wasn't written in 1999), but i bet
there are docs installed even on your system that address how to do
this so people who don't run your OS aren't trying to guess so much =)

luck++;

> distribution already (Linux 2.6.31.14-0.4-default i68). Is that right?

it's impossible to tell from just that number.  a kernel can be
compiled with or without support for many things.  it seems likely
support is already there, though.

Update:

A lot water has gone under the proverbial bridge. With Russell's assistance,
we got a CD drive functioning, installed Win 98, but it crashed twice
identically, leading us to believe that the newer machine and the older OS
did not want to live together.  After the divorce, I tried installing 98 on
a Gateway 4026GZ.  It installed, but would only operate in safe mode.  It
did not know how to operate the display in anything other than the default.
No matter; the USB did not work either.  I downloaded a generic USB driver
and installed it.  The device manager said all is well with the USB.
However, no life can be detected at the USB connections.  I am calling this
marriage not even begun, unless there is a counselor who can save it.

So, the need remains:  1) Get the scanner to operate from some operating
system (it used to operate on win 98/me.) to prove it can still be done. 2)
If successful, acquire an old laptop which can do 1).  Russell has an old
desktop which may be able to establish the proof of concept.  And I suppose
I could use a desktop, although I'd rather avoid the power and space use
that entails.

I seem to recall in the old dark Windows days, of copying of the files from
the Win98 CD to a folder on a freshly formatted disk.  I would then use a
boot floppy to get access to the drive and start the install from within
that folder.  This may work better because the install configuration is
customized to the machine it is run on, so if you install on one machine
then move the drive to another, it is likely to fail.  This way, you would
also have the files needed to do a clean install should you need to do it
(just don't delete the folder with the files from the CD)

You said virtualbox did not work for some reason. Was it virtualbox-ose or
virtualbox from Oracle? What was the problem? Did you give vmware a try?

A PPD file is a plain text file containing information that a
Postscript driver needs in order to access features of the printer. It
is only a couple pages long and only a small file. Since it is plain
text it is not platform-specific, i.e., there is no such thing as a
"Windows PPD file;" there is just a PPD file that can be used on any
platform. 

Many times the manufacturer will make a PPD file available. Sometimes,
even if the manufacturer did not, you can get one from Adobe.com.
Sometimes you can use a PPD file for a similar printer, although the
result might be that one or two features listed in your print dialog
boxes don't work because they are not available in your printer. Or,
more likely, the PPD file lacks information about features of your
printer so those features are not available.

A long time ago I had a Laserjet 4MV (Postscript) that did not have a
PPD file. I used a PPD file for a Linotronic imagesetter and it worked
fine, although some of the Linotronic options were not available in the
Laserjet.

I googled for a bit and did not find a PPD file for a HL-2270DW.

On the Brother web site I also found .deb files for an LPR driver and a
cupswrapper driver:

http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_prn.html#HL-2170W

Perhaps one of the above will work for you. To install on Ubuntu use
the terminal, navigate to the folder where you downloaded the .deb
file, and do dpkg --install <package>.deb. (Or is that just "install"?
Or "-i"? It's been too long since I used Debian. Use man dpkg.)

Yes, that's what I meant. I plugged it in and waited to see if
anything happened (like a "new USB device found" popup). Nothing that
I could see changed.

Here are the final few lines of the dmesg result:

The networking tab in Yast2 has a long list of programs I could

Oracle.  I did not try vmware.

I had two problems, at least.  First was that from Linux I got inconsistent
USB communications with the scanner.  I used a pci usb card that solved that
problem.  It is possible that the scanner has poorly implemented usb (1.1
perhaps?)

I have less specific notes on what happened within VB, but as I recall the
scanner would respond in some limited way, but then stop. I do not believe I
ever got even a part of a scan.

The frustrating thing is that I used to run the scanner from a dual-booted
machine running 98/me.  It goes against the grain to chuck a good piece of
equipment because the manufacturer will neither support it nor release the
specs so those in the sane community can support it.  Besides, dedicated
slide scanners are available only at the professional level now (>$1000).

Do I understand correctly that the scanner requires USB? 

I spent a few minutes digging this evening and I found my ancient
laptop. Amazingly, it boots Windows 95, just as I left it many years
ago. It still has CorelDRAW 6.0, WordPerfect 5.0, Netscape Gold,
PageMaker 6.0 and some version of MS Office on it. It also has a Xircom
Credit Card Ethernet+Modem 28.8 and an Adaptec APA-1425/50/60 SCSI
card. (At the time I used this laptop I had an HP scanner that required
SCSI.) 

The hinges are cracked, but the screen is fine. It has a CD drive as
well as the floppy, and both are working. I was stunned to discover
that it has a whopping 8 MB of RAM. That's "megabytes." And the hard
drive is 1.2 GB. I even found a PDF of the spec sheet (Texas
Instruments Extensa 570CDT, also sold as Acer 570CDT) and apparently
you can upgrade the RAM to 40 MB. Might even get DSL on this thing. I
can't believe I used PageMaker in 8 MB of RAM. The copyright on the
spec sheet is 1996, to give an idea of the age.

However, much as my memory insisted that it had a USB port, it does
not. One could stick in a PCMCIA adapter, if such an adapter were
available cheaply. It does have a port for an external mouse/keyboard,
though, as well as serial, parallel, and even a VGA out port.

The box it was in also has all the Windows 95 install floppies.

If you can use any or all of the above, let me know. I can easily bring
it to the Clinic Sunday.

What does Yast2 -> Network Devices -> Network Settings

tell you about the new adapter?  Does it show up there?

Quite a piece of history.  Thanks for the offer, but my scanner is USB. From
what I read, USB in that era had some growing pains, so adding another layer
of uncertainty might not be the most efficient approach to getting it
working.  And I will not be able to be at the Clinic this Sunday.

Thanks again,

Yes as to the growing pains. USB was not fully supported until Windows
98, although Windows 95 can handle it also as long as the card
manufacturer created drivers. If I had Windows 98 media I'd try to
install it.

No, it doesn't. I've tried adding it, but whenever I open the Network
Settings again, it's gone (I assume because it isn't being detected).

Subject: [PLUG] Looking For Software to Check A Hard Drive
Message-ID: <AANLkTim44=OcX2TbCtQJHH+Vo4C6Kwh5V4S=RQ1=jipr@mail.gmail.com>

I have an older hard drive (WD1200VE - 120 GB) that use to be in my laptop,
but I ran out of room so I replaced it with a larger drive. I have the
WD1200 in one of those nifty ez-upgrade USB drive enclosures and it mounts
and works just fine. I need some portable back up space, so I thought I
would use this drive. However, I would like to test it (thoroughly, whatever
that means) to see if it has any problems before I use it as a backup drive.
I am looking for either a command line tool or gui that I can run on a
Debian machine to exercise the drive and find any errors. An automated test
suite that I can setup and run in the background (ie does not suck up the
whole machine to run it) for a few hours/days to test the drive, log errors,
fix those errors that can be fixed, etc.

I can't use the WD diags for the drive since my Windows machine will not
recognize the drive in its usb caddy. I looked at bonnie++ and I can't find
a way to tell it to test a usb drive instead of the drive with the root file
system. Bonnie is also a benchmarking program and not really a drive stress
test program.

Any recommendations? I don't care about the data on the drive now, as I have
sucked it all off to my new hard drive.

Thanks!

Try smartctl from the smartmontools package. There are tests you can run 
(short/long) which may be helpful. Also check the Reallocated Sector 
Count and be wary if you see any reallocated sectors.

Keep in mind that a drive can go south with no advance warning 
whatsoever, and the older the drive, the more likely that can happen.

At work we use MHDD, but I personally use seatools if I'm just for a
good/bad evaluation.

http://hddguru.com/software/2005.10.02-MHDD/
MHDD is included on UBCD: http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/
http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/support/downloads/seatools

For most of these, however, you still need a native connection to the
drive (not usb).

   In addition to the other suggestions you can use cfdisk to repartition it,
then run mkfs-ext3 (if that's the filesystem you want to use). The options
-c and -v check for bad blocks and provide verbose output.

Thanks for the link and it has good info.
Next question then is what is the proper #86 type I should using for any
processor if I need/want to compile with the optimal performance?   I have
several boxes and they are various Intel and AMD processors.  Is there a way
to find out for each one of them?

You should simply ignore the problem.  (No, seriously.)

There is close to zero detectable performance difference between
software tuned for an i686 and whatever recent 32-bit system you use;
you actually get better results just using the amd64 mode and taking
advantage of the much higher baseline system spec.

Anything that is going to benefit significantly will tune itself at
runtime to the system, automatically, so you don't need to do anything
by hand.  (Which is basically the kernel, libc, and a couple of crypto
libraries.)

Regards,
    Daniel

Ok, I've looked at that URL I mentioned last night, and I notice that it 
will give you some hints, but it may not solve your problem completely 
either.

Here's what seems to be the case - you don't have the driver installed. 
Until you have the driver you're not going anywhere.

You can get the driver from the URL you originally posted. *But*, as you 
are using SuSE 11.2, I would recommend getting the driver from the online 
openSUSE 11.2 wireless repository, because then SuSE does much of the 
work for you.

If you want to use the openSUSE 11.2 wireless repository, do the 
following:
Yast2 -> Software Repositories -> Configured Software Repositories ->

Add -> Specify URL -> Name = (any arbitrary string), URL = 
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/driver:/wireless/openSUSE_11.2/
-> Next

Now you should be able to bring up the 'Software Management' tab for 
Yast2, search on ar9170, and have it find the firmware that you are 
looking for.  Install it as you would any other software.

Once the drivers are installed, try removing/re-attaching the adapter and 
see what shows up in dmesg and also in Yast -> Network Devices -> Network 
Settings.  (Until the device shows up there, I don't think anything else 
network related will make a difference.)

I don't see any one yet recommending the Drive Fitness Test, it works with
many brands of drives, but I think is made by Hitachi.
It is one of the options available on the Ultimate Boot CD (
www.ultimatebootcd.com), as well as elsewhere.  On the UBCD it is very easy
to use though and you don't have to mess with creating a boot floppy or some
such.  Plus there are many other good tools on there, including other drive
diag tools, memory test, etc.
I used it daily when I was working as a bench tech.

You will need to mount the drive as a secondary, it will not work in a USB
caddy, none of the drive diags I know of work through USB.
Just power down, open the machine, and connect the cables temporarily and
lay the drive down in a convenient spot, run the tests, then power down and
disconnect again.

The DFT has a quick mode, and a long mode.  Quick mode just does a few
checks, long mode does a thorough media analysis.

This is to check the physical drive and not the filesystem, which sounds
like it is what you want.

   Allow me to refine the question:

   How do I tell perl/CPAN that /usr/local/pgsql/include/ exists?

   Something strange going on here. I've upgraded DBD::Pg in the past with no

   Forcing the upgrade of the module didn't work; httpd can't find it.

Use uname.-m.

Odds are that anything made since the late 90s (and 32 bit) will be i686.

I would not dream of calling myself a 'perl expert', but that bit looks 
suspicious.

Are there, in fact, any permissions oddities regarding libpq.so.5?

David,

   Nope. /usr/lib/libpq.so.5 and /usr/local/pgsql/lib/libpq.so.5 are both
soft links to /usr/local/pgsql/libpq.so.5.3. All are owned by root.root, the
links have 777 perms and the actual shared library has 755 perms.

Ok, I'm out of ideas then.

I do notice this bit in the README for the most recent version:

DBD::Pg needs to know where to find the libpq libraries: this is usually done
by checking the output of the pg_config executable. If pg_config is not available,
then you may need to install the development package for PostgreSQL. To do this
on Debian and Ubuntu, use: apt-get install postgresql-dev; on RedHat and CentOS,
use: yum install postgresql-devel. Note that the development libraries are needed
even if you already have PostgreSQL up and running.

   There are no separate 'dev' packages for Slackware; the SlackBuild scripts
build everything. In this case, for reasons not yet known, the SlackBuild
script for postgresql-9.0 did not want to run here with -9.0.1 on the latest
Slackware-13.1. So-o-o, I just built from source.

Thanks, David,

That's actually my thread. :D  I'm "Roy Preston" there.

I've been trying to get help there on the opensuse forums as well as here.

I did as you suggested, and immediately got three auto-suggestions for
software to install, which I did. Then I searched for ar9170, and
found a couple more (the firmware you mentioned), and installed that
as well.

> Once the drivers are installed, try removing/re-attaching the adapter and see what shows up in dmesg and also in Yast -> Network Devices -> Network Settings. ?(Until the device shows up there, I don't think anything else network related will make a difference.)

I still don't see anything in Yast ->Network Devices->Network settings
except the ethernet card. I know the USB port I'm using for the
wireless adapter works--when I plug my Nook into it, it detects the
device and I can interact with it easily. I suppose the (new) wireless
adaptor could be borked, but I don't know how likely that is, or how
to check it. Or what else the problem might be if that isn't it.

I really like my linux box most of the time. But there are times when
I'm frustrated enough to wonder about going back to Windows. Then I
remember what dealing with Windows was like and the feeling eventually
goes away....

What are the results from 'lsusb' and 'iwconfig', assuming these command
utilities are available in Suse.

   The above is the output from /var/log/httpd/error_log.

   When I tried to build and install DBD::Pg via CPAN I was told it could not
find libpq.so.5, even when I tried a forced installation. Today, however,
CPAN tells me that the current version of DBD::Pg is installed, but I cannot
log in to Ledger123; same error messages in the log file.

   We have some perl and httpd experts here so I'm sure this can be quickly
fixed.

TIA,

Rich

Do you see anything in dmesg that would indicate the kernel is recognizing 
the wireless adapter?  This is a different adapter (and a different 
version of SUSE), but something like:

usb 2-2: using firmware atmel_at76c505-rfmd2958.bin (version 1.101.0-86)
wlan0: USB 2-2:1.0, MAC 00:0c:41:5b:38:e6, firmware 1.101.0-86
wlan0: regulatory domain 0x10: FCC (USA)
usbcore: registered new interface driver at76_usb

and if I look in /proc/modules:
# cat /proc/modules | grep at76
at76_usb 79252 0 - Live 0xe11a5000
firmware_class 13696 1 at76_usb, Live 0xe115a000
usbcore 152012 4 at76_usb,usbhid,uhci_hcd, Live 0xe10fe000

I see that the at76_usb driver/kernel module is loaded.

I think this is the crux of the issue here - you've got to get the system 
to load and use the kernel module.

Wireless networking is the part of the Linux experience where newbies can 
get a taste of what it was like running Linux back in the '90s.

   No, but I used to play regularly when I was in the Army and when my son
was living at home. It's a great card game! We should have cribbage nights.

Subject: [PLUG] firefox, updates, and SSL certificates
Message-ID: <20101221040640.GA4533@gate.kl-ic.com>

Does firefox retain added SSL certificates through updates?

A certain very large hospital system, which is not Legacy but
shall otherwise be nameless :-), apparently does not fritter
away money on official certificates.  So, to access their record
systems (via Citrix, probably costing a thousand times as much
as a cert), one must jump through some minor hoopery to import
their SSL certificate into firefox, which I am about to do.

The machines I am doing this on have automated update for firefox.
Will the next firefox update require reimporting the SSL certificate
again?

Should I be ready to do this task the moment the firefox Update Gods
next wave their magic wands, or face the bitter disappointment of
doctor users and the litigious relatives of patients dead because
of delayed labs results?

Are you importing the hospital's CA into firefox? or just setting an
exception for that host to not require a valid SSL cert?

The latter I know for sure is stored in the personal profile settings, and
so would survive an update to firefox. The former, I am not so sure about.

You can get a free cert at startssl.com.

Firefox, and probably other tools.  The hospital is using Citrix,
and that is using the same infrastructure, but it seems to want
the certs someplace in addition to the Firefox certs and exceptions.
I think, not clear yet.  I was doing this in the evening, when the
linux-aware-though-not-skilled folks were at home.  More tomorrow,
perhaps.


> You can get a free cert at startssl.com.

Which may be very useful for my own endeavors, thank you.  Do all
the recent browsers accept these certs?  In the beginning I will
be using them only for protecting encrypted information exchanges
with customers.  Later I (or more accurately, the folks I sell the
business to) will be using them for ecommerce, and will probably
get the high-octane certifications.  I assume startssl certs won't 
interfere with that;  I can simply stop referring to startssl and
start referring to thawte or whoever.

Yes.

I used to edit at an obscure website but later fell out with the owner,
however I still have the CMS certificate in Firefox after upgrading it.

This assumes that you retain your /home/[userid]/.mozilla/* structures.

   Update:

   I removed Pg.pm and asked cpan to install DBD::Pg anew. This is how it
ended:

It's the "probably other tools" that might hang you up.

Different distributions manage server or CA certificates 
idiosyncratically if you need the system OpenSSL libraries to 
recognize the certificate.

Debian: The hard-but-proper way is to put the certificate into the 
/usr/share/ca-certificates hierarchy, edit /etc/ca-certificates.conf 
accordingly, and run /usr/sbin/update-ca-certificates.

(Easier is just to drop the certificate into /etc/ssl/certs and run 
"/usr/bin/c_rehash /etc/ssl/certs".)

RHEL/CentOS: add the certificate to /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt.

Michael,

   There's apparently a checksum error in the downloaded tarball that's
causing the problems. As I know only of CPAN as a source for it I'm kinda'
screwed until it gets fixed.

Some distributions package common CPAN modules for installation
and management through the packaging system (apt, rpm ...) 

Is that
the case for yours?

   No. Pat likes mysql, not postgres. The latter is not included and is not
part of the configuration of php.

   What do you suggest, Chris? I can send /root/.cpan/MIRRORED.BY if that
helps.

Chris,

   I found two other sites with DBD-Pg-2.17.2.tar.gz. Downloaded the tarball
from each, ran 'cksum -v' on each and saw the same checksum and byte count
for each.

   Untarred one, changed to that directory, and tried to start configuring
it. For some reason I get screwy results:

[rshepard at salmo /opt/DBD-Pg-2.17.2]$ perl Makefile.PL
Configuring DBD::Pg 2.17.2
Path to pg_config? /usr/local/pgsql/bin/
Not an executable: '/usr/local/pgsql/bin/'
Path to pg_config? /usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_config
Not an executable: '/usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_config'
Path to pg_config?

   What is the configurator seeking? It doesn't like the path or the fully
qualified file name. What am I supposed to enter here?

Confused,

Rich

how did you extract it? you might have to tell it specifically to preserve
privileges.

alternatively, try:

chmod 755 /usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_config

and then perl Makefile.pl again.

upon re-reading, I think you actually typed /usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_config
into the prompt. try this:

find / -name pg_config

and see if it exists somewhere.

I have a used ASUS pc 900 with Ubuntu installed.  I have searched for a
manual but have been unable to find anything but ones intended for the XP
installation, e.g., E3674, E3922, and the install SOP.  This even though
ASUS lists the manual under Linux.  Did they just not bother, since all
Linux types are experts?  Anybody here have documents related to the 900?

Thanks,

Wes,

   The tarball? 'tar xzvf DBD-Pg-2.17.2.tar.gz'

   Those are the permmissions.

Wes,

   Yes, it does. /bin/pg_config is a link to /usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_config.

   And you're correct: Makefile.PL wants /bin/. Sigh.

I bought a 701 a few years ago, and yes, most of the documentation was
regarding installing and using Windows XP.

If you need information about Linux on the Eeepc series, this might be a
good place to start: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EeePC

Out of curiosity, the EeePC 900 I got my nephew originally came with a
version of Linux that was custom, can't think of the name right now,
and I replaced that with Ubuntu 10.04.  Couple of problems though, first
problem, the laptop doesn't shut down properly and there seems to be no
fix.  You have to unplug it to shut it down.  The minute it is plugged 
in, it boots.  Second problem, the SSD is only about 16gb with a 4gb
portion as well adding up to about 20gb.  The Ubuntu 10.04 install
barely fits.  Has anyone installed a larger SSD into one of these?
A 64 gig SSD should be large enough to accomodate the Ubuntu
installation.

It turns out that Citrix wants the two binary cert files that I
got from the hospital stored in the directory:

   /usr/lib/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts/

Then rename them with a .crt suffix, and set the ownership to
root.sys and the permissions to -r--r--r-- , like the other files
in that directory.  It took a lot of searching around the web,
and trying many incorrect suggestions, to figure that out.  The
last thing that tripped me up was getting the permissions right.

The problem was not related to the browser at all.  One useful
clue was that the error window was rendered by something different
than firefox.  It was helpful that the fix involves moving around
files, as one of the target machines is remote - I could configure
it over the vpn.

A remaining problem is that Citrix wants to render in a smaller
window than my 2048x1536 laptop screen, and won't resize the
characters.  Looks OK on older grainier screens, though.  This
is probably a general problem with windows, running as a Citrix
guest or not, which may be why the high-res screen I retrofitted
to my laptop was surplussed in the first place.  Gads, it must
be painful to design great hardware and have M$ not support it.

I had much more attached hair before I began this process.

Just an aside... 

If you design great hardware for windows, you generally write the drivers as well. You don't depend on free labor (or someone else's dime) to make your hardware work. 

There are exceptions, but that's the general rule.

Message-ID: <4D124389.3060907@TemporalArts.com>

I have an APC SM3000RM3U rackmount UPS that needs new batteries and 
refurbishment or recalibrate/repair.

In the past I have sent such units to Coastal Business Machines for flat 
rate refurbishment but they no longer offer that service.

I found a bunch that will sell me a new or refurbished UPS but only a 
couple that will refurbish mine.

The couple I found so far that will refurbish/repair are on the east 
coast and shipping is $100 each way (almost as much as the refurbish).

Can anyone recommend a local or somewhat local (ie west coast) vendor 
that can refurbish or refresh/recalibrate an APC UPS?

   Check Northwest Battery Supply at 3750 SE Hawthorne. They have (or can get) the
batteries but I've no idea if they can do the other work. (503) 232-9002.

I was unclear.  It is not a driver issue, it is a kernel/OS issue,
that kept NEC from peddling these screens.  I'm not sure of the
details, but WinXP itself would not pass the information from the
apps to the drivers so they could render such high pixel screens.

Remember, this was not too long after the bad old days of DOS and
the early Windoze, when applications needed to drive the graphics
cards directly.  That is how Mentor Graphics got started, as a
graphics display company which had to write the applications that
could use its displays. 

If such limits appeared with X, we would find the offending code
in the server code, fix it, and send a patch.  Then return to
writing our driver modules.  Similar limits slowed the adoption
of Bluetooth, whose first implementations were in Linux.  A lot
of cancelled projects because of that.

Back to Citrix, there may be some control knobs to twiddle that
control window size, so I can bound the screen area that it uses,
perhaps even do magnification.  More experimentation needed.

Can C.B.M. suggest a former competitor?  If you are a former
customer, it would be polite to help you on your way, and if
they had competition, they (at least the back room geeks,
not the receptionist) probably know who.

If you can find the manual online, perhaps an underemployed
power engineering graduate of PSU could "calibrate for food".
Chances are, all that is necessary is changing the batteries,
then making some output and load measurements, verifying spec
performance.  Unless it has been giving you other troubles,
no adjustments are likely to be needed.

---

Generalizing this, it would be nice if Portland had a parts and
services wiki, where we could add or correct detailed information
about who provides what.  Just yesterday, a friend was asking
about a power cord with a C19 connector, and I successfully
pointed him at Surplus Gizmos and PCH Cables.  Normally, I
have less luck.  I have called around locally for items like
check valves for condensation pumps, and resorted to $$$ 3 day
shipments from Amazon.  I know somebody, somewhere in Portland,
has a usable check valve or power cord in their parts bin, but
finding out who is hard.

The next few years will be economically challenging for many
of us.  We won't be able to afford new replacements, we must
repair the old stuff instead.  Information about help and
materials might really make a difference to our wellbeing. 
Making local vendors more visible, enabling them to profitably
sell low-runner repair items to a couple million locals, would
help them prosper and create jobs.

It could even lead to the local delivery service we talked
about earlier.  Imagine a clever person looks at digital photo
of a broken item, figures out who has the stuff to fix it, and
arranges for the informal delivery network to pick up the broken
item at point A, the repair part at point B, deliver them to a
repairperson at point C, and return the repaired item back to A.
More stuff fixed, less resources used, less repairables in the
landfill, etc.

Any web designer/providers want to take a stab at that?

I had a business in Portland for years to service bigger U.P.S. & Emergency
Lighting Units.
90% is the replacement of the batteries.    I would be willing to look at
any other service if that doesn't fix it.

On the few smaller units that I did work on, if it ran a load for a few
minutes, it was 'good to go'.   The chance that the frequency or voltage is
off and it still runs at all when on battery is really very very low.

Cool.  That tells us it's a version A2 stick, which is different.
(Nice of them to keep the same model number!)

It may work if you install the compat-wireless package.
You might also want to check around the results from:

BTW, what are you using for an email client?  Does it have a "Reply" function?

Message-ID: <20101223023400.GA11025@gate.kl-ic.com>

I used to use a tool called youtube-dl to download youtube video. 
Not lately.  I tried it on this: 
    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyviyF-N23A
(The Hallelujah Chorus "performed" by an Alaskan Inuit village).  

youtube-dl throws format errors.  Same with this related video:
    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXh7JR9oKVE&feature=fvwk
(Hallelujah Chorus sung by a food court flash mob). 

So I am assuming the download tool is broken. 

The kludgy workaround is to play the video in a browser, and do:

  ffmpeg -i /tmp/Flash* outputfile.mpg

(where Flash* is the video you just played in /tmp)

But it would be nice to have a command line tool that does it all.
What do the Kool Kidz use these days?

I'm not certain I'm Kool, but I do still prefer youtube-dl.  It gets
updated quite frequently, mostly because it breaks every few months.
I'm not sure why, but I imagine it's a continual game of cat-and-mouse
with Google. The example URL you provided works with the current

It's called Download Helper. It adds a menu item in Firefox under
Tools. I just downloaded the Hallelujah Chorus as .flv file, which I
can play with Totem, VLC or Gxine. 

Does that make me a kool kid?

Subject: [PLUG] Testing for hardware failure on dual layer DVD
Message-ID: <20101223005321.4f780f39@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I rarely use the dual layer feature of the DVD drive in my laptop, but
this evening I needed to for the first time in over a year. Regardless
of whether I use K3b or Brasero I get errors and the burn process
fails. 

The drive continues to burn regular DVDs and CDs just fine.

Considering that two different packages refuse to burn dual layer DVDs,
either there is a common library they share that is buggy, or there is
a hardware failure. The drive has had a lot of use over the past couple
of years, so I'd like to rule out hardware failure first. Does anyone
have any suggestions for how I can do that?

Oh, it's a Thinkpad T61 with Fedora 14/Gnome, x86_64. The last time I
burned a dual layer DVD I was running Jaunty x86_64.

This is a kernel problem. You say you are using openSuse 11.2 with a 2.6.31
kernel. OpenSuse 11.3 is out with a 2.6.34 kernel. Upgrading your kernel
within 11.2 or upgrading to 11.3 is likely to solve your problem.

Ah - that's where it went!  The latest version works fine, thanks.
I will also try out a few of those firefox plugins, though I normally

some way to have a loaded version and a lean version of firefox in

If Firefox didn't insist on a browser restart each time you
enable/disable/install/uninstall something then I'd suggest just using
the enable/disable buttons built into the Firefox add-on manager.

There is a "safe mode" ("firefox -safe-mode") which disables
extension, themes, etc.  Unfortunately it comes with a dialogue box
that shows up each time you have to click through.  Otherwise it's
pretty snappy.

I assume you're already familiar with multiple profiles.  If not then
a solution worth considering would be to create multiple profiles
("firefox -P <PROFILE_NAME>"), but then you have the issue of separate
bookmarks, separate browser history, cookies, etc.  This could be
addressed by symlinking some files from one profile to another (i.e.
bookmark*, places.sqlite and cookies.sqlite) but not stuff relating to
extensions.  I just tried this with symlinks and it seems to work.
Risks include (1) upon a Firefox upgrade, config files for one profile
getting upgraded which then bleeds into the other and makes the other
no longer loadable.  (2) running multiple profiles simultaneously
corrupts something.

A more conservative approach to the above might be to create a wrapper
script that copies/rsyncs relevant data from one profile to another
before starting.  Provided you make a backup of the original files
(1-2 MB) before overwriting then you should be able to recover in the
event of a corrupt profile.

I've been using ClipGrab [1], a cross-platform GUI app that downloads
from YouTube, DailyMotion, Vimeo and possibly a few other video sites.
 It's been working great on Ubuntu Lucid and Windows 7.  In the past,
I've used clive [2], a command-line tool that also works with multiple
video sites.  Can't speak to how the latter is working lately, but it
worked fine in the past except for one period during which YouTube had
made some changes that rendered clive useless.

Those are a couple of non-browser specific options, if you want to
keep away from browser plugins.

Message-ID: <AANLkTinP2vU9FYbHDz=J+00E-U2Ek49twuaYHPnn4GbY@mail.gmail.com>

I seem to have an eee pc 900 that has gotten into a snit.  Does anybody here
have the original disks I could borrow?  This was originally an XP machine,
but a previous owner installed Ubuntu 9.04.  It is now only partially
functional.

I gather from the documents I have downloaded from ASUS that the XP machine
comes with 16G, the linux comes with 20G drives.  The disks for the latter
provide for installing XP, but the former does not provide for installing
linux.  Which disks would be most helpful to me is unclear.

Alternatively, I could install some Linux which is tailored for the SSD
which this machine has.  I would prefer Ubuntu, since that is what I
am accustomed to.  I also need to update the BIOS, but I do not want to
chance messing that up, so I want to get the machine in a stable state
first.

if you're going to get rid of the existing install anyway, why not
install the current ubuntu, which you can download yourself?  you have
a choice of 'netbook remix' which is what you may want if you were the
person who just wanted to use it to surf and edit documents--it's
simple and stripped down.  however, i run full/regular ubuntu on my
netbook and it works fine...but my netbook is also a little more
capable than yours, too (10"  1366 x 768 screen, 320G hard drive, 2G
ram).

unless you want to install xp, i'd stay away from the original disks
entirely--any linux should boot just fine on the thing, netbook-aware
or not.

current ubuntu should boot blazingly fast from that disk.  probably in
under 10 seconds.  they severely optimized the boot process in 10.4
(april) and i would suspect it is at least as good in the latest 10.10
release.  i'm not sure in what other way (that would be meaningful on
such an otherwise underpowered machine) someone would "optimize" for
the ssd.  even a complete ubuntu install shouldn't take even 16GB, and
you don't sound to need a complete install (developer tools, games,
etc)

one usually updates the bios independently of the linux install, with
a usb stick containing freedos or similar.  or anyway, this one does
=)

My understanding is tailoring for SSD takes into account that there is a
limit on the number of writes the drive can handle.  I would expect that
involves choices in the kernel.  Speed is not the issue. If the netbook
remix does that, I will choose it.

I realize the BIOS is independent of the OS, but the manuals describe
getting to the start of the BIOS upgrade through the OS.  How do I do it
with a broken OS?  I have the new BIOS file.  Is just adding it to a
bootable thumb drive all that is needed?

I'm not aware of any version of linux that installs or behaves
differently as regards write endurance on SSD's.  i am not an expert
though, perhaps someone else on this list knows of one.

the linux kernel, starting with 2.6.33, knows about and uses the TRIM
command (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIM_(SSD_command)), so you'll
want something with either a kernel at least that new or one with that
feature backported to it (backporting features like these is less
likely in my experience, outside of the redhat/centos world).

from some cursory googling on eeepc 900 and ssd write endurance, it
seems unlikely that you'll trip over write endurance actually being a
problem--for one, the drive in that machine is said to have 3%
capacity set aside for relocating failing sectors (which the
drive/controller handles independently of OS), plus be rated at either
10k or 100k writes per cell before failure.  to hit 100k writes, you'd
have to write the same block 30x/day for 8 years (i stole all this
info from http://forum.eeeuser.com/viewtopic.php?id=25304, didn't
verify any of it).

everyone's different, but as a gambling man who likes good odds, i
wouldn't worry about the SSD failing in a way that you or even linux
will notice (automatic failure/relocation of sectors by the drive will
not be communicated even to the linux kernel).  i don't know about
you, but my usage patterns aren't rewriting the same file over and
over again (or if i do, i am backing up my Magnum Opus frequently to
somewhere offsite).  the worst offender on a system like the eeepc
will probably be swap if you run enough apps to have it swapping, but
these machines are slow enough without swapping that i went and bought
more ram as soon as i started hitting swap..it was cheap ($30) and now
i typically can run 2 VM's simultaneously (windows, so, bloated!) and
still have good interactive performance.

all that said, make frequent backups to another machine.  frankly i'd
say loss/theft of the entire laptop, or operator error are more likely
causes of actual data loss.

depends on the machine/BIOS.  in your case, it appears that is just about it:

OpenWrt is quite good about avoiding writes to media.  OpenWrt has X,

suggesting that Denis do that, as the user experience would be quite

   Turns out that the perl module was not the source of the problem.
Permissions on /usr/local/pgsql/* were 700 and need to be 755 (except for
the data/ subdirectory). I obviously either changed the permissions
inadvertently or had not set them properly after upgrading postgres.
Regardless, all works now.

Update:

I discovered more programs that won't launch, and each one gives the
same error message about the missing nvidia file. The total now includes
Fontmatrix, KDE System Monitor (ksysguard), VirtualBox (Oracle),
Avidemux Video Editor, and Mplayer.

Finally I gave up and reinstalled the nVidia driver. I did it from the
rpmfusion repository rather than download it from nvidia.com and
install with their script. However, I did not enable it; I am still
using the nouveau driver. Nevertheless, all the above programs launch
and run normally now. 

I suppose I should uninstall the nVidia driver now to see if the above
programs will still launch. But I think I no longer care.

Subject: [PLUG] Need mdadm help
Message-ID: <20101225224326.5047e9e8@mailhost.pdx.edu>

Back in the days when Hardy was the reigning desktop distro I built
myself a new desktop computer. I used two matching 320 GB drives and
set them up as four partitions with RAID 1 (mirror) using mdadm. I wish
I hadn't done that. Now I wish remove one of the drives, in effect, undo
the RAIDs. Unfortunately it has been about three years since I created
the RAID and now I can't make heads or tails of the mdadm man page. I
must have been a lot smarter three years ago.

Worse, I upgraded Hardy to Intrepid, and during the dist-upgrade the
boot information was written to only one of the disks. I can boot, but
only if I scroll down in the Grub menu and choose the previous kernel.
Trying to boot to the current kernel gives me a Grub error 15. I have
ignored this problem for a long time because the computer gets rebooted
only if there is a power failure. This means that if I want to preserve
the existing installation I have to figure out which partition (SDA1 or
SDB1) has the correct boot information.

There are four arrays:
	SDA1 and SDB1 - 45 GB EXT3 boot and /
	SDA2 and SDB2 - 2 GB swap
	SDA3 and SDB3 - 20 GB EXT3 unused
	SDA4 and SDB4 - 235 GB EXT3 old data, unneeded

1) For starters, how can I figure out the names I gave the arrays?

2) Once I know the names of the arrays I might be able to figure out
how to remove one partition from each array, but how can I figure out
which one (between SDA1 and SDB1) has the correct boot information?

I hope someone can help me figure out what I did and how to change it.

mdadm --query should be able to get you the array name at least if my
interpretation of the man page is correct. In terms of which device has the
correct boot information it might be a matter of trail and error, if you
unplug sdb and works then you know that logically it should be sda that has
the correct boot information.

Thanks for the reply.

At the moment it is running Mint 10 live, but soon I will reboot to
Ubuntu and give mdadm --query a try.

After I posted that last night I decided to do dist-upgrades to bring
it up to Lucid (was Intrepid). The upgrade to Jaunty went OK, but the
upgrade to Karmic messed up the video driver (nVidia proprietary). At
this point it's so messed up (can't get anything to work except VESA)
that I might just reinstall. Hence why I am running Mint live - distro
shopping. 

Normally I hate reinstalls because it takes a week of messing around
getting all my apps put back and things tweaked the way I want them.
But this computer is only for streaming internet radio stations,
watching videos and as a means to get on the internet in case I mess up
my laptop. It doesn't need much more than a stock install.

I'll try a bit more to fix the RAID, but after sleeping on it I've
decided it's not worth a lot of effort.

Subject: [PLUG] USB Camera problem, encountered and resolved (I think)
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1012261307140.5879@grond.sourballs.org>

System: OpenSUSE 11.3, 2.6.34.7-0.5-default kernel, 32-bit.

After upgrading to 11.3, I could no longer connect to or download images 
from my Canon PowerShot A520.

The camera would be detected by the kernel:

  Dec 26 10:57:00 grond kernel: [183973.604037] usb 2-1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 19
  Dec 26 10:57:00 grond kernel: [183973.768988] usb 2-1: New USB device found, idVendor=04a9, idProduct=30c1
  Dec 26 10:57:00 grond kernel: [183973.768997] usb 2-1: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=0
  Dec 26 10:57:00 grond kernel: [183973.769004] usb 2-1: Product: Canon Digital Camera
  Dec 26 10:57:00 grond kernel: [183973.769009] usb 2-1: Manufacturer: Canon Inc.

and both digikam and gphoto2 could auto-detect the camera.  But when I 
tried to connect to download, digikam gave me a very generic "Could not 
connect to camera. Is it turned on?" sort of error message.

I started digikam from the command line, and that at least gave me a 
useful error message:

  $ digikam
  digikam(16200)/kdecore (KSycoca): Trying to open ksycoca from "/home/dcf/.kde4/cache-grond/ksycoca4"
  "Warning: You do not seem to have the package gstreamer0.10-plugins-good installed.
           Some video features have been disabled."

[...snip...]
  Model: Time elapsed: 36 ms
  libusb couldn't open USB device /dev/bus/usb/002/012: Permission denied.
  libusb requires write access to USB device nodes.

and sure enough, the permissions on /dev/bus/usb/002/012 were 664 
root:root.

I could do several things here, none of which I liked:

* I could run digikam as root.
* I could add my user to the root group.
* I could, as root, change the permissions on the device node. But 
the nodes are generated dynamically by udevd, and I would have to change 
the permissions every time I plugged in the camera.

Thanks to this thread 
(http://forums.opensuse.org/english/get-help-here/hardware/432915-opensuse-11-2-system-locks-up-when-using-usb-mouse.html), 
I began to have some idea of how to configure udevd. After about an hour 
of man page scanning and examination of existing config files, I created 
my own file,
/etc/udev/rules.d/57-gphoto.rules:

  $ cat 57-gphoto.rules
  # Stolen from:
  # HPLIP udev rules file for HP printer and all-in-one products.
  #
  ACTION!="add", GOTO="canon_rules_end"
  SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", GOTO="canon_a520_pid_test"
  SUBSYSTEM!="usb_device", GOTO="canon_rules_end"

  LABEL="canon_a520_pid_test"

  # Check for Canon PowerShot A520
  ATTR{idVendor}=="04a9", ATTR{idProduct}=="30c1", OWNER="root",  GROUP="users", MODE="0666"

  LABEL="canon_rules_end"


I still don't fully understand the udev configuration syntax, but after 
creating the above file and restarting udevd, the dynamically generated 
device nodes had the ownership and permissions I wanted:

  grond:/etc/udev/rules.d # find /dev/bus/usb -exec ls -ld {} \;
  drwxrwxrwx 4 root root 80 Dec 24 07:50 /dev/bus/usb
  drwxrwxrwx 2 root root 80 Dec 26 11:06 /dev/bus/usb/002
  crw-rw-rw- 1 root users 189, 148 Dec 26 11:06 /dev/bus/usb/002/021  <-- camera mounted here
  crwxrwxrwx 1 root root 189, 128 Dec 24 07:50 /dev/bus/usb/002/001
  drwxrwxrwx 2 root root 60 Dec 24 07:50 /dev/bus/usb/001
  crwxrwxrwx 1 root root 189, 0 Dec 24 07:50 /dev/bus/usb/001/001

...and digikam works fine again.

My questions now are, (1) is there a better way to do this, and (2) why 
would this have broken, when before it Just Worked?

David,

   I had problems syncing my Treo 700p with jpilot after upgrading from
Slackware-12.2 to -13.1. I added new udev rules for it because it's always
seen by the kernel as /dev/ttyUSB1, but that device doesn't exist until the
Treo is plugged into its cable.

   It turns out that there's a more generic, better way. I added my username
to the dialout group and now udev automagically sees the correct device and
allows me to sync the handheld to the desktop. In Slackware udev has taken
completely over from HAL for identifying new hardware and figuring how to
talk to it. Perhaps OpenSuSE is the same.

   As to why it broke: udev has undergone major surgery the details of which
I do not know, nor do I care to know and now works quite differently from
before.

Happy holidays,

The addition of udev rules has been a pain in the ass for me. I keep 
maybe a dozen hards disks in mobile docks but only have a few computers. 
When I put a disk into a different computer, udev rules prevent the 
network from working and prevent the CDROM / DVD drive from working. The 
answer in Slackware has been to delete 
/etc/udev/rules.d/persistant-whatever-is-not-working and reboot.

I guess udev rules were good for folks running servers who wanted to 
make sure that eth0, for example was always on a particular network 
interface card.

It will be pain in the ass for my customers who may have several 
computers in use at various locations in their production plants and one 
spare computer into which they used to install the mobile dock / disk 
from the computer that failed. Luckily it doesn't happen often.

I suspect the udev rules are good for the people working on the udev 
project.  Some days I get the feeling that Linux systems developers write 
software to work the way they think it ought to, without regard to 
anything so piddling as 'use cases' or 'ease of use'.

Yeah, must be nice, writing indecipherable, undocumented software and 
getting paid for it.

(slaps forehead)

wait, that's what *I* do!

BTW, if you think udev is bad, I assume you've never had to tangle with 
PolicyKit.  <shudder>

OK.  10.04 is now installed.  I made a bootable thumb drive using UNetbootin
and the iso I had.

Now to update the BIOS.  The link says to use a drive formated and bootable
in fat 16.  I have been trying to figure out how to do that.  I used
unetbootin to install freedos on a thumb drive, and it boots, but I do not
know how to find out what file format unetbootin used, and am uncertain what
to do with the BIOS file.  Is the BIOS file an executable that DOS will know
how to launch?

For the OS install I felt OK venturing into unknown territory--getting the
eee to boot to the thumb was an experience, but I am not feeling
adventuresome with the BIOS--mistakes there can be fatal.

What do you recommend?

Thanks,
-Denis

i'd use mkdosfs -F 16 to make a fat16 filesystem.  it is rather
unlikely that unetbootin used fat16 since that's not so great for
large partitions.

my reading of the blog post is that it is a bios file which the bios
will load and know what to do with.  i don't think you need dos
(bootable or otherwise) anywhere in the equation.

> What do you recommend?

i've never updated a bios like yours before.  all i know about how it
will work is in that blog post.  you might try asking this question on
one of the eeepc users' forums or otherwise poke around in them--it is
almost certain the question has come up more than once in the past.
but i thought the blog post was pretty straightforward already, so
your mileage my vary.

Nowhere in that post does it say you are booting off the usb stick.

Well, a dope slap is in order.  Somehow I had it in my head that I needed to
boot from the stick.  Once I has that thought, I could not see going on
without a bootable stick.

So it should be simple now that I have all the pieces and my head screwed on
correctly.

Thanks again.

I hope you're reading the list, because I don't have your e-mail
address.

I just discovered the coolest PDF tool: xournal. It's in the regular
Fedora repositories, so probably it is in the Ubuntu repositories as
well. If you can't find it in the repositories it is available at
xournal.sourceforge.net.

You can use xournal to markup any old PDF file. "Markup" includes
adding lines, shapes or text. The tools include Eraser (doesn't work
on text), Pen, Highlighter and Text. Text can be in any of several
colors and you can use any font installed on your computer. You can
place the markups anyplace on the document. When you finish making your
markups you can export as a new PDF, or you can print it out. Since you
can export as a new PDF you could just mark up a PDF and e-mail it
back to the people you got it from.

It is perfect for filling in the blanks on forms that you get as PDF
files, even if the PDF file was not created as an editable PDF form.

It was actually created originally as a note-taking application, but
the PDF editing features are what I will use it for.

Thank you ... don't know if your intended target has seen this as yet, 
but I found the application included in the Mandriva 2008.0 distro 
(version 0.4.2.1) ... I like it

Well, mdadm --query fails because I didn't specify a device. Of
course, that is the whole problem. 

What I really need is a command to sync the two drives so they are
equal. I can't figure that out from the man page either. But if I can
figure out how to do it, then I can later just remove one drive (e.g.,
all the B drives) of each of the four partitions. Then I should be able
to use gparted to grow the 45 GB "A" boot and / drive by adding the
other A drives to it. 

I got the video on Karmic fixed (had two nVidia drivers installed that
were competing with each other), so fixing and undoing the RAID is my
current plan.

The latest version is 0.4.5, which was in the Fedora repos. I think you
can get it from the Sourceforge page.

I like it too. Very handy. There is another one as well, "Jarnal" or
something like that, but it is older and written in Java.

The correct command is "cat /proc/mdstat," since the arrays are
maintained in mdstat, which is just a text file. 

Turns out my arrays are named md0 to md3, and the query command goes
"mdadm --query /dev/md0" etc., although --detail gives better results.
And it appears that md1 is the bad one. 

The md1 array is composed of /dev/sda1 and /dev/sdb1, but the --detail
command says that /dev/sda1 has been removed. 

I'm trying to get my head around why removing /dev/sda1 would give me
the symptoms I am having. The only problem is that each dist-upgrade
installs a new kernel option in the Grub menu, but I cannot boot to
anything but the last Hardy kernel. Selecting any of the newer kernels
gives me a Grub error -15. So what did these dist-upgrades do, write a
kernel to a non-existent disk?

It's trivially easy once you figure out how. All had to do was:

mdadm /dev/md1 -a /dev/sda1 # the -a means "add"

It took half an hour to rebuild the array. When I rebooted I could boot
into the new kernels without a Grub error -15. 

I still don't understand exactly why. But it's fixed. I think.

And it's currently dist-upgrading to Lucid. Later I'll disassemble the
arrays. But that's an exercise for another day.

Standard on Linux is that root can read any file on the local file
system.  Unfortunately, to get OpenDNS to update via ddclient, you
have to know the username and password of the account that needs
updating.  Is it possible to connect a password to ddclient.conf 
or better yet require entry of the password in the file before it
can be opened?  Basically, what I am interested in is password
protecting a single file and requiring that even the super user
enter that password to access it, unless the super user wants to
delete it.  This way, in a sense, there can be more than one superuser
and it becomes possible to delegate maintenance of OpenDNS for example
to someone else.

Frankly, I think it is stupid that you can't ask the OpenDNS servers 
to update an account without logging in to that account, hint hint.
OpenDNS should be asking for the host name assigned to ones dynamic ip
address instead of the current ip anyways.

No.  At least, not without something like SELinux, which root would
ultimately be able to work around anyhow unless you invest ... an
awful lot of time and effort in security.  (eg: also lock down any way
to bypass SELinux, and raw device access, and segment off software for
security, and prevent network sniffing, and so on and so on.  Not
impossible, just a *lot* of work.)

If they permitted that, and didn't use some password-equivalent, then
anyone could change your settings, right?  I could do that just by
guessing your non-secret account name or whatever...

> That's the whole idea behind sudo.

Well, the whole "delegate limited authority" thing is, yeah.  It
doesn't solve the protection of the file, but it allows you to write
something that has limited capabilities that you can give to another
user so that they can interact with OpenDNS but not obtain access to
the credentials.

Not that this is trivial to do either, but less hard than securing the
file itself. :)

Subject: [PLUG] Palimpsest v. e2fsck v. ?
Message-ID: <20101227230208.583df633@mailhost.pdx.edu>

Having just finished various dist-upgrades of my desktop from Intrepid
to Lucid, and healed a sick RAID in the process, after booting to Lucid
I am presented with a warning that disk failure is imminent. The disk
in question is not part of a RAID; it is a 1 TB disk that I added
separately. The disk has always been empty, so there is no worry about
losing stuff. 

The warning comes from Palimpsest, the new GUI disk utility that comes
with Lucid. I launched Palimpsest as root so I could use its GUI to see
if I could fix the drive. After unmounting it I clicked on the Check
Filesystem button. Palimpsest then reported in a popup window
that the disk was clean, while the main window still insisted that disk
failure was imminent. According to the Smart Data window the
Reallocated Sector Count is in red and labeled as failing, also the
Airflow Temperature, which it reports as 49C. 

While wondering about these reports I reformatted the drive as ext4 (the
Lucid default, evidently). The reformat went fine without errors.

At that point I concluded that Palimpsest was given to prevarication.
But just to be sure I decided to run e2fsck on the disk. This gave me
a strange error message:

Superblock invalid, trying backup blocks ...
Bad magic number in super-block while trying to open /dev/sdc
The superblock could not be read or does not describe a correct ext2
filesystem. If the device is valid and it really contains an ext2
filesystem (and not swap or ufs or something else), then the superblock
is corrupt, and you might try running e2fsck with an alternate
superblock:
	e2fsck -b 8193 <device>

First, note that e2fsck thinks it is looking for an ext2 filesystem. I
read all the way through the e2fsck man page looking for an option to
specify a particular filesystem, but couldn't find it.

Second, "8193" is the number to use if the block size is 1K, 16384 for
filesystems with 2K block sizes, and 32768 for 4K block sizes. So
before I try to fix the superblock I need to figure out what the block
size is. The Palimpsest GUI doesn't say, and I don't know how to find
out from the command line. 

This is not an urgent matter, but if the drive is really failing I'd
like to know so I can return it to Maxtor for replacement.

Any suggestions welcome.

The answer to that is simple: the "Reallocated Sector Count" is the
number of failed sectors on the disk surface that the firmware has
replaced with good sectors from the pool of spare space it uses.  The
airflow temperature is, as you would imagine, the highest temperature
the disk has run at.

Both of those are properties of the physical hardware, not of the
content - so checking the file system does nothing about those
underlying faults.

> At that point I concluded that Palimpsest was given to prevarication.

Nope.  It is honestly telling you that this disk has run hotter than
the manufacturer thinks is safe, and that it is showing significant
problems with the disk surface.

ext2, 3, and 4 are occasionally referred to as ext2 by the tools
because they all descend directly from each other, so are close enough
that the code is common.  Don't worry about that tiny mislabelling.

My magic says '4K', because everything gets formatted that size these
days.  Theoretically you can use tune2fs to ask ... but that needs the
superblock.  Your best bet is to throw away the faulty disk ^W^W^W^W
try a non-destructive fsck with 4K, and then try 1K if that doesn't
work.

It absolutely, without question is: every increment of that
"Reallocated Sector Count" is another bad sector on the disk.  (My
guess is that your fsck failure was another bad sector, unluckily
placed, and another format would "fix" it for a while, but there are
other causes.)

Anyway, the disk is really dying, and the software format is way too
high level to ever come close to touching the root of the problems. :)

No, sudo does not keep root from accessing a file without entering  
another password.  The feature I am talking about would establish a  
second superuser that is higher than the standard superuser for one  
specific file.  The exception would be deletion, the ordinary  
superuser should be allowed to
delete the uniquely protected file.  The root account on a standard  
Linux system, especially when selinux is disabled, can manipulate any  
file.

As far as the comment that a login has to be required by OpenDNS to
protect the system, if the system tracked the host name registered with say
dyndns.org, logging in to achieve an update would be completely unnecessary.

An alternative approach is to modify ddclient so that it saves the password
in salted form instead of unencrypted in a text file.  This way, the password
has to be unsalted by a random person for that person to know it.

I expected that googling on the model number would take me to Maxtor's
web site, but I ended up at Seagate instead. It oughtta be illegal for
companies to buy out other companies, I tell ya.

Anyway, the web site has a system for generating an RMA form. It almost
worked too. It turns out that it can't find my combination of model and
serial numbers. More importantly, it needs a failure code from a
Seagate diagnostic tool ("SeaTool"). Naturally, there is no Linux
version of the tool. However, they also offer a bootable CD image with
SeaTool on it (uses FreeDOS, by the way). I downloaded and burned it
and am currently running the diagnostics. It passed the "short" test,
and now I'm 12% (20 minutes) into the "long" test. Doing a little quick
head math tells me it will take way past my bedtime to finish, so we'll
see in the morning.

I can understand the request but you could in theory lock root down or
create a user who has root like privileges using sudo instead of
manipulating the system with root itself.

It is an interesting topic nonetheless.

I'm using Gmail, but my subscription to the PLUG list was set to

reset it to send me individual messages now, though, so my replies

I've run into a paradox trying to filter Comcast cable residential
service.  I am trying to filter via OpenDNS with multiple categories
selected.  A paradox arises when I need to use the credentials
for an OpenDNS account to realign that account to a different IP
address.  These credentials give me the power to turn filtering
off as well.  So the paradox in a nutshell: lacking the credentials 
means no filter in the event of a global IP change whereas 
having the credentials means no filter because of the possibility 
of turning filtering off.  Concerning the question of have the
credentials or don't have them, there isn't an answer.  Regardless, 
I'm potentially not filtered.  If I try to enlist someone else to be
responsible for the credentials, this isn't a good solution.  First
problem, ddclient needs the credentials in a text file unencrypted.
Second problem, any precautions this other person might take to keep 
me from learning the password will in theory delay updating of the
relevant OpenDNS account.  Failing to update is equivalent to not
filtering at all.

A Comcast static IP address evidently runs $20/month.  This seems like 
highway robbery, but there is no other cable provider that I know of in
Columbia County.  This is a way to solve the problem, but at what cost?

One way to approach this problem is a server that is controlled by
someone else which is responsible for running ddclient 24x7.  This 
needs to be a low power server and it probably needs to be no fancier
than a 486.  I say 486 because support of the 386 is rapidly being
dropped.  I also want this server to have a small footprint, I'm 
talking less than 1U and not as deep as the typical rack mountable
server.  I'm thinking a 16 gig or 64 gig SSD instead of a hard 
drive to improve reliability and reduce both power consumption and 
heat production.  If the power consumption is less than 15 watts or
better yet in the milliwatt range, great.  Built in battery backup, 
I'm thinking Lithium ION AA batteries, a plus.  The server should run
headless where it makes more sense to access it over network via VNC
than via a local monitor and keyboard.  Anyone have any ideas?

With the detail supplied, indeed that is true.  I wasn't aware of the
details of how it was being used when I made the comment. :)

That isn't "salted" - which is a couple of random plain-text
characters at the start of the password, so that the hash is not
recoverable with a simple dictionary / rainbow table attack.

What you probably mean is "hashed", which is a one-way transformation
that cannot reasonably be reversed.  Which, for this sort of service,
is useless: if it is recorded and useful without someone entering the
password, it is a password-equivalent, so you don't need to steal the
original, just grab that.

If it does require a password entered, why bother asking?

For what that is worth. :)

That's what the 2 in e2fsck stands for.  There is a separate program for ext4 systems:
michael at bivy:~$ ls /sbin/fsck*
/sbin/fsck         /sbin/fsck.ext2  /sbin/fsck.ext4     /sbin/fsck.minix  /sbin/fsck.nfs
/sbin/fsck.cramfs  /sbin/fsck.ext3  /sbin/fsck.ext4dev  /sbin/fsck.msdos  /sbin/fsck.vfat


Use fsck.ext4 and see what the results are.

Logrotate is run from a system crontab (CentOS, Redhat, Fedora, etc. at 
least) and reads the /etc/logrotate.conf file each time.

Check for a directory /etc/cron.daily with a file logrotate in it.

I copied down every word of the log generated by the SeaTools utility
in case I need to send it to Seagate. The relevant parts are the last
three lines:

DST -- FAILED - Unknown
Short DST FAILED	12/28/2010 @ 20:12.13
Long Test PASSED	12/28/2010 @ 20:12.13

I don't know what "DST" means, but I do understand "FAILED."

Now to get hold of Seagate and get the RMA form. Thanks to all for the
advices.

Couldn't get the website RMA generator to work, but their telephone
worked fine. Only a couple minutes on hold. The nice operator handled
the whole thing. A replacement drive is on the way by second day UPS
complete with prepaid return shipping label.

Subject: [PLUG] Need to tweak default gateway...
Message-ID: <1293667598.2945.16.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

Apparently, ddclient doesn't work if you don't go through the correct
Internet connection ( the one you are trying to update ).  Of course
the Comcast Internet connection and the DSL one are not equal, so I
can't just say use the Comcast connection as the default gateway.
That is exactly what I have to do though to get the update
to work.

I don't want most packets to use a different routing table, just 
the particular locally generated packets going to the updates site.  
I figure that I need to use the iptables mangle table PREROUTING chain
and  mark the relevant packets to do this, but the only way I can get a
reaction is to use the POSTROUTING chain which seems pointless because
this chain takes effect after routing decisions have been made.

The relevant rule:

iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -s 127.0.0.1 -d updates.opendns.com 
                   -j MARK --set-mark 4

where this only seems to take effect if PREROUTING is replaced 
with POSTROUTING.  I need to mark the packets before the routing
decision is made, not after.

I already know about doing ip rule add fwmark 4 table 2.  I have
a table 1 as well with the default gateway set to go through the 
DSL.  Ideally, the default routing table should have no default
gateway.  Obviously, if I can't decide which routing table to use
for local packets based on which gateway I need, I'll have to 
maintain a default gateway in the default routing table.

Have you checked to see what values are set in about:config?

1. In the URL bar, type "about:config" and press enter.
2. Confirm that you will be careful.
3. In the filter bar, type "history" and press enter.
4. Look at the list for values like "browser.history_expire_days".
5. Break stuff?  :)

   No, I did not think to look there. When I do, sure enough, it's set to 2
days, but when I look at Edit->Preferences it's set at 4 days. I guess the
user interface does not communicate with the back end once changed from the
default.

Thanks for the clue,

Rich

   I guess all the academics on the GRASS mail list are off since
universities world-wide are closed, so I'll see if coders here can help me
resolve an inability to configure the Makefile prior to building.

   When I run ./configure with all the necessary options (and all previous
builds have not had problems finding libraries or headers for postgres or
sqlite), it fails with these messages:

checking for location of SQLite library... /usr/lib/
checking for sqlite3_open in -lsqlite3... no
checking for sqlite3_open in -lsqlite3... no
configure: error: *** Unable to locate SQLite library.

   When I search the system for the sqlite3 libraries I see:

/usr/lib/libsqlite3.la
/usr/lib/libsqlite3.so
/usr/lib/libsqlite3.so.0
/usr/lib/libsqlite3.so.0.8.6

   The trailing slash on the library location works when I tell configure
--with-postgres-libs=/usr/local/pgsql/lib/ so I don't understand why there's
a problem with my specifying --with-sqlite-libs=/usr/lib/.

   Ideas needed.

Configure isn't looking for the libsqlite3.so shared object but rather
the associated header files.  Check your system to see if "sqlite3.h"
exists anywhere:
$ locate sqlite3.h

It's usually found in the /usr/include/ directory.  If it's not there
then you're missing the development libraries.  If the computer you're
trying to install onto is either Fedora or Ubuntu base then there
should be a "sqlite3-devel" or "sqlite-devel" package available.  Not
sure about Slackware.

Daniel,

   No, it's looking for the libraries:

checking whether to use SQLite... yes
checking for location of SQLite includes... /usr/include/
checking for sqlite3.h... yes

   It finds the header, but not the libraries. Also, the complier option it
is trying to apply is '-lsqlite3'.

Instead of dealing with iptables and rewriting packets, have you tried
adding a host route using the "route add -host ..." command?

Assuming you have two interfaces, eth0 and eth1, with eth0 being DSL
and eth1 being Comcast...

$> route add -host updates.opendns.com eth1

And add a second host to your openDNS account and update each from the
associated interface.

You're not running a x86_64 build and referencing the 32-bit lib by any chance?


Other things to try for sanity checking purposes...

Verify the symlink isn't broken:
$ readlink -e /usr/lib/libsqlite3.so || echo "broken."

That you can read the lib as the user you're compiling/linking with:
$ [[ -r /usr/lib/libsqlite3.so ]] && echo "can read as user."

Check if the sqlite3_open symbol actually exists in the libsqlite3.so file:
$ nm -D /usr/lib/libsqlite3.so | grep sqlite3_open


If nothing above is fruitful then I'm out of ideas for the moment.

   Looking at them tells me by color: cyan == working link, red == broken
link.

   Yep.

   Yep:

0003a9a0 T sqlite3_open
0003a9c0 T sqlite3_open16
0003a980 T sqlite3_open_v2

> If nothing above is fruitful then I'm out of ideas for the moment.

   I appreciate the try, Daniel. It is specifically because the library
should be found yet is not that I find so puzzling.

Much grasses,

so what does config.log say?  that's where you'll find the actual
output from the tests, including stderr that might tell you about
missing files, compilation troubles, and indeed even show you the code
that configure is attempting to compile before throwing that error.
(i make the assumption that this test is a compilation test--most that
./configure does are, even just checking for include files is usually
done not by looking for the file on the filesystem but trying to use
it in via the compiler in some dummy code)

config.log will often include line numbers from the ./configure script
for your further edification.  that script is never fun to debug, but
you can often see what is going on in it and adjust the system (or the
./configure script) appropriately.

if you're going to include config.log here, don't send us the whole
file,  just the part where the last tests fail.  you can leave off the
last many lines too--we don't need to know all the values of the
variables and all that jazz, just what the script is running right
before it announces those failures (should include code, a command
line for compiling, and the output from that attempt).

Chris,

   I never noticed this before. That's valuable to know. Thanks.

   Interesting. conftest fails because it's not a Windows system and there's
no cygwin or win32, but that's earlier in the file. Here's the tail:

configure:10149: checking for sqlite3_open in -lsqlite3
configure:10166: gcc -o conftest -g -O2    -L/usr/lib/  -Wl,--export-dynamic

/usr/lib//libsqlite3.so: undefined reference to lerror'
/usr/lib//libsqlite3.so: undefined reference to lopen'
/usr/lib//libsqlite3.so: undefined reference to lclose'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
configure: failed program was:
#line 10155 "configure"
#include "confdefs.h"
/* Override any gcc2 internal prototype to avoid an error.  */
/* We use char because int might match the return type of a gcc2
     builtin and then its argument prototype would still apply.  */
char sqlite3_open();

   I can run sqlite3 from the command line so I have assumed that
libsqlite3.so is complete.

Thanks,

Rich

yup.  it revolutionized my world.  but then i came from a history of
working with substandard unices (aix version 3, early post-sunos
solaris, irix, and some other really weird crusty one-offs back in the
90's), where configure is almost guaranteed to fail.  or anyway, was
back in the 90's.  most open source software has typically built
better on linux than commercial unices in my experience.

there will be a lot of "failures" as it checks for things that aren't
on your system.  but the ones we care about are the ones that prevent
the script from continuing.

> /usr/lib//libsqlite3.so: undefined reference to ?lclose'

and there's the only important problem.  looks like another library
might be needed for libsqlite3 to be used successfully.  dunno what
library has those symbols in--whatever it is isn't on my system.  but
you can check yours with the following bash snippit:

for i in /usr/lib/*so ; do nm $i | grep lsym | grep T && echo $i ; done

if you get some output like this:

00000000 T lsym
/usr/lib/libdl.so

(i fabricated that example output.  but it's what you're looking for,
with probably a different library name after)

then you've probably found a library you need to add to $LDFLAGS (in
linker syntax--something like "-ldl") before running ./configure again
(remove config.cache first!)

from the missing function names i'd guess something like libdl, but
mine only has dlsym dlopen, etc, so i don't know.  presumably your
system has the right library on if other sqlite programs that are
dynamically linked work fine, configure just isn't including it
automatically.

luck++;

   The above should have been `dlsym', `dlerror', `dlopen', and `dlclose'

   Mine's similar:

/usr/lib/libdl.so

   If I can find where to add the library reference, I'll do this.

   Now I know that I begin the line with LDFLAGS="-ldl" ./configure ...

   Now to get it to find wxWidgets.

exactly.

> ? Now to get it to find wxWidgets.

quite possibly in a similar way.  LDFLAGS get passed to the linker
(typically gcc invoking ld for you, which wants -llibraryname.  you
can chain them, "-ldl -lwxwidgets -lbob ...")  CFLAGS (set the same
way) get passed to the compiler so you might need something like
"-i/usr/src/wxwidgets/include" (change to reflect your setup,
obviously).  the preferred way for this to work is that you inform
configure about the install location directly with something like
./configure --enable-wxwidgets=/path/to/location (if
--enable-wxwidgets doesn't work by itself).  you can find available
flags listed via: ./configure --help

in theory, when you tell configure where a thing is installed (via
--enable-bob=/path/to/bob), it can figure out the rest.  in practice,
if things aren't installed both somewhere configure can find (perhaps
via your gentle nudging) AND installed in the way configure is
expecting (ie some packages stick their include files in
/usr/include/package, others in /usr/local/package/include, etc), you
have to start doing kind of nasty hackery with CFLAGS and LDFLAGS.
oh, yeah--and if you for some reason don't store the libs for the
package in a place /etc/ld.so.conf knows about, things get even more
fun.  google 'setting rpath' sometime for a good time.

there have been months on the job when 90% of my work was taming
./configure.  once i got stuff compiled, it usually just worked.
(building KDE against our self-built x11 server on solaris was a
multi-month process whose completed results were probably never
actually used by anyone.  sigh.)

Chris,

   Except that wxWidgets is for C++ and wxPython is the same widget set for
python. Since GRASS uses python now rather than shell scripts, I think I
need to disable use of wxWidgets in preference to wxPython and wxGTK, both
of which are installed here.

Thanks,

Rich

   Actually, wxWidgets is cross-platform and is represented here by wxGTK.
The issue was that I had not rebuilt wxGTK and wxPython since upgrading the
distribution to Slackware-13.1 with Python-2.6.x. So, I just built both and
upgraded the installed packages and GRASS compiles.

   Thanks Daniel and Chris.

Happy New Year all,

Rich

It finally dawned on me that I can't mangle and I added a static route
through the correct connection instead.  Am I correct in thinking that
you can't tweak the default gateway for locally generated traffic at
all?  If cable was not blocked on port 25 I could potentially go either
way for everything.  Is there a way to specify the use of a different
routing table to effectively change the default gateway?

It is a 16.0 Mega pixel camera with a microphone and a manually
adjustable flash light.  I'm downloading the Windows driver for it, but
I'd prefer to get a native Linux driver instead.

One concern of mine if this is a USB 2.0 camera is that I'm on a USB 1.0
system.

weighted routes.

If you are using a Linux box as the router, then something like the link
below should do what you want.

It has over a couple of weeks since I worked on this. I solved the
problem by installing the nVidia proprietary driver with Yumex (from
the rpmfusion repository). After installing the proprietary driver I
had no problem launching Fontmatrix, VirtualBox, ksysguard or Avidemux,
the four apps that gave the error message:

error while loading shared libraries: libnvidia-tls.so.260.19.21:
cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory [jjj at Devil8

After installing the proprietary driver I did not enable it; I
continued to use the nouveau driver. However, I did not reboot the
computer.

A couple days ago there was a new kernel in the updates. I installed it
and it said I needed to restart the computer, but did not do so until
just now. As I feared, X wouldn't start. But Ctrl-Alt-F2 got me to a
command line. As root I tried various things, but startx still said it
could not find any screens. I had been using a minimal xorg.config file
from the nouveau website:

Section "Device"
     Identifier "n"
     Driver "nouveau"
EndSection

So, acting on a hunch, I uninstalled the nVidia proprietary driver.
Afterward X loaded properly and I am back where I was. Except that now
I cannot launch the four apps listed above - same error message as
before. 

I also note that "yum erase xorg-x11-drv-nvidia.x86_64" renamed my
minimal xorg.conf file as .backup. At this time I am using the nouveau
driver but without any xorg.conf file.

I could always reinstall the proprietary driver and enable it, and just
leave well enough alone. But I'd rather use the nouveau driver if at
all possible. And it ought to be possible. After all, I ran this
computer with Fedora for a year using only the nouveau driver and
everything worked fine, including the four applications listed above.
