Subject: [PLUG] Apache mime types?
Message-ID: <4ED7AC17.9060205@zenlinux.com>

Hello,

I have an Apache 2.2.17 server running on a Fedora 14 system. I'm trying 
to distribute some .ova files (which are virtual machine appliances).

For some reason the MIME type advertised by Apache is a tar archive, and 
this causes IE to automatically rename the file to end with .tar when 
downloading it from a Windows system. Using Chrome or FF, the file is 
downloaded with the proper file extension. :-/

I do not see any references to MIME types under /etc/httpd, and nothing 
jumps out at me in /etc/mime.types that could be causing this. Some 
Google searches have been fruitless. Can anyone hit me with a cluebat 
with ideas on how to fix this?

Thanks, and I'll see you at tonight's meeting!

Scott

Have you tried forcing the type using AddType? My guess is the mime type is
going to remain similar to tar (since that's what ova really is), but maybe
the addition of a file extension will help?

AddType application/x-tar .ova

I don't know if that will work, but it's the first thing I would try.

A Content-Type of "application/octet-stream" might be better for
preventing IE from fooling around with the file extension.

upgrade is finished and I start the upgrade manager again will 11.11. be

That's how it worked for me.  I haven't watched closely, but every
upgrade I've done with Ubuntu forced me to go through each upgrade in
series.

Thanks, Jason and Tim - I was able to resolve my problem with this. Of 
course, the documentation in the httpd.conf file could not have been 
clearer:

#
# AddType allows you to add to or override the MIME configuration
# file mime.types for specific file types.
#
#AddType application/x-tar .tgz

So I appreciate the helpful responses despite my decidedly non-thorough 
searching.

The exception to this are the long term support versions. You are able to
go from one LTD version to another directly. The next LTD version will be
12.04 and come out every two years.

   Well! As some point during file download the OS decided that there was
something wrong with the screensaver but did not offer options to fix it or
turn it off. Since I had no way to see the display and determine if the
upgrade was done, I switched to tty2, logged in as root, and killed
xscreensaver. That locked the system and took away the cursor. No way to
change console, move the cursor, or anything.

   I'm now downloading the xubuntu-11.10.iso and will re-install.
Fortunately, ~/ was backup on on a flash drive just a couple of days ago.

   Has anyone else experienced this? I've done package and distribution
upgrades before on that box and they always went smoothly.

I've been a contract sys admin in the Portland area for 15 years, focusing
primarily on Linux and Unix.  I target clients that are looking for part
time or occasional work.  My clients show a high degree of satisfaction,
keeping me onboard for years (>10 years in two cases) or bringing me back
for project after project.  I'd be happy to meet some time to get to know
you.  503-617-4500,  www.martinconsulting.com.

Okay. The test made it though. I'll try the real question again, but 
this time I'll obfuscate the part that looks like it might cause a problem.

Using Synaptic I have installed mySQL, suPHP, and phpMyAdmin on my 
laptop (Ubuntu 10.04). Navigating to localhost/phpmyadmin gives me the 
phpMyadmin login page. From my reading I assumed that there would be a 
user named root and that the default password would be blank. However 
when I try to log in I get an error message that says, "Login without a 
password is forbidden by configuration (see AllowNoPassword)".
Googling, I found:

Edit the file config.inc.php, search and uncomment this line:
<obfuscation>

slash slash space dollarcfg]'Servers'][dollari]['AllowNoPassword'] = TRUE;

I tried that, and restarted Apache. But I still get the error message 
about login without a password is forbidden by configuration.

Is there some step that I missed?

TIA

   As you all know, I'm a Slacker and don't know the fine points of
administering a ubuntu system.

   Xubuntu-11.10 is now installed on the laptop, but I was not able to set
the time zone (no instructions on how to do so and I blew it), and I missed
the host name box so it has the computer model as a host name. I need to
change those so the time is correct and so it works on the LAN.

   Also, it's been long enough that I don't remember how to create a root
user and password; in Slackware that's done during installation. Sudo-ing to
root to create root seems not likely to me.

   Please help a non-ubuntu, non-professional SysAdmin correct the time, host
name (/etc/hosts was changed but apparently didn't stick), and add user
root.

   Finally, I could not test the local wireless network connectivity because
while the system saw the network it kept asking for the user's password
which was provided. Apparently that didn't do the job.

TIA,

Hi Jeff,

I am currently accepting new clients. I would be happy to talk with you
more about your clients and the sys admin support that they may need.

Most of my current client base is running Debian, mostly because I pitched
them on moving away from Red Hat.  However my background has included
RedHat, Suse, Debian, Mandrake, Gentoo, Ubuntu, FreeBSD, Solaris and a few
others.

An outdated resume:

Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

root is created by default, with no password login capability.

If you
sudo su
You can take a look at /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow, the "!" in shadow
is the "don't allow this account to login" feature.

   Well, I've always had a root login (with password) on that system. And I
could log in as root for administrative work.

   There ought to be a way to assign a password to root; perhaps if I sudo to

Rich,

The root account is disabled 'by-design'.  Jumping into a new 
distribution is the perfect time to break any previous bad habits of 
unnecessarily wielding the root account when you shouldn't be.  Almost 
everything you ever need to accomplish as root can be done with 'sudo'.

If you need a persistent session, you can simulate it with 'sudo -i'.  
If you ignore the warnings and still decide you want the root account 
enabled, perform 'sudo passwd root'.

Best,
-EJ

Will it boot at all? If so, it may be repairable. And even if it won't
boot, you should be able to use a rescue CD to get a later backup, if
that's important.

I haven't had this particular problem, although I'd check the Ubuntu
forums to see if anyone else has reported it. 

I once had a cable modem choose to die right when an Ubuntu
dist-upgrade was at about 80%. Gawd, what a mess. I gave dpkg a serious
workout, but ended up saving it. 

Fedora uses a "preupgrade" method where you download an image that
contains everything needed for the upgrade. Then you reboot and the
upgrade is installed from the image - no worries about losing the net
connection mid-stream. Or you can upgrade Fedora from the non-live DVD,
which is what I always do.

You can upgrade Ubuntu systems from the Alternate CD or DVD as well. I
have done it at the Clinic and it works slick. Once you have the
Alternate CD or DVD the upgrade goes quickly. Next time I need to
upgrade an Ubuntu install I will definitely use the Alternate CD route.

John,

   It has 11.10 running on it now. She copied her /home directory to a flash
drive a couple of days ago (perhaps missing one subdirectory, but that's
life), so it was time consuming for me but not fatal.

   Yeah, well I don't know debian and its off-spring well enough to futz with
it.

   And Slackware has a well-defined sequence that allows me to upgrade
everyting on the system and add new stuff. Then I manually delete the
deprecated packages.

   The only two choices I had were to install 11.10 in addition to 11.04
(which I knew was broken) or replace it. I did the latter.

   The re-installation of xubuntu-11.10 is almost complete. Connection to a
wireless access point away from here works, but the system is not properly
configured for use here. I need your advice on how to re-establish
connectivity here without giving up external access.

   I run a static network here. The wireless access point is set only to the
MAC addresses of the two portables here: the Toshiba and the Dell.

   On the local network the Toshiba is host 192.168.55.5. In
/etc/network/interfaces on that host I now have:

auto lo wlan0
iface lo inet loopback (# I thought that lo was the loopback interface)
address 192.168.55.5
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.55.4

   I then rebooted the system but no joy. The annoying network manager dialog
box keeps popping up telling me that the machine is not connected to the
network and asking for a password. Well, I know it's not connected, and a
password should not be required since the MAC address has been sufficient in
the past.

   The interfaces file is probably not correct and my Google searches haven't
shown me how to properly set it up. I didn't save the working interfaces
file so I can't restore it.

   How should that file be constructed, and what else do I do to establish an
automatic connection to the local network?

I find this thread of extreme interest.  not only because i would have
replied offering my services 2 months ago, but because i often need
someone like this myself.

so would anyone who replied off-list please reply on-list too?  I
can't be the only sysadmin who is tired of not having someone local to
outsource to!

Also please list your willingness to be on call 24/7 -- that's a thing
i was never great at that i would have paid someone who was a hefty
retainer to be my backup for.

PS:  anyone do osx administration (that is, understand stuff like Open
Directory & Directory Services, setting up autoinstalls, etc) as well?
 that's a hole i've never been able to find a fill for.

Yes, interface lo is the loopback, but that's just it? It's local to the machine only. usually on the 127.0.0.0 network. By local I mean that machine ONLY. The lo interface is not used for external communication. Another machine on the same network IS external communication.

You'll maybe need to set up the eth0 or eth1 network for connectivity to another not local the that machine.

   Yes, I know this. That external machine is called the 'gateway' and
defined in /etc/network/interfaces. It is reached via the wireless access
point.

   ifconfig -a shows no ethernet interfaces; only the wireless (wlan0) is
used on that machine.

Ok, then I'm confused as to why you would try to assign a non 127 network address to your loopback interface.

Russell,

   I'm not trying to do that, but to create an automatic if-up for wlan0.
With some more insight I now know I need only lo and inet in
/etc/network/interfaces as soon as I can apt-get install wicd. The WICD
client should connect to both the local, static IP addresses network and
external DHCP addresses networks.

   It seems like a conundrum: I need to access the 'Net to get wicd, but
without wicd NetworkManager is not connecting to the local network via the
wireless interface (which is not running).

   I also tried to bring up the wlan0 interface but must have had the
incorrect syntax.

Thanks,

Rich

Do you have the man page? It appeared quite good and complete:

$man 5 interfaces

Here's an example:

       auto lo wlan0

       iface lo inet loopback

       iface wlan0 inet static
            address 192.168.55.5
            netmask 255.255.255.0
            gateway 192.168.55.4

I've modified that from the example given in the man page referenced above.

nevertheless informative.  Of course it's also Windows-centric.

Yes it will ask you to go by series however you could download the ISO 
of the latest release and upgrade via startup disc
and retain your files although hopping from a long distance between 
releases is generally not suggested. I'm running
12.04 Alpha 1 and I must say it is as stable as 11.10.

Hi Rich,

11.10 has had some weird issues with xscreensaver especially in Ubuntu 
but I'm not sure
about Xubuntu. I know there has been some changes to the upgrade tool.

Re-looking at this today, suPHP might mean that phpMyAdmin and mysql
needs a specific UID's password and account setup... since the whole
point of suPHP seems to be eliminating the ability of a generic user
(say, a webserver's default UID) from having another's users (say,
root?) permissions?

Benjamin,

   The problem occurred as I tried to upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04. So far, no
issues with 11.10 installed from a disk I burned from the downloaded iso.

   This is the first fubar with an xubuntu upgrade since I've installed it on
the former Dell laptop and then the current Toshiba Satellite laptop.

Thanks,

Rich

   Thanks, Benjamin. This weekend I'll replace NM with WICD (which is what
was used before) and when that's working I'll ignore it.

There are some pretty serious issues with laptops and external monitors.
I refuse to stray off of the LTS releases, but my daughter recently
ugraded from 10.10 to 11.04 and hasn't been able to get an external
monitor to work reliably since.

For instance...
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers/+bug/858046
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-settings/+bug/882143

http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1783636
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1863987

A Google search seems to indicate a number of problems, from Unity vs
"Classic" to the nvidia driver, some of which claim to be fixed, others
still open/unresolved.

I'll know more when she's home for xmas in a couple of weeks, but for
now I'm recommending she go back to and stay on 10.04 unless there's a
compelling reason for upgrading.

Thanks. I was starting to think along those lines myself this morning.

It's been a few years since I fiddled with MySQL so I got out my trusty 
copy of SAMS PHP and MySQL Web Development and turned to the appendix. 
That reminded me of mysqladmin. It says that after the installation is 
complete one should run:

# mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'

replacing new-password with whatever I want for a password. Since this 
is an Ubuntu machine my  prompt is $ instead of # so I ran the command 
with sudo in front of it. After putting in my sudo password I get the 
error message:

mysqladmin: connect to server at 'localhost' failed
error: 'Access denied for user 'root@'localhost' (using password: NO)'

I know I've never done anything with this installation of mysql before 
this week. So I know I've never set a password for root or any other 
user. Any ideas on what the packagers decided was the default password? 
Or is there some other problem I'm missing?

I won't be surprised to find that I need to do some tweaking here, too. 
But suPHP shouldn't affect being able to run mysqladmin (see my reply to 
Wes). So I guess I need to take this one step at a time.

I would take that to be a sign of progress. Now you need to figure out how
to tell phpmyadmin what the password is. I don't remember the specifics,
and I don't have time to dig into it right now, but my vague recollection
is that in the config file, there is a way to tell it to prompt for the
login info when you browse to the phpmyadmin URL. you would use username
root, and supply the proper password.

something like Basic HTTP? simple auth? cookie something? not sure. memory
is failing at this point.

Rich,

There is a diffence between
    mysql -u root

and
    mysql -u root -h localhost

One uses a domain socket (the first one) and one uses TCP/IP.  In short,
you can configure MySQL to only allow certain users in from certain IP
Addresses, IP Address Ranges or hosts.

Also, you may have to specify -p on the end (to prompt you for a password)
or it will try to log you in with a blank password (i.e., no password).

One of these combinations should get you back in.

That would be the next step IF I knew what the password is.  At this 
point I can't even get into mysql using mysqladmin. So my password issue 
is possibly unrelated to pypmydmin.

Same error message with or without -h localhost. In both cases access 
was denied for user 'root'@'localhost'.

Indeed -p caused a request for a password. But at this point I have no 
idea what that password is. It is not blank. I tried that.

Thanks for the thoughts, though.

Bingo! My Google foo didn't turn up that one.

Thanks. That worked.

FWIW, i second (n) the request. i use TBird on all my machines and this

Subject: [PLUG] Restoring association between two programs
Message-ID: <4EDD0D91.1010309@comcast.net>

I realize that's probably not the best subject line, but I'm not sure 
what would be better. Here's the story:

OS is Ubuntu 10.04.

I have been successfully running a program called transcribe and 
controlling it with a program called footpedal. The program transcribe 
is a fairly simple sound player that shows the length of a recording in 
time and also shows the elapsed time at the cursor location. The program 
footpedal has the ability to let me start and stop playback with a USB 
connected foot switch.

Over the weekend I played around with Rhythmbox.

This morning, when I loaded transcribe and opened a recording, instead 
of hearing the voices I was trying to transcribe I got some (rather bad) 
rock music when I stepped on the foot switch. While there was nothing on 
the screen to show that Rhythmbox was still running, ps ax | grep 
rythmbox showed that it was. I killed it, but now the connection between 
footpedal and transcribe is broken.

Short of restarting the machine is there some way to restore that 
connection? It's not something I've ever had to initiate on my own.

Thanks.

Dick Steffens

Dick,

   Two thoughts:

   1) With rhythmbox no longer running, if you restart transcribe does it now
find footpedal?

   2) Does transcribe have a configuration file where you can specify
accessory programs?

No.

Alas, no. Both are written in Python. Maybe I can do something to make 
the connection, although that might have to be done with gstreamer. 
Maybe that's what has to be restarted, since it appears that both 
transcribe and rhythmbox us gstreamer.

Didn't help, though. I ended up rebooting (shudder) and footpedal now 
controls transcribe the way it's supposed to.

   I've used cfdisk which is an ncurses interface to fdisk. I don't follow
what you want to do, but cfdisk might give you a good view of what you have
so you can plan your next steps.

Primary partitions are always sdb1, sdb2, sdb3, or sdb4. Never 5+. 5+
are for logical partitions within an extended partition.

> Where sdb1 really is should be free space starting at the beginning, probably 63, and going to just before sdb2, or 235352062.

Free space isn't given an identifier, so it isn't going to be sdb1 or
sdb<anything>.

> Does someone know how to do this, or?where I could find out how to do it (probably with fdisk?).

The numeric portion of the identifier isn't used to identify the order
on the disk that the partitions have. It's fairly normal that they'd
be out of order like that if you set the FreeBSD partition up before
your Extended partition. If you want to get it in the right order, I
think what you do is run fdisk, go into extra functionality mode
(press x), and 'fix partition order' (press f). I'm not sure, but I
suspect it will make sdb2 into sdb1, and sdb1 will become sdb2 (their
order on the disk).

That's what I tried to do, but it's broken. 

It is set to Evolution (default). Clicking on the drop-down I can
select "Other," which opens up a file browser window. I can go to
~/.local/share/applications and select claws-mail.desktop or
to /usr/share/applications and select claws-mail.desktop, but neither
one will appear in place of Evolution.

Usually an application drop-down like is expecting you to enter the path to
the application binary. I suspect
/usr/share/applications/claws-mail.desktop is not the binary for
claws-mail.  You can find the correct path using whereis.
whereis claws-mail  (if that is the correct name of the binary?)

The whereis command says it is /usr/bin/claws-mail. Actually I had
already found it there by browsing previously, but the whereis command
confirmed that the binary is actually there and not duplicated
someplace else. There are also two .desktop files, one
in /usr/share/applications and the other in
~/.local/share/applications, but Firefox won't take them either.

I can launch Claws Mail from the command line with "claws-mail."

When I go into Edit > Preferences > Applications > mailto the dropdown
is set to "Evolution (default)." There are two additional options on the
dropdown: "Use other" and "Always ask." The "Always ask" choice makes
it ask, but the only option when it asks is Evolution, Yahoo mail or
Gmail. The "Use other" option opens a browser window. I can browse
to /usr/bin/claws-mail, select it, and click on the Open button in the
browser window, but the dropdown just stays on "Use other." When I
close the window and reopen it, it has reverted to "Evolution
(default)." 

The dropdown has no place to type the name or location of the binary.

The problem lies in one of three places:

	the upgrade from Fedora 14 to Fedora 16
	the upgrade from Firefox 3.something on Fc14 to Firefox 8.0
	the change from Gnome to Xfce desktop.

The change from Gnome to Xfce was added to the list by this morning's
coffee. However, it will take additional coffee to figure out how Xfce
may have affected things. I can say that in the Applications
menu "Preferred Applications" GUI "mail" is set to Claws Mail, as it has
always been. But I think the Preferred Applications GUI relates to
Gnome, which is still installed. It still may be an Xfce problem.

My current workaround is to copy the mail address in the web page,
restore Claws Mail to the desktop (it is almost always running), open a
Compose window, and paste in the address. Previously this was always
automatic just by clicking on the address in the web page.

I am still poking at the problem.

I just tried to set my "mailto:" default in Firefox 8 on Fedora 16,
and it worked just fine.  I went to Preferences and clicked on the
Applications icon.  Selected "mailto" in the list, and used the
drop-down menu to select "Use other..." (the second-to-last selection
in the list).  At that point, I was given a file selector, and I
selected /usr/bin/claws-mail.  I tested it, and it did indeed give me
claws-mail, instead of the default (which is KMailService).  Firefox
was even nice enough to just give me a Compose window from an
already-running instance of Claws-Mail, rather than starting up
another copy.

You have to tell it the name of the actual executable.  The .desktop
file(s), if any, won't work.  As far as I know, those are just for
using the mouse to start things from an icon on the desktop.

Hope this helps.

I just tried again, exactly as you did. When I had /usr/bin/claws-mail
selected in the file browser window I clicked on Open. The file browser
window closed and the mailto dropdown still said Evolution (default). I
also tried double clicking on /usr/bin/claws-mail instead of using the
Open button, but it still refuses to accept the binary.

Well, at least it's good to know that it works for you. Must be
something else that is messing up my Firefox 8.

Forgot to ask if you are using Xfce, Gnome or KDE, although from what
you said I am assuming KDE. 

I need to log out and back in with Gnome to see if the problem
persists. If so, then the problem is not in my Xfce.

John, 

I just downloaded and installed Firefox 8 to satisfy my curiosity about your problem.
I set it to use vi in response to mailto: links.
I closed FF and restarted. 
It still launched vi.

or a fourth BKAC.

> I am still poking at the problem. 

What I did to set it to use vi:

Launch FF 8
Click through Edit -> Preferences -> Applications - -> mailto:actions
Click use other, curse the lack of a window to type in, click the icons at the top and then the file manager window to
get to /usr/bin/
Click vi and open
Click ok
Click ok
visit a mailto link
close FF
open FF
verify it still works

(note: on revisiting the process to write this out I saw the file brower window had a pencil and paper icon - clicked
that and found out my earlier cursing was not called for.)

FF 8 will do what you want.

Having said all that before reading the rest of the thread, I'm using KDE.
the drop down also has a selection for Application Details.
Mine now lists perl, Gmail, Yahoo! Mail and vim.

And a question did come to mind:  have you drilled down through ~/.mozilla/firefox/<UID>.default 
to make sure you have write permissions all the way down?  If you can't write to your config
that would be a bit of a problem. 

Specifically look for mimeTypes.rdf - this is an XML file FF uses to store these preferences.

Someone on the Claws Mail listserve noted my plaintive cries and
suggested manually editing the mimeTypes.rdf file, with instructions on
how to find it and what to do with it. The mailto prettyName line was
pointing to the .desktop file, not the executable. That, in spite of
the fact that I had pointed it at the executable repeatedly in Edit >
Preferences > Applications > mailto. Manually typing in the executable
and its path and saving the file did the trick. I didn't even have to
restart Firefox.

Thanks to all for the suggestions.

Message-ID: <CALNOJ_ic5LjNZ3FXb13iFNgqha7Zw4z4YM6s-hwD0CvLx2Skjg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I went to a plug clinic to get my Logitech web cam to work a while
back.  Now, when I bring up Skype, the camera doesn't come on.  When I
"test" it in Skype, the camera comes on, and I can see an image of
myself on the test screen.  When I stop the test, the camera turns
off.  So...I know the camera works.  I just don't know how to make it
come on when Skype starts.

I don't know how to turn it on when I'm not using Skype.

What I'm trying to do is to be able to use my web cam in Google+
because I hear you can do 3 person video conferencing for free.  That
is my ultimate goal.  In the meantime, I can't figure out how to start
my camera otherwise.

Sincerely,
Victor Soich

Message-ID: <CALNOJ_iOVAVh=U7UwWLf3_bevOCEJzeOv67_7ua5+5=+9htaTg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

A friend of mine burned two videos onto a DVD for me.  My friend is
not into linux.  These are the files on the DVD

There is a folder that is entitled "VIDEO_TS"

In the folder are the following files...

VIDEO_TS.BUP
VIDEO_TS.IFO
VIDEO_TS.VOB
VTS_01_0.BUP
VTS_01_0.IFO
VTS_01_0.VOB
VTS_01_1.VOB
VTS_01_2.VOB
VTS_01_3.VOB
VTS_02_0.BUP
VTS_02_0.IFO
VTS_02_0.VOB
VTS_02_1.VOB
VTS_02_2.VOB


I am using Totem Movie Player 2.30.2 Movie Player using GStreamer 0.10.28

When I open the DVD with the Movie Player, I get a request to search
for a suitable plugin.  A search commences for a - DVD subpicture
decoder.  A result returns that says


No packages with the requested plugins found
The requested plugins are:

DVD subpicture decoder



After the failed search for the plugin, the first of two movies
starts.  I can watch it just fine.  I just cant' find the second
movie, no matter what I click on.

Also, when I put this DVD into my old DVD player hooked up to my TV,
nothing ever happens, let alone watching the first movie.

I presume there are actually two movies on my DVD, and that the
software can only access one.  What do I have to do?

Sincerely,
Victor Soich

What hardware and software do I need to take the output of my VCR and 
create a digital file that I can then burn to a DVD that will play in 
the DVD player attached to my TV?

I'm thinking about reducing the physical size of my video tape library 
and removing the VCR from the collection of boxes under the TV.

Most of these are commercial tapes, but I'm assuming I can treat them 
the same way I treat my vinyl audio recordings: I own a copy and can 
make a backup copy.

Any gotchas to be concerned about?

Thanks.

Found this HOWTO:
http://forum.videohelp.com/threads/248203-Converting-VHS-to-DVD-under-Linux-HOWTO

Most of the VCR->DVD standalone recorders do *not* allow you to make a
copy of any works with external copyright holders, and it may be a bit
tricky to do this under linux as well... the movie studios would
rather you buy the DVD version. The copy protection *can be* defeated,
and has been defeated..... and it is a crime to do so, even if you
have copyright, with a few rare exceptions ("I bought it on VHS and
want to put it on DVD" is not one of them).

Victor,

IMNSHO, Totem is a waste of disk space.  VLC is my preferred video
player; MPlayer (SMPlayer has a nicer UI) or Xine work nicely as
well.  VLC should play the disk if you tell it to play the DVD.
If not, telling it to play VIDEO_TS.IFO should get you the
top-level DVD menu.

I'm not a Ubuntu person, so I don't know whether any of those
media players are included by default.  I suspect that you may
have to enable the Universal repository, but I'm not sure.

Anyway, I hope this helps.

Turning on the camera at the same time as starting Skype may be a
matter of launching two programs/services at the same time. This would
be trivial to do with a bash script, but first you need to figure out
how to turn on the camera. You can't turn it on with the script until
you know how to turn it on manually.

I assume you have poked through all the application menus (System >
Preferences, and System > Administration, as well as the Applications
drop-down menu. If not, do so, in the hopes of finding something that
turns on the camera. I suspect this will be fruitless, but it's easy,
so give it a shot first.

Assuming that turns up nada, open /var/log/messages in Gedit. You
may need to be root to do this; if so do "sudo gedit /var/log/messages."
Then turn on the camera via the "test" procedure in Skype. This will
probably cause stuff to be written to /var/log/messages, so you can
reload the file in Gedit and see what was added. Having said that, in my
experience, /var/log/messages is a very long file and sometimes it is
easier to (as root) rename it and reboot. This will cause a
new /var/log/messages file to be created, and it will be much shorter.

Another thing to do is to use dmesg, which displays all the things that
happen behind the scenes. You could start the web cam with the "test"
method, then do dmesg |tail, which will display only the last few
lines. 

Hopefully in all that there will be some clues to report back here.

I recommend VLC, which should be in the repositories (look for it in
Synaptic Package Manager). VLC comes with its own codecs. In my
experience, if VLC won't play it, nothing will.

The VOB files are the actual video files. (You can see this because
of the size of the files.) I am going to take a wild guess that the
second movie is contained in:

	VTS_02_0.VOB
	VTS_02_1.VOB
	VTS_02_2.VOB

You can play these by themselves just by opening them in Totem or VLC
or whatever. 

I also suspect that your friend botched the video copy, probably by
doing a file copy instead of a video DVD copy. Your DVD would then just
be a data DVD full of files, instead of a playable DVD. I think it's
possible to take the files and make them into a playable DVD, but I've
never done it so I'm not sure how. It's probably easier just to play
the VOB files one at a time.

The camera only turns on when it is being used. So, in the context of
Skype, only when you start a video call.

Have you tried just doing it? Google+ should turn on your camera when it is
time for the video call to start.

Something weird happened overnight. I got e-mail with T-bird this morning and tried to reply to one. The new message form opens and has the correct To: and Subject: boxes filled in. The composition window is empty. It usually has my signature. When I click in that area and type, nothing appears on the screen. It worked fine yesterday. I  shut down and restarted T-bird -- no change. I rebooted the machine -- no change.

I am sending this from Comcast web mail.

Any ideas where to start figuring this out?

Thanks for the thought. I don't have any add-ons.

I decided to back up my t-bird profile and try reinstalling t-bird. That 
worked. Then I went back to the first e-mail I got this morning. 
Something in that e-mail causes the problem. I repeated the reinstall 
process and got the same result. Before reinstalling a third time I 
deleted the errant e-mail. The third reinstall worked, too.

The cause of the problem is now gone. I don't know what it was about 
that e-mail that caused the problem. It was a forward that included an 
image in the forwarded message. I have no idea if that mattered. I'm not 
going to lose any sleep over it. It was easy to fix, and I didn't need 
to restore my profile -- the reinstall kept the old one.

Sigh. Well, I'll just have to try it and see if it works. If not, I'll 
either look for the studio published DVD or give up on that movie.

Some of what I want to do is convert video I shot myself, so there won't 
be a copyright issue there.

Thanks.

It should be reasonably straightforward to try going to those urls 
yourself and see if it works.

I imagine you'd feel more confortable with something like:

   "GET /?file=../../../../../../proc/self/environ%00 HTTP/1.1" 404


And the requestor seeing something like:
    Forbidden
    
    You don't have permission to access / on this server.
    
    Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.
    
    Apache/2.2.8 (Ubuntu) PHP/5.2.4-2ubuntu5.17 with Suhosin-Patch mod_ssl/2.2.8 OpenSSL/0.9.8g mod_perl/2.0.3 Perl/v5.8.8
    Server at saunter.us Port 80

But Yes, you do have a concern:  the file=../../... construction being allowed means any web attacker can read any file
on your system the web server user can read.

(off to find the documentation about how to prevent this)

It's even more straightforward to believe the logging is not broken and believe the 200 response code.

/?something is almost always going to return 200 on any website, because
you're just tacking on parameters to the index file. In most cases, this
will cause the index to load (200) and ignore the extraneous parameters
(even if you just have a static index.html).

That seems like a leap of faith.  Hit any static directory page on
your own web site (such as ones provided by index.html), provide a
URL parameter like those agove, and see if it gives you a error.  You
probably won't, since any parameters supplied that aren't used are
just going to be ignored.  Or maybe I misunderstood what you're trying
to say...

Testing this attack for yourself is the key.

If they're getting HTTP 200 ("success") status codes, yes.  Those should
NOT be readable.  But then, they could be returning "nope! you can't see
this!" pages.

The traffic itself most likely coming from a generic bot or script, so it's
nothing personal.

Subject: [PLUG] Sound control issues
Message-ID: <4EE640E5.8080704@comcast.net>

System is Acer Aspire 1640Z laptop running Ubuntu 10.04.

Not too many months ago (June, 2011) I was able to connect the headphone 
out of my boom box to the line in of my laptop and, using Audacity, 
record a tape from my boom box. I was also able to monitor the sound 
being recorded through the laptop speakers, or separate speakers 
connected to the laptop's headphone jack.

I have another project requiring conversion of audio tape to digital 
file (these are interviews to be transcribed, not copyrighted 
recordings). I am able to record, but not able to monitor the recording. 
Has something changed that would have been implemented in an upgrade 
between June and now? I've looked for things muted, but nothing is -- 
which makes sense since I can play back the recording and hear it just fine.

Googling indicated something was going on with ALSA being deprecated (or 
something) and pulse audio being the new, preferred sound sub system, 
but I don't find anything that explains how to get monitoring working.

Pointers, better Google foo, workarounds, similar experience -- any or 
all would be appreciated.

Thanks.

 did both.
 http://saunter.us/?file=../../../../../../proc/self/environ
 pre-coffee and
 http://michaelsnet.us/?file=../../../../../../proc/self/environ
 after coffee and Jason's point that the ?... is a parameter to the index of the directory.

 so if you have a index.html(or .pl or ...) it will return 200 and show the index.html results.

 Cute.
 What a day to learn things.

Further Googling turned up this:

http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1891131

It indicates that sound is not ready for prime time -- at least when 
production is the goal.

For the current project I reverted to Audacity on XP, which just worked 
when I started using it. It was a short project and is completed. 
Hopefully the sound gurus will figure something out down the road.

Denis,

   I've used all sorts without any problems. Locally I buy from ENU; further
afield, I buy from newegg.com. Both stand behind the products they sell.

I've had numerous LiteOn drives die on me over the years.  I don't buy
anything from them anymore.

In the past, plextor has been a rock solid brand, but I haven't bought
a drive from them in a while.

It looks like ENU choices are LiteOn.  New Egg is good, but not as local as
I was looking for.

I know there's a general disdain regarding Fry's around here, but they
usually have Asus SATA burners (OEM) for ~$20-25. I've been using those in
all of my recent builds (a couple of Windows boxes, a hackintosh and two or
three Linux systems). So far I haven't seen any problems.

I learned years ago to stay far away from LiteOn. :-P

Pacific Solutions has none LiteOn products and (I believe) fit the local criteria.
They're less than a mile from my house, so I count them as local.

Negatory on the LG brand. I have two in my desktop. They read and write
OK most times, that is, if you can get the drawer shut. 

I seem to remember that LG was formed when "L" (forgot the name, a
Korean electronics manufacturer) bought out Goldmark, a Korean
manufacturer of schlock electronic knock-offs. Some of their stuff is
OK, if you consider average acceptable. They actually do pretty well in
some areas, like phones. But stay away from their optical drives.

Thanks to everyone for their help with this.  I have convinced myself
that there is not a problem.  As Jason L. suggested, the server just
returns my index.html, regardless of the various file=/mod=/page=
parameters that are appended to the URL.

Apologies for the fire drill, but that's the first time I'd seen
something like this show up in the logs.

I am not sure what you meant to say "... has none LiteOn products..."

They have many LiteOn and one Sony: AD-7260S-0B.  One Samsung too.  They
are local.  Does L.G. make the Sony, I wonder?

I dunno about their quality but I believe it was Goldstar that Lucky bought.

They seem to have at least some cred in the flat screen TV domain.

I haven't had a desktop unit in about 5 years, but the last time I built one, the absolutely best optical drive was a Plextor. Since those are typically priced at a premium, I've purchased others for my own use, including three very good LGs, one of which is a CD-R/DVD+-R/BD/HDDVD drive in my multimedia PC.

I have a LiteOn CD/DVD drive in my desktop system and it's always done
everything that I've needed it to do, including burning and reading CD
and miniCD discs. Granted, I'm not a user of DVDs, but it seems solid.

ENU sold me this drive, and I don't think it would carry this brand if
there were a lot of warranty returns and complaints. It might have got
better than the bad old LiteOn that you might remember from years ago.

Microsoft will always be Microsoft: dishonest, corrupt and scheming to
screw everyone else, including its partners, developers and customers.

But some Asian companies do learn and improve over time - they have to
or they'll get overtaken by those that adapt better - that is the way.

In the '60s there were cheap transistor radios made by Japaneses firms
no one had ever heard of - odd names like Sony, Toshiba and Panasonic.

And a couple of Japanese companies made motorcycles. I had a Honda 90,
and later a Yamaha 250. And yes I nearly killed myself on both of 'em.

A few years later, Honda was selling cars in the US. I bought one, and
I don't think I ever did more than change the oil in it, occasionally.

By the mid-80s, US automakers were in trouble, the Japanese cars were
killing them. What happened? Deming taught Japan statistic discipline.

Assess the present products from Asian sources. Don't go by reputation
from years ago. Those companies can change fairly quickly, to survive.

Sorry for the long post, but I thought this deserved some context here.

Regards,
Robert

Subject: [PLUG] Linux RAID hotswap
Message-ID: <alpine.OSX.2.00.1112151433300.30212@springwater.galois.com>

My impression is that there is quite a range of Linux experience 
floating around PLUG, so I offer the following tale of goodness and 
world domination for those who haven't yet played with Linux' 
kernel-based RAID functionality.

At $WORK, I specify all servers to ship with an even number of hard 
drives. Most arrive with two drives, but some come with more.

On the typical two-drive server, I setup a four partitions on each 
drive:

  * swap   -- a couple gigs
  * /boot  -- 300 MB
  * /      -- 20 to 40 GB
  * /srv   -- [remainder]

We mount /home from a central filestore, so I don't need any local 
space for home directories.

I create identical partition tables on both hard drives and mirror 
them using software RAID-1. I'll note that this is NOT a surrogate for 
backups; it's merely protection against drive failure.

I also setup the smartmontools to test and monitor the drives fairly 
aggressively, sending me an e-mail on error conditions:

   # /etc/smartd.conf
   /dev/sda -a -d ata -m me at domain -o on -s (S/../.././01|L/../../6/02)
   /dev/sdb -a -d ata -m me at domain -o on -s (S/../.././01|L/../../6/02)

One of our servers recently started throwing drive errors. Both smartd 
AND mdadm (the RAID userspace utility) let me know that /dev/sda was 
having problems. In my experience, that means I need to order a new 
drive pronto.

The recent Thai floods have elevated drive prices, but I was able to 
find an appropriate replacement drive at newegg.com, so I placed the 
order.

Then I told the system to break the RAID mirrors by failing and 
removing the partitions on /dev/sda from the various metadevices:

   mdadm --manage /dev/md0 --fail /dev/sda1
   mdadm --manage /dev/md0 --remove /dev/sda1

   mdadm --manage /dev/md1 --fail /dev/sda3
   mdadm --manage /dev/md1 --remove /dev/sda3

   mdadm --manage /dev/md2 --fail /dev/sda2
   mdadm --manage /dev/md2 --remove /dev/sda2

   mdadm --manage /dev/md3 --fail /dev/sda4
   mdadm --manage /dev/md3 --remove /dev/sda4

I noted in dmesg that /dev/sda was on scsi_host 0:

   sd 0:0:0:0: Attached scsi disk sda

The drive arrived a couple days later. Since the machine in question 
is a rack-mount server, I was able to remove the failed drive by just 
sliding it out of the front of the case.

I slid the replacement drive into the bay. And then the fun part:

   # verify that /dev/sda is currently unreadable
   hdparm -I /dev/sda

   # ask the kernel to rescan scsi_host 0
   echo "0 0 0" > /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/scan

   # see if the drive responds to roll call after scan
   hdparm -I /dev/sda

   # verify the new drive has no partition table
   fdisk -l /dev/sda

   # copy parititon table from sdb to sda
   sfdisk -d /dev/sdb | sfdisk /dev/sda

   # add sda's partitions to the RAID sets
   mdadm --manage /dev/md0 --add /dev/sda1
   mdadm --manage /dev/md1 --add /dev/sda3
   mdadm --manage /dev/md2 --add /dev/sda2
   mdadm --manage /dev/md3 --add /dev/sda4

Once the partitions were all synchronzied (about 4 hours later), I 
installed grub on sda's master boot record to make sure that I could 
boot from that drive should sdb ever fail.

   grub> find /grub/stage1
   find /grub/stage1
    (hd0,0)
    (hd1,0)
   grub> root (hd0,0)
   root (hd0,0)
    Filesystem type is ext2fs, partition type 0xfd
   grub> setup (hd0)
   setup (hd0)
    Checking if "/boot/grub/stage1" exists... no
    Checking if "/grub/stage1" exists... yes
    Checking if "/grub/stage2" exists... yes
    Checking if "/grub/e2fs_stage1_5" exists... yes
    Running "embed /grub/e2fs_stage1_5 (hd0)"...  15 sectors are embedded. succeeded
    Running "install /grub/stage1 (hd0) (hd0)1+15 p (hd0,0)/grub/stage2 /grub/grub.conf"... succeeded
   Done.

Et voila!

The system never had to come down, and it never was terribly 
inconvenienced except for the I/O load during resync.

LTSpice from Linear Technology is not free-free, but it's
free-as-in-beer and it's tuned to run under Wine (it actually detects
that it's running under Wine and changes its behavior).  It has been
100% trouble-free for me.  I prefer it because their algorithms have
been completely re-written to optimize for switching supplies, and as a
consequence they model RF oscillator start-up much better than other
SPICE programs I've used.  The only real drawback is that (for some
reason!!!) they only include models of Linear Technology ICs, and they
don't stay current with all the latest MOSFETs.

But it's easy enough to put in someone else's model, if you can get it.

Ditto EagleCAD.  Also not free-free, but they have a native Linux
version, and their free-as-in-beer version is only crippled to the
extent that the circuit board is limited in size and to two layers, and
doesn't come with an auto-router.  Their $$ version is quite nice to
use, even if it happens to be at the bottom of the ladder as far as pro
EDA software goes.

I've been using both of these products professionally for years, and
they've served me quite well.

11.04 worked well on both my laptop and my desktop, but on the laptop
11.10 won't turn the backlight back on -- there's no way I'm installing
it on my work machine!

11 also lost the ability to switch keyboard maps in the login screen.
Since I type in Dvorak and I've got people in the household who use
QWERTY, this was a nice feature -- I can use a QWERTY keyboard, but I
need to look at my fingers to do so, and it really slows me down.

I need to reinstall 11.04 on the laptop, then sit tight for 12.04, or
whatever the next LTS release is.

You didn't mention the response size from your logs (typically the 
number just after the response code.)  If it is the same number of 
bytes as index.html and not the same size as environ, then you can be 
pretty sure that the content served was index.html.

logwatch must have stripped that off.  I checked the actual
www-access_log file.  The response size does indeed match my static
index.html file size.  Thanks for the tip.

   Does anyone here know where the environmental variable, COLORTERM, is set?

   On my system, TERM=rxvt-unicode but COLORTERM=rxvt-xpm. I think this might
be why I cannot display UTF-8 characters in virtual terminals and alpine.
(I've asked on the Slackware mail list earlier this week but have not had
any response.)

Rich,

grep -r COLORTERM /etc might enlighten you.

Probably some large or growing files pointed to by links from /etc/*

Try without the -r.

Rod,

   Command line returns immediately.

   What's interesting (to me, at least) is that I can put 'export
COLORTERM=rxvt-unicode-256color' in ~/.bash_profile and it's added to the
environment along with -xpm.

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ env | grep -i TERM*
TERM=rxvt-unicode
COLOTTERM=rxvt-unicode-256color
COLORTERM=rxvt-xpm

   The problem I'm trying to resolve is the lost ability of my virtual
terminals (which includes the window in which alpine, my MUA, displays) to
display the UTF-8 character set. I had it for a short time after building
and installing urxvt/rvxt-unicode, but now it's gone again. I also cannot
read the UTF-8 test file in a console (X not running in it). Quite
frustrating.

   The rxvt-unicode author berated me for having a broken distribution or, at
least, terminfo. I gained the ability to view UTF-8 characters when I found
a rvxt-unicode description for /etc/termcap, but that's apparently been
deprecated in favor or /usr/share/termifo/r/rxvt*. Sigh.

   Twenty years after the birth of linux I would think this would not be an
issue for any distribution. Seems to me to be a broad-based need and why
it's not working here is well beyond my experience and knowledge.

Thanks,

Rich

How about:

find -P /etc -type f -exec grep COLORTERM {} \;

At least that may not do an endless loop.

Ken,

   Nope; no endless loop. But, it quickly returns the command line.

   There _must_ be a location where these environmental variables are set so
why is it so difficult to find?

   In /etc/lilo.conf's global section at the top I have: append="
vt.default_utf8=0" and that seems ineffectual.

Much grasses,

Rich

Rich- for what little it's worth, on my OpenSuSE system, it's defined in 
/etc/csh.login and /etc/profile.  (And I found them with the 
old-fashioned, but portable, 'find /etc -type f | xargs grep COLORTERM').

David,

   I run bash, not csh, but there's only a TERM definition in /etc/profile. I
just added a COLORTERM definition there. Both TERM and COLORTERM are defined
in ~/.bash_profile (and I added the latter to ~/.bashrc).

   For some reason, however, I'm not able to properly display the UTF-8 test
file nor see those characters in alpine mail messages. As far as I can tell,
every place a character set or terminal type can be specified it's set to
UTF-8, en_US.UTF-8. rxvt-unicode, urxvt, or rxvt-unicode-256color. I'm
missing something subtle, somewhere.

Thanks ... and Happy Holidays to you and your family,

Rich

I have some knowledge.

Couldn't do the project, but could share our config files with you, they 
may help.

I do see that the email section is in HYLAFAX_ROOT/etc/FaxDispatch

Have you gotten that far?

   Well! Turns out the issue was not with COLORTERM, but with setting the
locale.

   I would 'export LANG=en_US.UTF8' at the command line and in
~/.bash_profile (and ~/.bashrc, too, out of desparation) but it made no
difference. Each time I logged in LANG (and other environment variables
other than LC_COLLATION) returned to 'en_US'.

   A bit more Web searching lead me to the Slackware portion of
linuxquestions.org and that taught me there's /etc/profile.d/lang.sh. I
uncommented 'LANG=en_US.UTF8' there, logged out and then back in. Now the
UTF-8 test file properly displays and locale shows LANG=en_US.UTF8.

   Still don't know where COLORTERM is set, but that has nothing to do with
how the locale is set. Yowzer! Whew!

Thanks, Bill!   I had some problems with dropbox (old distro,
dependency hell), but Randal's addenda to your page suggested
wuala.com.   Thanks to both of you!

wuala.com is easy to use and functional.  I am uploading some
wydiwys presentations (it is throttled to 100KB/s, and still
running).  With a fast connection you can look at them at:
  
http://content.wuala.com/contents/keithl/O11LL/index.html

http://content.wuala.com/contents/keithl/O11SS/index.html

Forward is [spacebar], Backward is [backspace], and
the hierarchical navigation menu is [enter].

Subject: [PLUG] xkcd1k for plug general meeting January 5, maybe?
Message-ID: <20111219212131.GD3870@gate.kl-ic.com>

David often has trouble rounding up speakers for the PLUG
general meeting.  If he does not have a speaker for
January 5th, I propose a "xkcd1k eve" meeting.

http://xkcd.com is the best webcomic in the universe, and
has been mentioned on the list many times.  Many of the
strips are about open source topics.  xkcd releases on
mondays, wednesdays, and fridays.  Today (Mon Dec 19)
was xkcd #992, discussed on the plug-talk list.

Assuming author Randal Munroe keeps to the usual schedule,
releasing the day's strip just after midnight Eastern time,
that means it shows up here about 9pm the day before. 

If I've done my math right, that means that strip #1000,
xkcd1k, shows up around 9PM Thursday January 5, 2012,
while we are at afters at the Lucky Lab Northwest.

So, I propose we connect a web browser to the PSU projector,
and attendees suggest the numbers of their favorite xkcd
cartoons for display on the Big Screen.  We can explain or
discuss or ridicule them as needs be.  I can bring some
big pads of paper, some black markers, and a flip-chart
easel, and we can draw our own xkcd cartoons, at the
meeting or at afters.

If somebody is /really/ obsessive, they can set up some web
connections with other west coast user groups, and we can
swap our cartoons and comments back and forth.  In the long
run, that might lead to other over-the-web presentations,
and we could recruit speakers from other cities.

If this makes sense, we can announce on Caligator, on the
xkcd forums, and spread the word, and see who shows up.

For video editing, I sometimes use kdenlive to drag-n-drop mkv files 
into a timeline - it opens them up rather cleanly, but I have to guess 
and try what output settings yield files that my other programs can work 
with - such as VirtualDub or Adobe Premiere Elements (on Win laptops.)

Anyways over the past months a new codec has come out it's called 
"Hi10p" and it's (afaik) a flavor of mp4.

I just upgraded from kdenlive 0.7.7.1 to the newer 0.8.2.1 and it can 
actually open some of the 10H0p stuff I have thrown at it.

I am still in a guess-and-try mode for outputting the files, but still I 
highly recommend kdenlive for anyone who is getting into non-linear 
video editing.

I
second that recommendation.? kdenlive has as reasonably easy a workflow
as one can get in non-linear video editing, is tightly developed in tandem
with ffmpeg, seems to handle any codec out there, and has a support community
that's helpful.? Lots of good stuff.

That's floating point for you, and most traditional languages use that
by default.  If you want exact calculations, you have to use a library
specifically designed for them, or use a language which does exact
calculations by default.

Back in the late '70s and early '80s I wrote programs for small 
businesses with a version of Turbo Pascal that used binary coded decimal 
for math. What languages use that, or something giving non-floating 
point results these days?

I haven't had to use such things for a long time, but Scheme has a
data type for floating point and another data type for exact numbers.
Python's documentation has a good explanation of the issue and makes
the "decimal" and "fractions" modules available to do more exact
calculations.  See: 
  http://docs.python.org/release/3.1.3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html

Dick,

   PostgreSQL's SQL used to have a 'monetary' type that was deprecated in
favor of numeric. The latter is specified with total number of significant
digits and the number of fractional digits. For example, numeric(10,2) would
specify 1000000.00 to 9999999.99. (Formatting in the usual monetary way is
up to the UI while the numbers are exact.)

Yeah, and Common Lisp, and rational numbers (i.e exact fractions), e.g.

[4]> (- (+ (* 2 0.00425) 0.0025) (* 2 0.00425) 0.0025)
-4.656613E-10
[5]> (- (+ (* 2 425/100000) 25/10000) (* 2 425/100000) 25/10000)
0

Or, one of the fun things with GNU CLISP (a particular implementation
of Common Lisp) 

[8]> (- (+ (* 2 0.00425L0) 0.0025L0) (* 2 0.00425L0) 0.0025L0)
4.2351647362715016953L-22
is modifying at runtime the precision of floating
point:

[11]> (SETF (EXT:LONG-FLOAT-DIGITS) 128)
128
[12]> (- (+ (* 2 0.00425L0) 0.0025L0) (* 2 0.00425L0) 0.0025L0)
0.0L0

Also, Common Lisp has something called decode-float:

[13]> (decode-float (- (+ (* 2 0.00425) 0.0025) (* 2 0.00425) 0.0025))
0.5 ;
-30 ;
-1.0
[14]> (decode-float (+ (* 2 0.00425) 0.0025))
0.704 ;
-6 ;
1.0
[15]> (decode-float (* 2 0.00425))
0.544 ;
-6 ;
1.0
[16]> (decode-float 0.0025)
0.64 ;
-8 ;
1.0

Decode-float is breaking a float down into a mantissa, an exponent and
a sign.

Shouldn't that be something like double x; or float x;  ???

-----------------------------------------------------------------
#include <stdio.h>
main() {
   double x = (.00425 * 2 ) + .0025 ;
   printf ( "%24.24f\n", x - ( .00425 * 2) - .0025);
}

[keithl at kao ~]$ gcc -o fp fp.c
[keithl at kao ~]$ ./fp
0.000000000000000000433681

-----------------------------------------------------------------
... if we declare a float instead of double :

[keithl at kao ~]$ ./fp
-0.000000000059604645438055

-----------------------------------------------------------------
... for somewhat better precision ( I'm too lazy to count zeros):

main() {
#include <stdio.h>
   long double x = (.00425 * 2 ) + .0025 ;
   printf( "%16.8le\n", x - ( .00425 * 2) - .0025 );
}

[keithl at kao ~]$ ./fp
-0.00000000e+00

-----------------------------------------------------------------

But why stop there?  We can use GMP, the Gnu Multiple Precision
Library, and compute something a wee bit more challenging:

kpm.c -----------------------------------------------------------
// use gmp, http://libgmp.org

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <gmp.h>
 
int main(void)
{
 mpf_set_default_prec (4000000);  // yes, 4 million bits

 mpf_t x;
 mpf_t y ;
 mpf_t result;
 
 mpf_init(x);
 mpf_init(y);
 mpf_init(result);
 
 mpf_set_str(x, "1e1000000", 10);
 mpf_set_str(y, "1e0",       10);
 
 mpf_add(result, x, y);
 gmp_printf("after add:        %Fe\n", result);

 mpf_sub(y, result, x);
 gmp_printf("after subtract:   %Fe\n", y     );
}
--------------------------

compile and run it:
[keithl at kao ~]$  gcc -o fpm fpm.c -lgmp ; ./fpm
after add:        1.000000e+1000000
after subtract:   1.000000e+00

A million decimal places seems like adequate precision.
Something segfaults if I try 10 million decimal places,
which is sad, because I would like to compute a number
that would take more than a lifetime to read ...

It might be amusing to compute cos(1e1000000)+cos(1e1000000+pi)
and see how well the GMP trig routines work.  You can spend
a few hours melting your CPU instead of mine.

And yes, I sometimes use libgmp for real, doing 128 bit
precision (and incredibly time consuming) orbital
calculations, where the roundoff error of long doubles
is a bit too much.  Don't YOU want to know where YOUR
satellite is, within a few nanometers, so you can look
at relativistic frame drag?

BTW, some point out that #1000 will not be the 1000'th strip,
there are a few extras and gaps over the years.  The #1000

Randall Munroe is a trickster, so I'm guessing that strip #0999

Is it correct to say a "live instance" is:

     b. a virtual machine/other?

Phrasing is intentionally vague as some answers I've 
received on various Linux fora have confused me. My

IOW the eventual response to some of my past questions may 
be "OH! That is what you were asking" ;)

A live instance as far as I have always used them is simply one that will usually do some modprobing enough to start an X session and let you Kick the tires before installing graphically.  I wouldn't consider it a Virtual Machine or an emulation.

   Generally, a live distribution means that the entire system is on a
bootable optical disk (CD or DVD). Someone can insert the disk in the
optical drive, reboot the system, and up comes the linux distribution in
full working order. When one is done fiddling, examining, or otherwise using
the software, exiting the distribution opens the optical drive door and
reboots the machine to its original installed OS.

   These are used to demonstrate linux, to allow someone to become familiar
with it without altering what is on the host machine, and to rescue a
FUBARed linux box.

I don't like to miss the opportunity to muddy the waters, so here goes ...
    (1) "live distro" ... live in this case (as in Linux) usually means 
a complete and self-booting Linux OS and applications, all on one CD (or 
DVD, or USB memory stick, for that matter)
               Just boot and run as is without installing, although many 
of these do offer an install option.
    (2) "live instance" ... an instance may be an instantiation, or copy 
of (fill in the blank), and a live instance is one of those that is 
currently live(???)
    (3) "emulation" ... in the computer world, emulation is usually a 
software layer that pretends to be something else ... example: a layer 
over the underlaying OS that pretends to be a different OS
    (4) "virtual machine" ... VMWare is a good example here ... say your 
OS is Linux ABC (the host OS), then you install VMWare to run on top of 
that.  Then in VMWare you install one or more "guest" OS's ... these 
guest OS's are virtual machines in that none of them talk to the base 
machine, and any or all of them can crash without disturbing the base 
machine or "host" OS
    (5) "other" ... oh, now that is a long list
... is any of that any help at all?

Subject: [PLUG] Free HP Pavilion computer
Message-ID: <20111227191137.5dff2314@mailhost.pdx.edu>

Tenants left this behind. It is an HP Pavilion System 6460:

http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=bph04810&tmp_track_link=ot_faqs/top_issues/en_us/bph04810/loc:4&cc=us&dlc=en&lc=en&product=59943#N22

All I have is the box; no keyboard, mouse, monitor or other goodies. It
was designed for Windows 98, so that should give you an idea of its age.

I didn't open the case to see if the RAM had been upgraded from the
standard 96 MB that it probably came with (maximum 256 MB). Supposedly
it came with a 9.6 GB hard disk. I could scare up a monitor, keyboard
and mouse around the house and try it out, but I didn't bother because
it is kind of useless to me. Oh, and there is an empty slot where the
expansion cards go, so I suspect the tenants added a network card and
then removed it before putting it on a shelf in the basement. It has a
floppy drive as well as a CD drive. Might be useful for moving stuff
off of old floppies onto a CD to use on more modern computers that
don't have floppy drives.

You could probably get DSL or Puppy on it, or even Lubuntu, especially
if you add some RAM. If no one wants it, it goes to Free Geek.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1112280940490.12296@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Now and then R gets high-centered and really stuck, so I shut down emacs
and start again. While R saves my work in .Rhistory, I regularly save the
buffer contents in daily files; e.g., 2011-12-28.R. My problem is how to
save new work to that same file (by appending to it) rather than overwriting
it when I press C-x c-s.

   My Google searches and reading of emacs manuals did not reveal to me how
to to a buffer save appending to an existing file on disk. A clue stick
would be very helpful.

One thing that would work, off the top of my head:

  open the old file in a buffer

  cut & paste the contents of the new buffer at the end of the old
  file.

M-x apropos-command 
"append" gives me append-to-file.

C-h f append-to-file gives me:

  append-to-file is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `files'.
  (append-to-file START END FILENAME)

  Append the contents of the region to the end of file FILENAME.  When
  called from a function, expects three arguments, START, END and
  FILENAME.  START and END are buffer positions saying what text to
  write.

Russell,

   M-x append-to-file lets me add to the specified file, but when I then try
to save the buffer (C-x C-s), it won't let me use the existing file name. I
can either overwrite the file or create a new one. Doesn't seem right to me.

Thanks,

Rich

Russell,

   Allow me to be more clear than I was. I've done this. The full file is
then saved to, for example, 2011-12-28.R. However, when I next try to save
the R session I cannot save to that filename without overwriting what's on
disk.

   Doing this the other way, that is inserting (C-x i) 2011-12-28.R into the
R buffer also does not allow me to save the buffer contents to that same
file name. Check mate.

Bill,

   I need to provide access to a 23M file so I downloaded the Dropbox

with the tool I right-click on the file, then chose Dropbox -> Copy public

   Any ideas?

Thanks,

   Got it all worked out. Found the instructions on the Web and now know how

Subject: [PLUG] Battery Backup Troubleshooting
Message-ID: <4EFD0BA7.9070403@comcast.net>

I had a power outage this afternoon. I had saved my work beforehand and 
was away from the computer at the time. When I saw the lights go out I 
went to the computer to shut it down. It was already down and the 
battery backup was not telling me it was dealing with a power failure. 
The power is restored and all is working normally. But I'd like to 
figure out why the battery backup failed. Recommendations on what to 
look at will be appreciated.

The battery backup is a Belkin F6C325-SER, which is rated for 325 VA or 
211 W. I've had this unit for quite a few years, possibly over 10.

According to my Kill a Watt, my computer is drawing 1.40 A @ 118.2 volts 
(drifting between 117.9 and 118.4), and the Kill a Watt says 112 W.   
118.2 V x 1.4 A = 165.48 VA.

When the power failed I also had one monitor powered through the battery 
backup. I have no monitor plugged in to the battery backup at this time 
-- just in case it was the straw that broke the lead-acid battery's 
back. The monitor that was plugged in at the time of the power failure 
is currently drawing 0.29 A @ 118.2 V (similar voltage drifting as 
above), 24 W.  118.2 V x 0.29 A = 34.278 VA

My other monitor is drawing 0.25 A @ 118.2 V, 20 W.  118.2 V x 0.25 A = 
29.55 VA

The battery was deemed to be working by a battery shop back in 2010.

In theory I should be able to run the computer and both monitors.
(112 + 24 + 20) W = 154 W.    (165.48 + 34.278 + 29.55) VA = 229.308 VA

Is there some rule of thumb that says one should only count on some 
percentage (less than 100) of the rated capacity of a battery backup?

Thanks for hints, ideas, pointers, etc.

Dick Steffens

Dick,

   Quite likely the battery needs to be replaced.

   Yes, but you've no idea how much life it had then.

Based on professional/personal experience with over 250 UPS units, I would not trust any battery in any UPS that is over 3 years old.

HI

The specs..




   *Belkin 325 VA UPS*
  Cord Length:  6 ft.
  Voltage:  120 VAC
  Volt Amps:  325 VA
  Watts:  210 Watt
  Output Voltage Regulation:  Automatic Voltage Regulation
  Half Load Run Time:  13 minutes
  Battery Recharge Rate:  4 - Hours
  Dimensions:  8.6" x 6.2" x 8.8"
  Weight:  12.13 lbs.
  Outlets:  8 Outlets
  Outlet Orientation:  4 Battery and Surge
   4 Surge Only

The important information...

Half Load Run Time:    13 minutes.

It doesn't state Full Load run time.....   Could assume 50%..  or  6.5
minutes in a perfect world..

I assume the software provides controlled shutdown with the time on the
unit?

Quite possible. It is not the original battery, but it is a few years old.

That battery could be over 3 years old. If I dug deep enough in the 
paper files I might be able to find out.

Hmm. Does that indicate that 1/2 load is what one should spec for? If 
that's the case I need a larger capacity unit.

It was only a minute or so before I got to the machine. But if the 
battery is worn out, it wouldn't have lasted that long.

> I assume the software provides controlled shutdown with the time on the

Actually, no. I don't have a hardware connection from the battery to the 
computer.

So. Next step is to take the battery to the battery store and see if 
they can tell me anything about it's ability to hold a charge. I 
probably bought it at Northwest Battery Supply. Sounds like a field trip 
is in order.

Thanks to all for the feedback.

In the event that it's the Belkin unit itself, what recommendations do 
folks have for units with that capacity that also have hardware 
connections my Ubuntu machine could use?

Hi

My last unit.  Which I no longer have.  I  have nothing now..

Anyway, my last unit lasted exactly one minute.  It's only job was to shut
down the computer in the event of a power failure.

Worked just fine.  I never cruise the net or do work during a power
outage.  So SHUT OFF THE  COMPUTER!!!!..

A battery with a software connection to the computer.  I figure it would be
a waste to not have that communication..

So the software that came with the power unit was instructed to shut off
the computer if the power outage lasted 60 seconds.

HTH

Marvin

   I was sent a file with the .mpk extention and need to determine whether it
can be viewed or converted on a linux host. My Google search suggests that
it's a type of Microsoft Project file.

   Has anyone here seen or worked with this type of file before? It seems to
me that every time an open source project develops the ability to open a
proprietary Microsoft format, work with it, and save it in a different
format Microsoft changes that format to make it more opaque.

Fred,

   Trying to open the file in LO just hangs the application. The progress bar
along the bottom scurries from left to right, then nothing happens.

Thanks for the suggestion,

Rich, I think in your context it is likeley an Arcgis map package
http://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/0911/share-and-document-maps-with-map-packages.html
esri also produces more than its share of proprietary data formats. I
don't know what application to use for it, but "rm"
might work.

Bill,

   I'm sure you're correct.

> esri also produces more than its share of proprietary data formats.

   No kidding? :-) I was writing conversion filters for GRASS in the late
1990s until Frank Warnerdame came up with his library (that he still
maintains and regularly updates). I've several ESRI files in their latest
proprietary format that are not yet usable in GRASS. Some of these come from
federal government agencies, too, funded (in part) by my tax dollars but
they don't make their data universally available.

> I don't know what application to use for it, but "rm" might work.

   That certainly works. So does letting it sit and collect dust.

Many thanks,

Message-ID: <CAArUT0jdG07zCt2JfO-Emxc14emVXrXTXHOKmahNms+kH3NTyg@mail.gmail.com>

Upon powering up my desktop I get a double beep immediately on pushing the
power button.  This has started since making the following changes:

I just removed a non-functional PATA DVD reader/writer and replaced it with
a SATA DVD reader/writer.  I remove the PATA cable as well, since there are
no other drives using it.  The only other thing I did was to
slightly re-position a temp sensor which controls the front fan on the case
(the wires go directly to the fan, not to the MB.)

I Googled for information.  AMI bios seems to report a parity error in the
lowest 64K memory by signaling with two short beeps.

So I ran 100 passes of Memtest 86+ on the first 1M of memory.  No failures.


Below is part of dmidecode's result for my system.  As an aside, I am
confused as tow what bios version this is: 2.5, 0907, or 8.14.

Advice?

Thanks,
-Denis

More:  Is it possible that the beeps come from the new drive?  I
disconnected the speaker from the MB and I still hear the beeps.  No
indication in the MB docs that there is an on-board sound-making device.

Try disconnecting the new drive and see if it goes away.  Also, you
didn't say (or maybe I wasn't reading carefully) whether after the
beeps it boots normally, hangs or what.

The AMI BIOS and SMBIOS are two different things.  The AMI BIOS is
the traditional BIOS program of the sort we all know and love
(*cough-cough*).  The best way for me to describe the SMBIOS is to
quote from the relevant web page, <dmtf.org/standards/smbios>:

"The SMBIOS Specification addresses how motherboard and system
vendors present management information about their products in a
standard format by extending the BIOS interface on x86
architecture systems. The information is intended to allow generic
instrumentation to deliver this information to management
applications that use DMI, CIM or direct access, eliminating the
need for error prone operations like probing system hardware for
presence detection."


As for your memory problem, have you tried swapping DIMMs around?
Placing the bad RAM (if it exists) above the 64KB limit may keep
the motherboard from complaining.  It won't fix anything, but at
least you'll be able to determine if it's a DIMM stick or not.
Also, try running a few passes of Memtest86+ on all of your
memory, not just the lower section.  There may be an addressing
problem which won't show up with a partial test.

Note that this may not be a memory problem, per se.

* A marginal power supply can cause all sorts of strange symptoms.
At least a power supply is easy to swap out.

* There could also be a corrupted setting in your CMOS RAM.  Try
resetting the CMOS.  (This happened to me, btw.  I kept getting
memory failures from brand-new RAM.  Eventually I reset the CMOS
and everything started working correctly.  Oddly enough, the BIOS
screen did not report any changes in the memory settings.)

*  Along those same lines, is the CMOS battery up to snuff?  If
it's not, you can see all sorts of weird problems.

*  Do you have any other boards plugged into your motherboard?  If
so, try removing anything you don't need for booting, and see what
happens.  If everything works, plug the boards back in, one at a
time, and see which one causes the problem.

*  Worst case, your motherboard could have chosen this particular
time to go belly-up.  Not what you want to hear, I know.  But it
could have been on the verge of failure, and switching it off and
on again was all that was needed to push it over the edge.

Hope this helps,
