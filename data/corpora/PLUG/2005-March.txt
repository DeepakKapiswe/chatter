Ya know, I wondered if that was it at first.
But as any good tech, we did the easiest thing and replaced the 
connector and it worked.

I was even able to get in and reset the passwords so I could do setup 
resets as admin.

So, now we get to get serious about that CCNA.


Thanks for the help and advice,

Thanks.  It looks to be the entry in the /etc/php.ini file needs changing.  
I'll do it and see how things work.

It was the /etc/php.ini setting.

A Neat Trick with Apache:  This is  helpful if you are administering
or learning about your apache server.

In your apache server control file, /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf for
redhat, you will find two containers (?) that can be uncommented:
<Location /server-status> and <Location /server-info> .  You then
set the "Allow from: lines, for example:

<Location /server-status>
    SetHandler server-status
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
    #Allow from .example.com
    Allow from 127.0.0.1 .kl-ic.com
</Location>

Server-info is similar.  This allows me to observe the /server-status
from my server, vcolo, and from any of the machines inside my home
network kl-ic.com , like so:

httpd://vcolo/server-status/
httpd://vcolo/server-info/

The first gives me real time information on who is doing what to my
server right now, while the latter tells me how apache is configured
in enormous detail.  Wow!

You may want to set the flag  "ExtendedStatus On".

-----
Note, my system was missing a library:

 /lib/libcom_err.so.3

I copied over /usr/kerberos/lib/libcom_err.so.3.0 from another machine,
and symbolically linked it.  

----
Webalizer is also handy, for longer term statistics.  See Carla's
"Linux Cookbook" for how to install that.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0503011627360.5754-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

We monitor several mail spool systems using a ssh connection (from a
Windows box that runs What's up Gold using PuTTY ) and some simple shell
and perl scripts.  One thing I watching is the maillog with colorize (
perl script ).  Where this goes bad is when logrotate moves the file out
from under colorize , ie. closes the file then opens a new one with the
same name.
   I thought there was a signal that could be sent ( via. kill/killall )  
that caused a process to restart.  But when I tried HUP/SIGHUP it killed
the whole process.  Something in the back brain said HUP ( hangup ) was
the ticket.  Looking in the man pages ( man 7 signal ) I find nothing I
recognize as the proper signal.
   So is there a method that will cause a process to restart?


TIA,

A "stopped" process (suspended w/ ^Z or "kill -STOP") can
be restarted with "kill -CONT". But if ps(1) shows the
process state as "D", you're pretty much hosed.

Signals need the appropriate signal handler in the application
receiving them.  In your case, you want the application to close and
reopen a particular filename.  If the application doesn't provide this
signal handling, you might need to resort to the start/stop init
scripts (in Debian, they are found in /etc/init.d/).  The usual
interface with those is:

  # /etc/init.d/foo restart

where "foo" is the name of the service-start/stopping script.

Maybe that'll work for you.

You might want to check out swatch (http://www.sourceforge.net/swatch):

====
NOTES

Upon receiving a ALRM or HUP signal swatch will re-read the
configuration file and restart, except when used with the --daemon
command line option where it will simply exit.  Swatch will terminate
gracefully when it receives a QUIT, TERM, or INT signal.
====

You could then fire off script in the "postrotate" option in your
logrotate configuration that will send swatch a HUP sig.

This message is usually caused by something holding open a file on that 
device. It could be as simple as a terminal open with a current working 
directory that in on the device.

Keep in mind that open files are copied to memory, so the fact that the 
device isn't there doesn't matter.

In fact, you should never remove a device prior to unmounting it. When 
you do that, you don't allow the system to close the filesystem, and 
could cause corruption. When you reinsert the device, the file system 
could be marked dirty and would need to be cleaned with fsck before 
being mounted.

Thinking about it a little more, it could be the fact that the device 
was removed while mounted that caused this problem in the first place.

Try using lsof to see if any processes have open file descriptors on 
those devices:

   lsof | grep ^/media

This kind of issue isn't hard to resolve but it may take a few steps to
get your system booting. I am working under the assumption that /dev/hdb
is an exact copy of /dev/hda. If it were me I would simply remove hda;
it's dead so get it out of there. Then:

  * Cable /dev/hdb to be the new /dev/hda

  * Update the BIOS if not automaticly done

  * Try to boot

The system will likely not boot at this point as the master boot record
is not updated but it never hurts to try and can save time. If the
system doesn't boot then:

  * Boot to Knoppix CD

  * Run GRUB (probably) or LILO to configure Master Boot Record Here's a
nice bootloader guide:

Let me know how it turns out.

Sorry for the delayed response, I was roaming. #:)

I've had GTE (which became Verizon), Cingular, ATT (before and during
the merger) and T-Mobile, scattered across three states.

My GTE/Verizon experience is from the dark ages of cellular, pre-1990,
obviously not relevant. Cingular and ATT both gave me the usual "there's
a tower right there!" BS when I complained (all the time) about no
coverage. I started with T-Mobile in Hawaii and it was great (that's the
only place where they owned their own network; I think they sold it
though).

So when I cancelled ATT (they cancelled my contract for free because I
complained regularly and articulately), I bought a Sidekick II on
T-Mobile (from Amazon: free after rebates). My plan is $40/month plus
$20 for unlimited data. There's an ssh clinet for it but it's rarely
useful from the places I go. Voice is good, coverage is good (they roam
on Cingular when you leave town), and customer service has been good so
far (it was great in Hawaii, but that's because you always go to a local
call center and customer service is almost always great in Hawaii).

So I'm happy with T-Mobile, but when Nextel has some more featureful
phones, I'd like to give them a try. Their coverage is great as long as
you're near large-scale construction... they like to make sure their
core market is covered. OTOH Sprint will probably try to cut Nextel's
costs to make them more profitable, and that will impact voice quality
for sure.

HTH.

Subject: [PLUG] dnotify detects directory changes
Message-ID: <20050302192716.GA21489@gate.kl-ic.com>


"dnotify" is a program that detects changes to directories (like file
changes or deletes) and executes a script.   I've had problems with
ppp deleting /etc/ppp/pam-secrets (even with pam-secrets set to 400
and /etc/ppp set to 500).  So I set up a call in /etc/inittab :

  papd:2345:respawn:/etc/ppp/papkeeper
  
The papkeeper script contains (among other things):

 /usr/bin/dnotify -D /etc/ppp -e /etc/ppp/papcopy

And the papcopy script contains:

 fpap=/etc/ppp/pap-secrets
 fpapb=/etc/ppp/pap-secrets.bak
 logr="/usr/bin/logger -i -p syslog.err"

 if [ ! -f $fpap ]; then
   $logr -t papkeeper "$fpap replaced"
   /bin/cp $fpapb $fpap
 fi

The inittab respawn line makes sure that there is always one running
copy of my papkeeper script, restarting it if it dies.  The dnotify
program calls the script /etc/ppp/papcopy every time there is a change
to the /etc/ppp directory, or any file in it.  If dnotify terminates,
so does the script, and init respawns it.  dnotify uses existing
structures in the kernel to sleep until something changes;  it does
not need to poll, does not modify the kernel or add modules, and as
it is sleeping most of the time it is not a CPU hog.  It typically
reacts in fractions of a second to file disappearances.

The papcopy script is called for any change in the /etc/ppp
directory, but it ignores all changes except the disappearance
of /etc/ppp/pap-secrets .   That causes it to throw a message to
/var/log/messages , and copy the file from a backup.

Someday, I will find out what I've misconfigured in pppd.  The exact
timing of the dnotify messages to /var/log/messages, in relation to
the messages from pppd itself, will be a big help in that.  But for
now, dnotify is a useful tool for reacting to various file changes; 
when I get time, I will set it to monitoring my wiki and capturing
possible wikispam events.

You can learn more about dnotify at:

What about having your log information sent to a pipe and having the log watch
program monitor that?

For example in /etc/syslog.conf modify like:
  authpriv.*      /var/log/secure
  authpriv.*      |/var/log/logpipe

then have colorize monitor logpipe

create logpipe with `mkfifo /var/log/logpipe`

You don't fill up space with the pipe so you don't need to log rotate it.  The log
rotation won't affect your monitoring process. No need to hup or whatever.

Did you initially say that colorize was a Perl thing?  You could edit the code to
install whatever signal handler you'd like...

The guide is awesome. I cannot write the new grub.conf, though.
Althought it is root writable, it will still not write, is there
something in knoppix that's keeping me from writing to the drive?

I figured it out. The icon I was using (damn icons) was mounting the
partition as read only. re-wrote the grub, but not booting to the drive
yet. will check the partition number, etc right now.

Message-ID: <20050302211103.GA22335@gate.kl-ic.com>


I just had a 250G Maxtor fail on me - sort of.  Took it all the
way down to repartitioning and re-mkfs'ing, and it kept throwing
read access errors.  

I found a handy tool.

The Ultimate Boot CD (http://ubcd.sourceforge.net/) has dozens of
DOS-oid manufacturer's diagnostics disk images on it, including the
Maxtor "PowerMax" tool.  I booted from the CD, and PowerMax told me
my drive had an unrecoverable error.  While I could have shipped the
drive back for replacement, I decided to clean off my sensitive data
with a low level format (also part of the PowerMax suite) before I
let Maxtor see it.  This took 26 hours;  however, when I was done the
error was gone.  I ran the Maxtor diags for a day, then partitioned
and formatted the drive (reiserfs) and I am now running Linux 
read/write tests.  I will do about 40 full-drive tests, lasting
about a week, before I try re-using this disk again.  If it errors
out again, and I have to return it, at least my data will be
multiply overwritten.

So, if you have a dead Maxtor disk, give UBCD and PowerMax a try.
You may not get your data back (that is why you do backups), but you
may get a functional drive.

Some distributions (Fedora and Ubuntu, that I know of) are incorporating 
Gamin, related to FAM, which monitors files and directories:
http://www.gnome.org/~veillard/gamin/index.html

Also, Novell's Robert Love has been working on inotify, a replacement 
for dnotify:

The differences between all of these are lost on me, I'm just providing

This type of error condition is all too common.  It is caused by an interrupted
write (writing while power is not stable).  Depending on how the power changed
during the writing it may affect one or more sectors/tracks.  Excessive reading
of these bad (read mis-written) sectors can cause the drive to report a smart
trip.

There are only two ways to fix this type of problem.  
1) write over the area again ignoring errors. Sorry you data is already gone.
2) Manufacture utility to low level format the disk.

Sorry about the goofy time. Laptop's battery is shot, so the clock is

I've carefully been through the directions and set grub to boot from the
proper image on the correct drive, but it still will not boot. fdisk
shows the partitions as part of the RAID array, still.

I'm using knoppix to copy off the home directory to get ready to install
new drives. 

Is there a way to get it to boot so I can use the RAID to copy the data
onto the new drives?

Damn I hate it when someone has to jog my memory.  I knew of this type of

Syslog will allow multiple 'log-to' lines?  Cool.  I've never seen this 
mentioned.

Yup perl , but as much as I love it I'm still working at learning it 
better.  I'll check out CPAN and pull the Camel from the bookshelf.  Still 
I really like the pipe idea.  Seems more old-time *N*X.

I use a Lexar JumpDrive.  Mine is only 256MB (because I bought it some 
months ago, before the prices on the larger ones fell).  It plays well
with both Linux and Windows, mounting as a scsi drive with a vfat fs
pre-installed.  I actually like it so well that I bought one for each
geek and each college student in my family for Christmas.

I have one of these as well, and it works nicely.  The cap stays on
even in a pocket overstuffed with keys.  The compatibility with
various OSes has been excellent.

The only thing I wish it had is a write-protect switch.  Then I could
plug it into strange computers without feeling dirty afterwards.

I've been happy with my SanDisk "Cruzer Mini". It's been perfectly
reliable under all variety of Linux systems, though occasionally
Windows has issues (not sure if this is related to it being used under
Linux). It has a pretty slim form factor. I never notice it in my
pocket.

If multitasking is not a goal, my experience says they all mostly the same. 
        Some things I'd like to see are caps that don't get lost or 
spuriously disassociate with the main body.  I suggest getting a USB 
extension cord at least until USB connectors are ubiquitous amongst monitor 
vendors and their offered wares.  I think most of these come pre-formatted 
with fat32(??).

One interesting one I did see has a hinged mid section and uses card flash 
for storage rather that being simply fixed media.

Keith responds:

Gamin is an alternative to FAM, which is an API for user space
C programs.  The "dnotify" I was talking about is a user application
that can be called from a shell.

Robert Love's "inotify" is a replacement for the "dnotify" kernel
code, and is also not a user application.  Yes, "dnotify" is two
different things, a set of kernel code to track files, and an
executable that (for now) uses the kernel code.  The "dnotify"
user program probably can be adapted to the newer (and still
experimental) inotify code when that becomes generally available.

Robert Love's rather childish rant about the evils of the "dnotify"
kernel code is offputting;  however, he does point out that a file
system with a directory being watched with the "dnotify" program
and using the "dnotify" kernel code may be difficult to unmount. 
My scripts are looking at stuff in /etc, which is always mounted
when init is running;  however, in general users probably should
make sure all dnotify processes pointing at a filesystem are stopped
before trying to unmount that filesystem.

The inotify kernel code seems to penetrate pretty deep into the
linux virtualization layer.  So,  I wonder how compatible it is
with various high-performance file systems, and whether that (or
Mr. Love's fetching ways ) will slow it's general acceptance?

I'm rather unhappy with mine.  It causes hangs and reboots on various 
Linux or Windows systems.  I've had much better luck with my PNY drive.

Well, I'm probably going to be in the minority with this, but here it
goes. 

I prefer the SanDisk Cruizer that takes the SD-Disk. The advantage is
that I can upgrade the SD disk when a new one comes out. Perhaps this
sounds fickle, but I've upgraded all the way from 32MB up to my current
256MB card!!

Other USB type storage devices aren't upgradeable. They're disposable.

Okay. This and below makes things somewhat tighter but within tolerance.

I have a (short) checklist of things to look for:

  1) Is the primary partition marked "bootable?" This usually does not
matter these days but never hurts to have it there. Use fdisk.

  2) Are all the partitions there with data intact? I ask as this was a
part of a RAID set. This adds a layer of variability that should be
checked.

 
Finally, a question: do you get to the GRUB graphical menu upon starting
our computer? If so, GRUB is configured correctly. If not, try your grub
configuration again. Remember, you want to boot to your /boot

Here's an example of my /boot/grub/grub.conf:

  # For booting Primary Desktop Computer
  title Personal Desktop Computer
   root (hd0,4)
  kernel (hd0,4)/kernel-2.6.10 root=/dev/ram0 init=/linuxrc
real_root=/dev/hda1 splash=verbose hdc=scsi-cd vga=0x317 splash=verbose
video=vfb
  initrd (hd0,4)/initrd-2.6.10

   # For booting Mosix Cluster Node
   title Mosix Cluster Kernel
   root (hd0,4)
   kernel (hd0,4)/kernel-2.4.26-om1 root=/dev/ram0 init=/linuxrc
real_root=/dev/hda1 splash=verbose hdc=ide-cd vga=0x317
   initrd (hd0,4)/initrd-2.4.26-om1

Note that my /etc/fstab looks like this:
  /dev/hda1               /               ext2            noatime
0 0
  /dev/hda5               /boot           ext2            noauto,noatime

Yes, if the kernel you are booting from on the CD supports your RAID
controller (SCSI) or RAID IDE interface. Here's a link to the RAID FAQ
for help: http://www.faqs.org/contrib/linux-raid/x37.html

I have two of the Lexar "thumb shaped" Jump drives, a 256 and a 512. I 
reformatted them to get rid of the built in Windows-specific stuff and 
they work just fine. I also have a 1 GB Lexar Jump drive. They're 
actually a tad on the slow side; for transferring data between two 
machines, a CD-RW is often faster, including the erase.

I've got to wonder how much that is worth. Unless SD cards are the same
price or cheaper you're not saving by just replacing the card. I was
looking at ENU's web page, and didn't seem them listing SD at all.

I used to have a "pretty slim form factor" drive, that "I never noticed

Now I carry one of the little Iomega drives with the hinged cap.  This
guy is even smaller than my first drive, about 1.5 inches long.  It
fits in the little change pouch that I carry, and the change pouch is
big enough to always notice.  So that may be a clue, get a drive that
fits in something else that you always carry.  Hierarchy.

Both the previous thumb drive and this one "just work".  I mount mine
with "mount /flash".  You can also make this automatic.

Hmmm... That depends on if you've got other devices which take the SD
cards.
Personally my PDA/Phone, camera, and computer all accept the SD cards.

The "Cruzer Micro" has been working well for me.  It's somewhat
smaller than the mini, and comes with a hefty end cap now:

I have the following in a shell script:

open ftp.somesite.com
user someuser somepass
pass
mput somefiles*
bye
EOF


Is there a way to log all the information from the FTP transaction
that you would normally see if this was done manually?

I was with AT&T from the mid 90's, but recently changed to Vorizon. 
Primarily because every time I was on the Oregon Coast, and needed to 
make a call, Vorizon offered to connect me if I provided a credit card. 
Secondary reason is that is what my employer uses.

I copied over a newer version of script that supports the -c option
for running a script, however, it still doesn't log the transaction
between the EOF markers.

Hmmm...  How would I use script within a... script?

For example, the following doesn't work:

#!/bin/bash

script test.out

/usr/kerberos/bin/ftp -i -n -u <<EOF
open ftp.somesite.com
user someuser somepass
pass
mput somefiles*
bye
EOF

exit


It just keeps logging everything and never ends the script.

Got it.  I enclosed all the FTP lines in double-quotes and it worked.

There's more to consider than the purely monetary economic cost.  (And why 
do folks seem to always operate as if that one factor is the most 
important?)

You'd need to know whether the manufacture of SD cards consume more or 
less energy and materials and what sort of "externalities" are introduced 
by the production (pollution, subsidies, worker compensation, risk and 
living conditions, etc.) as compared to one-piece USB drives.  Then the 
disposable/upgradeable argument can have some concrete value.

Personally, I'm on the lookout for a 1GB USB drive/MP3 player that 
supports playlists and ID3 tags (with sorting by tag field) and has an 
LCD.

I suspect this will suit my portable data needs for some very long time 
(assuming durability).

Does anyone know of such a beast?

I do believe one method to do this is using script.

     script - make typescript of terminal session

     script makes a typescript of everything printed on your terminal.

I've had my eye on one of the iRiver flash-based players. They seem to
fit your requirements. Plays MP3 and Ogg; supports playlists and
metadata tags; appears as a USB mass storage device to the host
system.

I'm starting to get lost in my iptable rules and was wanting to add some
logging rules.  While searching on da'web I came across an article
comparing NetFilter automation tools.  The one tha caught my eye was ferm
( for easy rule making ) but the last update appears to be late 2003.  So
either it is really good or been kind-of abandoned.

This is _not_ for a firewall system but for a Vserver so there are 
_rather_ complex or rather *loads* of rules that I've pounded together.

Are there other options that make iptable rules.  What are you using , if 
anything , beside vi and a clue ( like Wil ;-).  I can do the vi but 
running short on clues.

I work with our planned speaker, Dan Carrere, in Springfield.
Due to health issues (a bad case of the flu), neither of us can
make it to Portland tonight.  As a result,

    -  Eric Harrison will lead a discussion of selected topics,
       things people are having problems with  and want to discuss.
       We used to do this from time to time, but haven't in quite
       awhile.

    -  We have a speaker scheduled for April (on Open Source GIS).

    -  Dan Carrere has rescheduled the voice over IP talk for May.

                                          Sincerely,

Maybe someone here has seen this before.  I've got a server running
Courier IMAP and clients are not able to empty the Trash folder using
Thunderbird, Outlook, or IMP.  The message gets marked as deleted, but
then gets unmarked if you try to purge deleted messages.

VERY close.  I don't need any of the recording functions or FM receiver 
and I would prefer a built-in USB key.

It's also about twice the price that I'd be willing to pay for such a 
device.

Although it doesn't support playlists or metadata, I really like this 
little guy:

<URL: http://www.sandisk.com/download/photos/retail/mp3comp-wcruzer-lite.jpg >

(can't find the product page, oddly.)

You plug the tiny cruzer micro into this thing and it plays the MP3s 
there.  If it supported playlists and metadata, I would order one today.

Message-ID: <20050304021711.GA20364@subtend.net>

I use the quiteinsane module for gimp to scan 
documents.  The puzzling issue is that it won't detect 
the scanner unless running gimp as root.

I tried running strace on both gimp and 
sane-find-scanner.  I've given myself perms on all 
devices under /dev/usb.

It seems that sane-find-scanner detects nothing on any 
of the usb devices, but find it via libusb, which I'm 
not sure how libusb is finding it.

I would be cool to find the right areas to give me 
permission to so I can stop running gimp as root.

the only tools I've seen have been focused around firewall configuration.  A 
tool I've been using for years is fwbuilder.  It's gotten quite 
sophisticated and well worth checking out.  It may meet the needs you stated 
above.

It appears that SuSE 9.1 personal has somehow disabled the samba server

Can anyone confirm this?

Thanks Keith.  I'll look at it.  I'll also hit the Vserver list to see 
what other Vserver users are handling this with.

I've been using shorewall...it's excellent for my firewall-ish
iptrables rule needs. I'm not sure how well it suits your purpose, but
the documentation and examples are extensive if you want to give it a
look.

If you can live without the LCD, the ipod shuffle would work for you.
You would need Windows or a mac to manage the music it since I am not
aware of a Linux version of iTunes.

Newer versions of Rhythmbox should support it and gtkpod as well..
gtkpod would probably be your easiest bet.

I have a cron job that calls a shell script shown below.  The rsync

The same script runs correctly when called from the command line.

Frequently this is due to something in your environment, or rather 
something that's missing from your cron job's environment. Try putting 
this line in your script:

   env > /tmp/my-cron-script.env

Let the cron job run then compare the contents of /tmp/my-cron-script.env 
to what you get when you run the env command from your shell prompt.

Just tried that.  Although rsync resides at /usr/bin/rsync, which is
in both paths, I put the explicit path in the shell script and still
had no joy.  An excellent suggestion though,  really thought that was
the answer.

The other thing I thought _might_ be relevant was the use of ~/foo.  I
am not certain that will expand as you expect in cron context.

BTW, where did Brian Martin hide his scripting infrastructure stuff he
presented at the AT talk last month?

I noticed that your shell is different in both as well.  shouldn't
that have been changed since you say use /bin/bash at the top but the
env > line echo's out /bin/sh?  I don't know but seems odd.  So,
perhaps each shell is just slightly different to cause you troubles.

I'd she running a /bin/sh shell then running the script and seeing if
it works and also make sure all paths are absolute.  Also, I think
there is a /bin/bask -k or -e options that you can put in the script
that echo everything back out.  I forget been a while since I debuged
a script.

Subject: [PLUG] DVR security systems
Message-ID: <200503041844.21153.carla@bratgrrl.com>

I'm looking into installing a video security system, for outdoors, and after a 
couple of hours of googling am feeling a bit overwhelmed. The devices don't 
have to be weatherproof, I can build some kind of housing. Maybe disguise 
them as birdhouses. I want a four-camera system, possibly with infrared for 
night imaging. I have a couple of outbuildings to watch, so wireless would be 
nice for them. The other two will be mounted on the outside of my house. I 
think a DVR system is the way to go, but there are also some slick little 
standalone units that might work for the outbuildings. 

I want to be able to record images and have some kind of portable playback, 
like printing hard copies or copying to a CD or DVD.

Anyone have experience with these? Will an ordinary TV-enabled video card turn 
a PC into a DVR? How much do you have to spend to get decent video quality? 
There's an awful lot of different options, and of course I don't want to 
break the bank. Tips and useful links are welcome.

The weirdness just gets weirder.  In an effort to reduce the
variables, I plugged just one of the rsync lines into "crontab -e" and
it still won't run.  At least I know there is nothing wrong with my
script.

Is is possible that rsync lives somewhere on your path that is not accessible to
the cron script?

Hmm.

Where is exclude.txt? Have you tried specifying its full path?

Subject: [PLUG] Make offer: Dorio 20 mutil-port serial terminal
Message-ID: <20050304224741.A15830@kudzuforest.com>


I have gotten rid of all my serial port console workstations, dreams, and desires,
so now I have this beautiful Dorio 20 multi-port serial terminal just taking
up space.  It's really nice, and works well.  It has three COM ports and a printer
port, and uses a standard PS/2 keyboard and IEC320 computer power cable.

The terminal features configuration for 4 ports between which you can switch,
but I never figured out how to do 4 sessions with 3 COM ports...  Maybe one of 
the DB25s actually supports two lines.  I also never figured out how to do 
split-screen mode between two inputs.

But if you just need a basic serial terminal for a console, this is a great
piece of equipment that I hate to junk.

I live in Salem, but will probably be making a trip to FreeGeek in the next
week to give away some other things.  I thought the terminal might have some 
hacker interest.  If you are willing to meet me at the Fry's in Wilsonville, 
or another not-so-out- of-the-way place along I-5 between Salem and Portland, 
it's yours.  If we cannot find a time/place to meet, I'll let the next interested 
party have a crack at it.

Please respond to me via DIRECT emai, as I may not check the list regularly.
If you have any questions, email those as well.  First reasonable offer will
be accepted; I'll entertain offers in the order received.  I'll try to make
it fair, but I mostly just want this thing out of here and into the hands of
someone who will use it.

> Cron job that doesn't run ...

You should always run cron as if you have no environment, no path,
nothing.  So all commands should be sourced from root, for example:

/usr/bin/rsync -Cavz ...
... --exclude-from=/home/mike/exclude.txt ...
/usr/bin/scp ...
/bin/echo `/bin/date` >> ...

And always replace ~ with your full address.  It ain't /home/mike
if it ain't you runnin' it.  Or as Dorothy said, "there's no place
like home" :-)

Yes, sometimes cron knows.  But sometimes it knows the wrong thing;
it does not use your identical path or environment.  Never assume
anything about a script's environment (cron or otherwise), and it
will be more robust.

If the full path is too much typing, consider shell variables. 
Here are some you might define:

RSYNC='/usr/bin/rsync'
EXCLUDE='/home/mike/exclude.txt'                      # or wherever
RSYNCOPTS="-Cavz --delete --exclude-from=$EXCLUDE"
ARRAY='mike at opsis:Array'
TARGET='/home/backup'

... and your commands become

$RSYNC $RSYNCOPTS $ARRAY/Marketing  $TARGET
$RSYNC $RSYNCOPTS $ARRAY/Accounting $TARGET

Now it becomes easy to make this into a loop, for all your sources:

for source in Marketing Accounting
do
  $RSYNC $RSYNCOPTS $ARRAY/$source   $TARGET
done

You can do the same with echo, scp, date, etc...

Shell variables (near the start of the program) are Your Friends.
They save you a lot of retyping if something changes, or you decide
to use a different command or re-arrange your files.  If implemented
correctly, shell variables also allow you to radically change how
stuff works; for example, using a function that calls logger instead
of an scp to an over-written log file.  

- - -

Lastly, if you are doing backups, may I suggest you look at dirvish?
( www.dirvish.org )  It is a bit of overkill for what you are doing
now, but when you develop a full backup procedure, with history and
incrementals and security and file restores and such, you will find
dirvish much easier to maintain than re-inventing the wheel.  And
the upgrades are free!

Happy hacking!

If you can get past the advertising hype, the stuff at X10.com in the
camera section
is pretty good.  Sometimes you will see some of this stuff at Fry's
but mostly the
wired single camera systems. These systems with the receiver for wireless output
NTSC video.  Any BT848 video card should come up fine in linux with
the v4linux drivers
configured.  

I found an article in Linux Journal on "GNU motion*" that will
grab stuff from a v4linux device and only store images when things change.

X10 video was mentioned as a wireless option (sorry - I deleted when I meant 
to reply). I have used their wireless camera system for an event at OMSI and 
can attest to it's reasonable quality. There are some pictures of the 
equipment as part of the event, here:

http://home.comcast.net/~rsteff.p/Pathfinder/index.html

In addition to a color camera that sends video to a receiver that outputs NTSC 
video, they also have a remote controlled pan/tilt head. I used two cameras 
in the activity (meant to give kids some sense of controlling a rover on 
Mars). One was mounted on the "rover" and one on the "lander." One of the 
pictures shows a couple of Commodore monitors with the video from the 
cameras. (Not the best photo, but the video is clean.)

There are 4 channels for the cameras. They operate in the same frequency space 
as one of the wireless ethernet systems (B, I think). The Portland State 
rocket guys use wireless ethernet to control their rocket, and we discovered 
that we were interfering with each other. By switching our cameras to 
channels 3 and 4, (or is it C & D?) it cleaned up the problem.

The cameras can run on battery, but you'd have to go out and replace them 
frequently, so for a security system, that's something of a problem. 
Otherwise, these should work.

These guys, 

http://www.smarthome.com/

have a lot of X10 stuff as well as other home security products. You mentioned 
a recorder: I don't know if it's what you had it mind, but they have time 
lapse recorders that will let you cram many hours onto a regular VHS tape.

Hi all,

I'm running a computer with an FC2/Win2000 dual boot.  I need to set it
up on my wireless network, but I don't know what sort of card would be
good for FC2, or how to set it up for that matter.  Does anyone have
any personal experience on good hardware I can look at that would be
suitable?  

Internal or external.  I'm not picky.

Depends on if you're doing it for a webcam or security.  If you're going 
for security cameras, you're better off getting a standard security 
camera and a VCR.  If you actually have to use that footage to get a 
face or license plate from at a distance, whoever has to look at that 
footage will have nothing to zoom in on with a digital system 
(pixelated nature of digital pictures instantly obscures detail at a 
distance like a suspect on COPS).

I looked into this a couple of years ago, and the most versitale
solution I could come up with was network cameras.  Axis, www.axis.com
has a large variety of indoor and outdoor, some with pan/tilt and can be
powered through the ethernet cable.  The major advantage is that you
don't need a video capture device on the monitoring PC, just an network
connection.  This system is highly scalable and very easy to
(re)configure.  Wireless is nice, but you still have a power problem to
deal with.

At that time, Motion was just getting to the usable stage and from the
Linux Journal article I recently read, it looks like it has gotten more
robust and has more features.

There are two ways to go wireless on Linux: easy, or excruciatingly painful. 
The pain comes from idiot hardware vendors changing their wireless chipsets 
every other day, almost always to some weird thing that is not supported in 
Linux. The easy way is to buy a Senao/EnGenius 2511 card, like this one with 
a built-in antenna:
http://www.netgate.com/product_info.php?cPath=26_39&products_id=42

The Senao card also comes in PCI, and can take an external antenna. It has 
about 7 times the transmitting power of most other PCI adapters, so you won't 
have a lot of dropped connections or slow speeds. Fedora should autodetect 
the card and load the correct drivers, all you have to do is enter your 
network configs. http://fedoranews.org/ is a good help resource.

I would suggest an internal card that has the prism GT/Duette chipset. 
This gets you native Linux drivers. CONFIG_PRISM54 in kernel config.

Subject: [PLUG] Any FOSS packet forwarders for TCP between cellphones?
Message-ID: <20050306184432.GX8825@peak.org>

My hobby project (xwords.sourceforge.net) is a game that runs on PDAs
and smartphones.  I'm working on extending multi-device play to
include TCP over cellular networks, but there's a huge problem: most
carriers configure their networks so that phones don't receive
connection attempts (or in the UDP case, packets that aren't
responses.)

The obvious solution is to run a forwarding server to which all the
devices connect.  I threw one together yesterday, but I'm not a server
programmer and don't have time to become one now.  Does anybody know
of an open source product that can be configured to do this?

Alternatively, if these things exist what are they called?  Googling
for stuff like "smartphone NAT packet forward" turns up too many hits
to be useful.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <1109796178.42262552640e4@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

The good news is that I got one up using ndiswrapper-1.0 and the
most recent stock 2.6.10 kernel for Fedora Core 3 on  my P4.  
Now the question, what can my 300 mhz machine run?  I'm 
wondering if Slackware 10.1 will also work.  I'd need to figure 
out how to install 2.6.10 to Slackware 10.1.  The bad news is 
that I have a lot of work ahead to create a new nfs exported 
root for my K6-2 300.  I wish I could emulate a K6-2 300 on 
my Pentium 4 to install Slackware 10.1 to.

At least I've gotten one of these cards to work on a Linux 
system finally.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0503030021310.10451-100000@goose.robinson-west.com>

It won't work as an AP, but I can 
get it to work for ad-hoc 
connections.

Without even orienting the antenna 
in the right direction, I know I 
can reach at least one place worth 
getting to.  I'm sure I can do a 
long range wireless network even 
if I have to do multiple hops.  
I don't know how to activate WEP. 
There's something called WPA 
also.  I'm using the Windows XP 
driver from RealTek's webiste 
with ndiswrapper-1.0, 
Slackware-10.1, and a 2.6.10 kernel.

One gotcha is that you must compile 
usb support as a module and modules 
for usb hub support seem to be needed 
as well.  My wifi adapter isn't USB 
based, but ndiswrapper probably 
requires USB hooks in the kernel
for other wireless adapters that 
are.

NFS root with Slackware-10.1 is a 
cinch.  All I had to do was add a 
single if in rc.S to 
bypass the file system check and 
voila.  I wish I knew how to turn 
hotplug support off.  I don't 
have anything in my router box 
that needs that.  The way the
the Slackware 10.1 modutils
work with both 2.4 and 2.6
kernels is sweet.

I can run these cards in ad-hoc 
mode.  I don't know if ndiswrapper 
with the most recent XP driver 
can operate the card as an access 
point, but I can at least establish 
point to point links now.

On any 2.6 based Linux system ndiswrapper 1.0 will support Realtek 
8180 chipset cards using the Windows XP driver.  The best cards to 
get are Orinoco Classic Gold and Prism based adapters.  Any PCI 
based PC card adapter should work for a standup.  

Orinoco and the like are better because there are open source 
drivers and if I'm not mistaken, you can build access points 
using these adapters.

If you need antennas, check out http://www.etherdesigns.com/

The important thing is to search google for success stories 
before buying a wireless card.  Don't just go for something 
the minute there's any mention of opeability with Linux, 
find comments on Slashdot etc.  Watch out for cards that use
proprietary Linux drivers which don't work well or at all.

I recently bought a Gateway WBM-120; I got it for $10 on eBay.  It's a
rebranded GemTek card, which uses a Prism chipset and works fine on FC3
after adding the card IDs to the PCMCIA config (see http://nakedape.cc/wiki
for full details).

That said, I'm told the Lucent Golds are on sale at Fry's for about $25.

I'm a Gentoo user (and a Fedora user, and a Debian user), but I

All you really want is a way to receive and then reply to messages, right?
The ACE network programming framework could get you moving in the right
direction.
http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html
Another route would be to program and configure web services to send
the data back. Projects like soap would help in this.

Howdy all,

I purchased a Sharp SL-6000 a few months ago to act as my main PDA and 
the thing is just too big. It's pretty neat though. I've flashed it with 
several of the other distro's for the Zaurus and played around with 
them. It works well enough for a Linux toy, but not well enough to be 
used as my main PDA. I was thinking of putting it on eBay, but then I 
figured I'd let you guys have a crack at it first. I'd like to get $400 
for it, but am willing to negotiate. For you guys, I'll throw in the 
256meg CF card I bought for it, and my home made battery chargers. I 
can't find the disk that came with it, but I have all the manuals. I 
never used the disk, it only has windows sync software on it.

Email me directly if you're interested. Please post any complaints to 
the list :P

I'm not sure I understand your question, but you might take a look at
simpleproxy for TCP forwarding:

http://freshmeat.net/projects/simpleproxy

And for UDP forwarding, try my proxy (which forwards to one address
only):

http://evanheidtmann.info/hlds-proxy/

I hope one of these helps you.

I have one of those too ... I might be interested. I'd certainly like to 
know what you loaded on it, where it came from, etc., and especially how 
to get the screen size on the shell prompt to the point where it's 
readable! When I first got it, I went web surfing, only to discover that 
Sharp had de-commissioned it as a consumer product with that sort of 
support, and all the hacker sites had only stuff for the 5500 or the 
Japanese clamshell versions. So ... mine is idle too, although if I had 
a pair of them I could at least have one virgin and one crash-and-burn, 
connected by infrared. :)

I have two too.  But I'm not interested in a gentoo-only group.  I can't
imagine what would make it interesting as such.

Hi all,

Sometimes in LDAP I see groups defined under ou=Group (singular)
and others ou=Groups (plural). Other than possibly having to tweak
your LDAP admin tools for one or the other, does the choice of
ou=Group vs. ou=Groups matter in any significant way?

Thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] fonts/gimp
Message-ID: <1110396484.27420.5.camel@apollo.spears.org>

I was just reading the info for gimp (rpm -qi gimp) and I noticed that
they recommend installing a couple of packages of fonts,
ftp.gimp.org/pub/gimp/fonts/freefonts-0.10.tar.gz
and
ftp.gimp.org/pub/gimp/fonts/sharefonts-0.10.tar.gz
The README file in freefonts-0.10.tar.gz says to cd
to  /usr/X11/lib/fonts and untar.  On my Fedora 3 system, I think this
is equivalent to /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts, which contains a lot of
subdirs: 100dpi  75dpi  CID  OTF  Speedo  TTF  Type1  encodings  local
misc  util.  After untarring, there would be a new directory freefonts.

I'm concerned that this advice may be out of date.  Does any  gimp user
know whether installing these fonts this way works or is beneficial or
is unnecessay?

No, the structures as such are purely conventional.  More complex
heirarchies end up tossing those aside.

I've tried gentoo, but I admittedly haven't been very impressed
with it thus far.

I'd say it's for experts because you can't willy nilly
set the use flags.  I imagine there are some secrets
to getting everything working.  Then again, I installed
on a Dell laptop where laptops notorious for being
slightly incompatible with Linux.

In theory being forced to compile everything is an interesting 
idea, but from a practical standpoint I'd have to say that
gentoo has quite a way to go before binary based Linux
distributions will be a thing of the past.

Subject: [PLUG] Encrypting email...
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0503080024450.13597-100000@goose.robinson-west.com>

I've had a problem with unauthorized access of a 
Horde IMP accessible email account.  I'm curious 
about encrypting the messages in the account so 
that an individual who intercepts them is far 
less likely to know their content.  In essence,
I want someone who figures out the password
to only get garbage if they don't know the
decryption secret.

Lately, this person and I have agreed to cease 
communicating for a decent length of time hoping 
to discourage the thief.

I've learned that the password was known by 
the thief.  The old password, pocahontas,
was too simple.  Then again, it wasn't like
anyone was supposed to know this email 
account existed for her and I didn't expect
anyone to guess the password.  I didn't
notice any failed logins, so I don't think
this person ever had to guess.

At this point, I've limited remote 
logins by ip and I changed the 
password.  Unfortunately, this 
person has said that he/she can 
figure out the password regardless 
of what it's set to.

I have a feeling her ISP based email
accounts will be hacked or via 
some clever dishonesty gotten into.
Oh well.  I suppose she can give 
email up completely except for safe 
messages that she has to send.

I realize encryption isn't a solution,
but it could at least slow the thief.  
If it slows the thief enough, 
maybe my friend and I can 
communicate again in this way.  
There's a telephone, but when it is 
used there is an easily obtained 
record of the call.  If I had known
the password was going to leak, I
might have declared a communication
blackout months ago.

For starters, I'm thinking I can encrypt 
messages by mapping the alphabet to a 
different set of 26 symbols.  I figure 
I can start with a mixture of numbers 
and letters.  I would be nice if I had 
a program I can email to that will
encrypt the message and then forward
it on to her account.  I figure if I
have five different mappings and 
a random one is used for each paragraph
in an email, that that should be 
reasonably hard to crack.  Maybe some
letters should be replaced with two
symbols so that a cracker doesn't
know the length of the original
word.  If I have say nine symbols
to replace spaces with and I use
them randomly, it should be very 
hard to decipher the message.

(TONS of extra fluff deleted. Leave out the extra stuff, just ask the 
pertinent questions. We don't care about your private life. This will 
also make your posts much shorter and easier to decypher.)

First question...

Is the email accessible through the web?

If yes, do you encrypt that connection?

If no, then there's your hole. A packet sniffer will reveal the password.

The same holds true for pop3 and imap. If the connections aren't 
encrypted, the password is in cleartext.

Remember that all of these conversations are archived and searchable.
Also remember that security is only as good as the weakest link/password.

Try this for a start.

And encryption is moot if the client machine has a keylogger installed
on it, as is common on windows machines.

There's a number of ways the user's password could have been compromised
without requiring any guessing on the part of the attacker, from sticky
notes to using the same known password from another compromised email
account.

The secret to USE flags is to stick with the defaults at first, then 
modify them and re-emerge as features are needed. Actually, Portage has 
a recent addition, "emerge --newuse world", which rebuilds anything that 
needs rebuilding because a USE flag changed.

I would agree if the binary distros would standardize (for x86) on i686 
compilation. I have three machines -- a P3, an Athlon XP and an Athlon 
Tbird, and I find i686 compilation acceptable except for 
numeric-intensive code like R. That way I can have a common package 
repository and not have to recompile as often.

You can count me in! I have four gentoo systems and I use them for everything
around the house (NFS, web tiki, mail, etc.)

On a personal note, Is it just me or does anyone else find gentoo at least
slightly addictive when you use distccd and run multipile systems and building
binary packages?  I feel that once you have a such a system in place it makes
the distinctions between binary / source distro a little more blurry.  

Regards,
Max

Not the answer, but a good read:

find -type d

ls -l | grep '^d'

Or to list only the current directory (not all directories from the
start down):

 $ find . -type d -maxdepth 1

And to get a more detailed listing of the directories:

 $ find . -type d -maxdepth 1 | xargs ls -l

Rich,

Try this, I think it's what you want.

ls -la | grep ^d

gnu find (and others, I recall solaris find supporting it as well)
support the -ls argument, so you can do:

  find . -type d -maxdepth 1 -ls 

to see the attribute information on the directories themselves (-ls is
the equivalent of 'ls -dils' according to the manpage).

Historically, find . -type d -print

POSIX modified that, making the -print optional if the expression
doesn't contain -exec, -ok, or -print.  Cool.

I'm just one of those (--^), but it looks like gnuplot could do it 
(maybe with the help of octave?)  Then there's Matlab.  I've only ever 
used gnuplot for 2D stuff, but it seems to have the "unix style" of 
just doing the plotting and leaving the analysis to another program.

Sounds like a kernel config issue.  Build a new kernel with the options
customized for your hardware.  Use lspci and cat /proc/cpuinfo to find
out what all the hardware is.

If you are running a stock distro kernel, it is sure to be bloated
beyond reason with completely unnecessary drivers.  This increases the
risk of conflicts.  It also eats up RAM for no reason (at least the
compiled-in code does).

Go to /usr/src/linux as root and run "make menuconfig", and browse
around Device Drivers -> Sound.  If it won't start, make sure your
config file (/boot/config<something>) is copied to
/usr/src/linux/.config .

Also run lsmod to see if you have any sound modules loaded.  You almost
never see stock kernels with these drivers compiled into the kernel,
therefore they would show up here.

Sometimes you'll be sure that you're tweaking the right config option,
but it won't work.  Those situations call for a bit of trial and error
with compiling the option into the bzImage vs. compiling it as a kernel
module.  Sometimes conflicts can be circumvented this way.  I had this
happen once recently - with alsa drivers!  I absolutely had to compile
my sound driver as a module.  Not my favorite setup - I like everything
that I'll ALWAYS want up and running compiled into the kernel, so I
won't be down if module loading breaks.

Throw in a knoppix disk and see if sound works when booted up under it.
Choose the 2.6 kernel at boot time by typing "knoppix26".  If
sound works under knoppix, run lsmod and compare to your FC3 list.

Adjust /etc/modules to look for the right modules to load at system init
time.  Maybe fedora has a module-management mechanism?  I don't know - I
use a well-seasoned knoppix load that's been passed around a bit.
Knoppix does have a module list management feature.  On my machine, I
would modify /etc/modules_<kernel_version> instead of the actual
/etc/modules file, because knoppix has a startup script that finds the
/etc/modules<kernel_version> variant that matches your current kernel
version, and copies that file to /etc/modules.  So /etc/modules gets
overwritten at every boot.  It goes along with their dual-kernel CDs,
where you have a choice between a 2.4 or a 2.6 kernel.  The 2 kernels
have different module requirements, and the same modules have different
names.  Anyway, be on the lookout for that kind of thing on fedira.

Sometimes th problem is just that the sound is muted. 
Run alsamixer and make sure that the volume is turned
up and not muted. If that is not the problem then the
correct modules are not being loaded.

I've only played with it a little, but XSLT is pretty commonly used for 
generating HTML from XML templates and data. CPAN has a few Perl modules 
for XSLT processing.

Apparently, there's built in XSL processing in nmap.  I haven't

This is a known problem in FC3 with a large number (but not all) sound
chips. I can happen in FC2 as well if you upgrade to a 2.6.10 kernel.

The basic problem (at least for my chips) is that certain mixer settings
are not getting set to sensible defaults. And even if you finally get
them set correctly yourself, an actl save/restore cycle (as when rebooting)
doesn't restore them correctly.

You can usually get it to work just by finding that mystery mixer setting
that's getting in the way. For the chip on my laptop it's the mixer's DAC
switch. On my HTPC it's the input capture selector.

   I've found excellent advice and service at ENU. You might also call
Northwest Computer Support in Beaverton and ask them about different makes
and models from a reliability viewpoint. For linux-specific portables I
endorse EmperorLinux without hesitiation.

I had this exact same set up and had the same problem, I ended up
pulling the emu card before I found the fix, but it turned out that the
mixer (I use Kmix) had set my SB card to use digital out as the default,
I changed that to analog and the problem was fixed.

Message-ID: <4231CB4A.9030000@aracnet.com>

HI All,
new project:

I need input from those of you that do cabling.

I need a couple of good brands and model numbers for ethernet cable 
testing devices.

Middle to lower-end as it's for me and my pocket book still hasn't 
recovered as quickly as the oil companies have.

I'm looking at Siemons and Fluke and a device from Trendware(?) but it's 
really just to let me know when I've screwed up building a cable(crossed 
wires or when the roll-over is wired as a cross-over). I came to this 
conclusion of need when it took me thirty tries to get one roll-over 
correctly.

Any and all suggestions will be greatly appreciated and your expertise 
kindly remembered.

thanks in advance,


Harry

We just picked up a Paladin Tools (R) LAN Cable-Check (TM) 1574, and it
serves us fine.  It's the basic, cheap model and doesn't check the
ground wire, just the eight leads.  We had a better model previously,
same make, which tested the ground, but it was defective.

I've used Fluke's "NetTool", which does a fair amount more than cable
testing.

Works great, and is extremely easy to use. Simple enough that our
internal IT helpdesk folks can use it to test connectivity, cable
distance, 10/100 f/h duplex, signal strength, crossovers, etc, on
ethernet jacks.

In the Linux Journal weekly reader this week there was a reference to a utility called
xsel. It does just what you're asking.

There's a debian package for unstable, for everyone else there's a tgz that compiles
and installs very quickly.

  http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/

For Ovid's original need one can edit away in vi and then:

  :%!xsel

and then middle click in the HTML text area for a paste. 
  WARNING
This will cause an effective cut of the buffer contents so you'll need to follow up 
with a `u` to undo the command. 

The LJ snip about the utility:

  Tech Tip

   Want to write a shell script that works with the user's selected text
   from a different X application? Use xsel. For example, you can count
   the number of words in the selected text with

xsel -o | wc -w

   Other command-line options are available to get and set the X
   "clipboard" and the little-used "secondary selection", too. For more
   information, check out the xsel Web site:

Message-ID: <1110583307.6289.10.camel@localhost>

All,

I was just handed a 400 MHz. Machine for free. Now, the truth is that I
have more machines than I know what to do with. I said that I would
probably give the machine away to FreeGeek or other such charity.

Then the thought occured to me that there are likely others in the same
boat: one too many boxes but no real avenue to get rid of it and at the
same time make a little change.

So I just thought of the idea of having a kind of PC garage sale. I
recall an article on the net that talks about doing this. An example of
organization is using different colors of stickers to identify each
sale.

The house could take, say, 10 per cent of the cut for a working
computer. For that the house can clean the computer and even perhaps
install Linux on it. This helps create value for the computer.

Let's do this!

Well, I'm certainly happy with my dual-booted (XP Home and Gentoo) 
Compaq Presario. If I were buying a laptop specifically for Linux, I'd 
probably go with a ThinkPad, though.

Another thought is to set up a cluster in an underfunded high school 
science program somewhere. Although, now that I think of it, FreeGeek 
probably has enough systems healthy enough to make a "FreeCluster" that 
such schools could tap. For example, with the Quantian LiveCD or 
LiveDVD, any PC or set of PCs that can boot a CD or DVD can become part 
of a cluster.

I've got a similar problem -- Gentoo has no problem sounding off but FC3 
is silent on the same box. Maybe if I bring Gentoo up, write down the 
mixer settings, then install them in FC3, the sound will work.

I have looked at what PC Solutions sells.  They are a damn good deal.
The will also sell laptops without an OS, so you can install Linux on
them. 

I would stick with them.

Trust your gut, you're going to find it hard to beat their price on a 
new laptop (they had an Acer for $700, can't remember the specs.)

I have a digital volt meter that takes A76 batteries. I have S76 batteries on

between alkaline and silver means anything to a dvm.

Any advice?

What the heck is a protocol 50 or 51?  I am right about this being

Those protocols are used by IPSec. File /etc/protocols describes
them as:

esp     50      ESP             # encapsulating security payload
ah      51      AH              # authentication header

Funny, I was just reading http://lartc.org/howto/lartc.ipsec.html
It's so the machine can handle IPSec tunnels.

Yes, that should be a port number.
My search says that port 50 is remote mail checking protocol and 
51 is IMP Logical Address Maintenance (reference below).

I don't know what they do though.

I did a quick Google search on:  A76 S76 battery life
gave website me this insight.
http://www.photoethnography.com/ClassicCameras/index-frameset.html?batteries.html~mainFrame 
A= alkaline S=silver oxide 
He says the alkaline doesn't last as long.  Lifetime is a big deal for cameras, and 
equipment that you depend on to work.

This cross reference is good too:  http://www.butkus.org/chinon/duracell_battery.htm 

This is type of info is helpful for HP calculator users. 
There are many similar sounding and lower priced batteries that don't have similar life.

Just to clarify, these are IP protcols, not TCP and UDP "port" numbers.  

Protocol 50 is Encapsulated Security Payload, which provides for both encryption
and authentication, AH just provides authentication.  Most folks only use ESP.

This is similar to OSPF being IP protocol 89, EIGRP 88 etc.

Max

Just to clarify, these are IP protcols, not TCP and UDP "port" numbers.  

Protocol 50 is Encapsulated Security Payload, which provides for both encryption
and authentication, AH just provides authentication.  Most folks only use ESP.

This is similar to OSPF being IP protocol 89, EIGRP 88 etc.

Damn!  I kept looking in services.  I guess I should spend some time

Thanks all.  Far too many things floating through the space between my 
ears.

So , loosely , -p and -m get a protocol and --dport gets a service.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0503141708330.21780-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I'm on a roll today.  Has anyone read or seen a review on the newer books 
about using netfilter -- iptables and friends?  Is see three this year 
along -- some new editions.

I'd like to do some logging, shaping, and hardening on individual systems
but the online stuff I've found deals with building firewalls or working
with dialup connections.  So I go -- willingly -- to either the
pay-per-view ( Safari Online ) or just plain buy it route ( no pun :-) if 
I can get something I can use.

Any pointers?


Best,

It's a big doc.  I've been studying it heavily lately, since I'm
building a 6-port, dual-uplink router with traffic classification
and shaping.

Here's an easy way to classify and limit bandwidth:

Current FTP transfer speeds seem to be around 8KBps.

Is it a managed switch that you can get port stats from?
At work I've seen this frequently when a client can't support the
full duplex.  We'll see sky high error counts on the port. 

Forcing the client to 100/half solves the problem and dramatically
increase throughput.

That's 64Kbps right? (1B=8b)  Remember, 100Mb is the theoretical speed 
for raw bits.  If you're measuring the size of transferred files vs 
time, you're not counting the TCP packet overhead, etc.

I usually test with wget, and have seen anywhere from 3-11 MB/s 
depending on the speed of the machine and quality of the network card.  
The tulip and eepro100 cards seem to perform better than some.

What's your machine spec and card setup?

Waow.  You've got a few things that could be causing it:
2 interrupt controllers, 2 IP stacks, 2 drivers, 2 NICs, 2 cables, 
2 switch ports, 1 switch backplane.

To me, that order of degradation while still maintaining a connection
implies something on the interrupt, driver or software side.
It'd be interesting to try each host from another machine, and/or
retest with one host or the other booted from a LiveCD.

Heck, maybe someone installed bandwidth-limiting as a gag. ;)

Yeah, lots of things to check.  A bit more info.  [robot is the server,

Doesn't appear to be errors... unless it's a single digit tally in mod 5.

Well, the server has a DEC Tulip card of some variety.  It's my former 
desktop machine and it had some similar difficulties on the network 
before.

Oddly, internet activity from both hosts is great.

Furthermore, robot is streaming video through the XBOX with no trouble and 
I just FTPd some stuff to the XBOX from person with decent speed.

I would say that is looking to be the most sensible thing, were it not 
totally non-sensical.

You can, of course, try forcing it to full too :) I've had recommendations
from admins of larger Ethernet networks to generally fix the speed and
duplexity servers and such, because (supposedly) the renegotiation incurs
some overhead, which you might notice doing backups or such.

'mii-tool' is the way to go if the driver supports it; if not, the
module itself will require options.

That's weird =========^^^
But by the TX/RX numbers it's moved a lot of bytes.

Dang.  Looks like you've got some testing ahead of you.

Looks like packets going from person to robot are getting corrupted
somehow. Not that that helps you diagnose it.

Always worth looking to see if you have iptables rules or traffic
control rules (man tc(8)) that might be interfering.

I've run into this before with Sun boxes and Cisco switches. The 
performance would be pretty bad if you had the switch set to 
autonegotiate, but it worked fine if you set it to full duplex. I think 
it is best in general to choose the settings you want instead of relying 
on the autonegotiation.

You seem to have a lot of receive errors on robot's eth0. Speed/duplex
mismatch between the switch and host, as mentioned previously, is the
likely culprit.

Autonegotiation only works if both ends are set to autonegotiate - if
you have one end forced to, for instance, 100MB/Full duplex, and the
other end set to autonegotiate, the end set to auto will drop to half
duplex and you will get errors.

Best to force both ends to match speed and duplex, but if you want
autonegotiation to work, then both ends need to be auto.

Sure it is, if the errors occured during the ftp process.  
I suspect that Jeme has a switch that does auto and he has no way
to reset it.  The auto-negotiation between the switch and robot
isn't working reliably and only is a problem under heavy net load, 
hence he can work fine over the Internet because the comparatively
slow Internet connection doesn't allow data transfer speeds to 
trigger the problem.  

Thus he needs to follow Wil's suggestion to use  mii-tool and
force the client to auto, then 100/full, then 100/half and test
the throughput under each scenario.

We, of course, did.  The chipset in Compaq Evo computers doesn't 
reliably support 100/Full.  Where "reliably" means some Evos connected
to Cisco switches will suffer severe performance degredation when
configured for 100/Full.

'splain, please. That's only 0.4 percent of packets, so unless each bad 
packet triggered a fairly *lengthy* re-negotiation process, I'm not 
seeing how it would drop a 100Mb/s to 8KB/s. Maybe 100Mb/s 
(theoretical) to 30 Mb/s (actual), but 64 Kb/s? Roughly five hundred 
times slower?

I do agree that this is a good test. However, I'm used to duplexing 
madness dropping a 100Mb down to 30 Mb/s speeds, but I've never seen 
duplexing issues drop a connection down to 8KB (64Kb) speed. To drop 
that low, I'd guess crappy cables, or *serious* interference, or 
something similar on the physical layer...

We don't know how long the interface has been up and what percentage of 
total the ftp traffic is.  Of the 8794083 packets received perhaps
1% of them were the ftp traffic that Jeme's describing, perhaps 50%.
We don't know.  Thus he needs to test.  OR he could grab the interface
statistics before and after an FTP transfer - we could then see how
the numbers have incremented. We might see something like the RX packets
growing by 1000 while the error count grew by several hundred.

You'll also note that he has frame errors.  Frame errors are when the
received packet has a bad CRC and/or non-integer number of octets. 
These are usually the result of collisions or bad Ethernet device.

I've seen it on workstations at work - less than T1 speeds on a 100mhz
LAN connection.  Setting the duplex on both ends of the connection, 
in our case to half, restored expected transfer rates.  Setting to full
did not.  I suspect this is due to the quality of the Ethernet chipset
used in the low cost desktop machines we have. But it hasn't been worth
spending the time to investigate.

Jeme's situation, and that of most home users, is a bit trickier because
he/they don't have managed switches.  The typical home Ethernet switch
is auto-sensing and the user has no way to set port parameters 
or view port statistics.

That could well be, that's for the person on site to evaluate.

Overnight, I left the FTP running and the errors tripled on the 
interface.

So I just restarted robot and included the "tulip full_duplex=1" in 
/etc/modules (though there was no tulip line there even though the module 
is listed in lsmod).

Everything seemed fine.  Counters reset.  No errors.

Fired up FTP... no errors.  Started a file transfer.  Woah!  Several 
errors a second.  Killed ftp client.

Fired up a flick on the XBox.  No errors.  Nothing but smooth transfers.

I really WANT to blame my crappy switch (so I can justify buying a new 
one), but I'm not seeing ANY errors on my new desktop machine or transfers 
between other hosts.

Let me run an ftp TO the XBox from person.

Dig this.  400KBps.  No way to check interface errors on the XBox, but my 
guess is that we will find few to none with a transfer rate like that. 
(Still slow, though... the switch lights green or orange depending on 
whether the interface is 10 or 100Mb and the XBox is orange.  I replaced 
my last internal green-lit card last week.)

And managed switches are really expensive.

I'm more inclined to think it's the switch or the NIC than the cables, but 
only because I would think the cables would munge data regardless of 
transfer speed.

Still kind of stumped, though.  I'll do more this afternoon... I've got 
finals today.

Hmmm... Have you used ethereal yet to get a packet level view of what's
happening on the network from the perspectives of the two hosts?

1) 100 Half will in many cases provide worse performance than 10 Half.  Speed
and duplex are definately the first thing you want to correct, if possible.  The
most common way to correct this is to set the duplex negotiation to auto on both
the switch and client.

2) Have we tried to benchmark throughput using another application, like HTTP?
Bittorent, NFS? 

3) Ethereal is your friend.  take a capture and run it through Shane Ostermann's
tcptrace application.  It will breakdown the TCP level dynamics, showing packet
loss and retransmissions, etc.

HTH.

Max

A couple of years ago, I had an ethernet switch/hub (built into a IDSL 
router) fail
in a peculiar manner.  Small frames worked just fine.  I could 
ping/traceroute all
day long without error ... until I started to increment the packet 
size.  POP3 users
accessing small messages didn't even notice a problem ... those who had mail
messages over a few K (esp. those w/ multi-meg PDF, etc.), or were trying to
use an FTP server on the same segment were completely shutdown.

First, make sure you have a quick test which reliably reproduces the 
problem.
(And it sounds like your FTP test is working well.)

Then, the quickest (and cheapest), thing to try is to use a different 
port on the
switch.  (For that matter, what happens if the "robot" and "person" 
ports are
swapped?)  You may just have a bad port, and I've seen more than a few
engineering/lab nets with red tape covering blown ports....

Second, swap out the cable ...  again, fast, cheap.

Next, you get to decide if you want to swap out (a) the switch, or (b) 
the NIC.
....

I have seen some problems on hubs and switches that one port will start
going wacky but every other port will be fine.  I have even seen a port that
will still get a link but has been segmented out of the switch or hub which 
will not allow any communication.

I've switched ports with no apparent change.  I have two switches uplinked 
together and this host has the same behavior on either one.

Don't discount one of the ethernet cables being flakey either.

Since my speaker dropped again, I will be speaking on Redhat Package

Portland Linux/Unix Group Advanced Topics

Speaker:            Alan Olsen
                    
Subject:            Redhat Package Manager - How to roll your own packages

Date:               March 16th 2005
Time:               7:00pm - 9:00pm

Location:           Jax 826 SW 2nd Ave
                    Portland, OR

The talk will be on how to create RPMs for Linux systems and any other
OSes that use the Redhat Package Manager. (Redhat, Fedora, SuSE,
Mandrake, etc.)  The talk will include how to create a spec file,
determine dependencies, and make everything work without pulling out too
much of your hair.

We will not be getting into why RPM is better than Debian's package
manager, though some aspects of package are fairly universal. (APT and
YUM will get some mention, but they are not package managers so much as
installers.)

Usual meeting rules apply. Happy Hour meal prices for the first hour. 

Void where prohibited by natural law.

If all you want to check is that your wires are straigh or crossed as
they should be, and you aren't concerned with the internal
capabilities of the strands so much you can use any hub with a uplink
port and lights.

Plug one end into the uplink and the other into a standard port, if
the lights turn on you've at least got connectivity.  Use both
standard ports for crossovers.

Obviously this isn't good enough for any serious validation of your
cables, but I'm not sure how complex you want to go.

Oddly, I can't find a decent cable with which to test, but I did mentally 
discount cable issues because lower speed transfer rates work great.  The 
errors only happen when you try to use the whole pipe (I think).

You would think that a bad cable would give you consistent errors at every 
speed (since the same amount of electricity moves down the wire at the 
same speed, regardless of data transfered).

I could give a talk on the Rijndael symmetric block cipher used in AES.

It would all be algebra and almost no computer science.

In fact, nobody would be interested but me.

I played around with mii-tool for quite a bit and found that the responses 
were... inconsistent.  It wouldn't, for example, be forced into any mode 
at all and whenever I narrowed the advertised media, it negotiated 
10/half (at which time the light on the switch turned from amber meaning 
100 to green meaning 10).  Under certain conditions, the card would just 
say "unable to negotiate" and then I'd have no link at all.

$15 later, I have a new nic and ftp transfers are in a more acceptable 
13MiB range.

Bad NIC bad, new NIC good.

Partly right, partly wrong.  The round-trip time for a cable is about
five nanoseconds per foot, so a 20 foot CAT5 with 100Mb/s data on it
(and half the edges making clocks) will have about 20 electrical 
transitions on it during a packet transfer.  All those transitions
can interfere with each other, and poorly made cables have a lot more
interference.  At 10Mb/s signalling rates, there are a lot fewer
transitions to interfere and the system is a lot more tolerant of
bad cables.

A network has some error correcting capability, but it takes time
to do this.  So a bad cable throwing a lot of physical-layer errors
may overrun the capability of the low-level drivers to deal with
them.  

Besides the cables, switches may have limited packet buffering
capability, so high packet rates may swamp them.  I can imagine
a cheap 100BT switch running out of processing power when hit with
the data rates that a Linux machine (as opposed to a windoze machine)
can produce.

If you are seeing packet errors, it might be worthwhile to log them
with tcpdump (to a big ramdisk) and see what their nature is.  But I
would not discount swapping cables and switches to see if they make
the problem go away.  My wife the doctor often learns which of five
diseases causes a set of symptoms by seeing which meds cure them.

Freegeek probably has a bin of cheap CAT5 cables, or Wacky Willies
might.  Inexpensive NEW cables can be found at www.pchcables.com of 
Hillsboro .

I have seen this happen with both bad cards and bad switches.  It is a
pain to debug. It helps if you have more than one device to test with.

Message-ID: <20050316234857.35632.qmail@web52705.mail.yahoo.com>

I'm writing a C program that reads from files.  What's the easiest way
to figure out whether a name is the name of a file (as opposed to a
directory, etc.)?

Under Linux, fopen() fails if you give it a directory name, but this
doesn't work under SunOS.

I noticed that open(name, O_RDWR) reports an error if you give it a
non-file.  It also reports an error if the user doesn't have write
permission.  Since I don't really need write permission, I can check
errno and call open again with O_RDONLY if it's a permission problem,
but this seems incredibly kludgy.

Use the stat() function on the name and use the POSIX macro S_ISDIR(m)
on the mode returned by stat().

there really isn't a Linux equivalent to Visio.  Argo, last I looked,

And yet, the Windon't machine I use for this purpose has been

happened, my Visio document was corrupted, so that Visio wouldn't open
it (even denied that it was a Visio file!).  So both times, my work was
lost permanently.  This is unacceptable.

I wanted to ask you all, once more, if there are ANY good UML tools for
Linux--anything better than Argo, just to raise a standard.  But now I'm
ready to bust my knuckles on this POS WinXP tower, and I would consider
almost any alternative, so long as it's Linux based.

Have you UML lovers any creative ideas, tools and techniques, that might
help me break my Visio addiction?  I've come to depend on UML diagrams
for design; and I'm almost ready to consider pencil and paper, but not
quite.  :]

Jason,

   Have you looked at Poseidon or the UML plug-in to Eclipse? I started using
the former but I like the latter better. There's also EMF, the Eclipse
Modeling Framework, that lets you create your model in XML, with UML diagrams
or in code. It will then create the other forms for you.

   Eclipse, in its own way, is the GUI equivalent of emacs: it does
everything, including the dishes and waking you up in the morning.

HTH,

Rich

Installing poseidonCE now.  I'm pretty shy of Eclipse, because of its
youth, for one thing, and in this case because I'd prefer a UML tool
independent of my choice of IDE.

However, I do like the idea of building UML in XML.

Someone already mentioned Poseidon, which IIRC is written in Java. 
Technically it's non-free as a result. However, it does have something 
many other tools don't -- an interface to a performance modelling tool 
called PEPA, also written in Java. Do a web search for PEPA; it's from 
Edinburgh IIRC.

There is also Kivio. The basic tool is free, but I believe added 
templates cost money. I've never used Kivio. And ... there's Dia. Dia is 
Gnu free as in freedom, reasonable robust for something with a 0.9x 
version number, and has add-on software "dia2code" for generating code 
from UML. I've never used this part of it, so I can't testify to its 
usability.

Just in case you're interested in database modeling, Dia also has an 
add-on that does that, though I've forgotten what it's called. And there 
is DBDesigner4 -- another package written in Java. I've found that most 
large-scale Java-based packages run reliably only with the Sun JRE, so 
be careful.

I remember this tool now.  ArgoUML with pretty widgets, basically.  It
has a free version, actually, but for noncommercial use.  This actually
looks like a good product for what it does.

> templates cost money. I've never used Kivio. And ... there's Dia. Dia

Dia's not bad either, I was running that today.  I'm not into the
Gimp-like interface, so I'm thinking ArgoUML is better for me.  I'm
looking into Kivio.

As a matter of fact, this is just my craving.  I really wanted to see
this functionality in Poseidon, but I don't see it there.  (Strange, it
sports "SQL DDL Code Generation" but doesn't seem to have any DB
modeling interface.  I do a lot of modeling, both objects and tables, so
I'll definitely seek out that add-on.  Thanks.

FYI, from the FAQ:

"SVG is a useful format for creating diagrams, though, so we hope as
Inkscape grows as a fully-featured SVG editor, it will also be useful
for making attractive diagrams too. Several of us hope Inkscape will
become a useful technical drawing tool and work on features with that
goal in mind. However, Dia provides a number of useful capabilities such
as support for UML, autogeneration of diagrams, etc. that are well
beyond the scope of a general SVG editor."

My personal favorite... although commercial is Together. It's a fantastic
tool (Owned now by Borland :( ) and very comparable to Rational's tool.

I think I'm going to lose it, here, fellows.  Visio is the one reason I
still rely on Windoesn't for developing software.  UML diagrams are
good, and I wouldn't want to design an application without them; but
there really isn't a Linux equivalent to Visio.  Argo, last I looked,
just doesn't hold a candle.

And yet, the Windon't machine I use for this purpose has been
spontaneously rebooting--a lot.  And the last couple of times this
happened, my Visio document was corrupted, so that Visio wouldn't open
it (even denied that it was a Visio file!).  So both times, my work was
lost permanently.  This is unacceptable.

I wanted to ask you all, once more, if there are ANY good UML tools for
Linux--anything better than Argo, just to raise a standard.  But now I'm
ready to bust my knuckles on this POS WinXP tower, and I would consider
almost any alternative, so long as it's Linux based.

Have you UML lovers any creative ideas, tools and techniques, that might
help me break my Visio addiction?  I've come to depend on UML diagrams
for design; and I'm almost ready to consider pencil and paper, but not
quite.  :]

Hmm, I don't find an add-on for dia that provides a database modeling
stencil, as it were.  Database tools written for dia seem to require an
overloading of the UML class and association shapes, which really aren't
appropriate, IMO, for that type of modeling.

For that matter, though, poseidon seems to offer the richest set of UML
tools I've seen so far.  Nice interface, too.

I think that's in "tedia2sql". By the way, "dbdesigner" and "tedia2sql" 
are masked in Gentoo. You need to add

app-office/tedia2sql
dev-db/dbdesigner

to /etc/portage/package.keywords

to get them to emerge.

What little I've done with DBDesigner 4 was quite impressive. Being in 
Java, it will run on Windows, Linux and Solaris. It works well with 
MySQL, ODBC, Microsoft SQL Server and Postgresql IIRC.

   I've used the "clay" plugin to Eclipse for database modeling. Does a great
job for creating postgres schema.

Are you loading the ide-scsi module after bootup?

Though really, IDE-SCSI is basically broken in 2.6.

You can simply tell CDRecord that the device is e.g. /dev/hdd and it
should work.  Remove the IDE-SCSI entries from Grub before you do
that, though.

Good luck,
  Aaron

There've been some excellent suggestions, but have you considered
using Crossover Office to run your familiar ol' Visio on Linux?  Mind,
it only runs Visio 2000 and costs $40 (you can download an eval for
free, I think) but it seems like the "easy" option if you've got a
project to finish.

Ooh, bad hardware.  Maybe your CPU or power-supply fan's stopped.

You no longer need ide-scsi emulation.  You just use /dev/hdd; check the
Fedora FAQs or forum.

Turning off spontaneous rebooting would help diagnose this.  I think the

tedia2sql will "Convert database ERD designed in Dia into SQL DDL
scripts."  So it's yet another dia-document-to-some-other-system
converter.  Apparently it works from "ER" diagrams, which is one set of
shapes that comes with dia.  This I don't understand, for there are only
five simple shapes under the "ER" option, none of which could begin to
describe a database table.  So it eludes me what sort of DDL might be
generated from such a simple form.

Again, it seems as though dia can only model database tables as UML
classes.

Hi,

I could really use some help configuring my gentoo laptop to access our
printer at work.  Off-list would be fine.

No one at my workplace really understands network printing, and I don't
even know if we're using an actual print server.  The printer is an HP
4050N, and it's connected to the LAN (speaks TCP/IP).  So I have a model
number and an IP, and that's about all.

I tried the foomatic-configure script, but it barfed at line 1895 of
"DB.pm" for use of an uninitialized value.  Seems foomatic is still
buggy, and printing in Linux is still pretty much hit or miss.  I wish
someone in the know would describe cups, lpr, et al in terms of the
INTERFACES involved, the rules of the game, because everything I've read
is procedural and specific to different environments, and so it's
usually outdated or otherwise useless.

Anyway, I have cupsd running in Gentoo, and I think I need a "raw"
interface to the printer's IP address.  Any guidance on this doing this
without foomatic, please?

Uhm, in Gentoo, at least.  CUPS and Foomatic have both been pretty
well-behaved for me for the past few years on various Deb and RPM
distros.  You might see if you can emerge a different version and see
if it works better.

Actually, with HPs and other network printers, I've found that "raw"
(TCP socket, port 9100) mode tends to cause problems with jobs dying
halfway through or colliding with other jobs.  But every net print
device I've seen supports plain ol' LPR mode, printer=lp.  That works
nicely, with no job collisions or timeouts.

Sorry, can't remember how to set it up manually off the top of my
head, but if you have CUPS' web interface, you might try configuring
the printer via http://localhost:631 or just hand-edit
/etc/printers.conf (or whatever it's called.)

I have guessed out my solution.  The foomatic script having crapped out,
I tried connecting to the cups HTTP interface and got a login dialog,
which is not documented, AFAICT.  After trying several logins, I typed
in "root" and my system root password, and that did it.  Evidently, most
people open their Web browsers as root when doing this and do not
encounter the prompt.

So once I got into the configuration, I had to guess the DeviceURI,
since I had no idea what that was supposed to be.  I got lucky with
"socket://192.168.1.119:9100".  Where the hell is that URL documented,
please?  I can't even find a description of the different network
protocols that are used for printing, much less how to know which to use
for a particular printer.

After all, I'll say this:  printing with Linux is really easy--like so
many other things--provided you know exactly what you're doing! 
Personally, I've tackled it several times and remain, on the whole,
virtually clueless.

   I switched my HP LaserJet 5 and HP Professional Series 2500C from direct
connections to JetDirect cards. Made the changes in /etc/cups/printers.conf
and they've worked flawlessly ever since. Of course, it ain't a heavy load

Jason,

   I use either /usr/sbin/printers or the web UI. With the latter, I open the
page after su'ing to root and it asks for root's password. Works just like
you discovered. The URI is documented in the system administrator's manual
that CUPS provides.

Subject: [PLUG] want Wifi AP selection software
Message-ID: <20050318054307.GA15279@gate.kl-ic.com>


I am currently running hostap and a prism2 wifi card.  I use it
in many different situations (WEP/open, static/dhcp) and with
many different sites, and often in places where there is more 
than one ESSID available.  I deal with this for now by using
scripts (run as root) that copy the appropriate config file on
top of /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-wlan0 .  There has
got to be an easier way - say an X popup + scroll and select 
interface that lets me choose among the available known and 
new APs that are available.  I understand windoze and mac do
something like this, and imagine the there is a similar Linux
offering somewhere.

Any suggestions?

You are not alone in your pain. Eric Raymond wrote quite a rant about CUPS 
configuration and documentation last year 
(http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cups-horror.html).

Personally, I've found CUPS to be far more complex than lpr, for no 
discernably better result.  At least on our simple home network.

I was also going to suggest dia.  I have not used it for UML.
Just generalized block diagrams.  Earlier versions have crashed
on me, but I've never gotten a corrupted file.  And in any case,
the file is in XML, so you can edit it.  I've done that quite
a bit when I wanted to do a global edit that dia wanted me to
do the slow way.

I have a map of my house that I did with dia.  It shows all
the outlets and lights and indicates which breaker goes with
each.  I can tell it to hide that layer and instead show
the dimensions of the rooms.  There is quite a bit of info
in the file.  Chances are dia will do what you need.

Some distributions of Linux come with dia pre-installed.  Debian
has a .deb package.  I see there is a UML tutorial near the
top of this page.  http://www.gnome.org/projects/dia/links.html
That same page mentions that dia was inspired by visio, so you
may find the transition not too painful.

How do I resolve this issue? K3b won't do it.
Thanks

cdrecord does not run with root privileges
It is highly recommended to configure cdrecord to run with root
privileges. Only then cdrecord runs with high priority which increases
the overall stability of the burning process. Apart from that it allows
changing the size of the used burning buffer. A lot of user problems
could be solved this way. This is also true when using SuSE's resmgr.
Solution: Use K3bSetup to solve this problem.
cdrdao does not run with root privileges
It is highly recommended to configure cdrdao to run with root privileges
to increase the overall stability of the burning process.
Solution: Use K3bSetup to solve this problem.

My workaround was to:
1) install sudo
2) run visudo as root and add a line:

<username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/cdrecord, /usr/bin/cdrdao

3) put wrapper scripts in /usr/local/bin for cdrecord and cdrdao:

#!/sbin/sh
sudo /usr/bin/cdrecord "$@"

4) make sure they are executable
5) run "search" in k3b and tell it to use the programs in /usr/local/bin

Voila! it should work.

Also note that as long as k3b doesn't try and make cdrecord setuid root,
it (cdrecord) should run fine as an ordinary user if you have rw access
to the burner device, but will have a higher likelihood of buffer
underruns.

Yeah, the problems I saw were when several computers were configured
to print directly to the printer; socket mode doesn't do any sort of
locking or job management that I can see.

Aaron,

   I've probably missed something in my understanding of CUPS, but jobs here
still go through the print spool on the server. That's where the job
management occurs. Sometimes -- particularly in the evening or when the
ctrl-p chord is struck in error -- the jobs are queued because the printer is
turned off. When I next fire it up out they come.

Would someone check to see if they can do a dig, whois, or tracroute to 
www.usps.gov?  I've tried from two different networks here in the 
Spokane/North Idaho area and see a jam somewhere around St. Paul, MN.

We're having problems getting email through ( person claims for last two
days ).  Web ( www.usps.gov ) seems to work OK from a browser but digs,
pings, and tracetoute get differing results.  Seems it might be more a DNS
issue on their -- USPS -- part.

It certainly looks broken to me, too.  DNS from both networks,
including via a DNS that I control, give the IP 56.0.134.23 for
www.usps.gov.

That's interesting.  I talked to our CTO, and he says we've had no such
problems and that our several Windon't machines all connect using the
socket interface.  I wonder if WinXP really uses ipp:, which our HP also
supports.  At any rate, I've switched to ipp: for my laptop, and so far,
so good.

Steve, Rich;

I got the same stop point on one of my tries. But I even did better and
got a nearer one one time.

   Could it be the Canadians have invaded because of all the bad jokes
from "The Prairie Home Companion?"  :-)

Thanks for checking.  It's tough to explain this to people that think the 
"Internet" is broken when they don't get e-mail they think they're 
suppose to get.

OK, weird one:  I'm building library RPMs from source tarballs, and in

Anyone know?

Note that traceroute relies on ICMP packets being forwarded.  These
days, they are sometimes dropped at particular routers, which causes a
standard ping or traceroute to give confusing results.  More reliable
is something like tcptraceroute where the destination port is a real
open port.  E.g.:

They're filtering traffic at usps1-gw.customer.alter.net (65.206.183.82).
Connecting to port 80 of www.usps.gov clearly works, so packets are
definitely getting through; however, as you've noticed both ping and
traceroute fail beyond that. I notice that connecting to the SMTP ports
on their mailservers also works.

There is nothing you can do besides tell them it doesn't appear to be on
your end (your e-mail makes it to this mailing list), and you cannot do
any further diagnosis.

The .a files should go in the -devel package. The .la files should go
in the library's main binary package.

The .a files are static libraries, used (optionally) only when building
applications.

The .la files are used by the libtool utility. They're basically an
abstraction layer on top of shared libraries intended to hide some
platform-specific dependencies.

Well, there may be more that you can do than that :)

Are we talking about incoming mail to your server, outgoing, or both?

If it's outgoing, check your queue for the messages, and your mail log. 
Try to telnet to port 25 of their mail server and see what happens. You 
should be able to connect to their server and even type an email if you 
speak SMTP :) If you can't connect, then the error should give you a 
clue as to what's happening. If it's something like a spam blacklist 
involved, that may even show up in your maillog.

If it's incoming, mail only, then that's harder to troubleshoot on your 
end, their admin would need to check on their mail server.

prefer's ATT and one prefer's MCI (Both are usps's peers).  I can clearly see
there is an issue with the route to server e That network is showing origin
incomplete for some entries in BGP which may have caused the original problem
(Someone probably accidentally redistributed their IGP into BGP. Whoops.), but I
can still hit port 25 on both boxes from here.

SMTP is open from here on both "servers" (Could be mail farms behind a
loadbalancer.), I'm also not noticing any flapping with dig when I specifically
look for the mx record. Ping doesn't work, so they're filtering ICMP echo or
echo reply.   sure you aren't being blacklisted/ filtered / or having a DNS
problem on your end?  Nothing funny in the logs?

I don't even keep .la files any more. I delete them from the DESTDIR

Carefull on those *.so files. If there are no *.so.* files then the
*.so files need to go in the main package, or if the *.so.* files are
symbolic links to the *.so files, then again the *.so files need to
go in to the main package.

Or to simplify: Put the *.so files in the main package _unless_ there
are specific provisions that make that unnecessary. One such provision
is non-symlink *.so.* files.

The .la files should definitely be in devel. If you ever develop or
build GTK/Glib programs you'll need them. Debian generally places the *.a
files into -dbg (debug) packages.

The *.so.* files should NEVER be links to the *.so files. Conventional
setup is <lib>.so -> <lib>.so.<major> -> <lib>.so.<fullversion>, where
<lib>.so.<fullversion> is the actual library.

This is not a provision, this is STANDARD practice! I haven't fully
explored the issue, but I believe using gcc as a front end to ld will
always unwind one level of symbolic links. I'm unsure whether it checks
for a filename of the form *.so.[0-9], but if you look at what ldd tells
you output always links to <lib>.so.[0-9].

Binaries compiled with gcc and GNU ld never look for libfoo.so; they 
always look for libfoo.so.X. That's why the *.so files can be packaged 
with the -devel stuff. If you need the *.so symlinks, it's only at 
compile time, never at run time.

I don't know where you get that. If you say:

   gcc somefile.c -lsomelib

then ld is going to look for libsomelib.so. If it finds it then
that's the reference that will go in the binary even if libsomelib.so
is a symbolic link to libsomelib.so.X (which it often is). With -l it
will never look for libsomelib.so.X. If it can't find libsomelib.so
then it goes on to look for libsomelib.a.

If you really want the reference to libsomelib.so.X to end up in
the application's binary then you can't use the -l switch. You have
to say something like:

   gcc somefile.c /path/to/libsomelib.so.X

which I've no doubt is very common in make files or the ./configure
scripts that generate make files. But it's not something gcc or ld
do automatically.

Without trying to sound like I know what's *supposed* to happen, 
that's not the way it works on my box (CentOS 4.0, gcc 3.4.3, glibc 
2.3.4). If I do a general -lz, it appears to me that the linker 
unravels the symlinks. Or is this a bad test?

[tmp]$ cat t.c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() { printf( "Hello, world!\n" ); return 0; }

I recently rebooted my White Box Linux system and it failed to complete the
boot because of a "dirty" root file system.

I then booted into a Knoppix Linux and ran fsck on all drives which checked
out clean.

Booting back to WB Linux, I get the same message about unclean shutdown and
type "Y" for cleanup of the root file system.  I had to do the reboot and
cleanup three times to get things to come up clean.

So...

Question One:  Why did not the Knoppix fsck fix things or even detect a
problem?

Question Two:  Why the need for multiple reboots and fscks across the root
file system?

Curious. I get that with libz also (FC3). But if I build my own .so
library then gcc behaves in the way I described. In fact I can mix
libz and my shared library in a single app and get the two different
types of references in the app's binary.

The possibility that it's following the symlinks doesn't make sense.
My libz symlinks are:

  /usr/lib/libz.so -> libz.so.1.2.1.2
  /usr/lib/libz.so.1 -> libz.so.1.2.1.2

The -lz switch would take you to libz.so. From there gcc could
easily hop to libz.so.1.2.1.2, but getting from there back to
libz.so.1 would be very weird and very inefficient. But somehow
that's what ends up in the app binary.

There's some magic going on under the hood I think.

What do you mean when you say "ran a fsck from knoppix"?  Did you run an
"e2fsck" without the -f option, or did you run an actual "fsck"?  You
say the checked out clean.  Was this right away when running the fsck
command, or after a lengthy disk check?  e2fsck without a -f will often
not even bother to run a disk check.

I like to run "e2fsck -fptv" (sometimes with the -c option to run
badblocks).  If that doesn't succeed, I then run "fsck -C".  That has
always worked for me.  I also use knoppix for this procedure.

e2fsck is a wrapper around fsck.ext3.  I'm thinking it's kinda pointless to
run e2fsck.  Maybe use fsck directly instead.

What do you bet it's the "-soname" option passed to the linker when 
building the library? From the ld(1) man page:

   When an executable is linked with a shared object which has a
   DT_SONAME field, then when the executable is run the dynamic linker
   will attempt to load the shared object specified by the DT_SONAME
   field rather than the using the file name given to the linker.

I am having trouble setting up name based virtual hosting. I have included 
the VirtualHost section of the httpd.conf file at the end of this eamil.

I have a set of files in var/www/html which serve OK when I enter 
209.210.229.130 in a web browser. This is as it was before I tried to add 
virtual hosting. A second web site located at /var/www/wschopp/html behaves 
as follows:

Enter www.schoppformetro.com into a browser and you get the Fedora Core 
Test Page (I presume that this means it works)

Enter http://www.schoppformetro.com/index.html into a browser and you get :
Forbidden, You don't have permission to access /index.html on this 
server,Additionally, a 403 Forbidden error was encountered while trying to 
use an ErrorDocument to handle the request. (I take that this is a 
permissions problem, but I think the permissions are set the same as for 
the files that work from var/www/html. All of these files were created on 
Windows and moved to the Linux box with a pen drive.)

Before I started mucking around with the config file, entering 
www.schoppformetro.com into a browser would get the index.htm from 
/var/www/html. Of course I want to serve up files from wschopp/html 
wherever it must be put.

(mclp.org does not point to this IP address yet)

Once this problem is solved, I hope to add 3-5 more virtual hosts.

Any suggestions?

Thanks
JK

Bingo. If I build my shared library with the -soname option and then
link my app to that library, the name given by -soname is what ends
up in the app's binary, not the actual name of the library file.

Now back to the original RPM question, the answer is the infamous
"it depends."

1) If the library is built without the -soname option, then the .so
file must go in to the library's main binary package, not the -devel
package.

2) If it is built using -soname, then a file or symlink matching the
name given by -soname must go in the main binary package. The
original .so file may go in to the -devel package instead of the main
package.

3) If you're not sure how the library was built then follow #1.

Following up on myself...

I figured there had to be a easy way to determine if -soname was
used to build the library, and there is.

   objdump -p /path/to/binary-lib-file.so | grep SONAME

You'll get nothing if -soname was not used or the SONAME value
if -soname was used. With this you can figure out what needs to
go in the main RPM and what can go in the -devel RPM instead.

True, but the number of libraries that don't set SONAME could likely be
counted by a stupid person who was missing one arm and without taking off
either sock. You've got a 99% chance it is set with any random library
you run across. I strongly suspect Debian's packaging guidelines may well
require this (at least ones from them consistantly confine the .so link
to -dev packages).

Another simple test would be to simply do a "Hello, world" program and
link it to the library and see what `ldd` prints out.

(Because it checks the clean flag on the filesystem, and unless there is
a panic or other unclean shutdown that does tend to get reset.)

Other way around. `fsck` is a pretty simple wrapper for `fsck.<fs>`
(where <fs> is "ext2", "ext3" or whatever). `fsck.ext2` and `fsck.ext3`
are generally symbolic links to `e2fsck`. The fun part is unless the FS
is actively marked as dirty (kernel checks found inconsistancies) or it
has exceeded the mount count, `fsck.ext3` is a no-op as it lets the
kernel do journal playback.

Checking on my system, for all .so libraries in /lib and /usr/lib that are
in a format that objdump can understand, all have an SONAME. But I found
that you can not then assume that the SONAME is always libsomething.so.X.
In several cases it was just libsomething.so, and in one case it was
libsomething.so.X.Y. So it still pays to check.

How do I force Google to search for literal punctuation?

It seems like every time I enter punctuation, it will
just use that as a wildcard, even if I enter it as a literal
phrase.

For example, COM-NW shows

com/nw
com.nw

and a whole slew of other stuff.

Thanks,

My understanding is that @LOCAL means the LAN, but it's easy enough to

This line bothers me. If I had written this block I would have a line:
Allow From @LOCAL.  I'm unsure where to add it. I used system-config-
printer.  Maybe that causes the printer clauses to be added.

   I invoked cpan to find and install perl/tk, but it failed. After trying
lynx, ncftp, and wget on a half-dozen or so sites, cpan gave up and retired.
I can access at least one of the sites manually using ncftp.

   Not being fluent in perl, I would appreciate some pointers on how to get a

Rich,

perl -MCPAN -e shell

gives you the install shell

cpan>install Tk

Then will go out and get the Tk module.

afterwards you can either install another module or 

cpan>quit

Currently the install is still going.  It's either quit or exit.

I had to eventually use force.  I now, it's not nice, but. . .

cpan> force install Tk

3 tests failed.  Minor ones, but it did not want to install without
force.  I also ran perl as root.

Not if you want to browse and print over the network.   'Listen *:631'

OK, I'm having trouble with evil spirits or ghosts or something.

First, I'm happily wasting time on the Internet worrying about things
that I can do absolutely nothing about,  when I get a hard freeze.  I
mean I'm sitting there looking at Firefox with a text cursor in the
middle of the page and the mouse will not move. Nada, keyboard. I mean
Control-Alt-Backspace, NOTHING.

So I press the power button for the mandatory eight count, after which I
reboot, check the file system which seems to proceed OK, only instead of
proceeding to boot, it backs up and goes to the GRUB splash screen
wherein I select the default kernel and try again.  I elect to check the
file system again and this time it goes to boot. Relief!

Boy am I relieved because when all this other stuff was happening, I was
thinking disk crash, board crash, memory crash. And OK, next time
nothing but real Intel boards, no more no name boards from across the
seas.

So, the Gnome desktop comes up, evolution is open, hoo boy I survived.
But wait, something is different on the desktop, it's not there.  The
default Fedora background is not there, neither are any folders or other
icons, the trashcan etc.  I right click on the desktop, _nothing_.
Argh! So, I open up the main menu, select system tools::system-logs,
give my password, and NOTHING, no response.  This can't be happening, I
do it again, and up pops the window. I look at the boot log, nothing
that means anything to me.  While looking at the kernel log, all the
icons suddenly appear on my desktop. Hnnh?

How is this possible?  Was I  in some sort of time loop? What?

   Aha! Here's where I went off the tracks. I used "install perl/tk".

   I'll give this a try.

Ken,

   Amazing! When I correctly specify the module, it works. No need to force it
here. Now to see about getting sixpack up and running ...

Unless you've got local users who use IRC regularly, yeah, I'd be 
worried. If you've got root on the box, you can try to figure out what 
they're up to using tcpdump or ethereal.

Doh! Yes, be worried.

"ngrep port 6667" should show you the text of what's being said on those 
ports. Its much easier to read.. you'll probably need to install it first 
though.

lsof will show you what process has that socket open.. good luck.

Well, it's either legit IRC traffic, or possibly something much worse (Trojan
horse/IRCbot...)  If it's a windows machine, chances are you will be dealing
with the latter scenario.

Any respectable packet sniffer will provide more insight... If possible,  I
would track  down the user of that machine and ask if they use IRC.

Regards,
Max

Josh,

   Groan! But, I guess that I asked for this reaction.

   Some of you -- particularly students and others who write in LaTeX/LyX
might appreciate this bibliographic reference manager. It maintains a bibtex
database (searchable), will download from on-line reference databases, and
will integrate with LyX/LaTeX. Has both cli and gui modes.

   I tried getting a java tool working but failed (the system couldn't find
java on my box -- and it's there). Really wanted to use pybibliographer but
that's a gnome application that wants much more than the core libraries. I
got tired of chasing gnome dependencies and gave up.

   The best way of getting sixpack is from sourceforge (also get bp so you can
translate different reference database formats). I grabbed the rpms, ran them
through rpm2tgz, then used Slackware's installpkg to install them. Worked
like a charm.

Rich,

Be careful installing sixpack with perl?  Living in the Northwest you
will need to specify 'BridgePort', 'Rouge','FishBrewing', or your
favorite here as if you install just 'sixpack' you are likely to get
just Budweiser and I'd guess that is not what you really want.  :-)

Hello there PLUG friends,

   I just joined this list in the last couple of weeks  and joined today from my work so I could get some help.

   I was at the clinic on Saturday and got a bunch of great help, thank you to those who helped me out.

   Then I got home and was all charged up about playing with my machine and getting it updated.  I use Debian Sarge.  I did an update using the GUI in Gnome, and when I tried to upgrade, or smart upgrade many files were not found from the OSU site.  So, armed with my new knowledge of how to get around in the Shell and make changes to stuff, I changed my apt source  and got all the upgrades I guess I needed.  During the install portion of my adventure, I saw the text I remember dreading in the past.  That segment of stuff asking about my monitor and video card.  Now, if you ask my Windoze buddies, they think I am a master at installing Linux because in the last few years I have installed and used several versions, getting a little better with each install.   But the truth is, I am sort of a novice at this.  I just don't want to have to re-install Linux to get my video working again, because I KNOW I DON'T HAVE TOO!!!.  But that is the way I have done it in the past.  

Gawd this is wordy,

I have an nVidia Geforce card, and a flat panel monitor.  It seems to me, in the past I did not refer to it as an LCD during the little set up wizard and it worked fine.  This UPGRADE kind of caught me off guard and I said yes to the question that asked if I was using an LCD.  I would like to know how to go undo this portion of that wizard, or what file I have to edit.  I have tried and plan on trying xf86config when I get home tonight.  I have even removed the NV card and plugged straight into the onboard video (MSI MB, Athon XP) and plan on trying a few configs this way.  Oh, and of course I am only in text mode now, Shelling, which is not my strong suit, but I am not afraid of it.

Be afraid. Be very afraid.

If you or one of your users using IRC, you may have been hacked.

The last few hacked systems I have seen had IRC reflectors installed on
them.

chkrootkit and other rootkit detectors are your friend.  Using netcat to
observe the traffic is also helpful.

Here is what the addresses translate to:

[alan at dagon ~]$ host 193.110.95.1
1.95.110.193.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer
carouge.ch.eu.undernet.org.
[alan at dagon ~]$ host 66.197.0.145
145.0.197.66.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer rhodium.4ph.com.

Looks like a reflector to me.

Mike,

   The file you want is /etc/X11/xf86config (or /etc/X11/xorg.conf). Go look
in the Monitor section. Both of my desktop systems run xorg-6.8.1 and in
/etc/X11/xorg.conf I have:

# Monitor section
Section "Monitor"

     Identifier  "Hyundai LCD"
     HorizSync   31-80
     VertRefresh 56-75

EndSection

  Then there's:

Section "Device"
     Identifier "ATI Rage 128 Pro Ultra"
     Driver     "r128"
EndSection

   My other desktop has an nVidia:

Section "Device"
     Identifier  "nVidia GeForce2 MX/400"
     Driver      "nv"
     #VideoRam    32768
EndSection

   This works for me.

HTH,

Rich

I'm sure I do but my Perl/Tk book is at home.  If I can remember for the 
next two hours I'll dig it out tonight and let you know.  A quick search 
on the web turned up zilch.  Must be "in-the-book".

So, if that is the case and I block all IRC traffic at the firewall
and chkrootkit and rkhunter both come out negative.  Perhaps I've
averted disaster. I don't need IRC and probably never will. 
Of course a password sniffer or keystroke logger could've been
installed.  But I hardly ever work on that box except thru an ssh
session from a different machine, doea that insulate me from those
nasty tools?

If those two IRC sessions cannot be directly attributed to one of your
users, I'd still be really worried. Perhaps they used a more recent
rootkit, that those do not yet detect.

Blocking IRC is irrelevant, that just blocks the standard control method,
it doesn't keep them out. There are other methods to control a zombie,
and they're already in your machine.

Adjusting ssh/sshd to sniff passwords isn't a big deal for an intruder.
Just another program that needs to be backdoored. Only hitting one tool
might be easier, but figure these are robots doing the work and once they
can do one the cost is minimal for them. I already know of an incident
where the ssh client was made to log passwords.

I notice that I have a file xf86Config-4 that LOOKS like it has all my 
values in it.  When I run xf86config it looks like it changes the file 
xf86config, but leaves the xf86config-4 alone.  I am wondering if the -4 
file is the one being used?  Any ideas?

I've got to agree with Elliot here. If you can't identify the cause of 
those sessions, then you've got to assume you've been rooted. Unless 
you've got a known-good set of tripwire sums, or something similar, my 
advice is to reinstall the OS.

Sounds like something is wrong with your xf86config setup.

It's the file that X (version 4 and later) uses, and that's what counts.  
When you run startx, startkde, or '/etc/init.d/?dm 
start', /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 is the default config file.

  man XF86Config

This happens sometimes when Mandrake decides to change the directory 
layout. There are other reasons too.

I would go to the Easy URPMI (http://easyurpmi.zarb.org/) website and go 
through the setup again. All the instructions needed are there.

Nevermind that.  Looks like there is no setup (maybe the filename is 
compiled in?)  The "something wrong" is with the xf86config program 
(and it's lack of configurability.)

I just use a text editor (but make a backup copy before you start.)  
Look at the man pages, etc.  Most of the configuration sections have a 
man page under "4x".

  man -S 4x mouse

Not sure how to get "apropos" to help you out here, but you can at least 
find where some of the X manpages are (could be all of them) by asking 
man where it found the mouse page:

  man -S 4x -w mouse

xf86cfg is sometimes helpful (though it might not put the config file in 
the right place either.)

Roy, I have experienced similar problems in the past. The way I fixed it was

What distro and version are you running? What were you running before
the upgrade?

There was a transition period between XFree86 3.x and 4.x where distros
would ship with both versions because not all drivers had been ported
from 3.x to 4.x. So depending on what video card you had it would use
either 3.x or 4.x and get the config info from file xf86config or
xf86config-4 respectively.

I am using Debian Sarge, not sure what version, have to check when I get home.  I did a netinstall about a year ago, and haven't done much upgrading until now.  I am still using the testing branch.

That's a section name.

  ls /usr/share/man/

  ls /usr/X11R6/man/

(Finding the corresponding directory on a not-sarge system is left as an 
exercise for the reader.)  Notice that things are split into 
directories.  I don't think that really matters.  Rather I think man 
refers to the .4x in the filenames like "mouse.4x.gz".  So, when you 
say 'whatis mouse' or 'apropos mouse' and see (4) or (3ncurses) or 
(4x), those are the section numbers.  In the case of 'whatis mouse', 
you get:

  mouse (4)            - serial mouse interface
  mouse (3ncurses)     - mouse interface through curses
  mouse (4x)           - Mouse input driver
  
Which means that 'man mouse' is just going to give you the first and 
with 'man -a mouse' you would have to cycle through them one at a time, 
so use "-S 4x" to say "Show me the manpage for 'mouse' from section 
4x."

I guess the other directories are for locales.  If you're really 
interested, read more of 'man man'.

  man -L ko -S 5 passwd

I happen to really like the man system.  Not sure why gnu "shuns it so" 
in favor of info (I guess that's the cathedral talking.)  Really wish 
kde had man pages.

I learned most of what I know from man and apropos.  If you can't find 
it there, you either need to find the howto or what you want to do 
hasn't been done before.  Maybe it's not the easiest way to learn a 
system, but you're less likely to be deceived or underinformed (and 
your understanding of what's really going on will be better) if you get 
your knowledge straight from the source (I learned most of what I know 
about Perl from perldoc, and that keeps me from falling into a lot of 
common traps.)  Okay.  Time to load this soapbox onto the truck so...

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0503241629290.10806@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I have a problem with gpm on my development box's consoles: it's wild and
not domesticated as it is on the other box, and on all previous linux hosts
(portable or fixed). I have no clue what causes this behavior and have not
found an answer on google. (I did find someone running Slackware who solved
this problem by changing the type from ps2 to imps2. I tried all available
mouse types; most did not work while ps2 and imps2 cause the wild scrolling
behavior).

   The problem is that any movement of the trackball causes the screen to
scroll. If a login prompt is displayed, pointer movement causes new login
prompts to show up in a vertical column. If I have text on the console (e.g.,
displayed with the pager 'less') movement of the trackball causes the display
to scroll rapidly. This means I cannot block text to past on another console
or on the other host.

   When X is running the wild rodent settles down and behaves as it should.

   The motherboard on the machine is a Soyo KT600 Dragon Ultra; the CPU is an
Athlon XP+ 3100; the OS is Slackware-10.0.

   Ideas, anyone?

Subject: [PLUG] couple of questions
Message-ID: <20050325012841.B3B20346A@haus.nakedape.cc>

In no particular order..

 

First: As a Linux home user I've had quite a bit of success with getting
things "just so." 

 

Very recently, however I've been stumped as to how to get my Treo to sync
using nothing more than command-line dcop commands.

 

I use KDE as my primary desktop, ergo, I use Kpilot for manual sync-ing. I'd
like to script this to sync every morning when my XMMS alarm goes off. I
have used kdcop in the past with resounding success, whenever the hooks were
present; but I can't for the life of me figure out which dcop command will
kick off a sync. Is this even possible?? I'm not married to dcop, but it's
the one I'm most familiar with. Any ideas?

 

Second: As I work in a Windows shop, I look for any opportunity to integrate
Linux into the network. I am currently looking for a Network Usage
monitoring app/server/whatever to aggregate port usage over the course of an
arbitrary span of time. 

I have no problems installing a dedicated MySQL/et al. server for this..
I've only glanced at Nessus, Snort, and Nagios. I'd like to be able to
administrate it from a web browser. And I'd like to be able to point my boss
to a web page for reports as well. 

            Most of the tools that I've seen are geared more for IDS/ Attack
detection/ Service monitoring. 

Anybody tried anything like this, and got it to work?

Subject: [PLUG] Fixed a spurious interrupt problem
Message-ID: <20050325015734.GA7431@gate.kl-ic.com>


I use an old IBM Thinkpad 560 running Fedora Core 1 as a firewall.
Small, low power, etc.  However, I have had a long term problem that
I finally got around to fixing today, after a very laborious network
upgrade from RH8 to FC1 (which is another story).  This is an older
laptop, with a 133MHz processor, 72MB RAM, and almost nothing built
in;  the inner and outer ethernet ports are both PCMCIA cards,  3Com
3CCFEM556B 10/100 LAN + 56K, using the 3c574 driver for the ethernet
portion of the card.

The problem was frequent (about 6/minute) messages in dmesg and in
/var/log/messages:

kernel: eth1: interrupt(s) dropped!

I only got these messages for eth1, not eth0 .

Linux put the eth0 card at irq 3 and the eth1 card at irq 5.  In
theory, irq 5 belongs to a second parallel port, but there is not
one in the laptop.  However, I was a little worried by potential
interactions with parallel port code in the kernel, so I turned 
off irq 5 with these lines added to  /etc/pcmcia/config.opts :

exclude irq 5 
exclude irq 9

I added the second line because irq 9 is sometimes treated as a
shared interrupt (IIRC) - I wanted to force usage of irq 10.

The card is now on irq 10, and I no longer see the annoying error
messages.  I don't know whether this will improve performance
(it should), but at least the log files are smaller.

Perhaps this will help somebody else, so I am sharing it here.  If
it helps you, return the favor by posting a fix that you discovered!

Message-ID: <20050325022348.GB7431@gate.kl-ic.com>


I am looking for a used Thinkpad laptop, >190MB RAM, >250MHz processor,
to use as a Linux router/firewall.  I can use a machine with many things
busted;  I need a keyboard, 2 PCMCIA slots, and either a working HD15
VGA video port or a semi-working LCD (it can have streaks and uglies and
lots of dead pixels or funny colors).  I do NOT need a working floppy
or CD drive or pointer or hard drive or AC adapter.  I DO want a working
battery, which acts as a "dedicated UPS" for the unit, and I want a
model that uses the IBM 16V, 5mm round barrel AC adapter plug.  A
built-in Ethernet port would be nice, but is not essential.

A TP600 or later would be fine.  I can get a fully functional unit
from Ebay for about $250;  I figure the crippled one I need should
be considerably less than that.

I have a functioning TP560 (72MB RAM, 133MHz processor) doing the
firewall task now;  it is a little too slow and small for future
upgrades and increasing network bandwidth.  So, I thought I would
get my order in now, and if you have an old Thinkpad collecting
dust, let me know, now or in the next few months.

Mike,

Early version of XFree86 used the XF86Config-4 file.  I linked the
XF86Config-4 to the XF86Config file.  Probably the wrong thing to do
because they would not have renamed the configuration file without a
good reason.  Wouldn't they?!?  The current version of XFree86 uses the
xorg.conf file name for the configuration.

   If I'm not mistaken, Ken, the earlier versions of XFree86 (3.x and lower)
used XF86Config and the latest versions use the XF96Config-4 file. However,
there are licensing issues with XFree86 that cropped up a year or so ago.
X.org forked from XFree86 and provides an equivalent -- but completely
unencumbered -- X Window System for linux and other F/OSS. The X.org config
file is /etc/X11/xorg.conf. See <http://www.x.org/>. Their first release was
x.org-6.7; they've just released x.org-6.8.2.

You mean it behaves for X or that starting X causes it to behave for 
gpm?  IIRC, you can tell X to use gpmdata or some-such (sorry, not the 
reverse.)

Tried switching mice?  If the well-behaved one works okay on this 
machine, it's definitely a "this machine" problem.  Are they both 
running the same distro/versions?  Maybe something going nuts with 
interrupts (disable other hardware/drivers/X.)

Rich,

I bow to your response. I omitted what I was thinking when I wrote
"earlier version."  I should have added: earlier versions of XFree86
4.x.

Not sure exactly what you're looking for here, but between Cricket,
MRTG, and ntop, you will probably find that one of them does what you
need. No web admin interfaces (that I know of), but all of them produce
html output.

Perhaps POSSE, or OSDL, or some other Open organization around

Ok, so, what I really want is for my X to start.  Are there some other 
tools I can use to help?  I have tried editing the XF86Config file to 
resemble the XF86Config-4 file in the monitor and device sections that 
concern video and have had no luck.  I am bound and determined to make

Eric,

   When I startx and open a file in a virtual console the pointer behaves;
that is, the contents do not wildly scroll. However, the pointer moves very
rapidly around the screen. I've slowed the response widget in xfce but
without seeing a major difference.

   I have no other pointy device. This trackball (and previous versions of the
same make and model) have performed flawlessly here for more than 7 years.
It's definitely a "this one machine" problem.

Thanks,

Rich

Mike,

   Aha! Now we're getting to the heart of the problem: X won't start, eh? I
had this problem not too long ago and it turned out to be a case mismatch
between what Xfce expected and what it found in xorg.conf.

   In my case the config file, by default, has a section named "Keyboard".
Xfce was looking for a section named "keyboard". I found the problem by
looking at /var/log/Xorg.0.log where I saw that "keyboard" could not be
found. Your installation will have a similar file for your X server and
desktop/window manager. Look in there for insight.

HTH,

Rich

Well this is kind of embarassing but the issue was name servers.  The part 
that makes me feel better is several ISPs in the area , including a rather 
large one , got caught by it also.

It came down to using the inclusive internet DNS root servers ( OpenNIC
<http://www.opennic.unrated.net/>) which either went completely off line
or were renumbered.  I somehow missed ( or got dropped off the announce
mailing list ) the change.

A few quick digs and a rebuild of the '@' file ( dnscache ) and all was 
well again.  Thanks to everyone that replied to my plea for help.

Sorry to take so long.  I did forget to look for the book when I got home.  
( In my defense I came home to a wife with the flu. ) 

A quick look in "Learning Perl/Tk" gave this ( untested ) code.

$widget->fontConfigure(fontname, -size=> 24);

Where 'fontname' can be anything you might have created ( but probably did
not ) or the system determined replacements for 'courier' , 'times' , or
'helvetica'.  A positive 'size' yields a font sized in points and a
negative in pixels.

Ok.  Now do Ctrl+Alt+F1 and try it from the console while X is still 
running.  Behaved or no?

You mean fast, or erratically?  Does it go where it is supposed to?

Wonder if using 'vga=0x317' or something in your boot arguments would 
help.  See "Documentation/svga.txt" in the kernel source.  If that 
helps, maybe it's the video card (I'm guessing something to do with 
misdirected interrupts or other hardware weirdness.)

I'm doing some research for setting up a production Linux environment
for running various apps in as redundant a way as possible, as well as
providing great performance.  All of the apps expect to be running on
one machine and round-robin DNS has been used in the past for client
connections.  Does anyone have suggestions of software that will
increase the reliability of these systems?  Any other suggestions
would be greatly appreciated as well.

I think there's something I don't understand. It sounds to me like 
you're saying that you want to masquerade as myhappyfundomain.com but 
not have myhappyfundomain.com appear in e-mail addresses. But that 
can't be right...

Since it has been months ( or years ) since I did any serious perl/Tk I'm 
kind of shooting in the dark.

Let's see.

After a bit of time fiddling and lunch I decided for my interpretation of 
your stated want/need that you should use the -font attribute in the menu 
creation/definition. 

my $mw = MainWindow->new;
$mw->title( "Yada Yada" );
...
$menu1 = $mw->Menu( ... -font => ['courier', 24] ... )->pack( );
#                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
...


Good luck,

Sorry, that was a little confusing.  I'd like email to appear as
user at mydomain.com, not as user at host.mydomain.com.

Here's the problem, I have scripts running from cron that page my
cellphone.  The sending servers do not have external DNS entries.  My
cell company then bounces these with this message:

553 host.mydomain.com does not exist

So, I'm hoping that I can configure Sendmail on each box to make the
outgoing SMTP conversation using only mydomain.com.
Thanks,
~M

I want to use animated graphics for the TVLinux show.  I am trying to 
explain why making a web browser part of the OS is less secure that  
running it as an app.  I have created slides and "key frames" with in 
slides using OpenOffice Presentation.

Any ideas how to do this using Linux only?

Rod,

   Ah, that confirms what I suspected. I need to dig into the sixpack code and
redo it there.

Thanks,

Try setting the masquerade_envelope feature in your sendmail.mc file:

FEATURE(`masquerade_envelope')

Also, make sure there aren't any "exposed" users, usernames that 
always use the internal site name rather than the masqueraded name.

Hello again,

   I am still playing with my Linux box trying to get my gui back.  The 
actual error on start up is " I cannot start the xserver now.  View x 
server output?"

   All I really want to do is get the gui back.  What I need is some 
help (hand holding type) to walk me through the process of finding the 
problem.  At this point I am relatively certain that the file 
XF86Config-4 is the file that was being used prior to my latest upgrade 
(the point the gui quit working).  I am using the Sarge release but I am 
willing to change if I could do it without loosing data and other files.

   So, is there a set up tool to get x going and probe my video 
hardware?  Or is there some other info I could provide to get help 
here?  One suggestion was that XF86Config was broken.  That may be 
useful to someone who knows how to fix it, lol, but did not help me 
much.  I am just learning how to get around and I really want to fix 
this.  I can wait until the next clinic, but would feel like I really 
accomplished something if I got it going through help here and 
persistence.  Any help you can recommend is appreciated,

Thanks,

Mike

lspci gives you your video card.
www.xfree86.org check the hardware list for which driver to use.
Get your monitor information.  Vertical and Horizontal Frequencies.  
Use your current Xorg.conf/XF86Config file as a skeleton, or use mine.
Edit each section to your specifications.  Be sure you use the correct
mouse setting, USB|PS/2|ttyS0.

Mike,

   Post the log file. It will be in /var/log/. On my Slackware systems the log
is /var/log/Xorg.0.log; it will probably be something with XFree86 or XF86 on
your system.

Yes, that would be helpful.  I've learned a lot by looking at that
kind of gibberish until something I could understand jumped out at me.

I don't remember what distro you're running, but if it's Debian-based,
you can do a "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" to re-do the configuration.

I saw that.  I said, "Hey, I know that guy!"  But before I could take
credit for spotting it first, Keith Lofstrom pointed to it (the
hardcopy version, anyway), on plug-talk I think.  Missed it by *that*
much! ;-)

I haven't been experiencing any problems.  Check your cable TV.  Does 
reception suck on low numbered channels?  If so, call Comcast's TV 
department.  They are more likely to send a truck out over TV 
reception problems than the ISP is about data signal reception 
problems.  Fixing one almost always fixes the other when it's visible 
on the TV.

Okay, I looked through the log file.  That was a great experience!  Mine 
is in XFree86.0.log.  It says it is using the XF86Config-4 file, which 
is something I wanted to know.  It was also the log file from today, so 
I assume it is the current and appropriate file.  The errors reported 
were these:

Unable to find a valid frame buffer device.
NV(0) Failed to open frame buffer device.
Screens found but none have a usable configuration.

Now I don't know what a frame buffer device is, so, I don't know where 
to go from here.  But, I have looked through the XF86Config-4 file and 
verified that my Hsync and Vsync values are correct.  The driver file 
for my video card is nv.  Any other help?

p.s.  is there a way for me to send mail from my shell?  That way I 
could post the files as requested.  I am using my doze box while I am 
fixing the Linux box.
p.s.s. can I use a chat/ IRC from the shell?

Thanks again,

Mike

Mike,

   Look in the "Screens" section of XF86config-4. Make sure that the video
card matches the name in the "Driver" section and that the monitor name
matches the one in the "Monitor" section. Check case and punctuation very
carefully. This is what usually causes the last message above. Fix that and
all problems should go away.

Okay, with many suggestions from you, and a little experimenting of my
own, I think I have fixed the problem.

There is a line in my config file:

"UseFBdev"	"True"

I commented out that line and my gui came back.

Now, can anyone tell me, is that a bad move, or am I to assume since it
worked that I am ok?  My desktop background looks a little darker than I
remember, but, that is of little consequence to me and can probably be
handled through some manual settings,

Thanks all for your help,

   The line directed the X server to use a frame buffer device, but it could
not find one. Ergo, commenting it out is a Good Thing(TM). It would also work
(I believe) if you changeed the "True" to "False".

   Welcome back to your real life.

Subject: [PLUG] Avoiding unwanted e-mail on Comcast
Message-ID: <200503271825.37380.rsteff.l@comcast.net>

A friend of mine signed up with Comcast a couple of months ago. They were out 
of town last week and got in late last night, so when I saw her this morning 
and told her I'd sent her an e-mail, I also said that I didn't expect that 
she'd seen it, yet. She replied while true that she hadn't read it yet, she 
did see it while she was scanning the inbox to eliminate the junk e-mail from 
it. Shortly thereafter, as Bob Hoskins says in Hook, I had an apostrophe! Can 
anyone see a reason why I shouldn't recommend this to folks who tell me they 
are about to sign up with Comcast?

The idea:

To avoid unwanted e-mail, create your primary account on Comcast with a 
throw-away name. Once you have your account, create a secondary account with 
the name you really want to use.


My personal observations show that all the unwanted e-mail comes to my primary 
account, and none of my secondary accounts get any. My wife confirms this 
(her account is one of the secondary ones.)

Any thoughts?

Just hitting delete never solves the answer, reporting does work.  I 
get quite a bit of email (~300/day) with around 2% spam.  No point in 
playing mind-games with spammers and correspondents alike when you 
already hold all the cards...

   I just had an interesting experiece. I forwarded a spam message to the
originating ISP only to have them bounce it with their spam filters! Yes, I
used "abuse at ...". Strange. So I now reject their entire IP address block.

Why don't internet businesses use the abuse at domain.com convention? It's an
easy conventoin to remember if you want to help gether evidence of email
avuse, and using it makes reporting abuse quick and easy. THere's nothing
more irritating than to take the time to report abuse (making sure the
headers are included, etc.) only to find out that either that address is
no good or they want you to go to the their web site and fill out a form!
I guess what it says to me is that they really DON'T want you to bother
them with abuse reports.

Ok, a "duh!" moment. While I've been semi aware of abuse@, it never sunk in 
that just forwarding spam to the serving ISP was a thing I should do. But, 
isn't that just confirming a live address to the spammer running his own ISP? 
Do I need to move up a level to the ISP's ISP? Sounds like I've got more 
reading to do. Any recommended source for this kind of spam fighting 
information?

In any event, reporting is not something many of my friends will want to do, 
or even understand. So, for them, is my idea of having them establish their 
primary account with Comcast as a throw-away name and their preferred 
addresses as secondary accounts a reasonable thing for them to do, or is 
there some gotcha I'm not thinking of?

Dick,

   I don't know if spammers run their own provider services. I suspect not
because they'd be kicked off too often. However, the domain name in the
"From: " line is almost always either spoofed or made up. A dead giveaway is
when you see the "Received from: " line that has "madeupname.com (unknown
[xx.xxx.xx.xxx])" where the xx represents the originating IP address.

   Use that IP address with the "whois" command and you'll find the actual
name of the originating ISP. Usually these now come in a single hop, or the
hop before is also forged and it's an IANA-reserved IP address. So I report
it to the address from which I received it and let them trace it back if it's
not one of their customers.

   SpamCop and SpamHaus are good sources of information.

   Reporting spam is analagous to reporting a robbery. If one does the
reporting there's a chance the robber will be caught or the spammer
disconnected. Most of the time the ISP tells the "spammer" that her machine
has been compromised and to get it cleaned up or lose the account. If you do
nothing then you let them mug us unmolested.

   When I see an IP address from one of the larger providers I take the time
to report it because 1) they almost always take action to prevent it
happening again from that customer and B) it provides jobs for all the
techies who chase these down and follow up on them. However, when the IP
address is part of a block assigned to countries that 1) don't seem to care
about spammers (or eagerly sell them bandwidth as long as the spammer keeps
paying) or B) from whom I would never expect legitimate e-mail, I reject the
IP address block at the MTA level. That's the major reason I brought the mail
server in-house rather than leaving it at my ISP.

   Indifference to spam costs all of us time and money. Both directly and
indirectly. Perhaps it's worth considering educating family and friends on
why spam should be reported and how to do so.

Though it really doesn't do anything for the overall problem, I get some
personal satisfaction from reporting domains that don't have functioning
abuse addresses to the RFC Ignorant list (http://www.rfc-ignorant.org/).

Yes.  If it appears that an  ISP  is not responsive to complaints or is in fact
part of the problem, you then pester their upstream peers.  If the problem is
that serious, I would bring in extra help (Like spamhaus), as some ISPs have
been known to turn a blind eye to spamming activity.  


I've heard tales that the most successful tactic to countering spam is to try to
get a phone number or real address of the spammer's clients or anyone
facilitating them.  This can be almost impossible sometimes, but occasionally
it's possible to find out who's actually making the  money selling the penis
pills..  These individuals and organizations usually have 800 or other types of
toll free numbers, and I've heard that disgruntled spam victims are sometimes
prone to war dialing these 800 numbers every minute until the Spammer signs a
pledge to never do so again.

Of course, I've only heard of such things happening... and I don't actually
recommend that you engage in any of the harassment tactics described above.

Max

I long ago gave up on Comcast's flaky DNS servers, but lately even my
local DNS has been having problems with excessive lost packets to the
.com TLD servers.

So yes, they seem to be having issues lately, but I haven't done any
tests to see how far into their network these problems extend.

Linux Folks:

A combination of unfortunate factors has led to an important file
being deleted from a system that normally needs no backups.  (Isn't
that where ALL the important files are deleted?)  Normally I'd just
regenerate this system from our kickstart image, but the file in
question is a logfile holding debug data for a problem that only
recurs every few months.  If I can avoid waiting for the next
occurrence, I'd like to.

The process writing the log file is still running, so I can grab the
inode number from "lsof" and the OS has not re-used the blocks holding
the data.  I figure I have a few options:

1) "dd" the raw filesystem to another host and use "debugfs" to change
the inode number of some random file on the same filesystem to point
to the blocks holding the data I want, then mount the modified
filesystem and copy this "file" somewhere safe.

2) Use "e2image" to do basically the above since debugfs mentions that
it operates on e2image files, but doesn't mention if the above "dd"-ed
filesystem image will work

3) Use some free Linux file recovery tool.  Google offers few
options-- do any of these work on a "dd"-ed file system image?  (I'm
certainly not going to risk the original!)
  + "r-undelete" frequently mentioned, but not free, despite what their ads say.
  + "r-linux", same company, seems free but is a Windows executable.  How odd.

You might look at some of the computer forensics tools. Autopsy/The
Sleuth Kit come to mind. You could check out the FIRE Forensics bootable
cdrom (http://fire.dmzs.com/), which comes with Autopsy & a bunch of
other tools.

A friend is getting a brand spanking new box in a few days and wants to 
use his iPod with it. ( A Windows free environment at his business ).  So 
I went a looking a few minutes ago and discovered PyMusique.  It looks 
like a great idea without the DRM bypass but I can't seem to find a place 
to download it.  So while I do some more searching I'll ask for other 
suggestions to do iTunes on Linux.  Preferrably known-good solutions with 
no "should's" involved. :-)

Thanks for the tip on The Sleuth Kit.  I have a copy of Helix, but
their documentation is incredibly poor.

I ended up recovering the file via debugfs, but I noticed some strange
behavior.  On the image file I created with "dd", the deleted inode
referenced a chain of filesystem block containing nothing but zeroes. 
However, on the running system the same inode referenced a chain of
filesystem blocks containing the actual log file data.  (I.e. the
contents of the file produced by the debugfs command "dump
<inode-number> /tmp/local_file" were different when run on the image
vs. the live system.)

I don't understand why a "dd" wouldn't capture the whole thing unless
it were stuck in the filesystem write cache.  This log file is months
old, so I can't imagine it being kept in cache that long.

Any ideas on why the captured image wouldn't reflect what was obtained
from the running system?

I've chalked this up to something not quite right in debugfs' handling
of filesystem image files.  The Sleuth Kit's "icat" command recovered
the missing data perfectly from the same image file that debugfs
recovered only zeroes.

Depends on whether it's ext2 or ext3. If it's ext2, you should be able
to recover, there are several tools which can help:

http://recover.sourceforge.net/linux/recover/
http://e2undel.sourceforge.net/

But if it's ext3, the outlook is much worse. Some tools claim to help,
like this one
http://www.sleuthkit.org
or commercial Phoenix Linux.

I work at a domain registrar.  I was painfully aware that Verisign

I've started seeing Comcast problems, too. It seems kind of crazy that I 
should get a bounce sending from my primary account to one of my secondary 
accounts! 

All but the content of the returned message appears below.

Maybe part of the trouble is that according to that info, I sent the message 
tomorrow!

I have yet to see any problems on Comcast.

I use their broadband, however, I do not use their email. I use email at
the Well (well.com) which I retrieve while logged in via ssh to the well's
shell server.

I have also not had problems with DNS.

What kind of DNS flakyness are you talking about?

Also, I am curious, arn't they using what everyone else is using (ISC's
BIND)?

Arn't all root DNS servers set up the same?

I was told sometime back that they all use the same software; ISC's
(Internet software consortium, or whatever) BIND, which is open
source.

Is Verisign using something else?

Bounced messages update:

Earlier, I reported that e-mail I sent to one of my secondary accounts from my 
primary account bounced. I tried it twice, and it bounced twice. My wife 
tells me that she got both of them, and that she's been having the same 
problem between herself and a friend up in Washington who is also a Comcast 
subscriber. Now that I think of it, that happened to the e-mail I sent a 
friend last night, too. Since the message bounced, I tried sending it a 
second time. Both went through, but I only know that because my friend told 
me she got both messages.

Messages to folks on other ISP's don't bounce, and do get through, this 
message thread being an example.

Weird.

I'll certainly try, but for a number of them, just using a keyboard and a 
mouse is a major learning curve! However, some of them will probably 
understand, and for them, I'll make the effort.

If you are using Evolution, check the from tabs.  I discovered I was

On this machine, I use KMail. On the other machine, Netscape 7.1 (Win98SE). My 
wife uses Netscape 4.7 (Win98SE).

I looked at the equivalent settings on KMail just to be sure, and also on 
Netscape 7.1, and found them to be correct. I didn't really expect them to be 
wrong, since I haven't changed them, and this problem just showed up Saturday 
(I was out of town Thu & Fri, so if it started then, I didn't experience it.)

Subject: [PLUG] Holy Troika
Message-ID: <r02010500-1038-CBAC497EA01411D9981E000A959F4BC6@[172.27.1.100]>

Recent PLUG threads have been discussing flaky Comcast, flaky DNS, and
flaky email services.  We might as well throw in flaky Web services just
for the heck of it.

My defense strategy against these flakes is the Holy Troika.  My
experience is by keeping the ISP separate from DNS services, and
both separate from email and Web services, helps me keep my options
open and my sanity too.  My particular troika is Comcast for ISP,
register.com for DNS services, and Interland for both email and Web
services.  The Holy Troika enables me to radically alter any or all
of the services while keeping a consistent Internet domain address. 
Clients appreciate this.

<rant>
Back in the bad old days before using the Holy Troika, I inevitably
experienced spotty service, and out right stupidity when dealing with
ISPs.  I'm sad to say, it was a rare ISP who could even spell DNS let
alone understand changing an MX record.  The most difficult part was
usually changing domain registrar.  Hopefully, things have improved in
the ISP world.
</rant>

I've lost track of how many times the local cable service, now Comcast,
has changed ownership.  Each regime change requires subscribers using
the cable companies DNS, email, and Web services to sooner or later make
domain name changes.  I've ridden out these ownership storms by simply
rebooting the cable modem.

The Holy Troika has a down side, cost.  Keeping a consistent Internet
domain address, while being able to quickly change any pieces of the
troika, is worth it to me and my businesses.

Thanks Carlos.  When I saw the plug in the URL I thought I had slipped a 
cog or two and missed thewhole thread here but after following it I see 
it's a different PLUG.

I'm trying to get LDAP setup on a test box I have.  I believe I have it 
running (I can run a ldapsearch) so now I'm attempting ot use ldapadd to 
add a couple of users and I get the following results.

[root at myserver root]# ldapadd -D 
'cn=Manager,dc=nclack,dc=k12,dc=or,dc=us' -w test
 -f /root/test.ldif
SASL/DIGEST-MD5 authentication started

dn: cn=Person Three,dc=nclack,dc=k12,dc=or,dc=us
objectclass: person

cn: Person Three
mail: person3 at nclack.k12.or.us

Any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  I've looked 
online and at a couple magazines but nothing seems to get me around this 
problem.  Also, any good books on LDAP that you guys would recommend?

Cute post. Sounded a bit too much like an infomercial, however.

Why not run your own DNS?

I know that Interland has in the past had a very bad reputation as being
a spammers' haven. Have they cleaned up at all?

Hi,
I know I've done this before, but I can't remember how.

I want to take a text file, made up of email addresses and chop the 
users name off the domain name so I can uniq -u the domains.

I can't remember what the command is to remove all before the character 
"X"(which in this case is the @ sign).

someone want to assist my aging brain? :)

awk -F@ '{print $2}' < your_file

or...

perl -p -e 's/^[^\@]+\@//' < your_file

or...

perl -n -e 'chomp; if (/\@(.*)$/) { print "$1\n" }' < your_file

And so on.  ;-)  Each responds slightly differently to malformed
input, so choose and adjust as is appropriate for the mangled files
you're likely to see.

sed 's!^.*@!!' your_file

cut -d@ -f2 < your_file

I find that GNU sed is typically faster than any other solution, but 
the real time difference is probably insignificant in a job like 
yours.

Oh, to sort the domain names in a way that takes subdomains into 
account, try

sed 's!^.*@!!' your_file | sort -t. -k 3,3 -k 2,2 -k 1,1 | uniq

This recipe assumes no more than 3 levels of subdomains in any given 
address. I assume you can figure out how to adjust the recipe if you 
know that you have more or fewer...

Well, on that note, I would like to exclaim, "YAHOO!"

I passed my second LPI exam and am now officially certified at LPIC 1.

So who else has taken their tests at Free Geek and gotten their results and 
passed certification?

   Mazel tov!

   However, before getting too carried away: what initials are you now
entitled to add after your name? After all, what good is the certification if
you don't get any initials, eh?

   Consider that there's CPC (for Certified Professional Consultant) and CPS
(for Certified Professional Speaker) and all the other initials that do not
let us know who's doing the certifying. So, linux certification must
certainly be of a sounder basis with greater meaning and deserves powerful
initials to place after one's name. How about PG (Professional Geek) ...
wait, that's already taken by the Professional Geologists to distinguish
themselves from the Amateur Geologists.

I got mine in the first round of tests, having already taken the 101

sed -i 's/.*@//' 
or sed -e if you want to send the result to a pipe instead of editing in place.

Hmm...If redundancy and flexibility are your primary drivers,  your cost factor
issue could be mitigated somewhat by running your own servers.  Only "costs"
besides hardware at this point would  be to purchase commodity transit from a
variety of ISPs or colocation providers.  Once you pinpoint your capacity
requirements, handling things like redundancy is pretty trivial and not that
expensive with DNS and SMTP.

Handling Web services or web applications can get a little tricky, but a good
reverse proxy solution can typically handle load distribution with everything
but the most complex web applications.

Okay, the line that says "This no work." catches some sites 
that it shouldn't.  I'd like to use the test.  I need a 
way to explicitly ignore it for certain smtp sources that 
won't pass, but are valid.

If I understand correctly, Postfix continues to process until
a test fails or the permit line.  What I want to do is 
short cut past these tests for certain trusted domains that 
are likely to fail multiple checks even though they are valid
email sources.  

I want:
     smtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit

for specific email sources.



Seperate problem, greylisting error...

This is postfix-2.1.1, is there an easy way to change the smtp
450 Service is unavailable message to a greylisting for n 
seconds message instead?  I want my smtp error responses 
to be as specific as possible.



Seperate problem, using helo checking...

Any number of sites, such as hotmail for one, don't set their helo 
to the hostname of the server they're using.  I've noticed trouble 
with ebay too.  Is helo checking a worthless thing to do?  Is the 
helo string ambiguous and worthless information?
Is there any standard that is adhered to widely for the helo?  
It seems that a helo being a host name that resolves to the
connected from ip is smart.  The intended recipient smtp 
server can do a comparison, if you can't fool the recipient 
smtp server when it tries to determine what the connected 
from ip is.  How prevalent is ip spoofing?  Can ip spoofing 
be defeated?



Seperate problem, sender verification...

I've heard of smtp authentication, but what's the point if someone
can figure out what you're pasting to your email to get it accepted
and just copy cat what you're doing?  Seems to me that having your
trusted smtp sources make an ssh connection to you is the only way
to secure email transport over the Internet.  Can you run smtp over 
ssh?



Sending email to the Internet with proper headers...

My mailhub sitting on my lan seemingly can't :-(  Can I use
DNAT and SNAT with iptables to trick one of my external
relays into thinking that an smtp session initiated from
another computer on my lan is actually originating from it's 
loopback device?  The mail command on my relay seems to work
for sending email to anywhere with acceptable headers.

   IIRC, the only way to separate years in a gnucash account is by creating a

At the beginning of your smtpd_recipient_restrictions list, add this:

check_sender_access hash:/etc/postfix/whitelist

Then /etc/postfix/whitelist would contain:

someguy at someplace.com OK
somegal at someotherplace.com OK
@myhappyfunplace.com OK

Then run "postmap /etc/postfix/whitelist".

I'm out of time now, but the rest of your questions should be answerable 
with Google or searching the Postfix archives.

"Beginning"?  Since they are checked in that order, it'd be safer to
place exceptions just before the list that you're trying to provide an
exception for, so you can make a specific whitelist workaround.  (Also
keep in mind the DUNNO key... I'm using that in a few of my files.)

This also means that you should put cheap checks first, and expensive
checks last.  It's quite a nice feature.

Tcl/Tk 2005 First Call for papers.
===================================

Tcl/Tk 2005 will be held in Portland, Oregon USA in late October or early
November. The program committee asks all people using and developing with
Tcl/Tk and extensions to submit papers and proposals for presentations at
this conference.

Past conferences have seen submissions covering a wide variety of topics
including and not limited to:

    * Scientific and engineering applications
    * Industrial controls
    * Distributed applications and Network Managment
    * Object oriented extensions to Tcl/Tk
    * New widgets for Tk
    * Simulation and application steering with Tcl/Tk
    * Tcl/Tk-Centric operating environments
    * Tcl/Tk on small and embedded devices
    * Medical applications and visualization


At this point we are requesting submissions of:

    * Abstracts of papers for oral presentation.
    * Proposals for short courses to be taught the day prior to the conference.
    * Proposals for other presentations/discussions.
    * Proposals to present tutorial sessions.

Please send abstracts and proposals to tcl2005 (at) nscl (dot)
msu (dot) edu

Important target dates:
=======================
  July  1, 2005    - Abstracts and proposals due.
  July 31, 2005    - Notification to authors.
  Sep  15, 2005    - Author materials due.

The submissions should consist of an abstract of about 100 words and a
summary of maximum two pages. Omit extraneous or redundant information.
Length is not a direct factor in judging the quality of the submission.

The authors of oral presentations will have 20-25 minutes to present the
paper at the conference.

The program committee will review and evaluate papers according to the
following criteria:

    * Quantity and quality of novel content
    * Relevance and interest to the Tcl/Tk community
    * Suitability of content for presentation at the conference

Proposals may report on commercial or non-commercial systems, but those with
only blatant marketing content will not be accepted.

Application and experience papers need to strike a balance between background
on the application domain and the relevance of Tcl/Tk to the application.
Application and experience papers should clearly explain how the application
or experience illustrates a novel use of Tcl/Tk, and what lessons the Tcl/Tk
community can derive from the application or experience to apply to their own
development efforts.

Papers accompanied by non-disclosure agreement forms will be returned to the
author(s) unread. All submissions are held in the highest confidentiality
prior to publication in the Proceedings, both as a matter of policy and in
accord with the U. S. Copyright Act of 1976.

The primary author for each accepted paper will receive registration to the
Technical Sessions portion of the conference at a reduced rate.

The program committee also welcomes proposals for panel discussions of up to
90 minutes. Proposals should include a list of confirmed panelists, a title
and format, and a panel description with position statements from each
panelist. Panels should have no more than four speakers, including the panel
moderator, and should allow time for substantial interaction with attendees.
Panels are not presentations of related research papers.

Not to encourage infidelity, but has anyone else moved an account from
Fedora to Mac OS X?  I guess the main point would be moving from
Evolution to ?. I believe Firefox is available for Mac.

Comments?

Subject: [PLUG] Open Office Spreadsheet - Center across columns
Message-ID: <200503301003.20958.rsteff.l@comcast.net>

In Excel, one may select several contiguous cells in a row and designate that 
the content of the first cell be centered across all of those cells. A useful 
purpose for this is when one has two rows of header information and groups 
parts of the second row with a title in one cell of the first row.

Example:

------------------------------------
|                       Miles                     |
------------------------------------
|     In        |      Out     |     Total    |
------------------------------------
|                |                |                 |

Is there a way to do this in Open Office's spreadsheet?

Yup. Once you get your stuff into Thunderbird it isn't hard.

I use Linux at home and Mac OS X at work. The only way I know to 
maintain compatibility between mail clients on both platforms is to 
use standards-based network protocols: IMAP for mail, LDAP for 
addresses. Otherwise, data will get lost, no doubt about it...

That said, you might be able to get Evolution to compile and run on a 
Mac -- but that's only a guess. I can say, however, that the Mozilla 
Thunderbird mail client works quite well on OS X. (Pine, too, but 
that's a fairly acquired taste these days. :-)

Also, many people know and like the Apple Mail client.

Yes.  Fedora used to be my main workstation.  First it was a 15"
PowerBook, now it's a 12" PowerBook.  I still keep Fedora around for my
work-work, but all my goofing off and whatnot is on OSX.

I use only webmail and haven't used Evolution in years.

Firefox is indeed available, but Safari seems to work with just about
everything.  The only complaint I heard was probably a year ago that it
wasn't supported by USBank online billpay.  Otherwise I have no
complaints.

> Comments?

I still think Macs are overpriced, but just bought my daughter a mini.  It
was nice to have everything "just work", on the first try.  She loves it. 
Her aging windows box was too hosed up after not being formatted for a few
years, and XP would seize due to I think the wireless nic.  Gave up and
got the mini, the PC is heading to the recycler.

On an unrelated note, I just got an HP 7310 network-connected all-in-one
printer/scanner/fax/copier.  Am tickled with it.  Works great under Linux,
OSX, and Windows.  All over ethernet.

Hi,

I'm looking for some general guildlines for reporting availability and SLA

across is very vendor specific. I'm not looking for suggestions for
monitoring, that part is covered. We're capturing all the data we need,
the issue is more presenting it.

If anyone can suggest any good books or URLs, please let me know. Feel

Do you think the minis are a little under sized for a replacement for a
Fedora box (1Meg, 80G, AMD 2600 (1.8G)?

That sounds good.  We have an old fax that has to be fed one sheet at a

assuming my time is not free I find it's much cheaper to lease "managed" 
servers that sit in somebody else's well powered and well connected data 
center, usually only a few dollars more a month than renting the rack 
space and bandwidth myself and buying hardware to stick in it.

A valid option in many cases.  Depending on what specific services are offered
under the "managed"  umbrella (which can vary significantly: buyer beware, YMMV,
etc. etc.), and much bling bling you think your data has.

Both evolution and Mail.app use standard mbox mail box formats. I moved
my wife to Mail from Evolution by just wedging her Inbox and others into
the correct location for the local user Mail files on OSX. It took a
little smacking around but it worked.. I don't remember all of the
details right now.

Here's a reminder of the low volume LPI study mailing list at freegeek:
http://lists.freegeek.org/listinfo/lpi-study

Well worth the effort.   Check the archives for useful information from
other test takers (but no answers to questions, against the rules!).

Also, those of you who haven't already, register yourself with LPI:
http://www.lpi.org/en/home.html

I take the 101 test Sunday.  Having passed 102 last month, and if I pass
this one, I get to add GEEK after my name, too!  What color propeller do
you get to wear on your beanie if you pass?

One interesting alternative to both managed servers and your own
colo box is a virtual colo set up with User Mode Linux.  I have such
a "machine" at vcolo.com, costing me $23/month.  I serve 8 websites
(one added today, took 5 minutes), 4 mailing lists, 3 wikis, and a
subversion development server off it, and back it up to my office
backup server (dirvish, of course), over a VPN tunnel.

These are normally $20/mo, but I added an extra IP address to do
Randal's high-MX spam trapping, and added 2GB of disk space for
an onsite backup of the machine.  I hope to have 15 second
scriptkiddy detection and alternate image reboot someday.

I hope to have a presentation ready for PLUG or Advanced Topics
Real Soon Now.  One more test will be to see if I can do a live
failover to a different ISP, probably Rimuhosting of New Zealand by
way of Dallas.  This would give me 10Gbps connectivity, meaning I
could use up my monthly bandwidth allotment in under 30 seconds ...

Message-ID: <1112231671.4446.46.camel@denk>


So I'm fighting with merging saved passwords between Mozilla and
Firefox.  I've decided that the easiest thing to do is to understand how
to decrypt the password strings.  I've "removed" my master password for
the time being, which AFAICT just means they're encrypted with an empty
string for key.  I can parse the actual content of the password file,
but what I do not understand ASN.1 encoding and all that stuff well
enough to get past 'bad magic number' from 'openssl'.  (Oh yeah, I
figured trying to use the openssl command-line tools would be the
quickest path to understanding this stuff.)

To start with, here's an encrypted string, stored in a file called 'p':

MDIEEPgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEwFAYIKoZIhvcNAwcECBN1DvAmjAkIBAhVWnt9v9k9Mw==

(The decrypted string is terribly interesting; it should be "wcooley".)

Here's the actual Seamonkey code:

http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/security/nss/lib/pk11wrap/pk11sdr.c#183

According to the comments, the data is DER-encoded, but it appears the
actual stored string is PEM-encoded (from what I understand, one is a
binary and the other ASCII representation of ASN.1-encoded data
structures).  I can use the OpenSSL 'asn1parse' command to actually view
the ASN.1 structure:

$ openssl asn1parse -inform PEM -in p -i 
    0:d=0  hl=2 l=  50 cons: SEQUENCE          
    2:d=1  hl=2 l=  16 prim:  OCTET STRING      
   20:d=1  hl=2 l=  20 cons:  SEQUENCE          
   22:d=2  hl=2 l=   8 prim:   OBJECT            :des-ede3-cbc
   32:d=2  hl=2 l=   8 prim:   OCTET STRING      
   42:d=1  hl=2 l=   8 prim:  OCTET STRING      

Ah, des-ede3-cbc!  That cipher corresponds with #defines in the code
(SEC_OID_DES_EDE3_CBC).  Well, this seems to be the obvious thing to
try, after reading over the 'enc(1)' man page:

openssl enc -des-ede3-cbc  -d -in p -salt
enter des-ede3-cbc decryption password:
(Nothing)

openssl enc -des-ede3-cbc  -d -in p -salt -k
bad magic number

Okay, maybe the 'enc' command doesn't want PEM; try to convert to DER
using 'asn1parse':

$ openssl asn1parse -inform PEM -in p -out p.der
...

Verify that it's DER:
$ file p.der
p.der: data
[wcooley at denk:~/tmp] *17:00:58*
$ openssl asn1parse -inform DER -in p.der -i
    0:d=0  hl=2 l=  50 cons: SEQUENCE          
    2:d=1  hl=2 l=  16 prim:  OCTET STRING      
   20:d=1  hl=2 l=  20 cons:  SEQUENCE          
   22:d=2  hl=2 l=   8 prim:   OBJECT            :des-ede3-cbc
   32:d=2  hl=2 l=   8 prim:   OCTET STRING      
   42:d=1  hl=2 l=   8 prim:  OCTET STRING      

After that, I've tried many permutations of things to use for key; the
only thing that gets anything other than 'bad magic number' is using '-K
0 -iv 0', which results in some fun binary data dumped to the screen and
a 'bad decrypt' error:

$ openssl enc -des-ede3-cbc  -d -in p.der -salt -p -K 0 -iv 0
salt=08DB2008912DF0B7
key=000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
iv =0000000000000000
5?
bad decrypt
9737:error:0606506D:digital envelope routines:EVP_DecryptFinal:wrong
final block length:evp_enc.c:431:

My guess at this point is that the 'enc' subcommand is expecting
unstructured data, but I'm giving it ASN.1 DER structures.  I cannot
find a way to extract the unstructured data or if I have, I haven't got
the right keys or something.  I've tried the '-strparse' option to
extract bytes 20-41 (extracting 22-31 results in an empty output file;
32-41 gives an error), but still no luck.

Anyone more crypto-savvy got any hints?

Message-ID: <20050330191648.23f72ba3.rdought@pacifier.com>

I managed (after numerous failed attempts) to configure and build a bootable (and generally usable) 2.4.28 kernel.  (I previously used the bloated genkernel in gentoo.)  I was generally successful; however, I can't access my CD or DVD devices.  Both of them are identified during boot: 

bash-2.05b$ dmesg
...
hdc: ASUS CD-S500/A, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
hdd: _NEC DVD_RW ND-3520A, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
...

And cdrecord -scanbus identifies them.  But, they don't show up in my device files after boot, so I can't mount or access them. 

bash-2.05b# mount /dev/hdc /mnt/cdrom
mount: special device /dev/hdc does not exist

I must have missed something when configuring my kernel.  It should be pretty obvious, but it eludes me.

What am I missing?

Thanks.

Not so obvious: If you've enabled IDE-SCSI for those drives, they'll
do that.  It's enabled at the kernel commandline, so you can do 
'cat /proc/cmdline' to see what it's being told.

Subject: [PLUG] getting started
Message-ID: <1112244369.2431.8.camel@localhost>

Since the topic of Linux certification has come up it raised some
curiosity for me.  I would like to start working toward something like
that, mainly for my own satisfaction.  Can those of you with the
experience recommend some starting materials for me?

I am also interested in learning tcl/tk.  Do you have any
recommendations on where to start?

I have had computers since, well hell, for a long time.  I written
programs mainly for personal use for as long as we could have personal
computers, or maybe I should say since circa 1976 or so.  For the last
decade I had bought into the windoze idea but for the last few years I
have made the switch to using Linux, and now prefer it to any other
system.  I am a dentist currently working for the government, I am 47
and will retire in August.  Most of the applications I wrote were for
improving my efficiency at work.  My goals are to become proficient at
creating applications on Linux systems, and being a proficient system
administrator as I would like to encourage everyone I meet to use this
OS and be able to help them make the transition.  I hope I have included
enough info for you to know how to give me some guidance.

Thanks again,

Mike

That was the key.  This was in my /proc/cmdline:
	
	hdc=ide-scsi hdd=ide-scs

I commented those out and I had access to my drives again.

What pwcheck_method are you using?  If saslauthd, which authentication

(Because it checks the clean flag on the filesystem, and unless there is a
panic or other unclean shutdown that does tend to get reset.)

Other way around. `fsck` is a pretty simple wrapper for `fsck.<fs>` (where
<fs> is "ext2", "ext3" or whatever). `fsck.ext2` and `fsck.ext3` are
generally symbolic links to `e2fsck`. The fun part is unless the FS is
actively marked as dirty (kernel checks found inconsistancies) or it has
exceeded the mount count, `fsck.ext3` is a no-op as it lets the kernel do
journal playback.

I see similar errors as well but have never looked into it.. 

Postfix and Dovecot (Ubuntu Hoary)

pwcheck_method: saslauthd
mech_list: PLAIN LOGIN

saslauthd is using

MECHANISMS="shadow"

/etc/sasldb2 is 660 root:sasl


I'm sort of figuring that it's a permission problem to the file.. could
adding postfix to group sasl solve the issue? However, saslauthd seems
to be running as root via ps -eaf | grep sasl

I've not had any issues authenticating, send or receiving, via multiple
connection types... pop3s, imaps, smtp(tls).. Is it something that needs
to be cleaned up or is it just noise?

I suspect John has no financial stake in anything he's proposing
(except maybe as a distant small investor in some tiny fraction of
stock).

I have also worked for John, and found him to be of good character.

I therefore find your accusations excessively paranoid.

(Hmm, the NNTP posting appears to be not working right now.)

I'm sorry to hear that. I don't think I'm excessively paranoid, so much

I recently set this up for me and here are some good links I found.  I
forget which will fix this error but I know I saw had to do a setting
in postfix to resolve it.  In either case these are all the links I
used.

Subject: [PLUG] Adaptive firewall considerations
Message-ID: <20050331225527.GA21515@aracnet.com>

Hi all,

I'm toying around with some adaptive firewall ideas. In looking at the 
iptables logs and deciding what patterns might be worth adapting to, I've 
noticed that most of the hits coming from the outside are on TCP ports
135 and 445 (Windows RPC and DS respectively). Sometimes these hits come 
in big bunches, obvious attempts by a Win32-based worm to spread itself. 
But most of the time it's just a slow trickle.

So here's my question, and I guess it's more of a Windows question than
a Linux question, but trust me that the firewall runs Linux.

To what degree would a normally configured or typically misconfigured but 
*uninfected* Windows box try to connect to other random hosts on ports 
135 or 445? Is there some level of normal Window chat, or does *any* 
attempt to connect to our IP addresses from the outside on these ports 
indicate malicious intent?

If there is some normal level of chatter then I assume it would be limited 
to the immediate network on which the Windows box resides such that it 
might be normal to see this trickle of hits from the neighbors on our 
ISP's network, but hits to these ports from hosts in China would clearly 
be malicious. Yes? No?

Thanks,
Terry

You can force an fsck on the next boot by putting a file in /.
For Redhat, I think the file is /.autofsck and for Debian, it's
/forcefsck

The sample programs are decent. O'Reilly has a book on Tcl/Tk.

Alas IMO I have to suggest starting nowhere, and not bothering. Though it
is taking a long time, I suspect Tcl is a dying language. I've suspected
this for a long time, yet it is still here so I could be wrong, but it
does seem like Tcl/Tk isn't growing.

Seems like something that should be added to `tune2fs`, but like Russ I
know of no handy way of doing so. Though `fsck -f` which forces, despite
the clean flag may be what you want. With most init script varients
creating the file "/forcefsck" will tell them to pass -f to fsck on
startup. Doing `touch /forcefsck` might be what you desire.

I would recommend studying for the LPI.  There are only a handful of
books on it, I like the O'reilly book but it's kind of old.  There's
also an excellent tutorial series at IBM DeveloperWorks for LPI.

I found that studying/cramming with other folks really helped.  As
mentioned, there's an lpi-study list at FreeGeek.org.

Have you checked out what's at the library?

   Yes, it seemed that way eight years ago. However, yesterday I posted on
this list an announcement/call for papers for the Tcl/Tk 2005 conference to
be held this autumn. Source navigator uses it and so do a bunch of other
applications. Of course, with 50 gazillion scripting languages available,
market share for the older ones is decreasing. They just don't get the shelf
space they used to.

Tcl shells and precompilers have just recently been added to Cisco IOS in the
latest release train.  It is also used extensively in other newish network
management platforms (F5 networks, Inkra, ) to replace proprietary scripting
languages.  So I would necessarily say that it's dying if such features are
recently being incorporated in the these platforms.  Perhaps it's dying in the
context of gui stuff, but for tool command :-) related activities it seems to be
a sort of weird retro defacto standard.

Max

For better or worse, many electronic design tools use Tcl as their 
scripting language.  I'm not sure why they originally chose this path.

galen,

   Perhaps because John Osterhout teaches/taught in an electrical engineering
department at the university? I'm reaching into dusty corners of my memory,
but I believe the language was originally designed as a glue to stick
together different engineering tools.

Port 135 is for directory replication
Port 445 is for SMB protocol over IP

So if you are wanting to replicate directories and share files over the internet
via IP then these need to be open.

Windows boxes do try to find each other and this is a polling operation
that occurs even when no connections are made.

First hit from google as to explain best methods of protection and
what the ports
do.

You can force an fsck on the next boot by putting a file in /.
For Redhat, I think the file is /.autofsck and for Debian, it's /forcefsck

I have a box that I've been using as a file server/media server
everything else, including a PVR.

I recently added a Hauppauge PVR-350 card to the system and upgraded a
lot of software.  It all works but it's become very unstable.  It's
uptime is anywhere from 3 hours to 3 days, and not much more than that.
I've given up backing it up as I can't keep it up long enough to make a
backup.

It has 3 hard drive's on two separate controllers.  2 drive are in raid
1 and the other one was installed in the last 2 weeks and contains the
OS.

It's running debian unstable w/ a custom kernel.

The main error that I see is something like 

kernel: Trying to fix it up, but a reboot is needed



Tonight when I started looking again, I'm also seeing

All that google produces on this is that it's a bug of the 2.2 kernel

Subject: [PLUG] Open Source TV-B-Gone?
Message-ID: <20050401053137.GA3676@gate.kl-ic.com>


By now, most of you have heard of the nifty new product TV-B-Gone,
a little $20 keyfob unit with an infrared emitter that mimics the
turn-off codes of thousands of different television sets.  It just
ships out ALL the turn-off codes in sequence, taking about 10 seconds
(and sometimes up to 70 seconds) to find the right code to turn off
a particular model of goddamnoisybox.  Just the thing when you are
in an airport waiting area and want to take a nap, or work on your
laptop, rather than listen to CNN blather. 

This was particularly acute in the Dallas airport a couple of weeks
ago;  blaring TVs all over the place, but all the wall sockets were
powered down so I could not charge my laptop.  

There is an open source "LIRC" project - Linux Infrared Remote Control -
that is working on using IrDA ports on laptops to remote-control TVs
and VCRs and the like.  Most Palm Pilots have IR ports for "beaming"
information to each other.  Perhaps you can guess where this is 
heading...

If there is some ambitious person on this list who is as annoyed
with gratuitous TV bombardment as I am, please consider designing an
open source program for Linux laptops that does the same thing as TV
B-Gone.  It could go one step further - there are only so many kinds
of television sets in a given airport, so after some experimentation
and community feedback, your could emit just the subset of codes that
worked in a particular place.  So you could type "tvoff phoenix" or
"tvoff logan" and get nearly instant response.

And for those of you who need their TV fix everywhere, all the time,
we will give you your own special place out on the sidewalk next to
the smokers you approved of evicting.

Keith
