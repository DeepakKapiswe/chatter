Subject: [PLUG] how to adjust for special characters in mkdir() function?
Message-ID: <4CA67E93.1060203@gmail.com>

  Quick question:

I am trying to use the mkdir() command from sys/stat.h library, but it 
is blowing up when the directory name has some type of character in it, 
such as a space character or hyphen.

What is the command to fix this?  Is activating UTF-8 characters what is 
needed?  I am using the C++.c_str() to supply the directory name, should 
I use some IOMANIP function to fix this?

http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/mkdir.html 
doesn't have anything on this, but I do get the ENOENT error.

Please note: This is NOT the mkdir function typed at the command line, 
but the function call for program code.

What arguments are you passing to mkdir()?  Do all elements of the 
path leading up to the new directory name exist?  The following 
program works for me.


#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

main()
{
         mkdir("/tmp/foo bar-baz", 0777);
}

I have the directory as "/home/myname/Desktop/Items/GPS Summary Files" 
so there are two space characters in the path name.

I just now created the whole correct destination directories, and yet 
the command still fails.

This points that the string.c_str() function is NOT passing the correct 
characters to the mkdir() function, as there is NOT a problem with the 
actual existence of the directories.

Galen:

Try to make a directory with two depths, mkdir("/tmp/deeper/foo bar-baz 
bam", 0777); and see if that fails.  I have been playing around with the 
directory depth and my program fails with two slash characters in the path.

mkdir() only takes two parameters and I'm not sure how it handles
spaces in the parameter #1.

daniel at krosp:~$ ls -ld '/tmp/foo bar'
ls: cannot access /tmp/foo bar: No such file or directory
daniel at krosp:~$ perl -e 'mkdir("/tmp/foo bar/baz quux", 0777) or die $!'
No such file or directory at -e line 1.
daniel at krosp:~$ mkdir /tmp/'foo bar'

drwxrwxr-x 2 daniel daniel  6 Oct  2 13:50 /tmp/foo bar/baz quux

mkdir(2) and mkdir(3) (and related tools like mkdirat) will only create the
specific target directory, not any part of the path, as was mentioned.

Also, if that didn't work ... well, it would have been noticed. :)

The same way any path handling function under Unix / POSIX does: they are
treated exactly the same as any other legal character for a file naming
component, which is to say like any character except for NUL and '/'.

Ironically mkdir -p does create a full path directory with multiple 
slashes, I am using it right now in a shell script program.  But 
apparently mkdir() won't

Well, yeah.  By, like, design and all.  The '-p' argument asks the mkdir
software to split the path, and create any missing directories, so it can do
that.

So, if you want that behaviour you need to implement it yourself, or grab some
code to do it for you.  Pretty much every higher level language in existence
has "make the whole path" implemented somewhere. :)

        Daniel

As Daniel says, mkdir(2) only creates a single directory at a time. 
mkdir(2) is little more than a wrapper around the mkdir system call.
To see what a command like mkdir -p does, try something like this:

strace mkdir -p /tmp/a/b/c

My solution will be to parse the directory path and split it into each 
directory and make them one at a time.  Just a little more code to add, 
but now I know what's going on.

If undefined DocumentRoot is set to /usr/local/apache/htdocs is this symlinked to 
/etc/apache2/htdocs on your system?

Then check:

    cd /etc/apache2
    find . -type f | xargs -n 30 grep DocumentRoot

That will confirm or deny your config assumptions.

try sudo httpd2 -S or apache2 -S

this should give you a list of hosts it's configured for, and which config
file it read the config for that host from.

#server5:/root=> apache2 -S
VirtualHost configuration:
192.168.0.199:*        is a NameVirtualHost
          default server www.myhost.com 
(/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default:2)
          port * namevhost www.myhost.com 
(/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default:2)
Syntax OK

Looks like it is looking in the right file in the right directory.
FYI, These config files, in fact the entire /etc/apache2 directory are 
EXACTLY the same as on the four other servers here.  Three are Debian 
(2-5.0, 1-4.0) and one is Ubuntu 10.4.  They all work just fine.  Wonder 
if there is some weirdness introduced by 10.10?

Subject: [PLUG] AMD video cards...
Message-ID: <1286183908.2190.13.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I'm curious how the Radeon 2600 XT and Radeon 2600 Pro are different and
which one works best under Linux?

How is the Radeon HD 3450 different from the Radeon 2000 series cards?
I'm having problems with mine randomnly cutting the signal to the
monitor.  Sometimes playing Warcraft II via wine, I can switch to a 
text console via alt-Fn and back fixing the issue.  If I want to
network boot my Linux from scratch system, I have to swap my 
Radeon 7500 back in.  I want a higher end card that actually works in
Linux in general.  If that means PCI express, I need to know what to
get as far as new motherboard, processor, memory, etcetera.

It looks like the Radeon 2600 XT is the best bet for dual DVI
connections and working with Linux's open source drivers.  The
pro looks like a wimpy version of the 2600 XT.  I have an Nvidia
6200 on the shelf, but it requires a proprietary driver and is
anything but satisfactory.

It looks suspiciously like a network stack issue. Although odd that
errno=0 as that would seem to indicate it wasn't actually a failure,
maybe transient in nature? Using an ethernet nic or wireless card?

If you can, I'd fire up wireshark if you're a GUI fan or plain old
tcpdump to a file and see if you can find some context around that
error.

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=BCXvNxdMNoVwFKNXNw0Z52O7SrgBFpbggvENP@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm teaching a class on Thursday evenings at Portland Community
College this term.
As a result, I won't be making the PLUG meetings, but that won't
change anything.
Michael Dexter will lead the meetings and we have the following
meetings scheduled:

Oct 7, 2010   -  Dale Zeutenhorst will present on eBox.
Nov 4, 2010  -  Dan Carrere will present - He gave me a topic, but I
seem to have forgotten it.
Dec 2, 2010  -  John Jordan will present on Scribus.

My class at PCC finishes a bit after 9:00 PM, so I should be able to
make BEER after the meetings.
Also, I intend to attend the clinics this term.

  Sincerely,
  David Mandel

The culprit was incorrectly formatted virtual host configs.  You'd think 
there would be some kind of error more appropriate to the problem. 
Anyway - 3 days of chasing my tail and now we're golden.

Thanks for all the help . . .

Is there an Ubuntu LOCO team in Portland? Or is PLUG the nearest thing?

Yes, there is, although officially listed as a "new" team (whatever
that distinction means):

There are several others in the northwest, some of which claim to cover
Oregon:

Sure -


The /etc/apache2/sites-available/default config files are below - in 
both cases apache2.conf was the same.  The main differences are 
apparent.  Primarily in the definitions of the vhosts.  Other gotchas 
that I had to overcome were specific to my sites and testing methodology 
- mainly in /etc/host.

When I scanned through the member list I noted that our own Tim B
appears to be a member. I also noted that several others had e-mail
addresses, although I didn't try to e-mail anyone. Perhaps one of the
other addresses will work.

I am impressed with their goals. I have long wanted to assist in
handing out Ubuntu CDs. I have had a small amount of experience in that
venture. A lot of the time people are terrified of trying even a live
CD. Certainly their reaction is worse if the CD label is scribbled with
a sharpie. I wanted to figure out how to make professional looking CDs
printing them on an inkjet with official Ubuntu artwork. I never got
very far with the idea because other more important things in my life
got in my way. 

I was going to make them available at PSU. But having a display at
Fry's, ENU, inter alia sounds even better.

I live about 2 hours away from PDX, but it is the nearest metro area for me.
I would love to have an active LOCO group anywhere, but PDX is better than
nothing.

It looks like this LOCO is an argentinian distribution of linux, not the
Ubuntu LoCo project:http://loco.ubuntu.com/

And even if Denis is right and it is discontinued, clearly it needs an
injection of Linux goodness. I say we all show up on the 15th. And
someone needs to e-mail all still-valid addresses on the list to let
them know that there will be PLUGgers there on the 15th. Also invite
them to cross-collaborate with PLUG.

Subject: [PLUG] question for Ubuntu gurus
Message-ID: <4CAE6790.9030208@gmail.com>

  Any Ubuntu 10.04 guru who knows how bind9 works to implement a local 
name server on a machine with a dynamic IP itself?

I have dhcp3-server running okay now, but I am having trouble 
implementing a local name service because apparently the conf files 
expect a static ip, not a
dynamic one.

I would like to hear from you, if you've done this.   I am trying to 
bring up a LAN and corral the naming service to isolate the LAN to only 
selected IPs.

Thanks!

I haven't specifically done what you are trying to do, but you might 
want to take a look at using dnsmasq.  For simple networks, it tends 
to be easier to configure.

I would think a dynamic IP would preclude the being of a DNS server, as if the servers IP were to change, no one could find the DNS anymore.

Or am I missing something here?

Maybe I've not provided enough information.  The dhcp server is 
assigning a dynamic ip to the eth1 interface.  The dns server needs to 
know eth1's IP alright but the conf files expect a static ip, as you stated.

I think the solution is to make eth1 a static ip, and lend out a dynamic 
ip to the router downstream, and then the dns server will be happy.

Or as another person suggests, perhaps run dnsmasq, but Ubuntu has a 
semi-automatic network manager that likes to do things itself, as I am 
finding out.

Subject: [PLUG] How To Remove "Ghost" Files?
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1010080645160.19758@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   This morning's report on the dirvish backup reported errors of files being
removed before they could be backed up. This in a directory that I've not
accessed for several years so nothing should have changed any files there.
As a matter of fact, I've done nothing in that partition recently.

   Anyway, I cannot remove this spurious files as they have no information
associated with them when displayed. Here's an example:

?????????? ? ?        ?          ?                ? xdbctl_8h-source.htm

   While I'd like to understand how these files became corrupted, I don't
need them so the more important question is how to delete them.

   I've tried, as root, putting the file name in double quotes but the system
tells me the file does not exist.

   Your thoughts and suggestions on how to clean this up are wanted.

TIA,

Rich

You might try deleting it by inode number:

# get the file's inode (e.g., 123456)
ls -i
# delete file by inode number
find . -inum 123456 -exec rm {} \;

Or, if the file has bizarre characters in its name that confuse rm,

   find . -inum 123456 -exec rm -- '{}' \;

   Darn! It tells me that all those files (when I ask specifically for one
inode) that, "find: ./xdbctl_8h-source.htm: No such file or directory".
Sheesh!

Paul,

One way would be to ...
    (a) cp all files except the 'unwanted' ones to a new (temporary) 
directory outside of their current directory
    (b) rm -rf the directory in which the 'unwanted' files reside
    (c) mkdir the deleted directory again
    (d) mv all those 'good' files to the recreated directory
    (e) rm -rf the temporary directory that you made in step 'a'
... there are other ways, of course

rm -i * with a lot of n key pressing is much easier.
modify * to get smaller list to work from.

Unmount and fsck.  There isn't any valid reason for either the listing 
you showed or the inability to delete the files.  Looks to me like 
orphaned files or invalid directory entries, both of which fsck will 
find.  What file system is this?

Michael,

   I think this is what needs to be done. I cannot delete the directory when
it contains only these strange files.

   This weekend. It's supposed to rain, I've mowed the yard and trimmed the
trees, and I need to upgrade the OS on this box, too.

Thanks,

I'm also still confused about what you are trying to do...  Are you
wanting an authoritative server or a recursive one?

Yes, it does.  I've fought with it on a number of occasions... =\
It seems when some people go to write a GUI interface, they often
forget that much of the world still likes editing config files.

Yes, that can be easier, if it works ... but in the rare case that it 
doesn't, then the long way around does ... or at least it always has for 
me, so far.

As mentioned in a post by Ewan, it may be something that needs the 
application of 'fsck', in which case the procedure above may get ride of 
th file(s), but not the problem?

Message-ID: <20101008170345.GB2179@sentinelchicken.org>


Hi all,

About two years ago I built my parents a new Ubuntu system from
scratch.  Unfortunately, a couple of months back, they started having
problems with the system shutting off randomly (cold power-off).  I
spent many hours trying to figure out what the cause was.  It seemed
to be related to use of the onboard video, since disabling 2D
acceleration made it somewhat more stable, but the system was still
unacceptably unstable.

Finally I gave up and bought them a new motherboard and associated
hardware.  It is running fine now, on virtually the same hardware
setup.

Shortly after that, in an unrelated spat of hardware trouble, my
brother started having difficulties with one of his older LCD
monitors.  He found others who had the same issues and sent me this
great article on diagnosing/fixing bad capacitors:
  http://wcoastsands.blogspot.com/2009/11/samsung-syncmaster-215tw.html


So I went back and looked at my parents' old motherboard and sure
enough, two capacitors on the board are bulging very similarly to what
is described in that article.  It may be a  < $5 fix for an
adventurous person with a soldering gun.  I would do it myself, but
unfortunately this motherboard does not have a CPU or memory in it
anymore, since I moved it over to my parents' new system.  So I can't
easily test it.

I would be more than happy to give this board away, along with its
case and power supply to anyone who is willing to try and get it
working again with new capacitors.  Otherwise I'll just have to give
it to free geek, and I doubt they will put in the time to repair it
(though correct me if I am wrong).

The system is a Shuttle SN68SG2.  Specs can be found here:

Thanks!

  Tim,

  I've recently pulled off this kind of repair successfully a couple of times and would love to give it a try with 
the board you described.  Of course, if I can't revive it I'll forward it to FG.

+1 for all of this.

so, make sure you check dmesg before the reboot to see if there are
any hard drive errors being logged, check its SMART status (if it
supports that), and pat yourself on the back for making backups (where
you can also see if there were once files there that got lost, in case
fsck doesn't stick anything in /lost+found)

other than FS corruption (which has manifested like that several times
in my life), i have seem such a corrupted directory listing one other
time...on a CIFS remote file system's mount point, which would only
clear up with a reboot, though i could successfully remount the FS on
another mount point.  accessing the corrupted one would leave a
process stuck in disk wait state.

luck++;

Wow, I'm surprised by the quick responses from people willing to hack
on a 2 year old board.  That's cool.

I'll just have to make it first-come-first-served.  If anyone is else
is also interested in the board, email me off-list and I'll give you
my contact info to join the race.

Tim:

I have the dhcp working correctly now and parsing out dynamically on a 
range, but I did fix the eth1 to a static address. Things are now 
working as expected.

I thought I needed an authoritative server but the dns is still hosed up.

My server knows where "nginx" is from the /etc/hosts file as the dig 
command shows but when I try a ping from the client it gets dumped. 
(tcpdump log)

Something is still wrong with resolving addresses, but I am not sure 
what.  I am running both dhcp3-server and dnsmasq, and yes, I had to 
hammer Ubuntu's network manager gui profiles to fix eth1.

The diagram below is what I am trying to do:

Fios --->  eth0 --> server  --> eth1 --> router --> clients1-4

I am trying to corral the dns requests from the clients to go no higher 
than the server and not go out to the internet

Why the router? replace it with a switch and you should be golden.

Fios --->  eth0 --> server  --> eth1 --> switch --> clients1-4

server's eth0 is assigned by DHCP

server's eth1 is set static (192.168.1.1?)

server assigns local addresses on eth1 via DHCP

server gives DNS server address (192.168.1.1) via DHCP

server's DNS server is recursive, not authoritative (authoritative is for
when you're hosting your own domain's DNS on the internet)





Alternatively, and a lot more simply:

Fios --->  router --> server + clients1-4 (with a switch to add ports as
needed

router's WAN port is assigned by DHCP

router assigns local addresses on the LAN ports via DHCP

router is configured to act as local DNS server (standard on many home
routers these days)

Server gets a static IP in the local range (192.168.1.2)

Set up DMZ on the router to forward public traffic to the server

I could, but at the moment all that I had was a router.  Guess I will 
buy another switch.

The DNS requests from the clients are still not being answered 
correctly, but at least I know where the last problem is, at the server end.

Are AMD and NVIDIA the only companies that produce high end video cards
now?  What happened to Matrox?  I don't like NVIDIA because the company
refuses to release the specs needed for open source drivers to be
written.  I don't like AMD/ATI because my Radeon HD 3450 isn't stable
under Linux and the video is slow.  There doesn't seem to be a good
dual DVI card for dual heading that is an AGP 4x card from AMD.

As long as you are just using the LAN ports, then it effectively *is*
a switch.  A real switch might potentially perform better though.

Hello,

Matrox hasn't been around for a while, not in any significant way anyway.  I
still remember when 3DFX cards were the bees knees, now they are but a
distant memory.

These days, if you want 3D performance, you need to go either NVidia or
AMD/ATI.
If you want decent 2D and some 3D performance (but not great), there is
Intel.  Intel graphics work quite well with Linux, with open source drivers.

But you won't find a 4X AGP Intel card (well possibly, but ones that old
will not be very good, compared to their current stuff),
they are all integrated graphics chips on Intel motherboards.
You are talking about a tech that has been left in the dust, video chips
these days are either integrated in the motherboard or PCI-Express.

As for my own experience, I have used mostly Nvidia on the desktop, with
Linux.  Yes I use the proprietary blob driver.  No it isn't open source.
No I do not like that.  But, it works.  I can play high end 3D games and
such under Linux.  It works quite well.  I have used Nvidia for many years,
AGP and PCI-E.  I also have had some ATI stuff in laptops, which also works
well in Linux using the stock drivers, but I don't do high end 3D games on
the laptop, and thus have not used the proprietary driver.  I did try the
proprietary driver some time ago, and at least on my laptop it didn't work
right (ATI Radeon M9 I think it is).  ATI stuff does work with Linux, you
are basing your opinion on one single outdated card.

What it boils down to, is do you want to do any high end 3D stuff (games,
CAD, 3D modeling, etc), or do you  just want to have a nice video card to
keep an older system running.  If you want high end 3D, you should really
consider upgrading to a newer setup, with a dual core Intel or AMD CPU,
PCI-Express graphics, and DDR2 or DDR3 system RAM.  This means new
motherboard, CPU, RAM, and video card, and most likely a new power supply.
If you want to go this route, we can help you find the right equipment, it
doesn't need to be all that expensive depending on what you choose.

As for keeping an older system going, I think when I was in the AGP stage, I
used an Nvidia 6600GT, it worked quite well in Linux (yes with proprietary
driver, but I wanted to do high end 3D stuff).  I have been using mostly
Fedora and WinXP dual boot on my machine, at that time it would have been
around Fedora 4,5,6 maybe.  Now I am running Fedora 12 and Win7, and my
setup is PCI-Express NVidia 8800GT.

Thanks Matt.  Looks like my best bet cost wise and results wise is to
upgrade.  I've been putting this off as long as possible.  I'm a 
college student and money is a little tight.  Being a CS major though,
my system needs to be stable and potentially higher end.

There are multiple multi core options these days where some boards with
LGA775 sockets are already considered old tech.  So going multi core
isn't enough, one needs to be careful.

A concern of mine is that my network root Linux system that I use to
back up Windows systems and Linux systems is Pentium III optimized.
Will a multi core system run in a Pentium III compatible mode?  For
backing up, I see no need to utilize all cores and be 64 bit.

I'm thinking that by Christmas, I should have a dual core or better
system put together.  The budget is $1k or less, preferably less.
Sometimes the Intel boards allow one to run the onboard video or
replace it with an add-on video card.  I'm thinking that step wise
upgrading might be preferable.  It would be nice to be able to run 
more than one video card if I need that.

I've been following a need not want not philosophy to save money and
I figure when I finally do upgrade that I want do so economically and
effectively.  The sooner one upgrades, the less up to date they are.
This is an ongoing problem with computers.  I hate that computers have
become so disposable.

I wish I could take my computer science and start a new video card
company or convince Intel to improve their offerings.  If I were
to have a company, the philosophy would be, "we give the specs to 
anyone who wants to support our hardware on anything."  First things
first, I need to finish the 50 credit hours I have left.

Dan Shufelt changed his name to Dan Smith.  He is at this moment active 
duty ARMY in South Korea.
If you would like I can contact him and ask him to respond to one of you 
that is interested and he can give you whatever details he has about the 
LOCO.

  Was chatting with Dan on Facebook and he responded to the question of 
the LOCO...

It's no longer very active. I think they lack someone to organize events 
and such.
It takes a time commitment and no one seems to be up for the job presently.

I still have admin access to both the OregonTeam and PNWTeam loco 
assets. If someone wants to grab the torch and run with it then I will 
gladly give them the information and access they need.

  I ask your forbearance if this should have been in the technical

Has anyone here worked on a standalone ntp time server which uses GPS to 
obtain the clock signal?

The server would output the standard ethernet ntp protocol, but as a 
stratum 1 server.

Veracity LTD in the UK makes a small unit, but it is expensive.

this looks very attractive and can create a stratum 1 timeserver for a

Subject: [PLUG] Challenging Problem . . .
Message-ID: <4CB3ECE3.2010000@comcast.net>

  Situation: Client = Vista PC, NTFS file system; Server = CentOS 5.3 
serving CIFS shares (FYI: neither of these systems are current with all 
the latest patches and updates - customer preference).  Client has 
windows open on both systems and attempts to drag and drop files from 
server to local file system.  Seems to work on smaller files.  Files 
larger than about 3-5MB will stop transferring after about 10% of the 
file and hang.  Client times out, complains that it can't see the file 
on the server - the network connection to the server is lost.  Cannot 
ping server from client or client from server.  Cannot ping the router. 
   Run "ifconfig eth0 down"; "ifconfig eth0 up" on the server side and 
the network comes back.  Transfer failure is repeatable (usually) 
although sometimes it works.  Network is straightforward SOHO type - 
D-Link wireless router, Netgear switches, very light traffic.  I do not 
have a topology yet.

Approach:  Added my laptop (HP Pavilion dv6/Ubuntu 10.10) as a client 
and the problem persisted.  Same symptoms transferring files to/from the 
CentOS system.  Transfer would start, hang, time out, the network would 
crash and re-appear after bouncing the network on the server.

Connected the laptop directly to the server with only a Netgear switch 
(no router).  File transfers would NOT fail.  Could not reproduce the 
problem in this configuration. [aha, he said, it's in the network!]

(but wait)

Replaced server with the laptop, served files to PC via CIFS.  We would 
expect the laptop to fail just as the desktop CentOS system did (because 
we think it is a network problem).  Wrong - works perfectly.  Could not  
reproduce a failure in this configuration.  [Aha, he said, it's NOT the 
network]

Now what?

When I left my client this afternoon at 5PM, we were having success by 
using "copy and paste" instead of "drag and drop" on the PC.  WHAT?   
Why does this work?  We will continue to test this transfer process but 
I don't see why it would make any difference (but hey, it's Windows on 
the client).  Have not tried this approach using the Linux laptop as client.

Thoughts:  Could be some buggy condition in the server software 
somewhere (I suspect this because the system has not been updated but 
have no real reason).  Could be some issue with the CentOS drivers 
interacting with the network components.  I'm really saying that I have 
no clue.

Hence this post.
Looking for ideas, approaches, incantations, spells, band-aids, anything.

Thanks for listening,

Frank -

Look at the NIC on the Cent box and see if it starts incrementing
errors, check dmesg etc to see if there is anything obvious logged.
The copy and paste vs drag and drop is weird if the D-Link is in
place. I ran into a similar problem between Windows clients with a
wireless AP in place where one was connected to the AP via G and the
other via N and running wireshark (works on windows and linux woohoo)
and saw the buffers filling up causing the stall. This might be a
worthwhile route to go to ferret out the problem and see if you can
see a difference with the AP in place between drag and drop vs copy
and paste.

If the AP lets you, maybe check the WLAN interface for errors as well.

Drew,
Good ideas - I'll check with my client to see how much detective work he 
wants me to do.  If it is the server NIC, wouldn't I see the problem 
when directly connected to the client?

I'm thinking that I should:
1 - get every system to the current release and patch level
2 - minimize the network config, then if things work, add pieces one at 
a time until it breaks
3 - if that doesn't work, introduce liberal amounts of adult beverage

Subject: [PLUG] DVD volume name
Message-ID: <20101012181826.19bf5f8f@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I want long volume names when I burn a data DVD. K3b usually allows me
many characters if I specify "Linux/Unix filesystem only," but
sometimes not. And I can't find anywhere a specification for what
"Linux/Unix filesystem only" means - how many characters, what are the
prohibited characters, etc. For that matter I can't find what "Windows
compatibility" means either, although apparently it is fewer
characters. 

I usually use K3b, but it is buggy in this department. Once it gives me
an error it will continue to give me an error regardless of how few
characters I make the volume name. That is, until I reboot. Just
closing and restarting K3b does not resolve the issue. 

Brasero and Nautilus CD/DVD burning utilities allow fewer characters,
but again there appears to be zero documentation. Google is also not
helping.

Does anyone know what are the maximum possible number of characters for
a DVD volume name, and how to get them?

Subject: [PLUG] Question on Grub and fixing the MBR
Message-ID: <4CB539C7.2080900@gmail.com>

  I tried installing Ubuntu 10.10 maverick edition on an old system, but 
ran into trouble with the MBR and grub

I get the infamous grub error 17 which means that it cannot find the 
partition.

I have 4 disks, 2 scsi and 2 ide:

sda is ide 40 Gb   /home
sdb is ide 120 Gb /boot /swap /all others /backup
sdc is scsi 38 Gb /spare
sdd is scsi 18 Gb /dos /win98 /winbck

I tried running "grub-install /dev/sdb" command while running the Ubuntu 
CD live and that took.  I did set the boot flag on sdb3 partition (and 
sdd2).

But when I tried to run "update-grub > grub.cfg in the /boot/grub folder 
area, the command fails and says "cannot find /, dev mounted?"  But aufs 
is mounted as "/"

Of course, not having this fixed, I cannot boot the system.

Would using knoppix 6.2 to at least boot to a working OS do a better job?

I am not sure how to fix this problem, when the only working system is a 
live CD.  Has anyone had this problem and what did you do to fix it?

It almost certainly means use of the "Rock Ridge" extensions, which are a way
to express Unix style meta-data on top of the ISOFS format.

The Joliet extensions, at some compatibility level (there are three; I don't
know which is used by default.)

This has links to all the various bits:

Subject: [PLUG] Migrating from WinXP Pro to Ubuntu 10.10
Message-ID: <4CB52250.2@pcnetinc.com>

I suspect some answers are on www.pdxlinux.org, but I'm getting 
timeout errors.

I'm a senior citizen migrating to *nix whose last formal course 
work used 026's and line printers for I/O. My personal systems 
have progressed from CPM80 (Digital Research) thru Win 3.1 to 
WinXP Pro. Some of my personal preferences are shaped by that.

I have Ubuntu 10.10 up and running in test mode from a USB drive.

My first impression is that the default installation suffers from 
the same problems as Windows - trying to be "all things to all 
people" while NOT supplying some specific tools that I want.

Question 1.
While keeping the default configuration available, can I have a 
massively pruned configuration be my typical boot?

Question 2.
While browsing files available thru the default desktop, one 
seemed to say that internet access via an external RS-232 dial up 
modem was not available with standard drivers. BUT when browsing 
the descriptions of installed software it appeared that pppcfg 
(IIRC) handled that. I'm confused.

Question 2a.
I didn't spot any reference to firewalls or ant-virus tools. Is 
that accomplished in a different manner in the Linux world?

Question 3.
I wish to end up with
GUI         - exists
Open Office - exists
Tcl/Tk      - have appropriate executables on CD?
Scilab/SciosLab - will have to download
SeaMonkey   - have strong preference for the suite approach
dial-up access with firewall and virus protection - *HOW* ?

I'll leave the games,and sound/movie players as they will be 
occasional used and see minimal benefit to removing them.

Suggestions?
Am I on the appropriate list?
Recommended sites other than www.pdxlinux.org?
What are productive Google search terms?

Thank you.

That will let you configure dial up but there needs to be
drivers/modules for the actual hardware which may not be part of the
default install depending on your hardware.

IPTables is the firewall, it's part of the kernel. You can download a
GUI to configure it easier if you like. A/V can be handled by Clam AV
and I'm sure there are others.

Yes.  I set up a separate hard disk to boot everything from.  I created
an XP NTFS partition of 10 gig first and then a 100 meg I believe Linux
filesystem for grub.  The trick really is figuring out how to refer to
your drives the way grub sees them no matter what the bios does.  All
drives have to be connected and you may find a grub floppy useful.
Personally, I'd like to see grub improve a lot.  I see no reason why
grub shouldn't install as an OS on the second primary partition on the
first hard drive that is capable of detecting grub on other drives,
Windows, Freedos, etcetera.  I used the trick of copying kernels to
the new boot drive to simplify setting grub up.  Error 17 is pretty
darn common and incredibly annoying too ;-)

http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-general-1/grub-error-17-and-wont-reinstall-using-grub-install-337790/

Check your partition types to make sure something screwy isn't going on.
If your boot partition isn't of type Linux, that's trouble.

Also from a grub boot floppy assuming your boot drive is (hd0,0), do
approximately this...

grub>  setup (hd0,0)
grub>  root (hd0,0)
grub>  kernel (hd0,0)/vmlinuz root=/dev/hdax ro 
grub>  boot

BTW, Slackware 13 and above has grub as an option.  Multiple hard disks
if you run multiple OS'es is an awfully good idea.  Give Windows it's
own disk and give Linux another disk.  Also, consider another hard disk
to install grub to and set that grub up to boot everything.  I think
Slackware 13 and above install disks are the best way to go to fix a
boot loader.

Ubuntu doesn't try so much to be "all things to all people" as it tries
to support all hardware and provide GUI tools for configuration. That
does tend to take more resources.

While I generally recommend Ubuntu for beginners (because most things
"just work"), in your case I would suggest experimenting with other
distros. Some that come to mind that are leaner include Damn Small
Linux, Puppy Linux, and Lubuntu. 

You can't really boot to a "massively pruned configuration" yet have
the "default configuration" available. That is, you can boot to a slim
configuration, but adding the "default configuration" can't be done
with a simple mouse click.

I'll let others address this, as I have little experience with dial-up
modems under Linux.

>Question 2a.

Most distros install a default security system that, for most users,
requires little attention. I have been using Linux for four years, have
never installed anything special for security, have been connected 24/7
to the internet, and have never had a problem. On the other hand, I am
behind a router, not on dial-up. 

Also, be aware that viruses for Linux do exist, but are rare compared
to the Windows world. If you keep your distro up to date you should be
pretty well protected.

>Am I on the appropriate list?
>Recommended sites other than www.pdxlinux.org?

You are in the right place, although Google will turn up lots more
help. When using Ubuntu I strongly recommend the Ubuntu forums. Ubuntu
has more users than any other distro and tens of thousands participate
in its forums.

I can also suggest the PLUG Linux Clinic, which meets on the third
Sunday of every month from 1-5 at Free Geek. 1741 SE 10th Avenue,
Portland 97214. There are lots of gurus, plus we have distros, mice,
keyboards, monitors, and lots of other stuff. The next one will be
Sunday, October 17 (this Sunday).

And above all, welcome to Linux!

  Michael:

Tomorrow I will follow your guidelines.

I reinstalled Ubuntu again from the CD (had to turn off modeset in the 
boot parameters) and it took.

I told Ubuntu that the MBR was on sda which is hd0.

When Ubuntu told me to reboot the system, I removed the CD, watched it 
reboot

--->  -->  right into another grub error

This time it couldn't find the UUID (a big long string of alphanumerics) 
then dropped into
grub rescue>

but of course typing "help" and "quit" and "list"  was always met with 
"error"

Obviously the standard Ubuntu installer has only 1 hard disk on their 
system.

Regarding your question about running a stripped down default boot,
you can achieve this partially by running a non-default window manager
that isn't so heavy as Gnome or KDE's defaults.  I personally run
Debian on my systems (from which Ubuntu is derived) and use fluxbox as
my window manager.  It is possible to have multiple window managers
installed and to switch between them even at runtime, though it can be
tricky to get everything working right.

Yes, iptables for firewalling.  However, for a desktop I start by
running 'lsof -i -n', make sure nothing is listening externally that
shouldn't be, and then only bother with a firewall if you can't shut
something off that you don't trust.

Antivirus under Linux is pretty pointless, unless your goal is to run
a Linux mail/file server and protect your windows users.  The kinds of
evil code that will nail your Linux box (and yes, Linux is a big
target) won't be caught by A/V.  And don't run ClamAV.  It's had a
horrible history of vulnerbilities in its own code.  (Not that
commercial A/V hasn't as well...)

Subject: [PLUG] anybody got an Acer Aspire 4810T power adapter?
Message-ID: <8662x5dw1x.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


I've got a salvaged version of an Acer Aspire 4810T laptop, but the
power cable doesn't seem to be putting out juice.  In an case, plugged
in, it doesn't power on.  No sounds, no lights, no nuthin.  I wonder
if someone else with a working power adapter might be willing to meet
me somewhere mutually convenient and I can plug it in and see if
that's my problem.

If it's just a matter of spending $N on a power adapter to get another
working laptop, that might be worth it.  But spending $N on something
that remains a brick is less appealing.

While investigating the plug, I noticed that there are three
conductors in the cable.  A "signal" (so-labelled on the converter
board) wire runs down the center.  I don't know if the signaling goes
from the ac/dc brick to the laptop or from the laptop to the ac/dc
brick, neither or both.  Otherwise, it's center pin positive.  It's a
19V 4.32A adapter.

Thanks in advance!

I got a complete power adapter for my laptop from Free Geek for a
couple of bucks. Worth a phone call to see if they have one for your
Acer.

  I need a powerline (or wireless) ethernet transceiver pair.  Is the 
Aztech HL-105E any good? See 
http://www.modem-help.co.uk/Aztech/HL-105E-85Mb-Homeplug-Ethernet-Adaptor.html 
or Google it.

Are there better ones?

I live in an apartment and cannot touch the wiring at all, and cannot 
string ethernet cables from room to room. I have to connect a bridge to 
a wired wall port.

Any better ideas?

Message-ID: <20101015015841.GA3042@gate.kl-ic.com>

Sometime between 2 weeks ago and today, Wells Fargo online banking
stopped working with Firefox and my Linux system.  The page:

http://www.wellsfargo.com/help/wfonline/browsertest

reports "Your browser is: Default 7.6.4" and suggests I
upgrade it.  I get the same response from Linux and Firefox
3.5.5, 3.6.0, 3.6.9, and 3.6.10 .

Opera 10.10 works, reporting "Your browser is: Firefox 2.0.0"
Opera 10.63 works, reporting "Your browser is: Firefox 3.5.6"

Calling Wells Fargo and their webmail are both pretty useless.
Anybody else want to try?

Get a Powerline AV one. They are significantly faster, 200 Mbps vs 85
Mbps. They also seem to be more reliable with problem wiring.

The Powerline Ethernet adapters are bridges. They just have an
Ethernet port and a power plug. There is no problem working with Linux
or any other Ethernet device.

I have 3 Netgear Powerline AV adapters in my house. They work great
and are reliably faster than 802.11n.

I have a couple of Actiontec Megaplug AVs (200Mbps) bridging wireless
routers on our 2 floors, and they're great. I no longer have to jimmy
antennae when I'm on the wrong floor.

I have a Wells Fargo account and I access it constantly with Firefox
3.5.9 (currently) on my Fedora 11 x86_64 computer. Previously I used
earlier versions of Firefox on Fedora and Ubuntu. For years I have never
had a problem.

I go to:

https://online.wellsfargo.com/das/cgi-bin/session.cgi?sessargs=XQjRwib_pBO0gYgTb54EBeePpzn0Zou7

And click on "sign on again," then enter my username and pass. It has
always just worked. In fact, I did it just now.

I just tried with the link you provided.  It cheerfully informed
me that I was running Firefox 3.5.12, which indeed I am.  I'm
running Fedora 12 Linux, if that makes any difference (I doubt
that it does).

Thanks all for the verification that firefox works with Wells Fargo,
suggesting that I had some weird configuration problem.

I browsed about:config and found this item changed:

   general.useragent.override:  Quicktime 7.6.4

I reset it.  The string is now blank.

Now the Wells Fargo page works, reporting the expected:

   Your browser is: 	 Firefox 3.6.10

THe next mystery is what set that override, and whether something
is broken now that it is turned off.  More about this setting at
http://kb.mozillazine.org/Firefox_:_FAQs_:_About:config_Entries#General.

I recently (finally) upgraded our Jaunty Jackelope to Lucid Lynx. Until
the last two days, I haven't had to edit many OO documents. Now, I
notice that I have a specialized save/export to PDF menu that I haven't
seen in OO 3.1/3.0. 

What happened to the save/export menu that remembers my system
bookmarks and favorites? Any tips on getting it back?

Thanks.

Possibly naive question {snicker snicker ...}
I've now browsed enough to ask dangerous question(s).

I gather that when downloading a program, there are Linux 
utilities that simplify gathering everything required to run that 
program. Is there a site which allows choosing a base minimal 
distro and then asks which programs your wish to run. It would 
then check for dependencies and "put together an appropriate 
package"? I assume I'm totally abusing standard terminology, but 
you get my drift. I hope.

I suspect you need yet to figure out how distros, package management,
and repositories work.

"Packages" are programs and their dependencies.

"Repositories" are internet-based file servers containing packages and
their dependencies.

Every distro has its repositories. What packages the distro includes in
its repositories is determined by the powers that be in that distro,
following the philosophy of the distro. For example, some distros
refuse to include any packages that are not completely open source.
Such a distro will not make available (e.g.) Adobe Reader in its
repositories. Other distros (e.g. Ubuntu) make only open source
programs available by default, but make it easy for a user to add a
special repository containing non-open source programs. Part of your
decision as to which distro to use is whether you agree with their
philosophy.

In the Linux world there are two basic kinds of packages: RPM and
Debian. RPM = Redhat Package Manager. Debian was created by a husband
and wife team named Debbie and Ian (get it?). Ubuntu (and several other
distros) are Debian based. Packages end with .deb. Fedora and several
other distros are RPM based. Package files end with .rpm. And having
said that, there are distros that do their own thing as to package
management (e.g., Slackware). For a beginner I strongly recommend a
distro that is either Debian or RPM based. 

There are pages and pages of discussion on the net regarding which is
better, Debian or RPM. While they are different, in my estimation the
relative merits are pretty close to a toss-up.

Whether you install a Debian-based distro or an RPM-based distro, it
will come with a package manager. The package manager is a GUI that
displays all the packages available in the distro's repositories. You
simply select the package and the package manager automatically figures
out the required dependencies and handles the installation of the
package and its dependencies with a simple click of the mouse. No
thinking required.

If you wish you can also install packages from the command line, and
you can also install packages that are not in the distro's
repositories. But how that works I'll save for a future discussion.

If you want a non-bloaty base installation, you could try Debian.  It
lets you install with a minimum of packages to start with.  Then you
can add more as you need them.  However, Debian is not a particularly
hand-holding distribution.  So, your mileage may vary.  Ubuntu is
without doubt a friendlier place to start.  Stuff "Just Works" with
Ubuntu most of the time.  Debian requires a little more knowledge to
avoid cutting yourself on the edges.

I am mostly ignorant of the RPM based distributions, so that advice
comes with a FWIW.

Thank you John and Russell. With what you said and what I'm 
gathering from a thread on the Ubuntu users list I think desired 
effect is possible. Just not by route I was thinking of.

Someone pointed me to http://ubuntu-manual.org/ . Just downloaded 
it. Now for some 'lite' (or at least enlightening) reading.

I can't find the site right now but there is an online tool that let's
you create a custom package build CD/DVD based on Fedora or Ubuntu so
it contains only what you want.

If you want really stripped down you could always come to the dark
side and run NetBSD :)

==============================================

Talk descriptions:

"Spatial Analysis with R"

Ben will share some recent work he did using R for spatial data
visualization.  He will discuss how to read shapefiles and rasters
into R, how to join and process data related to those shapes, and how
to generate dynamic animated map products.

"R Therapy"

Do you have a problem that you are trying to solve with R that you
just can't get to work? A model you can't seem to specify? A graph you
can't tweak? A dataset you can't tame? An interface you can't bridge?
A bug you can't trap?  Well, try some group theRapy.

Bring your laptop, problem, and/or dataset and we will try to tackle
the problems you are having as a group. If there are multiple
problems, we can break into smaller groups. Don't have any current
unresolved problems of your own? Then maybe you can help someone else,
or at least learn from their problems before they are yours.

I would throw my .02 cents on Arch linux.  The documentation is excellent
and it starts you at a very base level.  It all depends on how "wet" you
want to get when jumping into the pool.
If you want an XP like experience (mostly) out of the box, stick with the
Ubuntus or the PCLinuxOS (or RPM equivalents CentOS or Fedora etc).  If you
would like to build your experience
then Arch is a great place to start, or the BSD's, or Slack or Gentoo.  I
would burn a few live CDs and muck about with each before jumping in.

I usually start installing Debian by installing the above mentioned minimum
system. At some point in the Debian installation it presents you with a menu
 so you can choose what to install. It has one thing checked by default. If
you uncheck that, it will install with a nice core set of applications that
will boot into console mode. Since you are probably comfortable with command
line type of work, you can work from there using apt-get install packagename
 to add whatever packages you want. apt-get takes care of the package
dependencies for you.  apt-cache search keyword will allow you to search the
packages to find the name of the one you want to install.  If you want to
move to a graphical environment you have several choices.  One of them is
the KDE desktop for which you can install a minimal components using apt-get
install kde-core.

Subject: [PLUG] udev 151 hates old IDE devices
Message-ID: <4CB9ED97.4070802@pippiandcarlos.com>

udev-151 no longer likes any IDE drivers located under the deprecated
"ATA/ATAPI/MFM/RLL support" of the kernel config. I have a production system
(a firewall) that requires the via82cxxx driver. Has anyone had success
substituting a driver under the "Serial ATA and Parallel ATA drivers" category?

Unfortunately the machine is located remotely, and it's in production use. I
cannot experiment on it ad hoc. And since it's a hardware driver issue, I
cannot test in a VM.

Does anyone else think it's a load of crap that udev is dropping support for
all these old IDE devices without having any clear upgrade path? I bought
this computer 2 years ago; it's not ancient.

Thanks,

Carlos

Subject: [PLUG] Compiling Buoh from source
Message-ID: <4CBA2710.1000502@comcast.net>

I'm trying to compile the Buoh comics reader from source on a machine 
with a pretty much stock Ubuntu 9 system. I downloaded and unarchived 
the source, read the install instructions and began with ./configure. I 
the following error messages:

No package 'glib-2.0' found
No package 'gtk+-2.0' found
No package 'libsoup-2.2' found
No package 'gconf-2.0' found

I opened up Synaptic and searched for glib-2, but didn't find it. The 
closest thing I find is libglib2-ruby, and some variants.

I searched for gtk+-2.0 and found a lot of things with gtk2 in them, but 
not gtk+-2.0.

I searched for libsoup-2.2 and found nothing.

I searched for gconf-2.0 and found a few things, but they didn't look 
like they were related.

I understand that the Buoh comics reader project was abandoned. I have 
it running, installed as a package, on my Ubuntu 8.4 machine. I'm 
working on upgrading to 10.10 and want to continue to use the comics 
reading tool. While I'm downloading the 10.10 iso image I thought I'd 
try this compile. I'd need to do it over again for 10.10, I assume.

Is this something that is going to be a major effort just to be able to 
assemble the tools needed to compile the old program, or is there 
another way to approach what I want to do?

TIA.

My HP Omnibook 6000 died yesterday.  Apparently the hard disk failed as

Salvage resellers are selling some refurbished IBM Thinkpad T41 and T42

at auction.  These systems have 1.6GHz Pentium M CPUs, 512MB of RAM and
20GB or 40GB hard drives, 14-inch SVGA 1024x768 screens, CD/DVD-writers

Is anyone running Linux successfully on one of these older IBM Thinkpad
models?  I'll be interested to hear about any experiences and problems.

I am not presently running one, but the T3*, T4*, and T6* models of ThinkPad
are all extremely well supported by Linux.  See http://www.thinkwiki.org/ for
the fine details and all.

I have seen several of these at PLUG meetings, and their reputation
with Linux is excellent.

More important, the Linux Thinkpad e-list had a very recent discussion
about the T41 and T42. The thread was started by someone wanting to buy
several of them from a salvage dealer, on eBay if I recall correctly.

I have a Thinkpad T42 that I like a lot, but if it's a hard disk
problem, couldn't you just get another hard disk?

My T42 has the 1400x1050 display, which I also like a lot.

Until my T41's fan died recently, I'd run both CentOS and Ubuntu on it 
with no real problems. I never used the modem, so I don't know whether 
it works under Linux or not. Power management was ok but not great.

Subject: [PLUG] Audio normalization / static removal in Linux
Message-ID: <AANLkTinGN3BfAJsB3cfoJYLnL6F0f4xhDo-kUncY-9Mf@mail.gmail.com>

I apologize for the tangential nature of this post, but I am hoping
for a linux-based solution and I don't know where else to ask right
now.

I have a video of a talk that is spattered with very loud,
ear-wrenching, bursts of static at random intervals.  There are quite
a few of these bursts (on average, probably one every 20-30 seconds),
and they are at least one order of magnitude louder than the important
audio.  It seems like it should be a simple matter to normalize the
volume so that it is possible to listen to the audio. I've come to
terms with the fact that the underlying audio is lost during these
bursts of static, but I would at least like to make it possible to
listen to the stream without blasting static randomly.

Does anyone know how to do this? I've stripped the audio and played
with it in audacity, but I don't know enough to make the options do
what needs done -- the best I've been able to do is to generate a
noise profile for a section of static, then use that to reduce the
static of each individual section.  This requires manually selecting
the portion of the audio wave that corresponds to the burst of static
and re-running the noise filter for *every* burst.  That simply
doesn't scale to the full length of the video--it would be easier to
simply re-record the talk (which would loose audience commentary,
etc...).

I would be very appreciative of any suggestions or pointers to audio
editing communities that may be able to help.  I also have a short
sample of the video I could share off-list if you'd like to take a
closer look.

Thanks!

Announcement: Portland Linux/Unix User Group Meeting
PLUG Advanced Topics for October 2010

Topic: Ubuntu Release Engineering by Allison Randal

Date and Time: Tuesday, October 19th, 7PM
Location: Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th Avenue


Ubuntu 10.10 arrived on 10/10/10 and work has already begun on Ubuntu
11.04, scheduled for April of 2011.

Allison Randal is the Technical Architect for Ubuntu at Canonical and
will give a tour of how a Ubuntu release transforms from a download from
kernel.org to a production-ready ISO that is ready to be downloaded by
millions of users around the world.

Allison will highlight how the Ubuntu community gets involved along the
way during the release process.

Calagator Link: http://calagator.org/events/1250459347

Food & Drink: At the last meeting we talked about having a Lucky Lab
menu and calling in an order. With their dinner rush beginning at 6PM,
you are welcome to call in and pay for your own order in the afternoon
and pick it up before the meeting. In short, bring whatever food you
wish. They can be found at:

Lucky Lab on Hawthorne
503-236-3555

I have no clue how to do this, but it sounds like a fun challenge.  If

Before you go too much further, I've had the same symptom due to the player
not being able to keep up with the framerate.  Is it any better if you
disable video output and/or use mplayer from the commandline?  How did you
strip out the audio for Audacity?

As for fixing the audio, you could run the whole talk through a compressor
or AGC in Audacity, or spend a couple hours manually scrubbing the
glitches.  Audio editing often involves a lot of drudgery and coffee.

The bursts of static have been observed in a few different players,
and on at least Linux and OS X.  They're also visible in the waveform,
so I'm convinced it's not a player issue.

I stripped the audio with ffmpeg:

$ ffmpeg -i video.m4v audio.wav

Oh.  I forgot that: pretty much no.  It is one of the nasty software modems,
so theoretically you can run the slmodem stuff, but I never got it to work,
and it never really kept up with the steady march of time.

(As you might expect from a binary blob from a vendor, of course.)

hi folks,

a little background. the system is a qnap turbostation i flashed debian
arm onto. just fidgeting around (i never learn better...) i install
blockcontrol and moblock, at which point i quit being able to mount nfs
share on the LAN (this despite having all LAN traffic whitelisted in
blockcontrol). i removed moblock and blockcontrol, rebooted, still not
able to mount nfs... so i tried rebooting nfs-kernel server, and i get:

a little further inspection shows:

I'm trying to upgrade from a Pentium 4 3.06 ghz system to a Quad Core
AMD Phenom system.  I'm upgrading from Fedora 12 i686 to Fedora 13
x86_64.  Okay, is there a way to support legacy software such as:
Dirk Dashing Secret Agent, Rick Rocket, Eschalon Book I, Eschalon Book

I'm running 2 2G DDR3 memory sticks operating at 1066 mhz, will 
getting faster memory, 1333 mhz, make a significant difference?
Anyone have experience with the overclocking features of the MSI
motherboard?

There is a way to run 32 bit software on a 64 bit platform???

If I can figure this out, I can retire my old system.

BTW: Where can I grab wine from?

Your fedora 64bit distro should have come with a selection of 32bit
libraries, enough to support the 32bit apps that they think you might
want to run.  If they missed some that your apps need, then you can
always get them with yum, as in:
           yum install libfoo.i386

Yes.  If they are statically linked they should just work.  If they
dynamically load libraries you will need to install the appropriate i386
packages to support them.

(I don't know about libc5 package availability though)

Probably not more than $20 or so worth of difference, I predict, for most
users.  It doesn't make much practical difference because memory performance
is usually not the root cause of desktop performance issues these days.

It does natively, and the upstream kernel ships with 32-bit compatibility, so
it should "just work" for you.  'yum install libfoo.i386' will do the IA-32
version of a package, if it is available.

> BTW: Where can I grab wine from?

The local bottle shop should carry a fine selection of ... *ahem* ;)

I used to use RPMForge, but I can't speak for them in the last few years.
Upstream have recommendations though: http://www.winehq.org/site/download

Enough muddling around with Audacity and ffmpeg turned up an
acceptable answer -- noise reduction (for background noise) and
compression (to reduce the peaks of the bursts of static) and the
audio is now something you can listen to without auditory agony ;)

Thanks for the suggestions! (Many of which came off-list.)

Subject: [PLUG] Firefox Version Matters After OS Upgrade
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1010200816450.32232@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I've asked about this issue on the Slackware mail list, but the one
responder had no insight or solution. I'm confident that the collective
wisdom and intelligence here can help me resolve the issue.

   My desktop and notebook both ran Slackware-12.2 with Firefox-3.0.19 (the
default version of firefox for that version of Slackware). I recently
upgraded both to Slackware-13.0 (2.6.29.6 kernel). The version of Firefox
included is -3.5.2, and there's a patched version, -3.6.10, distributed. The
problem is that neither version greater than -3.0.19 will run on either
host. I click on the icon (or try running /usr/bin/firefox or
/usr/lib/firefox-3.6.10/firefox-bin from the command line) and nothing
happens. Doesn't matter if it's -3.5.2 or -3.6.10.

   When I run 'ldd /usr/lib/firefox-3.6.10/firefox-bin' I see 2 libraries not
found on the notebook and three on the desktop (which are each listed
multiple times). From the desktop:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ ldd /usr/lib/firefox-3.6.10/firefox-bin
         libxul.so => not found
         libplc4.so => not found
         libnspr4.so => not found

   The remainder are found. Yet, when I look in /usr/lib/firefox-3.6.10/ I
see all these libraries:

libxul.so*
libnspr4.so*
libplc4.so*

   On the notebook I made symlinks to these from /usr/lib, but that made no
difference. And, when I downloaded firefox-3.0.19 and installed that rather
than the higher versions it loads and runs just fine.

   I'm stymied and puzzled. Two different hosts, two different processors,
same behaviors with all three firefox versions. How do I proceed to find out
what's broken so I can fix it?

TIA,

Rich

   Turns out this and other strange behaviors were all related to a failing
video/north bridge chip on the system board. It croaked totally Sunday
afternoon just after I finished upgrading the system to Slackware-13.3 and
tried rebooting. Turns out the failure also took out the new kernel modules
which made for much amusement here when I tried booting the system after
buying a new system board, CPU, memory, and (just for giggles) a new, small,
flat Antek Minuet 350 case.

   After re-installing Slackware-13.0 a few times, everything but firefox is
running. Soon I'll get up the courage to upgrade to -13.1 which changes all
the ATA drive designations from hd* to sd* and alters all the IDs of the
optical and supplemental (e.g., USB flash) drives.

I agree that is strange. I expect other Slackware users would have the same
difficulty if they had the same setup as you. You can use strace and/or
ltrace to see the full path to the libraries it's trying to load. It's
probably just looking for them in the wrong place, but something else could
be happening. Strace will tell you everything it's doing.

I agree that is strange. I expect other Slackware users would have the same
difficulty if they had the same setup as you. You can use strace and/or
ltrace to see the full path to the libraries it's trying to load. It's
probably just looking for them in the wrong place, but something else could
be happening. Strace will tell you everything it's doing.

   Here's another new experience for me. On the desktop after the OS upgrade
the mouse (trackball, actually) no longer cuts and pasts either in virtual
consoles or across windows. I've read the man page, the page on gpm in the
"Linux in a Nutshell" book, and tried Google searches ('linux gpm no
cut-and-paste' and similar) with no joy.

   I've also tried changing the mouse type from imps2 to ps2 but that makes
no difference. This is frustrating as using the device to transfer text both
within a single virtual console and between them is a task I perform dozens
of times each day.

   Suggestions, please.

   Update: it does work in consoles, so it's X related.

   Running xorg-server-1.6.3 here.

   Killed X and restarted it. Cut-and-paste now works again. It's been this
sort of computer week since Sunday afternoon.

Wes,

   Yup. But, I'm seeing the same problem on two totally different hardware
platforms so it's not host-specific as far as I can tell.

   I see things in the strace output that make no sense, but it comes down to
not finding those specific libraries. I'm also not proficient in
interpreting strace output:

   Why's firefox looking in wx and grass6.4 directories for libraries it
needs? Something's screwy here.

Who knows?

Try placing libxul.so in one of the places it's looking for and see if it
works.

Did you compile firefox yourself or use a pre-compiled binary?

It will look in lots of places, depending on your system
configuration.  Everything in /etc/ld.so.conf, for starters.

This outlines the search algorithm, to a degree:
http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/notes/rpath.html

It's not uncommon for apps to search all kinds of different
(nonsensical) places.   The aren't particularly smart about it.

If you know where the libraries are, you can add that path to
/etc/ld.so.conf (it's just a list of paths -- you may need to run
ldconfig after doing that... I'm not clear on the interactions), or
set LD_LIBRARY_PATH before running firefox, eg:

$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/firefox-3.6.10:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
/usr/lib/firefox-3.6.10/firefox-bin

If that works, then at least you know what the problem is.

It will look in lots of places, depending on your system
configuration.  Everything in /etc/ld.so.conf, for starters.

This outlines the search algorithm, to a degree:
http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/notes/rpath.html

It's not uncommon for apps to search all kinds of different
(nonsensical) places.   The aren't particularly smart about it.

If you know where the libraries are, you can add that path to
/etc/ld.so.conf (it's just a list of paths -- you may need to run
ldconfig after doing that... I'm not clear on the interactions), or
set LD_LIBRARY_PATH before running firefox, eg:

$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/firefox-3.6.10:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
/usr/lib/firefox-3.6.10/firefox-bin

If that works, then at least you know what the problem is.

   The latter: I use Slackware packages whenever possible; even build 'em my

Hi Rogan,

   It's the latter where it got the idea to look in wx and grass6.4, I
believe.

   Done. Strace showed a symbol error in what I assume is a javascript
script, so I downloaded another copy of 3.6.10, removed the existing 3.5.2
and 3.6.10 and re-installed the latter. Still get this error:

writev(2, [{"/usr/lib/firefox-3.6.10/firefox-b"..., 35}, {": "..., 2},
{"symbol lookup error"..., 19}, {": "..., 2}, {"/usr/lib/tls/libxul.so"...,
22}, {": "..., 2}, {"undefined symbol: js_GetterOnlyPr"..., 43}, {""..., 0},
{""..., 0}, {"\n"..., 1}], 10/usr/lib/firefox-3.6.10/firefox-bin: symbol
lookup error: /usr/lib/tls/libxul.so: undefined symbol:
js_GetterOnlyPropertyStub) = 126

   I'll see if someone on the Slackware maillist has ideas about this.

Thanks,

Rich

there used to be another fairly easy step you can take yourself--not a
speedy one though.

bash -c 'for i in `locate \*.so` do
nm $i | grep js_GetterOnlyPropertyStub && echo $i
done'

this is effectively grepping all the shared libs on your system for
the missing symbol.  if you find one that is defined, you could just
add it to $LD_PRELOAD to test to see if everything works ok.

however i just tried this (for the first time in 6-7 years, on any
system) on my ubuntu 10.4 system and found that they'd stripped all
the shared libs, so it doesn't work anymore.  space savings, but at
the cost of being able to examine your own plumbing.  sigh.  i'm
certain it saved a lot of space in the install image but there are
cases where one does not want every damn binary/library on the system
to be stripped.  sigh.  might work for you, Rich--slackware might do
it differently (if you run 'nm /usr/lib/tls/libxul.so' and it has a
lot of output, instead of saying 'no symbols', you might be in luck.
you're looking for a line starting with 't' or 'T' that has the
missing symbol from strace in it.  it won't me in libxul, that one
should start with a 'U' for undefined--the symbol is clearly not in
the library that cannot find the symbol, since it knows about its own
symbols at the bare minimum...

That looks like it's finding the wrong libxul.so.  look around at the
libxul so's that came with firefox and see if they define that symbol
(you can get the list of symbols from a shared lib. with 'nm').  My
guess is that the libxul in /usr/lib/tls is not the version you need
for firefox, but it's showning up in the LD search path first.  This
could be because you have some specific version of another package
installed that placed a libxul in /usr/lib/tls, or updated ld.so.conf
to point to that directory.

Did the LD_LIBRARY_PATH trick help at all?

Probably a good time to transition to the glorious new world of stable device
identifiers under /dev/disk, which saves you the pain of learning that "mostly
stable" doesn't count in the new hotplug order.

Rogan,

/usr/lib/tls/libxul.so
/usr/lib/firefox-3.6.10/libxul.so

and,

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 33 2010-10-20 11:25 /usr/lib/tls/libxul.so ->

   That's because I saw in the strace output /usr/lib/tls is where firefox
was looking for it so I put it there. Now, when I run ldd, there are _no_
missing libraries. But, an unfound symbol. Sigh.

   Another dead end:

[root at salmo /usr/src]# nm /usr/lib/firefox-3.6.10/libxul.so 
nm: /usr/lib/firefox-3.6.10/libxul.so: no symbols

   Nope.

   This is quite frustrating.

Thanks,

Apparently, there is no standard way to watch flash content on an x86_64
Linux distribution.  Adobe evidently has pulled their 64 bit flash
player, not the Windows version of course.  Anyone know of a good
workaround?  For how long is this likely to remain a problem?

This is why I stuck with my old Pentium 4 for so long.

I'm running Fedora 13 x86_64 where the 32 bit flash player doesn't seem
to work.

I wish an open source flash replacement would come out that works with
the boneheaded web sites that require adobe flash player.

   Another list member saw the problem when I posted the output of ldd. Turns
out that libsafe.so was left over from 2003 (obviously missed removing it
when it was put in the pasture) so that package and /etc/ld.so.preload were
the problem.

   I removed the package, the preload file, and now firefox-3.6.11 quickly
loads and runs.

   Whew!

Daniel,

   That will occur when I upgrade the server/workstation and notebook to
Slackware-13.1.

   In the meantime, that same corrupted directory showed up again today. I
cannot delete the entire directory tree in which it's located. I suspect
it's the old (80G WD) drive on its way out. Given the prices of hard drives,
I'll buy a replacement, format it, and move everything but that one
directory to the new drive.

Thanks,

Rich

While Adobe did suspend development for a while, they started up again
and released a new version of their 64-bit flash player for Linux less
than a month ago:
http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer10.html

As for the 32-bit version, have you tried following the steps listed
on the Fedora wiki for running it under x86_64?

Adobe has a new 64bit beta out called adobe square, and you just copy the .so to ~/.mozilla/plugins . It's worked really well for me for a while now.

This is why I stuck with my old Pentium 4 for so long.



I'm running Fedora 13 x86_64 where the 32 bit flash player doesn't seem

I wish an open source flash replacement would come out that works with

Ubuntu 10.10 64-bit comes with an Adobe player that works fine on both 
of my laptops in Firefox 3.5.x and the nightly builds of FF 4.0-beta. 
Flash content in the latest Chrome works fine also - it's actually a bit 
more stable than in Firefox.

The onlyFOSS implementation Ubuntu 10.10 includes in the standard repos 
is the woefully behind-the-spec Gnash.

Disclaimer: i willingly use closed-source software (and even pay for it) 
when i can't easily find a reliable FOSS solution. After all, i write 
software for a living.

Message-ID: <4CC0C558.5090301@cyber-office.net>

Anyone run into issues with SAMBA 3.0.33 (CentOS 5.5) and WinXP SP3 
running DOS based programs?

It is a long and tortuous tale to reach this point of woe so first I'll 
just give the symptoms.  When running tcpdump on the Linux box I see a 
bunch of "Unknown packet type" messages when a couple of DOS based 
programs try to start.  The programs, executables and data, reside on 
the server.

But other operations; connect to the server, access the drives, print, 
etc.; don't have errors.  Just the DOS programs.

The SAMBA configuration file is mostly unchanged from 7 or so years ago. 
A pretty simple set up: public folder/directory and print sharing via CUPS.

Any ideas, suggestions, clue-stick?

Others answered part of it, but let me point you at LightSpark, which is a
FOSS flash implementation.  It is far from complete, but gaining great ground,
and can deal with YouTube ... so a large proportion of what people actually
use flash for is working. :)

Your mplayerplugin files should be replaced every time you install an
updated version of the mplayer package. If you have backlevel versions
of those, they might cause problems. (On the other hand, some of them
might not have been changed, however you never know. Best update 'em.)

However, at least on the Mandriva that I've been using, those mplayer
files don't often change between releases.  The Java link has changed,
but the flashplayer plugin location doesn't, even when that's updated.

Here's what I've got in /usr/local/firefox/plugins :

When I update to a new release of firefox, I copy it all to ~./plugins
then copy it back. My firefox browser and all these plugins work great.

If Mandriva catches up (it has happened), then I just copy all that to
the plugins directory under the official location and delete the local
directory tree.

HTH,
Robert

   Thanks, Robert. I suppose then that I've not updated mplayer in a while so
nothing's changed.

Hi.

Has anyone used linux on a large scale among lower grades in the portland
area? I have a few specific questions areas of interest.

Do you know how PPS interacts with linux? I've been told that if the
district buys computers for the school then they also support those systems
to a degree, while if systems are donated or bought using PTA funds or any
other source, the school is on it's own to install/configure/maintain. I've
also been told that the support forthcoming is not so incredible that it
forms a strong incentive to stay with PPS provided systems (in other words
the bar is pretty low and likely to be pole vaulted by one or two involved
and knowledgable parent volenteers and a few easy to come by corporate
donation program grants).

ok second question: anyone tried edbuntu.etc?  Or is it better to install a
recent distro and LTSP and configure from scratch?  Target here is kind of:
make netboxes out of outdated hardware where:
 a. teachers and part time admins are sick of maintaining outdated versions
of the OS and the damn thing can't print or whatever
 b. not enough seats to go around so students go into the computer lab and
sit... and sit...

ok third question in this rambling chain: Anyone done this on one or two
hours of time investment a week?  I've got 6-8th graders, is it insane to
start contemplating a student run corner of the lab (or just insane to think
that would save time)?

Fourth question (longshot time) Odyssey program at hayhurst anyone? I'm on
the IT committee and surrounded by windows admins.  We also have someone who
is well connected for hardware donations for next year.  I'm kind of booked
up working on the website (and trying to have a life), but I'd start laying
groundwork if I wasn't pissing in the dark.... totally alone...

G'day Nathan.

Nope.  On the other hand, I can pass on some of what was found down here in
Australia when folks tried to do the same sort of thing, some lessons from
which might be valuable to your efforts too.

One thing to watch out for here: in Australia the license terms that the
schools ended up with (usually through a state-wide contract) for Microsoft
software were based on the number of machines in the place.  So, it often
ended up that they would pay for a Windows volume license even if they bought
in a Mac machine or ran Linux on the system.

It sounds like you have that covered here, but it might be worth
double-checking that PPS will not continue to bill them for "supporting" the
Linux machines, even if they don't lift a finger to actually do anything.

One of the hard lessons here was that this support could easily be beaten by a
small number of motivated, Linux-skilled folks, but that it was *really* hard
to get those Linux folks available on the timetable the school staff needed.

Being able to do a better job was useless if we couldn't deliver it on the
spot, when the machine was not working, during the school day.  You might need
to account for that when you think about what volunteer efforts apply.


One other thing to watch out for: here we ran into a surprising degree of
outright hostility from the folks who did the regular support stuff, even to
adding a new system to the network.

My guess is that they were basically just change-adverse, and saw anything
added as a risk that they might be asked to do more[1] even though they never
touched the machine.

For example, we had semi-regular objections that because the Linux systems
were not running the "standard" anti-virus software they would be a much
greater risk than Windows machines would - and because the department didn't
have the skills to do a security evaluation they couldn't certify anything we
did for use in the schools, because they couldn't know if it was secure or
not.


> ok second question: anyone tried edbuntu.etc?

Nope.

> Or is it better to install a recent distro and LTSP and configure from
> scratch?

This one I can answer, though: absolutely, without question, not.  There is an
enormously huge amount of hidden work in getting this sort of stuff working
smoothly, and you absolutely do *not* want to add that to the already huge
task of getting this system into the school and supporting it.

As a guide, at a previous job we quoted close to a year for producing a
locked-down environment that ran a dozen applications and had *no* persistent
storage other than email, in an LTSP-like environment, for use in a prison
situation.  (That was a fair estimate of actual effort, too.)

In that we were starting with the LTSP equivalent, and experience building
these things.  While there were some bits that would be easier in your case,
other bits would probably be more involved, so I wouldn't be surprised to
see a similar investment of effort required.

[...]

> ok third question in this rambling chain: Anyone done this on one or two
> hours of time investment a week?

I don't know, but based on commercial experience delivering similar
solutions, I wouldn't want to bet that it could be done in that sort of
timeframe.

Well, maybe that much *support* time after release, and when it was bedded
down, but you would have to budget for more support overhead every upgrade.

A couple of hours a week would hardly cover hardware problems in a large scale
environment, by the way - those kids can be ... challenging for the machines. :)

> I've got 6-8th graders, is it insane to start contemplating a student run
> corner of the lab (or just insane to think that would save time)?

Just the later, though at that age I don't know I would trust the judgement of
the kids if you gave them admin rights.  It ... opens the door to potential
abuse that I don't know I would want a hand in.


Anyway, I don't want to discourage you: I think this is an absolutely great
thing, and would love to see it happen.  I just don't want to see you assume
it is easy and find out the hard way just how much work it really is.

Regards,
        Daniel

Well it is solved.  Seems the full moon was the issue.  Well actually 
bad hardware.  A very old hub (so old it had a coax connector) was 
going/gone bad.  This along with trying to do an application update from 
a web page (http -> run) on a very slow connection.

Took the hub out of the loop, downloaded the update to the desktop, then 
applied it.  No more errors.

If you haven't met Eric Harrison(eharrison) or Dan Young(dyoung), you 
should.  They are both *long* time pluggers.  Eric, along with Paul 
Nelson, was the driving force behind the adoption of LTSP in the 
Riverdale school district.  Eric and Dan both work for the Multnomah 
Education Service District, which provides internet and other services 
to many school districts in Multnomah county.  I sure they could fill 
you in on the support structure, and more importantly, the politics of 
the various school districts.

Eric and Dan can sometimes be seen at the monthly meeting or at 
advanced topics.  To contact them directly, use mail.mesd.k12.or.us 
with the username in parens above.

Perhaps your default server is down, and dict is taking a long time for the
network connection attempt to time out?  Which server are you using?

Not recently, but I used to make much more extensive use of it years back, and
even ran my own local dictionary server for the purpose.

It works on my Fedora 13 x86_64 system, but not in full screen mode.

I would be running the proprietary Catalyst driver for my AMD video
card, but that seems to break everything.

If I try to turn off the emulate 800 x 600 option in wine configuration
I end up with a 1/3rd of the screen, the right half,
showing up on the left half of my screen.  Obviously, the game is
not playable when 2/3rds of the screen is off of the monitor.  
Anyone know how to fix this without resorting to the Catalyst
driver (breaks everything as far as I can tell).

Is there a hidden registry setting in wine or something else I can do
that will simply fix this?

Another question, what is the alternative for people using Wine to
turning selinux off?

dict.org appears to be down -- it's been this way for at least a day
or two (I noticed it wasn't working earlier this week, but I don't
recall when.) Googling also reveals that this is a widespread issue.

Adding the dict server you found to /etc/dictd/dict.conf, right after
localhost, made dict behave normally for me (modulo sending requests
to Denmark, but that doesn't concern me overmuch. :)

It *appears* that all three of the dict servers I had configured went
down at the same time -- that seems like a particularly poor choice of
defaults, but perhaps it's more complex than I realize.

Hello,

I will jump in.

I worked as a tech for PPS a couple years ago.
I asked the other techs what the district policy was on Linux, since I
wanted to perhaps help spread it if I could.
They run it on a few servers at the district office.  They do not really
support Linux at the schools, unless the school has someone on their own
staff who is willing to deal with it.
They also use (used to anyway, not sure if it is still the case, but very
likely it is) a hard drive imaging system that is based on OpenSuSE.
Their whole infrastructure is Novell Zen, so using Novell Linux (SuSE) makes
sense.

The imaging system is basically a small loader that can have a flag set
remotely (or locally if needed), and when it reboots, it pulls a new OS
image off the network, installs it, and reboots again into the fresh image
(Win2K and WinXP when I was there).  It is quite slick.  In some cases if
the network of a particular school isn't setup for the Zen stuff, a boot CD
and a USB hard drive can accomplish the same thing.  So most if not all
their Windows machines have a tiny sliver of Linux on them, though no one
really knows it ;).  If you run the settings option for the loader before it
boots into Windows, you can see the OpenSUSE gecko before it goes into the
menus.  :)

As far as actually running Linux as a regular OS, a few of the schools had
it when I was there, mainly a few labs that use LTSP for testing purposes
(as in students taking tests online).  A few schools that couldn't afford PC
refresh as often would use donated machines (FreeGeek usually), and just
leave Ubuntu on them.

So overall the official district position on it, when I was there at least,
was "we don't support it, but you can run it if you support it yourself".

As far as maintaining the machines, it is up to the techs to do that (as far
as hardware, or Windows issues), but if a machine is old and out of
warranty, it can be difficult to get it repaired if there isn't room in the
budget.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1010240939100.6872@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I need help from you folks administering Ubuntu systems. On my wife's
laptop only the wireless connections are seen (here and in the
neighborhood). The topmost portion, wired networks, says there aren't any
although I have an ethernet cable connecting the box to the local router.

   I tried running NetworkManager and was told it's already running. Next, I
tried 'lfconfig -a' and saw eth0 as well as lo and wlan0. When I ran
'ifup eth0' I saw 'Ignoring unknown interface eth0=eth0' which makes no
sense to me.

   What do I do to have the NetworkManager see the wired connection when a
cat5 cable is plugged in and all that interface to be used instead of the
wirelss one?

   More info:

   'lshw -C network' shows the Realtek chip for eth0 and all the other
details for the wired connection.

   'route -n' shows no routes.

   /etc/resolv.conf says "created by NetworkManager" but it's empty. I
suppose this is a good reason why the ethernet connection is not seen. I'll
try adding DNS addresses to it and add a default route.

   Xubuntu does not have a 'route' command. I'm told the usage is
'inet_route'. However, when I try that it comes back as 'inet_route: command
not found.' When I ask 'find / -name inet_fount' nothing is returned.

   Help needed.

Group

I am running CentOS 5, with current updates
I changed ISPs and have not been able to change the name servers using
system-control-network.
Currently I must manually update resolv.conf to get things working.

I have shutdown networking and restarted, I even have rebooted
but the changes in system-control-network do not show up in resolv.conf
My manual changes to resolv.conf get overwritten by the old values
that had been in system-control-network on reboot.

Any thought or suggestions ?

Thanks in advance.

Dear Rich, 

I find NetworkManager to be unreliable on Ubuntu -- I've replaced it on
my 10.04 system with wicd. 

In addition, the route command on 10.04 is part of the net-tools
package. Seems fundamental in the network troubleshooting process.

Thanks,
Mike

Mike,

   For whatever the reason, getting both wired and wireless networking going
on this host/OS is not working as expected.

   Here's the current situation:

   Wireless -- apparently my wireless access point doesn't want to connect to
the router now. I'll have to work on that later.

   Wired -- it doesn't want to see a wired connection when I edit
/etc/networks/interfaces. I'm still struggling with that one.

Thanks,

Rich

This sounds depressingly familiar.  :-(  I had this trouble
myself, though on a laptop running Fedora, rather than one of the
'buntus.  Oddly, it only affected the laptop, and not the
desktop, which was running the same version of Fedora and
NetworkManager.

Get into NetworkManager's preferences, and check IPv6 settings
for your wired interface.  Dollars to doughnuts it'll be set to
Automatic.  Set it to Ignore.  You may have to restart
NetworkManager.

The trouble seems to be that if you have NetworkManager set to
accept both IPv4 and IPv6 connections, it _requires_ both to be
running, or it won't see the interface.  If your router is IPv4
only (as mine is) then the IPv6 connection is never made, and the
interface never comes up.

Hope this helps.

Dale,

   Thank you. I'll give that a try. I didn't look at the IPv6 tab at all.

   Well, Dale, you can keep the doughnut, but the IPv6 settings are set to
Ignore by default.

Good idea, though,

The "eth0=eth0" part is because Debian[1] support mappings in their basic
network configuration, and in this case you are using the identity mapping
rather than "eth0=home" or whatever.  (Which is no surprise, because you have
not configured that magic. :)

Anyway, it means the interface is not configured in /etc/network/interfaces,
basically, though it wouldn't hurt to check the content there just in case.

(Er, just to check, you /did/ run that command as root, right?)

Typically nothing.  So, the question is why it isn't working:

What logs does NetworkManager emit?  You should find them in /var/log/syslog
or /var/log/daemon.log, and it would be good to have all the NM output when
you plug and unplug the cable.


Can your NIC actually see the connection?  The cheap way to check would be:

  sudo apt-get install ethtool
  sudo ethtool eth0

...with the cable plugged in, and see what it says.

Er, NM only establishes network *addresses*, and will never accept a network
connection with any protocol from anywhere.

Additionally, IPv6 will automatically configure a link-local network address
in the absence of any infrastructure, so unless you disable IPv6 in your
kernel entirely you would have an address found regardless of what your router
supports.


Now, you might have problems with other applications - that do make network
connections - if IPv6 is enabled, but that is not much to do with NM itself.

        Daniel

   I su'd to root and added the eth0 interface to /etc/network/interfaces,
after lo. It still does not see the network after a reboot.

   Yup. After 6 years with Red Hat I switched to Slackware 7 years ago and
I've become familiar and comfortable with its workings. When I assembled the
new system last Monday (with the old hard drives) there was no network
available. I read dmesg and saw that what had been eth0 on the old machine
was now eth1. I made those changes in /etc/rc.d/rc.inet.conf, restarted
inetd, and the network worked. I don't know Debian and its offspring, but
Xubuntu worked on her former laptop where Slackware had issues with the
wireless networking so I installed the same distribution on her new machine.
Since I'm not a professional SysAdmin I don't have the insights you pros do.

   No connection seen. I cannot ping the router ("Network not reachable") or
any other host.

Just so you know, if an interface is mentioned in /e/n/i then NM on Debian
will not touch it: it assumes the sysadmin had a good reason for doing
old-style configuration and trusts them.

So, if you have it in there you should remove it and ... restart NM.
Rebooting is the only way I know to do that which doesn't potentially break
other things.

hope is to help you, and I am sorry if it came across any other way. :)

The part I am most interested in is if the NIC has detected link, and what it
negotiated with the far end.  That will help rule out the problem being that
the NIC, the cable, or the router are "not working" here. :)

This sounds familiar.  I had the same problem some time back.  I
_think_ that I solved it by adding:
  PEERDNS=no
to /etc/sysconfig/networking/devices/ifcfg-eth0

The goal of Network Manager is to make networking invisible.  If it
can work and it figures out how, it Just Works, otherwise it Just
Gives Up.  My guess is that there is some physical or PEBKAC problem
that Network Manager can't compensate for.

In Ubuntu, if I am doing diagnosis, I just turn off Network Manager
like so:

  sudo stop network-manager

With Network Manager off:

  ip addr

which should give you some information about the interfaces known.

  dhclient <iface-name-of-your-ethernet>

and see what happens.

When I want to start Network Manager back up, I do:

  sudo start network-manager

i had trouble with unetbootin but it's another tool in the same vein
(and runs on windows/linux).  i never ended up troubleshooting initial
trouble, but it ran ok on another system, finally.  it'll do whatever
.iso you have, or it has native support for downloading a lot of
distros.  i only got the iso option to work.

however, it worked for both ubuntu and knoppix once i got it going.
and current knoppix by default has the persistent storage you seek.
it would be interesting to find out how to add that to
$arbitrary_distro, but i do not know how offhand.

sorry this isn't the most thorough, relevant answer, but perhaps it
gives you a new tree to bark up?

Subject: [PLUG] bash vs dash and the "at" command
Message-ID: <4CC5CC2A.4050208@frankhunt.com>

Does the "at" scheduler use bash or dash?

I have a shell script that runs just fine via cron or command line
It generates errors if run via "at" and does not complete
The errors seem to be related to the use of the "let" statement
My test script fails the same way from command line if I include #!/bin/dash
Runs fine with #!/bin/bash
This leads me to believe that the at scheduler uses dash no matter what 
is in the script file.
Of course trying to google for anything with "at" in the search string 
returns a zillion hits none of which
are relevant.

I am running Ubuntu 10.10

Here's the test script it generates a random number of hours between 24 
and 36 which is used in the real script at the offset to schedule itself 
again via "at":

#!/bin/bash
MAX=36
MIN=24
number_hours=0
while [ "$number_hours" -le $MIN ]
do
number_hours=$RANDOM
let "number_hours %= $MAX"
done
echo "number_hours=" $number_hours


Ideas??

Well, actually...  I seem to have described the problem I had
incorrectly.  My mistake, sorry. :-(  NM wanted to configure both
IPv4 and IPv6 networks for the interface.  When it couldn't, it
threw up its metaphorical hands in despair.  

I reported this (without knowing the cause) to Red Hat's Bugzilla
(<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=569024> if you're
interested).  Here's what they told me (the first line is a
quote from my log file):

I followed the directions, and voila! it worked.  I haven't had
any trouble with it since.  I will say that I don't use NM on my
desktop anymore; dhclient seems quite sufficient.  My laptop
still uses it, though, and it seems to work fine.  (Knock wood...)

Now that I think about it, it's quite likely that I managed to
disable IPv6 when I first set the laptop up.  I have some vague
recollection of something like that.  It's been a while, though.

mine (ubuntu 10.4 still) uses /bin/sh as documented in the first line
of the at(1) man page.  on my system, /bin/sh is linked to dash rather
than bash.  i believe there have been other conversations on here
about relinking /bin/sh to bash and how it breaks things, so that's
probably not a good fix.  plus, when run as 'sh', bash behaves like
its slower older brother posix bourne shell--see
http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-POSIX-Mode.html.


> Ideas??

a fine point of at(1) job submission that i just discovered from the
same man page, is that if you submit a file, it is treated as a list
of commands, run via /bin/sh.  if you submit from standard in, it will
instead just run the command, which if it is a script will obey your
opening shebang line.  i just tested that and it works fine (run: at
now +4 hours, type in the path to your script, hit control d, or just
"echo /path/to/script | at now +4 hours).  you can put the calculated
time specification into the command line that runs at, rather than in
the script itself, maybe?  i'd use expr(1) with date(1) to do it
rather than the shell builtin 'let'.  you could use date +%s to grab
number of seconds since the epoch as a source of a number that won't
be the same twice (unless you execute your script twice in one
second).

i guess another workaround is to submit a file that just has one line
that runs the other script (with the bash-specific shell functions in,
starting with #!/bin/bash), if you really must submit a file rather
than using stdin.

luck++;

I finally actually read the first part of the man page for at and found 
the reference to /bin/sh.
Duh.
I'll give the single line that calls the real script a try . . .
thanks.

looks like dash might not like things like 'let' and 'expr', but seems 
to prefer the expression without these?
possibly putting the expression within ()
only a guess, as I have never used dash ... have you tried this?

Since dash doesn't like the "let" command, I figured out how to generate 
my random numbers without using it.  Now dash is happy and my script 
runs under at.  Life is good.

   This may have something to do with those orphan files I am dealing with,
since it's come up only since those files appeared.

   Whenever I run 'find / -name ...' the last line returned is,

find: Warning: file `ask.c' appears to have mode 0000

   I cannot find any file named ask.c and I suspect that mode 0000 makes it
(virtually?) impossible to do so.

   I've not yet partitioned, formatted, and copied files from the two
existing drives to the new 500G/7200rpm WD Caviar Black, so this may
disappear when I do that and not copy the one directory on the old 80G hdb
that has the orphaned files.

   Has anyone knowledge of what that warning means and why it appears?

I wonder if "find / -exec stat {} \;" would find the file?

Perhaps the file was renamed bourne.c...

Carlos,

   If I'm doing this correctly (with ask.c after the -exec), then it's not
finding anything.

Fred,

   Yes:

[root at salmo ~]# chmod 666 ask.c
chmod: cannot access `ask.c': No such file or directory

   I believe the mode 0000 makes it untouchable. I'll bet that's the mode of
the other orphaned files, too.

   Must be the hard drive on its way out.

It doesn't (well, didn't, and shouldn't) break anything, but it does make lots
of things slower than they need to be.  Specifically because:

...this is true, so dash is strictly a subset of the capabilities of bash.

Actually, at(1) behaves the same way *given the same input* in both modes.

You are comparing apples and oranges; these are equivalent:

  ] echo /path/to/script | at now
  ] cat /tmp/foo
  /path/to/script
  ] at -f /tmp/foo now

So are these:

  ] at -f /path/to/script now
  ] cat /path/to/script | at now
    # UUOC: < /path/to/script at now # ;)

[...]

*nod*  That works, of course, because it is actually the same as your stdin
example.  :)

If that was true then find couldn't have told you which file it was; what is
presumably true is that it isn't trivial to locate it.  (What that says is the
individual file has that mode, but the directory that contains it does not,
for reference. :)

However, try 'locate ask.c' and see what that turns up.  Failing that, you can
use a very big hammer:

    find / -ls 2>&1 | fgrep ask.c

That should give you the full path to the troublesome file.

[...]

> [root at salmo ~]# chmod 666 ask.c
> chmod: cannot access `ask.c': No such file or directory

Nah, that just means you don't know the full path to it, and that find is
giving a less-than-helpful error message.  If you apply that to the file in
whatever location it actually exists you should get the right outcome.

I would guess that, or lingering damage from the same.

I highly encourage you to identify an adventurous staff member to
"sponsor" you and pursue this as an extra-curricular student activity.

Teachers have enormous demands on their time. Please respect that by
not asking them to context-switch unnecessarily.

Space in schools is often scarce. Labs require lots of the
aforementioned. Plan accordingly.

I have strong feelings about this topic; they are my feelings and not
my employer's. I sound grumpy here. I assure you, this is not the

The betas for flash just don't seem to work at all for me.
Lightspark is a beautiful concept, but not yet anything more than that.
I'm stuck using the proprietary Catalyst driver, come on AMD.
High end video cards for which there are open source drivers are going
to be more popular than cards that only work with closed source drivers.
Why has the video card market contracted so badly and why does NVIDIA
have a defacto monopoly at this point?  I am not happy with NVIDIA and
I'm sure I'm not alone.  The problem with keeping the specs closed is
that Microsoft gets an unfair advantage over Linux let alone other OSes
such as Syllable Desktop and Visopsys.

Daniel,

   I had tried locate yesterday; the find command returns the same results:
*task.c, *mask.c, *ask.cpp, etc. No plain ask.c.

Ack.  I should have been nicer and given you:

    find / -ls 2>&1 | egrep '\<ask\.c'

That would only match 'ask.c' rather than anything ending in ask.c, and would
have been much easier.  Sorry, I didn't even think of that 'til now. :)

I have been running the beta version of flash (64 bit) for about a
week on my laptop which has an ATI graphics chipset and on my desktop
with an nVidia chipset and had no problems.  In fact, I have only had
problems with the version of flash from the repositories.
What kind of issues are you having?

I am running Kubuntu 10.10 on all my systems and am considering
replacing my nVidia card with an ATI simply because they work so well.
 The open source Radeon driver seems to work quite well aside from
power saving features (which rules out the use of it on my laptop) so
I too am using the closed source fglrx driver.

I was going to send this directly to Russell Senior, but I decided 
others might be interested in this as well.

Periodically I receive promotional material from Qwest that states 
"Qwest High-Speed Internet customers receive free access to the 
Nation's Largest Wi-Fi Hot Spot network, powered by AT&T Wi-Fi."  Do 
you know if this works for people who use a third party ISP such as 
Spiritone?  Obviously finding free wifi in Portland isn't a problem, 
but this could be useful when traveling to 'less enlightened' parts of 
the country.

Hi Rich,

I think 'ask.c' used to exist on your system but is now living only in
the file descriptor tables. I suggest un-mounting the filesystem and
running a check on it.

When find "ends" with the error, by the way, it may simply be exiting
"all together." Reading the source code:

  http://www.mail-archive.com/findutils-patches at gnu.org/msg00395.html

I gather this to be a known bug with the earlier versions of find:

  http://www.mail-archive.com/bug-findutils at gnu.org/msg00996.html

The developers fixed the bug:

  http://www.mail-archive.com/bug-findutils at gnu.org/msg01694.html

Here's more detail:

I have tried to get flash working to no avail on my AMD Phenom II
system.  I suspect that either a) I need to use a 32 bit version of
firefox or b) this would work on an Intel based system.  I have tried
downloading the 64 bit beta libflashplayer.so and copying it
to /usr/lib64/mozilla/plugins.  I have tried installing 32 bit flash
through yum, though I suspect that will only work with a 32 bit version
of firefox.  I question the it just works answers I'm getting as that
just simply isn't what I'm experiencing.  I have even tried lightspark
and verified using about:plugins that it is installed, it doesn't work.
Rumor has it, 64 bit flash doesn't work in Windows 7 even.  I've
seriously thought about getting Windows 7 because my silicon HD HomeRun
tuner doesn't work either under Fedora 13 x86_64.  My pentium 4 system
running Fedora 12 supports both flash and my network based tuner just
fine, but I'm trying to retire that system.  Maybe I screwed up and
bought the wrong barebones kit.  This is the Vision barebones AMD kit
from TigerDirect with quad core AMD Phenom II processor.  I had to add a
terabyte SATA hard disk and 4 gigs of ram.  I also added a DVD burner.

It works for me doesn't help me at all.  I need instructions so I can
hopefully reproduce that experience.

At least my new system is working well enough to get this email out ;-)

1) download this file:
http://download.macromedia.com/pub/labs/flashplayer10/flashplayer_square_p2_64bit_linux_092710.tar.gz

2) extract libflashplayer.so to ~/.mozilla/plugins/

3) _restart_ firefox. check about:plugins and verify you've got
libflashplayer.so listed... 

4) go watch some youtube.

Thoughts:

yeah, flash on linux sucks. after a lot of griping from the community,
adobe seems to be moving (albeit glacially) toward remedying that. due
to their inconsistency about keeping these functional demos available,
i've started mirroring them every time i see one. 

bad thing about using the beta is that it's probably full of security
holes, and if you manually install the plugin, you need to make sure to
watch for updates, as it won't be coming through your repo or mozilla's
plugin updater. we linux users are spoiled like that.

holler if _exactly_ following those steps doesn't work. i've tested this
on several operating system on several computers and had zero issues
with it.

cheers,

nathan

Fascinating result here, youtube works but hulu doesn't.  Hunh, that's
curious.  When I try to stream anything on hulu, I just get a blank
screen.  Any thoughts on how long it is going to take before flash
works with hulu on 64 bit systems?

I don't what to expect if I go ahead with Windows 7, apparently the
problems are the same.  I hope the lightspark project takes off,
lots of web sites require flash where this has become a defacto
standard.

So Spiritone customers would not be eligible.

I am pretty sure this is just qwest.net ISP customers.  But of course,
on the principal goals of advertising is to confuse and disorient
consumers, so it worded with maximum ambiguity.

It would be interesting to call them up to ask and hear what kind of
pitch you got, just from a "communications studies" point of view, and
it would have the side effect of resolving the ambiguity.

I don't watch too much Hulu, but I know they're very specific about what
versions of flash they let video content out to. back when i /was/
watching Hulu, i know they'd blocked the older flash version after adobe
released an update. i would suspect that's the root issue more than a
malfunction of flash player.

Had not tried that before.  Same result (blank area where the video
should be) with the Hulu website.  The odd part is that the Hulu
Desktop application works great.

Some friends of mine have a 64-bit system running Windows 7.  
64-bit Flash doesn't work for them.  That's only one data point, 
though; I don't know about anyone else.

> It works for me doesn't help me at all.  I need instructions so

I've been running 32-bit Flash with 64-bit Firefox for some
time.  The method is a bit arcane, but once set up, you don't
need to worry about it.  I found it on the fedoraproject.org web
site.

<http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Flash>  

That is a good page to check, and is where I got most the 
following:

Basically, you get your Yum repo data from Adobe's web site (the
"Yum for download" selection).  When it's done, you should have a
file "adobe-linux-i386.repo" in your /etc/yum.repos.d directory.
Now the fun starts.  32-bit Flash has to be run via
nspluginwrapper, so you have to install it.

The first command will automatically pull in the 32-bit version
of libstdc++ and a bunch of other stuff.  (Note that you can do 
this before getting the Adobe yum repo information.  If you do, 
the '--disablerepo' option isn't needed.)  The second command 
pulls in the actual Flash plugin.  

(The first command is wrapped at the "\", to keep it from being 
mangled by mail agents of evil.)

su -c 'yum install nspluginwrapper.{x86_64,i386) \
 alsa-plugins-pulseaudio.i686 --disablerepo=adobe-linux-i386'
su -c 'yum install flash-plugin'

Once that's done, restart Firefox if it was running, and enter
'about:plugins' in the browser's address bar.  Firefox should tell
you that Flash is installed.

After that, you will get any updates to (32-bit) Flash whenever
Adobe releases them.

I can't help you with Hulu, I'm afraid.  I tried it here a couple
of months ago; watched a couple episodes of "The Dresden Files" 
and had no trouble.

This might be a long shot, and the Phenom II should have it, but do you have
LAHF support on that CPU?  For a while Flash 10 would generate the LAHF
instructions but some early AMD CPUs didn't support them, so crash-city.

If 'grep -i lahf /proc/cpuinfo' outputs content then that isn't the problem.

(I bet it isn't the cause, but when I hit this we had success on most YouTube
 content, but pretty much nothing else, so it sounded all similar and all.)

Maybe Apple will win and replace it with HTML5. ;)

Well, looks like I have LAHF instructions.  Thanks for the tip though.
Oddly enough, the hulu desktop app works where firefox 64 bit with 64
bit flash doesn't.  Hunh.  I kinda jumped through the EULA on hulu
desktop where it looks like it might be somewhat worrisome.  Some rumors
persist googling around about hulu problems that hulu is trying to
change to a pay model.  I was a bit reluctant to try hulu desktop, but I
can vouch for it working.  Why doesn't standard firefox work?

"NOT TECHNICAL, CONCERNS AND OPINIONS ARE BELOW THIS LINE"

I'm wondering if there is a hulu alternative?  I'm concerned that hulu
will collect statistics on people who use it and I don't approve of
easy access to "adult" movies.  Watching these movies might constitute
voting for them.  Morally, I don't want to encourage the production of
new "adult" films.  Hulu is a nice outlet for catching more general
audience shows and movies, but the shows available don't stop there.
These "adult" movies aren't generally entertaining in my opinion, though
they are addictive.

I like Stargate Universe sometimes, but there have been a lot of sex
scenes and they just ruin it IMO.  I think Stargate Universe is almost a
border case.  The show isn't plot dependent on people having sex, though
it comes close.  Imagine you work and your boss knows that you watched
Stargate Universe or worse HOTS, American Virgin, (insert sexually
explicit movie available through hulu here).  Now imagine that this boss
is ultra conservative and has to form an opinion when a sexual
harassment allegation surfaces against you.  Somehow, I don't think your
viewing choices on hulu replete with sexual immorality will help your
case.  I'm all for television being more interesting and possibly better
for us, but I have major privacy and other ethical concerns regarding
interactive television.

As far as alternatives, I'm interested in a service that limits access
to R rated and "Mature" or "Adult" films.  I think a phone call to an
actual human being should be the minimum requirement to watch R rated
films online.  Hulu doesn't even seem to have a filtering option that
will drop "Adult" films from the title listings.  Concerning privacy, I
guess renting movies is safer than streaming them.  I prefer
a service that is of course Linux friendly and I value privacy, so I
want the service provider to refrain from giving out records of what I
stream.  Records should be destroyed in 6 months or sooner.

I think the decency laws should be updated to restrict streaming of
copyrighted films that are R rated or "Adult" films.  At the very least,
you should be required to request them verbally from an actual human
being and verify your age.  I'm sure a lot of us would be reluctant to
verbally ask for an R rated or "Adult" film whereas hulu allows people
to watch them almost anonymously.  People can lie about their age when
they sign up for a hulu account, what's to stop them?  As far as hulu
recommending "adult" material because a lot of people view those shows
and movies...  I don't agree with that.  The pushing of societal decay
in one segment on another segment is just wrong.  

We are all sheep that need to be shepherded sometimes, not thrown to the
wolves.  To an extent an individual looks out for him/herself, but we
need each other at some point.  Decency should be promoted society wide,
not ignored in the name of free speech.  Hulu trusts people to be honest
about their age and advertises "adult" media regardless of the potential
viewer's values.  Wanting to watch something because you are hormonal is
very different from deciding that something fits your values and is
appropriate viewing material.  I prefer the latter over the former.

I suspect it would increase the ambiguity as the script reading sales

   This is very interesting. I'm moving directories from the older, and
presumably failing, 80G drive to the newer 160G drive prior to moving
everything to the new 500G drive. When I moved one directory (for a rather
outdated GRASS-6.4 build) I saw this:

[rshepard at salmo /usr4]$ mv grass64/ /data1/gis/
mv: `grass64/imagery/i.points/ask.c' has unknown file type
mv: `grass64/imagery/i.points/find.c' has unknown file type
mv: `grass64/imagery/i.points/where.c' has unknown file type

   When I look at that new directory those files do not show up. But, I can
delete the entire directory tree (which will be replaced by the current svn
version later today).

   I'll bet those had mode 0000.

   I want to restore the vfat/32 file system to a 1G USB flash drive on which
I had put memtest86. Repartitioning with fdisk works, but there is no
mkfs.vfat on my system. The mkfs man page includes mkfs.vfat (8) in the 'see
also' section, but there is no man page in section 8 for that flavor.

   Any ideas? Can this be saved or do I toss it and buy another one?

Do you need Windows compatibility on the flash drive? If not, just restore
the files from the VFAT partition onto an EXT partition.

If yes, format the flash drive on the Windows machine, then restore the
files on your linux system.

As for how to get mkfs.vfat - google tells me this is also known as
"mkdosfs" which is part of the "dosfstools" package, at least on Debian.
YMMV.

Wes,

   To the extent that I use the drive to exchange files with clients and
colleages running Windows, yes.

   Not available.

   I have the dosfstools package installed. Thank you for teaching me that
the executable is called "mkdosfs".

   Does it matter what partition is formatted as swap on a drive? On my new

/dev/sda1 the swap, /dev/sda2 will be /, and /dev/sda3 will be /tmp. I'm

I've even had swap partitions on other drives, with no apparent ill effects. But 
I'd rather not "bless" your present arrangement and then have something go 
wrong, so I'm hoping others will weigh in.

Actually, I almost always put swap first as you have it, since the
beginning of most hard drives are slightly faster than the end.  Of
course that's increasingly becoming moot... You never want to use swap
on a regular basis these days, except maybe for hibernation.  For
instance I don't even create swap on VMs anymore.  Better to just
overcommit and let the host OS do any swapping if it comes to that.

Actually, I almost always put swap first as you have it, since the
beginning of most hard drives are slightly faster than the end.  Of
course that's increasingly becoming moot... You never want to use swap
on a regular basis these days, except maybe for hibernation.  For
instance I don't even create swap on VMs anymore.  Better to just
overcommit and let the host OS do any swapping if it comes to that.

I would vote for option 3.
/dev/sda1 = /
/dev/sda2 = /tmp
/dev/sda3 = swap

My thinking is that the root partition is the most frequently used and you
want it in the fastest part of the drive.  The /tmp directory is used
frequently so you want that in the second fastest part of the drive.
Lastly, you should hope to never need to use the swap partition except for
hibernation so put it in the slowest part of the drive.

Two other points...
1) Where are you mounting your /home partition?
2) You might want to think about forgoing the swap partition but create a
swap file on the / folder.  This is usually a bit slower, but being in a
faster area of the drive and the flexability it gives you might be worth the
tradeoff.  Besides, if you find space getting tight in your / folder, you
can just remove the swapfile if you find you are not using it, to get a bit
of emergency breathing room.

Jason,

   I was thinking of that and that with 4G RAM the swap partition may not be
used that frequently.

   In /, no longer a separate partition.

   It's a 500G/7200RPM SATA2 drive. I currently have 138G of files on the
older 160G drive so I doubt that I'll be running out of room any time soon.

   What prompted my thinking about moving swap was always before booting from
hda1; this would make it sda2 and while it probably makes no difference, it
would mean I might inadvertently screw things up some time in the future.

Thanks to all of you for responding,

Hello,

Just to add in my experience with Hulu on 64bit Linux (Fedora 12 and earlier
in my case, running on AMD Athlon 64 dual core).
Hulu website would not work, but Hulu Desktop app worked on and off, it had
some issues of freezing, then not being able to play.
It is a known issue that Hulu seems to be dragging its feet on, it is a
matter of configuration on their end, not a technical limitation as far as I
can see, since Hulu does work on 32bit Linux web browsers, and Hulu Desktop
works on 64bit Linux.  I saw a thread on this on their support forums, I
will have to see if I can dig it up.

----------------------

Now as for the rest of your comments- I think what you are proposing, having
people call in somewhere to access their "adult" entertainment, seems to be
a rather longshot from a business perspective, as well as from the
perspective of getting the customers to agree to such measures.  To access
this type of "content" on cable or satellite, you just have to pay for it,
and provide proof you are over 18.  You don't require your customers to call
some customer service rep every time they want to watch their "adult"
content.  That seems rather onerous.

As for the internet, there are tons of nanny filters available if you have
children accessing your computer, and there are adult verification methods
(usually involving verification with credit card) for major adult websites.
Granted you can access some content without verification if you just know
what search terms to use on your favorite search engine, again this can be
mitigated with the right kind of limitations and software (Safe Mode on
Google for instance), and just not typing in certain search terms if you are
dealing with just yourself.

While I may agree from a moral standpoint on adult content issue, from a
practical standpoint, people on the internet in general are vehemently
opposed to overly restrictive rules on content.  Also from an open source
philosophy of freedom, it would seem best to let people choose for
themselves what content they want to access (assuming the age issue is
already taken care of), not have the choice forced upon them.  If you don't
want to see such content, don't go there.  No one is forcing you to pick a
certain website or section on Hulu or etc.

Just my $0.02

Thank you for the recommendation.  

I would like to be able to watch shows from on air channels though as
well.  OPB comes to mind.  Most of the time PG-13 material will be
fairly okay.  It's the level of sexually explicit material I object to
in some of hulu's media choices.  Sabrina for example is a nice movie
that involves romance, and it doesn't particularly bother 
me.  I'm not looking for everything G, I just don't believe a site
should make more than a certain level of sexual material easy to 
access.  I'll get tired of Disney pretty fast.  I like a good science
fiction, it's just the level of sexually explicit material in Stargate
Universe that I object to.  This material makes the show addictive as
opposed to making it enjoyable.  The series Enterprise failed because of
sexual material.  I wish the writers for these series would figure out
that sexual material can ruin a show.  Finding quality entertainment is
becoming difficult.  

I for one am interested in technological advances where interactive
television involving say fuel cell technology would intrigue me.  The
problems with interactive television are numerous though.

I'm not opposed to a site that offers a diverse selection of media, I
just want material on the higher end of the sexual spectrum to be more
restricted and harder to find.  My second concern is privacy, I don't
want to look bad to a boss or get bombarded by UCE spam.  Adults don't
want to watch kids tv necessarily, but getting a steady diet of hard
core material (relatively speaking) isn't good.  Being turned on by a
spouse is superior to being turned on by a show IMO, but I'm single
meaning that that isn't available for me.

Disciplining oneself to leave certain media alone in this information
age seems harder than the challenges faced by people before the
Internet.  I see this as a reality that needs to be addressed at some
point.  Standards established for decency on broadcast television are
antiquated in an era of Internet television, satellite, and widespread
cable use.  Tools like OpenDNS can help, if you can't bypass them.
OpenDNS doesn't help with hulu though and sites like it.  I'd recommend
openDNS and Linux to a business owner perhaps, but it's not enough.
Scanning images for sexual content isn't practical, so what is the
answer?  I think the answer involves discipline, but how does one
discipline him/herself in this information age?  I think this is a
question for sociologists and psychiatrists.

Linux is very powerful for use as a filter, but filtering media seems to
be an intractable problem from a technical standpoint.  Where community
opinions concerning people going to certain establishments historically
might have helped, nobody sees what you do in private online
necessarily.  Portland I understand is especially bad when it comes to
production of "Adult" material and the number of "Adult" establishments.
There is a statistic that half of all teenagers view sexually explicit
material frequently.  I don't see those habits going away automatically
in adulthood.  I guess either a Opendns should have a way of blocking
hulu access or b one must resort to a local domain blacklist.  Blocking
hulu is an extreme answer, after all, some hulu shows aren't sexual at
all.  I wish ISPs would step up and offer to help their customers solve
the problem of how do you block sexually explicit material and learn to
discpline yourself adequately?

I strongly recommend that you put the currently external drive into its
final working place before installing the OS. Then, attach the drives with
the data you want to migrate to the new drive as external drives.

Wes,

   I was thinking of doing this. My adapter will accept a 2.5" (laptop) IDE
drive, a 3.5" optical drive, or any SATA drive, but no 3.5" IDE drive. Of
course, I'll have all the data on the backup drive and can restore from
there, too.

   This will probably need to wait for the weekend. Tonight I'll rum
memtest86 on the new memory and see if that's the cause of the problems I've
had since I built this new system. (Of course, the failed motherboard might
have affected the hard drives, too, and the new installation would fix
that.)

Thanks,

Rich

Wes,

   There's probably no difference. I read the printed labels by each port
while I'm trying to do three other things. The obvious sometime slips past
me.

   Just in case there are hd issues, I think I'd be wise to use the external
backup drive (written by dirvish) to restore files.

Subject: [PLUG] Linux Foundation announces the Yocto Project
Message-ID: <4CC8A691.3050002@zenlinux.com>

Hello,

I thought I'd share some noteworthy news in the embedded Linux space.

Today the Yocto Project was announced at the Consumer Electronics Linux 
Forum (CELF) conference. This is an effort to help promote and 
contribute to existing open source projects (Poky/OpenEmbedded), which 
are build systems for developing customized Linux distros for embedded 
devices.

A common problem for companies trying to create embedded Linux products 
is that every time they need to use a new hardware platform for a 
product, developers need to learn and/or workaround idiosyncracies of 
the hardware vendor-supplied Linux distro. An important goal of the 
Yocto Project is to provide a flexible and standardized system to allow 
companies to create their own embedded Linux distros that they can use 
across a range of of hardware devices.

Board vendors will also appreciate that the Yocto Project defines a 
standard way of creating Board Support Packages (BSPs) for their 
embedded products.

The Yocto Project is a community effort under the Linux Foundation's 
umbrella, and it supports all major hardware architectures - not just 
x86, but also arm, mips, ppc, and even x86-64 are supported equally.

A good overview of the Yocto Project was posted on Linux for Devices today:

http://www.linuxfordevices.com/c/a/News/Linux-Foundation-Yocto-Project/

and of course you can learn more at the project's home page:

http://yoctoproject.org

A number of folks (including myself) from Intel's Hillsboro location 
have been working on this effort (as well as from other sites). We 
welcome and encourage participation in the project. There's some really 
exciting stuff going on right in our backyard when it comes to embedded 
Linux.

Scott

Indeed, there is no difference. Your adapter will work with all of your hard

Subject: [PLUG] a long involved question on const behavior of a C++ class
	object
Message-ID: <4CC8DA1F.5080804@gmail.com>

Technical and long involved question here involving C++ class behavior, 
please skip for non C++ gurus

This is a question about invoking class methods from const class objects 
without the compiler complaining about ignoring the const qualifier and 
throwing an error.

----------- start program main.cpp -----------
1 | #include <iostream>
2 | #include "ui256.hpp"
3 |
4 | using namespace std;
5 |
6 | int main()
7 | {
8 | const ui256 a(7);
9 | ui256 b(-7);
10 | unsigned int i = 8;
11 | int j = -6;
12 |
13 | cout << "a = " << a << endl;
14 | cout << "i = " << i << endl;
15 | cout << "j = " << j << endl;
16 | cout << endl;
17 | cout << "a + i = " << a << " + " << i << " = " << a+i << endl;
18 | cout << "a - j = " << a << " - " << j << " = " << a-j << endl;
19 | cout << "b + i = " << b << " + " << i << " = " << b+i << endl;
20 |
21 | return 0;
22 | }
----------------- end program -----------------
ui256.hpp and ui256.cpp contain the class ui256 and its methods.

$ g++ -o main main.cpp ui256.cpp -ggdb
main.cpp: In function ?int main()?:
main.cpp:17: error: passing ?const ui256? as ?this? argument of ?ui256 
ui256::operator+(const ui256&)? discards qualifiers
main.cpp:18: error: passing ?const ui256? as ?this? argument of ?ui256 
ui256::operator-(const ui256&)? discards qualifiers

The operator + is defined as

ui256 operator+(const ui256& rhs);

The compiler complains that the const ui256 a(7) object invoking the + 
operator disregards the const since the operator is working on a 
non-const class (temporary) which is true.

If I change the operator to:

ui256 operator+(ui256& rhs);

then the compiler complains that

main.cpp:17: error: no match for ?operator+? in ?a + i?

which is true, there isn't any function signature match to const a in 
this case.

So how is an operator+ for a const object defined?

For the subtraction in line #18, I wrote an outside the class operator 
and the compiler complains about ambiguity, since it is trying to coerce 
a native type to the class type then apply the class operator.

ui256.cpp: In function ?ui256 operator-(const ui256&, int)?:
ui256.cpp:1632: warning: ISO C++ says that these are ambiguous, even 
though the worst conversion for the first is better than the worst 
conversion for the second:
ui256.cpp:1629: note: candidate 1: ui256 operator-(const ui256&, int)
ui256.hpp:127: note: candidate 2: ui256 ui256::operator-(const ui256&)

I just need some way of creating temporaries from constants which invoke 
non-const class methods without the compiler complaining about tossing 
aside the const when using it.

Any ideas of what I am doing wrong here and how to really fix the problem?

-Randall

Hi

I copied this from Wikipedia


    * "Short Stroking", which aims to minimize performance-eating head
repositioning delays by reducing the number of tracks used per hard
drive.[1]  The basic idea is that you make one partition approx.
20-25% of the total size of the drive. This partition is expected to:
occupy the outer tracks of the hard drive, and offer more than double
the throughput ? less than half the access time. If you limit capacity
with short stroking, the minimum throughput stays much closer to the
maximum.

        * For example a 1 TB disk might have an access time of 12 ms
at 200 IOPS (at a limited queue depth) with an average throughput of
100 MB/s. When it is partitioned to 100 GB (and the rest left
unallocated) you might end up with an access time of 6 ms at 300 IOPS
(with a bigger queue depth) with an average throughput of 200 MB/s..



Good luck

Marvin

Read the last paragraph first.

OpenDNS does a great job of blocking certain web sites when asked to,
but hulu is not one of them.  Hulu is carrying some hard core
material.  

It isn't practical under Linux or any other system currently available
to filter media for sexually explicit scenes.  People say just leave it
alone, and I'm sure there are millions of people who want to that simply
can't.  I'd say I do fairly well, but putting filters on your own
computers that are imperfect at best is only so effective.  ISPs won't
filter for people generally, something I'd like to see change.  Hulu is
a weird case because you can also watch Benji and practically anything
else that is on over the air television.  

The community protection that used to exist because you had to go to 
a seedy establishment on the corner which was in plain sight is gone.
There is very little risk of being seen as going against community
values if you are on the Internet in relative privacy.

As far as require credit card verification of people's age to view hard
core material.  Well, that says that people should pay for it which
will encourage the industry behind that material to grow.  That could
mean more sexual slavery and exploitation world wide.  I'm opposed to
the notion that something is okay as long as you have to pay for it.
Another problem, involving credit cards with "adult" material increases
fraud cases as many people are too embarrassed to fight back when a
media company specializing in porn places illegal charges.

Community is valuable where one could argue that the Internet is
elevating private living over community life.  A mailing list offers
some semblance of community, but just some.  I'd say self discipline is
part of the what to do answer, but self discipline alone when there is
ubiquitous discrete access to hard core sexual material is tough.  
Self discipline alone on a large scale even won't stop the "Adult
entertainment" industry from expanding.  Something more is needed.
The decency laws need to be updated for broadcast media and like it or
not, requiring people to call before they can acquire "adult" materials
could help millions.  You can't get it without being seen should
probably be restored.

Why is alcoholism recognized by people, but sexual addiction is not?
Part of being an addict is trying to hide your problem from other people
where the Internet has made all kinds of addiction easier.

I realize there are legitimate concerns about invasion of privacy to
address a problem that many people do not recognize as existing.
Concerns aside, the statistic that 1 in 2 teenagers frequently watch
sexually explicit media is alarming.  Addictions tend to persist, so it
would be curious to find out how many porn addicts there are that are
adults now.

What is the best way to address side cases like Hulu that OpenDNS 
with the decency settings set to high doesn't help with?  This is 
the technical problem that I hope people will discuss.

I think it is always better (if possible) to use the same partition
scheme on all computers that I build.  It doesn't really matter what
that scheme is, consistency is what works over the long run. 

For your piece of mind, I almost always have a swap partition at the
beginning of the drive, it has never caused any boot problems.

I would suggest you use LVM instead, but I have no idea how hard or easy
Slackware make it to do that.  (The flexibility benefits, especially if you
leave some of the VG unallocated, pay off quickly in future.)

This only works if you want to throw away the rest of the disk, or you have
data stored there that is essentially never accessed.  Otherwise you lose any
benefit because reads and writes to the other partitions will eat those gains.

Pay money for the service, run outside your home.  In Australia almost every
major ISP could offer the facility, and they were generally based on one of
the big commercial services who offered filtering of communication.

This is the only mechanism that will actually prevent access to the material
with assurances of success[1], because there is no way to bypass it without
seeking another connection to the Internet.[2]


The next best thing is to obtain one of the range of consumer routers that
provide the facility as a commercial service[3], or to install
http://dansguardian.org/ and use either there commercial or free feeds.

(Effectiveness depends, in many ways, on how much you pay for the list to be
 supported, which is probably no surprise to anyone.)


(SoothWall worked well for a former client of mine who used it, some years
 back, but I have no current experience.)


Finally, you could use the OpenDNS service and run a Squid or equivalent web
proxy, and maintain the blacklist yourself.  If they are almost totally
effective this might be a low enough maintenance cost that you can accept it.

        Daniel

Well, you could also use the inverse: produce a whitelist of approved sites.
Watch out for things like Wikipedia that include sometimes objected to content
along with their otherwise valuable stuff.


Footnotes: 
[1]  ...but don't forget to check those T&C to see how much the service care
     about over-blocking or under-blocking sites, and what recourse you have
     when you and they don't agree about something.

[2]  Which, naturally, is a significant problem when it comes to preventing
     kids from getting access to this stuff - at least generally.  I have no
     idea if you have kids, or it would be a problem with them, so am only
     speaking generally here. :)

[3]  Netgear did, a while back, and I know someone who was happy with their
     implementation.

Subject: [PLUG] fixed const objects problem
Message-ID: <4CC8F8E9.6070409@gmail.com>

To all:

After some careful reading,  it became obvious to me that I was going to 
have to implement a slew of two parameter functions that took a const 
object as the first member, in order to deal with the const problem.

One person writes:

Adding the keyword const to the end of a member function's prototype 
tells the compiler:

    I promise not to modify the object which calls me (directly or
    indirectly), and therefore I may be called by const objects. 

And adding this const to the member functions which contained a class 
reference fixed the other problems.

I have to say that the class file has grown enormously and I still 
haven't finished with the arithmetic functions yet.

I can see why writing overload operators is such a tedious task.

Randall

P.S. So consider the problem now solved.

Overall, why do you want just one partition for everything?  There are
good reasons to partition separate logical drives for different roles.

I agree that you shouldn't need to use a swap partition.  I have a few
on various disks but seldom see them in use.  I put other disks first.

However, I might offer some further comments on partitioning, if I may.

First, unless you're running a web and/or database server that makes a
lot of use of /tmp for static files, relational query results sets, or
whatever, you shouldn't need a physical /tmp partition at all.  Use an
entry in /etc/fstab instead to create an in-memory /tmp at every boot:

none /tmp tmpfs defaults 0 0

I happen to have a physical /tmp partition on this desktop system just
because it has got a ridiculous amount of hard disk space for my needs
and, with an Apache instance and Mysql plus a load of ordinary desktop
applications, it's just 79MB in size, a snip if you've got GBs of RAM.

Sure, something could run amok filling up your in-core /tmp partition,
locking up your system, but I do not recall that ever happening to me.

Second, why don't you want to have a separate /home partition?  That's a
good idea for backups, scrubbing deleted files, and carrying forward
your user configuration over software upgrades.  Having your own /home
partition keeps a lot of disk activity separate from your system files
in the root partition and applications software which resides in /usr.

Speaking of which, having a separate /usr partition seems like a great
idea to me, too.  The stuff in the root "/" partition doesn't change a
lot with distro updates, but /usr gets a lot of activity over time, if
you accept the software upgrades the better distros put out regularly.

A /usr partition is a good idea, too.  The hint is in the above advice
regarding the relative levels of activity between software partitions.

You can force things like Adobe Reader and Google Earth to install on
/usr with the link command (assuming there's nothing already in /opt):

ln -sf /usr/local /opt

It's also a good idea, I think, to have a separate /var partition, as
that gets a lot of activity, too.  I also have a /boot partition just to
be able mark it read-only if I get paranoid, but that's a bit much.

Here's what I've got at the moment:

Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda6             433M  211M  200M  52% /
/dev/sda14             21G  6.3G   13G  33% /data
/dev/sda5              61M   28M   30M  49% /boot
/dev/sda7             1.5G  929M  577M  62% /home
/dev/sda11            4.0G   79M  3.7G   3% /tmp
/dev/sda10            5.0G  3.6G  1.2G  76% /usr
/dev/sda9             2.5G  167M  2.2G   7% /var
/dev/sda12             20G  194M   19G   2% /var/lib/mysql
/dev/sda13             20G  216M   19G   2% /var/www

Yes, I use all logical drives, defined in a secondary partition table.

However, do whatever seems right to you, of course.  And, best wishes.

HTTH,
Robert

I hope you will take this the right way, but it doesn't sound like you are
entirely clear on what you are trying to do: parts of that seem unconnected to
the discussion at hand, and other parts are ... well, "inefficient", to say
the least.

...only because you are dedicated to not using a proxy, which means that you
are working very hard to make this more difficult for yourself.

(Also, are you aware that bypassing the OpenDNS stuff would be trivial in most
 cases, unless you are otherwise blocking access to other resolvers?)

Yes, but why would you do that?  If you want to blacklist or whitelist[2] then
just do that with a static iptables ruleset - and refresh the DNS resolution
periodically to ensure it doesn't drift on you.

(Given most of what you want to block are commercial operations that should
 be a fairly rare problem.)

> What is the best way to do this?

Use a proxy.  Seriously.  Failing that, use the firewall to REJECT packets to
the places you don't want them to go.

...or you could just block access with iptables, or use a proxy which will do
this all for you, for free, and *vastly* more effectively.

Give a DNS name to the source or destination address passed to iptables, and
it will do a lookup at the time the rule is created.

Using OpenDNS is somewhat pointless if you don't block other resolvers.
Ideally, my ISP would only permit access to the OpenDNS servers, but
that isn't going to happen anytime soon.  So one is stuck running their
own firewall and one has to leave that intact, where it can be tempting
not to at times.  Yes, if you can bypass your firewall or turn it off,
it is trivial to use another resolver.

I'm concerned about using a proxy because I have seen sites break and I
have fairly slow servers.  It will be a while before I can even consider
fixing the slow issue.

I frankly see OpenDNS as possibly being superior to Dansguardian.  When
it comes to media though, sites like hulu which show "adult" material
are hard to filter out.  Some "adult" sites are recognized by OpenDNS
and are blocked, but hulu is borderline and it gets allowed.  Where
there is hulu, there are certainly other sites like it that mix "adult"
and family friendly media with a very low barrier to access "adult"
material.  OpenDNS is community driven and fairly effective, but one
can't expect OpenDNS to block sites like hulu.  The local store is a
good low tech example of this problem of the benign being mixed with 
the extreme.  Magazine racks in convenience stores are notorious.

I have some idea of what I want, I just don't see how a proxy fits into
the picture.

Technological approaches to filtering web content aside, one can't count
on filtering alone to limit what is accessed online.  This is a social
problem that demands a social answer.  Decency laws need to be updated
somehow and frankly I'd like to see society's attitude about sex and
sexual advertisements change.  I'm tired of the Viagra, Cialis, Levitra,
etcetera ads.  Men who really are impotent need a drug, but most men
aren't impotent.  I don't agree with the notion that a drug can improve
sex, but that's another issue entirely.  I don't care for the Max birth
control ads either, in fact they offend me deeply.  Understanding
addiction better might help.  Finding media that fits my values which
isn't meant for kids wouldn't hurt either.  It is tough when you want
entertainment and it is hard to find any to leave the less appropriate
media that is easily accessed alone.  I fear that society is decaying
morally which will lead to this problem becoming more acute for people.

Derek,

   When I first partitioned a hard drive for linux in 1997 I read many
suggestions that multiple partitions were better than one contiguous /
partition. Now I've been told that the speed of current SATA drives makes
the difference moot. Frankly, I don't care one way or the other.

   My current partition scheme is this:

/dev/hda3        swap
/dev/hda1        / 
/dev/hda10       /tmp
/dev/hda11       /vm 
/dev/hda12       /data1
/dev/hda13       /data2
/dev/hda2        /boot 
/dev/hda5        /home 
/dev/hda6        /usr 
/dev/hda7        /usr/local
/dev/hda8        /opt 
/dev/hda9        /var

   I am open to keeping it this way, using only /, /tmp, and swap, or any
other alternative.

   Perhaps we should run a poll? :-) Seriously, I'm not committed to any
particular scheme and I'm not a professional SysAdmin or linux guru so all
advice is welcome.

   With 4G RAM on a host used by only me (and processes such as postfix),
even the most data intensive spatial analyses or similar processes should
run in that space. So, swap comes out.

   I am not currently running an external web server and postgres stores its
data in /var/lib/pgsql/data/. However, alpine stores sent mail backups in
/tmp and that's where SlackBuild scripts do their work. On average, the 1G
/tmp partition is about 45% used. With the new drive's 500G capacity a /tmp
partition won't take up significant room.

   You probably saw the current partitioning scheme I posted.

   You and Derek suggest that I stay with the same (or very similar) scheme
that I've been using. Makes sense to me, so that's what I'll do (without the
swap, however, even though 8M won't be noticed on the drive).

Thanks,

Rich

Hi

I think that would be fun..    .......

Let me start...

I am a firm believer in a separate /home partition..  Wouldn't give
that up for anything.

Other things I like to see.

/boot
/usr
/tmp
/var
/swap
/home

There it is..


Thanks

Marvin

The problem with this sort of partition scheme is the wasted disk space.
Each and every partition will have empty space that can not be accessed
easily by other partitions (you can get creative with sim-links, but it
get messy).  There are two reasons that I can think of for multiple
partitions, placement of the partition on the faster part of the drive
and containment of a run-away process.  For these reasons, I compromise
by limiting the number of partitions to 4.  Swap and / go at the
beginning of the drive where it is supposed to be fastest, /var gets its
own partition to contain run-away log files or nasty overflowing
in-boxes, and the rest of the drive is for /home.  If you make the /
partition about 40 Gigs, there will be plenty of room for /tmp.  The
size of /var depends on the machines function, smaller for workstation,
larger for email server.

I am rather partial to having several / partitions for installing
separate distributions. That way I can boot into another installation
if I am having trouble. My partitioning scheme looks like this.

/boot    100MB
/      (32 bit debian) 20GB
/      (64 bit debian)  20GB
/      (spare used for testing or clean installations) 20GB
/home    (rest of the disk)

There is no swap, but I would throw in a 4GB swap partition if I did
it again. It is amazing how quickly you can fill up 4GB ram, how did I
ever get buy on 640K? So I think a bit of swap can come in handy
whether it's a dedicated partition or just a swap file in some other
partition.

   Everyone who commented offered reasonable and useful insights. We all have
different needs from our systems so it makes sense for a variety of
partitioning schema to be used.

   To close this thread I'll submit what I decided would work well for me:

/dev/sda1	/
/dev/sda2	/boot
/dev/sda3	swap
/dev/sda5	/home
/dev/sda6	/usr
/dev/sda7	/opt
/dev/sda8	/var
/dev/sda9	/tmp

   This will also force me to re-organize all _my_ contents in a more
productive way. With a nominal 500G on the new drive and my current space
occupancy of 138G there's plenty of expansion room. If I should ever need
more space (gak!!) the cost of multi-terabyte drives will probably be <$100.

Thanks again for all your comments,

Rich

   I never before noticed that when mkfs.ext3 is used on a partition it
returns the frequency at which the filesystem will be checked. And it's
different for each one. Is this related to partition/filesystem size?

Just curious as I wait for filesystems to be created,

tune2fs -c lets you adjust the number of mounts between fsks.

Carlos,

   I realize this but am curious why the defaults are so different. What I
saw here was:

/dev/sda1	  1G	21 mounts
/dev/sda2	100M	20 mounts
/dev/sda5	200G	37 mounts
/dev/sda6	100G	28 mounts
/dev/sda7	195G	35 mounts
/dev/sda8	  5G	27 mounts
/dev/sda9	  4G	37 mounts

   Seems almost random.

I have no real information about how this works, but I will address your
comment that it's "random" - the only one that does not follow a size->time
progression is the 4G partition. I have no explanation for this, except that
it's the last one. I wonder if you used the same syntax in your command to
create each one?

If you sort by number of mounts between fscks:

/dev/sda2          100M    20 mounts
/dev/sda1         1000M    21 mounts
/dev/sda8         5000M    27 mounts
/dev/sda6       100000M    28 mounts
/dev/sda7       195000M    35 mounts
/dev/sda5       200000M    37 mounts
/dev/sda9         4000M    37 mounts

Wes,

   I recongnized this. The last one is the oddball; perhaps because i's last.

> I wonder if you used the same syntax in your command to create each one?

   Yup: 'mkfs.ext3 /dev/sd[1,2,5,6,7,8,9]', pressing the up-arrow key and
incrementing the last number. Used 'mkswap /dev/sda3' on that one.

   Just an interesting observation.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <AANLkTimOyFB4ZqFqPQz_0qf93QGvg6qOt=V_STtgxZNP@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I need some way to interact with a POSIX message queue from PHP. I am
already aware that the PHP library provides for manipulation of Sys V style
queues (msg_get_queue(), etc.), but I cannot change the queue. I am hoping
to accomplish this capability in a portable way, avoiding external
dependencies if possible. So far, these are two solutions I have thought of:

* Build a PHP extension which exposes these functions.
* Build a set of wrapper binaries that can be called via shell_exec() or
shell()

For performance reasons, the second is nearly a non-option. Is, then, the
first option the only way to go about this?

Thank you,
Jameson Williams

I tend to put the partitions which will likely change the least first 
and those I might change, resize, repartition last.

I tend to set them up anticipating booting multiple O/S and/or reserving 
a partition for installing the "next" version.

/dev/sda1  boot or diagnostic
/dev/sda2 swap
/dev/sda3 ntfs (if I have to have a Windows)
/dev/sda4
/dev/sda5 /
/dev/sda6 reserved for / next version
/dev/sda7 /data

I put /data last because it is then easier to resize it to grow the / 
partitions and/or carve out another partition should I need to.

All,

Anyone have any steps to upgrade the kernel on redhat 7.

up2date is not working, so I'm going to have to go the manual route. In
later versions I know I had to do some funky things, but not sure about
redhat 7. Is it the regular process of pulling the vanilla down from the
kernel archives?

How new of a kernel do you want to go?  Changing kernels to something
newer can break the API on various
applications.

Use the Red Hat public archives to find a kernel source package that
fits your needs and compile it.

As in the Red Hat version released and updated from 2000 through 2003?

Red Hat 7.3, which was the last 7.x release, ran the 2.4.18 kernel. 
You can probably build and run the latest 2.4 kernel release 
(2.4.37.10) if you have access to the .config file used to build the 
Red Hat kernel.

Red Hat's kernels were often highly patched, however, so it wouldn't 
surprise me to discover that some bit of functionality is missing when 
you build a stock kernel.

I've got to build a sybase 12- server on redhat 7. ASE requires 2.4.9 or
greater though.

I built a redhat 7.2, but maybe should do a 7.3 as that seems to be the
easier route.

Why are you using a Linux distrobution that has not been supported for 5+ 
years?

I like your idea of having a partition dedicated to testing/upgrading.

Last week I bought an Intel X25-g2 Solid State Drive (Which is simply
amazing!) so I had to reconfigure my partitioning scheme for my home PC.
Here is what I came up with...

/dev/sda1 = / (20GB)
/dev/sda2 = /home (140GB)
/dev/sdb1 = Bulk storage (~1.5TB)
/dev/sdb2 = Swap (8GB at the end of the drive)

/tmp is set up as RAMFS in order to minimize wear on my SSD

For testing new OSs, I have always used either a Virtual Machine or I have a
SATA removable drive bay that accepts bare drives and I have a old 250GB
drive I toss in there and install to.  I just set it at a higher boot
priority in my BIOS so if it's installed at boot, it will be booted from.

I highly recommend having a dedicated /home partition.  It makes upgrades a
snap and a nice consistent feel between OS versions.

Just my $.03 worth (adjusted for current economy)

It is, within limits: the purpose is to keep them from *all* being checked at
the same time, but rather to spread that out a little bit more across time.

It means more frequent, but shorter, delays at boot caused by fsck.

Daniel,

   That makes sense, especially with a huge drive.

Subject: [PLUG] erratic website loads
Message-ID: <AANLkTim24+EdXezOqktYqNrC=kkYXBsR+x+wSZkBGCW+@mail.gmail.com>

Using Google Chrome I often have the message at the bottom left "waiting for
www.<site name>, yet the lights on my DSL modem indicate no traffic.  The
"X" shown on the top line indicates that a new site is being sought/loaded.
 After waiting for a minute or so in this state, I click on the "X" and then
click on the reload arrow which replaces the "X".  Often the new page loads
immediately.  It is as if there are multiple paths to the site, and I get a
blocked path on first try.

Question:

Does this indicate a problem with my ISP, a problem with Chrome, or
something else?  Is there any kind of a fix?

Thanks,
-Denis

Redhat 7.x was a good run.  It is 2.4.x based which seems ancient, but
Sybase 12 may require ancient kernels.  So, should the old Sybase
software be abandoned because the Linux kernel and C libraries have
changed?  Linux may change less in the future than it has in the past,
which I hope will be the case.  The API changes over time pose a real
problem as there are still among the vendors that support Linux a number
that don't offer open source software.  This closed source software
which can be very popular is not fixable.  Some minor examples are the
Nvidia and Catalyst video card drivers, but there are other examples as
well.  I'm sure the Linux kernel developers are trying to provide a more
consistent API over time, but it may be too early for that.

Shouldn't you identify if Sybase 12 runs on a modern system before asking that
question?

...this is a problem with the internal API / ABI of the kernel, *NOT* with the
interface between applications and the kernel.  That ABI is fanatically
protected and compatible, by upstream design.

Those are apples and porcupines you are comparing there.

No, they are not.  Wait, yes they are!  Both!  The "binary blob device driver"
API/ABI is by design not going to become stable.

The userland interface of the kernel is fanatically so, and you should be fine
running your Sybase 12 system on the latest release of anything - provided you
supply all the dynamic libraries that are required.

Regards,
        Daniel

If it was, say, Sybase 12 for SCO run through the Linux ABI project then you
would have trouble as /that/ has not been maintained. :)

I ran a Squid proxy on a 486-SX at 33MHz.  Your server is *not* going to
have a problem with it.

...but wait!  Dansguardian with the publicly curated blocklist and content

I don't believe the behavior described is specific to chrome, and I have 
been told it is a problem with the target server, or possibly some part 
of the path in between ... in any case, it most probably (but not 
necessarily) has to do with something being overloaded.
That is all guess work of course, and may be of not use to you

Subject: [PLUG] redhat 7.3
Message-ID: <1288362620.1540.8.camel@blackswan.fiddlers-green.info>

All,

I've been attempting to get redhat 7.3 installed for a day now, and I
keep getting errors after inserting disk2. Initially it was with the
xscreensaver package, and so I've removed X from the packages to
install. Now I'm getting an issue installing ypbind. It tells me this is
due to missing file, bad package, or bad media.

I downloaded the media from
ftp://archive.download.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/7.3/en/iso/ and
verified all three iso files. I looked on google but to no avail.

Does anybody have any suggestions on how I can get this installed? 7.2
installed fine, but the kernel is too old to drop Sybase ASE 12.5 on. It
seemed like installing 7.3 would be easier than upgrading the kernel on
7.2.


thanks,

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1010290827001.23304@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I've searched with Google but despite headings that imply how to find the
UUID of a specific device, the page contents do not really tell me how to do
this.

   In /etc/fstab the entry for my external backup disk is

UUID=436bc83a-1d2b-4c58-b3a9-5dbe8efc4112  /media/hd0  ext3  defaults 0 0

   The past couple of mornings I see a mail message that the dirvish backup
could not unmount the drive. When I tried from the command line this morning
the attempt failed because the UUID did not match what the kernel saw.
Turning off the drive, and back on about a hour later allowed me to umount
the drive.

   How do I determine the UUID for devices such as this external drive? I've
tried 'vol_id', but 'vol_id -u /media/hd0' responds that it's an unknown or
unique media type and I see the same response if I use --uuid as the option
to vol_id.

   A clue stick is needed.

Maybe this is the truth, disc 2 is bad. You say you checked the iso,
but did you check the disk after you burned the iso?

These vmware instructions

for Redhat 7.3 suggest using the text mode installation.  This
probably applies to kvm also.

I use 'blkid' that is part of the util-linux package on Debian, I don't
have a vol_id here.

Could the problem be that you've changed your external drive to vfat?

I just tried a USB stick formatted with vfat, at first 'blkid' didn't
report any information for it (maybe blkid is using a cache, or maybe
it's ignoring vfat partitions), but then ran 'blkid -p /dev/sdg1'
("low-level probe") and it reported the UUID and other attributes just
fine and mysteriously, subsequently running just 'blkid' now reports the
data.

   Huh! I did not know this tool existed. It's here, too, on Slackware.
Running just 'bklid' with no dev specified found all partitions and returned
the UUID and filesystem type.

   Kewel!

Thanks, Gerald,

Subject: [PLUG] What Controls Mouse Clipboard in X Window?
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1010291443420.29208@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Does anyone know the library or tool that controls cutting and pasting
using the mouse when the X Window System is running? I suspect that it's not
xclipboard because that is a text-based terminal application that can be
used to cut and paste, but I'm interested in what is used when the left
mouse button is used to highlight text and the middle button used to paste
it in another vt or application window.

   The past couple of weeks I've had this fail sporatically. A couple of days
not at all, some days once, or twice, and a couple of days multiple times.
Killing the X server and restarting it restores the capability but it can
again silently disappear.

   Tomorrow night I'll run memtest86 all night to see if the new DIMMs are
responsible, and after that I'll exchange hard drives to eliminate that
potential source of hardware error. In the meantime I'm interested in
learning what else it might be. This has not happened before so I've no idea
what might cause it.

TIA,

Rich

I think Xlib is the library.  And I use xmodmap to modify which mouse
buttons do what.  Perhaps that's enough of a clue?

   Thank you, Glen. I use xmodmap to swap the Ctrl and CapsLock keys so
they're where they belong, but haven't done anything with the trackball
buttons.

   I'll re-install the Xlib and see if that helps.

On Ubuntu, it's "libx11".

I think what is happening is not that your const ui256 a(7) object is
disregarding the (argument's) const because of the non-const temporary
(ui256(1)), but rather that you are attempting to call a non-const
function (operator+) on your const object, a.

I was able to make the errors go away in my version of g++
(4.3.3-5ubuntu4) by changing your operator+ and operator- declarations to:

    ui256 operator+(const ui256& rhs) const;
    ui256 operator-(const ui256& rhs) const;


What do you think?

Do you mind if I ask how old/dirty your mouse is? I had a problem like
this a few years ago, and after poking around in the system for a while,
I just cracked open and cleaned out my mouse (yuck) and everything was
all better.

   Not at all. Ask away. :-)

   It's actually a Logitech trackball. When it needs cleaning it tells me by
getting sticky. The ball pops out and I clean out the cruft from the rollers
and sensor, wipe the ball, and return it. I just gave the button edges a
good blast of compressed air.

   I've had pointy devices wear out before, but none stopped working for
pasting apparently cut strings.

Thanks,

Rich

/media/hd0 is the *mount* point for the filesystem, not the device.  Tools
like blkid and vol_id need to look at the raw disk itself.

That means you want: blkid /dev/sda1  # or whatever raw device it is at.

O_o  How odd.  I didn't know blkid did any caching. :)

None, or "the X server itself" - copy and paste is actually negotiated between
the applications directly, as is the primary (and secondary) selection, and
the old fashioned and unloved cut buffers.

That is the primary selection, and is pretty much directly between the
applications.  However ...

The primary selection can be perturbed as focus changes, if you use the
focus-follows-mouse policy, which can trigger things that look like this.

The primary selection and clipboard can be perturbed if you run something like
xclipboard, the purpose of which is to notice that an application asserted "I
have something interesting in my $x", and then do things to it.

That seems odd.  I suggest testing with xev under X, to determine if the
clicks and so forth are coming through as expected.  That would eliminate the
mouse and let you investigate application level things for the root cause...

As mentioned earlier in the thread I believe, X11 doesn't really have a
clipboard per-se, but the copied content is passed between applications
as a type of token more like... (this is my understanding of it from
occasionally encountering this topic in blogs, etc., and it may be a
gross oversimplification). i've never really noticed except for a couple
times over the years, but have occasionally run into user complaints
online that the copied content vanishes if the originating application
(the place you copied from) is closed prior to pasting into the
destination application. would that happen to be the case in the events
where you've noticed the "clipboard" content getting dropped?

maybe time for a clipboard daemon in the form of a status-bar applet or
something akin to it?

Daniel,

   That's the conundrum: with the fstab entry linking a mount point to a UUID
there is no entry in /dev/. What I read is that udevd does its thing based
on UUID so, perhaps in the not-so-distant-future, the entire /dev directory
will be deprecated.

   However, as I wrote in an earlier message, the selected text remains
highlighted when I check it after finding the paste fails.

   Because a vital chip on the motherboard failed (the chip that included
video functions), I'm leaning more toward either hardware corruption or
subtle change to a system file.

   Today I'm using a USB-connected mouse instead of the trackball. If I don't
see the pasting failures I'll know it's the trackball causing the issue.

   Sunday (a slow day for mail so I can shut down the server for a few
hours), I'll swap out the new drive for the old ones, install Slackware-13.0
on it, make sure it boots, copy all my stuff from the bigger old drive, then
re-install the OS. My rationale is that if anything in the X server became
corrupted on the old drive, when I move files to the new drive with rsync it
might over-write the uncorrupted files in the new distribution.
Re-installing will correct that while leaving all non-distribution files in
place since the drive will not be repartitioned or reformatted.

   If these steps don't work I'll be totally stumped.

Dan:

This is correct. Adding the const at the end of the member function 
tells the compiler to go ahead and create the function if the promise to 
not change the parameters is met (and it is checked inside the member 
function anyways)

I found that the best solution was to move the mathematical operators (+ 
- * / % ) entirely outside the member methods, declare them as friends 
with binary input and return an object of that class.  This successfully 
gets around the const ( or no const) parameters.

I think the designers of C++ (Stroustrup) wanted to make things easy for 
the compiler, so we are forced to write all the operator overloads, not 
depend upon the compiler to get them correct for the class (not that 
this is possible anyways)

I do have C++ code running now, but invoking Boolean operators upon 
const class objects member functions is still something that I don't 
quite know how to do without creating a temporary or using a const_cast.

Thanks for your answer.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1010310723490.3557@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I'm trying to identify the issues continuing since the motherboard failure
caused me to build a new system, but still using the old main drive (the
second has been taken out of service). Testing the new 4G of memory seems
not to work.

   The system has 4G of RAM (Kingston) and memtest86-3.5 does not (yet)
accommodate 4+G of RAM so I built memtest86-3.4 and installed memtest86-bin
in /boot, made it the last choice in /etc/lilo.conf, ran /sbin/lilo, and
decided that last night was a good time to run the tests.

   I rebooted and started the testing about 8:00pm last evening. Very quickly
the display showed it running test #2, and the right-most column (error
positions, IIRC) kept cycling with 5-digit numbers. A couple of hours later
the display had not changed. About 6:30 am this morning it still hadn't
changed.

   There is no mail list for support by the Brady bunch, and their Web site
says they don't respond to requests for help, problem reports, or bug
reports because the tool is downloaded > 200k times/month.

   There are almost certainly hardware folks here who might have some
suggestions on what I might have done incorrectly or what the lack of change
in the display (e.g., number of test series completed, total errors found)
might mean.

HI

How many sticks are you using??

If more then one..

Remove all but one and run the test..

Keep replacing till you see the problem??

Marvin,

   There are 2 DIMMs.

   Do I correctly understand that the apparent lack of results means the
memory has significant errors? It's still under warranty as a matched pair
so I can exchange it at ENU tomorrow if that's the case.

Thanks,

Rich

Yes...

One of them is bad..

Even though they are a match pair you can test one at a time..

Any error is significant error...

I would exchange..

No *immediately obviously* device entry; it still exists.

However, that means your problem is the exact opposite of what you stated: you
want to find the device node based on the UUID, not the UUID based on the
device after all.

Someone else already suggested the /dev/disk/by-* directories; the easiest way
to map a UUID to a device node is, as they mentioned, 'ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/'

....er, no.  Using a stable identifier is the only sane thing to do with the
way that modern systems detect devices, but that is just a pointer on back to
the traditional device node.

(Specifically, the tree mentioned above is a tree of symlinks based on
 persistent properties back to the actual owning node, and is what mount uses
 to discover that detail.[1])

        Daniel

Yeah: selection and ownership of the "primary selection" are different; while
making a selection should assert ownership, changing primary selection
ownership should not cause your text to be deselected.

So, it could still be this despite the visual cue.

It is certainly possible, but I would suggest you perform those steps anyhow:
it will tell you, with certainty, what is happening in terms of the mouse
input, and that will tell you if it is that mouse events are missed, or if the
selection stuff is going wrong.

   No. I know the UUID of the external drive but want to learn the UUID of
the hard drive partitions that are identified (currently) as /dev/hda1 -
/dev/hda13. I know that Slackware-13.1 has moved to using UUIDs in
/etc/fstab/ so if I can write down the relationships now it will make the
upgrade easier.

   Oh. Now I better understand.

If you want to test your memory you should use memtest86+,  not
memtest86. There is a forum for discussing memtest86+ here.

The class is badly declared.
Should have been:

ui256 ui256::operator+(const ui256&) const

or even better to declare a non-member operator+:

class ui256 {
...
friend ui256 operator+(const ui256& a, const ui256& b ) /*no const
here*/ { ... }
};

> main.cpp:18: error: passing ?const ui256? as ?this? argument of ?ui256

Same thing, operator- is declared as non-const.

It has nothing to do with temporaries. operator+ is invoked on "a"
which is const, but the operator is not.

Try "i+a", it'll be even more unhappy. That's why you declare

The compiler is correct. But you don't need these additional operators.

I should add that this seems to say that memtest86 crashed not that it
reported you have bad memory.

This is very simple in ubuntu and I would imagine Slackware would work the
same.
typing 'sudo blkid' yields:

*jason at blackbox:~$ sudo blkid
/dev/sda1: UUID="9dbc8550-6458-41bc-80ab-5d444d7e9278" TYPE="ext4"
/dev/sda3: UUID="b74555c7-527a-45c4-ab39-5101f042684c" TYPE="ext4"
/dev/sda5: UUID="05f215ec-6f7e-4308-8c4e-01eaedfca9ed" TYPE="swap"
/dev/sdb1: UUID="11938b8f-4232-4e4c-a859-72cd978de172" TYPE="ext4"
/dev/sdb5: UUID="f8ec38d1-99ee-461c-9d17-079cab808e03" TYPE="ext4"
/dev/sdb6: LABEL="MassStorage" UUID="78f2251a-3eec-405c-abc7-e24d03a1cf0a"
TYPE="ext4"
/dev/sdc1: LABEL="Portable" UUID="b775d7bb-aeb0-4435-932b-1969050948c4"
TYPE="ext4" *


Which matches my fstab: (NOTE: the comments for /dev/sda* were added by the
installer so if Slackware does the same, the upgrade will be much less
confusing than you are expecting)

*jason at blackbox:~$ cat /etc/fstab
