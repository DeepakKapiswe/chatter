Message-ID: <CADKOhKcWoucbFboWTFDQt3yPV3wbif2fwwX22nQdONWLY=65aQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

New problem..

My speakers are making a 60 cycle snow noise.

Started yesterday..  Tried adjusting volume. No help.

As a last extreme measure I shut the computer off and powered down the speakers.

This morning I turned the speakers on the they were quite until I
turned the computer on.. Then the noise started again..

So I am thinking..  Capacitor failure on Mother Board or Power supple

Would that be a logical conclusion?

TIA..

Couple of possibilities here:

1.  Correct IP address to your home box.
Does your ISP issue static IP addresses?  If not, you can use a service 
like DynDNS to set up a dynamic dns address that updates as your home IP 
address changes assuming your router supports it.

2.  Firewall
Are you going through a router?  Is the firewall configured to forward 
the SSH port to your backup machine?

3.  SSH Daemon
Is the SSH daemon running on the backup box?  Did you configure it to 
accept inbound connections?

I suspect the others are correct and that it's a keyboard problem, but 
nonetheless, I would open up the case and confirm that your fans are 
running.

Possibly.  I would first try driving the speakers from another device, 
preferably battery powered, like a portable music player or radio.  You 
might also want to try using headphones with your computer.

Did you move an Ethernet cable or monitor cable? I have
found that there's enough leakage from both of these that
if you have speaker cables or audio signal cables running
near either of these you can get some crosstalk.

Message-ID: <CAJeYwHfjr8zjLoJvPXwL9qx27etBsKZ1ysMhxTQ636H8jMFgTg@mail.gmail.com>

Has anyone written udev rules for the USB removable media thumbdrives?
 Ubuntu 12.04 LTS is half-way mounting my SanDisk Cruzer USB stick,
but not actually mounting it as a partition on the filesystem (unless
the user clicks on the disk icon in the desktop panel)

I would like the device to be simply automounted with manual intervention.

I did find a promising tool, udev-discover, has anyone used it on Ubuntu 12.04 ?

I would like to know how big of a job this is going to entail, if I
have to add a rule into the /etc/udev/rules.d/ folder ??

Thanks for your input.

- Randall

I meant "without" manual intervention.  (and yes, I did try to proof

This is what I use for my Lexar 4GB thumbdrive.  I think I got the values 
by looking at dmesg after inserting the drive.

It's been a few years, so I'm not sure I can reconstruct all the steps 
without spending some time thinking about it.

/etc/udev/rules.d/58-Lexar.rules:

KERNEL=="sd?1", ATTRS{idVendor}=="05dc", ATTRS{idProduct}=="a732", SYMLINK+="lexar"
ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="sd?1", ATTRS{idVendor}=="05dc", ATTRS{idProduct}=="a732", RUN+="/bin/mkdir /mnt/lexar"
ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="sd?1", ATTRS{idVendor}=="05dc", ATTRS{idProduct}=="a732", RUN+="/bin/mount -t vfat -o sync,flush,uid=1000,gid=100 /dev/lexar /mnt/lexar"
ACTION=="remove", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ENV{ID_VENDOR_ID}=="05dc", ENV{ID_MODEL_ID}=="a732", RUN+="/bin/umount /mnt/lexar"
ACTION=="remove", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ENV{ID_VENDOR_ID}=="05dc", ENV{ID_MODEL_ID}=="a732", RUN+="/bin/rmdir /mnt/lexar"


Plug in the thumbdrive, and voila!  /mnt/lexar.

http://lmgtfy.com/?q=%2Fusr%2Fbin%2Fdog
http://packages.debian.org/search?suite=sid&arch=any&mode=exactfilename&searchon=contents&keywords=/dog

I had to dig a bit for that.  My first try was to search squeeze 
(default / stable.)

http://packages.debian.org/search?suite=squeeze&arch=any&mode=exactfilename&searchon=contents&keywords=/dog

Probably should have searched for the package name:
http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=dog&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all
http://packages.debian.org/sid/dog

Subject: [PLUG] gnome-terminal F11 full screen
Message-ID: <20130303220051.GA24374@gate.kl-ic.com>

Age causes fingers to go in unplanned directions while typing.

The F11 key on my keyboard is mere millimeters above right paren
")", so I am often going into full screen mode in gnome-terminal.
The only way I know to get out of full screen is exit and kill that
terminal, restarting and resizing after.  There is no "return to
previous size" short cut.  F11 in gnome-terminal sucks, and whoever
designed that functionality might benefit from gentle flogging.

BUT - you can turn off F11 (and also F1, which brings up help, 
also annoying but reversable) by running Gnome Configuration Editor
( often in System Tools in the Gnome menu ), drilling down through
/apps/gnome-terminal/keybindings .  Then you change the full-screen
option from F11 to the string "disabled".  you can also change F1
to "disabled" as well.  

Finally, relief from restless finger syndrome, and no need to
display your D or your K finger (or run 'cat --tail=9') when
you encounter the gnome-terminal maintainer.

Intel is a day late and a dollar short.  This one has been out for

By the way, I'm new here and I'm hopefully not breaking too many

I moved from France almost two years ago and would love to meet you all!

This group has a good level of patience, and will try to gently correct

Welcome!

You have at least three regular ways to meet some of us in person. The 
first one is this Thursday at the regular monthly meeting. The second is 
the PLUG Advanced Topics meeting on the third Tuesday of the month. And 
the third is the PLUG Clinic, held on the third Sunday of the month.

See the PLUG home page:

http://www.pdxlinux.org/

for details.

and I would like to add these to the mix:

Q: What key changes have you seen in Oregon's tech scene over the last 
decade or two? Start-ups are getting a lot more ink than the Tek's, MG's 
and Intel's of the community.

That said, what have you observed about the Silicon Valley/Silicon 
Forest relationship? What will never happen here that routinely happens 
there? Is a significant and truly-local VC scene in our future?

What key differences do you see surrounding Oregon's open source 
start-ups like Puppet Labs and proprietary software ones? The funding? 
The management? The hiring? Do you see people working for an open 
source-oriented start-up for a lower salary in exchange for other rewards?

Why aren't we hearing about Tripwire or WebTrends the way we hear about 
the current generation of smaller, local tech companies? What 
generational (economic or personal) factors might be at play?

Do you think Oregon's educational institutions are meeting the needs of 
Oregon's tech industry? Does the geography of the larger schools impede 
their reach? What can be changed from K-12 on up to better meet current 
and future needs?

Do you regularly attend any tech meetings found on Calagator? Which do 
you find valuable for reporting? Do you feel Portland is missing any 
cross-pollination between the different communities you engage?

What does the SAO (Software Association of Oregon or perhaps they have a 
new name) mean to you and open source users and developers?

Mac, PC or open source for you? iOS, Andriod or other?

Thanks!

Michael

Sorry if this moves into TALK topic area, but I was curious what Dog did,
so went to google and saw that Marvin had asked the same question in 2010:

http://www.linux-archive.org/fedora-user/429540-dog.html

Sorry Marvin, made me laugh. I'm always losing track of these sorts of
things too, but not sure if google has ever caught me at it!

For context, dog is a replacement for the cat command, which Marvin did
point out but I read as a political statement.

Subject: [PLUG] CUDA programming for tight loop - any game programmers here?
Message-ID: <20130304203059.GA27630@gate.kl-ic.com>

Does anyone here know how to program the numerical array processors
(shading engines, etc) on high-end graphics cards?  nVidia provides
a "zero-cost-but-not-open" language, CUDA, which can be used to
program these teraflop cards, but the learning curve is steeper
than I can manage alone.

I am looking at radio sidelobe patterns for my "open technology"
server sky project, and discovered that emitter swarms shaped
like flattened geodesic spheres have some remarkable properties. 
You can see a cheesy demo here:

http://server-sky.com/gsr02-link

Just downloading and displaying the flash video will max your CPU. 
It took more than 4 hours to compute, and a full scale map
( 1000x1000 km ) with a full size array ( 30,000 thinsats ) would
take 6 weeks per frame on a 3GHz Pentium.  The core of the loop is
six lines of code, with 3 multiplies, 6 adds, a sin() and a cos().
So you can see why I would like to compute a tad bit faster ...

I figure a game programming guru would be great for this.  There
are a few hundred members of the Portland Indie Game Squad:
http://pigsquad.com/

Surprisingly, I don't recognize any names.  Any "crossovers" in
PIGS and PLUG on this list?

I have stayed out of the thread because (a) I don't use Gnome ... got 
forced out when my old machine wasn't "up to" the latest version ... 
sigh ... that is another story, though.

But I have a couple of things ...
     (b) Knosole has no such "hot key" or toggle that I can find ... 
have to use an item in a drop down menu
     (c) on my keyboard F11 and F12 are directly above "Backspace"
     (c.1) the ( and ) are more or less centered under F7, F8, and F9
     (d) going from "maximized" to "full-screen" gains 3 lines/rows and 
no columns
     (d.1) 51 lines at maximized, and 54 at full-screen
     (d.2) 184 columns in either case

I guess you'd have to be there?

Message-ID: <CAJeYwHdK4vmPa3ap3PVpDO4=y7DGU3eSCDjTUwzq5tXUWPYwrw@mail.gmail.com>

I wish to thank David Fleck for providing a sample of his udev rules,
as I was able to use it as a template and eventually get something
working in /etc/udev/rules.d/ folder on the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS system
for my Sandisk Cruzer thumb drive.

I had to use the udevadm info and udevadm test commands in conjunction
with the kern.log to actually experiment a bit with the udev rules and
see why they were failing, until I did get something that worked.

For everyone's information, the Vendor ID's and some product ID's for
usb devices are kept at http://www.linux-usb.org/usb.ids, although
using the "lsusb" command provides a nice listing too of the actual
devices in the system.

Portland Linux/Unix Group Advanced Topics Meeting Announcement

Who: Chris Cappuccio
What: flashrd+nsh OpenBSD Network Appliances
Where: Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th Avenue, Portland (Left Entrance)
When: Tuesday, March 19th, 2013 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of technology freedom


flashrd+nsh: OpenBSD imaging and easy configuration for network 
appliances and virtual environments

Installation, upgrade and configuration are important, practical 
functions. OpenBSD's reputation for advanced networking functionality is 
second only to its reputation for having a tight knit development 
community which considers these functions first and foremost a 
convenience for developers.

In this session, we'll discuss the use and application of the flashrd 
and nsh tools for creating networking system images catered to 
deployment  by IT staff, consultants and OEMs. We'll also discuss 
OpenBSD networking features and applications that can be instrumented by 
nsh, and discuss any general OpenBSD features and history, as desired by 
you, the participants.

Chris Cappuccio is a systems and network architect, with 16 years of 
experience starting as a Unix system administrator, followed up with 
extensive IP, DSL, wireless and SS7 network deployment and operation. 
Chris owns and operates Yellowknife, a wireless network provider 
covering thousands of square miles of unserved and underserved areas 
with high performance Internet access. He has been a part-time 
contributor to networking and driver services in the OpenBSD operating 
system for 14 years.

http://www.nmedia.net/nsh/

Many will break for the Lucky Lab on Hawthorne afterwards.

ulimit -c unlimited
mkdir -p /var/log/cores
echo '/var/log/cores/core.%e.%s.%p.%t' > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
echo '1' > /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable

Start process
Kill the process

$$ is the current process so that would be the shell script.  You want a
dump of
the shell?

Please read the kernel docs suid_dumpable in sysctl/fs.txt ( at least on my
2.6.32 kernel).

Okay, that worked.  I didn't really understand what was
in my /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern previously.  I think
it started with a vertical bar -- |.

I didn't do the
echo '1' > /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable

yet, but may need it for the next steps.  I've just
tested it with that little script and will work on
this with my server next.

Thanks for the reply.

I have verified that I presently specify only LTS releases.  I am not sure
that it was set that way previously, but I thought that it was.

The man page piece you quote does not clarify the difference, if any,
between update and upgrade.  But things seems to be going as expected now.

Sorry for the late response.  I was out of town and away from the machine.

Well, haven't been able to get a core from my server.  I did
the echo '1' > ...  now and also added these lines

if (prctl(PR_SET_DUMPABLE,1, 0, 0,0) == -1) {
   syslog(...);
}

to my server  after calling setgid and setuid.

After echoing 1 to /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable, I stopped
my server with systemctl and then restarted it with systemctl.

/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern is set to this:
core.%e.%s.%t

So I'm hoping to get the core in the current working
directory of the server, but don't seem to get it there or
anywhere else.  The server is able to write regular files
to that current working directory.  Any more ideas?

For those of us who would love to be there but can't make it, will 
someone be creating a pod cast of the talk?

Thanks for putting together a great talk.  You know it is a good one when
it runs well past beer 30.

Hi

Is anyone running denyhosts?

I had to reinstall and now I can't get it to work.

It does say it is running but, not working.

TIA

Denyhosts hasn't been updated in a while, and it depends on Python
which has its own security issues.  Besides, you still have to
properly set up ssh correctly.  Once that's done, why not take the
extra step and set up /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny manually?
Then use iptables to drop ssh attacks - as in DROP and REJECT. That
way, the attacker gets no info on your server, and you don't have to
fill up your logs.

Also, denyhosts, fail2ban, sshguard all depend on generating a simple
IP blacklist and properly configured logging (/var or other partition
can get full).  Attackers can also spoof their packet's source header.

China bangs on my game server constantly, in addition to the various
script kiddies.  I very much doubt they will get in.  Better to block
everything and only let certain host and user ssh keys in.

Just my 2 cents.

Thanks for the comeback...

I am only a user on the system I installed denyhost so I am limited on
what I can do..

Thanks

Ah.  That might explain it not working.  denyhosts will need to be run
as root usually.  Otherwise it can't read/update certain system files.
And you need to be root to configure sshd properly before running it.
 Did you set up alternative log files, etc?  From the FAQ:
-------------------
Do I need to run DenyHosts as root?

If you are running DenyHosts in daemon mode then yes you must run
DenyHosts as root.

In all other cases, such as running DenyHosts from cron then
technically speaking, no. However, in order to run DenyHosts as
non-root you must ensure that you have read-permissions on the
/var/log/ sshd server logs. Alternatively, you can copy them to a
directory where you do have read-permissions.

Also, in order for DenyHosts to block hosts, it needs write
permissions for the /etc/hosts.deny file. DenyHosts will gladly run
without being able to update this file. In this mode, the hosts that
should be blocked are written to stdout (in a form suitable for
pasting into /etc/hosts.deny). Also, you can use an alternate
HOSTS_DENY file (other than /etc/hosts.deny) which may not require
root priviledges.

I did record it and need to check how it came out.

Does anyone with some solid audio experience want to take a stab at 
cleaning up some of the recent recordings for posting? Do you Randal 
indeed have access to the PLUG feed that shows up in iTunes and friends?

Anyone want to play an A/V roll?

Thanks!

Hello all,

Silly question but I don't have an answer to it: What do you consider 
the right number of meeting reminders on the list and how many days in 
advance? I suspect a daily countdown from the day it's announced (yes, 
sometimes they're last minute) would be considered spam.

Does anyone have a schedule that works from another context?

Thanks!

Michael

You're welcome! You do know however about the implied thank-you in open 
source: Flame at length but silence means something between "I choose to 
ignore you, idiot" and "you're doing great!"

When in doubt, buy refreshments for the person you want to thank.

(Thanks! You know who you are!)

Contribute great speakers if the above does not work. :)

I don't have a problem with the current approach which, IIRC, is a 
couple of times before the event. I think that works out to twice in the 
week before.

What does cleaning up entail? I use the audacity audio editor for home 
recordings and piracy.

Message-ID: <20130310170837.74a69081@Devil8>

My watch, telephone and the clocks in the range, microwave and car all
automatically updated themselves last night, but the computers (Fedora
16 [Xfce] and Xubuntu 12.04) remain stubbornly on standard time.

In the past on the Fedora computer I used "# service ntpd stop" followed
by "... start," but this time it has no effect. And the Xubuntu
computer just says "ntpd: unrecognized service." After a bit of
sleuthing I discovered that the ntpd service was not installed on the
Xubuntu computer, so I installed it. But the command line still says
"ntpd: unrecognized service." The Xubuntu Time and Date GUI tool also
shows no update option, and the Help files are for a different version
than the one installed.

Both computers display the clock widget in the Xfce panel, but the
widget has no "update" option. 

The ntpd man page says that the -U option allows setting the update
time interval to a specified number of seconds. I set it to 300 seconds
(five minutes), but half an hour later it still has not updated the
clock.

Are the npt servers still on standard time? Does anyone else have
computer clocks that are an hour ahead today?

John,

Kubuntu updated automatically last night.
I opened System Settings > Date and Time and checked the box that said,

After further googling I discovered that the ntp servers just report
UTC time. It is up to my computers to translate that to local time.

I used ntpq -p to verify on both computers that they see the ntp
servers. And the ...restart command works without error on both
computers, so the computers are talking to the servers. And both
computers are set to Los Angeles time.

And just now I used the date command and discovered that both computers
think that the time is 4:38. Yet the clock in the Xfce panel says it is
5:38. Guess we now know where the bug is. :)

I'm off to rag on the devs at the Xfce forum. :)

John,

   I've used Xfce since Olivier first released it and have never experienced
a problem with changing time twice a year. When the Shrub altered the
transition dates from standard to daylight saving and back we all had to
update a library (I forget which one new), but that new library should be in
any current distribution.

   I don't think it's an Xfce issue.

Rich

I posted a query in the Xfce Desktop forum, but no replies so far.

My current theory is that there is a library or config file somewhere
that tells it when DST starts, and the date is the old one before it
was moved back. But that doesn't explain why it always worked before.
I've had Xfce on my Fedora laptop for at least a couple of years now,
and I have never had this problem before. It is also strange that the
Xubuntu 12.04 desktop is equally affected. 

I'm pretty sure the problem is limited to the datetime widget in the
panel. From the command line the date command returns the right time,
and ntpq -p tells me that both computers are communicating with the ntp
servers, so their internal clocks are set correctly. For some reason
the datetime widget has stopped updating itself or, if it is still
updating itself, it has the time zone or onset time for DST wrong.

It is possible to over ride the settings on a user basis using the TZ variable.
This is typically used for remote login accounts that are in a
different time zone
than the computer.  If this was set and didn't have the correct date change info
in it this could cause the problem.  It would also persist on newly
installed systems
where someone pulled in their shell environment from an older machine.

I have to agree with Rich; I really doubt that it's an Xfce problem.
I have two Fedora machines: my desktop running F17, and my laptop
running F18.  Both of them switched over to Daylight Saving Time, with
no trouble.  Date, GKrellM, LXDE's panel module, and E17's Clock Module
all show the right time.  I don't have Xfce installed, so I can't check
that.

I really doubt that this is the problem.  It seems quite unlikely to
me that both Fedora and Xubuntu would fail to update their time zone
data files in exactly the same way.  For what it's worth, though,
there are two time zone packages for Fedora: tzdata and tzdata-java.
The first has all the rules for time zones all over the world.  The
second is the same thing, but for Java -- the language, not the
island. :-)  Both are at version 2012j.  My version of ntpdate is
4.2.6p5.  But like I said, I doubt this is the problem.

Sorry I couldn't help more.

I try to post the pdx.pm announcements on the website, calagator, and 
the mailing list 2 weeks before the meeting.  Then mail a reminder 1 
week out and the night before (or morning of) the meeting.  I get the 
impression that most people are using the calagator for their reminders, 
but I don't twit and such much, so I like e-mail reminders.

I'm not going to say what I do for announcements ... something to do
with the 5th amendment.  But what feels right to me is: one about a
week out, and a reminder the day before or day of.  So, basically
concurring with Eric, but less sure about the efficacy of the 2 week
notice.

My 1/50th dollar, fwiw.

The time_t unix_seconds = mktime(struct tm calendar) and the struct tm
calendar = *localtime(time_t unix_seconds) are nice inverses of each
other, but what do you do for
UTC time?

I don't want to set the local timezone of my PC to UTC for mktime() to
get it right and have unix_seconds agree with the local
clock_gettime() system time tv_sec value.  mktime doesn't work right,
when you feed it a struct tm calendar built from gmtime() call.  Or
did someone write a nice utcmktime() function?

I am having a rough time visualizing the mechanisms that translate compiled code into binary instructions. Most resources use very vague language, like "fetch" and "execute". Although these are primitive instructions, they are still abstract. How does this "fetch" go about driving down a bus, picking up elections stored in a memory cells, and translating them into something useful?(keep in mind hisenburg principal)

Sounds like quite a homework assignment.
And no wonder you're having trouble with it, you're trying to handle too
many levels of stuff at once.  And it's all mixed between metaphor, model
and reality.

It's like trying to use organic chemistry to understand traffic laws.

So break it down, understand each level separately.  Understand what's a
metaphor, what's a model and what's real.  And stay out of the solid-state
physics for now, that stuff's ugly.

> Call me faithless, but can someone provide me material that goes this deep.?

Sure, it's called "earning an electrical engineering degree" :)
I did that a few years ago at PSU.  Takes a while.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set might be a good midpoint to
start at. Code compiles to very, very, simple instructions, which are
derived from a huge legacy of computing... for example, you mentioned
electrons (or "elections", heh), but I started with paper tape storage,
which was later related to drum storage, which spawned other kinds of
magnetic and chip storage. As an alternate to starting at a midpoint, maybe
start at the beginning, and work your way through the history of computing.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing It's about 4,000 years
long, but to simplify (which is why so many things go abstract), we
invented machines that count beads really freaking fast, and then used
bead-counting as a way of doing things that didn't, at first, seem to
involve counting.

Subject: [PLUG] Android tablets - configurability?
Message-ID: <20130313024910.GA4905@gate.kl-ic.com>

Are Android tablets "programmable enough" to do open source tasks?
They look like media vending machines to me, not quite walled
garden like iCrap but focused on entertainment and social media
rather than constructing work environments with open source tools.

Over a couple of decades, I have slowly learned how to configure
an X86 Linux machine to do a few work tasks - handling text, ssh,
tunneling vpn links, writing shell scripts, etc.  

The tasks I have in mind are: typing notes for later upload to
a server, looking at downloaded PDFs and documents.  Bonus points
if the device can run local copies of Apache and MoinMoin.  When
wifi or hard wired ethernet(?) is available, surfing the web for
information, connecting through an openvpn tunnel to a firewalled
internal LAN, ssh'ing into a server for ascii email, printing
through CUPS, logging into webapps on the internal LAN. 

Securely, of course.

And since tablets use Android and non-X86 processors, and
cross-compiling is too complex for my simple brain, a local
copy of the GCC toolchain and related libraries, perhaps
Perl and Python.  In otherwords, recreating most Linux
laptop/desktop capabilities in the Android environment.  

All FOSS apps, of course.  I'm not much of a programmer and
rarely tweak code, but routinely look at source to figure
out how the heck a poorly-documented app works, or what
files it is looking for or spitting out.

I'm a "$5 a month for basic cell phone" guy.  I don't want
to pay $20 a month (which I think of as $2400 per decade)
for another wireless service.  So I want to be able to run
unconnected, connecting when free/cheap wifi is available.


Is this realistic, or are tablets different enough that I would
need to spend years (at a few hours a month) re-learning how to
accomplish these kinds of tasks?  Should I just stick to laptops
and netbooks?

Android runs a GUI written and mostly programmed in Java. JVM languages
(JPython is one) can be made to work.  There is a NDK (native development
kit) for GCC but the Linux environment is different.

Android is FOSS, the code all available from google.

Once you get over some surprises and become a touchy kind of guy, you could
get a lot of work done, but it too would be different.

Excellent comments, thanks for a thoughtful reply.  Since my
wife and I will be touch-typing lots of text on a "screen
keyboard", we will probably need 10 inch screens, but those 
are also pretty cheap.  The main thing is to avoid spending
weeks of time finding out we can't quite get all the 
necessary tasks done.

Message-ID: <20130312220452.2cf03bc6@Devil8>

Last week I was surfing along in Firefox and suddenly the mouse froze,
and then a few moments later the screen went black, followed by the
Thinkpad boot screen coming up. Fedora 16 x86_64 (all updates applied)
had just crashed. When it finished rebooting I found nothing in
var/log/messages or anyplace else I could think of to look. There were
no other symptoms at all. 

This evening it happened again, except that this time it happened when
launching K3b. I had not done anything in Firefox for 15-20 minutes.
Upon rebooting I note the following in /var/log/messages just before it
died:

Mar 12 21:25:07 Devil8 kernel: [184171.870772] traps:
nautilus[10552] trap divide error ip:7f2eb1544638 sp:7fff72a0b3b0

Mar 12 21:25:09 Devil8 kernel: [184174.351575] ACPI:
\_SB_.PCI0.IDE0.PRIM.MSTR - docking

I note that I am running Xfce desktop, although Gnome is also
installed. I have never logged in with Gnome since Fedora went to
Gnome 3. In the Xfce settings "automatically start Gnome services on
login" is unchecked. I have no idea why Nautilus is running.

A computer that just unceremoniously crashes is not tolerable. 

In addition (probably unrelated) just before the crash I find the
following message over and over:

Mar 12 21:21:42 Devil8 NetworkManager[1110]: <info> Auto-activating
connection 'JJJ-2'. 
Mar 12 21:21:42 Devil8 NetworkManager[1110]: <info>
Connection 'JJJ-2' auto-activation failed: (2) WPA Ad-Hoc disabled due
to kernel bugs 

There is no JJJ-2 network. There is a JJJ wireless network. At one
time, while struggling to get the JJJ wireless network running properly
I created a JJJ-2 wireless network, which was later deleted. Since the
laptop is always connected to ethernet wireless connections are
disabled when at home. Yet it continues to try to autoconnect to a
wireless network that does not exist. 

In Network Configuration I found a long list of wireless networks that
I may have connected to (or tried to connect to) at one time, including
JJJ-2. The GUI has no option to delete the network. There is a checkbox
in front of each (all were ticked) in a column labeled "Profile," but
there is no Help information for what "Profile" means or what will
happen if I uncheck the box. I unchecked all but the ones I recognized
as networks that I actually connect to.

Any and all suggestions welcome.

If you can, check to see what is happening to the temperature of the
CPU when this is happening.

Finding open source apps for android can be difficult, since the mass-
consumer hype around everything android treats free and open as 
interchangeable, and almost every article about anything involving 
android includes the words "open source" regardless of which paid app it 
is advertising.

The main thing to realize is that you don't get a standard Linux 
environment with a shell (you can get a shell with connectbot to see 
just how crippled it is) and you are not root until you void the 
warranty.  There is also not a standard bios/bootloader, so you have to 
do device-specific workarounds to "root" your device.  Then, all of the 
apps are in java (although it's possible to compile and run binaries on 
a "rooted" device.)  That said, the touch interface can be pretty handy 
and the CPU/ram/camera/video capabilities of a sub-$200 7" wifi tablet 
are pretty impressive.

There are a few tablets out there that are dual boot but not many.
http://www.pengpod.com/products/pengpod1000

The ubuntu tablet is coming.

I just did a search and found an application that is called terminal IDE.
It says it has a full android sdk environment Java/c/c++/html + editor and
other tools.  Don't know how well it works.  I just have a android phone which
is too small to bother with most of these tools.

Connectbot like mentioned previously is the basic ssh shell and the source
is available. https://code.google.com/p/connectbot/

I haven't tried a 10" tablet but the cheap ones have the same screen
resolution as the
7" tablets.

If you guys are doing a bunch of typing and are looking for wired ethernet
capability, I'd suggest taking a look at the Asus Transformer series.  with
the keyboard dock they effectively become an Android netbook.  Plus last
time I checked they were well supported by the homebrew Android community.

I have been considering a tablet for a long time. Does ASUS make any
that already come with Android or Linux?

The ASUS website offers no "select by feature" options, so you have to
scour through all the specifications for each tablet.

John,  The Asus tf300t, tf300tl, and tf700t models are android tablets
which will dock with what is essentially the lower half of a laptop
assembly containing an additional battery, full size usb ports and so
forth.  the lower half will recharge the tablet proper.  I have a first gen
Transformer, and I quite like it.  I use it most days for casual browsing
an reading, etc.  I don't do much creation on it, I usually go to my desktop
for that.  They are all 10 inch tablets with varying resolution and HW
specs.

                -Mike

I added the Xfce4 sensor plugin to the panel, so now I can see the
temps. It shows CPU0 and CPU1, fan speed, hard disk temp and ACPI mWh.
The CPU temps seem to run between 39-45 C and the hard disk stays at a
steady 32 C. The fan is on about half the time at a speed of 2534 rpm.

I need to figure out some kind of CPU stress test to see how hot I can
get the CPUs and to watch the fan speed as they heat up. 

I doubt it is the CPU temps that is causing the problem because I
never feel heat and the air coming out the vent is barely warmer than
the room air. But your suggestion made me realize that the sudden black
screen without any symptoms or error messages means that it is probably
hardware.

John,

You may not be feeling heat or cooling from the fan because it is 
clogged with dust.  I was surprised
by the amount of dust that collects in the fan on my laptop.  Have you 
cleaned it within the last
year?

   Heh-heh! I could give you some digital terrain data at 5m resolution and
have you run it through GRASS's r.basin to delineate subbasins at 100m
resoultion. You can cook eggs on the CPU with that intensity of work. I know
because I inadvertently shut down my workstation due to CPU overheating
until I made the resolutions much coarser.

Yes, it was cleaned about a year ago, at which time the computer was
about four years old. There was practically no dust in it then, so I
doubt enough has built up in the past year to make any difference. 

I still want to stress the CPUs to get them as hot as I can and watch
what happens.

I would get rid of the unused wireless networks, including JJJ-2 or
whatever.  Your google is as good as mine to find command line options to
clean this up.   If you can turn off wifi altogether, and see what does or
doesn't happen.

Message-ID: <CAL_ixhNKBnUPPfxy-pjBuz+3Xvt+1jWd=3v-i1Z478Qoy3AsDg@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I was looking at my ClearOS dhcp leases, and saw that I had a mysterious
host show up:

192.168.1.241d4:9a:20:5c:2b:04shalomThu Mar 14 02:02:56 2013
The address is on my wireless LAN. I tried to ping the host, but the
response timed out. I then did a tcpdump on the interface and filterd for
anything coming from that ip, but am not seeing any packets. My question
is, since the lease was renewed recently (I think the setup is for 24 hour
leases), does the other machine have to be online for that to happen? Did
Shalom's lease just "auto-renew" or did it have to be online to request it?

thanks,

I don't know of an auto-renew mechanism.  I think a lease renewal means 
the DHCP server communicated with the device when the lease was renewed.

FWIW, that's an Apple MAC address, possibly an iphone.

In addition to the suggestion Galen points at, you can override the
timezone temporarily at the commandline with the TZ environment
variable. E.g.:

  russell at mosier:~$ date
  Wed Mar 13 11:26:19 PDT 2013
  russell at mosier:~$ TZ=UTC date
  Wed Mar 13 18:26:26 UTC 2013
  russell at mosier:~$ TZ="Hongkong" date
  Thu Mar 14 02:27:51 HKT 2013

(for other timezone options, see, e.g. /usr/share/zoneinfo)

Thanks. My wireless is open, so it might have friends iphone.

If anyone's curious, I'm using clearOS as the gateway. You can remove these
leases by editing /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases. I'll watch and see if it
comes back.

Typically, IIRC, the client is responsible for requesting a lease
renewal.  In most cases, about halfway through the lease time, the
client will request a renewal (this might depend on the dhcp client
software, but half way seems to be common with Linux clients).  Of
course, if the client device is sleeping, or left the range of your
wireless network, or not responding to pings, you won't see it with
ping.

The canonical CPU stress test is compiling X - probably too geeky
for you. 

If you want something that overheats my laptop, go to
http://server-sky.com/DisplacementAcceleration
and download the binaries gsr02 and gsr03 and run both of them.
Each will keep one of your CPU cores busy, until the Thinkpad
overheats and shuts down.  At least, that's what happens with 
my Thinkpad T60.

When I need to do this much computation, I normally use a 
desktop machine.  A "big brother" of these calculations has been
running on my compute server since last Thursday, two instances
pegging both CPUs, and they will finish up any hour now.

BTW, it is amusing that the latest nVidia "Titan" GPU card will
do 1.4 Teraflops, for a mere $1400.  That is more computation on
one PCIe card than the world's biggest supercomputer 20 years ago.
I want to do some calculations that will max out a rack of these.
Scary big numeric problems.

I tried to get cpuburn but had difficulty finding an .rpm of it. In the
process of searching I found a lot of cautions that it can damage
hardware. Therefore I decided to leave this issue for the Clinic this
Sunday. I also need to do a dist-upgrade from Fedora 16 to Fedora 18,
which I will also do at the Clinic. By Sunday the PSU winter term will
be completely over so I can risk goobering up my main computer. Also,
my replacement 3TB Go Flex Desk hard drive should be here so I can use

there?

Today I ran the update manager (a GUI).  It indicated 44 updates.  I
clicked on install.  It proceeded without requesting the admin PW, which is
unusual.  The Applying Changes dialog took a long time, and the details
showed many warnings, the details of which I could not read as they went by
too fast.  The process went to completion, and the computer is functioning
fine, AFAIK. I searched for a log of what went on, but found nothing.
 Shouldn't there be a log of those warning messages somewhere?  I am
running Ubuntu 12.04.

Thanks,

-Denis

this came up recently on this very list - it's a change in behavior from
11.10 onward. Interestingly, it's positioned as a security improvement
(i.e. to make users more likely to actually install security updates).

Thanks for the info and the link.  Strange that I just noticed it.  I
suspect that it has not been consistent--it seems to me I have entered a PW
recently.

Anybody have info on the log of the messages generated?

And of course there's always Surplus Gizmos (Hwy 26 @ Cornelius Pass Road)
and URS (east of Burnside bridge.)

I was going to say United Radio Supply but apparently that's long
obsolete. Kind of like the tube transmitter and receiver I bought from
them in the '70s when I was into ham radio.

Subject: [PLUG] How to undo an update?
Message-ID: <51424070.6010006@comcast.net>

Yesterday, or maybe the day before, Ubuntu 10.04 did one of it's 
updates. It included updating LibreOffice to version 4.0.1.2. I was 
typing along yesterday, minding my own business, and LibreOffice 
disappeared from the screen. I was able to reopen it and recover both 
the .doc I was typing, and the .xls I use for a time sheet. At the same 
time, the program I used for playing back transcription audio files 
crashed. LibreOffice is a Java program, and I have a crash report 
related to that crash. Transcribe is a Python program. When I started 
Transcribe up again, it would not allow me to position the playback 
point so I could continue on without having to listen to the whole file 
over again. I switched to using ExpressScribe, a winders program, 
running on Virtual Box. That part works okay.

This morning I typed three files in LibreOffice with no problem. This 
afternoon I started on another file and got through about three and a 
half pages and LibreOffice disappeared from the screen. Again, I was 
able to recover the .doc and .xls files. (Yesterday I was working with 
the default 15 minute interval for automated save. Today I have that set 
to one minute. So I don't have to redo as much work as yesterday. We 
live and learn.)

Anyway, Does anyone have any ideas on how I could revert to an earlier 
version of LibreOffice in Ubuntu 10.04?

This weekend I'll be trying, again, to get Ubuntu 12.04 working on 
another machine. I note that the version of LibreOffice available under 
10.04 is through  a PPA, whereas the version available under 12.04 is 
now a "standard package." I don't know if that means LibreOffice on 
12.04 will be more stable or not. I have an installation of the 64 bit 
version of 12.04 with LibreOffice version 3.5.7.2. I don't know if the 
32 bit version is the same as the 64 bit version or not. I'll be 
installing the 32 bit version of 12.04 since there appears to be a 
problem with the nVidia driver not liking the 64 bit version of 12.04.

Okay. I'm starting to ramble so I'll shut up. Recommendations on how to 
have a stable version of LibreOffice will be appreciated. Alas, 
recommendations that I use another word processing tool will not help 
since I must use .doc templates that are provided to me.

Thanks.

LibreOffice was written in Java? I think a few of the functions require
Java, but I don't think the whole program was written in Java.

Uninstall the version you have on your Ubuntu, then go into Synaptic >
Settings (I think) > Repositories and disable the PPA repo. I am
guessing that the PPA repo is furnishing you with a beta or
non-Ubuntuized LibreOffice. Once you disable the PPA repo you should
find the Ubuntuized version available in Synaptic.

Or if that fails, uninstall the version you have and then go to the
home site and download the appropriate .deb file. Last time I did this
the download package contained a README explaining how to install it
using dpkg from the command line.

Or put up with it until Sunday and bring it to the Clinic. :)

My replacement 3 TB Go Flex Desk USB drive arrived today from Seagate.
I don't know how it is formatted (probably FAT32 or NTFS), but I want
to reformat it EXT4. Looking at it in Palimpsest there are options to
format the drive, but none seem to actually format the drive. Sometimes
I am asked if I want to partition the drive.

I know zero about how hard drives or partitions work. The drive will
just be used for external storage. Does it need a partition? Is that
why I can't seem to format it?

You never truly low level format modern drives.  If you don't want to
partition it,
just run mkext4.fs on the raw /dev/sdX device.

You will need to make sure that Linux didn't already automount it.
That could be why you
cannot put a new file system on it.

Thanks.

It was definitely not mounted, but Palimpsest still would not format
it. And mkext4.fs returned error "no such command." But after a quick
read of man mkfs I realized that I needed mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdd. It
worked without issue and Palimpsest now reports it as ext4. Mission
accomplished. 

Strange about Palimpsest. It has always worked fine for me before. Once
again the command line proves superior to the GUI.

Way cool! 

Also kinda sad ... Oregon Electronics was the name of the computer
cables and fiddlybits store at 10th and Couch, many years ago, run
by Gary Grosshoeme until his death.  I must have spent 100 hours
there shooting the breeze with Gary.

That's what I used to think, but I see you are correct. 
http://www.libreoffice.org/download/system-requirements/ says:

"For certain features of the software - but not most - Java is required. 
Java is notably required for Base."

So, I must have something in there using Java since there is much 
reference to it in the crash report.

Okay. This sounds like what I need to do. However there are a couple of 
things I need to keep. LibreOffice's spell check dictionaries a rather 
thin. Since I've been using it I've probably added a hundred or more 
word and also put in a couple of dictionaries of my own. I see that I 
just need to save a copy of 
/home/rsteff/.config/libreoffice/3/user/wordbook.

I also have a spreadsheet macro. It's not that complicated so I can 
recreate it from scratch, but it would be nice to find out where those 
are kept so I can make a copy of that, too. I'm sure I'll find it once I 
do a little Internet searching.

Thanks for the info. I'll report on how things worked out later.

It sounds as though you might have a problem with the version of Java
that LibreOffice is using. There are lots of versions and brands of
Java. I have a program that requires Sun Java 5.0 and won't run with any
other. You can install multiple Javas on your computer. If you do there
is a command line utility (forget what it's called) that you can use to
see what Javas are installed and to set one of them as the default for
the computer. In LibreOffice you can go into Preferences > Java and it
will show you what Javas are installed on your computer, and which one
LibreOffice is set to use. You can change which one LibreOffice uses,
which might be worth a shot. LibreOffice also comes with a version of
Java (forget which one), but maybe it didn't get installed. 

And yes, Base definitely requires Java, but so do a lot of Add-Ons,
Plug-Ins and Extensions. I once had problems with my OpenOffice and
finally tracked it down to the Extension Manager. An extension had been
installed twice with the sources from different folders.

And speaking of that reminds me that a standard troubleshooting trick
is to rename the ~/.LibreOffice folder. This folder is where
LibreOffice stores your preferences and installed add-ons. LibreOffice
will recreate a brand new default ~/.LibreOffice folder as soon as it
is launched, so if the problem is in an add-on this is a good way to
clean up the problem. When I had a problem with the Extensions manager
I did this, then copied subfolders from my original ~/.LibreOffice
folder in order to restore my personal dictionary, Autocorrect lists
and templates, and my toolbars and other settings.

Subject: [PLUG] Permissions problem
Message-ID: <20130315085928.4366df08@Devil8>

The Xfce GUI file manager (Thunar) refused to let me copy files
from /media/1TBDisk3/Movies/ to /media/Movies/ on my desktop computer by
dragging and dropping. So I decided to try the cp command instead. This
also failed. The command I used was:

$ cp -r /media/1TBDisk3/* /media/Movies/

Eventually I tried "sudo chown -r jjj:jjj /media" and then the above
command worked.

It took a long time because there were a lot of files (I left it copying
files when I went to bed last night), but this morning I saw that the
command line returned to $.So I tried to umount the drive in order to
move it to my laptop, but I kept getting the "drive is busy" error
message. However, all drive lights had been out for hours so I just
unplugged it.

Now it is plugged into the laptop and apparently mounted:

$ mount
/dev/sdc on /media/Movies type ext4
(rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,data=ordered,uhelper=udisks)

But I am unable to perform file operations with Thunar or Nautilus. So
I tried from the command line and got:

[jjj at Devil8 Movies]$ rm -r New Folder/
rm: remove write-protected directory `New Folder'? y
rm: cannot remove `New Folder': Permission denied

The permissions for all folders and files on the disk are drwxr-xr-x. I
could try chown again, but I am wondering if I messed up when I did
that on the other computer. I am jjj:jjj on both computers. There is
also a 2 GB SD card mounted on the laptop  (0123-4567), and from the
command line I get:

[jjj at Devil8 media]$ ls -la
total 12
drwxr-xr-x   4 root root  100 Mar 15 08:20 .
drwxr-xr-x. 30 root root 4096 Nov 17 08:00 ..
drwx------   3 jjj  jjj  4096 Dec 31  1969 0123-4567
-rw-------   1 root root    0 Mar 13 20:05 .hal-mtab-lock
drwxr-xr-x  10 1000 1000 4096 Mar 14 22:43 Movies

Clearly the permissions for the 2 GB SD card (which works as expected)
and the 3 TB USB drive are different, which must be the source of the
problem. What I can't figure out is what "10 1000 1000" means on the
Movies drive or how to get chown (or chmod?) to change the permissions
on it to match the 0123-4567 drive. I read the man pages for chown and
chmod and now I'm more confused than before.

Suggestions?

I /think/ I know what's going on, but bear with me for a bit of background
first.

The user name "jjj" and group name "jjj" are not really related to the
permissions on the drive.  They're really just convenient aliases for uid
and gid's, which are the numbers you see on the machine where the drive
isn't working.

When you run ls -la, the current computer looks up the numbers (probably in
/usr/passwd and /usr/group, or something similar) and if there are entries
in there, then it prints the name (eg: jjj) instead of the number.

Now, it looks like your desktop computer has "jjj" associated with uid
1000, and gid 1000, but your laptop has jjj associated with a different uid
/ gid pair. (strictly speaking the uid and gid are mapped to *different*
"jjj" names, but that doesn't really matter for this situation).

You could probably make this problem go away by setting the same UID / GID
for jjj on each computer (eg: changing the laptop to map jjj to 1000 for
uid / gid).

*However* that is much easier said than done.  Someone else on here may
know a way to go about that, but the thought makes me nervous. In ye good
olde days of Linux, you could "just" make sure the new ID on your
(1000,1000) is unused (but, it probably is /not/ unused), and then change
all the permissions from jjj:jjj to 1000:1000 (and all permutations, since
the user may own things the group doesn't and etc...).

Now, I'm not so certain it's that simple.  I don't trust the close coupling
between applications, interfaces, settings daemons, etc... to treat the
linux permissions system as a black box.  There may well be UID/GIDs tucked
away in other locations now.

Most likely it's that, while you are "jjj:jjj" on both computers, they are not 
the same User-ID/Group-ID on both computers. On the other computer user "jjj" 
is 1000 and group "jjj" is 1000, but on this one they are something else.

Check /etc/passwd and /etc/group on the two systems to make sure they're 
consistent.

This is a mis-match between Red Hat/Fedora and Debian/*buntu.  Red Hat
has, for a very long time, reserved UID/GID numbers below 500 for
system accounts.  Debian, on the other hand, reserved numbers below
1000.  My advice would be to change your UID/GID numbers on your
Fedora box to 1000:1000.  It doesn't matter if you upgrade to F17+, or
switch to another Ubuntu version, you'll need to do this.  Red Hat
recently came to the conclusion that there too many system programs that
required IDs to fit into the system space. So, as of F17, all the
standard user UID/GID numbers start with 1000.

Changing the IDs in my home directory wasn't hard, but there were a
number of files in odd places that needed to be changed.  I found the
find program to be very helpful (no pun intended).  Plus I had to
change my ID numbers in the system password files.  Again, no real
problem, but it's best to use the command line.

If I remember correctly, the column of numbers between the
permissions and the user name/number is the size of the directory.
Not something you need to worry about here.  The existence of the
".hal-mtab-lock" file is troubling; I don't think it should be
there.  It was probably created when you plugged your drive into
your desktop machine.  Normally, it would be deleted when you
dismounted the drive, but in this case, the drive wasn't properly
dismounted.  I would just delete that file.  Be sure that the lock
file is *that* lock file.  If you plug it in to your desktop
again, it may overwrite it with a new one.  OTOH, Fedora has recently
dropped HAL completely in favor of udisks.

Anyway, I hope this helps.

Using Synaptic I uninstalled  LibreOffice 4.0.1.2

I ran sudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/libreoffice-3-5

I ran sudo apt-get update

Further reading suggested that I run sudo add-apt-repository 
ppa:libreoffice/ppa

Followed by another sudo apt-get update

Synaptic still shows 4.0.1.2, but doesn't show 3.5.2.

More web research recommended that I run sudo apt-get install 
libreoffice libreoffice-gnome

That installed 4.0.1.2.


What did I miss? How do I install 3.5.2 and not 4.0.1.2?

Thanks.

It was about 10th and Burnside, on the NW corner of the intersection. A
small shop, run by a pleasant older fellow. He specialized in cables. I
went there a couple times to buy SCSI cables with different
configurations on each end. SCSI sucked for compatibility, but was the
fastest thing I could get at a time when I was trying to do DTP on
Windows NT 3.5 with a massively expensive 5 GB hard drive. The fellow
knew his cables.

Portland Linux/Unix Group Advanced Topics Meeting Announcement

Who: Chris Cappuccio
What: flashrd+nsh OpenBSD Network Appliances
Where: Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th Avenue, Portland (Left Entrance)
When: Tuesday, March 19th, 2013 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of technology freedom


flashrd+nsh: OpenBSD imaging and easy configuration for network 
appliances and virtual environments

Installation, upgrade and configuration are important, practical 
functions. OpenBSD's reputation for advanced networking functionality is 
second only to its reputation for having a tight knit development 
community which considers these functions first and foremost a 
convenience for developers.

In this session, we'll discuss the use and application of the flashrd 
and nsh tools for creating networking system images catered to 
deployment  by IT staff, consultants and OEMs. We'll also discuss 
OpenBSD networking features and applications that can be instrumented by 
nsh, and discuss any general OpenBSD features and history, as desired by 
you, the participants.

Chris Cappuccio is a systems and network architect, with 16 years of 
experience starting as a Unix system administrator, followed up with 
extensive IP, DSL, wireless and SS7 network deployment and operation. 
Chris owns and operates Yellowknife, a wireless network provider 
covering thousands of square miles of unserved and underserved areas 
with high performance Internet access. He has been a part-time 
contributor to networking and driver services in the OpenBSD operating 
system for 14 years.

10th and Couch, Gary Grosshoeme.  He died of complications from
an infection - which affected his mind, interfering with proper
treatment, and then his heart, affecting his mortality.  Nature
is an asshole sometime.

An excellent fellow, I spent perhaps 100 hours over the years at his
shop talking about this and that, and bought way too many cables.

Imagine the shame of showing up at Bar Camp ( http://barcampportland.org/ )
with a laptop running M$ Windoze.  Your geek cred will be destroyed forever!

Save your reputation!  Bring your laptop (or your desktop, if you
want to haul /that/ to Bar Camp) to Free Geek at 1pm through 5pm
on Sunday, March 17 and we will help you replace boring old Windows
with wonderful new Ubuntu, Fedora, Slackware, Mint, or zillions of
other Linux or BSD distros.  

We've got wired and wireless internet, distros, keyboards, displays,
mice, hot coffee, hot geeks, and various munchables.  We gather
every third Sunday (yes, it's that time already) at Free Geek,
1731 SE 10th Ave., in Portland two blocks south of Hawthorne.

That is, if John shows up with the key - he may have raptured
into open source linguistic heaven.  If so, we'll commandeer
some tables over at Lucky Lab.

I certainly plan to. If you're a Linux guru we can use your help this
time as I will be doing some repairs of my own and may not have as much
time to help others as usual.

This is from journalist Dan Gillmor.
Anyone?

I've made the transition to Linux fairly smoothly, but one of the things I miss most from the Mac ecosystem is the
ability to create encrypted sparse bundle disk images. This technique breaks up a large file (or directory or
collections of folders) into a directory of smaller encrypted chunks -- files -- and it grows as the amount data you put
into it grows. 

This is particularly useful for online backup (e.g. Dropbox) for two reasons: First, the only items that change are
particular files, not the entire thing, so it's bandwidth friendly. Second, given the relatively poor security record at
Dropbox -- which I like a lot for most purposes -- this is much safer.

I've seen nothing to compare to this on Linux. Does anyone know of anything to match it? I hope the Linux community is
working on a way to replicate this incredibly useful tool.

Linux does not "spoon feed" you advanced utilities.  You need to think
out side the box and learn what is actually the process

Try:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EncFS
http://www.arg0.net/encfs

For Ubuntu:
http://www.howtogeek.com/121737/how-to-encrypt-cloud-storage-on-linux-and-windows-with-encfs/

Other distros will have it in their repos as well.  There are various
front end GUIs, tray applets, depending on your system (PAM, ...) and
setup instructions for GDM, etc.

Linux has had a number of encrypted file systems for ages.  Any one of
which can be used to upload to the "cloud."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptographic_file_systems

Have fun.

The best way is to get Clear's standalone modem/router. then it's just an
ethernet cable. their little USB access device is non-trivial to get
working last I checked. things may have changed since then, for better or
worse.

It depends on your dongle.  I had one (galen still has it?) that
worked out of the box on you-dumb-too.  Drivers vary, so depending on
your dongle it may or may not work for you.

Well, sort of brute force resolved.

I successfully migrated myself to my other machine running Ubuntu 12.04 
and so have made the need to undo the LibreOffice update moot, since 
12.04 uses 3.5.2.

Message-ID: <514503B3.604@comcast.net>

I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 with gnome-session-fallback. I have an nVidia 
card and two monitors. The annoying feature is that when I drag a window 
to the secondary monitor, if I get the top of the window too close to 
the top of the screen, the window maximizes itself. This is annoying 
because it means I lose the use of a title bar's worth of the screen.

Does anyone know if this "feature" can be turned off? Does it have a 
name? If I knew what it was called I'd have a much better time searching 
for info about it.

Thanks for any hints.

This sounds a bit like this utility:

You might want to check it out.  Caveats: I don't use it, know next to 
nothing about it, use at own risk, etc.

Well, they start out okay, but don't finish okay.

The instructions say to run Synaptic, mark something to be installed, 
select the version I want with Force Version.

So far so good. But, when I try to install liberoffice 1.3.5.7 it complains:

         Could not mark all packages for installation or upgrade.

There are a lot of packages related to libreoffice. When I try to force 
the version of a few of them it complains about others. When I try to 
force the version of a lot of them, some of them revert to 1.4.0.1. It 
seems rather circular.

Sigh.

Great for SCSI cables and he would give these words of wisdom:

Subject: [PLUG] Samba access - different results from different machines
Message-ID: <51464615.6030100@comcast.net>

On my network I have three Ubuntu machines -- two 10.04 and one 12.04, 
and a Windows 7 machine. When I try to access the Win7 machine from one 
of the 10.04 machines or from the 12.04 machine I'm asked for a 
password. I'm not asked for a password when trying to access the Win7 
machine from the other 10.04 machine. I'd like to set things up so that 
all of the machines are able to access the shared directories of any of 
the other machines. I don't know how to phrase the question for Mr. 
Google. I get lots of instructions for installing Samba, but nothing 
that covers my question.

Recommended reading?

Thanks.

Google: BAH!

To have Linux boxes talk to Windows and vice versa, you need to set up
SAMBA.  Everything SAMBA does on Linux is controlled via settings in
/etc/samba/smb.conf

You have to make sure that all users/machines are in the same
workgroup, netbios name, security (user and group), etc.  The Ubuntu
boxes will need to have the SAMBA server service running and the Win7
box will need to be configured properly.

This can be a nontrivial exercise: I often find setting up Linux-Linux
a heck of a lot easier than Linux-Windows.  MS often breaks things
between versions. Of course, in Linux, sharing via NFS is superior -
but that is another story.

Best place to start is:

http://www.samba.org/samba/what_is_samba.html
http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/
http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/using_samba/toc.html

Then

http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/

This is another nice HOWTO:

http://www.oregontechsupport.com/samba/

After the above, you'll be a SAMBA master, easily browsing and
mounting smb and cifs shares!

Have fun.

So you can access the SMB share from all of the hosts but one doesn't
require a password and the other do?

Are you sure you have the same level of access to the drive after
authenticating?

If all of that is true I think he may be correct to say see what differs in
the smb.conf file between the hosts.

Another idea would be to see what happens when you create a file on the win
box from the different clients.  See who the windows box thinks the
owner/creator of the file is.  Then you could also look into file share
logging on the windows host.

very applicable and and also very well documented.

Just for grins, you don't have a .smbmount file in your home directory on
the server that lets you log in, do you?  That file has your username /
password to log you into a samba server.

i noticed this too. It's like the annoying "maximize when close to the 
screen edge" behavior in MS Windows 7 (although i bet there's a goofy 
name for it).

One of the first things i did in 12.04 was install Compiz Config 
Settings Manager, so i could load my old tweaked settings from 10.10. 
Loading old settings was a big mistake, as it boke Unity altogether ( i 
was able to login to Gnome fallback and fix it). Anyway, i used CCSM to 
examine all the window-management settings. The "Snapping Windows" 
plugin controls this behavior and defaults to ON. It's a simple chekbox 
to disable the plugin altogether.

HTH,
Joe

a bit of followup - the Compiz Grid plugin also implements this 
behavior, and my also need to be disabled.

As much as i enjoy the functionality and eye candy offeredb by Compiz 
plugins and the Extras package, it can turn into a real unstable mess if 
one gets carried away with customizations. It's more fragile if you're 
using Unit, which itself is currently implemented as a Compiz plugin.

I successfully set this up with CentOS 6 (I forget which kernel, and
I've since canceled my service) without any configuration or voodoo on
my part.

Nice.  And you can see what version of an app is being hosted there 
(could not see any way to find that out via the app store except 
installing it.)

Also, donate links for each app (sadly, via 100 different micropayment 
schemes and currencies at 10% fees.)

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1303190724050.21910@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Last week I was able to run alsamixer as a user on the Sony Vaio; this
morning I cannot because the system tells me that there is no such file or
directory as alsamixer, even when passed the absolute path of
/usr/bin/alsamixer. Root has no problems with this file. The permissions are
755 so a user should be able to execute it. If the distribution is applicable
it's Slackware-14.0/x86_64 will all security patches applied.

   The man page does not seem to help me; command line options are
ineffective if the executable cannot be found. Web searches for 'alsamixer
not found' and 'alsamixer not found for user' did not return anything
relevant.

   There must be a simple reason for this but I have difficulty finding the
reason and solution.

Hmm. I'll have to see if that happens on my wife's Win 7 machine.

Thanks. One day I might take a look at that. I found another solution -- 
Gnome Classic no effects.

There are only a couple of things I notice that are different, and 
neither of them matter to me. One is that at the bottom right hand of 
the primary screen the set of workspace boxes in Gnome Classic is 
condensed into a smaller area. In Gnome Classic no effects it returned 
to the horizontal group of four small boxes, one for each of four 
workspaces. I make use of two, so I might change that someday.

The other thing I notice is that the Firefox Downloads box in the 
application list at the bottom of the screen doesn't have an odd 
coloration when using Gnome Classic no effects. Sometimes I have 
occasion to download several things with Firefox at one sitting. When I 
do this I minimize the little window FF opens showing me my downloads. 
Then, when I'm done, I can clear that list once. When using Gnome 
Classic that box, in the bottom bar with all the running applications, 
has a weird appearance where it's partly colored funny on the top half 
of the box. When I click on it the weird color goes away. With Gnome 
Classic no effects that weirdness is no longer there. No loss to me.

So far I haven't found that there's anything I miss when using Gnome 
Classic no effects.

   Update: running 'file /usr/bin/alsamixer' shows it's a 64-bit ELF using
shared libraries. Running 'ldd /usr/bin/alsamixer' shows me that all
libraries are found.

   What other tests can I run to find why this tool works for root but not
for a user? Do I need to make permissions for /usr 777?

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu suspend/wake issue
Message-ID: <CAHjep=wLje-zscNpqOQeTJb81qS2TNCkJgDQEjF3dgHfU-nUMw@mail.gmail.com>

My ubuntu-running X201 thinkpad (running the latest Ubuntu), has recently
developed a problem after updating.

When I wake the machine (by opening the lid) it wakes up just long enough
to show the lock screen, then it goes back to sleep.

I can then wake it up by pressing the power button and everything behaves
normally until I put it to sleep again (by closing the lid), and I have the
same issue waking it up again.

This has turned out to be a frustrating thing to search for, since there is
a long and sordid history of sleep/resume problems with Ubuntu.

Further complicating issues, I'm running XFCE, with Xmonad as the window
manager and xfce4-power-manager.

Does anyone have debugging suggestions?  I've included a bit from my syslog
showing the end of the first wake, and the subsequent sleep, but it doesn't
look very informative to me.

Thanks!
Rogan

-- It's not clear whether or not the alsamixer executable file actually
exists because you say root has no problems and the user perms are set to
755. Is there an alsamixer file in  /usr/bin that can be executed as the
root user?

As a test can you execute "amixer" as a non-root user?

Permissions should stay at 755. This could be caused by any number of
glitches: udev rules, audio group, no access to /var/lib/alsa...

Rather that wrestle with it, go to your Slackware DVD, mount and do
(as root, and if in a user login shell then use "su -"):

upgradepkg --reinstall slackware64/ap/alsa-utils-1.0.26-x86_64-1.txz

or

upgradepkg --reinstall slackware/ap/alsa-utils-1.0.26-i486-1.txz

depending on if you are 64 bit or 32.

Mike,

   I must not have been clear: /usr/bin/alsamixer exists. There is only one
/alsamixer, usr/bin/alsamixer. Root can run this tool but a user cannot. The
/perms of usr/bin/alsamixer are 755 and it's owned by root.root

   Nope. Same results as with alsamixer. Both amixer and alsamixer are in
/usr/bin. A user can find them with 'locate' but cannot run them.

-- If it's true that the alsamixer executable file does exist and you can
execute it as root but not as a non-root user than run the *"id
<user>"* command
to verify if your user is in the audio group.

*mannix at mc-crunch:~$ id mannix*
id mannix
uid=1000(mannix) gid=1000(mannix)
groups=1000(mannix),20(dialout),24(cdrom),25(floppy),27(sudo),*29(audio)*
,30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev),100(users),107(netdev),108(bluetooth),109(fuse),112(powerdev)

Then verify that all the files in /dev/snd belong to the audio group.

crw-rw----+  1 root audio 116,  5 Mar 18 16:59 controlC0
crw-rw----+  1 root audio 116,  4 Mar 18 16:59 hwC0D0

Rogan,

Was the kernel upgraded?  If so, can you downgrade it to the
previous version?  To be honest, this looks like a kernel problem
to me.  NetworkManager successfully started, then it looks like
something immediately told it to shut down again -- probably
whatever it was that told the rest of the system to shut down.
Unfortunately, the syslog doesn't say what that was.  :-(  (And
I've always found NM's syslog messages to be quite inscrutable.)

I would try downgrading the kernel, if you can, and see if that
fixes it.  If so, you get to file a bug report.  :-)  You might
try asking on the Ubuntu IRC channel (#ubuntu on irc.freenode.net,
I think), or the Ubuntu support forums.

I'm sorry I can't help more, but that's all I can think of.

I don't know where your particular problem comes from, but on my
older T60 thinkpad the suspend/resume problems (and occasional X
startup problems) seem related to the incomplete capture and
restoration of device state, especially the wifi chip and the
ATI graphics chip. 

Your X201 has integrated Intel graphics.  The graphics chip
designers at Intel Folsom are less open-source friendly than
most other Intel sites.  If the Ubuntu resume problem affects
all laptops, the graphics won't be the problem, but if it is
X201 specific, and also happens with the wifi turned off, 
that is where I would start looking.

One other laptop-specific issue might be how the X201 handles
the lid opening.  The lid position is sensed with some kind
of mechanical switch, and switches bounce and rattle on the
microsecond time scale.  That may be filtered by firmware,
or it may be sent unfiltered to the OS.  If the Ubuntu kernel
sees something like "open ... no, closed again! ... no, open"
it might do what you describe, perhaps suspending with a
second suspend event remaining in the event queue. 

If you configure Ubuntu to suspend and resume only when it
sees a function key, not a lid event, you will need extra
steps to suspend or resume, but you will have more control
and reliability.  That is how I configure suspend/resume on
my laptops, because T30 and T60 lid events are too flaky.
That did not rid me of suspend problems (see graphics
musings above) but it reduced them a lot.

Any chance NetworkManager and the xfce4 power manager are dueling with 
each other?

Ed,

   Adding the user to the audio group makes no difference. User and list
files in /var/lib/alsa.

   Makes no difference. Still 'no file or directory found' as a user.

Mike,

   I added the user to the audio group. And my sincere apologies to Ed: I did
not reboot after adding the user.

   Having rebooted, sound now works.

   I should have known to add the user to the audio group and then reboot the
host.

Mea culpa!

Sometimes it's the obvious stuff that bites us in the rump.  Also,
although reboot will work (as in Windows "when in doubt, reboot"),
simply logging out then logging back in will do it.

rebooting....how quaint and retro... ;-)

Ed,

   I considered just logging out and back in, but did not know if that
sourced /etc/group. Since the Sony Vaio is a laptop it is used to being
rebooted and I knew that would cause the appropriate utilities to re-read
the group file.

> rebooting....how quaint and retro... ;-)

   Actually, she leaves the laptop on for days at a time.

To test after making a group change, you could also do something like
'su - richard'.  This will give you a new login shell.  You can then use 
the groups command to confirm your group membership.  There are probably 
other ways as well, like ssh -X localhost.

galen,

   Thank you. I'll save this, but will try to avoid a 'next time' by adding
users to groups when a tool doesn't work.

I'm not sure how to figure that out...  I'll try disabling network manager
if I have time today and see if that helps.

Dale - I'm not sure if the kernel was upgraded; and I'm unfortunately not
sure /when/ this happened.  It's been going on for a while, and I've tried
to resolve it by upgrading again at least twice.

It does seem to be related to the lid switch, or the way the lid switch
puts the system to sleep.  If I suspend the machine via the power icon in
the xfce panel, then I can close the lid (while it's suspended) and opening
the lid wakes the machine correctly (and it stays woken up).

Are you by any chance also running systemd?  There's a cross-distro issue
involving XFCE and systemd fighting over suspend:

I don't /think/ I'm running systemd.  It's not showing up in a 'dpkg --list
| grep systemd', or any process lists (although I really don't know what it
is, so perhaps it's elsewhere...). I do, however, have an /etc/systemd
directory, although it doesn't contain the files to modify

 Since the directory existed, and the fix referenced in the forum you
linked to amounted to uncommenting lines (and tweaking the values...) I
went ahead and created /etc/systemd/logind.conf with the following contents:

HandlePowerKey=ignore
HandleSuspendKey=ignore
HandleHibernateKey=ignore
HandleLidSwitch=ignore

then rebooted and tried a sleep/resume cycle with the lid, to no avail,
which I think supports the idea that I'm not running systemd, and the
/etc/systemd directory may be a redherring.

Since Linux is a not thankfully not M$ Windoze, I wondered why you
would have to force user to logout to affect this change. If one did
this as a Linux Admin where developers were knee deep in work this
would not be very well received.

The way to do this without disrupting the user is to use the "newgrp" command:
$newgrp - audio

>From newgrp man page:
     "The newgrp command is used to change the current group ID during
a login session.
       If the optional - flag is given, the user's environment will be
reinitialized as
       though the user had logged in, otherwise the current
environment, including
       current working directory, remains unchanged.

       newgrp changes the current real group ID to the named group, or
to the default
       group listed in /etc/passwd if no group name is given.  newgrp
also tries to add
       the group to the user groupset."

Mike,

   I tried 'source /etc/group' but that did nothing useful. I was completely
unaware of the newgrp command, as I am completely unaware of thousands of
other linux commands. Heck, I would not have known to look for such a
command, either.

   Good to know.

Thanks very much,

If you 1) put laptop to sleep with lid close, 2) wake laptop with lid open
event, wait for suspend, close lid again, 3) wake laptop with lid open
event...

Does the laptop go back to sleep again?  If so, open and close the lid a
few more times and then try using the power button to wake it.  Does it
only take one power button press to keep it awake, or does the system queue
up additional suspend requests?  I'm trying to figure out the lid close is
creating multiple sleep events, or if it's the lid open or resume process
that's triggering the subsequent sleeps.

Do you have an external monitor connected when performing the
suspend/resume?  Does it make a difference?

Can you try suspending the system while the dbus-monitor is running and see
if it produces anything interesting?  You should run each of these commands
separately during the suspend (I'm not sure what you're using so only one
might give something useful):
dbus-monitor --session "interface='org.freedesktop.PowerManagement'"
dbus-monitor --system "interface='org.freedesktop.DeviceKit'"
dbus-monitor --system "interface='org.freedesktop.UPower'"

If the above doesn't work, try without the interface (might produce a lot
of noise):
dbus-monitor --system
dbus-monitor --session

If you have the "acpi_listen" command installed, try running that and then
suspending to see what that produces.  Also

Is there a way in XFCE power manager to disable suspend on lid close?  If
so, and you disable suspend, does closing the lid still trigger a suspend?

Rich,
Actually, 'newgrp' is not appropriate in your case and can lead to
unintended consequences.  The appropriate fix was to add group 'audio'
to your user, and log out the log in. Make sure you check the fine
points of the docs.

Great idea!

I was able to separately set the behavior for lid events when on power vs.
on battery (that distinction has not had any impact in the past -- plugged
in, not plugged in, it had the same problem).  Disabling the suspend on lid
close via the xfce widget on battery but not when plugged in made it easy
to compare.

Indeed, it made a difference, too.  The laptop still suspended when the lid
was closed, regardless.  However, when suspending while on battery, it woke
up correctly, and stayed that way. (while the same test with power plugged
in caused the issue I came here to resolve).

I've disabled suspend-on-lid close in both situations, and it looks like
it's working fine now.

I haven't gone through your other suggestions, because this week is hectic,
and, well, this is a suitable workaround for me.

Thanks for the help!

Hi All,

I once caved to a clients request and helped them setup an Asterisk 
Appliance from Trixbox.

Since that fateful day, even though I am not an expert by any means and 
make no money
from the endless time spent, they call me when they want something changed.

I'm hoping that someone on this list has some knowledge and spare time 
that would like
a consulting gig with this client.

They will pay money, I just don't charge them as they spent elsewhere.

Please let me know if you are interested, they are in need of some 
updates to the system
and I won't be able to help them this time around.

Thanks,

-Bill Ensley

Subject: [PLUG] avconv -f x11grab tool question
Message-ID: <CAJeYwHdZfsvAF+uoUjaAnRGz58wWdYK1VjjgySVqWMsU2eotxg@mail.gmail.com>

I am attempting to create mpg or avi movies directly from a window on
my Ubuntu 12.04 LTS system.  The display monitor is a 1920x1080p
digital unit and the output from geomview of the rotating spherical
polygon and unit sphere look 3d when viewing the monitor.

However when I use "avconv -f x11grab -b 500k -s vga -r 30 -i
:0,0+738,98 out.mpg" to capture this window, the video capture ends up
with poor quality, and has distracting jerky green rectangular
blotches flashing in the movie.  The video itself has poor definition,
like viewing through frosted glass and slightly out of focus.

If we know exactly where the frame buffer is, for the window (which
xwininfo does provide) why cannot we get the exact video memory
capture of this window??

What can I do to improve the video quality?  It seems peculiar that
using a digital display that such a poor quality mpg resulted.  Is the
video codec the problem?  It wants to use the yuv420p video codec, not
the bgra.

I also rename the output file to out.mkv and that has improved the
quality of the video capture, but it still is out of focus and moire
effects are visible.  Searching the avconv documentation about yuv420p
doesn't turn up much.

Thanks for your suggestions.

Randall

Yes, it's still here.  It appears to work without any extra effort on my 
Ubuntu 12.04 laptop.

BTW Russell, the Clear web site says they want it back, so perhaps I 
should get it to you before the next meeting.

Quality of the capture is governed by your CPU speed and settings.
Your best bet is to capture raw video and then convert to the
appropriate format.  avconv tries to guess based on output file
extension (see -codecs and -formats). The container format will also
define the codec as well as default options.  For the mpeg1video codec
yuv420p is the default color space pixel format. BGR is for the raw
video stream.

As I am not in the libav camp, I use ffmpeg (IMHO, it is better;
avconv will have similar options).  Replicating your settings also
provides a poor quality, pixelated movie:

$ ffmpeg -f x11grab -b:v 500k -bufsize 500k -s vga -r 30 -i :0.0+10,50
screenGrab.mpg

ffmpeg output:

General maintenance.

It's also likely time to upgrade asterisk itself on the box.

I'm happy to make the introduction and go over with you what I had done
when setting them up.

They really just need someone that wants to work on this type of box and
can actually help them when needed.  They call about twice a year for some
type of maintenance/phone addition/menu question.

My contact is actually quite adept at getting around, he just doesn't know
anything about the config files and setup.

They get their copper lines from Integra and they have made some changes
several times to the lines that have needed some reconfiguring of the
asterisk scripts for the trunks a few times.

Integra of course denies they ever change anything...

Let me know,

Subject: [PLUG] pthreads starvation or blocking issue
Message-ID: <CAJeYwHc4oRMJiquYKvaXAM-k+AGTHo8g74OSSQtnp7OwM_veJA@mail.gmail.com>

I have 3 programs, each one uses one pthread, containing a delay loop,
using the nanosleep() call.  At the end of the loop, a line of output
is written to a file.  The programs work great when they are the only
user tasks running on the system (which is a 12 core Intel Core I7
Extreme X 990 running 3.47 Ghz)

However, despite putting the pthread programs at -10 nice priority,
whenever I do other user tasks on the computer, even if I set those
tasks at a +10 priority, strange hold ups occur and it seems like the
pthread was put to sleep, sometimes for up to 1 second before
execution resumes, which is an incredible delay when compared to the
processor's sub-nanosecond clock cycle and this system's computing
capacity.

Is there any way of making sure that the pthreads don't suspend?  Get
a RT linux OS ?

Can pthreads be made non-blockable?  The pthreads need to be reliable
for about an 8 hour run and must keep a reliable time delay without
gaps occurring.

Hm, it's a bit late in the month for the full moon to be causing
trouble, so it must be that other favorite random failure
generator, sunspots.  Or perhaps gremlins.  I've always favored
sunspots, though.  I've found the threat of being tortured to
death with a hot soldering iron to be surprisingly effective in
making a recalcitrant machine toe the line once more.

Geeky humour aside, John, this sounds rather like X11 has stopped
working.  That would account for the loss of video, as well as the
keyboard and mouse.  Have you checked your log files?  The one
most likely to have some useful information is /var/log/messages.
However, dmesg and ~/.xsession-errors may have something.

Can you log in (via ssh) to your desktop from the laptop?  If you
can, then, when the DVD player crashes, if you can still use your
network connection, you can check to see what has hung.  If it is
X, you can restart it.  Of course, if your network connection goes
south at the same time, then you know you've got something rather
more fundamental gone wrong.  On the other paw, it might be your
DVD player; which one are you using?  (Not likely, I admit, but it
is possible.)

For that matter, is the keyboard really hung?  Can you use
<alt><ctrl>F4 to switch to a VT?  This has happened to me, where
my keyboard appeared not to be working, but in fact it was just X.
If so, you could then find out what's going on from there, and
maybe get things running again.

Anyway, that's all I've got right now (unless you want more bad
jokes, of course).  We're probably going to need more information
from you to get a handle on this one.

Good Luck, and don't feed the gremlins.

Once I rebooted I looked at /var/log/messages, but found nothing that
looked related. However, now that you mention it, I agree that it
sounds a lot like X quit working.

I don't think it was the DVD player because I left the audio running
for 15 minutes before giving up and rebooting. I don't think VLC caches
that much audio, so it must have been still reading the drive. But that
is just my WAG.

I have heard of logging into a computer via SSH many times, but have
never learned how to do it. My laptop is sitting next to the desktop
and both are on the home ethernet, so I assume it is possible.

In the past I have had occasions where using SSH might have been
helpful. Learning how to use SSH might be a good education topic for a
Clinic.

I tried Ctrl-Alt-Del, which brings up either a logout window or a task
manager in some distros. I also tried Ctrl-Alt-F1 and -F2 in the hopes
of getting to a command line, but neither worked. From past experience
the former worked on Ubuntu distros and the latter worked on my Fedora
laptop. I didn't go higher on the function keys. 

If this happens again I will exert more effort to get to a command line
and try restarting X.

ASUS P8B-C/4L

I doubt you'll find a motherboard with Firewire and many PCI slots. 
Firewire is more common on consumer motherboards, while lots of PCI 
slots is more of a server motherboard feature.

Tyan and Supermicro have products with many PCI slots, but they may be 
unavailable at this point.

Is there anything in $HOME/.xsessions-errors?  I rather doubt that
there is, but there might be.

Hah!  Yeah, I don't think that VLC caches that much audio either.
A few seconds, maybe, but no more.  VLC is also one of the most
stable AV players I've used.  I was afraid you were using
something like Totem (*shudder*).

Not a bad idea.  The main thing is getting a set of keys on each
machine, and then exchanging the public keys.  I always have to
read through the man pages to get that set up correctly.  After
that, using ssh is quite easy.  "ssh user at remote-host" will log
you in to your account on "remote-host".  As I recall, there is 
also a way to start a remote X session via ssh.  I've never tried
it, though, so I don't have any pointers.

I used F4 simply because that key is out of the way of the usual
F1, F2, F7 keys that X11 is started from.  Another key combo you
could try is <ctrl><alt><backspace> to kill and restart X11.
Sometimes that key chord is inhibited, and sometimes is isn't.
Depends on the distro and the release.  Check your keyboard layout
preferences to be sure it's enabled.  (I've had to use that one
more than once!)

Best of luck.  Finding the cause of intermittent problems like
this can be hard.  Very satisfying when you do, though.  :-)

True, you can use ssh but on a local network the names of the machines
will probably not be shared so you will need to either add it to the hosts file
or create a name entry in the router where it can point to the machine
by name.  Otherwise you will need to use the IP address.
Here are the clues needed to generate the keys and copy them.

Can you reproduce it? If its possible for you to reproduce you could
gather a trace or even review logs and file a bug on whatever package
is causing the lock up which would help Ubuntu Developers like myself
get it sorted out.

HI All,

I had some email trouble this week so I might have missed responses to this
Asterisk request.

I have a paying client that needs help with their Asterisk Trixbox 
Appliance.

Any takers?

Thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] Sound card for Ubuntu
Message-ID: <5154B5AD.5060009@martinconsulting.com>

Dear Pluggers,

I have a motherboard with dead on-board audio, so I'm looking for an 
inexpensive PCI-e sound card.  I've found a surprising number that don't 
work or don't work well with Ubuntu 12.04.  The HCLs and similar 
documents are surprisingly sparse in their lists of known good brands 
and models.  I just need jacks for stereo output and microphone input.  
If any of you are running Ubuntu 12.04 or earlier and have a PCI-e sound 
card that is working well, would you please let me know what you're using?

                                     -Brian

Does it have to be PCI-e? I'm using an old Creative Labs Sound Blaster 
Live! in my machine. It worked in my older machine running Ubuntu 10.04, 
and it works in my current machine running Ubuntu 12.04. I've seen them 
offered for cheap on the web, ($5?) although I don't recall where I was 
looking when I saw that.

Free Geek has a whole collection of good Creative labs Sound Blaster
live, audigy and audigy2. I haven't seen any pci-e just pci. If you
have a free regular Pci slot, try one of them. Also support is very
good. Just get rid of pulseaudio!

Really?

I'm no longer interested, but at one time I wanted a sound card. I went
to Free Geek Thrift Store about once a week for a couple months and
never found a single sound card. Thinking I might be looking in the
wrong place I asked several times at the counter, only to hear "we
don't get sound cards very often."

I suggest you call first. Or wait until you have another reason to go
to Free Geek so you won't waste a trip.

Hello all,

I'll have a meeting announcement shortly!

The time has finally come that the PLUG server must move ASAP.

Lifetime PLUG member Joe Pruett has agreed to host the site and lists 
and they should more or less drop into place.

Please speak now about if you think we should keep some lower-traffic 
(some just spam) lists:

KEEP:

PLUG	General Linux/UNIX discussion and help; civil and on-topic
PLUG-announce	Meeting and other announcements (not job postings)
PLUG-jobs	Help Wanted and Work Needed

KEEP?

PLUG-devel	Technical discussion re: Software & Product Development
PLUG-RideShare	Ride Sharing to events
PLUG-talk	Off-topic and potentially flammable discussion
PLUG-test	Test posts here
PLUG-web	www.pdxlinux.org related discussion

Thoughts?

Thanks!

Michael, David, Wil and Joe

Sadly, I only have one PCI slot, and it is required by another card.

Wacky. I was just at Free Geek a few days ago. They had a huge stack
of Audigy and Audigy2 among others.

Absolutely keep PLUG-talk. It is essential.

The rest are useless or unnecessary. E.g., PLUG-test can be eliminated;
there are only a couple posts a year, so just put up with an occasional
post in the other lists. Ditto for the others.

Mozilla Socorro: an Open Source crash reporting system evolves.

Socorro collects and analyzes three million crash reports a day 
employing PostgreSQL, HBase, Hadoop, and ElasticSearch glued together 
with Python. Socorro's data analysis drives the stability and 
development priorities of Firefox.  Five years ago, Socorro was a system 
that ran on three machines and was tended by just one person.  In 2013, 
it has evolved to become a distributed system running on 120 machines 
and serving hundreds of terabytes of data.  Meanwhile, companies all 
over the world are adopting Socorro for crash reporting.  This talk, an 
update of one given several years ago, will track the evolution of 
Socorro and its future in the upcoming world of FirefoxOS.


K Lars Lohn is the Herd Patriarch of the Mozilla WebTools Group.  As the 
author and curator of the Mozilla Socorro Crash Reporting System, Lars 
has driven its evolution.  Formerly with the OSUOSL, Lars telecommutes 
for Mozilla from a farm near Corvallis.  While preferring Python, 
PostgreSQL and Harleys, Lars is versed in C++, MySQL and Subarus.

Subject: [PLUG] concerned about strange logical partition error occurring on
	hard drive
Message-ID: <CAJeYwHc+TepRfP1SKzdeON=g0XZdUwVOAvQKJAE5hsBOb2_VaQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have a Western Digital WD10EARS Caviar disk drive that comes up with
a strange Extended Partition Offset is misaligned by 1024 bytes when I
have formatted the drive using Disk Utility and with GParted.  Should
I be concerned about this?

About 4 days ago the system started acting strange and getting general
protection faults (Intel Processor)

I rebooted with a standalone version of linux and the hardware seemed
okay, until I started to check the drives, the software was unable to
remove the swap partition from the logical partition.

Finally I was able to reformat the whole drive, but the Disk Utility
under Ubuntu keeps warning me about a misaligned extended logical
parition boundary being off by 1024 bytes.

I don't know what to do about this?  Is this a wierd error from the
Disk Utility itself? I don't want to run with a drive in an unknown
condition.  Are there any utilities that will correctly check the
drive?

Thanks for your suggestions

Subject: [PLUG] drive appears bad
Message-ID: <CAJeYwHcn_CwzBCCeFsYiv9Rmi9FRiWwAcLpBghyEpZdsac-K7g@mail.gmail.com>

In regard to my question of using the drive or not, I attempted to run
with a freshly installed system, and only got about 5 minutes into the
run, when a solid system freeze was encountered.

The drive is going to get replaced.

I am still curious at to the 1024 byte offset alignment error for the
extended partition.

PLUG and PLUG-talk are the only two that I use.

Sounds like we have consensus from the various posts/votes.

I would hop over to http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php and
create a gparted live boot CD or USB drive.  Besides parted/gparted,
the live distro includes a number of tools to test and repair a hard
drive - as long as there is no mechanical or electrical problem.

Interesting, was not aware of PLUG-talk mailing list.  From the
responses, sounds like I missed some interesting discussions on that
mailing list. ;-)

Cheers,
Jeff

Mike,

   You must not be the only one. I posted questions there a couple of times
without anyone responding. So I stopped posting there.
