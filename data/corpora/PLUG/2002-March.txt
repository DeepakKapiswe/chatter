 I never use Nautilus or Midnight Commander, since I prefer "dired" in
 XEmacs as my file manager.

Well, first of all, don't bother downloading stable.  At the earliest
opportunity, just set your /etc/apt/sources.list to what you want.  My
"unstable" box looks like this:

  deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian/ unstable main non-free contrib
  deb-src http://http.us.debian.org/debian/ unstable main non-free contrib
  deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US unstable/non-US main contrib non-free
  deb-src http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US unstable/non-US main contrib non-free

  deb http://security.debian.org/ stable/updates main contrib non-free

I also have some "testing" boxes, where the sources.list looks like:

  deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian testing main contrib non-free
  deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US testing/non-US main contrib non-free

Then pick just the packages you actually will use, and away you go.
It is very easy to apt-get others later, but until you are using them
you end up wasting time downloading incremental versions at each
apt-get upgrade for no real gain.

 <URL:http://cdimage.debian.org/>

 And,

 <URL:http://drizzle.pdxlinux.org/~karlheg/>

 ... contains a slightly modified woody netinst that supports ext2,
 ext3, and reiserfs.  It's just the latest netinst shown on the first
 site above, but with only the "bf2.4" flavor made bootable, since
 some machines don't support multiple boot images on one CD.

 The only install method (for the "Base System") that (29Mb) image
 supports is "network".  The only hardware driver you need to worry
 about is your network card.  You must pick it from the list and
 "manually" install it before it will offer "Configure the Network" as
 the next step.  If you have a DSL line, it will take around 30
 minutes or so at most for "debootstrap" to run.

 After the base is installed, you will reboot.  It will offer to run a
 "Task Selector".  Run that if you like.  Next, it will offer to run
 "dselect".  I recommend saying No there, and then, when you log in as
 root at the end of whatever else it does, you should run:

  # apt-get install {apt,debconf}-utils aptitude
  # dpkg-reconfigure -plow debconf
  # aptitude

 ... and choose what you want installed after reading the
 instructions.

 "aptitude" is a package manager interface.  It's a lot easier to use
 than the venerable "dselect".

Interesting. Yeah, sftp is available with openssh, and you can compile
it against the pam libs (which I suspect most distros do as a matter of
course). Pam is one of those "I've been meaning to look into it for a
really long time now" things -- but your suggestions sounds interesting.

Here is how I installed up to testing.

Using debian(stable)-reiserfs boot disks, I installed the base system
over the Internet.  When asked wether I wanted simple or advanced method
of installing packages (one of the last questions), I choose advanced
and it took me into dselect.

I then quit, edit /etc/apt/sources.list and change all the "stable"
entries to "testing", and go back into dselect, select some software,
have it check dependencies and it upgrades the system to testing (a lot
of packages are already preselected from the pending stable-install, now
changed to testing versions).

 <URL:http://drizzle.pdxlinux.org/~karlheg/> ... contains an RPM of
 "debootstrap" that I just created using "alien --to-rpm" on the .deb
 package of it.

 You can look around inside it with "mc" if you want to ensure that it
 will not do anything horrible to your system.

 Since "debootstrap" requires only libc6 and wget, it should run just
 fine on any modern Linux machine.  RTFM, of course...

 It will create a subdirectory with the minimal base Debian installed
 inside of it.  You must be root to do this, unless it works inside of
 a "fakeroot" environment... I've never tried that.  Also, as root,
 you can "chroot" into there and run "apt-get" and whatever you like
 inside the chroot.  As long as you are "chroot" there, it cannot
 affect the rest of your system.

 Perhaps someone clever can think of a way of using this to migrate a
 system to Debian?

 If you do it, and want to test this, I recommend grabbing the "evms"
 stuff, and building a kernel (use the "kernel-package" system) that
 supports the Enterprise Volume Management System from IBM.  It seems
 to be working very well on "drizzle.pdxlinux.org".  Make sure you do
 NOT select the "maximize" option in "cfdisk" when you partition your
 drive, though, or EVMS won't work.

I have a couple of pieces of hardware that rock under Win of course,

been able to get the late-model Sidewinder joysticks or wheel mice to work?

I have a Sidewinder Precision 2 joystick and a Microsoft Laser Mouse

Subject: [PLUG] Lists should be online now!  Several new ones exist...
Message-ID: <87d6y1l79n.fsf@juniper.intra.microsharp.com>

 I think I've got the lists online finally.  It took up more of my day
 than I wanted to spend, but it's done and I learned a few lessons on
 the way.

 The subscribe/unsubscribe and user options URL is below, attached by
 the Mailman list manager.  If you go to the plain "listinfo" URL,
 you'll see a list of the lists that are available now.

 For each list you subscribe to, you must set whatever settings you
 like for that particular list.  I don't like that either...  It
 should give each subscriber a meta page to set things for all of the
 lists they are subscribed to, shouldn't it?

 Also, for those who prefer to use a News (usenet) reader for this,
 you may access them all at "news.pdxlinux.org".  This is NOT a
 newsfeed, but rather just the single access point for them, at least
 for the time being.  If you like, you can even unsubscribe from the
 email lists, and just use the usenet interface.

 I think that mail sent to the old address should find it's way here
 now.  If you missed any mail while they didn't work right, you might
 check the archive... It might have gotten there but not sent out.

Though it has some work to go, Nautilus is great! 
 
Of course there is nothing like a command line, that goes without
saying.

But in the days of OSX Nautilus is a great thing.. I use it every day.
 
GO Nautilus!!!!!

Message-ID: <004a01c1cf05$7b947ec0$6f00000a@mshome.net>

Good Morning, all
 
            I am a newbie to Linux and I am currently working on a box
that I would like to have two Nic cards in it. the system is:
 
Model  : Deskpro 4000
CPU    : Intel 166
Hard    : 2 gigs
cdrom : yes
Floppy : yes
 
O/S     : Redhat 7.1
 
I used the drivers located on the 3com site first and then a generic
driver I located that said it supported the Nic card I was using.
 
            It is configured as a NFS server as part of a project I am
doing.I want to install the 3com card (3c905b) as well as have the
integrated Nic work but when I try to install the rpm that has the drive
in it I get :
 
Modules should never use kernel-header system headers 
and 
But headers from an appropriate kernel-source
 
When I try to do "rpm -bb SPECS/bcm5700.spec" command to create the rpm
to install.if I understand the instructions correctly. If anyone has
thoughts about how to correct this let me know.thanks.

It's very unlikely you need additional drivers. The Linux kernel includes
many drivers, including 3c905b, and the RedHat distro tends to ship
every available driver as a module.

So I'd recommend forgetting additional drivers - just turn on the
network cards with what comes with RH. Loading the driver "3c90x" should
do the trick.

I don't know if this is enough information for you... it sounds like you
know how to load drivers and associate them with network devices. If
not, ask away and I'm sure more detail will be forthcoming.

Um, _which_ channel, 526 or 549? I'd like to know if my DirectTV
receiver's program guide is giving accurate information... :-)

Back in November, while trying to figure out how to run Apache on one of
my Linux machines for the benefit of other machines on my internal
network, Nathan Meyers gave me this advice:

My MS wheel mouse runs GREAT with no tweaking under RH 7.2. It was
autodetected and worked out of the box.

I'm not much of a joystick guy, though.

I have a couple of pieces of hardware that rock under Win of course,
 but since I want to run this box in Linux most of the time, has anyone
been able to get the late-model Sidewinder joysticks or wheel mice to work?

I have a Sidewinder Precision 2 joystick and a Microsoft Laser Mouse

What I did was check a box in the TCP/IP configuration to get dns
information from the host, or something like that.  I rebooted (okay, so
I use windows a lot) and it worked.

Back in November, while trying to figure out how to run Apache on one of

Subject: [PLUG] I Have "Revolution OS" on tape
Message-ID: <200203190803.g2J833L22466@clueserver.org>

The program just finished...  I have it on an SP VHS tape. We will have to 
arrange a time to watch it.

As for my review...

What I liked:

* They did a good job covering the issues of the Open Source and Free 
Software movement.

* Stallman was the best I have ever seen him through most of the movie.  (The 
scene at the end is kind of telling though...)

* The reading of the Open Letter to the Home Brew Computer Club written by 
Bill Gates had the appropreate amount of venom.

* It was a good introductory history of things in a way that you could show 
to the average person and not lose them.

What I did not like:

* The XFree86 development effort was not mentioned at all.  Neither was the 
Gnome, KDE or Perl developers.)  Leaving out the contribution of X to the 
success of Linux was a big ommision in my opinion.

* I thought Bruce Parens was starting to channel Emo Phillips throough parts 
of the film.  (Though he made lots of good points.)

* The played a PAINFUL version of the "Free Software Song" at the end of the 
movie.  (Jamie "XScreensaver and Moxilla" Zawinski labeled the song "Why 
cooperation with Richard Stallman is impossible".)

* Stallman's ego was starting to shine through at the end.

All in all, it was very good.  (Use the mute button at the end though.)

We will have to show it sometime in a place where we can drink alcohol.

Nope. It looked like they bathed him and dressed him first before putting him 
on camera.  (There is a scene towards the end where you see him a bit more 
"normal". The camera pans over to Linus playing with his daughters.)

Not certain. He is in the WeirdAl video "All About The Pentiums".

Subject: [PLUG] Linux 7.2 Printer Problem
Message-ID: <gt7ltd.m6t@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

I just installed Linux 7.2 for the first time and am having a problem.

I finally got it to access my home network and my HP laser printer with a
jetdirect card, but then it lost internet access, although it would still
sign-on to AT&T just fine, it just wouldn't access the WWW.  When I selected
"Use Hardware Address" in "Network Configuration" it started to access the
WWW with AT&T again, but now I lost the HP LAN printer as well as a local
NEC printer.  Changing the settings back makes no difference, I still can't
access the printers. I can access the LAN fine and even visit the HP
JetDirect built-in homepage.

I am getting a  " localhost.localdomain bad "  message on bootup ( I don't
know if it was there all along or just started) and it seems to be directly
connected to the printing problem.  I tried changing the settings around,
from leaving them blank to changing the names and settings, but nothing
works.

Anyone know the answer to this one?

Thanks,
Robert

I'll have you know that Linux v7.2 is, at the current rate of development,
about 25 years away.  My guess is you installed Linux v2.4.x.

I would guess further that you installed v7.2 of the Red Hat operating
system (which uses a Linux kernel and most of the GNU system), but that
could certainly be incorrect.

What's this "Network Configuration"?  What utility contains such a
configuration panel?

Off the top of my head, I think you have route problems.

FIRST, check to see that you have a line in your /etc/hosts file like
this:
127.0.0.1	localhost	localhost.localdomain

I assume you know something about the network configuration of your local
LAN.  Check the local machines routing table with `route -n` and see if
you have a network route to both the local network and the greater
internet.

Beyond that, could be several different things.

Check /proc/pci and see what IRQs are being used by the cable modem and the 
printer port. Sound like you have some sort of conflict.  (Or possibly DMA. I 
have seen that cause some weird problems.)

Do you have any ISA cards in the machine?

What do you have in /etc/hosts?

If you're running RH (can't speak for the other distros), you can restart
network services by `service network restart'. Or, go directly for the init
script...

/etc/init.d/network {start|stop|restart|reload|status|probe}

Message-ID: <20020319162314.3298.qmail@web21207.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

Just wondering if anyone had any suggestiongs for DNS
for me. I've got a server, i've got a static ip, and
aracnet wants 50$ per domain name for a set up fee.
Can anyone point to any other options or am I stuck
giving aracnet more money?

Ken

Looks like they've lowered their prices.

Another option you have with many registrars is to use their DNS - I do
this with domains registered at register.com. There are two parts to it:

1 - Set up the services you want on your server (email, Web, or whatever).

2 - Go to your registrar's configuration setup and tell it you would
like the registrar itself to host the DNS for this domain; then set up
the appropriate DNS entries to point at your server.

An alternative to step 2 is to take advantage of the DNS servers set up
by PLUG members for use by the community. (I don't remember the details,
but you'll find it in the mail archives.) In that case, you'd have your
registrar point to PLUG's DNS servers, and install your DNS entries on
those servers.

Implicit in all this is that you're not doing something that will later
bite you, like hosting services in violation of a usage agreement,
or expecting high reliability and consistent performance from DSL or
cable modem.

If you're using RH, it gets easier than that,

# service network {start|stop|restart|reload|status|probe}


/sbin/service is a pretty simple sh script.  I just looked at it and it has 
some other interesting abilities as well.

There are people with capacity available to be your secondary.  I can do the

<http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/03/13/1627217&mode=thread>

It was on last night, but that conflicted with other stuff.  I've 
programmed my TiVo to record it on Sunday.

NOTE: it is "fair use" to invite friends to your house to view the 
previously recorded movie, but it is gross copyright violation to 
commercially screen something that you recorded or borrowed. To get a 
large screening, the trick is to convince an art house cinema to just 
schedule the film for screening.

The Cinema 21 <http://www.cinema21.com/> is an especially good choice 
for this, as they have an especially good web presence maitained by 
Andrew Hall (cc'd). It being a geek film, co-marketing with the local 
geek orgs (PTP, PLUG <http://www.pdxlinux.org/> , PASA 
<http://pasa.portland.or.us/> , PORPIG 
<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/porpig/> , etc.) might be helpful both to 
ticket sales and the visibility of these groups.

What are they using for that?  Are they using CFS?

<URL:http://packages.debian.org/stable/non-us/cfs.html>

I tried it for a while several years ago, and it worked pretty good.  It 
was more trouble than it was worth though, since I don't really NEED an 
encrypted filesystem.

Does the installer offer that, or is it an add on package you select 
later?  How do they present it to you?

Subject: [PLUG] New kernel in Debian
Message-ID: <20020319200240.GA14245@boora.com>

A Debian question if you all have a moment
I'm upgrading a stock Progeny install on a PentiumII.

I just ran apt-get install kernel-image-2.4.16-686
During the install I was told to include a reference to initrd in
lilo.conf.
Since I'm running GRUB, this is what I added to menu.lst:

title Debian GNU/Linux (kernel 2.4.16)
root (hd0,1)
kernel /boot/vmlinux-2.4.26-686 root=/dev/hda2 ro
initrd /boot/initrd.img-2.4.16-686

I just copied the entries that existed and substituted the names of the
files that I found in /boot after apt-get was finished.
Did I do this right?
At the end of the install there was a reference to "initrd.img not symlink..not clobbered"
What does that mean?

Still downloading iso images. I'll let you know more when I find out.

I believe they are using the loopback crypto stuff.

CFS has the unfortunate problem of having name conflicts with portions of ssh.

Probably an option when you lay out the file systems initially.  I have not 
seen an option to "upgrade" to it on upgrade.

BTW, SuSE has had an encrypted filesystem option for a while.

Another option would be the Clinton Street Theatre.  Cinema 21 has their 
schedules done FAR in advance.  I suspect Clinton Street is a little more 
slackful.

Our group viewing it wouldn't be commercial - we wouldn't be viewing it to make money for profit off the flick, so I think we'd have that in our favor...

I don't know how to do that.  If it looking in the directory /proc/pci then 
the /pci is not there.

I don't have a /hosts in /etc.  I am looking in root and /etc has a lot of 
folders.  Am I doing this wrong or it different in Red Hat 7.2?

/etc/hosts is a text file,  it is the equivalent to the hosts file in windows, 


it is used to resolve IP addresses usually before a DNS lookup

You are right.  It is Red Hat 7.2.
I posted late at night after 5 hours of not getting it to work. I have 
heard this is how they do it in Redmond, WA.

I have the /etc but no /hosts.  I hope this is a change in Red Hat and not

And if it dealt with memory issues, it would be posted to plug.leaks.

And security issues would go to plug.holes.

And rants about the cost of proprietary software would go to plug.drains.

And rants about the value of proprietary software would go in plug.nickel.

And promotion of the user group would go in plug.plug.

(And then there is the list for the people who maintain the Perl

I doubt that any linux distro has a /hosts directory or file (notice the slash before hosts, that means that it is either a directory on the root directory).  However, I believe that all distros have a /etc/hosts file (which means a file named "hosts" located in the /etc directory).  It is the same difference as having a file in windows be located in the C:\ drive instead of the C:\Windows folder.

Try typing: "ls -al /etc/hosts" at the command prompt (leave off the quotes).  That should return one result.  Then try typing: "cd /etc" and then "cat hosts" to see the contents. HTH

Message-ID: <CE8B74E0F3F5D311B97F00508B6BF7AA039201E6@msnbex05.bn.usi.net>

Hello Robert,
Welcome to the wonderful world of Linux.

To view /proc/pci, open up a temrinal and type:
cat /proc/pci
(this tells you what the linux kernel recognizes on your computers PCI bus)

To view /etc/host, run a similar command:
cat /etc/hosts
(this file helps Linux translate from IP address to host name)

If you have access to your LAN and the internet, then most likely its not a
networking issue.  I think when you say: "I lost access to my printer," you
mean: "I can't print."

Printing has caused me much grief, but since you can't print from both
printers, I think that lpd (Local Printer Daemon) is proably not running.

Try this: (you'll want to be root, so either type "su -" in a terminal or
hold down "CTRL+ALT+F1" and login as root)
/etc/init.d/lpd status
(/etc/init.d is a directory that holds the scripts that services use to
start up when you turn you computer on.  The /etc/rc.d/rc5.d directory
determines which of these scripts to run, when you boot into graphical
login)

That should tell you if lpd is running or not.  If not, try:
/etc/init.d/lpd start

See if you get the error message here about localhost.localdomain being a
bad name...  This is where I would usually get such a message.  If it does
start ok, try to print.  If not, that's when you want to edit /etc/hosts to
help it find localhost.locadomain (add it to the end of the liine starting
with 127.0.0.1).  Try again.

If that doesn't work, I think I'd start on the smaller problem of getting
just 1 printer to work, and then add the second...

Printing has always been a big pain in the butt to me (especially because I
own only a semi-supported printer), but hopefully this gets the conversation
started in the right direction for people with more knowledge in this area
than I.

Good luck,
John Pelster

P.S.  If you want to see how your printers are configured, view the file
/etc/printcap.  It might seem intimidating at first, but getting comfortable
with the configuration files will really help you.

It's also fair use to spread the tape around and even make copies for

I've had luck with:

ftp.cc.gatech.edu and
ftp.orst.edu

It takes a couple tries, but I have been able to get in and their throughput isn't too bad (around 90-100 kbytes/sec).  The main problem that I have had is that my md5sum for the 3rd iso image doesn't check out. (I've downloaded it twice and am on my 3rd time).  Haven't burned the iso's yet though.

 Another, equally important, test is what portion of the material is being
copied.  100% is a pretty difficult portion to defend on Fair Use grounds.
 

Private viewings--even very large private viewings--would seem to be covered.
 Passing around copies of the entire tape seems quite dubious, regardless
of the cost or profit involved.

Here's a link to the CFR section on Fair Use: http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/107.html

It's also fair use to spread the tape around and even make copies for
people free of charge (and free of promotional purpose).

Hi,

I upgraded to emacs21, just for grins, and there is this annoying
toolbar in the display.

Anybody know how to get rid of it ?

My usual tricks in finding the controlling variable don't seem to
work.

Thanks

I think SuSE still has the encrypted filesystem option.
In fact, they have had it quite a while.
I installed and tested SuSE's encrypted filesystem on a couple disks,
and it seemed to work quite ok; but I didn't have enough need or interest
in it to run it thur it's paces.  (I'm always afraid of losing the
keys when I lock anything.  Haven't been able to get into my

This of course brings up the interesting question.  What if someone

Um, actually that's the thing that's kept me from going nutso on security- 
if you lock yourself out of your own computer files, then what? For 
customers managing security is an even bigger problem. Most would rather be 
lax so they can do their jobs, then they don't have to worry about losing 
the 'keys', or tracking who has access to what. I'm ahead of the game if I 
can persuade them to change passwords when someone leaves the company.

Two handy tools:  M-x apropos and the tab key.

C-h v and C-h f is what I used.  Also, find the lisp directory and use
grep.

It's a reasonable step for highly sensitive data - as long as the customer
understands the risks. Trying to lock down everything is, as Carla says,
a recipe for disaster.

Message-ID: <000001c1cfb7$d1ae2420$6f00000a@mshome.net>

Hello again,
 
            I posted earlier about adding a second network card to my
Compaq 4000. I was reading at RedHat.com and saw that the auto detect
only looks at the first nic card that it finds. I have found that the
drivers are present and I have added it to the modules.conf file but I
must be missing something about the card installation to get it to work.
Does anyone have places I should look for all the steps for installing a
second nic card? I have been trying to read the RedHat site
documentation but have gotten very little from it so far. Thanks in
advance for any help you have. :-)

Success!!!

Thanks to all who wrote suggestions.  I was finally able, with all the 
help, to figure out I had hosed the Hosts: 127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain 
when I was trying to get the WWW to work again.  I put it back in order and 
now I can print fine on both the local and network printers.

Now another question.  In Red Hat Linux for Dummies, Jon "maddog" Hall 
suggests giving the computer an IP address of 192.168.1.1 to 
192.168.254.254.  

When I do this I loose access to my HP JetDirect card webpage (on the HP 
4050 network printer). I use the Konqueror web browser to access it.

The JetDirect IP is 169.254.164.209

If I set the computers IP address to a 169 number it sees it fine, so 
that's what it is now.

Is using a 169 number instead of a 192 a mistake?

Thanks,
Robert

You said they're both 3c905's? Once the driver is loaded, both cards
should be visible. Try this:

    /sbin/ifconfig eth0

    /sbin/ifconfig eth1

I think you'll see results from both commands. The second card is just
waiting for you to set it up.

In /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts, you'll find an ifcfg-eth0 but, I
assume, not an ifcfg-eth1. If that's the case do this:

1) Copy ifcfg-eth0 to ifcfg-eth1

2) Edit ifcfg-eth1, changing "eth0" to "eth1" and whatever other
settings (such as address) need to change for that card.

3) Bring up the second card with the command:

    /sbin/ifup eth1

This will also happen automatically when next you boot.

The 192.168.X.Y addresses are private addresses that will never conflict
with an address on the Internet - they're the right choice for machines
that haven't been assigned an Internet address. Your JetDirect address
is probably left over from a previous life at the office, yes? If you
can change its address to be on the same subnet as your other machines,
you should be in business.

To have all the machines on the same subnet, they should all have
192.168.X.Y addresses, where X is the same for all machines, and Y is
different for each machine.

"addresses allocated by this mechanism MUST NOT be routed by 
any network device.  The addresses are designed to be link 
local addresses.  Link local address are to be, by 
definition, restricted to the local network segment. 
Allocation of link-local addresses in an IPv6 network is 
described in [IPv6SAC]."

The JetDirect may or may not have done an autodiscover to 
see if the iP was in use.

Your workstation definitely did not.

They may or may not be routable over the net depending on 
your ISP's routers configurations and your own gateways 
configuration.

Best to follow Nathan's advice and stick with Private IP ranges.

Thanks

	With the additional information I was able to locate the problem

You said they're both 3c905's? Once the driver is loaded, both cards
should be visible. Try this:

    /sbin/ifconfig eth0

    /sbin/ifconfig eth1

I think you'll see results from both commands. The second card is just
waiting for you to set it up.

In /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts, you'll find an ifcfg-eth0 but, I
assume, not an ifcfg-eth1. If that's the case do this:

1) Copy ifcfg-eth0 to ifcfg-eth1

2) Edit ifcfg-eth1, changing "eth0" to "eth1" and whatever other
settings (such as address) need to change for that card.

3) Bring up the second card with the command:

    /sbin/ifup eth1

This will also happen automatically when next you boot.

I read the statute very differently.

David Boies (chief prosecutor in the Microsoft case and Napster chief
legal council) agrees with me.  His primary argument in the Napster case
is that ALL non-commercial copying is legal.  This argument is probably
the main reason Napster was bought out and the case will never make it
to trial.

Why are you using 2.4..5?  It is far from current.

W/in emacs-21 do:

C-h i  m em<RET> s tool.*bar

That will get you to all occurrences of "tool-bar", "toolbar", or "tool bar".

So even if some un-enlightened soul called the command "tl-br", the phrase

you would discover the command.

Sometimes problems like this result when the kernel is not uniformly built
with modversions turned on or modversions turned off - some code might be
looking for gameport_register_port when it should be looking for something
like gameport_register_port_Raa96bd99. I'd recommend making sure you
have a clean consistent build by running "make mrproper" before you build.

You'll need to save your ".config" file before "make mrproper", then
restore it and run "make config" (or xconfig or menuconfig) to get things
properly set up to rebuild.

Hello once again,

read about the (and bear with me, I am a newbie) the 'bind'ing of
services and routing of requests so that they go to the proper places.
 
            I have a Windows machine as my internet gateway with the
cluster behind the server to the cluster if that is relevant.

There are three "private" IP blocks set aside from the publicly routable
internet blocks:
10.0.0.0/8
172.16.0.0/12
192.168.0.0/16

(See RFC 1918 <URL: http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1918.txt > )

If your network uses a subnet in one of the above blocks, it will not be
routable directly on the internet.

Most people that use this private address space that want to communicate
with the wide internet do so via a process called Network Address
Translation.  This process requires a gateway host with access to both the
internet and the private network to pass all traffic between the two
networks, translating the private addresses to public ones.  This is
mostly useful because a large number of computers on a private network can
share one globally routable IP address.  It also helps prevent unwanted
inbound traffic because the machines inside the private network are not
directly addressable from outside without an appropriate translation entry
on the gateway machine.

Now, there is also this range:
169.254.0.0/16

I'm a little fuzzier on this, but I'll give an explanation a shot.

This is the "link-local" address range.  Essentially, if a machine is
supposed to get an IP address dynamically (from a DHCP server or
something) and can't, it's supposed to assume one of these addresses and
continue to function, though not participating on the network (presumably,
since there are no other local machines on that network).  Using this
address space for a local network is a recipe for disaster.

Your JetDirect card was configured with this address as a sort of
sample/random address and should be reconfigured with an address that is
actually used on your local network.

Depending on how your connectivity with the outside world works, you have
a few options.

Here's my Best Suggestion for a home network with a permanent internet
connection of some kind (DSL, Cable, Frame, ISDN, etc.):

Build a local network using one of the private address spaces set aside by
RFC 1918, renumbering existing systems as necessary.  (In order to
renumber my network printer, I had to run a special diagnostic mode on the
printer and get a printout of the MAC address for the network card, set an
entry in the arp table of one of my computers with the desired address,
then simply ping the address.  The printer's network card understood that
the address to which the ping packet was destined should be its IP
address.  Seems like a very foolish system if anyone on the network can
change the printer's IP at will, but I didn't design the thing.)

Acquire a gateway/firewall device to bridge the local network and the
greater internet.

Configure this device with one interface on the internet via your remote
network bridge device (DSL bridge, cable modem, etc.) and another
interface on your local, private network.

Configure Network Address Translation between the two interfaces.

Set the internal interface on the firewall as the Default Gateway on each
host on the private network that needs to reach the internet.  Set your
ISP's default gateway as the default on the firewall machine.

If you need further help, ask here or show up at a plug meeting and get
ready to talk notes and draw diagrams.

If you're running RH (can't speak for the other distros), you can
restart
network services by `service network restart'. Or, go directly for the
init
script...

/etc/init.d/network {start|stop|restart|reload|status|probe}

I would get something more current.  I do however remember what causes
this.

You have to have both the soundcard and the joystick compiled as a module.  
It is tricky to get this to work right.  (I have the same sound card.)

The sound card works, but getting it to work with the joystick is not always 
easy for some unknown reason.

I may have a .config for that version that works, if you want an example.

Take a look at "FloppyFW" via Freshmeat.net.  It has the instructions for 
setting up a gateway without having to use the flakey MS Gateway code.

Or you can build your own using "Linux Firewalls" by Robert L. Ziegler. (New 
Riders Press) He has examples on his web site.

I have no idea what Boies believes, but what you're arguing is not the case
he made in court.

It was nothing of the sort.  Napster's argument was that their service was
analgous to a VCR... and that even though one obvious application of the
technology in question is to make unauthorized copies of a copyrighted work,
that does not make the technology itself illegal. "Fair Use" comes into
play only to the degree that Fair Use applications *potentially* exist for
the technology.

The bulk of MP3 trading is still illegal and Napster has never (to my knowledge)
claimed otherwise.  All they were trying to argue is that *they* were not
liable for damages for being a third party to the illegal activity of their
users.  Had Napster won in court, this would in no way have meant that *all*
uses of their technology were suddenly covered by Fair Use.  This is quite
a narrower scope of argument than what you suggest.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss this with you further, but we probably
shouldn't clog the list with our discussion.  Feel free to write me directly

Been there, done that. Your CD software should have a "create disk from ISO 
image" setting somewheres. Just copying won't do it. I understand the disks 
are good to hang in fruit trees, to scare away birds.

Subject: [PLUG] USB 2.0
Message-ID: <E16naow-0002fv-00@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

I bought an USB 2.0 enclosure from Fry's for ~$70, Seems to be a Foster ME-320,
a noname. This is the only web page that has pictures.
http://www.watch.impress.co.jp/akiba/hotline/20011020/ni_i_dd.html The rest of
the sites google turned up were also Asian.

I also purchased an IOGear USB 2.0/FireWire PCI card,
http://www.iogear.com/products/product.php?Item=GUF220 for another ~$70.

I have a 24x10x40 IDE CDRW bought from CostCo last year,  installed in the
enclosure. This opened up the 5.25 drive bay so that I could install a $14 hard
drive enclosure, http://www.enuinc.com/Other.html. 

I had to patch a 2.4.18 kernel with the 2.4.19-pre3 patch to get EHCI HCD USB
2.0 support. This was done on top of the  preempt-kernel-rml-2.4.18-2 patch,
http://kpreempt.sourceforge.net/. Compiling with the hardware support built in,
no modules, for my box was not problematic. 

To give some idea of the performance; I tested using dd_rescue,
http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/ddrescue/ , to make an iso of a CDROM. 

Plugged into the USB 2.0 card
dd_rescue: (info): ipos:    663106.0k, opos:	663106.0k, xferd:    663106.0k
		   errs:      4, errxfer:	  2.0k, succxfer:    663104.0k
	     +curr.rate:     2066kB/s, avg.rate:     3180kB/s, avg.load:  3.4%


Plugged into the motherboards USB ports,
http://www6.tomshardware.com/mainboard/01q3/010924/sis735-04.html
dd_rescue: (info): ipos:    663106.0k, opos:	663106.0k, xferd:    663106.0k
		   errs:      4, errxfer:	  2.0k, succxfer:    663104.0k
	     +curr.rate:     1908kB/s, avg.rate:      904kB/s, avg.load:  0.7%


The only issue to this setup is that booting from USB CDROM doesn't work with
the enclosure. Has anyone been successful in booting a motherboard from a USB
device? The reason for doing USB instead of spending $99 for a firewire
enclosure was to also be able to boot. Had I know that booting wasn't an
option, I would have spent the other $20 and got firewire.

Thank you
Russell

He didn't bring his full argument to court.  The court only heard
arguments against the preliminary injunction.  Only the issue of immediate
harm was addressed.

The case never actually went to trial.

I'm having trouble finding the full brief online at the moment, but I
refer you to at least this press release from Napster, Inc.
<URL: http://www.napster.com/pressroom/pr/napster-rebuttal.html >
which contains the following:
'the non-commercial sharing of music is "common, legal and accepted,"'

The quoted wording is from Boies brief.

Your knowledge is limited (as is mine) and you'll find that Napster's
legal firm stated clearly on several occassions that their intent was to
show that ALL non-commercial copying is legal and, further, that the
RIAA's "copyright pooling" amounted to an illegal cartel and an abuse of
copyright; the only legal remedy of which is stripping the involved
parties of ALL copyrights.  And Boies had a damned good case.  Given a
judge not beholden to corporate or political interests (almost impossible
to find these days), the Napster case could well have seen all recorded
work administered by the RIAA pushed immediately into the public domain.

This is my take on what is up.

The meeting is in a bit of a flux.  We'd talked about inviting Randal to
speak without actually asking him - until late last week.  That left him
without enough time to prepare something.  What Randal is ready to do is
take on all comers in . . . Language Smackdown.  Bring whatever you have in
any language (Lisp, Python, ...) and challenge Randal to do better in Perl.

Otherwise we'll discuss fair use, ssh, and whatever advanced topics we can
come up with in a round table format.

Hi Tom,

I remember you from PCC CIS240L!  I have not had
any experience with serial connection, but the man page
for pppd says that error 15 is because the peer is not
responding to echo requests.  This suggests that in fact
pppd  is working ok but that you might have an actual
modem configuration problem.  The man page for pppd
is quite extensive.

Hope this helps

Hello again,
 
            I posted earlier about adding a second network card to my Compaq
4000. I was reading at RedHat.com and saw that the auto detect only looks at
the first nic card that it finds. I have found that the drivers are present
and I have added it to the modules.conf file but I must be missing something
about the card installation to get it to work. Does anyone have places I
should look for all the steps for installing a second nic card? I have been
trying to read the RedHat site documentation but have gotten very little
from it so far. Thanks in advance for any help you have... :-)

 Uhmm... so it's just a "loop" file block device on a kernel that has
 the crypto patch and "losetup" is run to insert a crypto layer?

 Do you mean binary file name conflicts?  I wonder how the Debian
 package deals with that?  I imagine they've renamed some of the
 binaries, unless it is logical to either offer alternatives (via
 "update-alternatives") or divert the SSH version (via "dpkg-divert"
 calls in postinst and prerm).

 Hmmm.  So they put the looped files into one of the other
 filesystems, or can you mount a partition with the encryption?

 Can you put a loopback device into "/etc/fstab"?  How?  Can anyone
 provide an example?

 When do you type the passphrase?  What about a machine that must boot
 standalone?

 Are the crypto filesystems for users, or only system wide?

 Ok, so how do they do it?  Is anyone actually using it?

There have been a couple patches for USB disk booting.  See

for one of them.  A small delay is needed for USB bus/devices

Hopefully one of them will make it into the kernel...

Also, there is work in progress on USB disk packet streaming,
to improve disk IO performance.  It doesn't change USB 1.1 device

 I've got Soundblaster PCI-128 cards in both of my machines, and they
 have the Ensonic 1371 chipset.  I use the ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound
 Architecture) drivers, and that works very well.  Perhaps you can
 either download and install a binary set that matches your running
 kernel, or build a set of your own?  They are available from the ALSA
 website and from their CVS, or ...


 On a recent Debian GNU/Linux system, you can use "apt-get" to grab
 the latest kernel source, any kernel-patch packages you would like to
 apply, the "kernel-package" build system, "fakeroot", and the
 "alsa-source" package.

 When you install the "alsa-source" package, "debconf" should ask
 several questions about how to configure the source.  It will ask
 which drivers to build, whether you want plug-n-play, and if you want
 debugging turned on or not.  You can at any time, as root, run
 "dpkg-reconfigure -plow alsa-source" to reconfigure it.

 Become root, run "adduser <yourname> src", then "cd /usr/src" and
 "chown root:src -R modules && chmod g+ws -R modules".  ("/usr/src"
 itself should already be set that way... perhaps it's a bug that
 "/usr/src/modules" is not owned by root:src?)

 You then log in fresh, as yourself, NOT AS ROOT, "cd /usr/src", then
 unpack both the kernel-source tarball and the "alsa-source" tarball,
 while standing in "/usr/src".  The kernel-source will create a
 directory named "kernel-source-${KVER}" and the alsa-source will
 unpack in a version name suffixed subdirectory of "./modules".

 "cd kernel-source-${KVER}", and then "cp /boot/config-$(uname -r) \
 .config", then apply any patches you want, either by hand, or by
 running the script in "../kernel-patches/(all|${ARCH})/apply/\
 ${patchname}".  After that, run "make menuconfig" or "make xconfig",
 and check the kernel configuration.

 Now you can run:  (Optional args in customary square brackets)

 % fakeroot make-kpkg [--revision 1] --append-to-version '-<anystring>' \
   [--initrd] clean

 It will probably prompt you with a message at this point... You
 should read it to know why it stopped, then continue.  Always clean
 after reconfiguration for best results.

 Then run:

 % fakeroot make-kpkg [--revision 1] --append-to-version '-<anystring>' \
   [--initrd] kernel_image

 It will probably prompt again, and you should continue again.  Then,
 finally, run:

 % fakeroot make-kpkg [--revision 1] --append-to-version '-<anystring>' \
   [--initrd] modules_image

 That will build you a .deb of your custom kernel, and another
 containing the matching "alsa-driver" modules.  Become root and
 install them both, make certain that the "lilo" or "grub"
 configuration is correct, then reboot.  I believe there is also
 "debconf" configuration of the binary driver package as well, and an
 init.d script that should load them for you.  Make sure it's loading
 the "oss" compatibility modules also.

 If you run "devfs", you may have sound-device permission problems at
 first.  I recommend turning on the state saving feature, and creating
 the "/dev-state" directory, then once and for all you can:

 # chown root:audio /dev/{sound,snd}/* && chmod g+w /dev/{sound,snd}/*

 Make sure you're in the "audio" group, and it should work fine after
 that.

I am not sure if this is relevent, as your description of the serial port 
settings was not real clear.  However serial port 1 is normally comm1
and serial port 2 is normally comm2.  These should correspond to ttys0 
(Comm1) and ttys1 (Comm2) respectively.  If you have connected to serial port 
1 on the back of the machine, you should be using ttys0.  Or did you change 
that in BIOS?  If the port/tty settings are correct, you may simply have a 
ppp setup problem.  Did you enter where to look for DNS in the setup?

 Yes, it's reminding you.  "man kernel-img.conf", and also grep the
 "initrd" stuff from the Lilo manual, IF YOU USE LILO.  You could
 point lilo at the symlink, and turn on the "Do_Symlink" option, or...

 Sounds reasonable...

    Michael> Did I do this right?

 Looks correct to me, but read "man update-grub", and recall from "man
 kernel-img.conf" the hook calls...  You can have the kernel
 install/upgrade run "update-grub" for you if you like.  IIRC, you
 turn off "Do_Bootloader" (iirc... rtfm), and set a hook so it runs
 "update-grub" during the kernel-image postinst.  IIRC, you should
 make a backup of your "/boot/grub/menu.lst" just in case, then run
 "update-grub" and let it replace the old one, then edit as needed,
 and run it again.

 I have not messed with it since I installed and configured it,
 several kernels ago.

    Michael> At the end of the install there was a reference to
    Michael> "initrd.img not symlink..not clobbered" What does that
    Michael> mean?

 There is an actual file at "/boot/initrd.img" or at "/initrd.img" and
 it was smart enough to both not clobber it and to tell you about that
 fact.  Normally the generic name "initrd.img" is a symlink pointing
 to the number one kernel's real "/boot/initrd.img-$(uname -r)".

 I don't know about you, but I always configure that system so that
 all of the files it keeps are under "/boot", and I remove the ones
 from "/" because I don't think they belong there anymore.  It will
 work either way, depending on both how you build the kernel and how
 you set up "/etc/kernel-img.conf".

Enable CONFIG_INPUT_GAMEPORT in your kernel configuration, or get a more
recent kernel (2.4.18 is the latest) where this configuration bug has
been fixed.

Seems to me the tough part would be working with lbxproxy and its
port-skewing. What did you try along those lines?

Message-ID: <41C0B6AB2A57D3119ED800A0C9EA392003059814@arnold.bedrock.com>

All;

I have just finished and tested a script that monitors the unix hosts for
any problems and alerts the administrator (me) if there are is a problem.
The script is elegant in simplicity: it scans the host for processes listed
in a configuration file. To change what the machine looks for, simply edit
the config file!

This makes the script portable. I have tested it and I know it works on
Dynix/ptx 4.4, HP-UX v10.0 and v10.2, SunOS, and Linux. It's POSIX so I have
little doubt that it will work with other platforms as well.

After it is approved I will change the alert from an email to a message from
my cell phone.

The first listing is the script itself. It is followed by a sample
configuration file:

#!/bin/ksh

#	                      		           #
#This script scans the process configuration   #
#file and searches the process list for        #
#matching fields. If it does not find the      # 
#process, it will send an alert.	           #

the argument in proccess list 
    ((index+=1))
    shift
  done
}  #End function check_processes

#Scan the $process_config file for the databases that are supposed to be

scanning the processes unique to each machine.

#Strip out all comment lines (sed), delete the blank lines (grep) and awk

sed /#/d "$process_config" | grep -v '^ *$' | awk -F"\t" '{print $1,$2}' |
while read min_proc_num proc_name
do
  #Figure out how many processes from the config file there are running

Message-ID: <20020320203452.8BDBF10E055@pons.enet.sharplabs.com>

In my readings I came across the following site:

http://www.neurotraces.com/scilab/scilab2/node2.html

It discusses some aspects of signal processing on
neurophysiological signals.

In the middle of the Introduction I came across
the following section:

    "What are the advantages of using free software and how to get it"

which contains one of the best apologies (in the old sense of the
word) for using "free software" that I've seen.

Y'all might enjoy reading it.  It's preaching to the choir, I know, but the
bullet items in that section make a nice, concise set of points for
any presentations you might need to give to your boss in the future :-)

No you didn't.  There wasn't one.  Always the 3rd Wednesday of the month,
and it
will be at It's a Beautiful Pizza for the foreseeable future.  We start
about 7:00.

There's wasn't a meeting announcement because we're uncoordinated this

If you do any sort of Open Source development and you have a signed
employment contract, you may wish to read this:

http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=153046

I know the author and he and I have spoken at length about this issue.
Legally, his company has him over a barrel.  It turns out that neither the
GPL nor Perl's Artistic license protects him because an employee usually has
no legal right to unilaterally bind his or her employer to such restrictive
terms without the employer's explicit, written permission.

Unfortunately, all of the open-source work he has produced during his
current employment has the potential to be pulled.  If you use Perl, you may
wish to be aware that both the Carp and Exporter modules may be forced to
revert to older, broken versions.

Further, he was developing some rather revolutionary ideas for regular
expression engines which may now never see the light as he will likely be
sued if he continues to work on them.

It went something like this:

Recording industry sues Napster for "contributory copyright
infringement" and seeks restitution via massive cash awards and the
discontinuation of the company's primary service.

Napster prepares briefs for countersuits for harrassment and misuse of
copyright by the RIAA.

RIAA receives a "preliminary injunction" stopping Napster from running
their services until trial.  This is done simply by RIAA going to court
and claiming they are being damaged by the continuation of the
service.  But since there's no actual trial when an injunction is granted,
RIAA isn't required to show proof of said damages.

Napster appeals the injunction and shows evidence that the recording
industry has suffered ZERO damages since Napster began its services but
the pro-entertainment industry judge denies the appeal.

Napster can't afford to continue paying its employees, let alone highly
skilled legal consul, without being able to operate their business.  They
flounder and nearly close their doors.  BMG buys Napster and RIAA comes to
a "compromise" where artists can opt-out of Napster by supplying the
company with a list of songs that are banned.

Users resort to piglatin to bypass the filtering software, but the service
never really recovers.

The simple fact is that the Napster case never went to trial.  The RIAA
successfully shut the company down long enough to make it possible to buy
the thing.

The RIAA hasn't been as agressive against similar services because they
aren't backed by a company with money enough to bring a suit that would
destroy the RIAA cartel and the recording industry as they know it, as
Boies intended to do.

This is what I hate about our legal system.  If you have enough money, you
can always win regardless of the facts or the law.  Personally, I don't
think the RIAA can hold it's monopoly much longer.  The cat is out of the
bag, so to speak, with mp3 files.  Had they seen it coming, they would have
tried to make the format and all others like it illegal, I'm sure.  The
technology has advanced and the record industry will roll with it or be
replaced by a different set of players.  Is it any wonder that M$ media
player keeps track of what mp3's you have played and uploads the info along
with your registration number?  Is it any wonder that it is done in the form
of cookies so that most people would never notice?

very interesting topic. so the lesson I gleaned was (as what New York
would call a "professional employee") make sure your job description is
as narrow as possible and does not overlap with your open source
software development, moonlighting, or hobbies.  I wonder what happens
if you don't have a job description?

If you do any sort of Open Source development and you have a signed

I know the author and he and I have spoken at length about this issue.
Legally, his company has him over a barrel.  It turns out that neither
the
GPL nor Perl's Artistic license protects him because an employee usually
has
no legal right to unilaterally bind his or her employer to such
restrictive
terms without the employer's explicit, written permission.

Unfortunately, all of the open-source work he has produced during his
current employment has the potential to be pulled.  If you use Perl, you
may
wish to be aware that both the Carp and Exporter modules may be forced
to
revert to older, broken versions.

Further, he was developing some rather revolutionary ideas for regular

IANAL, but...

I think the real lesson here is to be upfront with the employer and
tell them what you want to do and ensure them that you aren't
publishing company secrets and get _that_ in writing.  If _they_ don't
agree to that, then you have a clear choice about whether you want to
accept their employment offer.

BTW, this is another, probably the more significant reason that FSF
wants copyright assignments for contributed work.  It's to get
employers to sign off of the transfer before it become something that
others build on.  It clears up what could become a real legal tangle.

Ahh... but that's ultimately what got Ben in trouble.  Many large companies
have terms in the employment contract that *any* ideas (whether realized or
not) that you develop during the time you work for them belong to that
company.  Thus, I have a module on the CPAN (and another in the works) that,
in theory, belong to my company.  Fortunately, the owner of our company has
stated that he has no problem with my doing open-source work on my own time,
but that may change if his lawyer doesn't have enough fiber in his diet.

Many people on this list may be violating the terms of their employment
contract and be open to legal liability just for answering questions here or
posting code.

I'm no expert, but since I work at Sun I'll hazard a guess.

The question is wether the OS sees the drive as a DVD-ROM or just a CD-ROM. 
If it sees it as a DVD-ROM, perhaps your software for playing is looking at a 
symlink for /dev/dvd0 (or something) instead of the device.  If the *actual* 
device and the symlink aren't the same, sync 'em up or change your software to 
reflect the device address.

The next question is:  Solaris or Linux?  I'm not entirely certain that 
Solaris has DVD-player support.  Well, it has DVD-reader support obviously, 
otherwise we wouldn't ship the things.  But wether or not there is DVD-veiwing 
software to support said reader is another matter.

I'm almost in the same boat.  We dual booted our lab PC and started
using Perl to drive instrumentation.  I've been trying for almost two
months to get permission to release the code, and management is too
busy to take time to consider the legal part of the problem.

He can continue to work on them, he just can't release them while
employed at that company.  Since the company has no method (or legal
right) to track what he does at home on his own machines all he needs
to do is wait.

Colin,

I wish you were right.  Unfortunately, it's rather well-documented that he
came up with this idea while he was with his current employer (check the
timestamps):

http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2000-05/msg00853.html
http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?lastnode_id=153046&node_id=59549

The beauty of his idea is that it allows NFA regular expressions to have
almost the same performance as DFA engines by turning the regex into a
series of ordered sets and eliminating backtracking.  This would
tremendously speed up regular expressions.  (I have lovely dreams of using
this with the JIT compiler in Perl6).  It's possible to write a regular
expression that can take years to run on simple data, but you and I could
solve in just a few seconds.  His idea solves that for the majority of
cases.

Unfortunately, since he conceived of this idea and documented it, it is no
longer public domain, but the proprietary work of his company, even though
it has no immediate benefit to his company.

Thus, with mailing lists like this being archived, I can't help but wonder
how many of us may be exposed.  I suspect that many open-source projects
today would be gutted if employers decided to crack down on them (and I know
of a couple of people who keep online identities private for this very
reason).

Cheers,
Curtis "Ovid" Poe

The other way to go (and how it's been handled at a couple of places I've 
worked) is to draft an agreement between yourself and the company, and have 
and authorized representative of the company sign it.

 From what I understand, most of the companies I'd consider working for 
will sign.

Due to circumstances beyond my control...... yeah, right!

Anyhow, I need to figger out how to setup RedHat 7.2 so that a Win95
box can see a share, and from that use "drive copy" to create a CD
backup of files stored on that share.

I haven't had luck with the RTFM methods, so any pointers would be
very helpful. I know, what have I tried so far. well...

I went thru the process some weeks ago, and then gave up - promoting
an entirely different scenario that would work (IMHO) far better. But
today I got the word that I have to make the SAMBA thang work, and I

My advice would be to talk to his own lawyer about what his options
_really_ are.  Don't rely exclusively on the representations of the
company.  Secondly, no matter what the "law" is, there is also the
court of public opinion.  Potentially, "outing" the company involved
here could provide the leverage necessary for them to "do the Right
Thing".

It is important to keep in mind that companies not only occassionally
produce software that is, perhaps unbeknownst to them, leaked into the
Free Software community, but they use a lot of it too.  When they
start thinking about pooping in the well, they should also think about
what they are going to be brushing their teeth with.

I struggled with SAMBA for quite a while before getting it to work, too. Ken
Stephens was instrumental in my initial discoveries.

I'm not sure where to start with your current problem, though. everything is
pingable, right?

Have you tried webmin? It's got a cool GUI. gnosamba (or gtksamba, which
ever it is now) is a reasonable GUI configuration tool, too.

In order to help we're gonna need some more details.
But, without any details whatsoever as to what the
issue is that you are having with your win95 box, I'll
hazard a guess. You most likely have a permissions
issue. The vast majority of first run samba issues are
related to users/passwords/authentication. win95 uses
plain text passwords by default so there's one place
to check. the user/pass combination your win95 client
will offer to samba for authentication is the same
that you used to 'log in' to win95 in the first place.
Make sure that account has a matching valid system
account on the samba server and also has a matching
entry in the smbpasswd file. The next thing to make
sure is that you have a valid guest account. My box
uses 'ftp' for guest access. If you don't have a valid
guest account you may not be able to see any of the
shares or files on the server - even if you have a
valid user account. If none of that helps, send us
more details on what the problem is or maybe even just
the error message as listed in your logs.

Or ignore messages with "Precedence: bulk", which I think I remember
is what /usr/bin/vacation used to do.

Don't forget the clear passwords issues with Win95, they're off (encrypted)
by default in Samba. Win95, as I understand it, is incapable of encrypted
passwords.

Hmm. I think the magic you're looking for is hidden under ``man xsetroot".

When I tried the command ``xsetroot -cursor_name right_ptr -fg red", I had
a red cursor until I restarted the X server. (The cursor names are defined
in /usr/include/X11/cursorfont.h, & the bitmaps for the cursor are found in
/usr/include/X11/bitmaps.)

So far so good. Everything changed over to addresses in the 192 range.

I changed the HP Printer JetDirect Card to 192.168.200.200 with no problem. 
I changed a Windows 98 computer to 192.168.200.006 with no visible problem.
Then I changed the Red Hat 7.2 computer to 192.168.200.081 and upon reboot 
it said the IP address was invalid.  I then changed it to 192.168.200.181 
and it seemed to work fine.

Now my questions:  Is an IP address ending in .081, or .001 for that matter 
invalid?

Does it need a number other than 0 (zero) as the first number in order to 
work?

The Windows 98 computer seems to work fine, but I don't know if something 
down the road will stop working if this is an invalid address.  None of my 
books discuss this detail.

Thanks
Robert

I don't know why that did not work, one of my Linux boxes is 192.168.0.011.  
The .001 is usually reserved by convention for a server (?), but no reason

I don't know of any reason you would want to lead an octet with zeros.

Just use the numbers, 192.168.200.81.

Nothing says they have to be three digits.

Not really.  People just do it like that; but there's not technical
reason for it.  And usually, they use it for the default gateway
(router).

Actually no.  Turns out it did not like the MPI 1.4 setting.

The reason i was using it was: 1) It was quiet. 2) It only had 32 megs it it. 
3) I did not want to waste having a dual Pentium-Pro 200 doing nothing.

Since then, the price of memory for the machine dropped from $500 to $70 for 
128 megs.  I am now making it into a replacement for my mail server.  (It 
still has problems with drives larger than about 4 gigs for a boot disk, but 
I can work around that...)

Um, can't imagine why you'd put the leading zeroes in there.  It could
probably mislead someone.

Now, if you're GOING FOR obscurity, I'd recommend using the decimal
representation of the 32bit int that is your IP address.

It is conventional for the first usable host address on a subnet (as
distinguished from the network and broadcast addresses) to be the default
gateway out of that subnet.  But since we subnet now on all kinds of funny
blocks, that's not always a .1 address... could just as well be .33 or
.129.

It should work out of the box with linux, mine does, just make sure you use 
dhcpcd and not pump.  Pump doesn't have all the bells and whistles of pump 
and seems to perform better.  

Note: I don't advise getting a DHCP address and then assigning that to 
yourself as static.  Although this will work perfectly fine with normal dhcp 
servers.  Cisco ubr routers have a option called cable source verify that 
will lock your modem out unless it has optained a proper dhcp lease.

This is an especially good time for you vacationers who plan to fly, because
the Reagan administration, as part of the same policy under which it
recently sold Yellowstone National Park to Wayne Newton, has "deregulated"
the airline industry.  What this means for you, the consumer, is that the
airlines are no longer required to follow any rules whatsoever.  They can
show snuff movies.  They can charge for oxygen.  They can hire pilots right
out of Vending Machine Refill Person School.  They can conserve fuel by
ejecting husky passengers over water.  They can ram competing planes in
mid-air.  These innovations have resulted in tremendous cost savings which
have been passed along to you, the consumer, in the form of flights with
amazingly low fares, such as $29.  Of course, certain restrictions do apply,
the main one being that all these flights take you to Newark, and you must
pay thousands of dollars if you want to fly back out.

woops, wasn't paying attention when I replied, and used the number the same 
as he wrote them.  I actually do have .11 and not .011.   
Will it really understand decimal numbers?  I was told in a Linux class that 
hexidecimal numbers will work, but I haven't tried it.

I just built a dual-amd MP 1.6GHz machine with 1GB DDR ram, I gave it 256mb 
swab, that I don't think I've ever seen it used.  

I know the rule of thumb used to 2xmemory for swap, but I couldn't see giving 
it a 2GB swap partition.  Is there a new rule of thumb that I missed?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0203202348100.17275-100000@sco302.avalongroup.net>

                                                 21 March 2002

    Some companies can be very sticky about doing Open Source work.
Even universities and government agencies sometimes have doubts
about it.  This was especially true before the internet made
Open Source work so easy and Linux became popular enough to
make Open Source work "respectable".  Indeed, I often feel
my addiction to Open Source work has limited my choice of
employers; but I'm happy with the choices I have made.

    I started writing, collecting, and redistributing source
code and significant data sets in the 1970s as an employee of
Oregon State University.  The university generally supported
this activity, but once in a while they would take the position
that while collecting software and data for the university's
needs was important; redistributing this to other institutions
was irrelevant to my department's research and thus a waste of
time and money.  Fortunately, this attitude was rare.  The
university generally supported me very well, and never asked me
to sign any excessively restrictive agreements.

    In 1986 a government contractor by the name of Infotec
Development hired me to work on a contract with the
U.S. Bureau of Land Management.  I was hired in part, because
of my huge library of "Open Source" software for Prime Computers.
My relationship with both Infotec and BLM was a bit strange.
For the most part, Infotec was a defense contractor and they
took pride in keeping everything as secret as possible.
However, since I was working on a contract with a civilian
agency and I had been hired as an academic I was given a lot
of freedom.  Actually this wasn't Infotec's idea.  BLM liked
my work and encouraged Infotec to keep me happy.

    When I first went to work for Infotec their employment
agreements weren't very restrictive.  Eventually, after several
mergers they asked everyone to sign a new highly restrictive
(and possibly illegal*) employment agreement.  I refused until
I added an appendix which negated much of the agreement.
Infotec was extremely unhappy, but there wasn't much they
could do.  I mean they didn't want to tell BLM they had fired
me over that issue.  Of course, I couldn't have gotten away
with this if I were a new employee.

    During these years, I had one other bad argument with
Infotec.  I contributed to a software package called LTPlus,
<http://www.ltplus.org> which was written by government employees
and contractors and was thus in the public domain.  At one point,
Infotec hired all the key programmers on this project and tryed
to make the package proprietary.  At that time, I was asked
(or told) to find and destroy every copy of the source
code I could find.  I'm generally a team player, but I
considered that to be illegal and immoral; so I got the
last public edition of the source code and emailed it to
various interested parties.  I never told anyone about
this until recently, but people suspected that I had
done something and wanted my head.

    Meanwhile, BLM treated me very well during all
these years.  They didn't generally understand or support
Open Source Software; but they appreciated good results and
gave me a lot of freedom and political support.  In some
ways, I was their one and only Open Source programmer, but
they treated me well.

    I left Infotec in Jan 1999 and currently work for
Micro Sharp Technology where the employment agreement is
simple and non-restrictive.  Fortunately, Micro Sharp
supports an Open Source philosophy, but then that is
why they hired me - to start their Netule <http://Netule.org>
product line.

                                          Sincerely,

   *  Employment contracts are generally legal, altho they are often
      difficult to enforce in court.  The particular contract I was
      asked to sign was poorly worded and had clauses which may have
      been illegal.  In fact, my superiors argued that I should sign
      it, because no court would ever enforce such a screwy contract.
      I didn't buy that argument.

The new word on the streets (w/ 2.4) is at least equal to the amount of
ram. However, if you're just using the machine as a desktop system I
don't see a problem with your configuration. Then again, with hard drive
space as cheep as it is, why not splurge.

I never could figure out how this logic is justified-
If I have 12 gigs of RAM,  do I need a 12 gig swap file?
If I have 16 megs of RAM, do I REALLY only need a 16 meg swap??
Of course this is illogical, particularly obvious when taken 
to extremes as suggested above.

How about the more RAM you have,  the smaller the swap file 
you need?
How about logging mem usage and adjusting the swapfile 
accordingly?
You could begin by adding up your projected use ( number and 
size (memory footprint)of daemons/programs and throw in 10% 
headroom and call it a good start, then dynamically adjust 
if needed.

Early 2.4 VM wanted swap = 2 * RAM (if you needed any swap).
2.4 VM was changed in 2.4.10.  It only wants swap = RAM (IIRC;
I could be wrong :).

I'd guess that unless you have apps that use 500 MB of RAM,
you could get by with no swap space.

Tiny swap space is useless IMO.

BTW, on x86, it seems that swap partitions/files can only
be a max. of 2 GB, so on a 12 GB machine, one would need
6 * 2 GB partitions/files.
Does anyone know if this is still the case?

Sure, with enough RAM, you can often get by with no swap space.
***** It really depends on the applications and their needs.

I am using a 16 GB system at OSDL and beating the heck out of the
2.4 VM.  It usually dies, but I haven't determined why yet.
At home, on my 1 GB system, I have swap space set up, but
I'm fairly certain that it doesn't get used.

The address ending in .081 is valid. I have a RedHat 7.2 system 
here that I configured with 10.1.111.001 and it booted just fine.
Just to be sane about this I changed the config to match yours
and ... it failed.

Of course these sorts of things sound strange when you think about a
desktop system. But what about a machine that's running 5 instances of
Oracle, Apache, ftp, SAP, (add your favorite here). In cases like that
you're not only going to want a lot of ram in the machine you're going
to want a heck of a lot of swap space too so that all of those
application have room to do what they need.

I agree with Randy also, I think that the one for one ratio started
later in the 2.4 cycle around 2.4.10. I suggest using anything above
2.4.16 .. 17 has been great..

JH is exactly right - what gives?  I have plenty of disk space, but the 
whole reason I bought the RAM is to speed the box up (I have a 1333 
Athalon / 1gbRAM  workstation)

Why would I want to spend time swapping to 1gb?  I think I settled on a 
256mb swap file, and according to the CPU/MEM/Swap meter that camps on 
the Gnome panel with this RH7.2 install, it ain't been touched.

That's more than I can say for Windows sometimes.  I remember that when 
I put more RAM in, it just wanted to create a bigger swap file - to a 
point. It has only needed it once since I put the 1gb RAM in. - but then 
again I've primarily run in Linux on it. I should probably put the RAM 
in my winbox which I access through VNC (which rocks btw)

Since this is the more powerful of my two boxes, I am going to try to 
move as much of the video processing as I can over here - or at least 
have the option.

I was surprised to learn the GPLapp VirtualDub (www.virtualdub.net) is 
Win32 only - though pleased to hear the author is working on a Linux 
version.
TMPEGEnc is also a Win only thing.

Any recommendations for Gnome/KDE?

Subject: [PLUG] it gets weirder - was Linux 7.2 printer problem solved
Message-ID: <0E402AD0FEACD411B7C100508BCDF6110463A9CD@cmc-exchange.columbiafunds.com>

I got curious about why the configuration of 192.168.200.081 doesn't work.
Poked around on the machine for a bit and found that `ifconfig
192.168.0.001` works as does `ifconfig 192.168.0.071` 

Then a bit of shell:

 for i in 6 7 8 9
 do    
   for j in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
   do       
      ifconfig eth0 down
      echo trying 0$i$j >> conflog 
      ifconfig eth0 192.168.200.0$i$j >>conflog 2>&1
      echo trying $i$j >> conflog
      ifconfig eth0 192.168.200.$i$j >> conflog 2>&1
   done
 done

And the results show an error whenever a digit larger than 7 is in the
specified address:

 trying 067
 trying 67
 trying 068
 192.168.200.068: Unknown host
 ifconfig: '--help' gives usage information.
 ...
 trying 077
 trying 77
 trying 078
 192.168.200.078: Unknown host
 ifconfig: `--help' gives usage information.
 trying 78

So Robert, the real answer to your question is:

an IP address ending in .081 is invalid - because the leading 0 tells the
software to interpret the number in octal.  In octal only digits 0-7 are
valid.  For that matter and address of say 192.168.081.001 would also be
invalid. Because the 3rd octet is not a valid octal number.  

You could also try something like `ifconfig eth0 192.168.0x081.1` which
would result in an address of 192.168.129.1.

Thanks for the interesting problem.

this is a known XFree bug, but there is a workaround:

They used to say double your ram for windows swap..
Some versions of Win can only use 512 megs or was it 256? 
512 I think, for W98
The pisser with W2K is I have 512 megs of DDR here, and a 
reg hack to minimize swap usage; and yet I still boot up 
with 46 megs of paged *KERNEL*!

Whilst I have 255 megs of free ram

Ugh

Please forgive the back-seat driving :-), but generating numeric
sequences is the forte of the seq utility included in the GNU sh-utils
tarball:

  for i in $(seq 6 9)
  do
    for j in $(seq 0 9)

or, more compactly

  for n in $(seq 60 99)

This brings us to a good point to ask my question:

How can I configure my Cyrix MII-300 box, 32MB of RAM, so it ain't dog slow
swapping everything to disk when I fire up X?

I have turned off just about every service and at that point, I'm right on
the edge *before* I fire up X. It works great that way. I don't mind running
the console, but the folks who are going to use it will be basically using a
spreadsheet and doing some word processing. I even went so far as to remove
the audio card to get back about 64k from the sound modules.

Would it help to recompile the kernel? I am *really* green when it comes to
rebuilding the kernel -- I've done it but it's like I wind up tripping over
the toys and clothes thrown on the floor in the middle of the night. And
with it being modular, would I get any payback, anyway?

No oppressive contracts, and sometime in the next 8 to 14 months no job
either.  My functionality is being merged to data centers in New York or
Massacheutes.  With some luck they will have a different kind of job here
for me, but it is not something to count on.

Doubtful on the kernel payback,  but what X wm do you use?  KDE is about the fattest I think-


There are some designed to be slim as possible... Xfce or 
Fvwm I forget exactly,  someone will comment further with

Something that may be of use to users of SO6.

-------- Original Message --------


this is a known XFree bug, but there is a workaround:

Insert in your /etc/profile.local
export SAL_DO_NOT_USE_INVERT50=true

and StarOffice works fine under XFree 4.x

In recent years, I've been in a position to do this.
However, this doesn't work for many people because:

    (1)  Most people don't have much power when negotiating a
         position with a large company.  This is especially
         true if the employee is young and inexperience and/or
         unemployment is high.

    (2)  If you work for a company for a long time things
         change.  They may change their employment agreement.
         Your interests may change.  Maybe you didn't know
         what Open Source Software was when you started
         working with your employer.  Maybe the industry has
         changed so much that things that used to be ignored
         are now considered intellectual property.  A few years
         ago I never imagined people would try to patent
         algorithms or genes or the "look and feel" of screens.


But, there might be a way around some of these problems.
Suppose one signed a Pre-employment Contract with someone
like the Free Software Foundation promising your availability
to work on certain Open Source projects for a period of
ten years.  If you signed something like this and then
took a job someplace, this contract would remain in force.
It would be easy to ask your new employer to add a clause
to their agreement to allow for the pre-existing agreement.
Most employers would do this, and if they wouldn't do this
their agreement wouldn't mean much since it is in violation
of the first agreement.

At one time, the U. S. Peace Corps did something like this.
They could not afford to be used as cover for the CIA and other
intelligence agencies, so congress past a law banning
Peace Corps Volunteer and Returned Peace Corps Volunteers from
working for any intelligence agency until they had been out
of the Peace Corps for 5 or 10 years or something like that.
Moreover, each volunteer had to agree to this.  As I recall,
the agreement was in writing, but I don't remember for sure.
That was almost 30 years ago.


                                          Sincerely,

Go Tecra 8100 club!! I'm in it too.. ;)

Have you seen these toshiba tools?

http://www.buzzard.org.uk/toshiba/

I have pretty good success with them on my 8100. Greater control over
screen brightness, user suspend, proc speed control and some other
things.. It's not flawless but it works well in 99% of situations. You
need the toshiba.o module.

There are two reserved addresses in any IP subnet. The first is the ".0"
address which denotes the subnet itself, and the second is the ".255"
address which is the broadcast address for the subnet.

But that's not really totally true. In the RFC1918 networks (10.0.0.0,
172.16.0.0, 192.168.0.0) they follow the default netmask schemes. That is,
the first uses a default netmask of 8 bits (255.0.0.0), the second uses 16
bits (255.255.0.0) and the last uses 24 bits (255.255.255.0).

Here is a valid host address: 172.29.224.255, and so is 172.29.225.0. Huh?

It all depends on the netmask. If I use the default netmask on the above
addresses, the network address is 172.29.0.0 and the broadcast address is
172.29.255.255. Any address between those two would be a valid host address.
Those addresses would NOT be valid host addresses if the netmask were
changed to 24 bits (255.255.255.0). That would make the first example a
broadcast address for the 172.29.224.0 subnet and the second would be the
network address for its subnet.

I wanted to go with KDE because it's pretty easy. This is a machine for some
technophobes. Myself, I like BlackBox -- it's fast. I never looked at the
memory footprint because my box has half a gig o' RAM. N'importe. But on the
Cyrix, dat's anudda can a woims. Would IceWM be a better choice for the non

I'll have to agree, it seems like the less RAM you have, the bigger the
swap/RAM ratio should be.  Granted that paging to a disk is time consuming, at
least you would be able to run more than one application at a time.

I recommend using a swap partition (placed on the fast part of the drive)
instead of a swap file.

> How about the more RAM you have,  the smaller the swap file
> you need?

It also seems that with a large amount of RAM, and (a) fixed swap partition(s)
there is no reason to limit your swap space.  The main reason I can see for
setting your initial swap space equal to your RAM is the partition scheme (I
never leave free space on a drive, I paid for the whole thing, I want to be
able to use the whole thing). If the system needs it, there it is, if it
doesn't, no performance lost because the swap exists.

BTW, we have a dual proc PIII with 1Gig of RAM, running apache, mysql,
postgresql, php and some other fun stuff, been up for over 80 days, never
touched the swap file (better than 600Megs are used for cache).

Just another $0.02

In my experience, the biggest consumers of swap space is Java -- and
anything that uses it in a substantial way: Oracle (the installer for
sure, and the db itself in many configurations), browser plug-ins, and
other misc. Java apps (I particularly like ldapbrowser).

On low-RAM systems, X will tend to swap, but I haven't seen that happen
on any machine with 256MB+ of RAM.

reserved by convention != reserved.

I mentioned reserved by convention, as this is what they teach at PCC for 
Networking in both Linux and MS classes.  That it is best to name your 
server, or as Wil more correctly points out gateway/router for the subnet 
with .1.  This is just so when you want to ping the gateway, you know it is 
.1 and don't have to look it up.  Just a conventional way of doing things, 
not required.  Everyone is still free to create their own conventional way of 
doing things.

Subject: [PLUG] First Router
Message-ID: <E16o8Wm-0005Z4-00@epic.mail.pas.earthlink.net>

I want to spend my free time on spring break dividing my 9 computers into two 
networks using a Linux Router between them.  Not having DSL/Cable, I am 
missing out on all of the fun stuff like routing and firewalls, so I am going 
to do it internally.  I am aware of the floppy versions of LRP, but I am 
going to install Linux to a hard drive for this project.  A custom without X 
and all of the excess programs should fit ok on my 1G HD.  The P100 with 32M 
RAM is probably way overkill for this.

Hold on, I'm getting to the point!  Because this is my first attempt at this, 
I am relying heavily on the only Linux Router book I have.  It is a little 
dated, and only describes IPCHAINS on the 2.2 Kernel.  No problem, I have a 
RH6.2 here with a 2.2 & IPCHAINS.  The question is am I wasting my time 
learning IPCHAINS, as this seems to have been replaced by IPTABLES in the 
newer distro's?

What are the differences, pro's /con's?

Ditto with my dual 366 512 meg system 0K swap in use, 245 
megs free, lotsa stuff running etc

I agree on using the real estate you paid for,  but I 
thought I'd bring the whole thing up because somewhere 
there's someone starved for space running twice his ram is 
swap who may not realize it may not be necessary to reserve 
so much room.
Especially now that RAM is so cheap and we all have as much 
as we can squeeze in.

Well Richard,  I've been playing with several firewalling distro's these past few days and they ALL use ipchains.


Most of them use the 2.2 kernel, because it is stable and proven.


Even Wil's Immunix ISO is 6.0 redhat.

So you're not really wasting your time,  and the principles 
or filtering are very similar of course; just the syntax and 
a few new variables are different with IPTables


( I'm sure someone will say someting about that!)


You are learning good stuff both ways,  and your ipchains knowledge will be applicable to many ( if not the majority )


existing installations at any rate

That makes 4 cents now

You wouldn't be wasting your time -- the stuff you can do with ipchains
can also be done with iptables -- but if you're building from scratch,
iptables is the way to go:

1. It's stateful. I.e., it knows if an inbound packet is somehow related
   to a prior outbound one, an ability that makes firewalling a whole
   lot easier.

2. Its logging facility is miles ahead of ipchains.

3. It's where Linux is going, not where it's been.

Yes, but only if you know _exactly_ what hardware you have.  The kernel can be
trimmed down a bunch by selecting just your chipset, (not the shotgun approach
the pre-packaged kernels use) and compiling in the extra stuff, modules take
more memory.  This won't free up Megs, but every bit helps.  It may even run
faster.

Good Luck

Thanks JH, I will go ahead with the project as planned then.  It can't hurt 
to learn both, since IPCHAINS still seems to be used.  I will just start with 
the IPCHAINS, and do IPTABLES later.

The nice thing about having a non critical home network is no one cares if it 
is broken (except me) as long as I can still use the workstation and get the 
mail.  On the other hand, not having to fix it NOW, leads to a lot of 
procrastination. :-)

Thanks Paul, as I wrote to JH, I have decided to do both, one at a time.  
Setting up a router/firewall is probably a short exercise for most of you, 
but I will probably be reading, working on it, and asking questions over a 
long period to get through this.  Just reading the book is raising a myriad 
of questions, but I will try to RTFM them before I pester the list.

As far as I'm concerned you can send mail from Prodigy, Juno or even
NetZero.

Somebody has acknowledged that they had some sort of mail error that sent
their snippy reply to the list instead of just individuals.

I'd hope you would hang in there and give us a chance to show you we're
decent folks.

Please forgive the back-seat driving :-), but generating numeric
sequences is the forte of the seq utility included in the GNU sh-utils
tarball:

  for i in $(seq 6 9)
  do
    for j in $(seq 0 9)

If I read /proc/loadavg like this (Perl, a la C) (called from a loop):

sub do_loadavg

	$loadavg = "nil";

	print "load[1, 5, 15], rdyq/ttl_procs, last_pid:  $loadavg\n";
} # end do_loadavg

I don't see the data changing.  :(

Do I need to use sysopen, sysseek, sysread instead?
Or is there some other trick^W technique?

LOADAVG is opened like this:

open (LOADAVG, "</proc/loadavg") or die "cannot open /proc/loadavg\n";

With my 1gb, the swap has yet to be touched.

Just think of how we'll laugh in 10-20 years at workstations at home

The perl function that I just sent is part of a small (non-panel)
app to give me a quick summary of "system alive" ... or not.

It has to be non-graphic (for my case).
It just repeats a loop:

	do_loadavg();		# /proc/loadavg
	do_stat();		# parts of /proc/stat
	do_meminfo();		# parts of /proc/meminfo

It might grow a tiny bit, but I want to keep it small,
not like 'top', which can take close to 10% of one CPU.
More like 'vmstat', but with different data.

Anyone know of other similar tools?

Thanks,

There is a small drawback to setting up an internal firewall on private ip
addresses:  All good firewalls and routers will _not_ route private ip's.  This
has two implications, 1) if you use prepared firewall rules (like from the LRP)
you have to break the private ip filters, or 2) if you build ipchain rules from
scratch, you'll need to remember to add filters for the private ip's when you
turn the thing loose on the net.

I'm not sure that was worth even $0.02 :-)

Because you're still reading the same file as it was 
when you first opened it.
Instead of seek, etc... just reopen the file.

I think you'll need to put your open() call in the subroutine:

  sub do_loadavg {
    open( LOADAVG, '/proc/loadavg' ) or die $!;
    chomp( my $loadavg = <LOADAVG> );
    die "error reading loadavg" unless defined( $loadavg );
    print "load[1, 5, 15], rdyq/ttl_procs, last_pid:  $loadavg\n";
    close( LOADAVG ) or die $!;
  }

although I'm not really sure why that is :-(

Even if the contract was unenforceable, you'd still have the burden of
having to take it to court, pay fees to a lawyer, & deal with the fact
that the employer could afford to drag it out longer than you could
afford.

If a company believes that it make money from software one of its
employees uses, it WILL try to do so. (And, frankly, I don't blame them
for at least considering it.) I'm sure that a lot of companies look at
Linux's popularity, & wish they had somehow gotten the rights to the
software in order to make money off of it -- & don't understand that
what made it so popular was its freedom from licensing & other
encumbrances.

(I'm sure that Wind River thought they could do that with BSD when they
bought BSDi, only to learn just what would happen, & ended up cutting
their losses in a quick & ungraceful manner.)

Randy,

There is nothing fundamentally wrong with the snippet you sent, as far as I
can tell.  I ran the following snippet just fine.

use strict;
my $file = "/proc/loadavg";
open LOADAVG, "< $file" or die "Cannot open $file: $!\n";

while(1)
{
    print_loadavg( \*LOADAVG );
    sleep 5;
}

sub print_loadavg
{
    my $LOADAVG = shift;
    seek ($LOADAVG, 0, 0) or die "error seeking loadavg: $!";
    chomp ( my $loadavg = <$LOADAVG> );
    die "error reading loadavg" if ! defined $loadavg;
    print "load[1, 5, 15], rdyq/ttl_procs, last_pid:  $loadavg\n";
}

Caveat:  since I am using a Windows box here at work, I ran this on a
different file and manually changed the first line of the file while this
was reading.  However, I can't imagine how this would make a difference.

Cheers,
Curtis "Ovid" Poe

Mark,

Did you test that?  Seek will position the filehandle at the appropriate
position on disk.  If the contents there change, whatever you read should
change.  Am I totally misunderstanding how this works with /proc/loadavg?

Well I think that you are correct, since that's what I tried to do.

And it works for me for /proc/stat and /proc/meminfo,
but they contain multiple lines...if that matters.
But I'm also using hashing to take selected lines from
stat and meminfo, and not doing this for loadavg.

OK, I think the trouble lies in the <> operator. Combining read() with
seek seems to do the trick:

  sub do_loadavg {
    seek( LOADAVG, 0, 0 ) or die $!;
    my $loadavg;
    read( LOADAVG, $loadavg, 80 );
    print $loadavg;
  }

I don't know enough about what magic goes on in the <> operation, but I
imagine that it doesn't know how to reset itself after hitting the end
of a file.

You are correct that the diamond operator doesn't reset after hitting EOF,
but the EOF flag is reset whenever a seek is issued.

Nope.

Much like your 5k of uneditted quoted material (including a six line

Please try to trim the quoted material in your replies to just the

The <> operator calls the readline() function internally (or is it the
other way around?), so I'm trying to interpret the readline() section
from the perlfunc(1) man page:

  readline EXPR

    Reads from the filehandle whose typeglob is contained in EXPR. In
    scalar context, each call reads and returns the next line, until
    end-of-file is reached, whereupon the subsequent call returns undef.
    In list context, reads until end-of-file is reached and returns a
    list of lines. Note that the notion of "line" used here is however
    you may have defined it with $/ or $INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR). See the
    section on $/ in the perlvar manpage.

    When $/ is set to undef, when readline() is in scalar context (i.e.
    file slurp mode), and when an empty file is read, it returns '' the
    first time, followed by undef subsequently.

My reading is that <> (aka readline()) will only return true one in a
scalar context, seemingly regardless of any seek()s run on the
filehandle. If you need to combine <> and seek(), then you need to wrap
the <> in a while loop.

Right?

TOP_DIR="/"
for file in `find $TOP_DIR`; do
	file $file |grep ELF >/dev/null\

done

What's wrong with that?

Oh, wait... you want static links as well?

Hmm. I think the magic you're looking for is hidden under ``man xsetroot".

When I tried the command ``xsetroot -cursor_name right_ptr -fg red", I had a
red cursor until I restarted the X server. (The cursor names are defined in
/usr/include/X11/cursorfont.h, & the bitmaps for the cursor are found in
/usr/include/X11/bitmaps.)

Paul,

Could you rephrase your question?  I am particularly stumbling on this bit:

> My reading is that <> (aka readline()) will only return true one in a
> scalar context

Do you mean "will only return true once"?  I'm not sure what you're asking.

The diamond operator doesn't return true or false.  It will return data, or
undef.  The data could simply be the empty string, so it would evaluate as
false.  It could be "Ovid", which evaluates as true.  Perl handles "truth"
differently from most other languages, so I am am wondering if you and I are
just using different terminology?

The classic example of using seek to reset the EOF flag comes straight from
"perldoc -f seek":

    This is also useful for applications emulating "tail -f". Once
    you hit EOF on your read, and then sleep for a while, you might
    have to stick in a seek() to reset things. The "seek" doesn't
    change the current position, but it *does* clear the end-of-file
    condition on the handle, so that the next "<FILE>" makes Perl
    try again to read something. We hope.

    If that doesn't work (some stdios are particularly
    cantankerous), then you may need something more like this:

        for (;;) {
            for ($curpos = tell(FILE); $_ = <FILE>;
                 $curpos = tell(FILE)) {
                # search for some stuff and put it into files
            }
            sleep($for_a_while);
            seek(FILE, $curpos, 0);
        }

Do you like the words "We hope" in that text?  If that doesn't inspire
confidence in Perl ... :)

This suggests to me that we're talking about a non-portable feature which
your work-around managed to solve.  Unfortunately, I'm at the end of my
rather limited intellectual rope, here, so I can only hope that some Savior
with deeper wisdom has a little more rope handy.

Cheers,
Curtis "Ovid" Poe

That jogged my brain enough,

for file in `find $TOP_DIR`; do
   find-zlib $file
done

It's noisy about directories being non-regular files, but it works.

Well, I think part of the problem is we're not trying to 
emulate a tail -f.  The file's data is replaced so you 
have to start over again.
We have a special file that we're dealing with; -s will 
return a 0 size even though if we open the file, we have 
information. That's probably causing some confusion.

In perltrap, readline and <> are mentioned, but not in 
the present context.

X11 is a standard network protocol for transmitting graphical information 
from an X client to an X server and user input from keyboards and mice back 
the other direction. An X server consists of a display, keyboard, and mouse. 
An X client is some application program like xterm or Mozilla.

XFree86 is a particular implementation of X11.

Okay, with pizza and beer power
it's a one-liner, duh

find / -type f -exec find-zlib {} \;

but it's Indian name is "Chokes-On-Proc"

instead

#!/bin/sh
DIRS="/bin /etc /lib /misc /opt /sbin /usr /var"

for file in `find $DIRS -type f`; do
   find-zlib -v $file

Check the Freegeek Thrift shop, there was a 675 with all the extras in the 
box last week.

Hm, interesting.  I suspect it's an error in the IP address parser in
ifconfig; 'ip addr add 192.168.200.081 dev eth0' works just fine.  In
fact, as I suspected, 'ip addr add 192.168.200.00000000000000000081
dev eth0' works fine also.  (Except I just caused Zebra to go nuts
with my OSPF routing tables.)

Because there's no way to tell this is a binary number, except
the there aren't any other numbers; it /could/ just be an IPv6
address (maybe?).  The hex numbers, the presence of A-F clearly
indicates hex, although leading with '0x' is clearer.  I often
use hex notation for netmasks; I still can't easily convert 8-bit
decimal into hex mentally, but I can easily remember the former
classful netmasks in hex (0xff000000, 0xffff0000, 0xffffff00 and
for host-masks 0xffffffff).  Much easier on the wrists.

A 675 is not the same thing as a 678; the 675's are mostly useless
now (in Qwest areas, at least) due to the switch from CAP encoding
to DMT (I might'a screwed up those acronyms); the 675 only does
CAP but Qwest is switching to DMT and the 678 does both.

With Sun's 'make' or GNU 'make'?  I suspect the former; try the
latter.  Sun's 'make' is much less capable and the IceWM programmers
probably assumed GNU 'make' capabilities.

In-Reply-To: <51C603B9AB4696408D7273AA133734AC1EA659@ljcms002.prod.vectorscm.com>
Message-ID: <20020322080900.26224.qmail@web14803.mail.yahoo.com>

I'm running Red Hat 7.2 on a Compaq Prolinea 4/66,
with an IBM 8515.  Well, what do you expect for $20?

No matter what I set it to, Xwindows (gnome) always
configures itself to run in 320x204 mode.  The BIOS
config runs in 1024x768 so I know it's possible.

According to Compaq's site, the on-board video uses
the Tseng ET4000 chipset, and SuperProbe confirms it
as 'Tseng ET4000 w32i'.  I've tried many suggestions
from README.tseng and other sources, setting Options
such as 'no_accel', with no_luck and to no_avail.

Any insight?  The relavent sections of my XF86Config-4
file follow, (created with xf86cfg, in textmode of
course):

Section "Monitor"
	Identifier   "Monitor0"
	HorizSync    31.5 - 31.5
	HorizSync    35.5 - 35.5
	VertRefresh  87.0 - 87.0
EndSection

Section "Device"
	Identifier  "Card0"
	Driver      "tseng"
	Option      "no_accel"
	Option      "sw_cursor"
	BusID       "Tseng et4000 w32i"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
	Identifier "Screen0"
	Device     "Card0"
	Monitor    "Monitor0"
	DefaultDepth     8
	SubSection "Display"
		Depth     8
		Modes    "1024x768" "640x480"
	EndSubSection
	SubSection "Display"
		Depth     1
		Modes    "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480" "640x400"
"512x384" "400x300" "320x240" "320x200"
	EndSubSection
EndSection

Have you tried configuring it with Xconfigurator?

Sometimes I need to tweak it manually, but not often.

They haven't switched everywhere.  My 675 is still passing traffic.

I did download the source for net-tools and started to wade through it to find out
where the address is parsed.  Not there yet.

But, if this is a bug, rather than a feature of allowing people to express addresses
in decimal, octal, and hex, it is shared by:


/bin/dnsdomainname
/bin/domainname
/bin/hostname
/bin/netstat

Hmm. I just re-ran the command I wrote below on my machine, & it worked as I

Which Window Manager/X environment are you using?

Subject: [PLUG] chroot'd ftp-only account
Message-ID: <200203221619.g2MGJl927470@shell1.aracnet.com>

Hi all,

I want to set up a chroot'd ftp-only account on a Red Hat 7.x box. It 
should work like anonymous ftp but with a real username and password.
 
Documentation for doing this is very sparse, both on the web and with Red 
Hat. What I've tried based on the sparse documentation doesn't work. Have 
any of you done this sort of thing or seen a good HOWTO for it?

The ftp-only part I think I've got figured out. It's making it a chroot
account that's giving me fits.

Thanks,
Terry

My hunch is that you'll find that the parsing is actually done by the
system libraries, not the apps themselves. See arpa/inet.h.

This ----------------^^^^^^^^^^^ is likely your problem.  Xfree is trying
to choose the timing for a 1024x768 display from a set of standard timings.
I'll bet that none of the standard timings match your very specific
vertical refresh.  If you wade through your /var/log/XFree86.0.log file,
you will see some messages similar this:
(WW) MGA(0): Default mode "1024x768" deleted (vrefresh out of range)

If you post the relevant section of the log file, I can probably be more
specific.  In order to fix this, I think you will need to widen the
acceptable vertical refresh range, or create a custom modeline.  Creating
a modeline requires a good understanding of the video signals, and is 
usually not necessary.  What kind of monitor are you using, and do you
have the specs for it?

In-Reply-To: <3C9A3BEA.5050100@jhenshaw.com>
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.31.0203220933520.8099-100000@me.ENGR.ORST.EDU>

I was wondering why most, or at least many, of the people who write on
this list use Red Hat. It seems like RH is considered the
standard linux distribution in other circles as well.

>From what I saw of it a few years ago, (version 7.0) it didn't seem to
support any special features not supported by Debian. And after
using Debian's APT for a while, it's difficult for me to imagine using
an OS without it. The 'rpms' don't seem very useful; you still have to
find the program's dependencies and download/update them, it would seem.
And while I understand there is some kind of apt-like program for RH, its
use doesn't seem very prevalent.

I've heard that RH is easier to install, but when I tried it (v7.0) it
didn't seem any easier than Debian. Perhaps it has improved in recent
versions. Also ease of installation seems like a poor reason to choose an
OS, given that this is a one-time experience, whereas installing and
updating programs on the OS is continual.

Also, while I can see how Red Hat's tech support could be useful, none
of the RedHat users I've met have ever utilized it.

I don't mean to provoke an argument, I'm just curious why people use Red
Hat when (from what I can see) Debian is a better distribution.

I think you're correct in your assessment but note that this
is the kind of talk that starts religious debates on this list and
most of us want to avoid these pointless debates. I suggest
that you use the distribution that you like best and works
best for you but minimize any discussion that appears to
criticize other popular distributions. Some people here have
little tolerance when their preferred distribution is attacked
and we all pay the price in increased traffic to the list.

Terry,

I only use chroot'ed ftp accounts.  I found that proftpd very easy at this
and seems to do it by default.  Though I'm sure you can open it up.  It is
also more secure the wuftp or so I've been told and it supports virtual
host which I needed.  Took a short time to read the brief documentation
and had it up in running in a short time.

  Ed said it quite well. If you need to understand why your question is
rather pointless, ask your friends why the drive the brand of car they do.
After all, every car will take you from place to place and do other things
cars are supposed to do. Some get better gas milage than others, still
others have better repair records. So, if you're not driving the one I find
to have the best gas millage and lowest cost of ownership, why not?

  Same logic with linux distributions. They're all GNU/linux, pick one you
like and let others do their own picking.

The easiest way I've found is to install vsftp, during the configuration,
setting up a chroot jail is an option. (This was done on a debian system, so
you may have to manually edit the config file on other distributions.)  To
make sure your user has no shell available on login, replace the /bin/bash
(or whatever shell is called) in the /etc/password with /dev/null (I know
there is a fake shell, but logging into /dev/null behaves much better).
However I feel I must say that I've just read another book on linux security
that emphatically states "The ftp protocol is inherently insecure -- DON'T
USE IT."

First answer: Try them all! Use what you like.

Second answer: There was a time a few years ago when Red Hat was 
significantly better during the install. I started with it back then and 
have had no compelling reason to switch. Then my employer got in to a 
relationship with Red Hat and I had a better reason to stay with it. These 
days the other distro's have caught up or even passed Red Hat in several 
respects, so go back to the first answer.

Back when I was doing the Linux column in ComputerBits I tried every
distro I could get my paws on. I tell you, there's no better way to
learn about Linux (and the hardware you're trying to install it on).

	Folks,

	Before this thread gets going yet *again* in the history of the list...

	Maybe we should have a "plug-distros at pdxlinux.org" list?  Then, when 
this thread starts up every few weeks, we can have it moved off to it's 
own list...?

Thought this message I received on another list to which I subscribe might
be of interest to some pluggers...

----- Forwarded message -----

Cheap wireless and HPNA stuff at Staples in Hillsboro and down off of
McLoughlin in Milwaukie.

I snagged the last 5-port switch they had a couple of days ago for $30.00,
but there are still a few HPNA adapters, PCI wi-fi 802.11a adapters and
various hubs, etc for pretty cheap. It's mostly netgear and taiwan, Inc.
stuff, but super value-priced.

The Staples stores are closing these two locations right now.

I've been told that the Office Max off of Cornell @ HW 26 is closing as
well. What is that, Exit 65?

They'll probably have some basic SOHO networking stuff cheap.

Installing Linux is a good way to learn.
Creating your own "Linux from Scratch" distro is great.

But actually using and administering a system is where valuable knowledge is
really gained.

Message-ID: <000e01c1d1e1$08bcc400$f1d0a2d1@game>

I would like to use two modem to call two different ISP's and then have
Linux multiplex and route the data stream to the LAN.
the goal is to increase the bandwidth for a bad dialup connection. the user
has two different ISP dialup accounts. They can not get xDSL or cable modem
yet.

I would be making the Linux system be the gateway for a LAN.
and can you make the gateway dial on demand?

Subject: [PLUG] Red Hat 7.2 Update Procedure Questions
Message-ID: <gte6na.ovs@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

I just tried to get some updates from Red Hat and it is a bit confusing.  
If I understand it right, I have to wait 2 hours before the updates will 
start downloading.  Is this correct?  I am sure my dial-up modem will 
disconnect on its own well before that.

It says:

 "The Red Hat Network Daemon periodically connects to the Red Hat Network       
to check for updates and notifications. The default interval time is two 
hours (120 minutes). This can be configured in the /etc/sysconfig/rhn/rhnsd 
file by specifying the time interval in minutes. If you modify the 
configuration file, you must (as root) restart the daemon with the command 
service rhnsd restart or /etc/rc.d/init.d/rhnsd restart. "

It also says:

 "You can view the status of the rhnsd by typing the command service rhnsd 
status or /etc/rc.d/init.d/rhnsd status at a shell prompt. 

 "To disable the daemon, (as root) run the ntsysv utility and uncheck 
rhnsd. You can also (as root) execute the command chkconfig rhnsd off. 
Using these two methods will only disable the service the next time the 
system is started. To stop the service immediately, use the command service 
rhnsd stop or /etc/rc.d/init.d/rhnsd stop. "

I typed " rhnsd status " as well as " /etc/rc.d/init.d/rhnsd status " on 
the Konsole and it says, "Command not found."  Does this mean it is off and 
I won't get the downloads I specified?  (Assuming I will still be 
connected in 2 hours).  Or am I doing it wrong?


Thanks
Robert

If you really want to pursue the daemon method, try this as root:

/sbin/service rhnsd status

If you just want the updates, just run:

up2date

to run the GUI installer for the RHN updates.

1.  For true load balancing between 2 separate connections, you would need 
your own PSN and have to use BGP.  This will not be possible using any 
dial-up service I've ever heard of.  Some sort of load sharing is possible, 
but it's really complicated.

2.  A simpler alternative is PPP channel binding which is supported by 
Linux, Windows, and many ISPs.  Just find an ISP that supports it (it costs 
extra) and configure your Linux router to do it.

3.  Demand dial Linux router is a very common thing.  Read up on diald for 
more info, though pppd can also do simple demand dialing by itself (Coyote 
Linux does it this way).

You can schedule them, or you can from a command prompt type "up2date -u" to have it 
done automagically, or just "up2date" to interact with a few dialog boxes.

All of the above assumes a later up2date version IIRC 2.4 or so, and RH 7.2.

I would think, at least theoretically, that you could configure
IPTables to round-robin the masqueraded outbound TCP connections
between the two modem interfaces, but I've never tried it before.

Thanks Dan.

I typed the command " /sbin/service rhnsd status " and it worked.  It says 
rhnsd  (pid2648) is running.

I did it my user account rather than root, as I don't want to log out while 
waiting for this download.

Is there anyway to get around the 2 hour wait?

Subject: A [PLUG] for hdparm
Message-ID: <3C9B9E9E.B6FEBF77@infotects.com>

Hi all,

Pardon the pun, but I think the performance gained by some
logical tweaking of hdparm is worth sharing.

First off, this tool does have the ability to scramble your
harddrive beyond recognition -- backup before trying
anything with this tool!

Now the good news, I have an AMD 1.3 Gig with an AMD 761
chipset and a Maxtor 40 Gig drive.  When I initially ran

hdparm -Tt /dev/hda

the buffered read time was pathetic - around 2.2 Meg/s (not
cool for an ATA 100 drive and chipset).

To start gathering information I used

hdparm /dev/hda

and found out that 32-bit was off, as well as dma.  Turning
on 32-bit (the -c3 switch) brought the read time to about
2.5 Meg/s (still not too cool).  Turning on dma
(unspecified, just turning it on with -d1) brought the read
time to 40 Megs/s!!

This is not a typo, almost 20 times faster!!  Since the
drive itself is not capable of pulling data off its platters
at the nominal 100 Meg/s, I think I'm going to stop here.

I did try the unmaskirq setting (-u1), but had a total
system lock-up trying to startx.

It seems to me that the 32-bit and the dma settings are
pretty much no-brainers, no reason not to try them.  Mozilla
sure does load faster now.

Again, exercise caution when using this tool, always backup
everything.

Good Luck

Derek Loree

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20020322130535.01f03c38@127.0.0.1>

I just received four Sunfire 280R machines for our lab at Tripwire.

I put in the video card, and installed the machines in my rack. Hooked up 
the video/keyboard/mouse, and away I go.

Turn on the key, push the start button.

Video come up, and the following message is displayed:

Boot device: disk       File and args:
krtld: load_exec: fail to expand cpu/$CPU
krtld: error during initial load/link phase
panic - boot: exitto64 returned from client program
Program terminated
ok

I've also tried to "boot cdrom" to try installing Solaris 8. I get the same 
message, except for the boot device.

The only hits of any perceived relevance from google show this as a message 
you get when the Ultra Sparc III tries to boot with an unsupported version 
of Solaris. According to the documentation, any Solaris 8 from 1/01 on 
should be good. I've tried 4/01 and 7/01. I'm just finishing up a 2/02 
download, but I'm not optimistic.

Anyone out there have any ideas on this?

Yeah, but alternatives are hard to come by. But what the heck, I'll ask
the general question anyway.

So I've got an in-house staffer that needs to share some file space with 
an out-of-town client. Both need read-write access to this space. The 
client's view of the hosting machine must be limited to this space. The 
client may or may not be able to use a Unix/Linux box on their end. 
(We're checking on that.) For now we're assuming the client's end is a 
Windows box. What are my options for creating this shared file space?

I tried to create scp-only account but this appears to be impossible. Any 
other ideas?

You might want to check that the PROM is running 64 bit. There's a setting
for it but I can't recall it. A complete shot in the dark, Russ, but worth a
try. Are they single processors?

remember that big T gives you cached performance.  Stick with little t
for actual disk througput.  Even better use bonnie or tiotest.

However in general I have found -t to give a good enough indication of
performance.  Big T is interesting in that it gives you a good
indication of your system RAM performance.

The DMA setting will be turned on automagically if you compile the
kernel with the correct options, in particular the "enable DMA by
default" option.  You must also check off support for the MOBO chipset
being used.

In most cases this is sufficient.

Here's the hdparm stuff I've stuck in rc.local on my home machine. As
Derek mentioned, however, your mileage may vary significantly...

# hdparm magic:

Why not a hidden ftp chrooted dir?

Is CVS out of the question?  There are Windows clients.  How about creating 
a shell account for the out-of-towner and put them both in the same group? 
  If you wanted to really limit the account you could make a chroot 
jailThen everyone could use ssh.

At the 'ok' prompt, try 'show-disks' - your disk alias might be corrupt. 
After show-disks, the OBP should tell you how to set the correct alias for 
your disk.

Since it affects the CD-ROM as well, I'd say the alias is set to select a 
different controller than the one you've currently got installed.

Yeah, these are single proc boxes. I also just got two Blade 1000's that 
have dual procs... They booted right up. :/

I'm a bit disconcerted, because the specs on the sunstore site, and the 
invoice say dual power supply... These only have one power supply. I'm 
wondering if something else was "overlooked" in the config department...

Hello all, I have a problem thats very curious... I have had this same 
problem with many files, but this is just an example. I have been trying 
to install 'quake 1', from the package 'sqauke' (for SVGA). I actually 
wanted to give ttyquake a run, and squake is required. Anyway, when I try 
to run it with bash, i get
$ ./squake
./squake: Command not found.

$ ls -l squake
-rwxr-xr-x    1 pheph    pheph      438376 Aug  7  1997 squake

$ file squake
squake: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1, dynamically 
linked (uses shared libs), not stripped

$ ldd squake
/usr/bin/ldd: ./squake: No such file or directory

So it seems like the 'file' exists, but anything that attempts to access 
it as an executable thinks it doesn't exist... Any clues? Thanx,
-Scott

Typically, this means the binary in question was linked against a
version of libc that's not available on your system, e.g., libc.so.5.
Some (most?) distributions make it available via an optional package
like the libc-5.blah rpm from Red Hat.

I find that time servers tend to

True, the cached performance didn't change at all, it stayed at 166 Meg/s

This was not the case for me, I have custom compiled my kernel, so I know
that I have enable DMA by default and the correct MOBO chipset (though
this is the AMD 761 which is not as mature as some of the other chipsets)
though I just got to thinking that the VIA southbridge may need something
else as well... better check that out.

Did I mention that I LOVE Linux!  The only reboot that I had to do during
all this testing was when the system did the total lock up!

I'd refer you to the up2date stuff again.
Mike De La Mater posted earlier that you can do:

up2date -u

to update w/o any intervention required or:

up2date

to use the gui installer.

 I've known that for years, and so have several other PLUG members.
 Debian has always been the superiour distribution.

 I think it's a waste of time.  You'd do better to spend the time
 contributing to the Debian project as a package maintainer and

 Put on your googles if you know the filename...  The Debian

I have a Redhat 7.2 box that I need to install some RPM's that require

 Anyone have any knowledge of how to build a backward compatible RPM for

Subject: [PLUG] Why RedHat?


I was wondering why most, or at least many, of the people who write on
this list use Red Hat. It seems like RH is considered the standard linux
distribution in other circles as well.

>From what I saw of it a few years ago, (version 7.0) it didn't seem to
support any special features not supported by Debian. And after using
Debian's APT for a while, it's difficult for me to imagine using an OS
without it. The 'rpms' don't seem very useful; you still have to find
the program's dependencies and download/update them, it would seem. And
while I understand there is some kind of apt-like program for RH, its
use doesn't seem very prevalent.

I've heard that RH is easier to install, but when I tried it (v7.0) it
didn't seem any easier than Debian. Perhaps it has improved in recent
versions. Also ease of installation seems like a poor reason to choose
an OS, given that this is a one-time experience, whereas installing and
updating programs on the OS is continual.

Also, while I can see how Red Hat's tech support could be useful, none
of the RedHat users I've met have ever utilized it.

I don't mean to provoke an argument, I'm just curious why people use Red
Hat when (from what I can see) Debian is a better distribution.

Dave,

  I've run into upgrades that want a higher or lower library number than I
have installed. What I've done is make a soft link from the base library to
the number the application wants to see. So far it's worked every time for
me.

HTH,

One method I've seen used is to make a symbolic link from libcrypto.so.3 to
libcrypto.so.2.

If you're lazy, you might try

  # cd /lib
  # ln -s libcrypto.so.0.9.6b libcrypto.so.3
  # /sbin/ldconfig

and see what happens :-) If it doesn't work, make sure you delete your
new symlink and re-run ldconfig.

Otherwise, you'll need the openssh source rpm (.src.rpm). You might try
'rpm --rebuild openssh-<vers>.src.rpm' to see if it recompiles out of
the box. If not, let the list know, and one of us will walk you through
the fairly painless process of editing the .spec file to work for you.

Because the prior poster in this thread dissed FTP, so I thought I'd
inquire about other options. No other reason.

I thought of CVS but the files will all be binaries. It would work (and I 
even know how to do it already) but it seems kind of silly for a project 
that isn't mostly text and where no revision control is desired.

I was hoping to avoid a shell account but it may come down to that.
Maybe I'll have more luck creating a chroot shell account than I did
with a creating a chroot ftp account.

If your on a network with a win2k server, you've got a lot of work to do (I won't
bore the list with reg hacking; email me if you can't find it in M$ knowledge
base).  If not, then you might just need to set the OS level in the smb.conf to a
number higher than your NT4 server (try 64 or 128).  FYI, I had a smooth running smb
setup mixed with a win2k domain that (out of the blue) stopped allowing browsing
after about 3 months (I could "search" for them, but couldn't browse to them --
stupid OS), I had to call M$ support on that one.

The relavance of this is dependant on where it is trying to get its name, the
elected-behind-your-back WINS server may be dishing it out.

Did I mention that I LOVE Linux? (Elections are held out in the open, and at the
least end up in your syslog.)

I actually downloaded the sourcecode which included a spec file, luckily 
for me, and did...
rpm -ts openssh-<ver>.tar.gz
and then...
rpm --rebuild openssh-<ver>.src.rpm
then installed the rpm.  Should that have worked?  I even tried to 
install both versions at the same time.  Still won't fly...  should I 
just try the symlink?   I was warned against that.

Apache-ssl and WebDAV (known as Internet folders in M$ land) is a reasonable
solution, but kind of a PITA to set up.  However, like most linux things, once it
is set up, keeping it running is fairly easy.

I also like pscp.exe that comes with the PuTTY suite, but I don't know of a GUI
for it.

Hope that gives you some ideas.

Subject: [PLUG] tool for finding bracket errors?
Message-ID: <3C9BCED8.A2AF4B5B@infotects.com>

Hi all,

I have this annoying error while trying to install a custom
rolled kernel package, and would like to know if anyone has
any ideas for fixing it.  The error looks like:

Setting up kernel-image-2.4.18 (10.00.Custom) ...
Missing right curly or square bracket at
/var/lib/dpkg/info/kernel-image-2.4.18.postinst line 1685,
at end of
line
syntax error at
/var/lib/dpkg/info/kernel-image-2.4.18.postinst line
1685, at EOF
Execution of /var/lib/dpkg/info/kernel-image-2.4.18.postinst
aborted due
to compilation errors.

I've looked at the postinst script and found out 3 things:

1) it is a Perl script (and I don't know Perl)
2) it is very large for a human to poke through looking for
pairs of brackets
3) there are lots of curly brackets in there.

I tried just adding a curly bracket (then another and
another) at the end, same error.

My question is, is there a tool that will match pairs of
brackets and find the dangler(s)?

TIA

A.1.1 Does PuTTY support SSH v2?

Yes. SSH v2 support has been available in PuTTY since version 0.50. However, 
currently the default SSH protocol is v1; to select SSH v2 if your server 
supports both, go to the SSH panel and change the Preferred SSH protocol 
version option.

Public key authentication (both RSA and DSA) in SSH v2 is new in version 0.52.

An M$ told you what ?

I have win2k on my network, but I'm not trying to use it as a server.
Do I still have to hack it ?

Here's the relevant sections from my smb.conf (which I should have
posted in the original message).

   os level = 65
   domain master = yes
   local master = yes
   preferred master = yes

So it should be the master, eh comrade ?

Sorry, I wasn't very clear in my message. I meant don't think _WinSCP_
does ssh2, which was the link that got snipped out of the abovemessage. Nice gui for the cli-wary crowd though. Looks/acts like most any
other Windows FTP client.

OK - so now I'm really confused.

I think I may have had the famous, I changed the config file but the

I did a killall on smbd AND nmbd and when I look in my syslog file I

 I've seen this also; it's a bug in that version of "kernel-package".
 See if there's an update, then run the "make-kpkg ... kernel_image"
 agian (no need to clean; it should use what's already built if you
 use the same command line) and see if it installs correctly.

 I also know how to find a missing brace, paren (slotski) or bracket,
 and how to fix that particular script....

 Yes.

 Nope. That would take way too long.  But you are trying to fix it.
 Did you try to run "reportbug" and see if a similar bug has already
 been reported?

    Derek> My question is, is there a tool that will match pairs of

 XEmacs or GNU Emacs, of course.  Since it's a right brace or bracket
 that is missing, start at the end of the file.  Use `backward-sexp':

8<----------------------------------------------------------------->8
M-left runs `backward-sexp'

`backward-sexp' is an interactive compiled Lisp function
  -- loaded from "/usr/local/src/karlheg/XEmacs/run-in-place.mule/lisp/lisp.elc"
(backward-sexp &optional ARG)

Documentation:
Move backward across one balanced expression (sexp).
With argument, do it that many times.  Negative arg -N means
move forward across N balanced expressions.
8<----------------------------------------------------------------->8

 Just hold down M-left (meta key and left keypad arrow) until it runs
 into a left brace or bracket that it cannot cross.  The
 <direction>-sexp movements only cross entire blocks of code -- a
 symbol, a parenthesized block, a string...  (in contrast to
 <direction>-word, which move a word at a time and can move out of a
 brace set...)

 Once you find the left brace that has a missing right brace, you must
 eyeball the code and try to figure out where the right brace belongs.

 If there's no update in "unstable", try pulling the one from
 "testing", ok?  Unless you figure out where to stick that brace.

Subject: [PLUG] downloading a website (that has java scripts, &c.)
Message-ID: <20020323012246.EE7A810E055@pons.enet.sharplabs.com>

As I've revealed many times in the past, I'm pretty much of an
ignoramous when it comes to lots of areas that most on PLUG know
a great deal about.  Here's yet one more.

My (12 year old) daughter is giving a talk on lasers on Monday
(something I  _do_ know something about (finally!!)).

She has cobbled together a nice talk, based on what I've taught her
but it lacks one thing: some nice "demos" of the various ideas.  She's
used xfig to draw some pictures of "population inversion", "light
pumping" &c., but I'd like to go further.

She's giving it on my laptop using powerpoint (but running under
win4lin on linux :-).

So what's this got to do with downloading the contents of a website,
you ask?  Well, there's a wonderful educational physics site

www.colorado.edu/physics/2000

which has a subsection on lasers.  There are some  gorgeous Java applets
that would make perfect little on-screen demos.

So I tried downloading the whole site with

`wget -r -l 8 -k -nh -p http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000'

and got a bunch of stuff (about 9.5 Megs worth).

All the web pages, the .jpg images, &c. appear to be there.

But the "applets" directory is nearly empty.  Furthermore the site
uses (according to a colleague) "dynamic web pages".  So, e.g. index.html
is (evidently) generated by something called index.pl (a Perl script?).
When I click on my local copy of index.html (which references index.pl)
Netscapce asks me if I want to download it.  Not the behaviour I was expecting.

Anyway, all this is way out of my areas of expertise (and comfort zone).
Can you sing: "Donno much about java_scripts, donno much about ...)

You get the idea.

Can anyone help me?  She needs only three or four of the applets but I
thought it would be oh, so much easier to simply download the whole
she-bang and then just have the desired applets running in Netscrape
and switch to them as needed (win4lin/windows on one x-server on
VT <ctl-F8>,  KDE/netscrape on another server on VT <ctl-F7>.

I do it all the time.


Thanks
Dean

 I see no dependancy on "libcrypto" or on "libssl"...  Or on Red Hat

Description: Secure rlogin/rsh/rcp replacement (OpenSSH)
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It is intended as a replacement for rlogin, rsh and rcp, and can be
 used to provide applications with a secure communication channel.

 In some countries, particularly Russia, Iraq, Pakistan, and France, it
 may be illegal to use any encryption at all without a special permit.

Caveat: I've never used the 'rpm -t' in any of its incarnations.

I poked around inside the openssh-3.1p1 tarball and found three .spec
files:

[heinlein at billings openssh-3.1p1]$ find . -name \*.spec
./contrib/caldera/openssh.spec
./contrib/redhat/openssh.spec
./contrib/suse/openssh.spec

I don't know how rpm decides which one to use, but one thingj's for
sure: none of them make mention of a libcrypto.so.3. So it's really
tough for me to figure out how such a dependency came into being.

If you have the time, do 'rpm -i openssh-<ver>.src.rpm' and post the
openssh.spec file that ends up in /usr/src/redhat/SPECS, ok?

Anyone want to setup a Stratum 2 server for PLUG use?  Once a day is all I

Unplug all linux boxes, disable the "browsing service" on all windoze
boxes except for the one you want to be the WINS server, and create a good
mantra.  I don't remember the reg key off the top of my head, if you can't
find it, I can come up with it on Monday.

There is a difference between the OS level of workstation (PRO) and
server.  Just having the server on the network (doesn't matter if it is
doing server stuff or not) is enough.  WINS was designed to run the
network on its own. (Who is your network administrator now?)

If the win2k is server, no, it rigs the election with an OS level of 128
(though as I found out, it can rig the election in other ways too, but it
takes time).  I can't find my SAMBA book right now, but IIRC there should
only be one type of master, local should be good enough if you only have
one workgroup.

Good Luck, you'll need it.

WOW!!  It does a MUCH better job of browsing local files than winexplorer, I can see all those d**n triple hidden folders in the IE5 cache
directory (the ones that don't show even when the "show all files, show system files and don't hide anything" settings are selected), I sure
hope someday to not have to deal with M$ B$ anymore.

Thanks for the tool!

I think you're stuck on this one. From the ldd(1) man page:

BUGS
       ldd will not work with some extremely old  programs  which
       were  linked  before ldd support was added to the compiler
       releases.  If you use ldd on one of  these  programs,  the
       program  will attempt to run with argc = 0 and the results
       will be unpredictable.

'Shift - 5' in vi will do this.  Put the cursor over an opening brace,
hold down 'shift', hit '5', and the cursor should jump to the closing
brace.  If there is no matching brace, vi beeps its complaint.

Of course, this implies a fair amount of manual intervention in a file
1000+ lines long...

What a waste of time!  There's already a much better document at
http://www.cymru.com/~robt/Docs/Articles/secure-bind-template.html
that doesn't include lots of time-wasting nonsense about using Emacs
as a probulator and zone-file maintainer.  And it has recommendations
about ACLs and such that your document lacks.

I received 2 updates with the website method, then a failure on the 3rd 
update and it stopped downloading.

I then used both commands as you wrote, and they started to work, connected 
to Red Hat just fine...then they failed with error 404.  

Next I scheduled a bunch of updates through the Red Hat website. Now I have 
had this computer online for 7 1/2 hours waiting and trying to do the web 
scheduled updates. I am getting tired of this.

I am quickly losing respect for Red Hat. This is a lousy way to treat a 
paying customer.  Is this the norm for them or a fluke?

I just did an `up2date' with no problems...


The Red Hat Update Agent has finished installing
 the following packages successfully:

 php-4.0.6-15
 php-devel-4.0.6-15
 php-imap-4.0.6-15
 php-ldap-4.0.6-15
 php-manual-4.0.6-15
 php-mysql-4.0.6-15
 php-odbc-4.0.6-15
 php-pgsql-4.0.6-15
 vnc-3.3.3r2-18.4
 vnc-doc-3.3.3r2-18.4
 vnc-server-3.3.3r2-18.4

A tad over 19Mb worth (php-manual >15Mb). It took all of 5 minutes to pull
down the rpms and another 6 minutes to install them on my lil' ol' P-Pro 200
SMP box (okay, so I've got a 1.5Mbps ADSL pipe). Not sure why you're having
problems, Robert - unless TTL isn't your friend.

good luck,
Sandy

Other than running up2date (and I have one system that that simply
doen't work on) you can run rhn_check directly. As far as I can
tell rhnsd just wakes up every two hours (unless you configure it
for one) and runs rhn_check. rhnsd and rhn_check both have man
pages BTW.

I have had success, on my system that can't use up2date, scheduling
a bunch of updates and then running rhn_check by hand.

I've never used up2date myself, preferring a good old-fashioned ftp mirror 
like ftp://ftp.orst.edu/.1/ftp.redhat.com/linux/updates/7.2/en/os/i386
(which is many times faster than RH's own servers)

I agree that RH's update info/procedures suck.  For example, say you care 
about version 7.0 of their distribution.  The Errata page on their web site 
stops in November of last year.  Yet, if you look at Errata page for 7.2, 
you will find relevelnt packages for 7.0 that you wouldn't have know about 
otherwise.

At least their ftp server (and mirrors) carry the updates for each release. 
  So, a good, close, fast mirror is your friend.  Log in and poke around to 
get a feel for what's available.

Personally, I maintain my own mirror for 7.0 & 7.2 updates because that's 
what I'm running.  If you want to get your hands a little dirty, first 
update your *rpm* packages themselves.  The PLUG archives contain a thread 
about how the rpm package manager itself is broken in 7.2.  Once that's 
fixed, you can do the following,

rpm -Fvh 
ftp://ftp.orst.edu/.1/ftp.redhat.com/linux/updates/7.2/en/os/i386/zlib*

(all on one line).  This will download, then freshen zlib if you have an 
older version.  You can substitute anything for zlib* (a*, XFree*, z*).

This still doesn't lead to nirvana.  When you hit a package, like apache*, 
it will fail because the new apache has dependencies that don't start with 
"a*".  It will tell you what you need.  In those few cases, download all 
the required rpms in a fresh dir so you have them locally.  Then use rpm to 
Freshen or Update those files to make apache happy.

Good luck,
Kyle Accardi

Red Hat but they put you on their schedule for hours and then don't start 
the download.  up2date (and the -u too version) just produces error 404 
(which probably means they want my Visa number via command line).  It makes 
me think Bill Gates has an eeeevil brother running Red Hat and Microsoft 
should be renamed White Hat for creating a free Windows Update that 
actually works most of the time. Rant over.

So now I want to try Debian again, but when I installed Debian 2.2 on my 
Dell 4100 a while back all looked fine until reboot.  It does not seem able 
to work with nVidia video cards with the default install, or does not like 
Dell 4100's, or it just hates me.

Other than failing to load the GUI and the associated error messages, that 
install seemed to have a working command line.  I don't remember the error 
messages it spit out at me and gave up on it.

Now I want to try again, but want to know if anyone has successfully 
installed it on a Dell 4100, PIII 1000Mhz, 512MB Ram, Dell (OEM Brand?) 
nVidia GForce2GTS 32MB DDR.

Is there a special procedure or a file I should download prior to get it to 
work?  Or should I avoid it for now and wait for future updates?

Thanks
Robert

I appriciate the help, but this is still waaaay too advanced for my Linux 
skills.  There were over 100 updates listed and I'm afraid I'd either lose 
my sanity or go back to Windows 3.0 before updating this many strange 
looking (at least to me) files manually.

They are particularily slammed by the zlib issue.  All distros are in the 
same boat.  You can update any distro w/o $ if you use ftp mirrors.  Don't 
pay for updates, they are free.

I've had bad luck w/nVidia on Dell.  Those cards *are* oem'd for Dell and 
are like nothing else on Earth.  If you got RH and X working on this 
machine, you're way ahead.

If you are running a workstation that intermittently connects to the 
internet, there are very few that are crucial.

I understand the desire to keep everything updated, even things I'm not 
currently using.

IMO, these should be updated (the rest can wait)

e2fsprogs 
	if you're using any ext3 filesystems
iptables 
	if you're providing firewalling on this machine

util-linux		core functionality


That will probably be enough.  Don't sweat it.  Like I said, any distro of 
the same age is going to have a similiar number of updates.

Yes.  It ran fine for 2 or 3 minutes then came back with the error 404 
cannot connect message, although it DID connect at first.

Actually I haven't had anything run right on the Dell other than Windows 
2000.  Thanks for letting me know it's not me!

I am running Red Hat on an Alienware something or other, on which I 
recently replaced the defective motherboard with another more recent FIC 
AD11.  I thought this was the difficult computer so never even tried Debian 
on it. I will correct that soon...

If I want to keep Red Hat, my $60, and my sanity, I will probably have to 
open the Red Hat Linux Bible everyday and become a Linux geek.

If you install Linux on the Dell, swap out the video card with something 
more mainstream (Matrox, ATI) and remove the DS jumper on the IDE drives. 
Should be fine.

Message-ID: <CE8B74E0F3F5D311B97F00508B6BF7AA039201F1@msnbex05.bn.usi.net>

The first thing that makes this a tricky proposition are the frames...  When
you go to http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000 right click in Netscape on
the main frame and chose "Open frame in a new window."  First problem
solved.

Now go to your applets...  I think the URLs you are looking for are:

http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/lasers/index.html
http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/lasers/lasers2.html
http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/lasers/lasers3.html
http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/lasers/lasers4.html

Go ahead and use wget (or I like curl) to get these...  Now, you say your
having problems with the applets...  I'll walk you through the first one:

View the source of the first page...  You'll see, in APPLET tags:

CODE="laser.LaserApplet" CODEBASE="../applets"

Now, open up http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/applets/laser.LaserApplet,
you won't get anything.  Very frustrating...  But what kind of a name for an
applet is laser.LaserApplet?  It should have an extension of .class.
Furthermore, on the Java platform, a dot shows the package heirarchy, which
is in turn reflected by the file system...  So, open up:

http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/applets/laser/LaserApplet.class and
you'll be prompted to download the file...  Download it.

Now, when you're daughter demonstrates this to her class, I recommend
setting up Apache on the laptop to serve the HTML and Applets...  If I
remember correctly, this makes things a lot easier.

Good luck!

Subject: [PLUG] downloading a website (that has java scripts, &c.)



As I've revealed many times in the past, I'm pretty much of an ignoramous
when it comes to lots of areas that most on PLUG know a great deal about.
Here's yet one more.

My (12 year old) daughter is giving a talk on lasers on Monday (something I
_do_ know something about (finally!!)).

She has cobbled together a nice talk, based on what I've taught her but it
lacks one thing: some nice "demos" of the various ideas.  She's used xfig to
draw some pictures of "population inversion", "light pumping" &c., but I'd
like to go further.

She's giving it on my laptop using powerpoint (but running under win4lin on
linux :-).

So what's this got to do with downloading the contents of a website, you
ask?  Well, there's a wonderful educational physics site

www.colorado.edu/physics/2000

which has a subsection on lasers.  There are some  gorgeous Java applets
that would make perfect little on-screen demos.

So I tried downloading the whole site with

`wget -r -l 8 -k -nh -p http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000'

and got a bunch of stuff (about 9.5 Megs worth).

All the web pages, the .jpg images, &c. appear to be there.

But the "applets" directory is nearly empty.  Furthermore the site uses
(according to a colleague) "dynamic web pages".  So, e.g. index.html is
(evidently) generated by something called index.pl (a Perl script?). When I
click on my local copy of index.html (which references index.pl) Netscapce
asks me if I want to download it.  Not the behaviour I was expecting.

Anyway, all this is way out of my areas of expertise (and comfort zone). Can
you sing: "Donno much about java_scripts, donno much about ...)

You get the idea.

Can anyone help me?  She needs only three or four of the applets but I
thought it would be oh, so much easier to simply download the whole she-bang
and then just have the desired applets running in Netscrape and switch to
them as needed (win4lin/windows on one x-server on VT <ctl-F8>,
KDE/netscrape on another server on VT <ctl-F7>.

I do it all the time.


Thanks
Dean

I'm bored tonight waiting for the mysterious Red Hat download to begin, so 
I installed a spare hard drive into the Dell and installed Red Hat 7.2 
without a problem. It found and selected the nVidia GForce2GTS 32MB DDR 
during the install. I expected that since I have the Dell OEM version of 
the card it would fail, but it booted right into KDE and then Gnome without 
a problem. Either Dell was not propritary in my case or Red Hat 7.2 became 
Dell aware.

Is there a way to manually apply filters to mail in your inbox?  i can 
not find it in help or on the web site.  I have Imap set up and read my 
mail remotely using Pine.  When I get home I use Mozilla and when the 
inbox on my server is opened unread messages go to the filtered folders. 
 The read mail is still in my inbox.

Naw, don't even buy the book.  You've got a wealth of information already 
installed.  Use the `man` pages.  From an xterm type `man <command>` if 
you're not sure of the name of the <command>, type `apropos <some_string>`

Failing that, google is everyone's friend.  Cut-and-paste error messages in 
the search box and you'll find something.  And if that don't do it for you, 
ask PLUG, I think there's a few Linux geeks on the list.

You'll almost have to do that with any distro; probably even more
with Debian.  And with Debian, you won't have a "bible" to open
for yourself, you'll have to go to Pioneer Square where Karl is
everyday standing on his soap-box reciting scripture, but it'll be
in Emacs LISP so it won't make sense anyway!

Drive Select.  Located with the normal drive jumpers.  Don't recall the 
particulars, but I believe it was an attempt to let IDE drives self-manage 
themselves with respect to who was master and who was slave.  An attempt at 
plug and pray, but it usually makes things more complicated.

Hopefully, someone will correct me.

My ancient Toshiba laptop works just fine with a Lucent Bronze

Here is what someone else did for their Dell 8100
notebook.  I gather it should be somewaht similar for
the Dell 4100.

You need the updated drivers from Nvidia
(http://www.nvidia.com). Down load the latest drivers,
both the NVIDIA_GLX-1.0-2313.i386.rpm and 
NVIDIA_kernel-1.0-2313.rh72up.i386.rpm, and then
install them, the kernel one first. 

You also need a working XF86Config-4 file. Go to the
bottom of the page at
http://home.olemiss.edu/~tschumpr/i8100.html
and grab the one for your resolution there and then
copy it to the appropriate place. 

Also goto the path
http://www.linux-laptop.net/dell.html for more
information on configuring Linux on you Inspiron 8100.
Linux works great on it.

Be careful with the binary-only NVidia drivers; they caused frequent
lock-ups with my card.  Given what I know about NVidia now, I wish
I hadn't bought an NVidia card.  The XFree 'nv' driver has been
rock solid for me, albeit without 3D accelleration.  Alan doesn't
seem to have had any problems with with binary-only drivers, so YMMV.

Plugged them into Xconfigurator with XF86_SVGA and got

Currently I use the "Rules" feature in Pine. To play with this, go to the
main menu, select "Setup" and press 'R' for "Rules", then "F" for filter.
Filtering only occurs when you start up pine, however, so this may not be
a good solution if you're also running Mozilla as an email client. A
second problem with pine's filters is that mail will be duplicated if you
have multiple pine processes running.

A much better method is "procmail" which will sort your mail into folders
for later retrieval. Unfortunately, I find the syntax of procmail rules
baffling; it seems unlike any scripting language I know. Perhaps you can
find a good tutorial on procmail, or someone on the list can write up a
sample recipe. (I'd like to learn how to auto-respond to emails
containing .doc attachments with a polite letter. Also how to redirect and
decline email from hotmail and msn accounts. For example, if someone sends
me email from an msn account, a polite letter of rejection "I decline
email from the following domains..." is sent back.)

Any procmail wizards out there? :)

I am looking for an ISP for a business I am thinking of starting.  I

It would also be nice if they are reasonably priced.

Subject: [PLUG] Another PHP & MySQL problem
Message-ID: <3C9CA9EE.39AAE257@attbi.com>

I'm working on another exercise in the book, "PHP and MySQL Web
Development" and have hit another problem. For this exercise, the
authors are using the technique of collecting related code in files and
using include, include_once, or require_once to use the code.

The exercise in chapter 25 if building a shopping cart. All the code is
supplied on a CD, which I have copied onto my hard disk in the directory
/var/www/html/PHPandMySQLbook/source/chapter25. I have an index.php file
in /var/www/html from which I link to the index.php file in the
directory containing the files for chapter 25.

When I click on that link, I get the following error message:

Fatal error: Cannot redeclare db_connect() in db_fns.php on line 3

Chapter 25's index.php starts with this line:

  include ('book_sc_fns.php');

book_sc_fns.php starts with this line:

  include_once("db_fns.php");

And db_fns.php starts like this:

function db_connect()
{
   $result = @mysql_pconnect("localhost", "book_sc", "password");
   if (!$result)
      return false;
   if (!@mysql_select_db("book_sc"))
      return false;

   return $result;
}

The database book_sc was created using the mysql monitor, and yes, the
password is "password." (It's an exercise. The real world will never see
it.)

Since the line, "function db_connect()" only shows up once, I don't see
how it could have been previously declared. Any ideas?

Are you sure that the pages you are including don't include other pages
that declare the function as well, causing the redeclaring of the
function?

Yes. I searched for the string, 

  function db_connect()

in every file in the directory and found it just the one time.

Subject: [PLUG] floppyfw  SIOCADDRT
Message-ID: <NFBBKJHBELICGFPLNOKBIECEFLAA.steve@blakeusa.net>

I'm getting this message at boot on floppyfw....
"SIOCADDRT: Network is unreachable" is a message on the floppyfw boot
screen.

plus....
I cannot ping DEFAULT_GATEWAY from inside private LAN.

and....
I can ping INSIDE_IP on eth1 and OUTSIDE_IP on eth0.

Therefore, I suspect I'm getting this message because the DEFAULT_GATEWAY
simply cannot be seen by floppyfw.
Question #1: Is this a reasonable conclusion?


I also believe this condition is not the fault of my new floppyfw
installation, and I have been concentrating my diagnostics on the new
RoamAbout Wireless Gateway going in at the same time.


Question #2. What specifically can be broke when the message
 "SIOCADDRT: Network is unreachable" appears following "Initializing
network:"  when floppyfw boots?



Thank you,

If db_fns.php is included twice, then db_connect will be declared 
twice.  Check to see if book_sc_fns.php or db_fns.php is included more than 
once.

What might be happening is that the file containing the db_connect() is 
being included by a require() or include() statement twice...

I've noticed something strange before also.....

The example is:
/file1.php:
<?
         include_once('file1_include.php');
         include_once('file1_linked_include.php');
?>

/file1_include.php:
<?
         function test () {};
?>

/file1_linked_include.php ---symbolic link---> file1_include.php

That may cause problems with the test function being redeclared... I had 
this happen once

index.php has these lines:

<?

  // The shopping cart needs sessions, so start one
  session_start();
  do_html_header("Welcome to Book-O-Rama");

  echo "<p>Please choose a category:</p>";

  if(session_is_registered("admin_user"))
  {
    display_button("admin.php", "admin-menu", "Admin Menu");
  }

  do_html_footer();
?>

book_sc_fns.php has these lines:

<?

  include_once("db_fns.php");
  include_once("data_valid_fns.php");
  include_once("output_fns.php");
  include_once("book_fns.php");
  include_once("user_auth_fns.php");
  include_once("admin_fns.php");
  include_once("order_fns.php");

?>

The file db_fns.php has these lines:

<?

function db_connect()
{
   $result = @mysql_pconnect("localhost", "book_sc", "password");
   if (!$result)
      return false;
   if (!@mysql_select_db("book_sc"))
      return false;

   return $result;
}

function db_result_to_array($result)
{
   $res_array = array();

   for ($count=0; $row = @mysql_fetch_array($result); $count++)
     $res_array[$count] = $row;

   return $res_array;
}

?>

No other file contains function db_connect().

Some folks using DOS around here caught an old Boot Sector Virus

these from back in the day when I did PC support and virii spread mostly 
by way of floppy disk usage.

At FREE GEEK we get a lot of equipment that may not have been touched 
since that era.

I was wondering if these virii can infect a Linux based system, and how 
I would check for their existence if they can.

I have an allegedly infected floppy disk and plenty of old linux boxen

Well, if you had an infected floppy, booted from it, you could infect 
your bootsector.  I'm not sure if this would screw LILO or Grub since 
most viruses would assume DOS.  The safest way to deaL with unknown 
equipment is to just low level format it.

Got this from GoDaddy.com, the registrar for my domain.  Anybody heard anything

this seems beyond the pale.


 

Please be aware that Verisign, Inc. (formerly Network Solutions) is sending via
the US Mail, what we believe to be deceptive and predatory domain expiration
notices.  

The purpose behind these notices is to get the unsuspecting customer to
transfer to and renew their domain name(s) with Verisign Inc. at significantly
higher prices.

The domain expiration notices are designed so that it is not obvious that the
notices are from Verisign, Inc. as opposed to Go Daddy Software. To see a copy
of one of these deceptive expiration notices, please go to the following URL:
http://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/private_vsrn.asp?display=letter.

Those customers who fall prey to the Verisign, Inc. scheme will have their
domain name(s) renewed at a price more than 3 times higher than would be the
case if they renewed with Go Daddy Software. 

For a .com, .net or .org domain name renewal, the victimized customer would pay
$29.00 to Verisign, Inc. instead of the $8.95 charged by Go Daddy Software.  

Those customers who fall prey to this scheme, will not receive any better
service or value.  They will however be tricked out of $20.05 per domain name.

Renewal notices from Go Daddy Software are sent via email, and always mention
the Go Daddy name.  You can be sure that any communications you receive
concerning your domain name that do not explicitly and obviously display the Go
Daddy name are not from Go Daddy Software.

If you believe, as we do, that this practice of Verisign Inc. is misleading,
predatory and improper, we invite you to make your feelings known by writing to
ICANN (who is the governing body for all Registrar?s and Registries) and to
Verisign Registry.  Email links for both are provided below.

I'm looking to develop a procedure to determine IF a boot sector virus 
has infected a box. It's not practical to low level format all the 
drives every time we think any computer might have a boot sector virus.

I read about his on a hosting forum...I haven't seen the exact email
that VeriSign sent out, but I have seen comments from people who run
various domain registrars besides GoDaddy.com that say several of their
customers either switched or almost did because they were misled and
trying to switch to VeriSign.

Sadly, this doesn't surprise me in the least though.  Judging from my
past experiences with Network Solutions in addition to their past
business practices they have some serious ethical issues...hopefully
some of the competing registrars have the resources to follow up on this
through legal means.

Very strange. Affordablehost.com sent some similar warnings about a
similar practice - but the offender wasn't NSI, it was some registrar
I'd never heard of.

db_fns.php does not appear in any of the files except user_auth_fns.php,
which starts out with:

  require_once("db_fns.php");

By commenting out that require_once, the page opens, and most of the
entire site seems to work, though it will take a bit of playing with to
test everything.

Thanks for the idea. Now I can work through the chapter and maybe figure
out how to make whatever doesn't work, work.

  I was getting the same letters from, IIRC, 'register.com'. Of course, the
expiration dates ("... coming up soon") were in 2003 and 2004, but they
glossed over that fact.

  My impression was of low-class operators trying to sneak one over the
plate when the unwary aren't watching. I shredded them. What gave me pause,
however, is the similarity of their name to that of my former registrar,
'regiatrar.com'. Very similar and easy to confuse 'register' and
'registrar'.

  Of course, VeriSign (as the agent for Network Solutions) bought out
registrars.com and that started my search for a new registrar. Found one ...
cannot remember who now (must be a senior moment, eh?).

There are many reasons I'd like to switch from NetSol/Verisign,
but what keeps me there is the fact that, as much as their procedures
are wanting, at least I know how to work them (except when a human
has to get involved. Then it's problematic.)

Two questions:

(1) Can anyone other that NetSol do "host registrations" - ie, 
register a name server like NetSol does with the following template:
ftp://www.networksolutions.com/templates/host-template.txt

(2) Would people care to recommend a good registrar, who has a
mechanism for doing "block updates" for DNS service. In other words
a registrar that doesn't make me do N separate operations to change
the name servers on N different domains.

Try replacing require_once with include_once. Mixing them might not
work in the version you are using.

Older versions of PHP may have kept separate file lists for these two
functions. Having difficulty documenting this theory, though.

Hello Richard,

RS> I was wondering if these virii can infect a Linux based system, and how

My guess would be yes, a boot sector virus can infect a Linux based
system. This will depend on the type of virus and the type of boot
setup that a particular system is using. If you try to boot from an
infected floppy, a virus usually moves the code in partition table of
the first hard drive (or the boot sector of the active partition) to a
different location and replaces it with its own code. After that it
stays resident in memory and infects all floppies that are accesses
through the floppy drive. This part will not work in Linux because the
infection depends on intercepting the interrupt used in DOS for disk
access. Linux does not use this interrupt after the boot process is
finished, so the resident portion of the virus will not get activated.

You can get the converter at Norvac, but it's expensive--around
$50 IIRC.  You'll also need a video card that can do sync-on-green;
Matrox's can I know.  And you'll have to configure XFree to
support it.  It's doable; a friend of mine did it a few years ago,
but it's easy.

Oh yes; NetSol has also occasionally engaged in spamming--not just
bulk e-mail, but using deceptive techniques, like using a variety
of domains in the mail headers over time, so if you start filtering
for one, next week you get another from a different domain.

You don't have to do an entire low-level format; just a 'dd' into
the first few bytes of the disk to overwrite the MBR is adequate.
(In fact, you /shouldn't/ do a low-level format on IDE drives.)
While most of the older DOS/Windows-oriented ones copy themselves
into memory that Linux would just overwrite when loading, it's not
inconceivable that one for Linux /could/ be written, but I strongly
doubt it, given the myriad of kernels and memory offsets.

The SIOCADDRT is the failure to add the default route; either
because the interface hasn't been brought up yet or you've mangled
the netmask somehow.  (Or it simply isn't on your local
network.)

Are you positive that it's not a standard SVGA monitor with a 15 pin mini
d-sub adapter?  All the newish ultras we had at my last job had already
forgone the 13w3 thingies.

It's an older system (if 1998 can truly be "old"). The monitor model is 
X7121A. I'm pretty sure it's multi-sync, so I won't have to worry about sync 
on green. But I'm also pretty sure it's cable end will be a 13W3 type.

Hello list,
 
I have a POP3 email account that has a username containing + (the plus
sign).  I want to use fetch mail to retrieve email from this account,
however, fetchmail reports to me that there is an invalid character in my
username.  Does anyone know how to work around this?

Bingo! That solved the problem. Thanks very much.

Summary:

Working through the exercises in the book PHP and MySQL Web Development,
I encountered this error message:

  Fatal error: Cannot redeclare db_connect() in db_fns.php on line 3

The web application makes use of the technique of grouping like sub
routines into files and then using include, include_once, and
require_once, as the routines are needed. Most of the application uses
include and include_once. In one file, require_once is used. By changing
it to include_once, the application runs.

Subject: [PLUG] Another Red Hat Update Question
Message-ID: <gthoj6.dqu@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

When I do the "up2date" or "up2date -u" command it says it will not update 
XFree86-100dpi-fonts,  XFree86-75dpi-fonts,  and Kdebase 2.2.2, because the 
configuration is modified, and Kernel 2.4.9 because of Pkg name/Pattern.

The "up2date" command will let me force an update.  Is this safe to do?  I 
don't see what harm new fonts could do.

BTW, my dialup connection downloaded 105 MB (40 files) in 7 hours, then 90 
MB (71 files) in 5 hours, after using the "up2date -u" command.  I had to 
quit then, but this morning started again using just the "up2date" command 
which downloads fewer files.  Using "up2date -u" might be a bit too much 
for a dialup to handle.

I was doing some reading that covered the OSI model again, and remembered

Also, when using bitwise notation for a subnet mask, will the routing table 
actually accept /20, or do I have to write it out as 255.255.240.0 ?

Yes, it is quoted...

I've also upgraded to the latest version of fetchmail, and now instead of
saying that there is an invalid character, it simply reports:

fetchmail: Unknown login or authentication error on
myname+mydomain at mydomain.com

This behaviour is the same whether I specify the account in ~/.fetchmailrc

OSI was a nice theory...

Not that I know of.  TCP/IP is a 4- or 5-layer model.
Linux doesn't even pretend to use the OSI model.

Well, I've solved my immediate problem...

When I look at my mail account configuration with the ISP, it stated that my
username was myname+mydomain.com, but I opened up a trouble ticket with them
and they responded that my username should be myname at mydomain.com.

Perhaps the "+" is really an invalid character...  I don't know.

For what it's worth, it took me about 30 hours to do a full
up2date, from the Red Hat 7.2 package. This was about 2 weeks
ago. The connection was a 56k Frame Relay, which would be
a bit faster than a "56k" modem connection.

This doesn't answer your question about the fonts (I did not
update those btw, or the kernel files) but it gives you some
idea what you're in for, time wise :-)

Does Linux use TCP/IP as the model?  I mean, I am trying to get a picture of 
what happens from the Application level to Physical level in Linux.  So far, 
I have this picture:

Application level : FTP, HTTP, SMTP etc.
(I assume the session level is rolled into the application level)

Transport Layer : Port / sequence numbering (any error checking here?)
TCP UDP (any others?)

Network Layer : IP addressing 

Data LInk Layer : (this is done on the NIC?) Hardware addressing. Error 
checking (any packet sequencing at this level?)

Physical Layer : the actual transmission via Ethernet or ? electrically 

Does this look correct?
Are packets sized at the transport layer?

Thats ok, I can wait until I get the router working and try to change it then 
to see what happens.

I suffered with a 19-26000 connection for years, then last Summer the phone 
company finally installed new cable along the street.  A few months ago 
they finally hooked it up and now I get up to 53000.

It's still a slow download, but at least the "up2date" commands started to 
work yesterday like someone waved a magic wand.

Howdy,

I have a friend(?) who believes that a 'server' doesn't need X, and
therefore puts minimal vid support (low end vid card and small cheap
monitor) on them. Once they're running, the monitor is moved away...

He's asked me for help, but some of the tools I have found for
configuring want the GUI, and with no X support available ....

Any ideas? Can you get there from here?

What apps need to be configured?  Most will have a text based file that
you can edit directly if there is no utility available.  Since I'm not
sure what the server is going to be used for I can't provide details on
where these files are though.  Another option would be to use Webmin
(http://www.webmin.com).  If you could get Webmin running and the
computer networked, you could remotely configure a lot of things through
a web browser.

Of course.  The GUI's are just front ends to the real config files.  You will 
need to learn what files you need to edit (or what console program will 
assist you) for what you are trying to set up.

The flat text configuration files for one of the services are kept in a consistant location on the file system, but each server may or may not have it's own uniquely named config files mixed in with other config files that we would like to keep loosely synced up among all the servers. Plus or minus 5 minutes in the sync would be okay.
I've got several possibilities, and I was hoping for some more suggestions.
Rsync scripts customized to glue everything together.
Exporting part of the filesystem to NFS and syncing each servers local files with the NFS mount. (Not really secure).
Intermezzo file system mounting all of the config files and letting Intermezzo handle everything. (Still not really secure, but it sounds like it would be pretty much maintenance free if it doesn't corrupt)
Using a built in distro utility to automatically handle 2 way syncing (Mandrake DrakSync? Does Redhat have anything to compare?)
What would be the simple and elegant solution I am missing here?
Scenario #2 : Keeping a backup webserver with MySQL databases synced up with a production webserver.
Right now I'm thinking we could just script the production web server to shutdown the databases at midnight and rsync everything over. I'm not a database guy, so how would we do it for a live MySQL database to keep the backup server closer than 24 hours behind? Anybody know of any good tutorials on this type of setup?
Thanks!

I had a redhat7.2 system behind a firewall with only ports 80, 20, 21,
22 open on Wednesday, running fine. Today, there are only 8MB of files
left on the 9GB system. A df last week showed about 30% used. The
journal files are still there, but not much else. fsck shows clean.

How can this be?

For scenario 1, I use rsync over ssh.

For scenario 2, it seems that more frequent synchronization
would require the cooperation of your application program(s).
I have the same need and I intend on implementing
transaction files at each site for times when the sites can't
communicate with one another. Periodically, a housekeeping
program will sync both sites to one another - again over a
SSH link. Note that this synchronization is syncing database
tables (records) - not syncing database files. If there's a better
way, I'd like to hear it.

I would agree with your friend.

Here is where ssh is very helpful.  You can install the gui application, it 
might require the xserver software.  Install what the application wants, but 
don't start the xserver.

Use ssh to export the display to a workstation running x and run your gui 
there.

Why MS2k requires a gui (and games) installed on a server is beyond me.

This is what cfengine is expressly designed to do:

  http://www.iu.hio.no/cfengine/

It lets you define classes of machines (based on all sorts of criteria:
hostname, subnet, OS, etc), and the configuration files are synced
and/or edited in place according to class-based rules.

cfengine builds cleanly on every modern Unix I've ever encountered.

Thanks, John, for the suggestions..

I tried what you suggested but it was a no-go.

I actually tried getting laser2.html to load directly since
it is one of the apps my daughter wants to use.  My ultimate plan
was to simply edit out all the text so that the applet
and a title would  show up.

So I made the path changes you mentioned there except the .class
file was MicroLaser.class instead of LaserApplet.class.

First I got an error saying that the applet couldn't find some
others items.  So I downloaded everything in applets/laser.

Then I got another error about not being able to find something
in applets/physics2000 called `P2Applet.class'.

I did a `strings' on the applets/laser/Microlaser.class and found
references to physics2000/P2Canvas.class as well.  So I brought down
the whole applets/physics2000 directory.  Also brought down
applets/controls for the same reason.  There seem to be a lot of
directories in applets/.  But I can't see them from my browser, of
course.

Anyway, now I get the following error:

Applet laser.Microlaser can't start: ERROR

It's clearly _starting_ since if I move the applets/physics2000 directory
out of the way I get the former message about P2Applet.class not being
found.

I also tried editing lasers/index.html as you suggested
and _that_ applet runs.  But the ones in laser[2,3,4].html don't,
unfortunately.

I've been at this for more than three hours.  Time to go to bed
(very frustrated).

Anything else I should try?
This site seems to have a lot of intertwined directories
with lots of chained cross references within the java.

And for some reason, `wget' on applets/ won't bring down much.

Question: what does apache have to do with this?  Can't
I just use netscape directly on the filesystem?

Regards, and good night.
Dean

I think you're thinking of it the wrong way; Linux doesn't "use"
TCP/IP as a model; Linux has a TCP/IP "stack" (the term "stack"
in this case refers to the layered model), but could implement
just about any networking model.  And this is the case: there are
a number of non-TCP/IP networking stacks, such as IPX/SPX, AX.25,
AppleTalk, etc.  (It's interesting that some of the application-layer
portions of some of these protocols have been adapted to work over
TCP/IP; for example, Novell has moved away from IPX/SPX and does the
NCP (NetWare Core Protocols) over TCP/IP; AppleTalk's AFP and PAP
(AppleTalk File Protocol and Printer Access Protocol [I might be
improvising here ;)]); IBM/Microsoft SMB originally ran over NetBEUI,
but most of the Windows SMB implementations are actively used over
TCP/IP (esp. since Samba and other non-Windows SMB implementations
rarely have a NetBEUI stack at their disposal).

But the OSI "model" is basically just that--a way of abstractly
thinking about the way things work together.  Some of these protocol
stacks don't cleanly separate all the various layers (for example,
I *think* AX.25 incorporates routing at basically the layer 2--the
link layer, if I'm not misunderstanding).  But aside from the OSI
"model", there's also the OSI networking stack, which is similiar
to but considerably different from TCP/IP.  Some OSI protocols
have influenced or are used by some IETF protocols; for example,
a lot of LDAP is derived from the X.500 protocol.

Layer 2 is often divided into two sub-layers; the data link
and the medium access.

What do you mean by "sized"?  Every layer adds a protocol
header, which increases the size of the packet.

It depends on which tool is being used; I think 'ifconfig' won't,
but 'ip' (iproute2) will.

I meant to add that if you want a good book about networking to
read Andrew "Linux is obsolete" Tanenbaum's "Computer Networks",
3rd ed.  It does a very good job of comparing the various problems
and protocols at each layer and the 3rd edition uses ATM & TCP/IP
for many of its examples.

Take a look here to read about replication of mysql databases.  Maybe it
will give you guys some additional ideas.

Thanks for the clarification Wil.  Somehow I knew there would not be a simple 
one size fits all answer.  But with the above in mind, I think I 'get' it 
now, and understand that most of what I will be working with will be the 
TCP/IP model.

<snip>

This may be another area where my thinking is fuzzy.  As I see it, an 
ethernet packet is about 1500 bytes, so the application data has to be sized 
into a packet which is small enough to allow the addition of addresses at 
other layers, and still be under 1500 bytes.  I always envisioned data 
streaming from the application to the Transport Layer (?) where it got 
chopped up (sized) into packets.  Perhaps you can help clear up that picture 
for me.  Is there a size limit, and what determines the size of a packet?
There is lots of info in these books about exactly how many bytes are in the 
parts of the header, but it does not mention where or how the application 
data is packaged.  I only guessed the Transport Layer because the OSI Model 
mentions 'sequencing' the packets there, so I figured that had to be the 
disassembly/reassembly area.

Message-ID: <20020325024524.55895.qmail@web9608.mail.yahoo.com>

I have support from Mandrake for 60 days, but I
thought I'd also submit the incident to this list for
possible insight:

My newly-installed Mandrake system boots Windows. It
also boots itself from a floppy (which drive isn't
usually connected). It doesn't boot from the "linux"
option on the boot menu:

Mounting root filesystem
VFS: Can't find ext3 filesystem on dev id0(3,3)
mount: error 22 mounting ext3 flags Freeing unused
kernel memory: 712K freed
Kernel panic: No init found. Try passing init = option
to kernel.
(Hangs at that point)

Can I get into the installation on /dev/hda3 in
"rescue" mode and change something? Or will I have to
wire my floppy drive externally so I can boot into
Mandrake from it every time? Root mount point is high
on 60 GB disk, above 4000 cylinders.

That's the beautiful thing about libraries.  (Sorry, I married a
librarian, so I am morally obligated to point out where they can be
useful).

their online catalog) Portland State Library does:

Hm, I suspect based on the 1981 date and the fact that no edition
is listed, that this is the 1st edition.  The 1st & 2nd editions
don't cover TCP/IP and ATM as the 3rd does; the 3rd is pretty much
a re-write and considerably more up-to-date.

Good point.  I'll take another 30 seconds and look somewhere slightly
more likely, OGI:

  Tanenbaum, Andrew S., 1944-
    Title Computer networks / Andrew S. Tanenbaum.
    Imprint Upper Saddle River, N.J. : Prentice Hall PTR, c1996.
    LOCATION     CALL #                STATUS
    OGI LIBRARY  TK5105.5 .T36 1996    AVAILABLE
    Edition 3rd ed.
    Descript xvii, 813 p. : ill., maps ; 24 cm.
    Bibliog. Includes bibliographical references (p. 767-794) and index.
    LC SUBJECT Computer networks.
    ISBN 0133499456

The only problem with these academic institutions' libraries is that
you probably don't have borrowing privileges unless you either attend
them or another one with cooperative agreements.  However, I've never
been to one that doesn't allow the public to come in and read, and
after all, you aren't paying anything.

Do these tools support the X option ``-display"? If so, set the display
for a computer running X, & continue on without a hitch.

(The reason for my waffling is that I'm surprised that Gtk+ *DOESN'T*
suport many reference X switches, & so I'm not as quick to claim how
you can solve the problem in a couple of easy steps. The tools you are
talking about, Bruce, may use the Gtk+ libraries. I'm getting to
the point where I want to rant about b0rken-as-designed features in
Gtk+.)

Yup, there are two complete bootable kernels. It's a nice deal, in case
there's something broken/inop with the first, just boot to the other. Nice
option in my book.

It seems to me that it would be the opposite. The more services one runs,
the less likely that it's secure.

I've got X on all my servers, but that's so I can configure them and turn X
back off. I take that back, I've got a FREESCO firewall that doesn't have a
GUI on the floppy :-)

I've noticed during the Red Hat install that it is not only able to
determine files needed to satisfy an rpm but the rpm that has to be
installed as well.  Is there a way to get this functionality after the
install?  I've heard a number of people have problems satisfying
dependencies with rpm which is supposed to reduce the dependency problem.
It would sure be nice if the rpm package manager forced package builders to
sign their packages.  In reality I think google offers more help when it
comes to upgrading software than rpm.

It's annoying when a rpm -verify on a freshly installed Redhat system
generates a whole bunch of md5, time, and other failures leaving no way to
know for sure later if something really has happened to important files
aside from installing and using tripwire.

RPM is a fine idea, but if it isn't implemented well ( developers taking a
hammer to the database before packages such as bastille can be installed )
there's far less of an advantage over just using tarballs.

Is there a way to find out if an rpm will replace files as upgrading will,
albeit not always, break programs?  If rpm wants to replace files what
tricks are available to get both the old and new files installed, e.g. the
gcc libraries?

What does rpm --rebuilddb do to rebuild the package database?

My thought is that an unsigned package should be treated like a corrupt
package.  Why are so many packages unsigned?

Can tarballs be turned into rpms and those rpms then be used to replace some
of the packages in a distribution tree like Redhat or Mandrake?  For reasons
unclear to me programs that should be chroot such as ftp, bind, apache, etc.
often come otherwise in standard distribution packages.  Why don't
distributors want to compile programs chroot?

It depends on what you mean by "having X on a system".  There's
nothing really insecure about having the X binaries and whatnot
installed; the only thing SUID root is Xwrapper, and that's small
and well-audited.  Having an X server/XFS font server, etc up
and running is another matter.  The whole of X is far too big
of a thing to be audited; it's likely rife with buffer overflows
and protocol errors that who-knows-what could go wrong with it.
But that's just the X servers--since X is a client/server system,
you can run the clients on your (non-X) server and have them display
remotely on a management workstation or laptop with little or no
danger to the server.  That is, if you aren't sending passwords
back and forth (like running an xterm and su'ing to root) and you
aren't using some form of encryption like IPSec or an SSH tunnel.

So in sort, it's both right and wrong ;)

Well, there's no TCP/IP model, per se... that is, I don't think anyone's
abstracted the way TCP/IP works into a generally useful schema.  Rather,
TCP/IP is a single implementation and the various layers are analogous to
all or part of one or more layers in the abstract OSI model.

At my old job, there was some equipment which communicated via ethernet
and the technicians refered to it as "OSI seven layer" and lamented the
pending conversion to TCP... can someone enlighten me as to the likely
protocols used in this equipment (mostly fiber muxes)?

Nope.  It's more cumbersome than that, to my understanding. (correct away,
network gurus)

TCP encapsulates data into packets with headers and footers with checksums
and packet ordering info and all that THEN IP routing information is
added.

These packets are then encapsulated again as separate data streams in the
ethernet.  An ethernet packet can contain all or part of a TCP packet.  
The IP portion of the packet is analyzed and the IP address is correlated
to a MAC address via routing rules and arp.  The TCP packets are then
broken into ethernet packets and each of those is addressed with the
appropriate MAC.

ATM has a fixed cell size, so if your TCP packets are smaller than or not
evenly divisible by the payload size of your cells, then you end up with
padded cells (don't we all?) carrying data at a less than optimal rate.

The layers don't really care much about each other's packetization...
optimal packet size differs not just for transport layers, but for
applications.

All kinds of things.  Hell, I can make a HUGE UDP packet, if I'd
like... but it's not going to make any bigger ethernet packets than
anything else.

Check the three volumes (!!!) of TCP/IP Illustrated by Richard Stevens.

Well, in TCP/IP over Ethernet, that is what TCP does.

My guess is they don't talk about sequencing at the lower layers because
those rely on actual chronological sequencing of data, whereas the
transport layer can receive packets in any order.

I'm really sleepy, so confirmation and confutation are welcome.

With Red Hat's own packages, you can install 'rpmdb-redhat' and use
the '--redhatrequires' and '--redhatprovides' query flags to find out
which packages will provide which files or require which packages.
Otherwise, no; because there are half a dozen distributions using RPM
and each making it's own packages, which aren't always compatible.

Tripwire is really the right way to do this; 'rpm -V' only records
file attributes at installation.  My 'rpm -V' is usually pretty
comprehensible; the md5, size, time only change on files in /etc.
But Tripwire is really the right tool for this job (yeah, I know
it can be a PITA to get running).

You can find out which files the rpm contains with 'rpm -qlp
example.rpm'.  Some packages are designed so you can install multiple
versions, like the kernel packages.  None of the kernel files are
the same, so it's not a problem.  It's a problem when two packages
want to install /usr/bin/foo; there's no way to do it cleanly.
For GCC parts, you can often just install multiple together.
But do to that you have to install (-i) not upgrade (-U).

Because people don't use crypto?  All of Red Hat's packages
are signed; if you're not getting an gpg on 'rpm -K' then
you've not got the key in your keyring.

It's a lot of work to make sure the chroot'd stuff works properly.
It'll break lots of people's assumptions about where things will be
and how they'll work, so it'll break admin tools, homebrew scripts,
operator instructions, etc.  But I agree; I wish more stuff came
chroot by default.

What services require X for configuration?

I can't imagine why one would bother installing X on a system that isn't
used for multitasking at the console (unless, I guess, its singular task
at the console is web-surfing... but I think it's only a matter of time
before someone writes a framebuffer console graphical web browser).

I have never had much luck with Libraries, partly because I read slow, so I 
have to check out the book, and hope I finish it.  Then it is not there when 
I actually need to find out what I am doing wrong (bad memory goes with the 
age).  Usually the local libraries have a really poor selection, and those 
that do have what you are looking for have a waiting list to get it.  And so 
on.  
I am willing to buy the books as I am able.  In fact I ordered one last week 
(should arrive next week), and it may answer all of my questions.  It is 
called "LINIX TCP/IP Network Administration" by Scott Mann (of SGI), pub by 
Prentice Hall.  I like to have the dead tree to drag around with me, as I get 
time an hour here and there, but never seem to find time to just sit down and 
read for any length of time.

Here's the choice confronted by the packager: When faced with a file
that's likely to change (e.g., a config file like /etc/ntp.conf), do I
include it as an official package file or do I create it with, say, a
post-installation script.

If I include it as an official package file, it's easier to keep track
of it when the user upgrades or removes the package in question -- but
it's likely to generate those annoying md5 errors you mention.

If I create it with a post-installation script, it won't show up as an
error when verifying the rpm database, but it's much harder handle when
upgrading or removing a package.

In an ideal world, packages wouldn't activate themselves by default.
They'd include a sample config file or whatever in /usr/share/doc, and
it'd be up to the local admin to move it into place and start the
application.

But that's way too much work, even for someone like me who administers
systems professionally. It's nice to rely on the distribution to do
*some* things for you behind the scenes.

Implementation is always the trick, isn't it?

I've built hundreds of rpms in the past couple years. Some give me pride
in my work -- and some leave me open-mouthed at my own incompetence.
Sometimes, applications lend themselves to packaging (e.g., the various
GNU *utils packages, which don't rely much on variable files), and
sometimes they don't (e.g., any RDBMS you can imagine).

It always comes down to the details. Always.

Sometimes, albeit rarely, you can 'rpm -i' an rpm and get it to install
itself alongside an existing package. The kernel-* packages are usually
pretty good at this.

Otherwise, you can always use rpm2cpio to extract the files from a
package and install them in a place of your choosing.

I build plenty of rpms for use at work and at home. I'd resent software
demanding that I sign the packages that I produce.

Not that easily. The only way to turn anything into an rpm is to create
a .spec file. I've created .spec files that do nothing but install a
tarball -- but I still needed a tarball.

That said, it'd be an interesting exercise to write a shell or perl
script that'd turn a tarball or directory tree into an rpm. Assuming the
file layout in the tarball or directory were sane in the first place, it
wouldn't be that hard. Hmm. I might have to devote some time to that :-)

Bruce, you might want to try running the VNC server, if it's installed. You
can then fire up your VNC client, connect to the server and run the GUI
remotely. It's kinda like X in reverse. Really handy for those MacroHard
machine that have no X server software on them.

I think the caveat is that your servers ought to have X and every utility
you can put on it. Then pare stuff off once you deem it unnecessary.

I'd like to know more about how to do this.  It's probably obvious to many
people how to run X apps off a remote machine through ssh, but it's not
clear to me.  Does anyone have a link to something that explains this?

Subject: [PLUG] Two Red Hat 7.2 Kernels on One Computer???

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20020325094334.00b429f0@127.0.0.1>

This is by design, and desirable.

Whenever you update your kernel, you should leave your existing (and 
hopefully, fully functional) kernel installed and working. This allows you 
to boot to your old kernel, should something be messed up with the new 
kernel. I've run into new kernels that didn't work, for one reason or another.

As a side note, if you choose to download and manually install the kernel 
rpm, make sure you do a -i (install) rather than a -U (upgrade) with rpm. 
The former will leave your existing kernel, the later removes the existing 
kernel. If the old kernel is gone, you have no safety net.

I've also seen the scripts in kernel rpms leave the existing kernel as the 
default. What this means is that you need to go into /etc/grub.conf or 
/etc/lilo.conf (depending on your boot loader) and manually make the new 
kernel the default. I find this to be a good safety mechanism as well.

Multiple people, logging into X, over the network. Either directly, or via 
an ssh tunnel.

People like looking at pretty windows instead of a plain text screen.

I know of several large shops that do this all the time.

Sounds like your referring to CS, which stands for Cable Select, a pathetic
attempt at making it so that drives don't have to be selected as master or
slave.  You are always much better off selecting the correct jumper setting and
not using the CS setting.

Hope that clears it up a little.

I'd like to know more about how to do this.  It's probably obvious to many
people how to run X apps off a remote machine through ssh, but it's not
clear to me.  Does anyone have a link to something that explains this?

I can give you a real quick run-through.

>From the command prompt on my PC, I do:

ssh -f server xhost -ls

It asks for my key and then up pops the Xterm in my local X server.

That's it, in essence.

Now, behind the scenes several things have happened. Firstly, my local
machine's ssh_config file has "ForwardX11 yes" in it. That just makes it so
I don't have to explicitly tell the ssh command to forward the X11
connections.

Also, I have already added my public key from the local machine to my
~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the server machine.

What I generally would do next is the following:

exec ssh-agent bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_dsa
startx


Now all my X traffic is running over the initial ssh command. And all my
keys are available to all the subprocesses in my X session.

I'm sure I'm being dumb here, but does that mean that if I am at my local
machine and I type in an xterm:
ssh -X somemachine.somedomain.com netconfig

I will be able to configure networking on the remote maching, not the local?

If netconfig is an X app, yes. Otherwise you'll have to run it in an xterm.

One thing you'll notice when you forward your X connections is the change of
the DISPLAY variable. You local machine's session will have DISPLAY=:0 or
DISPLAY=machine:0 or something like that. Before the days of SSH, you'd have
to set DISPLAY to the correct value so the client would know where to spray
it's output. Another scenario:

$ echo $DISPLAY
mymachine:0.0
$ telnet remotemachine
Login: me
Password:
Welcome to remotemachine
remote$ echo $DISPLAY

remote$ export DISPLAY=mymachine:0
remote$ xterm &

(xterm displays locally)

But with SSH, here's what happens:

$ echo $DISPLAY
mymachine:0.0
$ ssh remotemachine
Enter passphrase for key '/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa':
remote$ echo $DISPLAY
remote:10.0

All your clients will get their traffic "forced" through this display, in
order to get through the tunnel to your local machine's X server.

You can do it either of two ways.

If you've already got your xterm running, just ssh to the remote system and
run the app there. This is assuming the app you'll be running is command
line.

If the app you wanna run is an X app, then just give it this:

ssh -f somemachine theAppToRun

You'll get the app on your screen through the ssh tunnel. Using the -f will
just fork it to the background, once it is authorized.

Correct. You will be running netconfig on that remote machine - meaning
that you'll be configuring networking on that machine - while netconfig's
networked GUI is carried through an SSH tunnel to your local machine.
That's the joy of a networked GUI like X: the application interacts
with the display and input devices through a network connection, not by
directly diddling with hardware.

One funny thing about this specific example: reconfiguring networking
while you're connected to it may lead to surprises - like the GUI and/or
ssh connection disappearing when you make a network configuration change.

Thank you!  I think I finally get it!  So it seems that a person could use
all the GUI tools they want to configure a server that doesn't even have a
monitor attached or is in a remote location.

painfully slow even over a high speed internet connection.  It is best used

Correct. You will be running netconfig on that remote machine - meaning that
you'll be configuring networking on that machine - while netconfig's
networked GUI is carried through an SSH tunnel to your local machine. That's
the joy of a networked GUI like X: the application interacts with the
display and input devices through a network connection, not by directly
diddling with hardware.

One funny thing about this specific example: reconfiguring networking while
you're connected to it may lead to surprises - like the GUI and/or ssh
connection disappearing when you make a network configuration change.

Oh, I don't know.  I've run X apps over my DSL connection from
the outside, which means I was getting 256kbps for the display.
It's sluggish, but usable.  Considerably better over my 2Mb wireless
connection.

It's even worse than that if you need initial ramdisk to boot. mkinitrd uses
loopback device, so it must load loop.o module for the currently running kernel.
If you replaced old kernel with the new one, the old modules directory is gone,
modules from the new one won't load, so you now have one deleted kernel and one
not installed kernel.

rpm -i will add new kernel to GRUB for you.

I run TightVNC server on my Solaris box at home and connect to it (via a
ssh gateway) from work, but it's not too slow, even considering the
128Kbps rate limit on my cable-modem connection.

If you're connected directly with ssh, then the -C option is definitely
your friend.

 In the Debian system, if two packages want to install the same
 program, eg "vim" and "nvi" both provide a "vi", each package
 installs a binary with a unique name, and then the
 "update-alternatives" command is used from the postinst to provide a
 symlink named "vi".

That still doesn't solve the problem of installing two
different versions of the same program.

Or "ForwardX11 yes" in your ssh configuration (either
/etc/ssh/ssh_config or ~/.ssh/config).  "man ssh" for details.

This won't _always_ work, of course, e.g. if the remote host's sshd is
configured to not do X11Forwarding or if things like xauth aren't
available.

I'm downloading the 8.2 ISO images now and will try the same thing to my 8.1

OK, I have a possible solution to this.

It seems that the 900 mhz Ultra Sparc III processors require Solaris 8 with 
a release date of 10/01 or newer. The latest I currently have is 7/01, and 
2/02 won't download properly for me.

Looks like someone put the wrong OS image on these machines.

What happens when Time-Warner-AOL decides, for obvious reasons, to adopt
the AOL email system for internal use?

Hilarious (but not surprising) things: lost mail, unreliable mail clients
and servers, disappearance of large attachments, legitimate users being
labeled as spammers and locked out, incompatibility with wireless devices,
and much more. According to this article:

    http://www.msnbc.com/news/727898.asp

Time-Warner-AOL's top-level directive to use AOL's mail system was such
a disaster that many employees have moved substantially to pre-internet
practices: FAXes, phone, FedEx, and (gasp!) walking down the hall.

Good question. In the MBR. "LILO with graphical
interface." (This was the starred option, so I didn't
quarrel with them.) After Windows.

Mandrake support told me to get a boot prompt and type


linux root=/dev/hda3

This is ignored, for some reason (by Linux, not by
me).

BTW, I'm going to try to install a floppy drive
tomorrow. I have a Pavilion 7950 with one of those
awful floppy drives that is open in front, and it
doesn't seem to be grabbing the disks. I'm going to
bolt another floppy drive to the outside of the case,
with a slot in the case for the cables to pass through
to the drive. Then I can boot Linux from a floppy, if
necessary, but it should be possible to boot from the
HDD.

WinSCP does support both SSH1 and SSH2, it defaults to version 1, but that can be changed, so far it seems to be working very well.

Here's hoping it stays that way

The Redhat "7.3" beta (skipjack) does this too.

 From the release notes:
http://ftp.sunet.se/pub/os/Linux/distributions/redhat/redhat/linux/beta/skipjack/en/os/i386/RELEASE-NOTES
"Red  Hat  Linux  now  includes  a  port of the Debian alternatives
system,  as  a  way  to  support  multiple  packages  providing a
particular  service.  Every  binary/file  that  would be in common 
between  the multiple packages is replaced with a symlink to /etc;
this then resolves to the version of that file for the alternative
in question. For example:
/usr/sbin/sendmail        -> /etc/alternatives/mta       ->
/usr/sbin/sendmail.sendmail
These  symlinks  are  added and managed by /usr/sbin/alternatives.
See man 8 alternatives for more details
Currently,  Red  Hat Linux offers Sendmail and Postfix as two Mail
Transport Agent (MTA) alternatives. For print daemon alternatives,
the choices are LPRng and CUPS.
The  configurations for LPRng and CUPS are completely separate. If
you  switch  from one printing system to another, you will have to
reconfigure your printers."

Sure it does.  You can have /usr/bin/perl5 and /usr/bin/perl4 and
/usr/bin/perl5.6 and 
/usr/bin/perl->/etc/alternatives/perl->/usr/bin/perl5.6.

Do you  have two sets of modules too?

Subject: [PLUG] Help: 1. Foomatic
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0203251644560.1956-100000@shaft.bitmine.net>

I ended up administering a box for a friend's mother.  Long story.  I
don't really mind doing it, but I'm having a couple of problems.

First, I can't seem to print PDFs with lp.  I'm using LPRng and foomatic.

`lp file.pdf` puts the file in the queue and nothing ever happens.  I look
at /var/spool/lpd/<printername>/status.pr and it appears as though the
print job has run fine, but nothing shows up at the printer.  I can't seem
to find anything in the logs that indicate something has happened other
than successful printing.  It even appears to do the postscript
conversion.

`pdf2ps file.pdf - | lp` works fine.


Any help would be appreciated.  The following is the status.pr for a
single print of the Acrobat license PDF from the command line:

Yes. The kernel RPM installs a set of modules for the kernel your installing.

Administering someone else's system, need a hand.

My friend's mother really wants (perhaps needs?) WordPerfect on this
Woody box.

She ordered this WordPerfect 8 disk from LinuxCentral and it's arrived and
I tried installing it.  The thing seems to have been built for Linux
2.0.1x, libc5 and X11R5.  Needless to say, it segfaults when I start it
(after modifying LD_LIBRARY_PATH so it finds the X libs).

Does anyone know how to get this working on a modern system?

Thanks.

The Redhat "7.3" beta (skipjack) does this too.

 From the release notes:
http://ftp.sunet.se/pub/os/Linux/distributions/redhat/redhat/linux/beta/
skipjack/en/os/i386/RELEASE-NOTES
"Red  Hat  Linux  now  includes  a  port of the Debian alternatives
system,  as  a  way  to  support  multiple  packages  providing a
particular  service.  Every  binary/file  that  would be in common 
between  the multiple packages is replaced with a symlink to /etc;
this then resolves to the version of that file for the alternative
in question. For example:
/usr/sbin/sendmail        -> /etc/alternatives/mta       ->
/usr/sbin/sendmail.sendmail
These  symlinks  are  added and managed by /usr/sbin/alternatives.
See man 8 alternatives for more details
Currently,  Red  Hat Linux offers Sendmail and Postfix as two Mail
Transport Agent (MTA) alternatives. For print daemon alternatives,
the choices are LPRng and CUPS.
The  configurations for LPRng and CUPS are completely separate. If
you  switch  from one printing system to another, you will have to
reconfigure your printers."

I'd guess your address was scraped off of some website hosting a mailing

Paul, IIRC your systems tend to be Red Hat based. If so, then you'll
want to check out /etc/sysconfig/harddisks, as it's a config file for
hdparm arguments. Thus your settings won't get blown away the next time
your initscripts package gets updated.

I've had some experience with this. A bootblock virus overwrites the
bootloader (lilo or, presumably, grub) with something that looks like a
normal DOS boot sector. This means that a system that formerly was dual
boot will suddenly start booting directly into Windows. In that case the
best solution would be to boot from floppy and re-install lilo.

In my experience, installing Linux will overwrite the virus. However, if
you have DOS/Windows systems you think might be infected you need to boot
them with a clean, write-protected floppy and run "fdisk /mbr".

If <linux root = /dev/hda3> did not find the boot info, I suspect it may not 
be at that location.  My first question would be, did you create a separate 
/boot partition.  If you did, you need to point LILO/GRUB there.  When you 
get into Linux, try the df command to show your partitions and where they are 
mounted.  That will allow you to verify where Linux /boot really is.  Unless 
you put it in a separate partition, it should be in root (/).

Once you know where on the drive to boot linux, you can examine your 
bootloaders to see if they are pointing to the right place.

I am dual booting Mandrake 8.1 on my laptop, so I will add my lilo and grub 
configurations below for you to look at.  Before you edit, be sure to make a 
backup copy or just # the sections you edit and add notes so you can put it 
back together if you need to.

If it is LILO, then look at, and edit if necessary /etc/lilo.conf  This is 
what mine looks like for the Linux image:

Image=/boot/vmlinuz
	label=linux
	root=/dev/hda5    #your location is probably different
	initrd=/boot/initrd.img
	append=" devfs=mount"
	read-only

If you edit lilo, be sure to run the lilo command again.


If you are using GRUB (I thought it was the Mandrake default?)  Then you can 
look at /boot/grub/menu.lst  mine looks like this:

title linux
kernel (hd0, 4)/boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/hda5 devfs=mount
initrd (hd0, 4)/boot/initrd.img

I am not too familiar with editing GRUB, but I do know the info you need to 
work with GRUB is located by typing "info grub"  no quotes of course.
I am not sure, but I don't think you need to do anything more before you boot 
from it, like you do with lilo. [someone will correct me if I am wrong]

I hope that will help narrow down the problem.

Yes. You need the "compatibility libraries" for glibc.

Also, some filters will not work due to an expired filter program. There is a 
way around this, but I do not have it at hand.  (It was mentioned in a forum 
i was reading a while back. it involves creating a wrapper script that fools 
the filter into believing it is a different date.)

I have also seen it conflict with versions of Wine, but I am not certain why. 
 (I have not spent the time to debug it.)  it seemed to work OK under Redhat 
7.2, but it has been a while since I needed it.

I've got WP 8 running on a Red Hat 7.1 box. I installed an old
libc-5.blah rpm that put all sorts of old libraries -- libc, X stuff,
curses and termcap, etc -- into an out-of-the-way directory that gets
added to /etc/ld.so.conf.

I'd be happy to make a tarball of all it for you and put in somewhere
you can get at it. It seems to do the trick for me.

Actually, I've installed libc5 (Debian has packages for oldlibs, too), but
all I did for the X11 stuff was set LD_LIBRARY_PATH (for some reason it
can't find libXt.so without it).  `ldd /opt/WordPerfect/wpbin/wp8` (I
think that's the name of the binary, I don't have that console open at the

However, running the binary gives me an immediate segmentation fault.

Could that be because the thing was compiled for a wholly different
kernel?

I run into disk issues fairly frequently and had never before really
considered tuning the darned thing.

However, I don't have an hdparm and I certainly don't have any init
scripts to run it.

While it's probably trivial to find the source for hdparm, would someone
be willing to show me their init script that sets things properly?  I
could write a quick and dirty one, but I'd like to see one with safety
checks and things that I wouldn't know about.

Hi Dirk,

Afraid I can't help much with that question.  I don't have a cd burner.
Burned mine on my son's Win2K machine.
Let me know how it works out.

Cable Selection, On the Dimension 4100 (and almost all the other 
Dimension-line systems) is the reccomended method by Dell.  It is also 
supported by the drives, cables, and IDE controllers.  The drives, 
configured as they ship from the factory, are not an issue.  Though you 
can switch to the master/slave setup, and it's reccomended if you add 
any third-party hardware to your system, or plan on moving drives around.

So they sorted their addresses into alphabetical order.

Except for the extremely rare application that directly makes kernel
calls, an app is never compiled "for a kernel" - it's compiled for
the ABIs and calling conventions of the libraries it uses. I *think*
that only the C library should be tightly bound to the kernel. It makes
me wonder whether the libraries installed by Debian's oldlibs package
properly recreate the ABIs and calling conventions of that bygone era
while working with a modern kernel.

Make sure you have libc5, xlib6 and xpm4.7 installed.

Making the assumption that you don't have scsi cdrom/cdrw drives, you have to 
compile scsi emulation into your kernel.  This will solve some problems with 
ide cdroms (I don't remember which off the top of my head) however 
afterwards, your cdroms will show up as ide and scsi devices.

Also
root at einstein:~# which cdrecord
/usr/bin/cdrecord
root at einstein:~# cdrecord -version
Cdrecord 1.10 (i686-pc-linux-gnu) Copyright (C) 1995-2001 J?rg Schilling

is a more accurate description of what's installed.  /usr/share/doc is the 
documentation folder and shows that the applicaition was installed at one 
time.

Hope this helps

I think that the module you want is ide-scsi.  This is a module that makes
ide cdroms look like scsi to the system.  The CD burning software expect the
CD burner to be scsi.  Try insmod ide-scsi or modprobe ide-scsi.  Here is
the CD burning howto:

I've been getting spam from these guys pretty regularly to my spamtrap
account - it may have started once I registered a domain with Network
Solutions using that address as my point of contact.

It may be mostly a result of one lowlife spammer - a guy in Vancouver or
maybe Beaverton by the name of Jack Vaughn, aka inetdevco at home.com,
registrant of oregonautomarket.com, gage-auto.com, autoplacenorthwest.com,
auto-warehouse.com, and crownmotor.com.

Oh, looks like he also involved with dickhannahpre-owned.com. And also
coliseumusedcars.com.

A google search turns up http://home.earthlink.net/~inetdevco/, which
looks to contain his digital pics of the lemons he's pushing.

The latest spam I got from them was relayed through an open relay at
some school in Korea (210.178.115.179), and is spamvertising a website

 My advice is to consider "vi" as a fallback - one that's probably on
 every Unix machine, and consider the emacsen as the editor to really
 get to know well for everyday use.

 I use XEmacs, but have heard that the latest GNU Emacs is much
 improved over the version I last used.

 No matter which one you choose, the emacs editors are by far the most
 powerful and most extensible of all.

Subject: [PLUG] Apache configuration
Message-ID: <3CA0B935.C1BE9E68@attbi.com>

Looking at the PHP info page, I discovered an incorrect situation on my
in-house apache server. HTTP_HOST and SERVER_ADDR are correctly listed
as 192.168.0.254, but SERVER_NAME is listed as 192.168.0.2. When I first
set up my network, 192.168.0.2 was the address of the machine with the
apache server as supplied by DHCP from my router. I changed it to
192.168.0.254 after reconfiguring the server to not use DHCP.

Question:

Is /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf the only place I need to change to fix
this? I ran:

grep "192.168." httpd.conf

and got:

ServerName 192.168.0.2

I assume changing ServerName to 192.168.0.254 and running
/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd -stop followed by /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd -start
will fix the problem.

Did I miss anything?

I downloaded and burned these .iso's with EasyCD
Creator, a Windows program. What's your address?

Anyhow, cdrecord works with my CD-RW under Linux. I
think if it has the appropriate arguments, you can put
the downloaded files just about anywhere. I would hope
the same would be true of a graphical client.

Perhaps some of our Washington state list members might start charging
this guy under Washington's anti-spam laws...

I am trying to recompile my kernel in hopes of getting IEEE1394
support.  So, I grabbed the rpms for the kernel-source and
kernel-headers for 2.4.18-0.8 but when I run the rpm for the headers I
get the following error:

"error: unpacking of archive failed on file /usr/include/asm: cpio:
rename failed - Is a directory"

How do I get around this error?

That's a strange conflict. What distro? What RPMs do you currently have
installed that have "kernel" in the name, what are the new RPMs you're
trying to install, and where did you get them?

Sounds like either the archive is corrupt, of you already have
/usr/include/asm and it's not what it expects (directory when a link is
expected or something like that). Move it aside and see if it installs.

Subject: [PLUG] interrupt dropped errors?
Message-ID: <1017173471.8676.16.camel@laptop>

Google sure isn't turning up much detailed information about this so I
thought I'd see if anyone else here has seen this error before. 

I'm getting a lot of this in /var/log/messages

Mar 26 11:37:52 laptop kernel: eth0: interrupt(s) dropped!
Mar 26 11:49:14 laptop kernel: eth0: interrupt(s) dropped!
Mar 26 11:52:47 laptop kernel: eth0: interrupt(s) dropped!
Mar 26 11:55:22 laptop kernel: eth0: interrupt(s) dropped!


it's a 3Com 572/574 Fast Ethernet card using the 3c574_cs.o driver

the man page says this which makes sense:

eth#: interrupt(s) dropped!
Indicates that the driver did not receive an interrupt notification for
some reason. The driver will poll the card (with a significant
performance penalty) if the problem persists. The most likely cause is
an interrupt conflict and/or host bridge configuration problem.

because the source code says this
(/usr/src/linux/drivers/net/pcmcia/3c574_cs.c)

<snip>
    /* Check for pending interrupt with expired latency timer: with
       this, we can limp along even if the interrupt is blocked */
    if ((inw(ioaddr + EL3_STATUS) & IntLatch) &&
                (inb(ioaddr + Timer) == 0xff)) {
                if (!lp->fast_poll)
                        printk(KERN_INFO "%s: interrupt(s) dropped!\n",
dev->name);
                el3_interrupt(dev->irq, lp, NULL);
                lp->fast_poll = HZ;
    }
</snip>


And I've tried multiple interrupts by manipulating
/etc/pcmcia/config.opts
Making sure that the irq's used do not conflict with anything in
/proc/interrupts

Yet I still see this problem. Anyone have any idea what might be going
on here?

Thanks,
A-

That's right. XCDRoast is a little strange in that you have to set up a
specific directory in its configuration in order for it to find
anything. Other GUI tools are much more flexible in this regard.

Subject: [PLUG] Router Plus Questions
Message-ID: <E16py7K-00026Q-00@sire.mail.pas.earthlink.net>

I started to install Linux RH6.2 on my router machine last night, but aborted 
after too many questions popped up in my head.

Note, this router is a toy for me to learn with, and only separates two 
networks not connected to the internet.  Even so, I want to build it with 
security in mind, and because it is the right way.

I want to route, firewall/filter and alternately do static IP's, DHCP, and 
play with IP Masq.  I also want to add tools to sniff the traffic on the 
router (no switching hubs here) and do remote logging.

I just can't seem to tell which programs to add to accomplish all of that.  I 
think the only way I can do this is to eliminate programs I know I do not 
need, and maybe remove more later.  I don't need X, but I want to load all of 
the libraries I can find, just to be sure.  Is there any case where I might 
need an X library even though there will be no X programs on the router?  
Does OpenShh in any way relate to telnet? can I safely eliminate telnet and 
ftp and just use the secure shell remote login?

Any advise on programs I should definitly not have on the router, besides the 
obvious like web services and Samba?  I know someone will recommend just 
using LRP or floppyfw, but I will get to those later.  For now I want to do 
it from a distro on the HD.  I will probably have enough trouble making 
things work without finding I forgot to compile something in.

TIA for any comments you may give.

I take a little different approach to distribution choice than
most people.  I don't think there is such a thing as one single "BEST"
distribution for every purpose.  Instead, there is the best distribution
to solve this problem and the best distribution to solve that problem,
but there is no overall best distribution.

In the closed source world, you start with a problem and then you
pick some big heavy tools that look useful - things like Windows XP
or AIX or Mac0S - and try to combine these with some heavy
applications like Office 2000 and AutoCad in such a way to solve
the problem.

In the OpenSource world, you should be able start with a problem and
look for a ready made distribution that solves your problem quickly and
easily with a minimum of trouble.

If you don't find a suitable distribution and your ambitious, you build
one by:

    -  generalizing the problem so your solution will be generally useful.

    -  looking for OpenSource tools on the internet or in various
       distributions which you can combine to solve the generalized
       problem in a fairly efficient manner.

    -  packaging, documenting, and publishing your solution so
       others can use it.

       (Yes, this is a lot of work; but this is the way of getting
       the best distribution for a certain problem.)

What I've been hoping to do with the Netule project <www.netule.org>
is to provide an organization to help people build and published
special purpose distributions of the this sort.

                                          Sincerely,

David, you hit the nail squarely on the head. Your post should be
required reading for any person/list that ventures into the no-win
"which is the best distro" argument. Most excellent.

KRUD - Kevin's RedHat Uber Distribution is put out by tummy.com.
Is a distribution that you can buy once in awhile or subscribe to.
Subscription gets you 2 CDs a month with a full current RedHat distribution
and all updates and security fixes and **a bunch of extra stuff**.  Get the
CD, pop it in the drive do a `rpm -Fvh *rpm` and your system is updated.  

An annual subscription is $65. The CDs usually arrive sometime between the
9th and the 16th and are current as of the 1st of the month.  So, your
system will be between 2 and 6 weeks out of date.  I subscribed for the
hassle free method of updating systems and it helped me meet an audit
requirement.

KRUD has it's own updater that allegedly will "resolve dependencies,
download the files, and install them... all in a single pass"  I haven't
tried it.

All of this is possible with an LRP box.

Does RedHat have a minimilist install?  Starting with a very secure machine (one
that has no services and can't do anything) is a good idea, add required
functionality one at a time, then test it.

Besides the fact that they both connect you to a remote machine, no.

Yes, in fact that is a recommended way of doing it.

Just run what you need, no more.

Personally, I think starting with a LRP box would be easier than building a
router from a desktop distribution.  No compiling required, all router
functionality is built in, there are pre-built packages for DHCP, sniffing, etc.
and the rules are already in place (they make for interesting reading too).

Hope that gives you some ideas.

 On Debian, "update-alternatives" is not used for the various MTA
 choices.  Those all provide "mail-transport-agent", and only one of
 those can be installed at a time.  With "dpkg", you can uninstall a
 package but leave it's "conffiles" behind and untouched.  You may
 later opt to "purge" the package, removing those conffiles, or you
 may reinstall the package, and it will start up with the conffiles
 you left from before.

 When you upgrade a package that has conffiles you've editted, it
 prompts you, asking if you would like to replace those, leave them as
 they are, view a diff between the new package's version and the
 version on the filesystem, or spawn a shell to have a look.  Most
 often I'll say "N", the default, and have it leave my version as is.
 Then I'll use XEmacs and "ediff" to interactivly merge the new parts
 of the "<conffile>.dpkg-dist" into my "<conffile>".  It rarely takes
 more than a minute or two to bring the conffile up to date and get a
 daemon restarted.

 The Debian Policy states that every init.d script must first check
 for the presence of the daemon it is meant to start and stop.  If the
 daemon is not there, ie, not presently installed, the script must
 exit silently.  The init.d scripts, and in fact, everything in
 "/etc/" are considered conffiles -- the local admin may edit them and
 the package manager contracts not to erase your changes without
 warning.

 "update-alternatives" is used for things like the several "brands" of
 "vi", the several emacs editors, and "awk" vs "mawk" vs "gawk" or
 what shell "/bin/sh" refers to.  Those with a login on
 drizzle.pdxlinux.org may have a look in "/etc/alternatives" to see
 what's there.

type `lsmod` and you'll see that ide-scsi is loaded.  I bet you don't have 
scsi_mod loaded, though.  Instead of using insmod, use modprobe instead.

Some modules have dependencies on others.  In you case you need at least 
those two.  So type `modprobe ide-scsi` then type `lsmod` and you'll see 
that both are now loaded and that scsi_mod is used by ide-scsi

You have one kernel "/boot/vmlinuz" with two different labels (linux and 
failsafe).  If this is the result of an rpm upgrade, it's a screw-up.  The 
image in each stanza has to point to a unique kernel.  And I'm not sure if 
having two append lines is kosher or not, you might just want to put them 
all on one line.

Cheers,

Just so you know, my distro is 7.2 and i only had the 2.4.7 kernel

That is common for the Mandrake install.  The menu offers you the normal and 
a failsafe boot option.  I don't know what is different when it appends 
"devfs=mount failsafe", I just know it is the way Mandrake installs a 
failsafe boot option in the menu.

There is a setting in galeon but I can't seem to find it anymore. If you
right click your page, you get a menu with back, forward, reload etc. If
you right click, then right click again on the back button, you will get
a history of previous URL's that you have visited. Anyone know where
this setting is? I have enebled in the past but can't seem to find it

Fascinating.  Devfs is truly mysterious, I better learn more.  Still, it 
seems like a the new kernel rpm didn't account for the possibility of there 
already being an "append" line.

It's really dead, though.  Smells like burnt electronics (or used

On my version 1.0.3 you go to Settings -> Preferences -> User Interface
-> Mouse and check "Right click on back/forward items activates history
popup.

BTW, thanks for the tip. I didn't know Galeon could do that. I think I'm
going to get attached to it :-) I also need to check out the other

What's weird is that in version 1.2.0, that feature is not there. Which
sucks because I love that feature, and truly miss it. Guess I will have
to hit the galeon mailing list and try to see what's up.

Thanks,

Jeff

 You should read the thread before you post, Matt.  We got talking
 about the "update-alternatives" feature that Red Hat has ported from
 Debian...

 I don't think that Mozilla allows that, unless perhaps it does that
 when you uninstall it's mail and news components.  If you uninstall
 them, it might require a plug-in to make that happen.

 Galeon allows configuration of your mail user agent.

I've noticed this on a few messages - but that is usually because people cc: 
plug at pdxlinux.org (which was the 'old' list, but is now aliased to the new list).

I'd check the headers of my messages to see who they're addressed to, and 
maybe see if you don't have a rogue procmail recipe going off around there.

The archives have stopped!

March 18th looks like the last post.

I've really gotten to like having them there, esp when my ISP has gone
through mail issues.

Can I help get them back?

Normally, this would be funny, but since it's coming from Michael Eisner, 
it is literally dangerous (and evil).

While he doesn't mention Open Source specifically, many have connected the 
dots between the CBDTPA (formally the SSSCA) and the DMCA which does have 
to potential to outlaw Linux in particular.

How long before we need to encrypt this list?

WWJD? (What would Jerry Do)

My ISP is/was blacklisted.

I'm assuming that they're being truthful that the problem was a bad user,
although I don't understand how such a drastic event could happen without
the ISP being given adequate notice.

My question is this: If I put a mail server up for myself, will I still have
problems if my ISP gets blacklisted? I'm on Verison DSL.

We've recently switched the PLUG lists to Mailman, and in the process the 
archives have moved to Mailman as well. I'm not sure, but I think someone is 
working on moving the old archives into Mailman, so that we have a 
comprehensive history.

That depends on how your ISP is being blacklisted. Some of the blacklists 
list all of your ISPs IP ranges while others only list the ISPs mail servers. 
Do you know which blacklist your ISP is on?

I know that there's other ways and lists, but I'm shocked that it's an issue
for anyone who doesn't want it to be (stopping immediately)

It looks like they're clear at the moment, and like it was just the mail
server name or individual IP address. If that's the case, I would have been
in the clear with my own mail server. How many other spam listing orgs are
there? Will I continue to have problems with this as SPAM overruns the
world? I need e-mail to operate efficiently in the world today.

Subject: [PLUG] Need a RedHat Linux Guru for ad hoc project work
Message-ID: <DJEKKEEHIOINKFBPJCLBMEDJDBAA.HSmythe@wstgroup.com>

Greetings.

I am currently working on a touch-screen kiosk project that is built on
RedHat 7.2 using Java and a lot of XML.  Having been a ?Microsoft kind of
guy? for a long time (since 1976 actually), I feel quite alone and afraid in
the Land of Linux :-).    Seriously, we?re pretty well along in our project,
but I could definitely use some occasional help from someone who knows there
way around Linux configuration issues, particularly for embedded and/or
multimedia systems. Some experience with tools for remote management of
Linux systems would also be helpful.

Work could begin as early as tomorrow if availability permits.  The project
also has need for additional help with XML and XSLT chores on an ongoing
basis ? and Java experience is also welcome.  Of course, we expect to pay
reasonable contract/consulting rates to experienced, qualified folks.

If anyone on the list is qualified, interested and available, please contact
me by e-mail with a resume or capability sheet and a note about availability
and rates.

Thanks.  I hope to hear from some of you soon.

Subject: [PLUG] Selectively delete files
Message-ID: <20020327210107.GB15090@boora.com>

I need to do some cleanup of my FTP site.  The idea is to delete all
files that haven't been modified in the last 90 days.
So something like this seems to work:
find /home/ftp -type f -mtime +90 -print0|xargs -0 rm
However there are certain directories that contain files that should never be deleted.
How can I incorporate a text file with a listing of directories that are
immune to file removal and evaluate my list of files against that list?
Or exclude those directories from the find?
Using file globbing wildcards would be nice too.

At the risk of being labeled a Perl zealot :-)... this could be done
with a pretty short Perl script. You can build a basic search script by
using Perl's find converter:

    find2perl /home/ftp -type f -mtime +90 -print0

and then modifying the resulting wanted() subroutine to add a check
against a hash that names files you don't want to touch.

Of course, you can also delete files in the script.

Well,well.........Thou shalt not steal.  This is news from the New York Post
(and reported elsewhere) that Michael himself is not immune to apparently
helping himself to what is not his and then destroying the evidence.

POOH SCANDAL IS '$HRED' HOT - DISNEY DESTROYED DOCUMENTS: JUDGE
New York Post; New York; Jan 29, 2002; NIKKI FINKE and LINDA STASI;

"In a bitter, 11-year-old lawsuit with a family that owns the commercial
rights to Winnie the Pooh, the Walt Disney Co. was systematically destroying
"massive amounts of documents . . . hundreds of boxes and thousands of
pages" that might have shown it withheld or under-reported Pooh royalties,
newly unsealed court records reveal."

Seems that the mouseketeer failed an audit.

Clifford


The timing of this new disclosure is extra troubling ...

Normally, this would be funny, but since it's coming from Michael Eisner,
it is literally dangerous (and evil).

While he doesn't mention Open Source specifically, many have connected the
dots between the CBDTPA (formally the SSSCA) and the DMCA which does have
to potential to outlaw Linux in particular.

How long before we need to encrypt this list?

Try the '-n' option to ping and see if that helps.

Gaaah, Karl, can you make the mail server rewrite the

Paul, are you the Paul Heinlein that used live in Silicon Valley and give
talks at Computer Literacy?  If so, I would expect you to know better ? you?
ve been around long enough.

Microsoft was in business long before MS-DOS.  I was a beta tester and one
of the very first corporate clients for Microsoft Fortran-C when Bill and
Paul were still sharing space in Alberquerqe with IMSAI.  I was VP of
Software Development for Schlage Electronics at the time (I?m old fart).

BTW, as an old guy, my memory isn?t what it used to be ? it might have been
1977.

Gaaah, Karl, can you make the mail server rewrite the
header addresses so plug at pdxlinux.org gets turned into
plug at lists.pdxlinux.org?

Just had a real suprise.  Installed Mandrake 8.2 on an Inspiron 8000 laptop, using the 3 downloaded ISO disks.
It correctly found the internal network adapter. It correctly
identified the ATI rage Mobility video and setup and ran
Xwindows without any problems.  I did use the expert mode
in order to see what was going on.  I used a clean disk and
first used the Dell utility to create the save2disk partition.
Diskdrake recoginzed the hybernation partition.  That feature
however does not work yet.  It will go into hybernation using 
Fn-A, and come back from it however there is no cursor and
the system is locked up.  Networking and internet access
both work.  

Anybody had experience with hybernation on the I8000?

OK here's a strange possibility.

When I was setting up my DSL I couldn't ping outside.  So I called up
tech support and they were able to ping my machine ! I absolutely
could not ping outside.

Unload driver and reload.

Still doesn't work.

Soft Reset box.

Try again, it works on the first try.

Weird, but true.

They both use Bcast:192.168.0.255 and Mask:255.255.255.0 though  their 
interrupts are both 11.  

Could it be a firewall setting?

Could be. I'm running Mandrake 8.1 and have Bastille on .
By golly! I just turnede Bastille off and she's purrin like a kitten.

Also:

The patent system changed this; secured to the inventor, for a limited time, 
the exclusive use of his invention; and thereby added the fuel of interest to 
the fire of genius, in the discovery and production of new and useful 
things."  As Michael Novak, of the American Enterprise Institute, has pointed 
out, those principles explain why the US constitution includes a clause 
guaranteeing the right of inventors and authors to royalties for patents and 
copyrights. 

Notice how the constitution gave these right to individuals...who die, as 
opposed to corporations that don't (always).  Patent and copyrights have been 
extended in time by corporations by legal changes to protect their property, 
not to protect the rights of individual inventors.  One of the great powers 
of a corporation is it's ability to outlast an individual.  They can change 
law to benefit themselves in the long term.  Over time the law has changed 
from the rights of the individuals being more powerful than companies, to 
corporate rights being more powerful than individuals. They can outlast a 
human in a legal claim, just by using time/money.

The subtle thing that got me is Mikey is likening the purchase of a copy of a 
work of are to that of fruit at a fruit stand - something to be 'used up' and 
another one bought and paid for a second time.

No. When I part with my money for a (legal) copy of a chunk of entertainment, 
I get some fair use rights, and the distributor and original artist 
relinquish some control over that copy of the work.

They are also trying to secure some 'rights' they don't now have, and as a 
consumer I just won't participate in Mikey's 'new and exciting' purchasing 
model.

Rights I have:
-To produce/distribute legitimate parodies of the work
-To produce/distribute opinions of the work
-To display the work in private, to replay the work as I wish
-To adjust playback or display settings of the work to my own aesthetic 
preference
- To give away my original copy of the work to someone else
- To play a work in part, to skip through a portion of the work
- To collect/acquire copies of works I like and not retain copies of other 
works I don't like.

Rights I don't have:
To duplicate said works and sell these to the public.

Rights they still have:
- To duplicate said works and sell these to the public.

Rights they don't have:
- To know my name/address as purchaser
- To know where and in what format I store the work
- To know how many times I've played/used the work or when
- To know who else is with me when I play/display the work
- To know my preferred adjustments/settings I applied to the work
- To make me play/display a work in its entirety, in real-time only, or in 
forced conjunction with some other works

Any others?

You've got a big problem. SPEWS is the big stick of the blacklisting world. 
They're anonymous (check out the whois listing for spews.org) and they list 
entire netblocks of ISPs that support spammers (as opposed to individual IPs 
like MAPS does). Somebody from IPNS showed up in news.admin.net-abuse.email 
yesterday asking for the listing to be removed but never responded when 
people asked him about nuking the spammers. If you do a google search for 
your ISP there are several hits for spam runs for something called 
naturalpenisgrowth.com or something so it doesn't look like the SPEWS listing 
is going to go away soon.

If I were you I would call your ISP and tell them that because they are 
supporting spammers you are unable to email parts of the Internet. Ask them 
if the money they get from the spammers is more important to them than the 
money they get from their legitimate customers and then ask them what they 
are going to do to fix their problems because until they do SPEWS will 
continue to list them.

On a related note, I'm glad ORBZ is out of operation. Those guys were a bunch 
of morons. The PLUG list would be reported to them on a regular basis (by 
knuckleheads who couldn't figure out how to unsubscribe) and they'd block 
mail.microsharp.com. I went to their page to verify that we weren't running 
an open relay (they claimed only to block open relays), we weren't in their 
published DB and according to their online tests, we weren't an open relay. 
And still our mail would get rejected by servers using ORBZ. 

I sent an e-mail asking what the hell was going on (in a much nicer manner) 
and recieved an angry e-mail from a holier-than-thou type telling me that if 
we weren't in the published list then we couldn't possibly have been 
blackholed. And still our mail would be blocked. 

Eventually they stopped blocking us, but not until after many members had 
been booted, because their mail servers were blocking any correspondence. 
Ever since this happened I've had a hairy eyeball on these robin-hood type 
blackhole lists...

Hmm. tmpwatch comes close:

Description :
The tmpwatch utility recursively searches through specified
directories and removes files which have not been accessed in a
specified period of time. Tmpwatch is normally used to clean up
directories that are used for temporarily holding files (for example,
/tmp). Tmpwatch ignores symlinks, will not switch filesystems, and
only removes empty directories and regular files.

AFAICT, tmpwatch doesn't provide that functionality on its own, but it
shouldn't be tough to create a shell script that reads a list of target
directories and has tmpwatch scan each in turn.

My local (Corvallis) LUG told me to ask you guys about taking a Linux
laptop online via cellphone.

I'm in the process of signing up for a cell phone -- my first -- and
am hoping to be able to use the phone as a modem from my laptop (which
runs Debian Woody).

Does any of you know anything about this?  In particular, if it makes
a difference what phone I choose I'd better find out now. :-)

A quick google search turned up only this

<http://cmb.physics.wisc.edu/~friess/laptop-cell-howto.html>

which says it's possible but doesn't mention brands etc.

I'm afraid I don't know enough about what's required to know even what
to ask.  But if you've used a cellphone (on Verizon's network, if it
matters) successfully, or tried and failed, please let me know.

Thanks,

--Eric House

Eric,

  Go to the local Verizon Wireless store and have them show you which brands
and models will work. I have a Kyocera QCP-6035 (combined PalmPilot and
phone); another list member has the Kyocera 3035. Both work. You'll need the
data cable (horribly expensive), but you can toss the Windoze cd rom that
comes with it. On the Kyoceras, you have to turn on the phone and put it
into data/fax mode.

  There are other brands and models (some for as little as $50) that have
the capability to transmit (and receive!) data.

  I'm running 14.4K and still have a few glitches to work out, but it is
workable.

  The computer guy at the store is the one who'll work with you.

Rich

I'm surprised that our own Karl Hegbloom didn't mention 'tmpreaper', a
program he apparently created in 1997 to do functions similar to tmpwatch.

Seems to check the time that a file hasn't been accessed, rather than how
old the file is.  Understands mtime (modified time) and atime (accessed
time).

Yes and no. I have had about 98% success rate sending directly from my
box across the internet. Two things seem to improve the success rate:

1) make sure your outbound mail uses a resolvable address for the envelope
sender, not just the "From:". You may need to set sender with sendmail's
-f option. You may need to also configure sendmail to accept your outbound
username as a "trusted" sender, and you may need to rename your box, or
configure sendmail to use a resolvable name. It doesn't seem to matter
much if you "borrow" a name, as long as it resolves.

2) Configure your sendmail to queue all messages and fork a seperate
process for each recipient. Or write a wrapper for sendmail that does the
same. Most sites seem to accept mail from a dialup if it only contains one
recipient. Two or more local or remote recipients? In the trash it goes!

I've had some problems recently with certain sites still refusing my mail,
because it originates from a dialup block. So I wrote a script to relay
through a remote shell-account running procmail. If your interested, I'll
forward my script to you privately. There are a lot of ways to implement a
relaying, and the best way depends on the user's situation. My script is
for use with pine localy, and procmail remotely. The received headers in
this message may illuminate somewhat the operation of my script. It's
fairly straightforward. No magic there. Script is still in developement,
but if you can read this, it works.

Current cell phones that provide reliable cellular modem service:

TDMA
----

 - Nokia 5160i
 - Nokia 6160i
 - Nokia 6360
 - Nokia 3360 (via IrDA only)
 - Motorola StarTAC 7797

GSM
---

 - Motorola P280G
 - Ericsson T28
 - Ericsson T39
 - Motorola V60

I would stay away from any CDMA phones that provile modem service.  Hell, I'd stay away from CDMA altogether if possible.  Who 
thought up this code divided crap anyways?

Remember, I said "reliable service".  Other phones will work as cellular modems, but I'd stick to those listen above.  I work 
for Canada's largest wireless provider, and have had a chance to test every model that has passed through our country.

It's for running MS Office on Linux. it's a WINE implementation that,

Something to think of in the future when considering your choice of
providers for a cell phone that will be used with your laptop is what
type of data technology they are using.

GSM is using GPRS for data which allows up to 56k connections.  Also GSM
will be the first standard to implement 3G wireless with UMTS and
maximum data transfer potentials in the gigabit range (although no
provider will go that high, 256k is not an unreasonable expectation). 
Actually I am currently working with the new 3G equipment and it is
sweet from a technical point of view as well.  

Of course, I'm a little biased since I work with the international
standard, but still the facts are the same.

Pardon my ignorance but why would an isp be blacklisted and by whom?

It might not be eloquent, but here's the message I sent to Sens. Wyden
and Smith and Rep. Hooley:

    Dear ...

    I am writing in advance of the Senate's full consideration of Sen.
    Holling's proposed Consumer Broadband and Digital Television
    Promotion Act (S.2048).

    I am shocked that a United States Senator would even consider
    proposing a bill that would mandate federal intervention into any
    piece of hardware of software that is capable of reproducing or
    displaying copyrighted works.

    Were it passed, the CBDTPA would severely restrict my fair-use
    rights to digital content, raise the price on most of the consumer
    electronics I buy, and potentially place federal regulation on or
    even outlaw my freedom to create, edit, and distribute software.

    I would be very pleased to hear that you are as disturbed about this
    bill as I am and that you intend to vote against it.

    Thank you.

I finally just couldn't stand it any more. The very idea of mandating
that Linux (or whatever) contain and use some federally approved
digital-rights software gives me the shivers. All of a sudden, 'make
menuconfig' and/or /sbin/rmmod get put on the Ten Most Wanted list.

It's fairly obvious that the entertainment business wants to treat
computer hardware and software like a federally controlled substance:
good for you in small doses and only when used under state-certified
supervision.

Maybe this is getting off topic, but since it's not too late for me to
change my provider let me lay down my criteria for the choice in the
hopes somebody can point me to a better provider -- if there is one.

I need:

1) A cell phone with a Corvallis number that won't charge me for
   roaming in the SF Bay Area, where I spend most of my time.  GSM, or
   at least Cingular, is out because they don't have reliable coverage
   in several of the places I spend a lot of time.  Verizon seems to
   have good coverage where I need to be, and they have a rate plan
   that lets me use the phone without running up bills.

2) I develop handheld apps for a living (current gig is AvantGo, and I
   have a hobby project PalmOS game that's been quite successful; see
   .sig) and want to start playing more with wireless tech, running
   game servers at home, etc.  Unlike some of the other carriers,
   Verizon lets me use my huge bucket of weekend minutes for either
   data or voice.  Contrast my boss's situation: a GSM phone
   (Cingular) that he never uses for data because the per-megabyte
   charge is too high for recreational use.

3) The above two requirements have led me to Verizon, and I'm planning
   on getting a phone/PDA combo branded by AudioVox.  But now I'm
   starting to hear that some phones will work as a modem so that I
   can dial into my ISP from my (Debian) laptop.  (Remember, this is
   my first cell phone; I'm new to this space!)  If indeed it's
   possible to use some phones as modems (not to connect to the cell
   provider's network, but simply to dial to my ISP or even to my home
   phone), but that others won't work (e.g. because they don't support
   the standard AT command set), I'd like to know before I pick my
   phone.
   
I hope that's more clear.

Thanks!

--Eric

Correct. Phones like the Kyocera 2135 function as modems on Verizon's
CDMA network. Just buy the connectivity kit (about $50, I think), connect
one end to the phone, the other to a serial port, and start talking AT
commands. Speed ain't great (14.4 Kb), but it works.

Verizon is starting a new high-speed data service accessible through
some of the newer phones. If it's worth an extra $20/month to you, you
get decent speed. I don't know whether this new service requires you to
dial an ISP or whether Verizon provides the point-of-presence.

This doesn't take all that much time to do. Thanks, Paul, for reminding
us that it is something we should all consider doing. One could simply
copy Paul's letter and send that, BUT it is even more effective to
restate the points in your own words, and include examples of how you
might be personally affected. In my case, I'm going to mention my hard
drive of MP3 files, ALL of which are fair use copies of CD's or LP's I
purchased, and still have. Putting the music on a hard drive is simply
more convenient for me than the individual recordings.

Anyway, thank you Paul for the reminder to give feedback to those folks
who represent us in Washington.

This particular situation seems to be that my ISP was providing some sort of
service to a paying user. The service wasn't hosting but it sounds like it
was DNS or they registered the name, or maybe they were just using their
mail server. Anyway the offending user started spamming (UCE) and because
somebody thought the ISP could make them stop, they listed them to keep the
spam of the net. A list is generated when people complain and send in
full-header examples of spam. The listing works because sysadmins use these
lists in their own mail servers to determine if the incoming mail is spam.
SpamCop is such a program and it uses a list that has my ISP.

I'm sure I've oversimplified and I've probably got some details wrong, but
that's how it looks to me.

ISPs get blacklisted when they don't do anything about spammers on their 
system. Most mail admins maintain a blacklist that's local to their system 
but to make it easier to protect users from spam some people started creating 
publicly available blacklists that are based on different criteria. Some of 
them list IP addresses of known open relays (meaning that anybody can connect 
to the server and send mail through it) that spammers use to try and cover 
their tracks. Other lists contain IP addresses of ISPs that don't kick their 
spammers off after several complaints from spam victims. At work we're using 
several different blacklists and we're blocking about ten percent of our 
total incoming email and I haven't heard from any of my users that legitimate 
email is being blocked.

A while back people were content to block just the source of the email itself 
but what spammers started doing was finding bullet-proof web and DNS hosting 
(often in Asia or Russia) and then signing up for dial-up accounts from any 
number of different ISPs. Anti-spammers now consider almost any form of spam 
support a "blockable" offense because it's the only way to shut the spammers 
down.

It's certainly not the best solution out there but it does seem to be 
working. Wander over to news.admin.net-abuse.email and you'll see people 
arguing both sides of the issue.

To attempt to bring this thread sort of back on topic, the biggest reason I 
got interested in Linux was because I wanted to set up my own mail server to 
block spam with. I ended up hiring Wil Cooley to help me set up a Red Hat 
server with Postfix at work that runs in front of our Exchange server and 
it's been working great. Now I'm also running my own Postfix server at home 
on my DSL line.

		It may seem like an oversimplification to some, but the
details help me to understand some of the terms and basic information that
some of the folks on this know very well.
		It is nice to feel comfortable enough to ask these
questions.

To make the message loud and clear, write it by hand, hand address the
envelope and send it by first class mail.

Several years ago I sent numerous e-mails to Wyden and Smith.  After
getting zero response I called Wyden's office and was advised that there is
so much spam, political and otherwise, that "it is impossible to read it
all."  My e-mails were about the need for some controls on spam...

Cheers,
Mike

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.31.0203281149360.19747-100000@eel.ENGR.ORST.EDU>

If anyone wants a concise overview of CBDTPA, I drafted this
brief (hopefully accurate) outline and list of references. -Tyler

--
Legislation known as the SSSCA was introduced into Congress on
Wednesday of last week [1].  Prior to introduction, the act was
renamed the CBDTPA: Consumer Broadband and Digital Television
Promotion Act. This legislation is supported by the media and
entertainment industry, who claim the law will bring copyright
enforcement power into the Digital Age. Several organizations,
including Intel Corporation, the ACM, and the Business Software
Alliance (BSA) have expressed concerns over CBDTPA.


To summarize, this act will prohibit manufacture and sale of
electronic devices unless they contain copyright-management
features. The nature of those features will be determined by
representatives of media organizations after the bill is enacted.


Proposed features involve requiring hard drive manufacturers to
include a unique identification key and content manager on each
drive. The content manager would authenticate with a remote server
before files are written to and from the disk. This would permit
entertainment companies to distribute pay-per-view content digitally
("pay-per-read") [6] and restrict the use of unauthorized files.
Under the CBDTPA, distribution of hardware not compliant with such
standards would become illegal [1].


While these restrictions relate to media devices, the CBDTPA states that
"All electronic devices that process information" must comply with
copyright management standards. As many electronic devices "process
information", it is possible the CBDTPA could apply to a broad range
of electronic equipment. [2]


In short, while copy-prevention measures to date have been implemented
in the copyrighted file, the CBDTPA mandates operational restrictions
on computer-related hardware, and the exact nature of those
restrictions would be determined by media industry representatives upon
passage of the bill.


In response to this act, Barbara Simmons and Eugene Spafford of the
United States ACM write:

"We can think of many objections to the legislation... Here is a small
sampling:

* Colleges, universities and trade schools throughout the U.S. would no
longer be able to teach advanced computer science and computer engineering.

* The acts of writing basic operating system software or assembling simple
computer systems in classes or as assignments would be against the proposed law.

* Researchers and hobbyists seeking new uses for innovative technology
might well find their experimentation and prototypes to be criminal under
this law. [2] "

and:

"Entertainment is only one, relatively minor use of networks and computing
technology... Legislating constraints on technology to aid the entertainment
industry has the potential to cause widespread and severe damage to society
at large." [4]

A response from Intel can be found at [5] (pdf).

I think this is fairly accurate; I don't see any salient errors.
Well, usually there is also an attempt by the black-list maintainer
to notify the ISP and give them a chance to respond.

Occasionally there's a problem for the ISP because a site that's
important to a customer gets blacklisted.  For example, the state
of Oregon's VIP mail server is in the ORDB.  VIP is the state
contracting system, so people making proposals for contracts need
to be able to recieve mail...

If anyone knows the right person to talk to or simply wants to
complain about their mismanagement to some government officers,
I'd appreciate it; my messages to postmaster@ were never answered
and I'm hesitant to make a habit if making such exclusions.

 I've not finished reading the "Exim" book yet.  When I get to the

 If anyone is an Exim expert and knows the recipe, please send it to
 me and I'll install it.

   Another Punch for Copy Protection
   By Declan McCullagh (declan at wired.com)

   12:00 p.m. March 28, 2002 PST
   WASHINGTON -- A political brawl over mandatory copy protection is
   about to spread to the U.S. House of Representatives.

   A Democratic legislator from the home of the Walt Disney and Warner
   Bros. studios is drafting a bill to reduce online piracy by implanting
   strict copy controls in digital devices.

   On Wednesday, Rep. Adam Schiff of Burbank, California, circulated a
   letter on Capitol Hill seeking co-sponsors for his legislation, which
   he said would follow the same approach as the Consumer Broadband and
   Digital Television Promotion Act (CBDTPA) in the Senate.

   "I plan to introduce legislation that would safeguard digital content
   by spurring the rapid development of copyright protection technology,"
   Schiff's "Dear Colleague" letter said. "Similar legislation, S. 2048,
   has been introduced in the Senate. I believe this is a necessary step
   and I encourage you to join me in this effort.

This was once very, very true. However, since the anthrax incidents in 
October and November, most Congressional offices actually *prefer* 
email, and due to new mail screening processes, snail-mail to your 
Senator or Rep may be delayed for weeks.

Go with email. If you want do double-up your emphasis, do both.

  Just think of what this will do to Kinkos, LazerQuick and fax machines. 

  Dangerous, dangerous stuff with more "unintended consequences" than value.
 
  And the point about audio and video use of computers is the most salient:
we don't have sound cards or speakers on our systems because we use them to
crunch numbers, process words and do other business-oriented tasks. We also
have stereo systems and TV/VCR systems available for noise and motion.

Sigh,

Anyone know if/where there is a flag/setting that controls the order of

For what it's worth, I have a "more complete" archive, in that I have
already included the skylab.org archive along with others.  I still
need to do some cleaning though.

Either in the global "REWRITE" section:
plug at pdxlinux.org plug at lists.pdxlinux.org hE
(this rewrites all headers and the envelope)

Or on the transport:
headers_rewrite = plug at pdxlinux.org plug at lists.pdxlinux.org

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0203281447180.3050-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  Has anyone successfully installed and run the GUASH plug-in for
GIMP-1.2.x? I have it built and installed, but when I invoke the tool it
sits ('reading directory') for a very long time, then it crashes.

  This plug-in is supposed to let me view thumbnails of all images in a
directory at one time. Much better for sorting and selecting than is opening
them one at a time.

TIA,

Rich

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0203281525160.3795-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I figured out the problem: the plug-in looks for thumbnails for every file
in the directory, and each directory below it. So, if you start the GIMP
from a taskbar icon the top directory is ~/.

  What I did was create a photo/ directory under the project directory, then
created subdirectories under photo/ for each year. Rather than start GIMP
from the icon, I opened another vt, changed to the specific directory in
which I want to work, then invoked the GIMP and the GUASH plug-in. It still
takes a while with high-resolution images (and a bunch of 'em, at that) on
my ol' PII/333, but it's working now.

  Too bad the applet didn't come with instructions. :-) But, now that I
killed about an hour, I can see all the images and select the ones I want
for the reports.

Whew!

Message-ID: <20020324021705.C697@defiant.kingkon.com>

Howdy,

According to the installed docs for apache, there is a way to turn on
PHP, PYTHON, PERL, etc. But I can't seem to get it to work.

Inside the /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file, there are a number of
"IfDefine HAVE_PHP" type directives, and there are instructions on how
to invoke them using "httpd -D HAVE_PHP", but whenever I attempt that,
I get a usage list like "{start|stop|restart|...} that doesn't include
the -D usage. However, if you run "httpd --help" you _do_ get a usage
instruction that includes the -D option.

Then, some unexpected flash of brilliance reminded me that the file
should not be called 'index.html'; it should be called 'index.php4'.
Making this change caused the php code I placed on that page to start
working.

One would think *that* bit of info would be mentioned in the "how to
test your installation" document that I was reading when I got into
this very long configuration debugging session to begin with!

I didn't think ftp was insecure. The version is whatever comes with
rh7.2; with no patch updates. I'm sure that some have been released,
but I hadn't had an opportunity to get them installed. I can't tell
you exactly which version of ftp that is, as the system has not yet
been rebuilt. My home system could prove useful, but I'm not at home.

I knew not to open up port 23, as I got my root password hacked a
while back. I fixed that, and closed port 23. Then I opened up port 22
so that I could manage the system with ssh. Port 80 had been open for
awhile, so that apache could serve pages. Then, the other primary user
of this system wanted a way to update web pages with interFTP (an OS/2
product similar to wu-ftp, so I did a bit of research, and opened up
ports 20 & 21.

Obviously, there is a better solution - and I'm all ears!

Did you find a Linux way to convert CDR files?

If so, I'd be interested in knowing, that way I wouldn't have to keep

Howdy,

According to the installed docs for apache, there is a way to turn on
PHP, PYTHON, PERL, etc. But I can't seem to get it to work.

Inside the /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file, there are a number of
"IfDefine HAVE_PHP" type directives, and there are instructions on how
to invoke them using "httpd -D HAVE_PHP", but whenever I attempt that,
I get a usage list like "{start|stop|restart|...} that doesn't include
the -D usage. However, if you run "httpd --help" you _do_ get a usage
instruction that includes the -D option.

Then, some unexpected flash of brilliance reminded me that the file
should not be called 'index.html'; it should be called 'index.php4'.
Making this change caused the php code I placed on that page to start
working.

One would think *that* bit of info would be mentioned in the "how to
test your installation" document that I was reading when I got into
this very long configuration debugging session to begin with!

Message-ID: <20020329013454.35103.qmail@web9605.mail.yahoo.com>

Integrated sound is becoming increasingly popular
these days, with the Codec97 sound chip found in quite
a few modern computers. Among the Linux distributions
I have used, Mandrake and Red Hat both recognize the
chip, but both like to disable it in BIOS upon reboot.
(I thought it might be a Mandrake-specific problem,
the devfs stuff, but Red Hat does it, too.) 

If anyone else on this list is aware of this problem
and knows how to cope with it, the information would
be much appreciated. (One workaround is another sound
card--then the Codec97 can be left disabled--but its
performance is otherwise acceptable, at least for many users.)

Actually it is pretty easy to get these to work.

First of all you need to check if mod_php (or any of the others) are 
installed.

rpm -qa | grep php

If they are, then you need to check to make sure the modules are enabled in 
/etc/httpd/conf/http.conf.

Check to see if the "LoadModule" and "AddModule" lines for the version of php 
you are using are uncommented.

Restart apache:

/etc/init.d/httpd restart

NOTE: You do *not* need to add the information to the start script in any 
way.  The init script does this for you automagically. (It looks for what 
libraries and modules are available and builds the -D parameters each time it 
is run.)

Hope that helps.

Well, if you consider sending passwords in clear text secure, then it's 
secure. That's a design flaw of ftp. The protocol does not provide for 
secure transmission of identifying data.

Exactly the same exploit works with ftp. Just sniff the packets.

I probably posted it to quickly.  I was following the discussion over
on the Mandrake-experts list, the link came by, I ran over and saw the
nice table, and thought "hey, pluggers would appreciate this".  Then I
posted to PLUG and went back to the site and had the same thought as
you.

It _is_ a wiki, however, so tomorrow there is likely to be more info.
When Civileme (a Mandrake employee and heavyweight) weighs in, I hope
to see more info.  Main message from his tests, and others comments:

   ext3 is a dog compared to reiserfs and XFS when it comes to speed, but
   is probably the most "robust".

Take a look at the Linux USB FAQ and Guide at http://www.linux-usb.org/
for all sorts of good information.

If you still have problems after that, read the FAQ on how to report USB
bugs and send it to the linux-usb-users mailing list.

This could be a boon to the Canadian economy (or Mexican, for that

computers, etc., we'll just start buying from other countries.  A huge 
black market for bootleg components would start thriving, and FreeGeek 
would finally be profitable. ;)  Actually, I believe strongly in innovation

Interesting. In both cases, the attack occurred when there was no
activity on the system. In fact, it happened within 24 hours of
opening up the ports. That might have been true with the telnet
problem several months ago, as I was the one accessing the system. But
in the case of opening up the ftp ports last week - I opened the ports
on Wed eve about 7:30, made a single connection to test it, and then
neither of us did squat for the next several days. He (the owner of
the system) didn't even know it was dead.

{He's got about 15 systems running all sorts of OS's, and trying to
run a business too; linux is a learning thing for him, that has pretty
low priority - I get to manage it's activities until it shows a
profitable potential! And with days like this, it's not a good showing.}

I did. There's alot of data there, and I don't have a continuous
connection. It would be cool if sites like this had a "download the
entire doc" file, that I could peruse offline while working out the
issues.

Sorry, I forgot to reply.  The files in question are on a CD and my wife 
can convert them at her school, when she needs to.(I believe they have 
Corel Draw up and going.) As far  as I  could find that's the only way.

I run xcdroast from a shell prompt after "su"ing to root.  Works fine.

Have a look at the README.nonroot file in the docs for XCDRoast.  Tells you exactly how to set it up.  I have it running on mine as a non-root user.

Those who cry theft fail to observe the fundamental difference between 
outright theft and copyright infringement:  When something is copied, 
the original owner still has his or her copy, whereas if someone steals 
my car, I'm walking.

Heard there was a major victory for Kazaa yesterday also.

If our Linux OS's and many apps are primarly GPL, we probably don't have 
much to worry about.

So if someone steals and cashes a paycheck out of your mailbox, it's just
infringement instead of theft. Not that I agree with Eisner and with the
massive subversion of copyright law now going on, but infringement does
deprive copyright holders of income.

Yes, but that was in a Dutch court.  <sarcasm>The Dutch are just a wee bit
more liberal than the US</sarcasm>.  The major Dutch far-right party,

I probably posted it to quickly.  I was following the discussion over on the
Mandrake-experts list, the link came by, I ran over and saw the nice table,
and thought "hey, pluggers would appreciate this".  Then I posted to PLUG
and went back to the site and had the same thought as you.

It _is_ a wiki, however, so tomorrow there is likely to be more info. When
Civileme (a Mandrake employee and heavyweight) weighs in, I hope to see more
info.  Main message from his tests, and others comments:

   ext3 is a dog compared to reiserfs and XFS when it comes to speed, but
   is probably the most "robust".

The problem with ftp has nothing to do with linux. The same thing can
happen with any unix. If you use a privileged users account to access
the system via ftp, then the password can be compromised. 

For that reason, ftp should only be considered for anonymous
connections. 

If you need users to transfer files, then use scp (comes with openssh).

No, because there's only one copy of that check. Whereas, with a CD or
tape, there are thousands or millions of copies floating about, and the
original is still in the owners hands.

Not if the person with the "illegal" copy wouldn't have bought it.

  Or, 'sftp', also with OpenSSH. I've found sftp has more flexibility in use
than does scp.

Message-ID: <20020329172851.GB25335@boora.com>

I'm running this command to help me find all files that haven't been
modified in 180 days and delete them.
find . -type f -mtime +180 -print0|xargs -0 ls -al

This is what I get:
total 52
drwxrwx---    5 ftpuser  ftpgroup     4096 Feb  4 10:12 .
drwxr-xr-x   34 ftp      ftpgroup     4096 Mar 15 16:41 ..

drwxrwx---    2 nobody   ftpgroup     4096 Nov  9 13:30 Docs

It seems to me that I should only see files, not directories.  And the
one file that returned HAS been modified within 180 days.  I noticed
lots of false positives when files have spaces in their names.  Is this
a limitation of find?  Can it be overcome?

  Marcel Gagne's book on linux system administration has a shell script that
does this. I ran it for a couple of days but stopped because it kept finding
the same, humongous number of files. I don't have the time to go look it up
now, but I'll try to do so later if you still need the help.

Ah, so the fact they would not have bought it entitles them to a free
copy?

And people wonder why Eisner's comments find a sympathetic audience?

Profitable is the key word, here. There's nothing wrong with charities
making money. They just have to spend it. I don't know what the actual
rules are, but I know that it is perfectly OK for them to have
investments that pay dividends to them to pay their expenses. No reason
those expenses couldn't be paid from the proceeds of sales, either.
Actually, now that I think of it, that's done all the time, too. Think
Girl Scout cookies.

Quoting from a FAQ (http://www.nonprofits.org/npofaq/01/09.html):

  "Nonprofit" refers to an organization established for purposes other
  than profit-making. Note here that nonprofit does not necessarily mean
  "charitable."

So "profitable" is probably not the right word, but a non-profit can
certainly be self-supporting and not require donations to survive.

Heh. Try running it like this:

  find . -type f -mtime +180 -print0|xargs -0 ls -ald

Note the addition of the -d option to the ls invocation. What you'll
notice is that find is returning only one entry: the current directory
(.). Without the -d switch, ls will expand a directory listing, which is
what it's done in your example.

According to the xargs info page, the command associated with xargs (in
this case, ls) will normally "run once even if there is no input." You
can run off that behavior with the --no-run-if-empty (-r) switch, e.g.,

  find . -type f -mtime +180 -print0|xargs -0r ls -al

Obscure, no? :-)

A nice site.

Anyone know, off hand, if the latest `dump' and `restore' will work with
XFS (or ReiserFS for that matter)?  I know it works with ext3.

As an aside, there has been at least one person on the Mandrake-experts
list who claimed that he ended up with several trashed files (filled with
nulls) under XFS when power was cut to his system.

Obligatory self-editing. That should have read

Subject: [PLUG] domain registration - cheap and simple?
Message-ID: <3CA4B696.1070002@gregory.myftp.org>

This is far more difficult than I thought it would be.

It seems most (all?) of these registration services offer a ton of 
services I have no need for.  All I am really looking for is to register 
a domain and forward it to my IP, with a web interface I can change the 
IP if my dynamic IP changes (cablemodem - fortunately the dynamic IP is 
pretty static)

www.lowcostdomains.com - we set one up and all they seem to feature is 
forwarding of HTTP traffic.  My domain name still resolves to their IP.

www.godaddy.com - cheap, $8.95/yr.  can't get a clear answer there either.

www.tzo.com - excellent premier service - they even feature an app which 
runs on your server and will automatically change the IP address on 
their dynamic DNS servers if it changes.  $59.95/year though.

I thought i would put the question out to those with this sort of admin 
experience and see if anyone had the inside scoop on how to do this 
without messing with any of these services, or could just recommend an 
inexpensive one that does this.  I don't need the automatic DNS update 
client.

And I learned that you cannot set the immutable attribute in the ReiserFS!


Otherwise no problems, and it is great if you trip over the

Something is very odd.  I just ran your command:

find /pic/deanm -type f -mtime +180 -print0|xargs -0 ls -al > /tmp/junk0 2>&1 &

.... a minute later ....

Found 14059 files, no directories, and all more than 180 days old.

It works.
This is on a Mdk 7.2 system:

=>rpm -qf `which find`
findutils-4.1.1-6mdk

=>rpm -qf `which xargs`
findutils-4.1.1-6mdk


Now lets try it on a "modern" system, Mdk 8.1:

Oooh, that was fast.  Done in 10 seconds.  (The power of fast SCSI).
Found  13832 files, no dirs, all appear to be older than 180 days (I look
at the date and they all show the _year_ not the time, so they are rather old.

=>rpm -qf `which find`
findutils-4.1.7-2mdk

=>rpm -qf `which xargs`
findutils-4.1.7-2mdk


On both systems there's lots of dirs and files that are both older and newer
than 180 days.

You're smart.
The -0r seemed to do the trick....or did it...
This is my example:
 find . -type f -mtime +1 -print0|xargs -0 ls -al
 total 292824                             
 drwxrwx---    2 ftpuser  ftpgroup     4096 Mar 27 15:06 .

find . -type f -mtime +1 -print0|xargs -0r ls -al

Adding the r shows no resluts when there should be since these files
were modified more than 1 day ago.

Subject: [PLUG] Debugging New Apache + PHP Build
Message-ID: <CE8B74E0F3F5D311B97F00508B6BF7AA03920203@msnbex05.bn.usi.net>

This isn't a Linux problem, but with OS X Server (based on the Rhapsody 5.6
kernel, not Darwin).  Nevertheless, this is a Linux/UNIX group, so here
goes.
 
Background: I'm setting up an Apache/MySQL/PHP environment.  It is separate
from the main webserver (after development, it could be combined, but not
now) so it has it's own configuration file, pid file, and listens on it's
own port.
 
I've compiled PHP for OS X server --with-apxs and everything seems to work
fine.  I have httpd.conf (in this case, forum.conf) configured properly.
However, Apache won't start.  testconfig says I have a good configuration
file, and there is no error code.
 
I tried running the server in single threaded debug mode, using:
 
/usr/sbin/apache -X -f Configuration/forum.conf
 
It gives me one word of output and then dies:  Abort.
 
Any suggestions?  I doubt any one in the group has done this exact thing
before, but perhaps something similar?  Also, I've only used PHP as an
Apache module, but would using CGI be a better way to isolate the problem?
 
Any help would be appreciated...
 
Thanks,
John Pelster

I think he was addressing your specific assertion that the "infringer"
has taken money out of someones pocket.  If you want to address a
different question, then go ahead.

In a larger context, the easy way "rob" someone of their income while
also avoiding any "infringement" is to not bother with their stinkin'
proprietary "expression" to begin with.  There is _very_ little
"entertainment" content these days that is _worth_ "stealing".

I register with GODADDY.COM, $8.95 you need your own DNS server and you can
change the IP of it anytime you want.

I have a domain, setup two systems as a DNS, HTTP servers. I could let you
use one of mine as a secondary dns, or fake it and put cable guy's DNS in.

you could also give your "eth" a second IP, ??? you cant with cable unless
you pay, sorry.

Subject: [PLUG] domain registration - cheap and simple?


This is far more difficult than I thought it would be.

It seems most (all?) of these registration services offer a ton of
services I have no need for.  All I am really looking for is to register
a domain and forward it to my IP, with a web interface I can change the
IP if my dynamic IP changes (cablemodem - fortunately the dynamic IP is
pretty static)

www.lowcostdomains.com - we set one up and all they seem to feature is
forwarding of HTTP traffic.  My domain name still resolves to their IP.

www.godaddy.com - cheap, $8.95/yr.  can't get a clear answer there either.

www.tzo.com - excellent premier service - they even feature an app which
runs on your server and will automatically change the IP address on
their dynamic DNS servers if it changes.  $59.95/year though.

I thought i would put the question out to those with this sort of admin
experience and see if anyone had the inside scoop on how to do this
without messing with any of these services, or could just recommend an
inexpensive one that does this.  I don't need the automatic DNS update
client.

Take a peek at find's -daystart option to see why you're getting this

Is 'apache' really the name of the executable? Wierd :-)

Anyway, in your configuration file, set LogLevel to 'debug' and run
httpd (er, apache) again. Then look at your error_log to see if it picks
up on anything.

If that doesn't work, you might try digging around for 'truss' (which is
/usr/bin/truss on FreeBSD systems). Try running apache under it, e.g.,

  truss -o /tmp/apache.debug /usr/sbin/apache ...

The /tmp/apache.debug file will contain a record of the system calls
made by apache and, hopefully, an indication of which one failed.

Thanks Paul,

Taking your advice, I found this error:
dyld found undefined symbol: pen_file_for_scanning

Now, doing some Googling, it seems that people have run into this before and
I need to recompile Apache and build PHP into it...  Arg.

This causes problems for me because this server already has a production
server running with WebObjects (an application server Apple inherited from
NeXT) and I don't want to touch the existing Apache installation.

So, would the best thing to do be recompile Apache w/ PHP and just configure
the heck out of it so that it uses it's own directories and executable
names... (will --with-suffix work?)

Has anyone here ran two separate versions of Apache on one server?

Thanks,
John Pelster

Sure. It's almost a no-brainer. When you configure Apache, just set the
prefix to something unique:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache-test

or whatever. Everything will get installed into that directory tree, and
it can peacefully coexist with your production server (as long as
they're listening on different ports).

Yeah, I'm also going to have use --with-layout=GNU or --with-layout=Apache
too, otherwise it will detect OS X and overwrite the modules in the libexec
dir (defaults to /System/Library/Apache/Module even when you define
--prefix).

  I figured out the problem: the plug-in looks for thumbnails for every
file
in the directory, and each directory below it. So, if you start the GIMP
from a taskbar icon the top directory is ~/.

  What I did was create a photo/ directory under the project directory,
then
created subdirectories under photo/ for each year. Rather than start
GIMP
from the icon, I opened another vt, changed to the specific directory in
which I want to work, then invoked the GIMP and the GUASH plug-in. It
still
takes a while with high-resolution images (and a bunch of 'em, at that)
on
my ol' PII/333, but it's working now.

  Too bad the applet didn't come with instructions. :-) But, now that I
killed about an hour, I can see all the images and select the ones I
want
for the reports.

Whew!

My Fonts look bad, with some in the various web browsers unreadable.

I improved some of the desktop fonts by making them larger, but still use 
the defaults in Konqueror, Netscape, etc.

>From the talk in other Linux newsgroups this seems to be a major problem 
with no cure-all fixes. Or did I just missed the fix in all the confusion?

Does anyone know of a fix or what causes this to occur?

One of the reasons I cannot use Linux more is the word processors have 
terrible fonts. I have tried multiple computers, monitors, and Linux 
distros with the same effect.

Currently OS Red Hat 7.2

The full explanation for crappy fonts is way more information than you
need :-), but check whether you have abiword installed - it installs
some truly ugly fonts that end up matching many font requests from many
applications. If you don't need it, this would be a good time to nuke it.

Eric,

  That's not going to help me. I've jpg files in different directories all
over the place. Actually, I'll probably be using GUASH only on occasion so
it won't be too much of an issue. Despite the apparent hassle, it sure makes
it easier to select images when they're all named
<date>.<site>-<sequence_number>.jpg; that's useful for storage but not for
selection. :-)

Robert,

  What fonts have you installed, and it what order are they listed in the
fonts/ directory? Also, what word processor(s) have you tried?

  The only problems I have with some web pages is that the designer chose
horrible, low contrast colors (e.g., blue on green) or a black background
and that makes the page difficult -- or impossible -- for me to read.

  My mozilla, opera, WordPerfect, etc. fonts are just fine. Of course, in
the text apps (e.g., pine, emacs, joe, general ledger) I can even work
without my reading glasses. :-)

  This comment has appeared here several times. I'd like to try AbiWord so
is there a way to install it to use existing fonts rather than its own?

Sorry, I don't know where the fonts directory is.  When I have more time I 
will track it down. There is Abiword and Kword.  I don't recognize any 
other word processors.

as root...

rpm -e abiword

And this is a good fix to many font problems. Also the advice about
TrueType is also very good. You can find an RPM that contains the
Microsoft web fonts at RPMFind.

Message-ID: <3CA4F870.3080201@etherknot.com>

Hi,

I am trying to run Netbeans on Mandrake 8.0.  It always hangs.  It seems 
to be triggered by different actions.  But usually when compiling or 
running the code being developed.

When I do

   ps aux

I can see many java threads in the 'S' state, and one in the 'D' state.  

Netbeans is written in Java.  But I don't think any Linux application 
should be able to hang a process in the 'D' state unless something is 
wrong with linux (e.g. a driver.)  I have to reboot to rid myself of the 
thread in the 'D' state.  kill -9 does not eliminate it.

I've searched the netbeans website, the javasoft website and done a 
www.google.com/linux search but to no avail.  I'm sure there is an 
answer out there but have not worded the search correctly yet.

- So does anyone know how to get netbeans working?  
- Can you confirm that this is not a java problem but an OS problem.  
- How do I determine what the task in the 'D' state is actually waiting for?

TIA, Chris

Russ, so the way this works is someone along the net-route of the

and my ISP for example, or if I were being hosted at www.cheaphost.com, 
and I needed to upload my .html files by ftp?

He didn't say they were entitled to it, just that the copyright owner 
suffered no loss, which seems self-evident given his assumption.

Intellectual prop. is quite different from the usual sort.  It's more 
like a grant of monopoly from a gov.  After all if I sell you a car, I 
don't have to mention fair use.  When I buy a book, I can do anything I 
want with it as physical property, it's only when I begin to intefere 
with the monopoly right to publish that I run into trouble.

What Eisner is asking for is absolutely without precedent and 
outrageous.  He's saying that because he can't enforce his right of 
monopoly over copying, the whole rest of society should be forced by 
government power to change the very technology at the heart of the 
digital revolution.  It's as if someone who had the basil monopoly for 
the US insisted on sensors in your cooking pots to make sure you weren't 
infringing his grant.  Also, we'd have potted plant inspectors, checking 
your windowsill to make sure you weren't growing your own.

Any purported right that generates such a monstrous interference with 
other better established rights is clearly no right.

Packets get routed all over the world. With automated logins, it's
entirely possible for both username and password to be in the same
packet. 

It's harder if you have a modem connection between you and you ISP, but
even that's not foolproof, as many ISPs have modem pools in the CO that
simply dump into the ether. Then it's routed along with everything else.

It's not unusual for packets from my place of employment to be routed
from downtown Portland, to Seattle, through the Bay Area, and finally
make it back through Portland to Aloha. With it going through the NOC in
the Bay Area, there's A LOT of peering going on there, and one sniffer
can capture a lot of data quickly. 

The point is that it's a possible point of exploitation. I can use a
clothespin on my gate to hold it shut, but it doesn't take much to break
that security. SCP and SFTP are useful, and available. 

Why take the risk?

However, most all new distros ship a modified version of the hotplug
package, tuned for their specific startup scripts.

There's also an article in the April 2002 issue of Linux Journal
explaining how the whole Linux Hotplug system works, if people are
interested in the details behind all of the magic :)

I read an article in eWEEK about a group who is developing a new
"version" of Linux specifically for the telco industry.  Any
ideas what such a version of Linux might entail?  What does a
telco need from Linux that other industries may not?

  It's a joint venture between IBM and S.u.S.E.

I was going to say something about that article a couple weeks ago when
I first read it -- and that is that in it, Greg (yeah, he's the author)
does a tremendous job of explaining the issues raised by hot-pluggable
devices and the current solutions people have coded.

Nice job, Greg. Sorry it took so long for me to say so.

Telcos need reliability.  I'm talking SERIOUS reliability.

Telcos are required by FCC regulations to provide service at an
unbelievably high level.

For example, a dial-tone provider is allowed to take that dial-tone
service down for one second every two years.  Telephone number routing is
allowed to fail for two seconds every year.

WOW!!!!!   It worked like magic and I have not even rebooted. It's not 
perfect, but it's an incredable visual difference.  I can read the small 
print now and not get as big a headache reading funny looking medium print. 
Abiword might as well be a Linux saboteur.

I am still not sure how to install the TrueType though.

Here's a place to start for truetype. No beating around the bush here; it's
called font de-uglification.

http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/FDU/

Also, here is some stuff from a page on doing Turkish(!) language support in
Redhat 7.2. Funny how non-English users have to deal with this stuff more
overtly and end up driving the documentation on the font front.

http://www.arayan.com/da/linux.html

Copy trutype fonts from a windows system (*.ttf) to
/usr/share/fonts/default/TrueType.

cd /usr/share/fonts/default/TrueType
ttmkfdir -o fonts.scale
mkfontdir

Select these fonts in your favorite web browser and enjoy!

If you are using X 4.x then using truetype fonts is much simpler :

Section "Files"
# breaks rxvt & gnumeric !?
#  FontPath   "unix/:7100"
  FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc:unscaled"
  FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi:unscaled"
  FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi:unscaled"
  FontPath   "/usr/share/fonts/truetype"
  FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo"
  FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1"
EndSection

Section "Module"
	Load  "record"
	Load  "extmod"
	Load  "dbe"
	Load  "dri"
	Load  "glx"
	Load  "xie"
        Load "speedo"
        Load "type1"
        Load "freetype"
EndSection

However getting the truetype fonts directories set-up is a bit of pain.

Create a directory to hold them, I use :

  /usr/share/fonts/truetype

Then do the font size generation thing :

  mkfontdir  something something something....


Sorry but I can't remember the magic words

Then create a link from fonts.scale to fonts.dir

-rw-r--r--    1 root     root         7436 Feb  4 11:51 fonts.dir
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            9 Feb  4 14:01 fonts.scale -> fonts.dir

Shit, there was so much HTML in his stupid email that I couldn't read the
damn thing. If he had come to a PLUG meeting & puked in front of the entire
group, it would have had the same effect on me.

I'm thinking of putting the HTML entry BACK into my procmail file because
of jerks like him.

That's interesting.  What's the NOC and why are they looking at packets?

I'm a little surprised that ftp (non-anonymous) is still being used.

So, in general, are you saying that I can probably use sftp to upload to 
a website instead of ftp? I guess the reason that most of the common 
tools are ftp based, gFtp etc, is that what most of us have on our 
personal websites isn't worth protecting(:-).

If you are trying to setup a cvs server, then make sure your pserver is
running.  Usually it runs out of inet, but in later versions of Linux it can
be run out of xinetd.

In your environment set CVSROOT to your repository were a directory cvsroot
has been created by the command cvs import <project> where project is
usually a directory name in your current working directory.  All files under
this directory will be "imported" into your repository (remember your
CVSROOT=repository directory.)

To work on your new project, cvs checkout <project> from a new working
directory of your choice.

To commit work from your new working directory, cvs checkin <project>.  cvs
will request a comment and lead you through anything it needs.

You may want to get a neat book on the subject
http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/cvspr/ or other equally fine reference book.
There is an OK man page on cvs.

Can't figure out why DNS zone transfers fail.  What is this protocol 17 that
keeps coming up?

This is a RIP packet.  Protocol 17 is UDP (see
/etc/protocols) and port 520 is RIP (see /etc/services).
The host at 209.210.202.165 has 'routed' or another routing
daemon running.  It's probably not a problem.

This is your problem: Does /usr/sbin/named-xfer exist?  Maybe it's
somewhere else?  If so, see the BIND manual to configure it for
another path.

Okay, where are the paths for named and named-xfer set?
Any advice on buying a book on bind, what's the best source?
I found named and named-xfer under /chroot/bind/usr/sbin where
they belong and I forgot that the master server is down.

I had trouble before the main machine went out.  I did a manual named-xfer
transfer as root on the backup box to establish this backup server because
it wasn't transferring the zones automatically.  I've been compiling bind 8
from www.isc.org source, unlike an rpm where verify is available how can the
integrity of installed libraries and executables from custom compilations be
checked?

-----  Mail problems -----

The next major job for me is going from a local only sendmail central mail
hub for local servers to a mail configuration free of expensive external
mailboxes and arbitrary limits on the number of email accounts.  We
currently have two Opus mailboxes at $4 a piece per month which can only be
accessed via clear text imap or pop.  I'd like to be ISP independent so that
we have the option of changing providers/using multiple providers.

One mail  project currently underway is to subscribe a local PLUG account on
the mailhub to the plug list and give everyone on the local network the
password to that linux account.  The PLUG account would have duplicate
message filtering, mailbox size management, filtering of non-plug messages,
and other good ideas I haven't thought of...  I want antiviral protection at
the MTA level on the gateway.  I am considering installing Postfix at the
gateway, the only box with an external ip at this time, and have the gateway
prepare mail to go into the hub or out to the Internet.

It is supposed to be possible to run a mail server on a private network and
have it receive Internet email.  How though is this server made visible in
such a manner that the mail from and to the Internet is properly screened
and addressed to look like it came from the gateway box?  Do I want this hub
to remain invisible and set up another MTA on the gateway to send  mail to
it.  Would the gateway be a RELAY?

So far I have the PLUG user in a group parlor which has a quota but I am
uncertain how to test that the quota works.  Maybe I should create a
directory with a 1 meg quota and try to copy a 10 meg file into it.  The
following is an excerpt off the mail hub where I am trying to implement
quotas:

[root at goose admin]# repquota -a
                        Block limits               File limits
User            used    soft    hard  grace    used  soft  hard  grace
root      --       0       0       0              4     0     0
admin     --   59628       0       0             24500000     0
bedroom1  --    8312       0       0             191000000     0
bedroom2  --      20       0       0              5500000     0
bedroom3  --      36       0       0              91000000     0
den       --    3208       0       0             211000000     0
parlor    --      56       0       0             141000000     0
kitchen   --      20       0       0              51000000     0

I could use a variation on the repquota -a command to cause the output
fields to be seperated better.  The soft and used fields usually run
together making it hard to see the numbers.  The PLUG user  is under the
parlor group.

I am following the example for setting up sendmail in Securing and
Optimizing Redhat Linux v1.3 Final by Gerhard Mourani almost verbatim which
is available at www.openna.com.

Message-ID: <20020330192446.93887.qmail@web10905.mail.yahoo.com>

Greetings all:

I am volunteering on a non-profit project to convert
video streams from NTSC to PAL then encode to MPEG1
format to produce VCD's.

Well, I have about 3 days worth of education on this
topic so all help would be appreciated.  So, much
learning is required, I know...

I have been recommended Windows software like Procoder
to do the conversion.  If any of you are familiar with
this process I am sure that you know it is very
processor intensive.

Personally, I think there has to be a better solution
using a much more stable OS platform like Linux.

I have searched Google and Sourceforge but not found
too much yet.

Have any of you done similar projects or are involved
in this field?  

If there is software we need to buy, we would be
willing to buy it if the price is reasonable for our
limited budget.

The end product needs to be of professional quality,
recommendation from others is much appreciated.

Thanks,

Lynn

Subject: [PLUG] Why Do Fonts Look Bad in Linux?

I have a couple of questions.  I don't know a lot about this stuff
so I'm just trying to learn.  My questions are interspersed below.
I'm trying to learn some of this stuff now so my questions are probably
somewhat na?f.

 :: If you are using X 4.x then using truetype fonts is much simpler :
 :: 
 :: Section "Files"
 :: # breaks rxvt & gnumeric !?
 :: #  FontPath   "unix/:7100"

Why do you comment out the previous line (which, I take it, allows
use of the font server).  Wouldn't "the right way" to do this be to
put the following refs in the font server config file and then use
the server?  Or is there an advantage to this?

 ::   FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc:unscaled"
 ::   FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi:unscaled"
 ::   FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi:unscaled"
 ::   FontPath   "/usr/share/fonts/truetype"

Why do you not use "freetype" fonts here?  Are there advantages
to using "true" truetype?  Also I've read refs  to a "truetype font server"
(maybe it was "freetype server").   Is this different than xfs?  Does
one need two servers running in X to get the normal X fonts and truetype
as well.

 ::   FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo"
 ::   FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1"
 :: EndSection
 :: 
 :: Section "Module"
 ::         Load  "record"
 ::         Load  "extmod"
 ::         Load  "dbe"
 ::         Load  "dri"
 ::         Load  "glx"
 ::         Load  "xie"
 ::         Load "speedo"
 ::         Load "type1"
 ::         Load "freetype"

Ok, I see a "freetype" extension here.  How is this related to
the "truetype" inclusion above?

 :: EndSection
 :: 
 :: However getting the truetype fonts directories set-up is a bit of pain.
 :: 
 :: Create a directory to hold them, I use :
 :: 
 ::   /usr/share/fonts/truetype
 :: 
 :: Then do the font size generation thing :
 :: 
 ::   mkfontdir  something something something....
 :: 
 :: 
 :: Sorry but I can't remember the magic words
 :: 
 :: Then create a link from fonts.scale to fonts.dir
 :: 
 :: -rw-r--r--    1 root     root         7436 Feb  4 11:51 fonts.dir
 :: lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            9 Feb  4 14:01 fonts.scale -> fonts.dir

This is above my head.  Can you elaborate on what these different files
do?  Or, better, is there a good (single) doc that I can read on-line?
I don't want to ply through 10 docs for bits and pieces, however, unless
there is no other way!

Fonts have always been a big mystery to me.

Thanks.

Dean

The NOC is the Network Operations Center. They monitor lots of stuff.

The NOC themselves may not be looking at packets, but when you have 5 
different major network providers all peering in one location, it doesn't 
take a whole lot of effort to sniff a lot of traffic.

Only if the other end supports sftp. I suggest trying it, and complain to 
the sysadmin if it doesn't work.

As far as what's worth protecting, if you are responsible for the content, 
then I'd think it would be worth protecting. :)

Lynn,

On my agenda is to find some decent GPL tools for Linux, though it has 
been set aside in favor of much more pressing priorities like ENJOYING 
SPRING BREAK WITH MY FAMILY :)

http://software.linux.com/browse/387/?topic=387 - found some tools here, 
but I have yet to muck around with them.

Virtualdub is an excellent popular GPL video editing app - ironically 
unfortunately for Windows.    The author is reportedly working on a 
linux version, others can voice their support, possibly help by 
contacting him.  Out of respect for him (and true, pure hatred for 
spammers) I will paste this from his contact page at www.virtualdub.org :

"Send emails to <phaeron at virtualdub dot org>.  (The link has been 
scrambled to foil email harvesters.)"

I would really like to see some of these tools which allow a person to 
RESUME where they left off in the event of a power failure.

Divx5 is out for Linux now too :)

Details escape my memory, but I recall hearing on TechTV that movie 
producers are eyeing the Linux platform for the high resultion rendering 
requirements of CGI movies - so maybe we'll see some more tools showing 
up soon.

O'Reillys book, 'Bind'
covers just about everything that has to do with Bind.

when i need a question answered, i even go over to Ask Mr. DNS
http://www.acmebw.com/askmrdns/

the combination of the above 2 is a winner. :-)

"Titanic" was too. But I think most of Linux involvement was not in the actual creation, but in the rendering/mathematics of it all...number crunching. Though I know "LoTR" was done with Linux, too...maybe even some actual drawing/work, but I'm not sure on that.
Most of the  software the cgi teams needed they wrote in house and it remains that, 'in house' :(

That explains it.

So it sounds like telcos use equipment to route & manage voice (and data)
traffic using computers that run UNIX-like operating systems?  If so, would
such "computers" be the big routers & switches built by the Ciscos of the
world?  I'm wondering because I had heard that such routers run a
UNIX-like OS that Cisco developed.

The main point that IPSs don't get is that if you can only upload/maintain 
your website using plaintext passwords, a compromise yields a shell account 
on their server.  Pacifier offers web-based email (although I've never 
gotten it to work), but the web interface is unencrypted and requires your 
shell account password.  I told them how stupid this is, they don't care.

To their credit, ssh/sftp is supported.

Cisco routers run IOS a command line proprietary OS that is specific for 
cisco routers.  It is very good OS design and is emulated in all sorts of 
other network devices by other manufacturers.

Good point.  Our telephone service is by far the best in the world - as 
anyone who tries to network with dialup modems abroad may know. 
 Although I certainly can't say the same for USWest policies and 
customer services (let's not get started), the actual nuts and bolts 
works pretty much flawlessly.

It will be interesting to see what comes of the "Telco distro"

As if they had an unlimited number of feet to shoot.

There was a great tv documentary about Netscape when they open-sourced. 
One scene had a Netscape beta hacker being interviewed for a job for the 
Linux branch.  The interviewer asked why he wanted to work for them and he 
said something like "To make Netscape under Linux kick-ass over Microsoft". 
  The interviewer laughed and hired the *kid* on the spot.  If I remember 
he was 15 or 16, his mom drove him to the interview.

Right , allows the use of the fontserver xfstt or similar.  Font

So the idea is that you DON'T run a separate font server, X takes care of it.

Freetype or truetype doesn't matter.

Do I can't. I only know the mechanics of making it work which is
pretty much what I described.  You need to download the font files,
for truetype that's from m$, and then run the magic command.  The font
directory and size files are needed by X to access the files.

  Dean> Fonts have always been a big mystery to me.

Well that's kind of the problem under Linux, is that it's still a mystery.
It's a little easier with X 4.x but you still have to dig around.

  Well! It's about time that age discrimination affected those younger than
40. :-)

P.S. It's too bad that Apple has the idea that one cannot be a productive
contributor at the age of 15. Age, by itself, is not an indicator of ability
or quality.

The problem is described fairly well in the article.

He's contributing to a project and can later decide that he wants the
software he contributed to be proprietary and under his control.

That'd be Real Bad for Darwin.

I just envisioned Microsoft or somebody paying off a bunch of young
hackers to contribute to GPL projects and then rescind their commitment
and claim proprietary ownership of important chunks of Free Software after
it's become widespread.

What a headache.

I'm not sure about Cisco's IOS, but I've heard that Juniper's JunOS is/was

Oh- you are SO wrong for implying that ageism is always bad for "older" 
folk (with all due respect, of course ;) )

I graduated from college in '93.  At every job I have had since then, 
older folks with more "experience" had in some cases 50% (yes, that's 
FIFTY PERCENT) more pay for the SAME DUTIES and WORKLOAD as the more 
junior (me) techs pulling work from the SAME pile.

Perhaps it has just been my bad luck, but so far I have not been in an 
job environment where actual individual output and performance was 
gauged or rewarded at anywhere near the extent as career length is 
regarded.  I'm talking about indiviudal rubber-meets-the-road daily 
productivity & knowledge base here.

It would be understandable, of course, if the "veterans" were in some 
sort of mentoring or even lead tech position and in some way leading 
the junior techs with accumulated experience.  But the fact of the 
matter is, the junior techs (read: not yet burned out) are usually far 
in the lead in terms of knowledge base about current technologies due 
to self-study, vendor training, and simple curiosity/yearning to learn.

Not to mention the fact that everyone who seemed to begin their career 
prior to 1990 is looking forward to a pension of some sort.  Sure, 
nowadays we are offered 401k with (if lucky) some miniscule matching 
company contributions.  But with the market tanking this hard who has 
the guts to throw more good money in after bad?

But nevermind me.  I am sure that everyone gets the shaft no matter how 
you look at it.  I pipe up only because in response to Rich's comment 
above, in my experience have not seen any discrimination because 
someone was "too old".

Indeed, a highly modified FreeBSD variant.  Junipers rock, I might 
add.  From their CLI you can "start shell" and there you are, at a BSD 
prompt with everything you'd expect.  You could, for example, run a web 
server or ftp from it on the 6GB hard drive...;)  not that you'd want 
to, but could.  It is worth noting that J doesn't charge extra for SSH 
access, as brand C does.  Not to mention that you can purportedly add a 
180,000 line access list to an Juniper OC192 interface and still 
achieve 95% of line rate IP switching performance ;)

I like Cisco, but the lowest Juniper (M5) can run circles around all 
but Cisco's top gear.

As for your question about using a mail server on a private ip address, 
you just need to set up port forwarding for smtp and pop3/imap.  If your 
firewall is based in a 2.2.x kernel you would use commands like

ipmasqadm portfw -f
ipmasqadm portfw -a -P tcp -L (yer external ip here) 25 -R (yer internal 
private ip here) 25

This will forward ALL the port 25 stuff coming into the external interface 
to the machine you designate by the second, private, ip.  Then you gotta 
do the same for port 110 for pop3 and whatever port imap uses.  

The problem is most 2.2 kernels don't have portfw enabled, so you'll 
probably have to roll yer own.  2.4 kernels are supposed to be more likely 
to have portforwarding compiled in by default, but I don't have experience 
using them as a firewall yet.  

Best thing is to go to the ip masq how to at www.linuxdoc.org, which is 
where I always go when I have to figure out how to do anything with ip 
masq.  The BSDs also do port forwarding, and some would argue that they 
are more secure.  Not me, cause I haven't played with them yet.

PS--If you want to subscribe just one email account to PLUG but want 
everybody at your office to get the mail, why not just create a list in 
your /etc/aliases file (I assume postfix has an aliases file, or something 
like Sendmail's aliases file), then subscribe the list you made to PLUG.  
That way all the plug stuff will go out to all the 
accounts that are members of your list.  DON'T make PLUG a member of your 
list--that would send all traffic on your list to PLUG including (I 
think) spamming the list back with everything that it sent out, making you 
the most unpopular linux user in Portland.  I'm not sure what to do about 
posting to the PLUG list--there's probably an elegant solution I just 
don't know about.  

There is probably a more elegant way to do the whole receiving thing list 
messages thing, but this should work.

Well, first I'd like to say that blind acceptance of the doctrine of
"profits by any means necessary" or even "corporations cannot be blamed
for doing the most profitable thing regardless of other effects" is worse
than naive, it's sociopathic.

Second, I think one could just as easily make the argument that Apple was
protecting the its ability to meet a commitment to the public that Darwin
would remain somewhat "open source".

I'd be very interested to hear Stallman's view on minors who have
contributed to truly Free software projects.

It's actually a scary situation that I hadn't yet considered.

I believe it came up a year or two ago when Corel was developing
their Debian-based distribution and the license agreement
specifically required age 18 and older.  It seems, however, that
the matter could be handled simply by requiring a parent to sign
the contract in addition to the minor; I don't recall why or if
this was not acceptable.

Message-ID: <gtvd4c.26i@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

I put Red Hat 7.2 on my Dell 4100.

After over 20 hours and 200 MB of downloads, my dial-up connection failed 
and Red Hat Update Agent locked up.  I was using the up2date command.

Now when I run up2date it lists everything I had already downloaded. There 
is no way I am going to do this download again.  

Is there a way to install my downloads or are they lost?

I thought up2date was smart enough to know that if downloaded files before.
I don't think it downloads the updates it already has.

I agree with Ken.  In my experience, up2date will realize, after you 
pick the files to update for the 2nd or whatever time, that the 
packages already reside on the system (/var/spool/up2date, I think).
Check this directory first, and then run up2date again.  I think you'll 
see that it smartly skips retrieving the already-downloaded packages.

Well, actually it's got those RPMs stored in it's download directory 
(/var/spool/up2date or something like that) and when you continue your 
up2date session it'll just tell you x-ray-6.0.2-i386.rpm already 
downloaded and skip onto the next one.  Unless of course RedHat changes 
their errata and wants you to download a different rpm.  But you should be good 
to go without redownloading anything.

Thanks Bill,

I found that directory and copied it for safe keeping.

I'll start the up2date command later, as I need to do something other than 
updates for a while.

Subject: [PLUG] rpmdrake question..
Message-ID: <1017641458.14290.98.camel@obelisk.spek.org>

Hello,
  I just installed Mandrake 8.2 on my laptop (nice install BTW, since I
have no CD rom on it (it's a mini-laptop) I used the single floppy
network install, Everything Just Worked(tm)).  I've been trying add ftp
and http sources to rpmdrake's list of available sources and have had no
luck doing so - it never seems to accept my entries, no combinations of
urls and relative paths to hdlist.cz will work, it always fails with a
dialog box with the message "An error occured when adding this source.",
and I can't seem to get a more descriptive error.

Have any of the Mandrake users out there encountered this and gotten
rpmdrake to accept more sources?  Or know how to get rpmdrake to show
more errors?

thanks for any hints,
Brent

These numbers sound a tad off.  Business call-routing goes down more
than you might think.  I worked for a company where call routing went
down a few hours for a couple weeks within 6 months.  This was due to
provider switch misconfiguration.  One time, the LEC even decided to
just randomly change our signaling from ESI to AMI on a provisioned,
live, production circuit.  sheez.

I was also part of building a CLEC, and to obtain cost savings, and run
voice services over DSL (non-ip, ATM based), we used a soft-switch from
EON which was actually Linux based (this is Telco-class equipment BTW). A
lot of other soft-switch providers use hardware combined with Sun
servers.

I do know that any outages or service interruptions on the voice side
required we report it to the PUC, and that we have 8 hours of battery
backup to provide POTS service to end-users to maintain E911 services
during a power outage.  

SLA's for circuits are harder than SLA's for hardware (easier to have
five 9's uptime for a fully redundant 5ESS phone switch than an OC-3
circuit).

I always thought part of the GPL's appeal was that once a work had been
released under it, the license couldn't be rescinded at a later date
(returning the work to a proprietary state). Was I mistaken?
