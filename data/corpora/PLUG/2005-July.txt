I have experience calling them frequently.  If you
have any issues(multiple activations usually), I
usually tell them their OS is a piece o crap and
crashed again needing reinstall.  They usually dont
push beyond that.

One of my computers has been crashing unexpectedly on
occasion. I ran Memtest86, and there are some errors,
though they did not show up on the first pass.

Removal of RAM is the traditional way to correct such
errors. However, I understand that when all such
errors occur within a rather small range of addresses,
as in this case, Linux can be instructed not to use
these addresses. Can anyone refer me to sources of

Message-ID: <42C68B3A.21290.94FC685@localhost>

OK, I scheduled this weekend for some free time to see if I could 
get my shiny new iPod working with my Ubuntu 5.04 computer. 
After googling for hours and installing grip and gtkpod, I've made 
some progress, but remain confused about most of it.

I managed to rip a Stravinsky CD from my collection. Grip did a 
nice job -- there are 25 tracks in .ogg format in 
/home/jjj/mp3/stravinsky_igor/firebird. If I right-click on any of them I 
am presented with the option to play them with Music Player 
(Ubuntu default) or Realplayer. They play fine through the computer 
with Music Player, but I have not gotten Realplayer installed 
properly. (I think it is a 32-bit vs 64-bit issue, but I'll deal with that 
later.)

Where I am falling down is getting the tracks into the iPod. When I 
plug it into a USB port Ubuntu pops up a folder window and 
appears to be able to read the filesystem. (This iPod has never 
been plugged into a Windows or Mac computer, and has never 
been near iTunes, which I have never installed on anything.)

Evidently gtkpod is the application that is supposed to transfer the 
tracks to the iPod. But I'll be danged if I can get it to do so. 
Clicking on Help does nothing because the person who wrote 
gtkpod evidently never got around to creating a Help document, nor 
does Google find any instructions. Looking at the gtkpod window, 
nothing is obvious. There is a button labeled "Dirs" and when I click 
on it I can browse to the folder where it sees the ogg files. I select 
one and click on "Add recursively" (whatever "recursively" means) 
and it says "processing" for a moment, then nothing. The ogg file 
does not appear in the gtkpod window. 

I also tried just dragging one of the ogg files to a folder in the iPod 
window. I'm pretty sure that is not the way to do it, because from 
my reading there is a database file on the iPod that must be 
updated. But I tried it anyway, just for kicks. Ubuntu popped up a 
box that said I did not have permission to write to the iPod.

I think I'm missing something that is so basic that no one ever 
wrote it down in any of the wikis and how-tos I have read. Like 
"before you can use the computer you must turn it on." OK, maybe 
not quite that basic. :(

Part of my confusion is that I have never used an iPod on a 
Windows or Mac, so I don't know how it's supposed to work in the 
first place. And the little instruction manual that Apple included 
with the iPod just refers to iTunes. 

This would probably be easier if I were a teenager. :)

Does anyone have any idea what I might be missing here?

This posting went to the ends of the issue.  To sum up:

Use a package called gtkpod.  It's a GTK gui app for managing tunes on
the ipod.  Use FAT32 formatting on the ipod for now because there's no
fsck utility for HFS+ at this time, though you can hack the HFS+ driver
a bit to work around that.  It's all in the OSX Middleware thread.

As far as I know, no ipods will play .ogg files.  They either have to
be in mp3 or apple's format (a3c/a4c?).  gtkpod is probably running
under this assumption also, and isn't acting on .ogg files.

AFAIK, the iPod doesn't play Oggs--you'll need to encode to MP3s
instead.

I do have gtkpod installed and it runs fine. I just can't get the ogg 
files into the window where they can be selected for installation on 
the iPod. As for the ogg files, I think I read somewhere that gtkpod 
converts the ogg files to mp3s during the transfer to the iPod. If so, 
it doesn't make any sense that it won't allow them into its browser 
window. 

As for the filesystem, from my reading, evidently the iPod comes 
formatted with HFS, which is (?) an Apple filesystem type. If the 
user installs iTunes on a Windows machine, the first time the user 
plugs the iPod into the USB port on the Windows machine iTunes 
senses it, senses that the filesystem is HFS, and automagically 
coverts it to FAT32, preserving the preconfigured data in the 
process. Or maybe it copies the files off to a temp folder, formats 
the whole disk with FAT32, then restores the files. One way or the 
other, the Windows user ends up with a FAT32 iPod.

It seems to me that somewhere I read that there is a Linux tool to 
convert HFS to FAT32, but I don't remember where I got that from. 
I'd prefer not to install iTunes on my Windows computer just so I 
can convert the filesystm. Not only do I not like installing stuff on 
my Windows computer that has the potential to screw something 
up, but I am trying to be a Linux purist here. It's the only way I will 
learn Linux.

But one thing does make sense, now that I think about it. The error 
message when I tried to drag the ogg file to the iPod that said I 
didn't have permission to write to the folder may have had 
something to do with the HFS filesystem. Maybe it's like NTFS -- 
Linux can read it (hence no problem displaying the contents of the 
iPod), but can't write to it. The "permissions" error message may 
have just been a generic error message. OK, that's my currrent 
theory. :)

Thanks for the suggestions. :)

If you dig deep into the OSX Middleware thread, you'll find a patch for
teh HFS+ friver in the 2.6 kernel.  That would allow you to keep the
HFS+ filesystem when using linux.  It disables the disk checking mount
count, basically.

You sure Windows saves the mp3 files off, then reformats, then puts the
files back on?  I thought it simply overwrote the ipod with a FAT32
filesystem and then wrote the os image anew.  How can Windows read the
files without understanding the filesystem?  That's what I'd like to
know.

You cannot use ogg files, as was mentioned.  You must use mp3 files that
have the proper id3 tags.  The ipod will not use the actual filenames.
It will only use the info in the id3 tags.

John,

   One of the more recent issues of Linux Journal has an article on iPods on
linux.

OK, I launched Synaptic and searched on "HFS." That got me nine 
possibilities to install. Some were clearly the wrong thing, but one 
(hfsplus) was described as "tools to access HFS+ formatted 
volumes." I marked it for installation, which prompted Synaptic to 
add libhfsp0, described as "shared library to access HFS+ 
formatted volumes." Unfortunately, after installing them I still can't 
write to the iPod. 

However, I did just discover that I can read and copy from it. I never 
tried that before, so I don't know if the tools I just installed made it 
possible. All I know is that I copied the three folders (Contacts, 
Calendars, iPod_Control and Notes) into my /home directory. 
Nevertheless, there are three files listed (.Trashes, ,Journal and 
.jpurnal_info_block) that I cannot copy. All three have an X in the 
file icon. When I try to copy them I get the "permissions" error 
message.

Actually, I don't give a rat's patootie if the iPod retains HFS or is 
converted to FAT32. I just want something I can read and write to, 
and I don't want to destroy the system Apple installed to enable 
me to play the tracks from the menu.

Maybe Windows doesn't understand it, but iTunes does. I have no 
idea what I'm talking about. You're probably right. More likely 
iTunes installs the correct files on the Windows computer, formats 
the iPod as FAT32 -- wiping everything out -- then transfers the files 
to it.

Somewhere I know I read that one of these utilities (gtkpod, I think) 
converts the ogg files to mp3s as it transfers them to the iPod.

But perhaps that is not correct. I put the Stravinksy CD back in the 
drive and decided to re-rip it. This time I went into Config in grip and 
found a number of options --

bladeenc
lame
l3enc
xingmp3enc
gogo
oggenc

It was set on oggenc, so I switched it to mp3encode. When I did 
the "encode file extension" box changed from ogg to mp3. "Cool," I 
thought, and proceeded to start the rip process. But when I tried to 
start it I got an error message "invalid encoder executable, Check 
your encoder config." Looking at the encoder config there are a 
bazillion settings that can be changed. And I don't know what any 
of them mean. :(

So for the moment I'm stymied. Wish grip had a help file to explain 
the settings.

There was a way to do it, but it was a hack and not standard.

If memory is failing, replace it.  Other areas will start to go bad in
many cases.

grip is just a front-end for command-line mp3 (ogg, etc) encoders.  The 
list you see is the various encoders it knows how to talk to, so you 
should pick one and then make sure it's installed.  Lame is pretty 
common I think.

There's one more variable to this equation.  The kernel needs support
for the filesystem.  Userland programs are not enough.  You may want to
fire up "make menuconfig" and browse your kernel's filesystem settings.
If HFS+ is there, but compiled as a module, you'll need to modprobe it
or add it to /etc/modules.

But I really think it's best to just use FAT32 for simplicity's sake.
You won't lose the ipod OS if you follow the instructions in this
writeup:

http://pag.csail.mit.edu/~adonovan/hacks/ipod.html

There's a step where you dd the OS into a file, and then dd it back
after the reformat.  Scary, but it works fine.

Aaah! That makes things a lot clearer.

But at first I was still stuck. I went back into the grip Config tab and 
tried each one (of the above list) in turn. The only one that did not 
give me the error message was oggenc. 

But based on what you said, I went into Synaptic and searched on 
each one. The only one I found was lame. It was not installed, so I 
installed it. Then I went back into the Config tab and set it to lame. 
But when I tried to rip I still got the same error message -- i.e., it 
couldn't find lame.

And then I discovered the whole problem. It seems right above the 
box where you enter the ripper it says "enter whole path." Duh! So I 
searched and found that lame was in /usr/bin/. After entering that it 
rips to perfect mp3s!

Making progress!

Then I went into gtkpod and tried to add the newly created mp3s. 
Again, success! I guess it really doesn't want to have anything to 
do with those oggs.

So finally, with the 25 tracks as mp3s in the gtkpod list I fumbled 
around trying to figure out how to add them to the iPod. I'm pretty 
sure the button is the one that says "Sync."

But that's as far as I got. When I clicked on Sync I got an error 
message -- "iPod directory structure must be present before 
synching to the iPod can be performed."

So I guess that means it can't write to the HFS+ file system. From 
what I gather I can fix that problem if I load iTunes on my Windows 
2000 computer and plug the iPod into it. But I really don't want to 
do that if I can find a pure Linux way of doing it. So for my next 
adventure I'm off to google for Linux-based HFS+ to FAT32 
filesystem conversion utilities.

Thanks for the tip about the encoders. I'm almost done!

I went through all of this a couple of months ago with Debian unstable.

I'll try to point you in the right direction and tell you what I did as 
well.

Be specific with your questions and I can probably make this work.

Hell, if you want me to come by and help, I can do that, too, so long as 
you don't live in BFE (read: the 'burbs or worse).

OK, if you want to go that route, then go ahead.  You'll need kernel 
support for HFS as well as adding the ability to read Apple hard disk 
partitions.

[This might be irrelevant -- read ahead before acting]
However, I think that's a mistake.  Microsoft does a good job of making 
its stuff "standard" by not supporting any thing else.  So if you want to 
be compatible, you gotta do it their way.

For an ipod, you're probably going to want to reformat the thing VFAT. 
The reason to do this is simple:  If you EVER want to use the ipod as a 
portable hard disk, you might want to put the data on a Windows PC or even 
a Linux box that doesn't have all the special Apple stuff installed.  Odds 
are pretty good it has support for Winders filesystems, so if you go that 
route, you're more universally adapted.

To do this, you need to actually use a Windows machine (I don't know of 
any other way) and install the "ipod updater" from support.apple.com.  It 
will put the latest OS on the ipod and transparently reformat the disk 
VFAT.

This should take half the headache out of connecting the ipod to your 
Ubuntu machine, also.
[End of probably irrelevant section -- seems this has been done]

Likely, connecting the system to iTunes on Windows ran the updater or 
something similar and already converted it to VFAT.

Who mounted the filesystem and with what permissions?

We'll get to doing that automatically in a second.

Changing the thing to VFAT doesn't lose you any functionality whatsoever.

That's exactly what it does.

A word of warning, gtkpod's database is a little sensitive.  I've had 
weird little problems using both gtkpod and iTunes (iTunes on other 
people's computers, of course).  The data gets munged and I have to do a 
whole lot of manual moving around in order to restore the database when I 
want to syncronize my ipod with my desktop.  Basically, I every time I 
connect my ipod to a non-gtkpod system, I have to wipe all my files on the 
ipod and put them back again.  It's a pain, but I just do it before bed 
and it's fine.

If you want to know whether or not this was done, when the ipod is 
connected to your Linux system and you can read the filesystem, type 
"mount" at a command prompt and find the ipod listing.  It might be 
"/dev/ipod" or maybe "/dev/sda3" or something... anyway, it'll be mounted 
in the place where you read the ipod files.  See what is listed under 
"type".  That'll tell you immediately.

I suppose that's possible, but it's a needless step.  If you're resigning 
yourself to using MP3 at all (as you must on the ipod), then go ahead and 
just rip 'em as MP3.

Make sure you actually have the encoder installed.

For Debian, I use the rarewares, xmixahlx, and Marillat's archive for 
multimedia stuff:

deb http://rarewares.org/debian/packages/unstable/ ./
deb http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/debian sid main
deb http://debian.xmixahlx.com/packages/unstable/ ./

If you care to use these, you might want some entries in /etc/apt/apt.conf 
to clear up possible collisions.  I'll share that with anybody who's 
interested.

grip DOES have fairly extensive help files.  They're HTML pages and, at 
least on my system, they're accessible from the Help menu.

Now, the real trick for getting the ipod to do things perfectly on my 
system was the creation of /dev/ipod and point it in the right place. 
This was done with udev and autofs.  If you need help with that part, let 
me know.

If gtkpod can "sync" with the ipod and doesn't give any errors when 
writing the appropriate filesystem to the ipod, you're probably in good 
shape.

I also have to "eject" my ipod after each use in order to get the SCSI 
subsystem to release the thing and take the ipod out of drive mode.

Nope!  There's actually a menu option under "File" in gtkpod to create the 
directory structure gtkpod uses.  Just do that!

You don't need all of iTunes, just the ipod updater.  It's available as a 
standalone and should be installed that way to ensure you're getting the 
latest firmware for your ipod.

Um, no.  Part of the ipod software is on the filesystem and part is in 
firmware.  If you go the hand-conversion route, you could seriously fuck 
things up.

I think it's already VFAT.  Check that first.  If not, use the ipod 
updater on Windows.

I just tried that. Error message: "Problem creating iPod directories 
in /media/iPod/."

>From what I read on the site Carlos just sent me to, I should 
already have support for HFS+. My kernel is 2.6.10-5.

So now I'm wondering if that "you don't have permission" error 
message was for real, not just a generic message for a write 
failure. I am logged in as jjj, not as root.

I just tried to chmod the iPod, but I have forgotten the chmod 
syntax. I tried sudo chmod *.* jjj. Wrong, eh? Hey, when you're a 
beginner you have to guess a lot! :(

I also just tried "modprobe hfsplus." It seemed to take -- no error 
messages, anyway. But still can't write to the iPod.

I'm pretty sure it's not FAT32. I think I read that current iPods all 
ship with HFS+ and when the user first plugs it into a Windows 
computer, iTunes sees it and immediately converts it to FAT32. 
This makes sense, considering that the Apple documentation 
stresses emphatically that you must install the iTunes software 
BEFORE you first plug it into a Windows computer. Since it has 
never been plugged into a Windows computer and the iTunes CD is 
still in it's sealed sleeve, it must be still HFS+.

OK, I just determined that it's mounted. It's at /media/iPod/. How 
do I determine for sure what filesystem it has? I tried "fsck iPod," 
but just got a list of fsck options. Another thing I didn't do right. :(

mount should tell you that

  mount

or (to see just the ipod)

  mount | grep iPod

You should see something like:
<device> on <mountpoint> type <type> (<mountopts>)

<mountopts> had better be rw

Don't guess.  You can really hose things doing that.  It's best if you 
learn to read the manpages and info docs.  Also, apropos is a good 
place to start if you're trying to figure out what does what.

I've always found it amusing that you have to tell the shell that you're 
--help | less when you're a newbie :-)

  <command> --help | less

Some commands don't dump their help on stdout, in which case you have to 
redirect the stderr to read the whole message.

  <command> --help 2>&1 | less

But of course with most modern terminals, you can just use Shift+PgUp/ 
Shift+PgDn to scroll through the history.

Some programs (like the interpreter for something that ends in "ython") 
will unhelpfully tell you that --help doesn't work and you have to use 
a -h switch.  Others will just rudely create files named ./--help.  
Sorry to sprinkle so many caveats about, but at least most of the core 
utilities are well-behaved.

Yep, it is. It says:

/dev/sda3 on /media/iPod type hfsplus 
(rw,nosuid,nodev,uid=1000,gid=1000)

And when I did modprobe hfsplus I didn't get any error messages. 
So I must have HFS+ support.

So it must be a permissions thing. Back to researching chmod 
syntax. :)

Sure.  But I still recommend making the thing VFAT for the aforementioned 
portability issues.  It's really nice to use your ipod as a portable file 
storage device.

Nope.  You need to research modifying your automounter to set the 
permissions properly when it attaches the device.

You probably just need to add a "user" option to the entry in 
/etc/auto.removable (or /etc/auto.something).

I have an alternative idea that I want to ask about. Plus searching 
for this stuff brought up something else I've been needing to fix.

OK, this sounds like sensible advice. I started by looking through 
/etc, but I didn't see anything that looked likely to be this file. Then 
I did a search of the whole filesystem for *auto*.*. That brought up 
122 files, but none looked like it. I also searched for *mount*.*, 
which turned up hundreds of files. But again, nothing looked likely. 
Then I decided I'd just hit Help or Google, but I don't know what I'm 
really looking for. And the Help files included with Ubuntu 5.04 are 
not very complete, and pretty lame when it comes to searching. So 
I guess I need a little more direction here.

Now, as to the other issue -- using the iPod as a removable 
storage device. While searching for the "auto" file I ran into 
hosts.deny and hosts.accept. That reminded me that there is a 
problem wrt to the Windows computer. To clarify, I have a Windows 
2000 desktop plus the Linux laptop. Both are on home ethernet (as 
are my Laserjets). No wireless at home. The desktop is Devil4 and 
the Linux laptop is Devil5.

The laptop has no problem seeing and accessing the two shares I 
created on the Windows computer. It prompts for my password on 
the Windows computer, and then I can move, delete, write, etc. 
anything I want on those shares. 

But going the other direction isn't working. The Windows computer 
sees Devil5, but when I click on it to see the share I created on it 
(/home) I get a prompt for the password to get into Devil5. The box 
has an entry for username and another for the password, but no 
matter what I put in them I can't get in. This has been something 
I've been meaning to fix for some time, but I put it on the back 
burner for the time being. As long as the Linux computer can get to 
the Windows shares I can just do everything from the Linux 
computer. But it would be nice to figure out why the Linux laptop is 
refusing to accept my username and password from the Windows 
computer.

The other issue is something I have never tried to do before. Now 
that I have a laptop and will be using it from other locations, I have 
been thinking about remote login to the Windows computer at 
home. The Windows desktop is on 24/7 and is connected by cable 
and router. I know Windows has a remote login feature, but I have 
never bothered to figure it out. I just left it turned off and ignored it. 
What I am thinking is that this would be way better than trying to 
use the iPod as a removable file storage device. If I can log into my 
desktop from the university I can just move files back and forth as I 
need to. Plus it would be handy when I forget and leave a 
homework file on the Windows computer that I need at school. I'd 
rather work on getting remote login going than worry about 
converting the iPod to VFAT. Besides, from what I understand, 
VFAT is still basically FAT, subject to corruption and stuff. Then 
again, I don't know how good a file system HFS+ is. But just the 
fact that it was not created by Microsoft means it has to be better 
right? :)

Another reason for leaving the iPod as HFS+ is that I am way less 
likely to muck it up. 

So, after considering everything, I think I would prefer to leave it 
HFS+. Now I just need to figure out which file is the automounter 
permissions file and how to modify it.

In re-reading:

I discovered the following:

-----
Eric also provided the following tip for mounting his HFS+ iPod in 
read/write mode:

    I had been having a hell of a time getting HFS+ to mount 
read/write. Mounting via "mount -t hfsplus " only let me mount read-
only (useless for then attempting to place files on your iPod). After 
some thrashing about, and trying to deal with the spurious 
message that appeared in /var/log/kern.log about hfs+ not having 
been unmounted cleanly, I happened upon the command 
"hpmount" which works just like regular mount except it is for 
hfsplus filesystems.

    Now I just use "hpmount /dev/sde3" (sde3 is my iPod) and I'm 
good to go.

    Mind you I'm a Debian (Sarge) user. YMMV for other distros.
-----

So I decided to give that a try. From a regular terminal, here is 
what happened:

jjj at Devil5:/$ hpmount /dev/sda3
*** Warning: You are about to open '/dev/sda3' for writing ***
*** Do you really want to do that? (y/n) ***
y
hpmount: /dev/sda3: error opening medium (Permission denied)
jjj at Devil5:/$ sudo hpmount /dev/sda3
*** Warning: You are about to open '/dev/sda3' for writing ***
*** Do you really want to do that? (y/n) ***
y
hpmount: /dev/sda3: no error (Success)

So then I went back to gtkpod and tried again. Still no success. 
Same error messages.

Remembering a trick, I closed gtkpod and then launched it from the 
terminal with "sudo gtkpod." When it came up I tried again. Still no 
luck.

Maybe someone has additional suggestions. But I know I'm almost 
there!

They still make fine Linux firewalls, NAT, DNS, etc, boxes.

Amen to that! Memory is cheap, your time is not! If your computer has
the maximum amount of RAM it can hold and it's failing, get a computer
that can hold more RAM. If it isn't maxed out, get rid of the failing
RAM and max it out with new RAM.

Try looking at your packages and documentation before your filesystem.

apt-cache search automount
apt-cache search mount | grep -i auto

(then look to see which of those packages is installed)

Also try apropos

  apropos mount

Some of the man pages actually tell you about configuration files (the 
ones in section 5.)  Sorry I don't know a more elegant way than this:

  apropos '' | grep '(5)'

Can root write to it?   (try touch-ing a file (man touch))

Did you show us the permissions?  ( ls -ld /media/iPod/ )  That would 
help.

Also see Jeme's note about "user".  Is it in /etc/fstab ?  Maybe you 
should just put it there.

What is your automounter?  (dpkg -l '*mount*' maybe tells you (also 
"ls /etc/init.d" might provide some insight since it presumably starts 
at boot.))

I tried man touch, but it just reinforced my low opinion of man 
pages. I did get an idea of what touch can do, but I could only read 
the first 22 pages of 65. That's because that's as far as it would 
scroll. At the bottom it said "22/65" End", highlighted. I tried every 
key combination I could think of to make it go further, but since it 
didn't give me the secret code, I just gave up and closed the 
terminal window. I guess when they wrote the man pages they 
assumed we were all born knowing what the key combination to 
scroll further is. :(

I did, but here it is again:

drwxr-xr-x   1  jjj jjj  10  2005-02-13 22:30  /media/iPod/

This I may have actually understood part of. :)

Opening fstab in gedit it says:

# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
[pretend the items below are tabbed -- I can't make it work in e-mail]
# <file system> <mount point> <type> <options> <dump> <pass>
proc /proc proc defaults 0 0
/dev/hda2 / ext3 defaults, errors=remount -ro 0
/dev/hda1 none swap sw 0 0
/dev/hdc /media/cdrom0 udf,iso9660 ro,user,noauto 0
/dev/sda /media/usb0 auto rw,user,noauto 0 0

I don't know what the proc line is all about, but I do know hda1 and 
hda2, because I created them when I installed Ubuntu. And 
/dev/hdc is pretty obvious. And I think I just learned something -- 
the "ro" and "rw" mean "read-only" and "read-write," correct? And 
in hda2 where it says "-ro" that means "not read-only"? And "user" 
means any user has full access?

It took me a moment, but I also figured out /dev/sda/media/usb0. 
At one time I had my external USB hard disk connected directly to 
this Linux laptop. At the time it was still FAT32, which is how 
Seagate shipped it. It is now NTFS and hanging on the Windows 
2000 computer, where it is going to stay. I created a share on the 
Windows 2000 computer and the Linux laptop reads and writes to 
it now through the share. Evidently once an entry is made in fstab 
it stays there, even if the drive goes away. But I think that line 
could be deleted, since I have no intention of putting it back on the 
laptop.

Reading about iPods and Linux, it appears Apple creates three 
partitions. Sda1 is just a few bytes long. Sda2 is a bit larger and is 
some kind of filesystem map. And sda3 is where all the rest of the 
stuff hangs. 

So (guessing ahead here), if I were to add a line that says 
something like:

/dev/sda3 /media/iPod auto? rw,usr,noauto? 0 0

I might solve the problem? (Except some of what I put in that line 
may be wrong [note question marks], or missing.) I'm scared to 
mess with it, lest I end up with a computer that can't find its 
filesystem.

dpkg -l "mount" gave me:

Desired=unknown/Install/Remove//Purge/Hold

Ls /etc/init.d gave a listing of lots of scripts. I noted five that might 
be of interest:

mountall.sh
mountnfs.sh
mountvirtfs.sh
umountfs.sh
umountnfs.sh

But I don't know if any of them is an "automounter."

Did you see my other note about trying hpmount? It appears to me 
that it worked and the iPod should now be read/write. However, 
while I have always been able to copy things off of it, I still can't 
write to it.

Actually that 22/65 means you were viewing lines 22 through 65 and (END)
means you're at the end of the man page.

Quick keys for man:

space or page down -> page down
page up -> page up
enter -> line down
up arrow -> line up
down arrow -> line down
left arrow -> scroll left
right arrow -> scroll right
end -> go to the end of the man page
home -> go to the beginning of the man page
q -> quit
/ -> search (/foo<enter> takes you to the first instance of foo.
/<enter> will then take you to the next instance of foo)

Uhhh... I'm not sure what other ones you might use... those pretty much
cover it for me.  :-)

Getting close.  You probably want an explicit type, though I bet you 
could get away with auto.  This should be the type that you get out of 
the mount command when it is mounted.

make that "user", not usr, and noauto means "don't do it at boot", which 
is probably correct.  Now check "man fstab"

/dev/sda3 /media/iPod auto rw,user,noauto 0 0

I'm not sure about your automounter.  You may need to disable it.  In 
any case, once you have a listing in fstab, all you have to do is 
"mount /media/iPod" and "umount /media/iPod" (make sure you umount 
before you unplug it (that flushes everything that's hanging around in 
ram pretending to have been written to disk to the actual disk so that 
it goes with you when you unplug it.))

Uh oh. It may be hosed. FAT32 may be on the horizon. :(

Here is what I did:

1) Removed the USB drive line from fstab and added the line for the 
iPod. Saved it.

2) Tried to add tracks via gtkpod. Still no go. (Didn't expect it to 
without remounting, but worth a try.)

3) I had already read about the necessity of unmounting before 
unplugging, so I did just as you said -- umount /media/iPod. The 
process went OK and no error messages.

4) Unplugged the iPod from the USB.

5) Plugged it back in. I have a folder in the panel to view it, so I 
launched to folder. It opened a window, which suddenly blinked and 
then displayed the fact that it was unable to view anything. While 
pondering this, suddenly the iPod came up. I guess USB takes a 
moment to initialize. Or maybe it was waiting on the HD in the iPod.

But first inkling of bad news. The window used to show:

Calendars
Contacts
Notes
iPod_Control
     Device (empty folder)
     Music
          20 empty folders here, labeled F00 - F19

Now it shows:

Desktop DB
Desktop DF
Finder
ReadMe
System

And in the browser window Nautilus has no idea what these are. 
They are displayed with the little Gnome icon, not a folder or a file 
icon. I tried to open the ReadMe in gedit, but no go.

Very strange. What happened to the other structure? Did I hose it 
when I unplugged it? No, from that site it said unplugging without 
first unmounting caused a corrupted file system. This is not 
corrupted. It is just completely different. I even took Nautilus all the 
way back to / and then forward to /media and then to /iPod, just to 
make sure I didn't accidentally end up in an adjacent folder.

So I decided to go into gtkpod and try to sync. Again, same error 
message that the file structure was not there (it has always said 
that). Couldn't write to the iPod. Then I tried File > Create iPod's 
directories. Same error message as before on this item -- "Problem 
creating directories."

Well, I'm learning stuff at least. Painfully perhaps. But those are 
the lessons that are always remembered. :)

Fresh out of ideas, other than to use the Windows computer and 
iTunes to go to FAT32.

No, that's probably your automounter seeing the new device and mounting 
it.  Do (as root) "tail -f /var/log/messages" while you plug it in and 
you might see what the automounter is doing (probably starts with 
something about hotplug sda<num> and etc.)

As for the directory structure looking different, what is in 
your /etc/fstab now?  (btw, you didn't really need to remove the usb 
line (but for the sake of simplicity, you could comment (start the line 
with #) it out.)

OK, that was interesting. Here is what happened when I plugged it in:

Jul  3 20:38:45 localhost kernel: usb 3-2: new high speed USB device using

The interesting part is the very last line. Could Apple have locked the filesystem 
somehow so that only iTunes can write to it?

I note that others have said they are able to use the HFS+ filesystem and write to 
it. But I also know that Apple is constantly making changes to the iPods, sort of 
slip-streaming them in without saying anything. And I bought this just last week 
from a store with a pretty high turnover rate.

Actually, to save typing I just edited it to be the iPod line. :)

Now it says:

/dev/sda3	/media/iPod	auto	rw,user,noauto	0  0

So the mount point is still /media/iPod. Or should it be just /media? Maybe that's 
what's wrong. Except those files were never visible before, even going deep into the 
folders.

Does the "hfsplus" driver usually call itself HFS-fs in the kernel?  I
wonder if you have another driver only capable of read-only that's
taking precidence.

Unmount the thing.  Modify your fstab line to specify the filesystem
where you say "auto".  Then re-mount the thing.

Then, as root, try to "touch /media/iPod/testfile" and see if the file
appears there.  Watch dmesg or /var/log/messages for anything funky
happening.

I think you're making progress, BTW.  :-)

I don't know. Seems to me I've seen it listed as "hfsplus" a lot, but I 
don't know if that was in wikis, how-tos, text files, man pages, or 
where. :( 

Is there a way to find out what drivers are loaded? I tried modprobe -
-help, but --help isn't an option for modprobe. Modprobe is the only 
command I have learned. 

> Unmount the thing.  Modify your fstab line to specify the filesystem

OK, I tried several things here. First, I changed the "auto" to 
hfsplus. That didn't work. Then I tried hfs+. Still got errors about 
wrong filesystem. Then I tried just hfs. That worked. However, still 
can't write to the iPod.

I did tail -f /var/log/messages, then unmounted, unplugged, and 
plugged it back in. The messages were identical to what I sent 
earlier, that is, the last line still says "localhost kernel: HFS-fs: 
Filesystem is marked locked, mounting read only."

No.  Looks right.  Not sure what's going on with that window.  Does it 
look the same as "tree /media/iPod" ?

Yep. If I use the command line and navigate to /media/iPod, then 
do a ls, I get:

Desktop DB  Desktop DF  Finder  ReadMe  System

If I open a Nautilus window, I get the same thing. Except Nautilus 
doesn't know what type of files these are. And I tried to open the 
ReadMe in gedit, but gedit said it could not be opened, even if I 
launched gedit as root. However, I can copy the files out of the 
Nautilus window onto the desktop if I want. On the other hand, if I 
try to move any of them I get an error message that it cannot be 
moved because it is a read-only disk.

The bizarre part is what happened to the four folders and three 
hidden files that were originally on the iPod, and where did these 
five whatever-they-ares come from? They were not on the iPod 
originally. I know that because I browsed the whole thing back 
when the folders were still there. Each of the folders was 
completely empty, except one of them had a bunch of additional 
empty folders.

I did discover an error in gtkpod. In one of the configuration menus 
it said the mount point for the iPod was /media/ipod. I noticed the 
lowercase p and changed it to uppercase. But it didn't make any 
difference. I looked all over for perhaps an additional location with 
the same typo, but didn't find any. I wonder if gtkpod is expecting 
FAT32, which is not case sensitive.

I give up for tonight. Perhaps with a clearer head in the morning I'll 
have more insights. Thanks to all for the suggestions. :)

Okay, I'm relatively certain now you *are* using the proper driver.  I'm
also relatively certain the filesystem being marked locked is the issue
at hand.... or at least *one* issue at hand.  :-)

I have absolutely zero experience with HFS and what utilities are
available for it, and my quick google search didn't turn up much of use.
 You may need to google some more.

If you dig in to the kernel source, you'll see in fs/hfs/mdb.c:
        if ((attrib & cpu_to_be16(HFS_SB_ATTRIB_SLOCK))) {
                hfs_warn("HFS-fs: Filesystem is marked locked, mounting
read-only.\n");
                sb->s_flags |= MS_RDONLY;
        }

...which is where our issue sits.  That if is happening.  I'm guessing
HFS_SB_ATTRIB_SLOCK is true here.  So it seems there's some sort of a
property an HFS filesystem can have that "soft locks" it.  How do we
un-lock it?  I don't know.  That's where Google should come in and help.
 :-)

Oh, a thought just occured to me.  What are the odds you're mounting the
OS partition (which would likely be marked read-only) instead of the
data/music partition on the iPod?  No, wait, the partition you're
mounting was reported to be 60GB in size, wasn't it?

While I wouldn't recommend it, you could potentially modify the kernel
source, commenting out that if block, and see what happens from there.
If that soft lock is just one of those "save the user from himself"
locks I say throw it away.  :-)

I wonder if other pluggers here have experience with HFS?  Maybe
somebody could shed some light on this soft lock issue?

OK, I googled for about half an hour and didn't come up with much.

The only reference I can find is the one we both have already seen, 
where someone said that using hpmount instead of mount made it 
read-write. I followed his instructions and it didn't work.

I agree it would be nice to throw it away, but being a total n00b, it 
would be doubly dangerous for me to try something like that. I've 
just gotten this thing going pretty much and I haven't yet figured out 
how to do backups. (Need to study rsync.) I don't have any 
personal files of importance on this computer yet, but I'd hate to 
have to go through all the installation stuff I've done so far.

> I wonder if other pluggers here have experience with HFS?  Maybe

While googling I found a page that said that gtkpod would read the 
files on the iPod if you click on the Read button. Not sure I tried 
that before. I did just now, with the iPod mounted. It said:

/media/iPod/iPod_Contol/iTunes/iTunesDB does not exist. Import 
aborted.

That's because the iPod_Control folder has disappeared. 
Considering that the folder structure is all gone, I think the only 
thing to do is go to FAT32. At some point you have to give up. :(

So now I need to figure out if Linux can format the iPod as FAT32. 
(I still don't want to install any part of iTunes on my Windows 
computer, if I can avoid it.)

I just did format --help and man format, and evidently "format" is not 
the command. I'll google on it later.

This *really* sounds like you have the wrong partition mounted. 
Before blowing everything away, you may want to try sda1 and 2 first..
(apologies if you already have, I missed out on a section of this
thread).

FWIW, HFS is also agnostic to case.  It will maintain upper case
characters, but it dosen't consider iPod to be different from ipod. 
Now, /media/iPod *is* different from /media/ipod, as you correctly
assumed (because it is the mount point, it is on your linux
filesystem, not the iPod's file system).

When I was working with my iPod, I found a tool that did exactly this
(I don't recall the name, though :( ).  I don't think you want to try
and do it manually so to speak, with standard formatting tools.  Your
iPod apparently has a non-trivial partitioning scheme, and changing
the wrong partition could be very difficult to undo.

Good luck, and good job.

Good idea. I am pretty darn sure it is sda3, because all the wikis 
and how-tos say that Apple puts three partitions on it, and the one 
the tunes go on is sda3. But I tried sda2 and sda1, and neither 
would mount. To do it I duplicated the line in fstab twice, and then 
just changed them to 2 and 1, and resaved fstab. The commands I 
gave were "mount /dev/sda2" and "-1. I also duplicated it with 
hpmount, but still no joy.

The totally weird thing is that Linux sees only five files/directories 
(and says it doesn't know what they are) -- "Desktop DB," 
"Desktop DF," "Finder," "Readme" and "System." It's supposed to 
see folders like "iPod_Control," etc. Yet while that is what Linux 
sees, when I look at the iPod's display and use the wheel thing, it 
shows exactly the menu choices that it did before I lost the folders.

Good point. Unfortunately, fixing that in gtkpod didn't help. :(

Well, gtkpod seems to have a utility that will place the proper 
directories on the iPod. I haven't been able to use it because the 
iPod filesystem stubbornly remains locked. But it pops up a 
window asking if I want to create a list of directories, and the list is 
exactly what I saw on it before I lost the folders. Actually, I even 
copied those folders off it and saved them to /home/jjj. (Except that 
there were three hidden files that couldn't be copied.)

I'll google on Linux +FAT32 and see what I can turn up.

Try sda0 and sda4, as well, for me.  :-)

(or fdisk it and see what paritions are there)

Which makes me wonder if you're on the wrong partition.

Somebody posted an iPod link earlier in this thread explaining how to
convert your iPod from HFS+ to FAT32 under Linux.  It's not as simple as
just formatting it FAT32... you have to deal with the software on the
iPod itself, remember.

OK, I gave up. Someone else had posted earlier that you didn't 
have to install the whole iTunes on your Windows computer to 
format the iPod, so I decided I'd just do it. I put the Apple CD in the 
drive and the installation utility came up. After getting past the 
license stuff it asked if I wanted to continue without checking to 
see if my iPod needed to be formatted. If I wanted to check I was 
to plug it in.

So I connected the iPod to an old USB 1.1 port (I have a 2.0 card, 
but I'd have to crawl around on the floor behind the computer). 
Windows popped up the usual "new device found." And then the 
Apple installation utility announced that it needed to be formatted. I 
told it to go ahead. To make a long story short, it formatted it and 
put all the correct files and database stuff on it. Then it prompted 
me to continue with the install. I aborted at that point, unplugged 
the iPod and plugged it into my Linux laptop.

However, I had to change the entry in fstab from sda3 to sda2 and 
the filesystem from HFS to VFAT before it would mount. As soon 
as it was mounted (I just did "mount /dev/sda2") Nautilus popped 
up a window showing the folders -- and all the folders were restored 
the way they had been previously.

So then I launched gtkpod. I added the 25 Stravinsky tracks and 
told it to sync with the iPod. This seemed to work -- no error 
messages, unlike previously. But after I unmounted the iPod and 
looked, nothing was there.

I spent the next ten minutes poking around trying to get the files 
onto the iPod, and I finally succeeded. Interestingly, the iPod menu 
just displays Do Not Disconnect continuously until I unmount it. In 
other words, I have to unmount it in order to see if the tracks made 
it to the iPod.

I was delighted to see that they were there. I plugged in the Apple 
earbuds and navigated through the music menu to the tracks. I 
selected one and pushed what looked like a Play button. At that 
point the iPod popped up a progress bar and appeared to start 
playing the track, except it took it all of two seconds to play it, and 
then it went on to the next track. And the next track and the next 
track all the way through all 25.

It appeared that the tracks were added to the database but perhaps 
the actual music files didn't make it. Being unsure, I remounted it 
and went back to gtkpod. Then I decided to delete all the tracks 
from the iPod and start over. Deleting them went OK, and it 
appeared to reinstall them but, once again, all it does is cycle 
through the tracks quickly without playing anything.

I suspect the problem is twofold:

1) I have no idea what the menu items and buttons on gtkpod are 
referring to. As I said before, my idea of playing music is to slap a 
CD in the player and go sit down in my LazyBoy. If it has more 
than an on-off switch and a volume control I have to call in the 
neighbor's teenager.

2) I have no idea how the iPod is supposed to work and which 
buttons make it go. Plus, the much vaunted click wheel is a PITA. 
It's sort of like a touchpad on a laptop. First it's not sensitive 
enough and then suddenly you've scrolled all the way to the end of 
the menu choices. And just as you click the center button to 
choose the menu item you have highlighted, the highlight shifts to 
an adjacent menu item and you're off somewhere you didn't want to 
go. Oh well. All I will have on it is classical, so I won't have to fiddle 
with it more than once per hour. :)

As a further possibility, maybe when I ripped the CD with grip the 
other day I screwed up that process. They may say they are mp3s, 
but are they really?

Anyway, just wanted you guys who have been helping me to know 
that the HFS+ filesystem is no longer an issue. I still have issues, 
though. I will probably always have issues. :)

Thanks for your comments and help. 

So I guess my next step is to try to figure them out.

I think you're on to something here.  Easy enough to verify, all you
have to do is play a track or two while they are still on the laptop.

Good Luck,

Why didn't I think of that? Sometimes you can't see the obvious! 

Anyway, I only copied them to the iPod, so they're all still on the computer 
as well, so I just tried it. Every single one of the 25 tracks plays the first 
couple bars and quits. The default for mp3s is Totem, which crashes if I 
immediately retry the same mp3. Otherwise it just disappears after the first 
couple of bars. Tried Music Player too, which also plays just the first 
couple bars and then disappears. 

So now back to grip. I made those 25 tracks with lame. Lots of other 
choices to try. 

Thanks for waking me up. :)

I recently spent some time with "More Eric Meyer on CSS" and got a lot out of 
it.

I'll take this opportunity to plug the PLUG archives. If you put the following 
into Google, you'll get 3 pages of hits:

(book OR books) AND (CSS OR Javascript OR "Oracle 9iAS") site:pdxlinux.org

This will get you recommendations that have been made on the various PLUG 
mailing lists, in addition to the main PLUG list.

Enjoy!

I don't do this myself, but I just took a look at the latex section of
the emacs wiki:

    http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/LaTeX

and it appears that the .tex suffix by default puts you in tex mode. 
You can try renaming your files to .latex or .ltx, or do a M-x
latex-mode in the .tex file to see if it works any better.  (You can
also use auto-mode-alist to force .tex files to be put into latex
mode.)

Ali,

   Thanks very much for coming through again. Using 'M-x latex-mode' works
like a charm. In the output buffer I still need to manually run dvips and gv,
but it saves one step.

   I wasn't aware of the emacs wiki. I'll go look at it.

For projects of any reasonable size, or anything with a bibliography,
I recommend building a Makefile.  Once that is done, you can use M-x
compile to latex your file/project (bound to f5 for me, but I'm not
sure that's standard).

Subject: [PLUG] NFS Question
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0507061051450.13811@PPC.DavidMandel.com>


I haven't been using nfs is quite some time, and Linux/nfs has improved
significantly (At least, people say it has.).

In any case, what parameters should I use on the server side to get
optimal performance without losing data.  At the moment, the only thing 
I'm doing is to use:

/home/            server01.DavidMandel.com(rw,setuid,no_root_squash)

in /etc/exports on the server and 

server01.DavidMandel.com:/home /home nfs 
                   rsize=8192,wsize=8192,soft,intr,bg,tcp

in /etc/fstab on the client side.

This seems to work, but I haven't tested it very well yet and I'm 
not at all sure the rsize and wsize are correct and/or needed.
I'm including them mostly because they improved performance when
I was using non-Linux servers.

Anyone have a recommendation that could save me time on 
experimentation?

                                          Thanks,

Rogan,

   For these documents I use LyX. That makes life _much_ easier. However, for
forms and graphics with PSTricks I'm finding it easier to work with the latex
files directly.

Thanks,

I think the "sync" option is now the default, but you may want to make 
it explicit to avoid server-side warning messages.

The NFS maintainers recommend against the "soft" option since it can 
result in invisible data corruption. See section 4.3.1 of the NFS HOW-TO:

* http://nfs.sourceforge.net/nfs-howto/client.html

Since you're using TCP (ergo NFS v3 or higher) for transport, you 
probably don't need to specify rsize and wsize; the server will specify 
the default block size. I think the default for NFS over TCP is 32K 
blocks, but that may have changed of late.

My memory isn't quite right. I have an Asus A7N8X-E
deluxe (socket A) and two single-channel PC2700
sticks, one 256MB and one 512MB, in the two blue
slots. These sticks are pretty generic. The board
supports dual-channel and up to PC3200. What would you
do instead of what I already have?

Sometimes when artifacts are given the name of an
analogous part of a living organism, the term appears
in quotes. Perhaps I should have done this.

   Ah, well. For some folks, memory is an artifact to be sure.

   However, you would not have left yourself exposed (unlike Bud Clark) had
you written, "My computer's memory is failing ...." :-)

Paul and others,
    Thank you very much.  
This is exactly the advice I needed.  I want to add that so far my nfs 
mounts seem to be working super.  In the past (ie. 1994-99) nfs on Linux
was good, because it worked better than any other PC based nfs 
software I tryed including Windows based nfs software and nfs on
SCO Unix and a couple other proprietary PC Unix OSs.  However, 
nfs on Linux was ever so slow compared with nfs on SunOS or Solaris 
or Irix or AIX or ...  Altho, I have done and probably won't do
any benchmarking of my set up, it feels fast and reliable.
So far, everything seems great.

                                          Sincerely,

What CPU do you have?  Odds are you won't see much, if any, speed boost
from going to PC3200.  Additionally, real-world speed gains from going
dual-channel are minimal outside of a few specific applications.
SETI at Home *really* likes dual-channelness and everything likes it if
you're using integrated video (I don't even know if the -E includes the
integrated video or not, however).

To go dual-channel you need reasonably well matched memory (I wouldn't
suggest PC2700 and PC3200 - and really this is debatable, it should go
lowest-common-denominator on you) and you need the same amount of RAM in
each bank.  If you currently have a 512MB stick and a 256MB stick, you
can go dual-channel by putting the 512MB stick in the slot by itself and
an additional 256MB stick in the remaining slot, up next to your
existing 256MB slot.  Bam, you should have dual-channel goodness.  :-)

This *should* be outlined in your motherboard manual to some extent...
although those things are generally quite horribly written.

Here is a link to the Makefile that I use to build all of my LaTeX

Subject: [PLUG] Have I slain my windows partition?
Message-ID: <20050707144036.GA32395@sccrmxc13.comcast.net>

I'm trying to set up a dual-boot windows XP/Debian system on my laptop. It's
a Toshiba Satellite 1955. I booted up with Knoppix, ran gparted, and resized
the windows partition, then rebooted with a debian boot cd (for sarge). 

I went through the whole install process. It worked ... about as well as I
suspected (the wireless adapter wasn't working yet and the nvdia driver
wasn't installed yet). At this point, I had grub working and could boot into
debian. 

Then I tried booting into Windows XP. The laptop is a hand-me-down from my
mother, and I believe it had Norton System Utilities on it. I *think* (but
I'm not sure, I was going to be testing this) that System Utilities
"restored" the old MBR because when I tried to reboot, it kept going from the
"now booting grub" window to rebooting. I could, at that point make it work
by booting off the knoppix cd, running grub and doing "setup" and "install".
And it would work, at least, it would be bootable. Lastly, I intended to boot
into Windows, turn off the system restore of the MBR sectors (like I said, I
wasn't sure it was the issue), reboot, fix it again with the grub install
routine, boot back into windows and return the system utilities to the
setting it had been in.

I couldn't get grub to install. It kept complaining that the partition wasn't
recognizable. I started up gparted, and it froze at 20% of examining hda.
Then I ran fdisk, and the partition is type 7, hpfs/ntfs. I didn't recall
what it had been before. I ran gparted from the commandline and at 20
percent, it died with the message that it could not read/write ntfs drives.

This is the same knoppix CD I had used before to resize the partitions; it
worked _before_ on this drive.

So I booted from the Knoppix CD on my desktop system (windows xp) and the
main partition also comes up as NTFS. 

In a fit of confusion, I removed the debian partitions from the drive,
intending to resize the windows XP partition and then figure out how to get
it back to work. But -- of course, it won't resize the partition. 

Now, it boots into GRUB loader, looks for the boot information in the debian
partition, and dies with an error 22. 

So... how did I resize the partition in the first place, and how do I get my
winduhs back up?

I have an XP 2500+. The 512MB module is toast; after
removing it I have 256MB of PC2700 in the middle slot.

If I wanted to upgrade RAM, what would be the best
path, considering the (possible) use of the 256MB module?

Ouch.  Toasted RAM chips are never good.

"Best" ??

Go buy yourself two 1GB PC3200 chips and chuck the 256MB module.

Next best would be to get another 512MB chip and another 256MB chip and
arrange them as I described earlier for dual-channel goodness.

Next best would be to get another 256MB chip and arrange it so they
aren't on the same bank.

Next best after that would be to get two 128MB chips and put them in the
two-slot bank and move the 256MB chip so it's in its own bank.

Yes, you probably have slain Windows. Parted is flaky at worst; at best
it will refuse to do destructive things. Here's what I'd recommend:

1. Get a legitimate Windows bootable CD of the same release as what was
on the hard drive. It should have an option to repair Windows. Unless
you managed to trash the filesystem beyond repair, you should be able to
get Windows back up and running.

2. If you do get Windows up and running, boot it up and see what it says
about the hard drive partitioning. Best case is, in addition to the main
Windows partition, you either have a live Linux partition or free space.
If you did a successful Linux mkfs on the live partition, Windows will
notice it's there but you won't be able to do anything with it. Back up
whatever you can from the NTFS filesystem. If you can't get Windows up,
boot Knoppix again, do the backup of the NTFS filesystem using Knoppix
with the NTFS filesystem mounted read-only.

3. If Windows is slain, decide whether you want it back and re-install
if you do. During the re-install, you'll get an opportunity to set aside
some free space for Linux. If you don't want Windows back, just nuke the
hard drive and install Linux.

In general, despite what the Linux hackers say, Knoppix and other
Linux-based toolsets aren't really cut out to "rescue" Windows systems.
About the only thing you can *reliably* do with them is mount an NTFS
partition read-only and copy files from it to another partition, usually
FAT32. For that matter, FAT32 partitions made by a Windows system
usually work reliably in Linux, but the converse isn't true -- FAT32
partitions made by Linux don't necessarily come up in Windows.

To change to color to something specific you want, you will need to
learn XML User Interface Language (XUL), which is what Mozilla/Firefox
for the interface; the widgets are not native to your windowing
environment.  

http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xul/

Changing settings in your window manager will have no effect, except for
the window container itself.  Someone already mentioned changing themes.
You also might want to consider a browser that uses the gecko rendering
engine with a native toolkit; for GTK, my favorite options are galeon
and epiphany.

http://galeon.sourceforge.net/

http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/

If you really like the Firefox feature set, there are many themes that
attempt to "native" under your preferred window manager.

   I found a theme that's much better than the out-of-the-box light gray. But,
the vertical scrolling thumb is still of such low contrast with the rest of
the window frame and window background that it's practically invisible.
That's the component I want to change. However, I'm not going to spend a lot
of time on it because I've too much to do.

I understand.  Firefox uses its own icons, widgets, menus, file  
system dialog, preferences, etc.  The lack of integration with the  
GNOME desktop is exactly the reason why I use Galeon on my Linux  
computers, though I have seen some themes for Firefox that mimic a  
GNOME environment pretty successfully.

Hi:

I recently inherited a video capture card that needs
to rely on the sound card to capture audio.
However, I found out that my on board sound card isn't
that great.    So I am thinking about getting another sound card.
I don't believe I can disable my current on board sound card.
If I stick another PCI sound card in the box, will
there be potential conflict?

I am running kernel 2.6.9.

Thanks

Did you check your BIOS? On my various systems with sound on the motherboard, 
the sound hardware can be disabled in BIOS.

Subject: [PLUG] Parallel Port Not Found
Message-ID: <200507081645.08115.rsteff@comcast.net>

My old Winders machine developed hardware problems, thus speeding up my switch 
to Linux only. Until recently, I haven't had anything to print from Linux. I 
had gone through the process of setting up CUPS, using YaST in SuSE 9.1, and 
as I recall from a year ago or more, it worked. When I tried to use it last 
week, it didn't. The complaint is as follows:

     No parallel devices found. It seems that your parallel port
     is not properly configured.

Here are a few relevant lines from /var/log/messages:

    Jul  8 16:07:02 dhcppc4 modprobe: FATAL: Error inserting parport_pc 
        (/lib/modules/2.6.5-7.155.29-default/kernel/drivers/parport/parport_pc.ko):
        Unknown symbol in module, or unknown parameter (see dmesg)
    Jul  8 16:07:02 dhcppc4 kernel: parport_pc: Unknown parameter `0x2f8'
    Jul  8 16:07:02 dhcppc4 kernel: lp: driver loaded but no devices found

Here are two lines from dmesg:

parport_pc: Unknown parameter `0x2f8'
lp: driver loaded but no devices found


Using YaST, I tried installing the printer. A button offering port information 
returned the following:

     IO Ports of parallel ports:
       0x378,

In the BIOS, 0x378 is listed as the address of the parallel port, not 0x2f8. 
I'm not sure what the comma is doing after the 0x378 in the list above, and 
I'm not sure where to change it using YaST, or using a more traditional 
command line approach.

Any recommendations? Is there a file I should look at to see if something is 
mis-configured? Any other ideas why my parallel port would "seem" to be 
improperly configured?

Thanks.

Not because it's a sound card, ALSA can deal with multiple sound cards
just fine, but you could have interrupt conflicts. However, I'm yet to
see a motherboard which does not net you disable integrated audio in
BIOS.

I believe someone on this list is the one who suggested 
MandrivaClub to me. I joined them in May for $12, which their site 
said was the fee for one month. Today I received my bank 
statement for June and discovered that they charged me another 
$12 on June 14. Nothing in the signup page said it was a recurring 
charge. Furthermore, I went to their site and cannot find anyplace 
to unsubscribe.

I sent them a stern e-mail demanding that they reverse the $12 
charge and terminate the account. Others be forewarned! And does

A little over a year ago I joined as a standard club member. The
charge was around $66.00, when I got my credit card statement I saw
that they had charged me $6600.00. Needless to say this was a real
pain, it left me over my limit... yada yada yada.

They cleared it up in a couple of weeks and upgraded me to a silver
member 6 MONTHS later for my trouble. I kid you not.

I've just received a request from someone subscribed to an email list.
She wants all of the email addresses on the list to put into her address book.
She states that earthlink will block email from anyone not in her address book.

There's got to be a better way. 
Suggestions?

Just say no -- to earthlink?  Well I run into all kinds of stupid ISP
stuff every day but this is a new one.

1. Find a real ISP that knows how to do e-mail?
2. Use a non-earthlink e-mail account?

And just for fun check out Yahoo's new e-mail footer.  Then see how they
get caught by SPAM checks for not following Internet standards ( can't
remember which RFC off the top of my head ) but they fail the NOABUSE
check.

I used to use earthlink a while back and always had more spam than I
could handle.  She has her spam settings set to high that will allow
only those users in her address book to be delivered.  She just needs
to lower her spam settings so that all email comes in and she then
tags those users who she thinks are spam.  From experience,  I would
say lose earthlink, and lose your spam.

Does anyone here have personal experience with IPv6 on Windows?
I'm updating a section on IPv6 for one of my Linux books and I'd like
to be able to make some sort of comparison with Windows. I investigated
this about 2 years ago. At the time, there was no IPv6 support in production
Windows products but there was developer support. Now I see that
Microsoft claims IPv6 support in Windows Server 2003 and XP/SP1
but I also see a Web page that references Windows Server 2003 "Trial
Software". I don't have Windows Server 2003 or a non-Home version of
XP and I'd like to avoid buying copies.

Wow.  It's a shame she's paying so much for such bad spam filtering.
I still don't know why the biggest ISPs always use the least effective
and most troublesome methods available.  Maybe the folks who make
these decisions are too far up the ladder from the technical folks.

> There's got to be a better way. 

Shouldn't she be able to add the list's sending address?  Or does the
EL filter really pay attention to the envelope FROM: address?

Subject: [PLUG] TCP connect() times out
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0507092258250.29063@pecos.madboa.com>

I got an odd new problem. The host in question (Gentoo, SPARC, 2.4.30) 
is on a five-node LAN sitting behind a NAT gateway.

I can

a. ping any host on the LAN or Internet (i.e., ICMP works fine)
b. query any DNS server on LAN or Internet (UDP works fine)
c. receive TCP connections from LAN or Internet
d. initiate TCP connections to hosts on LAN

I cannot

* initiate TCP connections to hosts on the Internet

The problem isn't specific to any TCP protocol; they all fail: smtp, 
telnet, ftp, http, ...

All the other hosts on the LAN have no trouble initiating connections 
to off-site servers.

I'm working on isolating the interesting parts of strace output; right 
now the only thing that leaps out at me is that connect() is timing 
out, e.g.,

connect(3, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(80), 
sin_addr=inet_addr("129.95.36.100")}, 16) = -1 ETIMEDOUT (Connection 
timed out)

The problem just began in the past 24 hours. I've recently emerged 
some pam packages, but core things like glibc and the kernel haven't 
changed. Clues?

The problem seems to have been that tcp congestion notification 
(net.ipv4.tcp_ecn) had been turned on, which doesn't work and play 
well with my internet connection. Turning it off got things working 
again.

My guess (and it's only a guess) is that /etc/sysctl.conf was tweaked 
when I updated the Gentoo sys-apps/baselayout package back on June 10. 
When I rebooted the machine yesterday morning, it got a new ECN 
setting, which hosed things.

Well, that blew a few hours of my time. Feh. :-)

Then you might want to spend the $.05 and get a decent ISP. At worst ECN
should be ignored by decently run networks, only on badly run networks do
such packets get dropped. This could also be an oversight on the part of
the ISP, and education might help things.

If you got a new kernel during this period, then it could be the newer
kernel defaults to ECN being on.

As soon as I have multiple broadband options, I'll consider switching. 
My only other options at this point are either too expensive (a 
dedicated partial T-1) or too slow (dial-up).

Nope. I build my own kernel on this system, and my .config hasn't 
changed much in the past 18 months.

Run 'ipv6 install' and 'ipv6 if' and it will be up and running (assuming 
you have a router that provides the autoconfiguration info). This is on XP.

It works.. not much else to say.

Yeah, ECN seems like a headache a lot of the time... I'm not sure it's
worth the hassle at this stage of the game.

Not just the ISP.  It is a problem with older routers.  It effects
contacting pretty much any site with old braindamaged equipment.

I think that's your first clue right there.  It isn't unreasonable
that security modules should affect your network performance.  Which

As I mentioned in my "SOLVED" follow-up, the trouble was with the ECN 
bits in TCP headers. Non ECN-capable routing equipment is supposed to 
ignore those bits, but "there are some broken firewalls and 
load-balancers in the Internet that instead respond to an ECN-setup SYN 
packet with a reset" [RFC 3360, sect. 3].

The solution, once identified, was simple:

# sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_ecn=0

All,

Do you guys know of a standard way of checking which flavor of linux your
running?  I know redhat and Suse use a Redhat-release and Suse-release file in
etc, but what about other flavors? What do you usually do to determine the
linux flavor that a script is running on?

If the distro is LSB compatible *and* if the LSB utilities are installed
you can do this:

    lsb_release -d

See man page lsb_release(1) for other options.

It's not reliable, but you can often check /etc/issue to determine the
"flavor".  However, /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net are the "banner text"
issued to login clients (console being /etc/issue and telnet/ftp using
/etc/issue.net) and are occasionally changed so as to provide minimal
information to potential script kiddies.

YMMV...  It seems a bit suspect on an older SuSE box.  

user at host:~/> cat /etc/SuSE-release
SuSE SLES-8 (i386)
VERSION = 8.1
user at host:~/> lsb_release -d
Description:    UnitedLinux 1.0 (i586)

  It doesn't work at all on a standard FC2 box.  I don't have an FC3
box handy.

Why not use the tried-and-true "cat /proc/version" and then cook up a
regex to extract the distro name?

Yeah, but one can at least work to improve the portion of the network
that you've got some influence on. With it effecting all sites, that does
point to the local ISP.

I prefer this cat /proc/version but now see a slight problem with the

I'll give CentOS a shot tonight.

Just replace the noisy fans. Dust will eventualy ruin the bearings, and 
even after you clean it out, theyll still be noisy.
Its best to dust once every couple months to prevent that sort of thing 
in the first place.
Any canned air will work really, just buy whatevers cheapest.

to migrate it to an OpenPKG controlled Zope instance, version 2.7.4.

They would like a Zope guru to migrate this website to the new system. 
The website is high visibility (accreditation) and they have money to
throw at it. Their expectations are 8-16hrs of work.  Must be fully
operational by the end of July.

Contact me if interested and I'll hook you up with the right people. 
Today would be nice.

I've done that on a couple of occasions. I hope to replace the machine soon, 
so I don't want to put too much time into it.

Good idea. Now, to find a way to schedule it. Maybe I should install cron in

SLES8 is based on top of the UnitedLinux distro, so I don't think that's 
really incorrect.

Works great on FC4:

Others have pointed you towards a standard, but don't rely on anybody
actually adhering to the standard.

None of my boxes have the LSB utilities installed on them.

Only two of my boxes (the Gentoo ones) have the distro name in
/proc/version.

Sorry, don't think there's an easy way to do it.  FWIW on Slackware,
there's /etc/slackware-version.  On Gentoo there is /etc/gentoo-release.

I think we're groping toward an answer here.  My Debian box has
/etc/debian_version, which contains "3.1".  Giggled for all three
filenames and got both an article and a script:

Subject: [PLUG] SuSE 9.3 Install - "Searching for info file..."
Message-ID: <200507112140.27476.rsteff@comcast.net>

I burned and checked the MD5SUMS for the 5 CD's for a SuSE 9.3 install and am 
attempting to use them on a Gateway machine: 350 MHz Pentium with 128 MB of 
RAM and a 6 GB hard drive. 

The first CD loads, and I select "Installation" from the first screen. The 
Kernel loads, I press <ESC> to get more information and watch as it gets up 
to "Searching for info file...", which happens right after "Activating usb 
devices", the first step in "Starting hardware detection...". 
Then it sits.

I did a Google search:

"Searching for info file" site:http://lists.suse.com/archive/

and found a number of entries. One comment recommended putting a floppy in the 
drive. I found a file named info.txt on the CD (by looking at it on this 
machine), and copied it onto a floppy formatted with an EXT2 file system. 
This did not appear to help.

Another comment from the Google search suggested switching to the console 
screen <Ctrl><Alt><F3> before the process hung. When I did that, I watched 
insmod run through a number of steps. The last few lines on the screen read:

--------------------------------------
insmod /modules/usb-storage.ko
Hardware probing finished.
floppy: /dev/fd0
got info from cmdline
insmod /modules/piix.ko
Ok, that seems to have worked. :-)

Looks like it cannot find the CD drive.  What kind of drive and what ide
interface is it on?  Is the CD drive using "cable select"?  (If so,
remove the CS jumper.)

If it would help, I have the full retail package of Suse 9.3 that I got 
at Fry's, all CDs and the DVD. I'm not using it, since I decided to 
go with Ubuntu instead.

I didn't have any problem installing it, but I did it from the DVD, not 
the CDs.

The install booted from the CD. Is it possible for it to see the drive and 
then lose site of the drive?

Earlier I had tried to use Knoppix to figure out what the network card was, 
without opening up the box. Knoppix was unable to find a file system. I 
wondered if this box had something special done to it to make messing with 
the drive harder, but I was able to erase the partition tables and later 
install RH 7.0 from an old CD set, so I don't think it's the CD or the hard 
drive.

I'll keep that in mind. I do have a DVD drive in another machine that I could 
swap out with the CD drive in this one.

Now that I know both the hard drive and the CD are working, I'll try a couple 
of other things, like an ftp install.

Thanks for the offer.

I'm not sure what you've already tried, so some of the following might
be redundant:

Is python installed and in the path?  (ie, type 'python' and see what it says)

If so, you should be able to type 'python yourscript' to run it.  

Another way is to see exactly where the python executable is by typing
'which python' and adding a magic comment to the top of your script of
the form:

#!/usr/bin/python

Then, assuming that the script itself is executable, you can simply cd
to the script's directory and type './yourscript'

   True, but it's not working. I may have used an incorrect output statement,
or it may well be something else.

   That's there.

   This doesn't work, either. It's definitely user error by a novice.

Subject: [PLUG] Laptop brand recommendations
Message-ID: <1121191198.2677.17.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hi all,

I will be going off to college this August, so I'm in the market for a
laptop. I'm looking for one that will last me a long time (ideally, all
four years) and that is fast enough I won't be swearing at it before the
first year is out. But my performance requirements aren't very high - my
4-year-old P4 1.5Ghz with 768MB RAM is plenty quick for me.

The main Linux compatibility issue with laptops seems to be the builtin
wireless. That is almost a non-issue for me, as a) my college doesn't
have wireless all over campus and b) I already have a PCMCIA 802.11b/g
card that works with the prism2 drivers.

I am mainly looking for recommendations on manufacturers or specific
lines of machines. Where can I find reliable, well-built machines with
reasonable performance? 

If you can only say which brands to avoid, that's helpful as well.

Thank you!

Evan

   I didn't think it appropriate for the full list, and thought that
plug-programming was dead. Anywho, this is the current error message:

Evan,

   The linux-on-laptops web site is a great resource.

   I've had very positive experiences with a couple of Toshiba notebooks, my
current Sony Vaio, and the IBM ThinkPad. The latter seems to be a consensus
pick as a solid box on which to run linux. It's a bit heavier than others,
however. But, you're young and strong so that's not an issue. :-)

The name m is only in scope for the duration of the combos function. 
When you call it at the bottom, you have nothing in scope called m (or
n, for that matter).

Perhaps what you wanted was for the first two arguments passed at the
command line to become m and n.  You can get command line arguments
from the sys.argv collection and assign m and n accordingly.

You don't have to declare variables in Python before assigning to
them, but you still must assign them before they may be used.

HTH,

Dylan

The ThinkPad T-series is quite good.  They weigh in at around 5 lbs,
and with extended battery hit 4-5 hours on a charge.  The screen
resolution ranges from 1024x768 to 1600x1200 (the T-41p, 42p and 43p
models--giving you something like 130dpi).  There is a mid-range
screen at 1400x1050.  The processor power tops out at around 2ghz, but
you can drop 2 gigs of ram in the T-43, (not sure about the T-42).  As
a side note, the T-43p *does* exist, you just have to crawl around
lonovo's thinkpad site to actually get one in your cart, last I
checked it wasn't on the "let me build it" screen.

One area of difficulty you should be aware of in laptops is power
management.  The T-40 seems to work fine with the current state of
ACPI / APM in Linux, but I've head that the T-43 has some issues. 
(I'll be getting a T-42 shortly, hopefully it's more like the
earlier..).

That sounds like a very good battery life. How does reality match up
with what they claim?

I've used some old thinkpads (ca. 1998) at school and they're built like
tanks. They seem to run forever. Have they kept up their good
engineering, and do you expect it to continue under Lenovo? I was biased
towards IBM, but after the acquisition I'm not so sure.

Can you recommend some reading on understanding the issues involved in
power management, and how to test to see if a given machine works well?
I have never owned or used a laptop with a working battery, so this is
new territory for me.

Thanks for your reply!

Evan

Those numbers are based on the experience of friends & co workers, I
don't know what IBM claims -- probably 5.5 hours.

I haven't seen anything to indicate that the quality has degraded, but
I don't have a lot to base that on.  On the plus side, I'm working at
IBM research and haven't heard anyone complaining about the newer
thinkpads (and there are a *lot* of thinkpads around here).

I don't have any good links -- I'm no expert here either.  As a
general rule, the newer it is the less likely it will work
flawelessly.    As Rich mentioned, the linux-on-laptops site is a good
start.  I'd also check out emperorlinux.com, the laptops are extremely
expensive, but if the hardware can be supported, they are probably one
of the first to find out if and how.

Other than that, ask around and google are my best suggestions.
  
I'm interested to see what you go with, if you end up with a T-42 we
should swap configs.

   I wondered if I needed sys.argv; now I know.

  Buy the maintenance...  Which contract depends on how tough you are
on the hardware.  I'm pretty easy on my laptops.  I bought the 2nd
tier "take-it-to-Gateway-for-service" contract.  Our CEO is very tough
on hardware.  I bought the first tier "extra-special,
onsite-with-a-smile, fix-whatever-breaks" maintenance for *his*
laptop.

  We've needed it!  In the last "failure", our CEO left his laptop
outside in the rain.  Then he killed the hard drive by powering up the
machine right after drying it out in the oven.  Dell showed up a
couple of days later.  They replaced the bad drive with a smile.

  Buy the maintenance contract that fits your budget and (ahem...)
lifestyle.  You'll wish you bought if when your roommate spews beer
puke into the keyboard.  ;-)

Yes, absolutely. It's the IDE version of the old SCSI ID & termination 
problems (if you don't want to know what those are, count yourself among 
the blessed).

Basically, you can have two IDE devices on a cable, one jumpered as 
Master and one jumpered as Slave (there is a whole political correctness 
brain dead argument here, but I'll spare you) and get on with the gory 
details:

* If there is only one IDE drive on the cable, you typically do not have 
any drive number (0 or 1) jumpered.

* If you have another drive, you need to check whether the other drive 
is jumpered and, if so, if it is jumpered as Master; if there is no 
jumper for the drive number, you need to jumper it (generally for 
Master) and then jumper the CD drive as the opposite.

Most, but certainly not all, IDE drives have a sticker showing the 
jumper settings. If your drive does not, I recommend looking up the 
drive make model (Google is your friend). Although you certainly can get 
the settings right by trial and error, there is much greater certainty 
of error than of trial. Or something like that.

Phase of the moon, et cetera. Just check the jumpers and see what they are.

Good luck!

The hard drive is the only drive on one cable, and the CD is the only drive on 
the other cable. The CD is jumpered as Master.

I successfully loaded RH 7.0 on the machine later last evening. I used the CD 
from the old book, "Red Hat 7 Weekend Crash Course" from several years ago.

I'm going to use this machine to try out different distributions, so I'll move 
on to loading the same SuSE 9.1 distro from CD that I used to load this 
machine, the one I'm using to send this e-mail. I'll see what happens after 
that. Another thing I was going to do before I downloaded the 9.3 set was to 
load 9.2 via the network -- I burned the one CD to do that some weeks ago. It 
started up just fine, but wanted me to pick the network driver. I hadn't 
opened the box, so I had no idea what card was in there. That's what I was 
trying to use Knoppix for. But since you gave me another reason to open the 
box, I now know that the network card is a 3Com 3C905-TX.

Thanks for the thoughts.

A little googling turned up this wonderful link:

http://www.pc.ibm.com/ww/thinkpad/batterylife.html

They list *many* different models. The T42 I priced is listed as 4:25.

That's good to hear!

One thing that concerns me about IBM is I can't find any way to get my
hands on one before I buy - they don't do retail as far as I can tell.
Do you know how I can get to see one in person before I part with my
money?

Thanks for the links. I stumbled on this site while looking for
information on the builtin wireless:

http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/ThinkWiki
http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Intel_PRO/Wireless_2200BG_Mini-PCI_Adapter

It's a bookmark for sure.

> I'm interested to see what you go with, if you end up with a T-42 we

I just priced a T42. I chose the Pentium M 735 (1.7Ghz), the 15"
1400x1050 screen, 60GB drive, 1GB PC2700 DDR, an extra battery, and XP
Pro (I plan to use Debian mostly, but Home won't work on my college's
network and I might as well have a usable OS if I can't skip it
entirely). With the $130 3-year depot contract, it comes out to $2507. 

Is that normal? It seems high to me, even given IBM's good reputation.

Thanks for everyone's suggestions,

Hmmm. Just for the heck of it, remove that jumper and try again, please.

   I get the same error with this code whether I run it interactively or at
the command line:

Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
   File "combos.py", line 17
     num = factorial.factorial(m)

   I don't know why the syntax is invalid.

   The files factorial.py and combos.py are attached. Factorial works from
both the command line and interactively. The name of the variable is
immaterial; 'top' or 'foo' produce the same error.

I now know what to do with ordinary s-p-a-m, forward it to:

<missed-spam at comcast.net>

I have one of those items that, if I were naive enough to follow up on it 
would end up causing no end of grief with my bank account. I understand that 
this is fraud, and I was under the impression that either the state attorney 
general's office or some federal organization has some interest in tracking 
it, but I've never found where either of them want it sent.

Has anyone else solved this so it is as easy as forwarding ordinary s-p-a-m to 
my ISP?

What exactly am I buying when I purchase one of these contracts? Does it
include the cost of whatever it takes to get it working again, or just
give you the opportunity to buy replacement equipment from the smiling
technician in your living room? Obviously IBM's plans will differ from
Gateway's or Dell's, but I'm just trying to get an idea.

Thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] Forward headers with KMail
Message-ID: <200507122044.02407.rsteff@comcast.net>

So, before I tried sending the fraud e-mail off to the FTC and 
antiphishing.org, I thought I should verify that I'm actually sending full 
headers. It appears that when using "Forward as attachment" with KMail, I am 
not sending any of the old headers. I tried forwarding the e-mail to one of 
my other accounts. I did it with all headers displayed before sending, but 
the only headers when I received it were from me. Short of copying and 
pasting the header into the body of the e-mail I send, is there some other 
way to make KMail include the old headers?

And if I do, since Comcast wants the offending e-mail "forwarded as an 
attachment, with full headers" how do I make KMail fit Comcast's 
requirements?

Subject: [PLUG] Restricted answering machine...
Message-ID: <1121025745.42d17ed114c83@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

Has anyone used Linux to create a restricted answering machine?
By restricted I'm thinking, "use the caller id and a whitelist to
control who can leave a message."  If an abuser can get around that,
I figure that voice analysis will catch him.  Another possible 
option is, "Enter your password to leave a message, then press *."

I want to limit the number of messages from unknown people, maybe 15 
messages total a day.  On top of that, I'm thinking a time limit of 
1 minute for any message is a good idea also.  "You have one minute 
to leave a message after the tone."

I'm wondering if my Kermit chipset 3com/U.S. Robotics modem can use 
caller id?  How do I find a modem that allows me to program caller
I.D. using Linux?

Home Depot has a $20 dual-action vacuum/blower called the TurboVac 800
that works great for this kind of thing.  You really just want to use
the blower on sensitive areas and the vacuum with the brush attachment
cleans the inside of cases, fan blades, etc.

For the fans, buy low-viscosity sewing machine oil, peel the sticker
back and put in a couple drops of oil.  The difficult part is not
putting in too much oil and getting it all over the surface where the
sticker should re-attach.  I try to make a point of blowing out and
oiling the fans anytime I have to take a box down for an extended
period.

I think tinyurl messed up on this one, or Home Depot changed its site. I get 
to Home Depot, but the items on that page are way beyond the $20 range. What 
I get when I click on that link is a display with eight home standby 
generators ranging from $7495.00 to $11,295.00, two 12' x 20' timber building 
packages, and two wine cellar cabinets!

But, regarding vacuums, I once read that one should not use vacuums with 
plastic hoses because of the static charge built up by the flow of air 
through the hose.

I don't know why I forgot about that idea. I used to do it on an old unit my 
wife used for years. I'll get out the 3-in-1 the next time I open the box.

Thanks for the reminder.

Sorry if you are getting multiple copies of this, but this email is 
going out to about 450 people on 4 continents and about 15 countries, 
plus about 50 different email lists I'm on. For those not local to 
Portland, this is a change of address notice and for EVERYBODY, it is a 
request to you to help me update my address book.

So, *before* anything else, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE send me your current 
name, email address, physical address (including postal code), and 
phone. Please do not assume that I have them or that what I have is 
correct. Please do it now before you even read any further!

***

Off To Canada Potluck
Sunday, July 31, 2005 12noon to 6pm
Creston Park, Group Site A, Portland, OR

Directions at:
http://www.parks.ci.portland.or.us/Parks/Creston.htm

This is a potluck, so bring food, soft drinks, and beer (optional) to share.

ALSO, please bring your acoustic musical instruments - we can't have 
amplifiers, but we can make lots of noise. I'll have my musical saw(s) 
and will want to play with any erstwhile victims. There is seating for 
250 people at our site, so there's room for everybody!

***

So, now that you have responded with your contact info, here's our new info:

Ron, Elizabeth, & David Braithwaite
2778 East 6th Avenue
Vancouver, BC V5M 1R5 Canada
604-215-7859 (not live until 7/27)
ron at braithwaites.net
eliz at braithwaites.net
david at braithwaites.net

As you may or may not have heard, we (Elizabeth, David, and myself) are 
moving to Vancouver, BC Canada at the end of this month - right after 
this party!

That's right. We're leaving the country for a few years and this is your 
last chance to see us except when we're visiting Portland (which we hope 
to do frequently) or if you come up to visit us. Our new house has an 
apartment in the basement, so we welcome house guests after we're 
settled - just call and be prepared to share if others show up at the 
same time.

So what about each of us?

David will be starting the 9th grade at VanTech (Vancouver Technical 
Secondary School), which is sort of like Portland's Lincoln & Benson 
Tech combined into one. He's really excited about attending the high 
school that is featured in so many movies and TV series (e.g., Smallville).

Elizabeth is going to continue working for ESHA Research, just 
telecommuting instead of working on-site. She really loves her job and 
is glad to be able to continue working at ESHA.

I'm working on CareWheels Canada, which is incredibly exciting.

Basically, what CareWheels does is hire people with disabilities to 
"watch over" frail Elders (and others) who want to safely live in their 
homes instead of moving to assisted living facilities. We put about 5 
motion detectors into the Elder's home to detect their movements 
associated with their Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). So if they 
don't get out of bed by 10am, when they are normally up by 8am, or if 
they go into the washroom and don't come out for 2 hours, the AI 
(Bayesian Inference) software tells their Telecare Provider there might 
be something wrong. That person then tries to contact them to see if 
they are OK and, if they can't reach them, contacts their designated 
caregiver. In addition, the Telecare Provider will call each of their 
Elders every day, just to make contact and give them an opportunity to 
talk to someone if they are lonely.

There is more to it than that, but if you want to know more, you'll have 
to come to the party and ask me directly.

At any rate, this email is going all over the world to every continent 
(except Antarctica - I used to know someone at South Pole Station, but 
he recovered from his craziness and got a "normal" job).

So that means you might not be able to make the party. That's OK. BUT 
SEND ME YOUR CONTACT INFO ANYWAY!!!!

Hope to see you at the party or up in Vancouver, BC!

Bright Blessings of Peace,
-Ron

Geoff gave an interesting talk last Thursday on Wikipedia which some

   I'd greatly appreciate having one of you expert SysAdmins explain the
"service in.comsat" line in secure-log. I see this every day.

  --------------------- Connections (secure-log) Begin ------------------------

Refused Connections:
    Service in.comsat:
       localhost.localdomain (127.0.0.1): 210 Time(s)

  ---------------------- Connections (secure-log) End -------------------------

  According to the in.comsat(8) man page,

"Comsat is the server process which receives reports of incoming mail and
notifies users if they have requested this service. Comsat receives messages
on a datagram port associated with the `biff'' service specification (see
services(5) and inetd(8)). The one line messages are of the form:

     user at mailbox-offset

"If the user specified is logged in to the system and the associated terminal
has the owner execute bit turned on (by a `biff y '' the offset is used as a
seek offset into the appropriate mailbox file and the first 7 lines or 560
characters of the message are printed on the user's terminal. Lines which
appear to be part of the message header other than the `From '' or `Subject''
lines are not included in the output."

   I don't know why it's turned on, how to turn it off, or why it's there in
the first place. The man page is not that comprehensive. More to the point,
should I even care about it?

TIA for the education,

Rich

Message-ID: <42D51DE3.9000901@braithwaites.net>

Since the last invite was sent last night after quite a few glasses of 
wine, I thought I would give a little more context for the folks on this 
list who don't know me. I know a lot of you PLUGgers and this is 
probably the only way some you will hear the news. So, if you want to 
stay in contact, send me an email, otherwise ignore this. I'm removing 
all entries from my address book that I don't get a response from.

Now, on to the form letter:

Sorry if you are getting multiple copies of this, but this email is 
going out to about to a whole bunch of people all over the world. For 
those not local to Portland, this is a change of address notice and for 
EVERYBODY, it is a request to you to help me update my address book if 
you feel like staying in contact.

So, IF you care and *before* anything else, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE send 
me your current name, email address, physical address (including postal 
code), and phone. Please do not assume that I have them or that what I 
have is correct. Please do it now before you even read any further!

***

Off To Canada Potluck
Sunday, July 31, 2005 12noon to 6pm
Creston Park, Group Site A, Portland, OR

Directions at:
http://www.parks.ci.portland.or.us/Parks/Creston.htm

This is a potluck, so bring food, soft drinks, and beer (optional) to share.

ALSO, please bring your acoustic musical instruments - we can't have 
amplifiers, but we can make lots of noise. I'll have my musical saw(s) 
and will want to play with any erstwhile victims. There is seating for 
250 people at our site, so there's room for everybody!

***

So, now that you have responded with your contact info, here's our new info:

Ron, Elizabeth, & David Braithwaite
2778 East 6th Avenue
Vancouver, BC V5M 1R5 Canada
604-215-7859 (not live until 7/27)
ron at braithwaites.net
eliz at braithwaites.net
david at braithwaites.net

As you may or may not have heard, we (Elizabeth, David, and myself) are 
moving to Vancouver, BC Canada at the end of this month - right after 
this party!

That's right. We're leaving the country for a few years and this is your 
last chance to see us except when we're visiting Portland (which we hope 
to do frequently) or if you come up to visit us. Our new house has an 
apartment in the basement, so we welcome house guests after we're 
settled - just call and be prepared to share if others show up at the 
same time.

So what about each of us?

David will be starting the 9th grade at VanTech (Vancouver Technical 
Secondary School), which is sort of like Portland's Lincoln & Benson 
Tech combined into one. He's really excited about attending the high 
school that is featured in so many movies and TV series (e.g., Smallville).

Elizabeth is going to continue working for ESHA Research, just 
telecommuting instead of working on-site. She really loves her job and 
is glad to be able to continue working at ESHA.

I'm working on CareWheels Canada, which is incredibly exciting.

Basically, what CareWheels does is hire people with disabilities to 
"watch over" frail Elders (and others) who want to safely live in their 
homes instead of moving to assisted living facilities. We put about 5 
motion detectors into the Elder's home to detect their movements 
associated with their Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). So if they 
don't get out of bed by 10am, when they are normally up by 8am, or if 
they go into the washroom and don't come out for 2 hours, the AI 
(Bayesian Inference) software tells their Telecare Provider there might 
be something wrong. That person then tries to contact them to see if 
they are OK and, if they can't reach them, contacts their designated 
caregiver. In addition, the Telecare Provider will call each of their 
Elders every day, just to make contact and give them an opportunity to

Fraudulent SPAM - 

Since the government seems to do nothing besides collecting statistics,
you may wish to consider the equally futile but more entertaining option
of "mugu-baiting".  Mugu is the Nigerian word for spam.  So mugu-baiting
is the hobby of contacting these criminals under a pseudonym, winding
them up, inducing them to waste a lot of time and money, etc. 

There are numerous websites dedicated to this activity, such as
baita.mugu.co.uk, 419eater.com, etc.   Some of the exploits are hilarious.

Unfortunately, yes that's relatively normal for thinkpads.

You can probably save a lot by getting the minimum pre-installed ram
and then upgrading on your own (newegg had much better prices on ram a
week or two ago -- just make sure you know how it's distributed across
sticks when you buy the laptop).

Paul,

   Yes, it's in /etc/services.

   Do I need it installed and active? My understanding is that biff notifies
the user when new mail arrives in his inbox (or, when there's any mail in the
inbox?), and that's not important for me. I check mail quite frequently in
any case.

Thanks,

Rich

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0507130847470.25867@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I found a function that accepts input of a list of items (s) and an integer
(k), and produces another list of all combinations of s things taken k at a
time. The initial code is this:

def klistcombs(s, k):
     """Returns list of combinations of S taken K at a time.

     S must be a list.
     K must be >= 0.
     If K > len(S), an empty list is returned.
     Else if K is 0, a singleton list containing an empty list
     is returned.
     The k-combinations are returned in lexicographic order
     of their indices.
"""
     output = open('components.out', 'w')
     input = open('components.in', 'r')
     s = input.read()

   I added the file statements because I want to use a text file on disk as
the source of the input list. However, it's not working.

   When I run interactively, I get an illegal syntax error at the final 'n'
when I specify:

>>> klistcombs(components.in, 2)
   File "<stdin>", line 1
     klistcombs(components.in, 2)
                            ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

   If I change the name of the file so there is no extension, the error
changes to:

>>> klistcombs(components, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
NameError: name 'components' is not defined

   Since I cannot get past invoking the function, I assume the error is in the
way the function is defined. How can I define klistcombs() so that it will
look for the input list externally, on the hard drive?

Thanks,

Rich

What about the `--format' option to ls or perhaps the column command,
or maybe even fmt?

Just some thoughts. HTH.

   I've identified part of the problem, but not the part about passing
arguments into the function when it's run interactively.

   In the stand-alone part of the code I removed arguments to be passed in
from the command line; that is, I specifically assigned a filename to 's' and
an integer value to 'k'. Then I stepped through the code using the python
debugger ... and found a problem with the algorithm.

   Apparently, this function is designed for a list of numbers, not character
strings (i.e., "words"). So, it's not going to work for my purposes without
serious re-writing. However, I still would like to learn how to pass the
filename in as an argument when the function is called.

Thanks,

Rich

That sounds like something fun to do if I get some spare time. I'll look into

Reading the KMail manual I find:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Message->Forward...

Forwards themessage to a new recipient. Using Inline, the message's text and 
some important header fields will be copied to the body of the new message 
wit a text marking the forwarded part. Attachments will be forwarded as 
attachments of the new message. Using As Attachment the message and its 
attachments will become an attachment of the new message. The original 
messsage headers will be included in the forwarded message, too. Redirect 
works like forward, except that the message stays the same (even the From: 
field). The user who redirected the message is added in special header fields 
(Redirect-From, Redirect-Date, Redirect-To, etc.).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This suggest that I'm doing it the right way, but I'm not seeing the results I 
expect. Here's the headers of the fraud e-mail:

Rich: I haven't followed all this (and probably shouldn't respond) but 
parameter 's' is supposed to be a string, right? Then call it with 
klistcombs("components.in", 2). Are you just missing the quotes?

BTW, it wouldn't be hard to read the file in line by line and do a 
string.split on it to get the two lists.

Holger,

   Parameter 's' is a list. I suspect you are correct that I did not use
quotes on the command line.

   That's what I planned on doing if I could not find an existing wheel.

Well, that doesn't surprise me; I thought I saw a session ID embedded in
the URL.  Just search for 'turbo vac' and you'll find it.

That's why you use the blower, not the vacuum, on anything sensitive.
That's the great thing about this unit--I looked everywhere trying to
find an affordable blower, which seems to be pretty rare.  At least, I
*assume* the blower is safe--I haven't fried anything yet.

Let's see, I could buy one of the timber building packages, and one of the 
wine cellar cabinets, and one of the generators. Then, I could buy one of the 
Turbo Vac's to clean the place!

I guess if static on a blower were a problem, then it would be a problem with 
canned air coming out the plastic tube, too. I wonder if there is something 
different about vacuums. I know that static is a known problem in woodworking 
shop vacuums that use PVC pipe and that grounding straps are used to deal 
with it. Apparently there have been some cases of wood dust exploding that 
brought this to folks attention.

The sure-fire way is View -> All headers, then copy it into a text file. Then 
attach the file and send it away.

Dave, are you limiting this list to *only* Open Source organizations? I
remember reading in an old Linux Journal that a number of economic
development groups in Africa widely use Linux & other Open Source/Free
Software for the usual reasons. If this would be a good example, I'll dig
thru my pile of back issues (I own practically over one that has come
out) & find the article.

Another possibility is in the political realm: practically every campaign
is strapped for cash, which means Open Source gets used, & used heavily
in political campaigns. (One recent example was Tom Potter's campaign
for Mayor here in Portland.)

As a somewhat unrelated note, I saw on the Democratic Blog Daily Kos
that there is a call for help to create an internet presence for county
Democratic organizations; this would appear to me to be an opportunity
to promote Linux. (And I'm certain that the same could be said for other
political groups like the Green Party or the Libertarians.)

mini-tripod mounted webcam, but all I know about usb cameras is that
there is an enormous range in quality and price.

Do any of you have any input on what to look for in one of these?  I'm
particularly concerned about the ability to programically access the
camera (well, and resolution, but that's something I don't feel
completely ignorant about).  Next on the list of concerns is driver
support... are webcams prettymuch plug&play with linux these days?

Thanks,
--Rogan

Well, that makes sense. I guess it's too simple to be obvious. Thanks for the 
idea. I'll do that until I convert to Thunderbird. I've been happy with KMail 
for the most part, but a couple of limitations have turned up, like this 
forward as attachment thing (which I've discovered Thunderbird does 
correctly), and the limited organizational possibilities of KMail's address 
book. I've only had Thunderbird on the machine for a couple of weeks, and 
have only used it once or twice.

BTW, this is KMail 1.6.2 (Using KDE 3.2.1) which installs with SuSE 9.1, 
should someone look at this in the future and have different results on their 
own version.

As you look for the right camera, don't rule out still photography digital 
cameras. Some of them can be used as USB cameras.

I haven't tried it yet, but the manual for my Canon Digital Rebel (first 
version) says that it can be viewed via a computer when connected to the USB 
port, and that some of the controls may also be manipulated. I haven't looked 
into what Linux software supports the feature, either.

It's advantage is the selection of lenses.

Its disadvantage is that it is a good bit bigger than simple USB cameras.

I don't know if my earlier post made it to you, the one where I wondered if 
you had done anything "special" to the hard drive in the Gateway machine you 
gave me, since the SuSE install wouldn't work, and Knoppix couldn't find a 
file system, but I've since successfully installed RH 7.0, so I know that the 
hard drive is quite normal -- at least it is now!

Thanks again for your generosity.

I'm sitting in the kitchen of our new house and checking my email. How 
sweet.

At any rate, just to up your paranoia level a wee bit, when Elizabeth 
and I were returning to the US last Friday night through the Peace Arch 
crossing, there were contractors installing 4 very interesting looking 
antennas at each lane going into US customs. Each one pointed at a 
different corner of the car. When I asked one of the contractors what 
they were for, he said it was to read the RFID chip that will be in all 
of our new passports and drivers licenses/national ID starting this fall.

Cheerios!

   This may not come to pass. There are plenty of voices trying to get out the
word that there are too many holes in RFID technology for it to work on
passports. Last I read (not too long ago), it was being re-thought. Anyway,
we'll see, eh?

I know one of the things they were looking for in my background was if I 
was convicted of any crime...

Not a convicted felon, just convicted. Felony, misdemeanor, didn't seem 
to matter to them.

At that point the border guard has the authority to approve or deny 
entry into the country.

The guy at the booth said he just wanted to make sure we could go home 
when we wanted to leave. The gal in the immigration office almost made 
me feel like we'd had a body cavity search to go to Canada.

I had an easier time getting into Japan... but that time I remembered my 
passport...

The Drupal project (drupal.org) produces a good CMS package on almost
nothing. Up until this weekend, when they solicited donations for a new
server, AFAIK there was no money whatsoever on hand. Now they have
around $10k plus Summer Of Code money, which might be as much as $5500
at the end of the summer. A non-profit entity is in the works but all
money is currently held by the head developer.

It's not on the same scale as Debian, but it might fit on your list.

Agreed, and practiced forever. Well, almost. The only time I used Lookout was 
for the 9 months I was in school a few years back, and that was because the 
school provided the laptops and all the software on them.

I have on a couple of occasions fired up Lookout on my Winders machine, but 
only to help someone who was not in a position to refuse to use it.

Newegg sells some of the Thinkpad models.

I'd guess that you still have to talk to IBM to purchase the depot contract.

Subject: [PLUG] Hello from Maryland, Speakers Bureau
Message-ID: <20050714024105.GA2873@gate.kl-ic.com>


I'm visiting my wife's family near Baltimore.  I noticed that the
Columbia area Linux Users Group was meeting, and that they did not
have a speaker.  So I volunteered, and gave my Dirvish talk.  It was
well received, about 20 people in attendance.

A lot of LUG's find themselves without speakers, but I bet that there
are many of us with prepared talks scattered around the country; with
OSDL in the area, we probably get speakers visiting from all over.
If we could connect potential visiting speakers with PLUG, I bet we
could make Dave's and Allan's job a lot easier, and our meetings more
interesting.

Perhaps there is somebody who can set up a "Linux Speaker's Bureau".
User groups that host speakers could put their meeting times and
planned schedules up, while potential speakers (dozens from PLUG
alone) could check their travel plans against the open slots and
volunteer if they wish.  It would be a good way for the speakers to
connect up with the locals and learn about Cool Stuff in the area.

Any interest?

Keith

Keith,

   Consider taking this one step further: make the local Speakers Bureau list
(name, topic) available to the local Chamber of Commerce, Business After
Hours, schools, and other civic groups. This would provide expertise for the
community in general.

Even without it being official, you need proof of citizenship. That's 
what both the US and Canadian border guards told me. An Oregon drivers 
license is NOT proof of citizenship. It's only proof that you have been 
given permission to operate a vehicle. A social security card is NOT 
proof of citizenship. It's only proof that the US government has a 
number assigned to you for the purpose of taxing you.

Message-ID: <20050714042600.20939.qmail@web50601.mail.yahoo.com>

In Feb. of this year I made a Sarge installation, then
"testing," using CD's downloaded in Dec. 2004. I had
this in a dual-boot arrangement with WinXP, and was
not too impressed with it at the time. But after
devoting a few hours to its shortcomings, I am
thinking about keeping it. In the meantime, Sarge has
become stable.

As one might expect, I am interested in upgrading it
and installing new applications with apt. My present
sources.list, reproduced below, does not appear to do
the job. Can anyone suggest modifications? (I
downloaded the first three CD's of the stable version
of Sarge, so these could be included.)

I saw that, but I'll probably still go straight through IBM. The price
difference comes out to around $200 for comparable machines, but if I
buy it from IBM I know they can't duck out of the warranty by saying "we
don't support models bought from retail vendors" or "newegg did that to
your machine, we don't cover it".

I will go to newegg (or some other retailer) for the memory. A 1GB stick
is $440 from IBM and $104 from newegg (in the small SO-DIMM size).

This is why women in Mexican border towns try to get to the hospitals in 
the Texas border towns. Once their child is a US citizen, the US 
government won't make the mother leave the country.

The last time I crossed into Canada, they only asked for a driver's
license to look me up on their computer systems.  Crossing back in the
US, they only asked for a driver's license to look me up on their
computer system.  Granted, this was before the whole 9-11 incident and
they are prone to be more anal these days at the border.

Officially, I am sure, you will need proof of US Citizenship.  Which, in
our country, is either a passport or birth certificate.  And if you ask
the official channels, you will be told this.  And I am sure the border
guards could detain you if you fail to provide this documentation.  But
would you actually be detained if you only had a driver license?  I
would think probably not.

Coincidentally, Oregon is one of the few states that do not require you
to submit or show a valid US Birth Certificate or other documentation of
legal US residency to get a driver's license.  But I hear this may
change in the future, as the Patriot Act and its supporters apply
pressure.

Be sure to check out IBM's "Featured" thinkpads.  The prices are quite
good.

http://www-131.ibm.com/content/home/store_LNV_PublicUSA/en_US/featuredproduct.html

I wanted to buy the featured X40, so I called IBM.  The lead time was
3 to 4 weeks, so the salesperson said he could drop the price even further.
If I hadn't been in a hurry (I'm traveling soon), I would have jumped at it.
When I told him I needed it right away, he suggested I search the web
for IBM resellers.  That's why I ended purchasing from newegg.

I needed 2 types of good ID and residency papers to get an official ID
card, which is the non-driver's equivalent of a driver's license. As I
recall, I used my birth certificate and social security card. 

When I later upgraded to a driving permit, all they needed was the ID
card.

Ah... there's interest, but it's finding the best venue to get this done
with. Many organizations want a FREE speaker, and as such would tax such
An organization into non-existence.

So I would suggest breaking it up into LUG only speakers and Public
speakers.

March of this year, a DL was not "good enough". We had our drivers 
licenses (all four adults) in a non-descript Chevrolet Cavalier with 
plain Oregon plates. All four adults are related, and live at two 
different Oregon addresses. Nothing that should have been a red flag.

Yet we spent nearly an hour at the immigration office at the border 
because we did not have proof of citizenship.

Coming back into the US was actually easier than leaving, although, the 
first question our of the US border guards mouth after looking at our 
ODLs was, "And do you have proof of citizenship?"

>Officially, I am sure, you will need proof of US Citizenship.  Which, in
>our country, is either a passport or birth certificate.  And if you ask

We asked prior to making our plans. We were told to bring "ID". We were 
not told to bring proof of citizenship. To me, my DL *IS* ID. I had no 
reason to think otherwise.

I happen to have birth certificates for all four adults, since two are 
my kids, and the other adult is their mother. As I said we're all related.

Wrong. We were told to go to Immigration. The woman at immigration told 
us that if any of us had criminal convictions, we would be denied entry 
and escorted back across the border and placed in custody. The US border 
guards would then process us to determine if we were to be detained by 
US officials.

This is what the border offical told us, and I have no reason to doubt 
what she said. She did produce a sheet of paper with every traffic 
violation I had committed since I was 16. This at least proved that I'd 
been in the US for a while...

It's already changing. The Oregon congress is hearing arguments and may 
change that law by the end of this session. I have no idea what this 
will require of present license holders. If they grandfather in present 
license holders, then the requirement is pretty bogus.

For what it is worth, kim Komando recommended buying the laptop from the

get one that works with all fo their class software etc.

Message-ID: <1121351428.3818.7.camel@localhost>

Hi David, 

How about telling us more? Per
http://business.newsforge.com/business/05/07/08/1619251.shtml, 

it sounds like you're the key guy:

Mandel said, "Given the current situation with LinuxFund, I may be
interested in becoming a part-time executive director. The goals and
procedures of LinuxFund need to be clarified and rethought in light of
changes in open source." Mandel thinks Linux Fund should be incorporated
into a larger, well-run non-profit, such as Portland's FreeGeek, which
is a successful hardware recycler and major FOSS proponent.

He also believes that LinuxFund's top priority should be distributing
the $126,000, that has accumulated since the project was largely
abandoned. "LinuxFund also needs to get a developer board together and
start giving out money," said Mandel. "I would be willing to help with
this."

Thanks,
Mike

To be sure, massaging this with find or like tools will work.  But I 
remember this being a facility within /bin/ls itself.  I'll keep looking.

The FreeBSD project has a donations page:
http://www.freebsd.org/donations/index.html
There are several pages which describe how to donate to their
organization, and list hardware they've received or would like to
have.  I can't imagine that the FreeBSD organization is swimming in
cash.

The Gentoo Linux site (http://www.gentoo.org) has a link to paypal on
the main page.

I'm pretty sure 'ls -l' is an "aligned columnar listing" be default.
Perhaps I'm missing something, could you be more specific in what you
mean by "aligned columnar"?

The difference is that "felony" means "no entry to canada, ever",
while "misdemeanor" means "you must pay CDN 200 to get a 'transit

Since I'm a felon, it means "never".

Mike,

    I'm not going to say much at this point, but I am actively working 
with the fund's founder, Benjamin Cox, on saving the fund and we 
are making good progress.  In fact, I'm taking this afternoon off
so I can come to Portland to work on LinuxFund business.  There is
actually quite a bit of work to be done to save the fund, and I am
ever so grateful to Benjamin for his knowledgable help.  The Newsforge
article didn't mention him, but he is very much involved once again
with the fund if only on a short term basis.

                                          Sincerely,

As I said, usernames can be longer than 8 characters and when listing 
directories in say /var/spool/mail causes the output not to be aligned 
columnarly due to the entries in the user and group column.

I didn't know about your history with the law until I stopped by your
IRC channel and discussed your spam fighting techniques a few months
ago.  I mentioned your techniques to a fellow anti-spam crusader with
your name attached who responded back with a "Oh wow!  I know him, he's
like a celebrity" and sent me some links.

So for PLUGers who are relatively new like myself (I've probably only
been here for three or four years) and don't know Randal's story, I
would suggest hitting Google and reading up on it.  It's really quite
disturbing.

I've never been so happy to "know" (in the online sense) a convicted
felon before.

Just out of curiosity, what class and what area of "Open Source" ?

"Open Source" is an extremeley broad term to use in this context... it
means so much to so many.  :-)

The class is entitled "Open Source UNIX Software Development".
Basically, we have 8 weeks to work on almost ANY GPL'd project that we
want. In doing so, we get to familiarize our self with the open source
development in general (i.e. licenses, patches, IRC, sourceforge,
revision control...)

There is a wide variety of projects this term. One guy is writing a USB
ethernet driver, another is writing a clone of the NES Dragon Warrior
Game, and another is doing some work on a programmable electronic fuel
injection controller. I am getting credit for working with the Kernel
Janitor's in reducing the GCC4 Kernel build warnings.

It's a great class. And like you said, extremely broad and informal.
Hope to see you soon.

If you didn't live out in the sticks and showed up to an ALT meeting or 
two, you could "know" Randal in at least the casual acquaintance sense, 
too.

And if you were a foot taller and blonde, you could probably "know" him in 
the biblical sense as well.

Right now living in the sticks has nothing to do with it... I'm working
such hours that staying up late during any weeknight is somewhat
nonproductive.  :-)

I'm going to be a zombie tomorrow because I visited a friend two minutes
away....

If you are running Debian/unstable, I'd suggest holding off on

Message-ID: <200507150828.08578.rsteff@comcast.net>

It used to be that if I clicked on a .jpg file in Konqueror, the image would 
display in the right hand panel. I assume that is the default action. I 
changed the file association for .jpg files in KDE and now I can't get it 
back. I found the place where I remove unwanted associations, and removed, 
one at a time, all that were shown, but now, instead of displaying the file, 
Konqueror asks me what program to use to open the file. Konqueror itself, is 
not on the list of programs to open an image.

Any idea what I need to do to restore the default?

Dick,

   Two lightweight image viewers are 'display' and 'xv'. Either would be a
good choice for opening .jpg and other image files in your browser.

My statement is a semi-famous quote from the movie "The Princess Bride," 
which I trotted out just because I think it's funny. It was totally 
unrelated to the original pun. I apologize for not clarifying the context.

You mean it's not in the "images" folder of your k-menu?  That doesn't 
really matter.  I don't think you can just type "konqueror" in the 
blank though (does that make a loop or no?)

>Any idea what I need to do to restore the default?

You need to enable the "embedded viewer".  There's another tab on the 
file-associations dialog.  This is what you get if you click on the 
image.  Middle-click may still send it to the external program which 
appears first in the list (like gimp.)  I think the behavior may have 
changed in some subtle way between versions.  I've had the same sort of 
confusion.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0507151522100.15022@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I had a function working when I specified the input file as "*.py" and
imported it as a list. However, I need to be able to use disk files with
various names as input, so I changed the code. The function broke (of
course!) and I cannot find a web page that gives me the appropriate methods
to use.

   Here's the function code:
===========================================================================
#!/usr/bin/python
"""
   Takes a list of components and creates an output file of all pairwise
   combinations of components.
"""
import sys
import pdb

pdb.set_trace()

def scopingpairs(input, output):

   input = open('sys.argv[1]', 'r')
   output = open('sys.argv[2]', 'a')

   pairwise = []
   src = input.read()

   for elem1 in src:
     for elem2 in src:
       if src.index(elem1) < src.index(elem2):
         pairwise.append((elem1, elem2))

   for index in range(len(pairwise)):
     output.write(str(pairwise[index])+'\n')

   input.close()
   output.close()
============================================================================

   Working interactively, (so I don't know that the open() syntax is correct
and working), the code works until it gets to the src.index(). Instead of
whole words being indexed, each character is indexed. I've tried putting the
input file as a list with quote delimited words, and as a string of quote
delimited words. Makes no difference.

   I've googled for "python list methods" but haven't hit anything relevant or
current. I can provide a sample data file if desired.

TIA,

Rich

I think you probably want to get rid of the quotes around both  of those
~ arguments.  Additionally, what's the point of passing "input" and
"output" as parameters if you never actually use the values?

| src = input.read()

This will read the entire input into a single string.
You probably meant to say:

src = input.read().split()

(Which will split the input string into an array using whitespace as a
delimiter).

Additionally, (assuming I read your intention correctly) your loop
probably makes more sense as:

- ----------------------------------
for i,elem1 in enumerate(src):
~  for j,elem2 in enumerate(src):
~   if i < j:
~     print >>output, (elem1,elem2)
- ----------------------------------

Or, alteratively:

- ----------------------------------
for i,elem1 in enumerate(src):
~  for elem2 in src[i+1:]:
~    print >>output, (elem1, elem2)
- -----------------------------------

Rich: input.read() gives you an array of strings, one for each line in 
the input file. Unless you parse those lines with split() or a regex 
function they are just strings, or character arrays.

Thank you for the reference you sent yesterday. I will check it out over 
the weekend.

input.read() gives you one large string.  input.readlines() gives you a 
list of strings, one per line.

Shahms,

   I tried using input, but it was an empty string. After I assigned it I
could see the contents.

   I've four books on python (two ORA books by Mark Lutz and a couple
downloaded from the web), but I cannot find answers to questions such as I've
posted here. I wanted to use input as a list, not just a file handle, but
that wasn't working for me.

   The loop worked fine when I was working with a list. I've no idea if I
want a list or a split string. My references did not give me any insight into
this.

Holger,

   Aha! That's useful knowledge. I had all strings on a single line, not as
individual lines. I guess there's a difference in the best input file format
if the file's to be read into a list or something else.

Shahms,

   D'oh! I _did_ know this. And input.readline() reads one "record" at a time.

Thanks for the reminder,

   I'd greatly appreciate your (collective) suggestions on what python
documents I should read.

   For example, I now have reworked the input data file so one term is on each
line, and the script (still playing interactively), and read them into a
list. But, each item in the list has a terminating \n and I don't know how to
strip that off. Slicing removes the last element, not the newline from each
element.

Thanks,

   Got it!

   fh = open('environ.in', 'r')
   input = fh.read().split()

   ... and input is a list with no newlines.

Why are you using Python in the first place?  After having used Bash,
then a bit of perl, then a bit of C and C++, then python and a lot more
Perl, I really don't care much for Python.  It's not like the other kids.

I wouldn't jump in to a python project without a better grasp of the
language such how to manipulate strings or utilize functions and all
that jazz.  IMHO, perl is a much sharper tool for most jobs.

That said, Python is an interesting language that *is* quite useful for
many jobs... a lot of folks really love it and do amazing things with
it.  But if you're struggling with it, I'd suggest using something that
might be more familiar for you.  :-)

Rob,

   Well, I could do the whole thing in C. Python does eigenvectors and I'm not
sure that perl does. My need is for a mathematically-complete language with
the ability to easily build a GUI front end. The core libraries are in C
already.

   There are a ton of addons to python: Numeric/NumPy, SciPy, and so on. They
access LAPACK, BLAS, MatLab/Octave, S/S+ and R, and more.

   I understand the basics, it's the lack of current documentation on
implementation that frustrates me. Heck, I taught myself FORTRAN in the early
1970s using the horrible IBM S/360 manuals. I don't think the US Tax Code was
more obtuse than those manuals. (Try reading and understanding the -G, -H,
-WATFOR, and -WATFIV compilers using those old dogs.) C I found pretty easy;
eventually got my mind around pointers to pointers .... I certainly know the
OO concepts and how they work. I shouldn't have to spend hours of
trial-and-error to read data from a file and write data back out again. Sigh.
'Nuff venting; gotta' go.

A few things:

1) We will be in the "build workshop area", which is the back room, and 
there will be signs.

2) Free Geek has monitors, mice, keyboards, patch cables, and network 
drops, so you don't have to bring any of that. If you're new to Linux and 
are doing a new install, then you should bring your own monitor (so that 
we get the settings right.)

3) I will grab a parking spot close to the Fair for a loading/unloading 
zone. Look for a large white sign that says "Linux Clinic unloading".

4) We're going to need some volunteers who are willing to take turns 
protecting the loading/unloading zone.

5) We will bring stickers and sharpies so you can label your equipment. 
It's always best to avoid misunderstandings. :)

6) Free Geek just got a thousand new Ubuntu disks and they're willing to 
share.

7) The Clinic session will only be from 1-4pm, but the Geek Fair runs from 
1-7pm. So everyone should have a chance to check-out the other activities.

On a non-Linux related note, it looks like the Chunkathalon will be held 
at Free Geek this year too - Labor Day weekend. Definitely something to be 
experienced. http://www.dclxvi.org/chunk/

It looks like vgetty is a simpler package.  I looked into Asterisk,
but I don't think Asterisk is meant for what I'm after.  
I want to find a way to talk verbally over a dial-in connection 
so that any eavesdropper will hear a modem instead of the 
conversation.  I have mgetty pretty much figured out except for 
routing the ppp connection so that the person dialing into me 
can go beyond my server.  The modem isn't showing up as an 
interface.  Packets coming in through my modem seem to show up 
on my ethernet card.

As far as using vgetty for an answering machine implementation,
I guess I'll have to switch between mgetty and vgetty via cron.
The problem with the vgetty approach is that eavesdroppers will 
hear the conversation.  Ideally, I want to come up with some way 
to talk verbally over a dial-up TCP/IP connection.

I thought there was some way to set up mgetty and vgetty on the
same line, but I could be mistaken.  Isn't there some way for
the caller to send a code so that the server can choose between
mgetty and vgetty?

Does Outlook Express have to have an smtp server?  Can I just set up an
imap server and call it good?

Well, I got a dial-in server to route out onto the net okay.  It was the
firewall that lokkit created that was a problem.  I got pap to work as
well.  If you select terminal in XP for dialer settings, you don't make
an ip connection.  I want to allow ssh into my normal network to my
dial-in box, but nothing else.  I'm planning on adding another nic
to the dial-in box and running it out to my external subnet.

I have four networks...


     A ---- B ---- C
            |
            D

I want to allow ssh/scp from B to C, but not from C to B.  I want
to allow C to cross B without entering it to get to A.

So far I've used iptables DROP in the FORWARD chain on
B for packets from C destined to B or D.  I've also dropped 
all tcp and udp packets from C to B on B in the INPUT chain 
after explicitly allowing, time, dns and ssh packets.

If I can get packets to cross B and terminate somewhere in A
or beyond, I save an ip address on the A net.

The bind server on B can see the addresses for networks A-D, 
not just the ones for A and C.  Does Bind 9 offer a simple 
solution to limit the addresses that C can look up off of B?  
The server on B is a caching server fed off a primary and 
slave server in the B network.

I control the A-D networks.

The on-line docs which you seem to be using and "Learning Python" which
you seem to also have should be enough.  It kinda seems like you're
diving too quickly into trying to use the language to write your
application before you've really learned the language enough.  Are you
actually typing the examples in the book, instead of just reading them?
I've found that there's something about typing such things that makes me
absorb it more fully than just reading it.  Doesn't "Learning Python"
have problems at the end of each chapter?  Make sure to do those too.
And return the "Learning Python" if that's what you've got--it's really
not very good.

LMAO.  That's a good one.

Why not create a dial-in connection then just use asterisk over the
connection?

I managed to get xbase-clients installed, but in my situation I did it
by:

  # aptitude install libglu1-xorg
 
which uninstalled a number of packages I was using, e.g. k3d, xine and
audacity.  Then, I was able to:

  # aptitude install xbase-clients

Your mileage my vary.  It seems Debian is in the process of a C++ ABI
transition.  I presume that is responsible for the carnage.  When
the affected packages are rebuilt, I can reinstall.

Aha! Thanks. I missed that tab.

So, if this happens again, and I forget how to fix it, I can search the PLUG 
archives and find this:

In Konqueror, click on Settings, Configure Konqueror. Select File 
Associations, click on the plus next to Image, and select jpeg (or whatever 
image type for which might have messed up the association). Then click on the 
Embedding tab and click the radio button for "Show file in embedded viewer".

It's easy. Montego Montoya said it to the villain, when Wesley was not

Actually, it's Indigo Montoya, and it was said by Wesley to Indigo at end of 
the story after Indigo has gotten his revenge on the villain and is wondering 
what to do next. Wesley, the current Dread Pirate Roberts says, "Have you 
ever considered piracy? You'd make a great Dread Pirate Roberts," or 
something close to that.

And now, I suspect that most of the list wish that we'd leave this great old 
movie on the shelf. :-)

So, Peter Falk says to his grandson, Fred Savage...

Russell,

PLUG should attend OSCON.  However, we aren't signed up at this point.
In the past, we have gotten a booth at various conferences and shared it 
with other Open Source Groups in Oregon like Biznix and BLUE and Clark 
College LUG and the mid-Willamette Valley Linux Users Group and the Eugene 
Linux Users Group, and the Bend LUG, and who ever wanted to come.  
PDXLUG has usually had their own booth, and I think they are signed up
with OSCON this year.
(Washingtonians - Sorry, I annexed Clark College into Oregon.  We Oregonians 
do tend to do that.)

In any case, PLUG should have a booth.
I'm busy with OSU and LinuxFund and life in general.

              Would someone like to volunteer to coordinate things?
              (Russell, did I hear volunteer?)

If so, we need to contact Andrew Calvo <andrew at oreilly.com> (707-827-7176)
about getting a booth and we need to start scheduling volunteers and 
planning our very very simple booth.  As for me, I will see if I can find
PLUG's banner, and I will post an invitation to the Mid-Willamette Valley
LUG and the Eugene LUG and see about contacting the Bend LUG.  I believe
Ed Sawicki (Biznix) and Marvin Kosmal (CLUG) read this list, so they 
will know about it.  Also time permitting (seems unlikely), I will try
to update my "Linux in Oregon" flyer and get some of the printed.



                                          Sincerely,

No, I am not volunteering.  The reason I mentioned it is because I was
conversing with an unnamed high-level official of the PersonalTelco
project who said that the PTP's new booth assignment was next to
OSUOSL and the "PLUG" booth.  That confused me, because I hadn't heard
anything about PLUG having a booth, but I *had* heard (sorry to dredge
this up again) that PDXLUG was organizing a booth, and it sounded like
someone was confused again about who was who.  I am not trying to
start that whole debate again, I was just trying to collect
information about what, in fact, is going on.

Thanks for your data.

Thanks for letting me know.
I also notice PLUG --> pdxLinux.org has been dropped from a one
or two more user group lists.  I suspect this may be one reason
our typical meeting attendance has gone from 55 to 35 lately;
altho I'm sure there are other reasons as well.

I notice a number of ISPs seem to use something called WebsiteOS

Does anyone know who makes this and how it is licensed?

Well, seeing that <URL: http://www.websiteos.com/ > is 403 and
<URL: http://help.websiteos.com/ > reads "This domain has no homepage. 
Please link to this site via your hosting provider.", I would have to 
guess "Very Proprietary".

There are other pages available via the help.websiteos.com subdomain which 
indicate that this certainly is a support site for this software.  Whether 
or not it is operated by the manufacturer is another story.  While they're 
used a whole lot, they don't seem to be doing much in the way of overt 
marketting.  [Which means what?  They're making all of their sales through 
insider contacts and cold calls?]

Is it possible that this approach is intended to thwart free software 
clones of their (probably trivial) functionality?

The administrative and technical contacts for the domain are both just 
some low-rent registrar that doesn't actually give you control of your 
domains.

Choices will be limited.  I think that CompUSA (and maybe Best Buy)
would have a very small selection.  The PCClub stores would have a
bigger selection; according to website (www.pcclub.com) the Tigard,
Clackamas, etc. stores are open on Sunday.

Scenario #1 - A Tale of Two Package Management Systems

I run a mix of APT and RPM based systems.  I'll find the same functionality on both
system types, but supplied by different programs.  If I want the meta data from 
my digital camera photos I use exif on the apt systems and jhead on the RPM systems.

This got to be maddening enough in recalling the sytax to extract the information
that I finally just dumped them all and loaded Image::ExifTool from CPAN 

A quickie Perl program works on all my systems and is easy to munge to extract 
whatever information I need on a particular day for whatever purpose.

Scenario #2 - Pain in the GUI 

Discovering that the most recent set of install CDs on hand were from May 2004
I downloaded new ISOs to burn.  Fine, but since the last time I've burned a CD
I've upgraded xcdroast and it's broken.  It insists on trying to work with
/dev/pg and there's no (findable to my mind) to tell it and it's auto detection
stupidity to just use /dev/cdrom.  I can cut and paste the command line from the 
error log and replace the "dev =" and write CDs just fine.  

If I manually edit ~/.cdroast/xcdr098.cfg it will work.  But the point of a GUI is 
not to have users hand editing config files in hidden directories.


Scenario #3 - Auto Pretty Install is fine until ...

You reboot the machine and the mis-written GRUB config isn't bootable.  

Bah.

Beer time.


Thanks to the home brewer who named his beers "Sofa King Stout", "Sofa King IPA" and so
on.  He was a good enough brewer that three or four of his brews made it to the national
finals and won medals.  The American Homebrewer Association refused to print the names
of his beers in the awards list.  The next year all of his brews were named "You wouldn't
print it anyway STYLE".

Message-ID: <4C7800EB52CF054BB0B4FF50968C1B6607CB70@cccmail2.chemeketa.network>

Hi all,

   Just saw this and had to share it with all of you.. 
   I have been interested in portknocking for a while now but hate the fact that you have to run scripts to check log files etc... It just seems clunky, at least for my needs. I only wanted to use it as an extra level of basic connection protection. You can really do some neat things with port knocking like sending encrypted passwords via icmp packets etc. But this wasnt what I was looking for. I just wanted something that would block John Q Scanner from seeing ssh open and then taking his time to try to crack it. Plus I didnt want to have to install a little script on every client to access the machines. 
   Well to make a long story short I ran accross this little fedora iptables entry:

-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 -m recent --rcheck --name SSH -j ACCEPT
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 9022 -m recent --name SSH --remove -j DROP
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 9023 -m recent --name SSH --set -j DROP
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 9024 -m recent --name SSH --remove -j DROP

   I wasnt aware of the --name and --rcheck ability in IPTABLES. With these you can telnet to port 9023 (line3) and it will start tagging all packets from your host(and only your host) with the name SSH. Then you will be allowed to access port 22 (SSH) via the --rcheck (line1). When you are finished just telnet to 9022 or 9044 to stop tagging your traffic (closing the ssh port). One thing to note is the double entries for the shutdown. At first I wasnt sure why there were two then I though of scans.. Whether its a top down or bottom up scan it will always turn the naming off. 
   Sorry I just got so excited when I saw this. How elegant and powerful this is! 
   Hope you all enjoy it as much as I have...

Thanks for your time,
Jeff M.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0507181006190.8236@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Has anyone here seen an application that can pick data off a page scanned
with an inexpensive flat-bed scanner? I'm not referring to OCR, but to
associating a value with the position of a mark (such as a filled bubble) on
a line across the page.

   This has been suggested by a hardware vendor as an alternative to an OMR
scanner. There's apparently one company that sells Microsoft-based software
for about $2,000 per seat to do this.

Thanks,

Rich

I think you are on the right track with iptables although I'd have to get
more specifics on the routers/firewalls within the 4 nets.
You speak of A-D both as nets and as systems so it's a little confusing.
(the INPUT chain controls traffic inbound to the firewall itself, not a
network)
I don't think you need to play with DNS to achieve your stated goals.
I'm pretty checked out on iptables and feel sure that with proper scripts
you should get the results you are looking for.
If you want me to look at any of it just let me know.

I have four networks...


     A ---- B ---- C
            |
            D

I want to allow ssh/scp from B to C, but not from C to B.  I want
to allow C to cross B without entering it to get to A.

So far I've used iptables DROP in the FORWARD chain on
B for packets from C destined to B or D.  I've also dropped 
all tcp and udp packets from C to B on B in the INPUT chain 
after explicitly allowing, time, dns and ssh packets.

If I can get packets to cross B and terminate somewhere in A
or beyond, I save an ip address on the A net.

The bind server on B can see the addresses for networks A-D, 
not just the ones for A and C.  Does Bind 9 offer a simple 
solution to limit the addresses that C can look up off of B?  
The server on B is a caching server fed off a primary and 
slave server in the B network.

I control the A-D networks.

Russell,

PLUG should attend OSCON.  However, we aren't signed up at this point.
In the past, we have gotten a booth at various conferences and shared it 
with other Open Source Groups in Oregon like Biznix and BLUE and Clark 
College LUG and the mid-Willamette Valley Linux Users Group and the Eugene 
Linux Users Group, and the Bend LUG, and who ever wanted to come.  
PDXLUG has usually had their own booth, and I think they are signed up
with OSCON this year.
(Washingtonians - Sorry, I annexed Clark College into Oregon.  We Oregonians

do tend to do that.)

In any case, PLUG should have a booth.
I'm busy with OSU and LinuxFund and life in general.

              Would someone like to volunteer to coordinate things?
              (Russell, did I hear volunteer?)

If so, we need to contact Andrew Calvo <andrew at oreilly.com> (707-827-7176)
about getting a booth and we need to start scheduling volunteers and 
planning our very very simple booth.  As for me, I will see if I can find
PLUG's banner, and I will post an invitation to the Mid-Willamette Valley
LUG and the Eugene LUG and see about contacting the Bend LUG.  I believe
Ed Sawicki (Biznix) and Marvin Kosmal (CLUG) read this list, so they 
will know about it.  Also time permitting (seems unlikely), I will try
to update my "Linux in Oregon" flyer and get some of the printed.



                                          Sincerely,

gOCR has rudimentary forms support that could probably be hacked to do
OMR, but it'd probably be almost as much trouble as coding it up in Perl.
I dunno if gOCR has support for registration marks.

If it includes support, that's not a bad price.  Small market means
less economy of scale.

I think an OSS OMR app would be a handy thing, and might be valuable both
to the Blackbox Voting project and the Open Source Education foundation.
I ain't got the time or inclination to write one, but maybe some CS
student could be convinced to do it for a bounty.

This sounds like kind of an interesting problem.  Basically, you want
a scan of a blank original, rotate and scale (as necessary) the marked
form to best-fit the original, then (at some granularity) diff the two
images.

But, no, I don't want to do it.

Try right-clicking on the icon, selecting 'Properties', and then
clicking the button that shows the current icon.

   It's looking more reasonable to buy a used OMR page scanner. I know that
some of them provide the output in ASCII and tell the user what the signals
are so they can be captured and used.

Right-clicking on the icon and selecting 'Properties' gives me a window 
"Properties for firefox - KDesktop" which shows the icon, and says it's 
"Type" is "Shell Script". The icon itself has no button, and does not 
respond to clicking or right-clicking.

Ah! I see the problem. The icons I have were not created as a "Link to 
application", but are simpler links to startup scripts. When I look at 
the properties of other icons, I can change the image of the icon. I've 
created new icons that let me change their images, and they work as they 
should. Now, what I need to do is to find suitable icons from Mozilla. 
I'll go check their site.

Thanks for the nudge in the right direction.

I did see one optical mark reader program on sourceforge:
 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqs-xml/
 
It looks like it might do what you want;  however, the site appears
to be all in Japanese.  Your chance to brush up on your Kanji.

BTW,
This looks like a good opportunity for a small web-based business
for one of our lesser-employed members.  Fax the form images to XYZ
corp, and get the results back via email.  Easier than setting up
the software if the need is only occasional, and easy to scale from
a part-time job to a normal business.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0507182055160.3576@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   As I washed the dinner dishes I thought of how to re-structure the form
I'll be  using. I can eliminate 7 bubble columns (leaving a total of 10) and
print it all on a page 82.5mm wide. We'll use a paper slicer to cut off the
excess.

   This width form will let me use a portable OMR reader that retails for $750
and can read up to 12 columns (plus 2 timing tracks). That's about the lowest
cost solution I've found. And, with TeX and PSTricks, printing the
appropriate size bubbles in exactly the right places is almost trivial; just
a lot of trial-and-error or very careful measuring.

Thanks all,

Rich

Sounds like an automake macro is missing or not liking Windows.

Sure you have a current version of gmp?

I went into to check my RH 8 or 9 box that has been running since 2000 this
morning.  The screen was frozen and my keyboard was flashing.  I attempted
to reboot and received several messages.  One was kernel panic.  Another
reboot attempted went to the message of uncompressing linux. crc error.
System halted.  One other attempt noticed that the system had shut down
uncleanly.  It went through some of the filesystem checks and halted with
CPU content corrupted.

What to do at this point????  I think my system is hosed.

TIA,

If the HD isn't totally hosed, you might try to fit the machine out with 
a new HD, load your distro, then try to mount the old HD on another IDE 
channel(?) and copy off what you need.

A failing hard drive could definitely cause a kernel panic.  So could
bad RAM, or any manner of other hardware problems.  But the noise from
the hard drive sounds like a giveaway.

I would suggest migrating any important data off of that drive as soon
as you get the chance.  Start with personal data: email archives,
photos, documents, any scripts you might have written, etc.  Unless
you've done a lot of heavy customization, I wouldn't recommend trying
to preserve the system itself.  Get a new hard drive, and upgrade from
RH 8 or 9 to FC 3 or 4.

Dick, et al.:

   If the drive's flaky, it may not withstand another boot. My inclination
would be to format and partition a new drive in another machine, install
whatever distribution was desired, then network the two boxes (even if the
second one is borrowed just for the occasion) and copy across what's desired
to be saved. Then the current machine can be shut down, the hard drives
swapped, and the system rebooted.

Bad fans make "wurn wurn wurn" noises before they die totally.
Check your CPU fan.

Your errors sound more like mobo/CPU/RAM problems to me.

Subject: [PLUG] Scriptless Portknocking

Hi all,

   Just saw this and had to share it with all of you.. 
   I have been interested in portknocking for a while now but hate the fact
that you have to run scripts to check log files etc... It just seems clunky,
at least for my needs. I only wanted to use it as an extra level of basic
connection protection. You can really do some neat things with port knocking
like sending encrypted passwords via icmp packets etc. But this wasnt what I
was looking for. I just wanted something that would block John Q Scanner
from seeing ssh open and then taking his time to try to crack it. Plus I
didnt want to have to install a little script on every client to access the
machines. 
   Well to make a long story short I ran accross this little fedora iptables
entry:

-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 -m
recent --rcheck --name SSH -j ACCEPT
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 9022 -m
recent --name SSH --remove -j DROP
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 9023 -m
recent --name SSH --set -j DROP
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 9024 -m
recent --name SSH --remove -j DROP

   I wasnt aware of the --name and --rcheck ability in IPTABLES. With these
you can telnet to port 9023 (line3) and it will start tagging all packets
from your host(and only your host) with the name SSH. Then you will be
allowed to access port 22 (SSH) via the --rcheck (line1). When you are
finished just telnet to 9022 or 9044 to stop tagging your traffic (closing
the ssh port). One thing to note is the double entries for the shutdown. At
first I wasnt sure why there were two then I though of scans.. Whether its a
top down or bottom up scan it will always turn the naming off. 
   Sorry I just got so excited when I saw this. How elegant and powerful
this is! 
   Hope you all enjoy it as much as I have...

Thanks for your time,
Jeff M.

Sorry you missed it! It was a small session - I think there were more

If you want a "real" printed copy of Ubuntu (both live and install 
versions), Free Geek ordered a thousand. I'm sure they have some left

Some of the tools on Knoppix can help. After backing up critical stuff
as suggested by others, you can use Knoppix to try backing up the entire
drive - I'd try the following commands (dd_rescue, in reverse read mode,
saved all of the data from a crunchy laptop drive about 4 months ago):

dd
dd_rescue

Aaron,

I used some canned air on the CPU fan.  Things quieted down and it pc is
still running at this time.  Obviously, I need a new CPU fan. I found an old
one and it still has some of the connection goop on it.  Will alcohol clean
that off???

TIA,

Jim

Yeah thats correct. Its the /etc/sysconfig/iptables from fedora.. As far as I can tell the commands are valid iptables commands. I think fedora just uses its own naming convention "RH-Firewall-1" for the iptables chain. In most cases I think INPUT is used as the chain descriptor. One way to verify what your chains are is to do a "service iptables status" this will show you your chains, their names, and what rules are currently applied. If you replace the "RH-Firewall-1-INPUT" with the name of your chain and run "iptalbes $TestString" then it should apply your string to the running iptables. Then just do another status to verify that.
Sorry I am a bit of a noob at this. hope this helps.

Message-ID: <1121809981.19256.15.camel@dagon.fnordora.org>

Portland Linux/Unix Group Advanced Topics

Speaker:            Eric Wilhelm

Subject:            Rapid Development with a Safety Net
                 
Date:               July 20th 2005
Time:               7:00pm - 9:00pm

Location:           Jax 826 SW 2nd Ave
                    Portland, OR

The talk will be on building multiple versions of software without
unexpected adverse difficulties. (And still have it work.)

The following is the outline as provided by Eric:

INFO

Audience:
  developers
  involved administrators
  consultants / integrators
  interested others

Description:
  The talk will follow the basic outline below, quickly covering typical
  version control layouts and usage.  Fairly thorough coverage of the
  perl/python library path structure (depending on audience
  familiarity.)

  I would expect the audience to bring some familiarity with system
  administration and program installation.  Developers will probably
  benefit more than administrators, but most admins have at least
  written a bit of perl code and would definitely benefit from a less
  ad-hoc approach to this (especially if they have trouble with
  different versions of custom scripts on multiple machines.)

  I would like to break into ad-hoc discussion about extending the
  concept into compiled code and large projects.  I think the audience
  would have more thoughts on handling dependencies and dealing with
  various package management systems.  These are somewhat hairy areas,
  and the conclusion may be that you only want to use this approach when
  the complexity is easily managed.

  I think discussion of a chroot approach would fit as well.

  The "stupid question threshold" would be down around an understanding
  of filesystems and code vs binary, so anyone with a few years
  experience and no fear of the command line should be able to keep up.


OUTLINE

Motivations:
  code development
  project tracking
  casual contribution

Traditional approach:
  make && make test && make install
  what sort of troubles copies cause
  why this is tedious if you're developing interpreted code
  why this is difficult if you're tracking multiple versions

Basics:
  version control (svn/cvs/svk)
    trunk, branch, etc.
    vendor branches, external
  symlinks
  locations
    /usr/local/svn_stuff/
    /usr/local/stow/
        etc.
    $PATH
    $PERL5LIB
        $PYTHONPATH

Interpreted code:
  perl, python, ruby, lisp

Compiled code:
  C, C++

Issues:
  Dependencies
  Package management systems
  broken symlinks
  unexpected behavior?


Usual meeting rules apply. Happy Hour meal prices for the first hour.

UNWIRE PORTLAND SCHEDULES PUBLIC WORKSHOP;
City Commissioner Sam Adams Keynote Speaker
__________________________________________________________________

A public workshop has been scheduled to provide the public an opportunity 
to learn about the Unwire Portland project and for project partners to 
gather community comment for an upcoming Request for Proposals (RFP) 
process. The workshop is scheduled for Thursday, July 28 from 5:00-7:00 
p.m. at the Oregon Association of Minority Entrepreneurs, 4134 N. Vancouver 
Avenue. City Commissioner Sam Adams will be the keynote speaker at the 
workshop.

On June 29, Portland City Council approved a proposal for a citywide 
wireless Internet network, hoping to give the city and its residents a 
lower-cost alternative to high-speed Internet services springing up across 
the metro area. The City will now issue an RFP for services on a citywide 
wireless network.

Commissioner Adams will welcome participants and talk briefly about why 
Portland City Council unanimously supports this effort. "This project will 
bring universal access to Portland, making us better connected to the world 
and better connected to each other," Commissioner Adams said. "The end 
result is increased prosperity for the city's residents, small businesses, 
schools and transit system."

City of Portland's Chief Technology Officer Matt Lampe will present 
information regarding the project mission and the RFP process. "The project 
is a great example of public agencies coming together to leverage their 
strengths to promote a new technology deployment while creating new 
commercial options for the public," said Matt Lampe.

Attendees can find out more about the project and its benefit by visiting 
five input stations staffed by members of the Steering Committee 
representing TriMet, Portland Public Schools, small business, technology 
and city services.

The City is pursuing the development of a network through an innovative 
public-private partnership. The three core public partnersthe City of 
Portland, Portland Public Schools and TriMetdeveloped the RFP to attract a 
private company or partnership to install and manage the network using no 
new public funds. The selected network developer would build the network 
using the public partners' assets, such as street lights, traffic signals, 
school buildings or radio towers to install the wireless equipment. The 
partners would also be early users of the network, providing the developer 
revenues to support network development while providing cost-saving access 
solutions to the City and other public agencies. The network would be open 
to multiple Service Providers to provide retail Internet access for 
Portland businesses and residents.

After considering public input from the workshop, the Committee plans to 
release the RFP in late August. More information on the workshop and Unwire 
Portland can be found on the web at: www.pdc.us/unwire.  Sponsors of the 
workshop include the City of Portland's Bureau of Technology Services, 
Portland Development Commission (PDC), and the Unwire Portland Steering 
Committee. The Steering Committee is comprised of representatives from the 
Mayor's office, the offices of Commissioners Sam Adams and Erik Sten, 
Bureau of Technology Services, Alliance of Portland Neighborhood Business 
Associations, Portland Public Schools, TriMet and PDC.

Message-ID: <42DDE793.5010304@frogleg.net>

Hi kids,

For one of my clients I configured a FreeBSD box. It lives in a virtual 
server hosting contract, with root access. My main task is to develop 
and install a XML gateway for osCommerce. I shouldn't have touched the 
server in the first place (I'm not a sysadmin), because now it looks 
like it is hacked and hosts a psyBNC IRC Bouncer which proxies away 
happily all day.

I promised my client to ask around and get an idea of how much it would 
cost to have someone look at it and fix the security issues.

Is there anybody interested in such a quick (I hope) job?

Thanks!

Holger

Can just replace only the fan itself?  Forgive me if I am wrong, but it
sounds like your replacement unit to which you are referring is a
different fan and the heat sink to which that fan is attached.
Otherwise, I'm confused as to what "goop" would be on the fan.  CPU fans
are not very expensive.

If I am correct in my inference and you want to use your alternate heat
sink/fan combo, the goop/residue you see is most likely either thermal
compound which is probably composed of a silicone and zinc oxide or the
remnants of a thermal pad which is composed of a phase-change chemical
in a binder.  In either case, the friction of you rubbing the applicator
is going to do more work than the alcohol you are applying with said
applicator, and then it will likely just push it around.  It is unlikely
that the material on your sink is alcohol-soluble.

You can take a razor blade and soft cloth and scrape/rub off the residue
as best you can, being careful to not mar the surface of the heat sink
as best as is possible.  Then reapply a very (very!) thin layer of
thermal compound.  You don't need to bother with Artic Silver or other
"high performance" compounds; the thermal benefits are not necessary for
standard applications.  CPU silicone is sufficient for most standard
uses.

By the way, do the best to keep the stuff off your hands.  It's a pain
get off of skin/clothes/pets.

Subject: [PLUG] Correct Use of Python's RE module
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0507221126340.11194@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   After processing a list of strings into a list of all possible pairs of
strings I have a collection of strings that look like this example:

"Jobs", "Business_variety"

   I want to strip off the quotation marks and replace the ',' with ' -> '
using python's regular expression module. What I have so far are these four
lines:

     p = re.compile('"')
     bar = p.sub('','"')
     q = re.compile(", ")
     bar = q.sub(" -> ", ", ")

   I'm not sure that I understand how to define and compile the search string,
then replace it with the desired string, or lack thereof. Will the above
produce the output:

Jobs -> Business_variety

?

TIA,

Rich

Just a quick note.
I will write more this weekend - probably Sunday.

Scott Kveton from OSU-OSL talked to me about OSCON.
And then OSCON called me about PLUG and OSCON.

I told them we will be there.
PLUG will share a booth with LinuxFund which will be open to all
the Oregon LUGs like we have done in past years.
I'm also taking time off, so I can be there.

Subject: [PLUG] Python docs for string manipulation?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0507221145090.11194@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Looking at the docs for python-2.4 I cannot find a dictionary of what can
be done with strings. For example, in the doc for the RE module is the
suggestion that replacement of a single character can be quicker using the
.translate() function on a string. However, I cannot find a list of functions
that operate on strings, and how they're called. The 'string' module has been
deprecated but the library reference has a short section on that module.

   I know two other string functions are .split() and .join(). But, where's
the documentation for these and others to be found?

Thanks,

Rich

   Well, trial-and-error succeeds once again. This does work!

When I boot the machine with the jumper removed, the BIOS does not see 
the CD drive.

I successfully installed SuSE 9.1 from the single CD that uses the 
network connection to do most of the work.

I tried booting from the 9.3 install CD and it still hangs at the point 
where it's "Searching for info file...".

I'm going to try the SuSE 9.2 single CD install next.

Message-ID: <42E2533E.4010801@comcast.net>

It has occurred to me to wonder if my problem might be with the media 
I'm using (CD-R's from Office Max on sale over a year ago), and I'm 
wondering how to check the quality of the burned image.

Is there a way to run md5sum on the burned image? I ran md5sum on each 
of the downloaded image files for the SuSE 9.3 CD set and got a match 
against the numbers provided, each time. If md5sum can be run on the 
burned CD, how would I do it -- what do I call the "file" I want it to 
check? For example, md5sum SUSE-9.3-Prof-i386-CD1.iso is what I typed to 
check the file before burning. But, md5sum /media/cdrom results in:
md5sum: /media/cdrom: Is a directory

Do I need to mount the CD differently? This is what mount reports:

/dev/hdc on /media/cdrom type subfs 
(ro,nosuid,nodev,fs=cdfss,procuid,unhide,iocharset=utf8)

Thanks for any ideas.

With or without mounting? I tried it with the CD mounted. I typed:

 > md5sum /dev/hdc

There was no response on the console for several minutes, although there 
was a light blinking on the CD drive. It blinked quickly for about 14 
blinks, and then was steady for the span of two or three blinks before 
repeating. Is it possible that I just didn't wait long enough? I copied 
the "> md5sum /dev/hdc" for this e-mail from Konsole, but typed <ctrl-C> 
before remembering that Konsole expects me to highlight, right-click, 
and select copy from a context menu. <ctrl-C> closed md5sum.

I'll be away from the keyboard for at least a 1/2 hour, so I'll leave it 
running md5sum and see what I get when I come back.

Yes, it is possible! I've often had a problem with patience when it

I have SuSE 9.1 loaded on the subject machine. I'll try running md5sum 
on the CD mounted on the drive in that machine.

Obviously, I'm grasping at straws, here. Two CD's I've gotten from other 
sources load and install on the machine. Two CD's I've downloaded and 
burned, load but don't install.

By using K3Bs image burning tool -- in other words, I don't know exactly 
how. But, I know that it is different from just creating a data CD. If 
you need better details of what K3B says and asks for, I'll have to 
reboot, since after the machine's been running for awhile, K3B hangs 
when it starts up.

I wondered about whether the burn was accurate, which is why I was 
trying the md5sum approach to verifying the integrity. I'm puzzled by 
the different md5sum results from two separate machines, both of which 
are running the same version of SuSE, and thus, I assume, the same 
version of md5sum.

Versions are not an issue with `md5sum`. MD5 is a defined algorithm the
only way to produce different results with the same data is to have a
bug. In order to do the job it is supposed to do differing versions of
`md5sum` *MUST* *NOT* produce differing results!

So this leaves the question open of what is happening. The obvious one is
that the CD wasn't quite burned within specs. Possibly a couple ones
aren't as long as they should be, or a couple zeros are too long. One
drive reads them as ones and the other as zeros. The upper layers of
error correction were successful with one drive, but the error correction
on the other drive wasn't successful (one read enough bits correctly to
compensate). This tends to point to a marginally burned CD, some drives
manage to read it correctly, other drives fail. This in turn means get a
new CD (or new drive which is better with CD-Rs).

Thanks. I guess the first and easiest step is to locate some higher 
quality CD-Rs and try burning again. Since K3B is just a front-end to 
cdrecord, I assume that running cdrecord from the command line would not 
produce a different result by itself.

IIRC the subject of quality media came up on this list in the past, so 
I'll go looking in the archives for those recommendations.

I didn't mention it, but the CD drive that gave good results, while on 
the same machine as the burner, is a read only drive, so maybe it's 
possible that a different drive in the other machine might work. I 
guess, since other CD's work in it, there is still some question as to 
whether the burner is doing a proper job.

You could also try burning at a slower speed, especially if your media 
is old or lower quality, or if the reading drive is marginal.

If you run md5sum more than once, do you get the same result?  If you
get differing results, you need to check your memory.
(http://www.memtest86.com/ is your friend.)  I have had this happen, so
I know it is possible.

If things are hanging after a while, it sounds like you have a heat
related hardware problem.  Check memory first, since it is easiest to
replace.  Also check that all the cables are snug.  (Sometimes the
changes in temperature will cause them to work their way out of the
socket.)  If you have diagnostics for motherboard and CPU temperatures,
check those.  Sometimes it is in the bios screen at boot or through
lm_sensors.  (lm_sensors does not always work.  Depends on if it has a
chipset that is supported.)

Also make sure that your vents and fans are not clogged with dust and/or
cat fur.  

It could also be the burner flaking out.  

Another thing to check for is bad capacitors.  See if any are bulging
and/or leaking.  If they are, replace the motherboard.  (Unless you are
REAL good with a soldering iron.)

That is all I can think of at the moment...

Acrobat Pro will let you export, and there's probably some google hack
to do it, since you can open any PDF link as HTML.  IIRC, there is
also at least one Perl module on CPAN for PDF.

Have you looked to see if you have pdf2text or pdf2ascii on your system?
 I don't, but I do have pdf2ps and ps2ascii....

"pdftotext" can do that, assuming the PDF is real text rather than
bitmap images.  So can ghostview in Windows.  And Acrobat Reader will
often let you cut-and-paste text from a PDF.

In Debian and Ubuntu, pdftotext is in the xpdf-utils package.

Good luck,

K3B is the only program that causes the hang. Normally, the machine is 
up for weeks, and would be longer if I didn't need to burn something.

A valid point, but it wasn't too long ago that I had the box open and 
checked for those things. It wasn't too bad, and I took out a couple of 
dust bunnies.

> It could also be the burner flaking out.  

Or possibly one that is just cheap. I've had this one, purchased for 
about $35, for about a year (+/- a couple of months). I have had other 
occasions where a CD I burned on it was not readable on one other 
machine, and yet was readable on several other machines. Burning longer 
was recommended, and that's what I'm going to try next.

Now it'll bootup to winduhs and then shuts down after 5-10 seconds.  I'm

Try a knoppix/whatever live CD or something.  Boot, play tuxracer, run 
folding-at-home, encode mp3's, or other suitable heat-generating 
computationally intensive task and see if it is stable.  If so, maybe 
just wipe XP, install linux and problem-solved :-)

 I went through something like this a year ago and thought I was having a
thermal problem.  Sometimes my XP box would boot OK and run for a while,
other times it wouldn't completely boot without croaking.  It turned out to
be a bad memory stick.  I found this out after running a little boot
diagnostic my 13 year old son found for me (doh!). This is my second attempt

Memtest86 is a better app.  http://www.memtest86.com/ It is free and
runs off a boot floppy or cd.

Sounds very much like a loose connection somewhere to me.  Open up the

Subject: [PLUG] Thunderbird Issues
Message-ID: <42E4F3F1.4090604@comcast.net>

I've switched to Thunderbird for a few features it has that I like 
better than Konqueror -- multiple address books, better address 
groupings, etc.

One feature that isn't working is being able to click on a link and have 
it open in a browser. I found some instructions that said to create a 
user.js file. If I understood it correctly, it wants to find that file 
in the same directory as the program file. I have one there, but it 
still doesn't work. The contents of the file are below.

Another, slightly related question. I installed the program in the 
directory where I downloaded it. I'm guessing that there is a preferred 
place to put such things. If so, where is it?

Dick,

   I cannot answer this; perhaps Pamela could.

   I installed it in /usr/local on Pamela's ThinkPad. It has been happily
working there.

Just add them to /etc/hosts, pointing to localhost... helps if you
have a reject rather than a drop rule in iptables (i.e. faster).

The user.js file lives in the thunderbird profile directory in $HOME. On 
a Linux box, the path would be something like

* $HOME/.thunderbird/ptvdt5yx.default/user.js

Under OS X, it's

* $HOME/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles/tt69vp2w.default/user.js

The actual name of your profile directory will be slightly different.

You're right, I could maintain a blacklist in iptables, but what I want is
to have the list in the browser.  I want to be able to maintain it the way I
maintain a list of bookmarks (visually).

If you mean a blacklist of websites, I'm sure you could use Adblocker
in FireFox, and there may even be an extension especially for the
purpose.  Of course, someone who's even mildly technical (e.g. nearly
anyone younger than 18) would probably be able to find a way around it.
See: https://addons.mozilla.org

If you need a real web-filtering system, use DansGuardian, either on
the box as a daemon or on a separate router.  (I think IPCop supports it.)

A blacklist of web sites.
It would be nice to be able to add/remove sites and organize them just like
you do with the bookmarks.  Then the browser would not follow a link or
redirect to a URL on the blacklist, probably just putting out a warning
instead.

Most browsers have a "Bookmarks" toolbar button.  Do you think that they 
should have a "Blacklist" button too?  Besides, you don't need to sort 
your blacklists by directories do you?

(heh. click Blacklist -> "Blacklist This Page")

Privoxy is a good filtering proxy.  I don't think you want to replicate 
this functionality in a browser just for the sake of having a menu 
item.  Maybe you could hack the mozilla or konqueror code to have a 
right-click menu item "blacklist image location" that would send the 
info to privoxy.

In the default setup, privoxy uses regular expressions and prefabricated 
blacklists that catch most of the junk.  You can also whitelist.  All 
of this is in text files, so you just edit them with a visual text 
editor ;-)

Now, if all of this is too inconvenient, you could make a "Blacklist" 
bookmarks folder and have dnotify or FAM (or cron if you're that 
patient) watching your bookmarks file with a perl script mirroring 
everything from that bookmark folder into the privoxy blacklist 
configs.  Repeat for a Whitelist folder (and maybe one for regex's 
too. :-)  Note the tasty *nix flavor.  Too bad bookmarks are usually 
not-so-tasty XML instead of some more filesystemish approach (that 
would let all users on a system symlink to shared global folders (not 
to mention rsync!))

Thanks, Paul. I keep forgetting about those hidden directories.

I've moved my user.js file to:

/home/rsteff/.thunderbird/dwzk6z2d.default

I shut down and restarted thunderbird, but nothing happens when I click 
on a link. If I right click on one I get options to "Select All", "Copy 
Link Location", and "Save Link Target As...", but nothing to open the link.

Is there anything wrong with the entries in my user.js file?

"/home/rsteff/Downloads/firefox-installer/firefox" is the 235 line shell 
script provided by Mozilla for starting firefox, and is what I have the 
icon on the desktop pointing to. That works. I assume that's what 
thunderbird should be trying to use, too.

Is it, by any chance, opening the location in a browser window that
already exists? (perhaps one that has been minimized?)

Alas, no. I've tried it with Firefox not running before I start, and 
with Firefox loaded. It doesn't make any difference.

I think I miss-understood what you're trying to do.  You may be trying 
baseball with a tennis racket.

When you say open with Firefox do you mean a file on your system, a link 
in a web page/site or in an e-mail?

Most probably your Desktop manager needs to know what to do with *.htm[l] 
files.  This will also apply the way things are handled by Thunderbird and 
friends.

I'm at work stuck on a WinXP system so can't really check my setup.

What happens when you double-click a file on your system that ends with a 
.html?

In an e-mail. In Thunderbird, I click on a link provided in an e-mail 
and nothing happens. When I did so while using KMail, the link would 
open in Konqueror. On a Winders system, clicking on a link in an e-mail 
in Thunderbird opens the link in whichever browser is known as the 
default. Before I changed it to Firefox, it would open in IE.

Apparently not. Thunderbird did nothing before I installed Firefox even 
though the Desktop manager understood Konqueror to be the default browser.

> What happens when you double-click a file on your system that ends with a 
> .html?

Such a file opens in Konqueror, which is fine with me. I actually prefer 
Konqueror for most of my browsing. There are some sites that check to 
see which browser you are using and if its not on their "preferred list" 
tell you that their site won't work for you and that you should upgrade 
to a "better" browser. I put Firefox on my SuSE machine to handle those 
sites. I put it on my Winders machine because it's better and safer than IE.

   A google search for "+thunderbird +url" returned 678,000 hits. On the first
page is this: <http://gentoo-wiki.com/TIP_Integrate_Thunderbird_and_Firefox>,
and it includes:

I'm looking to buy a new video card, something with some nice 3D
capabilities. I've always bought nVidia cards in the past, but I'm
wondering if ATI would be as good or better for Linux. It seems like
you get more bang for the buck with ATI now, but I'm not sure (I
haven't been up on video cards for a couple years). I know nVidia has
closed-source, downloadable drivers for Linux. How are ATI's drivers
handled?

Suppose you wanted to spend $150 or less on a good video card for
Linux, which card on ENU's list would you buy:

I'm far from an expert on the subject, but I went through seven 
stages of hell trying to get the ATI video in a Compaq R4000 laptop 
to work at something besides VESA 1024 x 768. Never 
succeeded. Gave up and returned the laptop to HP. Instead I 
bought an older version of the same laptop that had NVidia video. 
When I installed Ubuntu 5.04 it recognized it and auto-configured it 
at 1650 x 1080. Beautiful. 

ATI would have to pay me to take one of their products. And I mean 
a lot of money.

I don't have any ATI experience in linux either.  But nvidia has always
been a breeze, and support for the glx driver is in most package
management systems, like portage, apt, etc.  Or you can get the driver
from nvidia's website, and run it with the --force-update switch,
meaninng you never have to get a new driver to keep up to date - running
the old one always gets you the latest driver with NO brain-time.  I run
it every time I build a new kernel (because I have to, as it is a kernel
module).

I think the nvidia driver also supports AMD64.  It sure seemed that way
when I installed it on this 64 bit box they gave me at work.  500 fps -
wow!

ATI cards with 3D supported by the open-source drivers (mostly older
Radeons) are the best option.  If you want a newer card, the fglrx
drivers suck ass.  They are horribly unstable and a general PITA.  The
nVidia binary drivers are much, much, much better.

Generally ATi is slightly more power per dollar, but notorious for bad
drivers. nVIDIA is legendary for high-quality drivers (both Linux and
less-abled "OSes"). If you want the 3D capabilities then you'll be a
slave to the binary drivers, luckily both companies offer them.

nVIDIA's GF5### chips turned out to be a lemon generation, somewhat
faster but not really much better than the GF4### chips (but they still
had good drivers). The more recent GF6### and GF7### cards look to be
extremely good though. ATi's R9### chips were an awesome generation, but
they've been followed by the unimpressive RX### chips. At the moment
ATi's X800 is now a generation behind nVIDIA's GF7880, in theory they
should be coming out with something soon but that was originally expected
*months* ago.

If your motherboard supports PCIe cards, the MSI NX6600-TD256E is a
mid-end one generation back card. Otherwise it seems that ENU's selection
of nVIDIA cards is rather sparse right now.  :-(

Wow. ATI actually made an effort to support their cards on Linux.  That 
puts them at least a few years behind nvidia, and of course it's a 
proprietary driver.

In either case, your kernel will be tainted (causes trouble if you're 
reporting kernel bugs.)  Guess there's some tasty IP tangled into that 
driver code that keeps them from opening it.

>nVidia binary drivers are much, much, much better.

At least they've been releasing them for Linux longer.  That's why I 
went with nvidia 2.5 years ago (wow, I guess this dual 4800 is a 
dinosaur now!)  I get some crashes, but it's hard to say whether that 
comes from the motherboard, onboard sound, usb, smp, xinerama, or that 
PCI TNT2 card running the third monitor.  Probably a combination of 
things (something about running out of IRQ's)  If you're going 
single-head and single-cpu, then nvidia is pretty stable.

One caveat:  nvidia doesn't produce their own boards.  They only do the 
chips, so there will be plenty of various brands selling boards with 
nvidia chips.  These are not all created equal!  Namely, MSI is really 
bad.  I'll just take another opportunity to say "stay away from MSI."

MSI is really bad.

BTW, Do not buy an MSI graphics card (or anything else for that matter.)

Look for a card manufacturer with firmware on their website (last I 
looked nvidia says to get the firmware from the card manufacturer.)  
Low quality outfits (like MSI) tell you to get the firmware updates 
from nvidia.

Fans and other bits also fail (or make noise) on cheaper cards.  You get 
what you pay for.

Could anyone with a more pleasant nvidia experience name some quality 
card manufacturers?

I switched to Thunderbird after Evolution died on me a few months back.
 I like it... but have a few pet peeves-

There's no "Reply to list" !!  Bah.  How disgusting that something so
important should be missing.

I have many email addresses that are sent to my "rob" user.  Thunderbird
is completely braindead about this - I can't have multiple identities
under a single IMAP box, so I create dummy identities.  But if somebody
mails rob at axpr.net and I hit reply, it defaults to athlonrob at axpr.net,
my default identity, becahse that's the email address associated with
the imap box.  Most other mail clients I've used will pick up the email
being addressed to a different identity on the box...

Kmail supports all the stuff I want, FWIW, it's UI is just so crappy and
web-page-feeling I can't stand to use it for more than a day at a time.

You remember how crappy ATi's drivers were ten years ago?

They're that bad under Linux, from what I understand.....

nVidia's drivers suck and are binary-only, but they work most of the
time and provide enough performance for most people.

The quick and easy way to find answers to questions like these is to
fire up the interactive interpreter and use the built-in dir() function:

$ python
Python 2.4.1 (#1, May 16 2005, 15:19:29) 
[GCC 4.0.0 20050512 (Red Hat 4.0.0-5)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> dir('')
['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__', '__doc__',
'__eq__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__', '__getnewargs__',
'__getslice__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__le__', '__len__',
'__lt__', '__mod__', '__mul__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__',
'__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__rmod__', '__rmul__', '__setattr__',
'__str__', 'capitalize', 'center', 'count', 'decode', 'encode',
'endswith', 'expandtabs', 'find', 'index', 'isalnum', 'isalpha',
'isdigit', 'islower', 'isspace', 'istitle', 'isupper', 'join', 'ljust',
'lower', 'lstrip', 'replace', 'rfind', 'rindex', 'rjust', 'rsplit',
'rstrip', 'split', 'splitlines', 'startswith', 'strip', 'swapcase',
'title', 'translate', 'upper', 'zfill']

(The empty string '' is an instance of a string, so dir('') tells you
all the methods defined for the class.  Try also "dir({})" and "dir([])"
for added fun.)

I would go with nVIDIA.

ATI only supports some of their current chipsets with the linux driver.  
The speed is not that good with the default x.org driver.

nVIDIA supports all of their current and older chipsets. The driver is 
easy to install.

That page does not give me a good idea of the chipsets involved, so I 
cannot give much in the way of recomendations.

Message-ID: <4d8a8fadc4364dde6931e9fc4944a415@gmail.com>

I know there are a lot of Perl experts here, so I thought I would ask 
about a problem I have.

I have a very large file that is exported from an application. Its all 
one line and more than 3000 characters so sed/awk bails out on me, I 
suggested Perl might be a good choice, but we are having problems with 
the regex matching. There are no delimiters, but each field starts with 
a constant prefix and is a fixed length.

What I want to do in English is to find this string plus the next 80 
characters (combination of text and whitespace, and replace it with the 
same string + a replacement string + fill the remaining spaces with 
whitespace. What's the best way to do this? Just to give you a point of 
reference, we are replacing actual customer names with something like 
John Doe.

Thanks for your help!

Ah ... yes. Something like

$hugestring =~ s/NAME=.{80}/NAME=${newname}/g;

where "$newname" contains "John Doe" followed by 72 spaces, etc.

The context indicates you've been given some kind of database dump, 
sadly not the traditional comma-separated or tab-separated value format 
with text strings enclosed in quotes and terminated by newlines. Is it 
possible to get the application to export in such a format, which would 
make this a rather simple loop?

I'm also guessing you don't want to replace every person's name with 
"John Doe" but a different name for each original name. So rather than 
use a one-shot replace command, you somehow might need to break the 
string up into individual records, replace each name field with a random 
one, then reassemble the string. Is that correct? If so, is there any 
kind of "record separator" in your input string?

Finally, do you need to re-import the resulting string back into the 
application?

Subject: [PLUG] Questions about vgetty and mgetty...
Message-ID: <1121820091.42dd9dbb56c5f@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I have a working vgetty and a working mgetty configuration.  The 
default for vgetty is voice:fax:data.  I truncated that to voice 
because I don't want a caller to get a modem in their ear.  Is 
there a way to allow the caller to indicate that a modem call is 
coming and have mgetty answer the next call instead?  Is there a 
way to implement a dial menu with vgetty, press 1 for modem call, 
2 to leave a message?  The ability to leave a message is an 
improvement, but I want to do full blown remote control.

One option, if this can be done, is to record a person requesting
modem service, record them saying modem for example. I'm thinking
do a comparison between the last message and that recording.
So you call and vgetty asks for a message.  You say modem
after the tone and hang up.  A daemon sees that there is a new
message and compares it to a recording of you saying modem made 
earlier.  If there is a match, init is set to call mgetty 
instead and restarted.  If there's an easier approach to solving
this problem that anyone has implemented using vgetty, I'd love 
to hear about it.  

Anyone know of a simple way with vgetty to interpret touch tones 
as commands?  I call and vgetty answers, I want to be able
to press a series of numbers and have vgetty interpret them as
a signal that I want to make a data call.  I'm thinking after
I hang up that a script called by vgetty can switch the modem
to use mgetty instead for like the next ten minutes.

Subject: [PLUG] Sorry to hear about the bike theft, modem question...
Message-ID: <1121900993.42ded9c203b13@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I have a working vgetty and a working mgetty configuration.

I want to run vgetty by default and offer a remote control
so that a person can switch the computer to mgetty.  I'm 
thinking call my number and press 1, a message from my 
machine will tell you the modem is ready for data and 
my machine will end that call.  If vgetty can support
menus.

The script to switch to mgetty should be triggered at this
point.  To make this robust I'm thinking, "you have to try
to call back with your computer within the next five 
minutes or the modem will return to voice mode."

For those who are unfamiliar with PCC's old trail system: 
you used to make a phone call and punch numbers to 
enter you pin, register for classes, etc.  I will be
surprised if there's no way to do this with the
mgetty/vgetty packages.  I want to require a special 
number to change the mode in addition to pressing 1.

With most wikis, you can restrict which users are allowed to make
updates.  So if it's the wikis' openness to modification by the
general public that's turning you off, you might want to look into
using a wiki anyway.  You can configure your wiki so that only you or
people you've selected are allowed to make changes, with read-only
access for everyone else.

You can download wikipedia's engine from sourceforge here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/wikipedia
It needs a MySQL backend.  It's developed for Linux, but since it's
written in PHP, it shouldn't be too problematic to get it running on
Solaris.

Here's a list of other wiki engines: 
http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiEngines

I know you said you said that you weren't really looking for a wiki,
but you haven't said why not.  I'm not sure what your needs are, so
I'm suggesting that a wiki might still suit your situation.  Arguably,
editing html files in vi constitutes a knowledge base app.

Or you can add the 'e' modifier and call a function.

  $hugestring =~ s/NAME=.{80}/
	"NAME=" . make_newname($1)/ex;

Check 'perldoc perlre'.

Of course, you might have a performance issue if $hugestring is that 
huge.  Not sure if you would get a better result using substr() within 
a loop there or not.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0507261010450.31005-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I'm looking for a slick ( one-liner? ) to test if a smbfs is mounted.

I have scripts that mount shares from Win2K servers and process data
files.  Sometimes _stuff(s**t) happens_ and they get mounted twice or
more.  I prefer to not leave them mounted all the time as the processing
times are sparse.

So I'd like to test if the share is already mounted so I don't mount it 
again and if for some reason the share has been mounted multiple times I 
can umount it multiple times.

I've gone over the man pages for test and umount but nothing I tried
worked the way I hoped.  That is just looking for the mount not testing
for some file in the share which can be problematic.

Ideas?


Thanks,
Rod

Hehehehe. I don't want a Wiki. If you don't have any suggestions that fit
my description that's fine, but it's not real productive to suggest
something I specifically said I don't want :)

Yes, but I'm not looking to write code for the front end. MySQL would be
on the back end.

I don't think it's a vague term for at all for people who work in IT.

I'm looking for a place to store operations policies and procedures. An
example of an entry might be a common problem, and the workaround or fix.

There are a lot of programs that do what i'm looking for, if you go to
Freshmeat and search for "knowledge base" you'll see many. I just wondered
if anyone had experience with a specific one they would recommend that
would work with Apache/PHP/MySQL.

A wiki would work for what I'm suggesting, but I don't want to use a wiki.
Call it personal preference.

This works great.  And incase some brain-dead bozo developer ( me ) gets 
on the system and mounts the file system then forgets to un-mount it; 
this, based on your suggestion, works.

while $(cat /proc/mounts | grep smbfs | grep $MOUNTPOINT ) ; \

Thanks Eli.

   OK. Then it has a context-specific meaning that's obtuse for those of us
out of that context.

Can we first vote on which drugs the speakers will be on upon arrival.
I'm sure that will help to define the topic and the amount of
entertainment provided.

Aside from that I would think you might be able to approach some of the
slightly retail oriented companies that will be on the floor at OSCON
this year. I've heard presentations from the SuSE Sales and Engineering
team and some from the Red Hat folks. They've always been very forth
coming with answers to questions and discussions and it's interesting to
hear about their future "road maps" when it comes to desktop Linux, and
engineering support. You might even be able to shoot them an email
directly now. It would surprise me if they did not reply at least to say
"sorry too busy :[ ".

Just an idea.

We had a consultant work on selecting a knowledge base that also needed to
support live web chat sessions.  We finally went with PHPLive and were very
happy with the results (after the normal installation and server
issues).  We used
it to support a call center for customer service via the web site and
direct customer calls.

I found something similar by chasing it through Mozilla's site. But what 
they said was to put those lines in a separate file, user.js.

Here's what's at the top of my prefs.js file:

/* Do not edit this file.
  *
  * If you make changes to this file while the browser is running,
  * the changes will be overwritten when the browser exits.
  *
  * To make a manual change to preferences, you can visit the URL
about:config
  * For more information, see
http://www.mozilla.org/unix/customizing.html#prefs
  */

So, I ignored the "Do not edit" instruction and put those three lines, 
with appropriate changes for my installation, at the bottom of the 
prefs.js file, and now it works!

"Do it THIS way, unless I meant something else." This is starting to 
feel like that comment about standards, "The great thing about standards 
is that there are so many to choose from."

Another thing that doesn't make sense about the comment section above: 
visit the URL about:config? That make sense for Firefox, and indeed 
works, but the concept of visiting a URL with Thunderbird doesn't make 
sense to me. I wonder if this is a comment that belongs in the Mozilla 
combined product, and not in Thunderbird.

Well, thanks to the persistence of many, I have links working in 
Thunderbird. Thanks to all.

Take a look at PHP GroupWare

http://phpgroupware.org

It maybe a lot more than what you need, but it does have a descent KB
feature. There is probably a way to slim it down to just the stuff you
want, and it's free (as in beer).

Alcohol is conflated with the commonly perceived drug group.

Hopefully we can entice the speaker with the promise of the yeast given
drug rather than dragging them away from other good times.

Hi all,

I am looking for a mailing list manager for a very low-traffic list that
uses the bare minimum of memory. Running from inetd would be a nice
feature. I also want to keep using postfix unless there's a compelling
reason to switch.

I have used mailman in the past, but its footprint is just too big for a
64MB UML already strapped for resources.

Thanks for your suggestions,

Hrmpf.  Most folks with the IT background to answer that have also
suffered the painful consequences of jumping to conclusions about what
a person means when they say they want $BUZZWORD. ;)

The RT FAQ Manager may be a good fit; integration between trouble-
tickets and knowledge base really facilitates knowledge-capture.
http://www.bestpractical.com/rtfm/

Note that if you are running a support/service org and you're *not*
using a trouble-ticket system already, get one in place post-haste.
RT is a good one, and its search capabilites make it an effective
knowledge-manager by itself.

Okeedokee.  I'll note that of all the knowledge-base-type sites I
refer to on the net, all but LDP are Wikis.

   For the past several years I've been using majordomo with postfix. My lists
are very low volume and this setup takes no attention from me.

or perhaps

grep $MOUNTPOINT /proc/mounts || action if not mounted
grep $MOUNTPOINT /proc/mounts && action if mounted

depending on which logical construct better fits what you're doing.

for umounting when you have multiples 

if [`grep -c $MOUNTPOINT /proc/mounts` > 1 ]; do umount $MOUNTPOINT; done

should do fine.

Yes, I know :)  That's why I made a point of mentioning I was not looking

I don't think it's a vague term for at all for people who work in IT.

I'm looking for a place to store operations policies and procedures. An
example of an entry might be a common problem, and the workaround or fix.

There are a lot of programs that do what i'm looking for, if you go to
Freshmeat and search for "knowledge base" you'll see many. I just wondered
if anyone had experience with a specific one they would recommend that
would work with Apache/PHP/MySQL.

A wiki would work for what I'm suggesting, but I don't want to use a wiki.
Call it personal preference.

Subject: [PLUG] http -> https redirect
Message-ID: <42E7C06D.4030407@comcast.net>

Hi,

I'm trying to get apache to redirect http requests on a subdirectory,
say http://www.mysite.com/subdir to redirect it to
https://www.mysite.com/subdir.

I've found a nice .htaccess statement to put in the ./subdir directory:

<IfModule !mod_ssl.c>
Redirect permanent / https://www.mysite.com/
</IfModule>

Apache (2.0.x) isn't paying attention to it, even though in httpd.conf
AllowOverride is set to "All".

This seems like a fairly typical thing to have to do, yet I'm stumped.

Please help.

TIA,
Robert

Subject: [PLUG] Unwire Portland public meeting tomorrow
Message-ID: <42E7C8D0.7060007@tercent.com>

The city's project for enabling citywide wireless access -- the Unwire
Portland project -- is holding a public meeting tomorrow (Thursday, 28
July) from 5-7 at OAME, 4134 N. Vancouver, Portland.

Part of the project's requirements is that the implementation give a
public benefit.  Right now, the leading proposal is the "walled garden,"
where a restricted list of sites is made available.

An alternative idea, the "drinking fountain" model, proposes to give
free, unrestricted but low-bandwidth access to all comers.  (See
http://rlucas.tercent.com/wifi.html for my position on the issue.)
I think that the Linux community (with a natural affinity for
information-dense [text] network uses) stands to gain a lot if the
drinking fountain model is adopted.

There will definitely be politicos and commercial vendors there.  It
would be outstanding if we could get some strong representation from the
F/OSS and Linux communities there as well.

I would put the redirect into the httpd.conf file. But if you must use
the .htaccess file, be sure to indlude the proper AllowOverride
directive in httpd.conf to allow this redirect. I'm not sure what this
would be. Perhaps AllowOverride All would work.

 DocumentRoot /srv/www/vhosts/disc.ont.inuo.us/htdocs


Redirect / https://FQDN/


....

Then have a ssl vhost:

(among other things does:)

<VirtualHost _default_:443>

        DocumentRoot "/srv/www/vhosts/ssl-default/htdocs"
        ServerName FQDN:443

...

Hope this helps in your case, if not let me know and I can look at
your configs with you.

You mean so we can be there to protest the use of public funds to
create a virtual monopoly against which private industry cannot offer
alternatives?  Cool!

No more monopolies.  Microsoft, government, anyone.  Free the
airwaves.

If the government's "net" chooses to censor connections to
"unapproved" sites or services, or implements poor intrusive web
proxying and filtering,, we'll never get a chance to have a third
party provide an alternative.  That'll suck.  And you can bet that the
right wingers will want to make sure public airwaves aren't used to
download "porn" or "abortion" information.  End of freedom.

If there is to be a citywide net, the market will provide it.  No need
to use public funds.

I presume this is why you want us there.

Or were you intending some other common voice?

My mind actually is full.  This doesn't work nor variations of it.  I 
finally went with:

while $(grep $mount /proc/mounts > /dev/null mount $MNTDIR/$mount ; done

FYI, there are multiple mounts/shares so this is wrapped in a for ; do 
; done loop and that is where $mount comes from.

Again, thanks for the code.

For WiFi, they already are free.  What's your point?

AFAIK, the city wants to build a net anyway, for its own uses.  Point
of this is that if we're paying for it, we should have unfiltered access.

As for "The Market will provide", there's a PTP meeting tonight...

Yup.  And although I recognize that there's a bigger question here as to
whether and how much the city should be involved in this, the fact is
that it *is* happening and I'd like to help steer it toward freedom- and
utility-maximizing policies.

> Or were you intending some other common voice?

;) Actually, I want *uncommon* voices: people who actually grok the
Internet showing up, instead of just wonks and suits and vendors.

(True, though, my bias is that I do want an unfiltered model for the
free offering, and I figure the techno-anarcho-(capital|commun)ists who
populate LUGs are a good bet for supporting such.)

Best,

Randall

They usually have the mini-discs, but not the business card type.
(Unless I have missed them the last 1,000 times I have visited office
despot.  Not certain about CompUSA.)

Office Despot also have the mini DVDs.

Alan, et al.:

   Mini-disks are fine, too. I want to put a pdf slide presentation (~700K) on
disks to hand out to people. Whether they're completely round or have two
sides cut down doesn't matter to me. It's just such a waste to put a less
than 1M file on a 700M disk.

Thanks,

Rich

Call me skeptical, but I don't think the voices of "unfiltered access"

You're confusing the media establishment and Portland.  They're not the 
same thing.

The public policies of the city of Portland reflect the desires of the 
people to an astonishing degree.  And the people of Portland support 
freedom, openness, and sharing.

Remember that "government" governs behavior, but public agencies are not 
all government.  The public library system is not "the government" because 
they don't tell you what to do (though the library is governed by those 
who decide how to govern the people).

So, government bad -- public resources good.

The City of Portland is going to build a city-wide wireless network of 
undetermined freedom and openness.  However this is constructed, private 
agents will still have the option of offering wireless services 
(overlapping coverage happens all the time), so the public service will 
not prohibit "better" services offered by the private sector.

But at the moment, the City is considering using a private agency for 
design, management, and maintenance of the city-wide network.  If this 
happens, public money will be directly tagged as profits for this private 
agency.  Instead, we can use 100% of the budget for the project to pay 
workers and buy/maintain equipment directly.  Furthermore, a private 
agency running the citywide network will increase the chances of services 
being restricted from free use either so that they can be sold for some 
upgrade charge or to prevent litigation.  A public service would have no 
motivation to limit service based on profit motives and much less 
reason to fear litigation.

Just a comment on why your first response was about wikis....

You asked a fairly poor question.  "Most people in the IT industry" hear
poor questions all the time and immediately attempt to decipher what the
user *meant* to ask.  You stated you didn't want a wiki, but didn't
elaborate as to what you wanted to use your "Knowledge Base" for or why
a wiki was less-than-ideal for your situation.

In an attempt to better understand what your question *should* have
been, I believe the first responders who suggested (questioningly) a
wiki were actually attempting to determine your needs and if what you
were looking for really did fit them.

IMHO, you were a bit short with them... but hey, we all have off days.  :-)

I've purchased several boxes from Fry's in the past for about twenty
bucks per fifty CDs.  They're quite fun... when I was buying them, I was
working on a personalized mini-rescue-CD similar to LNX-BBC.

Since then I just decided to use my USB stick.  :-)

How naive you are, sir.

The economics of providing a private net once a "free" service is
offered subsidized by public funds won't let that fly.

Imagine me trying to construct a private toll road that paralleled
Sunset Highway.  Even if I could get approval from the city, why would
people *pay* to take my road when Sunset Highway already exists?

I'd have to offer something that was *clearly* a premium, and that's
just not going to be economically feasible.

So, effectively, using tax dollars to subsidize what is likely to be
an inferior net (because along with tax dollars comes the republican
agenda) will lock out the opportunity to get a *real* net driven by
market pressures.

Hence, this is a bad idea.  *All* public-works projects for "city wide"
nets are a bad idea.  At least, in a republican-driven world.

Hey, Randal, don't forget it's the Left's agenda to implement such
services for the public at large using public funds in the first place.  :-)

This isn't some vast Republican consipiracy, I can't imagine many
republicans liking such a use of tax dollars.

Uhm.....How would it be even *possible* to create a virtual monopoly, 
on wireless access, to which the private industry *cannot* offer 
alternatives?

Seriously, I don't see how this would even be technically possible. 
Even typical monopoly things like, oh, drinking water and electricity 
and phone services now have numerous *private* alternatives. Sure, the 
public utility drinking water is cheap, but "distilled water" sells 
like gangbusters, and if you don't like the power grid monopolies, you 
can go solar or use other generators, and voice services has 
cell/VoiP/skype/etc...

WiFi uses free spectrum... er... and I'm pretty sure the City of 
Portland can't overrule the FCC.

Again, why not?

Heck, that situation has "incentives for private industry alternative" 
written all over it. I can already imagine the slogans: "Tired of your 
free public WiFi coverage sucking? For only 25 bucks a month, you can 
have citywide WiFi that doesn't suck!"

> And you can bet that the

"Tired of using a public WiFi network that filters out your favorite 
websites? Get citywide WiFi that doesn't suck for only 25 bucks a 
month!"

> If there is to be a citywide net, the market will provide it.  No need
> to use public funds.

Well, if that was true, the market *would* have provided it already, 
no? However, it seems that there was no need to provide it yet, as the 
market was quite happy to keep us locked into more expensive 
technologies (such as cell modems) that don't require larger 
infrastructure investments. As soon as there is market pressure from a 
public utility, private industry has an incentive to invest in building 
additional infrastructure in order to capture that market segment from 
the public sector, and offer a "better" product than an existing public 
service provides...

Think about "free" TV stations vs. cable. "Free" drinking fountains vs. 
bottled water. "Free" parks vs. private country clubs. "Free" public 
concerts vs. private concerts. "Free" downtown public transportation 
vs. cars. In all these cases, (and I'm sure many more), private 
industry offered alternatives, even though there was an existing 
"free/cheap" service, subsidized by the public. In some cases, private 
industry alternatives were actually *created* by the public investment.

Common voice? In F/OSS? LOL!

Er, so, in that case, who will take care of the design, management, and 
maintenance in that case? Instead of one private agency, scores or 
hundreds of little worker/agencies? Who will coordinate those workers'

So, are you proposing that the City create a public, internal, bureau 
of access, and run their own IT for this project? I'm just wondering 
about your ideal vision.

Um, why not?  You seem to be so afraid that the city's network will have 
terrible limitations.  Doesn't that imply that a private company could 
EASILY offer something that is clearly a premium?

Portland isn't Republican-driven.  Playing defense all the time won't do 
anything to improve our offense.

By creating public structures that are superior, we easily undermine the 
(largely unsupportable) reigning dogma that private industry is "the way 
to go".

Well, ideally we would have neighborhood responsibility for design and 
support coordinated citywide.  That's not on anybody's agenda right now, 
unfortunately.

As this network will service city agencies as well as the public, the city 
IT staff should take on the workload in addition to their existing network 
engineering and maintenance tasks.  Of course it will mean a larger staff, 
but only minor incremental management increase.

I would rather see the city diverting public funds directly to projects 
like the PTP Mississippi Avenue unwiring and supplying NNIs into existing 
city internetworking, but the structures just aren't in place at the 
moment to support community-based services.

That's right.  Those lefties are always trying to improve the standard of 
living for all people.  Don't forget that a public, city-wide network is 
THEIR idea!

Of course not.  If it doesn't kill people or subsidize private industry 
directly, the Republicans would vote down that spending in a heartbeat. 
It's all about maintaining traditional economic relationships, after all.

Quick reality check: the network deal is going to get made, PLUG mailing
list exchanges or no.  Our opportunity to help steer it towards the good
is by showing up to this meeting, learning about it, and lobbying our
public officials.

The only "free" service under discussion is the quid pro quo to the
public for using its existing assets (light poles, etc.).  Rest assured,
commercially viable connection speeds on the new net will cost you a
pretty penny.

Right now, though, the "free" service is going to be a fat pipe to the
walled garden.  A skinny (e.g. ~ 10 kpbs) pipe to the unrestricted
Internet is what I'd like to see, instead.

Actually, if we had a hope in hell of getting eminent domain rights to
the necessary land, I'd join you on that project in a minute!  Imagine
who /wouldn't/ pay $2 to be able to go 60 mph to Hillsboro at 5:15 PM? ;)

Best,

Hm.....How about: Faster travel times. Better maintained road surface. 
Less congestion. Less police presence/harassment. Better roadside 
stops. Dedicated emergency services access roads.

Why not? Judging from the history of most other public services, there 
are private counterparts created that are economically feasible, and 
which offer clear premium services. Free public schooling doesn't mean 
that private schools don't exist. Free public policing doesn't mean 
that there aren't security firms and private bodyguards.

The "inferior net" (I'm not touching the political swipe).... which 
people would then gladly upgrade *from*, in order to get *to* having a 
superior product. You've already noted *why* the market could offer 
profitable alternatives.

The market can then fight over which of their new products are more 
superior, instead of doing what the market is currently doing (which 
doesn't seem to be an awful lot, save for cell connections)...

Let's see, in this case, they (private sector) could then offer better 
citywide area coverage, faster access points, better security 
standards, in-line IPS, better tech support, more overall uptime, less 
fear of "government snooping", no "censorship"... and that's just a few 
seconds worth of ideas. Who knows, maybe there are numerous premiums 
that the market hasn't thought of yet, because the market hasn't 
invested themselves in actually creating the *product* yet.

I actually thought Randal was referring to republican in the general 
sense, not the political party sense. In reality, both left and right 
and most of those in the middle are republicans. As in this country is a 
republic. Meaning a representative government.

Nah. It's all about welfare. The Dems want to give welfare to 
individuals in need, the Repugnants want to give welfare to corporations 
not in need. It's all still welfare, though

Yup. And that's why I pay US$900 a month for health coverage here and 
will pay US$80 up in Canada. And US$1250 per year for my motorcycle 
(with NO accidents) and will pay about US$100 up there.

Allowing private industry to take on a monopoly position is why taxes 
are SO much higher here than they are there - the difference is that I 
have to pay taxes to corporations whose primary interest is profit here 
(ever consider driving without insurance?), while there I get to pay 
taxes to the guvmint.

When our version of State Monopoly Capitalism (described so well by Karl 
Marx about 120 years ago) is compared with a mixed economy like 
Canada's, it always comes out looking pretty lame. So we have folks like 
Gush Windbag telling us, "But that's SOCIALISM, folks!" And I answer:

"Alright! Give me more socialism!"

How does publically subsidized wireless help *all* people? I don't see all
people walking around with wireless network devices, especially the
downtrodden and poor.  Seems like it would primarily benefit the
technocratic elite (the users and developers of said network), at
everyone's expense.

I'm not questioning your broad categorization of the lefties motives, but
if you want to improve everyone's standard of living going this route,
shouldn't we be distributing publically subsidized laptops first, or maybe
publically subsidized  healthcare, fixing pot holes, extra buses, etc.
etc.?

Unlike a number of posters to this thread, I haven't seen the 
business-card CD-Rs in some time. The round ones with 220 MB are still 
plentiful, however. Can anyone cite a *confirmed* local source of 
business-card (50 MB) CD-Rs?

Folks:

Discussions of politics belong on plug-talk.  So far, everyone
in this discussion has the self-control to move, but there is at
least one fellow on the list who can't control himself when political
discussions happen (you know who I mean), and if he gets involved,
then the main plug list melts down for a while. 

So please move the discussion.  And forgive me for introducing a 
non-technical topic on the plug list.

Having the discussion in PLUG-Talk is low visibility, while the PLUG
list itself is Off-Topic. For those of you willing to post your thoughts
publicly, News4Neighbors has posted Randall Lucas' proposal for public
comment:

http://www.news4neighbors.net/article.pl?sid=05/07/26/2315232

The posting already has a response from Nigel Ballard, the person who
wrote in the "Walled Garden" aspect of the RFP.

Hope to see you there,

David

PS The N4N.org site is built on Slash, so should be reasonably easy to
use for people familiar with Slash itself.

Hi All,
Wonder if anyone could give me an example.. it's been a while since I've
done SQL commands that are more complicated:

I need to clean up our database. The tables and files are a bit
complicated but the general gist of what I need to do is like this
(sorry.. best way I can explain it is psuedo code)

Select Atable where Company = 1212 and Date < "2005-01-01"
  ** ok, this is the basic select I want from the file and I only need
the "fileID" from this table **

*** Once all of the fileID's from the above select has been performed, I
want to run a delete routine for every fileID from that first select ***
For (?? Every fileID)
  Delete tableB, Delete tableC....etc.
  Next fileID

Lol.. guess it's been a while since I've coded stuff. The only real
element that is in common for all of the tables is the fileID on the
first "Atable". I want to select all of the fileID's for that company
that meets the date requirements, then delete each table associated for
that fileID.  Hope that makes some sense. I can to the first select and
know how do perform the deletes.. I'm just missing that next step of
getting all of the selected fileID's and then read them back into the
next selection.

Thanks,
Steve

Steve,

   Does mysql support cascading deletes? If so, deleting fileID from Atable
will also delete related records in all other tables. I could give you the
postgres syntax but not the mysql syntax.

With a *real* database (hint: "not MySQL"), referential cascading delete
would take care of that.  Short of that, you could do something like:

DELETE
FROM tableb
WHERE fileid IN (
  SELECT fileid
  FROM tablea
  WHERE company = 1212 AND date < "2005-01-01"
)

Presuming MySQL now supports subselects (which I think it has, finally
catching it up with the 90s).  Repeat this as needed for each of your
other tables.

Of course, friends don't let friends use MySQL any more.

Thanks guys,
Yes, I've noticed some problems using MySQL, lol, plus we have an older
version... so I'm just selecting the first part and placing it to a
comma delimited file, then pasting them in for the delete statements..
guess I'll be here all day!

Get mysql to build the statements for you, e.g.,


echo <<ENDQUERY | mysql --batch yourDatabase | sed 's!\t! !g'
select
   'delete from tableB where fileID =', fileID, ';',
   'delete from tableC where fileID =', fileID, ';',
   'delete from tableD where fileID =', fileID, ';',
   'delete from tableE where fileID =', fileID, ';'
from
   tableA
where
   tableA.Company = 1212 and tableA.Date < '2005-01-01';
ENDQUERY


Pipe the result to a file, edit as necessary, and execute the resulting 
instruction set as an SQL query.

Note that not all versions of sed will do the right thing here, but GNU 
sed works as expected.

Subject: [PLUG] css questions
Message-ID: <965f90c205072815473ea06635@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to teach myself css, in order to fiddle with gmail. 
Specifically, I want to shrink the righthand sidebar (Where the 'New
Window' and 'Print' links are, and where the ads are displayed) to
give more room to display the messages.

I installed the webdeveloper extension in firefox so that I could tell
what the ids of the various pieces were, and then came up with:


/* Shrink the right-hand sidebar */
body#mail-google-com #rh { max-width: 8em !important; background: #f88
!important; }

body#mail-google-com #ap { background: #88f !important; }

/* Shrink text of ads */
body#mail-google-com #ad { font-size: x-small !important; background:
#0f0 !important; }


Coloring the different bits lets me see that, indeed, the rhs is
narrower than it used to be.  Unfortunately, it's still located in the
same position as it was, with a wide margin between its right edge and
the edge of the window.

Does anyone have any ideas about how I can force it over to the right
(which I hope will let the message body expand to fill the unused
space)?

That's a perfect example of why MySQL hasn't supported subqueries for so
long.  People who don't know what they're doing over-use them when joins
make far more sense.

How about something like:

DELETE tableb
FROM tableb
LEFT JOIN tablea
ON tableb.fileid = tableb.fileid
WHERE tablea.company = 1212 AND tablea.date < "2005-01-01"

That's what my one year of SQL experience (that is to say, very little)
tells me to use.  Warning: it is untested.  :-)

To spare the list a lot of repetition, we rejoin the story where I've 
been trying to use the SuSE 9.3 CD set I burned on another machine. The 
process has been failing shortly after beginning, at the point where it 
says, "Searching for info file..." Various recommendations have been 
made and tried, the last of which is:

Jason R. Martin wrote:

I tried burning a second CD-1 at a slower speed and checked the MD5SUM 
on both machines, and again the MD5SUM on the machine on which I burned 
the CD was correct, but on the machine I'm trying to install on, it was 
incorrect.

MARGINAL CD DRIVE WAS THE PROBLEM.

I changed the CD drive for another I had in an otherwise dead machine, 
and tried again, this time it boots and runs the install just fine.

Since I had installed SuSE 9.1 on the machine, and upgrading from the CD 
set to 9.3 is an option, I'm giving that a try to see how it goes. If it 
is clean, I may use that approach to upgrade this system -- but only 
after backups, of course.

There's only 5:36:21 to go, so I'll have to wait to declare success. 
Hmmm. Now there's 5:42:28, and it says that it's looking at CD2 even 
though CD 2 is sitting on my desk!

Be sure to tune in next week for the continuation of our saga.

Ali,

   It's been a while since I re-did my web site, but ... elements have
padding, margins, and something else which I forget off-hand. The padding is
between the content and the box, the margin and other thing are outside. I'll
look it up tomorrow in my Eric Meyer on CSS books if you'd like me to do so.

   There are a lot of css sites on the web that have great examples. I no
longer have the basic CSS book or the cookbook.

The CSS Box Model.  They have padding, borders, and margins.  Padding
goes between the block elements and the border, the border around the
padding, and the margin around the border.  The W3C page on the box
model does a quite nice job of explaining it (oddly enough)...

You can't do that.  That's why I did it my way.  The SQL99 syntax is:

DELETE FROM table WHERE condition

You don't get to spell out a join there.  In your join, would you
be deleting rows from tableb or tablea?  See why that doesn't work!

Oh, but you can.  See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/delete.html for
more information.  Or give it a try.  I'll bet it's quicker than your
subquery, as well.

> DELETE FROM table WHERE condition

It may not be valid SQL99, but it has been supported in MySQL since
verison 4.0.0.  You'd have to ask a MySQL guru about it's propriety.
I'm far from a MySQL guru.

Look at the top line of the above query and you'll see I'm deleting rows
from tableb.  In real life, I generally spell it out as tableb.* so it
is more clear which table is having rows removed from it.  Note you
could remove the rows from both tables by listing both the table names
in the DELETE line above (tableb, tablea).

IMHO, you shouldn't badmouth a piece of software as big and popular as
MySQL without really understanding said software and its deficiencies.
Yes, it is far from perfect, but a lot of what people say "sucks" about
MySQL doesn't really suck at all these days.

This ain't your father's MySQL.

   If I want a directory on a web server to be invisible to the public, but
allow individuals to download files by specifying them by name, do I set the
directory permissions at 700?

   I know the read and execute bits let people list the directory contents
(which is not desired in this situation), and the write bits allow adding or
removing of files. So I'm checking.

   Perhaps the better way is to put the files in a directory on the server but
not have any links to that directory. This means users must know it's there
in order to access files in it.

   Are there simple username/passwd setups that will also control access to
directories and files that are easy to set up and for a non-techie to
maintain?

TIA,

I believe 711 will work.

Execute bit should allow entry (as in download), but read on the 
directory should be required to see the contents.

Just make the directory non-searchable. (chmod o-x <directory>) and
you should be set.  I'm sure there's a better way to do what you want,
with some "real" authentication, as you inticate below, but I think
this does what you describe above.  The user and group bits shouldn't
matter. (unless, perhaps if the file is owned by the same user that
the webserver runs as... but that's just conjecture..)

No go.

I'm not changing the paddings or the margin, so it should be using
whatever values are in the original html (which is actually being spit
out by javascript, so I can't tell what they are).

I 'm wondering if the position of the sidebar is set in concrete in
the html.  I've tried setting the position and float styles, but never
saw the position change.

(I have been able to tell, by using webdeveloper, that the sidebar is
a div, which is chock full of a bunch of other div's.)

How are they going to be downloading them? Via ftp/sftp/etc. or via the 
web server?

In the case of Apache, what you want to do is turn of indexing for the 
directory:


<Directory /foo/bar/bah>
    Options -Indexes
</Directory>

The Unix permissions on the directory don't matter so much as long as 
Apache can read the directory and the files and they can't be 
overwritten by anyone else...

Waste of what?  When I bought a batch of CD-R business cards a few
years ago (gosh, it musta bean like 5 years ago now!), regular CD-Rs
were a fraction of the price.  I would rather waste polycarbonate
plastic than dollars.

What distribution are you using?

With the Prism2 cards it "just worked".

With the Atheros chipset, I had to build the MadWifi drivers. (It takes
a bit of black magic to get these to work on the AMD64, but easy once
you know how.)

What features do you need? Do you need to run apps like Kismet or
airsnort?  Do you need 802.11g or 802.11a?

It's still not ACID compliant when data gets lost, even with InnoDB
tables.  As long as you can store 1e20 into an int field, only to have
it silently truncated to 65535, it's not going into any production use
that *I* have for it.

Yeah, it's my confused uncle's MySQL. :)

Again, I'm not a MySQL guru, so I spoke with a few folks who are.
Everybody seems to be in agreement that if you're using InnoDB tables,
you're fully ACID compliant.  Now, I understand there is some difference
in interpretations for your above truncation case.  Some believe such
things have nothing to do with ACID, some believe the database should at
least warn you before the truncation, and some believe it should
outright refuse any query that tries to put a too-large number in to an
int field that isn't set up to hold said number.

Why you would be putting a huge number in to a field that isn't set up
to hold a huge number seems like an important question, as well.

But, fear not.  With MySQL 4.1 (the current recommended release) you can
configurably have warnings pop up for such queries.  In MySQL 5.0, you
can have warnings appear for such queries or have it outright refuse a
query that puts a too-large number in to an int field.  Yay for choice!

MySQL.  It just works, too.  ;-)

Really, it's great to have choice out there... it keeps things
innovative.  Unfortunately there's a lot of MySQL-related FUD out there
mostly based around old issues that haven't existed for years.  Yes,
MySQL didn't support transactions and subqueries and such five years
ago.  But it does today... and it does a nice job of it today.

   Thanks, Rob. I was rather burned out from a long meeting in Salem and

PLUG and Linux Fund will be sharing a booth at OSCON on Aug 3 & 4.
As always, we invite people from other LUGS such as Biznix, MWVLUG, 
ELUG, and others to share as well.

Scott Rainey <scotch7 at gmail.com> is putting together everything we
will need for the booth - table, chairs, etc.

I am going to do my best to put together a one page flyer on
Linux in Oregon with a bias toward PLUG this weekend.
I will also bring the few ubuntu and Knoppix CDs I have left.
If anyone else has flyers for their LUG or LUG like group or
OpenSource project, we would be happy to pass these out as well.  
Just get them to one of us or to the booth.

I'm not planning to bring any computers or demonstrate anything cool
or anything like that.  If anyone is into this, that would be cool.
Let Scott Rainey know, so we won't over do things but that seems 
unlikely.

Also, as I recall Charles Sliger <chaz at bctonline.com> and 
Alan at ClueServer.org said they would be available to help.
I will as well.  I can't be there the whole time, and I'm sure
the others can't either.  If others could help that would be good.
Let Scott Rainey <scotch7 at gmail.com> know and he will sort of
roughly schedule things so we will have things covered without
killing anyone.

By the way, we still need a speaker for Thursday night's PLUG
meeting.  Any volunteers?

                                          Thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] Thinkpad T42, Debian sarge, and the MBR
Message-ID: <1122655163.2669.15.camel@localhost.localdomain>

My thinkpad was delivered yesterday morning by a friendly man in a brown
suit. I promptly installed Debian and put GRUB on the MBR. Dual boot now
works well, but I cannot get into "IBM Rescue and Recovery" by pressing
the "Access IBM" button during POST. Before the install, I could.

After discovering this, but before doing anything more, I booted to
windows and burned the "IBM Product Recovery" CDs (7 CDs in total!)

It appears from reading other people's stories that the problem with
booting IBM's special recovery application lies in replacing the
factory-installed MBR with GRUB's MBR. 

First question: does the netinst r0a debian-installer make a backup of
the MBR? If so, how do I restore it?

Second question: Are those CDs I made likely to restore to factory
condition, or might they fail partway through and leave me with no
windows, no special partition, and no Debian?

Thanks for your help,
Evan

Some people use it with a keychain drive. Having done
this, they set up symlinks to files in /etc. Perhaps
it would be less trouble in the long run if they
installed it to the HD.

The download link to which I was referred is fairly
slow, due to the traffic. But it does not tie up the
connection while it downloads.

It sounds like you may have blown away the HPA partition:

http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/PreDesktop_Area

My guess is that the restore discs will put everything back to
out-of-the-box condition.

I put grub in the MBR on my T42 the day before yesterday, and just
popped into the bios this morning with the blue button, so that's
(probably) not the problem.

It is amazing how my current favorite high volume site (flickr.com) 
works so nicely with such an inferior back-end. I don't know the real 
story behind this site, maybe they use a different database, but the 
other day I saw an MySql error message.

Speaking of hopefully, you've done a Google search already, right?

What are you looking for: a) recommendations of what card to get, b)
driver recommendations for a particular card you already have, c) war
stories for your amusement, d) a how-to website?

I've gotten working:
 - Orinoco Gold PCMCIA with drivers in stock Linux kernel
 - Broadcom MiniPCI and T-Mobile CardBus with NDISWrapper
 - Some weird chipset with MadWifi drivers
 - Prism II USB dongle with Linux-Wlan drivers

Subject: [PLUG] Logrorate: checking whether a file is open with prerorate?
Message-ID: <f4468cae05072912157f7a02b8@mail.gmail.com>

I've got a simple problem that I don't want to come up with a complex
solution for; I see the complex solution as writing my own logrorate
if I can't figure out how to do the simple thing :)

Problem:

I've gotta support a bad-bad-bad application that doesn't simply
append data to its log, it keeps the file open in memory, and writes
to it "from the last known offset into the file, according to its last
write"... according the the brilliant developer.

The issue is that I cannot use the create (move and create new
logfile) OR truncatecompress options... can't move it because it's
open for writing constantly (canNOT bring down the app), and when the
truncatecompress option is used, on the next write by the daemon the
"OLD" data that was removed becomes zero bytes up to the next write
offset:

The file becomes a gargantuan sparse file with some text at the end. 
At least they compress well :)

Solution:

use the prerotate script option to check each file being operated on,
and make sure it's not open; if it IS just do not operate on it (exit
and do nothing).

Unfortunately, even though I can have logrotate run the prerotate
script for EACH file matched by the wildcard (nosharedscripts
directive), there doesn't seem to be a documented way to know WHAT
file is being operated on per iteration.

Has anyone else had a similar situation, and thus a solution (any
solution) other than writing a cusom backup script?

Cheers,

/eli

I bought a really cheap Gateway-branded card ($5+shipping) on eBay that
turned out to be a PrismII chipset but unrecognized vendor IDs.  Found
the IDs, put them in the config file and it's worked fine since.  I
submitted a bug on the pcmcia-cs site to have the vendor IDs recognized
in the default configs; if you get one and don't have the latest (or
there hasn't been a new release since I submitted the bug), it's three
lines of configuration.

That's the "Rescue and Recovery" partition, and I'm pretty sure I didn't
blow it away. The partition still exists and I can sort-of boot it from
GRUB (but it ends in an incomprehensible windows-style error message)

The blue button now gets me into the BIOS, but it used to get me into
the predesktop area.

It's good to hear you say the restore discs should still work. I think
that's what I'll do, if I can't find a copy of the original MBR
somewhere.

Don't confuse downloading via ftp with a web browser, with downloading 
from a web server.

The first uses an ftp server, the second uses a web server.

The solution I provided would be for an ftp server.

Grishnav is correct if the download is coming from a web server.

Subject: [PLUG] Logrotate: checking whether a file is open with prerotate?
Message-ID: <f4468cae050729142749a49c60@mail.gmail.com>

I've got a simple problem that I don't want to come up with a complex
solution for; I see the complex solution as writing my own logrorate
if I can't figure out how to do the simple thing :)

Problem:

I've gotta support a bad-bad-bad application that doesn't simply
append data to its log, it keeps the file open in memory, and writes
to it "from the last known offset into the file, according to its last
write"... according the the brilliant developer.

The issue is that I cannot use the create (move and create new
logfile) OR truncatecompress options... can't move it because it's
open for writing constantly (canNOT bring down the app), and when the
truncatecompress option is used, on the next write by the daemon the
"OLD" data that was removed becomes zero bytes up to the next write
offset:

The file becomes a gargantuan sparse file with some text at the end.
At least they compress well :)

Solution:

use the prerotate script option to check each file being operated on,
and make sure it's not open; if it IS just do not operate on it (exit
and do nothing).

Unfortunately, even though I can have logrotate run the prerotate
script for EACH file matched by the wildcard (nosharedscripts
directive), there doesn't seem to be a documented way to know WHAT
file is being operated on per iteration.

Has anyone else had a similar situation, and thus a solution (any
solution) other than writing a cusom backup script?

Cheers,

/eli

Upon further investigation (ie, I found how to display more
information with webdeveloper) I found that the layout was happening
through a combination of div's and span's.  Now these are new in html
since the last time I did any.  But I can put it on my list of things
to learn (after working on my Google maps app and transcribing some
13th century music).

In the meantime, I've come up with a kludge.  Since my main issue is
to get the message body wide enough to avoid the saw-edging that
happens when displaying 80-character wide text in a less than
80-character wide widget, I simply forced the message body to be
approximately 80 characters wide (in my preferred font), thusly:

body#mail-google-com .mb { width: 500px !important;}

There's still a blank space to the right of the rhs, but I can simply ignore it.

You could:
  body#mail-google-com .mb { width: 82em; }

1 em is the size of a character.[1]

With that definition you can also increase and decrease your font size
and still keep the body window slightly wider than the 80 characters 
you desire.

The obvious one would be to use "delaycompress".

Ali,

   "div" is a convenient way of chunking items you want to treat as a unit; 
for example, a set of links that's separate from the body text. "span" lets
you define a string over which to apply a set of attributes.

   On my new site I use span to make the company name display differently from
the rest of the text:

<span class="aesi">Applied Ecosystem newstuff.html:Services, Inc.</span>

   The site.css for this is:

.aesi   {font-variant: small-caps;}

   Here's an example of a div within my site.css:

div#navlist {
         position: absolute;
         z-index: 100;
         top: 10em;
         left: 22%;
         width: 10em;
         background: #096;
         font-size: 125%;
         }

HTH,

Rich

   It's actually the size of an 'em-dash' which is entered in TeX as '--'.

I tried that one first.

em is the size of an 'M', the widest character in the alphabet.

Since gmail uses a proporation font, the window ended up being
extraordinarily wide.

Actually, and em-dash is a dash that's the width of an 'M', as Ali just
mentioned, not the other way around.

<pedantic level="excessive">

That's a popular way to think about it (em and en dashes being 'M' and 
'N' width in a given font), however, that's not entirely the whole 
story... some fonts have no letter 'M' or 'N', and thus, the meaning 
has changed over the years. An em-dash is now typically one "em" unit 
in length, regardless of the size (or presence) of the letter 'M' in a 
given font. An en is half of an em.

So, if an em unit is not actually fixed to an 'M' character, what 
determines it's size? It's fixed to the size of an imaginary box which 
all characters in a given font can fit into. So if a font had a larger 
letter in it than a letter 'M', the em unit for that font would be the 
size of the largest letter, horizontally as well as vertically (as not 
all character systems are horizontal).

See:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_%28typography%29>
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash>

Of course, for stylistic reasons, typographers do create fonts where an 
em-dash is *not* the size of the em, and the en-dash is *not* the size 
of an en or even half of an en, but the em size is constant, with an en 
being half of an em.

</pedantic>

I'm sure you were all dying to know that.

And if you actually read the snopes article, the author comes to
a false conclusion based on the facts presented - the horse's ass
theory is probably true, and that is what the text actually says. 

Since this is off topic, I will expand this on plug-talk.  See you

Since we're now aware that the em is sized based on the widest character
and we knew alreacy the not all characters are that wide, we can  no 
decide that in most cases the mix of letters will come out to, say,
70 em.  Using that there will be the right amount of space that 
grows or shrinks as you change your disply font or its size.

Or re-style gmail to use a monospace font, which, as I think about it,
would be a better way to display email.  (Those ascii art diagrams
that sometimes show up here just don't cut it in a proportional font.)

Message-ID: <42EC2D4B.1090303@frogleg.net>

Funseekers,

To provide controlled and metered Internet connectivity at a hotel (up 
to 200 people), does any of you have a pointer where to find either a 
reasonably priced, programmable router or a Linux router package for a 
DIY box? It should somehow work together with DHCP: if a guest pays for 
Internet (s)he should receive an IP address and timed access to the 
Internet.

If DIY is the way to go and someone is interested to do the iptable 
juggling on this project (not secured yet), please holler. I'll do the 
(Java -) application with web based interface. I'd mostly need shell 
scripts (or anything executable) to turn on/off routing for an 
individual IP address.

Thanks!!

Holger

NoCat was the first thing that came to mind.  It's what's known as a
"Captive Portal", redirecting users to a webpage until they authenticate.  
http://nocat.net/

A Freshmeat search for "nocat" turned up a couple of systems for doing
roughly what you want:
http://freshmeat.net/projects/icam/
http://freshmeat.net/projects/zonecd/

As an aside, charging for access is typically more trouble than it's
worth.  Like cable TV and other "free" stuff, it's all about drawing
customers from your competitors, even though your room rate's a couple
bucks higher.  It's just promotional overhead.

But hey, if they can make back the cost of the billing system before
the place down the block puts "Free Wi-Fi" on their sign, that's cool.

Waiting to see "Free VoIP long-distance" next,
  Aaron

Hey, thanks Aaron, that's a pretty good starting point. And it lead me 
to a couple of commercial vendors as well (thanks to Google Ads). First 
have to check what a finished product would cost. The one I liked best 
so far is offered by Wiology (needed three attempts to spell that name) 
and apparently costs around $1k. All open source (plus Java), interesting.

Yeah - I thought about this too. Thing is I don't own that hotel though. 
Unfortunately, I'd be enjoying life in Hawaii otherwise.

In that case it's more about the location then this extra. If you want 
to see the sunset, "down the block" won't do. :)

Doesn't that already exist? I scraped this from FatWallet the other day:

http://www.fatwallet.com/t/18/489656/: the best thing to do is buy a 
Sipura VOIP adapter {im using the SPA-2100} and sign up with stanaphone 
for free incoming, and globe7 for free outgoing and for international calls.

Thanks again!

Sounds about right.  You could knock something together yourself and
bill the time, but consider support/maintenance costs.

I was just thinking that a cute way to do things would be to generate
a bunch of random passwords, each good for 24 hours of access, and
laser-print 'em on business card stock with instructions.  It'd make
it dead easy for the clerks, who could just pull a card out of the
register and add a charge to the bill.  Heck, selling password refills
might be a good way to cover your support costs.

Heh.  Sounds like you'll have to do the installation onsite. 
It'll take a couple weeks, brah. ;)

Sorta-free, and limited to 1 minute.  But if you're a commercial
customer, you can buy VoIP minutes to regular land-line phones for
around $1 an *hour*.  I can imagine a hotel in a tight market getting
a leg up on the competition by advertising (limited) free LD calls.

Yes, and it also depends on how buttoned up the commercial product is. I 
need to control it through an API, not a GUI.

I like you way of thinking! Doesn't get any simpler than that. Selling 
Internet like a bag of chips. Actually they had suggested I'd tie into 
their software and add the service into the billing system directly. 
Then the clerk selects it just like any other room service with a mouse 
click. That's what the (outsourced) IT manager wants, anyway.

Only in my dreams. Well, I think that outsourced IT manager doesn't only 
like flying to Hawaii but also has a lover there, but he denies it.

Ah - 1 min, that kills it. I'm still going to buy an adapter and test it 
out. Friend of mine has a 1-800 number for $5/month, 2.6c/min.

Thanks!

So, has Wikipedia been used as a reference on this mailing

coincidence, like LinuxFund's grant of $6000 a couple
of weeks later.

Which is doable, as I'm sure you are aware, because you (with Firefox at
least) you can apply a local stylesheet to override the page's
stylesheet.  Or maybe that's what you're actually doing with the web
developer's extension.  Variable-width fonts also tend to mess up very
carefully laid-out signatures, which you no doubt don't want to miss in
their full glory.

I got a D-Link AirPlus PCMCIA card for my laptop.  This model
(DWL-G630) happens to be a rebranded Atheros, and uses the madwifi
drivers.  The madwifi drivers are developed and distributed by
Atheros.  They're proprietary.  Getting my card working with Gentoo
took a bit of effort, including recompiling the kernel with the proper
modules, etc.  Of course, Gentoo is about as far from plug-n-play as
you can get, so this isn't necessarily a strike against madwifi
itself.  Luckily it has pretty good documentation:

http://madwifi.sourceforge.net/dokuwiki/doku.php

I haven't been able to get the card working with WPA encryption, but
it's been a while since I've tried.  I'm currently relying on
"security through obscurity" :-/  I know that other people have gotten
madwifi working with WPA, I just haven't had the time to figure out
how.  Aside from that, the card performs well.

Doesn't this bad-bad-bad application support any sort of mechanism for
rotating logs?  If it's proprietary, the vendor should offer some sort
of solution, even if it's as half-baked and convoluted as the existing
logging system.  Or are you really expected to restart the application

I haven't been fond of this card.  I've had some problems where the 
driver quits working after a few hotplugs and I have to reboot to get 
wireless again.  It's my understanding (though it's been about a year 
since I messed with it) that some features (like WPA) are not available 
with this card.

I would sure like to hear more about that.

For a little more (say $700US) you can probably get a new low-end laptop 
that's about to be replaced with a more advanced technology. This time 
of year, the major electronics places have "Back to School" sales, so 
shop around. The advantage of getting, say, a year-old but new laptop, 
is that you'll get a decent-sized hard drive and the Linux community 
will have had a chance to come up with drivers for it.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0507311546500.4702@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Our ThinkPad 600E apparently shut down this morning without warning. I need
to upgrade some apps on it in any case, so I'm trying to do this.

   Running on the battery, I was returned to the login screen before I could
login and get the default desktop. However, upgrading packages is slow when
it's running on the battery so I shut it down and plugged it in. Now I'm
stuck at the KDM login screen; each attempt to log in as me or as root
returns me to that screen.

   I did not define a 'linux single' in /etc/lilo.conf, so I cannot get into
single user mode.

   Suggestions on how to figure out why it's cycling at the kdm login would be
very helpful.

TIA,

Rich

Use <CTRL><ALT><F1> (or F2, F3) and get a console session.  Then you can
check  ~/.xsession-errors

Mike,

   I should have mentioned that was the first thing I tried; I get a blank
screen, but no prompt. The laptop is running Slackware-10.1 and I just
upgraded xfce from -4.2.0 to -4.2.1.

Thanks,

Rich

I'd assume it's a mere coincidence, I've been writing and editing for 
wikipedia since January 24, 2003.... and unfortunately, I missed your

When you "truncated" do you really mean "inflated"?

   Update: I booted with Knoppix and changed /etc/inittab from runlevel 4
(GUI) to runlevel 3. I can boot just fine into a console and xfce4 starts
without a complaint.

   However, if -- as root -- I run /opt/kde/bin/kdm I'm again stuck in this
infinite loop.

   Is this an Xfce problem? A KDM problem? Or something else? If I have time
tomorrow I'll try a different GUI login, as long as it lets an ordinary user
shut down the system when finished.

I've been using it more since the talk (used to be I would just stumble 
on articles in a google (gg:) search.  In particular, the konqueror 
"wp:foo" shortcut has been oh-so-handy.

I haven't had that kind of problem, but I don't do a lot of
hotplugging.  My second-hand T20 Thinkpad has a whopping 2 hours of
battery life.  When it's at my desk I use the regular ethernet, and
when it's away, it's going to get rebooted pretty soon anyway.

Yeah, me too :-)  According to the forums I've read, it should be
possible to get madwifi working with WPA.  I haven't looked to see if
anyone is using WPA with this particular card though.

Something is deeply wrong.  You have a Thinkpad 600E, and those machines
are rather perverse to deal with if the hard disk won't boot, IIRC.  If
you can't get at a console with <CTRL><ALT><F1>, or stop X entirely with
<CTRL><ALT><BS>, then you will have to boot from a floppy (which is
external on the 600E) or else pull the hard drive and work on it on 
another machine (12 screws and a 2.5-to-3.5 adapter).  I suspect your
upgrade process failed or was interrupted at the wrong point, and it
damaged one of many critical files necessary to boot.

If it was a different kind of laptop, capable of booting from a CD
(600E's are not, I believe), then you could boot from a Knoppix disk
and fix things with that.

The Smart Boot Manager (was sbm.bin on the debian CD ~ Potato (looks 
like you'll have to build a floppy from source with the link below)) 
has been really handy for booting CD's on older machines.  Just put it 
on a floppy and boot, then select the cdrom.  Not sure what happens 
with exotic hardware, but if it can see the drive, you're golden.

  http://btmgr.webframe.org/

That assumes (of course) that you can have a floppy and cdrom attached 
to the machine at the same time.
